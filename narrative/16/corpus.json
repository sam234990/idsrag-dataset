In the Ars\u00e8ne Lupin universe, the Hollow Needle is the second secret of Marie Antoinette and Alessandro Cagliostro, the hidden fortune of the kings of France, as revealed to Ars\u00e8ne Lupin by Josephine Balsamo in the novel The Countess of Cagliostro (1924). The Mystery of the Hollow Needle hides a secret that the Kings of France have been handing down since the time of Julius Caesar... and now Ars\u00e8ne Lupin has mastered it. The legendary needle contains the most fabulous treasure ever imagined, a collection of queens' dowries, pearls, rubies, sapphires and diamonds... the fortune of the kings of France.\nWhen Isidore Beautrelet discovers the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Aiguille in the department of Creuse, he thinks that he has found the solution to the riddle (\"l'Aiguille Creuse\" being French for \"The Hollow Needle\", and also the French title of the novel). However, he did not realize that the ch\u00e2teau was built by Louis XIV, the king of France, to put people off the track of a needle in Normandy, near the town of Le Havre, where Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, known also under the name of Louis Valm\u00e9ras, has hidden himself.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Hollow Needle, by Maurice Leblanc\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

What do you think of my cockle-shell, Beautrelet?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOLLOW NEEDLE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE SHOT\n\n\nRaymonde listened. The noise was repeated twice over, clearly enough to\nbe distinguished from the medley of vague sounds that formed the great\nsilence of the night and yet too faintly to enable her to tell whether\nit was near or far, within the walls of the big country-house, or\noutside, among the murky recesses of the park.\n\nShe rose softly. Her window was half open: she flung it back wide. The\nmoonlight lay over a peaceful landscape of lawns and thickets, against\nwhich the straggling ruins of the old abbey stood out in tragic\noutlines, truncated columns, mutilated arches, fragments of porches and\nshreds of flying buttresses. A light breeze hovered over the face of\nthings, gliding noiselessly through the bare motionless branches of the\ntrees, but shaking the tiny budding leaves of the shrubs.\n\nAnd, suddenly, she heard the same sound again. It was on the left and\non the floor below her, in the living rooms, therefore, that occupied\nthe left wing of the house. Brave and plucky though she was, the girl\nfelt afraid. She slipped on her dressing gown and took the matches.\n\n\"Raymonde--Raymonde!\"\n\nA voice as low as a breath was calling to her from the next room, the\ndoor of which had not been closed. She was feeling her way there, when\nSuzanne, her cousin, came out of the room and fell into her arms:\n\n\"Raymonde--is that you? Did you hear--?\"\n\n\"Yes. So you're not asleep?\"\n\n\"I suppose the dog woke me--some time ago. But he's not barking now.\nWhat time is it?\"\n\n\"About four.\"\n\n\"Listen! Surely, some one's walking in the drawing room!\"\n\n\"There's no danger, your father is down there, Suzanne.\"\n\n\"But there is danger for him. His room is next to the boudoir.\"\n\n\"M. Daval is there too--\"\n\n\"At the other end of the house. He could never hear.\"\n\nThey hesitated, not knowing what course to decide upon. Should they\ncall out? Cry for help? They dared not; they were frightened of the\nsound of their own voices. But Suzanne, who had gone to the window,\nsuppressed a scream:\n\n\"Look!--A man!--Near the fountain!\"\n\nA man was walking away at a rapid pace. He carried under his arm a\nfairly large load, the nature of which they were unable to distinguish:\nit knocked against his leg and impeded his progress. They saw him pass\nnear the old chapel and turn toward a little door in the wall. The door\nmust have been open, for the man disappeared suddenly from view and\nthey failed to hear the usual grating of the hinges.\n\n\"He came from the drawing room,\" whispered Suzanne.\n\n\"No, the stairs and the hall would have brought him out more to the\nleft--Unless--\"\n\nThe same idea struck them both. They leant out. Below them, a ladder\nstood against the front of the house, resting on the first floor. A\nglimmer lit up the stone balcony. And another man, who was also\ncarrying something, bestrode the baluster, slid down the ladder and ran\naway by the same road as the first.\n\nSuzanne, scared to the verge of swooning, fell on her knees, stammering:\n\n\"Let us call out--let us call for help--\"\n\n\"Who would come? Your father--and if there are more of them left--and\nthey throw themselves upon him--?\"\n\n\"Then--then--we might call the servants--Your bell rings on their\nfloor.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--perhaps, that's better. If only they come in time!\"\n\nRaymonde felt for the electric push near her bed and pressed it with\nher finger. They heard the bell ring upstairs and had an impression\nthat its shrill sound must also reach any one below.\n\nThey waited. The silence became terrifying and the very breeze no\nlonger shook the leaves of the shrubs.\n\n\"I'm frightened--frightened,\" said Suzanne.\n\nAnd, suddenly, from the profound darkness below them, came the sound of\na struggle, a crash of furniture overturned, words, exclamations and\nthen, horrible and ominous, a hoarse groan, the gurgle of a man who is\nbeing murdered--\n\nRaymonde leapt toward the door. Suzanne clung desperately to her arm:\n\n\"No--no--don't leave me--I'm frightened--\"\n\nRaymonde pushed her aside and darted down the corridor, followed by\nSuzanne, who staggered from wall to wall, screaming as she went.\nRaymonde reached the staircase, flew down the stairs, flung herself\nupon the door of the big drawing room and stopped short, rooted to the\nthreshold, while Suzanne sank in a heap by her side. Facing them, at\nthree steps' distance, stood a man, with a lantern in his hand. He\nturned it upon the two girls, blinding them with the light, stared long\nat their pale faces, and then, without hurrying, with the calmest\nmovements in the world, took his cap, picked up a scrap of paper and\ntwo bits of straw, removed some footmarks from the carpet, went to the\nbalcony, turned to the girls, made them a deep bow and disappeared.\n\nSuzanne was the first to run to the little boudoir which separated the\nbig drawing-room from her father's bedroom. But, at the entrance, a\nhideous sight appalled her. By the slanting rays of the moon, she saw\ntwo apparently lifeless bodies lying close to each other on the floor.\nShe leaned over one of them:\n\n\"Father!--Father!--Is it you? What has happened to you?\" she cried,\ndistractedly.\n\nAfter a moment, the Comte de Gesvres moved. In a broken voice, he said:\n\n\"Don't be afraid--I am not wounded--Daval?--Is he alive?--The\nknife?--The knife?--\"\n\nTwo men-servants now arrived with candles. Raymonde flung herself down\nbefore the other body and recognized Jean Daval, the count's private\nsecretary. A little stream of blood trickled from his neck. His face\nalready wore the pallor of death.\n\nThen she rose, returned to the drawing room, took a gun that hung in a\ntrophy of arms on the wall and went out on the balcony. Not more than\nfifty or sixty seconds had elapsed since the man had set his foot on\nthe top rung of the ladder. He could not, therefore, be very far away,\nthe more so as he had taken the precaution to remove the ladder, in\norder to prevent the inmates of the house from using it. And soon she\nsaw him skirting the remains of the old cloister. She put the gun to\nher shoulder, calmly took aim and fired. The man fell.\n\n\"That's done it! That's done it!\" said one of the servants. \"We've got\nthis one. I'll run down.\"\n\n\"No, Victor, he's getting up.... You had better go down by the\nstaircase and make straight for the little door in the wall. That's the\nonly way he can escape.\"\n\nVictor hurried off, but, before he reached the park, the man fell down\nagain. Raymonde called the other servant:\n\n\"Albert, do you see him down there? Near the main cloister?--\"\n\n\"Yes, he's crawling in the grass. He's done for--\"\n\n\"Watch him from here.\"\n\n\"There's no way of escape for him. On the right of the ruins is the\nopen lawn--\"\n\n\"And, Victor, do you guard the door, on the left,\" she said, taking up\nher gun.\n\n\"But, surely, you are not going down, miss?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, with a resolute accent and abrupt movements; \"let\nme be--I have a cartridge left--If he stirs--\"\n\nShe went out. A moment later, Albert saw her going toward the ruins. He\ncalled to her from the window:\n\n\"He's dragged himself behind the cloister. I can't see him. Be careful,\nmiss--\"\n\nRaymonde went round the old cloisters, to cut off the man's retreat,\nand Albert soon lost sight of her. After a few minutes, as he did not\nsee her return, he became uneasy and, keeping his eye on the ruins,\ninstead of going down by the stairs he made an effort to reach the\nladder. When he had succeeded, he scrambled down and ran straight to\nthe cloisters near which he had seen the man last. Thirty paces\nfarther, he found Raymonde, who was searching with Victor.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"There's no laying one's hands on him,\" replied Victor.\n\n\"The little door?\"\n\n\"I've been there; here's the key.\"\n\n\"Still--he must--\"\n\n\"Oh, we've got him safe enough, the scoundrel--He'll be ours in ten\nminutes.\"\n\nThe farmer and his son, awakened by the shot, now came from the farm\nbuildings, which were at some distance on the right, but within the\ncircuit of the walls. They had met no one.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Albert. \"The ruffian can't have left the\nruins--We'll dig him out of some hole or other.\"\n\nThey organized a methodical search, beating every bush, pulling aside\nthe heavy masses of ivy rolled round the shafts of the columns. They\nmade sure that the chapel was properly locked and that none of the\npanes were broken. They went round the cloisters and examined every\nnook and corner. The search was fruitless.\n\nThere was but one discovery: at the place where the man had fallen\nunder Raymonde's gun, they picked up a chauffeur's cap, in very soft\nbuff leather; besides that, nothing.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gendarmerie of Ouville-la-Riviere were informed at six o'clock in\nthe morning and at once proceeded to the spot, after sending an express\nto the authorities at Dieppe with a note describing the circumstances\nof the crime, the imminent capture of the chief criminal and \"the\ndiscovery of his headgear and of the dagger with which the crime had\nbeen committed.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock, two hired conveyances came down the gentle slope that\nled to the house. One of them, an old-fashioned calash, contained the\ndeputy public prosecutor and the examining magistrate, accompanied by\nhis clerk. In the other, a humble fly, were seated two reporters,\nrepresenting the Journal de Rouen and a great Paris paper.\n\nThe old chateau came into view--once the abbey residence of the priors\nof Ambrumesy, mutilated under the Revolution, both restored by the\nComte de Gesvres, who had now owned it for some twenty years. It\nconsists of a main building, surmounted by a pinnacled clock-tower, and\ntwo wings, each of which is surrounded by a flight of steps with a\nstone balustrade. Looking across the walls of the park and beyond the\nupland supported by the high Norman cliffs, you catch a glimpse of the\nblue line of the Channel between the villages of Sainte-Marguerite and\nVarengeville.\n\nHere the Comte de Gesvres lived with his daughter Suzanne, a delicate,\nfair-haired, pretty creature, and his niece Raymonde de Saint-Veran,\nwhom he had taken to live with him two years before, when the\nsimultaneous death of her father and mother left Raymonde an orphan.\nLife at the chateau was peaceful and regular. A few neighbors paid an\noccasional visit. In the summer, the count took the two girls almost\nevery day to Dieppe. He was a tall man, with a handsome, serious face\nand hair that was turning gray. He was very rich, managed his fortune\nhimself and looked after his extensive estates with the assistance of\nhis secretary, Jean Daval.\n\nImmediately upon his arrival, the examining magistrate took down the\nfirst observations of Sergeant Quevillon of the gendarmes. The capture\nof the criminal, imminent though it might be, had not yet been\neffected, but every outlet of the park was held. Escape was impossible.\n\nThe little company next crossed the chapter-hall and the refectory,\nboth of which are on the ground floor, and went up to the first story.\nThey at once remarked the perfect order that prevailed in the drawing\nroom. Not a piece of furniture, not an ornament but appeared to occupy\nits usual place; nor was there any gap among the ornaments or\nfurniture. On the right and left walls hung magnificent Flemish\ntapestries with figures. On the panels of the wall facing the windows\nwere four fine canvases, in contemporary frames, representing\nmythological scenes. These were the famous pictures by Rubens which had\nbeen left to the Comte de Gesvres, together with the Flemish\ntapestries, by his maternal uncle, the Marques de Bobadilla, a Spanish\ngrandee.\n\nM. Filleul remarked:\n\n\"If the motive of the crime was theft, this drawing room, at any rate,\nwas not the object of it.\"\n\n\"You can't tell!\" said the deputy, who spoke little, but who, when he\ndid, invariably opposed the magistrate's views.\n\n\"Why, my dear sir, the first thought of a burglar would be to carry off\nthose pictures and tapestries, which are universally renowned.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there was no time.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Comte de Gesvres entered, accompanied by the\ndoctor. The count, who did not seem to feel the effects of the attack\nto which he had been subjected, welcomed the two officials. Then he\nopened the door of the boudoir.\n\nThis room, which no one had been allowed to enter since the discovery\nof the crime, differed from the drawing room inasmuch as it presented a\nscene of the greatest disorder. Two chairs were overturned, one of the\ntables smashed to pieces and several objects--a traveling-clock, a\nportfolio, a box of stationery--lay on the floor. And there was blood\non some of the scattered pieces of note-paper.\n\nThe doctor turned back the sheet that covered the corpse. Jean Daval,\ndressed in his usual velvet suit, with a pair of nailed boots on his\nfeet, lay stretched on his back, with one arm folded beneath him. His\ncollar and tie had been removed and his shirt opened, revealing a large\nwound in the chest.\n\n\"Death must have been instantaneous,\" declared the doctor. \"One blow of\nthe knife was enough.\"\n\n\"It was, no doubt, the knife which I saw on the drawing-room\nmantelpiece, next to a leather cap?\" said the examining magistrate.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Comte de Gesvres, \"the knife was picked up here. It\ncomes from the same trophy in the drawing room from which my niece,\nMlle. de Saint-Veran, snatched the gun. As for the chauffeur's cap,\nthat evidently belongs to the murderer.\"\n\nM. Filleul examined certain further details in the room, put a few\nquestions to the doctor and then asked M. de Gesvres to tell him what\nhe had seen and heard. The count worded his story as follows:\n\n\"Jean Daval woke me up. I had been sleeping badly, for that matter,\nwith gleams of consciousness in which I seemed to hear noises, when,\nsuddenly opening my eyes, I saw Daval standing at the foot of my bed,\nwith his candle in his hand and fully dressed--as he is now, for he\noften worked late into the night. He seemed greatly excited and said,\nin a low voice: 'There's some one in the drawing room.' I heard a noise\nmyself. I got up and softly pushed the door leading to this boudoir. At\nthe same moment, the door over there, which opens into the big drawing\nroom, was thrown back and a man appeared who leaped at me and stunned\nme with a blow on the temple. I am telling you this without any\ndetails, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, for the simple reason that I\nremember only the principal facts, and that these facts followed upon\none another with extraordinary swiftness.\"\n\n\"And after that?--\"\n\n\"After that, I don't know--I fainted. When I came to, Daval lay\nstretched by my side, mortally wounded.\"\n\n\"At first sight, do you suspect no one?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"You have no enemy?\"\n\n\"I know of none.\"\n\n\"Nor M. Daval either?\"\n\n\"Daval! An enemy? He was the best creature that ever lived. M. Daval\nwas my secretary for twenty years and, I may say, my confidant; and I\nhave never seen him surrounded with anything but love and friendship.\"\n\n\"Still, there has been a burglary and there has been a murder: there\nmust be a motive for all that.\"\n\n\"The motive? Why, it was robbery pure and simple.\"\n\n\"Robbery? Have you been robbed of something, then?\"\n\n\"No, nothing.\"\n\n\"In that case--?\"\n\n\"In that case, if they have stolen nothing and if nothing is missing,\nthey at least took something away.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But my daughter and my niece will tell you, with\nabsolute certainty, that they saw two men in succession cross the park\nand that those two men were carrying fairly heavy loads.\"\n\n\"The young ladies--\"\n\n\"The young ladies may have been dreaming, you think? I should be\ntempted to believe it, for I have been exhausting myself in inquiries\nand suppositions ever since this morning. However, it is easy enough to\nquestion them.\"\n\nThe two cousins were sent for to the big drawing room. Suzanne, still\nquite pale and trembling, could hardly speak. Raymonde, who was more\nenergetic, more of a man, better looking, too, with the golden glint in\nher brown eyes, described the events of the night and the part which\nshe had played in them.\n\n\"So I may take it, mademoiselle, that your evidence is positive?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. The men who went across the park were carrying things away\nwith them.\"\n\n\"And the third man?\"\n\n\"He went from here empty-handed.\"\n\n\"Could you describe him to us?\"\n\n\"He kept on dazzling us with the light of his lantern. All that I could\nsay is that he is tall and heavily built.\"\n\n\"Is that how he appeared to you, mademoiselle?\" asked the magistrate,\nturning to Suzanne de Gesvres.\n\n\"Yes--or, rather, no,\" said Suzanne, reflecting. \"I thought he was\nabout the middle height and slender.\"\n\nM. Filleul smiled; he was accustomed to differences of opinion and\nsight in witnesses to one and the same fact:\n\n\"So we have to do, on the one hand, with a man, the one in the drawing\nroom, who is, at the same time, tall and short, stout and thin, and, on\nthe other, with two men, those in the park, who are accused of removing\nfrom that drawing room objects--which are still here!\"\n\nM. Filleul was a magistrate of the ironic school, as he himself would\nsay. He was also a very ambitious magistrate and one who did not object\nto an audience nor to an occasion to display his tactful resource in\npublic, as was shown by the increasing number of persons who now\ncrowded into the room. The journalists had been joined by the farmer\nand his son, the gardener and his wife, the indoor servants of the\nchateau and the two cabmen who had driven the flies from Dieppe.\n\nM. Filleul continued:\n\n\"There is also the question of agreeing upon the way in which the third\nperson disappeared. Was this the gun you fired, mademoiselle, and from\nthis window?\"\n\n\"Yes. The man reached the tombstone which is almost buried under the\nbrambles, to the left of the cloisters.\"\n\n\"But he got up again?\"\n\n\"Only half. Victor ran down at once to guard the little door and I\nfollowed him, leaving the second footman, Albert, to keep watch here.\"\n\nAlbert now gave his evidence and the magistrate concluded:\n\n\"So, according to you, the wounded man was not able to escape on the\nleft, because your fellow-servant was watching the door, nor on the\nright, because you would have seen him cross the lawn. Logically,\ntherefore, he is, at the present moment, in the comparatively\nrestricted space that lies before our eyes.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"And you, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" said Victor.\n\nThe deputy prosecutor exclaimed, with a leer:\n\n\"The field of inquiry is quite narrow. We have only to continue the\nsearch commenced four hours ago.\"\n\n\"We may be more fortunate.\"\n\nM. Filleul took the leather cap from the mantel, examined it and,\nbeckoning to the sergeant of gendarmes, whispered:\n\n\"Sergeant, send one of your men to Dieppe at once. Tell him to go to\nMaigret, the hatter, in the Rue de la Barre, and ask M. Maigret to tell\nhim, if possible, to whom this cap was sold.\"\n\nThe \"field of inquiry,\" in the deputy's phrase, was limited to the\nspace contained between the house, the lawn on the right and the angle\nformed by the left wall and the wall opposite the house, that is to\nsay, a quadrilateral of about a hundred yards each way, in which the\nruins of Ambrumesy, the famous mediaeval monastery, stood out at\nintervals.\n\nThey at once noticed the traces left by the fugitive in the trampled\ngrass. In two places, marks of blackened blood, now almost dried up,\nwere observed. After the turn at the end of the cloisters, there was\nnothing more to be seen, as the nature of the ground, here covered with\npine-needles, did not lend itself to the imprint of a body. But, in\nthat case, how had the wounded man succeeded in escaping the eyes of\nRaymonde, Victor and Albert? There was nothing but a few brakes, which\nthe servants and the gendarmes had beaten over and over again, and a\nnumber of tombstones, under which they had explored. The examining\nmagistrate made the gardener, who had the key, open the chapel, a real\ngem of carving, a shrine in stone which had been respected by time and\nthe revolutionaries, and which, with the delicate sculpture work of its\nporch and its miniature population of statuettes, was always looked\nupon as a marvelous specimen of the Norman-Gothic style. The chapel,\nwhich was very simple in the interior, with no other ornament than its\nmarble altar, offered no hiding-place. Besides, the fugitive would have\nhad to obtain admission. And by what means?\n\nThe inspection brought them to the little door in the wall that served\nas an entrance for the visitors to the ruins. It opened on a sunk road\nrunning between the park wall and a copsewood containing some abandoned\nquarries. M. Filleul stooped forward: the dust of the road bore marks\nof anti-skid pneumatic tires. Raymonde and Victor remembered that,\nafter the shot, they had seemed to hear the throb of a motor-car.\n\nThe magistrate suggested:\n\n\"The man must have joined his confederates.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Victor. \"I was here while mademoiselle and Albert\nstill had him in view.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, he must be somewhere! Outside or inside: we have no choice!\"\n\n\"He is here,\" the servants insisted, obstinately.\n\nThe magistrate shrugged his shoulders and went back to the house in a\nmore or less sullen mood. There was no doubt that it was an unpromising\ncase. A theft in which nothing had been stolen; an invisible prisoner:\nwhat could be less satisfactory?\n\nIt was late. M. de Gesvres asked the officials and the two journalists\nto stay to lunch. They ate in silence and then M. Filleul returned to\nthe drawing room, where he questioned the servants. But the sound of a\nhorse's hoofs came from the courtyard and, a moment after, the gendarme\nwho had been sent to Dieppe entered.\n\n\"Well, did you see the hatter?\" exclaimed the magistrate, eager at last\nto obtain some positive information.\n\n\"I saw M. Maigret. The cap was sold to a cab-driver.\"\n\n\"A cab-driver!\"\n\n\"Yes, a driver who stopped his fly before the shop and asked to be\nsupplied with a yellow-leather chauffeur's cap for one of his\ncustomers. This was the only one left. He paid for it, without\ntroubling about the size, and drove off. He was in a great hurry.\"\n\n\"What sort of fly was it?\"\n\n\"A calash.\"\n\n\"And on what day did this happen?\"\n\n\"On what day? Why, to-day, at eight o'clock this morning.\"\n\n\"This morning? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The cap was bought this morning.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible, because it was found last night in the park. If\nit was found there, it must have been there; and, consequently, it must\nhave been bought before.\"\n\n\"The hatter told me it was bought this morning.\"\n\nThere was a moment of general bewilderment. The nonplussed magistrate\nstrove to understand. Suddenly, he started, as though struck with a\ngleam of light:\n\n\"Fetch the cabman who brought us here this morning! The man who drove\nthe calash! Fetch him at once!\"\n\nThe sergeant of gendarmes and his subordinate ran off to the stables.\nIn a few minutes, the sergeant returned alone.\n\n\"Where's the cabman?\"\n\n\"He asked for food in the kitchen, ate his lunch and then--\"\n\n\"And then--?\"\n\n\"He went off.\"\n\n\"With his fly?\"\n\n\"No. Pretending that he wanted to go and see a relation at Ouville, he\nborrowed the groom's bicycle. Here are his hat and greatcoat.\"\n\n\"But did he leave bare-headed?\"\n\n\"No, he took a cap from his pocket and put it on.\"\n\n\"A cap?\"\n\n\"Yes, a yellow leather cap, it seems.\"\n\n\"A yellow leather cap? Why, no, we've got it here!\"\n\n\"That's true, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, but his is just like it.\"\n\nThe deputy sniggered:\n\n\"Very funny! Most amusing! There are two caps--One, the real one, which\nconstituted our only piece of evidence, has gone off on the head of the\nsham flyman! The other, the false one, is in your hands. Oh, the fellow\nhas had us nicely!\"\n\n\"Catch him! Fetch him back!\" cried M. Filleul. \"Two of your men on\nhorseback, Sergeant Quevillon, and at full speed!\"\n\n\"He is far away by this time,\" said the deputy.\n\n\"He can be as far as he pleases, but still we must lay hold of him.\"\n\n\"I hope so; but I think, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that your\nefforts should be concentrated here above all. Would you mind reading\nthis scrap of paper, which I have just found in the pocket of the coat?\"\n\n\"Which coat?\"\n\n\"The driver's.\"\n\nAnd the deputy prosecutor handed M. Filleul a piece of paper, folded in\nfour, containing these few words written in pencil, in a more or less\ncommon hand:\n\n\"Woe betide the young lady, if she has killed the governor!\"\n\nThe incident caused a certain stir.\n\n\"A word to the wise!\" muttered the deputy. \"We are now forewarned.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" said the examining magistrate, \"I beg you not to\nbe alarmed. Nor you either, mademoiselle. This threat is of no\nimportance, as the police are on the spot. We shall take every\nprecaution and I will answer for your safety. As for you, gentlemen. I\nrely on your discretion. You have been present at this inquiry, thanks\nto my excessive kindness toward the Press, and it would be making me an\nill return--\"\n\nHe interrupted himself, as though an idea had struck him, looked at the\ntwo young men, one after the other, and, going up to the first, asked:\n\n\"What paper do you represent, sir?\"\n\n\"The Journal de Rouen.\"\n\n\"Have you your credentials?\"\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe card was in order. There was no more to be said. M. Filleul turned\nto the other reporter:\n\n\"And you, sir?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you: what paper do you belong to?\"\n\n\"Why, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I write for a number of\npapers--all over the place--\"\n\n\"Your credentials?\"\n\n\"I haven't any.\"\n\n\"Oh! How is that?\"\n\n\"For a newspaper to give you a card, you have to be on its regular\nstaff.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I am only an occasional contributor, a free-lance. I send\narticles to this newspaper and that. They are published or declined\naccording to circumstances.\"\n\n\"In that case, what is your name? Where are your papers?\"\n\n\"My name would tell you nothing. As for papers, I have none.\"\n\n\"You have no paper of any kind to prove your profession!\"\n\n\"I have no profession.\"\n\n\"But look here, sir,\" cried the magistrate, with a certain asperity,\n\"you can't expect to preserve your incognito after introducing yourself\nhere by a trick and surprising the secrets of the police!\"\n\n\"I beg to remark, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that you asked me\nnothing when I came in, and that therefore I had nothing to say.\nBesides, it never struck me that your inquiry was secret, when\neverybody was admitted--including even one of the criminals!\"\n\nHe spoke softly, in a tone of infinite politeness. He was quite a young\nman, very tall, very slender and dressed without the least attempt at\nfashion, in a jacket and trousers both too small for him. He had a pink\nface like a girl's, a broad forehead topped with close-cropped hair,\nand a scrubby and ill-trimmed fair beard. His bright eyes gleamed with\nintelligence. He seemed not in the least embarrassed and wore a\npleasant smile, free from any shade of banter.\n\nM. Filleul looked at him with an aggressive air of distrust. The two\ngendarmes came forward. The young man exclaimed, gaily:\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, you clearly suspect me of being an\naccomplice. But, if that were so, would I not have slipped away at the\nright moment, following the example of my fellow-criminal?\"\n\n\"You might have hoped--\"\n\n\"Any hope would have been absurd. A moment's reflection, Monsieur le\nJuge d'Instruction, will make you agree with me that, logically\nspeaking--\"\n\nM. Filleul looked him straight in the eyes and said, sharply:\n\n\"No more jokes! Your name?\"\n\n\"Isidore Beautrelet.\"\n\n\"Your occupation?\"\n\n\"Sixth-form pupil at the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly.\"\n\nM. Filleul opened a pair of startled eyes.\n\n\"What are you talking about? Sixth-form pupil--\"\n\n\"At the Lycee Janson, Rue de la Pompe, number--\"\n\n\"Oh, look here,\" exclaimed M. Filleul, \"you're trying to take me in!\nThis won't do, you know; a joke can go too far!\"\n\n\"I must say, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that your astonishment\nsurprises me. What is there to prevent my being a sixth-form pupil at\nthe Lycee Janson? My beard, perhaps? Set your mind at ease: my beard is\nfalse!\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet pulled off the few curls that adorned his chin, and\nhis beardless face appeared still younger and pinker, a genuine\nschoolboy's face. And, with a laugh like a child's, revealing his white\nteeth:\n\n\"Are you convinced now?\" he asked. \"Do you want more proofs? Here, you\ncan read the address on these letters from my father: 'To Monsieur\nIsidore Beautrelet, Indoor Pupil, Lycee Janson-de-Sailly.'\"\n\nConvinced or not, M. Filleul did not look as if he liked the story. He\nasked, gruffly:\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Why--I'm--I'm improving my mind.\"\n\n\"There are schools for that: yours, for instance.\"\n\n\"You forget, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that this is the\ntwenty-third of April and that we are in the middle of the Easter\nholidays.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I have every right to spend my holidays as I please.\"\n\n\"Your father--\"\n\n\"My father lives at the other end of the country, in Savoy, and he\nhimself advised me to take a little trip on the North Coast.\"\n\n\"With a false beard?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! That's my own idea. At school, we talk a great deal about\nmysterious adventures; we read detective stories, in which people\ndisguise themselves; we imagine any amount of terrible and intricate\ncases. So I thought I would amuse myself; and I put on this false\nbeard. Besides, I enjoyed the advantage of being taken seriously and I\npretended to be a Paris reporter. That is how, last night, after an\nuneventful period of more than a week, I had the pleasure of making the\nacquaintance of my Rouen colleague; and, this morning, when he heard of\nthe Ambrumesy murder, he very kindly suggested that I should come with\nhim and that we should share the cost of a fly.\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet said all this with a frank and artless simplicity of\nwhich it was impossible not to feel the charm. M. Filleul himself,\nthough maintaining a distrustful reserve, took a certain pleasure in\nlistening to him. He asked him, in a less peevish tone:\n\n\"And are you satisfied with your expedition?\"\n\n\"Delighted! All the more as I had never been present at a case of the\nsort and I find that this one is not lacking in interest.\"\n\n\"Nor in that mysterious intricacy which you prize so highly--\"\n\n\"And which is so stimulating, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction! I know\nnothing more exciting than to see all the facts coming up out of the\nshadow, clustering together, so to speak, and gradually forming the\nprobable truth.\"\n\n\"The probable truth! You go pretty fast, young man! Do you suggest that\nyou have your little solution of the riddle ready?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" replied Beautrelet, with a laugh.\n\n\"Only--it seems to me that there are certain points on which it is not\nimpossible to form an opinion; and others, even, are so precise as to\nwarrant--a conclusion.\"\n\n\"Oh, but this is becoming very curious and I shall get to know\nsomething at last! For I confess, to my great confusion, that I know\nnothing.\"\n\n\"That is because you have not had time to reflect, Monsieur le Juge\nd'Instruction. The great thing is to reflect. Facts very seldom fail to\ncarry their own explanation!\"\n\n\"And, according to you, the facts which we have just ascertained carry\ntheir own explanation?\"\n\n\"Don't you think so yourself? In any case, I have ascertained none\nbesides those which are set down in the official report.\"\n\n\"Good! So that, if I were to ask you which were the objects stolen from\nthis room--\"\n\n\"I should answer that I know.\"\n\n\"Bravo! My gentleman knows more about it than the owner himself. M. de\nGesvres has everything accounted for: M. Isidore Beautrelet has not. He\nmisses a bookcase in three sections and a life-size statue which nobody\never noticed. And, if I asked you the name of the murderer?\"\n\n\"I should again answer that I know it.\"\n\nAll present gave a start. The deputy and the journalist drew nearer. M.\nde Gesvres and the two girls, impressed by Beautrelet's tranquil\nassurance, listened attentively.\n\n\"You know the murderer's name?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the place where he is concealed, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nM. Filleul rubbed his hands.\n\n\"What a piece of luck! This capture will do honor to my career. And can\nyou make me these startling revelations now?\"\n\n\"Yes, now--or rather, if you do not mind, in an hour or two, when I\nshall have assisted at your inquiry to the end.\"\n\n\"No, no, young man, here and now, please.\" At that moment Raymonde de\nSaint-Veran, who had not taken her eyes from Isidore Beautrelet since\nthe beginning of this scene, came up to M. Filleul:\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction--\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle?\"\n\nShe hesitated for two or three seconds, with her eyes fixed on\nBeautrelet, and then, addressing M. Filleul:\n\n\"I should like you to ask monsieur the reason why he was walking\nyesterday in the sunk road which leads up to the little door.\"\n\nIt was an unexpected and dramatic stroke. Isidore Beautrelet appeared\nnonplussed:\n\n\"I, mademoiselle? I? You saw me yesterday?\"\n\nRaymonde remained thoughtful, with her eyes upon Beautrelet, as though\nshe were trying to settle her own conviction, and then said, in a\nsteady voice:\n\n\"At four o'clock in the afternoon, as I was crossing the wood, I met in\nthe sunk road a young man of monsieur's height, dressed like him and\nwearing a beard cut in the same way--and I received a very clear\nimpression that he was trying to hide.\"\n\n\"And it was I?\"\n\n\"I could not say that as an absolute certainty, for my recollection is\na little vague. Still--still, I think so--if not, it would be an\nunusual resemblance--\"\n\nM. Filleul was perplexed. Already taken in by one of the confederates,\nwas he now going to let himself be tricked by this self-styled\nschoolboy? Certainly, the young man's manner spoke in his favor; but\none can never tell!\n\n\"What have you to say, sir?\"\n\n\"That mademoiselle is mistaken, as I can easily show you with one word.\nYesterday, at the time stated, I was at Veules.\"\n\n\"You will have to prove it, you will have to. In any case, the position\nis not what it was. Sergeant, one of your men will keep monsieur\ncompany.\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet's face denoted a keen vexation.\n\n\"Will it be for long?\"\n\n\"Long enough to collect the necessary information.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I beseech you to collect it with all\npossible speed and discretion.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"My father is an old man. We are very much attached to each other--and\nI would not have him suffer on my account.\"\n\nThe more or less pathetic note in his voice made a bad impression on M.\nFilleul. It suggested a scene in a melodrama. Nevertheless, he promised:\n\n\"This evening--or to-morrow at latest, I shall know what to think.\"\n\nThe afternoon was wearing on. The examining magistrate returned to the\nruins of the cloisters, after giving orders that no unauthorized\npersons were to be admitted, and patiently, methodically, dividing the\nground into lots which were successively explored, himself directed the\nsearch. But at the end of the day he was no farther than at the start;\nand he declared, before an army of reporters who, during that time, had\ninvaded the chateau:\n\n\"Gentlemen, everything leads us to suppose that the wounded man is\nhere, within our reach; everything, that is, except the reality, the\nfact. Therefore, in our humble opinion, he must have escaped and we\nshall find him outside.\"\n\nBy way of precaution, however, he arranged, with the sergeant of\ngendarmes, for a complete watch to be kept over the park and, after\nmaking a fresh examination of the two drawing rooms, visiting the whole\nof the chateau and surrounding himself with all the necessary\ninformation, he took the road back to Dieppe, accompanied by the deputy\nprosecutor.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nNight fell. As the boudoir was to remain locked, Jean Daval's body had\nbeen moved to another room. Two women from the neighborhood sat up with\nit, assisted by Suzanne and Raymonde. Downstairs, young Isidore\nBeautrelet slept on the bench in the old oratory, under the watchful\neye of the village policeman, who had been attached to his person.\nOutside, the gendarmes, the farmer and a dozen peasants had taken up\ntheir position among the ruins and along the walls.\n\nAll was still until eleven o'clock; but, at ten minutes past eleven, a\nshot echoed from the other side of the house.\n\n\"Attention!\" roared the sergeant. \"Two men remain here: you,\nFossier--and you, Lecanu--The others at the double!\"\n\nThey all rushed forward and ran round the house on the left. A figure\nwas seen to make away in the dark. Then, suddenly, a second shot drew\nthem farther on, almost to the borders of the farm. And, all at once,\nas they arrived, in a band, at the hedge which lines the orchard, a\nflame burst out, to the right of the farmhouse, and other names also\nrose in a thick column. It was a barn burning, stuffed to the ridge\nwith straw.\n\n\"The scoundrels!\" shouted the sergeant. \"They've set fire to it. Have\nat them, lads! They can't be far away!\"\n\nBut the wind was turning the flames toward the main building; and it\nbecame necessary, before all things, to ward off the danger. They all\nexerted themselves with the greater ardor inasmuch as M. de Gesvres,\nhurrying to the scene of the disaster, encouraged them with the promise\nof a reward. By the time that they had mastered the flames, it was two\no'clock in the morning. All pursuit would have been vain.\n\n\"We'll look into it by daylight,\" said the sergeant. \"They are sure to\nhave left traces: we shall find them.\"\n\n\"And I shall not be sorry,\" added M. de Gesvres, \"to learn the reason\nof this attack. To set fire to trusses of straw strikes me as a very\nuseless proceeding.\"\n\n\"Come with me, Monsieur le Comte: I may be able to tell you the reason.\"\n\nTogether they reached the ruins of the cloisters. The sergeant called\nout:\n\n\"Lecanu!--Fossier!\"\n\nThe other gendarmes were already hunting for their comrades whom they\nhad left standing sentry. They ended by finding them at a few paces\nfrom the little door. The two men were lying full length on the ground,\nbound and gagged, with bandages over their eyes.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" muttered the sergeant, while his men were being\nreleased; \"Monsieur le Comte, we have been tricked like children.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"The shots--the attack on the barn--the fire--all so much humbug to get\nus down there--a diversion. During that time they were tying up our two\nmen and the business was done.\"\n\n\"What business?\"\n\n\"Carrying off the wounded man, of course!\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you think--?\"\n\n\"Think? Why, it's as plain as a pikestaff! The idea came to me ten\nminutes ago--but I'm a fool not to have thought of it earlier. We\nshould have nabbed them all.\" Quevillon stamped his foot on the ground,\nwith a sudden attack of rage. \"But where, confound it, where did they\ngo through? Which way did they carry him off? For, dash it all, we beat\nthe ground all day; and a man can't hide in a tuft of grass, especially\nwhen he's wounded! It's witchcraft, that's what it is!--\"\n\nNor was this the last surprise awaiting Sergeant Quevillon. At dawn,\nwhen they entered the oratory which had been used as a cell for young\nIsidore Beautrelet, they realized that young Isidore Beautrelet had\nvanished.\n\nOn a chair slept the village policeman, bent in two. By his side stood\na water-bottle and two tumblers. At the bottom of one of those tumblers\na few grains of white powder.\n\nOn examination, it was proved, first, that young Isidore Beautrelet had\nadministered a sleeping draught to the village policeman; secondly,\nthat he could only have escaped by a window situated at a height of\nseven or eight feet in the wall; and lastly--a charming detail,\nthis--that he could only have reached this window by using the back of\nhis warder as a footstool.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nISIDORE BEAUTRELET, SIXTH-FORM SCHOOLBOY\n\n\nFrom the Grand Journal.\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\nDOCTOR DELATTRE KIDNAPPED A MAD PIECE OF CRIMINAL DARING\n\nAt the moment of going to press, we have received an item of news which\nwe dare not guarantee as authentic, because of its very improbable\ncharacter. We print it, therefore, with all reserve.\n\nYesterday evening, Dr. Delattre, the well-known surgeon, was present,\nwith his wife and daughter, at the performance of Hernani at the\nComedie Francaise. At the commencement of the third act, that is to\nsay, at about ten o'clock, the door of his box opened and a gentleman,\naccompanied by two others, leaned over to the doctor and said to him,\nin a low voice, but loud enough for Mme. Delattre to hear:\n\n\"Doctor, I have a very painful task to fulfil and I shall be very\ngrateful to you if you will make it as easy for me as you can.\"\n\n\"Who are you, sir?\"\n\n\"M. Thezard, commissary of police of the first district; and my\ninstructions are to take you to M. Dudouis, at the prefecture.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Not a word, doctor, I entreat you, not a movement--There is some\nregrettable mistake; and that is why we must act in silence and not\nattract anybody's attention. You will be back, I have no doubt, before\nthe end of the performance.\"\n\nThe doctor rose and went with the commissary. At the end of the\nperformance, he had not returned. Mme. Delattre, greatly alarmed, drove\nto the office of the commissary of police. There she found the real M.\nThezard and discovered, to her great terror, that the individual who\nhad carried off her husband was an impostor.\n\nInquiries made so far have revealed the fact that the doctor stepped\ninto a motor car and that the car drove off in the direction of the\nConcorde.\n\nReaders will find further details of this incredible adventure in our\nsecond edition.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nIncredible though it might be, the adventure was perfectly true.\nBesides, the issue was not long delayed and the Grand Journal, while\nconfirming the story in its midday edition, described in a few lines\nthe dramatic ending with which it concluded:\n\nTHE STORY ENDS\n\nAND\n\nGUESS-WORK BEGINS\n\nDr. Delattre was brought back to 78, Rue Duret, at nine o'clock this\nmorning, in a motor car which drove away immediately at full speed.\n\nNo. 78, Rue Duret, is the address of Dr. Delattre's clinical surgery,\nat which he arrives every morning at the same hour. When we sent in our\ncard, the doctor, though closeted with the chief of the detective\nservice, was good enough to consent to receive us.\n\n\"All that I can tell you,\" he said, in reply to our questions, \"is that\nI was treated with the greatest consideration. My three companions were\nthe most charming people I have ever met, exquisitely well-mannered and\nbright and witty talkers: a quality not to be despised, in view of the\nlength of the journey.\"\n\n\"How long did it take?\"\n\n\"About four hours and as long returning.\"\n\n\"And what was the object of the journey?\"\n\n\"I was taken to see a patient whose condition rendered an immediate\noperation necessary.\"\n\n\"And was the operation successful?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the consequences may be dangerous. I would answer for the\npatient here. Down there--under his present conditions--\"\n\n\"Bad conditions?\"\n\n\"Execrable!--A room in an inn--and the practically absolute\nimpossibility of being attended to.\"\n\n\"Then what can save him?\"\n\n\"A miracle--and his constitution, which is an exceptionally strong one.\"\n\n\"And can you say nothing more about this strange patient?\"\n\n\"No. In the first place, I have taken an oath; and, secondly, I have\nreceived a present of ten thousand francs for my free surgery. If I do\nnot keep silence, this sum will be taken from me.\"\n\n\"You are joking! Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do. The men all struck me as being very much in earnest.\"\n\nThis is the statement made to us by Dr. Delattre. And we know, on the\nother hand, that the head of the detective service, in spite of all his\ninsisting, has not yet succeeded in extracting any more precise\nparticulars from him as to the operation which he performed, the\npatient whom he attended or the district traversed by the car. It is\ndifficult, therefore, to arrive at the truth.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis truth, which the writer of the interview confessed himself unable\nto discover, was guessed by the more or less clear-sighted minds that\nperceived a connection with the facts which had occurred the day before\nat the Chateau d'Ambrumesy, and which were reported, down to the\nsmallest detail, in all the newspapers of that day. There was evidently\na coincidence to be reckoned with in the disappearance of a wounded\nburglar and the kidnapping of a famous surgeon.\n\nThe judicial inquiry, moreover, proved the correctness of the\nhypothesis. By following the track of the sham flyman, who had fled on\na bicycle, they were able to show that he had reached the forest of\nArques, at some ten miles' distance, and that from there, after\nthrowing his bicycle into a ditch, he had gone to the village of\nSaint-Nicolas, whence he had dispatched the following telegram:\n\n\n  A. L. N., Post-office 45, Paris.\n\n  Situation desperate. Operation urgently necessary.\n  Send celebrity by national road fourteen.\n\n\nThe evidence was undeniable. Once apprised the accomplices in Paris\nhastened to make their arrangements. At ten o'clock in the evening they\nsent their celebrity by National Road No. 14, which skirts the forest\nof Arques and ends at Dieppe. During this time, under cover of the fire\nwhich they themselves had caused, the gang of burglars carried off\ntheir leader and moved him to an inn, where the operation took place on\nthe arrival of the surgeon, at two o'clock in the morning.\n\nAbout that there was no doubt. At Pontoise, at Gournay, at Forges,\nChief-inspector Ganimard, who was sent specially from Paris, with\nInspector Folenfant, as his assistant, ascertained that a motor car had\npassed in the course of the previous night. The same on the road from\nDieppe to Ambrumesy. And, though the traces of the car were lost at\nabout a mile and a half from the chateau, at least a number of\nfootmarks were seen between the little door in the park wall and the\nabbey ruins. Besides, Ganimard remarked that the lock of the little\ndoor had been forced.\n\nSo all was explained. It remained to decide which inn the doctor had\nspoken of: an easy piece of work for a Ganimard, a professional ferret,\na patient old stager of the police. The number of inns is limited and\nthis one, given the condition of the wounded man, could only be one\nquite close to Ambrumesy. Ganimard and Sergeant Quevillon set to work.\nWithin a circle of five hundred yards, of a thousand yards, of fifteen\nhundred yards, they visited and ransacked everything that could pass\nfor an inn. But, against all expectation, the dying man persisted in\nremaining invisible.\n\nGanimard became more resolved than ever. He came back to sleep at the\nchateau, on the Saturday night, with the intention of making his\npersonal inquiry on the Sunday. On Sunday morning, he learned that,\nduring the night, a posse of gendarmes had seen a figure gliding along\nthe sunk road, outside the wall. Was it an accomplice who had come back\nto investigate? Were they to suppose that the leader of the gang had\nnot left the cloisters or the neighborhood of the cloisters?\n\nThat night, Ganimard openly sent the squad of gendarmes to the farm and\nposted himself and Folenfant outside the walls, near the little door.\n\nA little before midnight, a person passed out of the wood, slipped\nbetween them, went through the door and entered the park. For three\nhours, they saw him wander from side to side across the ruins,\nstooping, climbing up the old pillars, sometimes remaining for long\nminutes without moving. Then he went back to the door and again passed\nbetween the two inspectors.\n\nGanimard caught him by the collar, while Folenfant seized him round the\nbody. He made no resistance of any kind and, with the greatest\ndocility, allowed them to bind his wrists and take him to the house.\nBut, when they attempted to question him, he replied simply that he\nowed them no account of his doings and that he would wait for the\narrival of the examining magistrate. Thereupon, they fastened him\nfirmly to the foot of a bed, in one of the two adjoining rooms which\nthey occupied.\n\nAt nine o'clock on Monday morning, as soon as M. Filleul had arrived,\nGanimard announced the capture which he had made. The prisoner was\nbrought downstairs. It was Isidore Beautrelet.\n\n\"M. Isidore Beautrelet!\" exclaimed M. Filleul with an air of rapture,\nholding out both his hands to the newcomer. \"What a delightful\nsurprise! Our excellent amateur detective here! And at our disposal\ntoo! Why, it's a windfall!--M. Chief-inspector, allow me to introduce\nto you M. Isidore Beautrelet, a sixth-form pupil at the Lycee\nJanson-de-Sailly.\"\n\nGanimard seemed a little nonplussed. Isidore made him a very low bow,\nas though he were greeting a colleague whom he knew how to esteem at\nhis true value, and, turning to M. Filleul:\n\n\"It appears, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that you have received a\nsatisfactory account of me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly satisfactory! To begin with, you were really at\nVeules-les-Roses at the time when Mlle. de Saint-Veran thought she saw\nyou in the sunk road. I dare say we shall discover the identity of your\ndouble. In the second place, you are in very deed Isidore Beautrelet, a\nsixth-form pupil and, what is more, an excellent pupil, industrious at\nyour work and of exemplary behavior. As your father lives in the\ncountry, you go out once a month to his correspondent, M. Bernod, who\nis lavish in his praises of you.\"\n\n\"So that--\"\n\n\"So that you are free, M. Isidore Beautrelet.\"\n\n\"Absolutely free?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Oh, I must make just one little condition, all the same.\nYou can understand that I can't release a gentleman who administers\nsleeping-draughts, who escapes by the window and who is afterward\ncaught in the act of trespassing upon private property. I can't release\nhim without a compensation of some kind.\"\n\n\"I await your pleasure.\"\n\n\"Well, we will resume our interrupted conversation and you shall tell\nme how far you have advanced with your investigations. In two days of\nliberty, you must have carried them pretty far?\" And, as Ganimard was\npreparing to go, with an affectation of contempt for that sort of\npractice, the magistrate cried, \"Not at all, M. Inspector, your place\nis here--I assure you that M. Isidore Beautrelet is worth listening to.\nM. Isidore Beautrelet, according to my information, has made a great\nreputation at the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly as an observer whom nothing\nescapes; and his schoolfellows, I hear, look upon him as your\ncompetitor and a rival of Holmlock Shears!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Ganimard, ironically.\n\n\"Just so. One of them wrote to me, 'If Beautrelet declares that he\nknows, you must believe him; and, whatever he says, you may be sure\nthat it is the exact expression of the truth.' M. Isidore Beautrelet,\nnow or never is the time to vindicate the confidence of your friends. I\nbeseech you, give us the exact expression of the truth.\"\n\nIsidore listened with a smile and replied:\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, you are very cruel. You make fun of\npoor schoolboys who amuse themselves as best they can. You are quite\nright, however, and I will give you no further reason to laugh at me.\"\n\n\"The fact is that you know nothing, M. Isidore Beautrelet.\"\n\n\"Yes, I confess in all humility that I know nothing. For I do not call\nit 'knowing anything' that I happen to have hit upon two or three more\nprecise points which, I am sure, cannot have escaped you.\"\n\n\"For instance?\"\n\n\"For instance, the object of the theft.\"\n\n\"Ah, of course, you know the object of the theft?\"\n\n\"As you do, I have no doubt. In fact, it was the first thing I studied,\nbecause the task struck me as easier.\"\n\n\"Easier, really?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. At the most, it's a question of reasoning.\"\n\n\"Nothing more than that?\"\n\n\"Nothing more.\"\n\n\"And what is your reasoning?\"\n\n\"It is just this, stripped of all extraneous comment: on the one hand,\nTHERE HAS BEEN A THEFT, because the two young ladies are agreed and\nbecause they really saw two men running away and carrying things with\nthem.\"\n\n\"There has been a theft.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, NOTHING HAS DISAPPEARED, because M. de Gesvres says\nso and he is in a better position than anybody to know.\"\n\n\"Nothing has disappeared.\"\n\n\"From those two premises I arrive at this inevitable result: granted\nthat there has been a theft and that nothing has disappeared, it is\nbecause the object carried off has been replaced by an exactly similar\nobject. Let me hasten to add that possibly my argument may not be\nconfirmed by the facts. But I maintain that it is the first argument\nthat ought to occur to us and that we are not entitled to waive it\nuntil we have made a serious examination.\"\n\n\"That's true--that's true,\" muttered the magistrate, who was obviously\ninterested.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Isidore, \"what was there in this room that could\narouse the covetousness of the burglars? Two things. The tapestry\nfirst. It can't have been that. Old tapestry cannot be imitated: the\nfraud would have been palpable at once. There remain the four Rubens\npictures.\"\n\n\"What's that you say?\"\n\n\"I say that the four Rubenses on that wall are false.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"They are false a priori, inevitably and without a doubt.\"\n\n\"I tell you, it's impossible.\"\n\n\"It is very nearly a year ago, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, since a\nyoung man, who gave his name as Charpenais, came to the Chateau\nd'Ambrumesy and asked permission to copy the Rubens pictures. M. de\nGesvres gave him permission. Every day for five months Charpenais\nworked in this room from morning till dusk. The copies which he made,\ncanvases and frames, have taken the place of the four original pictures\nbequeathed to M. de Gesvres by his uncle, the Marques de Bobadilla.\"\n\n\"Prove it!\"\n\n\"I have no proof to give. A picture is false because it is false; and I\nconsider that it is not even necessary to examine these four.\"\n\nM. Filleul and Ganimard exchanged glances of unconcealed astonishment.\nThe inspector no longer thought of withdrawing. At last, the magistrate\nmuttered:\n\n\"We must have M. de Gesvres's opinion.\"\n\nAnd Ganimard agreed:\n\n\"Yes, we must have his opinion.\"\n\nAnd they sent to beg the count to come to the drawing room.\n\nThe young sixth-form pupil had won a real victory. To compel two\nexperts, two professionals like M. Filleul and Ganimard to take account\nof his surmises implied a testimony of respect of which any other would\nhave been proud. But Beautrelet seemed not to feel those little\nsatisfactions of self-conceit and, still smiling without the least\ntrace of irony, he placidly waited.\n\nM. de Gesvres entered the room.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" said the magistrate, \"the result of our inquiry\nhas brought us face to face with an utterly unexpected contingency,\nwhich we submit to you with all reserve. It is possible--I say that it\nis possible--that the burglars, when breaking into the house, had it as\ntheir object to steal your four pictures by Rubens--or, at least, to\nreplace them by four copies--copies which are said to have been made\nlast year by a painter called Charpenais. Would you be so good as to\nexamine the pictures and to tell us if you recognize them as genuine?\"\n\nThe count appeared to suppress a movement of annoyance, looked at\nIsidore Beautrelet and at M. Filleul and replied, without even\ntroubling to go near the pictures:\n\n\"I hoped, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that the truth might have\nremained unknown. As this is not so, I have no hesitation in declaring\nthat the four pictures are false.\"\n\n\"You knew it, then?\"\n\n\"From the beginning.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so?\"\n\n\"The owner of a work is never in a hurry to declare that that work is\nnot--or, rather, is no longer genuine.\"\n\n\"Still, it was the only means of recovering them.\"\n\n\"I consider that there was another and a better.\"\n\n\"Which was that?\"\n\n\"Not to make the secret known, not to frighten my burglars and to offer\nto buy back the pictures, which they must find more or less difficult\nto dispose of.\"\n\n\"How would you communicate with them?\"\n\nAs the count did not reply, Isidore answered for him:\n\n\"By means of an advertisement in the papers. The paragraph inserted in\nthe agony column of the Journal, the Echo de Paris and the Matin runs,\n'Am prepared to buy back the pictures.'\"\n\nThe count agreed with a nod. Once again, the young man was teaching his\nelders. M. Filleul showed himself a good sportsman.\n\n\"There's no doubt about it, my dear sir,\" he exclaimed. \"I'm beginning\nto think your school-fellows were not quite wrong. By Jove, what an\neye! What intuition! If this goes on, there will be nothing left for M.\nGanimard and me to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, none of this part was so very complicated!\"\n\n\"You mean to say that the rest was more so I remember, in fact, that,\nwhen we first met you seemed to know all about it. Let me see, a far as\nI recollect, you said that you knew the name of the murderer.\"\n\n\"So I do.\"\n\n\"Well, then, who killed Jean Daval? Is the man alive? Where is he\nhiding?\"\n\n\"There is a misunderstanding between us, Monsieur le Juge\nd'Instruction, or, rather, you have misunderstood the facts from the\nbeginning The murderer and the runaway are two distinct persons.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed M. Filleul. \"The man whom M. de Gesvres saw in\nthe boudoir and struggled with, the man whom the young ladies saw in\nthe drawing-room and whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran shot at, the man who\nfell in the park and whom we are looking for: do you suggest that he is\nnot the man who killed Jean Daval?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Have you discovered the traces of a third accomplice who disappeared\nbefore the arrival of the young ladies?\"\n\n\"I have not.\"\n\n\"In that case, I don't understand.--Well, who is the murderer of Jean\nDaval?\"\n\n\"Jean Daval was killed by--\"\n\nBeautrelet interrupted himself, thought for a moment and continued:\n\n\"But I must first show you the road which I followed to arrive at the\ncertainty and the very reasons of the murder--without which my\naccusation would seem monstrous to you.--And it is not--no, it is not\nmonstrous at all.--There is one detail which has passed unobserved and\nwhich, nevertheless, is of the greatest importance; and that is that\nJean Daval, at the moment when he was stabbed, had all his clothes on,\nincluding his walking boots, was dressed, in short, as a man is dressed\nin the middle of the day, with a waistcoat, collar, tie and braces. Now\nthe crime was committed at four o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"I reflected on that strange fact,\" said the magistrate, \"and M. de\nGesvres replied that Jean Daval spent a part of his nights in working.\"\n\n\"The servants say, on the contrary, that he went to bed regularly at a\nvery early hour. But, admitting that he was up, why did he disarrange\nhis bedclothes, to make believe that he had gone to bed? And, if he was\nin bed, why, when he heard a noise, did he take the trouble to dress\nhimself from head to foot, instead of slipping on anything that came to\nhand? I went to his room on the first day, while you were at lunch: his\nslippers were at the foot of the bed. What prevented him from putting\nthem on rather than his heavy nailed boots?\"\n\n\"So far, I do not see--\"\n\n\"So far, in fact, you cannot see anything, except anomalies. They\nappeared much more suspicious to me, however, when I learned that\nCharpenais the painter, the man who copied the Rubens pictures, had\nbeen introduced and recommended to the Comte de Gesvres by Jean Daval\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, from that to the conclusion that Jean Daval and Charpenais were\naccomplices required but a step. I took that step at the time of our\nconversation.\"\n\n\"A little quickly, I think.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, a material proof was wanted. Now I had discovered\nin Daval's room, on one of the sheets of the blotting-pad on which he\nused to write, this address: 'Monsieur A.L.N., Post-office 45, Paris.'\nYou will find it there still, traced the reverse way on the\nblotting-paper. The next day, it was discovered that the telegram sent\nby the sham flyman from Saint-Nicolas bore the same address: 'A.L.N.,\nPost-office 45.' The material proof existed: Jean Daval was in\ncorrespondence with the gang which arranged the robbery of the\npictures.\"\n\nM. Filleul raised no objection.\n\n\"Agreed. The complicity is established. And what conclusion do you\ndraw?\"\n\n\"This, first of all, that it was not the runaway who killed Jean Daval,\nbecause Jean Daval was his accomplice.\"\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I will ask you to remember the first\nsentence uttered by Monsieur le Comte when he recovered from fainting.\nThe sentence forms part of Mlle. de Gesvres' evidence and is in the\nofficial report: 'I am not wounded.--Daval?--Is he alive?--The knife?'\nAnd I will ask you to compare it with that part of his story, also in\nthe report, in which Monsieur le Comte describes the assault: 'The man\nleaped at me and felled me with a blow on the temple!' How could M. de\nGesvres, who had fainted, know, on waking, that Daval had been stabbed\nwith a knife?\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet did not wait for an answer to his question. It\nseemed as though he were in a hurry to give the answer himself and to\navoid all comment. He continued straightway:\n\n\"Therefore it was Jean Daval who brought the three burglars to the\ndrawing room. While he was there with the one whom they call their\nchief, a noise was heard in the boudoir. Daval opened the door.\nRecognizing M. de Gesvres, he rushed at him, armed with the knife. M.\nde Gesvres succeeded in snatching the knife from him, struck him with\nit and himself fell, on receiving a blow from the man whom the two\ngirls were to see a few minutes after.\"\n\nOnce again, M. Filleul and the inspector exchanged glances. Ganimard\ntossed his head in a disconcerted way. The magistrate said:\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte, am I to believe that this version is correct?\"\n\nM. de Gesvres made no answer.\n\n\"Come, Monsieur le Comte, your silence would allow us to suppose--I beg you\nto speak.\"\n\nReplying in a very clear voice, M. de Gesvres said:\n\n\"The version is correct in every particular.\"\n\nThe magistrate gave a start.\n\n\"Then I cannot understand why you misled the police. Why conceal an act\nwhich you were lawfully entitled to commit in defense of your life?\"\n\n\"For twenty years,\" said M. de Gesvres, \"Daval worked by my side. I\ntrusted him. If he betrayed me, as the result of some temptation or\nother, I was, at least, unwilling, for the sake of the past, that his\ntreachery should become known.\"\n\n\"You were unwilling, I agree, but you had no right to be.\"\n\n\"I am not of your opinion, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. As long as\nno innocent person was accused of the crime, I was absolutely entitled\nto refrain from accusing the man who was at the same time the culprit\nand the victim. He is dead. I consider death a sufficient punishment.\"\n\n\"But now, Monsieur le Comte, now that the truth is known, you can\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Yes. Here are two rough drafts of letters written by him to his\naccomplices. I took them from his pocket-book, a few minutes after his\ndeath.\"\n\n\"And the motive of his theft?\"\n\n\"Go to 18, Rue de la Barre, at Dieppe, which is the address of a\ncertain Mme. Verdier. It was for this woman, whom he got to know two\nyears ago, and to supply her constant need of money that Daval turned\nthief.\"\n\nSo everything was cleared up. The tragedy rose out of the darkness and\ngradually appeared in its true light.\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said M. Filluel after the count had withdrawn.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Beautrelet, gaily, \"I have said almost all that I\nhad to say.\"\n\n\"But the runaway, the wounded man?\"\n\n\"As to that, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, you know as much as I do.\nYou have followed his tracks in the grass by the cloisters--you have--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know. But, since then, his friends have removed him and\nwhat I want is a clue or two as regards that inn--\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet burst out laughing:\n\n\"The inn! The inn does not exist! It's an invention, a trick to put the\npolice on the wrong scent, an ingenious trick, too, for it seems to\nhave succeeded.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Delattre declares--\"\n\n\"Ah, that's just it!\" cried Beautrelet, in a tone of conviction. \"It is\njust because Dr. Delattre declares that we mustn't believe him. Why,\nDr. Delattre refused to give any but the vaguest details concerning his\nadventure! He refused to say anything that might compromise his\npatient's safety!--And suddenly he calls attention to an inn!--You may\nbe sure that he talked about that inn because he was told to. You may\nbe sure that the whole story which he dished up to us was dictated to\nhim under the threat of terrible reprisals. The doctor has a wife. The\ndoctor has a daughter. He is too fond of them to disobey people of\nwhose formidable power he has seen proofs. And that is why he has\nassisted your efforts by supplying the most precise clues.\"\n\n\"So precise that the inn is nowhere to be found.\"\n\n\"So precise that you have never ceased looking for it, in the face of\nall probability, and that your eyes have been turned away from the only\nspot where the man can be, the mysterious spot which he has not left,\nwhich he has been unable to leave ever since the moment when, wounded\nby Mlle. de Saint-Veran, he succeeded in dragging himself to it, like a\nbeast to its lair.\"\n\n\"But where, confound it all?--In what corner of Hades--?\"\n\n\"In the ruins of the old abbey.\"\n\n\"But there are no ruins left!--A few bits of wall!--A few broken\ncolumns!\"\n\n\"That's where he's gone to earth. Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction!\"\nshouted Beautrelet. \"That's where you will have to look for him! It's\nthere and nowhere else that you will find Arsene Lupin!\"\n\n\"Arsene Lupin!\" yelled M. Filleul, springing to his feet.\n\nThere was a rather solemn pause, amid which the syllables of the famous\nname seemed to prolong their sound. Was it possible that the vanquished\nand yet invisible adversary, whom they had been hunting in vain for\nseveral days, could really be Arsene Lupin? Arsene Lupin, caught in a\ntrap, arrested, meant immediate promotion, fortune, glory to any\nexamining magistrate!\n\nGanimard had not moved a limb. Isidore said to him:\n\n\"You agree with me, do you not, M. Inspector?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\"\n\n\"You have not doubted either, for a moment have you, that he managed\nthis business?\"\n\n\"Not for a second! The thing bears his signature. A move of Arsene\nLupin's is as different from a move made by another man as one face is\nfrom another. You have only to open your eyes.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? Do you think so?\" said M. Filleul.\n\n\"Think so!\" cried the young man. \"Look, here's one little fact: what\nare the initials under which those men correspond among themselves? 'A.\nL. N.,' that is to say, the first letter of the name Arsene and the\nfirst and last letters of the name Lupin.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Ganimard, \"nothing escapes you! Upon my word, you're a fine\nfellow and old Ganimard lays down his arms before you!\"\n\nBeautrelet flushed with pleasure and pressed the hand which the\nchief-inspector held out to him. The three men had drawn near the\nbalcony and their eyes now took in the extent of the ruins. M. Filleul\nmuttered:\n\n\"So he ought to be there.\"\n\n\"HE IS THERE,\" said Beautrelet, in a hollow voice. \"He has been there\never since the moment when he fell. Logically and practically, he could\nnot escape without being seen by Mlle. de Saint-Veran and the two\nservants.\"\n\n\"What proof have you?\"\n\n\"His accomplices have furnished the proof. On the very morning, one of\nthem disguised himself as a flyman and drove you here--\"\n\n\"To recover the cap, which would serve to identify him.\"\n\n\"Very well, but also and more particularly to examine the spot, find\nout and see for himself what had become of the 'governor.'\"\n\n\"And did he find out?\"\n\n\"I presume so, as he knew the hiding-place. And I presume that he\nbecame aware of the desperate condition of his chief, because, under\nthe impulse of his alarm, he committed the imprudence to write that\nthreat: 'Woe betide the young lady, if she has killed the governor!'\"\n\n\"But his friends were able to take him away afterward?\"\n\n\"When? Your men have never left the ruins. And where could they have\nmoved him to? At most, a few hundred yards away, for one doesn't let a\ndying man travel--and then you would have found him. No, I tell you, he\nis there. His friends would never have removed him from the safest of\nhiding-places. It was there that they brought the doctor, while the\ngendarmes were running to the fire like children.\"\n\n\"But how is he living? How will he keep alive? To keep alive you need\nfood and drink.\"\n\n\"I can't say. I don't know. But he is there, I will swear it. He is\nthere, because he can't help being there. I am as sure of it as if I\nsaw as if I touched him. He is there.\"\n\nWith his finger outstretched toward the ruins, he traced in the air a\nlittle circle which became smaller and smaller until it was only a\npoint. And that point his two companions sought desperately, both\nleaning into space, both moved by the same faith in Beautrelet and\nquivering with the ardent conviction which he had forced upon them.\nYes, Arsene Lupin was there. In theory and in fact, he was there:\nneither of them was now able to doubt it.\n\nAnd there was something impressive and tragic in knowing that the\nfamous adventurer was lying in some dark shelter, below the ground,\nhelpless, feverish and exhausted.\n\n\"And if he dies?\" asked M. Filleul, in a low voice.\n\n\"If he dies,\" said Beautrelet, \"and if his accomplices are sure of it,\nthen see to the safety of Mlle. de Saint-Veran. Monsieur le Juge\nd'Instruction, for the vengeance will be terrible.\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes later and in spite of the entreaties of M. Filleul, who\nwould gladly have made further use of this fascinating auxiliary,\nIsidore Beautrelet, whose holidays ended that day, went off by the\nDieppe Road. He stepped from the train in Paris at five o'clock and, at\neight o'clock, returned to the Lycee Janson together with his\nschoolfellows.\n\nGanimard, after a minute, but utterly useless exploration of the ruins\nof Ambrumesy, returned to Paris by the fast night-train. On reaching\nhis apartment in the Rue Pergolese, he found an express letter awaiting\nhim:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nMonsieur l'Inspecteur Principal:\n\nFinding that I had a little time to spare at the end of the day, I have\nsucceeded in collecting a few additional particulars which are sure to\ninterest you.\n\nArsene Lupin has been living in Paris for twelve months under the name\nof Etienne de Vaudreix. It is a name which you will often come across\nin the society notes or the sporting columns of the newspapers. He is a\ngreat traveler and is absent for long periods, during which, by his own\naccount, he goes hunting tigers in Bengal or blue foxes in Siberia. He\nis supposed to be in business of some kind, although nobody is able to\nsay for certain what his business is.\n\nHis present address is 38, Rue Marbeuf; and I will call your attention\nto the fact that the Rue Marbeuf is close to Post-office Number 45.\nSince Thursday the twenty-third of April, the day before the burglary\nat Ambrumesy, there has been no news at all of Etienne de Vaudreix.\n\nWith very many thanks for the kindness which you have shown me, believe\nme to be,\n   Monsieur l'Inspecteur Principal,\n       Yours sincerely,\n         ISIDORE BEAUTRELET.\n\nP.S.--Please on no account think that it cost me any great trouble to\nobtain this information. On the very morning of the crime, while M.\nFilleul was pursuing his examination before a few privileged persons, I\nhad the fortunate inspiration to glance at the runaway's cap, before\nthe sham flyman came to change it. The hatter's name was enough, as you\nmay imagine, to enable me to find the clue that led to the\nidentification of the purchaser and his address.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, Ganimard called at 36, Rue Marbeuf. After questioning\nthe concierge, he made him open the door of the ground-floor flat on\nthe right, a very comfortable apartment, elegantly furnished, in which,\nhowever, he discovered nothing beyond some cinders in the fireplace.\nTwo friends had come, four days earlier, to burn all compromising\npapers.\n\nBut, just as he was leaving, Ganimard passed the postman, who was\nbringing a letter for M. de Vaudreix. That afternoon, the public\nprosecutor was informed of the case and ordered the letter to be given\nup. It bore an American postmark and contained the following lines, in\nEnglish:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nDEAR SIR:\n\nI write to confirm the answer which I gave your representative. As soon\nas you have M. de Gesvres's four pictures in your possession, you can\nforward them as arranged.\n\nYou may add the rest, if you are able to succeed, which I doubt.\n\nAn unexpected business requires my presence in Europe and I shall reach\nParis at the same time as this letter. You will find me at the Grand\nHotel.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEPHRAIM B. HARLINGTON.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat same day, Ganimard applied for a warrant and took Mr. E. B.\nHarlington, an American citizen, to the police-station, on a charge of\nreceiving and conspiracy.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus, within the space of twenty-four hours, all the threads of the\nplot had been unraveled, thanks to the really unforeseen clues supplied\nby a schoolboy of seventeen. In twenty-four hours, what had seemed\ninexplicable became simple and clear. In twenty-four hours, the scheme\ndevised by the accomplices to save their leader was baffled; the\ncapture of Arsene Lupin, wounded and dying, was no longer in doubt, his\ngang was disorganized, the address of his establishment in Paris and\nthe name which he assumed were known and, for the first time, one of\nhis cleverest and most carefully elaborated feats was seen through\nbefore he had been able to ensure its complete execution.\n\nAn immense clamor of astonishment, admiration and curiosity arose among\nthe public. Already, the Rouen journalist, in a very able article, had\ndescribed the first examination of the sixth-form pupil, laying stress\nupon his personal charm, his simplicity of manner and his quiet\nassurance. The indiscretions of Ganimard and M. Filleul, indiscretions\nto which they yielded in spite of themselves, under an impulse that\nproved stronger than their professional pride, suddenly enlightened the\npublic as to the part played by Isidore Beautrelet in recent events. He\nalone had done everything. To him alone the merit of the victory was\ndue.\n\nThe excitement was intense. Isidore Beautrelet awoke to find himself a\nhero; and the crowd, suddenly infatuated, insisted upon the fullest\ninformation regarding its new favorite. The reporters were there to\nsupply it. They rushed to the assault of the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly,\nwaited for the day-boarders to come out after schoolhours and picked up\nall that related, however remotely, to Beautrelet. It was in this way\nthat they learned the reputation which he enjoyed among his\nschoolfellows, who called him the rival of Holmlock Shears. Thanks to\nhis powers of logical reasoning, with no further data than those which\nhe was able to gather from the papers, he had, time after time,\nproclaimed the solution of very complicated cases long before they were\ncleared up by the police.\n\nIt had become a game at the Lycee Janson to put difficult questions and\nintricate problems to Beautrelet; and it was astonishing to see with\nwhat unhesitating and analytical power and by means of what ingenious\ndeductions he made his way through the thickest darkness. Ten days\nbefore the arrest of Jorisse, the grocer, he showed what could be done\nwith the famous umbrella. In the same way, he declared from the\nbeginning, in the matter of the Saint-Cloud mystery, that the concierge\nwas the only possible murderer.\n\nBut most curious of all was the pamphlet which was found circulating\namong the boys at the school, a typewritten pamphlet signed by\nBeautrelet and manifolded to the number of ten copies. It was entitled,\nARSENE LUPIN AND HIS METHOD, SHOWING IN HOW FAR THE LATTER IS BASED\nUPON TRADITION AND IN HOW FAR ORIGINAL. FOLLOWED BY A COMPARISON\nBETWEEN ENGLISH HUMOR AND FRENCH IRONY.\n\nIt contained a profound study of each of the exploits of Arsene Lupin,\nthrowing the illustrious burglar's operations into extraordinary\nrelief, showing the very mechanism of his way of setting to work, his\nspecial tactics, his letters to the press, his threats, the\nannouncement of his thefts, in short, the whole bag of tricks which he\nemployed to bamboozle his selected victim and throw him into such a\nstate of mind that the victim almost offered himself to the plot\ncontrived against him and that everything took place, as it were, with\nhis own consent.\n\nAnd the work was so just, regarded as a piece of criticism, so\npenetrating, so lively and marked by a wit so clever and, at the same\ntime, so cruel that the lawyers at once passed over to his side, that\nthe sympathy of the crowd was summarily transferred from Lupin to\nBeautrelet and that, in the struggle engaged upon between the two, the\nschoolboy's victory was loudly proclaimed in advance.\n\nBe this as it may, both M. Filleul and the Paris public prosecutor\nseemed jealously to reserve the possibility of this victory for him. On\nthe one hand, they failed to establish Mr. Harlington's identity or to\nfurnish a definite proof of his connection with Lupin's gang.\nConfederate or not, he preserved an obstinate silence. Nay, more, after\nexamining his handwriting, it was impossible to declare that he was the\nauthor of the intercepted letter. A Mr. Harlington, carrying a small\nportmanteau and a pocket-book stuffed with bank-notes, had taken up his\nabode at the Grand Hotel: that was all that could be stated with\ncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, at Dieppe, M. Filleul lay down on the positions\nwhich Beautrelet had won for him. He did not move a step forward.\nAround the individual whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran had taken for\nBeautrelet, on the eve of the crime, the same mystery reigned as\nheretofore. The same obscurity also surrounded everything connected\nwith the removal of the four Rubens pictures. What had become of them?\nAnd what road had been taken by the motor car in which they were\ncarried off during the night?\n\nEvidence of its passing was obtained at Luneray at Yerville, at Yvetot\nand at Caudebec-en-Caux, where it must have crossed the Seine at\ndaybreak in the steam-ferry. But, when the matter came to be inquired\ninto more thoroughly, it was stated that the motor car was an uncovered\none and that it would have been impossible to pack four large pictures\ninto it unobserved by the ferryman.\n\nIt was very probably the same car; but then the question cropped up\nagain: what had become of the four Rubenses?\n\nThese were so many problems which M. Filleul unanswered. Every day, his\nsubordinates searched the quadrilateral of the ruins. Almost every day,\nhe came to direct the explorations. But between that and discovering\nthe refuge in which Lupin lay dying--if it were true that Beautrelet's\nopinion was correct--there was a gulf fixed which the worthy magistrate\ndid not seem likely to cross.\n\nAnd so it was natural that they should turn once more to Isidore\nBeautrelet, as he alone had succeeded in dispelling shadows which, in\nhis absence, gathered thicker and more impenetrable than ever. Why did\nhe not go on with the case? Seeing how far he had carried it, he\nrequired but an effort to succeed.\n\nThe question was put to him by a member of the staff of the Grand\nJournal, who had obtained admission to the Lycee Janson by assuming the\nname of Bernod, the friend of Beautrelet's father. And Isidore very\nsensibly replied:\n\n\"My dear sir, there are other things besides Lupin in this world, other\nthings besides stories about burglars and detectives. There is, for\ninstance, the thing which is known as taking one's degree. Now I am\ngoing up for my examination in July. This is May. And I don't want to\nbe plucked. What would my worthy parent say?\"\n\n\"But what would he say if you delivered Arsene Lupin into the hands of\nthe police?\"\n\n\"Tut! There's a time for everything. In the next holidays--\"\n\n\"Whitsuntide?\"\n\n\"Yes--I shall go down on Saturday the sixth of June by the first train.\"\n\n\"And, on the evening of that Saturday, Lupin will be taken.\"\n\n\"Will you give me until the Sunday?\" asked Beautrelet, laughing.\n\n\"Why delay?\" replied the journalist, quite seriously.\n\nThis inexplicable confidence, born of yesterday and already so strong,\nwas felt with regard to the young man by one and all, even though, in\nreality, events had justified it only up to a certain point. No matter,\npeople believed in him! Nothing seemed difficult to him. They expected\nfrom him what they were entitled to expect at most from some phenomenon\nof penetration and intuition, of experience and skill. That day of the\nsixth of June was made to sprawl over all the papers. On the sixth of\nJune, Isidore Beautrelet would take the fast train to Dieppe: and Lupin\nwould be arrested on the same evening.\n\n\"Unless he escapes between this and then,\" objected the last remaining\npartisans of the adventurer.\n\n\"Impossible! Every outlet is watched.\"\n\n\"Unless he has succumbed to his wounds, then,\" said the partisans, who\nwould have preferred their hero's death to his capture.\n\nAnd the retort was immediate:\n\n\"Nonsense! If Lupin were dead, his confederates would know it by now,\nand Lupin would be revenged. Beautrelet said so!\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the sixth of June came. Half a dozen journalists were looking out\nfor Isidore at the Gare Saint-Lazare. Two of them wanted to accompany\nhim on his journey. He begged them to refrain.\n\nHe started alone, therefore, in a compartment to himself. He was tired,\nthanks to a series of nights devoted to study, and soon fell asleep. He\nslept heavily. In his dreams, he had an impression that the train\nstopped at different stations and that people got in and out. When he\nawoke, within sight of Rouen, he was still alone. But, on the back of\nthe opposite seat, was a large sheet of paper, fastened with a pin to\nthe gray cloth. It bore these words:\n\n  \"Every man should mind his own business. Do you mind yours.\n  If not, you must take the consequences.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" he exclaimed, rubbing his hands with delight. \"Things are\ngoing badly in the adversary's camp. That threat is as stupid and\nvulgar as the sham flyman's. What a style! One can see that it wasn't\ncomposed by Lupin.\"\n\nThe train threaded the tunnel that precedes the old Norman city. On\nreaching the station, Isidore took a few turns on the platform to\nstretch his legs. He was about to re-enter his compartment, when a cry\nescaped him. As he passed the bookstall, he had read, in an\nabsent-minded way, the following lines on the front page of a special\nedition of the Journal de Rouen; and their alarming sense suddenly\nburst upon him:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nSTOP-PRESS NEWS\n\nWe hear by telephone from Dieppe that the Chateau d'Ambrumesy was\nbroken into last night by criminals, who bound and gagged Mlle. de\nGesvres and carried off Mlle. de Saint-Veran. Traces of blood have been\nseen at a distance of five hundred yards from the house and a scarf has\nbeen found close by, which is also stained with blood. There is every\nreason to fear that the poor young girl has been murdered.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nIsidore Beautrelet completed his journey to Dieppe without moving a\nlimb. Bent in two, with his elbows on his knees and his hands plastered\nagainst his face, he sat thinking.\n\nAt Dieppe, he took a fly. At the door of Ambrumesy, he met the\nexamining magistrate, who confirmed the horrible news.\n\n\"You know nothing more?\" asked Beautrelet.\n\n\"Nothing. I have only just arrived.\"\n\nAt that moment, the sergeant of gendarmes came up to M. Filleul and\nhanded him a crumpled, torn and discolored piece of paper, which he had\npicked up not far from the place where the scarf was found. M. Filleul\nlooked at it and gave it to Beautrelet, saying:\n\n\"I don't suppose this will help us much in our investigations.\"\n\nIsidore turned the paper over and over. It was covered with figures,\ndots and signs and presented the exact appearance reproduced below:\n\n[Illustration: drawing of an outline of paper with writing and drawing\non it--numbers, dots, some letters, signs and symbols, something like...\n\n   2.1.1..2..2.1..1..\n   1...2.2.   2.43.2..2.\n   .45..2.4...2..2.4..2\n   D DF square 19F+44triangle357triangle\n   13.53..2   ..25.2\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nTHE CORPSE\n\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, having finished all he had to do, M.\nFilluel, accompanied by M. Bredoux, his clerk, stood waiting for the\ncarriage which was to take him back to Dieppe. He seemed restless,\nnervous. Twice over, he asked:\n\n\"You haven't seen anything of young Beautrelet, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I can't say I have.\"\n\n\"Where on earth can he be? I haven't set eyes on him all day!\"\n\nSuddenly, he had an idea, handed his portfolio to Bredoux, ran round\nthe chateau and made for the ruins. Isidore Beautrelet was lying near\nthe cloisters, flat on his face, with one arm folded under his head, on\nthe ground carpeted with pine-needles. He seemed drowsing.\n\n\"Hullo, young man, what are you doing here? Are you asleep?\"\n\n\"I'm not asleep. I've been thinking.\"\n\n\"Ever since this morning?\"\n\n\"Ever since this morning.\"\n\n\"It's not a question of thinking! One must see into things first, study\nfacts, look for clues, establish connecting links. The time for\nthinking comes after, when one pieces all that together and discovers\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.--That's the usual way, the right one, I dare say.--Mine\nis different.--I think first, I try, above all, to get the general hang\nof the case, if I may so express myself. Then I imagine a reasonable\nand logical hypothesis, which fits in with the general idea. And then,\nand not before, I examine the facts to see if they agree with my\nhypothesis.\"\n\n\"That's a funny method and a terribly complicated one!\"\n\n\"It's a sure method, M. Filleul, which is more than can be said of\nyours.\"\n\n\"Come, come! Facts are facts.\"\n\n\"With your ordinary sort of adversary, yes. But, given an enemy endowed\nwith a certain amount of cunning, the facts are those which he happens\nto have selected. Take the famous clues upon which you base your\ninquiry: why, he was at liberty to arrange them as he liked. And you\nsee where that can lead you, into what mistakes and absurdities, when\nyou are dealing with a man like Arsene Lupin. Holmlock Shears himself\nfell into the trap.\"\n\n\"Arsene Lupin is dead.\"\n\n\"No matter. His gang remains and the pupils of such a master are\nmasters themselves.\"\n\nM. Filleul took Isidore by the arm and, leading him away:\n\n\"Words, young man, words. Here is something of more importance. Listen\nto me. Ganimard is otherwise engaged at this moment and will not be\nhere for a few days. On the other hand, the Comte de Gesvres has\ntelegraphed to Holmlock Shears, who has promised his assistance next\nweek. Now don't you think, young man, that it would be a feather in our\ncap if we were able to say to those two celebrities, on the day of\ntheir arrival, 'Awfully sorry, gentlemen, but we couldn't wait. The\nbusiness is done'?\"\n\nIt was impossible for M. Filleul to confess helplessness with greater\ncandor. Beautrelet suppressed a smile and, pretending not to see\nthrough the worthy magistrate, replied:\n\n\"I confess. Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, that, if I was not present\nat your inquiry just now, it was because I hoped that you would consent\nto tell me the results. May I ask what you have learned?\"\n\n\"Well, last night, at eleven o'clock, the three gendarmes whom Sergeant\nQuevillon had left on guard at the chateau received a note from the\nsergeant telling them to hasten with all speed to Ouville, where they\nare stationed. They at once rode off, and when they arrived at\nOuville--\"\n\n\"They discovered that they had been tricked, that the order was a\nforgery and that there was nothing for them to do but return to\nAmbrumesy.\"\n\n\"This they did, accompanied by Sergeant Quevillon. But they were away\nfor an hour and a half and, during this time, the crime was committed.\"\n\n\"In what circumstances?\"\n\n\"Very simple circumstances, indeed. A ladder was removed from the farm\nbuildings and placed against the second story of the chateau. A pane of\nglass was cut out and a window opened. Two men, carrying a dark\nlantern, entered Mlle. de Gesvres's room and gagged her before she\ncould cry out. Then, after binding her with cords, they softly opened\nthe door of the room in which Mlle. de Saint-Veran was sleeping. Mlle.\nde Gesvres heard a stifled moan, followed by the sound of a person\nstruggling. A moment later, she saw two men carrying her cousin, who\nwas also bound and gagged. They passed in front of her and went out\nthrough the window. Then Mlle. de Gesvres, terrified and exhausted,\nfainted.\"\n\n\"But what about the dogs? I thought M. de Gesvres had bought two almost\nwild sheep-dogs, which were let loose at night?\"\n\n\"They were found dead, poisoned.\"\n\n\"By whom? Nobody could get near them.\"\n\n\"It's a mystery. The fact remains that the two men crossed the ruins\nwithout let or hindrance and went out by the little door which we have\nheard so much about. They passed through the copsewood, following the\nline of the disused quarries. It was not until they were nearly half a\nmile from the chateau, at the foot of the tree known as the Great Oak,\nthat they stopped--and executed their purpose.\"\n\n\"If they came with the intention of killing Mlle. de Saint-Veran, why\ndidn't they murder her in her room?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Perhaps the incident that settled their determination\nonly occurred after they had left the house. Perhaps the girl succeeded\nin releasing herself from her bonds. In my opinion, the scarf which was\npicked up was used to fasten her wrists. In any case, the blow was\nstruck at the foot of the Great Oak. I have collected indisputable\nproofs--\"\n\n\"But the body?\"\n\n\"The body has not been found, but there is nothing excessively\nsurprising in that. As a matter of fact, the trail which I followed\nbrought me to the church at Varengeville and the old cemetery perched\non the top of the cliff. From there it is a sheer precipice, a fall of\nover three hundred feet to the rocks and the sea below. In a day or\ntwo, a stronger tide than usual will cast up the body on the beach.\"\n\n\"Obviously. This is all very simple.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is all very simple and doesn't trouble me in the least. Lupin\nis dead, his accomplices heard of it and, to revenge themselves, have\nkilled Mlle. de Saint-Veran. These are facts which did not even require\nchecking. But Lupin?\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"What has become of him? In all probability, his confederates removed\nhis corpse at the same time that they carried away the girl; but what\nproof have we? None at all. Any more than of his staying in the ruins,\nor of his death, or of his life. And that is the real mystery, M.\nBeautrelet. The murder of Mlle. Raymonde solves nothing. On the\ncontrary, it only complicates matters. What has been happening during\nthe past two months at the Chateau d'Ambrumesy? If we don't clear up\nthe riddle, young man, others will give us the go-by.\"\n\n\"On what day are those others coming?\"\n\n\"Wednesday--Tuesday perhaps--\"\n\nBeautrelet seemed to be making an inward calculation and then declared:\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, this is Saturday. I have to be back at\nschool on Monday evening. Well, if you will have the goodness to be\nhere at ten o'clock exactly on Monday morning, I will try to give you\nthe key to the riddle.\"\n\n\"Really, M. Beautrelet--do you think so? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I hope so, at any rate.\"\n\n\"And where are you going now?\"\n\n\"I am going to see if the facts consent to fit in with the general\ntheory which I am beginning to perceive.\"\n\n\"And if they don't fit in?\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction,\" said Beautrelet, with a laugh,\n\"then it will be their fault and I must look for others which, will\nprove more tractable. Till Monday, then?\"\n\n\"Till Monday.\"\n\nA few minutes later, M. Filleul was driving toward Dieppe, while\nIsidore mounted a bicycle which he had borrowed from the Comte de\nGesvres and rode off along the road to Yerville and Caudebec-en-Caux.\n\nThere was one point in particular on which the young man was anxious to\nform a clear opinion, because this just appeared to him to be the\nenemy's weakest point. Objects of the size of the four Rubens pictures\ncannot be juggled away. They were bound to be somewhere. Granting that\nit was impossible to find them for the moment, might one not discover\nthe road by which they had disappeared?\n\nWhat Beautrelet surmised was that the four pictures had undoubtedly\nbeen carried off in the motor car, but that, before reaching Caudebec,\nthey were transferred to another car, which had crossed the Seine\neither above Caudebec or below it. Now the first horse-boat down the\nstream was at Quillebeuf, a greatly frequented ferry and, consequently,\ndangerous. Up stream, there was the ferry-boat at La Mailleraie, a\nlarge, but lonely market-town, lying well off the main road.\n\nBy midnight, Isidore had covered the thirty-five or forty miles to La\nMailleraie and was knocking at the door of an inn by the waterside. He\nslept there and, in the morning, questioned the ferrymen.\n\nThey consulted the counterfoils in the traffic-book. No motor-car had\ncrossed on Thursday the 23rd of April.\n\n\"A horse-drawn vehicle, then?\" suggested Beautrelet. \"A cart? A van?\"\n\n\"No, not either.\"\n\nIsidore continued his inquiries all through the morning. He was on the\npoint of leaving for Quillebeuf, when the waiter of the inn at which he\nhad spent the night said:\n\n\"I came back from my thirteen days' training on the morning of which\nyou are speaking and I saw a cart, but it did not go across.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"No, they unloaded it onto a flat boat, a barge of sorts, which was\nmoored to the wharf.\"\n\n\"And where did the cart come from?\"\n\n\"Oh, I knew it at once. It belonged to Master Vatinel, the carter.\"\n\n\"And where does he live?\"\n\n\"At Louvetot.\"\n\nBeautrelet consulted his military map. The hamlet of Louvetot lay where\nthe highroad between Yvetot and Caudebec was crossed by a little\nwinding road that ran through the woods to La Mailleraie.\n\nNot until six o'clock in the evening did Isidore succeed in discovering\nMaster Vatinel, in a pothouse. Master Vatinel was one of those artful\nold Normans who are always on their guard, who distrust strangers, but\nwho are unable to resist the lure of a gold coin or the influence of a\nglass or two:\n\n\"Well, yes, sir, the men in the motor car that morning had told me to\nmeet them at five o'clock at the crossroads. They gave me four great,\nbig things, as high as that. One of them went with me and we carted the\nthings to the barge.\"\n\n\"You speak of them as if you knew them before.\"\n\n\"I should think I did know them! It was the sixth time they were\nemploying me.\"\n\nIsidore gave a start:\n\n\"The sixth time, you say? And since when?\"\n\n\"Why every day before that one, to be sure! But it was other things\nthen--great blocks of stone--or else smaller, longish ones, wrapped up\nin newspapers, which they carried as if they were worth I don't know\nwhat. Oh, I mustn't touch those on any account!--But what's the matter?\nYou've turned quite white.\"\n\n\"Nothing--the heat of the room--\"\n\nBeautrelet staggered out into the air. The joy, the surprise of the\ndiscovery made him feel giddy. He went back very quietly to\nVarengeville, slept in the village, spent an hour at the mayor's\noffices with the school-master and returned to the chateau. There he\nfound a letter awaiting him \"care of M. le Comte de Gesvres.\" It\nconsisted of a single line:\n\n\"Second warning. Hold your tongue. If not--\"\n\n\"Come,\" he muttered. \"I shall have to make up my mind and take a few\nprecautions for my personal safety. If not, as they say--\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock. He strolled about among the ruins and then lay\ndown near the cloisters and closed his eyes.\n\n\"Well, young man, are you satisfied with the results of your campaign?\"\n\nIt was M. Filleul.\n\n\"Delighted, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction.\"\n\n\"By which you mean to say--?\"\n\n\"By which I mean to say that I am prepared to keep my promise--in spite\nof this very uninviting letter.\"\n\nHe showed the letter to M. Filleul.\n\n\"Pooh! Stuff and nonsense!\" cried the magistrate. \"I hope you won't let\nthat prevent you--\"\n\n\"From telling you what I know? No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. I\nhave given my word and I shall keep it. In less than ten minutes, you\nshall know--a part of the truth.\"\n\n\"A part?\"\n\n\"Yes, in my opinion, Lupin's hiding-place does not constitute the whole\nof the problem. Far from it. But we shall see later on.\"\n\n\"M. Beautrelet, nothing that you do could astonish me now. But how were\nyou able to discover--?\"\n\n\"Oh, in a very natural way! In the letter from old man Harlington to M.\nEtienne de Vaudreix, or rather to Lupin--\"\n\n\"The intercepted letter?\"\n\n\"Yes. There is a phrase which always puzzled me. After saying that the\npictures are to be forwarded as arranged, he goes on to say, 'You may\nadd THE REST, if you are able to succeed, which I doubt.'\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"What was this 'rest'? A work of art, a curiosity? The chateau contains\nnothing of any value besides the Rubenses and the tapestries. Jewelry?\nThere is very little and what there is of it is not worth much. In that\ncase, what could it be?--On the other hand, was it conceivable that\npeople so prodigiously clever as Lupin should not have succeeded in\nadding 'the rest,' which they themselves had evidently suggested? A\ndifficult undertaking, very likely; exceptional, surprising, I dare\nsay; but possible and therefore certain, since Lupin wished it.\"\n\n\"And yet he failed: nothing has disappeared.\"\n\n\"He did not fail: something has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Yes, the Rubenses--but--\"\n\n\"The Rubenses and something besides--something which has been replaced\nby a similar thing, as in the case of the Rubenses; something much more\nuncommon, much rarer, much more valuable than the Rubenses.\"\n\n\"Well, what? You're killing me with this procrastination!\"\n\nWhile talking, the two men had crossed the ruins, turned toward the\nlittle door and were now walking beside the chapel. Beautrelet stopped:\n\n\"Do you really want to know, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction?\"\n\n\"Of course, I do.\"\n\nBeautrelet was carrying a walking-stick, a strong, knotted stick.\nSuddenly, with a back stroke of this stick, he smashed one of the\nlittle statues that adorned the front of the chapel.\n\n\"Why, you're mad!\" shouted M. Filleul, beside himself, rushing at the\nbroken pieces of the statue. \"You're mad! That old saint was an\nadmirable bit of work--\"\n\n\"An admirable bit of work!\" echoed Isidore, giving a whirl which\nbrought down the Virgin Mary.\n\nM. Filleul took hold of him round the body:\n\n\"Young man, I won't allow you to commit--\"\n\nA wise man of the East came toppling to the ground, followed by a\nmanger containing the Mother and Child. . . .\n\n\"If you stir another limb, I fire!\"\n\nThe Comte de Gesvres had appeared upon the scene and was cocking his\nrevolver. Beautrelet burst out laughing:\n\n\"That's right, Monsieur le Comte, blaze away!--Take a shot at them, as\nif you were at a fair!--Wait a bit--this chap carrying his head in his\nhands--\"\n\nSt. John the Baptist fell, shattered to pieces.\n\n\"Oh!\" shouted the count, pointing his revolver. \"You young\nvandal!--Those masterpieces!\"\n\n\"Sham, Monsieur le Comte!\"\n\n\"What? What's that?\" roared M. Filleul, wresting the Comte de Gesvres's\nweapon from him.\n\n\"Sham!\" repeated Beautrelet. \"Paper-pulp and plaster!\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! It can't be true!\"\n\n\"Hollow plaster, I tell you! Nothing at all!\"\n\nThe count stooped and picked up a sliver of a statuette.\n\n\"Look at it, Monsieur le Comte, and see for yourself: it's plaster!\nRusty, musty, mildewed plaster, made to look like old stone--but\nplaster for all that, plaster casts!--That's all that remains of your\nperfect masterpiece!--That's what they've done in just a few\ndays!-That's what the Sieur Charpenais who copied the Rubenses,\nprepared a year ago.\" He seized M. Filleul's arm in his turn. \"What do\nyou think of it, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction? Isn't it fine? Isn't\nit grand? Isn't it gorgeous? The chapel has been removed! A whole\nGothic chapel collected stone by stone! A whole population of statues\ncaptured and replaced by these chaps in stucco! One of the most\nmagnificent specimens of an incomparable artistic period confiscated!\nThe chapel, in short, stolen! Isn't it immense? Ah, Monsieur le Juge\nd'Instruction, what a genius the man is!\"\n\n\"You're allowing yourself to be carried away, M. Beautrelet.\"\n\n\"One can't be carried away too much, monsieur, when one has to do with\npeople like that. Everything above the average deserves our admiration.\nAnd this man soars above everything. There is in his flight a wealth of\nimagination, a force and power, a skill and freedom that send a thrill\nthrough me!\"\n\n\"Pity he's dead,\" said M. Filleul, with a grin. \"He'd have ended by\nstealing the towers of Notre-Dame.\"\n\nIsidore shrugged his shoulders:\n\n\"Don't laugh, monsieur. He upsets you, dead though he may be.\"\n\n\"I don't say not, I don't say not, M. Beautrelet, I confess that I feel\na certain excitement now that I am about to set eyes on him--unless,\nindeed, his friends have taken away the body.\"\n\n\"And always admitting,\" observed the Comte de Gesvres, \"that it was\nreally he who was wounded by my poor niece.\"\n\n\"It was he, beyond a doubt, Monsieur le Comte,\" declared Beautrelet;\n\"it was he, believe me, who fell in the ruins under the shot fired by\nMlle. de Saint-Veran; it was he whom she saw rise and who fell again\nand dragged himself toward the cloisters to rise again for the last\ntime--this by a miracle which I will explain to you presently--to rise\nagain for the last time and reach this stone shelter--which was to be\nhis tomb.\"\n\nAnd Beautrelet struck the threshold of the chapel with his stick.\n\n\"Eh? What?\" cried M. Filleul, taken aback. \"His tomb?--Do you think\nthat that impenetrable hiding-place--\"\n\n\"It was here--there,\" he repeated.\n\n\"But we searched it.\"\n\n\"Badly.\"\n\n\"There is no hiding-place here,\" protested M. de Gesvres. \"I know the\nchapel.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is, Monsieur le Comte. Go to the mayor's office at\nVarengeville, where they have collected all the papers that used to be\nin the old parish of Ambrumesy, and you will learn from those papers,\nwhich belong to the eighteenth century, that there is a crypt below the\nchapel. This crypt doubtless dates back to the Roman chapel, upon the\nsite of which the present one was built.\"\n\n\"But how can Lupin have known this detail?\" asked M. Filleul.\n\n\"In a very simple manner: because of the works which he had to execute\nto take away the chapel.\"\n\n\"Come, come, M. Beautrelet, you're exaggerating. He has not taken away\nthe whole chapel. Look, not one of the stones of this top course has\nbeen touched.\"\n\n\"Obviously, he cast and took away only what had a financial value: the\nwrought stones, the sculptures, the statuettes, the whole treasure of\nlittle columns and carved arches. He did not trouble about the\ngroundwork of the building itself. The foundations remain.\"\n\n\"Therefore, M. Beautrelet, Lupin was not able to make his way into the\ncrypt.\"\n\nAt that moment, M. de Gesvres, who had been to call a servant, returned\nwith the key of the chapel. He opened the door. The three men entered.\nAfter a short examination Beautrelet said:\n\n\"The flag-stones on the ground have been respected, as one might\nexpect. But it is easy to perceive that the high altar is nothing more\nthan a cast. Now, generally, the staircase leading to the crypt opens\nin front of the high altar and passes under it.\"\n\n\"What do you conclude?\"\n\n\"I conclude that Lupin discovered the crypt when working at the altar.\"\n\nThe count sent for a pickaxe and Beautrelet attacked the altar. The\nplaster flew to right and left. He pushed the pieces aside as he went\non.\n\n\"By Jove!\" muttered M. Filleul, \"I am eager to know--\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Beautrelet, whose face was pale with anguish.\n\nHe hurried his blows. And, suddenly, his pickaxe, which, until then,\nhad encountered no resistance, struck against a harder material and\nrebounded. There was a sound of something falling in; and all that\nremained of the altar went tumbling into the gap after the block of\nstone which had been struck by the pickaxe. Beautrelet bent forward. A\npuff of cold air rose to his face. He lit a match and moved it from\nside to side over the gap:\n\n\"The staircase begins farther forward than I expected, under the\nentrance-flags, almost. I can see the last steps, there, right at the\nbottom.\"\n\n\"Is it deep?\"\n\n\"Three or four yards. The steps are very high--and there are some\nmissing.\"\n\n\"It is hardly likely,\" said M. Filleul, \"that the accomplices can have\nhad time to remove the body from the cellar, when they were engaged in\ncarrying off Mlle. de Saint-Veran--during the short absence of the\ngendarmes. Besides, why should they?--No, in my opinion, the body is\nhere.\"\n\nA servant brought them a ladder. Beautrelet let it down through the\nopening and fixed it, after groping among the fallen fragments. Holding\nthe two uprights firmly:\n\n\"Will you go down, M. Filleul?\" he asked.\n\nThe magistrate, holding a candle in his hand, ventured down the ladder.\nThe Comte de Gesvres followed him and Beautrelet, in his turn, placed\nhis foot on the first rung.\n\nMechanically, he counted eighteen rungs, while his eyes examined the\ncrypt, where the glimmer of the candle struggled against the heavy\ndarkness. But, at the bottom, his nostrils were assailed by one of\nthose foul and violent smells which linger in the memory for many a\nlong day. And, suddenly, a trembling hand seized him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"B-beautrelet,\" stammered M. Filleul. \"B-beau-trelet--\"\n\nHe could not get a word out for terror.\n\n\"Come, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, compose yourself!\"\n\n\"Beautrelet--he is there--\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Yes--there was something under the big stone that broke off the\naltar--I pushed the stone--and I touched--I shall never--shall never\nforget.--\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"On this side.--Don't you notice the smell?--And then look--see.\"\n\nHe took the candle and held it towards a motionless form stretched upon\nthe ground.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Beautrelet, in a horror-stricken tone.\n\nThe three men bent down quickly. The corpse lay half-naked, lean,\nfrightful. The flesh, which had the greenish hue of soft wax, appeared\nin places through the torn clothes. But the most hideous thing, the\nthing that had drawn a cry of terror from the young man's lips, was the\nhead, the head which had just been crushed by the block of stone, the\nshapeless head, a repulsive mass in which not one feature could be\ndistinguished.\n\nBeautrelet took four strides up the ladder and fled into the daylight\nand the open air.\n\nM. Filleul found him again lying flat on the around, with his hands\nglued to his face:\n\n\"I congratulate you, Beautrelet,\" he said. \"In addition to the\ndiscovery of the hiding-place, there are two points on which I have\nbeen able to verify the correctness of your assertions. First of all,\nthe man on whom Mlle. de Saint-Veran fired was indeed Arsene Lupin, as\nyou said from the start. Also, he lived in Paris under the name of\nEtienne de Vaudreix. His linen is marked with the initials E. V. That\nought to be sufficient proof, I think: don't you?\"\n\nIsidore did not stir.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte has gone to have a horse put to. They're sending for\nDr. Jouet, who will make the usual examination. In my opinion, death\nmust have taken place a week ago, at least. The state of decomposition\nof the corpse--but you don't seem to be listening--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"What I say is based upon absolute reasons. Thus, for instance--\"\n\nM. Filleul continued his demonstrations, without, however, obtaining\nany more manifest marks of attention. But M. de Gesvres's return\ninterrupted his monologue. The comte brought two letters. One was to\ntell him that Holmlock Shears would arrive next morning.\n\n\"Capital!\" cried M. Filleul, joyfully. \"Inspector Ganimard will be here\ntoo. It will be delightful.\"\n\n\"The other letter is for you, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction,\" said the\ncomte.\n\n\"Better and better,\" said M. Filleul, after reading it. \"There will\ncertainly not be much for those two gentlemen to do. M. Beautrelet, I\nhear from Dieppe that the body of a young woman was found by some\nshrimpers, this morning, on the rocks.\"\n\nBeautrelet gave a start:\n\n\"What's that? The body--\"\n\n\"Of a young woman.--The body is horribly mutilated, they say, and it\nwould be impossible to establish the identity, but for a very narrow\nlittle gold curb-bracelet on the right arm which has become encrusted\nin the swollen skin. Now Mlle. de Saint-Veran used to wear a gold\ncurb-bracelet on her right arm. Evidently, therefore, Monsieur le\nComte, this is the body of your poor niece, which the sea must have\nwashed to that distance. What do you think, Beautrelet?\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing--or, rather, yes--everything is connected, as you\nsee--and there is no link missing in my argument. All the facts, one\nafter the other, however contradictory, however disconcerting they may\nappear, end by supporting the supposition which I imagined from the\nfirst.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"You soon will. Remember, I promised you the whole truth.\"\n\n\"But it seems to me--\"\n\n\"A little patience, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. So far, you have\nhad no cause to complain of me. It is a fine day. Go for a walk, lunch\nat the chateau, smoke your pipe. I shall be back by four o'clock. As\nfor my school, well, I don't care: I shall take the night train.\"\n\nThey had reached the out-houses at the back of the chateau. Beautrelet\njumped on his bicycle and rode away.\n\nAt Dieppe, he stopped at the office of the local paper, the Vigie, and\nexamined the file for the last fortnight. Then he went on to the\nmarket-town of Envermeu, six or seven miles farther. At Envermeu, he\ntalked to the mayor, the rector and the local policeman. The\nchurch-clock struck three. His inquiry was finished.\n\nHe returned singing for joy. He pressed upon the two pedals turn by\nturn, with an equal and powerful rhythm; his chest opened wide to take\nin the keen air that blew from the sea. And, from time to time, he\nforgot himself to the extent of uttering shouts of triumph to the sky,\nwhen he thought of the aim which he was pursuing and of the success\nthat was crowning his efforts.\n\nAmbrumesy appeared in sight. He coasted at full speed down the slope\nleading to the chateau. The top rows of venerable trees that line the\nroad seemed to run to meet him and to vanish behind him forthwith. And,\nall at once, he uttered a cry. In a sudden vision, he had seen a rope\nstretched from one tree to another, across the road.\n\nHis machine gave a jolt and stopped short. Beautrelet was flung three\nyards forward, with immense violence, and it seemed to him that only\nchance, a miraculous chance, caused him to escape a heap of pebbles on\nwhich, logically, he ought to have broken his head.\n\nHe lay for a few seconds stunned. Then, all covered with bruises, with\nthe skin flayed from his knees, he examined the spot. On the right lay\na small wood, by which his aggressor had no doubt fled. Beautrelet\nuntied the rope. To the tree on the left around which it was fastened a\nsmall piece of paper was fixed with string. Beautrelet unfolded it and\nread:\n\n\"The third and last warning.\"\n\nHe went on to the chateau, put a few questions to the servants and\njoined the examining magistrate in a room on the ground floor, at the\nend of the right wing, where M. Filleul used to sit in the course of\nhis operations. M. Filleul was writing, with his clerk seated opposite\nto him. At a sign from him, the clerk left the room; and the magistrate\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Why, what have you been doing to yourself, M. Beautrelet? Your hands\nare covered with blood.\"\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing,\" said the young man. \"Just a fall\noccasioned by this rope, which was stretched in front of my bicycle. I\nwill only ask you to observe that the rope comes from the chateau. Not\nlonger than twenty minutes ago, it was being used to dry linen on,\noutside the laundry.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say so!\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, I am being watched here, by some one\nin the very heart of the place, who can see me, who can hear me and\nwho, minute by minute, observes my actions and knows my intentions.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. It is for you to discover him and you will have no\ndifficulty in that. As for myself, I want to have finished and to give\nyou the promised explanations. I have made faster progress than our\nadversaries expected and I am convinced that they mean to take vigorous\nmeasures on their side. The circle is closing around me. The danger is\napproaching. I feel it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Beautrelet--\"\n\n\"You wait and see! For the moment, let us lose no time. And, first, a\nquestion on a point which I want to have done with at once. Have you\nspoken to anybody of that document which Sergeant Quevillon picked up\nand handed you in my presence?\"\n\n\"No, indeed; not to a soul. But do you attach any value--?\"\n\n\"The greatest value. It's an idea of mine, an idea, I confess, which\ndoes not rest upon a proof of any kind--for, up to the present, I have\nnot succeeded in deciphering the document. And therefore I am\nmentioning it--so that we need not come back to it.\"\n\nBeautrelet pressed his hand on M. Filleul's and whispered:\n\n\"Don't speak--there's some one listening--outside--\"\n\nThe gravel creaked. Beautrelet ran to the window and leaned out:\n\n\"There's no one there--but the border has been trodden down--we can\neasily identify the footprints--\"\n\nHe closed the window and sat down again:\n\n\"You see, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, the enemy has even ceased to\ntake the most ordinary precautions--he has not time left--he too feels\nthat the hour is urgent. Let us be quick, therefore, and speak, since\nthey do not wish us to speak.\"\n\nHe laid the document on the table and held it in position, unfolded:\n\n\"One observation, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction, to begin with. The\npaper consists almost entirely of dots and figures. And in the first\nthree lines and the fifth--the only ones with which we have to do at\npresent, for the fourth seems to present an entirely different\ncharacter--not one of those figures is higher than the figure 5. There\nis, therefore, a great chance that each of these figures represents one\nof the five vowels, taken in alphabetical order. Let us put down the\nresult.\"\n\nHe wrote on a separate piece of paper:\n\n  E . A . A . . E . . E . A . . A . .\n   A . . . E . E .      . E OI . E . . E .\n   . OU . . E . O . . . E . . E . O . . E\n   AI . UI . . E           . . EU . E\n\n\nThen he continued:\n\n\"As you see, this does not give us much to go upon. The key is, at the\nsame time, very easy, because the inventor has contented himself with\nreplacing the vowels by figures and the consonants by dots, and very\ndifficult, if not impossible, because he has taken no further trouble\nto complicate the problem.\"\n\n\"It is certainly pretty obscure.\"\n\n\"Let us try to throw some light upon it. The second line is divided\ninto two parts; and the second part appears in such a way that it\nprobably forms one word. If we now seek to replace the intermediary\ndots by consonants, we arrive at the conclusion, after searching and\ncasting about, that the only consonants which are logically able to\nsupport the vowels are also logically able to produce only one word,\nthe word DEMOISELLES.\"\n\n\"That would refer to Mlle. de Gesvres and Mlle. de Saint-Veran.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"And do you see nothing more?\"\n\n\"Yes. I also note an hiatus in the middle of the last line; and, if I\napply a similar operation to the beginning of the line, I at once see\nthat the only consonant able to take the place of the dot between the\ndiphthongs FAI and UI is the letter G and that, when I have thus formed\nthe first five letters of the word, AIGUI, it is natural and inevitable\nthat, with the two next dots and the final E, I should arrive at the\nword AIGUILLE.\"\n\n\"Yes, the word AIGUILLE forces itself upon us.\"\n\n\"Finally, for the last word, I have three vowels and three consonants.\nI cast about again, I try all the letters, one after the other, and,\nstarting with the principle that the two first letters are necessary\nconsonants, I find that three words apply: F*EUVE, PREUVE and CREUSE. I\neliminate the words F*EUVE and PREUVE, as possessing no possible\nrelation to a needle, and I keep the word CREUSE.\"\n\n\"Making 'hollow needle'! By jove! I admit that your solution is\ncorrect, because it needs must be; but how does it help us?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Beautrelet, in a thoughtful tone. \"Not at all, for\nthe moment.--Later on, we shall see.--I have an idea that a number of\nthings are included in the puzzling conjunction of those two words,\nAIGUILLE CREUSE. What is troubling me at present is rather the material\non which the document is written, the paper employed.--Do they still\nmanufacture this sort of rather coarse-grained parchment? And then this\nivory color.--And those folds--the wear of those folds--and, lastly,\nlook, those marks of red sealing-wax, on the back--\"\n\nAt that moment Beautrelet, was interrupted by Bredoux, the magistrate's\nclerk, who opened the door and announced the unexpected arrival of the\nchief public prosecutor. M. Filleul rose:\n\n\"Anything new? Is Monsieur le Procureur General downstairs?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur le Juge d'Instruction. Monsieur le Procureur General has\nnot left his carriage. He is only passing through Ambrumesy and begs\nyou to be good enough to go down to him at the gate. He only has a word\nto say to you.\"\n\n\"That's curious,\" muttered M. Filleul. \"However--we shall see. Excuse\nme, Beautrelet, I shan't be long.\"\n\nHe went away. His footsteps sounded outside. Then the clerk closed the\ndoor, turned the key and put it in his pocket.\n\n\"Hullo!\" exclaimed Beautrelet, greatly surprised. \"What are you locking\nus in for?\"\n\n\"We shall be able to talk so much better,\" retorted Bredoux.\n\nBeautrelet rushed toward another door, which led to the next room. He\nhad understood: the accomplice was Bredoux, the clerk of the examining\nmagistrate himself. Bredoux grinned:\n\n\"Don't hurt your fingers, my young friend. I have the key of that door,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"There's the window!\" cried Beautrelet.\n\n\"Too late,\" said Bredoux, planting himself in front of the casement,\nrevolver in hand.\n\nEvery chance of retreat was cut off. There was nothing more for Isidore\nto do, nothing except to defend himself against the enemy who was\nrevealing himself with such brutal daring. He crossed his arms.\n\n\"Good,\" mumbled the clerk. \"And now let us waste no time.\" He took out\nhis watch. \"Our worthy M. Filleul will walk down to the gate. At the\ngate, he will find nobody, of course: no more public prosecutor than my\neye. Then he will come back. That gives us about four minutes. It will\ntake me one minute to escape by this window, clear through the little\ndoor by the ruins and jump on the motor cycle waiting for me. That\nleaves three minutes, which is just enough.\"\n\nBredoux was a queer sort of misshapen creature, who balanced on a pair\nof very long spindle-legs a huge trunk, as round as the body of a\nspider and furnished with immense arms. A bony face and a low, small\nstubborn forehead pointed to the man's narrow obstinacy.\n\nBeautrelet felt a weakness in the legs and staggered. He had to sit\ndown:\n\n\"Speak,\" he said. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"The paper. I've been looking for it for three days.\"\n\n\"I haven't got it.\"\n\n\"You're lying. I saw you put it back in your pocket-book when I came\nin.\"\n\n\"Next?\"\n\n\"Next, you must undertake to keep quite quiet. You're annoying us.\nLeave us alone and mind your own business. Our patience is at an end.\"\n\nHe had come nearer, with the revolver still aimed at the young man's\nhead, and spoke in a hollow voice, with a powerful stress on each\nsyllable that he uttered. His eyes were hard, his smile cruel.\n\nBeautrelet gave a shudder. It was the first time that he was\nexperiencing the sense of danger. And such danger! He felt himself in\nthe presence of an implacable enemy, endowed with blind and\nirresistible strength.\n\n\"And next?\" he asked, with less assurance in his voice.\n\n\"Next? Nothing.--You will be free.--We will forget--\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then Bredoux resumed:\n\n\"There is only a minute left. You must make up your mind. Come, old\nchap, don't be a fool.--We are the stronger, you know, always and\neverywhere.--Quick, the paper--\"\n\nIsidore did not flinch. With a livid and terrified face, he remained\nmaster of himself, nevertheless, and his brain remained clear amid the\nbreakdown of his nerves. The little black hole of the revolver was\npointing at six inches from his eyes. The finger was bent and obviously\npressing on the trigger. It only wanted a moment--\n\n\"The paper,\" repeated Bredoux. \"If not--\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Beautrelet.\n\nHe took out his pocket-book and handed it to the clerk, who seized it\neagerly.\n\n\"Capital! We've come to our senses. I've no doubt there's something to\nbe done with you.--You're troublesome, but full of common sense. I'll\ntalk about it to my pals. And now I'm off. Good-bye!\"\n\nHe pocketed his revolver and turned back the fastening of the window.\nThere was a noise in the passage.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said again. \"I'm only just in time.\"\n\nBut the idea stopped him. With a quick movement, he examined the\npocket-book:\n\n\"Damn and blast it!\" He grated through his teeth. \"The paper's not\nthere.--You've done me--\"\n\nHe leaped into the room. Two shots rang out. Isidore, in his turn, had\nseized his pistol and fired.\n\n\"Missed, old chap!\" shouted Bredoux. \"Your hand's shaking.--You're\nafraid--\"\n\nThey caught each other round the body and came down to the floor\ntogether. There was a violent and incessant knocking at the door.\nIsidore's strength gave way and he was at once over come by his\nadversary. It was the end. A hand was lifted over him, armed with a\nknife, and fell. A fierce pain burst into his shoulder. He let go.\n\nHe had an impression of some one fumbling in the inside pocket of his\njacket and taking the paper from it. Then, through the lowered veil of\nhis eyelids, he half saw the man stepping over the window-sill.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same newspapers which, on the following morning, related the last\nepisodes that had occurred at the Chateau d'Ambrumesy--the trickery at\nthe chapel, the discovery of Arsene Lupin's body and of Raymonde's body\nand, lastly, the murderous attempt made upon Beautrelet by the clerk to\nthe examining magistrate--also announced two further pieces of news:\nthe disappearance of Ganimard, and the kidnapping of Holmlock Shears,\nin broad daylight, in the heart of London, at the moment when he was\nabout to take the train for Dover.\n\nLupin's gang, therefore, which had been disorganized for a moment by\nthe extraordinary ingenuity of a seventeen-year-old schoolboy, was now\nresuming the offensive and was winning all along the line from the\nfirst. Lupin's two great adversaries, Shears and Ganimard, were put\naway. Isidore Beautrelet was disabled. The police were powerless. For\nthe moment there was no one left capable of struggling against such\nenemies.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\n\nOne evening, five weeks later, I had given my man leave to go out. It\nwas the day before the 14th of July. The night was hot, a storm\nthreatened and I felt no inclination to leave the flat. I opened wide\nthe glass doors leading to my balcony, lit my reading lamp and sat down\nin an easy-chair to look through the papers, which I had not yet seen.\n\nIt goes without saying that there was something about Arsene Lupin in\nall of them. Since the attempt at murder of which poor Isidore\nBeautrelet had been the victim, not a day had passed without some\nmention of the Ambrumesy mystery. It had a permanent headline devoted\nto it. Never had public opinion been excited to that extent, thanks to\nthe extraordinary series of hurried events, of unexpected and\ndisconcerting surprises. M. Filleul, who was certainly accepting the\nsecondary part allotted to him with a good faith worthy of all praise,\nhad let the interviewers into the secret of his young advisor's\nexploits during the memorable three days, so that the public was able\nto indulge in the rashest suppositions. And the public gave itself free\nscope. Specialists and experts in crime, novelists and playwrights,\nretired magistrates and chief-detectives, erstwhile Lecocqs and budding\nHolmlock Shearses, each had his theory and expounded it in lengthy\ncontributions to the press. Everybody corrected and supplemented the\ninquiry of the examining magistrate; and all on the word of a child, on\nthe word of Isidore Beautrelet, a sixth-form schoolboy at the Lycee\nJanson-de-Sailly!\n\nFor really, it had to be admitted, the complete elements of the truth\nwere now in everybody's possession. What did the mystery consist of?\nThey knew the hiding-place where Arsene Lupin had taken refuge and lain\na-dying; there was no doubt about it: Dr. Delattre, who continued to\nplead professional secrecy and refused to give evidence, nevertheless\nconfessed to his intimate friends--who lost no time in blabbing--that\nhe really had been taken to a crypt to attend a wounded man whom his\nconfederates introduced to him by the name of Arsene Lupin. And, as the\ncorpse of Etienne de Vaudreix was found in that same crypt and as the\nsaid Etienne de Vaudreix was none other than Arsene Lupin--as the\nofficial examination went to show--all this provided an additional\nproof, if one were needed, of the identity of Arsene Lupin and the\nwounded man. Therefore, with Lupin dead and Mlle. de Saint-Veran's body\nrecognized by the curb-bracelet on her wrist, the tragedy was finished.\n\nIt was not. Nobody thought that it was, because Beautrelet had said the\ncontrary. Nobody knew in what respect it was not finished, but, on the\nword of the young man, the mystery remained complete. The evidence of\nthe senses did not prevail against the statement of a Beautrelet. There\nwas something which people did not know, and of that something they\nwere convinced that he was in position to supply a triumphant\nexplanation.\n\nIt is easy, therefore, to imagine the anxiety with which, at first,\npeople awaited the bulletins issued by the two Dieppe doctors to whose\ncare the Comte de Gesvres entrusted his patient; the distress that\nprevailed during the first few days, when his life was thought to be in\ndanger; and the enthusiasm of the morning when the newspapers announced\nthat there was no further cause for fear. The least details excited the\ncrowd. People wept at the thought of Beautrelet nursed by his old\nfather, who had been hurriedly summoned by telegram, and they also\nadmired the devotion of Mlle. Suzanne de Gesvres, who spent night after\nnight by the wounded lad's bedside.\n\nNext came a swift and glad convalescence. At last, the public were\nabout to know! They would know what Beautrelet had promised to reveal\nto M. Filleul and the decisive words which the knife of the would-be\nassassin had prevented him from uttering! And they would also know\neverything, outside the tragedy itself, that remained impenetrable or\ninaccessible to the efforts of the police.\n\nWith Beautrelet free and cured of his wound, one could hope for some\ncertainty regarding Harlington, Arsene Lupin's mysterious accomplice,\nwho was still detained at the Sante prison. One would learn what had\nbecome, after the crime, of Bredoux the clerk, that other accomplice,\nwhose daring was really terrifying.\n\nWith Beautrelet free, one could also form a precise idea concerning the\ndisappearance of Ganimard and the kidnapping of Shears. How was it\npossible for two attempts of this kind to take place? Neither the\nEnglish detectives nor their French colleagues possessed the slightest\nclue on the subject. On Whit-Sunday, Ganimard did not come home, nor on\nthe Monday either, nor during the five weeks that followed. In London,\non Whit-Monday, Holmlock Shears took a cab at eight o'clock in the\nevening to drive to the station. He had hardly stepped in, when he\ntried to alight, probably feeling a presentiment of danger. But two men\njumped into the hansom, one on either side, flung him back on the seat\nand kept him there between them, or rather under them. All this\nhappened in sight of nine or ten witnesses, who had no time to\ninterfere. The cab drove off at a gallop. And, after that, nothing.\nNobody knew anything.\n\nPerhaps, also, Beautrelet would be able to give the complete\nexplanation of the document, the mysterious paper to which. Bredoux,\nthe magistrate's clerk, attached enough importance to recover it, with\nblows of the knife, from the person in whose possession it was. The\nproblem of the Hollow Needle it was called, by the countless solvers of\nriddles who, with their eyes bent upon the figures and dots, strove to\nread a meaning into them. The Hollow Needle! What a bewildering\nconjunction of two simple words! What an incomprehensible question was\nset by that scrap of paper, whose very origin and manufacture were\nunknown! The Hollow Needle! Was it a meaningless expression, the puzzle\nof a schoolboy scribbling with pen and ink on the corner of a page? Or\nwere they two magic words which could compel the whole great adventure\nof Lupin the great adventurer to assume its true significance? Nobody\nknew.\n\nBut the public soon would know. For some days, the papers had been\nannouncing the approaching arrival of Beautrelet. The struggle was on\nthe point of recommencing; and, this time, it would be implacable on\nthe part of the young man, who was burning to take his revenge. And, as\nit happened, my attention, just then, was drawn to his name, printed in\ncapitals. The Grand Journal headed its front page with the following\nparagraph:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nWE HAVE PERSUADED\n\nM. ISIDORE BEAUTRELET\n\nTO GIVE US THE FIRST RIGHT OF PRINTING HIS REVELATIONS. TO-MORROW,\nTUESDAY, BEFORE THE POLICE THEMSELVES ARE INFORMED, THE Grand Journal\nWILL PUBLISH THE WHOLE TRUTH OF THE AMBRUMESY MYSTERY.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's interesting, eh? What do you think of it, my dear chap?\"\n\nI started from my chair. There was some one sitting beside me, some one\nI did not know. I cast my eyes round for a weapon. But, as my visitor's\nattitude appeared quite inoffensive, I restrained myself and went up to\nhim.\n\nHe was a young man with strongly-marked features, long, fair hair and a\nshort, tawny beard, divided into two points. His dress suggested the\ndark clothes of an English clergyman; and his whole person, for that\nmatter, wore an air of austerity and gravity that inspired respect.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked. And, as he did not reply, I repeated, \"Who are\nyou? How did you get in? What are you here for?\"\n\nHe looked at me and said:\n\n\"Don't you know me?\"\n\n\"No--no!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's really curious! Just search your memory--one of your\nfriends--a friend of a rather special kind--however--\"\n\nI caught him smartly by the arm:\n\n\"You lie! You lie! No, you're not the man you say you are--it's not\ntrue.\"\n\n\"Then why are you thinking of that man rather than another?\" he asked,\nwith a laugh.\n\nOh, that laugh! That bright and clear young laugh, whose amusing irony\nhad so often contributed to my diversion! I shivered. Could it be?\n\n\"No, no,\" I protested, with a sort of terror. \"It cannot be.\"\n\n\"It can't be I, because I'm dead, eh?\" he retorted. \"And because you\ndon't believe in ghosts.\" He laughed again. \"Am I the sort of man who\ndies? Do you think I would die like that, shot in the back by a girl?\nReally, you misjudge me! As though I would ever consent to such a death\nas that!\"\n\n\"So it is you!\" I stammered, still incredulous and yet greatly excited.\n\"So it is you! I can't manage to recognize you.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" he said, gaily, \"I am quite easy. If the only man to\nwhom I have shown myself in my real aspect fails to know me to-day,\nthen everybody who will see me henceforth as I am to-day is bound not\nto know me either, when he sees me in my real aspect--if, indeed, I\nhave a real aspect--\"\n\nI recognized his voice, now that he was no longer changing its tone,\nand I recognized his eyes also and the expression of his face and his\nwhole attitude and his very being, through the counterfeit appearance\nin which he had shrouded it:\n\n\"Arsene Lupin!\" I muttered.\n\n\"Yes, Arsene Lupin!\" he cried, rising from his chair. \"The one and only\nArsene Lupin, returned from the realms of darkness, since it appears\nthat I expired and passed away in a crypt! Arsene Lupin, alive and\nkicking, in the full exercise of his will, happy and free and more than\never resolved to enjoy that happy freedom in a world where hitherto he\nhas received nothing but favors and privileges!\"\n\nIt was my turn to laugh:\n\n\"Well, it's certainly you, and livelier this time than on the day when\nI had the pleasure of seeing you, last year--I congratulate you.\"\n\nI was alluding to his last visit, the visit following on the famous\nadventure of the diadem,[1] his interrupted marriage, his flight with\nSonia Kirchnoff and the Russian girl's horrible death. On that day, I\nhad seen an Arsene Lupin whom I did not know, weak, down-hearted, with\neyes tired with weeping, seeking for a little sympathy and affection.\n\n\n[1] Arsene Lupin, play in three acts and four scenes, by Maurice\nLeblanc and Francis de Croisset.\n\n\n\"Be quiet,\" he said. \"The past is far away.\"\n\n\"It was a year ago,\" I observed.\n\n\"It was ten years ago,\" he declared. \"Arsene Lupin's years count for\nten times as much as another man's.\"\n\nI did not insist and, changing the conversation:\n\n\"How did you get in?\"\n\n\"Why, how do you think? Through the door, of course. Then, as I saw\nnobody, I walked across the drawing room and out by the balcony, and\nhere I am.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the key of the door--?\"\n\n\"There are no doors for me, as you know. I wanted your flat and I came\nin.\"\n\n\"It is at your disposal. Am I to leave you?\"\n\n\"Oh, not at all! You won't be in the way. In fact, I can promise you an\ninteresting evening.\"\n\n\"Are you expecting some one?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have given him an appointment here at ten o'clock.\" He took out\nhis watch. \"It is ten now. If the telegram reached him, he ought to be\nhere soon.\"\n\nThe front-door bell rang.\n\n\"What did I tell you? No, don't trouble to get up: I'll go.\"\n\nWith whom on earth could he have made an appointment? And what sort of\nscene was I about to assist at: dramatic or comic? For Lupin himself to\nconsider it worthy of interest, the situation must be somewhat\nexceptional.\n\nHe returned in a moment and stood back to make way for a young man,\ntall and thin and very pale in the face.\n\nWithout a word and with a certain solemnity about his movements that\nmade me feel ill at ease. Lupin switched on all the electric lamps, one\nafter the other, till the room was flooded with light. Then the two men\nlooked at each other, exchanged profound and penetrating glances, as\nif, with all the effort of their gleaming eyes, they were trying to\npierce into each other's souls.\n\nIt was an impressive sight to see them thus, grave and silent. But who\ncould the newcomer be?\n\nI was on the point of guessing the truth, through his resemblance to a\nphotograph which had recently appeared in the papers, when Lupin turned\nto me:\n\n\"My dear chap, let me introduce M. Isidore Beautrelet.\" And, addressing\nthe young man, he continued, \"I have to thank you, M. Beautrelet,\nfirst, for being good enough, on receipt of a letter from me, to\npostpone your revelations until after this interview and, secondly, for\ngranting me this interview with so good a grace.\"\n\nBeautrelet smiled:\n\n\"Allow me to remark that my good grace consists, above all, in obeying\nyour orders. The threat which you made to me in the letter in question\nwas the more peremptory in being aimed not at me, but at my father.\"\n\n\"My word,\" said Lupin laughing, \"we must do the best we can and make\nuse of the means of action vouchsafed to us. I knew by experience that\nyour own safety was indifferent to you, seeing that you resisted the\narguments of Master Bredoux. There remained your father--your father\nfor whom you have a great affection--I played on that string.\"\n\n\"And here I am,\" said Beautrelet, approvingly.\n\nI motioned them to be seated. They consented and Lupin resumed, in that\ntone of imperceptible banter which is all his own:\n\n\"In any case, M. Beautrelet, if you will not accept my thanks, you will\nat least not refuse my apologies.\"\n\n\"Apologies! Bless my soul, what for?\"\n\n\"For the brutality which Master Bredoux showed you.\"\n\n\"I confess that the act surprised me. It was not Lupin's usual way of\nbehaving. A stab--\"\n\n\"I assure you I had no hand in it. Bredoux is a new recruit. My\nfriends, during the time that they had the management of our affairs,\nthought that it might be useful to win over to our cause the clerk of\nthe magistrate himself who was conducting the inquiry.\"\n\n\"Your friends were right.\"\n\n\"Bredoux, who was specially attached to your person, was, in fact, most\nvaluable to us. But, with the ardor peculiar to any neophyte who wishes\nto distinguish himself, he pushed his zeal too far and thwarted my\nplans by permitting himself, on his own initiative, to strike you a\nblow.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was a little accident!\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all! And I have reprimanded him severely! I am\nbound, however, to say in his favor that he was taken unawares by the\nreally unexpected rapidity of your investigation. If you had only left\nus a few hours longer, you would have escaped that unpardonable\nattempt.\"\n\n\"And I should doubtless have enjoyed the enormous advantage of\nundergoing the same fate as M. Ganimard and Mr. Holmlock Shears?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lupin, laughing heartily. \"And I should not have known\nthe cruel terrors which your wound caused me. I have had an atrocious\ntime because of it, believe me, and, at this moment, your pallor fills\nme with all the stings of remorse. Can you ever forgive me?\"\n\n\"The proof of confidence which you have shown me in delivering yourself\nunconditionally into my hands--it would have been so easy for me to\nbring a few of Ganimard's friends with me--that proof of confidence\nwipes out everything.\"\n\nWas he speaking seriously? I confess frankly that I was greatly\nperplexed. The struggle between the two men was beginning in a manner\nwhich I was simply unable to understand. I had been present at the\nfirst meeting between Lupin and Holmlock Shears, in the cafe near the\nGare Montparnesse,[2] and I could not help recalling the haughty\ncarriage of the two combatants, the terrific clash of their pride under\nthe politeness of their manners, the hard blows which they dealt each\nother, their feints, their arrogance.\n\n\n[2] Arsene Lupin versus Holmlock Shears, by Maurice Leblanc.\n\n\nHere, it was quite different. Lupin, it is true, had not changed; he\nexhibited the same tactics, the same crafty affability. But what a\nstrange adversary he had come upon! Was it even an adversary? Really,\nhe had neither the tone of one nor the appearance. Very calm, but with\na real calmness, not one assumed to cloak the passion of a man\nendeavoring to restrain himself; very polite, but without exaggeration;\nsmiling, but without chaff, he presented the most perfect contrast to\nArsene Lupin, a contrast so perfect even that, to my mind, Lupin\nappeared as much perplexed as myself.\n\nNo, there was no doubt about it: in the presence of that frail\nstripling, with cheeks smooth as a girl's and candid and charming eyes,\nLupin was losing his ordinary self-assurance. Several times over, I\nobserved traces of embarrassment in him. He hesitated, did not attack\nfrankly, wasted time in mawkish and affected phrases.\n\nIt also looked as though he wanted something. He seemed to be seeking,\nwaiting. What for? Some aid?\n\nThere was a fresh ring of the bell. He himself ran and opened the door.\nHe returned with a letter:\n\n\"Will you allow me, gentlemen?\" he asked.\n\nHe opened the letter. It contained a telegram. He read it--and became\nas though transformed. His face lit up, his figure righted itself and I\nsaw the veins on his forehead swell. It was the athlete who once more\nstood before me, the ruler, sure of himself, master of events and\nmaster of persons. He spread the telegram on the table and, striking it\nwith his fist, exclaimed:\n\n\"Now, M. Beautrelet, it's you and I!\"\n\nBeautrelet adopted a listening attitude and Lupin began, in measured,\nbut harsh and masterful tones:\n\n\"Let us throw off the mask--what say you?--and have done with\nhypocritical compliments. We are two enemies, who know exactly what to\nthink of each other; we act toward each other as enemies; and therefore\nwe ought to treat with each other as enemies.\"\n\n\"To treat?\" echoed Beautrelet, in a voice of surprise.\n\n\"Yes, to treat. I did not use that word at random and I repeat it, in\nspite of the effort, the great effort, which it costs me. This is the\nfirst time I have employed it to an adversary. But also, I may as well\ntell you at once, it is the last. Make the most of it. I shall not\nleave this flat without a promise from you. If I do, it means war.\"\n\nBeautrelet seemed more and more surprised. He said very prettily:\n\n\"I was not prepared for this--you speak so funnily! It's so different\nfrom what I expected! Yes, I thought you were not a bit like that! Why\nthis display of anger? Why use threats? Are we enemies because\ncircumstances bring us into opposition? Enemies? Why?\"\n\nLupin appeared a little out of countenance, but he snarled and, leaning\nover the boy:\n\n\"Listen to me, youngster,\" he said. \"It's not a question of picking\none's words. It's a question of a fact, a positive, indisputable fact;\nand that fact is this: in all the past ten years, I have not yet\nknocked up against an adversary of your capacity. With Ganimard and\nHolmlock Shears I played as if they were children. With you, I am\nobliged to defend myself, I will say more, to retreat. Yes, at this\nmoment, you and I well know that I must look upon myself as worsted in\nthe fight. Isidore Beautrelet has got the better of Arsene Lupin. My\nplans are upset. What I tried to leave in the dark you have brought\ninto the full light of day. You annoy me, you stand in my way. Well,\nI've had enough of it--Bredoux told you so to no purpose. I now tell\nyou so again; and I insist upon it, so that you may take it to heart:\nI've had enough of it!\"\n\nBeautrelet nodded his head:\n\n\"Yes, but what do you want?\"\n\n\"Peace! Each of us minding his own business, keeping to his own side!\"\n\n\"That is to say, you free to continue your burglaries undisturbed, I\nfree to return to my studies.\"\n\n\"Your studies--anything you please--I don't care. But you must leave me\nin peace--I want peace.\"\n\n\"How can I trouble it now?\"\n\nLupin seized his hand violently:\n\n\"You know quite well! Don't pretend not to know. You are at this moment\nin possession of a secret to which I attach the highest importance.\nThis secret you were free to guess, but you have no right to give it to\nthe public.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that I know it?\"\n\n\"You know it, I am certain: day by day, hour by hour, I have followed\nyour train of thought and the progress of your investigations. At the\nvery moment when Bredoux struck you, you were about to tell all.\nSubsequently, you delayed your revelations, out of solicitude for your\nfather. But they are now promised to this paper here. The article is\nwritten. It will be set up in an hour. It will appear to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\nLupin rose, and slashing the air with his hand,\n\n\"It shall not appear!\" he cried.\n\n\"It shall appear!\" said Beautrelet, starting up in his turn.\n\nAt last, the two men were standing up to each other. I received the\nimpression of a shock, as if they had seized each other round the body.\nBeautrelet seemed to burn with a sudden energy. It was as though a\nspark had kindled within him a group of new emotions: pluck,\nself-respect, the passion of fighting, the intoxication of danger. As\nfor Lupin, I read in the radiance of his glance the joy of the duellist\nwho at length encounters the sword of his hated rival.\n\n\"Is the article in the printer's hands?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Have you it there--on you?\"\n\n\"No fear! I shouldn't have it by now, in that case!\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"One of the assistant editors has it, in a sealed envelope. If I am not\nat the office by midnight, he will have set it up.\"\n\n\"Oh, the scoundrel!\" muttered Lupin. \"He has provided for everything!\"\n\nHis anger was increasing, visibly and frightfully. Beautrelet chuckled,\njeering in his turn, carried away by his success.\n\n\"Stop that, you brat!\" roared Lupin. \"You're forgetting who I am--and\nthat, if I wished--upon my word, he's daring to laugh!\"\n\nA great silence fell between them. Then Lupin stepped forward and, in\nmuttered tones, with his eyes on Beautrelet's:\n\n\"You shall go straight to the Grand Journal.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Tear up your article.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"See the editor.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Tell him you made a mistake.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And write him another article, in which you will give the official\nversion of the Ambrumesy mystery, the one which every one has accepted.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nLupin took up a steel ruler that lay on my desk and broke it in two\nwithout an effort. His pallor was terrible to see. He wiped away the\nbeads of perspiration that stood on his forehead. He, who had never\nknown his wishes resisted, was being maddened by the obstinacy of this\nchild. He pressed his two hands on Beautrelet's shoulder and,\nemphasizing every syllable, continued:\n\n\"You shall do as I tell you, Beautrelet. You shall say that your latest\ndiscoveries have convinced you of my death, that there is not the least\ndoubt about it. You shall say so because I wish it, because it has to\nbe believed that I am dead. You shall say so, above all, because, if\nyou do not say so--\"\n\n\"Because, if I do not say so--?\"\n\n\"Your father will be kidnapped to-night, as Ganimard and Holmlock\nShears were.\"\n\nBeautrelet gave a smile.\n\n\"Don't laugh--answer!\"\n\n\"My answer is that I am very sorry to disappoint you, but I have\npromised to speak and I shall speak.\"\n\n\"Speak in the sense which I have told you.\"\n\n\"I shall speak the truth,\" cried Beautrelet, eagerly. \"It is something\nwhich you can't understand, the pleasure, the need, rather, of saying\nthe thing that is and saying it aloud. The truth is here, in this brain\nwhich has guessed it and discovered it; and it will come out, all naked\nand quivering. The article, therefore, will be printed as I wrote it.\nThe world shall know that Lupin is alive and shall know the reason why\nhe wished to be considered dead. The world shall know all.\" And he\nadded, calmly, \"And my father shall not be kidnapped.\"\n\nOnce again, they were both silent, with their eyes still fixed upon\neach other. They watched each other. Their swords were engaged up to\nthe hilt. And it was like the heavy silence that goes before the mortal\nblow. Which of the two was to strike it?\n\nLupin said, between his teeth:\n\n\"Failing my instructions to the contrary, two of my friends have orders\nto enter your father's room to-night, at three o'clock in the morning,\nto seize him and carry him off to join Ganimard and Holmlock Shears.\"\n\nA burst of shrill laughter interrupted him:\n\n\"Why, you highwayman, don't you understand,\" cried Beautrelet, \"that I\nhave taken my precautions? So you think that I am innocent enough, ass\nenough, to have sent my father home to his lonely little house in the\nopen country!\" Oh, the gay, bantering laughter that lit up the boy's\nface! It was a new sort of laugh on his lips, a laugh that showed the\ninfluence of Lupin himself. And the familiar form of address which he\nadopted placed him at once on his adversary's level. He continued:\n\n\"You see, Lupin, your great fault is to believe your schemes\ninfallible. You proclaim yourself beaten, do you? What humbug! You are\nconvinced that you will always win the day in the end--and you forget\nthat others can have their little schemes, too. Mine is a very simple\none, my friend.\"\n\nIt was delightful to hear him talk. He walked up and down, with his\nhands in his pockets and with the easy swagger of a boy teasing a caged\nbeast. Really, at this moment, he was revenging, with the most terrible\nrevenges, all the victims of the great adventurer. And he concluded:\n\n\"Lupin, my father is not in Savoy. He is at the other end of France, in\nthe centre of a big town, guarded by twenty of our friends, who have\norders not to lose sight of him until our battle is over. Would you\nlike details? He is at Cherbourg, in the house of one of the keepers of\nthe arsenal. And remember that the arsenal is closed at night and that\nno one is allowed to enter it by day, unless he carries an\nauthorization and is accompanied by a guide.\"\n\nHe stopped in front of Lupin and defied him, like a child making faces\nat his playmate:\n\n\"What do you say to that, master?\"\n\nFor some minutes, Lupin had stood motionless. Not a muscle of his face\nhad moved. What were his thoughts? Upon what action was he resolving?\nTo any one knowing the fierce violence of his pride the only possible\nsolution was the total, immediate, final collapse of his adversary. His\nfingers twitched. For a second, I had a feeling that he was about to\nthrow himself upon the boy and wring his neck.\n\n\"What do you say to that, master?\" Beautrelet repeated.\n\nLupin took up the telegram that lay on the table, held it out and said,\nvery calmly:\n\n\"Here, baby, read that.\"\n\nBeautrelet became serious, suddenly, impressed by the gentleness of the\nmovement. He unfolded the paper and, at once, raising his eyes,\nmurmured:\n\n\"What does it mean? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"At any rate, you understand the first word,\" said Lupin, \"the first\nword of the telegram--that is to say, the name of the place from which\nit was sent--look--'Cherbourg.'\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" stammered Beautrelet. \"Yes--I understand--'Cherbourg'-and\nthen?\"\n\n\"And then?--I should think the rest is quite plain: 'Removal of luggage\nfinished. Friends left with it and will wait instructions till eight\nmorning. All well.' Is there anything there that seems obscure? The\nword 'luggage'? Pooh, you wouldn't have them write 'M. Beautrelet,\nsenior'! What then? The way in which the operation was performed? The\nmiracle by which your father was taken out of Cherbourg Arsenal, in\nspite of his twenty body-guards? Pooh, it's as easy as A B C! And the\nfact remains that the luggage has been dispatched. What do you say to\nthat, baby?\"\n\nWith all his tense being, with all his exasperated energy, Isidore\ntried to preserve a good countenance. But I saw his lips quiver, his\njaw shrink, his eyes vainly strive to fix upon a point. He lisped a few\nwords, then was silent and, suddenly, gave way and, with his hands\nbefore his face, burst into loud sobs:\n\n\"Oh, father! Father!\"\n\nAn unexpected result, which was certainly the collapse which Lupin's\npride demanded, but also something more, something infinitely touching\nand infinitely artless. Lupin gave a movement of annoyance and took up\nhis hat, as though this unaccustomed display of sentiment were too much\nfor him. But, on reaching the door, he stopped, hesitated and then\nreturned, slowly, step by step.\n\nThe soft sound of the sobs rose like the sad wailing of a little child\novercome with grief. The lad's shoulders marked the heart-rending\nrhythm. Tears appeared through the crossed fingers. Lupin leaned\nforward and, without touching Beautrelet, said, in a voice that had not\nthe least tone of pleasantry, nor even of the offensive pity of the\nvictor:\n\n\"Don't cry, youngster. This is one of those blows which a man must\nexpect when he rushes headlong into the fray, as you did. The worst\ndisasters lie in wait for him. The destiny of fighters will have it so.\nWe must suffer it as bravely as we can.\" Then, with a sort of\ngentleness, he continued, \"You were right, you see: we are not enemies.\nI have known it for long. From the very first, I felt for you, for the\nintelligent creature that you are, an involuntary sympathy--and\nadmiration. And that is why I wanted to say this to you--don't be\noffended, whatever you do: I should be extremely sorry to offend\nyou--but I must say it: well, give up struggling against me. I am not\nsaying this out of vanity--nor because I despise you--but, you see, the\nstruggle is too unequal. You do not know--nobody knows all the\nresources which I have at my command. Look here, this secret of the\nHollow Needle which you are trying so vainly to unravel: suppose, for a\nmoment, that it is a formidable, inexhaustible treasure--or else an\ninvisible, prodigious, fantastic refuge--or both perhaps. Think of the\nsuperhuman power which I must derive from it! And you do not know,\neither, all the resources which I have within myself--all that my will\nand my imagination enable me to undertake and to undertake\nsuccessfully. Only think that my whole life--ever since I was born, I\nmight almost say--has tended toward the same aim, that I worked like a\nconvict before becoming what I am and to realize, in its perfection,\nthe type which I wished to create--which I have succeeded in creating.\nThat being so--what can you do? At that very moment when you think that\nvictory lies within your grasp, it will escape you--there will be\nsomething of which you have not thought--a trifle--a grain of sand\nwhich I shall have put in the right place, unknown to you. I entreat\nyou, give up--I should be obliged to hurt you; and the thought\ndistresses me.\" And, placing his hand on the boy's forehead, he\nrepeated, \"Once more, youngster, give up. I should only hurt you. Who\nknows if the trap into which you will inevitably fall has not already\nopened under your footsteps?\"\n\nBeautrelet uncovered his face. He was no longer crying. Had he heard\nLupin's words? One might have doubted it, judging by his inattentive\nair.\n\nFor two or three minutes, he was silent. He seemed to weigh the\ndecision which he was about to take, to examine the reasons for and\nagainst, to count up the favorable and unfavorable chances. At last, he\nsaid to Lupin:\n\n\"If I change the sense of the article, if I confirm the version of your\ndeath and if I undertake never to contradict the false version which I\nshall have sanctioned, do you swear that my father will be free?\"\n\n\"I swear it. My friends have taken your father by motor car to another\nprovincial town. At seven o'clock to-morrow morning, if the article in\nthe Grand Journal is what I want it to be, I shall telephone to them\nand they will restore your father to liberty.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Beautrelet. \"I submit to your conditions.\"\n\nQuickly, as though he saw no object in prolonging the conversation\nafter accepting his defeat, he rose, took his hat, bowed to me, bowed\nto Lupin and went out. Lupin watched him go, listened to the sound of\nthe door closing and muttered:\n\n\"Poor little beggar!\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning, I sent my man out to buy the Grand\nJournal. It was twenty minutes before he brought me a copy, most of the\nkiosks being already sold out.\n\nI unfolded the paper with feverish hands. Beautrelet's article appeared\non the front page. I give it as it stood and as it was quoted in the\npress of the whole world:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE AMBRUMESY MYSTERY\n\nI do not intend in these few sentences to set out in detail the mental\nprocesses and the investigations that have enabled me to reconstruct\nthe tragedy--I should say the twofold tragedy--of Ambrumesy. In my\nopinion, this sort of work and the judgments which it entails,\ndeductions, inductions, analyses and so on, are only interesting in a\nminor degree and, in any case, are highly commonplace. No, I shall\ncontent myself with setting forth the two leading ideas which I\nfollowed; and, if I do that, it will be seen that, in so setting them\nforth and in solving the two problems which they raise, I shall have\ntold the story just as it happened, in the exact order of the different\nincidents.\n\nIt may be said that some of these incidents are not proved and that I\nleave too large a field to conjecture. That is quite true. But, in my\nview, my theory is founded upon a sufficiently large number of proved\nfacts to be able to say that even those facts which are not proved must\nfollow from the strict logic of events. The stream is so often lost\nunder the pebbly bed: it is nevertheless the same stream that reappears\nat intervals and mirrors back the blue sky.\n\nThe first riddle that confronted me, a riddle not in detail, but as a\nwhole, was how came it that Lupin, mortally wounded, one might say,\nmanaged to live for five or six weeks without nursing, medicine or\nfood, at the bottom of a dark hole?\n\nLet us start at the beginning. On Thursday the sixteenth of April, at\nfour o'clock in the morning, Arsene Lupin, surprised in the middle of\none of his most daring burglaries, runs away by the path leading to the\nruins and drops down shot. He drags himself painfully along, falls\nagain and picks himself up in the desperate hope of reaching the\nchapel. The chapel contains a crypt, the existence of which he has\ndiscovered by accident. If he can burrow there, he may be saved. By\ndint of an effort, he approaches it, he is but a few yards away, when a\nsound of footsteps approaches. Harassed and lost, he lets himself go.\nThe enemy arrives. It is Mlle. Raymonde de Saint-Veran.\n\nThis is the prologue or rather the first scene of the drama.\n\nWhat happened between them? This is the easier to guess inasmuch as the\nsequel of the adventure gives us all the necessary clues. At the girl's\nfeet lies a wounded man, exhausted by suffering, who will be captured\nin two minutes. THIS MAN HAS BEEN WOUNDED BY HERSELF. Will she also\ngive him up?\n\nIf he is Jean Daval's murderer, yes, she will let destiny take its\ncourse. But, in quick sentences, he tells her the truth about this\nawful murder committed by her uncle, M. de Gesvres. She believes him.\nWhat will she do?\n\nNobody can see them. The footman Victor is watching the little door.\nThe other, Albert, posted at the drawing-room window, has lost sight of\nboth of them. Will she give up the man she has wounded?\n\nThe girl is carried away by a movement of irresistible pity, which any\nwoman will understand. Instructed by Lupin, with a few movements she\nbinds up the wound with his handkerchief, to avoid the marks which the\nblood would leave. Then, with the aid of the key which he gives her,\nshe opens the door of the chapel. He enters, supported by the girl. She\nlocks the door again and walks away. Albert arrives.\n\nIf the chapel had been visited at that moment or at least during the\nnext few minutes, before Lupin had had time to recover his strength, to\nraise the flagstone and disappear by the stairs leading to the crypt,\nhe would have been taken. But this visit did not take place until six\nhours later and then only in the most superficial way. As it is, Lupin\nis saved; and saved by whom? By the girl who very nearly killed him.\n\nThenceforth, whether she wishes it or no, Mlle. de Saint-Veran is his\naccomplice. Not only is she no longer able to give him up, but she is\nobliged to continue her work, else the wounded man will perish in the\nshelter in which she has helped to conceal him. Therefore she continues.\n\nFor that matter, if her feminine instinct makes the task a compulsory\none, it also makes it easy. She is full of artifice, she foresees and\nforestalls everything. It is she who gives the examining magistrate a\nfalse description of Arsene Lupin (the reader will remember the\ndifference of opinion on this subject between the cousins). It is she,\nobviously, who, thanks to certain signs which I do not know of,\nsuspects an accomplice of Lupin's in the driver of the fly. She warns\nhim. She informs him of the urgent need of an operation. It is she, no\ndoubt, who substitutes one cap for the other. It is she who causes the\nfamous letter to be written in which she is personally threatened. How,\nafter that, is it possible to suspect her?\n\nIt is she, who at that moment when I was about to confide my first\nimpressions to the examining magistrate, pretends to have seen me, the\nday before, in the copsewood, alarms M. Filleul on my score and reduces\nme to silence: a dangerous move, no doubt, because it arouses my\nattention and directs it against the person who assails me with an\naccusation which I know to be false; but an efficacious move, because\nthe most important thing of all is to gain time and close my lips.\n\nLastly, it is she who, during forty days, feeds Lupin, brings him his\nmedicine (the chemist at Ouville will produce the prescriptions which\nhe made up for Mlle. de Saint-Veran), nurses him, dresses his wound,\nwatches over him AND CURES HIM.\n\nHere we have the first of our two problems solved, at the same time\nthat the Ambrumesy mystery is set forth. Arsene Lupin found, close at\nhand, in the chateau itself, the assistance which was indispensable to\nhim in order, first, not to be discovered and, secondly, to live.\n\nHe now lives. And we come to the second problem, corresponding with the\nsecond Ambrumesy mystery, the study of which served me as a conducting\nmedium. Why does Lupin, alive, free, at the head of his gang,\nomnipotent as before, why does Lupin make desperate efforts, efforts\nwith which I am constantly coming into collision, to force the idea of\nhis death upon the police and the public?\n\nWe must remember that Mlle. de Saint-Veran was a very pretty girl. The\nphotographs reproduced in the papers after her disappearance give but\nan imperfect notion of her beauty. That follows which was bound to\nfollow. Lupin, seeing this lovely girl daily for five or six weeks,\nlonging for her presence when she is not there, subjected to her charm\nand grace when she is there, inhaling the cool perfume of her breath\nwhen she bends over him, Lupin becomes enamored of his nurse. Gratitude\nturns to love, admiration to passion. She is his salvation, but she is\nalso the joy of his eyes, the dream of his lonely hours, his light, his\nhope, his very life.\n\nHe respects her sufficiently not to take advantage of the girl's\ndevotion and not to make use of her to direct his confederates. There\nis, in fact, a certain lack of decision apparent in the acts of the\ngang. But he loves her also, his scruples weaken and, as Mlle. de\nSaint-Veran refuses to be touched by a love that offends her, as she\nrelaxes her visits when they become less necessary, as she ceases them\nentirely on the day when he is cured--desperate, maddened by grief, he\ntakes a terrible resolve. He leaves his lair, prepares his stroke and,\non Saturday the sixth of June, assisted by his accomplices, he carries\noff the girl.\n\nThis is not all. The abduction must not be known. All search, all\nsurmises, all hope, even, must be cut short. Mlle. de Saint-Veran must\npass for dead. There is a mock murder: proofs are supplied for the\npolice inquiries. There is doubt about the crime, a crime, for that\nmatter, not unexpected, a crime foretold by the accomplices, a crime\nperpetrated to revenge the chief's death. And, through this very\nfact--observe the marvelous ingenuity of the conception--through this\nvery fact, the belief in this death is, so to speak, stimulated.\n\nIt is not enough to suggest a belief; it is necessary to compel a\ncertainty. Lupin foresees my interference. I am sure to guess the\ntrickery of the chapel. I am sure to discover the crypt. And, as the\ncrypt will be empty, the whole scaffolding will come to the ground.\n\nTHE CRYPT SHALL NOT BE EMPTY.\n\nIn the same way, the death of Mlle. de Saint-Veran will not be\ndefinite, unless the sea gives up her corpse.\n\nTHE SEA SHALL GIVE UP THE CORPSE OF MLLE. DE SAINT-VERAN.\n\nThe difficulty is tremendous. The double obstacle seems insurmountable.\nYes, to any one but Lupin, but not to Lupin.\n\nAs he had foreseen, I guess the trickery of the chapel, I discover the\ncrypt and I go down into the lair where Lupin has taken refuge. His\ncorpse is there!\n\nAny person who had admitted the death of Lupin as possible would have\nbeen baffled. But I had not admitted this eventuality for an instant\n(first, by intuition and, secondly, by reasoning). Pretense thereupon\nbecame useless and every scheme vain. I said to myself at once that the\nblock of stone disturbed by the pickaxe had been placed there with a\nvery curious exactness, that the least knock was bound to make it fall\nand that, in falling, it must inevitably reduce the head of the false\nArsene Lupin to pulp, in such a way as to make it utterly\nirrecognizable.\n\nAnother discovery: half an hour later, I hear that the body of Mlle. de\nSaint-Veran has been found on the rocks at Dieppe--or rather a body\nwhich is considered to be Mlle. de Saint-Veran's, for the reason that\nthe arm has a bracelet similar to one of that young lady's bracelets.\nThis, however, is the only mark of identity, for the corpse is\nirrecognizable.\n\nThereupon I remember and I understand. A few days earlier, I happened\nto read in a number of the Vigie de Dieppe that a young American couple\nstaying at Envermeu had committed suicide by taking poison and that\ntheir bodies had disappeared on the very night of the death. I hasten\nto Envermeu. The story is true, I am told, except in so far as concerns\nthe disappearance, because the brothers of the victims came to claim\nthe corpses and took them away after the usual formalities. The name of\nthese brothers, no doubt, was Arsene Lupin & Co.\n\nConsequently, the thing is proved. We know why Lupin shammed the murder\nof the girl and spread the rumor of his own death. He is in love and\ndoes not wish it known. And, to reach his ends, he shrinks from\nnothing, he even undertakes that incredible theft of the two corpses\nwhich he needs in order to impersonate himself and Mlle. de\nSaint-Veran. In this way, he will be at ease. No one can disturb him.\nNo one will ever suspect the truth which he wishes to suppress.\n\nNo one? Yes--three adversaries, at the most, might conceive doubts:\nGanimard, whose arrival is hourly expected; Holmlock Shears, who is\nabout to cross the Channel; and I, who am on the spot. This constitutes\na threefold danger. He removes it. He kidnaps Ganimard. He kidnaps\nHolmlock Shears. He has me stabbed by Bredoux.\n\nOne point alone remains obscure. Why was Lupin so fiercely bent upon\nsnatching the document about the Hollow Needle from me? He surely did\nnot imagine that, by taking it away, he could wipe out from my memory\nthe text of the five lines of which it consists! Then why? Did he fear\nthat the character of the paper itself, or some other clue, could give\nme a hint?\n\nBe that as it may, this is the truth of the Ambrumesy mystery. I repeat\nthat conjecture plays a certain part in the explanation which I offer,\neven as it played a great part in my personal investigation. But, if\none waited for proofs and facts to fight Lupin, one would run a great\nrisk either of waiting forever or else of discovering proofs and facts\ncarefully prepared by Lupin, which would lead in a direction\nimmediately opposite to the object in view. I feel confident that the\nfacts, when they are known, will confirm my surmise in every respect.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Isidore Beautrelet, mastered for a moment by Arsene Lupin,\ndistressed by the abduction of his father and resigned to defeat,\nIsidore Beautrelet, in the end, was unable to persuade himself to keep\nsilence. The truth was too beautiful and too curious, the proofs which\nhe was able to produce were too logical and too conclusive for him to\nconsent to misrepresent it. The whole world was waiting for his\nrevelations. He spoke.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the evening of the day on which his article appeared, the newspapers\nannounced the kidnapping of M. Beautrelet, senior. Isidore was informed\nof it by a telegram from Cherbourg, which reached him at three o'clock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nON THE TRACK\n\n\nYoung Beautrelet was stunned by the violence of the blow. As a matter\nof fact, although, in publishing his article, he had obeyed one of\nthose irresistible impulses which make a man despise every\nconsideration of prudence, he had never really believed in the\npossibility of an abduction. His precautions had been too thorough. The\nfriends at Cherbourg not only had instructions to guard and protect\nBeautrelet the elder: they were also to watch his comings and goings,\nnever to let him walk out alone and not even to hand him a single\nletter without first opening it. No, there was no danger. Lupin,\nwishing to gain time, was trying to intimidate his adversary.\n\nThe blow, therefore, was almost unexpected; and Isidore, because he was\npowerless to act, felt the pain of the shock during the whole of the\nremainder of the day. One idea alone supported him: that of leaving\nParis, going down there, seeing for himself what had happened and\nresuming the offensive.\n\nHe telegraphed to Cherbourg. He was at Saint-Lazare a little before\nnine. A few minutes after, he was steaming out of the station in the\nNormandy express.\n\nIt was not until an hour later, when he mechanically unfolded a\nnewspaper which he had bought on the platform, that he became aware of\nthe letter by which Lupin indirectly replied to his article of that\nmorning:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the Editor of the Grand Journal.\n\nSIR: I cannot pretend but that my modest personality, which would\ncertainly have passed unnoticed in more heroic times, has acquired a\ncertain prominence in the dull and feeble period in which we live. But\nthere is a limit beyond which the morbid curiosity of the crowd cannot\ngo without becoming indecently indiscreet. If the walls that surround\nour private lives be not respected, what is to safeguard the rights of\nthe citizen?\n\nWill those who differ plead the higher interest of truth? An empty\npretext in so far as I am concerned, because the truth is known and I\nraise no difficulty about making an official confession of the truth in\nwriting. Yes, Mlle. de Saint-Veran is alive. Yes, I love her. Yes, I\nhave the mortification not to be loved by her. Yes, the results of the\nboy Beautrelet's inquiry are wonderful in their precision and accuracy.\nYes, we agree on every point. There is no riddle left. There is no\nmystery. Well, then, what?\n\nInjured to the very depths of my soul, bleeding still from cruel\nwounds, I ask that my more intimate feelings and secret hopes may no\nlonger be delivered to the malevolence of the public. I ask for peace,\nthe peace which I need to conquer the affection of Mlle. de Saint-Veran\nand to wipe out from her memory the thousand little injuries which she\nhas had to suffer at the hands of her uncle and cousin--this has not\nbeen told--because of her position as a poor relation. Mlle. de\nSaint-Veran will forget this hateful past. All that she can desire,\nwere it the fairest jewel in the world, were it the most unattainable\ntreasure, I shall lay at her feet. She will be happy. She will love me.\n\nBut, if I am to succeed, once more, I require peace. That is why I lay\ndown my arms and hold out the olive-branch to my enemies--while warning\nthem, with every magnanimity on my part, that a refusal on theirs might\nbring down upon them the gravest consequences.\n\nOne word more on the subject of Mr. Harlington. This name conceals the\nidentity of an excellent fellow, who is secretary to Cooley, the\nAmerican millionaire, and instructed by him to lay hands upon every\nobject of ancient art in Europe which it is possible to discover. His\nevil star brought him into touch with my friend Etienne de Vaudreix,\nALIAS Arsene Lupin, ALIAS myself. He learnt, in this way, that a\ncertain M. de Gesvres was willing to part with four pictures by Rubens,\nostensibly on the condition that they were replaced by copies and that\nthe bargain to which he was consenting remained unknown. My friend\nVaudreix also undertook to persuade M. de Gesvres to sell his chapel.\nThe negotiations were conducted with entire good faith on the side of\nmy friend Vaudreix and with charming ingenuousness on the side of Mr.\nHarlington, until the day when the Rubenses and the carvings from the\nchapel were in a safe place and Mr. Harlington in prison. There remains\nnothing, therefore, to be done but to release the unfortunate American,\nbecause he was content to play the modest part of a dupe; to brand the\nmillionaire Cooley, because, for fear of possible unpleasantness, he\ndid not protest against his secretary's arrest; and to congratulate my\nfriend Etienne de Vaudreix, because he is revenging the outraged\nmorality of the public by keeping the hundred thousand francs which he\nwas paid on account by that singularly unattractive person, Cooley.\n\nPray, pardon the length of this letter and permit me to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nARSENE LUPIN.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nIsidore weighed the words of this communication as minutely, perhaps,\nas he had studied the document concerning the Hollow Needle. He went on\nthe principle, the correctness of which was easily proved, that Lupin\nhad never taken the trouble to send one of his amusing letters to the\npress without absolute necessity, without some motive which events were\nsure, sooner or later, to bring to light.\n\nWhat was the motive for this particular letter? For what hidden reason\nwas Lupin confessing his love and the failure of that love? Was it\nthere that Beautrelet had to seek, or in the explanations regarding Mr.\nHarlington, or further still, between the lines, behind all those words\nwhose apparent meaning had perhaps no other object than to suggest some\nwicked, perfidious, misleading little idea?\n\nFor hours, the young man, confined to his compartment, remained pensive\nand anxious. The letter filled him with mistrust, as though it had been\nwritten for his benefit and were destined to lead him, personally, into\nerror. For the first time and because he found himself confronted not\nwith a direct attack, but with an ambiguous, indefinable method of\nfighting, he underwent a distinct sensation of fear. And, when he\nthought of his good old, easy-going father, kidnapped through his\nfault, he asked himself, with a pang, whether he was not mad to\ncontinue so unequal a contest. Was the result not certain? Had Lupin\nnot won the game in advance?\n\nIt was but a short moment of weakness. When he alighted from his\ncompartment, at six o'clock in the morning, refreshed by a few hours'\nsleep, he had recovered all his confidence.\n\nOn the platform, Froberval, the dockyard clerk who had given\nhospitality to M. Beautrelet, senior, was waiting for him, accompanied\nby his daughter Charlotte, an imp of twelve or thirteen.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Isidore.\n\nThe worthy man beginning to moan and groan, he interrupted him, dragged\nhim to a neighboring tavern, ordered coffee and began to put plain\nquestions, without permitting the other the slightest digression:\n\n\"My father has not been carried off, has he? It was impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible. Still, he has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"We don't know.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"No. Yesterday morning, at six o'clock, as I had not seen him come down\nas usual, I opened his door. He was gone.\"\n\n\"But was he there on the day before, two days ago?\"\n\n\"Yes. On the day before yesterday, he did not leave his room. He was a\nlittle tired; and Charlotte took his lunch up to him at twelve and his\ndinner at seven in the evening.\"\n\n\"So it was between seven o'clock in the evening, on the day before\nyesterday, and six o'clock on yesterday morning that he disappeared?\"\n\n\"Yes, during the night before last. Only--\"\n\n\"Only what?\"\n\n\"Well, it's like this: you can't leave the arsenal at night.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he has not left it?\"\n\n\"That's impossible! My friends and I have searched the whole naval\nharbor.\"\n\n\"Then he has left it!\"\n\n\"Impossible, every outlet is guarded!\"\n\nBeautrelet reflected and then said:\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"Next, I hurried to the commandant's and informed the officer in\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Did he come to your house?\"\n\n\"Yes; and a gentleman from the public prosecutor's also. They searched\nall through the morning; and, when I saw that they were making no\nprogress and that there was no hope left, I telegraphed to you.\"\n\n\"Was the bed disarranged in his room?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor the room disturbed in any way?\"\n\n\"No. I found his pipe in its usual place, with his tobacco and the book\nwhich he was reading. There was even this little photograph of yourself\nin the middle of the book, marking the page.\"\n\n\"Let me see it.\"\n\nFroberval passed him the photograph. Beautrelet gave a start of\nsurprise. He had recognized himself in the snapshot, standing, with his\ntwo hands in his pockets, on a lawn from which rose trees and ruins.\n\nFroberval added:\n\n\"It must be the last portrait of yourself which you sent him. Look, on\nthe back, you will see the date, 3 April, the name of the photographer,\nR. de Val, and the name of the town, Lion--Lion-sur-Mer, perhaps.\"\n\nIsidore turned the photograph over and read this little note, in his\nown handwriting:\n\n\"R. de Val.--3.4--Lion.\"\n\nHe was silent for a few minutes and resumed:\n\n\"My father hadn't shown you that snapshot yet?\"\n\n\"No--and that's just what astonished me when I saw it yesterday--for\nyour father used so often to talk to us about you.\"\n\nThere was a fresh pause, greatly prolonged. Froberval muttered:\n\n\"I have business at the workshop. We might as well go in--\"\n\nHe was silent. Isidore had not taken his eyes from the photograph, was\nexamining it from every point of view. At last, the boy asked:\n\n\"Is there such a thing as an inn called the Lion d'Or at a short league\noutside the town?\"\n\n\"Yes, about a league from here.\"\n\n\"On the Route de Valognes, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, on the Route de Valognes.\"\n\n\"Well, I have every reason to believe that this inn was the\nhead-quarters of Lupin's friends. It was from there that they entered\ninto communication with my father.\"\n\n\"What an idea! Your father spoke to nobody. He saw nobody.\"\n\n\"He saw nobody, but they made use of an intermediary.\"\n\n\"What proof have you?\"\n\n\"This photograph.\"\n\n\"But it's your photograph!\"\n\n\"It's my photograph, but it was not sent by me. I was not even aware of\nits existence. It was taken, without my knowledge, in the ruins of\nAmbrumesy, doubtless by the examining-magistrate's clerk, who, as you\nknow, was an accomplice of Arsene Lupin's.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then this photograph became the passport, the talisman, by means of\nwhich they obtained my father's confidence.\"\n\n\"But who? Who was able to get into my house?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but my father fell into the trap. They told him and he\nbelieved that I was in the neighborhood, that I was asking to see him\nand that I was giving him an appointment at the Golden Lion.\"\n\n\"But all this is nonsense! How can you assert--?\"\n\n\"Very simply. They imitated my writing on the back of the photograph\nand specified the meeting-place: Valognes Road, 3 kilometres 400, Lion\nInn. My father came and they seized him, that's all.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" muttered Froberval, dumbfounded, \"very well. I admit\nit--things happened as you say--but that does not explain how he was\nable to leave during the night.\"\n\n\"He left in broad daylight, though he waited until dark to go to the\nmeeting-place.\"\n\n\"But, confound it, he didn't leave his room the whole of the day before\nyesterday!\"\n\n\"There is one way of making sure: run down to the dockyard, Froberval,\nand look for one of the men who were on guard in the afternoon, two\ndays ago.--Only, be quick, if you wish to find me here.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall take the next train back.\"\n\n\"What!--Why, you don't know--your inquiry--\"\n\n\"My inquiry is finished. I know pretty well all that I wanted to know.\nI shall have left Cherbourg in an hour.\"\n\nFroberval rose to go. He looked at Beautrelet with an air of absolute\nbewilderment, hesitated a moment and then took his cap:\n\n\"Are you coming, Charlotte?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Beautrelet, \"I shall want a few more particulars. Leave her\nwith me. Besides, I want to talk to her. I knew her when she was quite\nsmall.\"\n\nFroberval went away. Beautrelet and the little girl remained alone in\nthe tavern smoking room. A few minutes passed, a waiter entered,\ncleared away some cups and left the room again. The eyes of the young\nman and the child met; and Beautrelet placed his hand very gently on\nthe little girl's hand. She looked at him for two or three seconds,\ndistractedly, as though about to choke. Then, suddenly hiding her head\nbetween her folded arms, she burst into sobs.\n\nHe let her cry and, after a while, said:\n\n\"It was you, wasn't it, who did all the mischief, who acted as\ngo-between? It was you who took him the photograph? You admit it, don't\nyou? And, when you said that my father was in his room, two days ago,\nyou knew that it was not true, did you not, because you yourself had\nhelped him to leave it--?\"\n\nShe made no reply. He asked:\n\n\"Why did you do it? They offered you money, I suppose--to buy ribbons\nwith a frock--?\"\n\nHe uncrossed Charlotte's arms and lifted up her head. He saw a poor\nlittle face all streaked with tears, the attractive, disquieting,\nmobile face of one of those little girls who seem marked out for\ntemptation and weakness.\n\n\"Come,\" said Beautrelet, \"it's over, we'll say no more about it. I will\nnot even ask you how it happened. Only you must tell me everything that\ncan be of use to me.--Did you catch anything--any remark made by those\nmen? How did they carry him off?\"\n\nShe replied at once:\n\n\"By motor car. I heard them talking about it--\"\n\n\"And what road did they take?\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't know that!\"\n\n\"Didn't they say anything before you--something that might help us?\"\n\n\"No--wait, though: there was one who said, 'We shall have no time to\nlose--the governor is to telephone to us at eight o'clock in the\nmorning--'\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"I can't say.--I've forgotten--\"\n\n\"Try--try and remember. It was the name of a town, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes--a name--like Chateau--\"\n\n\"Chateaubriant?--Chateau-Thierry?--\"\n\n\"No-no--\"\n\n\"Chateauroux?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was it--Chateauroux--\"\n\nBeautrelet did not wait for her to complete her sentence. Already he\nwas on his feet and, without giving a thought to Froberval, without\neven troubling about the child, who stood gazing at him in\nstupefaction, he opened the door and ran to the station:\n\n\"Chateauroux, madame--a ticket for Chateauroux--\"\n\n\"Over Mans and Tours?\" asked the booking-clerk.\n\n\"Of course--the shortest way. Shall I be there for lunch?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"For dinner? Bedtime--?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! For that, you would have to go over Paris. The Paris express\nleaves at nine o'clock. You're too late--\"\n\nIt was not too late. Beautrelet was just able to catch the train.\n\n\"Well,\" said Beautrelet, rubbing his hands, \"I have spent only two\nhours or so at Cherbourg, but they were well employed.\"\n\nHe did not for a moment think of accusing Charlotte of lying. Weak,\nunstable, capable of the worst treacheries, those petty natures also\nobey impulses of sincerity; and Beautrelet had read in her affrighted\neyes her shame for the harm which she had done and her delight at\nrepairing it in part. He had no doubt, therefore, that Chateauroux was\nthe other town to which Lupin had referred and where his confederates\nwere to telephone to him.\n\nOn his arrival in Paris, Beautrelet took every necessary precaution to\navoid being followed. He felt that it was a serious moment. He was on\nthe right road that was leading him to his father: one act of\nimprudence might ruin all.\n\nHe went to the flat of one of his schoolfellows and came out, an hour\nlater, irrecognizable, rigged out as an Englishman of thirty, in a\nbrown check suit, with knickerbockers, woolen stockings and a cap, a\nhigh-colored complexion and a red wig. He jumped on a bicycle laden\nwith a complete painter's outfit and rode off to the Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nHe slept that night at Issoudun. The next morning, he mounted his\nmachine at break of day. At seven o'clock, he walked into the\nChateauroux post-office and asked to be put on to Paris. As he had to\nwait, he entered into conversation with the clerk and learnt that, two\ndays before, at the same hour, a man dressed for motoring had also\nasked for Paris.\n\nThe proof was established. He waited no longer.\n\nBy the afternoon, he had ascertained, from undeniable evidence, that a\nlimousine car, following the Tours road, had passed through the village\nof Buzancais and the town of Chateauroux and had stopped beyond the\ntown, on the verge of the forest. At ten o'clock, a hired gig, driven\nby a man unknown, had stopped beside the car and then gone off south,\nthrough the valley of the Bouzanne. There was then another person\nseated beside the driver. As for the car, it had turned in the opposite\ndirection and gone north, toward Issoudun.\n\nBeautrelet easily discovered the owner of the gig, who, however, had no\ninformation to supply. He had hired out his horse and trap to a man who\nbrought them back himself next day.\n\nLastly, that same evening, Isidore found out that the motor car had\nonly passed through Issoudun, continuing its road toward Orleans, that\nis to say, toward Paris.\n\nFrom all this, it resulted, in the most absolute fashion, that M.\nBeautrelet was somewhere in the neighborhood. If not, how was it\nconceivable that people should travel nearly three hundred miles across\nFrance in order to telephone from Chateauroux and next to return, at an\nacute angle, by the Paris road?\n\nThis immense circuit had a more definite object: to move M. Beautrelet\nto the place assigned to him.\n\n\"And this place is within reach of my hand,\" said Isidore to himself,\nquivering with hope and expectation. \"My father is waiting for me to\nrescue him at ten or fifteen leagues from here. He is close by. He is\nbreathing the same air as I.\"\n\nHe set to work at once. Taking a war-office map, he divided it into\nsmall squares, which he visited one after the other, entering the\nfarmhouses making the peasants talk, calling on the schoolmasters, the\nmayors, the parish priests, chatting to the women. It seemed to him\nthat he must attain his end without delay and his dreams grew until it\nwas no longer his father alone whom he hoped to deliver, but all those\nwhom Lupin was holding captive: Raymonde de Saint-Veran, Ganimard,\nHolmlock Shears, perhaps, and others, many others; and, in reaching\nthem, he would, at the same time, reach Lupin's stronghold, his lair,\nthe impenetrable retreat where he was piling up the treasures of which\nhe had robbed the wide world.\n\nBut, after a fortnight's useless searching, his enthusiasm ended by\nslackening and he very soon lost confidence. Because success was slow\nin appearing, from one day to the next, almost, he ceased to believe in\nit; and, though he continued to pursue his plan of investigations, he\nwould have felt a real surprise if his efforts had led to the smallest\ndiscovery.\n\nMore days still passed by, monotonous days of discouragement. He read\nin the newspapers that the Comte de Gesvres and his daughter had left\nAmbrumesy and gone to stay near Nice. He also learnt that Harlington\nhad been released, that gentleman's innocence having become\nself-obvious, in accordance with the indications supplied by Arsene\nLupin.\n\nIsidore changed his head-quarters, established himself for two days at\nthe Chatre, for two days at Argenton. The result was the same.\n\nJust then, he was nearly throwing up the game. Evidently, the gig in\nwhich his father had been carried off could only have furnished a\nstage, which had been followed by another stage, furnished by some\nother conveyance. And his father was far away.\n\nHe was thinking of leaving, when, one Monday morning, he saw, on the\nenvelope of an unstamped letter, sent on to him from Paris, a\nhandwriting that set him trembling with emotion. So great was his\nexcitement that, for some minutes, he dared not open the letter, for\nfear of a disappointment. His hand shook. Was it possible? Was this not\na trap laid for him by his infernal enemy?\n\nHe tore open the envelope. It was indeed a letter from his father,\nwritten by his father himself. The handwriting presented all the\npeculiarities, all the oddities of the hand which he knew so well.\n\nHe read:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nWill these lines ever reach you, my dear son? I dare not believe it.\n\nDuring the whole night of my abduction, we traveled by motor car; then,\nin the morning, by carriage. I could see nothing. My eyes were\nbandaged. The castle in which I am confined should be somewhere in the\nmidlands, to judge by its construction and the vegetation in the park.\nThe room which I occupy is on the second floor: it is a room with two\nwindows, one of which is almost blocked by a screen of climbing\nglycines. In the afternoon, I am allowed to walk about the park, at\ncertain hours, but I am kept under unrelaxing observation.\n\nI am writing this letter, on the mere chance of its reaching you, and\nfastening it to a stone. Perhaps, one day, I shall be able to throw it\nover the wall and some peasant will pick it up.\n\nBut do not be distressed about me. I am treated with every\nconsideration.\n\nYour old father, who is very fond of you and very sad to think of the\ntrouble he is giving you,\n\nBEAUTRELET.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nIsidore at once looked at the postmarks. They read, \"Cuzion, Indre.\"\n\nThe Indre! The department which he had been stubbornly searching for\nweeks!\n\nHe consulted a little pocket-guide which he always carried. Cuzion, in\nthe canton of Eguzon--he had been there too.\n\nFor prudence's sake, he discarded his personality as an Englishman,\nwhich was becoming too well known in the district, disguised himself as\na workman and made for Cuzion. It was an unimportant village. He would\neasily discover the sender of the letter.\n\nFor that matter, chance served him without delay:\n\n\"A letter posted on Wednesday last?\" exclaimed the mayor, a respectable\ntradesman in whom he confided and who placed himself at his disposal.\n\"Listen, I think I can give you a valuable clue: on Saturday morning,\nGaffer Charel, an old knife-grinder who visits all the fairs in the\ndepartment, met me at the end of the village and asked, 'Monsieur le\nmaire, does a letter without a stamp on it go all the same?' 'Of\ncourse,' said I. 'And does it get there?' 'Certainly. Only there's\ndouble postage to pay on it, that's all the difference.'\"\n\n\"And where does he live?\"\n\n\"He lives over there, all alone--on the slope--the hovel that comes\nnext after the churchyard.--Shall I go with you?\"\n\nIt was a hovel standing by itself, in the middle of an orchard\nsurrounded by tall trees. As they entered the orchard, three magpies\nflew away with a great splutter and they saw that the birds were flying\nout of the very hole in which the watch-dog was fastened. And the dog\nneither barked nor stirred as they approached.\n\nBeautrelet went up in great surprise. The brute was lying on its side,\nwith stiff paws, dead.\n\nThey ran quickly to the cottage. The door stood open. They entered. At\nthe back of a low, damp room, on a wretched straw mattress, flung on\nthe floor itself, lay a man fully dressed.\n\n\"Gaffer Charel!\" cried the mayor. \"Is he dead, too?\"\n\nThe old man's hands were cold, his face terribly pale, but his heart\nwas still beating, with a faint, slow throb, and he seemed not to be\nwounded in any way.\n\nThey tried to resuscitate him and, as they failed in their efforts,\nBeautrelet went to fetch a doctor. The doctor succeeded no better than\nthey had done. The old man did not seem to be suffering. He looked as\nif he were just asleep, but with an artificial slumber, as though he\nhad been put to sleep by hypnotism or with the aid of a narcotic.\n\nIn the middle of the night that followed, however, Isidore, who was\nwatching by his side, observed that the breathing became stronger and\nthat his whole being appeared to be throwing off the invisible bonds\nthat paralyzed it.\n\nAt daybreak, he woke up and resumed his normal functions: ate, drank\nand moved about. But, the whole day long, he was unable to reply to the\nyoung man's questions and his brain seemed as though still numbed by an\ninexplicable torpor.\n\nThe next day, he asked Beautrelet:\n\n\"What are you doing here, eh?\"\n\nIt was the first time that he had shown surprise at the presence of a\nstranger beside him.\n\nGradually, in this way, he recovered all his faculties. He talked. He\nmade plans. But, when Beautrelet asked him about the events immediately\npreceding his sleep, he seemed not to understand.\n\nAnd Beautrelet felt that he really did not understand. He had lost the\nrecollection of all that had happened since the Friday before. It was\nlike a sudden gap in the ordinary flow of his life. He described his\nmorning and afternoon on the Friday, the purchases he had made at the\nfair, the meals he had taken at the inn. Then--nothing--nothing more.\nHe believed himself to be waking on the morrow of that day.\n\nIt was horrible for Beautrelet. The truth lay there, in those eyes\nwhich had seen the walls of the park behind which his father was\nwaiting for him, in those hands which had picked up the letter, in that\nmuddled brain which had recorded the whereabouts of that scene, the\nsetting, the little corner of the world in which the play had been\nenacted. And from those hands, from that brain he was unable to extract\nthe faintest echo of the truth so near at hand!\n\nOh, that impalpable and formidable obstacle, against which all his\nefforts hurled themselves in vain, that obstacle built up of silence\nand oblivion! How clearly it bore the mark of Arsene Lupin! He alone,\ninformed, no doubt, that M. Beautrelet had attempted to give a signal,\nhe alone could have struck with partial death the one man whose\nevidence could injure him. It was not that Beautrelet felt himself to\nbe discovered or thought that Lupin, hearing of his stealthy attack and\nknowing that a letter had reached him, was defending himself against\nhim personally. But what an amount of foresight and real intelligence\nit displayed to suppress any possible accusation on the part of that\nchance wayfarer! Nobody now knew that within the walls of a park there\nlay a prisoner asking for help.\n\nNobody? Yes, Beautrelet. Gaffer Charel was unable to speak. Very well.\nBut, at least, one could find out which fair the old man had visited\nand which was the logical road that he had taken to return by. And,\nalong this road, perhaps it would at last be possible to find--\n\nIsidore, as it was, had been careful not to visit Gaffer Charel's hovel\nexcept with the greatest precautions and in such a way as not to give\nan alarm. He now decided not to go back to it. He made inquiries and\nlearnt that Friday was market-day at Fresselines, a fair-sized town\nsituated a few leagues off, which could be reached either by the rather\nwinding highroad or by a series of short cuts.\n\nOn the Friday, he chose the road and saw nothing that attracted his\nattention, no high walled enclosure, no semblance of an old castle.\n\nHe lunched at an inn at Fresselines and was on the point of leaving\nwhen he saw Gaffer Charel arrive and cross the square, wheeling his\nlittle knife-grinding barrow before him. He at once followed him at a\ngood distance.\n\nThe old man made two interminable waits, during which he ground dozens\nof knives. Then, at last, he went away by a quite different road, which\nran in the direction of Crozant and the market-town of Eguzon.\n\nBeautrelet followed him along this road. But he had not walked five\nminutes before he received the impression that he was not alone in\nshadowing the old fellow. A man was walking along between them,\nstopping at the same time as Charel and starting off again when he did,\nwithout, for that matter, taking any great precautions against being\nseen.\n\n\"He is being watched,\" thought Beautrelet. \"Perhaps they want to know\nif he stops in front of the walls--\"\n\nHis heart beat violently. The event was at hand.\n\nThe three of them, one behind the other, climbed up and down the steep\nslopes of the country and arrived at Crozant, famed for the colossal\nruins of its castle. There Charel made a halt of an hour's duration.\nNext he went down to the riverside and crossed the bridge.\n\nBut then a thing happened that took Beautrelet by surprise. The other\nman did not cross the river. He watched the old fellow move away and,\nwhen he had lost sight of him, turned down a path that took him right\nacross the fields.\n\nBeautrelet hesitated for a few seconds as to what course to take, and\nthen quietly decided. He set off in pursuit of the man.\n\n\"He has made sure,\" he thought, \"that Gaffer Charel has gone straight\nahead. That is all he wanted to know and so he is going--where? To the\ncastle?\"\n\nHe was within touch of the goal. He felt it by a sort of agonizing\ngladness that uplifted his whole being.\n\nThe man plunged into a dark wood overhanging the river and then\nappeared once more in the full light, where the path met the horizon.\n\nWhen Beautrelet, in his turn, emerged from the wood, he was greatly\nsurprised no longer to see the man. He was seeking him with his eyes\nwhen, suddenly, he gave a stifled cry and, with a backward spring, made\nfor the line of trees which he had just left. On his right, he had seen\na rampart of high walls, flanked, at regular distances, by massive\nbuttresses.\n\nIt was there! It was there! Those walls held his father captive! He had\nfound the secret place where Lupin confined his victim.\n\nHe dared not quit the shelter which the thick foliage of the wood\nafforded him. Slowly, almost on all fours, he bore to the right and in\nthis way reached the top of a hillock that rose to the level of the\nneighboring trees. The walls were taller still. Nevertheless, he\nperceived the roof of the castle which they surrounded, an old Louis\nXIII. roof, surmounted by very slender bell-turrets arranged\ncorbel-wise around a higher steeple which ran to a point.\n\nBeautrelet did no more that day. He felt the need to reflect and to\nprepare his plan of attack without leaving anything to chance. He held\nLupin safe; and it was for Beautrelet now to select the hour and the\nmanner of the combat.\n\nHe walked away.\n\nNear the bridge, he met two country-girls carrying pails of milk. He\nasked:\n\n\"What is the name of the castle over there, behind the trees?\"\n\n\"That's the Chateau de l'Aiguille, sir.\"\n\nHe had put his question without attaching any importance to it. The\nanswer took away his breath:\n\n\"The Chateau de l'Aiguille?--Oh!--But in what department are we? The\nIndre?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. The Indre is on the other side of the river. This side,\nit's the Creuse.\"\n\nIsidore saw it all in a flash. The Chateau de l'Aiguille! The\ndepartment of the Creuse! L'AIGUILLE CREUSE! The Hollow Needle! The\nvery key to the document! Certain, decisive, absolute victory!\n\nWithout another word, he turned his back on the two girls and went his\nway, tottering like a drunken man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nAN HISTORIC SECRET\n\n\nBeautrelet's resolve was soon taken: he would act alone. To inform the\npolice was too dangerous. Apart from the fact that he could only offer\npresumptions, he dreaded the slowness of the police, their inevitable\nindiscretions, the whole preliminary inquiry, during which Lupin, who\nwas sure to be warned, would have time to effect a retreat in good\norder.\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning, with his bundle under his arm, he\nleft the inn in which he was staying near Cuzion, made for the nearest\nthicket, took off his workman's clothes, became once more the young\nEnglish painter that he had been and went to call on the notary at\nEguzon, the largest place in the immediate neighborhood.\n\nHe said that he liked the country and that he was thinking of taking up\nhis residence there, with his relations, if he could find a suitable\nhouse.\n\nThe notary mentioned a number of properties. Beautrelet took note of\nthem and let fall that some one had spoken to him of the Chateau de\nl'Aiguille, on the bank of the Creuse.\n\n\"Oh, yes, but the Chateau de l'Aiguille, which has belonged to one of\nmy clients for the last five years, is not for sale.\"\n\n\"He lives in it, then?\"\n\n\"He used to live in it, or rather his mother did. But she did not care\nfor it; found the castle rather gloomy. So they left it last year.\"\n\n\"And is no one living there at present?\"\n\n\"Yes, an Italian, to whom my client let it for the summer season: Baron\nAnfredi.\"\n\n\"Oh, Baron Anfredi! A man still young, rather grave and\nsolemn-looking--?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can't say.--My client dealt with him direct. There was no\nregular agreement, just a letter--\"\n\n\"But you know the baron?\"\n\n\"No, he never leaves the castle.--Sometimes, in his motor, at night, so\nthey say. The marketing is done by an old cook, who talks to nobody.\nThey are queer people--\"\n\n\"Do you think your client would consent to sell his castle?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. It's an historic castle, built in the purest Louis\nXIII. style. My client was very fond of it; and, unless he has changed\nhis mind--\"\n\n\"Can you give me his name and address?\"\n\n\"Louis Valmeras, 34, Rue du Mont-Thabor.\"\n\nBeautrelet took the train for Paris at the nearest station. On the next\nday but one, after three fruitless calls, he at last found Louis\nValmeras at home. He was a man of about thirty, with a frank and\npleasing face. Beautrelet saw no need to beat about the bush, stated\nwho he was and described his efforts and the object of the step which\nhe was now taking:\n\n\"I have good reason to believe,\" he concluded, \"that my father is\nimprisoned in the Chateau de l'Aiguille, doubtless in the company of\nother victims. And I have come to ask you what you know of your tenant,\nBaron Anfredi.\"\n\n\"Not much. I met Baron Anfredi last winter at Monte Carlo. He had heard\nby accident that I was the owner of the Chateau de l'Aiguille and, as\nhe wished to spend the summer in France, he made me an offer for it.\"\n\n\"He is still a young man--\"\n\n\"Yes, with very expressive eyes, fair hair--\"\n\n\"And a beard?\"\n\n\"Yes, ending in two points, which fall over a collar fastened at the\nback, like a clergyman's. In fact, he looks a little like an English\nparson.\"\n\n\"It's he,\" murmured Beautrelet, \"it's he, as I have seen him: it's his\nexact description.\"\n\n\"What! Do you think--?\"\n\n\"I think, I am sure that your tenant is none other than Arsene Lupin.\"\n\nThe story amused Louis Valmeras. He knew all the adventures of Arsene\nLupin and the varying fortunes of his struggle with Beautrelet. He\nrubbed his hands:\n\n\"Ha, the Chateau de l'Aiguille will become famous!--I'm sure I don't\nmind, for, as a matter of fact, now that my mother no longer lives in\nit, I have always thought that I would get rid of it at the first\nopportunity. After this, I shall soon find a purchaser. Only--\"\n\n\"Only what?\"\n\n\"I will ask you to act with the most extreme prudence and not to inform\nthe police until you are quite sure. Can you picture the situation,\nsupposing my tenant were not Arsene Lupin?\"\n\nBeautrelet set forth his plan. He would go alone at night; he would\nclimb the walls; he would sleep in the park-- Louis Valmeras stopped\nhim at once:\n\n\"You will not climb walls of that height so easily. If you do, you will\nbe received by two huge sheep-dogs which belonged to my mother and\nwhich I left behind at the castle.\"\n\n\"Pooh! A dose of poison--\"\n\n\"Much obliged. But suppose you escaped them. What then? How would you\nget into the castle? The doors are massive, the windows barred. And,\neven then, once you were inside, who would guide you? There are eighty\nrooms.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that room with two windows, on the second story--\"\n\n\"I know it, we call it the glycine room. But how will you find it?\nThere are three staircases and a labyrinth of passages. I can give you\nthe clue and explain the way to you, but you would get lost just the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" said Beautrelet, laughing.\n\n\"I can't. I have promised to go to my mother in the South.\"\n\nBeautrelet returned to the friend with whom he was staying and began to\nmake his preparations. But, late in the day, as he was getting ready to\ngo, he received a visit from Valmeras.\n\n\"Do you still want me?\"\n\n\"Rather!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm coming with you. Yes, the expedition fascinates me. I think\nit will be very amusing and I like being mixed up in this sort of\nthing.--Besides, my help will be of use to you. Look, here's something\nto start with.\"\n\nHe held up a big key, all covered with rust and looking very old.\n\n\"What does the key open?\" asked Beautrelet.\n\n\"A little postern hidden between two buttresses and left unused since\ncenturies ago. I did not even think of pointing it out to my tenant. It\nopens straight on the country, just at the verge of the wood.\"\n\nBeautrelet interrupted him quickly:\n\n\"They know all about that outlet. It was obviously by this way that the\nman whom I followed entered the park. Come, it's fine game and we shall\nwin it. But, by Jupiter, we must play our cards carefully!\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days later, a half-famished horse dragged a gipsy caravan into\nCrozant. Its driver obtained leave to stable it at the end of the\nvillage, in an old deserted cart-shed. In addition to the driver, who\nwas none other than Valmeras, there were three young men, who occupied\nthemselves in the manufacture of wicker-work chairs: Beautrelet and two\nof his Janson friends.\n\nThey stayed there for three days, waiting for a propitious, moonless\nnight and roaming singly round the outskirts of the park. Once\nBeautrelet saw the postern. Contrived between two buttresses placed\nvery close together, it was almost merged, behind the screen of\nbrambles that concealed it, in the pattern formed by the stones of the\nwall.\n\nAt last, on the fourth evening, the sky was covered with heavy black\nclouds and Valmeras decided that they should go reconnoitring, at the\nrisk of having to return again, should circumstances prove unfavorable.\n\nAll four crossed the little wood. Then Beautrelet crept through the\nheather, scratched his hands at the bramble-hedge and, half raising\nhimself, slowly, with restrained movements, put the key into the lock.\nHe turned it gently. Would the door open without an effort? Was there\nno bolt closing it on the other side? He pushed: the door opened,\nwithout a creak or jolt. He was in the park.\n\n\"Are you there, Beautrelet?\" asked Valmeras. \"Wait for me. You two\nchaps, watch the door and keep our line of retreat open. At the least\nalarm, whistle.\"\n\nHe took Beautrelet's hand and they plunged into the dense shadow of the\nthickets. A clearer space was revealed to them when they reached the\nedge of the central lawn. At the same moment a ray of moonlight pierced\nthe clouds; and they saw the castle, with its pointed turrets arranged\naround the tapering spire to which, no doubt, it owed its name. There\nwas no light in the windows; not a sound.\n\nValmeras grasped his companion's arm:\n\n\"Keep still!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The dogs, over there--look--\"\n\nThere was a growl. Valmeras gave a low whistle. Two white forms leapt\nforward and, in four bounds, came and crouched at their master's feet.\n\n\"Gently--lie down--that's it--good dogs--stay there.\"\n\nAnd he said to Beautrelet:\n\n\"And now let us push on. I feel more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of the way?\"\n\n\"Yes. We are near the terrace.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"I remember that, on the left, at a place where the river terrace rises\nto the level of the ground-floor windows, there is a shutter which\ncloses badly and which can be opened from the outside.\"\n\nThey found, when they came to it, that the shutter yielded to pressure.\nValmeras removed a pane with a diamond which he carried. He turned the\nwindow-latch. First one and then the other stepped over the balcony.\nThey were now in the castle, at the end of a passage which divided the\nleft wing into two.\n\n\"This room,\" said Valmeras, \"opens at the end of a passage. Then comes\nan immense hall, lined with statues, and at the end of the hall a\nstaircase which ends near the room occupied by your father.\"\n\nHe took a step forward.\n\n\"Are you coming, Beautrelet?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"But no, you're not coming--What's the matter with you?\"\n\nHe seized him by the hand. It was icy cold and he perceived that the\nyoung man was cowering on the floor.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Nothing--it'll pass off--\"\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid--\"\n\n\"You're afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Beautrelet confessed, frankly, \"it's my nerves giving way--I\ngenerally manage to control them--but, to-day, the silence--the\nexcitement--And then, since I was stabbed by that magistrate's\nclerk--But it will pass off--There, it's passing now--\"\n\nHe succeeded in rising to his feet and Valmeras dragged him out of the\nroom. They groped their way along the passage, so softly that neither\ncould hear a sound made by the other.\n\nA faint glimmer, however, seemed to light the hall for which they were\nmaking. Valmeras put his head round the corner. It was a night-light\nplaced at the foot of the stairs, on a little table which showed\nthrough the frail branches of a palm tree.\n\n\"Halt!\" whispered Valmeras.\n\nNear the night-light, a man stood sentry, carrying a gun.\n\nHad he seen them? Perhaps. At least, something must have alarmed him,\nfor he brought the gun to his shoulder.\n\nBeautrelet had fallen on his knees, against a tub containing a plant,\nand he remained quite still, with his heart thumping against his chest.\n\nMeanwhile, the silence and the absence of all movement reassured the\nman. He lowered his weapon. But his head was still turned in the\ndirection of the tub.\n\nTerrible minutes passed: ten minutes, fifteen. A moonbeam had glided\nthrough a window on the staircase. And, suddenly, Beautrelet became\naware that the moonbeam was shifting imperceptibly, and that, before\nfifteen, before ten more minutes had elapsed, it would be shining full\nin his face.\n\nGreat drops of perspiration fell from his forehead on his trembling\nhands. His anguish was such that he was on the point of getting up and\nrunning away--But, remembering that Valmeras was there, he sought him\nwith his eyes and was astounded to see him, or rather to imagine him,\ncreeping in the dark, under cover of the statues and plants. He was\nalready at the foot of the stairs, within a few steps of the man.\n\nWhat was he going to do? To pass in spite of all? To go upstairs alone\nand release the prisoner? But could he pass?\n\nBeautrelet no longer saw him and he had an impression that something\nwas about to take place, something that seemed foreboded also by the\nsilence, which hung heavier, more awful than before.\n\nAnd, suddenly, a shadow springing upon the man, the night-light\nextinguished, the sound of a struggle--Beautrelet ran up. The two\nbodies had rolled over on the flagstones. He tried to stoop and see.\nBut he heard a hoarse moan, a sigh; and one of the adversaries rose to\nhis feet and seized him by the arm:\n\n\"Quick!--Come along!\"\n\nIt was Valmeras.\n\nThey went up two storys and came out at the entrance to a corridor,\ncovered by a hanging.\n\n\"To the right,\" whispered Valmeras. \"The fourth room on the left.\"\n\nThey soon found the door of the room. As they expected, the captive was\nlocked in. It took them half an hour, half an hour of stifled efforts,\nof muffled attempts, to force open the lock. The door yielded at last.\n\nBeautrelet groped his way to the bed. His father was asleep.\n\nHe woke him gently:\n\n\"It's I--Isidore--and a friend--don't be afraid--get up--not a word.\"\n\nThe father dressed himself, but, as they were leaving the room, he\nwhispered:\n\n\"I am not alone in the castle--\"\n\n\"Ah? Who else? Ganimard? Shears?\"\n\n\"No--at least, I have not seen them.\"\n\n\"Who then?\"\n\n\"A young girl.\"\n\n\"Mlle. de Saint-Veran, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I don't know--I saw her several times at a distance, in the park--and,\nwhen I lean out of my window, I can see hers. She has made signals to\nme.\"\n\n\"Do you know which is her room?\"\n\n\"Yes, in this passage, the third on the right.\"\n\n\"The blue room,\" murmured Valmeras. \"It has folding doors: they won't\ngive us so much trouble.\"\n\nOne of the two leaves very soon gave way. Old Beautrelet undertook to\ntell the girl.\n\nTen minutes later, he left the room with her and said to his son:\n\n\"You were right--Mlle. de Saint-Veran--;\"\n\nThey all four went down the stairs. When they reached the bottom,\nValmeras stopped and bent over the man. Then, leading them to the\nterrace-room:\n\n\"He is not dead,\" he said. \"He will live.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Beautrelet, with a sigh of relief.\n\n\"No, fortunately, the blade of my knife bent: the blow is not fatal.\nBesides, in any case, those rascals deserve no pity.\"\n\nOutside, they were met by the dogs, which accompanied them to the\npostern. Here, Beautrelet found his two friends and the little band\nleft the park. It was three o'clock in the morning.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis first victory was not enough to satisfy Beautrelet. As soon as he\nhad comfortably settled his father and Mlle. de Saint-Veran, he asked\nthem about the people who lived at the castle, and, particularly, about\nthe habits of Arsene Lupin. He thus learnt that Lupin came only every\nthree or four days, arriving at night in his motor car and leaving\nagain in the morning. At each of his visits, he called separately upon\nhis two prisoners, both of whom agreed in praising his courtesy and his\nextreme civility. For the moment, he was not at the castle.\n\nApart from him, they had seen no one except an old woman, who ruled\nover the kitchen and the house, and two men, who kept watch over them\nby turns and never spoke to them: subordinates, obviously, to judge by\ntheir manners and appearance.\n\n\"Two accomplices, for all that,\" said Beautrelet, in conclusion, \"or\nrather three, with the old woman. It is a bag worth having. And, if we\nlose no time--\"\n\nHe jumped on his bicycle, rode to Eguzon, woke up the gendarmerie, set\nthem all going, made them sound the boot and saddle and returned to\nCrozant at eight o'clock, accompanied by the sergeant and eight\ngendarmes. Two of the men were posted beside the gipsy-van. Two others\ntook up their positions outside the postern-door. The last four,\ncommanded by their chief and accompanied by Beautrelet and Valmeras,\nmarched to the main entrance of the castle.\n\nToo late. The door was wide open. A peasant told them that he had seen\na motor car drive out of the castle an hour before.\n\nIndeed, the search led to no result. In all probability, the gang had\ninstalled themselves there picnic fashion. A few clothes were found, a\nlittle linen, some household implements; and that was all.\n\nWhat astonished Beautrelet and Valmeras more was the disappearance of\nthe wounded man. They could not see the faintest trace of a struggle,\nnot even a drop of blood on the flagstones of the hall.\n\nAll said, there was no material evidence to prove the fleeting presence\nof Lupin at the Chateau de l'Aiguille; and the authorities would have\nbeen entitled to challenge the statements of Beautrelet and his father,\nof Valmeras and Mlle. de Saint-Veran, had they not ended by\ndiscovering, in a room next to that occupied by the young girl, some\nhalf-dozen exquisite bouquets with Arsene Lupin's card pinned to them,\nbouquets scorned by her, faded and forgotten--One of them, in addition\nto the card, contained a letter which Raymonde had not seen. That\nafternoon, when opened by the examining magistrate, it was found to\ncontain page upon page of prayers, entreaties, promises, threats,\ndespair, all the madness of a love that has encountered nothing but\ncontempt and repulsion.\n\nAnd the letter ended:\n\nI shall come on Tuesday evening, Raymonde. Reflect between now and\nthen. As for me, I will wait no longer. I am resolved on all.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nTuesday evening was the evening of the very day on which Beautrelet had\nreleased Mlle. de Saint-Veran from her captivity.\n\nThe reader will remember the extraordinary explosion of surprise and\nenthusiasm that resounded throughout the world at the news of that\nunexpected issue: Mlle. de Saint-Veran free! The pretty girl whom Lupin\ncoveted, to secure whom he had contrived his most Machiavellian\nschemes, snatched from his claws! Free also Beautrelet's father, whom\nLupin had chosen as a hostage in his extravagant longing for the\narmistice demanded by the needs of his passion! They were both free,\nthe two prisoners! And the secret of the Hollow Needle was known,\npublished, flung to the four corners of the world!\n\nThe crowd amused itself with a will. Ballads were sold and sung about\nthe defeated adventurer: Lupin's Little Love-Affairs!--Arsene's Piteous\nSobs!--The Lovesick Burglar! The Pickpocket's Lament!--They were cried\non the boulevards and hummed in the artists' studios.\n\nRaymonde, pressed with questions and pursued by interviewers, replied\nwith the most extreme reserve. But there was no denying the letter, or\nthe bouquets of flowers, or any part of the pitiful story! Then and\nthere, Lupin, scoffed and jeered at, toppled from his pedestal.\n\nAnd Beautrelet became the popular idol. He had foretold everything,\nthrown light on everything. The evidence which Mlle. de Saint-Veran\ngave before the examining magistrate confirmed, down to the smallest\ndetail, the hypothesis imagined by Isidore. Reality seemed to submit,\nin every point, to what he had decreed beforehand. Lupin had found his\nmaster.--\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeautrelet insisted that his father, before returning to his mountains\nin Savoy, should take a few months' rest in the sunshine, and himself\nescorted him and Mlle. de Saint-Veran to the outskirts of Nice, where\nthe Comte de Gesvres and his daughter Suzanne were already settled for\nthe winter. Two days later, Valmeras brought his mother to see his new\nfriends and they thus composed a little colony grouped around the Villa\nde Gesvres and watched over day and night by half a dozen men engaged\nby the comte.\n\nEarly in October, Beautrelet, once more the sixth-form pupil, returned\nto Paris to resume the interrupted course of his studies and to prepare\nfor his examinations. And life began again, calmer, this time, and free\nfrom incident. What could happen, for that matter. Was the war not over?\n\nLupin, on his side, must have felt this very clearly, must have felt\nthat there was nothing left for him but to resign himself to the\naccomplished fact; for, one fine day, his two other victims, Ganimard\nand Holmlock Shears, made their reappearance. Their return to the life\nof this planet, however, was devoid of any sort of glamor or\nfascination. An itinerant rag-man picked them up on the Quai des\nOrfevres, opposite the headquarters of police. Both of them were\ngagged, bound and fast asleep.\n\nAfter a week of complete bewilderment, they succeeded in recovering the\ncontrol of their thought and told--or rather Ganimard told, for Shears\nwrapped himself in a fierce and stubborn silence--how they had made a\nvoyage of circumnavigation round the coast of Africa on board the yacht\nHirondelle, a voyage combining amusement with instruction, during which\nthey could look upon themselves as free, save for a few hours which\nthey spent at the bottom of the hold, while the crew went on shore at\noutlandish ports.\n\nAs for their landing on the Quai des Orfevres, they remembered nothing\nabout it and had probably been asleep for many days before.\n\nThis liberation of the prisoners was the final confession of defeat. By\nceasing to fight, Lupin admitted it without reserve.\n\nOne incident, moreover, made it still more glaring, which was the\nengagement of Louis Valmeras and Mlle. de Saint-Veran. In the intimacy\ncreated between them by the new conditions under which they lived, the\ntwo young people fell in love with each other. Valmeras loved\nRaymonde's melancholy charm; and she, wounded by life, greedy for\nprotection, yielded before the strength and energy of the man who had\ncontributed so gallantly to her preservation.\n\nThe wedding day was awaited with a certain amount of anxiety. Would\nLupin not try to resume the offensive? Would he accept with a good\ngrace the irretrievable loss of the woman he loved? Twice or three\ntimes, suspicious-looking people were seen prowling round the villa;\nand Valmeras even had to defend himself one evening against a so-called\ndrunken man, who fired a pistol at him and sent a bullet through his\nhat. But, in the end, the ceremony was performed at the appointed hour\nand day and Raymonde de Saint-Veran became Mme. Louis Valmeras.\n\nIt was as though Fate herself had taken sides with Beautrelet and\ncountersigned the news of victory. This was so apparent to the crowd\nthat his admirers now conceived the notion of entertaining him at a\nbanquet to celebrate his triumph and Lupin's overthrow. It was a great\nidea and aroused general enthusiasm. Three hundred tickets were sold in\nless than a fortnight. Invitations were issued to the public schools of\nParis, to send two sixth-form pupils apiece. The press sang paeans. The\nbanquet was what it could not fail to be, an apotheosis.\n\nBut it was a charming and simple apotheosis, because Beautrelet was its\nhero. His presence was enough to bring things back to their due\nproportion. He showed himself modest, as usual, a little surprised at\nthe excessive cheering, a little embarrassed by the extravagant\npanegyrics in which he was pronounced greater than the most illustrious\ndetectives--a little embarrassed, but also not a little touched.\n\nHe said as much in a few words that pleased all his hearers and with\nthe shyness of a child that blushes when you look at it. He spoke of\nhis delight, of his pride. And really, reasonable and self-controlled\nas he was, this was for him a moment of never-to-be-forgotten\nexultation. He smiled to his friends, to his fellow-Jansonians, to\nValmeras, who had come specially to give him a cheer, to M. de Gesvres,\nto his father.\n\nWhen he had finished speaking; and while he still held his glass in his\nhand, a sound of voices came from the other end of the room and some\none was gesticulating and waving a newspaper. Silence was restored and\nthe importunate person sat down again: but a thrill of curiosity ran\nround the table, the newspaper was passed from hand to hand and, each\ntime that one of the guests cast his eyes upon the page at which it was\nopened, exclamations followed:\n\n\"Read it! Read it!\" they cried from the opposite side.\n\nThe people were leaving their seats at the principal table. M.\nBeautrelet went and took the paper and handed it to his son.\n\n\"Read it out! Read it out!\" they cried, louder.\n\nAnd others said:\n\n\"Listen! He's going to read it! Listen!\"\n\nBeautrelet stood facing his audience, looked in the evening paper which\nhis father had given him for the article that was causing all this\nuproar and, suddenly, his eyes encountering a heading underlined in\nblue pencil, he raised his hand to call for silence and began in a loud\nvoice to read a letter addressed to the editor by M. Massiban, of the\nAcademy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. His voice broke and fell,\nlittle by little, as he read those stupefying revelations, which\nreduced all his efforts to nothing, upset his notions concerning the\nHollow Needle and proved the vanity of his struggle with Arsene Lupin:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir:\n\nOn the 17th of March, 1679, there appeared a little book with the\nfollowing title: The Mystery of the Hollow Needle. The Whole Truth now\nfirst exhibited. One hundred copies printed by myself for the\ninstruction of the Court.\n\nAt nine o'clock on the morning of that day, the author, a very young\nman, well-dressed, whose name has remained unknown, began to leave his\nbook on the principal persons at court. At ten o'clock, when he had\nfulfilled four of these errands, he was arrested by a captain in the\nguards, who took him to the king's closet and forthwith set off in\nsearch of the four copies distributed.\n\nWhen the hundred copies were got together, counted, carefully looked\nthrough and verified, the king himself threw them into the fire and\nburnt them, all but one, which he kept for his own purposes.\n\nThen he ordered the captain of the guards to take the author of the\nbook to M. de Saint-Mars, who confined his prisoner first at Pignerol\nand then in the fortress of the Ile Sainte-Marguerite. This man was\nobviously no other than the famous Man with the Iron Mask.\n\nThe truth would never have been known, or at least a part of the truth,\nif the captain in the guards had not been present at the interview and\nif, when the king's back was turned, he had not been tempted to\nwithdraw another of the copies from the chimney, before the fire got to\nit.\n\nSix months later, the captain was found dead on the highroad between\nGaillon and Mantes. His murderers had stripped him of all his apparel,\nforgetting, however, in his right boot a jewel which was discovered\nthere afterward, a diamond of the first water and of considerable value.\n\nAmong his papers was found a sheet in his handwriting, in which he did\nnot speak of the book snatched from the flames, but gave a summary of\nthe earlier chapters. It referred to a secret which was known to the\nKings of England, which was lost by them when the crown passed from the\npoor fool, Henry VI., to the Duke of York, which was revealed to\nCharles VII., King of France, by Joan of Arc and which, becoming a\nState secret, was handed down from sovereign to sovereign by means of a\nletter, sealed anew on each occasion, which was found in the deceased\nmonarch's death-bed with this superscription: \"For the King of France.\"\n\nThis secret concerned the existence and described the whereabouts of a\ntremendous treasure, belonging to the kings, which increased in\ndimensions from century to century.\n\nOne hundred and fourteen years later, Louis XVI., then a prisoner in\nthe Temple, took aside one of the officers whose duty it was to guard\nthe royal family, and asked:\n\n\"Monsieur, had you not an ancestor who served as a captain under my\npredecessor, the Great King?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"Well, could you be relied upon--could you be relied upon--\"\n\nHe hesitated. The officer completed the sentence:\n\n\"Not to betray your Majesty! Oh, sire!--\"\n\n\"Then listen to me.\"\n\nHe took from his pocket a little book of which he tore out one of the\nlast pages. But, altering his mind:\n\n\"No, I had better copy it--\"\n\nHe seized a large sheet of paper and tore it in such a way as to leave\nonly a small rectangular space, on which he copied five lines of dots,\nletters and figures from the printed page. Then, after burning the\nlatter, he folded the manuscript sheet in four, sealed it with red wax,\nand gave it to the officer.\n\n\"Monsieur, after my death, you must hand this to the Queen and say to\nher, 'From the King, madame--for Your Majesty and for your son.' If she\ndoes not understand--\"\n\n\"If she does not understand, sire--\"\n\n\"You must add, 'It concerns the secret, the secret of the Needle.' The\nQueen will understand.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, he flung the book into the embers\nglowing on the hearth.\n\nHe ascended the scaffold on the 21st of January.\n\nIt took the officer several months, in consequence of the removal of\nthe Queen to the Conciergerie, before he could fulfil the mission with\nwhich he was entrusted. At last, by dint of cunning intrigues, he\nsucceeded, one day, in finding himself in the presence of Marie\nAntoinette.\n\nSpeaking so that she could just hear him, he said:\n\n\"Madame, from the late King, your husband, for Your Majesty and your\nson.\"\n\nAnd he gave her the sealed letter.\n\nShe satisfied herself that the jailers could not see her, broke the\nseals, appeared surprised at the sight of those undecipherable lines\nand then, all at once, seemed to understand.\n\nShe smiled bitterly and the officer caught the words:\n\n\"Why so late?\"\n\nShe hesitated. Where should she hide this dangerous document? At last,\nshe opened her book of hours and slipped the paper into a sort of\nsecret pocket contrived between the leather of the binding and the\nparchment that covered it.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she had asked.\n\nIt is, in fact, probable that this document, if it could have saved\nher, came too late, for, in the month of October next, Queen Marie\nAntoinette ascended the scaffold in her turn.\n\nNow the officer, when going through his family papers, came upon his\nancestor's manuscript. From that moment, he had but one idea, which was\nto devote his leisure to elucidating this strange problem. He read all\nthe Latin authors, studied all the chronicles of France and those of\nthe neighboring countries, visited the monasteries, deciphered\naccount-books, cartularies, treaties; and, in this way, succeeded in\ndiscovering certain references scattered over the ages.\n\nIn Book III of Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War (MS. edition,\nAlexandria), it is stated that, after the defeat of Veridovix by G.\nTitullius Sabinus, the chief of the Caleti was brought before Caesar\nand that, for his ransom, he revealed the secret of the Needle--\n\nThe Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, between Charles the Simple and\nRollo, the chief of the Norse barbarians, gives Rollo's name followed\nby all his titles, among which we read that of Master of the Secret of\nthe Needle.\n\nThe Saxon Chronicle (Gibson's edition, page 134), speaking of William\nthe Conqueror, says that the staff of his banner ended in a steel point\npierced with an eye, like a needle.\n\nIn a rather ambiguous phrase in her examination, Joan of Arc admits\nthat she has still a great secret to tell the King of France. To which\nher judges reply, \"Yes, we know of what you speak; and that, Joan, is\nwhy you shall die the death.\"\n\nPhilippe de Comines mentions it in connection with Louis XI., and,\nlater, Sully in connection with Henry IV.: \"By the virtue of the\nNeedle!\" the good king sometimes swears.\n\nBetween these two, Francis I., in a speech addressed to the notables of\nthe Havre, in 1520, uttered this phrase, which has been handed down in\nthe diary of a Honfleur burgess; \"The Kings of France carry secrets\nthat often decide the conduct of affairs and the fate of towns.\"\n\nAll these quotations, all the stories relating to the Iron Mask, the\ncaptain of the guards and his descendant, I have found to-day in a\npamphlet written by this same descendant and published in the month of\nJune, 1815, just before or just after the battle of Waterloo, in a\nperiod, therefore, of great upheavals, in which the revelations which\nit contained were likely to pass unperceived.\n\nWhat is the value of this pamphlet? Nothing, you will tell me, and we\nmust attach no credit to it. And this is the impression which I myself\nwould have carried away, if it had not occurred to me to open Caesar's\nCommentaries at the chapter given. What was my astonishment when I came\nupon the phrase quoted in the little book before me! And it was the\nsame thing with the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, with the Saxon\nChronicle, with the examination of Joan of Arc, in short, with all that\nI have been able to verify up to the present.\n\nLastly, there is an even more precise fact related by the author of the\npamphlet of 1815. During the French campaign, he being then an officer\nunder Napoleon, his horse dropped dead, one evening, and he rang at the\ndoor of a castle where he was received by an old knight of St. Louis.\nAnd, in the course of conversation with the old man, he learnt that\nthis castle, standing on the bank of the Creuse, was called the Chateau\nde l'Aiguille, that it had been built and christened by Louis XIV., and\nthat, by his express order, it was adorned with turrets and with a\nspire which represented the Needle. As its date it bore, it must still\nbear, the figure 1680.\n\n1680! One year after the publication of the book and the imprisonment\nof the Iron Mask! Everything was now explained: Louis XIV., foreseeing\nthat the secret might be noised abroad, had built and named that castle\nso as to offer the quidnuncs a natural explanation of the ancient\nmystery. The Hollow Needle! A castle with pointed bell-turrets standing\non the bank of the Creuse and belonging to the King. People would at\nonce think that they had the key to the riddle and all enquiries would\ncease.\n\nThe calculation was just, seeing that, more than two centuries later,\nM. Beautrelet fell into the trap. And this, Sir, is what I was leading\nup to in writing this letter. If Lupin, under the name of Anfredi,\nrented from M. Valmeras the Chateau de l'Aiguille on the bank of the\nCreuse; if, admitting the success of the inevitable investigations of\nM. Beautrelet, he lodged his two prisoners there, it was because he\nadmitted the success of the inevitable researches made by M. Beautrelet\nand because, with the object of obtaining the peace for which he had\nasked, he laid for M. Beautrelet precisely what we may call the\nhistoric trap of Louis XIV.\n\nAnd hence we come to this undeniable conclusion, that he, Lupin, by his\nunaided lights, without possessing any other facts than those which we\npossess, managed by means of the witchcraft of a really extraordinary\ngenius, to decipher the undecipherable document; and that he, Lupin,\nthe last heir of the Kings of France, knows the royal mystery of the\nHollow Needle!\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere ended the letter. But, for some minutes, from the passage that\nreferred to the Chateau de l'Aiguille onward, it was not Beautrelet's\nbut another voice that read it aloud. Realizing his defeat, crushed\nunder the weight of his humiliation, Isidore had dropped the newspaper\nand sunk into his chair, with his face buried in his hands.\n\nPanting, shaken with excitement by this incredible story, the crowd had\ncome gradually nearer and was now pressing round.\n\nWith a thrill of anguish, they waited for the words which he would say\nin reply, the objections which he would raise.\n\nHe did not stir.\n\nValmeras gently uncrossed his hands and raised his head.\n\nIsidore Beautrelet was weeping.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTHE TREATISE OF THE NEEDLE\n\n\nIt is four o'clock in the morning. Isidore has not returned to the\nLycee Janson. He has no intention of returning before the end of the\nwar of extermination which he has declared against Lupin. This much he\nswore to himself under his breath, while his friends drove off with\nhim, all faint and bruised, in a cab.\n\nA mad oath! An absurd and illogical war! What can he do, a single,\nunarmed stripling, against that phenomenon of energy and strength? On\nwhich side is he to attack him? He is unassailable. Where to wound him?\nHe is invulnerable. Where to get at him? He is inaccessible.\n\nFour o'clock in the morning. Isidore has again accepted his\nschoolfellow's hospitality. Standing before the chimney in his bedroom,\nwith his elbows flat on the mantel-shelf and his two fists under his\nchin, he stares at his image in the looking-glass. He is not crying\nnow, he can shed no more tears, nor fling himself about on his bed, nor\ngive way to despair, as he has been doing for the last two hours and\nmore. He wants to think, to think and understand.\n\nAnd he does not remove his eyes from those same eyes reflected in the\nglass, as though he hoped to double his powers of thought by\ncontemplating his pensive image, as though he hoped to find at the back\nof that mirrored Beautrelet the unsolvable solution of what he does not\nfind within himself.\n\nHe stands thus until six o'clock, and, little by little, the question\npresents itself to his mind with the strictness of an equation, bare\nand dry and cleared of all the details that complicate and obscure it.\n\nYes, he has made a mistake. Yes, his reading of the document is all\nwrong. The word aiguille does not point to the castle on the Creuse.\nAlso, the word demoiselles cannot be applied to Raymonde de Saint-Veran\nand her cousin, because the text of the document dates back for\ncenturies.\n\nTherefore, all must be done over again, from the beginning.\n\nHow?\n\nOne piece of evidence alone would be incontestible: the book published\nunder Louis XIV. Now of those hundred copies printed by the person who\nwas presumed to be the Man with the Iron Mask only two escaped the\nflames. One was purloined by the captain of the guards and lost. The\nother was kept by Louis XIV., handed down to Louis XV., and burnt by\nLouis XVI. But a copy of the essential page, the page containing the\nsolution of the problem, or at least a cryptographic solution, was\nconveyed to Marie Antoinette, who slipped it into the binding of her\nbook of hours. What has become of this paper? Is it the one which\nBeautrelet has held in his hands and which Lupin recovered from him\nthrough Bredoux, the magistrate's clerk? Or is it still in Marie\nAntoinette's book of hours? And the question resolves itself into this:\nwhat has become of the Queen's book of hours?\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter taking a short rest, Beautrelet consulted his friend's father, an\nold and experienced collector, who was often called upon officially to\ngive an expert opinion and who had quite lately been invited to advise\nthe director of one of our museums on the drawing up of the catalogue.\n\n\"Marie Antoinette's book of hours?\" he exclaimed. \"Why, the Queen left\nit to her waiting-woman, with secret instructions to forward it to\nCount Fersen. After being piously preserved in the count's family, it\nhas been, for the last five years, in a glass case--\"\n\n\"A glass case?\"\n\n\"In the Musee Carnavalet, quite simply.\"\n\n\"When will the museum be open?\"\n\n\"At twenty minutes from now, as it is every morning.\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nIsidore and his friend jumped out of a cab at the moment when the doors\nof Madame de Sevigne's old mansion were opening.\n\n\"Hullo! M. Beautrelet!\"\n\nA dozen voices greeted his arrival. To his great surprise, he\nrecognized the whole crowd of reporters who were following up \"the\nmystery of the Hollow Needle.\" And one of them exclaimed:\n\n\"Funny, isn't it, that we should all have had the same idea? Take care,\nArsene Lupin may be among us!\"\n\nThey entered the museum together. The director was at once informed,\nplaced himself entirely at their disposal, took them to the glass case\nand showed them a poor little volume, devoid of all ornament, which\ncertainly had nothing royal about it. Nevertheless, they were overcome\nby a certain emotion at the sight of this object which the Queen had\ntouched in those tragic days, which her eyes, red with tears, had\nlooked upon--And they dared not take it and hunt through it: it was as\nthough they feared lest they should be guilty of a sacrilege--\n\n\"Come, M. Beautrelet, it's your business!\"\n\nHe took the book with an anxious gesture. The description corresponded\nwith that given by the author of the pamphlet. Outside was a parchment\ncover, dirty, stained and worn in places, and under it, the real\nbinding, in stiff leather. With what a thrill Beautrelet felt for the\nhidden pocket! Was it a fairy tale? Or would he find the document\nwritten by Louis XVI. and bequeathed by the queen to her fervent\nadmirer?\n\nAt the first page, on the upper side of the book, there was no\nreceptacle.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Nothing,\" they echoed, palpitating with excitement.\n\nBut, at the last page, forcing back the book a little, he at once saw\nthat the parchment was not stuck to the binding. He slipped his fingers\nin between--there was something--yes, he felt something--a paper--\n\n\"Oh!\" he gasped, in an accent almost of pain. \"Here--is it possible?\"\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" they cried. \"What are you waiting for?\"\n\nHe drew out a sheet folded in two.\n\n\"Well, read it!--There are words in red ink--Look!--it might be\nblood--pale, faded blood--Read it!--\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe read:\n\nTo you, Fersen. For my son. 16 October, 1793.\n\nMARIE ANTOINETTE.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd suddenly Beautrelet gave a cry of stupefaction. Under the queen's\nsignature there were--there were two words, in black ink, underlined\nwith a flourish--two words:\n\nARSENE LUPIN.\n\nAll, in turns, took the sheet of paper and the same cry escaped from\nthe lips of all of them:\n\n\"Marie Antoinette!--Arsene Lupin!\"\n\nA great silence followed. That double signature: those two names\ncoupled together, discovered hidden in the book of hours; that relic in\nwhich the poor queen's desperate appeal had slumbered for more than a\ncentury: that horrible date of the 16th of October, 1793, the day on\nwhich the Royal head fell: all of this was most dismally and\ndisconcertingly tragic.\n\n\"Arsene Lupin!\" stammered one of the voices, thus emphasizing the scare\nthat underlay the sight of that demoniacal name at the foot of the\nhallowed page.\n\n\"Yes, Arsene Lupin,\" repeated Beautrelet. \"The Queen's friend was\nunable to understand her desperate dying appeal. He lived with the\nkeepsake in his possession which the woman whom he loved had sent him\nand he never guessed the reason of that keepsake. Lupin discovered\neverything, on the other hand--and took it.\"\n\n\"Took what?\"\n\n\"The document, of course! The document written by Louis XVI.; and it is\nthat which I held in my hands. The same appearance, the same shape, the\nsame red seals. I understand why Lupin would not leave me a document\nwhich I could turn to account by merely examining the paper, the seals\nand so on.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Well, then, since the document is genuine, since I have, with my own\neyes, seen the marks of the red seals, since Marie Antoinette herself\nassures me, by these few words in her hand, that the whole story of the\npamphlet, as printed by M. Massiban, is correct, because a problem of\nthe Hollow Needle really exists, I am now certain to succeed.\"\n\n\"But how? Whether genuine or not, the document is of no use to you if\nyou do not manage to decipher it, because Louis XVI. destroyed the book\nthat gave the explanation.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the other copy, which King Louis XVI.'s captain of the guards\nsnatched from the flames, was not destroyed.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Prove the contrary.\"\n\nAfter uttering this defiance, Beautrelet was silent for a time and\nthen, slowly, with his eyes closed, as though trying to fix and sum up\nhis thoughts, he said:\n\n\"Possessing the secret, the captain of the guards begins by revealing\nit bit by bit in the journal found by his descendant. Then comes\nsilence. The answer to the riddle is withheld. Why? Because the\ntemptation to make use of the secret creeps over him little by little\nand he gives way to it. A proof? His murder. A further proof? The\nmagnificent jewel found upon him, which he must undoubtedly have taken\nfrom some royal treasure the hiding-place of which, unknown to all,\nwould just constitute the mystery of the Hollow Needle. Lupin conveyed\nas much to me; Lupin was not lying.\"\n\n\"Then what conclusion do you draw, Beautrelet?\"\n\n\"I draw this conclusion, my friends, that it be a good thing to\nadvertise this story as much as possible, so that people may know,\nthrough all the papers, that we are looking for a book entitled The\nTreatise of the Needle. It may be fished out from the back shelves of\nsome provincial library.\"\n\nThe paragraph was drawn up forthwith; and Beautrelet set to work at\nonce, without even waiting for it to produce a result. A first scent\nsuggested itself: the murder was committed near Gaillon. He went there\nthat same day. Certainly, he did not hope to reconstruct a crime\nperpetrated two hundred years ago. But, all the same, there are crimes\nthat leave traces in the memories, in the traditions of a countryside.\nThey are recorded in the local chronicles. One day, some provincial\narchaeologist, some lover of old legends, some student of the minor\nincidents of the life of the past makes them the subject of an article\nin a newspaper or of a communication to the academy of his departmental\ntown.\n\nBeautrelet saw three or four of these archaeologists. With one of them\nin particular, an old notary, he examined the prison records, the\nledgers of the old bailiwicks and the parish registers. There was no\nentry referring to the murder of a captain of the guards in the\nseventeenth century.\n\nHe refused to be discouraged and continued his search in Paris, where\nthe magistrate's examination might have taken place. His efforts came\nto nothing.\n\nBut the thought of another track sent him off in a fresh direction. Was\nthere no chance of finding out the name of that captain whose\ndescendant served in the armies of the Republic and was quartered in\nthe Temple during the imprisonment of the Royal family? By dint of\npatient working, he ended by making out a list in which two names at\nleast presented an almost complete resemblance: M. de Larbeyrie, under\nLouis XIV., and Citizen Larbrie, under the Terror.\n\nThis already was an important point. He stated it with precision in a\nnote which he sent to the papers, asking for any information concerning\nthis Larbeyrie or his descendants.\n\nIt was M. Massiban, the Massiban of the pamphlet, the member of the\nInstitute, who replied to him:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nSIR:\n\nAllow me to call your attention to the following passage of Voltaire,\nwhich I came upon in his manuscript of Le Siecle de Louis XIV. (Chapter\nXXV: Particularites et anecdotes du regne). The passage has been\nsuppressed in all the printed editions:\n\n\"I have heard it said by the late M. de Caumartin, intendant of\nfinance, who was a friend of Chamillard the minister, that the King one\nday left hurriedly in his carriage at the news that M. de Larbeyrie had\nbeen murdered and robbed of some magnificent jewels. He seemed greatly\nexcited and repeated:\n\n\"'All is lost--all is lost--'\n\n\"In the following year, the son of this Larbeyrie and his daughter, who\nhad married the Marquis de Velines, were banished to their estates in\nProvence and Brittany. We cannot doubt that there is something peculiar\nin this.\"\n\n\nI, in my turn, will add that we can doubt it all the less inasmuch as\nM. de Chamillard, according to Voltaire, WAS THE LAST MINISTER WHO\nPOSSESSED THE STRANGE SECRET OF THE IRON MASK.\n\nYou will see for yourself, Sir, the profit that can be derived from\nthis passage and the evident link established between the two\nadventures. As for myself, I will not venture to imagine any very exact\nsurmise as regards the conduct, the suspicions, and the apprehensions\nof Louis XIV. in these circumstances; but, on the other hand, seeing\nthat M. de Larbeyrie left a son, who was probably the grandfather of\nLarbrie the citizen-officer, and also a daughter, is it not permissible\nto suppose that a part of the papers left by Larbeyrie came to the\ndaughter and that among these papers was the famous copy which the\ncaptain of the guards saved from the flames?\n\nI have consulted the Country-house Year-book. There is a Baron de\nVelines living not far from Rennes. Could he be a descendant of the\nmarquis? At any rate, I wrote to him yesterday, on chance, to ask if he\nhad not in his possession a little old book bearing on its title-page\nthe word aiguille; and I am awaiting his reply.\n\nIt would give me the greatest pleasure to talk of all these matters\nwith you. If you can spare the time, come and see me.\n\nI am, Sir, etc., etc.\n\nP.S.--Of course, I shall not communicate these little discoveries to\nthe press. Now that you are near the goal, discretion is essential.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeautrelet absolutely agreed. He even went further: to two journalists\nwho were worrying him that morning he gave the most fanciful\nparticulars as to his plans and his state of mind.\n\nIn the afternoon, he hurried round to see Massiban, who lived at 17,\nQuai Voltaire. To his great surprise, he was told that M. Massiban had\ngone out of town unexpectedly, leaving a note for him in case he should\ncall. Isidore opened it and read:\n\n     I have received a telegram which gives me\n     some hope. So I am leaving town and shall sleep\n     at Rennes. You might take the evening train and,\n     without stopping at Rennes, go on to the little\n     station of Velines. We would meet at the castle,\n     which is two miles and a half from the station.\n\nThe programme appealed to Beautrelet, and especially the idea that he\nwould reach the castle at almost the same time as Massiban, for he\nfeared some blunder on the part of that inexperienced man. He went back\nto his friend and spent the rest of the day with him. In the evening,\nhe took the Brittany express and got out at Velines as six o'clock in\nthe morning.\n\nHe did the two and a half miles, between bushy woods, on foot. He could\nsee the castle, perched on a height, from a distance: it was a hybrid\nedifice, a mixture of the Renascence and Louis Philippe styles, but it\nbore a stately air, nevertheless, with its four turrets and its\nivy-mantled draw-bridge.\n\nIsidore felt his heart beat as he approached. Was he really nearing the\nend of his race? Did the castle contain the key to the mystery?\n\nHe was not without fear. It all seemed too good to be true; and he\nasked himself if he was not once more acting in obedience to some\ninfernal plan contrived by Lupin, if Massiban was not for instance, a\ntool in the hands of his enemy. He burst out laughing:\n\n\"Tut, tut, I'm becoming absurd! One would really think that Lupin was\nan infallible person who foresees everything, a sort of divine\nomnipotence against whom nothing can prevail! Dash it all, Lupin makes\nhis mistakes; Lupin, too, is at the mercy of circumstances; Lupin has\nan occasional slip! And it is just because of his slip in losing the\ndocument that I am beginning to have the advantage of him. Everything\nstarts from that. And his efforts, when all is said, serve only to\nrepair the first blunder.\"\n\nAnd blithely, full of confidence, Beautrelet rang the bell.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" said the servant who opened the door.\n\n\"Can I see the Baron de Velines?\"\n\nAnd he gave the man his card.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron is not up yet, but, if monsieur will wait--\"\n\n\"Has not some one else been asking for him, a gentleman with a white\nbeard and a slight stoop?\" asked Beautrelet, who knew Massiban's\nappearance from the photographs in the newspapers.\n\n\"Yes, the gentleman came about ten minutes ago; I showed him into the\ndrawing room. If monsieur will come this way--\"\n\nThe interview between Massiban and Beautrelet was of the most cordial\ncharacter. Isidore thanked the old man for the first-rate information\nwhich he owed to him and Massiban expressed his admiration for\nBeautrelet in the warmest terms. Then they exchanged impressions on the\ndocument, on their prospects of discovering the book; and Massiban\nrepeated what he had heard at Rennes regarding M. de Velines. The baron\nwas a man of sixty, who had been left a widower many years ago and who\nled a very retired life with his daughter, Gabrielle de Villemon. This\nlady had just suffered a cruel blow through the loss of her husband and\nher eldest son, both of whom had died as the result of a motor-car\naccident.\n\n\"Monsieur le baron begs the gentlemen to be good enough to come\nupstairs.\"\n\nThe servant led the way to the first floor, to a large, bare-walled\nroom, very simply furnished with desks, pigeon-holes and tables covered\nwith papers and account-books.\n\nThe baron received them very affably and with the volubility often\ndisplayed by people who live too much alone. They had great difficulty\nin explaining the object of their visit.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know, you wrote to me about it, M. Massiban. It has\nsomething to do with a book about a needle, hasn't it, a book which is\nsupposed to have come down to me from my ancestors?\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"I may as well tell you that my ancestors and I have fallen out. They\nhad funny ideas in those days. I belong to my own time. I have broken\nwith the past.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Beautrelet, impatiently, \"but have you no recollection of\nhaving seen the book?--\"\n\n\"Certainly, I said so in my telegram,\" he exclaimed, addressing M.\nMassiban, who, in his annoyance, was walking up and down the room and\nlooking out of the tall windows. \"Certainly--or, at least, my daughter\nthought she had seen the title among the thousands of books that lumber\nup the library, upstairs--for I don't care about reading myself--I\ndon't even read the papers. My daughter does, sometimes, but only when\nthere is nothing the matter with Georges, her remaining son! As for me,\nas long as my tenants pay their rents and my leases are kept up--! You\nsee my account-books: I live in them, gentlemen; and I confess that I\nknow absolutely nothing whatever about that story of which you wrote to\nme in your letter, M. Massiban--\"\n\nIsidore Beautrelet, nerve-shattered at all this talk, interrupted him\nbluntly:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur, but the book--\"\n\n\"My daughter has looked for it. She looked for it all day yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, she found it; she found it a few hours ago. When you arrived--\"\n\n\"And where is it?\"\n\n\"Where is it? Why, she put it on that table--there it is--over there--\"\n\nIsidore gave a bound. At one end of the table, on a muddled heap of\npapers, lay a little book bound in red morocco. He banged his fist down\nupon it, as though he were forbidding anybody to touch it--and also a\nlittle as though he himself dared not take it up.\n\n\"Well!\" cried Massiban, greatly excited.\n\n\"I have it--here it is--we're there at last!\"\n\n\"But the title--are you sure?--\"\n\n\"Why, of course: look!\"\n\n\"Are you convinced? Have we mastered the secret at last?\"\n\n\"The front page--what does the front page say?\"\n\n\"Read: The Whole Truth now first exhibited. One hundred copies printed\nby myself for the instruction of the Court.\"\n\n\"That's it, that's it,\" muttered Massiban, in a hoarse voice. \"It's the\ncopy snatched from the flames! It's the very book which Louis XIV.\ncondemned.\"\n\nThey turned over the pages. The first part set forth the explanations\ngiven by Captain de Larbeyrie in his journal.\n\n\"Get on, get on!\" said Beautrelet, who was in a hurry to come to the\nsolution.\n\n\"Get on? What do you mean? Not at all! We know that the Man with the\nIron Mask was imprisoned because he knew and wished to divulge the\nsecret of the Royal house of France. But how did he know it? And why\ndid he wish to divulge it? Lastly, who was that strange personage? A\nhalf-brother of Louis XIV., as Voltaire maintained, or Mattioli, the\nItalian minister, as the modern critics declare? Hang it, those are\nquestions of the very first interest!\"\n\n\"Later, later,\" protested Beautrelet, feverishly turning the pages, as\nthough he feared that the book would fly out of his hands before he had\nsolved the riddle.\n\n\"But--\" said Massiban, who doted on historical details.\n\n\"We have plenty of time--afterward--let's see the explanation first--\"\n\nSuddenly Beautrelet stopped. The document! In the middle of a left-hand\npage, his eyes saw the five mysterious lines of dots and figures! He\nmade sure, with a glance, that the text was identical with that which\nhe had studied so long; the same arrangement of the signs, the same\nintervals that permitted of the isolation of the word demoiselles and\nthe separation of the two words aiguille and creuse.\n\nA short note preceded it:\n\nAll the necessary indications, it appears, were reduced by King Louis\nXIII. into a little table which I transcribe below.\n\nHere followed the table of dots and figures.\n\nThen came the explanation of the document itself. Beautrelet read, in a\nbroken voice:\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs will be seen, this table, even after we have changed the figures\ninto vowels, affords no light. One might say that, in order to decipher\nthe puzzle, we must first know it. It is, at most, a clue given to\nthose who know the paths of the labyrinth.\n\nLet us take this clue and proceed. I will guide you.\n\nThe fourth line first. The fourth line contains measurements and\nindications. By complying with the indications and noting the\nmeasurements set down, we inevitably attain our object, on condition,\nbe it understood, that we know where we are and whither we are going,\nin a word, that we are enlightened as to the real meaning of the Hollow\nNeedle. This is what we may learn from the first three lines. The first\nis so conceived to revenge myself on the King; I had warned him, for\nthat matter--\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeautrelet stopped, nonplussed.\n\n\"What? What is it?\" said Massiban.\n\n\"The words don't make sense.\"\n\n\"No more they do,\" replied Massiban. \"'The first is so conceived to\nrevenge myself on the King--' What can that mean?\"\n\n\"Damn!\" yelled Beautrelet.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Torn! Two pages! The next two pages! Look at the marks!\"\n\nHe trembled, shaking with rage and disappointment. Massiban bent\nforward.\n\n\"It is true--there are the ends of two pages left, like bookbinders'\nguards. The marks seem pretty fresh. They've not been cut, but torn\nout--torn out with violence. Look, all the pages at the end of the book\nhave been rumpled.\"\n\n\"But who can have done it? Who?\" moaned Isidore, wringing his hands. \"A\nservant? An accomplice?\"\n\n\"All the same, it may date back to a few months since,\" observed\nMassiban.\n\n\"Even so--even so--some one must have hunted out and taken the\nbook--Tell me, monsieur,\" cried Beautrelet, addressing the baron, \"is\nthere no one whom you suspect?\"\n\n\"We might ask my daughter.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--that's it--perhaps she will know.\"\n\nM. de Velines rang for the footman. A few minutes later, Mme. de\nVillemon entered. She was a young woman, with a sad and resigned face.\nBeautrelet at once asked her:\n\n\"You found this volume upstairs, madame, in the library?\"\n\n\"Yes, in a parcel of books that had not been uncorded.\"\n\n\"And you read it?\"\n\n\"Yes, last night.\"\n\n\"When you read it, were those two pages missing? Try and remember: the\ntwo pages following this table of figures and dots?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" she said, greatly astonished. \"There was no page\nmissing at all.\"\n\n\"Still, somebody has torn--\"\n\n\"But the book did not leave my room last night.\"\n\n\"And this morning?\"\n\n\"This morning, I brought it down here myself, when M. Massiban's\narrival was announced.\"\n\n\"Then--?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't understand--unless--but no.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Georges--my son--this morning--Georges was playing with the book.\"\n\nShe ran out headlong, accompanied by Beautrelet, Massiban and the\nbaron. The child was not in his room. They hunted in every direction.\nAt last, they found him playing behind the castle. But those three\npeople seemed so excited and called him so peremptorily to account that\nhe began to yell aloud.\n\nEverybody ran about to right and left. The servants were questioned. It\nwas an indescribable tumult. And Beautrelet received the awful\nimpression that the truth was ebbing away from him, like water\ntrickling through his fingers.\n\nHe made an effort to recover himself, took Mme. de Villemon's arm, and,\nfollowed by the baron and Massiban, led her back to the drawing room\nand said:\n\n\"The book is incomplete. Very well. There are two pages torn out; but\nyou read them, did you not, madame?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know what they contained?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Could you repeat it to us?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I read the book with a great deal of curiosity, but those\ntwo pages struck me in particular because the revelations were so very\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Well, then, speak madame, speak, I implore you! Those revelations are\nof exceptional importance. Speak, I beg of you: minutes lost are never\nrecovered. The Hollow Needle--\"\n\n\"Oh, it's quite simple. The Hollow Needle means--\"\n\nAt that moment, a footman entered the room:\n\n\"A letter for madame.\"\n\n\"Oh, but the postman has passed!\"\n\n\"A boy brought it.\"\n\nMme. de Villemon opened the letter, read it, and put her hand to her\nheart, turning suddenly livid and terrified, ready to faint.\n\nThe paper had slipped to the floor. Beautrelet picked it up and,\nwithout troubling to apologize, read:\n\n  Not a word! If you say a word, your son will\n  never wake again.\n\n\"My son--my son!\" she stammered, too weak even to go to the assistance\nof the threatened child.\n\nBeautrelet reassured her:\n\n\"It is not serious--it's a joke. Come, who could be interested?\"\n\n\"Unless,\" suggested Massiban, \"it was Arsene Lupin.\"\n\nBeautrelet made him a sign to hold his tongue. He knew quite well, of\ncourse, that the enemy was there, once more, watchful and determined;\nand that was just why he wanted to tear from Mme. de Villemon the\ndecisive words, so long awaited, and to tear them from her on the spot,\nthat very moment:\n\n\"I beseech you, madame, compose yourself. We are all here. There is not\nthe least danger.\"\n\nWould she speak? He thought so, he hoped so. She stammered out a few\nsyllables. But the door opened again. This time, the nurse entered. She\nseemed distraught:\n\n\"M. Georges--madame--M. Georges--!\"\n\nSuddenly, the mother recovered all her strength. Quicker than any of\nthem, and urged by an unfailing instinct, she rushed down the\nstaircase, across the hall and on to the terrace. There lay little\nGeorges, motionless, on a wicker chair.\n\n\"Well, what is it? He's asleep!--\"\n\n\"He fell asleep suddenly, madame,\" said the nurse. \"I tried to prevent\nhim, to carry him to his room. But he was fast asleep and his\nhands--his hands were cold.\"\n\n\"Cold!\" gasped the mother. \"Yes--it's true. Oh dear, oh dear--IF HE\nONLY WAKES UP!\"\n\nBeautrelet put his hand in his trousers pocket, seized the butt of his\nrevolver, cocked it with his forefinger, then suddenly produced the\nweapon and fired at Massiban.\n\nMassiban, as though he were watching the boy's movements, had avoided\nthe shot, so to speak, in advance. But already Beautrelet had sprung\nupon him, shouting to the servants:\n\n\"Help! It's Lupin!\"\n\nMassiban, under the weight of the impact, fell back into one of the\nwicker chairs. In a few seconds, he rose, leaving Beautrelet stunned,\nchoking; and, holding the young man's revolver in his hands:\n\n\"Good!--that's all right!--don't stir--you'll be like that for two or\nthree minutes--no more. But, upon my word, you took your time to\nrecognize me! Was my make-up as old Massiban so good as all that?\"\n\nHe was now standing straight up on his legs, his body squared, in a\nformidable attitude, and he grinned as he looked at the three petrified\nfootmen and the dumbfounded baron:\n\n\"Isidore, you've missed the chance of a lifetime. If you hadn't told\nthem I was Lupin, they'd have jumped on me. And, with fellows like\nthat, what would have become of me, by Jove, with four to one against\nme?\"\n\nHe walked up to them:\n\n\"Come, my lads, don't be afraid--I shan't hurt you. Wouldn't you like a\nsugar-stick apiece to screw your courage up? Oh, you, by the way, hand\nme back my hundred-franc note, will you? Yes, yes, I know you! You're\nthe one I bribed just now to give the letter to your mistress. Come\nhurry, you faithless servant.\"\n\nHe took the blue bank-note which the servant handed him and tore it\ninto tiny shreds:\n\n\"The price of treachery! It burns my fingers.\"\n\nHe took off his hat and, bowing very low before Mme. de Villemon:\n\n\"Will you forgive me, madame? The accidents of life--of mine\nespecially--often drive one to acts of cruelty for which I am the first\nto blush. But have no fear for your son: it's a mere prick, a little\npuncture in the arm which I gave him while we were questioning him. In\nan hour, at the most, you won't know that it happened. Once more, all\nmy apologies. But I had to make sure of your silence.\" He bowed again,\nthanked M. de Velines for his kind hospitality, took his cane, lit a\ncigarette, offered one to the baron, gave a circular sweep with his hat\nand, in a patronizing tone, said to Beautrelet:\n\n\"Good-bye, baby.\"\n\nAnd he walked away quietly, puffing the smoke of his cigarette into the\nservants' faces.\n\nBeautrelet waited for a few minutes. Mme. de Villemon, now calmer, was\nwatching by her son. He went up to her, with the intention of making\none last appeal to her. Their eyes met. He said nothing. He had\nunderstood that she would never speak now, whatever happened. There,\nonce more, in that mother's brain, the secret of the Hollow Needle lay\nburied as deeply as in the night of the past.\n\nThen he gave up and went away.\n\nIt was half-past ten. There was a train at eleven-fifty. He slowly\nfollowed the avenue in the park and turned into the road that led to\nthe station.\n\n\"Well, what do you say to that?\"\n\nIt was Massiban, or rather Lupin, who appeared out of the wood\nadjoining the road.\n\n\"Was it pretty well contrived, or was it not? Is your old friend great\non the tight-rope, or is he not? I'm sure that you haven't got over it,\neh, and that you're asking yourself whether the so-called Massiban,\nmember of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, ever existed.\nBut, of course, he exists. I'll even show him to you, if you're good.\nBut, first, let me give you back your revolver. You're looking to see\nif it's loaded? Certainly, my lad. There are five charges left, one of\nwhich would be enough to send me ad patres.--Well, so you're putting it\nin your pocket? Quite right. I prefer that to what you did up there.--A\nnasty little impulse, that, of yours!--Still, you're young, you\nsuddenly see--in a flash!--that you've once more been done by that\nconfounded Lupin and that he is standing there in front of you, at\nthree steps from you--and bang! You fire!--I'm not angry with you,\nbless your little heart! To prove it, I offer you a seat in my 100 h.p.\ncar. Will that suit you?\"\n\nHe put his fingers to his mouth and whistled.\n\nThe contrast was delicious between the venerable appearance of this\nelderly Massiban and the schoolboy ways and accent which Lupin was\nputting on. Beautrelet could not help laughing.\n\n\"He's laughed! He's laughed!\" cried Lupin, jumping for joy. \"You see,\nbaby, what you fall short in is the power of smiling; you're a trifle\nserious for your age. You're a very likeable boy, you have a charming\ncandor and simplicity--but you have no sense of humor.\" He placed\nhimself in front of him. \"Look here, bet you I make you cry! Do you\nknow how I was able to follow up all your inquiry, how I knew of the\nletter Massiban wrote you and his appointment to meet you this morning\nat the Chateau de Velines? Through the prattle of your friend, the one\nyou're staying with. You confide in that idiot and he loses no time,\nbut goes and tells everything to his best girl. And his best girl has\nno secrets for Lupin.--What did I tell you? I've made you feel, anyhow;\nyour eyes are quite wet!--Friendship betrayed: that upsets you, eh?\nUpon my word, you're wonderful! I could take you in my arms and hug\nyou! You always wear that look of astonishment which goes straight to\nmy heart.--I shall never forget the other evening at Gaillon, when you\nconsulted me.--Yes, I was the old notary!--But why don't you laugh,\nyoungster? As I said, you have no sense of a joke. Look here, what you\nwant is--what shall I call it?--imagination, imaginative impulse. Now,\nI'm full of imaginative impulse.\"\n\nA motor was heard panting not far off. Lupin seized Beautrelet roughly\nby the arm and in a cold voice, looking him straight in the eyes:\n\n\"You're going to keep quiet now, aren't you? You can see there's\nnothing to be done. Then what's the use of wasting your time and\nenergy? There are plenty of highway robbers in the world. Run after\nthem and let me be--if not!--It's settled, isn't it?\"\n\nHe shook him as though to enforce his will upon him. Then he grinned:\n\n\"Fool that I am! You leave me alone? You're not one of those who let\ngo! Oh, I don't know what restrains me! In half a dozen turns of the\nwrist, I could have you bound and gagged--and, in two hours, safe under\nlock and key, for some months to come. And then I could twist my thumbs\nin all security, withdraw to the peaceful retreat prepared for me by my\nancestors, the Kings of France, and enjoy the treasures which they have\nbeen good enough to accumulate for me. But no, it is doomed that I must\ngo on blundering to the end. I can't help it, we all have our\nweaknesses--and I have one for you. Besides, it's not done yet. From\nnow until you put your finger into the hollow of the Needle, a good\ndeal of water will flow under the bridges. Dash it all, it took me ten\ndays! Me! Lupin! You will want ten years, at least! There's that much\ndistance between us, after all!\"\n\nThe motor arrived, an immense closed car. Lupin opened the door and\nBeautrelet gave a cry. There was a man inside and that man was Lupin,\nor rather Massiban. Suddenly understanding, he burst out laughing.\nLupin said:\n\n\"Don't be afraid, he's sound asleep. I promised that you should see\nhim. Do you grasp the situation now? At midnight, I knew of your\nappointment at the castle. At seven in the morning, I was there. When\nMassiban passed, I had only to collect him--give him a tiny prick with\na needle--and the thing--was done. Sleep old chap, sleep away. We'll\nset you down on the slope. That's it--there--capital--right in the sun,\nthen you won't catch cold--good! And our hat in our hand.--Spare a\ncopper, kind gentleman!--Oh. my dear old Massiban, so you were after\nArsene Lupin!\"\n\nIt was really a huge joke to see the two Massibans face to face, one\nasleep with his head on his chest, the other seriously occupied in\npaying him every sort of attention and respect:\n\n\"Pity a poor blind man! There, Massiban, here's two sous and my\nvisiting-card. And now, my lads, off we go at the fourth speed. Do you\nhear, driver? You've got to do seventy-five miles an hour. Jump in,\nIsidore. There's a full sitting of the Institute to-day, and Massiban\nis to read a little paper, on I don't know what, at half-past three.\nWell, he'll read them his little paper. I'll dish them up a complete\nMassiban, more real than the real one, with my own ideas, on the\nlacustrine inscriptions. I don't have an opportunity of lecturing at\nthe Institute ever day!--Faster, chauffeur: we're only doing\nseventy-one and a half!--Are you afraid? Remember you're with\nLupin!--Ah, Isidore, and then people say that life is monotonous! Why,\nlife's an adorable thing, my boy; only one has to know--and I know--.\nWasn't it enough to make a man jump out of his skin for joy, just now,\nat the castle, when you were chattering with old Velines and I, up\nagainst the window, was tearing out the pages of the historic book? And\nthen, when you were questioning the Dame de Villemon about the Hollow\nNeedle! Would she speak? Yes, she would--no, she wouldn't--yes--no. It\ngave me gooseflesh, I assure you.--If she spoke, I should have to build\nup my life anew, the whole scaffolding was destroyed.--Would the\nfootman come in time? Yes--no--there he is.--But Beautrelet will unmask\nme! Never! He's too much of a flat! Yes, though--no--there, he's done\nit--no, he hasn't--yes--he's eyeing me--that's it--he's feeling for his\nrevolver!--Oh, the delight of it!--Isidore, you're talking too much,\nyou'll hurt yourself!--Let's have a snooze, shall we?--I'm dying of\nsleep.--Good night.\"\n\nBeautrelet looked at him. He seemed almost asleep already. He slept.\n\nThe motor-car, darting through space, rushed toward a horizon that was\nconstantly reached and as constantly retreated. There was no impression\nof towns, villages, fields or forests; simply space, space devoured,\nswallowed up.\n\nBeautrelet looked at his traveling companion, for a long time, with\neager curiosity and also with a keen wish to fathom his real character\nthrough the mask that covered it. And he thought of the circumstances\nthat confined them, like that, together, in the close contact of that\nmotor car. But, after the excitement and disappointment of the morning,\ntired in his turn, he too fell asleep.\n\nWhen he woke, Lupin was reading. Beautrelet leant over to see the title\nof the book. It was the Epistolae ad Lucilium of Seneca the philosopher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nFROM CAESAR TO LUPIN\n\n\nDash it all, it took me ten days! Me! Lupin!\n\nYou will want ten years, at least!--\n\nThese words, uttered by Lupin after leaving the Chateau de Velines, had\nno little influence on Beautrelet's conduct.\n\nThough very calm in the main and invariably master of himself, Lupin,\nnevertheless, was subject to moments of exaltation, of a more or less\nromantic expansiveness, at once theatrical and good-humored, when he\nallowed certain admissions to escape him, certain imprudent speeches\nwhich a boy like Beautrelet could easily turn to profit.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Beautrelet read one of these involuntary admissions\ninto that phrase. He was entitled to conclude that, if Lupin drew a\ncomparison between his own efforts and Beautrelet's in pursuit of the\ntruth about the Hollow Needle, it was because the two of them possessed\nidentical means of attaining their object, because Lupin had no\nelements of success different from those possessed by his adversary.\nThe chances were alike. Now, with the same chances, the same elements\nof success, the same means, ten days had been enough for Lupin.\n\nWhat were those elements, those means, those chances? They were\nreduced, when all was said, to a knowledge of the pamphlet published in\n1815, a pamphlet which Lupin, no doubt, like Massiban, had found by\naccident and thanks to which he had succeeded in discovering the\nindispensable document in Marie Antoinette's book of hours.\n\nTherefore, the pamphlet and the document were the only two fundamental\nfacts upon which Lupin had relied. With these he had built up the whole\nedifice. He had had no extraneous aid. The study of the pamphlet and\nthe study of the document--full stop--that was all.\n\nWell, could not Beautrelet confine himself to the same ground? What was\nthe use of an impossible struggle? What was the use of those vain\ninvestigations, in which, even supposing that he avoided the pitfalls\nthat were multiplied under his feet, he was sure, in the end, to\nachieve the poorest of results?\n\nHis decision was clear and immediate; and, in adopting it, he had the\nhappy instinct that he was on the right path. He began by leaving his\nJanson-de-Sailly schoolfellow, without indulging in useless\nrecriminations, and, taking his portmanteau with him, went and\ninstalled himself, after much hunting about, in a small hotel situated\nin the very heart of Paris. This hotel he did not leave for days. At\nmost, he took his meals at the table d'hote. The rest of the time,\nlocked in his room, with the window-curtains close-drawn, he spent in\nthinking.\n\n\"Ten days,\" Arsene Lupin had said.\n\nBeautrelet, striving to forget all that he had done and to remember\nonly the elements of the pamphlet and the document, aspired eagerly to\nkeep within the limit of those ten days. However the tenth day passed\nand the eleventh and the twelfth; but, on the thirteenth day, a gleam\nlit up his brain and, very soon, with the bewildering rapidity of those\nideas which develop in us like miraculous plants, the truth emerged,\nblossomed, gathered strength. On the evening of the thirteenth day, he\ncertainly did not know the answer to the problem, but he knew, to a\ncertainty, one of the methods which Lupin had, beyond a doubt, employed.\n\nIt was a very simple method, hinging on this one question: Is there a\nlink of any sort uniting all the more or less important historic events\nwith which the pamphlet connects the mystery of the Hollow Needle?\n\nThe great diversity of these events made the question difficult to\nanswer. Still, the profound examination to which Beautrelet applied\nhimself ended by pointing to one essential characteristic which was\ncommon to them all. Each one of them, without exception, had happened\nwithin the boundaries of the old kingdom of Neustria, which correspond\nvery nearly with those of our present-day Normandy. All the heroes of\nthe fantastic adventure are Norman, or become Norman, or play their\npart in the Norman country.\n\nWhat a fascinating procession through the ages! What a rousing\nspectacle was that of all those barons, dukes and kings, starting from\nsuch widely opposite points to meet in this particular corner of the\nworld! Beautrelet turned the pages of history at haphazard: it was\nRolf, or Rou, or Rollo, first Duke of Normandy, who was master of the\nsecret of the Needle, according to the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte!\n\nIt was William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy and King of England,\nwhose bannerstaff was pierced like a needle!\n\nIt was at Rouen that the English burnt Joan of Arc, mistress of the\nsecret!\n\nAnd right at the beginning of the adventure, who is that chief of the\nCaleti who pays his ransom to Caesar with the secret of the Needle but\nthe chief of the men of the Caux country, which lies in the very heart\nof Normandy?\n\nThe supposition becomes more definite. The field narrows. Rouen, the\nbanks of the Seine, the Caux country: it really seems as though all\nroads lead in that direction. Two kings of France are mentioned more\nparticularly, after the secret is lost by the Dukes of Normandy and\ntheir heirs, the kings of England, and becomes the royal secret of\nFrance; and these two are King Henry IV., who laid siege to Rouen and\nwon the battle of Arques, near Dieppe, and Francis I., who founded the\nHavre and uttered that suggestive phrase:\n\n\"The kings of France carry secrets that often decide the fate of towns!\"\n\nRouen, Dieppe, the Havre: the three angles of the triangle, the three\nlarge towns that occupy the three points. In the centre, the Caux\ncountry.\n\nThe seventeenth century arrives. Louis XIV. burns the book in which a\nperson unknown reveals the truth. Captain de Larbeyrie masters a copy,\nprofits by the secret thus obtained, steals a certain number of jewels\nand dies by the hand of highway murderers. Now at which spot is the\nambush laid? At Gaillon! At Gaillon, a little town on the road leading\nfrom Havre, Rouen or Dieppe to Paris!\n\nA year later, Louis XIV. buys a domain and builds the Chateau de\nl'Aiguille. Where does he select his site? In the Midlands of France,\nwith the result that the curious are thrown off the scent and do not\nhunt about in Normandy.\n\nRouen, Dieppe, the Havre--the Cauchois triangle--everything lies there.\nOn one side, the sea; on another, the Seine: on the third, the two\nvalleys that lead from Rouen to Dieppe.\n\nA light flashed across Beautrelet's mind. That extent of ground, that\ncountry of the high tablelands which run from the cliffs of the Seine\nto the cliffs of the Channel almost invariably constituted the field of\noperations of Arsene Lupin. For ten years, it was just this district\nwhich he parcelled out for his purposes, as though he had his haunt in\nthe very centre of the region with which, the legend of the Hollow\nNeedle was most closely connected.\n\nThe affair of Baron Cahorn?[3] Or the banks of the Seine, between Rouen\nand the Havre.\n\n\n[3] The Seven of Hearts, by Maurice Leblanc.

Ambrumesy,\non the road between the Havre and Dieppe.\n\nRouen, Dieppe, the Havre: always the Cauchois triangle.\n\nAnd so, a few years earlier, possessing the pamphlet and knowing the\nhiding-place in which Marie Antoinette had concealed the document,\nArsene Lupin had ended by laying his hand on the famous book of hours.\nOnce in possession of the document, he took the field, \"found\" and\nsettled down as in a conquered country.\n\nBeautrelet took the field.\n\nHe set out in genuine excitement, thinking of the same journey which\nLupin had taken, of the same hopes with which he must have throbbed\nwhen he thus went in search of the tremendous secret which was to arm\nhim with so great a power. Would his, Beautrelet's efforts have the\nsame victorious results?\n\nHe left Rouen early in the morning, on foot, with his face very much\ndisguised and his bag at the end of a stick on his shoulder, like an\napprentice doing his round of France. He walked straight to Duclair,\nwhere he lunched. On leaving this town, he followed the Seine and\npractically did not lose sight of it again. His instinct, strengthened,\nmoreover, by numerous influences, always brought him back to the\nsinuous banks of the stately river. When the Chateau du Malaquis was\nrobbed, the objects stolen from Baron Cahorn's collection were sent by\nway of the Seine. The old carvings removed from the chapel at Ambrumesy\nwere carried to the Seine bank. He pictured the whole fleet of pinnaces\nperforming a regular service between Rouen and the Havre and draining\nthe works of art and treasures from a countryside to dispatch them\nthence to the land of millionaires.\n\n\"I'm burning! I'm burning!\" muttered the boy, gasping under the truth,\nwhich came to him in a mighty series of shocks and took away his breath.\n\nThe checks encountered on the first few days, did not discourage him.\nHe had a firm and profound belief in the correctness of the supposition\nthat was guiding him. It was bold, perhaps, and extravagant; no matter:\nit was worthy of the adversary pursued. The supposition was on a level\nwith the prodigious reality that bore the name of Lupin. With a man\nlike that, of what good could it be to look elsewhere than in the\ndomain of the enormous, the exaggerated, the superhuman?\n\nJumieges, the Mailleraye, Saint-Wandrille, Caudebec, Tancarville,\nQuillebeuf were places filled with his memories. How often he must have\ncontemplated the glory of their Gothic steeples or the splendor of\ntheir immense ruins!\n\nBut the Havre, the neighborhood of the Havre drew Isidore like a\nbeacon-fire.\n\n\"The kings of France carry secrets that often decide the fate of towns!\"\n\nCryptic words which, suddenly, for Beautrelet, shone bright with\nclearness! Was this not an exact statement of the reasons that\ndetermined Francis I. to create a town on this spot and was not the\nfate of the Havre-de-Grace linked with the very secret of the Needle?\n\n\"That's it, that's it,\" stammered Beautrelet, excitedly. \"The old\nNorman estuary, one of the essential points, one of the original\ncentres around which our French nationality was formed, is completed by\nthose two forces, one in full view, alive, known to all, the new port\ncommanding the ocean and opening on the world; the other dim and\nobscure, unknown and all the more alarming, inasmuch as it is invisible\nand impalpable. A whole side of the history of France and of the royal\nhouse is explained by the Needle, even as it explains the whole story\nof Arsene Lupin. The same sources of energy and power supply and renew\nthe fortunes of kings and of the adventurer.\"\n\nBeautrelet ferreted and snuffed from village to village, from the river\nto the sea, with his nose in the wind, his ears pricked, trying to\ncompel the inanimate things to surrender their deep meaning. Ought this\nhill-slope to be questioned? Or that forest? Or the houses of this\nhamlet? Or was it among the insignificant phrases spoken by that\npeasant yonder that he might hope to gather the one little illuminating\nword?\n\nOne morning, he was lunching at an inn, within sight of Honfleur, the\nold city of the estuary. Opposite him was sitting one of those heavy,\nred-haired Norman horse-dealers who do the fairs of the district, whip\nin hand and clad in a long smock-frock. After a moment, it seemed to\nBeautrelet that the man was looking at him with a certain amount of\nattention, as though he knew him or, at least, was trying to recognize\nhim.\n\n\"Pooh,\" he thought, \"there's some mistake: I've never seen that\nmerchant before, nor he me.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, the man appeared to take no further interest in\nhim. He lit his pipe, called for coffee and brandy, smoked and drank.\n\nWhen Beautrelet had finished his meal, he paid and rose to go. A group\nof men entered just as he was about to leave and he had to stand for a\nfew seconds near the table at which the horse-dealer sat. He then heard\nthe man say in a low voice:\n\n\"Good-afternoon, M. Beautrelet.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Isidore sat down beside the man and said:\n\n\"Yes, that is my name--but who are you? How did you know me?\"\n\n\"That's not difficult--and yet I've only seen your portrait in the\npapers. But you are so badly--what do you call it in French--so badly\nmade-up.\"\n\nHe had a pronounced foreign accent and Beautrelet seemed to perceive,\nas he looked at him, that he too wore a facial disguise that entirely\naltered his features.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he repeated. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe stranger smiled:\n\n\"Don't you recognize me?\"\n\n\"No, I never saw you before.\"\n\n\"Nor I you. But think. The papers print my portrait also--and pretty\noften. Well, have you got it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Holmlock Shears.\"\n\nIt was an amusing and, at the same time, a significant meeting. The boy\nat once saw the full bearing of it. After an exchange of compliments,\nhe said to Shears:\n\n\"I suppose that you are here--because of 'him'?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So--so--you think we have a chance--in this direction.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it.\"\n\nBeautrelet's delight at finding that Shears's opinion agreed with his\nown was not unmingled with other feelings. If the Englishman attained\nhis object, it meant that, at the very best, the two would share the\nvictory; and who could tell that Shears would not attain it first?\n\n\"Have you any proofs? Any clues?\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" grinned the Englishman, who understood his\nuneasiness. \"I am not treading on your heels. With you, it's the\ndocument, the pamphlet: things that do not inspire me with any great\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"And with you?\"\n\n\"With me, it's something different.\"\n\n\"Should I be indiscreet, if--?\"\n\n\"Not at all. You remember the story of the coronet, the story of the\nDuc de Charmerac?\"[7]\n\n\n[7] Arsene Lupin, play in four acts, by Maurice Leblanc and\nFrancis de Croisset.\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You remember Victoire, Lupin's old foster-mother, the one whom my good\nfriend Ganimard allowed to escape in a sham prison-van?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have found Victoire's traces. She lives on a farm, not far from\nNational Road No. 25. National Road No. 25 is the road from the Havre\nto Lille. Through Victoire I shall easily get at Lupin.\"\n\n\"It will take long.\"\n\n\"No matter! I have dropped all my cases. This is the only one I care\nabout. Between Lupin and me, it's a fight--a fight to the death.\"\n\nHe spoke these words with a sort of ferocity that betrayed all his\nbitterness at the humiliations which he had undergone, all his fierce\nhatred of the great enemy who had tricked him so cruelly.\n\n\"Go away, now,\" he whispered, \"we are observed. It's dangerous. But\nmark my words: on the day when Lupin and I meet face to face, it will\nbe--it will be tragic.\"\n\nBeautrelet felt quite reassured on leaving Shears: he need not fear\nthat the Englishman would gain on him. And here was one more proof\nwhich this chance interview had brought him: the road from the Havre to\nLille passes through Dieppe! It is the great seaside road of the Caux\ncountry, the coast road commanding the Channel cliffs! And it was on a\nfarm near this road that Victoire was installed, Victoire, that is to\nsay, Lupin, for one did not move without the other, the master without\nthe blindly devoted servant.\n\n\"I'm burning! I'm burning!\" he repeated to himself. \"Whenever\ncircumstances bring me a new element of information, it confirms my\nsupposition. On the one hand, I have the absolute certainty of the\nbanks of the Seine; on the other, the certainty of the National Road.\nThe two means of communication meet at the Havre, the town of Francis\nI., the town of the secret. The boundaries are contracting. The Caux\ncountry is not large; and, even so, I have only the western portion of\nthe Caux country to search.\"\n\nHe set to work with renewed stubbornness:\n\n\"Anything that Lupin has found,\" he kept on saying to himself, \"there\nis no reason for my not finding.\"\n\nCertainly, Lupin had some great advantage over him, perhaps a thorough\nacquaintance with the country, a precise knowledge of the local\nlegends, or less than that, a memory: invaluable advantages these, for\nhe, Beautrelet, knew nothing, was totally ignorant of the country,\nwhich he had first visited at the time of the Ambrumesy burglary and\nthen only rapidly, without lingering.\n\nBut what did it matter? Though he had to devote ten years of his life\nto this investigation, he would carry it to a successful issue. Lupin\nwas there. He could see him, he could feel him there. He expected to\ncome upon him at the next turn of the road, on the skirt of the next\nwood, outside the next village. And, though continually disappointed,\nhe seemed to find in each disappointment a fresh reason for persisting.\n\nOften, he would fling himself on the slope by the roadside and plunge\ninto wild examination of the copy of the document which he always\ncarried on him, a copy, that is to say, with vowels taking the place of\nthe figures:\n\n  e . a . a . . e . . e . a . . a . .\n   a . . . e . e .     . e . oi . e . . e .\n   . ou . . e . o . . . e . . e . o . . e\n\n\n[Illustration: drawing of an outline of paper with writing and drawing\non it--numbers, dots, some letters, signs and symbols...]\n\n  ai . ui . . e           . . eu . e\n\nOften, also, according to his habit, he would lie down flat on his\nstomach in the tall grass and think for hours. He had time enough. The\nfuture belonged to him.\n\nWith wonderful patience, he tramped from the Seine to the sea, and from\nthe sea to the Seine, going gradually farther, retracing his steps and\nnever quitting the ground until, theoretically speaking, there was not\na chance left of gathering the smallest particle upon it.\n\nHe studied and explored Montivilliers and Saint-Romani and Octeville\nand Gonneville and Criquetot.\n\nAt night, he knocked at the peasants' doors and asked for a lodging.\nAfter dinner, they smoked together and chatted. He made them tell him\nthe stories which they told one another on the long winter nights. And\nhe never omitted to insinuate, slily:\n\n\"What about the Needle? The legend of the Hollow Needle? Don't you know\nthat?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't--never heard of it--\"\n\n\"Just think--an old wives' tale--something that has to do with a\nneedle. An enchanted needle, perhaps.--I don't know--\"\n\nNothing. No legend, no recollection. And the next morning he walked\nblithely away again.\n\nOne day, he passed through the pretty village of Saint-Jouin, which\noverlooks the sea, and descending among the chaos of rocks that have\nslipped from cliffs, he climbed up to the tableland and went in the\ndirection of the dry valley of Bruneval, Cap d'Antifer and the little\ncreek of Belle-Plage. He was walking gaily and lightly, feeling a\nlittle tired, perhaps, but glad to be alive, so glad, even, that he\nforgot Lupin and the mystery of the Hollow Needle and Victoire and\nShears, and interested himself in the sight of nature: the blue sky,\nthe great emerald sea, all glittering in the sunshine.\n\nSome straight slopes and remains of brick walls, in which he seemed to\nrecognize the vestiges of a Roman camp, interested him. Then his eyes\nfell upon a sort of little castle, built in imitation of an ancient\nfort, with cracked turrets and Gothic windows. It stood on a jagged,\nrugged, rising promontory, almost detached from the cliff. A barred\ngate, flanked by iron hand-rails and bristling spikes, guarded the\nnarrow passage.\n\nBeautrelet succeeded in climbing over, not without some difficulty.\nOver the pointed door, which was closed with an old rusty lock, he read\nthe words:\n\nFORT DE FREFOSSE\n\nHe did not attempt to enter, but, turning to the right, after going\ndown a little slope, he embarked upon a path that ran along a ridge of\nland furnished with a wooden handrail. Right at the end was a cave of\nvery small dimensions, forming a sort of watch-tower at the point of\nthe rock in which it was hollowed out, a rock falling abruptly into the\nsea.\n\nThere was just room to stand up in the middle of the cave. Multitudes\nof inscriptions crossed one another on the walls. An almost square\nhole, cut in the stone, opened like a dormer window on the land side,\nexactly opposite Fort Frefosse, the crenellated top of which appeared\nat thirty or forty yards' distance.\n\nBeautrelet threw off his knapsack and sat down. He had had a hard and\ntiring day. He fell asleep for a little. Then the cool wind that blew\ninside the cave woke him up. He sat for a few minutes without moving,\nabsent-minded, vague-eyed. He tried to reflect, to recapture his still\ntorpid thoughts. And, as he recovered his consciousness, he was on the\npoint of rising, when he received the impression that his eyes,\nsuddenly fixed, suddenly wide-open, saw--\n\nA thrill shook him from head to foot. His hands clutched convulsively\nand he felt the beads of perspiration forming at the roots of his hair:\n\n\"No, no,\" he stammered. \"It's a dream, an hallucination. Let's look:\nit's not possible!\"\n\nHe plunged down on his knees and stooped over. Two huge letters, each\nperhaps a foot long, appeared cut in relief in the granite of the\nfloor. Those two letters, clumsily, but plainly carved, with their\ncorners rounded and their surface smoothed by the wear and tear of\ncenturies, were a D and an F.\n\nD and F! Oh, bewildering miracle! D and F: just two letters of the\ndocument! Oh, Beautrelet had no need to consult it to bring before his\nmind that group of letters in the fourth line, the line of the\nmeasurements and indications! He knew them well! They were inscribed\nfor all time at the back of his pupils, encrusted for good and all in\nthe very substance of his brain!\n\nHe rose to his feet, went down the steep road, climbed back along the\nold fort, hung on to the spikes of the rail again, in order to pass,\nand walked briskly toward a shepherd whose flock was grazing some way\noff on a dip in the tableland:\n\n\"That cave, over there--that cave--\"\n\nHis lips trembled and he tried to find the words that would not come.\nThe shepherd looked at him in amazement. At last, Isidore repeated:\n\n\"Yes, that cave--over there--to the right of the fort. Has it a name?\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think so. All the Etretat folk like to call it the\nDemoiselles.\"\n\n\"What?--What?--What's that you say?\"\n\n\"Why, of course--it's the Chambre des Demoiselles.\"\n\nIsidore felt like flying at his throat, as though all the truth lived\nin that man and he hoped to get it from him at one swoop, to tear it\nfrom him.\n\nThe Demoiselles! One of the words, one of the only three known words of\nthe document!\n\nA whirlwind of madness shook Beautrelet where he stood. And it rose all\naround him, blew upon him like a tempestuous squall that came from the\nsea, that came from the land, that came from every direction and\nwhipped him with great lashes of the truth.\n\nHe understood. The document appeared to him in its real sense. The\nChambre des Demoiselles--Etretat--\n\n\"That's it,\" he thought, his brain filled with light, \"it must be that.\nBut why didn't I guess earlier?\"\n\nHe said to the shepherd, in a low voice:\n\n\"That will do--go away--you can go--thank you.\"\n\nThe man, not knowing what to think, whistled to his dog and went.\n\nLeft alone, Beautrelet returned to the fort. He had almost passed it\nwhen, suddenly, he dropped to the ground and lay cowering against a\npiece of wall. And, wringing his hands, he thought:\n\n\"I must be mad! If 'he' were to see me! Or his accomplices! I've been\nmoving about for an hour--!\"\n\nHe did not stir another limb.\n\nThe sun went down. Little by little, the night mingled with the day,\nblurring the outline of things.\n\nThen, with little imperceptible movements, flat on his stomach,\ngliding, crawling, he crept along one of the points of the promontory\nto the extreme edge of the cliff.\n\nHe reached it. Stretching out his hands, he pushed aside some tufts of\ngrass and his head appeared over the precipice.\n\nOpposite him, almost level with the cliff, in the open sea rose an\nenormous rock, over eighty yards high, a colossal obelisk, standing\nstraight on its granite base, which showed at the surface of the water,\nand tapering toward the summit, like the giant tooth of a monster of\nthe deep. White with the dirty gray white of the cliff, the awful\nmonolith was streaked with horizontal lines marked by flint and\ndisplaying the slow work of the centuries, which had heaped alternate\nlayers of lime and pebble-stone one atop of the other.\n\nHere and there, a fissure, a break; and, wherever these occurred, a\nscrap of earth, with grass and leaves.\n\nAnd all this was mighty and solid and formidable, with the look of an\nindestructible thing against which the furious assault of the waves and\nstorms could not prevail. And it was definite and permanent and grand,\ndespite the grandeur of the cliffy rampart that commanded it, despite\nthe immensity of the space in which it stood.\n\nBeautrelet's nails dug into the soil like the claws of an animal ready\nto leap upon its prey. His eyes penetrated the wrinkled texture of the\nrock, penetrated its skin, so it seemed to him, its very flesh. He\ntouched it, felt it, took cognizance and possession of it, absorbed and\nassimilated it.\n\nThe horizon turned crimson with all the flames of the vanished sun; and\nlong, red clouds, set motionless in the sky, formed glorious\nlandscapes, fantastic lagoons, fiery plains, forests of gold, lakes of\nblood, a whole glowing and peaceful phantasmagoria.\n\nThe blue of the sky grew darker. Venus shone with a marvelous\nbrightness; then other stars lit up, timid as yet.\n\nAnd Beautrelet suddenly closed his eyes and convulsively pressed his\nfolded arms to his forehead. Over there--oh, he felt as though he would\ndie for joy, so great was the cruel emotion that wrung his heart!--over\nthere, almost at the top of the Needle of Etretat, a little below the\nextreme point round which the sea-mews fluttered, a thread of smoke\ncame filtering through a crevice, as though from an invisible chimney,\na thread of smoke rose in slow spirals in the calm air of the twilight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nOPEN, SESAME!\n\n\nThe Etretat Needle was hollow!\n\nWas it a natural phenomenon, an excavation produced by internal\ncataclysms or by the imperceptible action of the rushing sea and the\nsoaking rain? Or was it a superhuman work executed by human beings,\nGauls, Celts, prehistoric men?\n\nThese, no doubt, were insoluble questions; and what did it matter? The\nessence of the thing was contained in this fact: The Needle was hollow.\nAt forty or fifty yards from that imposing arch which is called the\nPorte d'Aval and which shoots out from the top of the cliff, like the\ncolossal branch of a tree, to take root in the submerged rocks, stands\nan immense limestone cone; and this cone is no more than the shell of a\npointed cap poised upon the empty waters!\n\nA prodigious revelation! After Lupin, here was Beautrelet discovering\nthe key to the great riddle that had loomed over more than twenty\ncenturies! A key of supreme importance to whoever possessed it in the\ndays of old, in those distant times when hordes of barbarians rode\nthrough and overran the old world! A magic key that opens the cyclopean\ncavern to whole tribes fleeing before the enemy! A mysterious key that\nguards the door of the most inviolable shelter! An enchanted key that\ngives power and ensures preponderance!\n\nBecause he knows this key, Caesar is able to subdue Gaul. Because they\nknow it, the Normans force their sway upon the country and, from there,\nlater, backed by that support, conquer the neighboring island, conquer\nSicily, conquer the East, conquer the new world!\n\nMasters of the secret, the Kings of England lord it over France, humble\nher, dismember her, have themselves crowned at Paris. They lose the\nsecret; and the rout begins.\n\nMasters of the secret, the Kings of France push back and overstep the\nnarrow limits of their dominion, gradually founding a great nation and\nradiating with glory and power. They forget it or know not how to use\nit; and death, exile, ruin follow.\n\nAn invisible kingdom, in mid-water and at ten fathoms from land! An\nunknown fortress, taller than the towers of Notre Dame and built upon a\ngranite foundation larger than a public square! What strength and what\nsecurity! From Paris to the sea, by the Seine. There, the Havre, the\nnew town, the necessary town. And, sixteen miles thence, the Hollow\nNeedle, the impregnable sanctuary!\n\nIt is a sanctuary and also a stupendous hiding-place. All the treasures\nof the kings, increasing from century to century, all the gold of\nFrance, all that they extort from the people, all that they snatch from\nthe clergy, all the booty gathered on the battle-fields of Europe lie\nheaped up in the royal cave. Old Merovingian gold sous, glittering\ncrown-pieces, doubloons, ducats, florins, guineas; and the precious\nstones and the diamonds; and all the jewels and all the ornaments:\neverything is there. Who could discover it? Who could ever learn the\nimpenetrable secret of the Needle? Nobody.\n\nAnd Lupin becomes that sort of really disproportionate being whom we\nknow, that miracle incapable of explanation so long as the truth\nremains in the shadow. Infinite though the resources of his genius be,\nthey cannot suffice for the mad struggle which he maintains against\nsociety. He needs other, more material resources. He needs a sure place\nof retreat, he needs the certainty of impunity, the peace that allows\nof the execution of his plans.\n\nWithout the Hollow Needle, Lupin is incomprehensible, a myth, a\ncharacter in a novel, having no connection with reality.\n\nMaster of the secret--and of such a secret!--he becomes simply a man\nlike another, but gifted with the power of wielding in a superior\nmanner the extraordinary weapon with which destiny has endowed him.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo the Needle was hollow.\n\nIt remained to discover how one obtained access to it.\n\nFrom the sea, obviously. There must be, on the side of the offing, some\nfissure where boats could land at certain hours of the tide.\n\nBut on the side of the land?\n\nBeautrelet lay until ten o'clock at night hanging over the precipice,\nwith his eyes riveted on the shadowy mass formed by the pyramid,\nthinking and pondering with all the concentrated effort of his mind.\n\nThen he went down to Etretat, selected the cheapest hotel, dined, went\nup to his room and unfolded the document.\n\nIt was the merest child's play to him now to establish its exact\nmeaning. He at once saw that the three vowels of the word Etretat\noccurred in the first line, in their proper order and at the necessary\nintervals. This first line now read as follows:\n\n  e . a . a .. etretat . a ..\n\nWhat words could come before Etretat? Words, no doubt, that referred to\nthe position of the Needle with regard to the town. Now the Needle\nstood on the left, on the west--He ransacked his memory and,\nrecollecting that westerly winds are called vents d'aval on the coast\nand that the nearest porte was known as the Porte d'Aval, he wrote down:\n\n  \"En aval d'Etretat . a ..\"\n\nThe second line was that containing the word Demoiselles and, at once\nseeing, in front of that word, the series of all the vowels that form\npart of the words la chambre des, he noted the two phrases:\n\n  \"En aval d'Etretat. La Chambre des Demoiselles.\"\n\nThe third line gave him more trouble; and it was not until some groping\nthat, remembering the position, near the Chambre des Demoiselles, of\nthe Fort de Frefosse, he ended by almost completely reconstructing the\ndocument:\n\n  \"En aval d'Etretat. La Chambre des Demoiselles. Sous le Fort de\n  Frefosse. L'Aiguille creuse.\"\n\nThese were the four great formulas, the essential and general formulas\nwhich you had to know. By means of them, you turned en aval, that is to\nsay, below or west of Etretat, entered the Chambre des Demoiselles, in\nall probability passed under Fort Frefosse and thus arrived at the\nNeedle.\n\nHow? By means of the indications and measurements that constituted the\nfourth line:\n\n[Illustration: drawing of an outline of paper with writing and drawing\non it--numbers, dots, some letters, signs and symbols...]\n\nThese were evidently the more special formulas to enable you to find\nthe outlet through which you made your way and the road that led to the\nNeedle.\n\nBeautrelet at once presumed--and his surmise was no more than the\nlogical consequence of the document--that, if there really was a direct\ncommunication between the land and the obelisk of the Needle, the\nunderground passage must start from the Chambre des Demoiselles, pass\nunder Fort Frefosse, descend perpendicularly the three hundred feet of\ncliff and, by means of a tunnel contrived under the rocks of the sea,\nend at the Hollow Needle.\n\nWhich was the entrance to the underground passage? Did not the two\nletters D and F, so plainly cut, point to it and admit to it, with the\naid, perhaps, of some ingenious piece of mechanism?\n\nThe whole of the next morning, Isidore strolled about Etretat and\nchatted with everybody he met, in order to try and pick up useful\ninformation. At last, in the afternoon, he went up the cliff. Disguised\nas a sailor, he had made himself still younger and, in a pair of\ntrousers too short for him and a fishing jersey, he looked a mere\nscape-grace of twelve or thirteen.\n\nAs soon as he entered the cave, he knelt down before the letters. Here\na disappointment awaited him. It was no use his striking them, pushing\nthem, manipulating them in every way: they refused to move. And it was\nnot long, in fact, before he became aware that they were really unable\nto move and that, therefore, they controlled no mechanism.\n\nAnd yet--and yet they must mean something! Inquiries which he had made\nin the village went to show that no one had ever been able to explain\ntheir existence and that the Abbe Cochet, in his valuable little book\non Etretat,[8] had also tried in vain to solve this little puzzle. But\nIsidore knew what the learned Norman archaeologist did not know,\nnamely, that the same two letters figured in the document, on the line\ncontaining the indications. Was it a chance coincidence: Impossible.\nWell, then--?\n\n\n[8] Les Origines d'Etretat. The Abbe Cochet seems to conclude,\nin the end, that the two letters are the initials of a passer-by. The\nrevelations now made prove the fallacy of the theory.\n\n\nAn idea suddenly occurred to him, an idea so reasonable, so simple that\nhe did not doubt its correctness for a second. Were not that D and that\nF the initials of the two most important words in the document, the\nwords that represented--together with the Needle--the essential\nstations on the road to be followed: the Chambre des Demoiselles and\nFort Frefosse: D for Demoiselles, F for Frefosse: the connection was\ntoo remarkable to be a mere accidental fact.\n\nIn that case, the problem stood thus: the two letters D F represent the\nrelation that exists between the Chambre des Demoiselles and Fort\nFrefosse, the single letter D, which begins the line, represents the\nDemoiselles, that is to say, the cave in which you have to begin by\ntaking up your position, and the single letter F, placed in the middle\nof the line, represents Frefosse, that is to say, the probable entrance\nto the underground passage.\n\nBetween these various signs, are two more: first, a sort of irregular\nrectangle, marked with a stripe in the left bottom corner, and, next,\nthe figure 19, signs which obviously indicate to those inside the cave\nthe means of penetrating beneath the fort.\n\nThe shape of this rectangle puzzled Isidore. Was there around him, on\nthe walls of the cave, or at any rate within reach of his eyes, an\ninscription, anything whatever, affecting a rectangular shape?\n\nHe looked for a long time and was on the point of abandoning that\nparticular scent when his eyes fell upon the little opening, pierced in\nthe rock, that acted as a window to the chamber.\n\nNow the edges of this opening just formed a rectangle: corrugated,\nuneven, clumsy, but still a rectangle; and Beautrelet at once saw that,\nby placing his two feet on the D and the F carved in the stone\nfloor--and this explained the stroke that surmounted the two letters in\nthe document--he found himself at the exact height of the window!\n\nHe took up his position in this place and gazed out. The window looking\nlandward, as we know, he saw, first, the path that connected the cave\nwith the land, a path hung between two precipices; and, next, he caught\nsight of the foot of the hillock on which the fort stood. To try and\nsee the fort, Beautrelet leaned over to the left and it was then that\nhe understood the meaning of the curved stripe, the comma that marked\nthe left bottom corner in the document: at the bottom on the left-hand\nside of the window, a piece of flint projected and the end of it was\ncurved like a claw. It suggested a regular shooter's mark. And, when a\nman applied his eye to this mark, he saw cut out, on the slope of the\nmound facing him, a restricted surface of land occupied almost entirely\nby an old brick wall, a remnant of the original Fort Frefosse or of the\nold Roman oppidum built on this spot.\n\nBeautrelet ran to this piece of wall, which was, perhaps, ten yards\nlong. It was covered with grass and plants. There was no indication of\nany kind visible. And yet that figure 19?\n\nHe returned to the cave, took from his pocket a ball of string and a\ntape-measure, tied the string to the flint corner, fastened a pebble at\nthe nineteenth metre and flung it toward the land side. The pebble at\nmost reached the end of the path.\n\n\"Idiot that I am!\" thought Beautrelet. \"Who reckoned by metres in those\ndays? The figure 19 means 19 fathoms[9] or nothing!\"\n\n\n[9] The toise, or fathom, measured 1.949 metres.--Translator's Note.\n\n\nHaving made the calculation, he ran out the twine, made a knot and felt\nabout on the piece of wall for the exact and necessarily one point at\nwhich the knot, formed at 37 metres from the window of the Demoiselles,\nshould touch the Frefosse wall. In a few moments, the point of contact\nwas established. With his free hand, he moved aside the leaves of\nmullein that had grown in the interstices. A cry escaped him. The knot,\nwhich he held pressed down with his fore-finger, was in the centre of a\nlittle cross carved in relief on a brick. And the sign that followed on\nthe figure 19 in the document was a cross!\n\nIt needed all his will-power to control the excitement with which he\nwas overcome. Hurriedly, with convulsive fingers, he clutched the cross\nand, pressing upon it, turned it as he would have turned the spokes of\na wheel. The brick heaved. He redoubled his effort; it moved no\nfurther. Then, without turning, he pressed harder. He at once felt the\nbrick give way. And, suddenly, there was the click of a bolt that is\nreleased, the sound of a lock opening and, on the right of the brick,\nto the width of about a yard, the wall swung round on a pivot and\nrevealed the orifice of an underground passage.\n\nLike a madman, Beautrelet seized the iron door in which the bricks were\nsealed, pulled it back, violently and closed it. Astonishment, delight,\nthe fear of being surprised convulsed his face so as to render it\nunrecognizable. He beheld the awful vision of all that had happened\nthere, in front of that door, during twenty centuries; of all those\npeople, initiated into the great secret, who had penetrated through\nthat issue: Celts, Gauls, Romans, Normans, Englishmen, Frenchmen,\nbarons, dukes, kings--and, after all of them, Arsene Lupin--and, after\nLupin, himself, Beautrelet. He felt that his brain was slipping away\nfrom him. His eyelids fluttered. He fell fainting and rolled to the\nbottom of the slope, to the very edge of the precipice.\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis task was done, at least the task which he was able to accomplish\nalone, with his unaided resources.\n\nThat evening, he wrote a long letter to the chief of the detective\nservice, giving a faithful account of the results of his investigations\nand revealing the secret of the Hollow Needle. He asked for assistance\nto complete his work and gave his address.\n\nWhile waiting for the reply, he spent two consecutive nights in the\nChambre des Demoiselles. He spent them overcome with fear, his nerves\nshaken with a terror which was increased by the sounds of the night. At\nevery moment, he thought he saw shadows approach in his direction.\nPeople knew of his presence in the cave--they were coming--they were\nmurdering him!\n\nHis eyes, however, staring madly before them, sustained by all the\npower of his will, clung to the piece of wall.\n\nOn the first night, nothing stirred; but, on the second, by the light\nof the stars and a slender crescent-moon, he saw the door open and\nfigures emerge from the darkness: he counted two, three, four, five of\nthem.\n\nIt seemed to him that those five men were carrying fairly large loads.\nHe followed them for a little way. They cut straight across the fields\nto the Havre road; and he heard the sound of a motor car driving away.\n\nHe retraced his steps, skirting a big farm. But, at the turn of the\nroad that ran beside it, he had only just time to scramble up a slope\nand hide behind some trees. More men passed--four, five men--all\ncarrying packages. And, two minutes later, another motor snorted.\n\nThis time, he had not the strength to return to his post; and he went\nback to bed.\n\nWhen he woke and had finished dressing, the hotel waiter brought him a\nletter. He opened it. It contained Ganimard's card.\n\n\"At last!\" cried Beautrelet, who, after so hard a campaign, was really\nfeeling the need of a comrade-in-arms.\n\nHe ran downstairs with outstretched hands. Ganimard took them, looked\nat him for a moment and said:\n\n\"You're a fine fellow, my lad!\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" he said. \"Luck has served me.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing as luck with 'him,'\" declared the inspector, who\nalways spoke of Lupin in a solemn tone and without mentioning his name.\n\nHe sat down:\n\n\"So we've got him!\"\n\n\"Just as we've had him twenty times over,\" said Beautrelet, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, but to-day--\"\n\n\"To-day, of course, the case is different. We know his retreat, his\nstronghold, which means, when all is said, that Lupin is Lupin. He can\nescape. The Etretat Needle cannot.\"\n\n\"Why do you suppose that he will escape?\" asked Ganimard, anxiously.\n\n\"Why do you suppose that he requires to escape?\" replied Beautrelet.\n\"There is nothing to prove that he is in the Needle at present. Last\nnight, eleven of his men left it. He may be one of the eleven.\"\n\nGanimard reflected:\n\n\"You are right. The great thing is the Hollow Needle. For the rest, let\nus hope that chance will favor us. And now, let us talk.\"\n\nHe resumed his serious voice, his self-important air and said:\n\n\"My dear Beautrelet, I have orders to recommend you to observe the most\nabsolute discretion in regard to this matter.\"\n\n\"Orders from whom?\" asked Beautrelet, jestingly. \"The prefect of\npolice?\"\n\n\"Higher than that.\"\n\n\"The prime minister?\"\n\n\"Higher.\"\n\n\"Whew!\"\n\nGanimard lowered his voice:\n\n\"Beautrelet, I was at the Elysee last night. They look upon this matter\nas a state secret of the utmost gravity. There are serious reasons for\nconcealing the existence of this citadel--reasons of military strategy,\nin particular. It might become a revictualling centre, a magazine for\nnew explosives, for lately-invented projectiles, for anything of that\nsort: the secret arsenal of France, in fact.\"\n\n\"But how can they hope to keep a secret like this? In the old days, one\nman alone held it: the king. To-day, already, there are a good few of\nus who know it, without counting Lupin's gang.\"\n\n\"Still, if we gained only ten years', only five years' silence! Those\nfive years may be--the saving of us.\"\n\n\"But, in order to capture this citadel, this future arsenal, it will\nhave to be attacked, Lupin must be dislodged. And all this cannot be\ndone without noise.\"\n\n\"Of course, people will guess something, but they won't know. Besides,\nwe can but try.\"\n\n\"All right. What's your plan?\"\n\n\"Here it is, in two words. To begin with, you are not Isidore\nBeautrelet and there's no question of Arsene Lupin either. You are and\nyou remain a small boy of Etretat, who, while strolling about the\nplace, caught some fellows coming out of an underground passage. This\nmakes you suspect the existence of a flight of steps which cuts through\nthe cliff from top to bottom.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are several of those flights of steps along the coast. For\ninstance, to the right of Etretat, opposite Benouville, they showed me\nthe Devil's Staircase, which every bather knows. And I say nothing of\nthe three or four tunnels used by the fishermen.\"\n\n\"So you will guide me and one-half of my men. I shall enter alone, or\naccompanied, that remains to be seen. This much is certain, that the\nattack must be delivered that way. If Lupin is not in the Needle, we\nshall fix up a trap in which he will be caught sooner or later. If he\nis there--\"\n\n\"If he is there, he will escape from the Needle by the other side, the\nside overlooking the sea.\"\n\n\"In that case, he will at once be arrested by the other half of my men.\"\n\n\"Yes, but if, as I presume, you choose a moment when the sea is at low\nebb, leaving the base of the Needle uncovered, the chase will be\npublic, because it will take place before all the men and women fishing\nfor mussels, shrimps and shell-fish who swarm on the rocks round about.\"\n\n\"That is why I just mean to select the time when the sea is full.\"\n\n\"In that case, he will make off in a boat.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I shall have a dozen fishing-smacks, each of which will be\ncommanded by one of my men, and we shall collar him--\"\n\n\"If he doesn't slip through your dozen smacks, like a fish through the\nmeshes.\"\n\n\"All right, then I'll sink him.\"\n\n\"The devil you will! Shall you have guns?\"\n\n\"Why, of course! There's a torpedo-boat at the Havre at this moment. A\ntelegram from me will bring her to the Needle at the appointed hour.\"\n\n\"How proud Lupin will be! A torpedo-boat! Well, M. Ganimard, I see that\nyou have provided for everything. We have only to go ahead. When do we\ndeliver the assault?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"At night?\"\n\n\"No, by daylight, at the flood-tide, as the clock strikes ten in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Capital.\"\n\n        *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder his show of gaiety, Beautrelet concealed a real anguish of mind.\nHe did not sleep until the morning, but lay pondering over the most\nimpracticable schemes, one after the other.\n\nGanimard had left him in order to go to Yport, six or seven miles from\nEtretat, where, for prudence's sake, he had told his men to meet him,\nand where he chartered twelve fishing smacks, with the ostensible\nobject of taking soundings along the coast.\n\nAt a quarter to ten, escorted by a body of twelve stalwart men, he met\nIsidore at the foot of the road that goes up the cliff.\n\nAt ten o'clock exactly, they reached the skirt of wall. It was the\ndecisive moment.\n\nAt ten o'clock exactly.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with you, Beautrelet?\" jeered Ganimard. \"You're\nquite green in the face!\"\n\n\"It's as well you can't see yourself, Ganimard,\" the boy retorted. \"One\nwould think your last hour had come!\"\n\nThey both had to sit down and Ganimard swallowed a few mouthfuls of rum.\n\n\"It's not funk,\" he said, \"but, by Jove, this is an exciting business!\nEach time that I'm on the point of catching him, it takes me like that\nin the pit of the stomach. A dram of rum?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And if you drop behind?\"\n\n\"That will mean that I'm dead.\"\n\n\"B-r-r-r-r! However, we'll see. And now, open, sesame! No danger of our\nbeing observed, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No. The Needle is not so high as the cliff, and, besides, there's a\nbend in the ground where we are.\"\n\nBeautrelet went to the wall and pressed upon the brick. The bolt was\nreleased and the underground passage came in sight.\n\nBy the gleam of the lanterns which they lit, they saw that it was cut\nin the shape of a vault and that both the vaulting and the floor itself\nwere entirely covered with bricks.\n\nThey walked for a few seconds and, suddenly, a staircase appeared.\nBeautrelet counted forty-five brick steps, which the slow action of\nmany footsteps had worn away in the middle.\n\n\"Blow!\" said Ganimard, holding his head and stopping suddenly, as\nthough he had knocked against something.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"A door.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" muttered Beautrelet, looking at it. \"And not an easy one to\nbreak down either. It's just a solid block of iron.\"\n\n\"We are done,\" said Ganimard. \"There's not even a lock to it.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That's what gives me hope.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"A door is made to open; and, as this one has no lock, that means that\nthere is a secret way of opening it.\"\n\n\"And, as we don't know the secret--\"\n\n\"I shall know it in a minute.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By means of the document. The fourth line has no other object but to\nsolve each difficulty as and when it crops up. And the solution is\ncomparatively easy, because it's not written with a view to throwing\nsearchers off the scent, but to assisting them.\"\n\n\"Comparatively easy! I don't agree with you,\" cried Ganimard, who had\nunfolded the document. \"The number 44 and a triangle with a dot in it:\nthat doesn't tell us much!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it does! Look at the door. You see it's strengthened, at\neach corner, with a triangular slab of iron; and the slabs are fixed\nwith big nails. Take the left-hand bottom slab and work the nail in the\ncorner: I'll lay ten to one we've hit the mark.\"\n\n\"You've lost your bet,\" said Ganimard, after trying.\n\n\"Then the figure 44 must mean--\"\n\nIn a low voice, reflecting as he spoke, Beautrelet continued:\n\n\"Let me see--Ganimard and I are both standing on the bottom step of the\nstaircase--there are 45. Why 45, when the figure in the document is 44?\nA coincidence? No. In all this business, there is no such thing as a\ncoincidence, at least not an involuntary one. Ganimard, be so good as\nto move one step higher up. That's it, don't leave this forty-fourth\nstep. And now I will work the iron nail. And the trick's done, or I'll\neat my boots!\"\n\nThe heavy door turned on its hinges. A fairly spacious cavern appeared\nbefore their eyes.\n\n\"We must be exactly under Fort Frefosse,\" said Beautrelet. \"We have\npassed through the different earthy layers by now. There will be no\nmore brick. We are in the heart of the solid limestone.\"\n\nThe room was dimly lit by a shaft of daylight that came from the other\nend. Going up to it, they saw that it was a fissure in the cliff,\ncontrived in a projecting wall and forming a sort of observatory. In\nfront of them, at a distance of fifty yards, the impressive mass of the\nNeedle loomed from the waves. On the right, quite close, was the arched\nbuttress of the Porte d'Aval and, on the left, very far away, closing\nthe graceful curve of a large inlet, another rocky gateway, more\nimposing still, was cut out of the cliff; the Manneporte,[10] which was\nso wide and tall that a three-master could have passed through it with\nall sail set. Behind and everywhere, the sea.\n\n\n[10] Magna porta.\n\n\n\"I don't see our little fleet,\" said Beautrelet.\n\n\"I know,\" said Ganimard. \"The Porte d'Aval hides the whole of the coast\nof Etretat and Yport. But look, over there, in the offing, that black\nline, level with the water--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That's our fleet of war, Torpedo-boat No. 25. With her there, Lupin is\nwelcome to break loose--if he wants to study the landscape at the\nbottom of the sea.\"\n\nA baluster marked the entrance to the staircase, near the fissure. They\nstarted on their way down. From time to time, a little window pierced\nthe wall of the cliff; and, each time, they caught sight of the Needle,\nwhose mass seemed to them to grow more and more colossal.\n\nA little before reaching high-water level, the windows ceased and all\nwas dark.\n\nIsidore counted the steps aloud. At the three hundred and fifty-eight,\nthey emerged into a wider passage, which was barred by another iron\ndoor strengthened with slabs and nails.\n\n\"We know all about this,\" said Beautrelet. \"The document gives us 357\nand a triangle dotted on the right. We have only to repeat the\nperformance.\"\n\nThe second door obeyed like the first. A long, a very long tunnel\nappeared, lit up at intervals by the gleam of a lantern swung from the\nvault. The walls oozed moisture and drops of water fell to the ground,\nso that, to make walking easier a regular pavement of planks had been\nlaid from end to end.\n\n\"We are passing under the sea,\" said Beautrelet. \"Are you coming,\nGanimard?\"\n\nWithout replying, the inspector ventured into the tunnel, followed the\nwooden foot-plank and stopped before a lantern, which he took down.\n\n\"The utensils may date back to the Middle Ages, but the lighting is\nmodern,\" he said. \"Our friends use incandescent mantles.\"\n\nHe continued his way. The tunnel ended in another and a larger cave,\nwith, on the opposite side, the first steps of a staircase that led\nupward.\n\n\"It's the ascent of the Needle beginning,\" said Ganimard. \"This is more\nserious.\"\n\nBut one of his men called him:\n\n\"There's another flight here, sir, on the left.\"\n\nAnd, immediately afterward, they discovered a third, on the right.\n\n\"The deuce!\" muttered the inspector. \"This complicates matters. If we\ngo by this way, they'll make tracks by that.\"\n\n\"Shall we separate?\" asked Beautrelet.\n\n\"No, no--that would mean weakening ourselves. It would be better for\none of us to go ahead and scout.\"\n\n\"I will, if you like--\"\n\n\"Very well, Beautrelet, you go. I will remain with my men--then there\nwill be no fear of anything. There may be other roads through the cliff\nthan that by which we came and several roads also through the Needle.\nBut it is certain that, between the cliff and the Needle, there is no\ncommunication except the tunnel. Therefore they must pass through this\ncave. And so I shall stay here till you come back. Go ahead,\nBeautrelet, and be prudent: at the least alarm, scoot back again.\"\n\nIsidore disappeared briskly up the middle staircase. At the thirtieth\nstep, a door, an ordinary wooden door, stopped him. He seized the\nhandle turned it. The door was not locked.\n\nHe entered a room that seemed to him very low owing to its immense\nsize. Lit by powerful lamps and supported by squat pillars, with long\nvistas showing between them, it had nearly the same dimensions as the\nNeedle itself. It was crammed with packing cases and miscellaneous\nobjects--pieces of furniture, oak settees, chests, credence-tables,\nstrong-boxes--a whole confused heap of the kind which one sees in the\nbasement of an old curiosity shop.\n\nOn his right and left, Beautrelet perceived the wells of two\nstaircases, the same, no doubt, that started from the cave below. He\ncould easily have gone down, therefore, and told Ganimard. But a new\nflight of stairs led upward in front of him and he had the curiosity to\npursue his investigations alone.\n\nThirty more steps. A door and then a room, not quite so large as the\nlast, Beautrelet thought. And again, opposite him, an ascending flight\nof stairs.\n\nThirty steps more. A door. A smaller room.\n\nBeautrelet grasped the plan of the works executed inside the Needle. It\nwas a series or rooms placed one above the other and, therefore,\ngradually decreasing in size. They all served as store-rooms.\n\nIn the fourth, there was no lamp. A little light filtered in through\nclefts in the walls and Beautrelet saw the sea some thirty feet below\nhim.\n\nAt that moment, he felt himself so far from Ganimard that a certain\nanguish began to take hold of him and he had to master his nerves lest\nhe should take to his heels. No danger threatened him, however, and the\nsilence around him was even so great that he asked himself whether the\nwhole Needle had not been abandoned by Lupin and his confederates.\n\n\"I shall not go beyond the next floor,\" he said to himself.\n\nThirty stairs again and a door. This door was lighter in construction\nand modern in appearance. He pushed it open gently, quite prepared for\nflight. There was no one there. But the room differed from the others\nin its purpose. There were hangings on the walls, rugs on the floor.\nTwo magnificent sideboards, laden with gold and silver plate, stood\nfacing each other. The little windows contrived in the deep, narrow\ncleft were furnished with glass panes.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a richly-decked table, with a lace-edged\ncloth, dishes of fruits and cakes, champagne in decanters and flowers,\nheaps of flowers.\n\nThree places were laid around the table.\n\nBeautrelet walked up. On the napkins were cards with the names of the\nparty. He read first:\n\n\"Arsene Lupin.\"\n\n\"Mme. Arsene Lupin.\"\n\nHe took up the third card and started back with surprise. It bore his\nown name:\n\n\"Isidore Beautrelet!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nTHE TREASURES OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE\n\n\nA curtain was drawn back.\n\n\"Good morning, my dear Beautrelet, you're a little late. Lunch was\nfixed for twelve. However, it's only a few minutes--but what's the\nmatter? Don't you know me? Have I changed so much?\"\n\nIn the course of his fight with Lupin, Beautrelet had met with many\nsurprises and he was still prepared, at the moment of the final\ncatastrophe, to experience any number of further emotions; but the\nshock which he received this time was utterly unexpected. It was not\nastonishment, but stupefaction, terror. The man who stood before him,\nthe man whom the brutal force of events compelled him to look upon as\nArsene Lupin, was--Valmeras! Valmeras, the owner of the Chateau de\nl'Aiguille! Valmeras, the very man to whom he had applied for\nassistance against Arsene Lupin! Valmeras, his companion on the\nexpedition to Crozant! Valmeras, the plucky friend who had made\nRaymonde's escape possible by felling one of Lupin's accomplices, or\npretending to fell him, in the dusk of the great hall! And Valmeras was\nLupin!\n\n\"You--you--So it's you!\" he stammered.\n\n\"Why not?\" exclaimed Lupin. \"Did you think that you knew me for good\nand all because you had seen me in the guise of a clergyman or under\nthe features of M. Massiban? Alas, when a man selects the position in\nsociety which I occupy, he must needs make use of his little social\ngifts! If Lupin were not able to change himself, at will, into a\nminister of the Church of England or a member of the Academy of\nInscriptions and Belles-Lettres, it would be a bad lookout for Lupin!\nNow Lupin, the real Lupin, is here before you, Beautrelet! Take a good\nlook at him.\"\n\n\"But then--if it's you--then--Mademoiselle--\"\n\n\"Yes, Beautrelet, as you say--\"\n\nHe again drew back the hanging, beckoned and announced:\n\n\"Mme. Arsene Lupin.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" murmured the lad, confounded in spite of everything, \"Mlle. de\nSaint-Veran!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" protested Lupin. \"Mme. Arsene Lupin, or rather, if you\nprefer, Mme. Louis Valmeras, my wedded wife, married to me in\naccordance with the strictest forms of law; and all thanks to you, my\ndear Beautrelet.\"\n\nHe held out his hand to him.\n\n\"All my acknowledgements--and no ill will on your side, I trust?\"\n\nStrange to say, Beautrelet felt no ill will at all, no sense of\nhumiliation, no bitterness. He realized so strongly the immense\nsuperiority of his adversary that he did not blush at being beaten by\nhim. He pressed the offered hand.\n\n\"Luncheon is served, ma'am.\"\n\nA butler had placed a tray of dishes on the table.\n\n\"You must excuse us, Beautrelet: my chef is away and we can only give\nyou a cold lunch.\"\n\nBeautrelet felt very little inclined to eat. He sat down, however, and\nwas enormously interested in Lupin's attitude. How much exactly did he\nknow? Was he aware of the danger he was running? Was he ignorant of the\npresence of Ganimard and his men?\n\nAnd Lupin continued:\n\n\"Yes, thanks to you, my dear friend. Certainly, Raymonde and I loved\neach other from the first. Just so, my boy--Raymonde's abduction, her\nimprisonment, were mere humbug: we loved each other. But neither she\nnor I, when we were free to love, would allow a casual bond at the\nmercy of chance, to be formed between us. The position, therefore, was\nhopeless for Lupin. Fortunately, it ceased to be so if I resumed my\nidentity as the Louis Valmeras that I had been from a child. It was\nthen that I conceived the idea, as you refused to relinquish your quest\nand had found the Chateau de l'Aiguille, of profiting by your\nobstinacy.\"\n\n\"And my silliness.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Any one would have been caught as you were!\"\n\n\"So you were really able to succeed because I screened you and assisted\nyou?\"\n\n\"Of course! How could any one suspect Valmeras of being Lupin, when\nValmeras was Beautrelet's friend and after Valmeras had snatched from\nLupin's clutches the girl whom Lupin loved? And how charming it was!\nSuch delightful memories! The expedition to Crozant! The bouquets we\nfound! My pretended love letter to Raymonde! And, later, the\nprecautions which I, Valmeras, had to take against myself, Lupin,\nbefore my marriage! And the night of your great banquet, Beautrelet,\nwhen you fainted in my arms! Oh, what memories!\"\n\nThere was a pause. Beautrelet watched Raymonde. She had listened to\nLupin without saying a word and looked at him with eyes in which he\nread love, passion and something else besides, something which the lad\ncould not define, a sort of anxious embarrassment and a vague sadness.\nBut Lupin turned his eyes upon her and she gave him an affectionate\nsmile. Their hands met over the table.\n\n\"What do you say to the way I have arranged my little home,\nBeautrelet?\" cried Lupin. \"There's a style about it, isn't there? I\ndon't pretend that it's as comfortable as it might be. And yet, some\nhave been quite satisfied with it; and not the least of mankind,\neither!--Look at the list of distinguished people who have owned the\nNeedle in their time and who thought it an honor to leave a mark of\ntheir sojourn.\"\n\nOn the walls, one below the other, were carved the following names:\n\n  JULIUS CAESAR\n  CHARLEMAGNE ROLLO\n  WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR\n  RICHARD COEUR-DE-LEON\n  LOUIS XI.\n  FRANCIS I.\n  HENRY IV.\n  LOUIS XIV.\n  ARSENE LUPIN\n\n\"Whose name will figure after ours?\" he continued. \"Alas, the list is\nclosed! From Caesar to Lupin--and there it ends. Soon the nameless mob\nwill come to visit the strange citadel. And to think that, but for\nLupin, all this would have remained for ever unknown to men! Ah\nBeautrelet, what a feeling of pride was mine on the day when I first\nset foot on this abandoned soil. To have found the lost secret and\nbecome its master, its sole master! To inherit such an inheritance! To\nlive in the Needle, after all those kings!--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a gesture of his wife's. She seemed greatly\nagitated.\n\n\"There is a noise,\" she said. \"Underneath us.--You can hear it.\"\n\n\"It's the lapping of the water,\" said Lupin.\n\n\"No, indeed it's not. I know the sound of the waves. This is something\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"What would you have it be, darling?\" said Lupin, smiling. \"I invited\nno one to lunch except Beautrelet.\" And, addressing the servant,\n\"Charolais, did you lock the staircase doors behind the gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and fastened the bolts.\"\n\nLupin rose:\n\n\"Come, Raymonde, don't shake like that. Why, you're quite pale!\"\n\nHe spoke a few words to her in an undertone, as also to the servant,\ndrew back the curtain and sent them both out of the room.\n\nThe noise below grew more distinct. It was a series of dull blows,\nrepeated at intervals. Beautrelet thought:\n\n\"Ganimard has lost patience and is breaking down the doors.\"\n\nLupin resumed the thread of his conversation, speaking very calmly and\nas though he had really not heard:\n\n\"By Jove, the Needle was badly damaged when I succeeded in discovering\nit! One could see that no one had possessed the secret for more than a\ncentury, since Louis XVI. and the Revolution. The tunnel was\nthreatening to fall in. The stairs were in a shocking state. The water\nwas trickling in from the sea. I had to prop up and strengthen and\nrebuild the whole thing.\"\n\nBeautrelet could not help asking:\n\n\"When you arrived, was it empty?\"\n\n\"Very nearly. The kings did not use the Needle, as I have done, as a\nwarehouse.\"\n\n\"As a place of refuge, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt, in times of invasion and during the civil wars. But its\nreal destination was to be--how shall I put it?--the strong-room or the\nbank of the kings of France.\"\n\nThe sound of blows increased, more distinctly now. Ganimard must have\nbroken down the first door and was attacking the second. There was a\nshort silence and then more blows, nearer still. It was the third door.\nTwo remained.\n\nThrough one of the windows, Beautrelet saw a number of fishing-smacks\nsailing round the Needle and, not far away, floating on the waters like\na great black fish, the torpedo-boat.\n\n\"What a row!\" exclaimed Lupin. \"One can't hear one's self speak! Let's\ngo upstairs, shall we? It may interest you to look over the Needle.\"\n\nThey climbed to the floor above, which was protected, like the others,\nby a door which Lupin locked behind him.\n\n\"My picture gallery,\" he said.\n\nThe walls were covered with canvases on which Beautrelet recognized the\nmost famous signatures. There were Raphael's Madonna of the Agnus Dei,\nAndrea del Sarto's Portrait of Lucrezia Fede, Titian's Salome,\nBotticelli's Madonna and Angels and numbers of Tintorettos, Carpaccios,\nRembrandts, Velasquez.\n\n\"What fine copies!\" said Beautrelet, approvingly.\n\nLupin looked at him with an air of stupefaction:\n\n\"What! Copies! You must be mad! The copies are in Madrid, my dear\nfellow, in Florence, Venice, Munich, Amsterdam.\"\n\n\"Then these--\"\n\n\"Are the original pictures, my lad, patiently collected in all the\nmuseums of Europe, where I have replaced them, like an honest man, with\nfirst-rate copies.\"\n\n\"But some day or other--\"\n\n\"Some day or other, the fraud will be discovered? Well, they will find\nmy signature on each canvas--at the back--and they will know that it\nwas I who have endowed my country with the original masterpieces. After\nall, I have only done what Napoleon did in Italy.--Oh, look,\nBeautrelet: here are M. de Gesvres's four Rubenses!--\"\n\nThe knocking continued within the hollow of the Needle without ceasing.\n\n\"I can't stand this!\" said Lupin. \"Let's go higher.\"\n\nA fresh staircase. A fresh door.\n\n\"The tapestry-room,\" Lupin announced.\n\nThe tapestries were not hung on the walls, but rolled, tied up with\ncord, ticketed; and, in addition, there were parcels of old fabrics\nwhich Lupin unfolded: wonderful brocades, admirable velvets, soft,\nfaded silks, church vestments woven with silver and gold--\n\nThey went higher still and Beautrelet saw the room containing the\nclocks and other time-pieces, the book-room--oh, the splendid bindings,\nthe precious, undiscoverable volumes, the unique copies stolen from the\ngreat public libraries--the lace-room, the knicknack-room.\n\nAnd each time the circumference of the room grew smaller.\n\nAnd each time, now, the sound of knocking was more distant. Ganimard\nwas losing ground.\n\n\"This is the last room,\" said Lupin. \"The treasury.\"\n\nThis one was quite different. It was round also, but very high and\nconical in shape. It occupied the top of the edifice and its floor must\nhave been fifteen or twenty yards below the extreme point of the Needle.\n\nOn the cliff side there was no window. But on the side of the sea,\nwhence there were no indiscreet eyes to fear, two glazed openings\nadmitted plenty of light.\n\nThe ground was covered with a parqueted flooring of rare wood, forming\nconcentric patterns. Against the walls stood glass cases and a few\npictures.\n\n\"The pearls of my collection,\" said Lupin. \"All that you have seen so\nfar is for sale. Things come and things go. That's business. But here,\nin this sanctuary, everything is sacred. There is nothing here but\nchoice, essential pieces, the best of the best, priceless things. Look\nat these jewels, Beautrelet: Chaldean amulets, Egyptian necklaces,\nCeltic bracelets, Arab chains. Look at these statuettes, Beautrelet, at\nthis Greek Venus, this Corinthian Apollo. Look at these Tanagras,\nBeautrelet: all the real Tanagras are here. Outside this glass case,\nthere is not a single genuine Tanagra statuette in the whole wide\nworld. What a delicious thing to be able to say!--Beautrelet, do you\nremember Thomas and his gang of church-pillagers in the South--agents\nof mine, by the way? Well, here is the Ambazac reliquary, the real one,\nBeautrelet! Do you remember the Louvre scandal, the tiara which was\nadmitted to be false, invented and manufactured by a modern artist?\nHere is the tiara of Saitapharnes, the real one, Beautrelet! Look,\nBeautrelet, look with all your eyes: here is the marvel of marvels, the\nsupreme masterpiece, the work of no mortal brain; here is Leonardo's\nGioconda, the real one! Kneel, Beautrelet, kneel; all womankind stands\nbefore you in this picture.\"\n\nThere was a long silence between them. Below, the sound of blows drew\nnearer. Two or three doors, no more, separated them from Ganimard. In\nthe offing, they saw the black back of the torpedo-boat and the\nfishing-smacks cruising to and fro.\n\nThe boy asked:\n\n\"And the treasure?\"\n\n\"Ah, my little man, that's what interests you most! None of those\nmasterpieces of human art can compete with the contemplation of the\ntreasure as a matter of curiosity, eh?--And the whole crowd will be\nlike you!--Come, you shall be satisfied.\"\n\nHe stamped his foot, and, in so doing, made one of the discs composing\nthe floor-pattern turn right over. Then, lifting it as though it were\nthe lid of a box, he uncovered a sort of large round bowl, dug in the\nthickness of the rock. It was empty.\n\nA little farther, he went through the same performance. Another large\nbowl appeared. It was also empty.\n\nHe did this three times over again. The three other bowls were empty.\n\n\"Eh,\" grinned Lupin. \"What a disappointment! Under Louis XL, under\nHenry IV., under Richelieu, the five bowls were full. But think of\nLouis XIV., the folly of Versailles, the wars, the great disasters of\nthe reign! And think of Louis XV., the spendthrift king, with his\nPompadour and his Du Barry! How they must have drawn on the treasure in\nthose days! With what thieving claws they must have scratched at the\nstone. You see, there's nothing left.\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"Yes, Beautrelet, there is something--the sixth hiding-place! This one\nwas intangible. Not one of them dared touch it. It was the very last\nresource, the nest-egg, the something put by for a rainy day. Look,\nBeautrelet!\"\n\nHe stooped and lifted up the lid. An iron box filled the bowl. Lupin\ntook from his pocket a key with a complicated bit and wards and opened\nthe box.\n\nA dazzling sight presented itself. Every sort of precious stone\nsparkled there, every color gleamed, the blue of the sapphires, the red\nof the rubies, the green of the emeralds, the yellow of the topazes.\n\n\"Look, look, little Beautrelet! They have squandered all the cash, all\nthe gold, all the silver, all the crown pieces and all the ducats and\nall the doubloons; but the chest with the jewels has remained intact.\nLook at the settings. They belong to every period, to every century, to\nevery country. The dowries of the queens are here. Each brought her\nshare: Margaret of Scotland and Charlotte of Savoy; duchesses of\nAustria: Eleonore, Elisabeth, Marie-Therese, Mary of England and\nCatherine de Medicis; and all the arch--Marie Antoinette. Look at those\npearls, Beautrelet! And those diamonds: look at the size of the\ndiamonds! Not one of them but is worthy of an empress! The Pitt Diamond\nis no finer!\"\n\nHe rose to his feet and held up his hand as one taking an oath:\n\n\"Beautrelet, you shall tell the world that Lupin has not taken a single\none of the stones that were in the royal chest, not a single one, I\nswear it on my honor! I had no right to. They are the fortune of\nFrance.\"\n\nBelow them, Ganimard was making all speed. It was easy to judge by the\nreverberation of the blows that his men were attacking the last door\nbut one, the door that gave access to the knicknack-room.\n\n\"Let us leave the chest open,\" said Lupin, \"and all the cavities, too,\nall those little empty graves.\"\n\nHe went round the room, examined some of the glass cases, gazed at some\nof the pictures and, as he walked, said, pensively:\n\n\"How sad it is to leave all this! What a wrench! The happiest hours of\nmy life have been spent here, alone, in the presence of these objects\nwhich I loved. And my eyes will never behold them again and my hands\nwill never touch them again--\"\n\nHis drawn face bore such an expression of lassitude upon it that\nBeautrelet felt a vague sort of pity for him. Sorrow in that man must\nassume larger proportions than in another, even as joy did, or pride,\nor humiliation. He was now standing by the window, and, with his finger\npointing to the horizon, said:\n\n\"What is sadder still is that I must abandon that, all that! How\nbeautiful it is! The boundless sea--the sky.--On either side, the\ncliffs of Etretat with their three natural archways: the Porte\nd'Armont, the Porte d'Aval, the Manneporte--so many triumphal arches\nfor the master. And the master was I! I was the king of the story, the\nking of fairyland, the king of the Hollow Needle! A strange and\nsupernatural kingdom! From Caesar to Lupin: what a destiny!\" He burst\nout laughing. \"King of fairyland! Why not say King of Yvetot at once?\nWhat nonsense! King of the world, yes, that's more like it! From this\ntopmost point of the Needle, I ruled the globe! I held it in my claws\nlike a prey! Lift the tiara of Saitapharnes, Beautrelet.--You see those\ntwo telephones? The one on the right communicates with Paris: a private\nline; the one on the left with London: a private line. Through London,\nI am in touch with America, Asia, Australia, South Africa. In all those\ncontinents, I have my offices, my agents, my jackals, my scouts! I\ndrive an international trade. I hold the great market in art and\nantiquities, the world's fair! Ah, Beautrelet, there are moments when\nmy power turns my head! I feel intoxicated with strength and authority.\"\n\nThe door gave way below. They heard Ganimard and his men running about\nand searching.\n\nAfter a moment, Lupin continued, in a low voice:\n\n\"And now it's over. A little girl crossed my path, a girl with soft\nhair and wistful eyes and an honest, yes, an honest soul--and it's\nover. I myself am demolishing the mighty edifice.--All the rest seems\nabsurd and childish to me--nothing counts but her hair--and her wistful\neyes--and her honest little soul--\"\n\nThe men came up the staircase. A blow shook the door, the last door--\n\nLupin seized the boy sharply by the arm:\n\n\"Do you understand, Beautrelet, why I let you have things your own way\nwhen I could have crushed you, time after time, weeks ago? Do you\nunderstand how you succeeded in getting as far as this? Do you\nunderstand that I had given each of my men his share of the plunder\nwhen you met them the other night on the cliff? You do understand,\ndon't you? The Hollow Needle is the great adventure. As long as it\nbelongs to me, I remain the great adventurer. Once the Needle is\nrecaptured, it means that the past and I are parted and that the future\nbegins, a future of peace and happiness, in which I shall have no\noccasion to blush when Raymonde's eyes are turned upon me, a future--\"\n\nHe turned furiously toward the door:\n\n\"Stop that noise, Ganimard, will you? I haven't finished my speech!\"\n\nThe blows came faster. It was like the sound of a beam that was being\nhurled against the door. Beautrelet, mad with curiosity, stood in front\nof Lupin and awaited events, without understanding what Lupin was doing\nor contemplating. To give up the Needle was all very well; but why was\nhe giving up himself? What was his plan? Did he hope to escape from\nGanimard? And, on the other hand, where was Raymonde?\n\nLupin, meantime, was murmuring, dreamily:\n\n\"An honest man.--Arsene Lupin an honest man--no more robbery--leading\nthe life of everybody else.--And why not? There is no reason why I\nshould not meet with the same success.--But do stop that now, Ganimard!\nDon't you know, you ass, that I'm uttering historic words and that\nBeautrelet is taking them in for the benefit of posterity?\" He laughed.\n\"I am wasting my time. Ganimard will never grasp the use of my historic\nwords.\"\n\nHe took a piece of red chalk, put a pair of steps to the wall and\nwrote, in large letters:\n\n   Arsene Lupin gives and bequeaths to France\n   all the treasures contained in the Hollow Needle,\n   on the sole condition that these treasures be housed\n   at the Musee du Louvre in rooms which shall be\n   known as the Arsene Lupin Rooms.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"my conscience is at ease. France and I are quits.\"\n\nThe attackers were striking with all their might. One of the panels\nburst in two. A hand was put through and fumbled for the lock.\n\n\"Thunder!\" said Lupin. \"That idiot of a Ganimard is capable of\neffecting his purpose for once in his life.\"\n\nHe rushed to the lock and removed the key.\n\n\"Sold, old chap!--The door's tough.--I have plenty of time--Beautrelet,\nI must say good-bye. And thank you!--For really you could have\ncomplicated the attack--but you're so tactful!\"\n\nWhile speaking, he moved toward a large triptych by Van der Weyden,\nrepresenting the Wise Men of the East. He shut the right-hand panel\nand, in so doing, exposed a little door concealed behind it and seized\nthe handle.\n\n\"Good luck to your hunting, Ganimard! And kind regards at home!\"\n\nA pistol-shot resounded. Lupin jumped back: \"Ah, you rascal, full in\nthe heart! Have you been taking lessons? You've done for the Wise Man!\nFull in the heart! Smashed to smithereens, like a pipe at the fair!--\"\n\n\"Lupin, surrender!\" roared Ganimard, with his eyes glittering and his\nrevolver showing through the broken panel of the door. \"Surrender, I\nsay!\"\n\n\"Did the old guard surrender?\"\n\n\"If you stir a limb, I'll blow your brains out!\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You can't get me here!\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, Lupin had moved away; and, though Ganimard was\nable to fire straight in front of him through the breach in the door,\nhe could not fire, still less take aim, on the side where Lupin stood.\nLupin's position was a terrible one for all that, because the outlet on\nwhich he was relying, the little door behind the triptych, opened right\nin front of Ganimard. To try to escape meant to expose himself to the\ndetective's fire; and there were five bullets left in the revolver.\n\n\"By Jove,\" he said, laughing, \"there's a slump in my shares this\nafternoon! You've done a nice thing. Lupin, old fellow: you wanted a\nlast sensation and you've gone a bit too far. You shouldn't have talked\nso much.\"\n\nHe flattened himself against the wall. A further portion of the panel\nhad given way under the men's pressure and Ganimard was less hampered\nin his movements. Three yards, no more, separated the two antagonists.\nBut Lupin was protected by a glass case with a gilt-wood framework.\n\n\"Why don't you help, Beautrelet?\" cried the old detective, gnashing his\nteeth with rage. \"Why don't you shoot him, instead of staring at him\nlike that?\"\n\nIsidore, in fact, had not budged, had remained, till that moment, an\neager, but passive spectator. He would have liked to fling himself into\nthe contest with all his strength and to bring down the prey which he\nheld at his mercy. He was prevented by some inexplicable sentiment.\n\nBut Ganimard's appeal for assistance shook him. His hand closed on the\nbutt of his revolver:\n\n\"If I take part in it,\" he thought, \"Lupin is lost. And I have the\nright--it's my duty.\"\n\nTheir eyes met. Lupin's were calm, watchful, almost inquisitive, as\nthough, in the awful danger that threatened him, he were interested\nonly in the moral problem that held the young man in its clutches.\nWould Isidore decide to give the finishing stroke to the defeated enemy?\n\nThe door cracked from top to bottom.\n\n\"Help, Beautrelet, we've got him!\" Ganimard bellowed.\n\nIsidore raised his revolver.\n\nWhat happened was so quick that he knew of it, so to speak, only by the\nresult. He saw Lupin bob down and run along the wall, skimming the door\nright under the weapon which Ganimard was vainly brandishing; and he\nfelt himself suddenly flung to the ground, picked up the next moment\nand lifted by an invincible force.\n\nLupin held him in the air, like a living shield, behind which he hid\nhimself.\n\n\"Ten to one that I escape, Ganimard! Lupin, you see, has never quite\nexhausted his resources--\"\n\nHe had taken a couple of brisk steps backward to the triptych. Holding\nBeautrelet with one hand flat against his chest, with the other he\ncleared the passage and closed the little door behind them.\n\nA steep staircase appeared before their eyes.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Lupin, pushing Beautrelet before him. \"The land\nforces are beaten--let us turn our attention to the French\nfleet.--After Waterloo, Trafalgar.--You're having some fun for your\nmoney, eh, my lad?--Oh, how good: listen to them knocking at the\ntriptych now!--It's too late, my children.--But hurry along,\nBeautrelet!\"\n\nThe staircase, dug out in the wall of the Needle, dug in its very\ncrust, turned round and round the pyramid, encircling it like the\nspiral of a tobogganslide. Each hurrying the other, they clattered down\nthe treads, taking two or three at a bound. Here and there, a ray of\nlight trickled through a fissure; and Beautrelet carried away the\nvision of the fishing-smacks hovering a few dozen fathoms off, and of\nthe black torpedo-boat.\n\nThey went down and down, Isidore in silence, Lupin still bubbling over\nwith merriment:\n\n\"I should like to know what Ganimard is doing? Is he tumbling down the\nother staircases to bar the entrance to the tunnel against me? No, he's\nnot such a fool as that. He must have left four men there--and four men\nare sufficient--\" He stopped. \"Listen--they're shouting up above.\nThat's it, they've opened the window and are calling to their\nfleet.--Why, look, the men are busy on board the smacks--they're\nexchanging signals.--The torpedo-boat is moving.--Dear old\ntorpedo-boat! I know you, you're from the Havre.--Guns' crews to the\nguns!--Hullo, there's the commander!--How are you, Duguay-Trouin?\"\n\nHe put his arm through a cleft and waved his handkerchief. Then he\ncontinued his way downstairs:\n\n\"The enemy's fleet have set all sail,\" he said. \"We shall be boarded\nbefore we know where we are. Heavens, what fun!\"\n\nThey heard the sound of voices below them. They were just then\napproaching the level of the sea and they emerged, almost at once, into\na large cave into which two lanterns were moving about in the dark.\n\nA woman's figure appeared and threw itself on Lupin's neck:\n\n\"Quick, quick, I was so nervous about you. What have you been\ndoing?--But you're not alone!--\"\n\nLupin reassured her:\n\n\"It's our friend Beautrelet.--Just think, Beautrelet had the tact--but\nI'll talk about that later--there's no time now.--Charolais are you\nthere? That's right!--And the boat?\"\n\n\"The boat's ready, sir,\" Charolais replied,\n\n\"Fire away,\" said Lupin.\n\nIn a moment, the noise of a motor crackled and Beautrelet, whose eyes\nwere gradually becoming used to the gloom, ended by perceiving that\nthey were on a sort of quay, at the edge of the water, and that a boat\nwas floating before them.\n\n\"A motor boat,\" said Lupin, completing Beautrelet's observations. \"This\nknocks you all of a heap, eh, Isidore, old chap?--You don't\nunderstand.--Still, you have only to think.--As the water before your\neyes is no other than the water of the sea, which filters into this\nexcavation each high tide, the result is that I have a safe little\nprivate roadstead all to myself.\"\n\n\"But it's closed,\" Beautrelet protested. \"No one can get in or out.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Lupin; \"and I'm going to prove it to you.\"\n\nHe began by handing Raymonde in. Then he came back to fetch Beautrelet.\nThe lad hesitated.\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" asked Lupin.\n\n\"What of?\"\n\n\"Of being sunk by the torpedo-boat.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you're considering whether it's not your duty to stay with\nGanimard, law and order, society and morality, instead of going off\nwith Lupin, shame, infamy and disgrace.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, my boy, you have no choice. For the moment, they must\nbelieve the two of us dead--and leave me the peace to which a\nprospective honest man is entitled. Later on, when I have given you\nyour liberty, you can talk as much as you please--I shall have nothing\nmore to fear.\"\n\nBy the way in which Lupin clutched his arm, Beautrelet felt that all\nresistance was useless. Besides, why resist? Had he not discovered and\nhanded over the Hollow Needle? What did he care about the rest? Had he\nnot the right to humor the irresistible sympathy with which, in spite\nof everything, this man inspired him?\n\nThe feeling was so clear in him that he was half inclined to say to\nLupin:\n\n\"Look here, you're running another, a more serious danger; Holmlock\nShears is on your track.\"\n\n\"Come along!\" said Lupin, before Isidore had made up his mind to speak.\n\nHe obeyed and let Lupin lead him to the boat, the shape of which struck\nhim as peculiar and its appearance quite unexpected.\n\nOnce on deck, they went down a little steep staircase, or rather a\nladder hooked on to a trap door, which closed above their heads. At the\nfoot of the ladder, brightly lit by a lamp, was a very small saloon,\nwhere Raymonde was waiting for them and where the three had just room\nto sit down.\n\nLupin took the mouthpiece of a speaking tube from a hook and gave the\norder:\n\n\"Let her go, Charolais!\"\n\nIsidore had the unpleasant sensation which one feels when going down in\na lift: the sensation of the ground vanishing beneath you, the\nimpression of emptiness, space. This time, it was the water retreating;\nand space opened out, slowly.\n\n\"We're sinking, eh?\" grinned Lupin. \"Don't be afraid--we've only to\npass from the upper cave where we were to another little cave, situated\nright at the bottom and half open to the sea, which can be entered at\nlow tide. All the shellfish-catchers know it. Ah, ten seconds' wait!\nWe're going through the passage and it's very narrow, just the size of\nthe submarine.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Beautrelet, \"how is it that the fishermen who enter the\nlower cave don't know that it's open at the top and that it\ncommunicates with another from which a staircase starts and runs\nthrough the Needle? The facts are at the disposal of the first-comer.\"\n\n\"Wrong, Beautrelet! The top of the little public cave is closed, at low\ntide, by a movable platform, painted the color of the rock, which the\nsea, when it rises, shifts and carries up with it and, when it goes\ndown, fastens firmly over the little cave. That is why I am able to\npass at high tide. A clever notion, what? It's an idea of my own. True,\nneither Caesar nor Louis XIV., nor, in short, any of my distinguished\npredecessors could have had it, because they did not possess\nsubmarines. They were satisfied with the staircase, which then ran all\nthe way down to the little bottom cave. I did away with the last treads\nof the staircase and invented the trick of the movable ceiling: it's a\npresent I'm making to France--Raymonde, my love, put out the lamp\nbeside you--we shan't want it now--on the contrary--\"\n\nA pale light, which seemed to be of the same color as the water, met\nthem as they left the cave and made its way into the cabin through the\ntwo portholes and through a thick glass skylight that projected above\nthe planking of the deck and allowed the passengers to inspect the\nupper layers of the sea. And, suddenly, a shadow glided over their\nheads.\n\n\"The attack is about to take place. The fleet is investing the Needle.\nBut, hollow as the Needle is, I don't see how they propose to enter it.\"\n\nHe took up the speaking tube:\n\n\"Don't leave the bottom, Charolais. Where are we going? Why, I told\nyou: to Port-Lupin. And at full speed, do you hear? We want water to\nland by--there's a lady with us.\"\n\nThey skimmed over the rocky bed. The seaweed stood up on end like a\nheavy, dark vegetation and the deep currents made it wave gracefully,\nstretching and billowing like floating hair.\n\nAnother shadow, a longer one.\n\n\"That's the torpedo-boat,\" said Lupin. \"We shall hear the roar of the\nguns presently. What will Duguay-Trouin do? Bombard the Needle? Think\nof what we're missing, Beautrelet, by not being present at the meeting\nof Duguay-Trouin and Ganimard! The juncture of the land and naval\nforces! Hi, Charolais, don't go to sleep, my man!\"\n\nThey were moving very fast, for all that. The rocks had been succeeded\nby sand-fields and then, almost at once, they saw more rocks, which\nmarked the eastern extremity of Etretat, the Porte d'Amont. Fish fled\nat their approach. One of them, bolder than the rest, fastened on to a\nporthole and looked at the occupants of the saloon with its great,\nfixed, staring eyes.\n\n\"That's better,\" cried Lupin. \"We're going now. What do you think of my\ncockle-shell, Beautrelet? Not so bad, is she? Do you remember the story\nof the Seven of Hearts,[11] the wretched end of Lacombe, the engineer,\nand how, after punishing his murderers, I presented the State with his\npapers and his plans for the construction of a new submarine: one more\ngift to France? Well, among the plans, I kept those of a submersible\nmotor boat and that is how you come to have the honor of sailing in my\ncompany.\"\n\n\n[11] The Exploits of Arsene Lupin. By Maurice Leblanc. VI: The\nSeven of Hearts.\n\n\nHe called to Charolais:\n\n\"Take us up, Charolais--there's no danger now--\"\n\nThey shot up to the surface and the glass skylight emerged above the\nwater.\n\nThey were a mile from the coast, out of sight, therefore, and\nBeautrelet was now able to realize more fully at what a headlong pace\nthey were traveling. First Fecamp passed before them, then all the\nNorman seaside places: Saint-Pierre, the Petits--Dalles, Veulettes,\nSaint-Valery, Veules, Quiberville. Lupin kept on jesting and Isidore\nnever wearied of watching and listening to him, amazed as he was at the\nman's spirits, at his gaiety, his mischievous ways, his careless chaff,\nhis delight in life.\n\nHe also noticed Raymonde. The young woman sat silent, nestling up\nagainst the man she loved. She had taken his hands between her own and\nkept on raising her eyes to him; and Beautrelet constantly observed\nthat her hands were twitching and that the wistful sadness of her eyes\nincreased. And, each time, it was like a dumb and sorrowful reply to\nLupin's sallies. One would have thought that his frivolous words, his\nsarcastic outlook on life, caused her physical pain.\n\n\"Hush!\" she whispered. \"It's defying destiny to laugh--so many\nmisfortunes can reach us still!\"\n\nOpposite Dieppe, they had to dive lest they should be seen by the\nfishing-craft. And twenty minutes later, they shot at an angle toward\nthe coast and the boat entered a little submarine harbor formed by a\nregular gap between the rocks, drew up beside a jetty and rose gently\nto the surface.\n\nLupin announced:\n\n\"Port-Lupin!\"\n\nThe spot, situated at sixteen miles from Dieppe and twelve from the\nTreport and protected, moreover, by the two landslips of cliff, was\nabsolutely deserted. A fine sand carpeted the rounded slope of the tiny\nbeach.\n\n\"Jump on shore, Beautrelet--Raymonde, give me your hand. You,\nCharolais, go back to the Needle, see what happens between Ganimard and\nDuguay-Trouin and come back and tell me at the end of the day. The\nthing interests me tremendously.\"\n\nBeautrelet asked himself with a certain curiosity how they were going\nto get out of this hemmed-in creek which was called Port-Lupin, when,\nat the foot of the cliff, he saw the uprights of an iron ladder.\n\n\"Isidore,\" said Lupin, \"if you knew your geography and your history,\nyou would know that we are at the bottom of the gorge of Parfonval, in\nthe parish of Biville. More than a century ago, on the night of the\ntwenty-third of August, 1803, Georges Cadoudal and six accomplices, who\nhad landed in France with the intention of kidnapping the first consul,\nBonaparte, scrambled up to the top by the road which I will show you.\nSince then, this road has been demolished by landslips. But Louis\nValmeras, better known by the name of Arsene Lupin, had it restored at\nhis own expense and bought the farm of the Neuvillette, where the\nconspirators spent the first night and where, retired from business and\nwithdrawing from the affairs of this world, he means to lead the life\nof a respectable country squire with his wife and his mother by his\nside. The gentleman-burglar is dead! Long live the gentleman-farmer!\"\n\nAfter the ladder came a sort of gully, an abrupt ravine hollowed out,\napparently, by the rains, at the end of which they laid hold of a\nmakeshift staircase furnished with a hand-rail. As Lupin explained,\nthis hand-rail had been placed where it was in the stead of the\nestamperche, a long rope fastened to stakes, by which the people of the\ncountry, in the old days, used to help themselves down when going to\nthe beach.\n\nAfter a painful climb of half an hour, they emerged on the tableland,\nnot far from one of those little cabins, dug out of the soil itself,\nwhich serve as shelters for the excisemen. And, as it happened, two\nminutes later, at a turn in the path, one of these custom-house\nofficials appeared.\n\nHe drew himself up and saluted.\n\nLupin asked:\n\n\"Any news, Gomel?\"\n\n\"No, governor.\"\n\n\"You've met no one at all suspicious-looking?\"\n\n\"No, governor--only--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My wife--who does dressmaking at the Neuvillette--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know--Cesarine--my mother spoke of her. Well?\"\n\n\"It seems a sailor was prowling about the village this morning.\"\n\n\"What sort of face had he?\"\n\n\"Not a natural face--a sort of Englishman's face.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Lupin, in a tone preoccupied. \"And you have given Cesarine\norders--\"\n\n\"To keep her eyes open. Yes, governor.\"\n\n\"Very well. Keep a lookout for Charolais's return in two or three hours\nfrom now. If there's anything, I shall be at the farm.\"\n\nHe walked on and said to Beautrelet:\n\n\"This makes me uneasy--is it Shears? Ah, if it's he, in his present\nstate of exasperation, I have everything to fear!\"\n\nHe hesitated a moment: \"I wonder if we hadn't better turn back. Yes, I\nhave a nasty presentiment of evil.\"\n\nGently undulating plains stretched before them as far as the eye could\nsee. A little to the left, a series of handsome avenues of trees led to\nthe farm of the Neuvillette, the buildings of which were now in view.\nIt was the retreat which he had prepared, the haven of rest which he\nhad promised Raymonde. Was he, for the sake of an absurd idea, to\nrenounce happiness at the very moment when it seemed within his reach?\n\nHe took Isidore by the arm and, calling his attention to Raymonde, who\nwas walking in front of them:\n\n\"Look at her. When she walks, her figure has a little swing at the\nwaist which I cannot see without quivering. But everything in her gives\nme that thrill of emotion and love: her movements and her repose, her\nsilence and the sound of her voice. I tell you, the mere fact that I am\nwalking in the track of her footsteps makes me feel in the seventh\nheaven. Ah, Beautrelet, will she ever forget that I was once Lupin?\nShall I ever be able to wipe out from her memory the past which she\nloathes and detests?\" He mastered himself and, with obstinate\nassurance. \"She will forget!\" he declared. \"She will forget, because I\nhave made every sacrifice for her sake. I have sacrificed the\ninviolable sanctuary of the Hollow Needle, I have sacrificed my\ntreasures, my power, my pride--I will sacrifice everything--I don't\nwant to be anything more--but just a man in love--and an honest man,\nbecause she can only love an honest man. After all, why should I not be\nhonest? It is no more degrading than anything else!\"\n\nThe quip escaped him, so to speak, unawares. His voice remained serious\nand free of all chaff. And he muttered, with restrained violence:\n\n\"Ah, Beautrelet, you see, of all the unbridled joys which I have tasted\nin my adventurous life, there is not one that equals the joy with which\nher look fills me when she is pleased with me. I feel quite weak then,\nand I should like to cry--\" Was he crying? Beautrelet had an intuition\nthat his eyes were wet with tears. Tears in Lupin's eyes!--Tears of\nlove!\n\nThey were nearing an old gate that served as an entrance to the farm.\nLupin stopped for a moment and stammered:\n\n\"Why am I afraid?--I feel a sort of weight on my chest. Is the\nadventure of the Hollow Needle not over? Has destiny not accepted the\nissue which I selected?\"\n\nRaymonde turned round, looking very anxious.\n\n\"Here comes Cesarine. She's running.\"\n\nThe exciseman's wife was hurrying from the farm as fast as she could.\nLupin rushed up to her:\n\n\"What is it? What has happened? Speak!\"\n\nChoking, quite out of breath, Cesarine stuttered:\n\n\"A man--I saw a man this morning!\n\n\"A man--I saw a man in the sitting-room.\"\n\n\"The Englishman of this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes--but in a different disguise.\"\n\n\"Did he see you?\"\n\n\"No. He saw your mother. Mme. Valmeras caught him as he was just going\naway.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He told her that he was looking for Louis Valmeras, that he was a\nfriend of yours.\"\n\n\"Then?\"\n\n\"The madame said that her son had gone abroad--for years.\"\n\n\"And he went away?\"\n\n\"No, he made signs through the window that overlooks the plain--as if\nhe were calling to some one.\"\n\nLupin seemed to hesitate. A loud cry tore the air. Raymonde moaned:\n\n\"It's your mother--I recognize--\"\n\nHe flung himself upon her and, dragging her away, in a burst of fierce\npassion:\n\n\"Come--let us fly--you first.\"\n\nBut, suddenly, he stopped, distraught, overcome:\n\n\"No, I can't do it--it's too awful. Forgive me--Raymonde--that poor\nwoman down there--Stay here. Beautrelet, don't leave her.\"\n\nHe darted along the slope that surrounds the farm, turned and followed\nit, at a run, till he came to the gate that opens on the plain.\n\nRaymonde, whom Beautrelet had been unable to hold back, arrived almost\nas soon as he did; and Beautrelet, hiding behind the trees, saw, in the\nlonely walk that led from the farm to the gate, three men, of whom one,\nthe tallest, went ahead, while the two others were holding by the arms\na woman who tried to resist and who uttered moans of pain.\n\nThe daylight was beginning to fade. Nevertheless, Beautrelet recognized\nHolmlock Shears. The woman seemed of a certain age. Her livid features\nwere set in a frame of white hair.\n\nThey all four came up.\n\nThey reached the gate. Shears opened one of the folding leaves.\n\nThen Lupin strode forward and stood in front of him.\n\nThe encounter appeared all the more terrible inasmuch as it was silent,\nalmost solemn.\n\nFor long moments, the two enemies took each other's measure with their\neyes. An equal hatred distorted the features of both of them. Neither\nmoved.\n\nThen Lupin spoke, in a voice of terrifying calmness:\n\n\"Tell your men to leave that woman alone.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nIt was as though both of them feared to engage in the supreme struggle,\nas though both were collecting all their strength. And there were no\nwords wasted this time, no insults, no bantering challenges. Silence, a\ndeathlike silence.\n\nMad with anguish, Raymonde awaited the issue of the duel. Beautrelet\nhad caught her arms and was holding her motionless.\n\nAfter a second, Lupin repeated:\n\n\"Order your men to leave that woman alone.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nLupin said:\n\n\"Listen, Shears--\"\n\nBut he interrupted himself, realizing the silliness of the words. In\nthe face of that colossus of pride and will-power which called itself\nHolmlock Shears, of what use were threats?\n\nResolved upon the worst, suddenly he put his hand to his jacket pocket.\nThe Englishman anticipated his movement and, leaping upon his prisoner,\nthrust the barrel of his revolver within two inches of her temple:\n\n\"If you stir a limb, I fire!\"\n\nAt the same time his two satellites drew their weapons and aimed them\nat Lupin.\n\nLupin drew himself up, stifled the rage within him and, coolly, with\nhis hands in his pockets and his breast exposed to the enemy, began\nonce more:\n\n\"Shears, for the third time, let that woman be--\"\n\nThe Englishman sneered:\n\n\"I have no right to touch her, I suppose? Come, come, enough of this\nhumbug! Your name isn't Valmeras any more than it's Lupin: you stole\nthe name just as you stole the name of Charmerace. And the woman whom\nyou pass off as your mother is Victoire, your old accomplice, the one\nwho brought you up--\"[12]\n\n\n[12] Arsene Lupin, play in four acts, by Maurice Leblanc and\nFrancis de Croisset.\n\n\nShears made a mistake. Carried away by his longing for revenge, he\nglanced across at Raymonde, whom these revelations filled with horror.\nLupin took advantage of his imprudence. With a sudden movement, he\nfired.\n\n\"Damnation!\" bellowed Shears, whose arm, pierced by a bullet, fell to\nhis side. And, addressing his men, \"Shoot, you two! Shoot him down!\"\n\nBut already Lupin was upon them: and not two seconds had elapsed before\nthe one on the right was sprawling on the ground, with his chest\nsmashed, while the other, with his jaw broken, fell back against the\ngate.\n\n\"Hurry up, Victoire. Tie them down. And now, Mr. Englishman, it's you\nand I.\"\n\nHe ducked with an oath:\n\n\"Ah, you scoundrel!\"\n\nShears had picked up his revolver with his left hand and was taking aim\nat him.\n\nA shot--a cry of distress--Raymonde had flung herself between the two\nmen, facing the Englishman. She staggered back, brought her hand to her\nneck, drew herself up, spun round on her heels and fell at Lupin's feet.\n\n\"Raymonde!--Raymonde!\"\n\nHe threw himself upon her, took her in his arms and pressed her to him.\n\n\"Dead--\" he said.\n\nThere was a moment of stupefaction. Shears seemed confounded by his own\nact. Victoire stammered:\n\n\"My poor boy--my poor boy--\"\n\nBeautrelet went up to the young woman and stooped to examine her. Lupin\nrepeated:\n\n\"Dead--dead--\"\n\nHe said it in a reflective tone, as though he did not yet understand.\nBut his face became hollow, suddenly transformed, ravaged by grief. And\nthen he was seized with a sort of madness, made senseless gestures,\nwrung his hands, stamped his feet, like a child that suffers more than\nit is able to bear.\n\n\"You villain!\" he cried, suddenly, in an access of hatred.\n\nAnd, flinging Shears back with a formidable blow, he took him by the\nthroat and dug his twitching fingers into his flesh.\n\nThe Englishman gasped, without even struggling.\n\n\"My boy--my boy--\" said Victoire, in a voice of entreaty.\n\nBeautrelet ran up. But Lupin had already let go and stood sobbing\nbeside his enemy stretched upon the ground.\n\nO pitiful sight! Beautrelet never forgot its tragic horror, he who knew\nall Lupin's love for Raymonde and all that the great adventurer had\nsacrificed of his own being to bring a smile to the face of his\nwell-beloved.\n\nNight began to cover the field of battle with a shroud of darkness. The\nthree Englishmen lay bound and gagged in the tall grass. Distant songs\nbroke the vast silence of the plain. It was the farm-hands returning\nfrom their work.\n\nLupin drew himself up. He listened to the monotonous voices. Then he\nglanced at the happy homestead of the Neuvillette, where he had hoped\nto live peacefully with Raymonde. Then he looked at her, the poor,\nloving victim, whom love had killed and who, all white, was sleeping\nher last, eternal sleep.\n\nThe men were coming nearer, however.\n\nThen Lupin bent down, took the dead woman in his powerful arms, lifted\nthe corpse with a single effort and, bent in two, stretched it across\nhis back:\n\n\"Let us go, Victoire.\"\n\n\"Let us go, dear.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Beautrelet,\" he said.\n\nAnd, bearing his precious and awful burden followed by his old servant,\nsilent and fierce he turned toward the sea and plunged into the\ndarkness of the night.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Hollow Needle, by Maurice Leblanc\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HOLLOW NEEDLE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4017.txt or 4017.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/0\/1\/4017\/\n\nProduced by Charles Franks, Greg Weeks and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":16,"split":"train"}
