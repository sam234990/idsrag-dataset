{"ori_id":"56dedbff4098a09264f2032bf4242a7196fa0862","title":"The Sorrows of Satan","context":"The Sorrows of Satan\n On the surface the plot follows the story of a penniless, starving author called Geoffrey Tempest. So poor that he is behind on his rent and can barely afford light in his room, he receives three letters. The first is from a friend in Australia who has made his fortune and offers to introduce him to a good friend who might be able to lift him from poverty. The second is a note from a solicitor detailing that he has inherited a fortune from a deceased relative. The third is a letter of introduction from a foreign aristocrat called Lucio, who befriends him and proceeds to be his guide in how to best use his newfound wealth.\nTempest remains blissfully unaware throughout the novel, despite warnings from people he meets, that Lucio is the earthly incarnation of the Devil. Over the course of the book, his wealth leads to misery. Eventually, when confronted with the true nature of his companion, he renounces evil and returns to society penniless but content with the chance to purify his soul.\nAlthough the plot follows Tempest's fall from grace and redemption, he is in many regards a secondary character to Lucio. Both the title of the work and much of its philosophical content relate to the supreme yearning within Satan to achieve salvation. The book's main contribution to Faustian literature is the introduction of the concept that above all other people it is Satan who most truly believes in the Gospel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet he is forbidden to ever partake of it.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sorrows of Satan, by Marie Corelli\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Not poor with the arrogant poverty\ncomplained of by certain people who have five or six thousand a year to\nlive upon, and who yet swear they can hardly manage to make both ends\nmeet, but really poor,--downright, cruelly, hideously poor, with a\npoverty that is graceless, sordid and miserable? Poverty that compels\nyou to dress in your one suit of clothes till it is worn\nthreadbare,--that denies you clean linen on account of the ruinous\ncharges of washerwomen,--that robs you of your own self-respect, and\ncauses you to slink along the streets vaguely abashed, instead of\nwalking erect among your fellow-men in independent ease,--this is the\nsort of poverty I mean. This is the grinding curse that keeps down noble\naspiration under a load of ignoble care; this is the moral cancer that\neats into the heart of an otherwise well-intentioned human creature and\nmakes him envious and malignant, and inclined to the use of dynamite.\nWhen he sees the fat idle woman of society passing by in her luxurious\ncarriage, lolling back lazily, her face mottled with the purple and red\nsigns of superfluous eating,--when he observes the brainless and sensual\nman of fashion smoking and dawdling away the hours in the Park, as if\nall the world and its millions of honest hard workers were created\nsolely for the casual diversion of the so-called 'upper' classes,--then\nthe good blood in him turns to gall, and his suffering spirit rises in\nfierce rebellion, crying out--\"Why in God's name, should this injustice\nbe? Why should a worthless lounger have his pockets full of gold by mere\nchance and heritage, while I, toiling wearily from morn till midnight,\ncan scarce afford myself a satisfying meal?\"\n\nWhy indeed! Why should the wicked flourish like a green bay-tree? I have\noften thought about it. Now however I believe I could help to solve the\nproblem out of my own personal experience. But ... such an experience!\nWho will credit it? Who will believe that anything so strange and\nterrific ever chanced to the lot of a mortal man? No one. Yet it is\ntrue;--truer than much so-called truth. Moreover I know that many men\nare living through many such incidents as have occurred to me, under\nprecisely the same influence, conscious perhaps at times, that they are\nin the tangles of sin, but too weak of will to break the net in which\nthey have become voluntarily imprisoned. Will they be taught, I wonder,\nthe lesson I have learned? In the same bitter school, under the same\nformidable taskmaster? Will they realize as I have been forced to\ndo,--aye, to the very fibres of my intellectual perception,--the vast,\nindividual, active Mind, which behind all matter, works unceasingly,\nthough silently, a very eternal and positive God? If so, then dark\nproblems will become clear to them, and what seems injustice in the\nworld will prove pure equity! But I do not write with any hope of either\npersuading or enlightening my fellow-men. I know their obstinacy too\nwell;--I can gauge it by my own. My proud belief in myself was, at one\ntime, not to be outdone by any human unit on the face of the globe. And\nI am aware that others are in similar case. I merely intend to relate\nthe various incidents of my career in due order exactly as they\nhappened,--leaving to more confident heads the business of propounding\nand answering the riddles of human existence as best they may.\n\nDuring a certain bitter winter, long remembered for its arctic severity,\nwhen a great wave of intense cold spread freezing influences not alone\nover the happy isles of Britain, but throughout all Europe, I, Geoffrey\nTempest, was alone in London and well-nigh starving. Now a starving man\nseldom gets the sympathy he merits,--so few can be persuaded to believe\nin him. Worthy folks who have just fed to repletion are the most\nincredulous, some of them being even moved to smile when told of\nexisting hungry people, much as if these were occasional jests invented\nfor after-dinner amusement. Or, with that irritating vagueness of\nattention which characterizes fashionable folk to such an extent that\nwhen asking a question they neither wait for the answer nor understand\nit when given, the well-dined groups, hearing of some one starved to\ndeath, will idly murmur 'How dreadful!' and at once turn to the\ndiscussion of the latest 'fad' for killing time, ere it takes to killing\nthem with sheer _ennui_. The pronounced fact of being hungry sounds\ncoarse and common, and is not a topic for polite society, which always\neats more than sufficient for its needs. At the period I am speaking of\nhowever, I, who have since been one of the most envied of men, knew the\ncruel meaning of the word hunger, too well,--the gnawing pain, the sick\nfaintness, the deadly stupor, the insatiable animal craving for mere\nfood, all of which sensations are frightful enough to those who are,\nunhappily, daily inured to them, but which when they afflict one who has\nbeen tenderly reared and brought up to consider himself a\n'gentleman,'--God save the mark! are perhaps still more painful to bear.\nAnd I felt that I had not deserved to suffer the wretchedness in which I\nfound myself. I had worked hard. From the time my father died, leaving\nme to discover that every penny of the fortune I imagined he possessed\nwas due to swarming creditors, and that nothing of all our house and\nestate was left to me except a jewelled miniature of my mother who had\nlost her own life in giving me birth,--from that time I say, I had put\nmy shoulder to the wheel and toiled late and early. I had turned my\nUniversity education to the only use for which it or I seemed\nfitted,--literature. I had sought for employment on almost every journal\nin London,--refused by many, taken on trial by some, but getting steady\npay from none. Whoever seeks to live by brain and pen alone is, at the\nbeginning of such a career, treated as a sort of social pariah. Nobody\nwants him,--everybody despises him. His efforts are derided, his\nmanuscripts are flung back to him unread, and he is less cared for than\nthe condemned murderer in gaol. The murderer is at least fed and\nclothed,--a worthy clergyman visits him, and his gaoler will\noccasionally condescend to play cards with him. But a man gifted with\noriginal thoughts and the power of expressing them, appears to be\nregarded by everyone in authority as much worse than the worst criminal,\nand all the 'jacks-in-office' unite to kick him to death if they can. I\ntook both kicks and blows in sullen silence and lived on,--not for the\nlove of life, but simply because I scorned the cowardice of\nself-destruction. I was young enough not to part with hope too\neasily;--the vague idea I had that my turn would come,--that the\never-circling wheel of Fortune would perchance lift me up some day as it\nnow crushed me down, kept me just wearily capable of continuing\nexistence,--though it was merely a continuance and no more. For about\nsix months I got some reviewing work on a well-known literary journal.\nThirty novels a week were sent to me to 'criticise,'--I made a habit of\nglancing hastily at about eight or ten of them, and writing one column\nof rattling abuse concerning these thus casually selected,--the\nremainder were never noticed at all. I found that this mode of action\nwas considered 'smart,' and I managed for a time to please my editor who\npaid me the munificent sum of fifteen shillings for my weekly labour.\nBut on one fatal occasion I happened to change my tactics and warmly\npraised a work which my own conscience told me was both original and\nexcellent. The author of it happened to be an old enemy of the\nproprietor of the journal on which I was employed;--my eulogistic review\nof the hated individual, unfortunately for me, appeared, with the result\nthat private spite outweighed public justice, and I was immediately\ndismissed.\n\nAfter this I dragged on in a sufficiently miserable way, doing 'hack\nwork' for the dailies, and living on promises that never became\nrealities, till, as I have said, in the early January of the bitter\nwinter alluded to, I found myself literally penniless and face to face\nwith starvation, owing a month's rent besides for the poor lodging I\noccupied in a back street not far from the British Museum. I had been\nout all day trudging from one newspaper office to another, seeking for\nwork and finding none. Every available post was filled. I had also\ntried, unsuccessfully, to dispose of a manuscript of my own,--a work of\nfiction which I knew had some merit, but which all the 'readers' in the\npublishing offices appeared to find exceptionally worthless. These\n'readers' I learned, were most of them novelists themselves, who read\nother people's productions in their spare moments and passed judgment on\nthem. I have always failed to see the justice of this arrangement; to me\nit seems merely the way to foster mediocrities and suppress originality.\nCommon sense points out the fact that the novelist 'reader' who has a\nplace to maintain for himself in literature would naturally rather\nencourage work that is likely to prove ephemeral, than that which might\npossibly take a higher footing than his own. Be this as it may, and\nhowever good or bad the system, it was entirely prejudicial to me and my\nliterary offspring. The last publisher I tried was a kindly man who\nlooked at my shabby clothes and gaunt face with some commiseration.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said he, \"very sorry, but my readers are quite unanimous.\nFrom what I can learn, it seems to me you have been too earnest. And\nalso, rather sarcastic in certain strictures against society. My dear\nfellow, that won't do. Never blame society,--it buys books! Now if you\ncould write a smart love-story, slightly _risqu\u00c3\u00a9_,--even a little more\nthan _risqu\u00c3\u00a9_ for that matter; that is the sort of thing that suits the\npresent age.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" I interposed somewhat wearily--\"but are you sure you judge\nthe public taste correctly?\"\n\nHe smiled a bland smile of indulgent amusement at what he no doubt\nconsidered my ignorance in putting such a query.\n\n\"Of course I am sure,\"--he replied--\"It is my business to know the\npublic taste as thoroughly as I know my own pocket. Understand me,--I\ndon't suggest that you should write a book on any positively indecent\nsubject,--that can be safely left to the 'New' woman,\"--and he\nlaughed,--\"but I assure you high-class fiction doesn't sell. The critics\ndon't like it, to begin with. What goes down with them and with the\npublic is a bit of sensational realism told in terse newspaper English.\nLiterary English,--Addisonian English,--is a mistake.\"\n\n\"And I am also a mistake I think,\" I said with a forced smile--\"At any\nrate if what you say be true, I must lay down the pen and try another\ntrade. I am old-fashioned enough to consider Literature as the highest\nof all professions, and I would rather not join in with those who\nvoluntarily degrade it.\"\n\nHe gave me a quick side-glance of mingled incredulity and depreciation.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he finally observed--\"you are a little quixotic. That will\nwear off. Will you come on to my club and dine with me?\"\n\nI refused this invitation promptly. I knew the man saw and recognised my\nwretched plight,--and pride--false pride if you will--rose up to my\nrescue. I bade him a hurried good-day, and started back to my lodging,\ncarrying my rejected manuscript with me. Arrived there, my landlady met\nme as I was about to ascend the stairs, and asked me whether I would\n'kindly settle accounts' the next day. She spoke civilly enough, poor\nsoul, and not without a certain compassionate hesitation in her manner.\nHer evident pity for me galled my spirit as much as the publisher's\noffer of a dinner had wounded my pride,--and with a perfectly audacious\nair of certainty I at once promised her the money at the time she\nherself appointed, though I had not the least idea where or how I should\nget the required sum. Once past her, and shut in my own room, I flung my\nuseless manuscript on the floor and myself into a chair, and--swore. It\nrefreshed me to swear, and it seemed natural,--for though temporarily\nweakened by lack of food, I was not yet so weak as to shed tears,--and a\nfierce formidable oath was to me the same sort of physical relief which\nI imagine a fit of weeping may be to an excitable woman. Just as I could\nnot shed tears, so was I incapable of apostrophizing God in my despair.\nTo speak frankly, I did not believe in any God--_then_. I was to myself\nan all-sufficing mortal, scorning the time-worn superstitions of\nso-called religion. Of course I had been brought up in the Christian\nfaith; but that creed had become worse than useless to me since I had\nintellectually realized the utter inefficiency of Christian ministers to\ndeal with difficult life-problems. Spiritually I was adrift in\nchaos,--mentally I was hindered both in thought and achievement,--bodily,\nI was reduced to want. My case was desperate,--I myself was desperate.\nIt was a moment when if ever good and evil angels play a game of chance\nfor a man's soul, they were surely throwing the dice on the last wager\nfor mine. And yet, with it all, I felt I had done my best. I was driven\ninto a corner by my fellow-men who grudged me space to live in, but I\nhad fought against it. I had worked honestly and patiently;--all to no\npurpose. I knew of rogues who gained plenty of money; and of knaves who\nwere amassing large fortunes. Their prosperity appeared to prove that\nhonesty after all was _not_ the best policy. What should I do then? How\nshould I begin the jesuitical business of committing evil that good,\npersonal good, might come of it? So I thought, dully, if such stray\nhalf-stupefied fancies as I was capable of, deserved the name of thought.\n\nThe night was bitter cold. My hands were numbed, and I tried to warm\nthem at the oil-lamp my landlady was good enough to still allow me the\nuse of, in spite of delayed cash-payments. As I did so, I noticed three\nletters on the table,--one in a long blue envelope suggestive of either\na summons or a returned manuscript,--one bearing the Melbourne postmark,\nand the third a thick square missive coroneted in red and gold at the\nback. I turned over all three indifferently, and selecting the one from\nAustralia, balanced it in my hand a moment before opening it. I knew\nfrom whom it came, and idly wondered what news it brought me. Some\nmonths previously I had written a detailed account of my increasing\ndebts and difficulties to an old college chum, who finding England too\nnarrow for his ambition had gone out to the wider New world on a\nspeculative quest of gold mining. He was getting on well, so I\nunderstood, and had secured a fairly substantial position; and I had\ntherefore ventured to ask him point-blank for the loan of fifty pounds.\nHere, no doubt, was his reply, and I hesitated before breaking the seal.\n\n\"Of course it will be a refusal,\" I said half-aloud,--\"However kindly a\nfriend may otherwise be, he soon turns crusty if asked to lend money. He\nwill express many regrets, accuse trade and the general bad times and\nhope I will soon 'tide over.' I know the sort of thing. Well,--after\nall, why should I expect him to be different to other men? I've no claim\non him beyond the memory of a few sentimental arm-in-arm days at\nOxford.\"\n\nA sigh escaped me in spite of myself, and a mist blurred my sight for\nthe moment. Again I saw the grey towers of peaceful Magdalen, and the\nfair green trees shading the walks in and around the dear old University\ntown where we,--I and the man whose letter I now held in my\nhand,--strolled about together as happy youths, fancying that we were\nyoung geniuses born to regenerate the world. We were both fond of\nclassics,--we were brimful of Homer and the thoughts and maxims of all\nthe immortal Greeks and Latins,--and I verily believe, in those\nimaginative days, we thought we had in us such stuff as heroes are made\nof. But our entrance into the social arena soon robbed us of our sublime\nconceit,--we were common working units, no more,--the grind and prose of\ndaily life put Homer into the background, and we soon discovered that\nsociety was more interested in the latest unsavoury scandal than in the\ntragedies of Sophocles or the wisdom of Plato. Well! it was no doubt\nextremely foolish of us to dream that we might help to regenerate a\nworld in which both Plato and Christ appear to have failed,--yet the\nmost hardened cynic will scarcely deny that it is pleasant to look back\nto the days of his youth if he can think that at least then, if only\nonce in his life, he had noble impulses.\n\nThe lamp burned badly, and I had to re-trim it before I could settle\ndown to read my friend's letter. Next door some-one was playing a violin,\nand playing it well. Tenderly and yet with a certain amount of _brio_\nthe notes came dancing from the bow, and I listened, vaguely pleased.\nBeing faint with hunger I was somewhat in a listless state bordering on\nstupor,--and the penetrating sweetness of the music appealing to the\nsensuous and \u00c3\u00a6sthetic part of me, drowned for the moment mere animal\ncraving.\n\n\"There you go!\" I murmured, apostrophizing the unseen\nmusician,--\"practising away on that friendly fiddle of yours,--no doubt\nfor a mere pittance which barely keeps you alive. Possibly you are some\npoor wretch in a cheap orchestra,--or you might even be a street-player\nand be able to live in this neighbourhood of the _\u00c3\u00a9lite_ starving,--you\ncan have no hope whatever of being the 'fashion' and making your bow\nbefore Royalty,--or if you have that hope, it is wildly misplaced. Play\non, my friend, play on!--the sounds you make are very agreeable, and\nseem to imply that you are happy. I wonder if you are?--or if, like me,\nyou are going rapidly to the devil!\"\n\nThe music grew softer and more plaintive, and was now accompanied by the\nrattle of hailstones against the window-panes. A gusty wind whistled\nunder the door and roared down the chimney,--a wind cold as the grasp of\ndeath and searching as a probing knife. I shivered,--and bending close\nover the smoky lamp, prepared to read my Australian news. As I opened\nthe envelope, a bill for fifty pounds, payable to me at a well-known\nLondon banker's, fell out upon the table. My heart gave a quick bound of\nmingled relief and gratitude.\n\n\"Why Jack, old fellow, I wronged you!\" I exclaimed,--\"Your heart is in\nthe right place after all.\"\n\nAnd profoundly touched by my friend's ready generosity, I eagerly\nperused his letter. It was not very long, and had evidently been written\noff in haste.\n\n    Dear Geoff,\n\n    I'm sorry to hear you are down on your luck; it shows what a crop of\n    fools are still flourishing in London, when a man of your capability\n    cannot gain his proper place in the world of letters, and be\n    fittingly acknowledged. I believe it's all a question of\n    wire-pulling, and money is the only thing that will pull the wires.\n    Here's the fifty you ask for and welcome,--don't hurry about paying\n    it back. I am doing you a good turn this year by sending you a\n    friend,--a real friend, mind you!--no sham. He brings you a letter\n    of introduction from me, and between ourselves, old man, you cannot\n    do better than put yourself and your literary affairs entirely in\n    his hands. He knows everybody, and is up to all the dodges of\n    editorial management and newspaper cliques. He is a great\n    philanthropist besides,--and seems particularly fond of the society\n    of the clergy. Rather a queer taste you will say, but his reason for\n    such preference is, as he has explained to me quite frankly, that he\n    is so enormously wealthy that he does not quite know what to do with\n    his money, and the reverend gentlemen of the church are generally\n    ready to show him how to spend some of it. He is always glad to know\n    of some quarter where his money and influence (he is very\n    influential) may be useful to others. He has helped me out of a very\n    serious hobble, and I owe him a big debt of gratitude. I've told him\n    all about you,--what a smart fellow you are, and what a lot dear old\n    Alma Mater thought of you, and he has promised to give you a lift\n    up. He can do anything he likes; very naturally, seeing that the\n    whole world of morals, civilization and the rest is subservient to\n    the power of money,--and _his_ stock of cash appears to be\n    limitless. _Use him_; he is willing and ready to be used,--and write\n    and let me know how you get on. Don't bother about the fifty till\n    you feel you have tided over the storm.\n\n        Ever yours\n            Boffles.\n\nI laughed as I read the absurd signature, though my eyes were dim with\nsomething like tears. 'Boffles' was the nickname given to my friend by\nseveral of our college companions, and neither he nor I knew how it\nfirst arose. But no one except the dons ever addressed him by his proper\nname, which was John Carrington,--he was simply 'Boffles,' and Boffles\nhe remained even now for all those who had been his intimates. I\nrefolded and put by his letter and the draft for the fifty pounds, and\nwith a passing vague wonder as to what manner of man the\n'philanthropist' might be who had more money than he knew what to do\nwith, I turned to the consideration of my other two correspondents,\nrelieved to feel that now, whatever happened, I could settle up arrears\nwith my landlady the next day as I had promised. Moreover I could order\nsome supper, and have a fire lit to cheer my chilly room. Before\nattending to these creature comforts however, I opened the long blue\nenvelope that looked so like a threat of legal proceedings, and\nunfolding the paper within, stared at it amazedly. What was it all\nabout? The written characters danced before my eyes,--puzzled and\nbewildered, I found myself reading the thing over and over again without\nany clear comprehension of it. Presently a glimmer of meaning flashed\nupon me, startling my senses like an electric shock, ...\nno--no--!--impossible! Fortune never could be so mad as this!--never so\nwildly capricious and grotesque of humour! It was some senseless hoax\nthat was being practised upon me, ... and yet, ... if it were a joke, it\nwas a very elaborate and remarkable one! Weighted with the majesty of\nthe law too! ... Upon my word and by all the fantastical freakish\ndestinies that govern human affairs, the news seemed actually positive\nand genuine!\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSteadying my thoughts with an effort, I read every word of the document\nover again deliberately, and the stupefaction of my wonder increased.\nWas I going mad, or sickening for a fever? Or could this startling, this\nstupendous piece of information be really true? Because,--if indeed it\nwere true, ... good heavens!--I turned giddy to think of it,--and it was\nonly by sheer force of will that I kept myself from swooning with the\nagitation of such sudden surprise and ecstasy. If it were true--why then\nthe world was mine!--I was king instead of beggar;--I was everything I\nchose to be! The letter,--the amazing letter, bore the printed name of a\nnoted firm of London solicitors, and stated in measured and precise\nterms that a distant relative of my father's, of whom I had scarcely\nheard, except remotely now and then during my boyhood, had died suddenly\nin South America, leaving me his sole heir.\n\n\"_The real and personal estate now amounting to something over Five\nMillions of Pounds Sterling, we should esteem it a favour if you could\nmake it convenient to call upon us any day this week in order that we\nmay go through the necessary formalities together. The larger bulk of\nthe cash is lodged in the Bank of England, and a considerable amount is\nplaced in French government securities. We should prefer going into\nfurther details with you personally rather than by letter. Trusting you\nwill call on us without delay, we are, Sir, yours obediently...._\"\n\nFive Millions! I, the starving literary hack,--the friendless, hopeless,\nalmost reckless haunter of low newspaper dens,--I, the possessor of\n\"over Five Millions of Pounds Sterling\"! I tried to grasp the astounding\nfact,--for fact it evidently was,--but could not. It seemed to me a wild\ndelusion, born of the dizzy vagueness which lack of food engendered in\nmy brain. I stared round the room;--the mean miserable furniture,--the\nfireless grate,--the dirty lamp,--the low truckle bedstead,--the\nevidences of penury and want on every side;--and then,--then the\noverwhelming contrast between the poverty that environed me and the news\nI had just received, struck me as the wildest, most ridiculous\nincongruity I had ever heard of or imagined,--and I gave vent to a shout\nof laughter.\n\n\"Was there ever such a caprice of mad Fortune!\" I cried aloud--\"Who\nwould have imagined it! Good God! I! I, of all men in the world to be\nsuddenly chosen out for this luck! By Heaven!--If it is all true, I'll\nmake society spin round like a top on my hand before I am many months\nolder!\"\n\nAnd I laughed loudly again; laughed just as I had previously sworn,\nsimply by way of relief to my feelings. Some one laughed in answer,--a\nlaugh that seemed to echo mine. I checked myself abruptly, somewhat\nstartled, and listened. Rain poured outside, and the wind shrieked like\na petulant shrew,--the violinist next door was practising a brilliant\nroulade up and down his instrument,--but there were no other sounds than\nthese. Yet I could have sworn I heard a man's deep-chested laughter\nclose behind me where I stood.\n\n\"It must have been my fancy;\" I murmured, turning the flame of the lamp\nup higher in order to obtain more light in the room--\"I am nervous I\nsuppose,--no wonder! Poor Boffles!--good old chap!\" I continued,\nremembering my friend's draft for fifty pounds, which had seemed such a\ngodsend a few minutes since--\"What a surprise is in store for you! You\nshall have your loan back as promptly as you sent it, with an extra\nfifty added by way of interest for your generosity. And as for the new\nM\u00c3\u00a6cenas you are sending to help me over my difficulties,--well, he may\nbe a very excellent old gentleman, but he will find himself quite out of\nhis element this time. I want neither assistance nor advice nor\npatronage,--I can buy them all! Titles, honours, possessions,--they are\nall purchaseable,--love, friendship, position,--they are all for sale in\nthis admirably commercial age and go to the highest bidder! By my\nsoul!--The wealthy 'philanthropist' will find it difficult to match me\nin power! He will scarcely have more than five millions to waste, I\nwarrant! And now for supper,--I shall have to live on credit till I get\nsome ready cash,--and there is no reason why I should not leave this\nwretched hole at once, and go to one of the best hotels and swagger it!\"\n\nI was about to leave the room on the swift impulse of excitement and\njoy, when a fresh and violent gust of wind roared down the chimney,\nbringing with it a shower of soot which fell in a black heap on my\nrejected manuscript where it lay forgotten on the floor, as I had\ndespairingly thrown it. I hastily picked it up and shook it free from\nthe noisome dirt, wondering as I did so, what would be its fate\nnow?--now, when I could afford to publish it myself, and not only\npublish it but advertise it, and not only advertise it, but 'push' it,\nin all the crafty and cautious ways known to the inner circles of\n'booming'! I smiled as I thought of the vengeance I would take on all\nthose who had scorned and slighted me and my labour,--how they should\ncower before me!--how they should fawn at my feet like whipt curs, and\nwhine their fulsome adulation! Every stiff and stubborn neck should bend\nbefore me;--this I resolved upon; for though money does not always\nconquer everything, it only fails when it is money apart from brains.\nBrains and money together can move the world,--brains can very\nfrequently do this alone without money, of which serious and proved fact\nthose who have no brains should beware!\n\nFull of ambitious thought, I now and then caught wild sounds from the\nviolin that was being played next door,--notes like sobbing cries of\npain, and anon rippling runs like a careless woman's laughter,--and all\nat once I remembered I had not yet opened the third letter addressed to\nme,--the one coroneted in scarlet and gold, which had remained where it\nwas on the table almost unnoticed till now. I took it up and turned it\nover with an odd sense of reluctance in my fingers, which were slow at\nthe work of tearing the thick envelope asunder. Drawing out an equally\nthick small sheet of notepaper also coroneted, I read the following\nlines written in an admirably legible, small and picturesque hand.\n\n    Dear Sir.\n\n    I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to you from your former\n    college companion Mr John Carrington, now of Melbourne, who has been\n    good enough to thus give me the means of making the acquaintance of\n    one, who, I understand, is more than exceptionally endowed with the\n    gift of literary genius. I shall call upon you this evening between\n    eight and nine o'clock, trusting to find you at home and disengaged.\n    I enclose my card, and present address, and beg to remain,\n\n        Very faithfully yours\n            Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez.\n\nThe card mentioned dropped on the table as I finished reading the note.\nIt bore a small, exquisitely engraved coronet and the words\n\n              PRINCE LUCIO RIM\u00c3\u0082NEZ.\n\nwhile, scribbled lightly in pencil underneath was the address 'Grand\nHotel.'\n\nI read the brief letter through again,--it was simple enough,--expressed\nwith clearness and civility. There was nothing remarkable about\nit,--nothing whatever; yet it seemed to me surcharged with meaning.\nWhy, I could not imagine. A curious fascination kept my eyes fastened on\nthe characteristic bold handwriting, and made me fancy I should like the\nman who penned it. How the wind roared!--and how that violin next door\nwailed like the restless spirit of some forgotten musician in torment!\nMy brain swam and my heart ached heavily,--the drip drip of the rain\noutside sounded like the stealthy footfall of some secret spy upon my\nmovements. I grew irritable and nervous,--a foreboding of evil somehow\ndarkened the bright consciousness of my sudden good fortune. Then an\nimpulse of shame possessed me,--shame that this foreign prince, if such\nhe were, with limitless wealth at his back, should be coming to visit\nme,--_me_, now a millionaire,--in my present wretched lodging. Already,\nbefore I had touched my riches, I was tainted by the miserable vulgarity\nof seeking to pretend I had never been really poor, but only embarrassed\nby a little temporary difficulty! If I had had a sixpence about me,\n(which I had not) I should have sent a telegram to my approaching\nvisitor to put him off.\n\n\"But in any case,\" I said aloud, addressing myself to the empty room and\nthe storm-echoes--\"I will not meet him to-night. I'll go out and leave\nno message,--and if he comes he will think I have not yet had his\nletter. I can make an appointment to see him when I am better lodged,\nand dressed more in keeping with my present position,--in the meantime,\nnothing is easier than to keep out of this would-be benefactor's way.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the flickering lamp gave a dismal crackle and went out,\nleaving me in pitch darkness. With an exclamation more strong than\nreverent, I groped about the room for matches, or failing them, for my\nhat and coat,--and I was still engaged in a fruitless and annoying\nsearch, when I caught a sound of galloping horses' hoofs coming to an\nabrupt stop in the street below. Surrounded by black gloom, I paused and\nlistened. There was a slight commotion in the basement,--I heard my\nlandlady's accents attuned to nervous civility, mingling with the\nmellow tones of a deep masculine voice,--then steps, firm and even,\nascended the stairs to my landing.\n\n\"The devil is in it!\" I muttered vexedly--\"Just like my wayward\nluck!--here comes the very man I meant to avoid!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe door opened,--and from the dense obscurity enshrouding me I could\njust perceive a tall shadowy figure standing on the threshold. I\nremember well the curious impression the mere outline of this scarcely\ndiscerned Form made upon me even then,--suggesting at the first glance\nsuch a stately majesty of height and bearing as at once riveted my\nattention,--so much so indeed that I scarcely heard my landlady's\nintroductory words \"A gentleman to see you sir,\"--words that were\nquickly interrupted by a murmur of dismay at finding the room in total\ndarkness. \"Well to be sure! The lamp must have gone out!\" she\nexclaimed,--then addressing the personage she had ushered thus far, she\nadded--\"I'm afraid Mr Tempest isn't in after all, sir, though I\ncertainly saw him about half-an-hour ago. If you don't mind waiting here\na minute I'll fetch a light and see if he has left any message on his\ntable.\"\n\nShe hurried away, and though I knew that of course I ought to speak, a\nsingular and quite inexplicable perversity of humour kept me silent and\nunwilling to declare my presence. Meanwhile the tall stranger advanced a\npace or two, and a rich voice with a ring of ironical amusement in it\ncalled me by my name--\n\n\"Geoffrey Tempest, are you there?\"\n\nWhy could I not answer? The strangest and most unnatural obstinacy\nstiffened my tongue,--and, concealed in the gloom of my forlorn literary\nden I still held my peace. The majestic figure drew nearer, till in\nheight and breadth it seemed to suddenly overshadow me; and once again\nthe voice called--\n\n\"Geoffrey Tempest, are you there?\"\n\nFor very shame's sake I could hold out no longer,--and with a determined\neffort I broke the extraordinary dumb spell that had held me like a\ncoward in silent hiding, and came forward boldly to confront my visitor.\n\n\"Yes I _am_ here,\" I said--\"And being here I am ashamed to give you such\na welcome as this. You are Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez of course;--I have just read\nyour note which prepared me for your visit, but I was hoping that my\nlandlady, finding the room in darkness, would conclude I was out, and\nshow you downstairs again. You see I am perfectly frank!\"\n\n\"You are indeed!\" returned the stranger, his deep tones still vibrating\nwith the silvery clang of veiled satire--\"So frank that I cannot fail to\nunderstand you. Briefly, and without courtesy, you resent my visit this\nevening and wish I had not come!\"\n\nThis open declaration of my mood sounded so brusque that I made haste to\ndeny it, though I knew it to be true. Truth, even in trifles, always\nseems unpleasant!\n\n\"Pray do not think me so churlish,\"--I said--\"The fact is, I only opened\nyour letter a few minutes ago, and before I could make any arrangements\nto receive you, the lamp went out, with the awkward result that I am\nforced to greet you in this unsociable darkness, which is almost too\ndense to shake hands in.\"\n\n\"Shall we try?\" my visitor enquired, with a sudden softening of accent\nthat gave his words a singular charm; \"Here is my hand,--if yours has\nany friendly instinct in it the twain will meet,--quite blindly and\nwithout guidance!\"\n\nI at once extended my hand, and it was instantly clasped in a warm and\nsomewhat masterful manner. At that moment a light flashed on the\nscene,--my landlady entered, bearing what she called 'her best lamp'\nalit, and set it on the table. I believe she uttered some exclamation of\nsurprise at seeing me,--she may have said anything or nothing,--I did\nnot hear or heed, so entirely was I amazed and fascinated by the\nappearance of the man whose long slender hand still held mine. I am\nmyself an average good height, but he was fully half a head taller than\nI, if not more than that,--and as I looked straightly at him, I thought\nI had never seen so much beauty and intellectuality combined in the\noutward personality of any human being. The finely shaped head denoted\nboth power and wisdom, and was nobly poised on such shoulders as might\nhave befitted a Hercules,--the countenance was a pure oval, and\nsingularly pale, this complexion intensifying the almost fiery\nbrilliancy of the full dark eyes, which had in them a curious and\nwonderfully attractive look of mingled mirth and misery. The mouth was\nperhaps the most telling feature in this remarkable face,--set in the\nperfect curve of beauty, it was yet firm, determined, and not too small,\nthus escaping effeminacy,--and I noted that in repose it expressed\nbitterness, disdain and even cruelty. But with the light of a smile upon\nit, it signified, or seemed to signify, something more subtle than any\npassion to which we can give a name, and already with the rapidity of a\nlightning flash, I caught myself wondering what that mystic undeclared\nsomething might be. At a glance I comprehended these primary details of\nmy new acquaintance's eminently prepossessing appearance, and when my\nhand dropped from his close grasp I felt as if I had known him all my\nlife! And now face to face with him in the bright lamp-light, I\nremembered my actual surroundings,--the bare cold room, the lack of\nfire, the black soot that sprinkled the nearly carpetless floor,--my own\nshabby clothes and deplorable aspect, as compared with this\nregal-looking individual, who carried the visible evidence of wealth\nupon him in the superb Russian sables that lined and bordered his long\novercoat which he now partially unfastened and threw open with a\ncarelessly imperial air, the while he regarded me, smiling.\n\n\"I know I have come at an awkward moment,\" he said--\"I always do! It is\nmy peculiar misfortune. Well-bred people never intrude where they are\nnot wanted,--and in this particular I'm afraid my manners leave much to\nbe desired. Try to forgive me if you can, for the sake of this,\"--and he\nheld out a letter addressed to me in my friend Carrington's familiar\nhandwriting. \"And permit me to sit down while you read my credentials.\"\n\nHe took a chair and seated himself. I observed his handsome face and\neasy attitude with renewed admiration.\n\n\"No credentials are necessary,\" I said with all the cordiality I now\nreally felt--\"I have already had a letter from Carrington in which he\nspeaks of you in the highest and most grateful terms. But the fact\nis----well!--really, prince, you must excuse me if I seem confused or\nastonished ... I had expected to see quite an old man ...\"\n\nAnd I broke off, somewhat embarrassed by the keen glance of the\nbrilliant eyes that met mine so fixedly.\n\n\"No one is old, my dear sir, nowadays!\" he declared lightly--\"even the\ngrandmothers and grandfathers are friskier at fifty than they were at\nfifteen. One does not talk of age at all now in polite society,--it is\nill-bred, even coarse. Indecent things are unmentionable--age has become\nan indecent thing. It is therefore avoided in conversation. You expected\nto see an old man you say? Well, you are not disappointed--I _am_ old.\nIn fact you have no idea how very old I am!\"\n\nI laughed at this piece of absurdity.\n\n\"Why, you are younger than I,\"--I said--\"or if not, you look it.\"\n\n\"Ah, my looks belie me!\" he returned gaily--\"I am like several of the\nmost noted fashionable beauties,--much riper than I seem. But come, read\nthe introductory missive I have brought you,--I shall not be satisfied\ntill you do.\"\n\nThus requested, and wishing to prove myself as courteous as I had\nhitherto been brusque, I at once opened my friend's note and read as\nfollows,--\n\n    Dear Geoffrey.\n\n    The bearer of this, Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, is a very distinguished scholar\n    and gentleman, allied by descent to one of the oldest families in\n    Europe, or for that matter, in the world. You, as a student and\n    lover of ancient history, will be interested to know that his\n    ancestors were originally princes of Chaldea, who afterwards settled\n    in Tyre,--from thence they went to Etruria and there continued\n    through many centuries, the last scion of the house being the very\n    gifted and genial personage who, as my good friend, I have the\n    pleasure of commending to your kindest regard. Certain troublous and\n    overpowering circumstances have forced him into exile from his\n    native province, and deprived him of a great part of his\n    possessions, so that he is, to a considerable extent a wanderer on\n    the face of the earth, and has travelled far and seen much, and has\n    a wide experience of men and things. He is a poet and musician of\n    great skill, and though he occupies himself with the arts solely for\n    his own amusement, I think you will find his practical knowledge of\n    literary matters eminently useful to you in your difficult career. I\n    must not forget to add that in all matters scientific he is an\n    absolute master. Wishing you both a cordial friendship, I am, dear\n    Geoffrey,\n\n        Yours sincerely\n            John Carrington.\n\nThe signature of 'Boffles' had evidently been deemed out of place this\ntime and somehow I was foolishly vexed at its omission. There seemed to\nbe something formal and stiff in the letter, almost as if it had been\nwritten to dictation, and under pressure. What gave me this idea I know\nnot. I glanced furtively at my silent companion,--he caught my stray\nlook and returned it with a curiously grave fixity. Fearing lest my\nmomentary vague distrust of him had been reflected in my eyes I made\nhaste to speak--\n\n\"This letter, prince, adds to my shame and regret that I should have\ngreeted you in so churlish a manner this evening. No apology can\ncondone my rudeness,--but you cannot imagine how mortified I felt and\nstill feel, to be compelled to receive you in this miserable den,--it is\nnot at all the sort of place in which I should have liked to welcome\nyou....\" And I broke off with a renewed sense of irritation, remembering\nhow actually rich I now was, and that in spite of this, I was obliged to\nseem poor. Meanwhile the prince waived aside my remarks with a light\ngesture of his hand.\n\n\"Why be mortified?\" he demanded. \"Rather be proud that you can dispense\nwith the vulgar appurtenances of luxury. Genius thrives in a garret and\ndies in a palace,--is not that the generally accepted theory?\"\n\n\"Rather a worn-out and mistaken one I consider,\"--I replied; \"Genius\nmight like to try the effect of a palace for once,--it usually dies of\nstarvation.\"\n\n\"True!--but in thus dying, think how many fools it afterwards fattens!\nThere is an all-wise Providence in this, my dear sir! Schubert perished\nof want,--but see what large profits all the music-publishers have made\nsince out of his compositions! It is a most beautiful dispensation of\nnature,--that honest folk should be sacrificed in order to provide for\nthe sustenance of knaves!\"\n\nHe laughed, and I looked at him in a little surprise. His remark touched\nso near my own opinions that I wondered whether he were in jest or\nearnest.\n\n\"You speak sarcastically of course?\" I said--\"You do not really believe\nwhat you say?\"\n\n\"Oh, do I not!\" he returned, with a flash of his fine eyes that was\nalmost lightning-like in its intensity--\"If I could not believe the\nteaching of my own experience, what would be left to me? I always\nrealize the '_needs must_' of things--how does the old maxim go--'needs\nmust when the devil drives.' There is really no possible contradiction\nto offer to the accuracy of that statement. The devil drives the world,\nwhip in hand,--and oddly enough, (considering that some belated folk\nstill fancy there is a God somewhere) succeeds in managing his team\nwith extraordinary ease!\" His brow clouded and the bitter lines about\nhis mouth deepened and hardened,--anon he laughed again lightly and\ncontinued--\"But let us not moralize,--morals sicken the soul both in\nchurch and out of it,--every sensible man hates to be told what he\n_could_ be and what he _won't_ be. I am here to make friends with you if\nyou permit,--and to put an end to ceremony, will you accompany me back\nto my hotel where I have ordered supper?\"\n\nBy this time I had become indescribably fascinated by his easy manner,\nhandsome presence and mellifluous voice,--the satirical turn of his\nhumour suited mine,--I felt we should get on well together,--and my\nfirst annoyance at being discovered by him in such poverty-stricken\ncircumstances somewhat abated.\n\n\"With pleasure!\" I replied--\"But first of all, you must allow me to\nexplain matters a little. You have heard a good deal about my affairs\nfrom my friend John Carrington, and I know from his private letter to me\nthat you have come here out of pure kindness and goodwill. For that\ngenerous intention I thank you! I know you expected to find a poor\nwretch of a literary man struggling with the direst circumstances of\ndisappointment and poverty,--and a couple of hours ago you would have\namply fulfilled that expectation. But now, things have changed,--I have\nreceived news which completely alters my position,--in fact I have had a\nvery great and remarkable surprise this evening....\"\n\n\"An agreeable one I trust?\" interposed my companion suavely.\n\nI smiled.\n\n\"Judge for yourself!\" And I handed him the lawyer's letter which\ninformed me of my suddenly acquired fortune.\n\nHe glanced it through rapidly,--then folded and returned it to me with a\ncourteous bow.\n\n\"I suppose I should congratulate you,\"--he said--\"And I do. Though of\ncourse this wealth which seems to content you, to me appears a mere\ntrifle. It can be quite conveniently run through and exhausted in about\neight years or less, therefore it does not provide absolute immunity\nfrom care. To be rich, really rich, in my sense of the word, one should\nhave about a million a year. Then one might reasonably hope to escape\nthe workhouse!\"\n\nHe laughed,--and I stared at him stupidly, not knowing how to take his\nwords, whether as truth or idle boasting. Five millions of money a mere\ntrifle! He went on without apparently noticing my amazement--\n\n\"The inexhaustible greed of a man, my dear sir, can never be satisfied.\nIf he is not consumed by desire for one thing, he is for another, and\nhis tastes are generally expensive. A few pretty and unscrupulous women\nfor example, would soon relieve you of your five millions in the\npurchase of jewels alone. Horse-racing would do it still more quickly.\nNo, no,--you are not rich,--you are still poor,--only your needs are no\nlonger so pressing as they were. And in this I confess myself somewhat\ndisappointed,--for I came to you hoping to do a good turn to some one\nfor once in my life, and to play the foster-father to a rising\ngenius--and here I am--forestalled,--as usual! It is a singular thing,\ndo you know, but nevertheless a fact, that whenever I have had any\nparticular intentions towards a man I am always forestalled! It is\nreally rather hard upon me!\" He broke off and raised his head in a\nlistening attitude.\n\n\"What is that?\" he asked.\n\nIt was the violinist next door playing a well-known \"Ave Maria.\" I told\nhim so.\n\n\"Dismal,--very dismal!\" he said with a contemptuous shrug. \"I hate all\nthat kind of mawkish devotional stuff. Well!--millionaire as you are,\nand acknowledged lion of society as you shortly will be, there is no\nobjection I hope, to the proposed supper? And perhaps a music-hall\nafterwards if you feel inclined,--what do you say?\"\n\nHe clapped me on the shoulder cordially and looked straight into my\nface,--those wonderful eyes of his, suggestive of both tears and fire,\nfixed me with a clear masterful gaze that completely dominated me. I\nmade no attempt to resist the singular attraction which now possessed me\nfor this man whom I had but just met,--the sensation was too strong and\ntoo pleasant to be combated. Only for one moment more I hesitated,\nlooking down at my shabby attire.\n\n\"I am not fit to accompany you, prince,\" I said--\"I look more like a\ntramp than a millionaire.\"\n\nHe glanced at me and smiled.\n\n\"Upon my life, so you do!\" he averred.--\"But be satisfied!--you are in\nthis respect very like many another Croesus. It is only the poor and\nproud who take the trouble to dress well,--they and the dear 'naughty'\nladies, generally monopolize tasteful and becoming attire. An\nill-fitting coat often adorns the back of a Prime Minister,--and if you\nsee a woman clad in clothes vilely cut and coloured, you may be sure she\nis eminently virtuous, renowned for good works, and probably a duchess!\"\nHe rose, drawing his sables about him.\n\n\"What matter the coat if the purse be full!\" he continued gaily.--\"Let\nit once be properly paragraphed in the papers that you are a\nmillionaire, and doubtless some enterprising tailor will invent a\n'Tempest' ulster coloured softly like your present garb, an artistic\nmildewy green! And now come along,--your solicitor's communication\nshould have given you a good appetite, or it is not so valuable as it\nseems,--and I want you to do justice to my supper. I have my own _chef_\nwith me, and he is not without skill. I hope, by the way, you will at\nleast do me this much service,--that pending legal discussion and\nsettlement of your affairs, you will let me be your banker?\"\n\nThis offer was made with such an air of courteous delicacy and\nfriendship, that I could do no more than accept it gratefully, as it\nrelieved me from all temporary embarrassment. I hastily wrote a few\nlines to my landlady, telling her she would receive the money owing to\nher by post next day,--then, thrusting my rejected manuscript, my only\nworldly possession, into my coat-pocket, I extinguished the lamp, and\nwith the new friend I had so suddenly gained, I left my dismal lodgings\nand all its miserable associations for ever. I little thought the time\nwould come when I should look back to the time spent in that small mean\nroom as the best period of my life,--when I should regard the bitter\npoverty I then endured, as the stern but holy angel meant to guide me to\nthe highest and noblest attainment,--when I should pray desperately with\nwild tears to be as I was then, rather than as I am now! Is it well or\nill for us I wonder, that the future is hidden from our knowledge?\nShould we steer our ways clearer from evil if we knew its result? It is\na doubtful question,--at anyrate my ignorance for the moment was indeed\nbliss. I went joyfully out of the dreary house where I had lived so long\namong disappointments and difficulties, turning my back upon it with\nsuch a sense of relief as could never be expressed in words,--and the\nlast thing I heard as I passed into the street with my companion, was a\nplaintive long-drawn wail of minor melody, which seemed to be sent after\nme like a parting cry, by the unknown and invisible player of the\nviolin.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nOutside, the prince's carriage waited, drawn by two spirited black\nhorses caparisoned in silver; magnificent thoroughbreds, which pawed the\nground and champed their bits impatient of delay,--at sight of his\nmaster the smart footman in attendance threw the door open, touching his\nhat respectfully. We stepped in, I preceding my companion at his\nexpressed desire; and as I sank back among the easy cushions, I felt the\ncomplacent consciousness of luxury and power to such an extent that it\nseemed as if I had left my days of adversity already a long way behind\nme. Hunger and happiness disputed my sensations between them, and I was\nin that vague light-headed condition common to long fasting, in which\nnothing seems absolutely tangible or real. I knew I should not properly\ngrasp the solid truth of my wonderful good luck till my physical needs\nwere satisfied and I was, so to speak, once more in a naturally balanced\nbodily condition. At present my brain was in a whirl,--my thoughts were\nall dim and disconnected,--and I appeared to myself to be in some\nwhimsical dream from which I should wake up directly. The carriage\nrolled on rubber-tyred wheels and made no noise as it went,--one could\nonly hear the even rapid trot of the horses. By-and-by I saw in the\nsemi-darkness my new friend's brilliant dark eyes fixed upon me with a\ncuriously intent expression.\n\n\"Do you not feel the world already at your feet?\" he queried half\nplayfully, half ironically--\"Like a football, waiting to be kicked? It\nis such an absurd world, you know--so easily moved. Wise men in all ages\nhave done their best to make it less ridiculous,--with no result,\ninasmuch as it continues to prefer folly to wisdom. A football, or let\nus say a shuttlecock among worlds, ready to be tossed up anyhow and\nanywhere, provided the battledore be of gold!\"\n\n\"You speak a trifle bitterly, prince\"--I said--\"But no doubt you have\nhad a wide experience among men?\"\n\n\"I have,\" he returned with emphasis--\"My kingdom is a vast one.\"\n\n\"You are a ruling power then?\" I exclaimed with some\nastonishment--\"Yours is not a title of honour only?\"\n\n\"Oh, as your rules of aristocracy go, it _is_ a mere title of\nhonour\"--he replied quickly--\"When I say that my kingdom is a vast one,\nI mean that I rule wherever men obey the influence of wealth. From this\npoint of view, am I wrong in calling my kingdom vast?--is it not almost\nboundless?\"\n\n\"I perceive you are a cynic,\"--I said--\"Yet surely you believe that\nthere are some things wealth cannot buy,--honour and virtue for\nexample?\"\n\nHe surveyed me with a whimsical smile.\n\n\"I suppose honour and virtue _do_ exist--\" he answered--\"And when they\nare existent of course they cannot be bought. But my experience has\ntaught me that I can always buy everything. The sentiments called honour\nand virtue by the majority of men are the most shifty things\nimaginable,--set sufficient cash down, and they become bribery and\ncorruption in the twinkling of an eye! Curious--very curious. I confess\nI found a case of unpurchaseable integrity once, but only once. I may\nfind it again, though I consider the chance a very doubtful one. Now to\nrevert to myself, pray do not imagine I am playing the humbug with you\nor passing myself off under a _bogus_ title. I am a _bona-fide_ prince,\nbelieve me, and of such descent as none of your oldest families can\nboast,--but my dominions are long since broken up and my former subjects\ndispersed among all nations,--anarchy, nihilism, disruption and\npolitical troubles generally, compel me to be rather reticent concerning\nmy affairs. Money I fortunately have in plenty,--and with that I pave my\nway. Some day when we are better acquainted, you shall know more of my\nprivate history. I have various other names and titles besides that on\nmy card--but I keep to the simplest of them, because most people are\nsuch bunglers at the pronunciation of foreign names. My intimate friends\ngenerally drop my title, and call me Lucio simply.\"\n\n\"That is your christian name--?\" I began.\n\n\"Not at all--I have no 'christian' name,\"--he interrupted swiftly and\nwith anger--\"There is no such thing as 'christian' in my composition!\"\n\nHe spoke with such impatience that for a moment I was at a loss for a\nreply. At last--\n\n\"Indeed!\" I murmured vaguely.\n\nHe burst out laughing.\n\n\"'Indeed!' That is all you can find to say! Indeed and again indeed the\nword 'christian' vexes me. There is no such creature alive. _You_ are\nnot a Christian,--no one is really,--people pretend to be,--and in so\ndamnable an act of feigning are more blasphemous than any fallen fiend!\nNow I make no pretences of the kind,--I have only one faith--\"\n\n\"And that is?\"--\n\n\"A profound and awful one!\" he said in thrilling tones--\"And the worst\nof it is that it is true,--as true as the workings of the Universe. But\nof that hereafter,--it will do to talk of when we feel low-spirited and\nwish to converse of things grim and ghastly,--at present here we are at\nour destination, and the chief consideration of our lives, (it is the\nchief consideration of most men's lives) must be the excellence or\nnon-excellence of our food.\"\n\nThe carriage stopped and we descended. At first sight of the black\nhorses and silver trappings, the porter of the hotel and two or three\nother servants rushed out to attend upon us; but the prince passed into\nthe hall without noticing any of them and addressed himself to a\nsober-looking individual in black, his own private valet, who came\nforward to meet him with a profound salutation. I murmured something\nabout wishing to engage a room for myself in the hotel.\n\n\"Oh, my man will see to that for you\"--he said lightly--\"The house is\nnot full,--at anyrate all the best rooms are not taken; and of course\nyou want one of the best.\"\n\nA staring waiter, who up to that moment, had been noting my shabby\nclothes with that peculiar air of contempt commonly displayed by\ninsolent menials to those whom they imagine are poor, overheard these\nwords, and suddenly changing the derisive expression of his foxy face,\nbowed obsequiously as I passed. A thrill of disgust ran through me,\nmingled with a certain angry triumph,--the hypocritical reflex of this\nlow fellow's countenance, was, I knew, a true epitome of what I should\nfind similarly reflected in the manner and attitude of all 'polite'\nsociety. For there the estimate of worth is no higher than a common\nservant's estimate, and is taken solely from the money standard;--if you\nare poor and dress shabbily you are thrust aside and ignored,--but if\nyou are rich, you may wear shabby clothes as much as you like, you are\nstill courted and flattered, and invited everywhere, though you may be\nthe greatest fool alive or the worst blackguard unhung. With vague\nthoughts such as these flitting over my mind, I followed my host to his\nrooms. He occupied nearly a whole wing of the hotel, having a large\ndrawing-room, dining-room and study _en suite_, fitted up in the most\nluxurious manner, besides bedroom, bathroom, and dressing-room, with\nother rooms adjoining, for his valet and two extra personal attendants.\nThe table was laid for supper, and glittered with the costliest glass,\nsilver and china, being furthermore adorned by baskets of the most\nexquisite fruit and flowers, and in a few moments we were seated. The\nprince's valet acted as head-waiter, and I noticed that now this man's\nface, seen in the full light of the electric lamps, seemed very dark\nand unpleasant, even sinister in expression,--but in the performance of\nhis duties he was unexceptionable, being quick, attentive, and\ndeferential, so much so that I inwardly reproached myself for taking an\ninstinctive dislike to him. His name was Amiel, and I found myself\ninvoluntarily watching his movements, they were so noiseless,--his very\nstep suggesting the stealthy gliding of a cat or a tiger. He was\nassisted in his work by the two other attendants who served as his\nsubordinates, and who were equally active and well-trained,--and\npresently I found myself enjoying the choicest meal I had tasted for\nmany and many a long day, flavoured with such wine as connoisseurs might\nbe apt to dream of, but never succeed in finding. I began to feel\nperfectly at my ease, and talked with freedom and confidence, the strong\nattraction I had for my new friend deepening with every moment I passed\nin his company.\n\n\"Will you continue your literary career now you have this little fortune\nleft you?\" he inquired, when at the close of supper Amiel set the\nchoicest cognac and cigars before us, and respectfully withdrew--\"Do you\nthink you will care to go on with it?\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall\"--I replied--\"if only for the fun of the thing. You\nsee, with money I can force my name into notice whether the public like\nit or not. No newspaper refuses paying advertisements.\"\n\n\"True!--but may not inspiration refuse to flow from a full purse and an\nempty head?\"\n\nThis remark provoked me not a little.\n\n\"Do you consider me empty-headed?\" I asked with some vexation.\n\n\"Not at present. My dear Tempest, do not let either the Tokay we have\nbeen drinking, or the cognac we are going to drink, speak for you in\nsuch haste! I assure you I do not think you empty-headed,--on the\ncontrary, your head, I believe from what I have heard, has been and is\nfull of ideas,--excellent ideas, original ideas, which the world of\nconventional criticism does not want. But whether these ideas will\ncontinue to germinate in your brain, or whether, with the full purse,\nthey will cease, is now the question. Great originality and inspiration,\nstrange to say, seldom endow the millionaire. Inspiration is supposed to\ncome from above,--money from below! In your case however both\noriginality and inspiration may continue to flourish and bring forth\nfruit,--I trust they may. It often happens, nevertheless that when bags\nof money fall to the lot of aspiring genius, God departs and the devil\nwalks in. Have you never heard that?\"\n\n\"Never!\" I answered smiling.\n\n\"Well, of course the saying is foolish, and sounds doubly ridiculous in\nthis age when people believe in neither God nor devil. It implies\nhowever that one must choose an up or a down,--genius is the Up, money\nis the Down. You cannot fly and grovel at the same instant.\"\n\n\"The possession of money is not likely to cause a man to grovel\"--I\nsaid--\"It is the one thing necessary to strengthen his soaring powers\nand lift him to the greatest heights.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" and my host lit his cigar with a grave and pre-occupied\nair--\"Then I'm afraid, you don't know much about what I shall call\nnatural psychics. What belongs to the earth tends earthwards,--surely\nyou realize that? Gold most strictly belongs to the earth,--you dig it\nout of the ground,--you handle it and dispose of it in solid wedges or\nbars--it is a substantial metal enough. Genius belongs to nobody knows\nwhere,--you cannot dig it up or pass it on, or do anything with it\nexcept stand and marvel--it is a rare visitant and capricious as the\nwind, and generally makes sad havoc among the conventionalities of men.\nIt is as I said an 'upper' thing, beyond earthly smells and\nsavours,--and those who have it always live in unknown high latitudes.\nBut money is a perfectly level commodity,--level with the ground;--when\nyou have much of it, you come down solidly on your flat soles and down\nyou stay!\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Upon my word you preach very eloquently against wealth!\" I said--\"You\nyourself are unusually rich,--are you sorry for it?\"\n\n\"No, I am not sorry, because being sorry would be no use\"--he\nreturned--\"And I never waste my time. But I am telling you the\ntruth--Genius and great riches hardly ever pull together. Now I, for\nexample,--you cannot imagine what great capabilities I had once!--a long\ntime ago--before I became my own master!\"\n\n\"And you have them still I am sure\"--I averred, looking expressively at\nhis noble head and fine eyes.\n\nThe strange subtle smile I had noticed once or twice before lightened\nhis face. \"Ah, you mean to compliment me!\" he said--\"You like my\nlooks,--many people do. Yet after all there is nothing so deceptive as\none's outward appearance. The reason of this is that as soon as\nchildhood is past, we are always pretending to be what we are not,--and\nthus, with constant practice from our youth up, we manage to make our\nphysical frames complete disguises for our actual selves. It is really\nwise and clever of us,--for hence each individual is so much flesh-wall\nthrough which neither friend nor enemy can spy. Every man is a solitary\nsoul imprisoned in a self-made den,--when he is quite alone he knows and\nfrequently hates himself,--sometimes he even gets afraid of the gaunt\nand murderous monster he keeps hidden behind his outwardly pleasant\nbody-mask, and hastens to forget its frightful existence in drink and\ndebauchery. That is what I do occasionally,--you would not think it of\nme, would you?\"\n\n\"Never!\" I replied quickly, for something in his voice and aspect moved\nme strangely--\"You belie yourself, and wrong your own nature.\"\n\nHe laughed softly.\n\n\"Perhaps I do!\" he said carelessly--\"This much you may believe of\nme--that I am no worse than most men! Now to return to the subject of\nyour literary career,--you have written a book, you say,--well, publish\nit and see the result--if you only make one 'hit' that is something. And\nthere are ways of arranging that the 'hit' shall be made. What is your\nstory about? I hope it is improper?\"\n\n\"It certainly is not;\"--I replied warmly--\"It is a romance dealing with\nthe noblest forms of life and highest ambitions;--I wrote it with the\nintention of elevating and purifying the thoughts of my readers, and\nwished if I could, to comfort those who had suffered loss or sorrow--\"\n\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez smiled compassionately.\n\n\"Ah, it won't do!\" he interrupted--\"I assure you it won't;--it doesn't\nfit the age. It might go down, possibly, if you could give a\n'first-night' of it as it were to the critics, like one of my most\nintimate friends, Henry Irving,--a 'first-night' combined with an\nexcellent supper and any amount of good drinks going. Otherwise it's no\nuse. If it is to succeed by itself, it must not attempt to be\nliterature,--it must simply be indecent. As indecent as you can make it\nwithout offending advanced women,--that is giving you a good wide\nmargin. Put in as much as you can about sexual matters and the bearing\nof children,--in brief, discourse of men and women simply as cattle who\nexist merely for breeding purposes, and your success will be enormous.\nThere's not a critic living who won't applaud you,--there's not a\nschool-girl of fifteen who will not gloat over your pages in the silence\nof her virginal bedroom!\"\n\nSuch a flash of withering derision darted from his eyes as startled\nme,--I could find no words to answer him for the moment, and he went\non--\n\n\"What put it into your head, my dear Tempest, to write a book dealing\nwith, as you say, 'the noblest forms of life'? There are no noble forms\nof life left on this planet,--it is all low and commercial,--man is a\npigmy, and his aims are pigmy like himself. For noble forms of life seek\nother worlds!--there _are_ others. Then again, people don't want their\nthoughts raised or purified in the novels they read for amusement--they\ngo to church for that, and get very bored during the process. And why\nshould you wish to comfort folks who, out of their own sheer stupidity\ngenerally, get into trouble? They wouldn't comfort _you_,--they would\nnot give you sixpence to save you from starvation. My good fellow, leave\nyour quixotism behind you with your poverty. Live your life to\nyourself,--if you do anything for others they will only treat you with\nthe blackest ingratitude,--so take my advice, and don't sacrifice your\nown personal interests for any consideration whatever.\"\n\nHe rose from the table as he spoke and stood with his back to the bright\nfire, smoking his cigar tranquilly,--and I gazed at his handsome figure\nand face with just the faintest thrill of pained doubt darkening my\nadmiration.\n\n\"If you were not so good-looking I should call you heartless\"--I said at\nlast--\"But your features are a direct contradiction to your words. You\nhave not really that indifference to human nature which you strive to\nassume,--your whole aspect betokens a generosity of spirit which you\ncannot conquer if you would. Besides, are you not always trying to do\ngood?\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Always! That is, I am always at work endeavouring to gratify every\nman's desire. Whether that is good of me, or bad, remains to be proved.\nMen's wants are almost illimitable,--the only thing none of them ever\nseem to wish, so far as I am concerned, is to cut my acquaintance!\"\n\n\"Why, of course not! After once meeting you, how could they!\" I said,\nlaughing at the absurdity of the suggestion.\n\nHe gave me a whimsical side-look.\n\n\"Their desires are not always virtuous,\" he remarked, turning to flick\noff the ash of his cigar into the grate.\n\n\"But of course you do not gratify them in their vices!\" I rejoined,\nstill laughing--\"That would be playing the part of a benefactor somewhat\ntoo thoroughly!\"\n\n\"Ah now I see we shall flounder in the quicksands of theory if we go any\nfurther\"--he said--\"You forget, my dear fellow, that nobody can decide\nas to what _is_ vice, or what _is_ virtue. These things are\nchameleon-like, and take different colours in different countries.\nAbraham had two or three wives and several concubines, and he was the\nvery soul of virtue according to sacred lore,--whereas my Lord Tom-Noddy\nin London to-day has one wife and several concubines, and is really very\nmuch like Abraham in other particulars, yet he is considered a very\ndreadful person. 'Who shall decide when doctors disagree!' Let's drop\nthe subject, as we shall never settle it. What shall we do with the rest\nof the evening? There is a stout-limbed, shrewd wench at the Tivoli,\ndancing her way into the affections of a ricketty little Duke,--shall we\ngo and watch the admirable contortions with which she is wriggling into\na fixed position among the English aristocracy? Or are you tired, and\nwould you prefer a long night's rest?\"\n\nTo tell the truth I was thoroughly fatigued, and mentally as well as\nphysically worn out with the excitements of the day,--my head too was\nheavy with the wine to which I had so long been unaccustomed.\n\n\"Upon my word I think I would rather go to bed than anything--\" I\nconfessed--\"But what about my room?\"\n\n\"Oh, Amiel will have attended to that for you,--we'll ask him.\" And he\ntouched the bell. His valet instantly appeared.\n\n\"Have you got a room for Mr Tempest?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Excellency. An apartment in this corridor almost facing your\nExcellency's suite. It is not as well furnished as it might be, but I\nhave made it as comfortable as I can for the night.\"\n\n\"Thanks very much!\" I said--\"I am greatly obliged to you.\"\n\nAmiel bowed deferentially.\n\n\"Thank _you_, sir.\"\n\nHe retired, and I moved to bid my host good-night. He took my proffered\nhand, and held it in his, looking at me curiously the while.\n\n\"I like you, Geoffrey Tempest;\" he said--\"And because I like you, and\nbecause I think there are the makings of something higher than mere\nearthy brute in you, I am going to make you what you may perhaps\nconsider rather a singular proposition. It is this,--that if you don't\nlike _me_, say so at once, and we will part now, before we have time to\nknow anything more of each other, and I will endeavour not to cross your\npath again unless you seek me out. But if on the contrary, you do like\nme,--if you find something in my humour or turn of mind congenial to\nyour own disposition, give me your promise that you will be my friend\nand comrade for a while, say for a few months at any rate. I can take\nyou into the best society, and introduce you to the prettiest women in\nEurope as well as the most brilliant men. I know them all, and I believe\nI can be useful to you. But if there is the smallest aversion to me\nlurking in the depths of your nature\"--here he paused,--then resumed\nwith extraordinary solemnity--\"in God's name give it full way and let me\ngo,--because I swear to you in all sober earnest that I am not what I\nseem!\"\n\nStrongly impressed by his strange look and stranger manner, I hesitated\none moment,--and on that moment, had I but known it, hung my future. It\nwas true,--I had felt a passing shadow of distrust and repulsion for\nthis fascinating yet cynical man, and he seemed to have guessed it. But\nnow every suspicion of him vanished from my mind, and I clasped his hand\nwith renewed heartiness.\n\n\"My dear fellow, your warning comes too late!\" I said\nmirthfully--\"Whatever you are, or whatever you choose to think you are,\nI find you most sympathetic to my disposition, and I consider myself\nmost fortunate in knowing you. My old friend Carrington has indeed done\nme a good turn in bringing us together, and I assure you I shall be\nproud of your companionship. You seem to take a perverse delight in\nrunning yourself down!--but you know the old adage, 'the devil is not so\nblack as he is painted'?\"\n\n\"And that is true!\" he murmured dreamily--\"Poor devil! His faults are no\ndoubt much exaggerated by the clergy! And so we are to be friends?\"\n\n\"I hope so! I shall not be the first to break the compact!\"\n\nHis dark eyes rested upon me thoughtfully, yet there seemed to be a\nlurking smile in them as well.\n\n\"Compact is a good word\"--he said--\"So,--a compact we will consider it.\nI meant to improve your material fortunes,--you can dispense with that\naid now; but I think I can still be of service in pushing you on in\nsociety. And love--of course you will fall in love if you have not\nalready done so,--have you?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" I answered quickly, and with truth--\"I have seen no woman yet\nwho perfectly fulfils my notions of beauty.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing violently.\n\n\"Upon my word you are not wanting in audacity!\" he said--\"Nothing but\nperfect beauty will suit you, eh? But consider, my friend, you, though a\ngood-looking well-built man, are not yourself quite a Phoebus Apollo!\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with the matter\"--I rejoined--\"A man should\nchoose a wife with a careful eye to his own personal gratification, in\nthe same way that he chooses horses or wine,--perfection or nothing.\"\n\n\"And the woman?\"--Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez demanded, his eyes twinkling.\n\n\"The woman has really no right of choice\"--I responded,--for this was my\npet argument and I took pleasure in setting it forth--\"She must mate\nwherever she has the chance of being properly maintained. A man is\nalways a man,--a woman is only a man's appendage, and without beauty she\ncannot put forth any just claim to his admiration or his support.\"\n\n\"Right!--very right, and logically argued!\"--he exclaimed, becoming\npreternaturally serious in a moment--\"I myself have no sympathy with the\nnew ideas that are in vogue concerning the intellectuality of woman. She\nis simply the female of man,--she has no real soul save that which is a\nreflex of his, and being destitute of logic, she is incapable of forming\na correct opinion on any subject. All the imposture of religion is kept\nup by this unmathematical hysterical creature,--and it is curious,\nconsidering how inferior a being she is, what mischief she has contrived\nto make in the world, upsetting the plans of the wisest kings and\ncounsellors, who as mere men, should undoubtedly have mastered her! And\nin the present age she is becoming more than ever unmanageable.\"\n\n\"It is only a passing phase\"--I returned carelessly--\"A fad got up by a\nfew unloved and unlovable types of the feminine sex. I care very little\nfor women--I doubt whether I shall ever marry.\"\n\n\"Well you have plenty of time to consider, and amuse yourself with the\nfair ones, _en passant_\"--he said watching me narrowly--\"And in the\nmeantime I can take you round the different marriage-markets of the\nworld if you choose, though the largest one of them all is of course\nthis very metropolis. Splendid bargains to be had, my dear\nfriend!--wonderful blonde and brunette specimens going really very\ncheap. We'll examine them at our leisure. I'm glad you have yourself\ndecided that we are to be comrades,--for I am proud;--I may say damnably\nproud;--and never stay in any man's company when he expresses the\nslightest wish to be rid of me. Good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night!\" I responded. We clasped hands again and they were still\ninterlocked, when a sudden flash of lightning blazed vividly across the\nroom, followed instantaneously by a terrific clap of thunder. The\nelectric lights went out, and only the glow of the fire illumined our\nfaces. I was a little startled and confused,--the prince stood still,\nquite unconcerned, his eyes shining like those of a cat in the darkness.\n\n\"What a storm!\" he remarked lightly--\"Such thunder in winter is rather\nunusual. Amiel!\"\n\nThe valet entered, his sinister countenance resembling a white mask made\nvisible in the gloom.\n\n\"These lamps have gone out,\"--said his master--\"It's very odd that\ncivilized humanity has not yet learned the complete management of the\nelectric light. Can you put them in order, Amiel?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency.\" And in a few moments, by some dexterous\nmanipulation which I did not understand and could not see, the\ncrystal-cased jets shone forth again with renewed brilliancy. Another\npeal of thunder crashed overhead, followed by a downpour of rain.\n\n\"Really remarkable weather for January,\"--said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, again giving me\nhis hand--\"Good-night my friend! Sleep well.\"\n\n\"If the anger of the elements will permit!\" I returned, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, never mind the elements. Man has nearly mastered them or soon will\ndo so, now that he is getting gradually convinced there is no Deity to\ninterfere in his business. Amiel, show Mr Tempest to his room.\"\n\nAmiel obeyed, and crossing the corridor, ushered me into a large,\nluxurious apartment, richly furnished, and lit up by the blaze of a\nbright fire. The comforting warmth shone welcome upon me as I entered,\nand I who had not experienced such personal luxury since my boyhood's\ndays, felt more than ever overpowered by the jubilant sense of my sudden\nextraordinary good fortune. Amiel waited respectfully, now and then\nfurtively glancing at me with an expression which to my fancy had\nsomething derisive in it.\n\n\"Is there anything I can do for you sir?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No thank you,\"--I answered, endeavouring to throw an accent of careless\ncondescension into my voice--for somehow I felt this man must be kept\nstrictly in his place--\"you have been very attentive,--I shall not\nforget it.\"\n\nA slight smile flickered over his features.\n\n\"Much obliged to you, sir. Good-night.\"\n\nAnd he retired, leaving me alone. I paced the room up and down more\ndreamily than consciously, trying to think,--trying to set in order the\namazing events of the day, but my brain was still dazed and confused,\nand the only image of actual prominence in my mind was the striking and\nremarkable personality of my new friend Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez. His extraordinary good\nlooks, his attractive manner, his curious cynicism which was so oddly\nmixed with some deeper sentiment to which I could not give a name, all\nthe trifling yet uncommon peculiarities of his bearing and humour\nhaunted me and became indissolubly mingled as it were with myself and\nall the circumstances concerning me. I undressed before the fire,\nlistening drowsily to the rain, and the thunder which was now dying off\ninto sullen echoes.\n\n\"Geoffrey Tempest, the world is before you--\" I said, apostrophizing\nmyself indolently--\"you are a young man,--you have health, a good\nappearance, and brains,--added to these you now have five millions of\nmoney, and a wealthy prince for your friend. What more do you want of\nFate or Fortune? Nothing,--except fame! And that you will get easily,\nfor now-a-days even fame is purchaseable--like love. Your star is in the\nascendant,--no more literary drudgery for you my boy!--pleasure and\nprofit and ease are yours to enjoy for the rest of your life. You are a\nlucky dog!--at last you have your day!\"\n\nI flung myself upon the soft bed, and settled myself to sleep,--and as I\ndozed off, I still heard the rumble of heavy thunder in the distance.\nOnce I fancied I heard the prince's voice calling \"Amiel! Amiel!\" with a\nwildness resembling the shriek of an angry wind,--and at another moment\nI started violently from a profound slumber under the impression that\nsomeone had approached and was looking fixedly at me. I sat up in bed,\npeering into the darkness, for the fire had gone out;--then I turned on\na small electric night-lamp at my side which fully illumined the\nroom,--there was no one there. Yet my imagination played me such tricks\nbefore I could rest again that I thought I heard a hissing whisper near\nme that said--\n\n\"Peace! Trouble him not. Let the fool in his folly sleep!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe next morning on rising I learned that 'his excellency' as Prince\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez was called by his own servants and the employ\u00c3\u00a9s of the 'Grand,'\nhad gone out riding in the Park, leaving me to breakfast alone. I\ntherefore took that meal in the public room of the hotel, where I was\nwaited upon with the utmost obsequiousness, in spite of my shabby\nclothes, which I was of course still compelled to wear, having no\nchange. When would I be pleased to lunch? At what hour would I dine?\nShould my present apartment be retained?--or was it not satisfactory?\nWould I prefer a 'suite' similar to that occupied by his excellency? All\nthese deferential questions first astonished and then amused me,--some\nmysterious agency had evidently conveyed the rumour of my wealth among\nthose best fitted to receive it, and here was the first result. In reply\nI said my movements were uncertain,--I should be able to give definite\ninstructions in the course of a few hours, and that in the meantime I\nretained my room. The breakfast over I sallied forth to go to my\nlawyers, and was just about to order a hansom when I saw my new friend\ncoming back from his ride. He bestrode a magnificent chestnut mare,\nwhose wild eyes and strained quivering limbs showed she was fresh from a\nhard gallop and was scarcely yet satisfied to be under close control.\nShe curveted and danced among the carts and cabs in a somewhat risky\nfashion, but she had her master in Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, who if he had looked\nhandsome by night looked still more so by day, with a slight colour\nwarming the natural pallor of his complexion and his eyes sparkling with\nall the zest of exercise and enjoyment. I waited for his approach, as\ndid also Amiel, who as usual timed his appearance in the hotel corridor\nin exact accordance with the moment of his master's arrival. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez\nsmiled as he caught sight of me, touching his hat with the handle of his\nwhip by way of salutation.\n\n\"You slept late, Tempest\"--he said, as he dismounted and threw the reins\nto a groom who had cantered up after him,--\"To-morrow you must come with\nme and join what they call in fashionable slang parlance the Liver\nBrigade. Once upon a time it was considered the height of indelicacy and\nlow breeding to mention the 'liver' or any other portion of one's\ninternal machinery,--but we have done with all that now, and we find a\npeculiar satisfaction in discoursing of disease and unsavoury medical\nmatters generally. And in the Liver Brigade you see at a glance all\nthose interesting fellows who have sold themselves to the devil for the\nsake of the flesh-pots of Egypt,--men who eat till they are well-nigh\nbursting, and then prance up and down on good horses,--much too\nrespectable beasts by the way to bear such bestial burdens--in the hope\nof getting out of their poisoned blood the evil they have themselves put\nin. They think me one of them, but I am not.\"\n\nHe patted his mare and the groom led her away, the foam of her hard ride\nstill flecking her glossy chest and forelegs.\n\n\"Why do you join the procession then?\" I asked him, laughing and\nglancing at him with undisguised approval as I spoke, for he seemed more\nadmirably built than ever in his well-fitting riding gear--\"You are a\nfraud!\"\n\n\"I am!\" he responded lightly--\"And do you know I am not the only one in\nLondon! Where are you off to?\"\n\n\"To those lawyers who wrote to me last night;--Bentham and Ellis is the\nname of the firm. The sooner I interview them the better,--don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"Yes--but see here,\"--and he drew me aside--\"You must have some ready\ncash. It doesn't look well to apply at once for advances,--and there is\nreally no necessity to explain to these legal men that you were on the\nverge of starvation when their letter arrived. Take this\npocket-book,--remember you promised to let me be your banker,--and on\nyour way you might go to some well-reputed tailor and get properly\nrigged out. Ta-ta!\"\n\nHe moved off at a rapid pace,--I hurried after him, touched to the quick\nby his kindness.\n\n\"But wait--I say--Lucio!\" And I called him thus by his familiar name for\nthe first time. He stopped at once and stood quite still.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, regarding me with an attentive smile.\n\n\"You don't give me time to speak\"--I answered in a low voice, for we\nwere standing in one of the public corridors of the hotel--\"The fact is\nI have some money, or rather I can get it directly,--Carrington sent me\na draft for fifty pounds in his letter--I forgot to tell you about it.\nIt was very good of him to lend it to me,--you had better have it as\nsecurity for this pocket-book,--by-the-bye how much is there inside it?\"\n\n\"Five hundred, in bank notes of tens and twenties,\"--he responded with\nbusiness-like brevity.\n\n\"Five hundred! My dear fellow, I don't want all that. It's too much!\"\n\n\"Better have too much than too little nowadays,\"--he retorted with a\nlaugh--\"My dear Tempest, don't make such a business of it. Five hundred\npounds is really nothing. You can spend it all on a dressing-case for\nexample. Better send back John Carrington's draft,--I don't think much\nof his generosity considering that he came into a mine worth a hundred\nthousand pounds sterling, a few days before I left Australia.\"\n\nI heard this with great surprise, and, I must admit with a slight\nfeeling of resentment too. The frank and generous character of my old\nchum 'Boffles' seemed to darken suddenly in my eyes,--why could he not\nhave told me of his good fortune in his letter? Was he afraid I might\ntrouble him for further loans? I suppose my looks expressed my\nthoughts, for Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, who had observed me intently, presently added--\n\n\"Did he not tell you of his luck? That was not very friendly of him--but\nas I remarked last night, money often spoils a man.\"\n\n\"Oh I daresay he meant no slight by the omission,\" I said hurriedly,\nforcing a smile--\"No doubt he will make it the subject of his next\nletter. Now as to this five hundred\"--\n\n\"Keep it, man, keep it\"--he interposed impatiently--\"What do you talk\nabout security for? Haven't I got _you_ as security?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, I am fairly reliable now\"--I said--\"And I'm not going\nto run away.\"\n\n\"From _me_?\" he queried, with a half cold half kind glance; \"No,--I\nfancy not!\"\n\nHe waved his hand lightly and left me, and I, putting the leather case\nof notes in my inner breast-pocket, hailed a hansom and was driven off\nrapidly to Basinghall Street where my solicitors awaited me.\n\nArrived at my destination, I sent up my name, and was received at once\nwith the utmost respect by two small chips of men in rusty black who\nrepresented 'the firm.' At my request they sent down their clerk to pay\nand dismiss my cab, while I, opening Lucio's pocket book, asked them to\nchange me a ten-pound note into gold and silver which they did with\nready good-will. Then we went into business together. My deceased\nrelative, whom I had never seen as far as I myself remembered, but who\nhad seen me as a motherless baby in my nurse's arms, had left me\neverything he possessed unconditionally, including several rare\ncollections of pictures, jewels and curios. His will was so concisely\nand clearly worded that there were no possibilities of any legal\nhair-splitting over it,--and I was informed that in a week or ten days\nat the utmost everything would be in order and at my sole disposition.\n\n\"You are a very fortunate man Mr Tempest;\"--said the senior partner Mr\nBentham, as he folded up the last of the papers we had been looking\nthrough and put it by--\"At your age this princely inheritance may be\neither a great boon to you or a great curse,--one never knows. The\npossession of such enormous wealth involves great responsibilities.\"\n\nI was amused at what I considered the impertinence of this mere servant\nof the law in presuming to moralize on my luck.\n\n\"Many people would be glad to accept such responsibilities and change\nplaces with me\"--I said with a flippant air--\"You yourself, for\nexample?\"\n\nI knew this remark was not in good taste, but I made it wilfully,\nfeeling that he had no business to preach to me as it were on the\nresponsibilities of wealth. He took no offence however,--he merely gave\nme an observant side-glance like that of some meditative crow.\n\n\"No Mr Tempest, no\"--he said drily--\"I do not think I should at all be\ndisposed to change places with you. I feel very well satisfied as I am.\nMy brain is my bank, and brings me in quite sufficient interest to live\nupon, which is all that I desire. To be comfortable, and pay one's way\nhonestly is enough for me. I have never envied the wealthy.\"\n\n\"Mr Bentham is a philosopher,\"--interposed his partner, Mr Ellis\nsmiling--\"In our profession Mr Tempest, we see so many ups and downs of\nlife, that in watching the variable fortunes of our clients, we\nourselves learn the lesson of content.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is a lesson that I have never mastered till now!\" I responded\nmerrily--\"But at the present moment I confess myself satisfied.\"\n\nThey each gave me a formal little bow, and Mr Bentham shook hands.\n\n\"Business being concluded, allow me to congratulate you,\" he said\npolitely--\"Of course, if you should wish at any time to entrust your\nlegal affairs to other hands, my partner and myself are perfectly\nwilling to withdraw. Your deceased relative had the highest confidence\nin us....\"\n\n\"As I have also, I assure you,\"--I interrupted quickly--\"Pray do me the\nfavour to continue managing things for me as you did for my relative,\nand be assured of my gratitude in advance.\"\n\nBoth little men bowed again, and this time Mr Ellis shook hands.\n\n\"We shall do our best for you, Mr Tempest, shall we not Bentham?\"\nBentham nodded gravely. \"And now what do you say--shall we mention it\nBentham?--or shall we not mention it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" responded Bentham sententiously--\"it would be as well to\nmention it.\"\n\nI glanced from one to the other, not understanding what they meant. Mr\nEllis rubbed his hands and smiled deprecatingly.\n\n\"The fact is Mr Tempest, your deceased relative had one very curious\nidea--he was a shrewd man and a clever one, but he certainly had one\nvery curious idea--and perhaps if he had followed it up to any extent,\nit might--yes, it might have landed him in a lunatic asylum and\nprevented his disposing of his extensive fortune in the--er--the very\njust and reasonable manner he has done. Happily for himself and--er--for\nyou, he did not follow it up, and to the last he retained his admirable\nbusiness qualities and high sense of rectitude. But I do not think he\never quite dispossessed himself of the idea itself, did he Bentham?\"\n\nBentham gazed meditatively at the round black mark of the gas-burner\nwhere it darkened the ceiling.\n\n\"I think not,--no, I think not,\" he answered--\"I believe he was\nperfectly convinced of it.\"\n\n\"And what was it?\" I asked, getting impatient--\"Did he want to bring out\nsome patent?--a new notion for a flying-machine, and get rid of his\nmoney in that way?\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" and Mr Ellis laughed a soft pleasant little laugh over my\nsuggestion--\"No, my dear sir--nothing of a purely mechanical or\ncommercial turn captivated his imagination. He was too,--er--yes, I\nthink I may say too profoundly opposed to what is called 'progress' in\nthe world to aid it by any new invention or other means whatever. You\nsee it is a little awkward for me to explain to you what really seems to\nbe the most absurd and fantastic notion,--but--to begin with, we never\nreally knew how he made his money, did we Bentham?\"\n\nBentham shook his head and pursed his lips closely together.\n\n\"We had to take charge of large sums, and advise as to investments and\nother matters,--but it was not our business to inquire where the cash\ncame from in the first place, was it, Bentham?\"\n\nAgain Bentham shook his head solemnly.\n\n\"We were entrusted with it;\"--went on his partner, pressing the tips of\nhis fingers together caressingly as he spoke--\"and we did our best to\nfulfil that trust--with--er--with discretion and fidelity. And it was\nonly after we had been for many years connected in business that our\nclient mentioned--er--his idea;--a most erratic and extraordinary one,\nwhich was briefly this,--that he had sold himself to the devil, and that\nhis large fortune was one result of the bargain!\"\n\nI burst out laughing heartily.\n\n\"What a ridiculous notion!\" I exclaimed--\"Poor man!--a weak spot in his\nbrain somewhere evidently,--or perhaps he used the expression as a mere\nfigure of speech?\"\n\n\"I think not;\"--responded Mr Ellis half interrogatively, still caressing\nhis fingers--\"I think our client did not use the phrase 'sold to the\ndevil' as a figure of speech merely, Mr Bentham?\"\n\n\"I am positive he did not,\"--said Bentham seriously--\"He spoke of the\n'bargain' as an actual and accomplished fact.\"\n\nI laughed again with a trifle less boisterousness.\n\n\"Well, people have all sorts of fancies now-a-days\"--I said; \"What with\nBlavatskyism, Besantism and hypnotism, it is no wonder if some folks\nstill have a faint credence in the silly old superstition of a devil's\nexistence. But for a thoroughly sensible man....\"\n\n\"Yes--er, yes;\"--interrupted Mr Ellis--\"Your relative, Mr Tempest, _was_\na thoroughly sensible man, and this--er--this idea was the only fancy\nthat ever appeared to have taken root in his eminently practical mind.\nBeing only an idea, it seemed hardly worth mentioning--but perhaps it is\nwell--Mr Bentham agreeing with me--that we _have_ mentioned it.\"\n\n\"It is a satisfaction and relief to ourselves,\"--said Mr Bentham, \"to\nhave had it mentioned.\"\n\nI smiled, and thanking them, rose to go. They bowed to me once more,\nsimultaneously, looking almost like twin brothers, so identically had\ntheir united practice of the law impressed itself upon their features.\n\n\"Good-day Mr Tempest,\"--said Mr Bentham--\"I need scarcely say that we\nshall serve you as we served our late client, to the best of our\nability. And in matters where advice may be pleasant or profitable, we\nmay possibly be of use to you. May we ask whether you require any cash\nadvances immediately?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\"--I answered, feeling grateful to my friend Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez for\nhaving placed me in a perfectly independent position to confront these\nsolicitors--\"I am amply provided.\"\n\nThey seemed, I fancied, a trifle surprised at this, but were too\ndiscreet to offer any remark. They wrote down my address at the Grand\nHotel, and sent their clerk to show me to the door. I gave this man\nhalf-a-sovereign to drink my health which he very cheerfully promised to\ndo,--then I walked round by the Law Courts, trying to realize that I was\nnot in a dizzy dream, but that I was actually and solidly, five times a\nmillionaire. As luck would have it, in turning a corner I jostled up\nagainst a man coming the other way, the very publisher who had returned\nme my rejected manuscript the day before.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he exclaimed stopping short.\n\n\"Hullo!\" I rejoined.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" he went on--\"Going to try and place that\nunlucky novel? My dear boy, believe me it will never do as it is....\"\n\n\"It will do, it shall do;\"--I said calmly--\"I am going to publish it\nmyself.\"\n\nHe started. \"Publish it yourself! Good heavens!--it will cost\nyou--ah!--sixty or seventy, perhaps a hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"I don't care if it costs me a thousand!\"\n\nA red flush came into his face, and his eyes opened in astonishment.\n\n\"I thought ... excuse me ...\" he stammered awkwardly; \"I thought money\nwas scarce with you----\"\n\n\"It was,\" I answered drily--\"It isn't now.\"\n\nThen, his utterly bewildered look, together with the whole\ntopsy-turviness of things in my altered position, struck me so forcibly\nthat I burst out laughing, wildly, and with a prolonged noise and\nviolence that apparently alarmed him, for he began looking nervously\nabout him in all directions as if meditating flight. I caught him by the\narm.\n\n\"Look here man,\" I said, trying to conquer my almost hysterical\nmirth--\"I'm not mad--don't you think it,--I'm only a--millionaire!\" And\nI began laughing again; the situation seemed to me so sublimely\nridiculous. But the worthy publisher did not see it at all--and his\nfeatures expressed so much genuine alarm that I made a further effort to\ncontrol myself and succeeded. \"I assure you on my word of honour I'm not\njoking--it's a fact. Last night I wanted a dinner, and you, like a good\nfellow, offered to give me one,--to-day I possess five millions of\nmoney! Don't stare so! don't have a fit of apoplexy! And as I have told\nyou, I shall publish my book myself at my own expense, and it _shall_\nsucceed! Oh I'm in earnest, grim earnest, grim as death!--I've more than\nenough in my pocketbook to pay for its publication _now_!\"\n\nI loosed my hold of him, and he fell back stupefied and confused.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" he muttered feebly--\"It's like a dream!--I was\nnever more astonished in my life!\"\n\n\"Nor I!\" I said, another temptation to laughter threatening my\ncomposure,--\"But strange things happen in life, as in fiction. And that\nbook which the builders--I mean the readers--rejected, shall be the\nheadstone of the corner--or--the success of the season! What will you\ntake to bring it out?\"\n\n\"Take? I? I bring it out!\"\n\n\"Yes, you--why not? If I offer you a chance to turn an honest penny\nshall your paid pack of 'readers' prevent your accepting it? Fie! you\nare not a slave,--this is a free country. I know the kind of people who\n'read' for you,--the gaunt unlovable spinster of fifty,--the dyspeptic\nbook-worm who is a 'literary failure' and can find nothing else to do\nbut scrawl growling comments on the manuscript of promising work,--why\nin heaven's name should you rely on such incompetent opinion? I'll pay\nyou for the publication of my book at as stiff a price as you choose and\nsomething over for good-will. And I guarantee you another thing--it\nshall not only make my name as an author, but yours as a publisher. I'll\nadvertise royally, and I'll work the press. Everything in this world can\nbe done for money ...\"\n\n\"Stop, stop,\"--he interrupted.--\"This is so sudden! You must let me\nthink of it--you must give me time to consider----\"\n\n\"Take a day for your meditations then,\" I said--\"But no longer. For if\nyou don't say yes, I'll get another man, and he'll have the big pickings\ninstead of you! Be wise in time, my friend!--good-day!\"\n\nHe ran after me.\n\n\"Stay,--look here! You're so strange, so wild--so erratic you know! Your\nhead seems quite turned!\"\n\n\"It is! The right way round this time!\"\n\n\"Dear dear me,\" and he smiled benevolently--\"Why, you don't give me a\nchance to congratulate you. I really do, you know--I congratulate you\nsincerely!\" And he shook me by the hand quite fervently. \"And as regards\nthe book I believe there was really no fault found with it in the\nmatter of literary style or quality,--it was simply too--too\ntranscendental, and unlikely therefore to suit the public taste. The\nDomestic-Iniquity line is what we find pays best at present. But I will\nthink about it--where will a letter find you?\"\n\n\"Grand Hotel,\" I responded, inwardly amused at his puzzled and anxious\nexpression--I knew he was already mentally calculating how much he could\nmake out of me in the pursuit of my literary whim--\"Come there, and\nlunch or dine with me to-morrow if you like--only send me a word\nbeforehand. Remember, I give you just a day's grace to decide,--it must\nbe yes or no, in twenty-four hours!\"\n\nAnd with this I left him, staring vaguely after me like a man who has\nseen some nameless wonder drop out of the sky at his feet. I went on,\nlaughing to myself inaudibly, till I saw one or two passers-by looking\nat me so surprisedly that I came to the conclusion that I must put a\ndisguise on my thoughts if I would not be taken for a madman. I walked\nbriskly, and presently my excitement cooled down. I resumed the normal\ncondition of the phlegmatic Englishman who considers it the height of\nbad form to display any personal emotion whatever, and I occupied the\nrest of the morning in purchasing some ready-made apparel which by\nunusual good luck happened to fit me, and also in giving an extensive,\nnot to say extravagant order to a fashionable tailor in Sackville Street\nwho promised me everything with punctuality and despatch. I next sent\noff the rent I owed to the landlady of my former lodgings, adding five\npounds extra by way of recognition of the poor woman's long patience in\ngiving me credit, and general kindness towards me during my stay in her\ndismal house,--and this done I returned to the Grand in high spirits,\nlooking and feeling very much the better for my ready-made outfit. A\nwaiter met me in the corridor and with the most obsequious deference,\ninformed me that 'his excellency the prince' was waiting luncheon for me\nin his own apartments. Thither I repaired at once, and found my new\nfriend alone in his sumptuous drawing-room, standing near the full light\nof the largest window and holding in his hand an oblong crystal case\nthrough which he was looking with an almost affectionate solicitude.\n\n\"Ah, Geoffrey! Here you are!\" he exclaimed--\"I imagined you would get\nthrough your business by lunch time, so I waited.\"\n\n\"Very good of you!\" I said, pleased at the friendly familiarity he\ndisplayed in thus calling me by my Christian name--\"What have you got\nthere?\"\n\n\"A pet of mine,\"--he answered, smiling slightly--\"Did you ever see\nanything like it before?\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI approached and examined the box he held. It was perforated with finely\ndrilled holes for the admission of air, and within it lay a brilliant\nwinged insect coloured with all the tints and half-tints of the rainbow.\n\n\"Is it alive?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is alive, and has a sufficient share of intelligence,\"--replied\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez. \"I feed it and it knows me,--that is the utmost you can say of\nthe most civilized human beings; they know what feeds them. It is quite\ntame and friendly as you perceive,\"--and opening the case he gently\nadvanced his forefinger. The glittering beetle's body palpitated with\nthe hues of an opal; its radiant wings expanded, and it rose at once to\nits protector's hand and clung there. He lifted it out and held it\naloft, then shaking it to and fro lightly, he exclaimed--\n\n\"Off, Sprite! Fly, and return to me!\"\n\nThe creature soared away through the room and round and round the\nceiling, looking like a beautiful iridescent jewel, the whirr of its\nwings making a faint buzzing sound as it flew. I watched it fascinated,\ntill after a few graceful movements hither and thither, it returned to\nits owner's still outstretched hand, and again settled there making no\nfurther attempt to fly.\n\n\"There is a well-worn platitude which declares that 'in the midst of\nlife we are in death'\"--said the prince then softly, bending his dark\ndeep eyes on the insect's quivering wings--\"But as a matter of fact that\nmaxim is wrong as so many trite human maxims are. It should be 'in the\nmidst of death we are in life.' This creature is a rare and curious\nproduction of death, but not I believe the only one of its kind. Others\nhave been found under precisely similar circumstances. I took possession\nof this one myself in rather a weird fashion,--will the story bore you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary\"--I rejoined eagerly, my eyes fixed on the radiant\nbat-shaped thing that glittered in the light as though its veins were\nphosphorescent.\n\nHe paused a moment, watching me.\n\n\"Well,--it happened simply thus,--I was present at the uncasing of an\nEgyptian female mummy;--her talismans described her as a princess of a\nfamous royal house. Several curious jewels were tied round her neck, and\non her chest was a piece of beaten gold quarter of an inch thick.\nUnderneath this gold plate, her body was swathed round and round in an\nunusual number of scented wrappings; and when these were removed it was\ndiscovered that the mummified flesh between her breasts had decayed\naway, and in the hollow or nest thus formed by the process of\ndecomposition, this insect I hold was found alive, as brilliant in\ncolour as it is now!\"\n\nI could not repress a slight nervous shudder.\n\n\"Horrible!\" I said--\"I confess, if I were you, I should not care to make\na pet of such an uncanny object. I should kill it, I think.\"\n\nHe kept his bright intent gaze upon me.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked. \"I'm afraid, my dear Geoffrey, you are not disposed to\nstudy science. To kill the poor thing who managed to find life in the\nvery bosom of death, is a cruel suggestion, is it not? To me, this\nunclassified insect is a valuable proof (if I needed one) of the\nindestructibility of the germs of conscious existence; it has eyes, and\nthe senses of taste, smell, touch and hearing,--and it gained these\ntogether with its intelligence, out of the dead flesh of a woman who\nlived, and no doubt loved and sinned and suffered more than four\nthousand years ago!\" He broke off,--then suddenly added--\"All the same\nI frankly admit to you that I believe it to be an evil creature. I do\nindeed! But I like it none the less for that. In fact I have rather a\nfantastic notion about it myself. I am much inclined to accept the idea\nof the transmigration of souls, and so I please my humour sometimes by\nthinking that perhaps the princess of that Royal Egyptian house had a\nwicked, brilliant, vampire soul,--and that ... _here it is_!\"\n\nA cold thrill ran through me from head to foot at these words, and as I\nlooked at the speaker standing opposite me in the wintry light, dark and\ntall, with the 'wicked, brilliant, vampire soul' clinging to his hand,\nthere seemed to me to be a sudden hideousness declared in his excessive\npersonal beauty. I was conscious of a vague terror, but I attributed it\nto the gruesome nature of the story, and, determining to combat my\nsensations, I examined the weird insect more closely. As I did so, its\nbright beady eyes sparkled, I thought, vindictively, and I stepped back,\nvexed with myself at the foolish fear of the thing which overpowered me.\n\n\"It is certainly remarkable,\"--I murmured--\"No wonder you value it,--as\na curiosity. Its eyes are quite distinct, almost intelligent in fact.\"\n\n\"No doubt she had beautiful eyes,\"--said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez smiling.\n\n\"She? Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"The princess, of course!\" he answered, evidently amused; \"The dear dead\nlady,--some of whose personality must be in this creature, seeing that\nit had nothing but her body to nourish itself upon.\"\n\nAnd here he replaced the creature in its crystal habitation with the\nutmost care.\n\n\"I suppose\"--I said slowly, \"you, in your pursuit of science, would\ninfer from this that nothing actually perishes completely?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" returned Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez emphatically. \"There, my dear Tempest, is\nthe mischief,--or the deity,--of things. Nothing can be entirely\nannihilated;--not even a thought.\"\n\nI was silent, watching him while he put the glass case with its uncanny\noccupant away out of sight.\n\n\"And now for luncheon,\" he said gaily, passing his arm through\nmine--\"You look twenty per cent. better than when you went out this\nmorning, Geoffrey, so I conclude your legal matters are disposed of\nsatisfactorily. And what else have you done with yourself?\"\n\nSeated at table with the dark-faced Amiel in attendance, I related my\nmorning's adventures, dwelling at length on my chance meeting with the\npublisher who had on the previous day refused my manuscript, and who\nnow, I felt sure, would be only too glad to close with the offer I had\nmade him. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez listened attentively, smiling now and then.\n\n\"Of course!\" he said, when I had concluded. \"There is nothing in the\nleast surprising in the conduct of the worthy man. In fact I think he\nshowed remarkable discretion and decency in not at once jumping at your\nproposition,--his pleasant hypocrisy in retiring to think it over, shows\nhim to be a person of tact and foresight. Did you ever imagine that a\nhuman being or a human conscience existed that could not be bought? My\ngood fellow, you can buy a king if you only give a long price enough;\nand the Pope will sell you a specially reserved seat in his heaven if\nyou will only hand him the cash down while he is on earth! Nothing is\ngiven free in this world save the air and the sunshine,--everything else\nmust be bought,--with blood, tears and groans occasionally,--but\noftenest with money.\"\n\nI fancied that Amiel, behind his master's chair, smiled darkly at\nthis,--and my instinctive dislike of the fellow kept me more or less\nreticent concerning my affairs till the luncheon was over. I could not\nformulate to myself any substantial reason for my aversion to this\nconfidential servant of the prince's,--but do what I would the aversion\nremained, and increased each time I saw his sullen, and as I thought,\nsneering features. Yet he was perfectly respectful and deferential; I\ncould find no actual fault with him,--nevertheless when at last he\nplaced the coffee, cognac, and cigars on the table and noiselessly\nwithdrew, I was conscious of a great relief, and breathed more freely.\nAs soon as we were alone, Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez lit a cigar and settled himself for a\nsmoke, looking over at me with a personal interest and kindness which\nmade his handsome face more than ever attractive.\n\n\"Now let us talk,\"--he said--\"I believe I am at present the best friend\nyou have, and I certainly know the world better than you do. What do you\npropose to make of your life? Or in other words how do you mean to begin\nspending your money?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, I shan't provide funds for the building of a church,\nor the endowment of a hospital,\"--I said--\"I shall not even start a Free\nLibrary, for these institutions, besides becoming centres for infectious\ndiseases, generally get presided over by a committee of local grocers\nwho presume to consider themselves judges of literature. My dear Prince\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez, I mean to spend my money on my own pleasure, and I daresay I\nshall find plenty of ways to do it.\"\n\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez fanned away the smoke of his cigar with one hand, and his dark\neyes shone with a peculiarly vivid light through the pale grey floating\nhaze.\n\n\"With your fortune, you could make hundreds of miserable people\nhappy;\"--he suggested.\n\n\"Thanks, I would rather be happy myself first\"--I answered gaily--\"I\ndaresay I seem to you selfish,--you are philanthropic I know; I am not.\"\n\nHe still regarded me steadily.\n\n\"You might help your fellow-workers in literature....\"\n\nI interrupted him with a decided gesture.\n\n\"That I will never do, my friend, though the heavens should crack! My\nfellow-workers in literature have kicked me down at every opportunity,\nand done their best to keep me from earning a bare livelihood,--it is my\nturn at kicking now, and I will show them as little mercy, as little\nhelp, as little sympathy as they have shown me!\"\n\n\"Revenge is sweet!\" he quoted sententiously--\"I should recommend your\nstarting a high-class half-crown magazine.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Can you ask? Just think of the ferocious satisfaction it would give you\nto receive the manuscripts of your literary enemies, and reject them! To\nthrow their letters into the waste-paper basket, and send back their\npoems, stories, political articles and what not, with '_Returned with\nthanks_' or '_Not up to our mark_' type-written on the backs thereof! To\ndig knives into your rivals through the medium of anonymous criticism!\nThe howling joy of a savage with twenty scalps at his belt would be tame\nin comparison to it! I was an editor once myself, and I know!\"\n\nI laughed at his whimsical earnestness.\n\n\"I daresay you are right,\"--I said--\"I can grasp the vengeful position\nthoroughly! But the management of a magazine would be too much trouble\nto me,--too much of a tie.\"\n\n\"_Don't_ manage it! Follow the example of all the big editors, and live\nout of the business altogether,--but take the profits! You never see the\nreal editor of a leading daily newspaper you know,--you can only\ninterview the sub. The real man is, according to the seasons of the\nyear, at Ascot, in Scotland, at Newmarket, or wintering in Egypt,--he is\nsupposed to be responsible for everything in his journal, but he is\ngenerally the last person who knows anything about it. He relies on his\n'staff'--a very bad crutch at times,--and when his 'staff' are in a\ndifficulty, they get out of it by saying they are unable to decide\nwithout the editor. Meanwhile the editor is miles away, comfortably free\nfrom worry. You could bamboozle the public in that way if you liked.\"\n\n\"I could, but I shouldn't care to do so,\" I answered--\"If I had a\nbusiness I would not neglect it. I believe in doing things thoroughly.\"\n\n\"So do I!\" responded Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez promptly. \"I am a very thorough-going\nfellow myself, and whatever my hand findeth to do, I do it with my\nmight!--excuse me for quoting Scripture!\" He smiled, a little ironically\nI thought, then resumed--\"Well, in what, at present does your idea of\nenjoying your heritage consist?\"\n\n\"In publishing my book,\" I answered. \"That very book I could get no one\nto accept,--I tell you, I will make it the talk of London!\"\n\n\"Possibly you will\"--he said, looking at me through half-closed eyes and\na cloud of smoke,--\"London easily talks. Particularly on unsavoury and\nquestionable subjects. Therefore,--as I have already hinted,--if your\nbook were a judicious mixture of Zola, Huysmans and Baudelaire, or had\nfor its heroine a 'modest' maid who considered honourable marriage a\n'degradation,' it would be quite sure of success in these days of new\nSodom and Gomorrah.\" Here he suddenly sprang up, and flinging away his\ncigar, confronted me. \"Why do not the heavens rain fire on this accursed\ncity! It is ripe for punishment,--full of abhorrent creatures not worth\nthe torturing in hell to which it is said liars and hypocrites are\ncondemned! Tempest, if there is one human being more than another that I\nutterly abhor, it is the type of man so common to the present time, the\nman who huddles his own loathly vices under a cloak of assumed\nbroad-mindedness and virtue. Such an one will even deify the loss of\nchastity in woman by the name of 'purity,'--because he knows that it is\nby her moral and physical ruin alone that he can gratify his brutal\nlusts. Rather than be such a sanctimonious coward I would openly\nproclaim myself vile!\"\n\n\"That is because yours is a noble nature\"--I said--\"You are an exception\nto the rule.\"\n\n\"An exception? I?\"--and he laughed bitterly--\"Yes, you are right; I am\nan exception among men perhaps,--but I am one with the beasts in\nhonesty! The lion does not assume the manners of the dove,--he loudly\nannounces his own ferocity. The very cobra, stealthy though its\nmovements be, evinces its meaning by a warning hiss or rattle. The\nhungry wolf's bay is heard far down the wind, intimidating the hurrying\ntraveller among the wastes of snow. But man gives no clue to his\nintent--more malignant than the lion, more treacherous than the snake,\nmore greedy than the wolf, he takes his fellow-man's hand in pretended\nfriendship, and an hour later defames his character behind his\nback,--with a smiling face he hides a false and selfish heart,--flinging\nhis pigmy mockery at the riddle of the Universe, he stands gibing at\nGod, feebly a-straddle on his own earth-grave--Heavens!\"--here he\nstopped short with a passionate gesture--\"What should the Eternities do\nwith such a thankless, blind worm as he!\"\n\nHis voice rang out with singular emphasis,--his eyes glowed with a fiery\nardour; startled by his impressive manner I let my cigar die out and\nstared at him in mute amazement. What an inspired countenance!--what an\nimposing figure!--how sovereignly supreme and almost god-like in his\nlooks he seemed at the moment;--and yet there was something terrifying\nin his attitude of protest and defiance. He caught my wondering\nglance,--the glow of passion faded from his face,--he laughed and\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I think I was born to be an actor\"--he said carelessly--\"Now and then\nthe love of declamation masters me. Then I speak--as Prime Ministers and\nmen in Parliament speak--to suit the humour of the hour, and without\nmeaning a single word I say!\"\n\n\"I cannot accept that statement\"--I answered him, smiling a little--\"You\ndo mean what you say,--though I fancy you are rather a creature of\nimpulse.\"\n\n\"Do you really!\" he exclaimed--\"How wise of you!--good Geoffrey Tempest,\nhow very wise of you! But you are wrong. There never was a being created\nwho was less impulsive, or more charged with set purpose than I. Believe\nme or not as you like,--belief is a sentiment that cannot be forced. If\nI told you that I am a dangerous companion,--that I like evil things\nbetter than good,--that I am not a safe guide for any man, what would\nyou think?\"\n\n\"I should think you were whimsically fond of under-estimating your own\nqualities\"--I said, re-lighting my cigar, and feeling somewhat amused by\nhis earnestness--\"And I should like you just as well as I do\nnow,--perhaps better,--though that would be difficult.\"\n\nAt these words, he seated himself, bending his steadfast dark eyes full\nupon me.\n\n\"Tempest, you follow the fashion of the prettiest women about\ntown,--they always like the greatest scoundrels!\"\n\n\"But you are not a scoundrel;\"--I rejoined, smoking peacefully.\n\n\"No,--I'm not a scoundrel, but there's a good deal of the devil in me.\"\n\n\"All the better!\" I said, stretching myself out in my chair with lazy\ncomfort--\"I hope there's something of him in me too.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in him?\" asked Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez smiling.\n\n\"The devil? of course not!\"\n\n\"He is a very fascinating legendary personage;\"--continued the prince,\nlighting another cigar and beginning to puff at it slowly--\"And he is\nthe subject of many a fine story. Picture his fall from\nheaven!--'Lucifer Son of the Morning'--what a title, and what a\nbirthright! To be born of the morning implies to be a creature formed of\ntranslucent light undefiled, with all the warm rose of a million orbs of\nday colouring his bright essence, and all the lustre of fiery planets\nflaming in his eyes. Splendid and supreme, at the right hand of Deity\nitself he stood, this majestic Arch-angel, and before his unwearied\nvision rolled the grandest creative splendours of God's thoughts and\ndreams. All at once he perceived in the vista of embryonic things a new\nsmall world, and on it a being forming itself slowly as it were into the\nAngelic likeness,--a being weak yet strong, sublime yet foolish,--a\nstrange paradox, destined to work its way through all the phases of\nlife, till imbibing the very breath and soul of the Creator it should\ntouch Conscious Immortality,--Eternal Joy. Then Lucifer, full of wrath,\nturned on the Master of the Spheres, and flung forth his reckless\ndefiance, crying aloud--'Wilt thou make of this slight poor creature an\nAngel even as I? I do protest against thee and condemn! Lo, if thou\nmakest Man in Our image I will destroy him utterly, as unfit to share\nwith me the splendours of Thy Wisdom,--the glory of Thy love!' And the\nVoice Supreme in accents terrible and beautiful replied; 'Lucifer, Son\nof the Morning, full well dost thou know that never can an idle or\nwasted word be spoken before Me. For Free-will is the gift of the\nImmortals; therefore what thou sayest, thou must needs do! Fall, proud\nSpirit from thy high estate!--thou and thy companions with thee!--and\nreturn no more till Man himself redeem thee! Each human soul that yields\nunto thy tempting shall be a new barrier set between thee and heaven;\neach one that of its own choice doth repel and overcome thee, shall lift\nthee nearer thy lost home! When the world rejects thee, I will pardon\nand again receive thee,--but _not till then_.'\"\n\n\"I never heard exactly that version of the legend before,\"--I\nsaid,--\"The idea that Man should redeem the devil is quite new to me.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" and he looked at me fixedly--\"Well--it is one form of the\nstory, and by no means the most unpoetical. Poor Lucifer! His punishment\nis of course eternal, and the distance between himself and Heaven must\nbe rapidly increasing every day,--for Man will never assist him to\nretrieve his error. Man will reject God fast enough and gladly\nenough--but never the devil. Judge then, how, under the peculiar\ncircumstances of his doom, this 'Lucifer, Son of the Morning,' Satan, or\nwhatever else he is called, must hate Humanity!\"\n\nI smiled. \"Well he has one remedy left to him\"--I observed--\"He need not\ntempt anybody.\"\n\n\"You forget!--he is bound to keep his word, according to the\nlegend\"--said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez--\"He swore before God that he would destroy Man\nutterly,--he must therefore fulfil that oath, if he can. Angels, it\nwould seem, may not swear before the Eternal without endeavouring at\nleast to fulfil their vows,--men swear in the name of God every day\nwithout the slightest intention of carrying out their promises.\"\n\n\"But it's all the veriest nonsense,\"--I said somewhat impatiently--\"All\nthese old legends are rubbish. You tell the story well, and almost as if\nyou believed in it,--that is because you have the gift of speaking with\neloquence. Nowadays no one believes in either devils or angels;--I, for\nexample, do not even believe in the soul.\"\n\n\"I know you do not\"--he answered suavely--\"And your scepticism is very\ncomfortable because it relieves you of all personal responsibility. I\nenvy you! For--I regret to say, I am compelled to believe in the soul.\"\n\n\"Compelled!\" I echoed--\"That is absurd--no one can compel you to accept\na mere theory.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a flitting smile that darkened rather than\nlightened his face.\n\n\"True! very true! There is no compelling force in the whole\nUniverse,--Man is the supreme and independent creature,--master of all\nhe surveys and owning no other dominion save his personal desire.\nTrue--I forgot! Let us avoid theology, please, and psychology also,--let\nus talk about the only subject that has any sense or interest in\nit--namely, Money. I perceive your present plans are definite,--you wish\nto publish a book that shall create a stir and make you famous. It seems\na modest enough campaign! Have you no wider ambitions? There are several\nways, you know, of getting talked about. Shall I enumerate them for your\nconsideration?\"\n\nI laughed. \"If you like!\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place I should suggest your getting yourself\nproperly paragraphed. It must be known to the press that you are an\nexceedingly rich man. There is an Agency for the circulation of\nparagraphs,--I daresay they'll do it sufficiently well for about ten or\ntwenty guineas.\"\n\nI opened my eyes a little at this.\n\n\"Oh, is that the way these things are done?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, how else should they be done?\" he demanded somewhat\nimpatiently--\"Do you think _anything_ in the world is done without\nmoney? Are the poor, hard-working journalists your brothers or your\nbosom friends that they should lift you into public notice without\ngetting something for their trouble? If you do not manage them properly\nin this way, they'll abuse you quite heartily and free of cost,--that I\ncan promise you! I know a 'literary agent,' a very worthy man too, who\nfor a hundred guineas down, will so ply the paragraph wheel that in a\nfew weeks it shall seem to the outside public that Geoffrey Tempest, the\nmillionaire, is the only person worth talking about, and the one\ndesirable creature whom to shake hands with is next in honour to meeting\nRoyalty itself.\"\n\n\"Secure him!\" I said indolently--\"And pay him _two_ hundred guineas! So\nshall all the world hear of me!\"\n\n\"When you have been paragraphed thoroughly,\" went on Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez--\"the next\nmove will be a dash into what is called 'swagger' society. This must be\ndone cautiously and by degrees. You must be presented at the first Lev\u00c3\u00a9e\nof the season, and later on, I will get you an invitation to some great\nlady's house, where you will meet the Prince of Wales privately at\ndinner. If you can oblige or please His Royal Highness in any way so\nmuch the better for you,--he is at least the most popular royalty in\nEurope, so it should not be difficult to you to make yourself agreeable.\nFollowing upon this event, you must purchase a fine country seat, and\nhave _that_ fact 'paragraphed'--then you can rest and look\nround,--Society will have taken you up, and you will find yourself in\nthe swim!\"\n\nI laughed heartily,--well entertained by his fluent discourse.\n\n\"I should not,\" he resumed--\"propose your putting yourself to the\ntrouble of getting into Parliament. That is no longer necessary to the\ncareer of a gentleman. But I should strongly recommend your winning the\nDerby.\"\n\n\"I daresay you would!\" I answered mirthfully--\"It's an admirable\nsuggestion,--but not very easy to follow!\"\n\n\"If you wish to win the Derby,\" he rejoined quietly--\"you _shall_ win\nit. I'll guarantee both horse and jockey!\"\n\nSomething in his decisive tone impressed me, and I leaned forward to\nstudy his features more closely.\n\n\"Are you a worker of miracles?\" I asked him jestingly--\"Do you mean it?\"\n\n\"Try me!\" he responded--\"Shall I enter a horse for you?\"\n\n\"You can't; it's too late,\" I said. \"You would need to be the devil\nhimself to do it. Besides I don't care about racing.\"\n\n\"You will have to amend your taste then,\"--he replied--\"That is, if you\nwant to make yourself agreeable to the English aristocracy, for they are\ninterested in little else. No really great lady is without her betting\nbook, though she may be deficient in her knowledge of spelling. You may\nmake the biggest literary _furore_ of the season, and that will count as\nnothing among 'swagger' people, but if you win the Derby you will be a\nreally famous man. Personally speaking I have a great deal to do with\nracing,--in fact I am devoted to it. I am always present at every great\nrace,--I never miss one; I always bet, and I never lose! And now let me\nproceed with your social plan of action. After winning the Derby you\nwill enter for a yacht race at Cowes, and allow the Prince of Wales to\nbeat you just narrowly. Then you will give a grand dinner, arranged by a\nperfect _chef_,--and you will entertain His Royal Highness to the\nstrains of 'Britannia rules the waves,' which will serve as a pretty\ncompliment. You will allude to the same well-worn song in a graceful\nspeech,--and the probable result of all this will be one, or perhaps two\nRoyal invitations. So far, so good. With the heats of summer you will go\nto Homburg to drink the waters there whether you require them or\nnot,--and in the autumn you will assemble a shooting-party at the\ncountry seat before-mentioned which you will have purchased, and invite\nRoyalty to join you in killing the poor little partridges. Then your\nname in society may be considered as made, and you can marry whatever\nfair lady happens to be in the market!\"\n\n\"Thanks!--much obliged!\" and I gave way to hearty laughter--\"Upon my\nword Lucio, your programme is perfect! It lacks nothing!\"\n\n\"It is the orthodox round of social success,\" said Lucio with admirable\ngravity--\"Intellect and originality have nothing whatever to do with\nit,--only money is needed to perform it all.\"\n\n\"You forget my book\"--I interposed--\"I know there is some intellect in\nthat, and some originality too. Surely that will give me an extra lift\nup the heights of fashionable light and leading.\"\n\n\"I doubt it!\" he answered--\"I very much doubt it. It will be received\nwith a certain amount of favour of course, as a production of a rich man\namusing himself with literature as a sort of whim. But, as I told you\nbefore, genius seldom develops itself under the influence of wealth.\nThen again 'swagger' folks can never get it out of their fuddled heads\nthat Literature belongs to Grub Street. Great poets, great philosophers,\ngreat romancists are always vaguely alluded to by 'swagger' society as\n'those sort of people.' Those sort of people are so 'interesting' say\nthe blue-blooded noodles deprecatingly, excusing themselves as it were\nfor knowing any members of the class literary. You can fancy a 'swagger'\nlady of Elizabeth's time asking a friend--'O do you mind, my dear, if I\nbring one Master William Shakespeare to see you? He writes plays, and\ndoes something or other at the _Globe_ theatre,--in fact I'm afraid he\nacts a little--he's not very well off poor man,--but _these sort of\npeople_ are always so amusing!' Now you, my dear Tempest, are not a\nShakespeare, but your millions will give you a better chance than he\never had in his life-time, as you will not have to sue for patronage, or\npractise a reverence for 'my lord' or 'my lady,'--these exalted\npersonages will be only too delighted to borrow money of you if you will\nlend it.\"\n\n\"I shall not lend,\"--I said.\n\n\"Nor give?\"\n\n\"Nor give.\"\n\nHis keen eyes flashed approval.\n\n\"I am very glad,\" he observed, \"that you are determined not to 'go about\ndoing good' as the canting humbugs say, with your money. You are wise.\nSpend on yourself,--because your very act of spending cannot but benefit\nothers through various channels. Now I pursue a different course. I\nalways help charities, and put my name on subscription-lists,--and I\nnever fail to assist a certain portion of clergy.\"\n\n\"I rather wonder at that--\" I remarked--\"Especially as you tell me you\nare not a Christian.\"\n\n\"Yes,--it does seem strange,--doesn't it?\"--he said with an\nextraordinary accent of what might be termed apologetic derision--\"But\nperhaps you don't look at it in the proper light. Many of the clergy are\ndoing their utmost best to _destroy_ religion,--by cant, by hypocrisy,\nby sensuality, by shams of every description,--and when they seek my\nhelp in this noble work, I give it,--freely!\"\n\nI laughed \"You must have your joke evidently\"--I said, throwing the end\nof my finished cigar into the fire--\"And I see you are fond of\nsatirizing your own good actions. Hullo, what's this?\"\n\nFor at that moment Amiel entered, bearing a telegram for me on a silver\nsalver. I opened it,--it was from my friend the publisher, and ran as\nfollows--\n\n\"Accept book with pleasure. Send manuscript immediately.\"\n\nI showed this to Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez with a kind of triumph. He smiled.\n\n\"Of course! what else did you expect? Only the man should have worded\nhis telegram differently, for I do not suppose he would accept the book\nwith pleasure if he had to lay out his own cash upon it. 'Accept money\nfor publishing book with pleasure' should have been the true message of\nthe wire. Well, what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I shall see about this at once\"--I answered, feeling a thrill of\nsatisfaction that at last the time of vengeance on certain of my enemies\nwas approaching--\"The book must be hurried through the press as quickly\nas possible,--and I shall take a particular pleasure in personally\nattending to all the details concerning it. For the rest of my plans,--\"\n\n\"Leave them to me!\" said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez laying his finely shaped white hand\nwith a masterful pressure on my shoulder; \"Leave them to me!--and be\nsure that before very long I shall have set you aloft like the bear who\nhas successfully reached the bun on the top of a greased pole,--a\nspectacle for the envy of men, and the wonder of angels!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe next three or four weeks flew by in a whirl of excitement, and by\nthe time they were ended I found it hard to recognize myself in the\nindolent, listless, extravagant man of fashion I had so suddenly become.\nSometimes at stray and solitary moments the past turned back upon me\nlike a revolving picture in a glass with a flash of unwelcome\nrecollection, and I saw myself worn and hungry, and shabbily clothed,\nbending over my writing in my dreary lodging, wretched, yet amid all my\nwretchedness receiving curious comfort from my own thoughts which\ncreated beauty out of penury, and love out of loneliness. This creative\nfaculty was now dormant in me,--I did very little, and thought less. But\nI felt certain that this intellectual apathy was but a passing phase,--a\nmental holiday and desirable cessation from brain-work to which I was\ndeservedly entitled after all my sufferings at the hands of poverty and\ndisappointment. My book was nearly through the press,--and perhaps the\nchiefest pleasure of any I now enjoyed was the correction of the proofs\nas they passed under my supervision. Yet even this, the satisfaction of\nauthorship, had its drawback,--and my particular grievance was somewhat\nsingular. I read my own work with gratification of course, for I was not\nbehind my contemporaries in thinking well of myself in all I did,--but\nmy complacent literary egoism was mixed with a good deal of disagreeable\nastonishment and incredulity, because my work, written with enthusiasm\nand feeling, propounded sentiments and inculcated theories which I\npersonally did not believe in. Now, how had this happened, I asked\nmyself? Why had I thus invited the public to accept me at a false\nvaluation? I paused to consider,--and I found the suggestion puzzling.\nHow came I to write the book at all, seeing that it was utterly unlike\nme as I now knew myself? My pen, consciously or unconsciously, had\nwritten down things which my reasoning faculties entirely\nrepudiated,--such as belief in a God,--trust in the eternal\npossibilities of man's diviner progress,--I credited neither of these\ndoctrines. When I imagined such transcendental and foolish dreams I was\npoor,--starving,--and without a friend in the world;--remembering all\nthis, I promptly set down my so-called 'inspiration' to the action of an\nill-nourished brain. Yet there was something subtle in the teaching of\nthe story, and one afternoon when I was revising some of the last proof\nsheets I caught myself thinking that the book was nobler than its\nwriter. This idea smote me with a sudden pang,--I pushed my papers\naside, and walking to the window, looked out. It was raining hard, and\nthe streets were black with mud and slush,--the foot-passengers were\ndrenched and miserable,--the whole prospect was dreary, and the fact\nthat I was a rich man did not in the least lift from my mind the\ndepression that had stolen on me unawares. I was quite alone, for I had\nmy own suite of rooms now in the hotel, not far from those occupied by\nPrince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez; I also had my own servant, a respectable, good sort of\nfellow whom I rather liked because he shared to the full the instinctive\naversion I felt for the prince's man, Amiel. Then I had my own carriage\nand horses with attendant coachman and groom,--so that the prince and I,\nthough the most intimate friends in the world, were able to avoid that\n'familiarity which breeds contempt' by keeping up our own separate\nestablishments. On this particular afternoon I was in a more miserable\nhumour than ever my poverty had brought upon me, yet from a strictly\nreasonable point of view I had nothing to be miserable about. I was in\nfull possession of my fortune,--I enjoyed excellent health, and I had\neverything I wanted, with the added consciousness that if my wants\nincreased I could gratify them easily. The 'paragraph wheel' under\nLucio's management had been worked with such good effect that I had seen\nmyself mentioned in almost every paper in London and the provinces as\nthe 'famous millionaire,'--and for the benefit of the public, who are\nsadly uninstructed on these matters, I may here state as a very plain\nunvarnished truth, that for forty pounds,[1] a well-known 'agency' will\nguarantee the insertion of _any_ paragraph, provided it is not\nlibellous, in no less than four hundred newspapers. The art of 'booming'\nis thus easily explained, and level-headed people will be able to\ncomprehend why it is that a few names of authors are constantly\nmentioned in the press, while others, perhaps more deserving, remain\nignored. Merit counts as nothing in such circumstances,--money wins the\nday. And the persistent paragraphing of my name, together with a\ndescription of my personal appearance and my 'marvellous literary\ngifts,' combined with a deferential and almost awe-struck allusion to\nthe 'millions' which made me so interesting--(the paragraph was written\nout by Lucio and handed for circulation to the 'agency' aforesaid with\n'money down')--all this I say brought upon me two inflictions,--first,\nany amount of invitations to social and artistic functions,--and\nsecondly, a continuous stream of begging-letters. I was compelled to\nemploy a secretary, who occupied a room near my suite, and who was kept\nhard at work all day. Needless to say I refused all appeals for\nmoney;--no one had helped _me_ in my distress, with the exception of my\nold chum 'Boffles,'--no one save he had given me even so much as a word\nof sympathy,--I was resolved now to be as hard and as merciless as I had\nfound my contemporaries. I had a certain grim pleasure in reading\nletters from two or three literary men, asking for work 'as secretary or\ncompanion,' or failing that, for the loan of a little cash to 'tide over\npresent difficulties.' One of these applicants was a journalist on the\nstaff of a well-known paper who had promised to find _me_ work, and who\ninstead of doing so, had, as I afterwards learned, strongly dissuaded\nhis editor from giving me any employment. He never imagined that Tempest\nthe millionaire, and Tempest the literary hack, were one and the same\nperson,--so little do the majority think that wealth can ever fall to\nthe lot of authors! I wrote to him myself however and told him what I\ndeemed it well he should know, adding my sarcastic thanks for his\nfriendly assistance to me in time of need,--and herein I tasted\nsomething of the sharp delight of vengeance. I never heard from him\nagain, and I am pretty sure my letter gave him material not only for\nastonishment but meditation.\n\nYet with all the advantages over both friends and enemies which I now\npossessed I could not honestly say I was happy. I knew I could have\nevery possible enjoyment and amusement the world had to offer,--I knew I\nwas one of the most envied among men, and yet,--as I stood looking out\nof the window at the persistently falling rain, I was conscious of a\nbitterness rather than a sweetness in the full cup of fortune. Many\nthings that I had imagined would give me intense satisfaction had fallen\ncuriously flat. For example, I had flooded the press with the most\ncarefully worded and prominent advertisements of my forthcoming book,\nand when I was poor I had pictured to myself how I should revel in doing\nthis,--now that it was done I cared nothing at all about it. I was\nsimply weary of the sight of my own advertised name. I certainly did\nlook forward with very genuine feeling and expectation to the\npublication of my work when that should be an accomplished fact,--but\nto-day even that idea had lost some of its attractiveness owing to this\nnew and unpleasant impression on my mind that the contents of that book\nwere as utterly the reverse of my own true thoughts as they could well\nbe. A fog began to darken down over the streets in company with the\nrain,--and disgusted with the weather and with myself, I turned away\nfrom the window and settled into an arm-chair by the fire, poking the\ncoal till it blazed, and wondering what I should do to rid my mind of\nthe gloom that threatened to envelop it in as thick a canopy as that of\nthe London fog. A tap came at the door, and in answer to my somewhat\nirritable \"Come in!\" Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez entered.\n\n\"What, all in the dark Tempest!\" he exclaimed cheerfully--\"Why don't you\nlight up?\"\n\n\"The fire's enough,\"--I answered crossly--\"Enough at any rate to think\nby.\"\n\n\"And have you been thinking?\" he inquired laughing--\"Don't do it. It's a\nbad habit. No one thinks now-a-days,--people can't stand it--their heads\nare too frail. Once begin to think and down go the foundations of\nsociety,--besides thinking is always dull work.\"\n\n\"I have found it so,\" I said gloomily--\"Lucio, there is something wrong\nabout me somewhere.\"\n\nHis eyes flashed keen, half-amused inquiry into mine.\n\n\"Wrong? Oh no, surely not! What _can_ there be wrong about you, Tempest?\nAre you not one of the richest men living?\"\n\nI let the satire pass.\n\n\"Listen, my friend,\" I said earnestly--\"You know I have been busy for\nthe last fortnight correcting the proofs of my book for the press,--do\nyou not?\"\n\nHe nodded with a smiling air.\n\n\"Well I have arrived almost at the end of my work and I have come to the\nconclusion that the book is not Me,--it is not a reflex of my feelings\nat all,--and I cannot understand how I came to write it.\"\n\n\"You find it stupid perhaps?\" said Lucio sympathetically.\n\n\"No,\" I answered with a touch of indignation--\"I do not find it stupid.\"\n\n\"Dull then?\"\n\n\"No,--it is not dull.\"\n\n\"Melodramatic?\"\n\n\"No,--not melodramatic.\"\n\n\"Well, my good fellow, if it is not dull or stupid or melodramatic, what\nis it!\" he exclaimed merrily--\"It must be something!\"\n\n\"Yes,--it is this,--it is beyond me altogether.\" And I spoke with some\nbitterness. \"Quite beyond me. I could not write it now,--I wonder I\ncould write it then. Lucio, I daresay I am talking foolishly,--but it\nseems to me I must have been on some higher altitude of thought when I\nwrote the book,--a height from which I have since fallen.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear this,\" he answered, with twinkling eyes--\"From what\nyou say it appears to me you have been guilty of literary sublimity. Oh\nbad, very bad! Nothing can be worse. To write sublimely is a grievous\nsin, and one which critics never forgive. I'm really grieved for you, my\nfriend--I never thought your case was quite so desperate.\"\n\nI laughed in spite of my depression.\n\n\"You are incorrigible, Lucio!\" I said--\"But your cheerfulness is very\ninspiriting. All I wanted to explain to you is this,--that my book\nexpresses a certain tone of thought which purporting to be _mine_, is\nnot _me_,--in short, I, in my present self have no sympathy with it. I\nmust have changed very much since I wrote it.\"\n\n\"Changed? Why yes, I should think so!\" and Lucio laughed heartily--\"The\npossession of five millions is bound to change a man considerably for\nthe better--or worse! But you seem to be worrying yourself most absurdly\nabout nothing. Not one author in many centuries writes from his own\nheart or as he truly feels--when he does, he becomes well-nigh immortal.\nThis planet is too limited to hold more than one Homer, one Plato, one\nShakespeare. Don't distress yourself--you are neither of these three!\nYou belong to the age, Tempest,--it is a decadent ephemeral age, and\nmost things connected with it are decadent and ephemeral. Any era that\nis dominated by the love of money only, has a rotten core within it and\nmust perish. All history tells us so, but no one accepts the lesson of\nhistory. Observe the signs of the time,--Art is made subservient to the\nlove of money--literature, politics and religion the same,--_you_ cannot\nescape from the general disease. The only thing to do is to make the\nbest of it,--no one can reform it--least of all you, who have so much\nof the lucre given to your share.\"\n\nHe paused,--I was silent, watching the bright fire-glow and the dropping\nred cinders.\n\n\"What I am going to say now,\" he proceeded in soft, almost melancholy\naccents--\"will sound ridiculously trite,--still it has the perverse\nprosiness of truth about it. It is this--in order to write with intense\nfeeling, you must first _feel_. Very likely when you wrote this book of\nyours, you were almost a human hedge-hog in the way of feeling. Every\nprickly point of you was erect and responsive to the touch of all\ninfluences, pleasant or the reverse, imaginative or realistic. This is a\ncondition which some people envy and others would rather dispense with.\nNow that you, as a hedge-hog, have no further need for either alarm,\nindignation or self-defence, your prickles are soothed into an agreeable\npassiveness, and you partially cease to feel. That is all. The 'change'\nyou complain of is thus accounted for;--you have nothing to feel\nabout,--hence you cannot comprehend how it was that you ever felt.\"\n\nI was conscious of irritation at the calm conviction of his tone.\n\n\"Do you take me for such a callous creature as all that?\" I\nexclaimed--\"You are mistaken in me, Lucio. I feel most keenly----\"\n\n\"What do you feel?\" he inquired, fixing his eyes steadily upon\nme--\"There are hundreds of starving wretches in this metropolis,--men\nand women on the brink of suicide because they have no hope of anything\nin this world or the next, and no sympathy from their kind--do you feel\nfor them? Do _their_ griefs affect _you_? You know they do not,--you\nknow you never think of them,--why should you? One of the chief\nadvantages of wealth is the ability it gives us to shut out other\npeople's miseries from our personal consideration.\"\n\nI said nothing,--for the first time my spirit chafed at the truth of his\nwords, principally because they _were_ true. Alas, Lucio!--if I had\nonly known then what I know now!\n\n\"Yesterday,\" he went on in the same quiet voice--\"a child was run over\nhere, just opposite this hotel. It was _only_ a poor child,--mark that\n'only.' Its mother ran shrieking out of some back-street hard by, in\ntime to see the little bleeding body carted up in a mangled heap. She\nstruck wildly with both hands at the men who were trying to lead her\naway, and with a cry like that of some hurt savage animal fell face\nforward in the mud--dead. She was only a poor woman,--another 'only.'\nThere were three lines in the paper about it headed 'Sad Incident.' The\nhotel-porter here witnessed the scene from the door with as composed a\ndemeanor as that of a fop at the play, never relaxing the serene majesty\nof his attitude,--but about ten minutes after the dead body of the woman\nhad been carried out of sight, he, the imperial, gold-buttoned being,\nbecame almost crook-backed in his servile haste to run and open the door\nof your brougham, my dear Geoffrey, as you drove up to the entrance.\nThis is a little epitome of life as it is lived now-a-days,--and yet the\ncanting clerics swear we are all equal in the sight of heaven! We may\nbe, though it does not look much like it,--and if we are, it does not\nmatter, as we have ceased to care how heaven regards us. I don't want to\npoint a moral,--I simply tell you the 'sad incident' as it\noccurred,--and I am sure you are not the least sorry for the fate of\neither the child who was run over, or its mother who died in the sharp\nagony of a suddenly broken heart. Now don't say you are, because I know\nyou're not!\"\n\n\"How can one feel sorry for people one does not know or has never\nseen,--\" I began.\n\n\"Exactly!--How is it possible? And there we have it--how can one feel,\nwhen one's self is so thoroughly comfortable as to be without any other\nfeeling save that of material ease? Thus, my dear Geoffrey, you must be\ncontent to let your book appear as the reflex and record of your past\nwhen you were in the prickly or sensitive stage,--now you are encased\nin a pachydermatous covering of gold, which adequately protects you from\nsuch influences as might have made you start and writhe, perhaps even\nroar with indignation, and in the access of fierce torture, stretch out\nyour hands and grasp--quite unconsciously--the winged thing called\nFame!\"\n\n\"You should have been an orator,\"--I said, rising and pacing the room to\nand fro in vexation,--\"But to me your words are not consoling, and I do\nnot think they are true. Fame is easily enough secured.\"\n\n\"Pardon me if I am obstinate;\"--said Lucio with a deprecatory\ngesture--\"Notoriety is easily secured--very easily. A few critics who\nhave dined with you and had their fill of wine, will give you notoriety.\nBut fame is the voice of the whole civilized public of the world.\"\n\n\"The public!\" I echoed contemptuously--\"The public only care for trash.\"\n\n\"It is a pity you should appeal to it then;\"--he responded with a\nsmile--\"If you think so little of the public why give it anything of\nyour brain? It is not worthy of so rare a boon! Come, come Tempest,--do\nnot join in the snarl of unsuccessful authors who take refuge, when\nmarked unsaleable, in pouring out abuse on the public. The public is the\nauthor's best friend and truest critic. But if you prefer to despise it,\nin company with all the very little literature-mongers who form a mutual\nadmiration society, I tell you what to do,--print just twenty copies of\nyour book and present these to the leading reviewers, and when they have\nwritten you up (as they will do--I'll take care of that) let your\npublisher advertise to the effect that the 'First and Second Large\nEditions' of the new novel by Geoffrey Tempest, are exhausted, one\nhundred thousand copies having been sold in a week! If that does not\nwaken up the world in general, I shall be much surprised!\"\n\nI laughed,--I was gradually getting into a better humour.\n\n\"It would be quite as fair a plan of action as is adopted by many modern\npublishers,\" I said--\"The loud hawking of literary wares now-a-days\nreminds me of the rival shouting of costermongers in a low\nneighbourhood. But I will not go quite so far,--I'll win my fame\nlegitimately if I can.\"\n\n\"You can't!\" declared Lucio with a serene smile--\"It's impossible. You\nare too rich. That of itself is not legitimate in Literature, which\ngreat art generally elects to wear poverty in its button-hole as a\nflower of grace. The fight cannot be equal in such circumstances. The\nfact that you are a millionaire must weigh the balance apparently in\nyour favour for a time. The world cannot resist money. If I, for\nexample, became an author, I should probably with my wealth and\ninfluence, burn up every one else's laurels. Suppose that a desperately\npoor man comes out with a book at the same time as you do, he will have\nscarcely the ghost of a chance against you. He will not be able to\nadvertise in your lavish style,--nor will he see his way to dine the\ncritics as you can. And if he should happen to have more genius than\nyou, and you succeed, your success will _not_ be legitimate. But after\nall, that does not matter much--in Art, if in nothing else, things\nalways right themselves.\"\n\nI made no immediate reply, but went over to my table, rolled up my\ncorrected proofs and directed them to the printers,--then ringing the\nbell I gave the packet to my man, Morris, bidding him post it at once.\nThis done, I turned again towards Lucio and saw that he still sat by the\nfire, but that his attitude was now one of brooding melancholy, and that\nhe had covered his eyes with one hand on which the glow from the flames\nshone red. I regretted the momentary irritation I had felt against him\nfor telling me unwelcome truths,--and I touched him lightly on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Are _you_ in the dumps now Lucio?\" I said--\"I'm afraid my depression\nhas proved infectious.\"\n\nHe moved his hand and looked up,--his eyes were large and lustrous as\nthe eyes of a beautiful woman.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" he said, with a slight sigh--\"of the last words I\nuttered just now,--_things always right themselves_. Curiously enough in\nart they always do,--no charlatanism or sham lasts with the gods of\nParnassus. But in other matters it is different. For instance _I_ shall\nnever right myself! Life is hateful to me at times, as it is to\neverybody.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are in love?\" I said with a smile.\n\nHe started up.\n\n\"In love! By all the heavens and all the earths too, that suggestion\nwakes me with a vengeance! In love! What woman alive do you think could\nimpress _me_ with the notion that she was anything more than a frivolous\ndoll of pink and white, with long hair frequently not her own? And as\nfor the tom-boy tennis-players and giantesses of the era, I do not\nconsider them women at all,--they are merely the unnatural and strutting\nembryos of a new sex which will be neither male nor female. My dear\nTempest, I hate women. So would you if you knew as much about them as I\ndo. They have made me what I am, and they keep me so.\"\n\n\"They are to be much complimented then,\"--I observed--\"You do them\ncredit!\"\n\n\"I do!\" he answered slowly--\"In more ways than one!\" A faint smile was\non his face, and his eyes brightened with that curious jewel-like gleam\nI had noticed several times before. \"Believe me, I shall never contest\nwith you such a slight gift as woman's love, Geoffrey. It is not worth\nfighting for. And _apropos_ of women, that reminds me,--I have promised\nto take you to the Earl of Elton's box at the Haymarket to-night,--he is\na poor peer, very gouty and somewhat heavily flavoured with port-wine,\nbut his daughter, Lady Sibyl, is one of the belles of England. She was\npresented last season and created quite a _furore_. Will you come?\"\n\n\"I am quite at your disposition\"--I said, glad of any excuse to escape\nthe dullness of my own company and to be in that of Lucio, whose talk,\neven if its satire galled me occasionally, always fascinated my mind and\nremained in my memory--\"What time shall we meet?\"\n\n\"Go and dress now, and join me at dinner,\"--he answered; \"And we'll\ndrive together to the theatre afterwards. The play is on the usual theme\nwhich has lately become popular with stage-managers,--the glorification\nof a 'fallen' lady, and the exhibition of her as an example of something\nsuperlatively pure and good, to the astonished eyes of the innocent. As\na play it is not worth seeing,--but perhaps Lady Sibyl is.\"\n\nHe smiled again as he stood facing me,--the light flames of the fire had\ndied down to a dull uniform coppery red,--we were almost in darkness,\nand I pressed the small button near the mantelpiece that flooded the\nroom with electric light. His extraordinary beauty then struck me afresh\nas something altogether singular and half unearthly.\n\n\"Don't you find that people look at you very often as you pass, Lucio?\"\nI asked him suddenly and impulsively.\n\nHe laughed. \"Not at all. Why should they? Every man is so intent on his\nown aims, and thinks so much of his own personality that he would\nscarcely forget his _ego_ if the very devil himself were behind him.\nWomen look at me sometimes, with the affected coy and kitten-like\ninterest usually exhibited by the frail sex for a personable man.\"\n\n\"I cannot blame them!\" I answered, my gaze still resting on his stately\nfigure and fine head with as much admiration as I might have felt for a\nnoble picture or statue--\"What of this Lady Sibyl we are to meet\nto-night,--how does she regard you?\"\n\n\"Lady Sibyl has never seen me,\"--he replied--\"And I have only seen her\nat a distance. It is chiefly for the purpose of an introduction to her\nthat the Earl has asked us to his box this evening.\"\n\n\"Ha ha! Matrimony in view!\" I exclaimed jestingly.\n\n\"Yes--I believe Lady Sibyl is for sale,\"--he answered with the callous\ncoldness that occasionally distinguished him and made his handsome\nfeatures look like an impenetrable mask of scorn--\"But up to the present\nthe bids have not been sufficiently high. And I shall not purchase. I\nhave told you already, Tempest, I hate women.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Most seriously. Women have always done me harm,--they have wantonly\nhindered me in my progress. And why I specially abominate them is, that\nthey have been gifted with an enormous power for doing good, and that\nthey let this power run to waste and will not use it. Their deliberate\nenjoyment and choice of the repulsive, vulgar and common-place side of\nlife disgusts me. They are much less sensitive than men, and infinitely\nmore heartless. They are the mothers of the human race, and the faults\nof the race are chiefly due to them. That is another reason for my\nhatred.\"\n\n\"Do you want the human race to be perfect?\" I asked\nastonished--\"Because, if you do, you will find that impossible.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment apparently lost in thought.\n\n\"Everything in the Universe is perfect,\"--he said, \"except that curious\npiece of work--Man. Have you never thought out any reason why he should\nbe the one flaw,--the one incomplete creature in a matchless Creation?\"\n\n\"No, I have not,\"--I replied--\"I take things as I find them.\"\n\n\"So do I,\"--and he turned away, \"And as I find _them_, so they find\n_me_! Au revoir! Dinner in an hour's time remember!\"\n\nThe door opened and closed--he was gone. I remained alone for a little,\nthinking what a strange disposition was his,--what a curious mixture of\nphilosophy, worldliness, sentiment and satire seemed to run like the\nveins of a leaf through the variable temperament of this brilliant,\nsemi-mysterious personage who had by mere chance become my greatest\nfriend. We had now been more or less together for nearly a month, and I\nwas no closer to the secret of his actual nature than I had been at\nfirst. Yet I admired him more than ever,--without his society I felt\nlife would be deprived of half its charm. For though, attracted as human\nmoths will be by the glare of my glittering millions, numbers of\nso-called 'friends' now surrounded me, there was not one among them who\nso dominated my every mood and with whom I had so much close sympathy\nas this man,--this masterful, half cruel, half kind companion of my\ndays, who at times seemed to accept all life as the veriest bagatelle,\nand myself as a part of the trivial game.\n\n\n  [1] A fact.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nNo man, I think, ever forgets the first time he is brought face to face\nwith perfect beauty in woman. He may have caught fleeting glimpses of\nloveliness on many fair faces often,--bright eyes may have flashed on\nhim like star-beams,--the hues of a dazzling complexion may now and then\nhave charmed him, or the seductive outlines of a graceful figure;--all\nthese are as mere peeps into the infinite. But when such vague and\npassing impressions are suddenly drawn together in one focus,--when all\nhis dreamy fancies of form and colour take visible and complete\nmanifestation in one living creature who looks down upon him as it were\nfrom an empyrean of untouched maiden pride and purity, it is more to his\nhonour than his shame, if his senses swoon at the ravishing vision, and\nhe, despite his rough masculinity and brute strength, becomes nothing\nbut the merest slave to passion. In this way was I overwhelmed and\nconquered without any chance of deliverance when Sibyl Elton's violet\neyes, lifted slowly from the shadow of their dark lashes, rested upon me\nwith that indefinable expression of mingled interest and indifference\nwhich is supposed to indicate high breeding, but which more frequently\nintimidates and repulses the frank and sensitive soul. The Lady Sibyl's\nglance repelled, but I was none the less attracted. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez and I had\nentered the Earl of Elton's box at the Haymarket between the first and\nsecond acts of the play, and the Earl himself, an unimpressive,\nbald-headed, red-faced old gentleman, with fuzzy white whiskers, had\nrisen to welcome us, seizing the prince's hand and shaking it with\nparticular effusiveness. (I learned afterwards that Lucio had lent him a\nthousand pounds on easy terms, a fact which partly accounted for the\nfriendly fervour of his greeting.) His daughter had not moved; but a\nminute or two later when he addressed her somewhat sharply, saying\n\"Sibyl! Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez and his friend, Mr Geoffrey Tempest,\" she turned\nher head and honoured us both with the chill glance I have endeavoured\nto describe, and the very faintest possible bow as an acknowledgment of\nour presence. Her exquisite beauty smote me dumb and foolish,--I could\nfind nothing to say, and stood silent and confused, with a strange\nsensation of bewilderment upon me. The old Earl made some remark about\nthe play, which I scarcely heard though I answered vaguely and at\nhap-hazard,--the orchestra was playing abominably as is usual in\ntheatres, and its brazen din sounded like the noise of the sea in my\nears,--I had not much real consciousness of anything save the wondrous\nloveliness of the girl who faced me, clad in pure white, with a few\ndiamonds shining about her like stray dewdrops on a rose. Lucio spoke to\nher, and I listened.\n\n\"At last, Lady Sibyl,\" he said, bending towards her deferentially. \"At\nlast I have the honour of meeting you. I have seen you often, as one\nsees a star,--at a distance.\"\n\nShe smiled,--a smile so slight and cold that it scarcely lifted the\ncorners of her lovely lips.\n\n\"I do not think I have ever seen _you_,\" she replied. \"And yet there is\nsomething oddly familiar in your face. I have heard my father speak of\nyou constantly,--I need scarcely say his friends are always mine.\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"To merely speak to Lady Sibyl Elton is counted sufficient to make the\nman so privileged happy,\" he said. \"To be her friend is to discover the\nlost paradise.\"\n\nShe flushed,--then grew suddenly very pale, and shivering, she drew her\ncloak towards her. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez wrapped its perfumed silken folds carefully\nround her beautiful shoulders,--how I grudged him the dainty task! He\nthen turned to me, and placed a chair just behind hers.\n\n\"Will you sit here Geoffrey?\" he suggested--\"I want to have a moment's\nbusiness chat with Lord Elton.\"\n\nRecovering my self-possession a little, I hastened to take the chance he\nthus generously gave me to ingratiate myself in the young lady's favour,\nand my heart gave a foolish bound of joy because she smiled\nencouragingly as I approached her.\n\n\"You are a great friend of Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez?\" she asked softly, as I sat\ndown.\n\n\"Yes, we are very intimate,\" I replied--\"He is a delightful companion.\"\n\n\"So I should imagine!\" and she looked over at him where he sat next to\nher father talking earnestly in low tones--\"He is singularly handsome.\"\n\nI made no reply. Of course Lucio's extraordinary personal attractiveness\nwas undeniable,--but I rather grudged her praise bestowed on him just\nthen. Her remarks seemed to me as tactless as when a man with one pretty\nwoman beside him loudly admires another in her hearing. I did not myself\nassume to be actually handsome, but I knew I was better looking than the\nordinary run of men. So out of sudden pique I remained silent, and\npresently the curtain rose and the play was resumed. A very questionable\nscene was enacted, the 'woman with the past' being well to the front of\nit. I felt disgusted at the performance and looked at my companions to\nsee if they too were similarly moved. There was no sign of disapproval\non Lady Sibyl's fair countenance,--her father was bending forward\neagerly, apparently gloating over every detail,--Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez wore that\ninscrutable expression of his in which no feeling whatever could be\ndiscerned. The 'woman with the past' went on with her hysterical\nsham-heroics, and the mealy-mouthed fool of a hero declared her to be a\n'pure angel wronged,' and the curtain fell amid loud applause. One\nenergetic hiss came from the gallery, affecting the occupants of the\nstalls to scandalized amazement.\n\n\"England has progressed!\" said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez in soft half-bantering\ntones--\"Once upon a time this play would have been hooted off the stage\nas likely to corrupt the social community. But now the only voice of\nprotest comes from the 'lower' classes.\"\n\n\"Are you a democrat, prince?\" inquired Lady Sibyl, waving her fan\nindolently to and fro.\n\n\"Not I! I always insist on the pride and supremacy of worth,--I do not\nmean money value, but intellect. And in this way I foresee a new\naristocracy. When the High grows corrupt, it falls and becomes the\nLow;--when the Low educates itself and aspires, it becomes the High.\nThis is simply the course of nature.\"\n\n\"But, God bless my soul!\" exclaimed Lord Elton--\"you don't call this\nplay low or immoral do you? It's a realistic study of modern social\nlife--that's what it is. These women you know,--these poor souls with a\npast--are very interesting!\"\n\n\"Very!\" murmured his daughter.--\"In fact it would seem that for women\nwith no such 'past' there can be no future! Virtue and modesty are quite\nout of date, and have no chance whatever.\"\n\nI leaned towards her, half whispering,\n\n\"Lady Sibyl, I am glad to see this wretched play offends you.\"\n\nShe turned her deep eyes on me in mingled surprise and amusement.\n\n\"Oh no, it doesn't,\" she declared--\"I have seen so many like it. And I\nhave read so many novels on just the same theme! I assure you, I am\nquite convinced that the so-called 'bad' woman is the only popular type\nof our sex with men,--she gets all the enjoyment possible out of\nlife,--she frequently makes an excellent marriage, and has, as the\nAmericans say 'a good time all round.' It's the same thing with our\nconvicted criminals,--in prison they are much better fed than the honest\nworking-man. I believe it is quite a mistake for women to be\nrespectable,--they are only considered dull.\"\n\n\"Ah, now you are only joking!\" I said with an indulgent smile. \"You know\nthat in your heart you think very differently!\"\n\nShe made no answer, as just then the curtain went up again, disclosing\nthe unclean 'lady' of the piece, \"having a good time all round\" on board\na luxurious yacht. During the unnatural and stilted dialogue which\nfollowed, I withdrew a little back into the shadow of the box, and all\nthat self-esteem and assurance of which I had been suddenly deprived by\na glance at Lady Sibyl's beauty, came back to me, and a perfectly stolid\ncoolness and composure succeeded to the first feverish excitement of my\nmind. I recalled Lucio's words--\"_I believe Lady Sibyl is for\nsale_\"--and I thought triumphantly of my millions. I glanced at the old\nearl, abjectly pulling at his white whiskers while he listened anxiously\nto what were evidently money schemes propounded by Lucio. Then my gaze\ncame back appraisingly to the lovely curves of Lady Sibyl's milk-white\nthroat, her beautiful arms and bosom, her rich brown hair of the shade\nof a ripe chestnut, her delicate haughty face, languid eyes and\nbrilliant complexion,--and I murmured inwardly--\"All this loveliness is\npurchaseable, and I will purchase it!\" At that very instant she turned\nto me and said--\n\n\"You are the famous Mr Tempest, are you not?\"\n\n\"Famous?\" I echoed with a deep sense of gratification--\"Well,--I am\nscarcely that,--yet! My book is not published ...\"\n\nHer eyebrows arched themselves surprisedly.\n\n\"Your book? I did not know you had written one?\"\n\nMy flattered vanity sank to zero.\n\n\"It has been extensively advertised,\" I began impressively,--but she\ninterrupted me with a laugh.\n\n\"Oh I never read advertisements,--it's too much trouble. When I asked if\nyou were the famous Mr Tempest, I meant to say were you the great\nmillionaire who has been so much talked of lately?\"\n\nI bowed a somewhat chill assent. She looked at me inquisitively over the\nlace edge of her fan.\n\n\"How delightful it must be for you to have so much money!\" she\nsaid--\"And you are young too, and good-looking.\"\n\nPleasure took the place of vexed _amour-propre_ and I smiled.\n\n\"You are very kind, Lady Sibyl!\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked laughing,--such a delicious little low laugh--\"Because\nI tell you the truth? You _are_ young and you _are_ good-looking!\nMillionaires are generally such appalling creatures. Fortune, while\ngiving them money, frequently deprives them of both brains and personal\nattractiveness. And now do tell me about your book!\"\n\nShe seemed to have suddenly dispensed with her former reserve, and\nduring the last act of the play, we conversed freely, in whispers which\nassisted us to become almost confidential. Her manner to me now was full\nof grace and charm, and the fascination she exerted over my senses\nbecame complete. The performance over, we all left the box together, and\nas Lucio was still apparently engrossed with Lord Elton I had the\nsatisfaction of escorting Lady Sibyl to her carriage. When her father\njoined her, Lucio and I both stood together looking in at the window of\nthe brougham, and the Earl, getting hold of my hand shook it up and down\nwith boisterous friendliness.\n\n\"Come and dine,--come and dine!\" he spluttered excitedly; \"Come--let me\nsee,--this is Tuesday--come on Thursday. Short notice and no ceremony!\nMy wife is paralysed I'm sorry to say,--she can't receive,--she can only\nsee a few people now and then when she is in the humour,--her sister\nkeeps house and does the honours,--Aunt Charlotte, eh Sibyl?--ha-ha-ha!\nThe Deceased Wife's Sister's Bill would never be any use to me, for if\nmy wife were to die I shouldn't be anxious to marry Miss Charlotte\nFitzroy! Ha ha ha! A perfectly unapproachable woman sir!--a model,--ha\nha! Come and dine with us, Mr Tempest,--Lucio, you bring him along with\nyou, eh? We've got a young lady staying with us,--an American, dollars,\naccent and all,--and by Jove I believe she wants to marry me ha ha ha!\nand is waiting for Lady Elton to go to a better world first, ha ha! Come\nalong--come and see the little American, eh? Thursday shall it be?\"\n\nOver the fair features of Lady Sibyl there passed a faint shadow of\nannoyance at her father's allusion to the \"little American,\" but she\nsaid nothing. Only her looks appeared to question our intentions as well\nas to persuade our wills, and she seemed satisfied when we both accepted\nthe invitation given. Another apoplectic chuckle from the Earl and a\ncouple of handshakes,--a slight graceful bow from her lovely ladyship,\nas we raised our hats in farewell, and the Elton equipage rolled away,\nleaving us to enter our own vehicle, which amid the officious roarings\nof street-boys and policemen had just managed to draw up in front of the\ntheatre. As we drove off, Lucio peered inquisitively at me--I could see\nthe steely glitter of his fine eyes in the semi-darkness of the\nbrougham,--and said--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Don't you admire her?\" he went on--\"I must confess she is cold,--a very\nchilly vestal indeed,--but snow often covers volcanoes! She has good\nfeatures, and a naturally clear complexion.\"\n\nDespite my intention to be reticent, I could not endure this tame\ndescription.\n\n\"She is perfectly beautiful,\"--I said emphatically. \"The dullest eyes\nmust see that. There is not a fault to be found with her. And she is\nwise to be reserved and cold--were she too lavish of her smiles and too\nseductive in manner, she might drive many men not only into folly, but\nmadness.\"\n\nI felt rather than saw the cat-like glance he flashed upon me.\n\n\"Positively, Geoffrey, I believe that notwithstanding the fact that we\nare only in February, the wind blows upon you due south, bringing with\nit odours of rose and orange-blossom! I fancy Lady Sibyl has powerfully\nimpressed you?\"\n\n\"Did you wish me to be impressed?\" I asked.\n\n\"I? My dear fellow, I wish nothing that you yourself do not wish. I\naccommodate my ways to my friends' humours. If asked for my opinion I\nshould say it is rather a pity if you are really smitten with the young\nlady, as there are no obstacles to be encountered. A love-affair, to be\nconducted with spirit and enterprise should always bristle with\nopposition and difficulty, real or invented. A little secrecy and a good\ndeal of wrong-doing, such as sly assignations and the telling of any\namount of lies--such things add to the agreeableness of love-making on\nthis planet--\"\n\nI interrupted him.\n\n\"See here, Lucio, you are very fond of alluding to 'this' planet as if\nyou knew anything about other planets\"--I said impatiently. \"_This_\nplanet, as you somewhat contemptuously call it, is the only one _we_\nhave any business with.\"\n\nHe bent his piercing looks so ardently upon me that for the moment I was\nstartled.\n\n\"If that is so,\" he answered, \"why in Heaven's name do you not let the\nother planets alone? Why do you strive to fathom their mysteries and\nmovements? If men, as you say, have no business with any planet save\nthis one why are they ever on the alert to discover the secret of\nmightier worlds,--a secret which haply it may some day terrify them to\nknow!\"\n\nThe solemnity of his voice and the inspired expression of his face awed\nme. I had no reply ready, and he went on--\n\n\"Do not let us talk, my friend, of planets, not even of this particular\npin's point among them known as Earth. Let us return to a better\nsubject--the Lady Sibyl. As I have already said, there are no obstacles\nin the way of your wooing and winning her, if such is your desire.\nGeoffrey Tempest, as mere author of books would indeed be insolent to\naspire to the hand of an earl's daughter, but Geoffrey Tempest,\nmillionaire, will be a welcome suitor. Poor Lord Elton's affairs are in\na bad way--he is almost out-at-elbows;--the American woman who is\nboarding with him----\"\n\n\"Boarding with him!\" I exclaimed--\"Surely he does not keep a\nboarding-house?\"\n\nLucio laughed heartily.\n\n\"No, no!--you must not put it so coarsely, Geoffrey. It is simply this,\nthat the Earl and Countess of Elton give the prestige of their home and\nprotection to Miss Diana Chesney (the American aforesaid) for the\ntrifling sum of two thousand guineas per annum. The Countess being\nparalyzed, is obliged to hand over her duties of chaperonage to her\nsister Miss Charlotte Fitzroy,--but the halo of the coronet still hovers\nover Miss Chesney's brow. She has her own suite of rooms in the house,\nand goes wherever it is proper for her to go, under Miss Fitzroy's care.\nLady Sibyl does not like the arrangement, and is therefore never seen\nanywhere except with her father. She will not join in companionship with\nMiss Chesney, and has said so pretty plainly.\"\n\n\"I admire her for it!\" I said warmly--\"I really am surprised that Lord\nElton should condescend----\"\n\n\"Condescend to what?\" inquired Lucio--\"Condescend to take two thousand\nguineas a year? Good heavens man, there are no end of lords and ladies\nwho will readily agree to perform such an act of condescension. 'Blue'\nblood is getting thin and poor, and only money can thicken it. Diana\nChesney is worth over a million dollars and if Lady Elton were to die\nconveniently soon, I should not be surprised to see that 'little\nAmerican' step triumphantly into her vacant place.\"\n\n\"What a state of topsy-turveydom!\" I said, half angrily.\n\n\"Geoffrey, my friend, you are really amazingly inconsistent! Is there a\nmore flagrant example of topsy-turveydom than yourself for instance? Six\nweeks ago, what were you? A mere scribbler, with flutterings of the\nwings of genius in your soul, but many uncertainties as to whether those\nwings would ever be strong enough to lift you out of the rut of\nobscurity in which you floundered, struggling and grumbling at adverse\nfate. Now, as millionaire, you think contemptuously of an Earl, because\nhe ventures quite legitimately to add a little to his income by boarding\nan American heiress and launching her into society where she would never\nget without him. And you aspire, or probably mean to aspire to the hand\nof the Earl's daughter, as if you yourself were a descendant of kings.\nNothing can be more topsy-turvey than _your_ condition!\"\n\n\"My father was a gentleman,\" I said, with a touch of hauteur, \"and a\ndescendant of gentlemen. We were never common folk,--our family was one\nof the most highly esteemed in the counties.\"\n\nLucio smiled.\n\n\"I do not doubt it, my dear fellow,--I do not in the least doubt it. But\na simple 'gentleman' is a long way below--or above--an Earl. Have it\nwhich side you choose!--because it really doesn't matter nowadays. We\nhave come to a period of history when rank and lineage count as nothing\nat all, owing to the profoundly obtuse stupidity of those who happen to\npossess it. So it chances, that as no resistance is made, brewers are\ncreated peers of the realm, and ordinary tradesmen are knighted, and the\nvery old families are so poor that they have to sell their estates and\njewels to the highest bidder, who is frequently a vulgar 'railway-king'\nor the introducer of some new manure. You occupy a better position than\nsuch, since you inherit your money with the farther satisfaction that\nyou do not know how it was made.\"\n\n\"True!\" I answered meditatively,--then, with a sudden flash of\nrecollection I added--\"By the way I never told you that my deceased\nrelative imagined that he had sold his soul to the devil, and that this\nvast fortune of his was the material result!\"\n\nLucio burst into a violent fit of laughter.\n\n\"No! Not possible!\" he exclaimed derisively--\"What an idea! I suppose he\nhad a screw loose somewhere! Imagine any sane man believing in a devil!\nHa, ha, ha! And in these advanced days too! Well, well! The folly of\nhuman imaginations will never end! Here we are!\"--and he sprang lightly\nout as the brougham stopped at the Grand Hotel--\"I will say good-night\nto you, Tempest. I've promised to go and have a gamble.\"\n\n\"A gamble? Where?\"\n\n\"At one of the select private clubs. There are any amount of them in\nthis eminently moral metropolis--no occasion to go to Monte Carlo! Will\nyou come?\"\n\nI hesitated. The fair face of Lady Sibyl haunted my mind,--and I felt,\nwith a no doubt foolish sentimentality, that I would rather keep my\nthoughts of her sacred, and unpolluted by contact with things of lower\ntone.\n\n\"Not to-night;\"--I said,--then half smiling, I added--\"It must be rather\na one-sided affair for other men to gamble with you, Lucio! You can\nafford to lose,--and perhaps they can't.\"\n\n\"If they can't, they shouldn't play,\"--he answered--\"A man should at\nleast know his own mind and his own capacity; if he doesn't, he is no\nman at all. As far as I have learned by long experience, those who\ngamble like it, and when _they_ like it, _I_ like it. I'll take you with\nme to-morrow if you care to see the fun,--one or two very eminent men\nare members of the club, though of course they wouldn't have it known\nfor worlds. You shan't lose much--I'll see to that.\"\n\n\"All right,--to-morrow it shall be!\"--I responded, for I did not wish to\nappear as though I grudged losing a few pounds at play--\"But to-night I\nthink I'll write some letters before going to bed.\"\n\n\"Yes--and dream of Lady Sibyl!\" said Lucio laughing--\"If she fascinates\nyou as much when you see her again on Thursday you had better begin the\nsiege!\"\n\nHe waved his hand gaily, and re-entering his carriage, was driven off at\na furious pace through the drifting fog and rain.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nMy publisher, John Morgeson,--the estimable individual who had first\nrefused my book, and who now, moved by self-interest, was devoting his\nenergies assiduously to the business of launching it in the most modern\nand approved style, was not like Shakespeare's _Cassio_, strictly 'an\nhonourable man.' Neither was he the respectable chief of a\nlong-established firm whose system of the cheating of authors, mellowed\nby time, had become almost sacred;--he was a 'new' man, with new ways,\nand a good stock of new push and impudence. All the same, he was clever,\nshrewd and diplomatic, and for some reason or other, had secured the\nfavour of a certain portion of the press, many of the dailies and\nweeklies always giving special prominence to his publications over the\nheads of other far more legitimately dealing firms. He entered into a\npartial explanation of his methods, when, on the morning after my first\nmeeting with the Earl of Elton and his daughter, I called upon him to\ninquire how things were going with regard to my book.\n\n\"We shall publish next week,\"--he said, rubbing his hands complacently,\nand addressing me with all the deference due to my banking account--\"And\nas you don't mind what you spend, I'll tell you just what I propose to\ndo. I intend to write out a mystifying paragraph of about some seventy\nlines or so, describing the book in a vague sort of way as '_likely to\ncreate a new era of thought_'--or, '_ere long everybody who is anybody\nwill be compelled to read this remarkable work_,'--or '_as something\nthat must be welcome to all who would understand the drift of one of the\nmost delicate and burning questions of the time_.' These are all stock\nphrases, used over and over again by the reviewers,--there's no\ncopyright in them. And the last one always 'tells' wonderfully,\nconsidering how old it is, and how often it has been made to do duty,\nbecause any allusion to a '_delicate and burning question_' makes a\nnumber of people think the novel must be improper, and they send for it\nat once!\"\n\nHe chuckled at his own perspicuity, and I sat silent, studying him with\nmuch inward amusement. This man on whose decision I had humbly and\nanxiously waited not so many weeks ago was now my paid tool,--ready to\nobey me to any possible extent for so much cash,--and I listened to him\nindulgently while he went on unravelling his schemes for the\ngratification of _my_ vanity, and the pocketing of _his_ extras.\n\n\"The book has been splendidly advertised\"--he went on; \"It could not\nhave been more lavishly done. Orders do not come in very fast yet--but\nthey will,--they will. This paragraph of mine, which will take the shape\nof a 'leaderette,' I can get inserted in about eight hundred to a\nthousand newspapers here and in America. It will cost you,--say a\nhundred guineas--perhaps a trifle more. Do you mind that?\"\n\n\"Not in the least!\" I replied, still vastly amused.\n\nHe meditated a moment,--then drew his chair closer to mine and lowered\nhis voice a little.\n\n\"You understand I suppose, that I shall only issue two hundred and fifty\ncopies at first?\"\n\nThis limited number seemed to me absurd, and I protested vehemently.\n\n\"Such an idea is ridiculous!\" I said--\"you cannot supply the trade with\nsuch a scanty edition.\"\n\n\"Wait, my dear sir, wait,--you are too impatient. You do not give me\ntime to explain. All these two hundred and fifty will be _given away_ by\nme in the proper quarters on the day of publication,--never mind\nhow,--they _must_ be given away--\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" and the worthy Morgeson laughed sweetly--\"I see, my dear Mr\nTempest, you are like most men of genius--you do not understand\nbusiness. The reason why we give the first two hundred and fifty copies\naway is in order to be able to announce at once in all the papers that\n'_The First Large Edition of the New Novel by Geoffrey Tempest being\nexhausted on the day of publication, a Second is in Rapid Preparation_.'\nYou see we thus hoodwink the public, who of course are not in our\nsecrets, and are not to know whether an edition is two hundred or two\nthousand. The Second Edition will of course be ready behind the scenes,\nand will consist of another two hundred and fifty.\"\n\n\"Do you call that course of procedure honest?\" I asked quietly.\n\n\"Honest? My dear sir! Honest?\" And his countenance wore a virtuously\ninjured expression--\"Of course it is honest! Look at the daily papers!\nSuch announcements appear every day--in fact they are getting rather too\ncommon. I freely admit that there are a few publishers here and there\nwho stick up for exactitude and go to the trouble of not only giving the\nnumber of copies in an Edition, but also publishing the date of each one\nas it was issued,--this may be principle if they like to call it so, but\nit involves a great deal of precise calculation and worry! If the public\nlike to be deceived, what is the use of being exact! Now, to\nresume,--your second edition will be sent off 'on sale or return' to\nprovincial booksellers, and then we shall announce--\"In consequence of\nthe Enormous Demand for the new novel by Geoffrey Tempest, the Large\nSecond Edition is out of print. A Third will be issued in the course of\nnext week.\" And so on, and so on, till we get to the sixth or seventh\nedition (always numbering two hundred and fifty each) in three volumes;\nperhaps we can by skilful management work it to a tenth. It is only a\nquestion of diplomacy and a little dexterous humbugging of the trade.\nThen we shall arrive at the one-volume issue, which will require\ndifferent handling. But there's time enough for that. The frequent\nadvertisements will add to the expense a bit, but if you don't mind--\"\n\n\"I don't mind anything,\" I said--\"so long as I have my fun.\"\n\n\"Your fun?\" he queried surprisedly--\"I thought it was fame you wanted,\nmore than fun!\"\n\nI laughed aloud.\n\n\"I'm not such a fool as to suppose that fame is secured by\nadvertisement,\" I said--\"For instance I am one of those who think the\nfame of Millais as an artist was marred when he degraded himself to the\nlevel of painting the little green boy blowing bubbles of Pears's Soap.\nThat was an advertisement. And that very incident in his career,\ntrifling though it seems, will prevent his ever standing on the same\ndignified height of distinction with such masters in art as Romney, Sir\nPeter Lely, Gainsborough or Reynolds.\"\n\n\"I believe there is a great deal of justice in what you say;\" and\nMorgeson shook his head wisely--\"Viewed from a purely artistic and\nsentimental standpoint you are right.\" And he became suddenly downcast\nand dubious. \"Yes,--it is a most extraordinary thing how fame does\nescape people sometimes just when they seem on the point of grasping it.\nThey are 'boomed' in every imaginable way, and yet after a time nothing\nwill keep them up. And there are others again who get kicked and\nbuffeted and mocked and derided----\"\n\n\"Like Christ?\" I interposed with a half smile. He looked shocked,--he\nwas a Non-conformist,--but remembering in time how rich I was, he bowed\nwith a meek patience.\n\n\"Yes\"--and he sighed--\"as you suggest, Mr Tempest, like Christ. Mocked\nand derided and opposed at every turn,--and yet by the queerest caprice\nof destiny, they succeed in winning a world-wide fame and power----\"\n\n\"Like Christ again!\" I said mischievously, for I loved to jar his\nnon-conformist conscience.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He paused, looking piously down. Then with a return of\nsecular animation he added--\"But I was not thinking of the Great Example\njust then, Mr Tempest--I was thinking of a woman.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" I said indifferently.\n\n\"Yes--a woman, who despite continued abuse and opposition is rapidly\nbecoming celebrated. You are sure to hear of her in literary and social\ncircles\"--and he gave me a furtive glance of doubtful inquiry--\"but she\nis not rich, you know,--only famous. However,--we have nothing to do\nwith her just now--so let us return to business. The one uncertain point\nin the matter of your book's success is the attitude of the critics.\nThere are only six leading men who do the reviews, and between them they\ncover all the English magazines and some of the American too, as well as\nthe London papers. Here are their names\"--and he handed me a pencilled\nmemorandum,--\"and their addresses, as far as I can ascertain them, or\nthe addresses of the papers for which they most frequently write. The\nman at the head of the list, David McWhing, is the most formidable of\nthe lot. He writes everywhere about everything,--being a Scotchman he's\nbound to have his finger in every pie. If you can secure McWhing, you\nneed not trouble so much about the others, as he generally gives the\n'lead,' and has his own way with the editors. He is one of the 'personal\nfriends' of the editor of the _Nineteenth Century_ for example, and you\nwould be sure to get a notice there, which would otherwise be\nimpossible. No reviewer _can_ review anything for that magazine unless\nhe _is_ one of the editor's friends.[2] You must manage McWhing, or\nhe might, just for the sake of 'showing off,' cut you up rather\nroughly.\"\n\n\"That would not matter,\" I said, diverted at the idea of 'managing\nMcWhing,'--\"A little slating always helps a book to sell.\"\n\n\"In some cases it does,\"--and Morgeson stroked his thin beard\nperplexedly--\"But in others it most emphatically does _not_. Where there\nis any very decided or daring originality, adverse criticism is always\nthe most effective. But a work like yours requires fostering with\nfavour,--wants 'booming' in short----\"\n\n\"I see!\" and I felt distinctly annoyed--\"You don't think my book\noriginal enough to stand alone?\"\n\n\"My dear sir!--you are really--really--! what shall I say?\" and he\nsmiled apologetically--\"a little brusque? I think your book shows\nadmirable scholarship and delicacy of thought,--if I find fault with it\nat all, it is perhaps because I am dense. The only thing it lacks in my\nopinion is what I should call _tenaciousness_, for want of a better\nexpression,--the quality of holding the reader's fancy fixed like a\nnail. But after all this is a common failing of modern literature; few\nauthors feel sufficiently themselves to make others feel.\"\n\nI made no reply for a moment. I was thinking of Lucio's remarks on this\nvery same subject.\n\n\"Well!\" I said at last--\"If I had no feeling when I wrote the book, I\ncertainly have none now. Why man, I felt every line of it!--painfully\nand intensely!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay indeed!\" said Morgeson soothingly--\"Or perhaps you _thought_ you\nfelt, which is another very curious phase of the literary temperament.\nYou see, to convince people at all, you must first yourself be\nconvinced. The result of this is generally a singular magnetic\nattraction between author and public. However I am a bad hand at\nargument,--and it is possible that in hasty reading I may have gathered\na wrong impression of your intentions. Anyhow the book shall be a\nsuccess if we can make it so. All I venture to ask of you is that you\nshould personally endeavour to manage McWhing!\"\n\nI promised to do my best, and on this understanding we parted. I\nrealised that Morgeson was capable of greater discernment than I had\nimagined, and his observations had given me material for thought which\nwas not altogether agreeable. For if my book, as he said, lacked\ntenacity, why then it would not take root in the public mind,--it would\nbe merely the ephemeral success of a season,--one of those brief 'booms'\nin literary wares for which I had such unmitigated contempt,--and Fame\nwould be as far off as ever, except that spurious imitation of it which\nthe fact of my millions had secured. I was in no good humour that\nafternoon, and Lucio saw it. He soon elicited the sum and substance of\nmy interview with Morgeson, and laughed long and somewhat uproariously\nover the proposed 'managing' of the redoubtable McWhing. He glanced at\nthe five names of the other leading critics and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Morgeson is quite right,\"--he said--\"McWhing is intimate with the rest\nof these fellows--they meet at the same clubs, dine at the same cheap\nrestaurants and make love to the same painted ballet-girls. All in a\ncomfortable little fraternal union together, and one obliges the other\non their several journals when occasion offers. Oh yes! I should make up\nto McWhing if I were you.\"\n\n\"But how?\" I demanded, for though I knew McWhing's name well enough\nhaving seen it signed _ad nauseam_ to literary articles in almost every\npaper extant, I had never met the man; \"I cannot ask any favour of a\npress critic.\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" and Lucio laughed heartily again--\"If you were to do\nsuch an idiotic thing what a slating you'd get for your pains! There's\nno sport a critic loves so much as the flaying of an author who has made\nthe mistake of lowering himself to the level of asking favours of his\nintellectual inferiors! No, no, my dear fellow!--we shall manage McWhing\nquite differently,--_I_ know him, though you do not.\"\n\n\"Come, that's good news!\" I exclaimed--\"Upon my word Lucio, you seem to\nknow everybody.\"\n\n\"I think I know most people worth knowing--\" responded Lucio\nquietly--\"Though I by no means include Mr McWhing in the category of\nworthiness. I happened to make his personal acquaintance in a somewhat\nsingular and exciting manner. It was in Switzerland, on that awkward\nledge of rock known as the Mauvais Pas. I had been some weeks in the\nneighbourhood on business of my own, and being surefooted and fearless,\nwas frequently allowed by the guides to volunteer my services with\ntheirs. In this capacity of amateur guide, capricious destiny gave me\nthe pleasure of escorting the timid and bilious McWhing across the\nchasms of the Mer de Glace, and I conversed with him in the choicest\nFrench all the while, a language of which, despite his boasted\nerudition, he was deplorably ignorant. I knew who he was I must tell\nyou, as I know most of his craft, and had long been aware of him as one\nof the authorised murderers of aspiring genius. When I got him on the\nMauvais Pas, I saw that he was seized with vertigo; I held him firmly by\nthe arm and addressed him in sound strong English thus--'Mr McWhing, you\nwrote a damnable and scurrilous article against the work of a certain\npoet' and I named the man--'an article that was a tissue of lies from\nbeginning to end, and which by its cruelty and venom embittered a life\nof brilliant promise, and crushed a noble spirit. Now, unless you\npromise to write and publish in a leading magazine a total recantation\nof this your crime when you get back to England,--_if_ you get\nback!--giving that wronged man the 'honourable mention' he rightly\ndeserves,--down you go! I have but to loosen my hold!' Geoffrey, you\nshould have seen McWhing then! He whined, he wriggled, he clung! Never\nwas an oracle of the press in such an unoracular condition.\n'Murder!--murder!' he gasped, but his voice failed him. Above him\ntowered the snow peaks like the summits of that Fame he could not reach\nand therefore grudged to others,--below him the glittering ice-waves\nyawned in deep transparent hollows of opaline blue and green,--and afar\noff the tinkling cowbells echoed through the still air, suggestive of\nsafe green pastures and happy homes. 'Murder!' he whispered gurglingly.\n'Nay!' said I, ''tis I should cry Murder!--for if ever an arresting hand\nheld a murderer, mine holds one now! Your system of slaying is worse\nthan that of the midnight assassin, for the assassin can but kill the\nbody,--_you_ strive to kill the soul. You cannot succeed, 'tis true, but\nthe mere attempt is devilish. No shouts, no struggles will serve you\nhere,--we are alone with Eternal Nature,--give the man you have\nslandered his tardy recognition, or else, as I said before--down you\ngo!' Well, to make my story short, he yielded, and swore to do as I bade\nhim,--whereupon placing my arm round him as though he were my tender\ntwin-brother, I led him safely off the Mauvais Pas and down the kindlier\nhill, where, what with the fright and the remains of vertigo, he fell\na'weeping grievously. Would you believe it, that before we reached\nChamounix we had become the best friends in the world? He explained\nhimself and his rascally modes of action, and I nobly exonerated\nhim,--we exchanged cards,--and when we parted, this same author's\nbug-bear McWhing, overcome with sentiment and whisky toddy (he is a\nScotchman you know) swore that I was the grandest fellow in the world,\nand that if ever he could serve me he would. He knew my princely title\nby this time, but he would have given me a still higher name. 'You are\nnot--_hic_--a poet yourself?' he murmured, leaning on me fondly as he\nrolled to bed. I told him no. 'I am sorry--very!' he declared, the tears\nof whisky rising to his eyes, 'If you had been I would have done a great\nthing for you,--I would have boomed you,--_for nothing_!' I left him\nsnoring nobly, and saw him no more. But I think he'll recognize me,\nGeoffrey;--I'll go and look him up personally. By all the gods!--if he\nhad only known Who held him between life and death upon the Mauvais\nPas!\"\n\nI stared, puzzled.\n\n\"But he did know\"--I said--\"Did you not say you exchanged cards?\"\n\n\"True, but that was afterwards!\" and Lucio laughed; \"I assure you, my\ndear fellow, we can 'manage' McWhing!\"\n\nI was intensely interested in the story as he told it,--he had such a\ndramatic way of speaking and looking, while his very gestures brought\nthe whole scene vividly before me like a picture. I spoke out my thought\nimpulsively.\n\n\"You would certainly have made a superb actor, Lucio!\"\n\n\"How do you know I am not one?\" he asked with a flashing glance, then he\nadded quickly--\"No,--there is no occasion to paint the face and prance\nover the boards before a row of tawdry footlights like the paid mimes,\nin order to be histrionically great. The finest actor is he who can play\nthe comedy of life perfectly, as I aspire to do. To walk well, talk\nwell, smile well, weep well, groan well, laugh well--and die well!--it\nis all pure acting,--because in every man there is the dumb dreadful\nimmortal Spirit who is real,--who cannot act,--who Is,--and who steadily\nmaintains an infinite though speechless protest against the body's Lie!\"\n\nI said nothing in answer to this outburst,--I was beginning to be used\nto his shifting humours and strange utterances,--they increased the\nmysterious attraction I had for him, and made his character a perpetual\nriddle to me which was not without its subtle charm. Every now and then\nI realized, with a faintly startled sense of self-abasement, that I was\ncompletely under his dominance,--that my life was being entirely guided\nby his control and suggestion,--but I argued with myself that surely it\nwas well it should be so, seeing he had so much more experience and\ninfluence than I. We dined together that night as we often did, and our\nconversation was entirely taken up with monetary and business concerns.\nUnder Lucio's advice I was making several important investments, and\nthese matters gave us ample subject for discussion. At about eleven\no'clock, it being a fine frosty evening and fit for brisk walking, we\nwent out, our destination being the private gambling club to which my\ncompanion had volunteered to introduce me as a guest. It was situated at\nthe end of a mysterious little back street, not far from the respectable\nprecincts of Pall-Mall, and was an unpretentious looking house enough\noutside, but within, it was sumptuously though tastelessly furnished.\nApparently, the premises were presided over by a woman,--a woman with\npainted eyes and dyed hair who received us first of all within the\nlamp-lighted splendours of an Anglo-Japanese drawing-room. Her looks and\nmanner undisguisedly proclaimed her as a _demi-mondaine_ of the most\npronounced type,--one of those 'pure' ladies with a 'past' who are\nrepresented as such martyrs to the vices of men. Lucio said something to\nher apart,--whereupon she glanced at me deferentially and smiled,--then\nrang the bell. A discreet looking man-servant in sober black made his\nappearance, and at a slight sign from his mistress who bowed to me as I\npassed her, proceeded to show us upstairs. We trod on a carpet of the\nsoftest felt,--in fact I noticed that everything was rendered as\nnoiseless as possible in this establishment, the very doors being\ncovered with thick baize and swinging on silent hinges. On the upper\nlanding, the servant knocked very cautiously at a side-door,--a key\nturned in the lock, and we were admitted into a long double room, very\nbrilliantly lit with electric lamps, which at a first glance seemed\ncrowded with men playing at _rouge et noir_ and _baccarat_. Some looked\nup as Lucio entered and nodded smilingly,--others glanced inquisitively\nat me, but our entrance was otherwise scarcely noticed. Lucio drawing me\nalong by the arm, sat down to watch the play,--I followed his example\nand presently found myself infected by the intense excitement which\npermeated the room like the silent tension of the air before a\nthunderstorm. I recognised the faces of many well known public men,--men\neminent in politics and society whom one would never have imagined\ncapable of supporting a gambling club by their presence and authority.\nBut I took care to betray no sign of surprise, and quietly observed the\ngames and the gamesters with almost as impassive a demeanour as that of\nmy companion. I was prepared to play and to lose,--I was not prepared\nhowever for the strange scene which was soon to occur and in which I, by\nforce of circumstances was compelled to take a leading part.\n\n\n  [2] The author has Mr Knowles's own written authority for this fact.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nAs soon as the immediate game we were watching was finished, the players\nrose, and greeted Lucio with a good deal of eagerness and effusion. I\ninstinctively guessed from their manner that they looked upon him as an\ninfluential member of the club, a person likely to lend them money to\ngamble with, and otherwise to oblige them in various ways, financially\nspeaking. He introduced me to them all, and I was not slow to perceive\nthe effect my name had upon most of them. I was asked if I would join in\na game of baccarat, and I readily consented. The stakes were ruinously\nhigh, but I had no need to falter for that. One of the players near me\nwas a fair-haired young man, handsome in face and of aristocratic\nbearing,--he had been introduced to me as Viscount Lynton. I noticed him\nparticularly on account of the reckless way he had of doubling his\nstakes suddenly and apparently out of mere bravado, and when he lost, as\nhe mostly did, he laughed uproariously as though he were drunk or\ndelirious. On first beginning to play I was entirely indifferent as to\nthe results of the game, caring nothing at all as to whether I had\nlosses or gains. Lucio did not join us, but sat apart, quietly\nobservant, and watching me, so I fancied, more than anyone. And as\nchance would have it, all the luck came my way, and I won steadily. The\nmore I won the more excited I became, till presently my humour changed\nand I was seized by a whimsical desire to lose. I suppose it was the\ntouch of some better impulse in my nature that made me wish this for\nyoung Lynton's sake. For he seemed literally maddened by my constant\nwinnings, and continued his foolhardy and desperate play,--his young\nface grew drawn and sharply thin, and his eyes glittered with a hungry\nfeverishness. The other gamesters, though sharing in his run of\nill-luck, seemed better able to stand it, or perhaps they concealed\ntheir feelings more cleverly,--anyhow I know I caught myself very\nearnestly wishing that this devil's luck of mine would desert me and set\nin the young Viscount's direction. But my wishes were no use,--again and\nagain I gathered up the stakes, till at last the players rose, Viscount\nLynton among them.\n\n\"Well, I'm cleaned out!\" he said, with a loud forced laugh. \"You must\ngive me my chance of a _revanche_ to-morrow, Mr Tempest!\"\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"With pleasure!\"\n\nHe called a waiter at the end of the room to bring him a brandy and\nsoda, and meanwhile I was surrounded by the rest of the men, all of them\nrepeating the Viscount's suggestion of a 'revanche,' and strenuously\nurging upon me the necessity of returning to the club the next night in\norder to give them an opportunity of winning back what they had lost. I\nreadily agreed, and while we were in the midst of talk, Lucio suddenly\naddressed young Lynton.\n\n\"Will you make up another game with me?\" he inquired. \"I'll start the\nbank with this,\"--and he placed two crisp notes of five hundred pounds\neach on the table.\n\nThere was a moment's silence. The Viscount was thirstily drinking his\nbrandy-and-soda, and glanced over the rim of his tall tumbler at the\nnotes with covetous bloodshot eyes,--then he shrugged his shoulders\nindifferently. \"I can't stake anything,\" he said; \"I've already told you\nI'm cleaned out,--'stony-broke,' as the slang goes. It's no use my\njoining.\"\n\n\"Sit down, sit down, Lynton!\" urged one man near him. \"I'll lend you\nenough to go on with.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I'd rather not!\" he returned, flushing a little. \"I'm too much\nin your debt already. Awfully good of you all the same. You go on, you\nfellows, and I'll watch the play.\"\n\n\"Let me persuade you Viscount Lynton,\" said Lucio, looking at him with\nhis dazzling inscrutable smile--\"just for the fun of the thing! If you\ndo not feel justified in staking money, stake something trifling and\nmerely nominal, for the sake of seeing whether the luck will turn\"--and\nhere he took up a counter--\"This frequently represents fifty\npounds,--let it represent for once something that is not valuable like\nmoney,--your soul, for example!\" A burst of laughter broke from all the\nmen. Lucio laughed softly with them.\n\n\"We all have, I hope, enough instruction in modern science to be aware\nthat there is no such thing as a soul in existence\"--he continued.\n\"Therefore, in proposing it as a stake for this game at baccarat, I\nreally propose less than one hair of your head, because the hair is a\nsomething, and the soul is a nothing! Come! Will you risk that\nnon-existent quantity for the chance of winning a thousand pounds?\"\n\nThe Viscount drained off the last drop of brandy, and turned upon us,\nhis eyes flushing mingled derision and defiance.\n\n\"Done!\" he exclaimed; whereupon the party sat down.\n\nThe game was brief,--and in its rapid excitement, almost breathless. Six\nor seven minutes sufficed, and Lucio rose, the winner. He smiled as he\npointed to the counter which had represented Viscount Lynton's last\nstake.\n\n\"I have won!\" he said quietly. \"But you owe me nothing, my dear\nViscount, inasmuch as you risked--Nothing! We played this game simply\nfor fun. If souls had any existence of course I should claim yours;--I\nwonder what I should do with it by the way!\" He laughed good-humouredly.\n\"What nonsense, isn't it!--and how thankful we ought to be that we live\nin advanced days like the present, when such silly superstitions are\nbeing swept aside by the march of progress and pure Reason! Good-night!\nTempest and I will give you, your full revenge to-morrow,--the luck is\nsure to change by then, and you will probably have the victory.\nAgain--good-night!\"\n\nHe held out his hand,--there was a peculiar melting tenderness in his\nbrilliant dark eyes,--an impressive kindness in his manner. Something--I\ncould not tell what--held us all for the moment spellbound as if by\nenchantment, and several of the players at other tables, hearing of the\neccentric stake that had been wagered and lost, looked over at us\ncuriously from a distance. Viscount Lynton, however, professed himself\nimmensely diverted, and shook Lucio's proffered hand heartily.\n\n\"You are an awfully good fellow!\" he said, speaking a little thickly and\nhurriedly--\"And I assure you seriously if I had a soul I should be very\nglad to part with it for a thousand pounds at the present moment. The\nsoul wouldn't be an atom of use to me and the thousand pounds would. But\nI feel convinced I shall win to-morrow!\"\n\n\"I am equally sure you will!\" returned Lucio affably, \"In the meantime,\nyou will not find my friend here, Geoffrey Tempest, a hard creditor,--he\ncan afford to wait. But in the case of the lost soul,\"--here he paused,\nlooking straight into the young man's eyes,--\"of course _I_ cannot\nafford to wait!\"\n\nThe Viscount smiled vaguely at this pleasantry, and almost immediately\nafterwards left the club. As soon as the door had closed behind him,\nseveral of the gamesters exchanged sententious nods and glances.\n\n\"Ruined!\" said one of them in a _sotto-voce_.\n\n\"His gambling debts are more than he can ever pay\"--added another--\"And\nI hear he has lost a clear fifty thousand on the turf.\"\n\nThese remarks were made indifferently, as though one should talk of the\nweather,--no sympathy was expressed,--no pity wasted. Every gambler\nthere was selfish to the core, and as I studied their hardened faces, a\nthrill of honest indignation moved me,--indignation mingled with shame.\nI was not yet altogether callous or cruel-hearted, though as I look\nback upon those days which now resemble a wild vision rather than a\nreality, I know that I was becoming more and more of a brutal egoist\nwith every hour I lived. Still I was so far then from being utterly\nvile, that I inwardly resolved to write to Viscount Lynton that very\nevening, and tell him to consider his debt to me cancelled, as I should\nrefuse to claim it. While this thought was passing through my mind, I\nmet Lucio's gaze fixed steadily upon me. He smiled,--and presently\nsigned to me to accompany him. In a few minutes we had left the club,\nand were out in the cold night air under a heaven of frostily sparkling\nstars. Standing still for a moment, my companion laid his hand on my\nshoulder.\n\n\"Tempest, if you are going to be kind-hearted or sympathetic to\nundeserving rascals, I shall have to part company with you!\" he said,\nwith a curious mixture of satire and seriousness in his voice--\"I see by\nthe expression of your face that you are meditating some silly\ndisinterested action of pure generosity. Now you might just as well flop\ndown on these paving stones and begin saying prayers in public. You want\nto let Lynton off his debt,--you are a fool for your pains. He is a born\nscoundrel,--and has never seen his way to being anything else,--why\nshould you compassionate him? From the time he first went to college\ntill now, he has been doing nothing but live a life of degraded\nsensuality,--he is a worthless rake, less to be respected than an honest\ndog!\"\n\n\"Yet some one loves him I daresay!\" I said.\n\n\"Some one loves him!\" echoed Lucio with inimitable disdain--\"Bah! Three\nballet girls live on him if that is what you mean. His mother loved\nhim,--but she is dead,--he broke her heart. He is no good I tell\nyou,--let him pay his debt in full, even to the soul he staked so\nlightly. If I were the devil now, and had just won the strange game we\nplayed to-night, I suppose according to priestly tradition, I should be\npiling up the fire for Lynton in high glee,--but being what I am, I say\nlet the man alone to make his own destiny,--let things take their\ncourse,--and as he chose to risk everything, so let him pay\neverything.\"\n\nWe were by this time walking slowly into Pall Mall,--I was on the point\nof making some reply, when catching sight of a man's figure on the\nopposite side of the way, not far from the Marlborough Club, I uttered\nan involuntary exclamation.\n\n\"Why there he is!\" I said--\"there is Viscount Lynton!\"\n\nLucio's hand closed tightly on my arm.\n\n\"You don't want to speak to him now, surely!\"\n\n\"No. But I wonder where he's going? He walks rather unsteadily.\"\n\n\"Drunk, most probably!\"\n\nAnd Lucio's face presented the same relentless expression of scorn I had\nso often seen and marvelled at.\n\nWe paused a moment, watching the Viscount strolling aimlessly up and\ndown in front of the clubs,--till all at once he seemed to come to a\nsudden resolution, and stopping short, he shouted,\n\n\"Hansom!\"\n\nA silent-wheeled smart vehicle came bowling up immediately. Giving some\norder to the driver, he jumped in. The cab approached swiftly in our\ndirection,--just as it passed us the loud report of a pistol crashed on\nthe silence.\n\n\"Good God!\" I cried reeling back a step or two--\"He has shot himself!\"\n\nThe hansom stopped,--the driver sprang down,--club-porters, waiters,\npolicemen and no end of people starting up from Heaven knows where, were\non the scene on an instant,--I rushed forward to join the rapidly\ngathering throng, but before I could do so, Lucio's strong arm was\nthrown round me, and he dragged me by main force away.\n\n\"Keep cool, Geoffrey!\" he said--\"Do you want to be called up to\nidentify? And betray the club and all its members? Not while I am here\nto prevent you! Check your mad impulses, my good fellow,--they will lead\nyou into no end of difficulties. If the man's dead he's dead, and\nthere's an end of it.\"\n\n\"Lucio! You have no heart!\" I exclaimed, struggling violently to escape\nfrom his hold--\"How can you stop to reason in such a case! Think of it!\n_I_ am the cause of all the mischief!--it is my cursed luck at baccarat\nthis evening that has been the final blow to the wretched young fellow's\nfortunes,--I am convinced of it!--I shall never forgive myself--\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Geoffrey, your conscience is very tender!\" he answered,\nholding my arm still more closely and hurrying me away despite\nmyself--\"You must try and toughen it a little if you want to be\nsuccessful in life. Your 'cursed luck' you think, has caused Lynton's\ndeath? Surely it is a contradiction in terms to call luck 'cursed,'--and\nas for the Viscount, he did not need that last game at baccarat to\nemphasise his ruin. You are not to blame. And for the sake of the club,\nif for nothing else, I do not intend either you or myself to be mixed up\nin a case of suicide. The coroner's verdict always disposes of these\nincidents comfortably in two words--'Temporary insanity.'\"\n\nI shuddered. My soul sickened as I thought that within a few yards of us\nwas the bleeding corpse of the man I had so lately seen alive and spoken\nwith,--and notwithstanding Lucio's words I felt as if I had murdered\nhim.\n\n\"'Temporary insanity'\"--repeated Lucio again, as if speaking to\nhimself--\"all remorse, despair, outraged honour, wasted love, together\nwith the scientific modern theory of Reasonable Nothingness--Life a\nNothing, God a Nothing,--when these drive the distracted human unit to\nmake of himself also a nothing, 'temporary insanity' covers up his\nplunge into the infinite with an untruthful pleasantness. However, after\nall, it is as Shakespeare says, a mad world!\"\n\nI made no answer. I was too overcome by my own miserable sensations. I\nwalked along almost unconscious of movement, and as I stared\nbewilderedly up at the stars they danced before my sight like fireflies\nwhirling in a mist of miasma. Presently a faint hope occurred to me.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"he has not really killed himself? It may be only an\nattempt?\"\n\n\"He was a capital shot\"--returned Lucio composedly,--\"That was his one\nquality. He has no principles,--but he was a good marksman. I cannot\nimagine his missing aim.\"\n\n\"It is horrible! An hour ago alive, ... and now ... I tell you, Lucio,\nit is horrible!\"\n\n\"What is? Death? It is not half so horrible as Life lived wrongly,\"--he\nresponded, with a gravity that impressed me in spite of my emotion and\nexcitement--\"Believe me, the mental sickness and confusion of a wilfully\ndegraded existence are worse tortures than are contained in the priestly\nnotions of Hell. Come come, Geoffrey, you take this matter too much to\nheart,--you are not to blame. If Lynton has given himself the 'happy\ndispatch' it is really the best thing he could do,--he was of no use to\nanybody, and he is well out of it. It is positively weak of you to\nattach importance to such a trifle. You are only at the beginning of\nyour career----\"\n\n\"Well, I hope that career will not lead me into any more such tragedies\nas the one enacted to-night,\"--I said passionately--\"If it does, it will\nbe entirely against my will!\"\n\nLucio looked at me curiously.\n\n\"Nothing can happen to you against your will\"--he replied; \"I suppose\nyou wish to imply that I am to blame for introducing you to the club? My\ngood fellow, you need not have gone there unless you had chosen to do\nso! I did not bind and drag you there! You are upset and unnerved,--come\ninto my room and take a glass of wine,--you will feel more of a man\nafterwards.\"\n\nWe had by this time reached the hotel, and I went with him passively.\nWith equal passiveness I drank what he gave me, and stood, glass in\nhand, watching him with a kind of morbid fascination as he threw off his\nfur-lined overcoat and confronted me, his pale handsome face strangely\nset and stern, and his dark eyes glittering like cold steel.\n\n\"That last stake of Lynton's, ... to you--\" I said falteringly--\"His\nsoul----\"\n\n\"Which _he_ did not believe in, and which _you_ do not believe in!\"\nreturned Lucio, regarding me fixedly. \"Why do you now seem to tremble at\na mere sentimental idea? If fantastic notions such as God, the Soul, and\nthe Devil were real facts, there would perhaps be cause for trembling,\nbut being only the brainsick imaginations of superstitious mankind,\nthere is nothing in them to awaken the slightest anxiety or fear.\"\n\n\"But you\"--I began--\"you say you believe in the soul?\"\n\n\"I? I am brainsick!\" and he laughed bitterly--\"Have you not found that\nout yet? Much learning hath driven me mad, my friend! Science has led me\ninto such deep wells of dark discovery, that it is no wonder if my\nsenses sometimes reel,--and I believe--at such insane moments--in the\nSoul!\"\n\nI sighed heavily.\n\n\"I think I will go to bed,\" I answered. \"I am tired out,--and absolutely\nmiserable!\"\n\n\"Alas, poor millionaire!\" said Lucio gently,--\"I am sorry, I assure you,\nthat the evening has ended so disastrously.\"\n\n\"So am I!\" I returned despondently.\n\n\"Imagine it!\" he went on, dreamily regarding me--\"If my beliefs,--my\ncrack-brained theories,--were worth anything,--which they are not--I\ncould claim the only positive existing part of our late acquaintance\nViscount Lynton! But,--where and how to send in my account with him? If\nI were Satan now....\"\n\nI forced a faint smile.\n\n\"You would have cause to rejoice!\" I said.\n\nHe moved two paces towards me, and laid his hands gently on my\nshoulders.\n\n\"No, Geoffrey\"--and his rich voice had a strange soft music in it--\"No,\nmy friend! If I were Satan I should probably lament!--for every lost\nsoul would of necessity remind me of my own fall, my own despair,--and\nset another bar between myself and heaven! Remember,--the very Devil\nwas an Angel once!\"\n\nHis eyes smiled, and yet I could have sworn there were tears in them. I\nwrung his hand hard,--I felt that notwithstanding his assumed coldness\nand cynicism, the fate of young Lynton had affected him profoundly. My\nliking for him gained new fervour from this impression, and I went to\nbed more at ease with myself and things in general. During the few\nminutes I spent in undressing I became even able to contemplate the\ntragedy of the evening with less regret and greater calmness,--for it\nwas certainly no use worrying over the irrevocable,--and, after all,\nwhat interest had the Viscount's life for me? None. I began to ridicule\nmyself for my own weakness and disinterested emotion,--and presently,\nbeing thoroughly fatigued, fell sound asleep. Towards morning however,\nperhaps about four or five o'clock, I woke suddenly as though touched by\nan invisible hand. I was shivering violently, and my body was bathed in\na cold perspiration. In the otherwise dark room there was something\nstrangely luminous, like a cloud of white smoke or fire. I started up,\nrubbing my eyes,--and stared before me for a moment, doubting the\nevidence of my own senses. For, plainly visible and substantially\ndistinct, at a distance of perhaps five paces from my bed, stood three\nFigures, muffled in dark garments and closely hooded. So solemnly inert\nthey were,--so heavily did their sable draperies fall about them that it\nwas impossible to tell whether they were men or women,--but what\nparalysed me with amazement and terror was the strange light that played\naround and above them,--the spectral, wandering, chill radiance that\nillumined them like the rays of a faint wintry moon. I strove to cry\nout,--but my tongue refused to obey me--and my voice was strangled in my\nthroat. The Three remained absolutely motionless,--and again I rubbed my\neyes, wondering if this were a dream or some hideous optical delusion.\nTrembling in every limb, I stretched my hand towards the bell intending\nto ring violently for assistance,--when--a Voice, low and thrilling with\nintense anguish, caused me to shrink back appalled, and my arm fell\nnerveless at my side. \"_Misery!_\"\n\nThe word struck the air with a harsh reproachful clang, and I nearly\nswooned with the horror of it. For now one of the Figures moved, and a\nface gleamed out from beneath its hooded wrappings--a face white as\nwhitest marble and fixed into such an expression of dreadful despair as\nfroze my blood. Then came a deep sigh that was more like a death-groan,\nand again the word, \"_Misery!_\" shuddered upon the silence.\n\nMad with fear, and scarcely knowing what I did, I sprang from the bed,\nand began desperately to advance upon these fantastic masqueraders,\ndetermined to seize them and demand the meaning of this practical and\nuntimely jest,--when suddenly all Three lifted their heads and turned\ntheir faces on me,--such faces!--indescribably awful in their pallid\nagony,--and a whisper more ghastly than a shriek, penetrated the very\nfibres of my consciousness--\"_Misery!_\"\n\nWith a furious bound I flung myself upon them,--my hands struck _empty\nspace_. Yet there--distinct as ever--they stood, glowering down upon me,\nwhile my clenched fists beat impotently _through_ and _beyond_ their\nseemingly corporeal shapes! And then--all at once--I became aware of\ntheir eyes,--eyes that watched me pitilessly, stedfastly, and\ndisdainfully,--eyes that like witch-fires, seemed to slowly burn\nterrific meanings into my very flesh and spirit. Convulsed and almost\nfrantic with the strain on my nerves, I abandoned myself to\ndespair,--this awful sight meant death I thought,--my last hour had\nsurely come! Then--I saw the lips of one of those dreadful faces move\n... some superhuman instinct in me leaped to life, ... in some strange\nway I thought I knew, or guessed the horror of what that next utterance\nwould be, ... and with all my remaining force I cried out--\n\n\"No! No! Not that eternal Doom! ... Not yet!\"\n\nFighting the vacant air, I strove to beat back those intangible weird\nShapes that loomed above me, withering up my soul with the fixed stare\nof their angry eyes, and with a choking call for help, I fell, as it\nwere, into a pit of darkness, where I lay mercifully unconscious.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nHow the ensuing hours between this horrible episode and full morning\nelapsed I do not know. I was dead to all impressions. I woke at last, or\nrather recovered my senses to see the sunlight pouring pleasantly\nthrough the half-drawn curtains at my window, and to find myself in bed\nin as restful a position as though I had never left it. Was it then\nmerely a vision I had seen?--a ghastly sort of nightmare? If so, it was\nsurely the most abhorrent illusion ever evolved from dreamland! It could\nnot be a question of health, for I had never felt better in my life. I\nlay for some time quiescent, thinking over the matter, with my eyes\nfixed on that part of the room where those Three Shapes had seemingly\nstood; but I had lately got into such a habit of cool self-analysis,\nthat by the time my valet brought my early cup of coffee, I had decided\nthat the whole thing was a dreadful fantasy, born of my own imagination,\nwhich had no doubt been unduly excited by the affair of Viscount\nLynton's suicide. I soon learned that there was no room left for doubt\nas to that unhappy young nobleman's actual death. A brief account of it\nwas in the morning papers, though as the tragedy had occurred so late at\nnight there were no details. A vague hint of 'money difficulties' was\nthrown out in one journal,--but beyond that, and the statement that the\nbody had been conveyed to the mortuary there to await an inquest, there\nwas nothing said, either personal or particular. I found Lucio in the\nsmoking-room, and it was he who first silently pointed out to me the\nshort paragraph headed 'Suicide of a Viscount.'\n\n\"I told you he was a good shot!\" he commented.\n\nI nodded. Somehow I had ceased to feel much interest in the subject. My\nemotion of the previous evening had apparently exhausted all my stock of\nsympathy and left me coldly indifferent. Absorbed in myself and my own\nconcerns, I sat down to talk and was not long before I had given a full\nand circumstantial account of the spectral illusion which had so\nunpleasantly troubled me during the night. Lucio listened, smiling\noddly.\n\n\"That old Tokay was evidently too strong for you!\" he said, when I had\nconcluded my story.\n\n\"Did you give me old Tokay?\" I responded laughing--\"Then the mystery is\nexplained! I was already overwrought, and needed no stimulant. But what\ntricks the imagination plays us to be sure! You have no idea of the\ndistinct manner in which those three phantoms asserted themselves! The\nimpression was extraordinarily vivid.\"\n\n\"No doubt!\" And his dark eyes studied me curiously. \"Impressions often\n_are_ very vivid. See what a marvellously real impression this world\nmakes upon us, for example!\"\n\n\"Ah! But then the world _is_ real!\" I answered.\n\n\"Is it? You accept it as such, I daresay, and things are as they appear\nto each separate individual. No two human beings think alike; hence\nthere may be conflicting opinions as to the reality or non-reality of\nthis present world. But we will not take unnecessary plunges into the\ninfinite question of what _is_, as contrasted with what appears to be. I\nhave some letters here for your consideration. You have lately spoken of\nbuying a country estate--what say you to Willowsmere Court in\nWarwickshire? I have had my eye on that place for you,--it seems to me\njust the very thing. It is a magnificent old pile; part of it dates from\nElizabeth's time. It is in excellent repair; the grounds are most\npicturesque, the classic river Avon winds with rather a broad sweep\nthrough the park,--and the whole thing, with a great part of the\nfurniture included, is to be sold for a mere song;--fifty thousand\npounds cash. I think you had better go in for it; it would just suit\nyour literary and poetic tastes.\"\n\nWas it my fancy, or had his musical voice the faintest touch of a sneer\nas he uttered the last words? I would not allow myself to think this\npossible, and answered quickly,--\n\n\"Anything _you_ recommend must be worth looking at, and I'll certainly\ngo and see it. The description sounds well, and Shakespeare's country\nalways appeals to me. But wouldn't you like to secure it for yourself?\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Not I! I live nowhere for long. I am of a roving disposition, and am\nnever happy tied down to one corner of the earth. But I suggest\nWillowsmere to you for two reasons,--first that it is charming and\nperfectly appointed; secondly, that it will impress Lord Elton\nconsiderably if he knows you are going to buy it.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Why, because it used to be his property\"--returned Lucio quietly--\"till\nhe got into the hands of the Jews. He gave them Willowsmere as security\nfor loans, and latterly they have stepped in as owners. They've sold\nmost of the pictures, china, bric-a-brac and other valuables. By the\nway, have you noticed how the legended God still appears to protect the\nhouse of Israel? Particularly the 'base usurer' who is allowed to get\nthe unhappy Christian into his clutches nine times out of ten? And no\nremedy drops from heaven! The Jew always triumphs. Rather inconsistent\nisn't it, on the part of an equitable Deity!\" His eyes flashed strange\nscorn. Anon he resumed--\"As a result of Lord Elton's unfortunate\nspeculations, and the Jews' admirable shrewdness, Willowsmere, as I tell\nyou is in the market, and fifty thousand pounds will make you the envied\nowner of a place worth a hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"We dine at the Eltons' to-night, do we not?\" I asked musingly.\n\n\"We do. You cannot have forgotten that engagement and Lady Sibyl so soon\nsurely!\" he answered laughing.\n\n\"No, I have not forgotten\"--I said at last, after a little silence. \"And\nI will buy this Willowsmere. I will telegraph instructions to my lawyers\nat once. Will you give me the name and address of the agents?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, my dear boy!\" And Lucio handed me a letter containing\nthe particulars concerning the sale of the estate and other items. \"But\nare you not making up your mind rather suddenly? Hadn't you better\ninspect the property first? There may be things you object to----\"\n\n\"If it were a rat-infested barrack,\" I said resolutely--\"I would still\nbuy it! I shall settle the matter at once. I wish to let Lord Elton know\nthis very night that I am the future owner of Willowsmere!\"\n\n\"Good!\"--and my companion thrust his arm through mine as we left the\nsmoking-room together--\"I like your swiftness of action Geoffrey. It is\nadmirable! I always respect determination. Even if a man makes up his\nmind to go to hell, I honour him for keeping to his word, and going\nthere straight as a die!\"\n\nI laughed, and we parted in high good-humour,--he to fulfil a club\nengagement, I to telegraph precise instructions to my legal friends\nMessrs Bentham and Ellis, for the immediate purchase in my name at all\ncosts, risks or inconveniences, of the estate known as Willowsmere Court\nin the county of Warwick.\n\nThat evening I dressed with more than common care, giving my man Morris\nalmost as much trouble as if I had been a fidgetty woman. He waited upon\nme however with exemplary patience, and only when I was quite ready did\nhe venture to utter what had evidently been on his mind for some time.\n\n\"Excuse me sir,\"--he then observed--\"but I daresay you've noticed that\nthere's something unpleasant-like about the prince's valet, Amiel?\"\n\n\"Well, he's rather a down-looking fellow if that's what you mean,\"--I\nreplied--\"But I suppose there's no harm in him.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that sir,\"--answered Morris severely; \"He does a\ngreat many strange things I do assure you. Downstairs with the servants\nhe goes on something surprising. Sings and acts and dances too, as if he\nwere a whole music-hall.\"\n\n\"Really!\" I exclaimed in surprise--\"I should never have thought it.\"\n\n\"Nor should I sir, but it's a fact.\"\n\n\"He must be rather an amusing fellow then,\"--I continued, wondering that\nmy man should take the accomplishments of Amiel in such an injured\nmanner.\n\n\"Oh, I don't say anything against his amusingness,\"--and Morris rubbed\nhis nose with a doubtful air--\"It's all very well for him to cut capers\nand make himself agreeable if he likes,--but it's the deceit of him that\nsurprises me sir. You'd think to look at him that he was a decent sort\nof dull chap with no ideas beyond his duty, but really sir, it's quite\nthe contrary, if you'll believe me. The language he uses when he's up to\nhis games downstairs is something frightful! And he actually swears he\nlearnt it from the gentlemen of the turf, sir! Last night he was play\nacting, and taking off all the fashionable folks,--then he took to\nhypnotising--and upon my word it made my blood run cold.\"\n\n\"Why, what did he do?\" I asked with some curiosity.\n\n\"Well, sir, he took one of the scullery-maids and sat her in a chair and\njust pointed at her. Pointed at her and grinned, for all the world like\na devil out of a pantomime. And though she is generally a respectable\nsober young woman, if she didn't get up with a screech and commence\ndancing round and round like a lunatic, while he kept on pointing. And\npresently she got to jumping and lifting her skirts that high that it\nwas positively scandalous! Some of us tried to stop her and couldn't;\nshe was like mad, till all at once number twenty-two bell rang--that's\nthe prince's room,--and he just caught hold of her, set her down in her\nchair again and clapped his hands. She came to directly, and didn't know\na bit what she'd been doing. Then twenty-two bell rang again, and the\nfellow rolled up his eyes like a clergyman and said, 'Let us pray!' and\noff he went.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"He seems to have a share of humour at anyrate,\"--I said; \"I should not\nhave thought it of him. But do you think these antics of his are\nmischievous?\"\n\n\"Well that scullery girl is very ill to-day,\"--replied Morris; \"I expect\nshe'll have to leave. She has what she calls the 'jumps' and none of us\ndare tell her how she got them. No sir, believe me or not as you like,\nthere's something very queer about that Amiel. And another thing I want\nto know is this--what does he do with the other servants?\"\n\n\"What does he do with the other servants?\" I repeated\nbewilderedly--\"What on earth do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well sir, the prince has a _chef_ of his own hasn't he?\" said Morris\nenumerating on his fingers--\"And two personal attendants besides\nAmiel,--quiet fellows enough who help in the waiting. Then he has a\ncoachman and groom. That makes six servants altogether. Now none of\nthese except Amiel are ever seen in the hotel kitchens. The _chef_ sends\nall the meals in from somewhere, in a heated receptacle--and the two\nother fellows are never seen except when waiting at table, and they\ndon't live in their own rooms all day, though they _may_ sleep\nthere,--and nobody knows where the carriage and horses are put up, or\nwhere the coachman and groom lodge. Certain it is that both they and the\n_chef_ board out. It seems to me very mysterious.\"\n\nI began to feel quite unreasonably irritated.\n\n\"Look here, Morris,\" I said--\"There's nothing more useless or more\nharmful than the habit of inquiring into other people's affairs. The\nprince has a right to live as he likes, and do as he pleases with his\nservants--I am sure he pays royally for his privileges. And whether his\ncook lives in or out, up in the skies or down in a cellar is no matter\nof mine. He has been a great traveller and no doubt has his\npeculiarities; and probably his notions concerning food are very\nparticular and fastidious. But I don't want to know anything about his\nm\u00c3\u00a9nage. If you dislike Amiel, it's easy to avoid him, but for goodness\nsake don't go making mysteries where none exist.\"\n\nMorris looked up, then down, and folded one of my coats with special\ncare. I saw I had effectually checked his flow of confidence.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\"--he observed, and said no more.\n\nI was rather diverted than otherwise at my servant's solemn account of\nAmiel's peculiarities as exhibited among his own class,--and when we\nwere driving to Lord Elton's that evening I told something of the story\nto Lucio. He laughed.\n\n\"Amiel's spirits are often too much for him,\"--he said--\"He is a perfect\nimp of mischief and cannot always control himself.\"\n\n\"Why, what a wrong estimate I have formed of him!\" I said--\"I thought he\nhad a peculiarly grave and somewhat sullen disposition.\"\n\n\"You know the trite saying--appearances are deceptive?\" went on my\ncompanion lightly--\"It's extremely true. The professed humourist is\nnearly always a disagreeable and heavy man personally. As for Amiel, he\nis like me in the respect of not being at all what he seems. His only\nfault is a tendency to break the bounds of discipline, but otherwise he\nserves me well, and I do not inquire further. Is Morris disgusted or\nalarmed?\"\n\n\"Neither I think,\" I responded laughing--\"He merely presents himself to\nme as an example of outraged respectability.\"\n\n\"Ah then, you may be sure that when the scullery-maid was dancing, he\nobserved her steps with the closest nicety;\" said Lucio--\"Very\nrespectable men are always particular of inspection into these matters!\nSoothe his ruffled feelings, my dear Geoffrey, and tell him that Amiel\nis the very soul of virtue! I have had him in my service for a long\ntime, and can urge nothing against his character as a man. He does not\npretend to be an angel. His tricks of speech and behaviour are the result\nof a too constant repression of his natural hilarity, but he is really\nan excellent fellow. He dabbled in hypnotic science when he was with me\nin India; I have often warned him of the danger there is in practising\nthis force on the uninitiated. But--a scullery-maid!--heavens!--there\nare so many scullery-maids! One more or less with the 'jumps' will not\nmatter. This is Lord Elton's.\"\n\nThe carriage stopped before a handsome house situated a little back from\nPark Lane. We were admitted by a man-servant gorgeous in red plush,\nwhite silk hose and powdered wig, who passed us on majestically to his\ntwin-brother in height and appearance, though perhaps a trifle more\ndisdainful in bearing, and he in his turn ushered us upstairs with the\nair of one who should say \"See to what ignominious degradation a cruel\nfate reduces so great a man!\" In the drawing-room we found Lord Elton,\nstanding on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and directly\nopposite him in a low arm chair, reclined an elegantly attired young\nlady with very small feet. I mention the feet, because as I entered they\nwere the most prominent part of her person, being well stretched out\nfrom beneath the would-be concealment of sundry flounced petticoats\ntowards the warmth of the fire which the Earl rather inconsiderately\nscreened from view. There was another lady in the room sitting bolt\nupright with hands neatly folded on her lap, and to her we were first of\nall introduced when Lord Elton's own effusive greetings were over.\n\n\"Charlotte, allow me,--my friends, Prince Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez--Mr Geoffrey\nTempest; gentlemen, my sister-in-law, Miss Charlotte Fitzroy.\"\n\nWe bowed; the lady gave us a dignified bend of the head. She was an\nimposing looking spinster, with a curious expression on her features\nwhich was difficult to construe. It was pious and prim, but it also\nsuggested the idea that she must have seen something excessively\nimproper once in her life and had never been able to forget it. The\npursed-up mouth, the round pale-coloured eyes and the chronic air of\ninsulted virtue which seemed to pervade her from head to foot all helped\nto deepen this impression. One could not look at Miss Charlotte long\nwithout beginning to wonder irreverently what it was that had in her\nlong past youth so outraged the cleanly proprieties of her nature as to\nleave such indelible traces on her countenance. But I have since seen\nmany English women look so, especially among the particularly 'high\nbred,' old and plain-featured of the \"upper ten.\" Very different was the\nsaucy and bright physiognomy of the younger lady to whom we were next\npresented, and who, raising herself languidly from her reclining\nposition, smiled at us with encouraging familiarity as we made our\nsalutations.\n\n\"Miss Diana Chesney,\"--said the Earl glibly--\"You perhaps know her\nfather, prince,--you must have heard of him at any rate--the famous\nNicodemus Chesney, one of the great railway-kings.\"\n\n\"Of course I know him\"--responded Lucio warmly--\"Who does not! I have\nmet him often. A charming man, gifted with most remarkable humour and\nvitality--I remember him perfectly. We saw a good deal of each other in\nWashington.\"\n\n\"Did you though?\" said Miss Chesney with a somewhat indifferent\ninterest,--\"He's a queer sort of man to my thinking; rather a cross\nbetween the ticket-collector and custom-house officer combined, you\nknow! I never see him but what I feel I must start on a journey\ndirectly--railways seem to be written all over him. I tell him so. I say\n'Pa, if you didn't carry railway-tracks in your face you'd be better\nlooking.' And you found him humorous, did you?\"\n\nLaughing at the novel and free way in which this young person criticised\nher parent, Lucio protested that he did.\n\n\"Well I don't,\"--confessed Miss Chesney--\"But that may be because I've\nheard all his stories over and over again, and I've read most of them in\nbooks besides,--so they're not much account to me. He tells some of them\nto the Prince of Wales whenever he can get a chance,--but he don't try\nthem off on me any more. He's a real clever man too; he's made his pile\nquicker than most. And you're quite right about his vitality,--my!--his\nlaugh takes you into the middle of next week!\"\n\nHer bright eyes flashed merrily as she took a comprehensive survey of\nour amused faces.\n\n\"Think I'm irreverent, don't you?\" she went on--\"But you know Pa's not a\n'stage parent' all dressed out in lovely white hair and\nbenedictions,--he's just an accommodating railway-track, and he wouldn't\nlike to be reverenced. Do sit down, won't you?\"--then turning her pretty\nhead coquettishly towards her host--\"Make them sit down, Lord Elton,--I\nhate to see men standing. The superior sex, you know! Besides you're so\ntall,\" she added, glancing with unconcealed admiration at Lucio's\nhandsome face and figure, \"that it's like peering up an apple-tree at\nthe moon to look at you!\"\n\nLucio laughed heartily, and seated himself near her--I followed his\nexample; the old Earl still kept his position, legs a-straddle, on the\nhearth-rug, and beamed benevolence upon us all. Certainly Diana Chesney\nwas a captivating creature; one of those surface-clever American women\nwho distinctly divert men's minds without in the least rousing their\npassions.\n\n\"So you're the famous Mr Tempest?\" she said, surveying me\ncritically--\"Why, it's simply splendid for you isn't it? I always say\nit's no use having a heap of money unless you're young,--if you're old,\nyou only want it to fill your doctor's pockets while he tries to mend\nyour poor tuckered-out constitution. I once knew an old lady who was\nleft a legacy of a hundred thousand pounds when she was ninety-five.\nPoor old dear, she cried over it. She just had sense enough to\nunderstand what a good time she couldn't have. She lived in bed, and her\nonly luxury was a halfpenny bun dipped in milk for her tea. It was all\nshe cared for.\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand pounds would go a long way in buns!\" I said\nsmiling.\n\n\"Wouldn't it just!\" and the fair Diana laughed--\"But I guess _you'll_\nwant something a little more substantial for your cash Mr Tempest! A\nfortune in the prime of life is worth having. I suppose you're one of\nthe richest men about just now, aren't you?\"\n\nShe put the question in a perfectly na\u00c3\u00afve frank manner and seemed to be\nunconscious of any undue inquisitiveness in it.\n\n\"I may be one of the richest,\"--I replied, and as I spoke the thought\nflashed suddenly across me how recently I had been one of the\npoorest!--\"But my friend here, the prince, is far richer than I.\"\n\n\"Is that so!\" and she stared straight at Lucio, who met her gaze with an\nindulgent, half satirical smile--\"Well now! I guess Pa's no better than\na sort of pauper after all! Why, you must have the world at your feet!\"\n\n\"Pretty much so,\"--replied Lucio composedly--\"But then, my dear Miss\nChesney, the world is so very easily brought to one's feet. Surely _you_\nknow that?\"\n\nAnd he emphasized the words by an expressive look of his fine eyes.\n\n\"I guess you mean compliments,\"--she replied unconcernedly--\"I don't\nlike them as a rule, but I'll forgive you this once!\"\n\n\"Do!\" said Lucio, with one of his dazzling smiles that caused her to\nstop for a moment in her voluble chatter and observe him with mingled\nfascination and wonderment.\n\n\"And you too are young, like Mr Tempest,\"--she resumed presently.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" interrupted Lucio--\"I am many years older.\"\n\n\"Really!\" exclaimed Lord Elton at this juncture--\"You don't look it,\ndoes he Charlotte?\"\n\nMiss Fitzroy thus appealed to, raised her elegant tortoise-shell-framed\nglasses to her eyes and peered critically at us both.\n\n\"I should imagine the prince to be slightly the senior of Mr\nTempest\"--she remarked in precise high-bred accents--\"But only very\nslightly.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" resumed Miss Chesney \"you're young enough, to enjoy your\nwealth aren't you?\"\n\n\"Young enough, or old enough;--just as you please;\"--said Lucio with a\ncareless shrug--\"But as it happens--I do _not_ enjoy it!\"\n\nMiss Chesney's whole aspect now expressed the most lively astonishment.\n\n\"What does money do for you?\" went on Lucio, his eyes dilating with that\nstrange and wistful expression which had often excited my\ncuriosity--\"The world is at your feet, perhaps; yes--but _what_ a world!\nWhat a trumpery clod of kickable matter! Wealth acts merely as a kind of\nmirror to show you human nature at its worst. Men skulk and fawn about\nyou, and lie twenty times in as many hours in the hope to propitiate you\nand serve their own interests; princes of the blood willingly degrade\nthemselves and their position to borrow cash of you,--your intrinsic\nmerit (if you have any) is thought nothing of,--your full pockets are\nyour credentials with kings, prime ministers and councillors! You may\ntalk like a fool, laugh like a hyena and look like a baboon, but if the\nchink-chink of your gold be only sufficiently loud, you may soon find\nyourself dining with the Queen if such be your ambition. If, on the\ncontrary you happen to be truly great, brave, patient, and enduring,\nwith a spark in you of that genius which strengthens life and makes it\nbetter worth living,--if you have thoughts which take shape in work that\nshall endure when kingdoms are swept away like dust before the wind, and\nif, with all this you are yet poor in current coin, why then,--you shall\nbe spurned by all the crowned dummies of the world,--you shall be\nsnubbed by the affluent starch-maker and the Croesus who lives on a\npatent pill,--the tradesman from whom you buy bedsteads and kitchen\nware, can look down upon you with lordly scorn, for does he not by\nvirtue of his wealth alone, drive a four-in-hand, and chat on easy and\nalmost patronizing terms with the Prince of Wales? The wealthy denizens\nof Snob-land delight in ignoring Nature's elected noblemen.\"\n\n\"But supposing\" said Miss Chesney quickly, \"you happen to be a Nature's\nnobleman yourself, and have the advantage of wealth besides, surely you\nmust fairly allow that to be rather a good thing, mustn't you?\"\n\nLucio laughed a little--\n\n\"I will retort upon you in your own words fair lady, and say 'I guess\nyou mean compliments.' What I venture to imply however, is that even\nwhen wealth does fall to the lot of one of these 'Nature's noblemen,' it\nis not _because_ of his innate nobility that he wins social distinction.\nIt is simply because he is rich. That is what vexes me. I for example,\nhave endless friends who are not my friends so much as the friends of my\nincome. They do not trouble to inquire as to my antecedents,--what I am\nor where I came from is of no importance. Neither are they concerned in\nhow I live or what I do; whether I am sick or well, happy or unhappy, is\nequally with them a matter of indifference. If they knew more about me,\nit would perhaps be better in the long run. But they do not want to\nknow,--their aims are simple and unconcealed,--they wish to make as much\nout of me, and secure as much advantage to themselves by their\nacquaintance with me as possible. And I give them their full way,--they\nget all they want,--and more!\"\n\nHis musical voice lingered with a curiously melancholy impressiveness on\nthe last word,--and this time, not only Miss Chesney, but we all, looked\nat him as though drawn by some irresistible magnetic spell, and for a\nmoment there was silence.\n\n\"Very few people have any real friends,\"--said Lord Elton presently.\n\"And in that respect I suppose we're none of us worse off than Socrates,\nwho used to keep two chairs only in his house 'one for myself, and\nanother for a friend--when I find him!' But you are a universal\nfavourite Lucio,--a most popular fellow--and I think you're rather hard\non your set. People must look after themselves you know--eh?\"\n\nLucio bowed his head gravely.\n\n\"They must indeed,\" he replied--\"Especially as the latest news of\nscience is that God has given up the business.\"\n\nMiss Fitzroy looked displeased,--but the Earl laughed uproariously. At\nthat moment a step was heard outside, approaching the open doorway of\nthe drawing-room, and Miss Chesney's quick ears caught the sound. She\nshook herself out of her reclining attitude instantly and sat erect.\n\n\"It's Sibyl!\" she said with a half-laughing half-apologetic flash of her\nbrown eyes at us all--\"I never can loll before Sibyl!\"\n\nMy heart beat fast as the woman whom poets might have called the goddess\nof their dreams, but whom I was now disposed to consider as an object of\nbeauty lawfully open to my purchase, entered, clad in simple white,\nunrelieved by any ornaments save a golden waistbelt of antique\nworkmanship, and a knot of violets nestled among the lace at her bosom.\nShe looked far lovelier than when I had first seen her at the theatre;\nthere was a deeper light in her eyes and a more roseate flush on her\ncheeks, while her smile as she greeted us was positively dazzling.\nSomething in her presence, her movements, her manner, sent such a tide\nof passion through me that for a moment my brain whirled in a dizzy\nmaze, and despite the cold calculations I had made in my own mind as to\nthe certainty I had of winning her for my wife, there was a wondrous\ncharm of delicate dignity and unapproachableness about her that caused\nme for the moment to feel ashamed, and inclined to doubt even the power\nof wealth to move this exquisite lily of maidenhood from her sequestered\npeace. Ah, what fools men are! How little do we dream of the canker at\nthe hearts of these women 'lilies' that look so pure and full of grace!\n\n\"You are late, Sibyl,\" said her aunt severely.\n\n\"Am I?\" she responded with languid indifference--\"So sorry! Papa, are\nyou an extemporized fire-screen?\"\n\nLord Elton hastily moved to one side, rendered suddenly conscious of his\nselfish monopoly of the blaze.\n\n\"Are you not cold, Miss Chesney?\" continued Lady Sibyl, in accents of\nstudied courtesy--\"Would you not like to come nearer the fire?\"\n\nDiana Chesney had become quite subdued, almost timid in fact.\n\n\"Thank-you!\"--she murmured, and her eyes drooped with what might have\nbeen called retiring maiden modesty, had not Miss Chesney's qualities\nsoared far beyond that trite description.\n\n\"We heard some shocking news this morning, Mr Tempest,\" said Lady Sibyl,\nlooking at Lucio rather than at me--\"No doubt you read it in the\npapers,--an acquaintance of ours, Viscount Lynton, shot himself last\nnight.\"\n\nI could not repress a slight start. Lucio gave me a warning glance, and\ntook it upon himself to reply.\n\n\"Yes, I read a brief account of the affair--terrible indeed! I also knew\nhim slightly.\"\n\n\"Did you? Well, he was engaged to a friend of mine,\" went on Lady\nSibyl--\"I myself think she has had a lucky escape, because though he was\nan agreeable man enough in society, he was a great gambler, and very\nextravagant, and he would have run through her fortune very quickly. But\nshe cannot be brought to see it in that light,--she is dreadfully upset.\nShe had set her heart on being a Viscountess.\"\n\n\"I guess,\" said Miss Chesney demurely, with a sly sparkle of her\neyes--\"it's not only Americans who run after titles. Since I've been\nover here I've known several real nice girls marry downright mean\ndough-heads just for the sake of being called 'my lady' or 'your grace.'\nI like a title very well myself--but I also like a man attached to it.\"\n\nThe Earl smothered a chuckling laugh,--Lady Sibyl gazed meditatively\ninto the fire and went on as though she had not heard.\n\n\"Of course my friend will have other chances,--she is young and\nhandsome--but I really think, apart from the social point of view, that\nshe was a little in love with the Viscount----\"\n\n\"Nonsense! nonsense!\" said her father somewhat testily. \"You always have\nsome romantic notion or other in your head Sibyl,--one 'season' ought to\nhave cured you of sentiment--ha-ha-ha! She always knew he was a\ndissolute rascal, and she was going to marry him with her eyes wide open\nto the fact. When I read in the papers that he had blown his brains out\nin a hansom, I said 'Bad taste--bad taste! spoiling a poor cabby's\nstock-in-trade to satisfy a selfish whim!' ha-ha!--but I thought it was\na good riddance of bad rubbish. He would have made any woman's life\nutterly miserable.\"\n\n\"No doubt he would!\" responded Lady Sibyl, listlessly; \"But, all the\nsame, there is such a thing as love sometimes.\"\n\nShe raised her beautiful liquid eyes to Lucio's face, but he was not\nlooking her way, and her steadfast gaze met mine instead. What my looks\nexpressed I know not; but I saw the rich blood mantle warmly in her\ncheeks, and a tremor seemed to pass through her frame,--then she grew\nvery pale. At that moment one of the gorgeous footmen appeared at the\ndoorway.\n\n\"Dinner is served, my lud.\"\n\n\"Good!\" and the Earl proceeded to 'pair' us all. \"Prince, will you take\nMiss Fitzroy,--Mr Tempest, my daughter falls to your escort,--I will\nfollow with Miss Chesney.\"\n\nWe set off in this order down the stairs, and as I walked behind Lucio\nwith Lady Sibyl on my arm, I could not help smiling at the extreme\ngravity and earnestness with which he was discussing church matters with\nMiss Charlotte, and the sudden enthusiasm that apparently seized that\ndignified spinster at some of his remarks on the clergy, which took the\nform of the most affectionate and respectful eulogies, and were totally\nthe reverse of the ideas he had exchanged with me on the same subject.\nSome spirit of mischief was evidently moving him to have a solemn joke\nwith the high-bred lady he escorted, and I noted his behaviour with a\ngood deal of inward amusement.\n\n\"Then you know the dear Canon?\" I heard Miss Charlotte say.\n\n\"Most intimately!\" replied Lucio with fervour--\"and I assure you I am\nthankful to have the privilege of knowing him. A truly perfect\nman!--almost a saint--if not quite!\"\n\n\"So pure-minded!\" sighed the spinster.\n\n\"So free from every taint of hypocrisy!\" murmured Lucio with intense\ngravity.\n\n\"Ah yes! Yes indeed! And so----\"\n\nHere they passed into the dining-room and I could hear no more. I\nfollowed with my beautiful partner, and in another minute we were all\nseated at table.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe dinner went on in the fashion of most dinners at great\nhouses,--commencing with arctic stiffness and formality, thawing\nslightly towards the middle course, and attaining to just a pleasant\nwarmth of mutual understanding when ices and dessert gave warning of its\napproaching close. Conversation at first flagged unaccountably, but\nafterwards brightened under Lucio's influence to a certain gaiety. I did\nmy best to entertain Lady Sibyl, but found her like most 'society'\nbeauties, somewhat of a vague listener. She was certainly cold, and in a\nmanner irresponsive,--moreover I soon decided that she was not\nparticularly clever. She had not the art of sustaining or appearing to\nsustain interest in any one subject; on the contrary, she had, like many\nof her class, an irritating habit of mentally drifting away from you\ninto an absorbed reverie of her own in which you had no part, and which\nplainly showed you how little she cared for anything you or anyone else\nhappened to be saying. Many little random remarks of hers however\nimplied that in her apparently sweet nature there lurked a vein of\ncynicism and a certain contempt for men, and more than once her light\nwords stung my sense of self-love almost to resentment, while they\nstrengthened the force of my resolve to win her and bend that proud\nspirit of hers to the meekness befitting the wife of a millionaire\nand--a genius. A genius? Yes,--God help me!--that is what I judged\nmyself to be. My arrogance was two-fold,--it arose not only from what I\nimagined to be my quality of brain, but also from the knowledge of what\nmy wealth could do. I was perfectly positive that I could buy Fame,--buy\nit as easily as one buys a flower in the market,--and I was more than\npositive that I could buy love. In order to commence proving the truth\nof this, I threw out a 'feeler' towards my object.\n\n\"I believe,\" I said suddenly, addressing the Earl--\"you used to live in\nWarwickshire at Willowsmere Court did you not?\"\n\nLord Elton flushed an apoplectic red, and swallowed a gulp of champagne\nhastily.\n\n\"Yes-er-yes. I--er had the place for some time,--rather a bore to keep\nup,--wants quite an army of servants.\"\n\n\"Just so;\" I replied with a nod of appreciative comprehension--\"I\npresume it will require a considerable domestic retinue. I have arranged\nto purchase it.\"\n\nLady Sibyl's frigid composure was at last disturbed--she looked\nstrangely agitated,--and the Earl stared till his eyes seemed likely to\nfall out of his head.\n\n\"You? _You_ are going to buy Willowsmere?\" he ejaculated.\n\n\"Yes. I have wired to my lawyers to settle the matter as quickly as\npossible\"--and I glanced at Lucio whose steel-bright eyes were fixed on\nthe Earl with curious intentness,--\"I like Warwickshire,--and as I shall\nentertain a great deal I think the place will suit me perfectly.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Miss Charlotte Fitzroy sighed deeply, and\nthe lace bow on her severely parted hair trembled visibly. Diana Chesney\nlooked up with inquisitive eyes and a little wondering smile.\n\n\"Sibyl was born at Willowsmere,\"--said the Earl presently in rather a\nhusky voice.\n\n\"A new charm is added to its possession by that knowledge,\"--I said\ngently, bowing to Lady Sibyl as I spoke--\"Have you many recollections of\nthe place?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed I have!\" she answered with a touch of something like\npassion vibrating in her accents--\"There is no corner of the world I\nlove so well! I used to play on the lawns under the old oak-trees, and I\nalways gathered the first violets and primroses that came out on the\nbanks of the Avon. And when the hawthorn was in full flower I used to\nmake believe that the park was fairyland and I the fairy queen----\"\n\n\"As you were and are!\" interposed Lucio suddenly.\n\nShe smiled and her eyes flashed,--then she went on more quietly--\n\n\"It was all very foolish, but I loved Willowsmere, and love it still.\nAnd I often saw in the fields on the other side of the river which did\nnot belong to the estate, a little girl about my own age, playing all by\nherself and making long daisy-chains and buttercup balls,--a little girl\nwith long fair curls and a sweet baby face. I wanted to know her and\nspeak to her, but my nurse would never let me because she was supposed\nto be 'beneath' me.\" Lady Sibyl's lip curled scornfully at this\nrecollection. \"Yet she was well-born; she was the orphan child of a very\ndistinguished scholar and gentleman, and had been adopted by the\nphysician who attended her mother's deathbed, she having no living\nrelatives left to take care of her. And she--that little fair-haired\ngirl,--was Mavis Clare.\"\n\nAs this name was uttered, a sort of hush fell on our party as though an\n'Angelus' had rung; and Lucio looking across at me with peculiar\nintentness asked,\n\n\"Have you never heard of Mavis Clare, Tempest?\"\n\nI thought a moment before replying. Yes,--I had heard the\nname,--connected with literature in some dim and distant way, but I\ncould not remember when or how. For I never paid any attention to the\nnames of women who chose to associate themselves with the Arts, as I had\nthe usual masculine notion that all they did, whether in painting, music\nor writing, must of necessity be trash and unworthy of comment. Women,\nI loftily considered, were created to amuse men,--not to instruct them.\n\n\"Mavis Clare is a genius,\"--Lady Sibyl said presently--\"If Mr Tempest\nhas not heard of her, there is no doubt he _will_ hear. I often regret\nthat I never made her acquaintance in those old days at\nWillowsmere,--the stupidity of my nurse often rankles in my mind.\n'Beneath me'--indeed!--and how very much she is above me now! She still\nlives down there,--her adopted parents are dead and she rents the lovely\nlittle house they inhabited. She has bought some extra land about it and\nimproved the place wonderfully. Indeed I have never seen a more ideal\npoet's corner than Lily Cottage.\"\n\nI was silent, feeling somewhat in the background on account of my\nignorance as to the gifts and the position of the individual they all\nseemed to recognize as a celebrity of importance.\n\n\"Rather an odd name, Mavis, isn't it?\"--I at last ventured to observe.\n\n\"Yes,--but it suits her wonderfully. She sings quite as sweetly as any\nthrush, so she merits her designation.\"\n\n\"What has she done in literature?\" I continued.\n\n\"Oh,--only a novel!\" replied Lucio with a smile--\"But it has a quality\nunusual to novels; it lives! I hope, Tempest, that your forthcoming work\nwill enjoy the same vitality.\"\n\nHere Lord Elton who had been more or less brooding darkly over his glass\nof wine ever since I had mentioned my purchase of Willowsmere, roused\nhimself from his reverie.\n\n\"Why, God bless my soul!\" he exclaimed--\"You don't mean to tell me you\nhave written a novel Mr Tempest?\" (Was it possible he had never noticed\nall the prominent advertisements of my book in every paper, I thought\nindignantly!) \"What do you want to do that for, with your immense\nposition?\"\n\n\"He hankers after fame!\" said Lucio half kindly, half satirically.\n\n\"But you've got fame!\" declared the Earl emphatically--\"Everybody knows\nwho you are by this time.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear lord, that is not enough for the aspirations of my gifted\nfriend\"--responded Lucio, speaking for me, his eyes darkening with that\nmystic shadow of mingled sorrow and scorn which so frequently clouded\ntheir lustrous brilliancy; \"He does not particularly care for the\n'immense position' that is due to wealth alone, because that does not\nlift him a jot higher than Maple of Tottenham Court Road. He seeks to\nsoar beyond the furniture man,--and who shall blame him? He would be\nknown for that indescribable quality called Genius,--for high thoughts,\npoetry, divine instincts, and prophetic probings into the heart of\nhumanity,--in short, for the power of the Pen, which topples down great\nkingdoms like card-houses and sticks foolscaps on the heads of kings.\nGenerally it is the moneyless man or woman who is endowed with this\nunpurchaseable power,--this independence of action and indifference to\nopinion,--the wealthy seldom do anything but spend or hoard. But Tempest\nmeans to unite for once in his own person the two most strenuously\nopposed forces in nature,--genius and cash,--or in other words, God and\nMammon.\"\n\nLady Sibyl turned her head towards me;--there was a look of doubt and\nwonder on her beautiful face.\n\n\"I am afraid,\"--she said half smiling, \"that the claims of society will\ntake up too much of your time, Mr Tempest, to allow you to continue the\nwriting of books. I remember you told me the other evening that you were\nabout to publish a novel. I suppose you were--originally I mean--an\nauthor by profession?\"\n\nA curious sense of anger burned dully within me. 'Originally' an author?\nWas I not one still? Was I to be given credit for nothing but my\nbanking-book? 'Originally'? Why, I had never been an actual 'author'\ntill now,--I had simply been a wandering literary hack,--a stray 'super'\nof Grub Street, occasionally engaged to write articles 'to order' on\nany subject that came uppermost, at a starvation rate of pay, without\nany visible prospect of rising from that lowest and dirtiest rung of the\nliterary ladder. I felt myself growing red, then pale,--and I saw that\nLucio was looking at me fixedly.\n\n\"I _am_ an author, Lady Sibyl\"--I said at last--\"and I hope I may soon\nprove my right to be acknowledged as one. 'Author' is in my opinion, a\nprouder title than king, and I do not think any social claims will deter\nme from following the profession of literature, which I look upon as the\nhighest in the world.\"\n\nLord Elton fidgetted uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"But your people\"--he said--\"Your family--are they literary?\"\n\n\"No members of my family are now living,\"--I answered somewhat\nstiffly--\"My father was John Tempest of Rexmoor.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" and the Earl's face brightened considerably--\"Dear me, dear\nme! I used to meet him often in the hunting field years ago. You come of\na fine old stock, sir!--the Tempests of Rexmoor are well and honourably\nknown in county chronicles.\"\n\nI said nothing, feeling a trifle heated in temper, though I could not\nhave quite explained why.\n\n\"One begins to wonder,\"--said Lucio then in his soft smooth\naccents--\"when one is the descendant of a good English county family,--a\ndistinct cause for pride!--and moreover has the still more substantial\nfact of a large fortune to support that high lineage, why one should\ntrouble to fight for merely literary honours! You are far too modest in\nyour ambitions, Tempest!--high-seated as you are upon bank-notes and\nbullion, with all the glory of effulgent county chronicles behind you,\nyou still stoop to clutch the laurel! Fie, my dear fellow! You degrade\nyourself by this desire to join the company of the immortals!\"\n\nHis satirical tone was not lost upon the company; and I, who saw that\nin his own special way he was defending the claims of literature against\nthose of mere place and money, felt soothed and grateful. The Earl\nlooked a trifle annoyed.\n\n\"That's all very fine,\" he said--\"But you see it isn't as if Mr Tempest\nwere driven by necessity to write for his living\"--\n\n\"One may love work for the work's sake without any actual necessity for\ndoing it,\"--I interposed--\"For example,--this Mavis Clare you speak\nof,--is she,--a woman,--driven by necessity?\"\n\n\"Mavis Clare hasn't a penny in the world that she does not earn,\"--said\nLord Elton gruffly--\"I suppose that if she did not write she would\nstarve.\"\n\nDiana Chesney laughed.\n\n\"I guess she's a long way off starvation just now,\"--she remarked, her\nbrown eyes twinkling--\"Why, she's as proud as the proudest,--drives in\nthe Park in her victoria and pair with the best in the land, and knows\nall the 'swagger' people. She's nowhere near Grub Street _I_ should say.\nI hear she's a splendid business woman, and more than a match for the\npublishers all round.\"\n\n\"Well I should rather doubt that,\"--said the Earl with a chuckle. \"It\nneeds the devil himself to match the publishers.\"\n\n\"You are right!\"--said Lucio--\"In fact I daresay that in the various\n'phases' or transmigrations of the spirit into differing forms of earthy\nmatter, the devil (should he exist at all) has frequently become a\npublisher,--and a particularly benevolent publisher too!--by way of\ndiversion.\"\n\nWe all smiled.\n\n\"Well, I should imagine Mavis Clare to be a match for anybody or\nanything,\"--said Lady Sibyl--\"Of course she is not rich,--but she spends\nher money wisely and to effective advantage. I do not know her\npersonally,--I wish I did; but I have read her books, which are quite\nout of the common. She is a most independent creature too; quite\nindifferent to opinions\"--\n\n\"I suppose she must be extremely plain then\"--I observed; \"Plain women\nalways try to do something more or less startling in order to attract\nthe attention denied to their personality.\"\n\n\"True,--but that would not apply to Miss Clare. She is pretty, and knows\nhow to dress besides.\"\n\n\"_Such_ a virtue in literary women!\" exclaimed Diana Chesney--\"Some of\nthem _are_ such dowdies!\"\n\n\"Most people of culture,\" went on Lady Sibyl--\"in our set at any rate,\nare accustomed to look upon Miss Clare as quite an exception to the\nusual run of authors. She is charming in herself as well as in her\nbooks, and she goes everywhere. She writes with inspiration,--and always\nhas something so new to say--\"\n\n\"That of course all the critics are down upon her?\" queried Lucio.\n\n\"Oh, naturally! But _we_ never read reviews.\"\n\n\"Nor anyone else I should hope,\"--said Lord Elton with a laugh--\"except\nthe fellows who write them, ha--ha--ha! I call it damned\nimpertinence--excuse the word--on the part of a newspaper hack to\npresume to teach _me_ what I ought to read, or what I ought to\nappreciate. I'm quite capable of forming my own judgment on any book\nthat ever was written. But I avoid all the confounded 'new'\npoets,--avoid 'em like poison, sir--ha--ha! Anything but a 'new' poet;\nthe old ones are good enough for me! Why sir, these reviewers who give\nthemselves such airs with a pennorth of ink and a pen, are mostly\nhalf-grown half-educated boys who for a couple of guineas a week\nundertake to tell the public what _they_ think of such and such a book,\nas if anyone cared a jot about their green opinions! Ridiculous--quite\nridiculous!--what do they take the public for I wonder! Editors of\nresponsible journals ought to know better than to employ such young\ncoxcombs just because they can get them cheap----\"\n\nAt this juncture the butler came up behind his master's chair and\nwhispered a few words. The Earl's brow clouded,--then he addressed his\nsister-in-law,--\n\n\"Charlotte, Lady Elton sends word that she will come into the\ndrawing-room to-night. Perhaps you had better go and see that she is\nmade comfortable.\" And, as Miss Charlotte rose, he turned to us\nsaying--\"My wife is seldom well enough to see visitors, but this evening\nshe feels inclined for a little change and distraction from the monotony\nof her sick-room. It will be very kind of you two gentlemen to entertain\nher,--she cannot speak much, but her hearing and sight are excellent,\nand she takes great interest in all that is going on. Dear dear me!\" and\nhe heaved a short troubled sigh--\"She used to be one of the brightest of\nwomen!\"\n\n\"The sweet Countess!\" murmured Miss Chesney with patronizing\ntenderness--\"She is quite lovely still!\"\n\nLady Sibyl glanced at her with a sudden haughty frown which showed me\nplainly what a rebellious temper the young beauty held in control; and I\nfell straightway more in love,--according to _my_ idea of love,--than\never. I confess I like a woman to have a certain amount of temper. I\ncannot endure your preternaturally amiable female who can find nothing\nin all the length or breadth of the globe to move her to any other\nexpression than a fatuous smile. I love to see the danger-flash in\nbright eyes,--the delicate quiver of pride in the lines of a lovely\nmouth, and the warm flush of indignation on fair cheeks. It all suggests\nspirit, and untamed will; and rouses in a man the love of mastery that\nis born in his nature, urging him to conquer and subdue that which seems\nunconquerable. And all the desire of such conquest was strong within me,\nwhen at the close of dinner I rose and held the door open for the ladies\nto pass out of the room. As the fair Sibyl went, the violets she wore at\nher bosom dropped. I picked them up and made my first move.\n\n\"May I keep these?\" I said in a low tone.\n\nHer breath came and went quickly,--but she looked straight in my eyes\nwith a smile that perfectly comprehended my hidden meaning.\n\n\"You may!\" she answered.\n\nI bowed,--closed the door behind her, and secreting the flowers,\nreturned, well-satisfied, to my place at table.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nLeft with myself and Lucio, Lord Elton threw off all reserve, and became\nnot only familiar, but fawning in his adulation of us both. An abject\nand pitiable desire to please and propitiate us expressed itself in his\nevery look and word; and I firmly believe that if I had coolly and\nbrutally offered to buy his fair daughter by private treaty for a\nhundred thousand pounds, that sum to be paid down to him on the day of\nmarriage, he would have gladly agreed to sell. Apart however from his\npersonal covetousness, I felt and knew that my projected courtship of\nLady Sibyl would of necessity resolve itself into something more or less\nof a market bargain, unless indeed I could win the girl's love. I meant\nto try and do this, but I fully realized how difficult, nay, almost\nimpossible it would be for her to forget the fact of my unhampered and\nvast fortune, and consider me for myself alone. Herein is one of the\nblessings of poverty which the poor are frequently too apt to forget. A\nmoneyless man if he wins a woman's love knows that such love is genuine\nand untainted by self-interest; but a rich man can never be truly\ncertain of love at all. The advantages of a wealthy match are constantly\nurged upon all marriageable girls by both their parents and\nfriends,--and it would have to be a very unsophisticated feminine nature\nindeed that could contemplate a husband possessing five millions of\nmoney, without a touch of purely interested satisfaction. A very wealthy\nman can never be sure even of friendship,--while the highest, strongest\nand noblest kind of love is nearly always denied to him, in this way\ncarrying out the fulfilment of those strange but true words--\"How hardly\nshall he that is a rich man, enter the Kingdom of Heaven!\" The heaven of\na woman's love, tried and proved true through disaster and\ndifficulty,--of her unflinching faithfulness and devotion in days of\ntoil and bitter anguish,--of her heroic self-abnegation, sweetness and\ncourage through the darkest hours of doubt and disappointment;--this\nbright and splendid side of woman's character is reserved by Divine\nordinance for the poor man. The millionaire can indeed wed whomsoever he\npleases among all the beauties of the world,--he can deck his wife in\ngorgeous apparel, load her with jewels and look upon her in all the\nradiance of her richly adorned loveliness as one may look upon a perfect\nstatue or matchless picture,--but he can never reach the deeper secrets\nof her soul or probe the well-springs of her finer nature. I thought\nthis even thus early in the beginning of my admiration for Lady Sibyl\nElton, though I did not then dwell upon it as I have often done since. I\nwas too elated with the pride of wealth to count the possibilities of\nsubtle losses amid so many solid gains; and I enjoyed to the full and\nwith a somewhat contemptuous malice the humble prostration of a 'belted\nEarl' before the dazzling mine of practically unlimited cash as\nrepresented to him in the persons of my brilliant comrade and myself. I\ntook a curious sort of pleasure in patronizing him, and addressed him\nwith a protecting air of indulgent kindness whereat he seemed gratified.\nInwardly I laughed as I thought how differently matters would have\nstood, supposing I had been indeed no more than 'author'! I might have\nproved to be one of the greatest writers of the age, but if, with that,\nI had been poor or only moderately well off, this same half bankrupt\nEarl who privately boarded an American heiress for two thousand guineas\na year, would have deemed it a 'condescension' to so much as invite me\nto his house,--would have looked down upon me from his titled\nnothingness and perhaps carelessly alluded to me as 'a man who\nwrites--er--yes--er--rather clever I believe!' and then would have\nthought no more about me. For this very cause as 'author' still, though\nmillionaire, I took a fantastic pleasure in humiliating his lordship as\nmuch as possible, and I found the best way to do this was to talk about\nWillowsmere. I saw that he winced at the very name of his lost estate,\nand that notwithstanding this, he could not avoid showing his anxiety as\nto my intentions with regard to its occupation. Lucio, whose wisdom and\nforesight had suggested my becoming the purchaser of the place, assisted\nme in the most adroit fashion to draw him out and to make his character\nmanifest, and by the time we had finished our cigars and coffee I knew\nthat the 'proud' Earl of Elton, who could trace his lineage to the\nearliest days of the Crusaders, was as ready to bend his back and crawl\nin the dust for money as the veriest hotel-porter expectant of a\nsovereign 'tip.' I had never entertained a high opinion of the\naristocracy, and on this occasion it was certainly not improved, but\nremembering that the spendthrift nobleman beside me was the father of\nLady Sibyl, I treated him on the whole with more respect than his mean\nand grasping nature deserved.\n\nOn returning to the drawing-room after dinner I was struck by the chill\nweirdness that seemed to be imparted to it by the addition of Lady\nElton's couch, which, placed near the fire, suggested a black\nsarcophagus in bulk and outline. It was practically a narrow bed on\nwheels, though partially disguised by a silk coverlet draped skilfully\nso as to somewhat hide its coffin-like shape. The extended figure of the\nparalysed Countess herself presented a death-like rigidity; but her face\nas she turned it towards us on our entrance, was undisfigured as yet and\ndistinctly handsome, her eyes especially being large, clear, and almost\nbrilliant. Her daughter introduced us both in a low tone, and she moved\nher head slightly by way of acknowledgment, studying us curiously the\nwhile.\n\n\"Well, my dear\"--said Lord Elton briskly, \"This is an unexpected\npleasure! It is nearly three months since you honoured us with your\ncompany. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Better,\" she replied slowly, yet distinctly, her gaze now fixed with\nwondering intentness on Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez.\n\n\"Mother found the room rather cold\"--explained Lady Sibyl--\"So we\nbrought her as near to the fire as possible. It _is_ cold\"--and she\nshivered--\"I fancy it must be freezing hard.\"\n\n\"Where is Diana?\" asked the Earl, looking about in search of that lively\nyoung lady.\n\n\"Miss Chesney has gone to her own room to write a letter;\" replied his\ndaughter somewhat frigidly--\"She will be back directly.\"\n\nAt this moment Lady Elton feebly raised her hand and pointed to Lucio,\nwho had moved aside to answer some question asked of him by Miss\nCharlotte.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Why, mother dear, I told you\"--said Lady Sibyl gently--\"That is Prince\nLucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, Papa's great friend.\"\n\nThe Countess's pallid hand still remained lifted, as though it were\nfrozen in air.\n\n\"_What_ is he?\" the slow voice again inquired,--and then the hand\ndropped suddenly like a dead thing.\n\n\"Now Helena, you must not excite yourself\"--said her husband, bending\nover her couch with real or assumed anxiety; \"Surely you remember all I\nhave told you about the prince? And also about this gentleman, Mr\nGeoffrey Tempest?\"\n\nShe nodded, and her eyes, turning reluctantly away from Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,\nregarded me fixedly.\n\n\"You are a very young man to be a millionaire,\"--were her next words,\nuttered with evident difficulty--\"Are you married?\"\n\nI smiled, and answered in the negative. Her looks wandered from me to\nher daughter's face,--then back to me again with a singularly intent\nexpression. Finally, the potent magnetism of Lucio's presence again\nattracted her, and she indicated him by a gesture.\n\n\"Ask your friend ... to come here ... and speak to me.\"\n\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez turned instinctively at her request, and with his own peculiar\ncharm and gallant grace of bearing, came to the side of the paralysed\nlady, and taking her hand, kissed it.\n\n\"Your face seems familiar to me,\"--she said, speaking now, as it seemed,\nwith greater ease--\"Have I ever met you before?\"\n\n\"Dear lady, you may have done so\"--he replied in dulcet tones and with a\nmost captivating gentleness of manner--\"It occurs to me, now I think of\nit, that years ago, I saw once, as a passing vision of loveliness, in\nthe hey-day of youth and happiness, Helena Fitzroy, before she was\nCountess of Elton.\"\n\n\"You must have been a mere boy--a child,--at that time!\" she murmured\nfaintly smiling.\n\n\"Not so!--for you are still young, Madame, and I am old. You look\nincredulous? Alas, why is it I wonder, I may not look the age I am! Most\nof my acquaintances spend a great part of their lives in trying to look\nthe age they are not; and I never came across a man of fifty who was not\nproud to be considered thirty-nine. My desires are more laudable,--yet\nhonourable eld refuses to impress itself upon my features. It is quite a\nsore point with me I assure you.\"\n\n\"Well, how old are you really?\" asked Lady Sibyl smiling at him.\n\n\"Ah, I dare not tell you!\" he answered, returning the smile; \"But I\nought to explain that in my countings I judge age by the workings of\nthought and feeling, more than by the passing of years. Thus it should\nnot surprise you to hear that I feel myself old,--old as the world!\"\n\n\"But there are scientists who say that the world is young;\" I observed,\n\"And that it is only now beginning to feel its forces and put forth its\nvigour.\"\n\n\"Such optimistic wise-acres are wrong,\" he answered,--\"The world is a\nveritable husk of a planet; humanity has nearly completed all its\nallotted phases, and the end is near.\"\n\n\"The end?\" echoed Lady Sibyl,--\"Do you believe the world will ever come\nto an end?\"\n\n\"I do, most certainly. Or, to be more correct, it will not actually\nperish, but will simply change. And the change will not agree with the\nconstitution of its present inhabitants. They will call the\ntransformation the Day of Judgment. I should imagine it would be a fine\nsight.\"\n\nThe Countess gazed at him wonderingly,--Lady Sibyl seemed amused.\n\n\"I would rather not witness it,\"--said Lord Elton gruffly.\n\n\"Oh, why?\" and Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez looked about with quite a cheerful air--\"A final\nglimpse of the planet ere we _a_scend or _de_scend to our future homes\nelsewhere, would be something to remember! Madame\"--here he addressed\nLady Elton; \"are you fond of music?\"\n\nThe invalid smiled gratefully, and bent her head in acquiescence. Miss\nChesney had just entered the room and heard the question.\n\n\"Do you play?\" she exclaimed vivaciously, touching him on the arm with\nher fan.\n\nHe bowed. \"I do. In an erratic sort of fashion. I also sing. Music has\nalways been one of my passions. When I was very young,--ages ago,--I\nused to imagine I could hear the angel Israfel chanting his strophes\namid the golden glow of heavenly glory,--himself white-winged and\nwonderful, with a voice out-ringing beyond the verge of paradise!\"\n\nAs he spoke, a sudden silence fell upon us all. Something in his accent\ntouched my heart to a strange sense of sorrow and yearning, and the\nCountess of Elton's dark eyes, languid with long suffering, grew soft as\nthough with repressed tears.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he continued more lightly--\"just at odd moments--I like to\nbelieve in Paradise. It is a relief, even to a hardened sinner like\nmyself, to fancy that there _may_ exist something in the way of a world\nbetter than this one.\"\n\n\"Surely sir,\" said Miss Charlotte Fitzroy severely--\"you believe in\nHeaven?\"\n\nHe looked at her and smiled slightly.\n\n\"Madame, forgive me! I do not believe in the clerical heaven. I know you\nwill be angry with me for this frank confession! But I cannot picture\nthe angels in white smocks with goose wings, or the Deity as a somewhat\nexcitable personage with a beard. Personally I should decline to go to\nany heaven which was only a city with golden streets; and I should\nobject to a sea of glass, resenting it as a want of invention on the\npart of the creative Intelligence. But----do not frown, dear Miss\nFitzroy!--I do believe in Heaven all the same,--a different kind of\nheaven,--I often see it in my dreams!\"\n\nHe paused, and again we were all silent, gazing at him. Lady Sibyl's\neyes indeed, rested upon him with such absorbed interest, that I became\nsomewhat irritated, and was glad, when turning towards the Countess once\nmore, he said quietly.\n\n\"Shall I give you some music now, Madame?\"\n\nShe murmured assent, and followed him with a vaguely uneasy glance as he\ncrossed over to the grand piano and sat down. I had never heard him\neither play or sing; in fact so far as his accomplishments went, I knew\nnothing of him as yet except that he was a perfect master of the art of\nhorsemanship. With the first few bars he struck I half started from my\nchair in amazement;--could a mere pianoforte produce such sounds?--or\nwas there some witchery hidden in the commonplace instrument, unguessed\nby any other performer? I stared around me, bewildered,--I saw Miss\nCharlotte drop her knitting abstractedly,--Diana Chesney, lying lazily\nback in one corner of the sofa, half closed her eyelids in dreamy\necstasy,--Lord Elton stood near the fire resting one arm on the\nmantelpiece and shading his fuzzy brows with his hand,--and Lady Sibyl\nsat beside her mother, her lovely face pale with emotion, while on the\nworn features of the invalided lady there was an expression of mingled\npain and pleasure difficult to describe. The music swelled into\npassionate cadence,--melodies crossed and re-crossed each other like\nrays of light glittering among green leaves,--voices of birds and\nstreams and tossing waterfalls chimed in with songs of love and playful\nmerriment;--anon came wilder strains of grief and angry clamour; cries\nof despair were heard echoing through the thunderous noise of some\nrelentless storm,--farewells everlastingly shrieked amid sobs of\nreluctant shuddering agony;--and then, as I listened, before my eyes a\nblack mist gathered slowly, and I thought I saw great rocks bursting\nasunder into flame, and drifting islands in a sea of fire,--faces,\nwonderful, hideous, beautiful, peered at me out of a darkness denser\nthan night, and in the midst of this there came a tune, complete in\nsweetness and suggestion,--a piercing sword-like tune that plunged into\nmy very heart and rankled there,----my breath failed me,--my senses\nswam,--I felt that I must move, speak, cry out, and implore that this\nmusic, this horribly insidious music should cease ere I swooned with the\nvoluptuous poison of it,--when, with a full chord of splendid harmony\nthat rolled out upon the air like a breaking wave, the intoxicating\nsounds ebbed away into silence. No one spoke,--our hearts were yet\nbeating too wildly with the pulsations roused by that wondrous lyric\nstorm. Diana Chesney was the first to break the spell.\n\n\"Well, that beats everything I've ever heard!\" she murmured tremulously.\n\nI could say nothing,--I was too occupied with my own thoughts. Something\nin the music had instilled itself into my blood, or so I fancied, and\nthe clinging subtle sweetness of it, moved me to strange emotions that\nwere neither wise, nor worthy of a man. I looked at Lady Sibyl; she was\nvery pale,--her eyes were cast down and her hands were trembling. On a\nsudden impulse I rose and went to Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez where he still sat at the\npiano, his hands dumbly wandering over the keys.\n\n\"You are a great master\"--I said--\"A wonderful performer! But do you\nknow what your music suggests?\"\n\nHe met my fixed gaze, shrugged his shoulders, and shook his head.\n\n\"Crime!\" I whispered--\"You have roused in me evil thoughts of which I am\nashamed. I did not think that was possible to so divine an Art.\"\n\nHe smiled, and his eyes glittered with the steely brightness of stars on\na wintry night.\n\n\"Art takes its colours from the mind, my dear friend;\"--he said--\"If you\ndiscover evil suggestions in my music, the evil, I fear, must be in your\nown nature.\"\n\n\"Or in yours!\" I said quickly.\n\n\"Or in mine;\"--he agreed coldly--\"I have often told you I am no saint.\"\n\nI stood hesitatingly, looking at him. For one moment his great personal\nbeauty appeared hateful to me, though I knew not why. Then the feeling\nof distrust and repulsion slowly passed, leaving me humiliated and\nabashed.\n\n\"Pardon me, Lucio!\" I murmured regretfully--\"I spoke in haste; but truly\nyour music almost put me in a state of frenzy,--I never heard anything\nin the least like it----\"\n\n\"Nor I,\"--said Lady Sibyl, who just then moved towards the piano--\"It\nwas marvellous! Do you know, it quite frightened me?\"\n\n\"I am sorry!\" he answered with a penitent air--\"I know I am quite a\nfailure as a pianist--I am not sufficiently 'restrained,' as the press\nmen would say.\"\n\n\"A failure? Good God!\" exclaimed Lord Elton at this juncture--\"Why, if\nyou played like that in public, you'd drive everyone frantic!\"\n\n\"With alarm?\" queried Lucio, laughing--\"Or with disgust?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! you know what I mean very well. I have always had a contempt\nfor the piano as an instrument, but by Jove! I never heard such music as\nyours even in a full orchestra. It is extraordinary!--it is positively\nmagnificent! Where in the world did you study?\"\n\n\"In Nature's conservatoire;\"--replied Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez lazily. \"My first\n'maestro' was an amiable nightingale. He, singing on a branch of fir\nwhen the moon was full, explained with liquid-noted patience, how to\nconstruct and produce a pure roulade, cadenza and trill,--and when I had\nlearned thus far, he showed me all the most elaborate methods of\napplying rhythmic tune to the upward and downward rush of the wind, thus\nsupplying me with perfect counterpoint. Chords I learned from old\nNeptune, who was good enough to toss a few of his largest billows to the\nshore for my special benefit. He nearly deafened me with his\ninstructions, being somewhat excitable and loud-voiced,--but on finding\nme an apt pupil, he drew back his waves to himself with so much delicacy\namong the pebbles and sand, that at once I mastered the secret of\nplaying _arpeggi_. Once too I had a finishing lesson from a Dream,--a\nmystic thing with wild hair and wings--it sang one word in my ears, and\nthe word was unpronounceable in mortal speech,--but after many efforts I\ndiscovered it lurking in the scale of sound. The best part of it all\nwas, that my instructors asked no fees!\"\n\n\"I think you are a poet as well as a musician,\"--said Lady Sibyl.\n\n\"A poet! Spare me!--my dear young lady, why are you so cruel as to load\nme with so vile an imputation! Better be a murderer than a poet,--one is\ntreated with much more respect and courteous consideration,--by the\npress at anyrate. The murderer's breakfast-menu will be given due place\nin many of the most estimable journals,--but the poet's lack of both\nbreakfast and dinner will be deemed his fitting reward. Call me a\nlive-stock producer, a horse-breeder, a timber-merchant,--anything but a\npoet! Why even Tennyson became an amateur milkman to somewhat conceal\nand excuse the shame and degradation of writing verse!\"\n\nWe all laughed.\n\n\"Well, you must admit,\" said Lord Elton, \"that we've had rather too much\nof poets lately. It's no wonder we're sick of them, and that poetry has\nfallen into disrepute. Poets are such a quarrelsome lot too--effeminate,\npuling, unmanly humbugs!\"\n\n\"You are speaking of the newly 'discovered' ones of course,\" said\nLucio--\"Yes, they are a weedy collection. I have sometimes thought that\nout of pure philanthropy I would start a bon-bon manufactory, and employ\nthem to write mottoes for the crackers. It would keep them out of\nmischief and provide them with a little pocket-money, for as matters\nstand they do not make a farthing by their books. But I do not call them\n'poets' at all,--they are mere rhymers. One or two real poets do exist,\nbut, like the prophets of Scripture, they are not 'in society,' nor can\nthey get their logs rolled by any of their contemporaries. They are not\nfavourites with any 'set'; that is why I am afraid my dear friend\nTempest will never be accepted as the genius he is; society will be too\nfond of him to let him go down into dust and ashes to gather the\nlaurel.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary to go down into dust and ashes for that,\" I said.\n\n\"I assure you it is!--\" he answered gaily--\"Positively imperative. The\nlaurel flourishes best so,--it will not grow in a hot-house.\"\n\nAt that moment Diana Chesney approached.\n\n\"Lady Elton would like to hear you sing, prince--\" she said--\"Will you\ngive us that pleasure? Do! Something quite simple, you know,--it will\nset our nerves straight after your terribly beautiful music! You'd\nhardly believe it perhaps,--but I really feel quite unstrung!\"\n\nHe folded his hands with a droll air of penitence.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" he said, \"I'm always, as the church service says, doing\nthose things I ought not to do.\"\n\nMiss Chesney laughed, a trifle nervously.\n\n\"Oh, I forgive you!\" she replied--\"On condition that you sing.\"\n\n\"I obey!\" and with that he turned again to the piano, and playing a\nstrange wild minor accompaniment sang the following stanzas:\n\n      Sleep, my Belov\u00c3\u00abd, sleep!\n      Be patient!--we shall keep\n      Our secret closely hid\n      Beneath the coffin-lid,--\n  There is no other place in earth or air\n  For such a love as ours, or such despair!\n  And neither hell nor heaven shall care to win\n  Our loath\u00c3\u00abd souls, rejoicing in their sin!\n\n      Sleep!--for my hand is sure,--\n      The cold steel bright and pure\n      Strikes through thy heart and mine\n      Shedding our blood like wine;--\n  Sin's sweetness is too sweet, and if the shame\n  Of love must be our curse, we hurl the blame\n  Back on the gods who gave us love with breath\n  And tortured us from passion into death!\n\nThis strange song, sung in the most glorious of baritones, full and\nrich, and vibrating with power and sweetness, had a visibly thrilling\neffect upon us all. Again we were struck dumb with surprise and\nsomething like fear,--and again Diana Chesney broke the silence.\n\n\"You call that simple!\" she said, half petulantly.\n\n\"Quite so. Love and Death are the simplest things in the world\"--replied\nLucio.--\"The ballad is a mere trifle,--it is entitled 'The Last\nLove-Song' and is supposed to be the utterance of a lover about to kill\nhis mistress and himself. Such events happen every day,--you know that\nby the newspapers,--they are perfectly common-place----\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a sharp clear voice ringing imperatively across\nthe room--\n\n\"Where did you learn that song?\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nIt was the paralysed Countess who spoke. She had managed to partly raise\nherself on her couch, and her face expressed positive terror. Her\nhusband hurried to her side,--and, with a curiously cynical smile on his\nlips, Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez rose from the piano. Miss Charlotte, who had sat rigidly\nupright and silent for some time, hastened to attend upon her sister,\nbut Lady Elton was singularly excited, and appeared to have gained a\nsudden access of unnatural vigour.\n\n\"Go away,--I'm not ill,\"--she said impatiently--\"I feel better,--much\nbetter than I have done for months. The music does me good.\" And\naddressing her husband, she added--\"Ask your friend to come and sit here\nby me,--I want to talk to him. He has a magnificent voice,--and--I know\nthat song he sang,--I remember reading it--in a manuscript album--long\nago. I want to know where he found it--\"\n\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez here advanced with his gentle tread and courteous bearing, and\nLord Elton gave him a chair beside the invalid.\n\n\"You are working miracles on my wife,\"--he said--\"I have not seen her so\nanimated for years.\"\n\nAnd leaving the two to talk, he crossed over to where Lady Sibyl, myself\nand Miss Chesney were all seated in a group, chatting more or less\nunrestrainedly.\n\n\"I have just been expressing the hope that you and your daughter will\npay me a visit at Willowsmere, Lord Elton,\" I said.\n\nHis brows contracted a little, but he forced a smile. \"We shall be\ndelighted,\"--he mumbled--\"when do you take possession?\"\n\n\"As soon as it is at all feasible\"--I replied--\"I shall wait in town\ntill the next Lev\u00c3\u00a9e is over, as both my friend and myself have arranged\nto be presented.\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes!--er--yes! That is always advisable. And it's not half such\na troublesome business as a Drawing-room is for the ladies. It's soon\nover,--and low bodices are not _de rigeur_--ha--ha--ha! Who is your\npresenter?\"\n\nI named a distinguished personage, closely connected with the Court, and\nthe Earl nodded.\n\n\"A very good man,--you could not have a better\"--he said\ncomplacently--\"And this book of yours,--when does it come out?\"\n\n\"Next week.\"\n\n\"We must get it,--we must certainly get it,\"--said Lord Elton, assuming\ninterest,--\"Sybil, you must put it down on your library list.\"\n\nShe assented, though, as I thought a trifle indifferently.\n\n\"On the contrary you must allow me to present it to you;\" I said--\"It\nwill be a pleasure to me which I hope you will not deny.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\"--she answered, lifting her beautiful eyes to mine\nas she spoke--\"But the librarian at Mudie's is sure to send it--he knows\nI read everything. Though I confess I never buy any books except those\nby Mavis Clare.\"\n\nAgain that woman's name! I felt annoyed, but took care not to show my\nannoyance.\n\n\"I shall be jealous of Mavis Clare,\" I said playfully.\n\n\"Most men are!\" she replied quietly.\n\n\"You are indeed an enthusiastic partisan of hers!\" I exclaimed, somewhat\nsurprised.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I am. I like to see any member of my sex distinguish\nherself as nobly as she does. I have no genius of my own, and that is\none of the reasons why I honour it so much in other women.\"\n\nI was about to make some suitable compliment by way of response to this\nremark, when we were all violently startled from our seats by a most\nhorrible cry,--a gasping scream such as might be wrung from some\ntortured animal. Aghast at the sound we stood for a moment inert,\nstaring at Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, who came quickly towards us with an air of grave\nconcern.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said softly--\"that the Countess is not so\nwell,--perhaps you had better go to her--\"\n\nAnother shriek interrupted his words, and transfixed with horror we saw\nLady Elton struggling in the throes of some sudden and terrific\nconvulsion, her hands beating the air as if she were fighting with an\nunseen enemy. In one second her face underwent such hideous contortions\nas robbed it of all human semblance, and between the agonized pantings\nof her difficult breath, her half-choked voice could be heard uttering\nwild cries--\n\n\"Mercy!--mercy!--oh God--God! Tell Sibyl!--pray--pray to God,--pray--\"\n\nAnd with that she fell heavily back, speechless and unconscious.\n\nAll was instant confusion. Lady Sibyl rushed to her mother's side, with\nMiss Charlotte,--Diana Chesney hung back trembling and afraid,--Lord\nElton sprang to the bell and rang it furiously.\n\n\"Fetch the doctor!\" he cried to the startled servant--\"Lady Elton has\nhad another shock! She must be taken to her room at once!\"\n\n\"Can I be of any service?\" I inquired, with a side-glance at Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,\nwho stood gravely apart, a statuesquely composed figure of silence.\n\n\"No no,--thanks all the same!\" and the Earl pressed my hand\ngratefully--\"She should not have come downstairs,--it has been too\nexciting for her. Sybil, don't look at her, my dear--it will only\nunnerve you,--Miss Chesney, pray go to your room,--Charlotte can do all\nthat is possible----\"\n\nAs he spoke two of the men-servants came in to carry the insensible\nCountess upstairs,--and as they slowly bore her on her coffin-like\ncouch past me, one of them drew the coverlet across her face to conceal\nit. But not so quickly that I could not see the awful change impressed\nupon it,--the indelible horror that was stamped on the drawn\nfeatures,--horror such as surely never was seen except in a painter's\nidea of some lost soul in torment. The eyes were rolled up and fixed in\ntheir sockets like balls of glass, and in them also was frozen the same\nfrenzied desperate look of fear. It was a dreadful face!--so dreadful in\nits ghastly immovableness that I was all at once reminded of my hideous\nvision of the previous night, and the pallid countenances of the three\nphantoms that had scared me in my sleep. Lady Elton's looks now\nresembled theirs! Sickened and appalled I averted my eyes, and was glad\nto see Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez taking farewell of his host, the while he expressed his\nregret and sympathy with him in his domestic affliction. I myself,\napproaching Lady Sibyl, pressed her cold and trembling hand in mine, and\nrespectfully kissed it.\n\n\"I am deeply sorry!\" I murmured--\"I wish I could do anything to console\nyou!\"\n\nShe looked at me with dry calm eyes.\n\n\"Thank-you. But the doctors have always said that my mother would have\nanother shock depriving her of speech. It is very sad; she will probably\nlive for some years like that.\"\n\nI again expressed my sympathy.\n\n\"May I come and inquire about you all to-morrow?\" I asked.\n\n\"It will be very kind of you,\"--she answered quietly.\n\n\"Shall I see you if I come?\" I said in a lower tone.\n\n\"If you wish it,--certainly!\"\n\nOur eyes met; and I knew by instinct that she read my thoughts. I\npressed her hand again and was not repulsed,--then bowing profoundly, I\nleft her to make my adieux to Lord Elton and Miss Chesney, who seemed\nterribly upset and frightened. Miss Charlotte Fitzroy had left the room\nin attendance on her sister, and she did not return to bid us\ngood-night. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez lingered a moment behind me to say another word or\ntwo to the Earl, and when he joined me in the hall and threw on his\nopera-coat, he was smiling to himself somewhat singularly.\n\n\"An unpleasant end for Helena, Countess of Elton\"--he said, when we were\nin our brougham, driving away--\"Paralysis is perhaps the worst of all\nthe physical punishments that can befall a 'rapid' lady.\"\n\n\"Was she 'rapid'?\"\n\n\"Well,--perhaps 'rapid' is too mild a term, but I can find no\nother;\"--he answered--\"When she was young,--she is barely fifty\nnow,--she did everything that could be done by woman at her worst and\nwildest. She had scores of lovers,--and I believe one of them cleared\noff her husband's turf-debts,--the Earl consenting gladly,--on a rather\npressing occasion.\"\n\n\"What disgraceful conduct!\" I exclaimed.\n\nHe looked at me with an expression of cynical amusement.\n\n\"Think so? The 'upper ten' quite condone that sort of thing in their own\nset now-a-days. It is all right. If a lady has lovers, and her husband\nbeams benevolence on the situation what can be said? Nothing. How very\ntender your conscience is, Geoffrey!\"\n\nI sat silent, thinking. My companion lit a cigarette and offered me one.\nI took it mechanically without lighting it.\n\n\"I made a mistake this evening,\"--he went on--\"I should not have sung\nthat 'Last Love-song.' The fact is, the words were written by one of her\nladyship's former admirers, a man who was something of a poet in his\nway,--and she had an idea that she was the only person living who had\never seen the lines. She wanted to know if I knew the man who composed\nthem, and I was able to say that I did--very intimately. I was just\nexplaining how it was, and why I knew him so well, when the distressing\nattack of convulsions came on, and finished our conversation.\"\n\n\"She looked horrible!\" I said.\n\n\"The paralysed Helen of a modern Troy? Yes,--her countenance at the last\nwas certainly not attractive. Beauty combined with wantonness\nfrequently ends in the drawn twitch, fixed eye and helpless limbs of\nlife-in-death. It is Nature's revenge on the outraged body,--and do you\nknow, Eternity's revenge on the impure Soul is extremely similar?\"\n\n\"What do you know about it?\" I said, smiling in spite of myself as I\nlooked at his fine face, expressive of perfect health and splendid\nintellectuality--\"Your absurd fancies about the soul are the only traces\nof folly I discover in you.\"\n\n\"Really? Well I am glad I have something of the fool in my\ndisposition,--foolishness being the only quality that makes wisdom\npossible. I confess I have odd, very odd notions about the soul.\"\n\n\"I will excuse them--\" I said, laughing--God forgive me, in my own\ninsensate blind conceit,--the while he regarded me fixedly--\"In fact I\nwill excuse anything for the sake of your voice. I do not flatter you,\nLucio,--you sing like an angel.\"\n\n\"Don't use impossible comparisons;\"--he replied--\"Have you ever heard an\nangel sing?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I answered smiling--\"I have,--this very night!\"\n\nHe turned deadly pale.\n\n\"A very open compliment!\" he said, forcing a laugh,--and with almost\nrough haste, he suddenly let down the window of the carriage though the\nnight was bitter cold--\"This vehicle is suffocating me,--let us have\nsome air. See how the stars are shining!--like great crown\njewels--Deity's regalia! Hard frost, like hard times, brings noble works\ninto prominence. Yonder, far off, is a star you can hardly perceive; red\nas a cinder at times and again blue as the lightning,--I can always\ndiscover it, though many cannot. It is Algol,--judged by superstitious\nfolk to be an evil star. I love it chiefly on account of its bad\nreputation,--it is no doubt much maligned. It may be a cold quarter of\nhell where weeping spirits sit frozen in ice made of their own congealed\ntears,--or it may be a preparatory school for Heaven--who knows! Yonder\ntoo, shines Venus,--your star Geoffrey!--for you are in love my\nfriend!--come confess it! are you not?\"\n\n\"I am not sure;\"--I answered slowly--\"The phrase 'in love' scarcely\ndescribes my present feeling....\"\n\n\"You have dropped these,\"--he said suddenly, picking up a fast fading\nknot of violets from the floor of the brougham and holding them towards\nme. He smiled, as I uttered an exclamation of annoyance. They were Lady\nSibyl's flowers which I had inadvertently let fall, and I saw he knew\nit. I took them from his hand in silence.\n\n\"My dear fellow, do not try to hide your intentions from your best\nfriend,\"--he said seriously and kindly--\"You wish to marry the Earl of\nElton's beautiful daughter, and you shall. Trust me!--I will do\neverything I can to promote your desire.\"\n\n\"You will?\" I exclaimed with unconcealed delight, for I fully recognised\nthe influence he had over Sibyl's father.\n\n\"I will, I promise--\" he answered gravely--\"I assure you that such a\nmarriage would be one after my own heart. I'll do all I can for\nyou,--and I have made many matches in my time!\"\n\nMy heart beat high with triumph,--and when we parted that night I wrung\nhis hand fervently and told him I was devoutly grateful to the fates for\nsending me such a good friend as he was.\n\n\"Grateful to--whom did you say?\" he asked with a whimsical look.\n\n\"To the Fates!\"\n\n\"Are you really? They are very ugly sisters I believe. Perhaps they were\nyour ghostly visitors of last night!\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"Ah! God never forbids the fulfilment of His own laws!\" he answered--\"To\ndo so He would have to destroy Himself.\"\n\n\"If He exists at all!\" I said carelessly.\n\n\"True! If--!\"\n\nAnd with this, we separated to our different quarters in the 'Grand.'\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nAfter that evening I became a regular and welcome visitor at Lord\nElton's house, and was soon on terms of the most friendly intimacy with\nall the members of his family, including even the severely pious Miss\nCharlotte Fitzroy. It was not difficult for me to see that my\nmatrimonial aspirations were suspected,--and though the encouragement I\nreceived from Lady Sibyl herself was so slight as to make me doubtful\nwhether after all my hopes of winning her would ever be realized, the\nEarl made no secret of his delight at the idea of securing me as a\nson-in-law. Such wealth as mine was not to be met with every day,--and\neven had I been a blackleg of the turf or a retired jockey, instead of\nan 'author,' I should, with five millions at my back, have been\nconsidered quite as desirable a suitor for the Lady Sibyl's hand.\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez scarcely ever went with me to the Eltons' now, pleading as\nexcuse much pressing business and many social engagements. I was not\naltogether sorry for this. Greatly as I admired and honoured him, his\nextraordinary physical beauty and fascination of manner were in\ndangerous contrast to my merely 'ordinary good-looking' personality, and\nit seemed to me impossible that any woman, seeing much of him, could be\nexpected to give me the preference. All the same I had no fear that he\nwould ever voluntarily become my rival,--his antipathy to women was too\ndeep-rooted and sincere for that. On this point indeed his feelings were\nso strong and passionate that I often wondered why the society sirens\nwho eagerly courted his attention remained so blind and unconscious to\nthe chill cynicism that lurked beneath his seeming courtesy,--the\ncutting satire that was coupled with apparent compliment, and the\nintensity of hatred that flamed under the assumed expression of admiring\nhomage in his flashing eyes. However it was not my business to point out\nto those who could not, or would not, see the endless peculiarities of\nmy friend's variable disposition. I did not pay much heed to them even\nso far as I myself was concerned, for I had grown accustomed to the\nquick changes he was wont to ring on all the gamut of human feeling, and\nabsorbed in my own life-schemes I did not trouble myself to intimately\nstudy the man who had in a couple of months become my _fidus Achates_. I\nwas engrossed at the moment in doing all I could to increase the Earl of\nElton's appreciative sense of my value as a man and a millionaire, and\nto this end I paid some of his pressing debts, lent him a large sum of\nmoney without demanding interest or promise of repayment, and stocked\nhis cellar with presents of such rare old wines as he had not been able\nto afford to purchase for himself for many years. Thus was confidence\neasily engendered between us, even to that point of affection which\ndisplayed itself in his lordship's readiness to thrust his arm through\nmine when we sauntered together down Piccadilly, and his calling me 'my\ndear boy' in public. Never shall I forget the bewildered amazement of\nthe scrubby little editor of a sixpenny magazine who met me face to face\nthus accompanied in the Park one morning! That he knew the Earl of Elton\nby sight was evident, and that he also knew me his apoplectic stare\nconfessed. He had pompously refused to even read any of my offered\ncontributions on the ground that I had 'no name,'--and now--! he would\nhave given a month's salary if I had but condescended to recognize him!\nI did not so condescend,--but passed him by, listening to, and laughing\nwith my intended future father-in-law, who was retailing an extremely\nancient joke for my benefit. The incident was slight, even\ntrumpery,--yet it put me in a good humour, for one of the chiefest\npleasures I had out of my wealth was the ability to repay with vengeful\ninterest all the contempt and insult that had beaten me back from every\nchance of earning a livelihood while I was poor.\n\nIn all my visits to the Eltons, I never saw the paralysed Countess\nagain. Since the last terrible visitation of her dread disease, she had\nnot moved. She merely lived and breathed--no more. Lord Elton told me\nthat the worst part of her illness at present, so far as it affected\nthose who had to attend upon her, was the particularly hideous\nalteration of her face.\n\n\"The fact is,\" he said, not without a shudder--\"she's dreadful to look\nat,--positively dreadful!--no longer human, you know. She used to be a\nlovely woman,--now she is literally frightful. Her eyes\nespecially;--they are as scared and wild as if she had seen the devil.\nQuite an awful expression I assure you!--and it never alters. The\ndoctors can do nothing--and of course it's very trying for Sibyl, and\neverybody.\"\n\nI assented sympathetically; and realising that a house holding such a\nfigure of living death within it must of necessity be more or less\ngloomy and depressing to a young and vigorous nature, I lost no\nopportunity of giving Lady Sibyl whatever slight pleasures were in my\npower to procure, for her distraction and entertainment. Costly flowers,\nboxes for the opera and 'first nights' at the play,--every sort of\nattention that a man can pay to a woman without being considered\nofficious or intrusive I offered, and was not repulsed. Everything\nprogressed well and favourably towards the easy attainment of my\nwishes,--I had no difficulties, no troubles of any kind,--and I\nvoluntarily led a life of selfishly absorbed personal gratification,\nbeing commended and encouraged therein by a whole host of flatterers and\ninterested acquaintances. Willowsmere Court was mine, and every\nnewspaper in the kingdom had commented on the purchase, in either\nservile or spiteful paragraphs. My lawyers had warmly congratulated me\non the possession of so admirable a property which they, in strict\naccordance with what they conceived to be their duty, had personally\ninspected and approved. The place was now in the hands of a firm of\ndecorators and furnishers, recommended by Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, and it was expected\nto be in perfect order for my habitation in early summer, at which time\nI purposed entertaining a large house-party of more or less\ndistinguished people.\n\nMeantime, what I had once considered would be the great event of my\nlife, took place,--namely the publication of my book. Trumpeted forth by\nthe most heraldic advertisements, it was at last launched on the\nuncertain and fluctuating tide of public favour, and special 'advance'\ncopies were sent to the office of every magazine and journal in London.\nThe day after this was done, Lucio, as I now familiarly called him, came\nin to my room with a mysterious and mischievous air.\n\n\"Geoffrey,\" he said--\"I'm going to lend you five hundred pounds!\"\n\nI looked up with a smile.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nHe held out a cheque towards me. Glancing at it I saw that the sum he\nmentioned was filled in and endorsed with his signature, but that the\nname of the person to whom the money was to be made payable, had not yet\nbeen written.\n\n\"Well? What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means\"--replied he--\"that I am going to see Mr McWhing this morning.\nI have an appointment with him at twelve. You, as Geoffrey Tempest, the\nauthor of the book Mr McWhing is going to criticise and make a 'boom'\nof, could not possibly put your name to such a cheque. It would not be\n'good form'--it might crop up afterwards and so betray 'the secrets of\nthe prison-house.' But for me it is another affair. I am going to 'pose'\nas your businessman--your 'literary agent' who pockets ten per cent. of\nthe profits and wants to make a 'big thing' out of you, and I'm going to\ntalk the matter over with the perfectly practical McWhing who has, like\nevery true Scot, a keen eye for the main chance. Of course it will be in\nconfidence,--strict confidence!\" and he laughed--\"It's all a question of\nbusiness you know,--in these commercial days, literature has become a\ntrade like everything else, and even critics only work for what pays\nthem. As indeed why should they not?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me McWhing will take that five hundred?\" I asked\ndubiously.\n\n\"I mean to tell you nothing of the kind. I would not put the matter so\ncoarsely for the world! This money is not for McWhing,--it is for a\nliterary charity.\"\n\n\"Indeed! I thought you had an idea perhaps of offering a bribe....\"\n\n\"Bribe! Good Heavens! Bribe a critic! Impossible, my good\nGeoffrey!--such a thing was never heard of--never, never, never!\" and he\nshook his head and rolled up his eyes with infinite solemnity--\"No no!\nPress people never take money for anything--not even for 'booming' a new\ngold-mining company,--not even for putting a notice of a fashionable\nconcert into the Morning Post. Everything in the English press is the\njust expression of pure and lofty sentiment, believe me! This little\ncheque is for a charity of which Mr McWhing is chief patron,--you see\nthe Civil List pensions all go by favour to the wrong persons nowadays;\nto the keeping of lunatic versifiers and retired actresses who never\ncould act--the actual bona-fide 'genius' never gets anything out of\nGovernment, and moreover would scorn to take a farthing from that\npenurious body, which grudges him anything higher than a\nmoney-recognition. It is as great an insult to offer a beggarly pension\nof fifty or a hundred pounds a year to a really great writer as to give\nhim a knighthood,--and we cannot fall much lower than to be a knight, as\nknights go. The present five hundred pounds will help to relieve certain\n'poor and proud' but pressing literary cases known to McWhing alone!\"\nHis expression at this moment was so extraordinary, that I entirely\nfailed to fathom it. \"I have no doubt I shall be able to represent the\nbenevolent and respectable literary agent to perfection--of course I\nshall insist on my ten per cent.!\"--and he began laughing again. \"But I\ncan't stop to discuss the matter now with you--I'm off. I promised\nMcWhing to be with him at twelve o'clock precisely, and it's now\nhalf-past-eleven. I shall probably lunch with him, so don't wait for me.\nAnd concerning the five hundred, you needn't be in my debt an hour\nlonger than you like--I'll take a cheque for the money back from you\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"All right\"--I said--\"But perhaps the great oracle of the cliques will\nreject your proposals with scorn.\"\n\n\"If he does, then is Utopia realized!\"--replied Lucio, carefully drawing\non his gloves as he spoke--\"Where's a copy of your book? Ah--here's\none--smelling newly of the press,\" and he slipped the volume into his\novercoat pocket; \"Allow me, before departure, to express the opinion\nthat you are a singularly ungrateful fellow, Geoffrey! Here am I,\nperfectly devoted to your interests,--and despite my princedom actually\nprepared to 'pose' to McWhing as your 'acting manager' _pro tem_, and\nyou haven't so much as a thank-you to throw at me!\"\n\nHe stood before me smiling, the personification of kindness and good\nhumour. I laughed a little.\n\n\"McWhing will never take _you_ for an acting manager or literary\nagent,\"--I said--\"You don't look it. If I seem churlish I'm sorry--but\nthe fact is I am disgusted ...\"\n\n\"At what?\" he inquired, still smiling.\n\n\"Oh, at the humbug of everything,\"--I answered impatiently; \"The stupid\nfarce of it all. Why shouldn't a book get noticed on its own merits\nwithout any appeal to cliquism and influential wire-pulling on the\npress?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" and he delicately flicked a grain of dust off his coat while\nspeaking--\"And why shouldn't a man get received in society on his own\nmerits, without any money to recommend him or any influential friend to\nback him up?\"\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"The world is as it is made,\"--he went on, regarding me fixedly--\"It is\nmoved by the lowest and pettiest motives,--it works for the most\ntrivial, ridiculous and perishable aims. It is not a paradise. It is not\na happy family of united and affectionate brethren. It is an\nover-populated colony of jabbering and quarrelsome monkeys, who fancy\nthey are men. Philosophers in old days tried to teach it that the\nmonkey-type should be exterminated for the growth and encouragement of a\nnobler race,--but they preached in vain--there never were enough real\nmen alive to overcome the swarming majority of the beasts. God Himself,\nthey say, came down from Heaven to try and set wrong things right, and\nto restore if possible His own defaced image to the general aspect of\nhumanity,--and even He failed.\"\n\n\"There is very little of God in this world\"--I said bitterly; \"There is\nmuch more Devil!\"\n\nHe smiled,--a musing, dreamy smile that transfigured his countenance and\nmade him look like a fine Apollo absorbed in the thought of some new and\nglorious song.\n\n\"No doubt!\" he said, after a little pause--\"Mankind certainly prefer the\ndevil to any other deity,--therefore if they elect him as their\nrepresentative, it is scarcely to be wondered at that he governs where\nhe is asked to govern. And yet--do you know Geoffrey--this devil,--if\nthere is one,--can hardly, I think, be quite so bad as his detractors\nsay. I myself don't believe he is a whit worse than a nineteenth-century\nfinancier!\"\n\nI laughed aloud at the comparison.\n\n\"After that,\" I said--\"you had better go to McWhing. I hope you will\ntell him that I am the triple essence of all the newest 'discoveries'\nrolled into one!\"\n\n\"Never fear!\" returned Lucio,--\"I've learned all my stock-phrases by\nheart--a 'star of the first magnitude' etc.,--I've read the _Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_\ntill I've got the lingo of the literary auctioneer well-nigh perfect,\nand I believe I shall acquit myself admirably. Au revoir!\"\n\nHe was gone; and I, after a little desultory looking over my papers,\nwent out to lunch at Arthur's, of which club I was now a member. On my\nway I stopped to look in at a bookseller's window to see if my\n'immortal' production was yet on show. It was not,--and the volume put\nmost conspicuously to the front among all the 'newest books' was one\nentitled 'Differences. By Mavis Clare.' Acting on a sudden impulse I\nwent in to purchase it.\n\n\"Has this a good sale?\" I asked, as the volume was handed to me.\n\nThe clerk at the counter opened his eyes wide.\n\n\"Sale?\" he echoed--\"Well, I should think so--rather! Why everybody's\nreading it!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" and I turned over the uncut pages carelessly--\"I see no\nallusion whatever to it in the papers.\"\n\nThe clerk smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"No--and you're not likely to, sir\"--he said--\"Miss Clare is too popular\nto need reviews. Besides, a large number of the critics,--the\n'log-rollers' especially, are mad against her for her success, and the\npublic know it. Only the other day a man came in here from one of the\nbig newspaper offices and told me he was taking a few notes on the books\nwhich had the largest sales,--would I tell him which author's works were\nmost in demand? I said Miss Clare took the lead,--as she does,--and he\ngot into a regular rage. Said he--'That's the answer I've had all along\nthe line, and however true it is, it's no use to me because I dare not\nmention it. My editor would instantly scratch it out--he hates Miss\nClare.' 'A precious editor you've got!' I said, and he looked rather\nqueer. There's nothing like journalism, sir, for the suppression of\ntruth!\"\n\nI smiled, and went away with my purchase, convinced that I had wasted a\nfew shillings on a mere piece of woman's trash. If this Mavis Clare was\nindeed so 'popular,' then her work must naturally be of the 'penny\ndreadful' order, for I, like many another literary man, laboured under\nthe ludicrous inconsistency of considering the public an 'ass' while I\nmyself desired nothing so much as the said 'ass's' applause and\napproval!--and therefore I could not imagine it capable of voluntarily\nselecting for itself any good work of literature without guidance from\nthe critics. Of course I was wrong; the great masses of the public in\nall nations are always led by some instinctive sense of right, that\nmoves them to reject the false and unworthy, and select the true.\nCompletely prepared, like most men of my type to sneer and cavil at the\nbook, chiefly because it was written by a feminine hand, I sat down in a\nretired corner of the club reading-room, and began to cut and skim the\npages. I had not read many sentences before my heart sank with a heavy\nsense of fear and,--jealousy!--the slow fire of an insidious envy began\nto smoulder in my mind. What power had so gifted this author--this mere\n_woman_,--that she should dare to write better than I! And that she\nshould force me, by the magic of her pen to mentally acknowledge, albeit\nwith wrath and shame, my own inferiority! Clearness of thought,\nbrilliancy of style, beauty of diction, all these were hers, united to\nconsummate ease of expression and artistic skill,--and all at once, in\nthe very midst of reading, such a violent impulse of insensate rage\npossessed me that I flung the book down, dreading to go on with it. The\npotent, resistless, unpurchaseable quality of Genius!--ah, I was not yet\nso blinded by my own conceit as to be unable to recognize that divine\nfire when I saw it flashing up from every page as I saw it now; but, to\nbe compelled to give that recognition to a woman's work, galled and\nirritated me almost beyond endurance. Women, I considered, should be\nkept in their places as men's drudges or toys--as wives, mothers,\nnurses, cooks, menders of socks and shirts, and housekeepers\ngenerally,--what right had they to intrude into the realms of art and\nsnatch the laurels from their masters' brows! If I could but get the\nchance of reviewing this book, I thought to myself savagely!--I would\nmisquote, misrepresent, and cut it to shreds with a joy too great for\nwords! This Mavis Clare, 'unsexed,' as I at once called her in my own\nmind simply because she had the power I lacked,--wrote what she had to\nsay with a gracious charm, freedom, and innate consciousness of\nstrength,--a strength which forced me back upon myself and filled me\nwith the bitterest humiliation. Without knowing her I hated her,--this\nwoman who could win fame without the aid of money, and who was crowned\nso brightly and visibly to the world that she was beyond criticism. I\ntook up her book again and tried to cavil at it,--over one or two dainty\nbits of poetic simile and sentiment I laughed,--enviously. When I left\nthe club later in the day, I took the book with me, divided between a\ncurious desire to read it honestly through with justice to it and its\nauthor, and an impulse to tear it asunder and fling it into the road to\nbe crushed in the mud under rolling cab and cart wheels. In this strange\nhumour Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez found me, when at about four o'clock he returned from his\nmission to David McWhing, smiling and--triumphant.\n\n\"Congratulate me Geoffrey!\" he exclaimed as he entered my\nroom--\"Congratulate me, and yourself! I am _minus_ the five hundred\npound cheque I showed you this morning!\"\n\n\"McWhing has pocketed it then,\"--I said sullenly--\"All right! Much good\nmay it do him, and his 'charity'!\"\n\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez gave me a quick observant glance.\n\n\"Why, what has happened to you since we parted?\" he inquired, throwing\noff his overcoat and sitting down opposite to me--\"You seem out of\ntemper! Yet you ought to be a perfectly happy man--for your highest\nambition is about to be gratified. You said you wished to make your book\nand yourself 'the talk of London,'--well, within the next two or three\nweeks you will see yourself praised in a very large number of\ninfluential newspapers as the newest discovered 'genius' of the day,\nonly a little way removed from Shakespeare himself (three of the big\nleading magazines are guaranteed to say that) and all this through the\naffability of Mr McWhing, and the trifling sum of five hundred pounds!\nAnd are you not satisfied? Really, my friend, you are becoming\ndifficult!--I warned you that too much good fortune spoils a man.\"\n\nWith a sudden movement I flung down Mavis Clare's book before him.\n\n\"Look at this\"--I said--\"Does _she_ pay five hundred pounds to David\nMcWhing's charity?\"\n\nHe took up the volume and glanced at it.\n\n\"Certainly not. But then,--she gets slandered--not criticized!\"\n\n\"What does that matter!\" I retorted--\"The man from whom I bought this\nbook says that everybody is reading it.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" and Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez surveyed me with a curious expression, half of\npity, half of amusement--\"But you know the old axiom, my dear\nGeoffrey?--'you may lead a horse to the water but you cannot make him\ndrink.' Which statement, interpreted for the present occasion, means\nthat though certain log-rollers, headed by our estimable friend McWhing,\nmay drag the horse--i.e. the public, up to their own particularly\nprepared literary trough, they cannot force it to swallow the mixture.\nThe horse frequently turns tail and runs away in search of its own\nprovender,--it has done so in the case of Miss Clare. When the public\nchoose an author for themselves, it is a dreadful thing of course for\nother authors,--but it really can't be helped!\"\n\n\"Why should they choose Mavis Clare?\" I demanded gloomily.\n\n\"Ah, why indeed!\" he echoed smiling--\"McWhing would tell you they do it\nout of sheer idiotcy;--the public would answer that they choose her\nbecause she has genius.\"\n\n\"Genius!\" I repeated scornfully--\"The public are perfectly incapable of\nrecognizing such a quality!\"\n\n\"You think so?\" he said still smiling--\"you really think so? In that\ncase it's very odd isn't it, how everything that is truly great in art\nand literature becomes so widely known and honoured, not only in this\ncountry but in every civilized land where people think or study? You\nmust remember that all the very famous men and women have been steadily\n'written down' in their day, even to the late English Laureate,\nTennyson, who was 'criticized' for the most part in the purest\nBillingsgate,--it is only the mediocrities who are ever 'written up.' It\nseems as if the stupid public really had a hand in selecting these\n'great,' for the reviewers would never stand them at any price, till\ndriven to acknowledge them by the popular _force majeure_. But\nconsidering the barbarous want of culture and utter foolishness of the\npublic, Geoffrey, what _I_ wonder at, is that you should care to appeal\nto it at all!\"\n\nI sat silent,--inwardly chafing under his remarks.\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he resumed, rising and taking a white flower from one of\nthe vases on the table to pin in his button-hole--\"that Miss Clare is\ngoing to be a thorn in your side, my friend! A man rival in literature\nis bad enough,--but a woman rival is too much to endure with any amount\nof patience! However you may console yourself with the certainty that\n_she_ will never get 'boomed,'--while you--thanks to my tender fostering\nof the sensitive and high-principled McWhing, will be the one delightful\nand unique 'discovery' of the press for at least one month, perhaps two,\nwhich is about as long as any 'new star of the first magnitude' lasts in\nthe latter-day literary skies. Shooting-stars all of them!--such as poor\nold forgotten B\u00c3\u00a9ranger sang of--\n\n                \"les etoiles qui filent,\n  'Qui filent,--qui filent--et disparaissent!'\"\n\n\"Except--Mavis Clare!\" I said.\n\n\"True! Except Mavis Clare!\" and he laughed aloud,--a laugh that jarred\nupon me because there was a note of mockery in it--\"She is a small\nfixture in the vast heavens,--or so it seems--revolving very contentedly\nand smoothly in her own appointed orbit,--but she is not and never will\nbe attended by the brilliant meteor-flames that will burst round _you_,\nmy excellent fellow, at the signal of McWhing! Fie Geoffrey!--get over\nyour sulks! Jealous of a woman! Be ashamed,--is not woman the inferior\ncreature?, and shall the mere spectre of a feminine fame cause a\nfive-fold millionaire to abase his lofty spirit in the dust? Conquer\nyour strange fit of the spleen, Geoffrey, and join me at dinner!\"\n\nHe laughed again as he left the room,--and again his laughter irritated\nme. When he had gone, I gave way to the base and unworthy impulse that\nhad for some minutes been rankling within me, and sitting down at my\nwriting table, penned a hasty note to the editor of a rather powerful\nmagazine, a man whom I had formerly known and worked for. He was aware\nof my altered fortunes and the influential position I now occupied, and\nI felt confident he would be glad to oblige me in any matter if he\ncould. My letter, marked '_private and confidential_' contained the\nrequest that I might be permitted to write for his next number, an\nanonymous 'slashing' review of the new novel entitled 'Differences' by\nMavis Clare.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nIt is almost impossible for me to describe the feverish, irritated and\ncontradictory state of mind in which I now began to pass my days. With\nthe absolute fixity of my fortunes, my humours became more changeful\nthan the wind, and I was never absolutely contented for two hours\ntogether. I joined in every sort of dissipation common to men of the\nday, who with the usual inanity of noodles, plunged into the filth of\nlife merely because to be morally dirty was also at the moment\nfashionable and much applauded by society. I gambled recklessly, solely\nfor the reason that gambling was considered by many leaders of the\n'upper ten' as indicative of 'manliness' and 'showing _grit_.'\n\n\"I hate a fellow who grudges losing a few pounds at play,\"--said one of\nthese 'distinguished' titled asses to me once--\"It shows such a cowardly\nand currish disposition.\"\n\nGuided by this 'new' morality, and wishing to avoid the possibility of\nbeing called \"cowardly and currish,\" I indulged in baccarat and other\nruinous games almost every night, willingly losing the 'few pounds'\nwhich in my case meant a few hundreds, for the sake of my occasional\nwinnings, which placed a number of 'noble' rakes and blue-blooded\nblacklegs in my power for 'debts of honour,' which are supposed to be\nmore strictly attended to and more punctually paid than any debts in the\nworld, but which, as far as I am concerned, are still owing. I also\nbetted heavily, on everything that could be made the subject of a\nbet,--and not to be behind my peers in 'style' and 'knowledge of the\nworld' I frequented low houses and allowed a few half-nude brandy-soaked\ndancers and vulgar music-hall 'artistes' to get a couple of thousand\npounds worth of jewels out of me, because this sort of thing was called\n'seeing life' and was deemed part of a 'gentleman's' diversion.\nHeavens!--what beasts we all were, I and my aristocratic boon\ncompanions!--what utterly worthless, useless, callous scoundrels!--and\nyet,--we associated with the best and the highest in the land;--the\nfairest and noblest ladies in London received us in their houses with\nsmiles and softly-worded flatteries--we--whose presence reeked with\nvice; we, 'young men of fashion' whom, if he had known our lives as they\nwere, an honest cobbler working patiently for daily bread, might have\nspat upon, in contempt and indignation that such low rascals should be\npermitted to burden the earth! Sometimes, but very seldom, Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez\njoined our gambling and music-hall parties, and on such occasions I\nnoticed that he, as it were, 'let himself go' and became the wildest of\nus all. But though wild he was never coarse,--as _we_ were; his deep and\nmellow laughter had a sonorous richness in it that was totally unlike\nthe donkey's 'hee-haw' of our 'cultured' mirth,--his manners were never\nvulgar; and his fluent discourse on men and things, now witty and\nsatirical, now serious almost to pathos, strangely affected many of\nthose who heard him talk, myself most of all. Once, I remember, when we\nwere returning late from some foolish carouse,--I with three young sons\nof English peers, and Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez walking beside us,--we came upon a poorly\nclad girl sobbing and clinging to the iron railing outside a closed\nchurch door.\n\n\"Oh God!\" she wailed--\"Oh dear God! Do help me!\"\n\nOne of my companions seized her by the arm with a lewd jest, when all at\nonce Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez stepped between.\n\n\"Leave her alone!\" he said sternly--\"Let her find God if she can!\"\n\nThe girl looked up at him terrified, her eyes streaming with tears, and\nhe dropped two or three gold pieces into her hand. She broke out crying\nafresh.\n\n\"Oh God bless you!\" she cried wildly--\"God bless you!\"\n\nHe raised his hat and stood uncovered in the moonlight, his dark beauty\nsoftened by a strangely wistful expression.\n\n\"I thank you!\" he said simply--\"You make me your debtor.\"\n\nAnd he passed on; we followed, somewhat subdued and silenced, though one\nof my lordling friends sniggered idiotically.\n\n\"You paid dearly for that blessing, Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez!\" he said--\"You gave her\nthree sovereigns;--by Jove! I'd have had something more than a blessing\nif I had been you.\"\n\n\"No doubt!\" returned Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez--\"You deserve more,--much more! I hope you\nwill get it! A blessing would be of no advantage whatever to _you_;--it\nis, to _me_.\"\n\nHow often I have thought of this incident since! I was too dense to\nattach either meaning or importance to it then,--self-absorbed as I was,\nI paid no attention to circumstances which seemed to have no connection\nwith my own life and affairs. And in all my dissipations and so-called\namusements, a perpetual restlessness consumed me,--I obtained no real\nsatisfaction out of anything except my slow and somewhat tantalizing\ncourtship of Lady Sibyl. She was a strange girl; she knew my intentions\ntowards her well enough; yet she affected not to know. Each time I\nventured to treat her with more than the usual deference, and to infuse\nsomething of the ardour of a lover into my looks or manner, she feigned\nsurprise. I wonder why it is that some women are so fond of playing the\nhypocrite in love? Their own instinct teaches them when men are amorous;\nbut unless they can run the fox to earth, or in other words, reduce\ntheir suitors to the lowest pitch of grovelling appeal, and force them\nto such abasement that the poor passion-driven fools are ready to fling\naway life, and even honour, dearer than life, for their sakes, their\nvanity is not sufficiently gratified. But who, or what am I that I\nshould judge of vanity,--I whose egregious and flagrant self-approbation\nwas of such a character that it blinded me to the perception and\ncomprehension of everything in which my own Ego was not represented! And\nyet,--with all the morbid interest I took in myself, my surroundings, my\ncomfort, my social advancement, there was one thing which soon became a\ntorture to me,--a veritable despair and loathing,--and this, strange to\nsay, was the very triumph I had most looked forward to as the crown and\nsummit of all my ambitious dreams. My book,--the book I had presumed to\nconsider a work of genius,--when it was launched on the tide of\npublicity and criticism, resolved itself into a sort of literary monster\nthat haunted my days and nights with its hateful presence; the thick,\nblack-lettered, lying advertisements scattered broadcast by my\npublisher, flared at me with an offensive insistence in every paper I\ncasually opened. And the praise of the reviewers! ... the exaggerated,\npreposterous, fraudulent 'boom'! Good God!--how sickening it was!--how\nfulsome! Every epithet of flattery bestowed upon me filled me with\ndisgust, and one day when I took up a leading magazine and saw a long\narticle upon the 'extraordinary brilliancy and promise' of my book,\ncomparing me to a new \u00c3\u0086schylus and Shakespeare combined, with the\nsignature of David McWhing appended to it, I could have thrashed that\nerudite and assuredly purchased Scot within an inch of his life. The\nchorus of eulogy was well-nigh universal; I was the 'genius of the\nday'--the 'hope of the future generation,'--I was the \"Book of the\nMonth,\"--the greatest, the wittiest, most versatile, most brilliant\nscribbling pigmy that had ever honoured a pot of ink by using it! Of\ncourse I figured as McWhing's 'discovery,'--five hundred pounds bestowed\non his mysterious 'charity' had so sharpened his eyesight that he had\nperceived me shining brightly on the literary horizon before anyone else\nhad done so. The press followed his 'lead' obediently,--for though the\npress,--the English press at least,--is distinctly unbribable, the\nowners of newspapers are not insensible to the advantages of largely\npaying advertisements. Moreover, when Mr McWhing announced me as his\n'find' in the oracular style which distinguished him, some other\nliterary gentlemen came forward and wrote effective articles about me,\nand sent me their compositions carefully marked. I took the hint,--wrote\nat once to thank them, and invited them to dinner. They came, and\nfeasted royally with Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez and myself;--(one of them wrote an 'Ode' to\nme afterwards),--and at the conclusion of the revels, we sent two of the\n'oracles' home, considerably overcome by champagne, in a carriage with\nAmiel to look after them, and help them out at their own doors. And my\n'boom' expanded,--London 'talked' as I had said it should; the growling\nmonster metropolis discussed me and my work in its own independent and\npeculiar fashion. The 'upper ten' subscribed to the circulating\nlibraries, and these admirable institutions made a two or three hundred\ncopies do for all demands, by the simple expedient of keeping\nsubscribers waiting five or six weeks till they grew tired of asking for\nthe book, and forgot all about it. Apart from the libraries, the public\ndid not take me up. From the glowing criticisms that appeared in all the\npapers, it might have been supposed that 'everybody who was anybody' was\nreading my 'wonderful' production. Such however was not the case. People\nspoke of me as 'the great millionaire,' but they were indifferent to the\nbid I had made for literary fame. The remark they usually made to me\nwherever I went was--\"You have written a novel, haven't you? What an odd\nthing for _you_ to do!\"--this, with a laugh;--\"I haven't read it,--I've\nso little time--I must ask for it at the library.\" Of course a great\nmany never did ask, not deeming it worth their while; and I whose money,\ncombined with the resistless influence of Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, had started the\nfavourable criticisms that flooded the press, found out that the\nmajority of the public never read criticisms at all. Hence, my anonymous\nreview of Mavis Clare's book made no effect whatever on _her_\npopularity, though it appeared in the most prominent manner. It was a\nsheer waste of labour,--for everywhere this woman author was still\nlooked upon as a creature of altogether finer clay than ordinary, and\nstill her book was eagerly devoured and questioned and admired; and\nstill it sold by thousands, despite a lack of all favourable criticism\nor prominent advertisement. No one guessed that I had written what I am\nnow perfectly willing to admit was a brutally wanton misrepresentation\nof her work,--no one, except Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez. The magazine in which it appeared\nwas a notable one, circulating in every club and library, and he, taking\nit up casually one afternoon, turned to that article at once.\n\n\"You wrote this!\" he said, fixing his eyes upon me,--\"It must have been\na great relief to your mind!\"\n\nI said nothing.\n\nHe read on in silence for a little; then laying down the magazine looked\nat me with a curiously scrutinizing expression.\n\n\"There are some human beings so constituted,\" he said, \"that if they had\nbeen with Noah in the ark according to the silly old legend, they would\nhave shot the dove bearing the olive-leaf, directly it came in sight\nover the waste of waters. You are of that type Geoffrey.\"\n\n\"I do not see the force of your comparison,\" I murmured.\n\n\"Do you not? Why, what harm has this Mavis Clare done to you? Your\npositions are entirely opposed. You are a millionaire; she is a\nhard-working woman dependent on her literary success for a livelihood,\nand you, rolling in wealth do your best to deprive her of the means of\nexistence. Does this redound to your credit? She has won her fame by her\nown brain and energy alone,--and even if you dislike her book need you\nabuse her personally as you have done in this article? You do not know\nher; you have never seen her, ...\"\n\n\"I hate women who write!\" I said vehemently.\n\n\"Why? Because they are able to exist independently? Would you have them\nall the slaves of man's lust or convenience? My dear Geoffrey, you are\nunreasonable. If you admit that you are jealous of this woman's\ncelebrity and grudge it to her, then I can understand your spite, for\njealousy is capable of murdering a fellow-creature with either the\ndagger or the pen.\"\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Is the book such wretched stuff as you make it out to be?\" he asked\npresently.\n\n\"I suppose some people might admire it,\"--I said curtly, \"I do not.\"\n\nThis was a lie; and of course he knew it was a lie. The work of Mavis\nClare had excited my most passionate envy,--while the very fact that\nSibyl Elton had read her book before she had thought of looking at mine,\nhad accentuated the bitterness of my feelings.\n\n\"Well,\" said Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez at last, smiling as he finished reading my\nonslaught--\"all I can say Geoffrey, is that this will not touch Mavis\nClare in the least. You have overshot the mark, my friend! Her public\nwill simply cry \"what a shame!\" and clamour for her work more than ever.\nAnd as for the woman herself,--she has a merry heart, and she will laugh\nat it. You must see her some day.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see her,\" I said.\n\n\"Probably not. But you will scarcely be able to avoid doing so when you\nlive at Willowsmere Court.\"\n\n\"One is not obliged to know everybody in the neighbourhood,\"--I observed\nsuperciliously.\n\nLucio laughed aloud.\n\n\"How well you carry your fortunes, Geoffrey!\" he said--\"For a poor devil\nof a Grub-street hack who lately was at a loss for a sovereign, how\nperfectly you follow the fashions of your time! If there is one man more\nthan another that moves me to wondering admiration it is he who asserts\nhis wealth strenuously in the face of his fellows, and who comports\nhimself in this world as though he could bribe death and purchase the\ngood-will of the Creator. It is such splendid effrontery,--such\nsuperlative pride! Now I, though over-wealthy myself, am so curiously\nconstituted that I cannot wear my bank-notes in my countenance as it\nwere,--I have put in a claim for intellect as well as gold,--and\nsometimes, do you know, in my travels round the world, I have been so\nfar honoured as to be taken for quite a poor man! Now _you_ will never\nhave that chance again;--you are rich and you look it!\"\n\n\"And you,--\" I interrupted him suddenly, and with some warmth--\"do you\nknow what _you_ look? You imply that I assert my wealth in my face; do\nyou know what _you_ assert in your every glance and gesture?\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine!\" he said smiling.\n\n\"Contempt for us all!\" I said--\"Immeasurable contempt,--even for me,\nwhom you call friend. I tell you the truth, Lucio,--there are times,\nwhen in spite of our intimacy I feel that you despise me. I daresay you\ndo; you have an extraordinary personality united to extraordinary\ntalents; you must not however expect all men to be as self-restrained\nand as indifferent to human passions as yourself.\"\n\nHe gave me a swift, searching glance.\n\n\"Expect!\" he echoed--\"My good fellow, I expect nothing at all,--from\nmen. They, on the contrary,--at least all those _I_ know--expect\neverything from me. And they get it,--generally. As for 'despising' you,\nhave I not said that I admire you? I do. I think there is something\npositively stupendous in the brilliant progress of your fame and rapid\nsocial success.\"\n\n\"My fame!\" I repeated bitterly--\"How has it been obtained? What is it\nworth?\"\n\n\"That is not the question;\" he retorted with a little smile; \"How\nunpleasant it must be for you to have these gouty twinges of conscience\nGeoffrey! Of course no fame is actually worth much now-a-days,--because\nit is not classic fame, strong in reposeful old-world dignity,--it is\nblatant noisy notoriety merely. But yours, such as it is, is perfectly\nlegitimate, judged by its common-sense commercial aspect, which is the\nonly aspect in which anyone looks at anything. You must bear in mind\nthat no one works out of disinterestedness in the present age,--no\nmatter how purely benevolent an action may appear on the surface, Self\nlies at the bottom of it. Once grasp this fact, and you will perceive\nthat nothing could be fairer or more straightforward than the way you\nhave obtained your fame. You have not 'bought' the incorruptible British\nPress; you could not do that; that is impossible, for it is immaculate,\nand bristles stiffly all over with honourable principles. There is no\nEnglish paper existing that would accept a cheque for the insertion of a\nnotice or a paragraph; not one!\" His eyes twinkled merrily,--then he\nwent on--\"No,--it is only the Foreign Press that is corrupt, so the\nBritish Press says;--John Bull looks on virtuously aghast at journalists\nwho, in dire stress of poverty, will actually earn a little extra pay\nfor writing something or somebody 'up' or 'down.' Thank Heaven, _he_\nemploys no such journalists; his pressmen are the very soul of\nrectitude, and will stoically subsist on a pound a week rather than take\nten for a casual job 'to oblige a friend.' Do you know Geoffrey, when\nthe Judgment Day arrives, who will be among the first saints to ascend\nto Heaven with the sounding of trumpets?\"\n\nI shook my head, half vexed, half amused.\n\n\"All the English (not foreign) editors and journalists!\" said Lucio with\nan air of pious rapture--\"and why? Because they are so good, so just, so\nunprejudiced! Their foreign brethren will be reserved for the eternal\ndance of devils of course--but the Britishers will pace the golden\nstreets singing Alleluia! I assure you I consider British journalists\ngenerally the noblest examples of incorruptibility in the world--they\ncome next to the clergy as representatives of virtue, and exponents of\nthe three evangelical counsels,--voluntary poverty, chastity, and\nobedience!\" Such mockery glittered in his eyes, that the light in them\nmight have been the reflection of clashing steel. \"Be consoled,\nGeoffrey,\" he resumed--\"your fame is honourably won. You have simply,\nthrough me, approached one critic who writes in about twenty newspapers\nand influences others to write in other twenty,--that critic being a\nnoble creature, (all critics are noble creatures) has a pet 'society'\nfor the relief of authors in need (a noble scheme you will own) and to\nthis charity I subscribe out of pure benevolence, five hundred pounds.\nMoved by my generosity and consideration, (particularly as I do not ask\nwhat becomes of the five hundred) McWhing 'obliges' me in a little\nmatter. The editors of the papers for which he writes accept him as a\nwise and witty personage; _they_ know nothing about the charity or the\ncheque,--it is not necessary for them to know. The whole thing is really\nquite a reasonable business arrangement;--it is only a self-tormenting\nanalyst like you who would stop to think of such a trifle a second\ntime.\"\n\n\"If McWhing really and conscientiously admired my book for itself;\" I\nbegan.\n\n\"Why should you imagine he does not?\" asked Lucio--\"Myself, I believe\nthat he is a perfectly sincere and honorable man. I think he means all\nhe says and writes. I consider that if he had found your work not worthy\nof his commendation, he would have sent me back that cheque for five\nhundred pounds, torn across in a noble scorn!\"\n\nAnd with this, throwing himself back in his chair, he laughed till the\ntears came into his eyes.\n\nBut I could not laugh; I was too weary and depressed. A heavy sense of\ndespair was on my mind; I felt that the hope which had cheered me in my\ndays of poverty,--the hope of winning real Fame, so widely different a\nthing to notoriety, had vanished. There was some quality in the subtle\nglory which could not be won by either purchase or influence. The praise\nof the press could not give it. Mavis Clare, working for her bread, had\nit,--I, with millions of money, had not. Like a fool I had thought to\nbuy it; I had yet to learn that all the best, greatest, purest and\nworthiest things in life are beyond all market-value and that the gifts\nof the gods are not for sale.\n\nAbout a fortnight after the publication of my book, we went to Court, my\ncomrade and I, and were presented by a distinguished officer connected\nwith the immediate and intimate surroundings of the Royal household. It\nwas a brilliant scene enough,--but, without doubt, the most brilliant\npersonage there was Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez. I was fairly startled at the stately and\nfascinating figure he made in his court suit of black velvet and steel\nornaments; accustomed as I was to his good looks, I had never seen them\nso enhanced by dress as on this occasion. I had been tolerably well\nsatisfied with my own appearance in the regulation costume till I saw\nhim; then my personal vanity suffered a decided shock, and I realized\nthat I merely served as a foil to show off and accentuate the superior\nattractions of my friend. But I was not envious of him in any way,--on\nthe contrary I openly expressed the admiration I frankly felt.\n\nHe seemed amused. \"My dear boy, it is all flunkeydom;\" he said--\"All\nsham and humbug. Look at this--\" and he drew his light court rapier from\nits sheath--\"There is no real use in this flimsy blade,--it is merely an\nemblem of dead chivalry. In old times, if a man insulted you, or\ninsulted a woman you admired, out flashed a shining point of tempered\nToledo steel that could lunge--so!\" and he threw himself into a fencing\nattitude of incomparable grace and ease--\"and you pricked the blackguard\nneatly through the ribs or arm and gave him cause to remember you. But\nnow--\" and he thrust the rapier back in its place--\"men carry toys like\nthese as a melancholy sign to show what bold fellows they were once, and\nwhat spiritless cravens they are now,--relying no more on themselves for\nprotection, but content to go about yelling 'Police! Police!' at the\nleast threat of injury to their worthless persons. Come, it's time we\nstarted, Geoffrey!--let us go and bow our heads before another human\nunit formed precisely like ourselves, and so act in defiance of Death\nand the Deity, who declare all men to be equal!\"\n\nWe entered our carriage and were soon on our way to St James's Palace.\n\n\"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is not exactly the Creator of\nthe universe;\"--said Lucio suddenly, looking out of the window as we\napproached the line of soldiery on guard outside.\n\n\"Why no!\" I answered laughing--\"What do you say that for?\"\n\n\"Because there is as much fuss about him as if he were,--in fact, more.\nThe Creator does not get half as much attention bestowed upon Him as\nAlbert Edward. We never attire ourselves in any special way for entering\nthe presence of God; we don't put so much as a clean mind on.\"\n\n\"But then,\"--I said indifferently--\"God is _non est_,--and Albert Edward\nis _est_.\"\n\nHe smiled,--and his eyes had a scornful gleam in their dark centres.\n\n\"That is your opinion?\" he queried--\"Well, it is not original,--many\nchoice spirits share it with you. There is at least one good excuse for\npeople who make no preparation to enter the presence of God,--in going\nto church, which is called the 'house of God,' they do not find God at\nall; they only discover the clergyman. It is somewhat of a\ndisappointment.\"\n\nI had no time to reply, as just then the carriage stopped, and we\nalighted at the palace. Through the intervention of the high Court\nofficial who presented us, we got a good place among the most\ndistinguished arrivals, and during our brief wait, I was considerably\namused by the study of their faces and attitudes. Some of the men looked\nnervous,--others conceited; one or two Radical notabilities comported\nthemselves with an air as if they and they alone were to be honoured for\nallowing Royalty to hold these functions at all; a few gentlemen had\nevidently donned their Lev\u00c3\u00a9e dress in haste and carelessness, for the\npieces of tissue-paper in which their steel or gilt coat-buttons had\nbeen wrapped by the tailor to prevent tarnish, were still unremoved.\nDiscovering this fortunately before it was too late, they occupied\nthemselves by taking off these papers and casting them on the floor,--an\nuntidy process at best, and one that made them look singularly\nridiculous and undignified. Each man present turned to stare at Lucio;\nhis striking personality attracted universal attention. When we at last\nentered the throne-room, and took our places in line, I was careful to\narrange that my brilliant companion should go up before me, as I had a\nstrong desire to see what sort of an effect his appearance would produce\non the Royal party. I had an excellent view of the Prince of Wales from\nwhere I myself waited; he made an imposing and kingly figure enough, in\nfull uniform with his various Orders glittering on his broad breast; and\nthe singular resemblance discovered by many people in him to Henry VIII.\nstruck me more forcibly than I should have thought possible. His face\nhowever expressed a far greater good-humour than the pictured lineaments\nof the capricious but ever popular 'bluff King Hal,'--though on this\noccasion there was a certain shade of melancholy, even sternness on his\nbrow, which gave a firmer character to his naturally mobile features,--a\nshadow, as I fancied of weariness, tempered with regret,--the look of\none dissatisfied, yet resigned. A man of blunted possibilities he seemed\nto me,--of defeated aims, and thwarted will. Few of the other members of\nthe Royal family surrounding him on the da\u00c3\u00afs, possessed the remarkable\nattraction he had for any observant student of physiognomy,--most of\nthem were, or assumed to be, stiff military figures merely who bent\ntheir heads as each guest filed past with an automatic machine-like\nregularity implying neither pleasure, interest, nor good-will. But the\nHeir-Apparent to the greatest Empire in the world expressed in his very\nattitude and looks, an unaffected and courteous welcome to\nall,--surrounded as he was, and as such in his position must ever be, by\ntoadies, parasites, sycophants, hypocritical self-seekers, who would\nnever run the least risk to their own lives to serve him, unless they\ncould get something personally satisfactory out of it, his presence\nimpressed itself upon me as full of the suggestion of dormant but none\nthe less resolute power. I cannot even now explain the singular\nexcitation of mind that seized me as our turn to be presented\narrived;--I saw my companion advance, and heard the Lord Chamberlain\nannounce his name;--'Prince Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez'; and then;--why then,--it\nseemed as if all the movement in the brilliant room suddenly came to a\npause! Every eye was fixed on the stately form and noble countenance of\nmy friend as he bowed with such consummate courtliness and grace as made\nall other salutations seem awkward by comparison. For one moment he\nstood absolutely still in front of the Royal da\u00c3\u00afs,--facing the Prince as\nthough he sought to impress him with the fact of his presence\nthere,--and across the broad stream of sunshine which had been pouring\ninto the room throughout the ceremony, there fell the sudden shadow of a\npassing cloud. A fleeting impression of gloom and silence chilled the\natmosphere,--a singular magnetism appeared to hold all eyes fixed on\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez; and not a man either going or coming, moved. This intense hush\nwas brief as it was curious and impressive;--the Prince of Wales started\nslightly, and gazed at the superb figure before him with an expression\nof eager curiosity and almost as if he were ready to break the frigid\nbonds of etiquette and speak,--then controlling himself with an evident\neffort he gave his usual dignified acknowledgment of Lucio's profound\nreverence, whereupon my comrade passed on,--slightly smiling. I followed\nnext,--but naturally made no impression beyond the fact of exciting a\nsmothered whisper from some-one among the lesser Royalties who caught\nthe name 'Geoffrey Tempest,' and at once murmured the magic words \"Five\nmillions!\"--words which reached my ears and moved me to the usual weary\ncontempt which was with me growing into a chronic malady. We were soon\nout of the palace, and while waiting for our carriage in the covered\ncourt-yard entrance, I touched Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez on the arm.\n\n\"You made a veritable sensation Lucio!\"\n\n\"Did I?\" He laughed. \"You flatter me Geoffrey.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Why did you stop so long in front of the da\u00c3\u00afs?\"\n\n\"To please my humour!\" he returned indifferently--\"And partly, to give\nhis Royal Highness the chance of remembering me the next time he sees\nme.\"\n\n\"But he seemed to recognise you,\"--I said--\"Have you met him before?\"\n\nHis eyes flashed. \"Often! But I have never till now made a public\nappearance at St James's. Court costume and 'company manners' make a\ndifference to the looks of most men,--and I doubt,--yes, I very much\ndoubt, whether, even with his reputed excellent memory for faces, the\nPrince really knew me to-day for what I am!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nIt must have been about a week or ten days after the Prince of Wales's\nLev\u00c3\u00a9e that I had the strange scene with Sibyl Elton I am about to\nrelate; a scene that left a painful impression on my mind and should\nhave been sufficient to warn me of impending trouble to come had I not\nbeen too egotistical to accept any portent that presaged ill to myself.\nArriving at Lord Elton's house one evening, and ascending the stairs to\nthe drawing-room as was now my usual custom, unannounced and without\nceremony, I found Diana Chesney there alone and in tears.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" I exclaimed in a rallying tone, for I was on\nvery friendly and familiar terms with the little American--\"You, of all\npeople in the world, having a private 'weep'! Has our dear railway papa\n'bust up'?\"\n\nShe laughed, a trifle hysterically.\n\n\"Not just yet, you bet!\" she answered, lifting her wet eyes to mine and\nshowing that mischief still sparkled brightly in them,--\"There's nothing\nwrong with the funds as far as I know. I've only had a,----well, a sort\nof rumpus here with Sibyl.\"\n\n\"With Sibyl?\"\n\n\"Yes,\"--and she rested the point of her little embroidered shoe on a\nfootstool and looked at it critically--\"You see it's the Catsup's 'At\nHome' to-night, and I'm invited and Sibyl's invited; Miss Charlotte is\nknocked up with nursing the Countess, and of course I made sure that\nSibyl would go. Well, she never said a word about it till she came down\nto dinner, and then she asked me what time I wanted the carriage. I said\n'Aren't you going too?' and she looked at me in that provoking way of\nhers,--_you_ know!--a look that takes you in from your topmost hair to\nyour shoe-edge,--and answered 'Did you think it possible!' Well, I\nflared up, and said of course I thought it possible,--why shouldn't it\nbe possible? She looked at me in the same way again and said--'To the\n_Catsups_? with _you_!' Now, you know, Mr Tempest, that was real\ndownright rudeness, and more than I could stand so I just gave way to my\nmind. 'Look here,' I said--'though you are the daughter of an Earl, you\nneedn't turn up your nose at Mrs Catsup. She isn't half bad,--I don't\nspeak of her money,--but she's a real good sort, and has a kind heart,\nwhich it appears to me is more than you have. Mrs Catsup would never\ntreat me as unkindly as you do.' And then I choked,--I could have burst\nout in a regular yell, if I hadn't thought the footman might be outside\nthe door listening. And Sibyl only smiled, that patent ice-refrigerator\nsmile of hers, and asked--'would you prefer to live with Mrs Catsup?' Of\ncourse I told her no,--nothing would induce me to live with Mrs Catsup,\nand then she said--'Miss Chesney, you pay my father for the protection\nand guarantee of his name and position in English social circles, but\nthe companionship of my father's daughter was not included in the\nbargain. I have tried to make you understand as distinctly as I can that\nI will not be seen in society with you,--not because I dislike you,--far\nfrom it,--but simply because people would say I was acting as your paid\ncompanion. You force me to speak plainly, and I am sorry if I offend. As\nfor Mrs Catsup, I have only met her once, and she seemed to me very\ncommon and ill-bred. Besides I do not care for the society of\ntradespeople.' And with that she got up and sailed out,--and I heard her\norder the carriage for me at ten. It's coming round directly, and just\nlook at my red eyes! It's awfully hard on me,--I know old Catsup made\nhis pile out of varnish, but varnish is as good as anything else in the\ngeneral market. And----and----it's all out now, Mr Tempest,--and you can\ntell Sibyl what I've said if you like; I know you're in love with her!\"\n\nI stared, bewildered by her voluble and almost breathless outburst.\n\n\"Really, Miss Chesney,\" I began formally.\n\n\"Oh yes, Miss Chesney, Miss Chesney--it's all very well!\" she repeated\nimpatiently, snatching up a gorgeous evening cloak which I mutely\nvolunteered to put on, an offer she as mutely accepted--\"I'm only a\ngirl, and it isn't my fault if I've got a vulgar man for a father who\nwants to see me married to an English nobleman before he dies,--that's\n_his_ look-out--_I_ don't care about it. English noblemen are a ricketty\nlot in _my_ opinion. But I've as good a heart as anyone, and I could\nlove Sibyl if she'd let me, but she _won't_. She leads the life of an\nice-berg, and doesn't care a rap for anyone. She doesn't care for you,\nyou know!--I wish she did,--she'd be more human!\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry for all this,\"--I said, smiling into the piquante face\nof the really sweet-natured girl, and gently fastening the jewelled\nclasp of her cloak at her throat--\"But you mustn't mind it so much. You\nare a dear little soul Diana,--kind and generous and impulsive and all\nthe rest of it,--but,--well----English people are very apt to\nmisunderstand Americans. I can quite enter into your feelings,--still\nyou know Lady Sibyl is very proud----\"\n\n\"Proud!\" she interrupted--\"My! I guess it must feel something splendid\nto have an ancestor who was piked through the body on Bosworth field,\nand left there for the birds to eat. It seems to give a kind of\nstiffness in the back to all the family ever afterwards. Shouldn't\nwonder if the descendants of the birds who ate him felt kinder stuck up\nabout it too!\"\n\nI laughed,--she laughed with me, and was quite herself again.\n\n\"If I told you _my_ ancestor was a Pilgrim Father, you wouldn't believe\nme I expect!\" she said, the corners of her mouth dimpling.\n\n\"I should believe anything from _your_ lips!\" I declared gallantly.\n\n\"Well, believe that, then! Swallow it down if you can! I can't! He was a\nPilgrim Father in the _Mayflower_, and he fell on his knees and thanked\nGod as soon as he touched dry land in the true Pilgrim-Father way. But\nhe couldn't hold a candle to the piked man at Bosworth.\"\n\nHere we were interrupted by the entrance of a footman.\n\n\"The carriage is waiting, Miss.\"\n\n\"Thanks,--all right. Good-night Mr Tempest,--you'd better send word to\nSibyl you are here; Lord Elton is dining out, but Sibyl will be at home\nall the evening.\"\n\nI offered her my arm, and escorted her to the carriage, feeling a little\nsorry for her as she drove off in solitary state to the festive 'crush'\nof the successful varnisher. She was a good girl, a bright girl, a true\ngirl,--vulgar and flippant at times, yet on the whole sincere in her\nbetter qualities of character and sentiment,--and it was this very\nsincerity which, being quite unconventional and not at all _la mode_,\nwas misunderstood, and would always be misunderstood by the higher and\ntherefore more hypocritically polished circles of English society.\n\nI returned to the drawing-room slowly and meditatively, telling one of\nthe servants on my way to ask Lady Sibyl if she could see me for a few\nmoments. I was not kept waiting long; I had only paced the room twice up\nand down when she entered, looking so strangely wild and beautiful that\nI could scarcely forbear uttering an exclamation of wonder. She wore\nwhite as was always her custom in the evenings,--her hair was less\nelaborately dressed than usual, and clustered over her brow in loose\nwavy masses,--her face was exceedingly pale, and her eyes appeared\nlarger and darker by comparison--her smile was vague and fleeting like\nthat of a sleep-walker. She gave me her hand; it was dry and burning.\n\n\"My father is out--\" she began.\n\n\"I know. But I came to see _you_. May I stay a little?\"\n\nShe murmured assent, and sinking listlessly into a chair, began to play\nwith some roses in a vase on the table beside her.\n\n\"You look tired Lady Sibyl,\"--I said gently--\"Are you not well?\"\n\n\"I am quite well--\" she answered--\"But you are right in saying I am\ntired. I am dreadfully tired!\"\n\n\"You have been doing too much perhaps?--your attendance on your mother\ntries you----\"\n\nShe laughed bitterly.\n\n\"Attendance on my mother!--pray do not credit me with so much devotion.\nI never attend on my mother. I cannot do it; I am too much of a coward.\nHer face terrifies me; and whenever I do venture to go near her, she\ntries to speak, with such dreadful, such ghastly efforts, as make her\nmore hideous to look at than anyone can imagine. I should die of fright\nif I saw her often. As it is, when I do see her I can scarcely\nstand--and twice I have fainted with the horror of it. To think of\nit!--that that living corpse with the fearful fixed eyes and distorted\nmouth should actually be _my mother_!\"\n\nShe shuddered violently, and her very lips paled as she spoke. I was\nseriously concerned, and told her so.\n\n\"This must be very bad for your health,\"--I said, drawing my chair\ncloser to hers--\"Can you not get away for a change?\"\n\nShe looked at me in silence. The expression of her eyes thrilled me\nstrangely,--it was not tender or wistful, but fierce, passionate and\ncommanding.\n\n\"I saw Miss Chesney for a few moments just now\"--I resumed,--\"She seemed\nvery unhappy.\"\n\n\"She has nothing to be unhappy about--\" said Sibyl coldly--\"except the\ntime my mother takes in dying. But she is young; she can afford to wait\na little for the Elton coronet.\"\n\n\"Is not----may not this be a mistaken surmise of yours?\" I ventured\ngently--\"Whatever her faults, I think the girl admires and loves you.\"\n\nShe smiled scornfully.\n\n\"I want neither her love nor her admiration,\"--she said--\"I have few\nwomen-friends and those few are all hypocrites whom I mistrust. When\nDiana Chesney is my step-mother, we shall still be strangers.\"\n\nI felt I was on delicate ground, and that I could not continue the\nconversation without the risk of giving offence.\n\n\"Where is _your_ friend?\" asked Sibyl suddenly, apparently to change the\nsubject--\"Why does he so seldom come here now?\"\n\n\"Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez? Well, he is a very queer fellow, and at times takes an\nabhorrence for all society. He frequently meets your father at the club,\nand I suppose his reason for not coming here is that he hates women.\"\n\n\"All women?\" she queried with a little smile.\n\n\"Without exception!\"\n\n\"Then he hates me?\"\n\n\"I did not say that--\" I answered quickly--\"No one could hate you, Lady\nSibyl,--but truly, as far as Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez is concerned, I expect he\ndoes not abate his aversion to womankind (which is his chronic malady)\neven for you.\"\n\n\"So he will never marry?\" she said musingly.\n\nI laughed. \"Oh, never! That you may be quite sure of.\"\n\nStill playing with the roses near her, she relapsed into silence. Her\nbreath came and went quickly; I saw her long eyelashes quiver against\nthe pale rose-leaf tint of her cheeks,--the pure outline of her delicate\nprofile suggested to my mind one of Fra Angelico's meditative saints or\nangels. All at once, while I yet watched her admiringly, she suddenly\nsprang erect, crushing a rose in her hand,--her head thrown back, her\neyes flashing, her whole frame trembling.\n\n\"Oh, I cannot bear it!\" she cried wildly--\"I cannot bear it!\"\n\nI started up astonished, and confronted her.\n\n\"Sibyl!\"\n\n\"Oh, why don't you speak, and fill up the measure of my degradation!\"\nshe went on passionately--\"Why don't you tell _me_, as you tell my\nfather, your purpose in coming here?--why don't you say to _me_, as you\nsay to him, that your sovereign choice has fastened upon me,--that I am\nthe woman out of all the world you have elected to marry! Look at me!\"\nand she raised her arms with a tragic gesture; \"Is there any flaw in the\npiece of goods you wish to purchase? This face is deemed worthy of the\nfashionable photographer's pains; worthy of being sold for a shilling as\none of England's 'beauties,'--this figure has served as a model for the\nshowing-off of many a modiste's costume, purchased at half-cost on the\nunderstanding that I must state to my circle of acquaintance the name of\nthe maker or designer,--these eyes, these lips, these arms are all yours\nfor the buying! Why do you expose me to the shame of dallying over your\nbargain?--by hesitating and considering as to whether, after all, I am\nworthy of your gold!\"\n\nShe seemed seized by some hysterical passion that convulsed her, and in\nmingled amazement, alarm and distress, I sprang to her and caught her\nhands in my own.\n\n\"Sibyl, Sibyl!\" I said--\"Hush--hush! You are overwrought with fatigue\nand excitement,--you cannot know what you are saying. My darling, what\ndo you take me for?--what is all this nonsense in your mind about buying\nand selling? You know I love you,--I have made no secret of it,--you\nmust have seen it in my face,--and if I have hesitated to speak, it is\nbecause I feared your rejection of me. You are too good for me,\nSibyl,--too good for any man,--I am not worthy to win your beauty and\ninnocence. My love, my love--do not give way in this manner\"--for as I\nspoke she clung to me like a wild bird suddenly caged--\"What can I say\nto you, but that I worship you with all the strength of my life,--I love\nyou so deeply that I am afraid to think of it; it is a passion I dare\nnot dwell upon, Sibyl,--I love you too well,--too madly for my own\npeace----\"\n\nI trembled, and was silent,--her soft arms clinging to me robbed me of\na portion of my self-control. I kissed the rippling waves of her hair;\nshe lifted her head and looked up at me, her eyes alit with some strange\nlustre that was not love as much as fear,--and the sight of her beauty\nthus yielded as it were to my possession, broke down the barriers of\nrestraint I had hitherto imposed upon myself. I kissed her on the\nlips,--a long passionate kiss that, to my excited fancy, seemed to\nmingle our very beings into one,--but while I yet held her in my arms,\nshe suddenly released herself and pushed me back. Standing apart from me\nshe trembled so violently that I feared she would fail,--and I took her\nhand and made her sit down. She smiled,--a very wan smile.\n\n\"What did you feel then?\" she asked.\n\n\"When, Sibyl?\"\n\n\"Just now,--when you kissed me?\"\n\n\"All the joys of heaven and fires of hell in a moment!\" I said.\n\nShe regarded me with a curious musing frown.\n\n\"Strange! Do you know what _I_ felt?\"\n\nI shook my head smiling, and pressed my lips on the soft small hand I\nheld.\n\n\"Nothing!\" she said, with a kind of hopeless gesture--\"I assure you,\nabsolutely nothing! I cannot feel. I am one of your modern women,--I can\nonly think,--and analyse.\"\n\n\"Think and analyse as much as you will, my queen,\"--I answered\nplayfully--\"if you will only think you can be happy with me. That is all\nI desire.\"\n\n\"Can you be happy with _me_?\" she asked--\"Wait--do not answer for a\nmoment, till I tell you what I am. You are altogether mistaken in me.\"\nShe was silent for some minutes, and I watched her anxiously. \"I was\nalways intended for this\"--she said slowly at last,--\"this, to which I\nhave now come,--to be the property of a rich man. Many men have looked\nat me with a view to purchase, but they could not pay the price my\nfather demanded. Pray do not look so distressed!--what I say is quite\ntrue and quite commonplace,--all the women of the upper classes,--the\nunmarried ones,--are for sale now in England as utterly as the\nCircassian girls in a barbarian slave-market. I see you wish to protest,\nand assure me of your devotion,--but there is no need of this,--I am\nquite sure you love me,--as much as any man can love,--and I am content.\nBut you do not know me really,--you are attracted by my face and\nform,--and you admire my youth and innocence, which you think I possess.\nBut I am not young--I am old in heart and feeling. I was young for a\nlittle while at Willowsmere, when I lived among flowers and birds and\nall the trustful honest creatures of the woods and fields,--but one\nseason in town was sufficient to kill my youth in me,--one season of\ndinners and balls, and--fashionable novel-reading. Now _you_ have\nwritten a book, and therefore you must know something about the duties\nof authorship,--of the serious and even terrible responsibility writers\nincur when they send out to the world books full of pernicious and\npoisonous suggestion to contaminate the minds that have hitherto been\nclean and undiseased. Your book has a noble motive; and for this I\nadmire it in many parts, though to me it is not as convincing as it\nmight have been. It is well written too; but I gained the impression\nwhile reading it, that you were not altogether sincere yourself in the\nthoughts you strove to inculcate,--and that therefore you just missed\nwhat you should have gained.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are right,\"--I said, with a wholesome pang of\nhumiliation--\"The book is worthless as literature,--it is only the\n'boom' of a season!\"\n\n\"At any rate,\"--she went on, her eyes darkening with the intensity of\nher feeling--\"you have not polluted your pen with the vileness common to\nmany of the authors of the day. I ask you, do you think a girl can read\nthe books that are now freely published, and that her silly society\nfriends tell her to read,--'because it is so dreadfully _queer_!'--and\nyet remain unspoilt and innocent? Books that go into the details of the\nlives of outcasts?--that explain and analyse the secret vices of\nmen?--that advocate almost as a sacred duty 'free love' and universal\npolygamy?--that see no shame in introducing into the circles of good\nwives and pure-minded girls, a heroine who boldly seeks out a man, _any_\nman, in order that she may have a child by him, without the\n'degradation' of marrying him? I have read all those books,--and what\ncan you expect of me? Not innocence, surely! I despise men,--I despise\nmy own sex,--I loathe myself for being a woman! You wonder at my\nfanaticism for Mavis Clare,--it is only because for a time her books\ngive me back my self-respect, and make me see humanity in a nobler\nlight,--because she restores to me, if only for an hour, a kind of\nglimmering belief in God, so that my mind feels refreshed and cleansed.\nAll the same, you must not look upon me as an innocent young girl\nGeoffrey,--a girl such as the great poets idealized and sang of,--I am a\ncontaminated creature, trained to perfection in the lax morals and\nprurient literature of my day.\"\n\nI looked at her in silence, pained, startled, and with a sense of shock,\nas though something indefinably pure and precious had crumbled into dust\nat my feet. She rose and began pacing the room restlessly, moving to and\nfro with a slow yet fierce grace that reminded me against my wish and\nwill of the movement of some imprisoned and savage beast of prey.\n\n\"You shall not be deceived in me,\"--she said, pausing a moment and\neyeing me sombrely--\"If you marry me, you must do so with a full\nrealization of the choice you make. For with such wealth as yours, you\ncan of course wed any woman you fancy. I do not say you could find a\ngirl better than I am; I do not think you could in _my_ 'set,' because\nwe are all alike,--all tarred with the same brush, and filled with the\nsame merely sensual and materialistic views of life and its\nresponsibilities as the admired heroines of the 'society' novels we\nread. Away in the provinces, among the middle classes it is possible you\nmight discover a really good girl of the purest blush-rose\ninnocence,--but then you might also find her stupid and unentertaining,\nand you would not care for that. My chief recommendation is that I am\nbeautiful,--you can see that; everybody can see that,--and I am not so\naffected as to pretend to be unconscious of the fact. There is no sham\nabout my external appearance; my hair is not a wig,--my complexion is\nnatural,--my figure is not the result of the corset-maker's art,--my\neyebrows and eyelashes are undyed. Oh yes,--you can be sure that the\nbeauty of my body is quite genuine!--but it is not the outward\nexpression of an equally beautiful soul. And this is what I want you to\nunderstand. I am passionate, resentful, impetuous,--frequently\nunsympathetic, and inclined to morbidness and melancholy, and I confess\nI have imbibed, consciously or unconsciously, that complete contempt of\nlife and disbelief in a God, which is the chief theme of nearly all the\nsocial teachings of the time.\"\n\nShe ceased,--and I gazed at her with an odd sense of mingled worship and\ndisillusion, even as a barbarian might gaze at an idol whom he still\nloved, but whom he could no longer believe in as divine. Yet what she\nsaid was in no way contrary to my own theories,--how then could I\ncomplain? I did not believe in a God; why should I inconsistently feel\nregret that she shared my unbelief? I had involuntarily clung to the\nold-fashioned idea that religious faith was a sacred duty in womanhood;\nI was not able to offer any reason for this notion, unless it was the\nromantic fancy of having a good woman to pray for one, if one had no\ntime and less inclination to pray for one's self. However, it was\nevident Sibyl was 'advanced' enough to do without superstitious\nobservances; _she_ would never pray for me;--and if we had children, she\nwould never teach them to make their first tender appeals to Heaven for\nmy sake or hers. I smothered a slight sigh, and was about to speak, when\nshe came up to me and laid her two hands on my shoulders. \"You look\nunhappy, Geoffrey,\"--she said in gentler accents--\"Be consoled!--it is\nnot too late for you to change your mind!\"\n\nI met the questioning glance of her eyes,--beautiful, lustrous eyes as\nclear and pure as light itself.\n\n\"I shall never change, Sibyl,\" I answered--\"I love you,--I shall always\nlove you. But I wish you would not analyse yourself so pitilessly,--you\nhave such strange ideas--\"\n\n\"You think them strange?\" she said--\"You should not,--in these 'new\nwomen' days! I believe that, thanks to newspapers, magazines and\n'decadent' novels, I am in all respects eminently fitted to be a wife!\"\nand she laughed bitterly--\"There is nothing in the r\u00c3\u00b4le of marriage that\nI do not know, though I am not yet twenty. I have been prepared for a\nlong time to be sold to the highest bidder, and what few silly notions I\nhad about love,--the love of the poets and idealists,--when I was a\ndreamy child at Willowsmere, are all dispersed and ended. Ideal love is\ndead,--and worse than dead, being out of fashion. Carefully instructed\nas I have been in the worthlessness of everything but money, you can\nscarcely be surprised at my speaking of myself as an object of sale.\nMarriage for me _is_ a sale, as far as my father is concerned,--for you\nknow well enough that however much you loved me or I loved you, he would\nnever allow me to marry you if you were not rich, and richer than most\nmen. I want you to feel that I fully recognize the nature of the bargain\nstruck; and I ask you not to expect a girl's fresh, confiding love from\na woman as warped in heart and mind as I am!\"\n\n\"Sibyl,\"--I said earnestly--\"You wrong yourself; I am sure you wrong\nyourself! You are one of those who can be in the world yet not of it;\nyour mind is too open and pure to be sullied, even by contact with evil\nthings. I will believe nothing you say against your own sweet and noble\ncharacter,--and, Sibyl, let me again ask you not to distress me by this\nconstant harping on the subject of my wealth, or I shall be inclined to\nlook upon it as a curse,--I should love you as much if I were poor----\"\n\n\"Oh, you might love me\"--she interrupted me, with a strange smile--\"but\nyou would not dare to say so!\"\n\nI was silent. Suddenly she laughed, and linked her arms caressingly\nround my neck.\n\n\"There, Geoffrey!\" she said--\"I have finished my discourse,--my bit of\nIbsenism, or whatever other ism affects me,--and we need not be\nmiserable about it. I have said what was in my mind; I have told you the\ntruth, that in heart I am neither young nor innocent. But I am no worse\nthan all my 'set' so perhaps you had better make the best of me. I\nplease your fancy, do I not?\"\n\n\"My love for you cannot be so lightly expressed, Sibyl!\" I answered in\nrather a pained tone.\n\n\"Never mind,--it is my humour so to express it\"--she went on--\"I please\nyour fancy, and you wish to marry me. Well now, all I ask is, go to my\nfather and buy me at once! Conclude the bargain! And when you have\nbought me,--don't look so tragic!\" and she laughed again--\"and when you\nhave paid the clergyman, and paid the bridesmaids (with monogram lockets\nor brooches) and paid the guests (with wedding-cake and champagne) and\ncleared up all scores with everybody, even to the last man who shuts the\ndoor of the nuptial brougham,--will you take me away,--far away from\nthis place--this house, where my mother's face haunts me like a ghost in\nthe darkness; where I am tortured by terrors night and day,--where I\nhear such strange sounds, and dream of such ghastly things,--\" here her\nvoice suddenly broke, and she hid her face against my breast--\"Oh yes,\nGeoffrey, take me away as quickly as possible! Let us never live in\nhateful London, but at Willowsmere; I may find some of the old joys\nthere,--and some of the happy bygone days.\"\n\nTouched by the appealing pathos of her accents, I pressed her to my\nheart, feeling that she was scarcely accountable for the strange things\nshe said in her evidently overwrought and excitable condition.\n\n\"It shall be as you wish, my darling,\" I said--\"The sooner I have you\nall to myself the better. This is the end of March,--will you be ready\nto marry me in June?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, still hiding her face.\n\n\"And now Sibyl,\" I went on--\"remember,--there must be no more talk of\nmoney and bargaining. Tell me what you have not yet told me,--that you\nlove me,--and would love me even if I were poor.\"\n\nShe looked up, straightly and unflinchingly full into my eyes.\n\n\"I cannot tell you that,\"--she said,--\"I have told you I do not believe\nin love; and if you were poor I certainly should not marry you. It would\nbe no use!\"\n\n\"You are frank, Sibyl!\"\n\n\"It is best to be frank, is it not?\" and she drew a flower from the knot\nat her bosom, and began fastening it in my coat--\"Geoffrey what is the\ngood of pretence? You would hate to be poor, and so should I. I do not\nunderstand the verb 'to love,'--now and then when I read a book by Mavis\nClare, I believe love may exist, but when I close the book my belief is\nshut up with it. So do not ask for what is not in me. I am willing--even\nglad to marry you; that is all you must expect.\"\n\n\"All!\" I exclaimed, with a sudden mingling of love and wrath in my blood,\nas I closed my arms about her and kissed her passionately--\"All!--you\nimpassive ice-flower, it is not all!--you shall melt to my touch and\nlearn what love _is_,--do not think you can escape its influence, you\ndear, foolish, beautiful child! Your passions are asleep,--they must\nwake!\"\n\n\"For you?\" she queried, resting her head back against my shoulder, and\ngazing up at me with a dreamy radiance in her lovely eyes.\n\n\"For me!\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"'Oh bid me love, and I will love!'\"--she hummed softly under her\nbreath.\n\n\"You will, you must, you shall!\" I said ardently. \"I will be your master\nin the art of loving!\"\n\n\"It is a difficult art!\" she said--\"I am afraid it will take a life-time\nto complete my training, even with my 'master.'\"\n\nAnd a smile still lingered in her eyes, giving them a witch-like\nglamour, when I kissed her again and bade her good-night.\n\n\"You will tell Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez the news?\" she said.\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"Of course I wish it. Tell him at once. I should like him to know.\"\n\nI went down the stairs,--she leaned over the balustrade looking after\nme.\n\n\"Good-night Geoffrey!\" she called softly.\n\n\"Good-night Sibyl!\"\n\n\"Be sure you tell Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez!\"\n\nHer white figure disappeared; and I walked out of the house in a chaotic\nstate of mind, divided between pride, ecstasy and pain,--the engaged\nhusband of an earl's daughter,--the lover of a woman who had declared\nherself incapable of love and destitute of faith.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nLooking back through the space of only three years to this particular\nperiod of my life, I can remember distinctly the singular expression of\nLucio's face when I told him that Sibyl Elton had accepted me. His\nsudden smile gave a light to his eyes that I had never seen in them\nbefore,--a brilliant yet sinister glow, strangely suggestive of some\ninwardly suppressed wrath and scorn. While I spoke he was, to my\nvexation, toying with that uncanny favourite of his, the\n'mummy-insect,'--and it annoyed me beyond measure to see the repulsive\npertinacity with which the glittering bat-like creature clung to his\nhand.\n\n\"Women are all alike,\"--he said with a hard laugh, when he had heard my\nnews,--\"Few of them have moral force enough to resist that temptation of\na rich marriage.\"\n\nI was irritated at this.\n\n\"It is scarcely fair of you to judge everything by the\nmoney-standard,\"--I said,--then, after a little pause I added what in my\nown heart I knew to be a lie,--\"She,--Sibyl,--loves me for myself\nalone.\"\n\nHis glance flashed over me like lightning.\n\n\"Oh!--sets the wind in that quarter! Why then, my dear Geoffrey, I\ncongratulate you more heartily than ever. To conquer the affections of\none of the proudest girls in England, and win her love so completely as\nto be sure she would marry you even if you had not a sou to bless\nyourself with--this is a victory indeed!--and one of which you may well\nbe proud. Again and yet again I congratulate you!\"\n\nTossing the horrible thing he called his 'sprite' off to fly on one of\nits slow humming circuits round the room, he shook my hand fervently,\nstill smiling,--and I,--feeling instinctively that he was as fully aware\nof the truth as I was, namely, that had I been a poor author with\nnothing but what I could earn by my brains, the Lady Sibyl Elton would\nnever have looked at me, much less agreed to marry me,--kept silence\nlest I should openly betray the reality of my position.\n\n\"You see\"--he went on, with a cheerful relentlessness--\"I was not aware\nthat any old-world romance graced the disposition of one so apparently\nimpassive as your beautiful fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. To love for love's sake only, is\nbecoming really an obsolete virtue. I thought Lady Sibyl was an\nessentially modern woman, conscious of her position, and the necessity\nthere was for holding that position proudly before the world at all\ncosts,--and that the pretty pastoral sentiments of poetical Phyllises\nand Amandas had no place in her nature. I was wrong, it seems; and for\nonce I have been mistaken in the fair sex!\" Here he stretched out his\nhand to the 'sprite,' that now came winging its way back, and settled at\nonce on its usual resting-place; \"My friend, I assure you, if you have\nwon a true woman's true love, you have a far greater fortune than your\nmillions,--a treasure that none can afford to despise.\"\n\nHis voice softened,--his eyes grew dreamy and less scornful,--and I\nlooked at him in some astonishment.\n\n\"Why Lucio, I thought you hated women?\"\n\n\"So I do!\" he replied quickly--\"But do not forget why I hate them! It is\nbecause they have all the world's possibilities of good in their hands,\nand the majority of them deliberately turn these possibilities to evil.\nMen are influenced entirely by women, though few of them will own\nit,--through women they are lifted to heaven or driven to hell. The\nlatter is the favourite course, and the one almost universally\nadopted.\"\n\nHis brow darkened, and the lines round his proud mouth grew hard and\nstern. I watched him for a moment,--then with sudden irrelevance I\nsaid--\n\n\"Put that abominable 'sprite' of yours away, will you? I hate to see you\nwith it!\"\n\n\"What, my poor Egyptian princess!\" he exclaimed with a laugh--\"Why so\ncruel to her Geoffrey? If you had lived in her day, you might have been\none of her lovers! She was no doubt a charming person,--I find her\ncharming still! However, to oblige you--\" and here, placing the insect\nin its crystal receptacle he carried it away to the other end of the\nroom. Then, returning towards me slowly, he said--\"Who knows what the\n'sprite' suffered as a woman, Geoffrey! Perhaps she made a rich\nmarriage, and repented it! At anyrate I am sure she is much happier in\nher present condition!\"\n\n\"I have no sympathy with such a ghastly fancy,\"--I said abruptly--\"I\nonly know that _she_ or _it_ is a perfectly loathsome object to me.\"\n\n\"Well,--some 'transmigrated' souls _are_ loathsome objects to look\nat;\"--he declared imperturbably--\"When they are deprived of their\nrespectable two-legged fleshly covering, it is extraordinary what a\nchange the inexorable law of Nature makes in them!\"\n\n\"What nonsense you talk, Lucio!\" I said impatiently--\"How can you know\nanything about it!\"\n\nA sudden shadow passed over his face, giving it a strange pallor and\nimpenetrability.\n\n\"Have you forgotten\"--he said in deliberately measured accents--\"that\nyour friend John Carrington, when he wrote that letter of introduction I\nbrought from him to you, told you in it, that in all matters scientific\nI was an 'absolute master?' In these 'matters scientific' you have not\ntested my skill,--yet you ask--'how can I know?' I answer that I do\nknow--many things of which you are ignorant. Do not presume too much on\nyour own intellectual capability my friend,--lest I prove it\nnaught!--lest I demonstrate to you, beyond all possibility of consoling\ndoubt, that the shreds and strippings of that change you call death, are\nonly so many embryos of new life which you _must_ live, whether you will\nor no!\"\n\nSomewhat abashed by his words and still more by his manner, I said--\n\n\"Pardon me!--I spoke in haste of course,--but you know my theories--\"\n\n\"Most thoroughly!\" and he laughed, with an immediate resumption of his\nold manner--\"'Every man his own theory' is the fashionable motto of the\nhour. Each little biped tells you that he has his 'own idea' of God, and\nequally 'his own' idea of the Devil. It is very droll! But let us return\nto the theme of love. I feel I have not congratulated you half\nenough,--for surely Fortune favours you singularly. Out of the teeming\nmass of vain and frivolous femininity, you have secured a unique example\nof beauty, truth and purity,--a woman, who apart from all self-interest\nand worldly advantage, weds you, with five millions, for yourself alone!\nThe prettiest poem in the world could be made out of such an exquisitely\ninnocent maiden type! You are one of the luckiest men alive; in fact,\nyou have nothing more to wish for!\"\n\nI did not contradict him, though in my own mind I felt that the\ncircumstances of my engagement left much to be desired. I, who scoffed\nat religion, wished it had formed part of the character of my future\nwife,--I, who sneered at sentiment, craved for some expression of it in\nthe woman whose beauty attracted my desires. However I determinedly\nsmothered all the premonitions of my own conscience, and accepted what\neach day of my idle and useless life brought me without considering\nfuture consequences.\n\nThe papers soon had the news that \"a marriage has been arranged and will\nshortly take place between Sibyl, only daughter of the Earl of Elton,\nand Geoffrey Tempest, the famous millionaire.\" Not 'famous author' mark\nyou!--though I was still being loudly 'boomed.' Morgeson, my publisher,\ncould offer me no consolation as to my chances of winning and keeping a\nsteady future fame. The Tenth Edition of my book was announced, but we\nhad not actually disposed of more than two thousand copies, including a\nOne-Volume issue which had been hastily thrust on the market. And the\nwork I had so mercilessly and maliciously slated,--'Differences' by\nMavis Clare was in its thirtieth thousand! I commented on this with some\nanger to Morgeson, who was virtuously aggrieved at my complaint.\n\n\"Dear me, Mr Tempest, you are not the only writer who has been 'boomed'\nby the press and who nevertheless does not sell,\"--he exclaimed--\"No one\ncan account for the caprices of the public; they are entirely beyond the\nmost cautious publisher's control or calculation. Miss Clare is a sore\nsubject to many authors besides yourself,--she always 'takes' and no one\ncan help it. I sympathize with you in the matter heartily, but I am not\nto blame. At any rate the reviewers are all with you,--their praise has\nbeen almost unanimous. Now Mavis Clare's 'Differences,' though to my\nthinking a very brilliant and powerful book, has been literally cut to\npieces whenever it has been noticed at all,--and yet the public go for\nher and don't go for you. It isn't my fault. You see people have got\nCompulsory Education now, and I'm afraid they begin to mistrust\ncriticism, preferring to form their own independent opinions; if this is\nso, of course it will be a terrible thing, because the most carefully\norganized clique in the world will be powerless. Everything has been\ndone for you that can be done, Mr Tempest,--I am sure I regret as much\nas yourself that the result has not been all you expected or desired.\nMany authors would not care so much for the public approval; the\napplause of cultured journalism such as you have obtained, would be more\nthan sufficient for them.\"\n\nI laughed bitterly. 'The applause of cultured journalism!' I thought I\nknew something of the way in which such applause was won. Almost I began\nto hate my millions,--golden trash that could only secure me the\ninsincere flattery of fair-weather friends,--and that could not give me\nfame,--such fame as has sometimes been grasped in a moment by a starving\nand neglected genius, who in the very arms of death, succeeds in\nmastering the world. One day in a fit of disappointment and petulance I\nsaid to Lucio--\n\n\"You have not kept all your promises, my friend!--you told me you could\ngive me fame!\"\n\nHe looked at me curiously.\n\n\"Did I? Well,--and are you not famous?\"\n\n\"No. I am merely notorious,\" I retorted.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"The word fame, my good Geoffrey, traced to its origin means 'a\nbreath'--the breath of popular adulation. You have that--for your\nwealth.\"\n\n\"But not for my work!\"\n\n\"You have the praise of the reviewers!\"\n\n\"What is that worth!\"\n\n\"Everything!\" he answered smiling--\"In the reviewers' own opinion!\"\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"You speak of work;\" he went on--\"Now the nature of work I cannot\nexactly express, because it is a divine thing and is judged by a divine\nstandard. One must consider in all work two things; first, the object\nfor which it is undertaken, and secondly the way in which it is\nperformed. All work should have a high and unselfish intent,--without\nthis, it perishes and is not considered work at all,--not at least by\nthe eternal judges invisible. If it _is_ work, truly and nobly done in\nevery sense of the word, it carries with it its own reward, and the\nlaurels descend from heaven shaped ready for wearing,--no earthly power\ncan bestow them. I cannot give you _that_ fame,--but I have secured you\na very fair imitation of it.\"\n\nI was obliged to acquiesce, though more or less morosely,--whereat I saw\nthat he was somewhat amused. Unwilling to incur his contempt I said no\nmore concerning the subject that was the nearest to my heart, and wore\nout many sleepless hours at night in trying to write a new\nbook,--something novel and daring, such as should force the public to\ncredit me with a little loftier _status_ than that obtained by the\npossession of a huge banking account. But the creative faculty seemed\ndead in me,--I was crushed by a sense of impotence and failure; vague\nideas were in my brain that would not lend themselves to expression in\nwords,--and such a diseased love of hypercriticism controlled me, that\nafter a miserably nervous analysis of every page I wrote, I tore it up\nas soon as it was written, thus reducing myself to a state of mind that\nwas almost unbearable.\n\nEarly in April I made my first visit to Willowsmere, having received\ninformation from the head of the firm of decorators and furnishers\nemployed there, that their work was close on completion, and that they\nwould be glad of a visit of inspection from me. Lucio and I went down\ntogether for the day, and as the train rushed through a green and\nsmiling landscape, bearing us away from the smoke, dirt and noise of the\nrestless modern Babylon, I was conscious of a gradually deepening peace\nand pleasure. The first sight of the place I had recklessly purchased\nwithout so much as looking at it, filled me with delight and admiration.\nIt was a beautiful old house, ideally English and suggestive of\nhome-happiness. Ivy and jessamine clung to its red walls and picturesque\ngables,--through the long vista of the exquisitely wooded grounds, the\nsilver gleam of the Avon river could be discerned, twisting in and out\nlike a ribbon tied in true love-knots,--the trees and shrubs were\nsprouting forth in all their fresh spring beauty,--the aspect of the\ncountry was indescribably bright and soothing, and I began to feel as if\na burden had been suddenly lifted from my life leaving me free to\nbreathe and enjoy my liberty. I strolled from room to room of my future\nabode, admiring the taste and skill with which the whole place had been\nfitted and furnished, down to the smallest detail of elegance, comfort\nand convenience. Here my Sibyl was born, I thought, with a lover-like\ntenderness,--here she would dwell again as my wife, amid the lovely and\nbeloved surroundings of her childhood,--and we should be happy--yes, we\nshould be happy, despite all the dull and heartless social doctrines of\nthe modern world. In the spacious and beautiful drawing-room I stopped\nto look out from the windows on the entrancing view of lawn and woodland\nthat stretched before me,--and as I looked, a warm sense of gratitude\nand affection filled me for the friend to whose good offices I owed this\nfair domain. Turning, I grasped him by the hand.\n\n\"It is all your doing, Lucio!\" I said--\"I feel I can never thank you\nenough! Without you I should perhaps never have met Sibyl,--I might\nnever have heard of her, or of Willowsmere; and I never could have been\nas happy as I am to-day!\"\n\n\"Oh, you are happy then?\" he queried with a little smile--\"I fancied you\nwere not!\"\n\n\"Well--I have not been as happy as I expected to be;\" I\nconfessed,--\"Something in my sudden accession to wealth seems to have\ndragged me down rather than lifted me up,----it is strange----\"\n\n\"It is not strange at all\"--he interrupted,--\"on the contrary it is very\nnatural. As a rule the most miserable people in the world are the rich.\"\n\n\"Are you miserable, for instance?\" I asked, smiling.\n\nHis eyes rested on me with a dark and dreary pathos.\n\n\"Are you too blind to see that I am?\" he answered, his accents\nvibrating with intense melancholy--\"Can you think I am happy? Does\nthe smile I wear,--the disguising smile men put on as a mask to hide\ntheir secret agonies from the pitiless gaze of unsympathetic\nfellow-creatures,--persuade you that I am free from care? As for my\nwealth,--I have never told you the extent of it; if I did, it might\nindeed amaze you, though I believe it would not now arouse your envy,\nconsidering that your trifling five millions have not been without\neffect in depressing your mind. But I,--I could buy up kingdoms and be\nnone the poorer,--I could throne and unthrone kings and be none the\nwiser,--I could crush whole countries under the iron heel of financial\nspeculation,--I could possess the world,--and yet estimate it at no\nhigher value than I do now,--the value of a grain of dust circling\nthrough infinity, or a soap-bubble blown on the wind!\"\n\nHis brows knitted,--his face expressed pride, scorn and sorrow.\n\n\"There is some mystery about you Lucio;\"--I said--\"Some grief or loss\nthat your wealth cannot repair--and that makes you the strange being you\nare. One day perhaps you will confide in me ...\"\n\nHe laughed loudly,--almost fiercely;--and clapped me heavily on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"I will!\" he said--\"I will tell you my history! And you, excellent\nagnostic as you are, shall 'minister to a mind diseased,' and 'pluck out\nthe memory of a rooted sorrow!' What a power of expression there was in\nShakespeare, the uncrowned but actual King of England! Not the 'rooted\nsorrow' alone was to be 'plucked out' but the very 'memory' of it. The\napparently simple line holds complex wisdom; no doubt the poet knew, or\ninstinctively guessed the most terrible fact in all the Universe ...\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"The eternal consciousness of Memory--\" he replied--\"God can not\nforget,--and in consequence of this, His creatures _may_ not!\"\n\nI forbore to reply, but I suppose my face betrayed my thoughts, for the\ncynical smile I knew so well played round his mouth as he looked at me.\n\n\"I go beyond your patience, do I not!\" he said, laughing again--\"When I\nmention God,--who is declared by certain scientists to be non-existent\nexcept as a blind, indifferent natural Force or Atom-producer;--you are\nbored! I can see that at a glance. Pray forgive me! Let us resume our\ntour of inspection through this charming abode. You will be very\ndifficult to satisfy if you are not a very emperor of contentment\nhere;--with a beautiful wife and plenty of cash, you can well afford to\ngive fame the go-by.\"\n\n\"I may win it yet!\" I said hopefully--\"In this place, I feel I could\nwrite something worthy of being written.\"\n\n\"Good! The 'divine flutterings' of winged thoughts are in your brain!\nApollo grant them strength to fly! And now let us have\nluncheon,--afterwards we shall have time to take a stroll.\"\n\nIn the dining-room I found an elegant repast prepared, which rather\nsurprised me, as I had given no orders, having indeed forgotten to do\nso. Lucio however had, it appeared, not forgotten, and an advance\ntelegram from him had placed certain caterers at Leamington on their\nmettle, with the result that we sat down to a feast as delicate and\nluxurious as any two epicures could desire.\n\n\"Now I want you to do me a favour, Geoffrey,\"--said Lucio, during our\nluncheon--\"You will scarcely need to reside here till after your\nmarriage; you have too many engagements in town. You spoke of\nentertaining a big house-party down here,--I wouldn't do that if I were\nyou,--it isn't worth while. You would have to get in a staff of\nservants, and leave them all afterwards to their own devices while you\nare on your honeymoon. This is what I propose,--give a grand f\u00c3\u00aate here\nin honour of your betrothal to Lady Sibyl, in May--and let me be the\nmaster of the revels!\"\n\nI was in the mood to agree to anything,--moreover the idea seemed an\nexcellent one. I said so and Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez went on quickly--\n\n\"You understand of course, that if I undertake to do a thing I always do\nit thoroughly, and brook no interference with my plans. Now as your\nmarriage will be the signal for our parting,--at any rate for a time,--I\nshould like to show my appreciation of your friendship, by organizing a\nbrilliant affair of the kind I suggest,--and if you will leave it all to\nme, I guarantee you shall hold such a f\u00c3\u00aate as has never been seen or\nknown in England. And it will be a personal satisfaction to me if you\nconsent to my proposal.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow--\" I answered--\"Of course I consent--willingly! I give\nyou _carte blanche_,--do as you like; do all you like! It is most\nfriendly and kind of you! But when are we to make this sensation?\"\n\n\"You are to be married in June?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,--in the second week of the month.\"\n\n\"Very well. The f\u00c3\u00aate shall be held on the twenty-second of May,--that\nwill give society time to recover from the effect of one burst of\nsplendour in order to be ready for another,--namely the wedding. Now we\nneed not talk of this any more--it is settled,--the rest devolves on me.\nWe've got three or four hours to spare before we take the train back to\ntown,--suppose we take a saunter through the grounds?\"\n\nI assented to this, and accompanied him readily, feeling in high spirits\nand good humour. Willowsmere and its peaceful loveliness seemed to\ncleanse my mind of all corroding influences;--the blessed silence of the\nwoods and hills, after the rush and roar of town life, soothed and\ncheered me, and I walked beside my companion with a light heart and\nsmiling face,--happy, and filled with a dim religious faith in the blue\nsky, if not in the God beyond it. We sauntered through the fair gardens\nwhich were now mine, and then out through the park into a lovely little\nlane,--a true Warwickshire lane, where the celandines were strewing the\ngrass with their bright gold coinage, and the star-wort thrust up fairy\nbouquets of white bloom between buttercups and lover, and where the\nhawthorn-buds were beginning to show themselves like minute snow-pellets\namong the glossy young green. A thrush warbled melodiously,--a lark rose\nfrom almost our very feet and flung itself joyously into the sky with a\nwild outburst of song,--a robin hopped through a little hole in the\nhedge to look at us in blithe inquisitiveness as we passed. All at once\nLucio stopped and laid his hand on my shoulder,--his eyes had the\nbeautiful melancholy of a far-off longing which I could neither\nunderstand nor define.\n\n\"Listen, Geoffrey!\" he said--\"Listen to the silence of the earth while\nthe lark sings! Have you ever observed the receptive attitude in which\nNature seems to wait for sounds divine!\"\n\nI did not answer,--the silence around us was indeed impressive;--the\nwarbling of the thrush had ceased, and only the lark's clear voice\npealing over-head, echoed sweetly through the stillness of the lane.\n\n\"In the clerical Heaven,\" went on Lucio dreamily--\"there are no birds.\nThere are only conceited human souls braying forth 'Alleluia'! No\nflowers are included,--no trees; only 'golden streets.' What a poor and\nbarbarous conception! As if a World inhabited by Deity would not contain\nthe wonders, graces and beauties of all worlds! Even this little planet\nis more naturally beautiful than the clerical Heaven,--that is, it is\nbeautiful wherever Man is not. I protest--I have always\nprotested,--against the creation of Man!\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"You protest against your own existence then!\" I said.\n\nHis eyes darkened slowly to a sombre brooding blackness.\n\n\"When the sea roars and flings itself in anger on the shore, it craves\nits prey--Mankind!--it seeks to wash the fair earth clean of the puny\ninsect that troubles the planet's peace! It drowns the noxious creature\nwhen it can, with the aid of its sympathizing comrade the wind! When the\nthunder crashes down a second after the lightning, does it not seem to\nyou that the very clouds combine in the holy war? The war against God's\none mistake;--the making of humanity,--the effort to sweep it out of the\nuniverse as one erases a weak expression in an otherwise perfect Poem!\nYou and I, for example, are the only discords in to-day's woodland\nharmony. We are not particularly grateful for life,--we certainly are\nnot content with it,--we have not the innocence of a bird or a flower.\nWe have more knowledge you will say,--but how can we be sure of that?\nOur wisdom came from the devil in the first place, according to the\nlegend of the tree of knowledge,--the fruit of which taught both good\nand evil, but which still apparently persuades man to evil rather than\ngood, and leads him on to a considerable amount of arrogance besides,\nfor he has an idea he will be immortal as a god in the hereafter,--ye\nmajestic Heavens!--what an inadequately stupendous fate for a grain of\nworthless dust,--a dwarfish atom such as he!\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ have no ideas of immortality\"--I said--\"I have told you that\noften. This life is enough for me,--I want and expect no other.\"\n\n\"Aye, but if there were another!\" answered Lucio, fixing me with a\nsteady look--\"And--if you were not asked your opinion about it--but\nsimply plunged headlong into a state of terrible consciousness in which\nyou would rather not be----\"\n\n\"Oh come,\" I said impatiently--\"do not let us theorise! I am happy\nto-day!--my heart is as light as that of the bird singing in the sky; I\nam in the very best of humours, and could not say an unkind word to my\nworst enemy.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Is that your humour?\" and he took me by the arm--\"Then there could be\nno better opportunity for showing you this pretty little corner of the\nworld;\"--and walking on a few yards, he dexterously turned me down a\nnarrow path, leading from the lane, and brought me face to face with a\nlovely old cottage, almost buried in the green of the young spring\nverdure, and surrounded by an open fence overgrown with hawthorn and\nsweet-briar,--\"Keep firm hold over your temper Geoffrey,--and maintain\nthe benignant tranquillity of your mind!--here dwells the woman whose\nname and fame you hate,--Mavis Clare!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nThe blood rushed to my face, and I stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Let us go back,\" I said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I do not know Miss Clare and do not want to know her. Literary\nwomen are my abhorrence,--they are always more or less unsexed.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of the 'New' women I suppose,--but you flatter\nthem,--they never had any sex to lose. The self-degrading creatures who\ndelineate their fictional heroines as wallowing in unchastity, and who\nwrite freely on subjects which men would hesitate to name, are unnatural\nhybrids of no-sex. Mavis Clare is not one of them,--she is an\n'old-fashioned' young woman. Mademoiselle Derino, the dancer, is\n'unsexed,' but you did not object to her on that score,--on the contrary\nI believe you have shown your appreciation of her talents by spending a\nconsiderable amount of cash upon her.\"\n\n\"That's not a fair comparison\"--I answered hotly--\"Mademoiselle Derino\namused me for a time.\"\n\n\"And was not your rival in art!\" said Lucio with a little malicious\nsmile--\"I see! Still,--as far as the question of being 'unsexed' goes,\nI, personally, consider that a woman who shows the power of her\nintellect is more to be respected than the woman who shows the power of\nher legs. But men always prefer the legs,--just as they prefer the devil\nto the Deity. All the same, I think, as we have time to spare, we may as\nwell see this genius.\"\n\n\"Genius!\" I echoed contemptuously.\n\n\"Feminine twaddler, then!\" he suggested, laughing--\"Let us see this\nfeminine twaddler. She will no doubt prove as amusing as Mademoiselle\nDerino in her way. I shall ring the bell and ask if she is at home.\"\n\nHe advanced towards the creeper-covered porch,--but I stood back,\nmortified and sullen, determined not to accompany him inside the house\nif he were admitted. Suddenly a blithe peal of musical laughter sounded\nthrough the air, and a clear voice exclaimed--\n\n\"Oh Tricksy! You wicked boy! Take it back directly and apologise!\"\n\nLucio peered through the fence, and then beckoned to me energetically.\n\n\"There she is!\" he whispered, \"There is the dyspeptic, sour, savage old\nblue-stocking,--there, on the lawn,--by Heaven!--she's enough to strike\nterror into the heart of any man--and millionaire!\"\n\nI looked where he pointed, and saw nothing but a fair-haired woman in a\nwhite gown, sitting in a low basket-chair, with a tiny toy terrier on\nher lap. The terrier was jealously guarding a large square dog-biscuit\nnearly as big as himself, and at a little distance off sat a magnificent\nrough-coated St Bernard, wagging his feathery tail to and fro, with\nevery sign of good-humour and enjoyment. The position was evident at a\nglance,--the small dog had taken his huge companion's biscuit from him\nand had conveyed it to his mistress,--a canine joke which seemed to be\nappreciated and understood by all the parties concerned. But as I\nwatched the little group, I did not believe that she whom I saw was\nMavis Clare. That small head was surely never made for the wearing of\ndeathless laurels, but rather for a garland of roses, (sweet and\nperishable) twined by a lover's hand. No such slight feminine creature\nas the one I now looked upon could ever be capable of the intellectual\ngrasp and power of 'Differences,' the book I secretly admired and\nwondered at, but which I had anonymously striven to 'quash' in its\nsuccessful career. The writer of such a work, I imagined, must needs be\nof a more or less strong physique, with pronounced features and an\nimpressive personality. This butterfly-thing, playing with her dog, was\nno type of a 'blue-stocking,' and I said as much to Lucio.\n\n\"That cannot be Miss Clare,\" I said--\"More likely a visitor,--or perhaps\nthe companion-secretary. The novelist must be very different in\nappearance to that frivolous young person in white, whose dress is\ndistinctly Parisian, and who seems to have nothing whatever to do but\namuse herself.\"\n\n\"Tricksy!\" said the clear voice again--\"Take back the biscuit and\napologise!\"\n\nThe tiny terrier looked round with an innocently abstracted air, as if\nin the earnestness of his own thoughts, he had not quite caught the\nmeaning of the sentence.\n\n\"Tricksy!\" and the voice became more imperative--\"Take it back and\napologise!\"\n\nWith a comical expression of resignation to circumstances, 'Tricksy'\nseized the large biscuit, and holding it in his teeth with gingerly\ncare, jumped from his mistress's knee and trotting briskly up to the St\nBernard who was still wagging his tail and smiling as visibly as dogs\noften can smile, restored his stolen goods with three short yapping\nbarks as much as to say \"There! take it!\" The St Bernard rose in all his\nmajestic bulk and sniffed at it,--then sniffed his small friend,\napparently in dignified doubt as to which was terrier and which was\nbiscuit,--then lying down again, he gave himself up to the pleasure of\nmunching his meal, the while \"Tricksy\" with wild barks of delight\nperformed a sort of mad war-dance round and round him by way of\nentertainment. This piece of dog-comedy was still going on, when Lucio\nturned away from his point of observation at the fence, and going up to\nthe gate, rang the bell. A neat maid-servant answered the summons.\n\n\"Is Miss Clare at home?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes sir. But I am not sure whether she will receive you,--\" the maid\nreplied--\"Unless you have an appointment?\"\n\n\"We have no appointment,\"--said Lucio,--\"but if you will take these\ncards,--\" here he turned to me--\"Geoffrey, give me one of yours!\" I\ncomplied, somewhat reluctantly. \"If you will take these cards\"--he\nresumed--\"to Miss Clare, it is just possible she may be kind enough to\nsee us. If not, it will be our loss.\"\n\nHe spoke so gently and with such an ingratiating manner that I could see\nthe servant was at once prepossessed in his favour.\n\n\"Step in, sir, if you please,--\" she said smiling and opening the gate.\nHe obeyed with alacrity,--and I, who a moment ago had resolved not to\nenter the place, found myself passively following him under an archway\nof sprouting young leaves and early budding jessamine into 'Lily\nCottage'--which was to prove one day, though I knew it not then, the\nonly haven of peace and security I should ever crave for,--and, craving,\nbe unable to win!\n\nThe house was much larger than it looked from the outside; the\nentrance-hall was square and lofty, and panelled with fine old carved\noak, and the drawing-room into which we were shown was one of the most\npicturesque and beautiful apartments I had ever seen. There were flowers\neverywhere,--books,--rare bits of china,--elegant trifles that only a\nwoman of perfect taste would have the sense to select and\nappreciate,--on one or two of the side-tables and on the grand piano\nwere autograph-portraits of many of the greatest celebrities in Europe.\nLucio strolled about the room, making soft comments.\n\n\"Here is the Autocrat of all the Russias,\" he said, pausing before a\nfine portrait of the Tsar--\"Signed by the Imperial hand too. Now what\nhas the 'feminine twaddler' done to deserve that honour I wonder! Here\nin strange contrast, is the wild-haired Paderewski,--and beside him the\nperennial Patti,--there is Her Majesty of Italy, and here we have the\nPrince of Wales,--all autographed likenesses. Upon my word, Miss Clare\nseems to attract a great many notabilities around her without the aid of\nhard cash. I wonder how she does it, Geoffrey?\"--and his eyes sparkled\nhalf maliciously--\"Can it be a case of genius after all? Look at those\nlilies!\" and he pointed to a mass of white bloom in one of the\nwindows--\"Are they not far more beautiful creatures than men and women?\nDumb--yet eloquent of purity!--no wonder the painters choose them as the\nonly flowers suitable for the adornment of angels.\"\n\nAs he spoke the door opened, and the woman we had seen on the lawn\nentered, carrying her toy terrier on one arm. Was she Mavis Clare? or\nsome-one sent to say that the novelist could not receive us? I wondered\nsilently, looking at her in surprise and something of confusion,--Lucio\nadvanced with an odd mingling of humility and appeal in his manner which\nwas new to me.\n\n\"We must apologise for our intrusion, Miss Clare,\"--he said--\"But\nhappening to pass your house, we could not resist making an attempt to\nsee you. My name is----Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez\"--he hesitated oddly for a second, then\nwent on--\"and this is my friend Mr Geoffrey Tempest, the author,----\"\nthe young lady raised her eyes to mine with a little smile and courteous\nbend of her head--\"he has, as I daresay you know, become the owner of\nWillowsmere Court. You will be neighbours, and I hope, friends. In any\ncase if we have committed a breach of etiquette in venturing to call\nupon you without previous introduction, you must try and forgive us! It\nis difficult,--to me impossible,--to pass the dwelling of a celebrity\nwithout offering homage to the presiding genius within.\"\n\nMavis Clare,--for it was Mavis Clare,--seemed not to have heard the\nintended compliment.\n\n\"You are very welcome,\" she said simply, advancing with a pretty grace,\nand extending her hand to each of us in turn, \"I am quite accustomed to\nvisits from strangers. But I already know Mr Tempest very well by\nreputation. Won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe motioned us to chairs in the lily-decked window-corner, and rang the\nbell. Her maid appeared.\n\n\"Tea, Janet.\"\n\nThis order given, she seated herself near us, still holding her little\ndog curled up against her like a small ball of silk. I tried to\nconverse, but could find nothing suitable to say,--the sight of her\nfilled me with too great a sense of self-reproach and shame. She was\nsuch a quiet graceful creature, so slight and dainty, so perfectly\nunaffected and simple in manner, that as I thought of the slaughtering\narticle I had written against her work I felt like a low brute who had\nbeen stoning a child. And yet,--after all it was her genius I\nhated,--the force and passion of that mystic quality which wherever it\nappears, compels the world's attention,--this was the gift she had that\nI lacked and coveted. Moved by the most conflicting sensations I gazed\nabstractedly out on the shady old garden,--I heard Lucio conversing on\ntrifling matters of society and literature generally, and every now and\nthen her bright laugh rang out like a little peal of bells. Soon I felt,\nrather than saw, that she was looking steadily at me,--and turning, I\nmet her eyes,--deep dense blue eyes, candidly grave and clear.\n\n\"Is this your first visit to Willowsmere Court?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, making an effort to appear more at my ease--\"I bought\nthe place,--on the recommendation of my friend the prince here,--without\nlooking at it.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\"--she said, still observing me curiously--\"And you are\nsatisfied with it?\"\n\n\"More than satisfied--I am delighted. It exceeds all my best\nexpectations.\"\n\n\"Mr Tempest is going to marry the daughter of the former owner of\nWillowsmere,\"--put in Lucio,--\"No doubt you have seen it announced in\nthe papers?\"\n\n\"Yes;\"--she responded with a slight smile--\"I have seen it--and I think\nMr Tempest is much to be congratulated. Lady Sibyl is very lovely,--I\nremember her as a beautiful child when I was a child myself--I never\nspoke to her, but I often saw her. She must be charmed at the prospect\nof returning as a bride to the old home she loved so well.\"\n\nHere the servant entered with the tea, and Miss Clare, putting down her\ntiny dog, went to the table to dispense it. I watched her move across\nthe room with a sense of vague wonder and reluctant admiration,--she\nrather resembled a picture by Greuze in her soft white gown with a pale\nrose nestled amid the old Flemish lace at her throat,--and as she turned\nher head towards us, the sunlight caught her fair hair and turned it to\nthe similitude of a golden halo circling her brows. She was not a\nbeauty; but she possessed an undoubted individual charm,--a delicate\nattractiveness, which silently asserted itself, as the breath of\nhoneysuckle hidden in the tangles of a hedge, will delight the wayfarer\nwith sweet fragrance though the flowers be unseen.\n\n\"Your book was very clever, Mr Tempest\"--she said suddenly, smiling at\nme--\"I read it as soon as it came out. But do you know I think your\narticle was even cleverer?\"\n\nI felt myself growing uncomfortably red in the face.\n\n\"To what article do you allude, Miss Clare?\" I stammered confusedly--\"I\ndo not write for any magazine.\"\n\n\"No?\" and she laughed gaily--\"But you did on this occasion! You 'slated'\nme very smartly!--I quite enjoyed it. I found out that you were the\nauthor of the philippic,--not through the editor of the journal--oh no,\npoor man! he is very discreet; but through quite another person who must\nbe nameless. It is very difficult to prevent me from finding out\nwhatever I wish to know, especially in literary matters! Why, you look\nquite unhappy!\" and her blue eyes danced with fun as she handed me my\ncup of tea--\"You really don't suppose I was hurt by your critique, do\nyou? Dear me, no! Nothing of that kind ever affronts me,--I am far too\nbusy to waste any thought on reviews or reviewers. Only your article was\nso exceptionally funny!\"\n\n\"Funny?\" I echoed stupidly, trying to smile, but failing in the effort.\n\n\"Yes, funny!\" she repeated--\"It was so very angry that it became\namusing. My poor 'Differences'! I am really sorry it put you into such a\ntemper,--temper does exhaust one's energies so!\"\n\nShe laughed again and sat down in her former place near me, regarding me\nwith a frankly open and half humorous gaze which I found I could not\nmeet with any sort of composure. To say I felt foolish, would\ninadequately express my sense of utter bafflement. This woman with her\nyoung unclouded face, sweet voice and evidently happy nature, was not at\nall the creature I had imagined her to be,--and I struggled to say\nsomething,--anything,--that would furnish a reasonable and coherent\nanswer. I caught Lucio's glance,--one of satirical amusement,--and my\nthoughts grew more entangled than ever. A distraction however occurred\nin the behaviour of the dog Tricksy, who suddenly took up a position\nimmediately opposite Lucio, and lifting his nose in air began to howl\nwith a desolate loudness astonishing in so small an animal. His mistress\nwas surprised.\n\n\"Tricksy, what _is_ the matter?\" she exclaimed, catching him up in her\narms where he hid his face shivering and moaning;--then she looked\nsteadily at Lucio--\"I never knew him do such a thing before\"--she\nsaid--\"Perhaps you do not like dogs, Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez?\"\n\n\"I am afraid they do not like _me_!\" he replied, deferentially.\n\n\"Then pray excuse me a moment!\" she murmured, and left the room, to\nreturn immediately without her canine favorite. After this I noticed\nthat her blue eyes often rested on Lucio's handsome countenance with a\nbewildered and perplexed expression, as if she saw something in his very\nbeauty that she disliked or distrusted. Meanwhile I had recovered a\nlittle of my usual self-possession, and I addressed her in a tone which\nI meant to be kind, but which I knew was somewhat patronizing.\n\n\"I am very glad, Miss Clare, that you were not offended at the article\nyou speak of. It was rather strong I admit,--but you know we cannot all\nbe of the same opinion ...\"\n\n\"Indeed no!\" she said quietly and with a slight smile--\"Such a state of\nthings would make a very dull world! I assure you I was not and am not\nin the least offended--the critique was a smart piece of writing, and\nmade not the slightest effect on me or on my book. You remember what\nShelley wrote of critics? No? You will find the passage in his preface\nto 'The Revolt of Islam,' and it runs thus,--'I have sought to write as\nI believe that Homer, Shakespeare, and Milton wrote, with an utter\ndisregard of anonymous censure. I am certain that calumny and\nmisrepresentation, though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my\npeace. I shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious\nenemies who dare not trust themselves to speak. I shall endeavour to\nextract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions, those\nadmonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such\ncensurers may discern in my appeal to the Public. If certain Critics\nwere as clear-sighted as they are malignant, how great would be the\nbenefit to be derived from their virulent writings! As it is, I fear I\nshall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame\ninvectives. Should the public judge that my composition is worthless, I\nshall indeed bow before the tribunal from which Milton received his\ncrown of immortality, and shall seek to gather, if I live, strength from\nthat defeat, which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which\nmay _not_ be worthless!'\"\n\nAs she gave the quotation, her eyes darkened and deepened,--her face was\nlighted up as by some inward illumination,--and I discovered the rich\nsweetness of the voice which made the name of 'Mavis' suit her so well.\n\n\"You see I know my Shelley!\" she said with a little laugh at her own\nemotion--\"And those words are particularly familiar to me, because I\nhave had them painted up on a panel in my study. Just to remind me, in\ncase I should forget, what the really great geniuses of the world\nthought of criticism,--because their example is very encouraging and\nhelpful to a humble little worker like myself. I am not a\npress-favourite--and I never get good reviews,--but--\" and she laughed\nagain--\"I like my reviewers all the same! If you have finished your tea,\nwill you come and see them?\"\n\nCome and see them! What did she mean? She seemed delighted at my visible\nsurprise, and her cheeks dimpled with merriment.\n\n\"Come and see them!\" she repeated--\"They generally expect me at this\nhour!\"\n\nShe led the way into the garden,--we followed,--I, in a bewildered\nconfusion of mind, with all my ideas respecting 'unsexed females' and\nrepulsive blue-stockings upset by the unaffected behaviour and charming\nfrankness of this 'celebrity' whose fame I envied, and whose personality\nI could not but admire. With all her intellectual gifts she was yet a\nlovable woman,--ah Mavis!--how lovable and dear I was destined in misery\nto know! Mavis, Mavis!--I whisper your sweet name in my solitude,--I see\nyou in my dreams, and kneeling before you I call you Angel!--my angel at\nthe gate of a lost Paradise, whose Sword of Genius turning every way,\nkeeps me back from all approach to my forfeited Tree of Life!\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nScarcely had we stepped out on the lawn before an unpleasant incident\noccurred which might have ended dangerously. At his mistress's approach\nthe big St Bernard dog rose from the sunny corner where he had been\npeacefully dozing, and prepared to greet her,--but as soon as he\nperceived us he stopped short with an ominous growl. Before Miss Clare\ncould utter a warning word, he made a couple of huge bounds and sprang\nsavagely at Lucio as though to tear him in pieces,--Lucio with admirable\npresence of mind caught him firmly by the throat and forced him\nbackwards. Mavis turned deathly pale.\n\n\"Let me hold him! He will obey me!\" she cried, placing her little hand\non the great dog's neck--\"Down, Emperor! Down! How dare you! Down sir!\"\n\nIn a moment 'Emperor' dropped to the ground, and crouched abjectly at\nher feet, breathing heavily and trembling in every limb. She held him by\nthe collar, and looked up at Lucio who was perfectly composed, though\nhis eyes flashed dangerously.\n\n\"I am so very sorry!\" she murmured,--\"I forgot,--you told me dogs do not\nlike you. But what a singularly marked antipathy, is it not? I cannot\nunderstand it. Emperor is generally so good-natured,--I must apologize\nfor his bad conduct--it is quite unusual. I hope he has not hurt you?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" returned Lucio affably but with a cold smile; \"I hope I\nhave not hurt _him_,--or distressed _you_!\"\n\nShe made no reply, but led the St Bernard away and was absent for a few\nminutes. While she was gone, Lucio's brow clouded, and his face grew\nvery stern.\n\n\"What do you think of her?\" he asked me abruptly.\n\n\"I hardly know what to think,\" I answered abstractedly--\"She is very\ndifferent to what I imagined. Her dogs are rather unpleasant company!\"\n\n\"They are honest animals!\" he said morosely--\"They are no doubt\naccustomed to candour in their mistress, and therefore object to\npersonified lies.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself!\" I said irritably--\"They object to you, chiefly.\"\n\n\"Am I not fully aware of that?\" he retorted--\"and do I not speak for\nmyself? You do not suppose I would call you a personified lie, do\nyou,--even if it were true! I would not be so uncivil. But I am a living\nlie, and knowing it I admit it, which gives me a certain claim to\nhonesty above the ordinary run of men. This woman-wearer of laurels is a\npersonified truth!--imagine it!--she has no occasion to pretend to be\nanything else than she is! No wonder she is famous!\"\n\nI said nothing, as just then the subject of our conversation returned,\ntranquil and smiling, and did her best, with the tact and grace of a\nperfect hostess, to make us forget her dog's ferocious conduct, by\nescorting us through all the prettiest turns and twisting paths of her\ngarden, which was quite a bower of spring beauty. She talked to us both\nwith equal ease, brightness and cleverness, though I observed that she\nstudied Lucio with close interest, and watched his looks and movements\nwith more curiosity than liking. Passing under an arching grove of\nbudding syringas, we presently came to an open court-yard paved with\nblue and white tiles, having in its centre a picturesque dove-cote built\nin the form of a Chinese pagoda. Here pausing, Mavis clapped her hands.\nA cloud of doves, white, grey, brown, and opalescent answered the\nsummons, circling round and round her head, and flying down in excited\ngroups at her feet.\n\n\"Here are my reviewers!\" she said laughing--\"Are they not pretty\ncreatures? The ones I know best are named after their respective\njournals,--there are plenty of anonymous ones of course, who flock in\nwith the rest. Here, for instance, is the 'Saturday Review'\"--and she\npicked up a strutting bird with coral-tinted feet, who seemed to rather\nlike the attention shown to him--\"He fights with all his companions and\ndrives them away from the food whenever he can. He is a quarrelsome\ncreature!\"--here she stroked the bird's head--\"You never know how to\nplease him,--he takes offence at the corn sometimes and will only eat\npeas, or _vice versa_. He quite deserves his name,--go away, old boy!\"\nand she flung the pigeon in the air and watched it soaring up and\ndown--\"He _is_ such a comical old grumbler! There is the 'Speaker'\"--and\nshe pointed to a fat fussy fantail--\"He struts very well, and fancies\nhe's important, you know, but he isn't. Over there is 'Public\nOpinion,'--that one half-asleep on the wall; next to him is the\n'Spectator,'--you see he has two rings round his eyes like spectacles.\nThat brown creature with the fluffy wings all by himself on that\nflower-pot is the 'Nineteenth Century,'--the little bird with the green\nneck is the 'Westminster Gazette,' and the fat one sitting on the\nplatform of the cote is the 'Pall-Mall.' He knows his name very\nwell--see!\" and she called merrily--\"Pall Mall! Come boy!--come here!\"\nThe bird obeyed at once, and flying down from the cote settled on her\nshoulder. \"There are so many others,--it is difficult to distinguish\nthem sometimes,\"--she continued,--\"Whenever I get a bad review I name a\npigeon,--it amuses me. That draggle-tailed one with the muddy feet is\nthe 'Sketch,'--he is not at all a well-bred bird I must tell you!--that\nsmart-looking dove with the purple breast is the 'Graphic,' and that\nbland old grey thing is the 'I. L. N.' short for 'Illustrated London\nNews.' Those three white ones are respectively 'Daily Telegraph,'\n'Morning Post,' and 'Standard.' Now see them all!\" and taking a covered\nbasket from a corner she began to scatter corn and peas and various\ngrains in lavish quantities all over the court. For a moment we could\nscarcely see the sky, so thickly the birds flocked together, struggling,\nfighting, swooping downwards, and soaring upwards,--but the wing\u00c3\u00abd\nconfusion soon gave place to something like order when they were all on\nthe ground and busy, selecting their respective favourite foods from the\ndifferent sorts provided for their choice.\n\n\"You are indeed a sweet-natured philosopher\"--said Lucio smiling, \"if\nyou can symbolize your adverse reviewers by a flock of doves!\"\n\nShe laughed merrily.\n\n\"Well, it is a remedy against all irritation,\"--she returned; \"I used to\nworry a good deal over my work, and wonder why it was that the press\npeople were so unnecessarily hard upon me, when they showed so much\nleniency and encouragement to far worse writers,--but after a little\nserious consideration, finding that critical opinion carried no sort of\nconviction whatever to the public, I determined to trouble no more about\nit,--except in the way of doves!\"\n\n\"In the way of doves, you feed your reviewers,\"--I observed.\n\n\"Exactly! And I suppose I help to feed them even as women and men!\" she\nsaid--\"They get something from their editors for 'slashing' my\nwork,--and they probably make a little more out of selling their 'review\ncopies.' So you see the dove-emblem holds good throughout. But you have\nnot seen the 'Athen\u00c3\u00a6um,'--oh, you _must_ see him!\"\n\nWith laughter still lurking in her blue eyes, she took us out of the\npigeon-court, and led the way round to a sequestered and shady corner of\nthe garden, where, in a large aviary-cage fitted up for its special\nconvenience, sat a solemn white owl. The instant it perceived us, it\nbecame angry, and ruffling up its downy feathers, rolled its glistening\nyellow eyes vindictively and opened its beak. Two smaller owls sat in\nthe background, pressed close together,--one grey, the other brown.\n\n\"Cross old boy!\" said Mavis, addressing the spiteful-looking creature\nin the sweetest of accents--\"Haven't you found any mice to kill to-day?\nOh, what wicked eyes!--what a snappy mouth!\" Then turning to us, she\nwent on--\"Isn't he a lovely owl? Doesn't he look wise?--but as a matter\nof fact he's just as stupid as ever he can be. That is why I call him\nthe 'Athen\u00c3\u00a6um'! He looks so profound, you'd fancy he knows everything,\nbut he really thinks of nothing but killing mice all the time,--which\nlimits his intelligence considerably!\"\n\nLucio laughed heartily, and so did I,--she looked so mischievous and\nmerry.\n\n\"But there are two other owls in the cage\"--I said--\"What are their\nnames?\"\n\nShe held up a little finger in playful warning.\n\n\"Ah, that would be telling secrets!\" she said--\"They're all the\n'Athen\u00c3\u00a6um'--the holy Three,--a sort of literary Trinity. But why a\ntrinity I do not venture to explain!--it is a riddle I must leave you to\nguess!\"\n\nShe moved on, and we followed across a velvety grass-plot bordered with\nbright spring-flowers, such as crocuses, tulips, anemones, and\nhyacinths, and presently pausing she asked--\"Would you care to see my\nwork-room?\"\n\nI found myself agreeing to this proposition with an almost boyish\nenthusiasm. Lucio glanced at me with a slight half-cynical smile.\n\n\"Miss Clare, are you going to name a pigeon after Mr Tempest?\" he\ninquired--\"He played the part of an adverse critic, you know--but I\ndoubt whether he will ever do so again!\"\n\nShe looked round at me and smiled.\n\n\"Oh, I have been merciful to Mr Tempest,\"--she replied; \"He is among the\nanonymous birds whom I do not specially recognise!\"\n\nShe stepped into the arched embrasure of an open window which fronted\nthe view of the grass and flowers, and entering with her we found\nourselves in a large room, octagonal in shape, where the first object\nthat attracted and riveted the attention was a marble bust of the\nPallas Athene whose grave impassive countenance and tranquil brows\ndirectly faced the sun. A desk strewn with papers occupied the left-hand\nside of the window-nook,--in a corner draped with olive-green velvet,\nthe white presence of the Apollo Belvedere taught in his inscrutable yet\nradiant smile, the lesson of love and the triumphs of fame,--and numbers\nof books were about, not ranged in formal rows on shelves as if they\nwere never read, but placed on low tables and wheeled stands, that they\nmight be easily taken up and glanced at. The arrangement of the walls\nchiefly excited my interest and admiration, for these were divided into\npanels, and every panel had, inscribed upon it in letters of gold, some\nphrase from the philosophers, or some verse from the poets. The passage\nfrom Shelley which Mavis had recently quoted to us, occupied, as she had\nsaid, one panel, and above it hung a beautiful bas-relief of the drowned\npoet copied from the monument at Via Reggio. Another and broader panel\nheld a fine engraving of Shakespeare, and under the picture appeared the\nlines--\n\n      \"To thine own self be true,\n  And it must follow as the night the day,\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"\n\nByron was represented,--also Keats; but it would have taken more than a\nday to examine the various suggestive quaintnesses and individual charms\nof this 'workshop' as its owner called it, though the hour was to come\nwhen I should know every corner of it by heart, and look upon it as a\nhaunted outlaw of bygone ages looked upon 'sanctuary.' But now time gave\nus little pause,--and when we had sufficiently expressed our pleasure\nand gratitude for the kindness with which we had been received, Lucio,\nglancing at his watch, suggested departure.\n\n\"We could stay on here for an indefinite period Miss Clare,\"--he said\nwith an unwonted softness in his dark eyes; \"It is a place for peace and\nhappy meditation,--a restful corner for a tired soul.\" He checked a\nslight sigh,--then went on--\"But trains wait for no man, and we are\nreturning to town to-night.\"\n\n\"Then I will not detain you any longer,\" said our young hostess, leading\nthe way at once by a side-door, through a passage filled with flowering\nplants, into the drawing-room where she had first entertained us--\"I\nhope, Mr Tempest,\" she added, smiling at me,--\"that now we have met, you\nwill no longer desire to qualify as one of my pigeons! It is scarcely\nworth while!\"\n\n\"Miss Clare,\" I said, now speaking with unaffected sincerity--\"I assure\nyou, on my honour, I am very sorry I wrote that article against you. If\nI had only known you as you are--\"\n\n\"Oh, that should make no difference to a critic!\" she answered merrily.\n\n\"It would have made a great difference to me\"--I declared; \"You are so\nunlike the objectionable 'literary woman,'--\" I paused, and she regarded\nme smilingly with her bright clear candid eyes,--then I added--\"I must\ntell you that Sibyl,--Lady Sibyl Elton--is one of your most ardent\nadmirers.\"\n\n\"I am very pleased to hear that,\"--she said simply--\"I am always glad\nwhen I succeed in winning somebody's approval and liking.\"\n\n\"Does not everyone approve and admire you?\" asked Lucio.\n\n\"Oh no! By no means! The 'Saturday' says I only win the applause of\nshop-girls!\" and she laughed--\"Poor old 'Saturday'!--the writers on its\nstaff are so jealous of any successful author. I told the Prince of\nWales what it said the other day, and he was very much amused.\"\n\n\"You know the Prince?\" I asked, in a little surprise.\n\n\"Well, it would be more correct to say that he knows me,\" she\nreplied--\"He has been very amiable in taking some little interest in my\nbooks. He knows a good deal about literature too,--much more than people\ngive him credit for. He has been here more than once,--and has seen me\nfeed my reviewers--the pigeons, you know! He rather enjoyed the fun I\nthink!\"\n\nAnd this was all the result of the 'slating' the press gave to Mavis\nClare! Simply that she named her doves after her critics, and fed them\nin the presence of whatever royal or distinguished visitors she might\nhave (and I afterwards learned she had many) amid, no doubt, much\nlaughter from those who saw the 'Spectator'-pigeon fighting for grains\nof corn, or the 'Saturday Review' pigeon quarrelling over peas!\nEvidently no reviewer, spiteful or otherwise, could affect the vivacious\nnature of such a mischievous elf as she was.\n\n\"How different you are--how widely different--to the ordinary run of\nliterary people!\" I said involuntarily.\n\n\"I am glad you find me so,\"--she answered--\"I hope I _am_ different. As\na rule literary people take themselves far too seriously, and attach too\nmuch importance to what they do. That is why they become such bores. I\ndon't believe anyone ever did thoroughly good work who was not perfectly\nhappy over it, and totally indifferent to opinion. I should be quite\ncontent to write on, if I only had a garret to live in. I was once very\npoor,--shockingly poor; and even now I am not rich, but I've got just\nenough to keep me working steadily, which is as it should be. If I had\nmore, I might get lazy and neglect my work,--then you know Satan might\nstep into my life, and it would be a question of idle hands and mischief\nto follow, according to the adage.\"\n\n\"I think you would have strength enough to resist Satan,--\" said Lucio,\nlooking at her stedfastly, with sombre scrutiny in his expressive eyes.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,--I could not be sure of myself!\" and she\nsmiled--\"I should imagine he must be a dangerously fascinating\npersonage. I never picture him as the possessor of hoofs and a\ntail,--common-sense assures me that no creature presenting himself under\nsuch an aspect would have the slightest power to attract. Milton's\nconception of Satan is the finest\"--and her eyes darkened swiftly with\nthe intensity of her thoughts--\"A mighty Angel fallen!--one cannot but\nbe sorry for such a fall, if the legend were true!\"\n\nThere was a sudden silence. A bird sang outside, and a little breeze\nswayed the lilies in the window to and fro.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mavis Clare!\" said Lucio very softly, almost tenderly. His\nvoice was low and tremulous--his face grave and pale. She looked up at\nhim in a little surprise.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" she rejoined, extending her small hand. He held it a\nmoment,--then, to my secret astonishment, knowing his aversion to women,\nstooped and kissed it. She flushed rosily as she withdrew it from his\nclasp.\n\n\"Be always as you are Mavis Clare!\"--he said gently--\"Let nothing change\nyou! Keep that bright nature of yours,--that unruffled spirit of quiet\ncontentment, and you may wear the bitter laurel of fame as sweetly as a\nrose! I have seen the world; I have travelled far, and have met many\nfamous men and women,--kings and queens, senators, poets and\nphilosophers,--my experience has been wide and varied, so that I am not\naltogether without authority for what I say,--and I assure you that the\nSatan of whom you are able to speak with compassion, can never trouble\nthe peace of a pure and contented soul. Like consorts with like,--a\nfallen angel seeks the equally fallen,--and the devil,--if there be\none,--becomes the companion of those only who take pleasure in his\nteaching and society. Legends say he is afraid of a crucifix,--but if he\nis afraid of anything I should say it must be of that 'sweet content'\nconcerning which your country's Shakespeare sings, and which is a better\ndefence against evil than the church or the prayers of the clergy! I\nspeak as one having the right of age to speak,--I am so many many years\nolder than you!----you must forgive me if I have said too much!\"\n\nShe was quite silent; evidently moved and surprised at his words; and\nshe gazed at him with a vaguely wondering, half-awed expression,--an\nexpression which changed directly I myself advanced to make my adieu.\n\n\"I am very glad to have met you, Miss Clare,\"--I said--\"I hope we shall\nbe friends!\"\n\n\"There is no reason why we should be enemies I think,\" she responded\nfrankly--\"I am very pleased you came to-day. If ever you want to 'slate'\nme again, you know your fate!--you become a dove,--nothing more!\nGood-bye!\"\n\nShe saluted us prettily as we passed out, and when the gate had closed\nbehind us we heard the deep and joyous baying of the great dog\n'Emperor,' evidently released from 'durance vile' immediately on our\ndeparture. We walked on for some time in silence, and it was not till we\nhad re-entered the grounds of Willowsmere, and were making our way to\nthe drive where the carriage which was to take us to the station already\nawaited us, that Lucio said--\n\n\"Well; now, what do you think of her?\"\n\n\"She is as unlike the accepted ideal of the female novelist as she can\nwell be,\" I answered, with a laugh.\n\n\"Accepted ideals are generally mistaken ones,\"--he observed, watching me\nnarrowly--\"An accepted ideal of Divinity in some church pictures is an\nold man's face set in a triangle. The accepted ideal of the devil is a\nnondescript creature, with horns, hoofs (one of them cloven) and a tail,\nas Miss Clare just now remarked. The accepted ideal of beauty is the\nVenus de Medicis,--whereas your Lady Sibyl entirely transcends that much\nover-rated statue. The accepted ideal of a poet is Apollo,--he was a\ngod,--and no poet in the flesh ever approaches the god-like! And the\naccepted ideal of the female novelist, is an elderly, dowdy, spectacled,\nfrowsy fright,--Mavis Clare does not fulfil this description, yet she is\nthe author of 'Differences.' Now McWhing, who thrashes her continually\nin all the papers he can command, _is_ elderly, ugly, spectacled and\nfrowsy,--and he is the author of--nothing! Women-authors are invariably\nsupposed to be hideous,--men-authors for the most part _are_ hideous.\nBut their hideousness is not noted or insisted upon,--whereas, no matter\nhow good-looking women-writers may be, they still pass under\npress-comment as frights, because the fiat of press-opinion considers\nthey ought to be frights, even if they are not. A pretty authoress is an\noffence,--an incongruity,--a something that neither men nor women care\nabout. Men don't care about her, because being clever and independent,\nshe does not often care about them,--women don't care about her, because\nshe has the effrontery to combine attractive looks with intelligence,\nand she makes an awkward rival to those who have only attractive looks\nwithout intelligence. So wags the world!--\n\n  O wild world!--circling through \u00c3\u00a6ons untold,--\n  'Mid fires of sunrise and sunset,--through flashes of silver and\n      gold,--\n  Grain of dust in a storm,--atom of sand by the sea,--\n  What is your worth, O world, to the Angels of God and me!\n\nHe sang this quite suddenly, his rich baritone pealing out musically on\nthe warm silent air. I listened entranced.\n\n\"What a voice you have!\" I exclaimed--\"What a glorious gift!\"\n\nHe smiled, and sang on, his dark eyes flashing--\n\n  O wild world! Mote in a burning ray\n  Flung from the spherical Heavens millions of spaces away--\n  Sink in the ether or soar! Live with the planets or die!--\n  What should I care for your fate, who am one with the Infinite Sky!\n\n\"What strange song is that?\" I asked, startled and thrilled by the\npassion of his voice--\"It seems to mean nothing!\"\n\nHe laughed, and took my arm.\n\n\"It does mean nothing!\" he said--\"All drawing-room songs mean nothing.\nMine is a drawing-room song--calculated to waken emotional impulses in\nthe unloved spinster religiously inclined!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, smiling.\n\n\"Exactly! That is what I say. It _is_ nonsense!\" Here we came up to the\ncarriage which waited for us--\"Just twenty minutes to catch the train,\nGeoffrey! Off we go!\"\n\nAnd off we did go,--I watching the red gabled roofs of Willowsmere Court\nshining in the late sunshine, till a turn in the road hid them from\nview.\n\n\"You like your purchase?\" queried Lucio presently.\n\n\"I do. Immensely!\"\n\n\"And your rival, Mavis Clare? Do you like her?\"\n\nI paused a moment, then answered frankly,\n\n\"Yes. I like her. And I will admit something more than that to you now.\nI like her book. It is a noble work,--worthy of the most highly-gifted\nman. I always liked it--and because I liked it, I slated it.\"\n\n\"Rather a mysterious course of procedure!\" and he smiled; \"Can you not\nexplain?\"\n\n\"Of course I can explain,\"--I said--\"Explanation is easy. I envied her\npower--I envy it still. Her popularity caused me a smarting sense of\ninjury, and to relieve it I wrote that article against her. But I shall\nnever do anything of the kind again. I shall let her grow her laurels in\npeace.\"\n\n\"Laurels have a habit of growing without any permission,\"--observed\nLucio significantly--\"In all sorts of unexpected places too. And they\ncan never be properly cultivated in the forcing-house of criticism.\"\n\n\"I know that!\" I said quickly, my thoughts reverting to my own book, and\nall the favourable criticisms that had been heaped upon it--\"I have\nlearned that lesson thoroughly, by heart!\"\n\nHe looked at me fixedly.\n\n\"It is only one of many you may have yet to learn\"--he said--\"It is a\nlesson in fame. Your next course of instruction will be in love!\"\n\nHe smiled,--but I was conscious of a certain dread and discomfort as he\nspoke. I thought of Sibyl and her incomparable beauty----Sibyl, who had\ntold me she could not love,--had we both to learn a lesson? And should\nwe master it?--or would it master us?\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nThe preparations for my marriage now went on apace,--shoals of presents\nbegan to arrive for Sibyl as well as for myself, and I was introduced to\nan hitherto undemonstrated phase (as far as I personally was concerned)\nof the vulgarity and hypocrisy of fashionable society. Everyone knew the\nextent of my wealth, and how little real necessity there was for\noffering me or my bride-elect costly gifts; nevertheless, all our\nso-called 'friends' and acquaintances, strove to outvie each other in\nthe gross cash-value, if not in the good taste, of their various\ndonations. Had we been a young couple bravely beginning the world on\ntrue love, in more or less uncertainty as to our prospects and future\nincome, we should have received nothing either useful or\nvaluable,--everyone would have tried to do the present-giving in as\ncheap and mean a way as possible. Instead of handsome services of solid\nsilver, we should have had a meagre collection of plated teaspoons;\ninstead of costly editions of books sumptuously enriched with fine steel\nengravings, we might possibly have had to express our gratitude for a\nten-shilling Family Bible. Of course I fully realized the actual nature\nand object of the lavish extravagance displayed on this occasion by our\nsocial 'set,'--their gifts were merely so many bribes, sent with a\npurpose which was easy enough to fathom. The donors wished to be invited\nto the wedding in the first place,--after that, they sought to be\nincluded in our visiting-list, and foresaw invitations to our dinners\nand house-parties;--and more than this they calculated on our influence\nin society, and the possible chance there might be in the dim future of\nour lending some of them money should pressing occasion require it. In\nthe scant thankfulness and suppressed contempt their adulatory offerings\nexcited, Sibyl and I were completely at one. She looked upon her array\nof glittering valuables with the utmost weariness and indifference, and\nflattered my self-love by assuring me that the only things she cared at\nall for were the rivi\u00c3\u00a9re of sapphires and diamonds I had given her as a\nbetrothal-pledge, together with an engagement-ring of the same lustrous\ngems. Yet I noticed she also had a great liking for Lucio's present,\nwhich was a truly magnificent masterpiece of the jeweller's art. It was\na girdle in the form of a serpent, the body entirely composed of the\nfinest emeralds, and the head of rubies and diamonds. Flexible as a\nreed, when Sibyl put it on, it appeared to spring and coil round her\nwaist like a living thing, and breathe with her breathing. I did not\nmuch care for it myself as an ornament for a young bride,--it seemed to\nme quite unsuitable,--but as everyone else admired it and envied the\npossessor of such superb jewels, I said nothing of my own distaste.\nDiana Chesney had shown a certain amount of delicate sentiment and\nrefinement in her offering,--it was a very exquisite marble statue of\nPsyche, mounted on a pedestal of solid silver and ebony. Sibyl thanked\nher, smiling coldly.\n\n\"You have given me an emblem of the Soul,\"--she said; \"No doubt you\nremembered I have no soul of my own!\"\n\nAnd her airy laugh had chilled poor Diana 'to the marrow,' as the\nwarm-hearted little American herself, with tears, assured me.\n\nAt this period I saw very little of Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez. I was much occupied with my\nlawyers on the question of 'settlements.' Messrs Bentham and Ellis\nrather objected to the arrangement by which I gave the half of my\nfortune to my intended wife unconditionally; but I would brook no\ninterference, and the deed was drawn up, signed, sealed and witnessed.\nThe Earl of Elton could not sufficiently praise my 'unexampled\ngenerosity'--my 'noble character;'--and walked about, eulogising me\neverywhere, till he almost turned himself into a public advertisement of\nthe virtues of his future son-in-law. He seemed to have taken a new\nlease of life,--he flirted with Diana Chesney openly,--and of his\nparalysed spouse with the fixed stare and deathly grin, he never spoke,\nand, I imagine, never thought. Sibyl herself was always in the hands of\ndressmakers and milliners,--and we only saw each other every day for a\nfew minutes' hurried chat. On these occasions she was always\ncharming,--even affectionate; and yet,--though I was full of passionate\nadmiration and love for her, I felt that she was mine merely as a slave\nmight be mine; that she gave me her lips to kiss as if she considered I\nhad a right to kiss them because I had bought them, and for no other\nreason,--that her pretty caresses were studied, and her whole behaviour\nthe result of careful forethought and not natural impulsiveness. I tried\nto shake off this impression, but it still remained persistently, and\nclouded the sweetness of my brief courtship.\n\nMeanwhile, slowly and almost imperceptibly, my 'boomed' book dropped out\nof notice. Morgeson presented a heavy bill of publishing costs which I\npaid without a murmur; now and then an allusion to my 'literary\ntriumphs' cropped up in one or other of the newspapers, but otherwise no\none spoke of my 'famous' work, and few read it. I enjoyed the same sort\nof cliquey reputation and public failure attending a certain novel\nentitled 'Marius the Epicurean.' The journalists with whom I had come in\ncontact began to drift away like flotsam and jetsam; I think they saw I\nwas not likely to give many more 'reviewing' dinners or suppers, and\nthat my marriage with the Earl of Elton's daughter would lift me into an\natmosphere where Grub-street could not breathe comfortably or stretch\nits legs at ease. The heap of gold on which I sat as on a throne,\ndivided me gradually from even the back courts and lower passages\nleading to the Temple of Fame,--and almost unconsciously to myself I\nretreated step by step, shading my eyes as it were from the sun, and\nseeing the glittering turrets in the distance, with a woman's slight\nfigure entering the lofty portico, turning back her laurelled head to\nsmile sorrowfully and with divinest pity upon me, ere passing in to\nsalute the gods. Yet, if asked about it, everyone on the press would\nhave said that I had had a great success. I--only I--realized the\nbitterness and truth of my failure. I had not touched the heart of the\npublic;--I had not succeeded in so waking my readers out of the torpor\nof their dull and commonplace every-day lives, that they should turn\ntowards me with outstretched hands, exclaiming--\"More,--more of these\nthoughts which comfort and inspire us!--which make us hear God's voice\nproclaiming 'All's well!' above the storms of life!\" I had not done\nit,--I could not do it. And the worst part of my feeling on this point\nwas the idea that possibly I might have done it had I remained poor! The\nstrongest and healthiest pulse in the composition of a man,--the\nnecessity for hard work,--had been killed in me. I knew I need not work;\nthat the society in which I now moved thought it ridiculous if I did\nwork; that I was expected to spend money and 'enjoy' myself in the\nidiotic fashion of what the 'upper ten' term enjoyment. My acquaintances\nwere not slow in suggesting plans for the dissipation of my surplus\ncash,--why did I not build for myself a marble palace on the\nRiviera?--or a yacht to completely outshine the Prince of Wales's\n'Britannia'? Why did I not start a theatre? Or found a newspaper? Not\none of my social advisers once proposed my doing any private personal\ngood with my fortune. When some terrible case of distress was published,\nand subscriptions were raised to relieve the object or objects of\nsuffering, I invariably gave Ten Guineas, and allowed myself to be\nthanked for my 'generous assistance.' I might as well have given ten\npence, for the guineas were no more to me in comparison than the pence.\nWhen funds were started to erect a statue to some great man who had, in\nthe usual way of the world, been a victim of misrepresentation till his\ndeath, I produced my Ten Guineas again, when I could easily have\ndefrayed the whole cost of the memorial, with honour to myself, and been\nnone the poorer. With all my wealth I did nothing noteworthy; I\nshowered no unexpected luck in the way of the patient, struggling\nworkers in the hard schools of literature and art; I gave no 'largesse'\namong the poor;--and when a thin, eager-eyed curate, with a strong\nearnest face called upon me one day, to represent, with much nervous\ndiffidence, the hideous sufferings of some of the sick and starving in\nhis district down by the docks, and suggested that I might possibly care\nto alleviate a few of these direful sorrows as a satisfaction to myself,\nas well as for the sake of human brotherhood, I am ashamed to say I let\nhim go with a sovereign, for which he heaped coals of fire on my head by\nhis simple 'God bless you, and thank you.' I could see he was himself in\nthe grip of poverty,--I could have made him and his poor district\ngloriously happy by a few strokes of my pen on a cheque for an amount I\nshould never have missed,--and yet--I gave him nothing but that one\npiece of gold, and so allowed him to depart. He invited me, with earnest\ngood-will, to go and see his starving flock,--\"for, believe me Mr\nTempest,\" said he--\"I should be sorry if you thought, as some of the\nwealthy are unhappily apt to do, that I seek money simply to apply it to\nmy own personal uses. If you would visit the district yourself, and\ndistribute whatever you pleased with your own hand, it would be\ninfinitely more gratifying to me, and would have a far better effect on\nthe minds of the people. For, sir, the poor will not always be patient\nunder the cruel burdens they have to bear.\"\n\nI smiled indulgently, and assured him, not without a touch of satire in\nmy tone, that I was convinced all clergymen were honest and\nunselfish,--and then I sent my servant to bow him out with all possible\npoliteness. And that very day I remember, I drank at my luncheon Chateau\nYquem at twenty-five shillings a bottle.\n\nI enter into these apparently trifling details because they all help to\nmake up the sum and substance of the deadly consequences to follow,--and\nalso because I wish to emphasize the fact that in my actions I only\nimitated the example of my compeers. Most rich men to-day follow the\nsame course as I did,--and active personal good to the community is\nwrought by very few of them. No great deed of generosity illumines our\nannals. Royalty itself leads no fashion in this,--the royal gifts of\ngame and cast-off clothing sent to our hospitals are too slight and\nconventional to carry weight. The 'entertainments for the poor' got up\nby some of the aristocrats at the East end, are nothing, and less than\nnothing. They are weak sops to our tame 'lion couchant' offered in\ndoubtful fear and trembling. For our lion is wakeful and somewhat\nrestive,--there is no knowing what may happen if the original ferocity\nof the beast is roused. A few of our over-rich men might considerably\nease the load of cruel poverty in many quarters of the metropolis if\nthey united themselves with a noble unselfishness in the strong and\ndetermined effort to do so, and eschewed red-tapeism and wordy argument.\nBut they remain inert;--spending solely on their own personal\ngratification and amusement,--and meanwhile there are dark signs of\ntrouble brooding. The poor, as the lean and anxious curate said, will\nnot always be patient!\n\nI must not here forget to mention, that through some secret management\nof Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, my name, much to my own surprise, appeared on the list of\ncompetitors for the Derby. How, at so late an hour, this had been\neffected, I knew no more than where my horse 'Phosphor' came from. It\nwas a superb animal, but Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, whose gift to me it was, warned me to\nbe careful as to the character of the persons admitted into the stables\nto view it, and to allow no one but the horse's own two attendants to\nlinger near it long on any pretext. Speculation was very rife as to what\n'Phosphor's' capabilities really were; the grooms never showed him off\nto advantage during exercise. I was amazed when Lucio told me his man\nAmiel would be the jockey.\n\n\"Good heavens!--not possible!\" I exclaimed. \"Can he ride?\"\n\n\"Like the very devil!\"--responded my friend with a smile: \"He will ride\n'Phosphor' to the winning-post.\"\n\nI was very doubtful in my own mind of this; a horse of the Prime\nMinister's was to run, and all the betting was on that side. Few had\nseen 'Phosphor,' and those few, though keen admirers of the animal's\nappearance, had little opportunity of judging its actual qualities,\nthanks to the careful management of its two attendants, who were\ndark-faced, reticent-looking men, somewhat after Amiel's character and\ncomplexion. I myself was quite indifferent as to the result of the\ncontest. I did not really care whether 'Phosphor' lost or won the race.\nI could afford to lose; and it would be little to me if I won, save a\nmomentary passing triumph. There was nothing lasting, intellectual or\nhonourable in the victory,--there _is_ nothing lasting, intellectual or\nhonourable in anything connected with racing. However, because it was\n'fashionable' to be interested in this particular mode of wasting time\nand money, I followed the general 'lead,' for the sake of 'being\ntalked about,' and nothing more. Meanwhile, Lucio, saying little to me\nconcerning it, was busy planning the betrothal-f\u00c3\u00aate at Willowsmere, and\ndesigning all sorts of 'surprise' entertainments for the guests. Eight\nhundred invitations were sent out; and society soon began to chatter\nvolubly and excitedly on the probable magnificence of the forthcoming\nfestival. Eager acceptances poured in; only a few of those asked were\nhindered from attending by illness, family deaths or previous\nengagements, and among these latter, to my regret, was Mavis Clare. She\nwas going to the sea-coast to stay with some old friends, and in a\nprettily-worded letter explained this, and expressed her thanks for my\ninvitation, though she found herself unable to accept it. How curious it\nwas that when I read her little note of refusal I should experience such\na keen sense of disappointment! She was nothing to me,--nothing but a\n'literary' woman who, by strange chance, happened to be sweeter than\nmost women _un_literary; and yet I felt that the f\u00c3\u00aate at Willowsmere\nwould lose something in brightness lacking her presence. I had wanted to\nintroduce her to Sibyl, as I knew I should thus give a special pleasure\nto my betrothed,--however, it was not to be, and I was conscious of an\ninexplicable personal vexation. In strict accordance with the promise\nmade, I let Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez have his own way entirely with regard to all the\narrangements for what was to be the _ne plus ultra_ of everything ever\ndesigned for the distraction, amusement and wonderment of listless and\nfastidious 'swagger' people, and I neither interfered, nor asked any\nquestions, content to rely on my friend's taste, imagination and\ningenuity. I only understood that all the plans were being carried out\nby foreign artists and caterers,--and that no English firms would be\nemployed. I did venture once to inquire the reason of this, and got one\nof Lucio's own enigmatical replies:--\n\n\"Nothing English is good enough for the English,\"--he said--\"Things have\nto be imported from France to please the people whom the French\nthemselves angrily designate as 'perfide Albion.' You must not have a\n'Bill of Fare'; you must have a 'Menu'; and all your dishes must bear\nFrench titles, otherwise they will not be in good form. You must have\nFrench 'comediennes' and 'danseuses' to please the British taste, and\nyour silken draperies must be woven on French looms. Lately too, it has\nbeen deemed necessary to import Parisian morality as well as Parisian\nfashions. It does not suit stalwart Great Britain at all, you\nknow,--stalwart Great Britain, aping the manners of Paris, looks like a\njolly open-faced, sturdy-limbed Giant, with a doll's bonnet stuck on his\nleonine head. But the doll's bonnet is just now _la mode_. Some day I\nbelieve the Giant will discover it looks ridiculous, and cast it off\nwith a burst of genuine laughter at his own temporary folly. And without\nit, he will resume his original dignity;--the dignity that best becomes\na privileged conqueror who has the sea for his standing-army.\"\n\n\"Evidently you like England!\" I said smiling.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Not in the very least! I do not like England any more than any other\ncountry on the globe. I do not like the globe itself; and England comes\nin for a share of my aversion as one of the spots on the trumpery ball.\nIf I could have my way, I should like to throne myself on a convenient\nstar for the purpose and kick out at Earth as she whirls by in space,\nhoping by that act of just violence to do away with her for ever!\"\n\n\"But why?\" I asked, amused--\"Why do you hate the Earth? What has the\npoor little planet done to merit your abhorrence?\"\n\nHe looked at me very strangely.\n\n\"Shall I tell you? You will never believe me!\"\n\n\"No matter for that!\" I answered smiling--\"Say on!\"\n\n\"What has the poor little planet done?\" he repeated slowly--\"The poor\nlittle planet has done--nothing. But it is what the gods have done with\nthis same poor little planet, that awakens my anger and scorn. They have\nmade it a living sphere of wonders,--endowed it with beauty borrowed\nfrom the fairest corners of highest Heaven,--decked it with flowers and\nfoliage,--taught it music,--the music of birds and torrents and rolling\nwaves and falling rains,--rocked it gently in clear ether, among such\nlight as blinds the eyes of mortals,--guided it out of chaos, through\nclouds of thunder and barb\u00c3\u00abd shafts of lightning, to circle peacefully\nin its appointed orbit, lit on the one hand by the vivid splendours of\nthe sun, and on the other by the sleepy radiance of the moon;--and more\nthan all this, they have invested it with a Divine Soul in man! Oh, you\nmay disbelieve as you will,--but notwithstanding the pigmy peeps earth\ntakes at the vast and eternal ocean of Science, the Soul is here, and\nall the immortal forces with it and around it! Nay, the gods--I speak in\nthe plural, after the fashion of the ancient Greeks--for to my thinking\nthere are many gods emanating from the Supreme Deity,--the gods, I say,\nhave so insisted on this fact, that One of them has walked the earth in\nhuman guise, solely for the sake of emphasizing the truth of Immortality\nto these frail creatures of seemingly perishable clay! For this I hate\nthe planet;--were there not, and are there not, other and far grander\nworlds that a God should have chosen to dwell on than this one!\"\n\nFor a moment I was silent, out of sheer surprise.\n\n\"You amaze me!\" I said at last--\"You allude to Christ, I suppose; but\neverybody is convinced by this time that He was a mere man like the rest\nof us; there was nothing divine about Him. What a contradiction you are!\nWhy, I remember you indignantly denied the accusation of being a\nChristian.\"\n\n\"Of course,--and I deny it still\"--he answered quickly--\"I have not a\nfat living in the church that I should tell a lie on such a subject. I\nam not a Christian; nor is anyone living a Christian. To quote a very\nold saying 'There never was a Christian save One, and He was crucified.'\nBut though I am not a Christian I never said I doubted the existence of\nChrist. That knowledge was forced upon me,--with considerable pressure\ntoo!\"\n\n\"By a reliable authority?\" I inquired with a slight sneer.\n\nHe made no immediate reply. His flashing eyes looked, as it were,\nthrough me and beyond me at something far away. The curious pallor that\nat times gave his face the set look of an impenetrable mask, came upon\nhim then, and he smiled,--an awful smile. So might a man smile out of\ndeadly bravado, when told of some dim and dreadful torture awaiting him.\n\n\"You touch me on a sore point,\"--he said at last, slowly, and in a harsh\ntone--\"My convictions respecting certain religious phases of man's\ndevelopment and progress, are founded on the arduous study of some very\nunpleasant truths to which humanity generally shuts its eyes, burying\nits head in the desert-sands of its own delusions. These truths I will\nnot enter upon now. Some other time I will initiate you into a few of my\nmysteries.\"\n\nThe tortured smile passed from his face, leaving it intellectually\ncomposed and calm as usual,--and I hastily changed the subject, for I\nhad made up my mind by this time that my brilliant friend had, like many\nexceptionally gifted persons, a 'craze' on one topic, and that topic a\nparticularly difficult one to discuss as it touched on the superhuman\nand therefore (to my thinking) the impossible. My own temperament, which\nhad, in the days of my poverty, fluctuated between spiritual striving\nand material gain, had, with my sudden access to fortune, rapidly\nhardened into the character of a man of the world worldly, for whom all\nspeculations as to the unseen forces working in and around us, were the\nmerest folly, not worth a moment's waste of thought. I should have\nlaughed to scorn anyone who had then presumed to talk to me about the\nlaw of Eternal Justice, which with individuals as well as nations,\nworks, not for a passing 'phase,' but for all time towards good, and not\nevil,--for no matter how much a man may strive to blind himself to the\nfact, he has a portion of the Divine within him, which if he wilfully\ncorrupts by his own wickedness, he must be forced to cleanse again and\nyet again, in the fierce flames of such remorse and such despair as are\nrightly termed the quenchless fires of Hell!\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nOn the afternoon of the twenty-first of May, I went down, accompanied by\nLucio, to Willowsmere, to be in readiness for the reception of the\nsocial swarm who were to flock thither the next day. Amiel went with\nus,--but I left my own man, Morris, behind, to take charge of my rooms\nin the Grand, and to forward late telegrams and special messages. The\nweather was calm, warm and bright,--and a young moon showed her thin\ncrescent in the sky as we got out at the country station and stepped\ninto the open carriage awaiting us. The station-officials greeted us\nwith servile humility, eyeing Lucio especially with an almost gaping air\nof wonderment; the fact of his lavish expenditure in arranging with the\nrailway company a service of special trains for the use of the morrow's\nguests, had no doubt excited them to a speechless extent of admiration\nas well as astonishment. When we approached Willowsmere, and entered the\nbeautiful drive, bordered with oak and beech, which led up to the house,\nI uttered an exclamation of delight at the festal decorations displayed,\nfor the whole avenue was spanned with arches of flags and flowers,\ngarlands of blossoms being even swung from tree to tree, and interlacing\nmany of the lower branches. The gabled porch at the entrance of the\nhouse was draped with crimson silk and festooned with white roses,--and\nas we alighted, the door was flung open by a smart page in brilliant\nscarlet and gold.\n\n\"I think,\" said Lucio to me as we entered--\"You will find everything as\ncomplete as this world's resources will allow. The retinue of servants\nhere are what is vulgarly called 'on the job'; their payment is agreed\nupon, and they know their duties thoroughly,--they will give you no\ntrouble.\"\n\nI could scarcely find words to express my unbounded satisfaction, or to\nthank him for the admirable taste with which the beautiful house had\nbeen adorned. I wandered about in an ecstasy of admiration, triumphing\nin such a visible and gorgeous display of what great wealth could really\ndo. The ball-room had been transformed into an elegant bijou theatre,\nthe stage being concealed by a curtain of thick gold-coloured silk on\nwhich the oft-quoted lines of Shakespeare were embroidered in raised\nletters,--\n\n      \"All the world's a stage,\n  And all the men and women merely players.\"\n\nTurning out of this into the drawing-room, I found it decorated entirely\nround with banks of roses, red and white, the flowers forming a huge\npyramid at one end of the apartment, behind which, as Lucio informed me,\nunseen musicians would discourse sweet harmony.\n\n\"I have arranged for a few 'tableaux vivants' in the theatre to fill up\na gap of time;\"--he said carelessly--\"Fashionable folks now-a-days get\nso soon tired of one amusement that it is necessary to provide several\nin order to distract the brains that cannot think, or discover any means\nof entertainment in themselves. As a matter of fact, people cannot even\nconverse long together because they have nothing to say. Oh, don't\nbother to go out in the grounds on a tour of inspection just now,--leave\na few surprises for yourself as well as for your company to-morrow. Come\nand have dinner!\"\n\nHe put his arm through mine and we entered the dining-room. Here the\ntable was laid out with costly fruit, flowers and delicacies of every\ndescription,--four men-servants in scarlet and gold stood silently in\nwaiting, with Amiel, in black as usual, behind his master's chair. We\nenjoyed a sumptuous repast served to perfection, and when it was\nfinished, we strolled out in the grounds to smoke and talk.\n\n\"You seem to do everything by magic, Lucio;\"--I said, looking at him\nwonderingly--\"All these lavish decorations,--these servants--\"\n\n\"Money, my dear fellow,--nothing but money\"--he interrupted with a\nlaugh--\"Money, the devil's pass-key! you can have the retinue of a king\nwithout any of a king's responsibilities, if you only choose to pay for\nit. It is merely a question of cost.\"\n\n\"And taste!\" I reminded him.\n\n\"True,--and taste. Some rich men there are who have less taste than a\ncostermonger. I know one who has the egregious vulgarity to call the\nattention of his guests to the value of his goods and chattels. He\npointed out for my admiration one day, an antique and hideous china\nplate, the only one of that kind in the world, and told me it was worth\na thousand guineas. 'Break it,'--I said coolly--'You will then have the\nsatisfaction of knowing you have destroyed a thousand guineas' worth of\nundesirable ugliness.' You should have seen his face! He showed me no\nmore _curios_!\"\n\nI laughed, and we walked slowly up and down for a few minutes in\nsilence. Presently I became aware that my companion was looking at me\nintently, and I turned my head quickly to meet his eyes. He smiled.\n\n\"I was just then thinking,\" he said, \"what you would have done with your\nlife if you had not inherited this fortune, and if,--if _I_ had not come\nyour way?\"\n\n\"I should have starved, no doubt,\"--I responded--\"Died like a rat in a\nhole,--of want and wretchedness.\"\n\n\"I rather doubt that;\" he said meditatively--\"It is just possible you\nmight have become a great writer.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because I have been reading your book. There are fine ideas in\nit,--ideas that might, had they been the result of sincere conviction,\nhave reached the public in time, because they were sane and healthy. The\npublic will never put up for long with corrupt 'fads' and artificial\n'crazes.' Now you write of God,--yet according to your own statement,\nyou did not believe in God even when you wrote the words that imply His\nexistence,--and that was long before I met you. Therefore the book was\nnot the result of sincere conviction, and that's the key-note of your\nfailure to reach the large audience you desired. Each reader can see you\ndo not believe what you write,--the trumpet of lasting fame never sounds\ntriumph for an author of that calibre.\"\n\n\"Don't let us talk about it for Heaven's sake!\" I said irritably--\"I\nknow my work lacks something,--and that something may be what you say or\nit may not,--I do not want to think about it. Let it perish, as it\nassuredly will; perhaps in the future I may do better.\"\n\nHe was silent,--and finishing his cigar, threw the end away in the grass\nwhere it burned like a dull red coal.\n\n\"I must turn in,\" he then observed,--\"I have a few more directions to\ngive to the servants for to-morrow. I shall go to my room as soon as I\nhave done,--so I'll say good-night.\"\n\n\"But surely you are taking too much personal trouble,\"--I said--\"Can't I\nhelp in any way?\"\n\n\"No, you can't,\"--he answered smiling. \"When I undertake to do anything\nI like to do it in my own fashion, or not at all. Sleep well, and rise\nearly.\"\n\nHe nodded, and sauntered slowly away over the dewy grass. I watched his\ndark tall figure receding till he had entered the house; then, lighting\na fresh cigar, I wandered on alone through the grounds, noting here and\nthere flowery arbours and dainty silk pavilions erected in picturesque\nnooks and corners for the morrow. I looked up at the sky; it was clear\nand bright,--there would be no rain. Presently I opened the wicket-gate\nthat led into the outer by-road, and walking on slowly, almost\nunconsciously, I found myself in a few minutes opposite 'Lily Cottage.'\nApproaching the gate I looked in,--the pretty old house was dark, silent\nand deserted. I knew Mavis Clare was away,--and it was not strange that\nthe aspect of her home-nest emphasized the fact of her absence. A\ncluster of climbing roses hanging from the wall, looked as if they were\nlistening for the first sound of her returning footsteps; across the\ngreen breadth of the lawn where I had seen her playing with her dogs, a\ntall sheaf of St John's lilies stood up white against the sky, their\npure hearts opened to the star-light and the breeze. The scent of\nhoney-suckle and sweet-briar filled the air with delicate\nsuggestions,--and as I leaned over the low fence, gazing vaguely at the\nlong shadows of the trees on the grass, a nightingale began to sing. The\nsweet yet dolorous warble of the 'little brown lover of the moon,'\npalpitated on the silence in silver-toned drops of melody; and I\nlistened, till my eyes smarted with a sudden moisture as of tears.\nStrangely enough, I never thought of my betrothed bride Sibyl then, as\nsurely, by all the precedents of passion, I should have done at such a\nmoment of dreamful ecstasy. It was another woman's face that floated\nbefore my memory;--a face not beautiful,--but merely sweet,--and made\nradiant by the light of two tender, wistful, wonderfully innocent\neyes,--a face like that of some new Daphne with the mystic laurel\nspringing from her brows. The nightingale sang on and on,--the tall\nlilies swayed in the faint wind as though nodding wise approval of the\nbird's wild music,--and, gathering one briar-rose from the hedge, I\nturned away with a curious heaviness at my heart,--a trouble I could not\nanalyse or account for. I explained my feeling partly to myself as one\nof regret that I had ever taken up my pen to assault, with sneer and\nflippant jest, the gentle and brilliantly endowed owner of this little\nhome where peace and pure content dwelt happily in student-like\nseclusion;--but this was not all. There was something else in my\nmind,--something inexplicable and sad,--which then I had no skill to\ndefine. I know now what it was,--but the knowledge comes too late!\n\nReturning to my own domains, I saw through the trees a vivid red light\nin one of the upper windows of Willowsmere. It twinkled like a lurid\nstar, and I guided my steps by its brilliancy as I made my way across\nthe winding garden-paths and terraces back to the house. Entering the\nhall, the page in scarlet and gold met me, and with a respectful\nobeisance, escorted me to my room where Amiel was in waiting.\n\n\"Has the prince retired?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"He has a red lamp in his window has he not?\"\n\nAmiel looked deferentially meditative. Yet I fancied I saw him smile.\n\n\"I think----yes,--I believe he has, sir.\"\n\nI asked no more questions, but allowed him to perform his duties as\nvalet in silence.\n\n\"Good-night sir!\" he said at last, his ferret eyes fastened upon me with\nan expressionless look.\n\n\"Good-night!\" I responded indifferently.\n\nHe left the room with his usual cat-like stealthy tread, and when he had\ngone, I,--moved by a sudden fresh impulse of hatred for him,--sprang to\nthe door and locked it. Then I listened, with an odd nervous\nbreathlessness. There was not a sound. For fully quarter of an hour I\nremained with my attention more or less strained, expectant of I knew\nnot what; but the quiet of the house was absolutely undisturbed. With a\nsigh of relief I flung myself on the luxurious bed,--a couch fit for a\nking, draped with the richest satin elaborately embroidered,--and\nfalling soundly asleep I dreamed that I was poor again. Poor,--but\nunspeakably happy,--and hard at work in the old lodging, writing down\nthoughts which I knew, by some divine intuition and beyond all doubt,\nwould bring me the whole world's honour. Again I heard the sounds of the\nviolin played by my unseen neighbour next door, and this time they were\ntriumphal chords and cadences of joy, without one throb of sorrow. And\nwhile I wrote on in an ecstasy of inspiration, oblivious of poverty and\npain, I heard, echoing through my visions, the round warble of the\nnightingale, and saw, in the far distance, an angel floating towards me\non pinions of light, with the face of Mavis Clare.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nThe morning broke clear, with all the pure tints of a fine opal\nradiating in the cloudless sky. Never had I beheld such a fair scene as\nthe woods and gardens of Willowsmere when I looked upon them that day\nillumined by the unclouded sunlight of a spring half-melting into\nsummer. My heart swelled with pride as I surveyed the beautiful domain I\nnow owned,--and thought how happy a home it would make when Sibyl,\nmatchless in her loveliness, shared with me its charm and luxury.\n\n\"Yes,\"--I said half-aloud--\"Say what philosophers will, the possession\nof money does insure satisfaction and power. It is all very well to\ntalk about fame, but what is fame worth, if, like Carlyle, one is\ntoo poor to enjoy it! Besides, literature no longer holds its former\nhigh prestige,--there are too many in the field,--too many\nnewspaper-scribblers, all believing they are geniuses,--too many\nill-educated lady-paragraphists and 'new' women, who think they are as\ngifted as Georges Sand or Mavis Clare. With Sibyl and Willowsmere, I\nought to be able to resign the idea of fame--literary fame--with a good\ngrace.\"\n\nI knew I reasoned falsely with myself,--I knew that my hankering for a\nplace among the truly great of the world, was as strong as ever,--I knew\nI craved for the intellectual distinction, force, and pride which make\nthe Thinker a terror and a power in the land, and which so sever a great\npoet or great romancist from the commoner throng that even kings are\nglad to do him or her honour,--but I would not allow my thoughts to\ndwell on this rapidly vanishing point of unattainable desire. I settled\nmy mind to enjoy the luscious flavour of the immediate present, as a bee\nsettles in the cup of honey-flowers,--and, leaving my bedroom, I went\ndownstairs to breakfast with Lucio in the best and gayest of humours.\n\n\"Not a cloud on the day!\" he said, meeting me with a smile, as I entered\nthe bright morning-room, whose windows opened on the lawn--\"The f\u00c3\u00aate\nwill be a brilliant success, Geoffrey.\"\n\n\"Thanks to you!\" I answered--\"Personally I am quite in the dark as to\nyour plans,--but I believe you can do nothing that is not well done.\"\n\n\"You honour me!\" he said with a light laugh--\"You credit me then with\nbetter qualities than the Creator! For what He does, in the opinion of\nthe present generation, is exceedingly ill done! Men have taken to\ngrumbling at Him instead of praising Him,--and few have any patience\nwith or liking for His laws.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, you must admit those laws are very arbitrary!\"\n\n\"They are. I entirely acknowledge the fact!\"\n\nWe sat down to table, and were waited upon by admirably-trained servants\nwho apparently had no idea of anything else but attendance on our needs.\nThere was no trace of bustle or excitement in the household,--no sign\nwhatever to denote that a great entertainment was about to take place\nthat day. It was not until the close of our meal that I asked Lucio what\ntime the musicians would arrive. He glanced at his watch.\n\n\"About noon I should say,\"--he replied--\"Perhaps before. But whatever\ntheir hour, they will all be in their places at the proper moment,\ndepend upon it. The people I employ--both musicians and 'artistes'--know\ntheir business thoroughly, and are aware that I stand no nonsense.\" A\nrather sinister smile played round his mouth as he regarded me. \"None of\nyour guests can arrive here till one o'clock,--as that is about the\ntime the special train will bring the first batch of them from\nLondon,--and the first 'd\u00c3\u00a9jeuner' will be served in the gardens at two.\nIf you want to amuse yourself there's a Maypole being put up on the\nlarge lawn,--you'd better go and look at it.\"\n\n\"A Maypole!\" I exclaimed--\"Now that's a good idea!\"\n\n\"It used to be a good idea,\"--he answered--\"When English lads and lasses\nhad youth, innocence, health and fun in their composition, a dance round\nthe Maypole hand in hand, did them good and did nobody harm. But now\nthere are no lads and lasses,--enervated old men and women in their\nteens walk the world wearily, speculating on the uses of life,--probing\nvice, and sneering down sentiment, and such innocent diversions as the\nMaypole no longer appeal to our jaded youth. So we have to get\n'professionals' to execute the May-revels,--of course the dancing is\nbetter done by properly trained legs; but it means nothing, and _is_\nnothing, except a pretty spectacle.\"\n\n\"And are the dancers here?\" I asked, rising and going towards the window\nin some curiosity.\n\n\"No, not yet. But the May-pole is;--fully decorated. It faces the woods\nat the back of the house,--go and see if you like it.\"\n\nI followed his suggestion, and going in the direction indicated, I soon\nperceived the gaily-decked object which used to be the welcome signal of\nmany a village holiday in Shakespeare's old-world England. The pole was\nalready set up and fixed in a deep socket in the ground, and a dozen or\nmore men were at work, unbinding its numerous trails of blossom and\ngarlands of green, tied with long streamers of vari-coloured ribbon. It\nhad a picturesque effect in the centre of the wide lawn bordered with\ngrand old trees,--and approaching one of the men, I said something to\nhim by way of approval and admiration. He glanced at me furtively and\nunsmilingly, but said nothing,--and I concluded from his dark and\nforeign cast of features, that he did not understand the English\nlanguage. I noted, with some wonder and slight vexation that all the\nworkmen were of this same alien and sinister type of countenance, very\nmuch after the unattractive models of Amiel and the two grooms who had\nmy racer 'Phosphor' in charge. But I remembered what Lucio had told\nme,--namely, that all the designs for the f\u00c3\u00aate were carried out by\nforeign experts and artists,--and after some puzzled consideration, I\nlet the matter pass from my mind.\n\nThe morning hours flew swiftly by, and I had little time to examine all\nthe festal preparations with which the gardens abounded,--so that I was\nalmost as ignorant of what was in store for the amusement of my guests\nas the guests themselves. I had the curiosity to wait about and watch\nfor the coming of the musicians and dancers, but I might as well have\nspared myself this waste of time and trouble, for I never saw them\narrive at all. At one o'clock, both Lucio and I were ready to receive\nour company,--and at about twenty minutes past the hour, the first\ninstalment of 'swagger society' was emptied into the grounds. Sibyl and\nher father were among these,--and I eagerly advanced to meet and greet\nmy bride-elect as she alighted from the carriage that had brought her\nfrom the station. She looked supremely beautiful that day, and was, as\nshe deserved to be, the cynosure of all eyes. I kissed her little gloved\nhand with a deeper reverence than I would have kissed the hand of a\nqueen.\n\n\"Welcome back to your old home, my Sibyl!\" I said to her in a low voice\ntenderly, at which words she paused, looking up at the red gables of the\nhouse with such wistful affection as filled her eyes with something like\ntears. She left her hand in mine, and allowed me to lead her towards the\nsilken-draped, flower-decked porch, where Lucio waited, smiling,--and as\nshe advanced, two tiny pages in pure white and silver glided suddenly\nout of some unseen hiding-place, and emptied two baskets of pink and\nwhite rose-leaves at her feet, thus strewing a fragrant pathway for her\ninto the house. They vanished as completely and swiftly as they had\nappeared,--some of the guests uttered murmurs of admiration, while\nSibyl gazed about her, blushing with surprise and pleasure.\n\n\"How charming of you, Geoffrey!\" she said, \"What a poet you are to\ndevise so pretty a greeting!\"\n\n\"I wish I deserved your praise!\" I answered, smiling at her--\"But the\npoet in question is Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,--he is the master and ruler of\nto-day's revels.\"\n\nAgain the rich colour flushed her cheeks, and she gave Lucio her hand.\nHe bowed over it in courtly fashion,--but did not kiss it as he had\nkissed the hand of Mavis Clare. We passed into the house, through the\ndrawing-room, and out again into the gardens, Lord Elton being loud in\nhis praise of the artistic manner in which his former dwelling had been\nimproved and embellished. Soon the lawn was sprinkled with gaily attired\ngroups of people,--and my duties as host began in hard earnest. I had to\nbe greeted, complimented, flattered, and congratulated on my approaching\nmarriage by scores of hypocrites who nearly shook my hand off in their\nenthusiasm for my wealth. Had I become suddenly poor, I thought grimly,\nnot one of them would have lent me a sovereign! The guests kept on\narriving in shoals, and when there were about three or four hundred\nassembled, a burst of exquisite music sounded, and a procession of pages\nin scarlet and gold, marching two by two appeared, carrying trays full\nof the rarest flowers tied up in bouquets, which they offered to\nall the ladies present. Exclamations of delight arose on every\nside,--exclamations which were for the most part high-pitched and\nnoisy,--for the 'swagger set' have long ceased to cultivate softness of\nvoice or refinement of accent,--and once or twice the detestable slang\nword, 'ripping' escaped from the lips of a few dashing dames, reputed to\nbe 'leaders' of style. Repose of manner, dignity and elegance of\ndeportment, however, are no longer to be discovered among the present\n'racing' duchesses and gambling countesses of the bluest blue blood of\nEngland, so one does not expect these graces of distinction from them.\nThe louder they can talk, and the more slang they can adopt from the\nlanguage of their grooms and stable-boys, the more are they judged to be\n'in the swim' and 'up to date.' I speak, of course, of the modern scions\nof aristocracy. There are a few truly 'great ladies' left, whose maxim\nis still '_noblesse oblige_,'--but they are quite in the minority and by\nthe younger generation are voted either 'old cats' or 'bores.' Many of\nthe 'cultured' mob that now swarmed over my grounds had come out of the\nsheerest vulgar curiosity to see what 'the man with five millions' could\ndo in the way of entertaining,--others were anxious to get news, if\npossible, of the chances of 'Phosphor' winning the Derby, concerning\nwhich I was discreetly silent. But the bulk of the crowd wandered\naimlessly about, staring impertinently or enviously at each other, and\nscarcely looking at the natural loveliness of the gardens or the\nwoodland scenery around them. The brainlessness of modern society is\nnever so flagrantly manifested as at a garden-party, where the restless\ntrousered and petticoated bipeds move vaguely to and fro, scarcely\nstopping to talk civilly or intelligently to one another for five\nminutes, most of them hovering dubiously and awkwardly between the\nrefreshment-pavilion and the band-stand. In my domain they were deprived\nof this latter harbour of refuge, for no musicians could be seen, though\nmusic was heard,--beautiful wild music which came first from one part of\nthe grounds and then from another, and to which few listened with any\nattention. All were, however, happily unanimous in their enthusiastic\nappreciation of the excellence of the food provided for them in the\nluxurious luncheon tents of which there were twenty in number. Men ate\nas if they had never eaten in their lives before, and drank the choice\nand exquisite wines with equal greed and gusto. One never entirely\nrealises the extent to which human gourmandism can go till one knows a\nfew peers, bishops and cabinet-ministers, and watches those dignitaries\nfeed _ad libitum_. Soon the company was so complete that there was no\nlonger any need for me to perform the fatiguing duty of 'receiving'; and\nI therefore took Sibyl in to luncheon, determining to devote myself to\nher for the rest of the day. She was in one of her brightest and most\ncaptivating moods,--her laughter rang out as sweetly joyous as that of\nsome happy child,--she was even kind to Diana Chesney, who was also one\nof my guests, and who was plainly enjoying herself with all the _verve_\npeculiar to pretty American women, who consider flirtation as much of a\ngame as tennis. The scene was now one of great brilliancy, the light\ncostumes of the women contrasting well with the scarlet and gold\nliveries of the seemingly innumerable servants that were now everywhere\nin active attendance. And, constantly through the fluttering festive\ncrowd, from tent to tent, from table to table, and group to group, Lucio\nmoved,--his tall stately figure and handsome face always conspicuous\nwherever he stood, his rich voice thrilling the air whenever he spoke.\nHis influence was irresistible, and gradually dominated the whole\nassemblage,--he roused the dull, inspired the witty, encouraged the\ntimid, and brought all the conflicting elements of rival position,\ncharacter and opinion into one uniform whole, which was unconsciously\nled by his will as easily as a multitude is led by a convincing orator.\nI did not know it then, but I know now, that metaphorically speaking, he\nhad his foot on the neck of that 'society' mob, as though it were one\nprostrate man;--that the sycophants, liars and hypocrites whose utmost\nidea of good is wealth and luxurious living, bent to his secret power as\nreeds bend to the wind,--and that he did with them all whatsoever he\nchose,--as he does to this very day! God!--if the grinning, guzzling\nsensual fools had only known what horrors were about them at the\nfeast!--what ghastly ministers to pleasurable appetite waited obediently\nupon them!--what pallid terrors lurked behind the gorgeous show of\nvanity and pride! But the veil was mercifully down,--and only to me has\nit since been lifted!\n\nLuncheon over, the singing of mirthful voices, tuned to a kind of\nvillage roundelay, attracted the company, now fed to repletion, towards\nthe lawn at the back of the house, and cries of delight were raised as\nthe Maypole came into view, I myself joining in the universal applause,\nfor I had not expected to see anything half so picturesque and pretty.\nThe pole was surrounded by a double ring of small children,--children so\nbeautiful in face and dainty in form, that they might very well have\nbeen taken for little fairies from some enchanted woodland. The boys\nwere clad as tiny foresters, in doublets of green, with pink caps on\ntheir curly locks,--the girls were in white, with their hair flowing\nloosely over their shoulders, and wreaths of May-blossom crowning their\nbrows. As soon as the guests appeared on the scene, these exquisite\nlittle creatures commenced their dance, each one taking a trail of\nblossom or a ribbon pendant from the May-pole, and weaving it with the\nothers into no end of beautiful and fantastic designs. I looked on, as\namazed and fascinated as anyone present, at the wonderful lightness and\nease with which these children tripped and ran;--their tiny twinkling\nfeet seemed scarcely to touch the turf,--their faces were so\nlovely,--their eyes so bright, that it was a positive enchantment to\nwatch them. Each figure they executed was more intricate and effective\nthan the last, and the plaudits of the spectators grew more and more\nenthusiastic, till presently came the _finale_, in which all the little\ngreen foresters climbed up the pole and clung there, pelting the\nwhite-robed maidens below with cowslip-balls, knots of roses, bunches of\nviolets, posies of buttercups, daisies and clover, which the\ngirl-children in their turn laughingly threw among the admiring guests.\nThe air grew thick with flowers, and heavy with perfume, and resounded\nwith song and laughter;--and Sibyl, standing at my side, clapped her\nhands in an ecstasy.\n\n\"Oh, it is lovely--lovely!\" she cried--\"Is this the prince's idea?\" Then\nas I answered in the affirmative, she added, \"Where, I wonder, did he\nfind such exquisitely pretty little children!\"\n\nAs she spoke, Lucio himself advanced a step or two in front of the other\nspectators and made a slight peremptory sign. The fairy-like foresters\nand maidens, with extraordinary activity, all sprang away from the\nMay-pole, pulling down the garlands with them, and winding the flowers\nand ribbons about themselves so that they looked as if they were all\ntied together in one inextricable knot,--this done, they started off at\na rapid run, presenting the appearance of a rolling ball of blossom,\nmerry pipe-music accompanying their footsteps, till they had entirely\ndisappeared among the trees.\n\n\"Oh do call them back again!\" entreated Sibyl, laying her hand coaxingly\non Lucio's arm,--\"I should so like to speak to two or three of the\nprettiest!\"\n\nHe looked down at her with an enigmatical smile.\n\n\"You would do them too much honour, Lady Sibyl,\" he replied--\"They are\nnot accustomed to such condescension from great ladies and would not\nappreciate it. They are paid professionals, and, like many of their\nclass, only become insolent when praised.\"\n\nAt that moment Diana Chesney came running across the lawn, breathless.\n\n\"I can't see them anywhere!\" she declared pantingly--\"The dear little\ndarlings! I ran after them as fast as I could; I wanted to kiss one of\nthose perfectly scrumptious boys, but they're gone!--not a trace of them\nleft! It's just as if they had sunk into the ground!\"\n\nAgain Lucio smiled.\n\n\"They have their orders,--\" he said curtly--\"And they know their place.\"\n\nJust then, the sun was obscured by a passing black cloud, and a peal of\nthunder rumbled over-head. Looks were turned to the sky, but it was\nquite bright and placid save for that one floating shadow of storm.\n\n\"Only summer thunder,\"--said one of the guests--\"There will be no rain.\"\n\nAnd the crowd that had been pressed together to watch the 'Maypole\ndance' began to break up in groups, and speculate as to what diversion\nmight next be provided for them. I, watching my opportunity, drew Sibyl\naway.\n\n\"Come down by the river;\"--I whispered--\"I must have you to myself for a\nfew minutes.\" She yielded to my suggestion, and we walked away from the\nmob of our acquaintance, and entered a grove of trees leading to the\nbanks of that part of the Avon which flowed through my grounds. Here we\nfound ourselves quite alone, and putting my arm round my betrothed, I\nkissed her tenderly.\n\n\"Tell me,\" I said with a half-smile--\"Do you know how to love yet?\"\n\nShe looked up with a passionate darkness in her eyes that startled me.\n\n\"Yes,--I know!\" was her unexpected answer.\n\n\"You do!\" and I stopped to gaze intently into her fair face--\"And how\ndid you learn?\"\n\nShe flushed red,--then grew pale,--and clung to me with a nervous,\nalmost feverish force.\n\n\"Very strangely!\" she replied--\"And--quite suddenly! The lesson was\neasy, I found;--too easy! Geoffrey,\"--she paused, and fixed her eyes\nfull on mine--\"I will tell you how I learnt it, ... but not now, ...\nsome other day.\" Here she broke off, and began to laugh rather forcedly.\n\"I will tell you ... when we are married.\" She glanced anxiously about\nher,--then, with a sudden abandonment of her usual reserve and pride,\nthrew herself into my arms and kissed my lips with such ardour as made\nmy senses reel.\n\n\"Sibyl--Sibyl!\" I murmured, holding her close to my heart----\"Oh my\ndarling,--you love me!--at last you love me!\"\n\n\"Hush!--hush!\" she said breathlessly--\"You must forget that kiss,----it\nwas too bold of me--it was wrong--I did not mean it, ... I, ... I was\nthinking of something else. Geoffrey!\"--and her small hand clenched on\nmine with a sort of eager fierceness--\"I wish I had never learned to\nlove; I was happier before I knew!\"\n\nA frown knitted her brows.\n\n\"Now\"--she went on in the same breathless hurried way--\"I _want_ love!\nI am starving, thirsting for it! I want to be drowned in it, lost in it,\nkilled by it! Nothing else will content me!\"\n\nI folded her still closer in my arms.\n\n\"Did I not say you would change, Sibyl?\" I whispered--\"Your coldness and\ninsensibility to love was unnatural and could not last,--my darling, I\nalways knew that!\"\n\n\"You always knew!\" she echoed a little disdainfully--\"Ah, but you do not\nknow even now what has chanced to me. Nor shall I tell you--yet. Oh\nGeoffrey!--\" Here she drew herself out of my embrace, and stooping,\ngathered some bluebells in the grass--\"See these little flowers growing\nso purely and peacefully in the shade by the Avon!--they remind me of\nwhat I was, here in this very place, long ago. I was quite as happy, and\nI think as innocent as these blossoms; I had no thought of evil in my\nnature,--and the only love I dreamed of was the love of the fairy prince\nfor the fairy princess,--as harmless an idea as the loves of the flowers\nthemselves. Yes!--I was then all I should like to be now,--all that I am\nnot!\"\n\n\"You are everything that is beautiful and sweet!\"--I told her,\nadmiringly, as I watched the play of retrospective and tender expression\non her perfect face.\n\n\"So you judge,--being a man who is perfectly satisfied with his own\nchoice of a wife!\" she said with a flash of her old cynicism--\"But I\nknow myself better than you know me. You call me beautiful and\nsweet,--but you cannot call me good! I am not good. Why, the very love\nthat now consumes me is----\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked her quickly, seizing her hands with the blue-bells in\nthem, and gazing searchingly into her eyes--\"I know before you speak,\nthat it is the passion and tenderness of a true woman!\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment. Then she smiled, with a bewitching languor.\n\n\"If you know, then I need not tell you\"--she said--\"So, do not let us\nstay here any longer talking nonsense;--'society' will shake its head\nover us and accuse us of 'bad form,' and some lady-paragraphist will\nwrite to the papers, and, say--'Mr Tempest's conduct as a host left much\nto be desired, as he and his bride-elect were \"spooning\" all the day.'\"\n\n\"There are no lady-paragraphists here,\"--I said laughing, and encircling\nher dainty waist with one arm as I walked.\n\n\"Oh, are there not, though!\" she exclaimed, laughing also, \"Why, you\ndon't suppose you can give any sort of big entertainment without them do\nyou? They permeate society. Old Lady Maravale, for example, who is\nrather reduced in circumstances, writes a guinea's worth of scandal a\nweek for one of the papers. And _she_ is here,--I saw her simply gorging\nherself with chicken salad and truffles an hour ago!\" Here pausing, and\nresting against my arm, she peered through the trees. \"There are the\nchimneys of Lily Cottage where the famous Mavis Clare lives,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\"--I replied readily--\"Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez and I have visited her. She\nis away just now, or she would have been here to-day.\"\n\n\"Do you like her?\" Sibyl queried.\n\n\"Very much. She is charming.\"\n\n\"And ... the prince ... does he like her?\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word,\" I answered with a smile--\"I think he likes her\nmore than he does most women! He showed the most extraordinary deference\ntowards her, and seemed almost abashed in her presence. Are you cold,\nSibyl?\" I added hastily, for she shivered suddenly and her face grew\npale--\"You had better come away from the river,--it is damp under these\ntrees.\"\n\n\"Yes,--let us go back to the gardens and the sunshine;\"--she answered\ndreamily--\"So your eccentric friend,--the woman-hater,--finds something\nto admire in Mavis Clare! She must be a very happy creature I\nthink,--perfectly free, famous, and believing in all good things of life\nand humanity, if one may judge from her books.\"\n\n\"Well, taken altogether, life isn't so very bad!\" I observed playfully.\n\nShe made no reply,--and we returned to the lawns where afternoon tea was\nnow being served to the guests, who were seated in brilliant scattered\ngroups under the trees or within the silken pavilions, while the\nsweetest music,--and the strangest, if people had only had ears to hear\nit,--both vocal and instrumental, was being performed by those invisible\nplayers and singers whose secret whereabouts was unknown to all, save\nLucio.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nJust as the sun began to sink, several little pages came out of the\nhouse, and with low salutations, distributed among the guests daintily\nembossed and painted programmes of the 'Tableaux Vivants,' prepared for\ntheir diversion in the extemporized bijou theatre. Numbers of people\nrose at once from their chairs on the lawn, eager for this new\nspectacle, and began to scramble along and hustle one another in that\neffective style of 'high-breeding' so frequently exhibited at Her\nMajesty's Drawing-Rooms. I, with Sibyl, hastily preceded the impatient,\npushing crowd, for I wished to find a good seat for my beautiful\nbetrothed before the room became full to over-flowing. There proved\nhowever, to be plenty of accommodation for everybody,--what space there\nwas seemed capable of limitless expansion, and all the spectators were\ncomfortably placed without difficulty. Soon we were all studying our\nprogrammes with considerable interest, for the titles of the 'Tableaux'\nwere somewhat original and mystifying. They were eight in number, and\nwere respectively headed--'Society,'--'Bravery: Ancient and Modern,'--'A\nLost Angel,'--'The Autocrat,'--'A Corner of Hell,'--'Seeds of\nCorruption,'--'His Latest Purchase,'--and 'Faith and Materialism.' It\nwas in the theatre that everyone became at last conscious of the weirdly\nbeautiful character of the music that had been surging round them all\nday. Seated under one roof in more or less enforced silence and\nattention, the vague and frivolous throng grew hushed and passive,--the\n'society' smirk passed off certain faces that were as trained to grin as\ntheir tongues were trained to lie,--the dreadful giggle of the unwedded\nman-hunter was no longer heard,--and soon the most exaggerated\nfashion-plate of a woman forgot to rustle her gown. The passionate\nvibrations of a violoncello, superbly played to a double harp\naccompaniment, throbbed on the stillness with a beseeching depth of\nsound,--and people listened, I saw, almost breathlessly, entranced, as\nit were, against their wills, and staring as though they were\nhypnotized, in front of them at the gold curtain with its familiar\nmotto--\n\n \"All the world's a stage\n  And all the men and women merely players.\"\n\nBefore we had time to applaud the violoncello solo however, the music\nchanged,--and the mirthful voices of violins and flutes rang out in a\nwaltz of the giddiest and sweetest tune. At the same instant a silvery\nbell tinkled, and the curtain parted noiselessly in twain, disclosing\nthe first tableau--\"Society.\" An exquisite female figure, arrayed in\nevening-dress of the richest and most extravagant design, stood before\nus, her hair crowned with diamonds, and her bosom blazing with the same\nlustrous gems. Her head was slightly raised,--her lips were parted in a\nlanguid smile,--in one hand she held up-lifted a glass of foaming\nchampagne,--her gold-slippered foot trod on an hour-glass. Behind her,\ncatching convulsively at the folds of her train, crouched another woman\nin rags, pinched and wretched, with starvation depicted in her face,--a\ndead child lay near. And, overshadowing this group, were two\nSupernatural shapes,--one in scarlet, the other in black,--vast and\nalmost beyond the stature of humanity,--the scarlet figure represented\nAnarchy, and its blood-red fingers were advanced to clutch the diamond\ncrown from 'Society's' brow,--the sable-robed form was Death, and even\nas we looked, it slowly raised its steely dart in act to strike! The\neffect was weird and wonderful,--and the grim lesson the picture\nconveyed, was startling enough to make a very visible impression. No\none spoke,--no one applauded,--but people moved restlessly and fidgetted\non their seats,--and there was an audible sigh of relief as the curtain\nclosed. Opening again, it displayed the second tableau--'Bravery--Ancient\nand Modern.' This was in two scenes;--the first one depicted a nobleman\nof Elizabeth's time, with rapier drawn, his foot on the prostrate body\nof a coarse ruffian who had evidently, from the grouping, insulted a\nwoman whose slight figure was discerned shrinking timidly away from the\ncontest. This was 'Ancient Bravery,'--and it changed rapidly to 'Modern,'\nshowing us an enervated, narrow-shouldered, pallid dandy in opera-coat\nand hat, smoking a cigarette and languidly appealing to a bulky\npoliceman to protect him from another young noodle of his own class,\nsimilarly attired, who was represented as sneaking round a corner in\nabject terror. We all recognised the force of the application, and were\nin a much better humour with this pictured satire than we had been at\nthe lesson of 'Society.' Next followed 'A Lost Angel,' in which was\nshown a great hall in the palace of a king, where there were numbers of\nbrilliantly attired people, all grouped in various attitudes, and\nevidently completely absorbed in their own concerns, so much so as to\nbe entirely unconscious of the fact that in their very midst, stood a\nwondrous Angel, clad in dazzling white, with a halo round her fair hair,\nand a glory, as of the sunset, on her half drooping wings. Her eyes were\nwistful,--her face was pensive and expectant; she seemed to say, \"Will\nthe world ever know that I am here?\" Somehow,--as the curtain slowly\nclosed again, amid loud applause, for the picture was extraordinarily\nbeautiful, I thought of Mavis Clare, and sighed. Sibyl looked up at me.\n\n\"Why do you sigh?\" she said--\"It is a lovely fancy,--but the symbol is\nwasted in the present audience,--no one with education believes in\nangels now-a-days.\"\n\n\"True!\" I assented; yet there was a heaviness at my heart, for her words\nreminded me of what I would rather have forgotten,--namely her own\nadmitted lack of all religious faith. 'The Autocrat,' was the next\ntableau, and represented an Emperor enthroned. At his footstool knelt a\npiteous crowd of the starving and oppressed, holding up their lean hands\nto him, clasped in anguished petition, but he looked away from them as\nthough he saw them not. His head was turned to listen to the\nside-whisper of one who seemed, by the courtly bend and flattering\nsmile, to be his adviser and confidant,--yet that very confidant held\nsecreted behind his back, a drawn dagger, ready to strike his sovereign\nto the heart. \"Russia!\" whispered one or two of the company, as the\nscene was obscured; but the scarcely-breathed suggestion quickly passed\ninto a murmur of amazement and awe as the curtain parted again to\ndisclose \"A Corner of Hell.\" This tableau was indeed original, and quite\nunlike what might have been imagined as the conventional treatment of\nsuch a subject. What we saw was a black and hollow cavern, glittering\nalternately with the flashings of ice and fire,--huge icicles drooped\nfrom above, and pale flames leaped stealthily into view from below, and\nwithin the dark embrasure, the shadowy form of a man was seated,\ncounting out gold, or what seemed to be gold. Yet as coin after coin\nslipped through his ghostly fingers, each one was seen to change to\nfire,--and the lesson thus pictured was easily read. The lost soul had\nmade its own torture, and was still at work intensifying and increasing\nits own fiery agony. Much as this scene was admired for its Rembrandt\neffect of light and shade, I, personally, was glad when it was curtained\nfrom view; there was something in the dreadful face of the doomed sinner\nthat reminded me forcibly and unpleasantly of those ghastly Three I had\nseen in my horrid vision on the night of Viscount Lynton's suicide.\n'Seeds of Corruption' was the next picture, and showed us a young and\nbeautiful girl in her early teens, lying on a luxurious couch _en\ndeshabille_, with a novel in her hand, of which the title was plainly\nseen by all;--a novel well-known to everyone present, and the work of a\nmuch-praised living author. Round her, on the floor, and cast carelessly\non a chair at her side, were other novels of the same 'sexual'\ntype,--all their titles turned towards us, and the names of their\nauthors equally made manifest.\n\n\"What a daring idea!\" said a lady in the seat immediately behind me--\"I\nwonder if any of those authors are present!\"\n\n\"If they are they won't mind!\" replied the man next to her with a\nsmothered laugh--\"Those sort of writers would merely take it as a\nfirst-class advertisement!\"\n\nSibyl looked at the tableau with a pale face and wistful eyes.\n\n\"That is a _true_ picture!\" she said under her breath--\"Geoffrey, it is\npainfully true!\"\n\nI made no answer,--I thought I knew to what she alluded; but alas!--I\ndid not know how deeply the 'seeds of corruption' had been sown in her\nown nature, or what a harvest they would bring forth. The curtain\nclosed,--to open again almost immediately on \"His Latest Purchase.\" Here\nwe were shown the interior of a luxurious modern drawing-room, where\nabout eight or ten men were assembled, in fashionable evening-dress.\nThey had evidently just risen from a card-table,--and one of them, a\ndissipated looking brute, with a wicked smile of mingled satire and\ntriumph on his face was pointing to his 'purchase,'--a beautiful woman.\nShe was clad in glistening white like a bride,--but she was bound, as\nprisoners are bound, to an upright column, on which the grinning head of\na marble Silenus leered above her. Her hands were tied tightly\ntogether,--with chains of diamonds; her waist was bound,--with thick\nropes of pearls;--a wide collar of rubies encircled her throat;--and\nfrom bosom to feet she was netted about and tied,--with strings of gold\nand gems. Her head was flung back defiantly with an assumption of pride\nand scorn,--her eyes alone expressed shame, self-contempt, and despair\nat her bondage. The man who owned this white slave was represented, by\nhis attitude, as cataloguing and appraising her 'points' for the\napproval and applause of his comrades, whose faces variously and\npowerfully expressed the differing emotions of lust, cruelty, envy,\ncallousness, derision, and selfishness, more admirably than the most\ngifted painter could imagine.\n\n\"A capital type of most fashionable marriages!\" I heard some-one say.\n\n\"Rather!\" another voice replied--\"The orthodox 'happy couple' to the\nlife!\"\n\nI glanced at Sibyl. She looked pale,--but smiled as she met my\nquestioning eyes. A sense of consolation crept warmly about my heart as\nI remembered that now, she had, as she told me 'learnt to love,'--and\nthat therefore her marriage with me was no longer a question of material\nadvantage alone. She was not my 'purchase,'--she was my love, my saint,\nmy queen!--or so I chose to think, in my foolishness and vanity!\n\nThe last tableau of all was now to come,--\"Faith and Materialism,\" and\nit proved to be the most startling of the series. The auditorium was\ngradually darkened,--and the dividing curtain disclosed a ravishingly\nbeautiful scene by the sea-shore. A full moon cast its tranquil glory\nover the smooth waters, and,--rising on rainbow-wings from earth towards\nthe skies, one of the loveliest creatures ever dreamed of by poet or\npainter, floated angel-like upwards, her hands holding a cluster of\nlilies clasped to her breast,--her lustrous eyes full of divine joy,\nhope, and love. Exquisite music was heard,--soft voices sang in the\ndistance a chorale of rejoicing;--heaven and earth, sea and air,--all\nseemed to support the aspiring Spirit as she soared higher and higher,\nin ever-deepening rapture, when,--as we all watched that aerial flying\nform with a sense of the keenest delight and satisfaction,--a sudden\ncrash of thunder sounded,--the scene grew dark,--and there was a distant\nroaring of angry waters. The light of the moon was eclipsed,--the music\nceased; a faint lurid glow of red shone at first dimly, then more\nvividly,--and 'Materialism' declared itself,--a human skeleton, bleached\nwhite and grinning ghastly mirth upon us all! While we yet looked, the\nskeleton itself dropped to pieces,--and one long twining worm lifted its\nslimy length from the wreck of bones, another working its way through\nthe eye-holes of the skull. Murmurs of genuine horror were heard in the\nauditorium,--people on all sides rose from their seats--one man in\nparticular, a distinguished professor of sciences, pushed past me to get\nout, muttering crossly--\"This may be very amusing to some of you, but to\nme, it is disgusting!\"\n\n\"Like your own theories, my dear Professor!\" said a rich laughing voice,\nas Lucio met him on his way, and the bijou theatre was again flooded\nwith cheerful light--\"They are amusing to some, and disgusting to\nothers!----Pardon me!--I speak of course in jest! But I designed that\ntableau specially in your honour!\"\n\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\" growled the Professor--\"Well, I didn't\nappreciate it.\"\n\n\"Yet you should have done, for it is quite scientifically\ncorrect,\"--declared Lucio laughing still. \"Faith,--with the wings, whom\nyou saw joyously flying towards an impossible Heaven, is _not_\nscientifically correct,--have you not told us so?--but the skeleton and\nthe worms were quite of your _cult_! No materialist can deny the\ncorrectness of that 'complexion to which we all must come at last.'\nPositively, some of the ladies look quite pale! How droll it is, that\nwhile everybody (to be fashionable, and in favour with the press) must\naccept Materialism as the only creed, they should invariably become\naffrighted, or let us say offended, at the natural end of the body, as\ncompleted by material agencies!\"\n\n\"Well, it was not a pleasant subject, that last tableau,\"--said Lord\nElton, as he came out of the theatre with Diana Chesney hanging\nconfidingly on his arm--\"You cannot say it was festal!\"\n\n\"It was,--for the worms!\" replied Lucio gaily--\"Come, Miss Chesney,--and\nyou Tempest, come along with Lady Sibyl,--let us go out in the grounds\nagain, and see my will-o'-the-wisps lighting up.\"\n\nFresh curiosity was excited by this remark; the people quickly threw off\nthe gruesome and tragic impression made by the strange 'tableaux' just\nwitnessed,--and poured out of the house into the gardens chattering and\nlaughing more noisily than ever. It was just dusk,--and as we reached\nthe open lawn we saw an extraordinary number of small boys, clad in\nbrown, running about with will-o'-the-wisp lanterns. Their movements\nwere swift and perfectly noiseless,--they leaped, jumped and twirled\nlike little gnomes over flowerbeds, under shrubberies, and along the\nedges of paths and terraces, many of them climbing trees with the\nrapidity and agility of monkeys, and wherever they went they left behind\nthem a trail of brilliant light. Soon, by their efforts, all the grounds\nwere illuminated with a magnificence that could not have been equalled\neven by the historic f\u00c3\u00aates at Versailles,--tall oaks and cedars were\ntransformed to pyramids of fire-blossoms,--every branch was loaded with\ncoloured lamps in the shape of stars,--rockets hissed up into the clear\nspace showering down bouquets, wreaths and ribbons of flame,--lines of\nred and azure ran glowingly along the grass-borders, and amid the\nenthusiastic applause of the assembled spectators, eight huge\nfire-fountains of all colours sprang up in various corners of the\ngarden, while an enormous golden balloon, dazzlingly luminous, ascended\nslowly into the air and remained poised above us, sending from its\nglittering car hundreds of gem-like birds and butterflies on fiery\nwings, that circled round and round for a moment and then vanished.\nWhile we were yet loudly clapping the splendid effect of this\nsky-spectacle, a troop of beautiful girl-dancers in white came running\nacross the grass, waving long silvery wands that were tipped with\nelectric stars, and to the sound of strange tinkling music, seemingly\nplayed in the distance on glass bells, they commenced a fantastic dance\nof the wildest yet most graceful character. Every shade of opaline\ncolour fell upon their swaying figures from some invisible agency as\nthey tripped and whirled,--and each time they waved their wands, ribbons\nand flags of fire were unrolled and tossed high in air where they\ngyrated for a long time like moving hieroglyphs. The scene was now so\nstartling, so fairy-like and wonderful, that we were well-nigh struck\nspeechless with astonishment,--too fascinated and absorbed even to\napplaud, we had no conception how time went, or how rapidly the night\ndescended,--till all at once without the least warning, an appalling\ncrash of thunder burst immediately above our heads, and a jagged fork of\nlightning tore the luminous fire-balloon to shreds. Two or three women\nbegan to scream,--whereupon Lucio advanced from the throng of spectators\nand stood in full view of all, holding up his hand.\n\n\"Stage thunder, I assure you!\" he said playfully, in a clear somewhat\nscornful voice--\"It comes and goes at my bidding. Quite a part of the\ngame, believe me!--these sort of things are only toys for children.\nAgain--again, ye petty elements!\" he cried, laughing, and lifting his\nhandsome face and flashing eyes to the dark heavens--\"Roar your best and\nloudest!--roar, I say!\"\n\nSuch a terrific boom and clatter answered him as baffled all\ndescription,--it was as if a mountain of rock had fallen into\nruins,--but having been assured that the deafening noise was 'stage\nthunder' merely, the spectators were no longer alarmed, and many of them\nexpressed their opinion that it was 'wonderfully well done.' After this,\nthere gradually appeared against the sky a broad blaze of red light like\nthe reflection of some great prairie fire,--it streamed apparently\nupward from the ground, bathing us all where we stood, in its blood-like\nglow. The white-robed dancing-girls waltzed on and on, their arms\nentwined, their lovely faces irradiated by the lurid flame, while above\nthem now flew creatures with black wings, bats and owls, and great\nnight-moths, that flapped and fluttered about for all the world as if\nthey were truly alive and not mere 'stage properties.' Another flash of\nlightning,--and one more booming thud of thunder,----and lo!--the\nundisturbed and fragrant night was about us, clear, dewy and calm,--the\nyoung moon smiled pensively in a cloudless heaven,--all the\ndancing-girls had vanished,--the crimson glow had changed to a pure\nsilvery radiance, and an array of pretty pages in eighteenth century\ncostumes of pale pink and blue, stood before us with lighted flaming\ntorches, making a long triumphal avenue, down which Lucio invited us to\npass.\n\n\"On, on fair ladies and gallant gentlemen!\" he cried--\"This\nextemporized path of light leads,--not to Heaven--no! that were far too\ndull an ending!--but to supper! On!--follow your leader!\"\n\nEvery eye was turned on his fine figure and striking countenance, as\nwith one hand he beckoned the guests,--between the double line of lit\ntorches he stood,--a picture for a painter, with those dark eyes of his\nalit with such strange mirth as could not be defined, and the sweet,\nhalf-cruel, wonderfully attractive smile playing upon his lips;--and\nwith one accord the whole company trooped pell-mell after him, shouting\ntheir applause and delight. Who could resist him!--not one in that\nassemblage at least;--there are few 'saints' in society! As I went with\nthe rest, I felt as though I were in some gorgeous dream,--my senses\nwere all in a whirl,--I was giddy with excitement and could not stop to\nthink, or to analyse the emotions by which I was governed. Had I\npossessed the force or the will to pause and consider, I might possibly\nhave come to the conclusion that there was something altogether beyond\nthe ordinary power of man displayed in the successive wonders of this\nbrilliant 'gala,'--but I was, like all the rest of society, bent merely\non the pleasure of the moment, regardless of how it was procured, what\nit cost me, or how it affected others. How many I see and know to-day\namong the worshippers of fashion and frivolity who are acting precisely\nas I acted then! Indifferent to the welfare of everyone save themselves,\ngrudging every penny that is not spent on their own advantage or\namusement, and too callous to even listen to the sorrows or difficulties\nor joys of others when these do not in some way, near or remote, touch\ntheir own interests, they waste their time day after day in selfish\ntrifling, wilfully blind and unconscious to the fact that they are\nbuilding up their own fate in the future,--that future which will prove\nall the more a terrible Reality in proportion to the extent of our\npresumption in daring to doubt its truth.\n\nMore than four hundred guests sat down to supper in the largest\npavilion,--a supper served in the most costly manner and furnished with\nluxuries that represented the utmost pitch of extravagance. I ate and\ndrank, with Sybil at my side, hardly knowing what I said or did in the\nwhirling excitement of the hour,--the opening of champagne-bottles, the\nclink of glasses, the clatter of plates, the loud hum of talk\ninterspersed with monkey-like squeals or goat-like whinnies of laughter,\nover-ridden at intervals by the blare of trumpet-music and drums,--all\nthese sounds were as so much noise of rushing waters in my ears,--and I\noften found myself growing abstracted and in a manner confused by the\ndin. I did not say much to Sibyl,--one cannot very well whisper\nsentimental nothings in the ear of one's betrothed when she is eating\nortolans and truffles. Presently, amid all the hubbub, a deep bell\nstruck twelve times, and Lucio stood up at the end of one of the long\ntables, a full glass of foaming champagne in his hand--\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\"\n\nThere was a sudden silence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" he repeated, his brilliant eyes flashing\nderisively, I thought, over the whole well-fed company, \"Midnight has\nstruck and the best of friends must part! But before we do so, let us\nnot forget that we have met here to wish all happiness to our host, Mr\nGeoffrey Tempest and his bride-elect, the Lady Sibyl Elton.\" Here there\nwas vociferous applause. \"It is said\"--continued Lucio, \"by the makers\nof dull maxims, that 'Fortune never comes with both hands full'--but in\nthis case the adage is proved false and put to shame,--for our friend\nhas not only secured the pleasures of wealth, but the treasures of love\nand beauty combined. Limitless cash is good, but limitless love is\nbetter, and both these choice gifts have been bestowed on the betrothed\npair whom to-day we honour. I will ask you to give them a hearty round\nof cheering,--and then it must be good-night indeed, though not\nfarewell,--for with the toast of the bride and bridegroom-elect, I shall\nalso drink to the time,--not far distant perhaps,--when I shall see some\nof you, if not all of you again, and enjoy even more of your charming\ncompany than I have done to-day!\"\n\nHe ceased amid a perfect hurricane of applause,--and then everyone rose\nand turned towards the table where I sat with Sibyl, and naming our\nnames aloud, drank wine, the men joining in hearty shouts of \"Hip, hip,\nhip hurrah!\" Yet,--as I bowed repeatedly in response to the storm of\ncheering, and while Sibyl smiled and bent her graceful head to right and\nleft, my heart sank suddenly with a sense of fear. Was it my fancy--or\ndid I hear peals of wild laughter circling round the brilliant pavilion\nand echoing away, far away into distance? I listened, glass in hand.\n\"Hip, hip, hip hurrah!\" shouted my guests with gusto. \"Ha--ha--!\nha--ha!\" seemed shrieked and yelled in my ears from the outer air.\nStruggling against this delusion, I got up and returned thanks for\nmyself and my future bride in a few brief words which were received with\nfresh salvos of applause,--and then we all became aware that Lucio had\nsprung up again in his place, and was standing high above us all, with\none foot on the table and the other on the chair, confronting us with a\nfresh glass of wine in his hand, filled to the brim. What a face he had\nat that moment!--what a smile!\n\n\"The parting cup, my friends!\" he exclaimed--\"To our next merry\nmeeting!\"\n\nWith plaudits and laughter the guests eagerly and noisily\nresponded,--and as they drank, the pavilion was flooded by a deep\ncrimson illumination as of fire. Every face looked blood-red!--every\njewel on every woman flashed like a living flame!--for one brief instant\nonly,--then it was gone, and there followed a general stampede of the\ncompany,--everybody hurrying as fast as they could into the carriages\nthat waited in long lines to take them to the station, the last two\n'special' trains to London being at one a.m. and one thirty. I bade\nSibyl and her father a hurried good-night,--Diana Chesney went in the\nsame carriage with them, full of ecstatic thanks and praise to me for\nthe splendours of the day which she described in her own fashion as\n\"knowing how to do it,--\" and then the departing crowd of vehicles began\nto thunder down the avenue. As they went an arch of light suddenly\nspanned Willowsmere Court from end to end of its red gables, blazing\nwith all the colours of the rainbow, in the middle of which appeared\nletters of pale blue and gold, forming what I had hitherto considered as\na funereal device,\n\n             \"Sic transit gloria mundi! Vale!\"\n\nBut, after all, it was as fairly applicable to the ephemeral splendours\nof a f\u00c3\u00aate as it was to the more lasting marble solemnity of a sepulchre,\nand I thought little or nothing about it. So perfect were all the\narrangements, and so admirably were the servants trained, that the\nguests were not long in departing,--and the grounds were soon not only\nempty, but dark. Not a vestige of the splendid illuminations was left\nanywhere,--and I entered the house fatigued, and with a dull sense of\nbewilderment and fear on me which I could not explain. I found Lucio\nalone in the smoking-room at the further end of the oak-panelled hall, a\nsmall cosily curtained apartment with a deep bay window which opened\ndirectly on to the lawn. He was standing in this embrasure with his back\nto me, but he turned swiftly round as he heard my steps and confronted\nme with such a wild, white, tortured face that I recoiled from him,\nstartled.\n\n\"Lucio, you are ill!\" I exclaimed--\"you have done too much to-day.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have!\" he answered in a hoarse unsteady voice, and I saw a\nstrong shudder convulse him as he spoke,--then, gathering himself\ntogether as it were by an effort, he forced a smile--\"Don't be alarmed,\nmy friend!--it is nothing,--nothing but the twinge of an old deep-seated\nmalady,--a troublesome disease that is rare among men, and hopelessly\nincurable.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked anxiously, for his death-like pallor alarmed me.\nHe looked at me fixedly, his eyes dilating and darkening, and his hand\nfell with a heavy pressure on my shoulder.\n\n\"A very strange illness!\" he said, in the same jarring accents.\n\"Remorse! Have you never heard of it, Geoffrey? Neither medicine nor\nsurgery are of any avail,--it is 'the worm that dieth not, and the flame\nthat cannot be quenched.' Tut!--let us not talk of it,--no one can cure\nme,--no one will! I am past hope!\"\n\n\"But remorse,--if you have it, and I cannot possibly imagine why, for\nyou have surely nothing to regret,--is not a physical ailment!\" I said\nwonderingly.\n\n\"And physical ailments are the only ones worth troubling about, you\nthink?\" he queried, still smiling that strained and haggard smile--\"The\nbody is our chief care,--we cosset it, and make much of it, feed it and\npamper it, and guard it from so much as a pin-prick of pain if we\ncan,--and thus we flatter ourselves that all is well,--all _must_ be\nwell! Yet it is but a clay chrysalis, bound to split and crumble with\nthe growth of the moth-soul within,--the moth that flies with blind\ninstinctiveness straight into the Unknown, and is dazzled by excess of\nlight! Look out here,\"--he went on with an abrupt and softer change of\ntone--\"Look out at the dreamful shadowy beauty of your gardens now! The\nflowers are asleep,--the trees are surely glad to be disburdened of all\nthe gaudy artificial lamps that lately hung upon their branches,--there\nis the young moon pillowing her chin on the edge of a little cloud and\nsinking to sleep in the west,--a moment ago there was a late nightingale\nawake and singing. You can feel the breath of the roses from the trellis\nyonder! All this is Nature's work,--and how much fairer and sweeter it\nis now than when the lights were ablaze and the blare of band-music\nstartled the small birds in their downy nests!--Yet 'society' would not\nappreciate this cool dusk, this happy solitude;--'society' prefers a\nfalse glare to all true radiance. And what is worse it tries to make\ntrue things take a second place as adjuncts to sham ones,--and there\ncomes in the mischief.\"\n\n\"It is just like you to run down your own indefatigable labours in the\nsplendid successes of the day,\"--I said laughing--\"You may call it a\n'false glare' if you like, but it has been a most magnificent\nspectacle,--and certainly in the way of entertainments it will never be\nequalled or excelled.\"\n\n\"It will make you more talked about than even your 'boomed' book could\ndo!\" said Lucio, eyeing me narrowly.\n\n\"Not the least doubt of that!\" I replied--\"Society prefers food and\namusement to any literature,--even the greatest. By-the-by, where are\nall the 'artistes,'--the musicians and dancers?\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\n\"Gone!\" I echoed amazedly--\"Already! Good heavens! have they had\nsupper?\"\n\n\"They have had everything they want, even to their pay,\" said Lucio, a\ntrifle impatiently--\"Did I not tell you Geoffrey, that when I undertake\nto do anything, I do it thoroughly or not at all?\"\n\nI looked at him,--he smiled, but his eyes were sombre and scornful.\n\n\"All right!\" I responded carelessly, not wishing to offend him,--\"Have\nit your own way! But, upon my word, to me it is all like devil's magic!\"\n\n\"What is?\" he asked imperturbably.\n\n\"Everything!--the dancers,--the number of servants and pages--why, there\nmust have been two or three hundred of them,--those wonderful\n'tableaux,'--the illuminations,--the supper,--everything I tell\nyou!--and the most astonishing part of it now is, that all these people\nshould have cleared out so soon!\"\n\n\"Well, if you elect to call money devil's magic, you are right,\"--said\nLucio.\n\n\"But surely in some cases, not even money could procure such perfection\nof detail\"----I began.\n\n\"Money can procure anything!\"--he interrupted, a thrill of passion\nvibrating in his rich voice,--\"I told you that long ago. It is a hook\nfor the devil himself. Not that the devil could be supposed to care\nabout world's cash personally,--but he generally conceives a liking for\nthe company of the man who possesses it;--possibly he knows what that\nman will do with it. I speak metaphorically of course,--but no metaphor\ncan exaggerate the power of money. Trust no man or woman's virtue till\nyou have tried to purchase it with a round sum in hard cash! Money, my\nexcellent Geoffrey, has done everything for _you_,--remember that!--you\nhave done nothing for yourself.\"\n\n\"That's not a very kind speech,\"--I said, somewhat vexedly.\n\n\"No? And why? Because it's true? I notice most people complain of\n'unkindness' when they are told a truth. It _is_ true, and I see no\nunkindness in it. You've done nothing for yourself and you're not\nexpected to do anything--except,\" and he laughed--\"except just now to\nget to bed, and dream of the enchanting Sibyl!\"\n\n\"I confess I am tired,\"--I said, and an unconscious sigh escaped\nme--\"And you?\"\n\nHis gaze rested broodingly on the outer landscape.\n\n\"I also am tired,\" he responded slowly--\"But I never get away from my\nfatigue, for I am tired of myself. And I always rest badly. Good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night!\" I answered,--and then paused, looking at him. He returned\nmy look with interest.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked expressively.\n\nI forced a smile.\n\n\"Well!\" I echoed--\"I do not know what I should say,--except--that I wish\nI knew you as you are. I feel that you were right in telling me once\nthat you are not what you seem.\"\n\nHe still kept his eyes fixed upon me.\n\n\"As you have expressed the wish,\"--he said slowly--\"I promise you you\n_shall_ know me as I am some-day! It may be well for you to know,--for\nthe sake of others who may seek to cultivate my company.\"\n\nI moved away to leave the room.\n\n\"Thanks for all the trouble you have taken to-day,\"--I said in a lighter\ntone--\"Though I shall never be able to express my full gratitude in\nwords.\"\n\n\"If you wanted to thank anybody, thank God that you have lived through\nit!\" he replied.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, astonished.\n\n\"Why? Because life hangs on a thread,--a society crush is the very acme\nof boredom and exhaustion,--and that we escape with our lives from a\ngeneral guzzle and giggle is matter for thanksgiving,--that's all! And\nGod gets so few thanks as a rule that you may surely spare Him a brief\none for to-day's satisfactory ending.\"\n\nI laughed, seeing no meaning in his words beyond the usual satire he\naffected. I found Amiel, waiting for me in my bedroom, but I dismissed\nhim abruptly, hating the look of his crafty and sullen face, and saying\nI needed no attendance. Thoroughly fatigued, I was soon in bed and\nasleep,--and the terrific agencies that had produced the splendours of\nthe brilliant festival at which I had figured as host, were not revealed\nto me by so much as a warning dream!\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nA few days after the entertainment at Willowsmere, and before the\nsociety papers had done talking about the magnificence and luxury\ndisplayed on that occasion, I woke up one morning, like the great poet\nByron, \"to find myself famous.\" Not for any intellectual\nachievement,--not for any unexpected deed of heroism,--not for any\nresolved or noble attitude in society or politics,--no!--I owed my fame\nmerely to a quadruped;--'Phosphor' won the Derby. It was about a\nneck-and-neck contest between my racer and that of the Prime Minister,\nand for a second or so the result seemed doubtful,--but, as the two\njockeys neared the goal, Amiel, whose thin wiry figure clad in the\nbrightest of bright scarlet silk, stuck to his horse as though he were a\npart of it, put 'Phosphor' to a pace he had never yet exhibited,\nappearing to skim along the ground at literally flying speed, the upshot\nbeing that he scored a triumphant victory, reaching the winning-post a\ncouple of yards or more ahead of his rival. Acclamations rent the air at\nthe vigour displayed in the 'finish'--and I became the hero of the\nday,--the darling of the populace. I was somewhat amused at the\nPremier's discomfiture,--he took his beating rather badly. He did not\nknow me, nor I him,--I was not of his politics, and I did not care a jot\nfor his feelings one way or the other, but I was gratified, in a certain\nsatirical sense, to find myself suddenly acknowledged as a greater man\nthan he, because I was the owner of the Derby-winner! Before I well knew\nwhere I was, I found myself being presented to the Prince of Wales, who\nshook hands with me and congratulated me;--all the biggest aristocrats\nin England were willing and eager to be introduced to me;--and inwardly\nI laughed at this exhibition of taste and culture on the part of 'the\ngentlemen of England that live at home at ease.' They crowded round\n'Phosphor,' whose wild eye warned strangers against taking liberties\nwith him, but who seemed not a whit the worse for his exertions, and who\napparently was quite ready to run the race over again with equal\npleasure and success. Amiel's dark sly face and cruel ferret eyes were\nevidently not attractive to the majority of the gentlemen of the turf,\nthough his answers to all the queries put to him, were admirably ready,\nrespectful and not without wit. But to me the whole sum and substance of\nthe occasion was the fact that I, Geoffrey Tempest, once struggling\nauthor, now millionaire, was simply by virtue of my ownership of the\nDerby-winner, 'famous' at last!--or what society considers famous,--that\nfame that secures for a man the attention of 'the nobility and gentry,'\nto quote from tradesmen's advertisements,--and also obtains the\npersistent adulation and shameless pursuit of all the _demi-mondaines_\nwho want jewels and horses and yachts presented to them in exchange for\na few tainted kisses from their carmined lips. Under the shower of\ncompliments I received, I stood, apparently delighted,--smiling, affable\nand courteous,--entering into the spirit of the occasion, and shaking\nhands with my Lord That, and Sir Something Nobody, and His Serene\nHighness the Grand Duke So-and-So of Beer-Land, and His other Serene\nLowness of Small-Principality,--but in my secret soul I scorned these\npeople with their social humbug and hypocrisy,--scorned them with such a\ndeadly scorn as almost amazed myself. When presently I walked off the\ncourse with Lucio, who as usual seemed to know and to be friends with\neverybody, he spoke in accents that were far more grave and gentle than\nI had ever heard him use before.\n\n\"With all your egotism, Geoffrey, there is something forcible and noble\nin your nature,--something which rises up in bold revolt against\nfalsehood and sham. Why, in Heaven's name do you not give it way?\"\n\nI looked at him amazed, and laughed.\n\n\"Give it way? What do you mean? Would you have me tell humbugs that I\nknow them as such?,--and liars that I discern their lies? My dear\nfellow, society would become too hot to hold me!\"\n\n\"It could not be hotter--or colder--than hell, if you believed in hell,\nwhich you do not,\"--he rejoined, in the same quiet voice--\"But I did not\nassume that you should say these things straight out and bluntly, to\ngive offence. An affronting candour is not nobleness,--it is merely\ncoarse. To act nobly is better than to speak.\"\n\n\"And what would you have me do?\" I asked curiously.\n\nHe was silent for a moment, and seemed to be earnestly, almost painfully\nconsidering,--then he answered,--\n\n\"My advice will seem to you singular, Geoffrey,--but if you want it,\nhere it is. Give, as I said, the noble, and what the world would call\nthe quixotic part of your nature full way,--do not sacrifice your higher\nsense of what is right and just for the sake of pandering to anyone's\npower or influence,--and--say farewell to _me_! I am no use to you, save\nto humour your varying fancies, and introduce you to those great,--or\nsmall,--personages you wish to know for your own convenience or\nadvantage,--believe me, it would be much better for you and much more\nconsoling at the inevitable hour of death, if you were to let all this\nfalse and frivolous nonsense go, and me with it! Leave society to its\nown fool's whirligig of distracted follies,--put Royalty in its true\nplace, and show it that all its pomp, arrogance and glitter are\nworthless, and itself a nothing, compared to the upright standing of a\nbrave soul in an honest man,--and, as Christ said to the rich\nruler--'Sell half that thou hast and give to the poor.'\"\n\nI was silent for a minute or so out of sheer surprise, while he watched\nme earnestly, his face pale and expectant. A curious shock of something\nlike compunction startled my conscience, and for a brief space I was\nmoved to a vague regret,--regret that with all the enormous capability I\npossessed of doing good to numbers of my fellow-creatures with the vast\nwealth I owned, I had not attained to any higher moral attitude than\nthat represented by the frivolous folk who make up what is called the\n'Upper Ten' of society. I took the same egotistical pleasure in myself\nand my own doings as any of them,--and I was to the full as foolishly\nconventional, smooth-tongued and hypocritical as they. They acted their\npart and I acted mine,--none of us were ever our real selves for a\nmoment. In very truth, one of the reasons why 'fashionable' men and\nwomen cannot bear to be alone is, that a solitude in which they are\ncompelled to look face to face upon their secret selves becomes\nunbearable because of the burden they carry of concealed vice and\naccusing shame. My emotion soon passed however, and slipping my arm\nthrough Lucio's, I smiled, as I answered--\n\n\"Your advice, my dear fellow, would do credit to a Salvationist\npreacher,--but it is quite valueless to me, because impossible to\nfollow. To say farewell for ever to you, in the first place, would be to\nmake myself guilty of the blackest ingratitude,--in the second instance,\nsociety, with all its ridiculous humbug, is nevertheless necessary for\nthe amusement of myself and my future wife,--Royalty moreover, is\naccustomed to be flattered, and we shall not be hurt by joining in the\ngeneral inane chorus;--thirdly, if I did as the visionary Jew\nsuggested----\"\n\n\"What visionary Jew?\" he asked, his eyes sparkling coldly.\n\n\"Why, Christ of course!\" I rejoined lightly.\n\nThe shadow of a strange smile parted his lips.\n\n\"It is the fashion to blaspheme!\" he said,--\"A mark of brilliancy in\nliterature, and wit in society! I forgot! Pray go on,--if you did as\nChrist suggested----\"\n\n\"Yes,--if I gave half my goods to the poor, I should not be thanked for\nit, or considered anything but a fool for my pains.\"\n\n\"You would wish to be thanked?\" he said.\n\n\"Naturally! Most people like a little gratitude in return for benefits.\"\n\n\"They do. And the Creator, who is always giving, is supposed to like\ngratitude also,\"--he observed--\"Nevertheless He seldom gets it!\"\n\n\"I do not talk of hyperphysical nothingness,\"--I said with\nimpatience--\"I am speaking of the plain facts of this world and the\npeople who live in it. If one gives largely, one expects to be\nacknowledged as generous,--but if I were to divide my fortune, and hand\nhalf of it to the poor, the matter would be chronicled in about six\nlines in one of the papers, and society would exclaim 'What a fool!'\"\n\n\"Then let us talk no more about it,\"--said Lucio, his brows clearing,\nand his eyes gathering again their wonted light of mockery and\nmirth--\"Having won the Derby, you have really done all a\nnineteenth-century civilization expects you to do, and for your reward,\nyou will be in universal demand everywhere. You may hope soon to dine at\nMarlborough House,--and a little back-stair influence and political\njobbery will work you into the Cabinet if you care for it. Did I not\ntell you I would set you up as successfully as the bear who has reached\nthe bun on the top of the slippery pole, a spectacle for the envy of men\nand the wonder of angels? Well, there you are!--triumphant!--a great\ncreature Geoffrey!--in fact, you are the greatest product of the age, a\nman with five millions and owner of the Derby-winner! What is the glory\nof intellect compared to such a position as yours! Men envy you,--and as\nfor angels,--if there are any,--you may be sure they _do_ wonder! A\nman's fame guaranteed by a horse, is something indeed to make an angel\nstare!\"\n\nHe laughed uproariously, and from that day he never spoke again of his\nsingular proposition that I should 'part with him,' and let the \"nobler\"\nnature in me have its way. I was not to know then that he had staked a\nchance upon my soul and lost it,--and that from henceforward he took a\ndetermined course with me, implacably on to the appalling end.\n\nMy marriage took place on the appointed day in June with all the pomp\nand extravagant show befitting my position, and that of the woman I had\nchosen to wed. It is needless to describe the gorgeousness of the\nceremony in detail,--any fashionable 'ladies paper' describing the\nwedding of an Earl's daughter to a five-fold millionaire, will give an\nidea, in hysterical rhapsody, of the general effect. It was an amazing\nscene,--and one in which costly millinery completely vanquished all\nconsiderations of solemnity or sacredness in the supposed 'divine'\nordinance. The impressive command: \"I require and charge ye both, as ye\nwill answer at the dreadful day of judgment,\"--did not obtain half so\nmuch awed attention as the exquisite knots of pearls and diamonds which\nfastened the bride's silver-embroidered train to her shoulders. 'All the\nworld and his wife' were present,--that is, the social world, which\nimagines no other world exists, though it is the least part of the\ncommunity. The Prince of Wales honoured us by his presence: two great\ndignitaries of the church performed the marriage-rite, resplendent in\nredundant fulness of white sleeve and surplice, and equally imposing in\nthe fatness of their bodies and unctuous redness of their faces; and\nLucio was my 'best man.' He was in high, almost wild spirits,--and,\nduring our drive to the church together, had entertained me all the way\nwith numerous droll stories, mostly at the expense of the clergy. When\nwe reached the sacred edifice, he said laughingly as he alighted--\n\n\"Did you ever hear it reported, Geoffrey, that the devil is unable to\nenter a church, because of the cross upon it, or within it?\"\n\n\"I have heard some such nonsense,\"--I replied, smiling at the humour\nexpressed in his sparkling eyes and eloquent features.\n\n\"It _is_ nonsense,--for the makers of the legend forgot one thing;\" he\ncontinued, dropping his voice to a whisper as we passed under the\ncarved gothic portico--\"The cross may be present,----but----so is the\nclergyman! And wherever a clergyman is, the devil may surely follow!\"\n\nI almost laughed aloud at his manner of making this irreverent\nobservation, and the look with which he accompanied it. The rich tones\nof the organ creeping softly on the flower-scented silence however,\nquickly solemnized my mood,--and while I leaned against the altar-rails\nwaiting for my bride, I caught myself wondering for the hundredth time\nor more, at my comrade's singularly proud and kingly aspect, as with\nfolded arms and lifted head, he contemplated the lily-decked altar and\nthe gleaming crucifix upon it, his meditative eyes bespeaking a curious\nmingling of reverence and contempt.\n\nOne incident I remember, as standing out particularly in all the glare\nand glitter of the brilliant scene, and this occurred at the signing of\nour names in the register. When Sibyl, a vision of angelic loveliness in\nall her bridal white, affixed her signature to the entry, Lucio bent\ntowards her,--\n\n\"As 'best man' I claim an old-fashioned privilege!\" he said, and kissed\nher lightly on the cheek. She blushed a vivid red,--then suddenly grew\nghastly pale,--and with a kind of choking cry, reeled back in a dead\nfaint in the arms of one of her bridesmaids. It was some minutes before\nshe was restored to consciousness,--but she made light both of my alarm\nand the consternation of her friends,--and assuring us that it was\nnothing but the effect of the heat of the weather and the excitement of\nthe day, she took my arm and walked down the aisle smilingly, through\nthe brilliant ranks of her staring and envious 'society' friends, all of\nwhom coveted her good fortune, not because she had married a worthy or\ngifted man,--that would have been no special matter for\ncongratulation,--but simply because she had married five millions of\nmoney! I was the appendage to the millions--nothing further. She held\nher head high and haughtily, though I felt her tremble as the thundering\nstrains of the 'Bridal March' from Lohengrin poured sonorous triumph on\nthe air. She trod on roses all the way,--I remembered that too, ...\nafterwards! Her satin slipper crushed the hearts of a thousand innocent\nthings that must surely have been more dear to God than she;--the little\nharmless souls of flowers, whose task in life, sweetly fulfilled, had\nbeen to create beauty and fragrance by their mere existence, expired to\ngratify the vanity of one woman to whom nothing was sacred. But I\nanticipate,--I was yet in my fool's dream,--and imagined that the dying\nblossoms were happy to perish thus beneath her tread!\n\nA grand reception was held at Lord Elton's house after the\nceremony,--and in the midst of the chattering, the eating and the\ndrinking, we,--my newly made wife and I,--departed amid the profuse\nflatteries and good wishes of our 'friends' who, primed with the very\nfinest champagne, made a very decent show of being sincere. The last\nperson to say farewell to us at the carriage-door was Lucio,--and the\nsorrow I felt at parting with him was more than I could express in words.\nFrom the very hour of the dawning of my good fortune we had been almost\ninseparable companions,--I owed my success in society,--everything, even\nmy bride herself,--to his management and tact,--and though I had now won\nfor my life's partner the most beautiful of women, I could not\ncontemplate even the temporary breaking of the association between myself\nand my gifted and brilliant comrade, without a keen pang of personal pain\namid my nuptial joys. Leaning his arms on the carriage-window, he looked\nin upon us both, smiling.\n\n\"My spirit will be with you both in all your journeyings!\" he said--\"And\nwhen you return, I shall be one of the first to bid you welcome home.\nYour house-party is fixed for September, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes,--and you will be the most eagerly desired guest of all invited!\" I\nreplied heartily, pressing his hand.\n\n\"Fie, for shame!\" he retorted laughingly--\"Be not so disloyal of speech,\nGeoffrey! Are you not going to entertain the Prince of Wales?--and\nshall anyone be more 'eagerly-desired' than he? No,--I must play a\nhumble third or even fourth on your list where Royalty is\nconcerned,--_my_ princedom is alas! not that of Wales,--and the throne I\nmight claim (if I had anyone to help me, which I have not) is a long way\nremoved from that of England!\"\n\nSibyl said nothing,--but her eyes rested on his handsome face and fine\nfigure with an odd wonder and wistfulness, and she was very pale.\n\n\"Good-bye Lady Sibyl!\" he added gently--\"All joy be with you! To us who\nare left behind, your absence will seem long,--but to _you_,--ah!--Love\ngives wings to time, and what would be to ordinary folks a month of mere\ndull living, will be for you nothing but a moment's rapture! Love is\nbetter than wealth,--you have found that out already I know!--but I\nthink--and hope--that you are destined to make the knowledge more\ncertain and complete! Think of me sometimes! Au revoir!\"\n\nThe horses started,--a handful of rice flung by the society idiot who is\nalways at weddings, rattled against the door and on the roof of the\nbrougham, and Lucio stepped back, waving his hand. To the last we saw\nhim,--a tall stately figure on the steps of Lord Elton's\nmansion,--surrounded by an ultra-fashionable throng, ... bridesmaids in\nbright attire and picture-hats,--young girls all eager and\nexcited-looking, each of them no doubt longing fervently for the day to\ncome when they might severally manage to secure as rich a husband as\nmyself, ... match-making mothers and wicked old dowagers, exhibiting\npriceless lace on their capacious bosoms, and ablaze with diamonds, ...\nmen with white button-hole bouquets in their irreproachably fitting\nfrock-coats,--servants in gay liveries, and the usual street-crowd of\nidle sight-seers;--all this cluster of faces, costumes and flowers, was\npiled against the grey background of the stone portico,--and in the\nmidst, the dark beauty of Lucio's face and the luminance of his flashing\neyes made him the conspicuous object and chief centre of attraction, ...\nthen, ... the carriage turned a sharp corner,--the faces vanished,--and\nSibyl and I realised that from henceforward we were left alone,--alone\nto face the future and ourselves,--and to learn the lesson of love ...\nor hate ... for evermore together!\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nI cannot now trace the slow or swift flitting by of phantasmal events,\n... wild ghosts of days or weeks that drifted past, and brought me\ngradually and finally to a time when I found myself wandering, numb and\nstricken and sick at heart, by the shores of a lake in Switzerland,--a\nsmall lake, densely blue, with apparently a thought in its depths such\nas is reflected in a child's earnest eye. I gazed down at the clear and\nglistening water almost unseeingly,--the snow-peaked mountains\nsurrounding it were too high for the lifting of my aching\nsight,--loftiness, purity, and radiance were unbearable to my mind,\ncrushed as it was beneath a weight of dismal wreckage and ruin. What a\nfool was I ever to have believed that in this world there could be such\na thing as happiness! Misery stared me in the face,--life-long\nmisery,--and no escape but death. Misery!--it was the word which like a\nhellish groan, had been uttered by the three dreadful phantoms that had\nonce, in an evil vision, disturbed my rest. What had I done, I demanded\nindignantly of myself, to deserve this wretchedness which no wealth\ncould cure?--why was fate so unjust? Like all my kind, I was unable to\ndiscern the small yet strong links of the chain I had myself wrought,\nand which bound me to my own undoing,--I blamed fate, or rather\nGod,--and talked of injustice, merely because _I_ personally suffered,\nnever realizing that what I considered unjust was but the equitable\nmeasuring forth of that Eternal Law which is carried out with as\nmathematical an exactitude as the movement of the planets,\nnotwithstanding man's pigmy efforts to impede its fulfilment. The light\nwind blowing down from the snow peaks above me ruffled the placidity of\nthe little lake by which I aimlessly strolled,--I watched the tiny\nripples break over its surface like the lines of laughter on a human\nface, and wondered morosely whether it was deep enough to drown in! For\nwhat was the use of living on,--knowing what I knew! Knowing that she\nwhom I had loved, and whom I loved still in a way that was hateful to\nmyself, was a thing viler and more shameless in character than the\nveriest poor drab of the street who sells herself for current\ncoin,--that the lovely body and angel-face were but an attractive\ndisguise for the soul of a harpy,--a vulture of vice, ... my God!--an\nirrepressible cry escaped me as my thoughts went on and on in the\nnever-ending circle and problem of incurable, unspeakable despair,--and\nI threw myself down on a shelving bank of grass that sloped towards the\nlake and covered my face in a paroxysm of tearless agony.\n\nStill inexorable thought worked in my brain, and forced me to consider\nmy position. Was she,--was Sibyl--more to blame than I myself for all\nthe strange havoc wrought? I had married her of my own free will and\nchoice,--and she had told me beforehand--\"I am a contaminated creature,\ntrained to perfection in the lax morals and prurient literature of my\nday.\" Well,--and so it had proved! My own blood burned with shame as I\nreflected how ample and convincing were the proofs!--and, starting up\nfrom my recumbent posture I paced up and down again restlessly in a\nfever of self-contempt and disgust. What could I do with a woman such as\nshe to whom I was now bound for life? Reform her? She would laugh me to\nscorn for the attempt. Reform myself? She would sneer at me for an\neffeminate milksop. Besides, was not I as willing to be degraded as she\nwas to degrade me?--a very victim to my brute passions? Tortured and\nmaddened by my feelings I roamed about wildly, and started as if a\npistol-shot had been fired near me when the plash of oars sounded on the\nsilence and the keel of a small boat grated on the shore, the boatman\nwithin it respectfully begging me in mellifluous French to employ him\nfor an hour. I assented, and in a minute or two was out on the lake in\nthe middle of the red glow of sunset which turned the snow-summits to\npoints of flame, and the waters to the hue of ruby wine. I think the man\nwho rowed me saw that I was in no very pleasant humour, for he preserved\na discreet silence,--and I, pulling my hat partly over my eyes, lay back\nin the stern, still busy with my wretched musings. Only a month\nmarried!--and yet,--a sickening satiety had taken the place of the\nso-called 'deathless' lover's passion. There were moments even, when my\nwife's matchless physical beauty appeared hideous to me. I knew her as\nshe was,--and no exterior charm could ever again cover for me the\nrevolting nature within. And what puzzled me from dawn to dusk was her\npolished, specious hypocrisy,--her amazing aptitude for lies! To look at\nher,--to hear her speak,--one would have deemed her a very saint of\npurity,--a delicate creature whom a coarse word would startle and\noffend,--a very incarnation of the sweetest and most gracious\nwomanhood,--all heart and feeling and sympathy. Everyone thought thus of\nher,--and never was there a greater error. Heart she had none; that fact\nwas borne in upon me two days after our marriage while we were in Paris,\nfor there a telegram reached us announcing her mother's death. The\nparalysed Countess of Elton had, it appeared, expired suddenly on our\nwedding-day, or rather our wedding night,--but the Earl had deemed it\nbest to wait forty-eight hours before interrupting our hymeneal\nhappiness with the melancholy tidings. He followed his telegram by a\nbrief letter to his daughter, in which the concluding lines were\nthese--\"As you are a bride and are travelling abroad, I should advise\nyou by no means to go into mourning. Under the circumstances it is\nreally not necessary.\"\n\nAnd Sibyl had readily accepted his suggestion, keeping generally however\nto white and pale mauve colourings in her numerous and wonderful\ntoilettes, in order not to outrage the proprieties too openly in the\nopinions of persons known to her, whom she might possibly meet casually\nin the foreign towns we visited. No word of regret passed her lips, and\nno tears were shed for her mother's loss. She only said,\n\n\"What a good thing her sufferings are over!\"\n\nThen, with a little sarcastic smile, she had added--\n\n\"I wonder when we shall receive the Elton-Chesney wedding cards!\"\n\nI did not reply, for I was pained and grieved at her lack of all gentle\nfeeling in the matter, and I was also, to a certain extent,\nsuperstitiously affected by the fact of the death occurring on our\nmarriage-day. However this was now a thing of the past; a month had\nelapsed,--a month in which the tearing-down of illusions had gone on\ndaily and hourly,--till I was left to contemplate the uncurtained bare\nprose of life and the knowledge that I had wedded a beautiful feminine\nanimal with the soul of a shameless libertine. Here I pause and ask\nmyself,--Was not I also a libertine? Yes,--I freely admit it,--but the\nlibertinage of a man, while it may run to excess in hot youth, generally\nresolves itself, under the influence of a great love, into a strong\ndesire for undefiled sweetness and modesty in the woman beloved. If a\nman has indulged in both folly and sin, the time comes at last, when, if\nhe has any good left in him at all, he turns back upon himself and\nlashes his own vices with the scorpion-whip of self-contempt till he\nsmarts with the rage and pain of it,--and then, aching in every pulse\nwith his deserved chastisement, he kneels in spirit at the feet of some\npure, true-hearted woman whose white soul, like an angel, hovers\ncompassionately above him, and there lays down his life, saying \"Do what\nyou will with it,--it is yours!\" And woe to her who plays lightly with\nsuch a gift, or works fresh injury upon it! No man, even if he has in\nhis day, indulged in 'rapid' living, should choose a 'rapid' woman for\nhis wife,--he had far better put a loaded pistol to his head and make an\nend of it!\n\nThe sunset-glory began to fade from the landscape as the little boat\nglided on over the tranquil water, and a great shadow was on my mind,\nlike the shadow of that outer darkness which would soon be night. Again\nI asked myself--Was there no happiness possible in all the world? Just\nthen the Angelus chimed from a little chapel on the shore, and as it\nrang, a memory stirred in my brain moving me well-nigh to tears. Mavis\nClare was happy!--Mavis, with her frank fearless eyes, sweet face and\nbright nature,--Mavis, wearing her crown of Fame as simply as a child\nmight wear a wreath of may-blossom,--she, with a merely moderate share\nof fortune which even in its slight proportion was only due to her own\nhard incessant work,--she was happy. And I,--with my millions,--was\nwretched! How was it? Why was it? What had I done? I had lived as my\ncompeers lived,--I had followed the lead of all society,--I had feasted\nmy friends and effectually 'snubbed' my foes,--I had comported myself\nexactly as others of my wealth comport themselves,--and I had married a\nwoman whom most men, looking upon once, would have been proud to win.\nNevertheless there seemed to be a curse upon me. What had I missed out\nof life? I knew,--but was ashamed to own it, because I had previously\nscorned what I called the dream-nothings of mere sentiment. And now I\nhad to acknowledge the paramount importance of those 'dream-nothings'\nout of which all true living must come. I had to realize that my\nmarriage was nothing but the mere mating of the male and female\nanimal,--a coarse bodily union, and no more;--that all the finer and\ndeeper emotions which make a holy thing of human wedlock, were\nlacking,--the mutual respect, the trusting sympathy,--the lovely\nconfidence of mind with mind,--the subtle inner spiritual bond which no\nscience can analyse, and which is so much closer and stronger than the\nmaterial, and knits immortal souls together when bodies decay--these\nthings had no existence, and never would exist between my wife and me.\nThus, as far as I was concerned, there was a strange blankness in the\nworld,--I was thrust back upon myself for comfort and found none. What\nshould I do with my life, I wondered drearily! Win fame,--true\nfame,--after all? With Sibyl's witch-eyes mocking my efforts?--never!\nIf I had ever had any gifts of creative thought within me, _she_ would\nhave killed it!\n\nThe hour was over,--the boatman rowed me in to land, and I paid and\ndismissed him. The sun had completely sunk,--there were dense purple\nshadows darkening over the mountains, and one or two small stars faintly\ndiscernible in the east. I walked slowly back to the villa where we were\nstaying,--a 'd\u00c3\u00a9pendance' belonging to the large hotel of the district,\nwhich we had rented for the sake of privacy and independence, some of\nthe hotel-servants being portioned off to attend upon us, in addition to\nmy own man Morris, and my wife's maid. I found Sibyl in the garden,\nreclining in a basket-chair, her eyes fixed on the after-glow of the\nsunset, and in her hands a book,--one of the loathliest of the prurient\nnovels that have been lately written by women to degrade and shame their\nsex. With a sudden impulse of rage upon me which I could not resist, I\nsnatched the volume from her and flung it into the lake below. She made\nno movement of either surprise or offence,--she merely turned her eyes\naway from the glowing heavens, and looked at me with a little smile.\n\n\"How violent you are to-day, Geoffrey!\" she said.\n\nI gazed at her in sombre silence. From the light hat with its pale mauve\norchids that rested on her nut-brown hair, to the point of her daintily\nembroidered shoe, her dress was perfect,--and _she_ was perfect. _I_\nknew that,--a matchless piece of womanhood ... outwardly! My heart\nbeat,--there was a sense of suffocation in my throat,--I could have\nkilled her for the mingled loathing and longing which her beauty roused\nin me.\n\n\"I am sorry!\" I said hoarsely, avoiding her gaze--\"But I hate to see you\nwith such a book as that!\"\n\n\"You know its contents?\" she queried, with the same slight smile.\n\n\"I can guess.\"\n\n\"Such things have to be written, they say nowadays,\"--she went on--\"And,\ncertainly, to judge from the commendation bestowed on these sort of\nbooks by the press, it is very evident that the wave of opinion is\nsetting in the direction of letting girls know all about marriage before\nthey enter upon it, in order that they may do so with their eyes wide\nopen,--_very_ wide open!\" She laughed, and her laughter hurt me like a\nphysical wound. \"What an old-fashioned idea the bride of the poets and\nsixty-years-ago romancists seems now!\" she continued--\"Imagine her!--a\nshrinking tender creature, shy of beholders, timid of speech, ...\nwearing the emblematic veil, which in former days, you know, used to\ncover the face entirely, as a symbol that the secrets of marriage were\nas yet hidden from the maiden's innocent and ignorant eyes. Now the veil\nis worn flung back from the bride's brows, and she stares unabashed at\neverybody,--oh yes, indeed we know quite well what we are doing now when\nwe marry, thanks to the 'new' fiction!\"\n\n\"The new fiction is detestable,\"--I said hotly--\"Both in style and\nmorality. Even as a question of literature I wonder at your\ncondescending to read any of it. The woman whose dirty book I have just\nthrown away--and I feel no compunction for having done it,--is destitute\nof grammar as well as decency.\"\n\n\"Oh, but the critics don't notice that,\"--she interrupted, with a\ndelicate mockery vibrating in her voice--\"It is apparently not their\nbusiness to assist in preserving the purity of the English language.\nWhat they fall into raptures over is the originality of the 'sexual'\ntheme, though I should have thought all such matters were as old as the\nhills. I never read reviews as a rule, but I did happen to come across\none on the book you have just drowned,--and in it, the reviewer stated\nhe had cried over it!\"\n\nShe laughed again.\n\n\"Beast!\" I said emphatically--\"He probably found in it some glozing-over\nof his own vices. But you, Sibyl--why do you read such stuff?--how can\nyou read it?\"\n\n\"Curiosity moved me in the first place,\"--she answered listlessly--\"I\nwanted to see what makes a reviewer cry! Then when I began to read, I\nfound that the story was all about the manner in which men amuse\nthemselves with the soiled doves of the highways and bye-ways,--and as I\nwas not very well instructed in that sort of thing, I thought I might as\nwell learn! You know these unpleasant morsels of information on\nunsavoury subjects are like the reputed suggestions of the devil,--if\nyou listen to one, you are bound to hear more. Besides, literature is\nsupposed to reflect the time we live in,--and that kind of literature\nbeing more prevalent than anything else, we are compelled to accept and\nstudy it as the mirror of the age.\"\n\nWith an expression on her face that was half mirth and half scorn, she\nrose from her seat, and looked down into the lovely lake below her.\n\n\"The fishes will eat that book,--\" she observed--\"I hope it will not\npoison them! If they could read and understand it, what singular ideas\nthey would have of us human beings!\"\n\n\"Why don't you read Mavis Clare's books?\" I asked suddenly--\"You told me\nyou admired her.\"\n\n\"So I do,--immensely!\" she answered,--\"I admire her and wonder at her,\nboth together. How that woman can keep her child's heart and child's\nfaith in a world like this, is more than I can understand. It is always\na perfect marvel to me,--a sort of supernatural surprise. You ask me why\ndon't I read her books,--I do read them,--I've read them all over and\nover again,--but she does not write many, and one has to wait for her\nproductions longer than for those of most authors. When I want to feel\nlike an angel, I read Mavis Clare,--but I more often am inclined to feel\nthe other way, and then her books are merely so many worries to me.\"\n\n\"Worries?\" I echoed.\n\n\"Yes. It is worrying to find somebody believing in a God when _you_\ncan't believe in Him,--to have beautiful faiths offered to you which\n_you_ can't grasp,--and to know that there is a creature alive, a woman\nlike yourself in everything except mind, who is holding fast a happiness\nwhich you can never attain,--no, not though you held out praying hands\nday and night and shouted wild appeals to the dull heavens!\"\n\nAt that moment she looked like a queen of tragedy,--her violet eyes\nablaze,--her lips apart,--her breast heaving;----I approached her with a\nstrange nervous hesitation and touched her hand. She gave it to me\npassively,--I drew it through my arm, and for a minute or two we paced\nsilently up and down the gravel walk. The lights from the monster hotel\nwhich catered for us and our wants, were beginning to twinkle from\nbasement to roof,--and just above the ch\u00c3\u00a2let we rented, a triad of stars\nsparkled in the shape of a trefoil.\n\n\"Poor Geoffrey!\" she said presently, with a quick upward glance at\nme,--\"I am sorry for you! With all my vagaries of disposition I am not a\nfool, and at anyrate I have learned how to analyse myself as well as\nothers. I read you as easily as I read a book,--I see what a strange\ntumult your mind is in! You love me--and you loathe me!--and the\ncontrast of emotion makes a wreck of you and your ideals. Hush,--don't\nspeak; I know,--I know! But what would you have me be? An angel? I\ncannot realize such a being for more than a fleeting moment of\nimagination. A saint? They were all martyred. A good woman? I never met\none. Innocent?--ignorant? I told you before we married that I was\nneither; there is nothing left for me to discover as far as the\nrelations between men and women are concerned,--I have taken the measure\nof the inherent love of vice in both sexes. There is not a pin to choose\nbetween them,--men are no worse than women,--women no worse than men. I\nhave discovered everything--except God!--and I conclude no God could\never have designed such a crazy and mean business as human life.\"\n\nWhile she thus spoke, I could have fallen at her feet and implored her\nto be silent. For she was, unknowingly, giving utterance to some of the\nmany thoughts in which I myself had frequently indulged,--and yet, from\nher lips they sounded cruel, unnatural, and callous to a degree that\nmade me shrink from her in fear and agony. We had reached a little grove\nof pines,--and here in the silence and shadow I took her in my arms and\nstared disconsolately upon the beauty of her face.\n\n\"Sibyl!\" I whispered--\"Sibyl, what is wrong with us both? How is it that\nwe do not seem to find the loveliest side of love?--why is it that even\nin our kisses and embraces, some impalpable darkness comes between us,\nso that we anger or weary each other when we should be glad and\nsatisfied? What is it? Can you tell? For you know the darkness is\nthere!\"\n\nA curious look came into her eyes,--a far-away strained look of hungry\nyearning, mingled, as I thought, with compassion for me.\n\n\"Yes, it is there!\" she answered slowly--\"And it is of our own mutual\ncreation. I believe you have something nobler in your nature, Geoffrey,\nthan I have in mine,--an indefinable something that recoils from me and\nmy theories despite your wish and will. Perhaps if you had given way to\nthat feeling in time, you would never have married me. You speak of the\nloveliest side of love,--to me there is no lovely side,--it is all\ncoarse and horrible! You and I for instance,--cultured man and\nwoman,--we cannot, in marriage, get a flight beyond the common emotions\nof Hodge and his girl!\" She laughed violently, and shuddered in my arms.\n\"What liars the poets are, Geoffrey! They ought to be sentenced to\nlife-long imprisonment for their perjuries! They help to mould the\ncredulous beliefs of a woman's heart;--in her early youth she reads\ntheir delicious assurances, and imagines that love will be all they\nteach,--a thing divine and lasting beyond earthly countings;--then comes\nthe coarse finger of prose on the butterfly-wing of poesy, and the\nbitterness and hideousness of complete disillusion!\"\n\nI held her still in my arms with the fierce grasp of a man clinging to a\nspar ere he drowns in mid-ocean.\n\n\"But I love you Sibyl!----my wife, I love you!\" I said, with a passion\nthat choked my utterance.\n\n\"You love me,--yes, I know, but how? In a way that is abhorrent to\nyourself!\" she replied--\"It is not poetic love,--it is man's love, and\nman's love is brute love. So it is,--so it will be,--so it must be.\nMoreover the brute-love soon tires,--and when it dies out from satiety\nthere is nothing left. Nothing, Geoffrey,--absolutely nothing but a\nblank and civil form of intercourse, which I do not doubt we shall be\nable to keep up for the admiration and comment of society!\"\n\nShe disengaged herself from my embrace, and moved towards the house.\n\n\"Come!\" she added, turning her exquisite head back over her shoulder\nwith a feline caressing grace that she alone possessed, \"You know there\nis a famous lady in London who advertises her saleable charms to the\noutside public by means of her monogram worked into the lace of all her\nwindow-blinds, thinking it no doubt good for trade! I am not quite so\nbad as that! You have paid dearly for me I know;--but remember I as yet\nwear no jewels but yours, and crave no gifts beyond those you are\ngenerous enough to bestow,--and my dutiful desire is to give you as much\nfull value as I can for your money.\"\n\n\"Sibyl, you kill me!\" I cried, tortured beyond endurance, \"Do you think\nme so base----\"\n\nI broke off with almost a sob of despair.\n\n\"You cannot help being base,\" she said, steadily regarding me,--\"because\nyou are a man. I am base because I am a woman. If we believed in a God,\neither of us, we might discover some different way of life and love--who\nknows?--but neither you nor I have any remnant of faith in a Being whose\nexistence all the scientists of the day are ever at work to disprove. We\nare persistently taught that we are animals and nothing more,--let us\ntherefore not be ashamed of animalism. Animalism and atheism are\napproved by the scientists and applauded by the press,--and the clergy\nare powerless to enforce the faith they preach. Come Geoffrey, don't\nstay mooning like a stricken Parsifal under those pines,--throw away\nthat thing which troubles you, your conscience,--throw it away as you\nhave thrown the book I was lately reading, and consider this,--that most\nmen of your type take pride and rejoice in being the prey of a bad\nwoman!--so you should really congratulate yourself on having one for a\nwife!--one who is so broad-minded too, that she will always let you have\nyour own way in everything you do, provided you let her have hers! It is\nthe way all marriages are arranged nowadays,--at any rate in _our_\nset,--otherwise the tie would be impossible of endurance. Come!\"\n\n\"We cannot live together on such an understanding, Sibyl!\" I said\nhoarsely, as I walked slowly by her side towards the villa.\n\n\"Oh yes, we can!\" she averred, a little malign smile playing round her\nlips--\"We can do as others do,--there is no necessity for us to stand\nout from the rest like quixotic fools, and pose as models to other\nmarried people,--we should only be detested for our pains. It is surely\nbetter to be popular than virtuous,--virtue never pays! See, there is\nour interesting German waiter coming to inform us that dinner is ready;\nplease don't look so utterly miserable, for we have not quarrelled, and\nit would be foolish to let the servants think we have.\"\n\nI made no answer. We entered the house, and dined,--Sibyl keeping up a\nperfect fire of conversation, to which I replied in mere\nmonosyllables,--and after dinner we went as usual to sit in the\nilluminated gardens of the adjacent hotel, and hear the band. Sibyl was\nknown, and universally admired and flattered by many of the people\nstaying there,----and, as she moved about among her acquaintances,\nchatting first with one group and then with another, I sat in moody\nsilence, watching her with increasing wonderment and horror. Her beauty\nseemed to me like the beauty of the poison-flower, which, brilliant in\ncolour and perfect in shape, exhales death to those who pluck it from\nits stem. And that night, when I held her in my arms, and felt her heart\nbeating against my own in the darkness, an awful dread arose in me,--a\ndread as to whether I might not at some time or other be tempted to\nstrangle her as she lay on my breast----strangle her as one would\nstrangle a vampire that sucked one's blood and strength away!\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nWe concluded our wedding-tour rather sooner than we had at first\nintended, and returned to England and Willowsmere Court, about the\nmiddle of August. I had a vague notion stirring in me that gave me a\nsort of dim indefinable consolation, and it was this,--I meant to bring\nmy wife and Mavis Clare together, believing that the gentle influence of\nthe gracious and happy creature, who, like a contented bird in its nest,\ndwelt serene in the little domain so near my own, might have a softening\nand wholesome effect upon Sibyl's pitiless love of analysis and scorn of\nall noble ideals. The heat in Warwickshire was at this time\nintense,--the roses were out in their full beauty, and the thick foliage\nof the branching oaks and elms in my grounds afforded grateful shade and\nrepose to the tired body, while the tranquil loveliness of the woodland\nand meadow scenery, comforted and soothed the equally tired mind. After\nall, there is no country in the world so fair as England,--none so\nrichly endowed with verdant forests and fragrant flowers,--none that can\nboast of sweeter nooks for seclusion and romance. In Italy, that land so\nover-praised by hysterical _poseurs_ who foolishly deem it admirable to\nglorify any country save their own, the fields are arid and brown, and\nparched by the too fervent sun,--there are no shady lanes such as\nEngland can boast of in all her shires,--and the mania among Italians\nfor ruthlessly cutting down their finest trees, has not only actually\ninjured the climate, but has so spoilt the landscape that it is\ndifficult to believe at all in its once renowned, and still erroneously\nreported charm. Such a bower of beauty as Lily Cottage was in that\nsultry August, could never have been discovered in all the length and\nbreadth of Italy. Mavis superintended the care of her gardens\nherself,--she had two gardeners, who under her directions, kept the\ngrass and trees continually watered,--and nothing could be imagined more\nlovely than the picturesque old-fashioned house, covered with roses and\ntufts of jessamine that seemed to tie up the roof in festal knots and\ngarlands, while around the building spread long reaches of deep emerald\nlawn, and bosky arbours of foliage where all the most musical song-birds\napparently found refuge and delight, and where at evening a perfect\ncolony of nightingales kept up a bubbling fountain of delicious melody.\nI remember well the afternoon, warm, languid and still, when I took\nSibyl to see the woman-author she had so long admired. The heat was so\ngreat that in our own grounds all the birds were silent, but when we\napproached Lily Cottage the first thing we heard was the piping of a\nthrush up somewhere among the roses,--a mellow liquid warble expressing\n'sweet content,' and mingling with the subdued coo-cooings of the dove\n'reviewers' who were commenting on whatever pleased or displeased them\nin the distance.\n\n\"What a pretty place it is!\" said my wife, as she peeped over the gate,\nand through the odorous tangles of honeysuckle and jessamine--\"I really\nthink it is prettier than Willowsmere. It has been wonderfully\nimproved.\"\n\nWe were shown in,--and Mavis, who had expected our visit did not keep us\nwaiting long. An she entered, clad in some gossamer white stuff that\nclung softly about her pretty figure and was belted in by a simple\nribbon, an odd sickening pang went through my heart. The fair untroubled\nface,--the joyous yet dreamy student eyes,--the sensitive mouth, and\nabove all, the radiant look of happiness that made the whole expression\nof her features so bright and fascinating, taught me in one flash of\nconviction all that a woman might be, and all that she too frequently is\nnot. And I had hated Mavis Clare!--I had even taken up my pen to deal\nher a wanton blow through the medium of anonymous criticism, ... but\nthis was before I knew her,--before I realized that there could be any\ndifference between her and the female scarecrows who so frequently pose\nas 'novelists' without being able to write correct English, and who talk\nin public of their 'copy' with the glibness gained from Grub Street and\nthe journalists' cheap restaurant. Yes--I had hated her,----and\nnow----now, almost I loved her! Sibyl, tall, queenly and beautiful,\ngazed upon her with eyes that expressed astonishment as well as\nadmiration.\n\n\"To think that you are the famous Mavis Clare!\" she said, smiling, as\nshe held out her hand--\"I always heard and knew that you did not look at\nall literary, but I never quite realized that you could be exactly what\nI see you are!\"\n\n\"To look literary does not always imply that you _are_ literary!\"\nreturned Mavis, laughing a little--\"Too often I am afraid you will find\nthat the women who take pains to _look_ literary are ignorant of\nliterature! But how glad I am to see you, Lady Sibyl! Do you know I used\nto watch you playing about on the lawns at Willowsmere when I was quite\na little girl?\"\n\n\"And I used to watch you,\"--responded Sibyl--\"You used to make\ndaisy-chains and cowslip-balls in the fields opposite on the other side\nof the Avon. It is a great pleasure to me to know we are neighbours. You\nmust come and see me often at Willowsmere.\"\n\nMavis did not answer immediately,--she busied herself in pouring out tea\nand dispensing it to both of us. Sibyl, who was always on the alert for\nglimpses of character, noticed that she did not answer, and repeated her\nwords coaxingly.\n\n\"You will come, will you not? As often as you like,--the oftener the\nbetter. We must be friends, you know!\"\n\nMavis looked up then, a frank sweet smile in her eyes.\n\n\"Do you really mean it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mean it!\" echoed Sibyl--\"Why, of course I do!\"\n\n\"How can you doubt it!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, you must both forgive me for asking such a question\"--said Mavis\nstill smiling--\"But you see you are now among what are called the\n'county magnates,' and county magnates consider themselves infinitely\nabove all authors!\" She laughed outright, and her blue eyes twinkled\nwith fun. \"I think many of them estimate writers of books as some sort\nof strange outgrowth of humanity that is barely decent. It is\ndeliciously funny and always amuses me,--nevertheless, among my many\nfaults, the biggest one is, I fancy, pride, and a dreadfully obstinate\nspirit of independence. Now, to tell you the truth, I have been asked by\nmany so-called 'great' people to their houses, and when I _have_ gone, I\nhave generally been sorry for it afterwards.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked--\"They honour themselves by inviting you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think they take it in that way at all!\" she replied,\nshaking her fair head demurely--\"They fancy they have performed a great\nact of condescension,--whereas it is really I who condescend, for it is\nvery good of me, you know, to leave the society of the Pallas Athene in\nmy study for that of a flounced and frizzled lady of fashion!\" Her\nbright smile again irradiated her face and she went on--\"Once I was\nasked to luncheon with a certain baron and baroness who invited a few\nguests \"to meet me,\" so they said. I was not introduced to more than one\nor two of these people,--the rest sat and stared at me as if I were a\nnew kind of fish or fowl. Then the baron showed me his house, and told\nme the prices of his pictures and his china,--he was even good enough to\nexplain which was Dresden and which was Delft ware, though I believe,\nbenighted author as I am, I could have instructed him equally on these,\nand other matters. However I managed to smile amicably through the whole\nprogramme, and professed myself charmed and delighted in the usual\nway;--but they never asked me to visit them again,--and, (unless indeed\nthey wanted me to be impressed with their furniture-catalogue) I can\nnever make out what I did to be asked at all, and what I have done never\nto be asked any more!\"\n\n\"They must have been _parvenus_,\"--said Sibyl indignantly--\"No well-bred\npeople would have priced their goods to you, unless they happened to be\nJews.\"\n\nMavis laughed--a merry little laugh like a peal of bells,--then she\ncontinued--\n\n\"Well, I will not say who they were,--I must keep something for my\n'literary reminiscences' when I get old! Then all these people will be\nnamed, and go down to posterity as Dante's enemies went down to Dante's\nhell! I have only told you the incident just to show you why I asked you\nif you meant it, when you invited me to visit you at Willowsmere.\nBecause the baron and baroness I have spoken of 'gushed' over me and my\npoor books to such an extent that you would have fancied I was to be for\nevermore one of their dearest friends,--and they _didn't_ mean it! Other\npeople I know embrace me effusively and invite me to their houses, and\n_they_ don't mean it! And when I find out these shams, I like to make it\nvery clear on my own side that I do not seek to be embraced or invited,\nand that if certain great folks deem it a 'favour' to ask me to their\nhouses, I do not so consider it, but rather think the 'favour' is\nentirely on my part if I accept the invitation. And I do not say this\nfor my own self at all,--self has nothing to do with it,--but I do say\nit and strongly assert it for the sake of the dignity of Literature as\nan art and profession. If a few other authors would maintain this\nposition, we might raise the standard of letters by degrees to what it\nwas in the old days of Scott and Byron. I hope you do not think me too\nproud?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think you are quite right\"--said Sibyl\nearnestly--\"And I admire you for your courage and independence. Some of\nthe aristocracy are, I know, such utter snobs that often I feel ashamed\nto belong to them. But as far as we are concerned, I can only assure you\nthat if you will honour us by becoming our friend as well as neighbour,\nyou shall not regret it. Do try and like me if you can!\"\n\nShe bent forward with a witching smile on her fair face. Mavis looked at\nher seriously and admiringly.\n\n\"How beautiful you are!\" she said frankly--\"Everybody tells you this of\ncourse,--still, I cannot help joining in the general chorus. To me, a\nlovely face is like a lovely flower,--I must admire it. Beauty is quite\na divine thing, and though I am often told that the plain people are\nalways the good people, I never can quite believe it. Nature is surely\nbound to give a beautiful face to a beautiful spirit.\"\n\nSibyl, who had smiled with pleasure at the first words of the open\ncompliment paid her by one of the most gifted of her own sex, now\nflushed deeply.\n\n\"Not always, Miss Clare,\"--she said, veiling her brilliant eyes beneath\nthe droop of her long lashes--\"One can imagine a fair fiend as easily as\na fair angel.\"\n\n\"True!\" and Mavis looked at her musingly,--then suddenly laughing in her\nblithe bright way, she added--\"Quite true! Really I cannot picture an\nugly fiend,--for the fiends are supposed to be immortal, and I am\nconvinced that immortal ugliness has no part in the universe. Downright\nhideousness belongs to humanity alone,--and an ugly face is such a blot\non creation that we can only console ourselves by the reflection that it\nis fortunately perishable, and that in course of time the soul behind it\nwill be released from its ill-formed husk, and will be allowed to wear a\nfairer aspect. Yes, Lady Sibyl, I will come to Willowsmere; I cannot\nrefuse to look upon such loveliness as yours as often as I may!\"\n\n\"You are a charming flatterer!\" said Sibyl, rising and putting an arm\nround her in that affectionate coaxing way of hers which seemed so\nsincere, and which so frequently meant nothing--\"But I confess I prefer\nto be flattered by a woman rather than by a man. Men say the same things\nto all women,--they have a very limited r\u00c3\u00a9pertoire of compliments,--and\nthey will tell a fright she is beautiful, if it happens to serve their\nimmediate purpose. But women themselves can so hardly be persuaded to\nadmit that any good qualities exist either inwardly or outwardly in one\nanother, that when they do say a kind or generous thing of their own sex\nit is a wonder worth remembering. May I your study?\"\n\nMavis willingly assented,--and we all three went into the peaceful\nsanctum where the marble Pallas presided, and where the dogs Tricksy and\nEmperor were both ensconced,--Emperor sitting up on his haunches and\nsurveying the prospect from the window, and Tricksy with a most absurd\nair of importance, imitating the larger animal's attitude precisely, at\na little distance off. Both creatures were friendly to my wife and to\nme, and while Sibyl was stroking the St Bernard's massive head, Mavis\nsaid suddenly,\n\n\"Where is the friend who came with you here first, Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez?\"\n\n\"He is in St Petersburg just now,\"--I answered--\"But we expect him in\ntwo or three weeks to stay with us on a visit for some time.\"\n\n\"He is surely a very singular man,\"--said Mavis thoughtfully--\"Do you\nremember how strangely my dogs behaved to him? Emperor was quite\nrestless and troublesome for two or three hours after he had gone.\"\n\nAnd in a few words, she told Sibyl the incident of the St Bernard's\nattack upon Lucio.\n\n\"Some people have a natural antipathy to dogs,\"--said Sibyl, as she\nheard--\"And the dogs always find it out, and resent it. But I should not\nhave thought Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez had an antipathy to any creatures\nexcept--women!\"\n\nAnd she laughed, a trifle bitterly.\n\n\"Except women!\" echoed Mavis surprisedly--\"Does he hate women? He must\nbe a very good actor then,--for to me he was wonderfully kind and\ngentle.\"\n\nSibyl looked at her intently, and was silent for a minute. Then she\nsaid--\n\n\"Perhaps it is because he knows you are unlike the ordinary run of\nwomen and have nothing in common with their usual trumpery aims. Of\ncourse he is always courteous to our sex,--but I think it is easy to see\nthat his courtesy is often worn as a mere mask to cover a very different\nfeeling.\"\n\n\"You have perceived that, then, Sibyl?\" I said with a slight smile.\n\n\"I should be blind if I had not perceived it\"--she replied; \"I do not\nhowever blame him for his pet aversion,--I think it makes him all the\nmore attractive and interesting.\"\n\n\"He is a great friend of yours?\" inquired Mavis, looking at me as she\nput the question.\n\n\"The very greatest friend I have,\"--I replied quickly--\"I owe him more\nthan I can ever repay,--indeed I have to thank him even for introducing\nme to my wife!\"\n\nI said the words unthinkingly and playfully, but as I uttered them, a\nsudden shock affected my nerves,--a shock of painful memory. Yes, it was\ntrue!--I owed to him, to Lucio, the misery, fear, degradation and shame\nof having such a woman as Sibyl was, united to me till death should us\npart. I felt myself turning sick and giddy,--and I sat down in one of\nthe quaint oak chairs that helped to furnish Mavis Clare's study,\nallowing the two women to pass out of the open French window into the\nsunlit garden together, the dogs following at their heels. I watched\nthem as they went,--my wife, tall and stately, attired in the newest and\nmost fashionable mode,--Mavis, small and slight, with her soft white\ngown and floating waist-ribbon,--the one sensual, the other\nspiritual,--the one base and vicious in desire,--the other pure-souled\nand aspiring to noblest ends,--the one, a physically magnificent\nanimal,--the other merely sweet-faced and ideally fair like a sylph of\nthe woodlands,--and looking, I clenched my hands as I thought with\nbitterness of spirit what a mistaken choice I had made. In the profound\negotism which had always been part of my nature I now actually allowed\nmyself to believe that I might, had I chosen, have wedded Mavis\nClare,--never for one moment imagining that all my wealth would have\nbeen useless to me in such a quest, and that I might as well have\nproposed to pluck a star from the sky as to win a woman who was able to\nread my nature thoroughly, and who would never have come down to my\nmoney-level from her intellectual throne,--no, not though I had been a\nmonarch of many nations. I stared at the large tranquil features of the\nPallas Athene,--and the blank eyeballs of the marble goddess appeared to\nregard me in turn with impassive scorn. I glanced round the room,\nand at the walls adorned with the wise sayings of poets and\nphilosophers,--sayings that reminded me of truths which I knew, yet\nnever accepted as practicable; and presently my eyes were attracted to a\ncorner near the writing-desk which I had not noticed before, where there\nwas a small dim lamp burning. Above this lamp an ivory crucifix gleamed\nwhite against draperies of dark purple velvet,--below it, on a silver\nbracket, was an hour-glass through which the sand was running in\nglistening grains, and round the entire little shrine was written in\nletters of gold \"Now is the acceptable time!\"--the word 'Now' being in\nlarger characters than the rest. 'Now' was evidently Mavis's motto,--to\nlose no moment, but to work, to pray, to love, to hope, to thank God and\nbe glad for life, all in the 'Now'--and neither to regret the past nor\nforebode the future, but simply do the best that could be done, and\nleave all else in child-like confidence to the Divine Will. I got up\nrestlessly,--the sight of the crucifix curiously annoyed me;--and I\nfollowed the path my wife and Mavis had taken through the garden. I\nfound them looking in at the cage of the 'Athen\u00c3\u00a6um' owls,--the\nowl-in-chief being as usual puffed out with his own importance, and\nswelling visibly with indignation and excess of feather. Sibyl turned as\nshe saw me,--her face was bright and smiling.\n\n\"Miss Clare has very strong opinions of her own, Geoffrey,\" she\nsaid--\"She is not as much captivated by Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez as most people\nare,--in fact, she has just confided to me that she does not quite like\nhim.\"\n\nMavis blushed, but her eyes met mine with fearless candour.\n\n\"It is wrong to say what one thinks, I know,--\" she murmured in somewhat\ntroubled accents--\"And it is a dreadful fault of mine. Please forgive me\nMr Tempest! You tell me the prince is your greatest friend,--and I\nassure you I was immensely impressed by his appearance when I first saw\nhim, ... but afterwards, ... after I had studied him a little, the\nconviction was borne in upon me that he was not altogether what he\nseemed.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what he says of himself,\"--I answered, laughing a\nlittle--\"He has a mystery I believe,--and he has promised to clear it up\nfor me some day. But I'm sorry you don't like him, Miss Clare,--for he\nlikes you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps when I meet him again my ideas may be different\"--said Mavis\ngently--\"at present, ... well,--do not let us talk of it any\nmore,--indeed I feel I have been very rude to express any opinion at all\nconcerning one for whom you and Lady Sibyl have so great a regard. But\nsomehow I seemed impelled, almost against my will, to say what I did\njust now.\"\n\nHer soft eyes looked pained and puzzled, and to relieve her and change\nthe subject, I asked if she was writing anything new.\n\n\"Oh yes,\"--she replied--\"It would never do for me to be idle. The public\nare very kind to me,--and no sooner have they read one thing of mine\nthan they clamour for another, so I am kept very busy.\"\n\n\"And what of the critics?\" I asked, with a good deal of curiosity.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"I never pay the least attention to them,\" she answered, \"except when\nthey are hasty and misguided enough to write lies about me,--then I very\nnaturally take the liberty to contradict those lies, either through my\nown statement or that of my lawyers. Apart from refusing to allow the\npublic to be led into a false notion of my work and aims, I have no\ngrudge whatever against the critics. They are generally very poor\nhard-working men, and have a frightful struggle to live. I have often,\nprivately, done some of them a good turn without their knowledge. A\npublisher of mine sent me an MS. the other day by one of my deadliest\nenemies on the press, and stated that my opinion would decide its\nrejection or acceptance,--I read it through, and though it was not very\nbrilliant work, it was good enough, so I praised it as warmly as I\ncould, and urged its publication, with the stipulation that the author\nshould never be told I had had the casting vote. It has just come out I\nsee,--and I'm sure I hope it will succeed.\" Here she paused to gather a\nfew deep damask roses, which she handed to Sibyl. \"Yes,--critics are\nvery badly, even cruelly paid,\"--she went on musingly--\"It is not to be\nexpected that they should write eulogies of the successful author, while\nthey continue unsuccessful,--such work could not be anything but gall\nand wormwood to them. I know the poor little wife of one of them,--and\nsettled her dressmaker's bill for her because she was afraid to show it\nto her husband. The very week afterwards he slashed away at my last book\nin the most approved style in the paper on which he is employed, and\ngot, I suppose, about a guinea for his trouble. Of course he didn't know\nabout his little wife and her dunning dressmaker; and he never will\nknow, because I have bound her over to secrecy.\"\n\n\"But why do you do such things?\" asked Sibyl astonished; \"I would have\nlet his wife get into the County Court for her bill, if I had been you!\"\n\n\"Would you?\" and Mavis smiled gravely--\"Well, I could not. You know Who\nit was that said 'Bless them that curse you, and do good to them that\nhate you'? Besides, the poor little woman was frightened to death at her\nown expenditure. It is pitiful, you know, to see the helpless agonies of\npeople who _will_ live beyond their incomes,--they suffer much more than\nthe beggars in the street who make frequently more than a pound a day by\nmerely whining and snivelling. The critics are much more in evil case\nthan the beggars--few of them make even a pound a day, and of course\nthey regard as their natural enemies the authors who make thirty to\nfifty pounds a week. I assure you I am very sorry for critics all\nround,--they are the least-regarded and worst-rewarded of all the\nliterary community. And I never bother myself at all about what they say\nof me, except as I before observed, when in their haste they tell\nlies,--then of course it becomes necessary for me to state the truth in\nsimple self-defence as well as by way of duty to my public. But as a\nrule I hand over all my press-notices to Tricksy there,\"--indicating the\nminute Yorkshire terrier who followed closely at the edge of her white\ngown,--\"and he tears them to indistinguishable shreds in about three\nminutes!\"\n\nShe laughed merrily, and Sibyl smiled, watching her with the same wonder\nand admiration that had been expressed in her looks more or less since\nthe beginning of our interview with this light-hearted possessor of\nliterary fame. We were now walking towards the gate, preparatory to\ntaking our departure.\n\n\"May I come and talk to you sometimes?\" my wife said suddenly, in her\nprettiest and most pleading voice--\"It would be such a privilege!\"\n\n\"You can come whenever you like in the afternoons,\"--replied Mavis\nreadily--\"The mornings belong to a goddess more dominant even than\nBeauty;--Work!\"\n\n\"You never work at night?\" I asked.\n\n\"Indeed no! I never turn the ordinances of Nature upside down, as I am\nsure I should get the worst of it if I made such an attempt. The night\nis for sleep--and I use it thankfully for that blessed purpose.\"\n\n\"Some authors can only write at night though,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you may be sure they only produce blurred pictures and indistinct\ncharacterization,\" said Mavis--\"Some I know there are, who invite\ninspiration through gin or opium, as well as through the midnight\ninfluences, but I do not believe in such methods. Morning, and a freshly\nrested brain are required for literary labour,--that is, if one wants\nto write a book that will last for more than one 'season.'\"\n\nShe accompanied us to the gate and stood under the porch, her big dog\nbeside her, and the roses waving high over her head.\n\n\"At any rate work agrees with you,\"--said Sibyl fixing upon her a long,\nintent, almost envious gaze--\"You look perfectly happy.\"\n\n\"I _am_ perfectly happy,\"--she answered, smiling--\"I have nothing in all\nthe world to wish for, except that I may die as peacefully as I have\nlived.\"\n\n\"May that day be far distant!\" I said earnestly.\n\nShe raised her soft meditative eyes to mine.\n\n\"Thank you!\" she responded gently--\"But I do not mind when it comes, so\nlong as it finds me ready.\"\n\nShe waved her hand to us as we left her and turned the corner of the\nlane,--and for some minutes we walked on slowly in absolute silence.\nThen at last Sibyl spoke--\n\n\"I quite understand the hatred there is in some quarters for Mavis\nClare,\"--she said--\"I am afraid I begin to hate her myself!\"\n\nI stopped and stared at her, astonished and confounded.\n\n\"You begin to hate her----you?--and why?\"\n\n\"Are you so blind that you cannot perceive why?\" she retorted, the\nlittle malign smile I knew so well playing round her lips--\"Because she\nis happy! Because she has no scandals in her life, and because she dares\nto be content! One longs to make her miserable! But how to do it? She\nbelieves in a God,--she thinks all He ordains is right and good. With\nsuch a firm faith as that, she would be happy in a garret earning but a\nfew pence a day. I see now perfectly how she has won her public,--it is\nby the absolute conviction she has herself of the theories of life she\ntries to instil. What can be done against her? Nothing! But I understand\nwhy the critics would like to 'quash' her,--if I were a critic, fond of\nwhiskey-and-soda, and music-hall women, I should like to quash her\nmyself for being so different to the rest of her sex!\"\n\n\"What an incomprehensible woman you are, Sibyl!\" I exclaimed with real\nirritation,--\"You admire Miss Clare's books,--you have always admired\nthem,--you have asked her to become your friend,--and almost in the same\nbreath you aver you would like to 'quash' her or to make her miserable!\nI confess I cannot understand you!\"\n\n\"Of course you cannot!\" she responded tranquilly, her eyes resting upon\nme with a curious expression, as we paused for an instant under the deep\nshade of a chestnut tree before entering our own grounds--\"I never\nsupposed you could, and unlike the ordinary _femme incomprise_, I have\nnever blamed you for your want of comprehension. It has taken me some\ntime to understand myself, and even now I am not quite sure that I have\ngauged the depths or shallownesses of my own nature correctly. But on\nthis matter of Mavis Clare, can you not imagine that badness may hate\ngoodness? That the confirmed drunkard may hate the sober citizen? That\nthe outcast may hate the innocent maiden? And that it is possible that\nI,--reading life as I do, and finding it loathsome in many of its\naspects,--distrusting men and women utterly,--and being destitute of any\nfaith in God,--may hate,--yes _hate_,\"--and she clenched her hand on a\ntuft of drooping leaves and scattered the green fragments at her\nfeet--\"a woman who finds life beautiful, and God existent,--who takes no\npart in our social shams and slanders,--and who in place of my\nself-torturing spirit of analysis, has secured an enviable fame and the\nhonour of thousands, allied to a serene content? Why it would be\nsomething worth living for, to make such a woman wretched for once in\nher life!--but, as she is constituted, it is impossible to do it.\"\n\nShe turned from me and walked slowly onward,--I following in a pained\nsilence.\n\n\"If you do not mean to be her friend, you should tell her so,\"--I said\npresently--\"You heard what she said about pretended protestations of\nregard?\"\n\n\"I heard,\"--she replied morosely--\"She is a clever woman, Geoffrey, and\nyou may trust her to find me out without any explanation!\"\n\nAs she said this, I raised my eyes and looked full at her,--her\nexceeding beauty was becoming almost an agony to my sight, and in a\nsudden fool's paroxysm of despair I exclaimed--\n\n\"O Sibyl, Sibyl! Why were you made as you are!\"\n\n\"Ah, why indeed!\" she rejoined, with a faint mocking smile--\"And why,\nbeing made as I am, was I born an Earl's daughter? If I had been a drab\nof the street, I should have been in my proper place,--and novels would\nhave been written about me, and plays,--and I might have become such a\nheroine as should cause all good men to weep for joy because of my\ngenerosity in encouraging their vices! But as an Earl's daughter,\nrespectably married to a millionaire, am a mistake of nature. Yet nature\ndoes make mistakes sometimes Geoffrey, and when she does they are\ngenerally irremediable!\"\n\nWe had now reached our own grounds, and I walked, in miserable mood,\nbeside her across the lawn towards the house.\n\n\"Sibyl,\"--I said at last--\"I had hoped you and Mavis Clare might be\nfriends.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"So we shall be friends I daresay,--for a little while\"--she\nreplied--\"But the dove does not willingly consort with the raven, and\nMavis Clare's way of life and studious habits would be to me\ninsufferably dull. Besides, as I said before, she, as a clever woman and\na thinker, is too clear-sighted not to find me out in the course of\ntime. But I will play humbug as long as I can. If I perform the part of\n'county lady' or 'patron,' of course she won't stand me for a moment. I\nshall have to assume a much more difficult r\u00c3\u00b4le,--that of an honest\nwoman!\"\n\nAgain she laughed,--a cruel little laugh that chilled my blood, and\npaced slowly into the house through the open windows of the\ndrawing-room. And I, left alone in the garden among the nodding roses\nand waving trees, felt that the beautiful domain of Willowsmere had\nsuddenly grown hideous and bereft of all its former charm, and was\nnothing but a haunted house of desolation,--haunted by an all-dominant\nand ever victorious Spirit of Evil.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nOne of the strangest things in all the strange course of our human life\nis the suddenness of certain unlooked-for events, which, in a day or\neven an hour, may work utter devastation where there has been more or\nless peace, and hopeless ruin where there has been comparative safety.\nLike the shock of an earthquake, the clamorous incidents thunder in on\nthe regular routine of ordinary life, crumbling down our hopes, breaking\nour hearts, and scattering our pleasures into the dust and ashes of\ndespair. And this kind of destructive trouble generally happens in the\nmidst of apparent prosperity, without the least warning, and with all\nthe abrupt fierceness of a desert-storm. It is constantly made manifest\nto us in the unexpected and almost instantaneous downfall of certain\nmembers of society who have held their heads proudly above their\ncompeers and have presumed to pose as examples of light and leading to\nthe whole community; we see it in the capricious fortunes of kings and\nstatesmen, who are in favour one day and disgraced the next, and vast\nchanges are wrought with such inexplicable quickness that it is scarcely\nwonderful to hear of certain religious sects who, when everything is\nprospering more than usually well with them, make haste to put on\ngarments of sackcloth, and cast ashes on their heads, praying aloud\n\"Prepare us, O Lord, for the evil days which are at hand!\" The\nmoderation of the Stoics, who considered it impious either to rejoice or\ngrieve, and strove to maintain an equable middle course between the\nopposing elements of sorrow and joy, without allowing themselves to be\nled away by over-much delight or over-much melancholy, was surely a wise\nhabit of temperament. I, who lived miserably as far as my inner and\nbetter consciousness was concerned, was yet outwardly satisfied with the\nmaterial things of life and the luxuries surrounding me,--and I began to\ntake comfort in these things, and with them endeavoured to quell and\nignore my more subtle griefs, succeeding so far in that I became more\nand more of a thorough materialist every day, loving bodily ease,\nappetizing food, costly wine, and personal indulgence to a degree that\nrobbed me gradually of even the desire for mental effort. I taught\nmyself moreover, almost insensibly, to accept and tolerate what I knew\nof the wanton side of my wife's character,--true, I respected her less\nthan the Turk respects the creature of his harem,--but like the Turk, I\ntook a certain savage satisfaction in being the possessor of her beauty,\nand with this feeling, and the brute passion it engendered, I was fain\nto be content. So that for a short time at least, the drowsy\nsatisfaction of a well-fed, well-mated animal was mine,--I imagined that\nnothing short of a stupendous financial catastrophe to the country\nitself could exhaust my stock of cash,--and that therefore there was no\nnecessity for me to exert myself in any particular branch of usefulness,\nbut simply to 'eat drink and be merry' as Solomon advised. Intellectual\nactivity was paralysed in me,--to take up my pen and write, and make\nanother and higher bid for fame, was an idea that now never entered my\nmind; I spent my days in ordering about my servants, and practising the\npetty pleasures of tyranny on gardeners and grooms, and in generally\ngiving myself airs of importance, mingled with an assumption of\ntoleration and benevolence, for the benefit of all those in my employ. I\nknew the proper thing to do, well enough!--I had not studied the ways of\nthe over-wealthy for nothing,--I was aware that the rich man never feels\nso thoroughly virtuous as when he has inquired after the health of his\ncoachman's wife, and has sent her a couple of pounds for the outfit of\nher new-born baby. The much prated-of 'kindness of heart' and\n'generosity' possessed by millionaires, generally amounts to this kind\nof thing,--and when, if idly strolling about my parklands, I happened to\nmeet the small child of my lodge-keeper, and then and there bestowed\nsixpence upon it, I almost felt as if I deserved a throne in Heaven at\nthe right hand of the Almighty, so great was my appreciation of my own\ngood-nature. Sibyl, however, never affected this sort of county-magnate\nbeneficence. She did nothing at all among our poor neighbours;--the\nclergyman of the district unfortunately happened to let slip one day a\nfew words to the effect that \"there was no great want of anything among\nhis parishioners, owing to the continual kindness and attention of Miss\nClare,\"--and Sibyl never from that moment proffered any assistance. Now\nand then she took her graceful person into Lily Cottage and sat with its\nhappy and studious occupant for an hour,--and occasionally the fair\nauthor herself came and dined with us, or had 'afternoon tea' under the\nbranching elms on the lawn,--but even I, intense egotist as I was, could\nsee that Mavis was scarcely herself on these occasions. She was always\ncharming and bright of course,--indeed the only times in which I was\nable to partially forget myself and the absurdly increasing importance\nof my personality in my own esteem, were when she, with her sweet voice\nand animated manner, brought her wide knowledge of books, men, and\nthings, to bear on the conversation, thus raising it to a higher level\nthan was ever reached by my wife or me. Yet I now and then noticed a\ncertain vague constraint about her,--and her frank eyes had frequently a\npained and questioning look of trouble when they rested for any length\nof time on the enchanting beauty of Sibyl's face and form. I, however,\npaid little heed to these trifling matters, my whole care being to lose\nmyself more and more utterly in the enjoyment of purely physical ease\nand comfort, without troubling myself as to what such self-absorption\nmight lead in the future. To be completely without a conscience, without\na heart and without sentiment was, I perceived, the best way to keep\none's appetite, and preserve one's health;--to go about worrying over\nthe troubles of other people, or put one's self out to do any good in\nthe world, would involve such an expenditure of time and trouble as must\ninevitably spoil one's digestion,--and I saw that no millionaire or even\nmoderately rich man cares to run the risk of injuring his digestion for\nthe sake of performing a kindness to a poorer fellow-creature. Profiting\nby the examples presented to me everywhere in society, I took care of\n_my_ digestion, and was particular about the way in which my meals were\ncooked and served,--particular too, as to the fashion in which my wife\ndressed for those meals,--for it suited my supreme humour to see her\nbeauty bedecked as suitably and richly as possible, that I might have\nthe satisfaction of considering her 'points' with the same epicurean\nfastidiousness as I considered a dish of truffles or specially prepared\ngame. I never thought of the stern and absolute law--\"Unto whom much is\ngiven, even from him should much be required;\"--I was scarcely aware of\nit in fact,--the New Testament was of all books in the world the most\nunfamiliar to me. And while I wilfully deafened myself to the voice of\nconscience,--that voice which ever and anon urged me in vain to a nobler\nexistence,--the clouds were gathering, ready to burst above me with that\nterrific suddenness such as always seems to us who refuse to study the\ncauses of our calamities, as astonishing and startling as death itself.\nFor we are always more or less startled at death notwithstanding that it\nis the commonest occurrence known.\n\nTowards the middle of September my 'royal and distinguished' house-party\narrived and stayed at Willowsmere Court for a week. Of course it is\nunderstood that whenever the Prince of Wales honours any private\nresidence with a visit, he selects, if not all, at any rate the greater\npart of those persons who are to be invited to meet him. He did so in\nthe present instance, and I was placed in the odd position of having to\nentertain certain people whom I had never met before, and who, with the\nquestionable taste frequently exhibited among the 'upper ten,' looked\nupon me merely as \"the man with the millions,\" the caterer for their\nprovisions, and no more,--directing their chief attention to Sibyl, who\nwas by virtue of her birth and associations one of their 'set,' and\npushing me, their host, more or less into the background. However the\nglory of entertaining Royalty more than sufficed for my poor pride at\nthat time, and with less self-respect than an honest cur, I was content\nto be snubbed and harassed and worried a hundred times a day by one or\nthe other of the 'great' personages who wandered at will all over my\nhouse and grounds, and accepted my lavish hospitality. Many people\nimagine that it must be an 'honour' to entertain a select party of\naristocrats, but I, on the contrary, consider that it is not only a\ndegradation to one's manlier and more independent instincts, but also a\nbore. These highly-bred, highly-connected individuals, are for the most\npart unintelligent, and devoid of resources in their own minds,--they\nare not gifted as conversationalists or wits,--one gains no intellectual\nadvantage from their society,--they are simply dull folk, with an\nexaggerated sense of their own importance, who expect wherever they go,\nto be amused without trouble to themselves. Out of all the visitors at\nWillowsmere the only one whom it was really a pleasure to serve was the\nPrince of Wales himself,--and amid the many personal irritations I had\nto suffer from others, I found it a positive relief to render him any\nattention, however slight, because his manner was always marked by that\ntact and courtesy which are the best attributes of a true gentleman\nwhether he be prince or peasant. In his own affable way, he went one\nafternoon to see Mavis Clare, and came back in high good-humour, talking\nfor some time of nothing but the author of 'Differences,' and of the\nsuccess she had achieved in literature. I had asked Mavis to join our\nparty before the Prince came, as I felt pretty sure he would not have\nerased her name from the list of guests submitted to him,--but she would\nnot accept, and begged me very earnestly not to press the point.\n\n\"I like the Prince,\"--she had said--\"Most people like him who know\nhim,--but I do not always like those who surround him,--pardon me for my\nfrankness! The Prince of Wales is a social magnet,--he draws a number of\npersons after him who by dint of wealth, if not intelligence, can\ncontrive to 'push' into his set. Now I am not an advocate of\n'push'--moreover I do not care to be seen with 'everybody';--this is my\nsinful pride you will say, or as our American cousins would put it, my\n'cussedness.' But I assure you, Mr Tempest, the best possession I have,\nand one which I value a great deal more even than my literary success,\nis my absolute independence, and I would not have it thought, even\nerroneously, that I am anxious to mix with the crowd of sycophants and\ntime-servers who are only too ready to take advantage of the Prince's\ngood-nature.\"\n\nAnd, acting upon her determination, she had remained more than ever\nsecluded in her cottage-nest of foliage and flowers during the progress\nof the week's festivities,--the result being, as I have stated, that the\nPrince 'dropped in' upon her quite casually one day, accompanied by his\nequerry, and probably for all I knew, had the pleasure of seeing the\ndove 'reviewers' fed, and squabbling over their meal.\n\nMuch as we had desired and expected the presence of Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez at our\ngathering, he did not appear. He telegraphed his regrets from Paris, and\nfollowed the telegram by a characteristic letter, which ran thus:--\n\n    My dear Tempest.\n\n    You are very kind to wish to include me, your old friend, in the\n    party you have invited to meet His Royal Highness, and I only hope\n    you will not think me churlish for refusing to come. I am sick to\n    death of Royalties,--I have known so many of them in the course of\n    my existence that I begin to find their society monotonous. Their\n    positions are all so exactly alike too,--and moreover have always\n    been alike from the days of Solomon in all his glory, down to the\n    present blessed era of Victoria, Queen and Empress. One thirsts for\n    a change; at least I do. The only monarch that ever fascinated my\n    imagination particularly was Richard Coeur de Lion; there was\n    something original and striking about that man, and I presume he\n    would have been well worth talking to. And Charlemagne was\n    doubtless, as the slangy young man of the day would observe, 'not\n    half bad.' But for the rest,--_un fico!_ Much talk is there made\n    about Her Majesty Elizabeth, who was a shrew and a vixen and\n    blood-thirsty withal,--the chief glory of her reign was Shakespeare,\n    and he made kings and queens the dancing puppets of his thought. In\n    this, though in nothing else, I resemble him. You will have enough\n    to do in the entertainment of your distinguished guests, for I\n    suppose there is no amusement they have not tried, and found more or\n    less unsatisfactory, and I am sorry I can suggest nothing\n    particularly new for you to do. Her Grace the Duchess of Rapidryder\n    is very fond of being tossed in a strong table-cloth between four\n    able-bodied gentlemen of good birth and discretion, before going to\n    bed o' nights,--she cannot very well appear on a music-hall stage\n    you know, owing to her exalted rank,--and this is a child-like,\n    pretty and harmless method of managing to show her legs, which she\n    rightly considers, are too shapely to be hidden. Lady Bouncer, whose\n    name I see in your list, always likes to cheat at cards,--I would\n    aid and abet her in her aim if I were you, as if she can only clear\n    her dressmaker's bill by her winnings at Willowsmere, she will bear\n    it in mind, and be a useful social friend to you. The Honourable\n    Miss Fitz-Gander who has a great reputation for virtue, is anxious,\n    for pressing and particular reasons, to marry Lord Noodles,--if you\n    can move on matters between them into a definite engagement of\n    marriage before her lady-mother returns from her duty-visits in\n    Scotland, you will be doing her a good turn, and saving society a\n    scandal. To amuse the men I suggest plenty of shooting, gambling,\n    and unlimited smoking. To entertain the Prince, do little,--for he\n    is clever enough to entertain himself privately with the folly and\n    humbug of those he sees around him, without actually sharing in the\n    petty comedy. He is a keen observer,--and must derive infinite\n    gratification from his constant study of men and manners, which is\n    sufficiently deep and searching to fit him for the occupation of\n    even the throne of England. I say 'even,' for at present, till\n    Time's great hour-glass turns, it is the grandest throne in the\n    world. The Prince reads, understands, and secretly laughs to scorn\n    the table-cloth vagaries of the Duchess of Rapidryder, the humours\n    of my Lady Bouncer and the nervous pruderies of the Honourable Miss\n    Fitz-Gander. And there is nothing he will appreciate so much in his\n    reception as a lack of toadyism, a sincere demeanour, an\n    unostentatious hospitality, a simplicity of speech, and a total\n    absence of affectation. Remember this, and take my advice for what\n    it is worth. Of all the Royalties at present flourishing on this\n    paltry planet, I have the greatest respect for the Prince of Wales,\n    and it is by reason of this very respect that I do not intend, on\n    this occasion at any rate, to thrust myself upon his notice. I shall\n    arrive at Willowsmere when your 'royal' festivities are over. My\n    homage to your fair spouse, the Lady Sibyl, and believe me,\n\n        Yours as long as you desire it\n            Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez.\n\nI laughed over this letter and showed it to my wife, who did not laugh.\nShe read it through with a closeness of attention that somewhat\nsurprised me, and when she laid it down there was a strange look of pain\nin her eyes.\n\n\"How he despises us all!\" she said slowly--\"What scorn underlies his\nwords! Do you not recognise it?\"\n\n\"He was always a cynic,--\" I replied indifferently--\"I never expect him\nto be anything else.\"\n\n\"He seems to know some of the ways of the women who are coming here--\"\nshe went on in the same musing accents; \"It is as if he read their\nthoughts, and perceived their intentions at a distance.\"\n\nHer brows knitted frowningly, and she seemed for some time absorbed in\ngloomy meditation. But I did not pursue the subject,--I was too intent\non my own fussy preparations for the Prince's arrival to care about\nanything else.\n\nAnd, as I have said, Royalty, in the person of one of the most genial of\nmen, came and went through the whole programme devised for his\nentertainment, and then departed again with his usual courteous\nacknowledgments for the hospitality offered and accepted,--leaving us,\nas he generally leaves everybody, charmed with his good-humour and\ncondescension, provided his temper has not been ruffled. When, with his\nexit from the scene, the whole party broke up, leaving my wife and me to\nour own two selves once more, there came a strange silence and\ndesolation over the house that was like the stealthy sense of some\napproaching calamity. Sibyl seemed to feel it as much as I did,--and\nthough we said nothing to each other concerning our mutual sensations, I\ncould see that she was under the same cloud of depression as myself. She\nwent oftener to Lily Cottage, and always from these visits to the\nfair-haired student among the roses, came back, I hopefully fancied in\nsofter mood,--her very voice was gentler,--her eyes more thoughtful and\ntender. One evening she said--\n\n\"I have been thinking, Geoffrey, that perhaps there is some good in life\nafter all, if I could only find it out and _live_ it. But you are the\nlast person to help me in such a matter.\"\n\nI was sitting in an arm-chair near the open window, smoking, and I\nturned my eyes upon her with some astonishment and a touch of\nindignation.\n\n\"What do you mean, Sibyl?\" I asked--\"Surely you know that I have the\ngreatest desire to see you always in your best aspect,--many of your\nideas have been most repugnant to me....\"\n\n\"Stop there!\" she said quickly, her eyes flashing as she spoke--\"My\nideas have been repugnant to you, you say? What have _you_ done, you as\nmy husband, to change those ideas? Have you not the same base passions\nas I?--and do you not give way to them as basely? What have I seen in\nyou from day to day that I should take you as an example? You are\nmaster here, and you rule with all the arrogance wealth can give,--you\neat, drink and sleep,--you entertain your acquaintances simply that you\nmay astonish them by the excess of luxury in which you indulge,--you\nread and smoke, shoot and ride, and there an end,--you are an ordinary,\nnot an exceptional man. Do you trouble to ask what is wrong with\n_me_?--do you try, with the patience of a great love, to set before me\nnobler aims than those I have consciously or unconsciously imbibed?--do\nyou try to lead me, an erring, passionate, misguided woman, into what I\ndream of as the light,--the light of faith and hope which alone gives\npeace?\"\n\nAnd suddenly, burying her head in the pillows of the couch on which she\nleaned, she broke into a fit of smothered weeping.\n\nI drew my cigar from my mouth and stared at her helplessly. It was about\nan hour after dinner, and a warm soft autumnal evening,--I had eaten and\ndrunk well, and I was drowsy and heavy-brained.\n\n\"Dear me!\" I murmured--\"you seem very unreasonable, Sibyl! I suppose you\nare hysterical....\"\n\nShe sprang up from the couch,--her tears dried on her cheeks as though\nby sheer heat of the crimson glow that flushed them, and she laughed\nwildly.\n\n\"Yes, that is it!\" she exclaimed--\"Hysteria!--nothing else! It is\naccountable for everything that moves a woman's nature. A woman has no\nright to have any emotions that cannot be cured by smelling-salts!\nHeart-ache?--pooh!--cut her stay-lace! Despair and a sense of sin and\nmisery?--nonsense!--bathe her temples with vinegar! An uneasy\nconscience?--ah!--for an uneasy conscience there is nothing better than\nsal volatile! Woman is a toy,--a breakable fool's toy;--and when she\n_is_ broken, throw her aside and have done with her,--don't try to piece\ntogether the fragile rubbish!\"\n\nShe ceased abruptly, panting for breath,--and before I could collect my\nthoughts or find any words wherewith to reply, a tall shadow suddenly\ndarkened the embrasure of the window, and a familiar voice enquired--\n\n\"May I, with the privilege of friendship, enter unannounced?\"\n\nI started up.\n\n\"Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez!\" I cried, seizing him by the hand.\n\n\"Nay, Geoffrey, my homage is due here first,\"--he replied, shaking off\nmy grasp, and advancing to Sibyl, who stood perfectly still where she\nhad risen up in her strange passion--\"Lady Sibyl, am I welcome?\"\n\n\"Can you ask it!\" she said, with an enchanting smile, and in a voice\nfrom which all harshness and excitement had fled; \"More than welcome!\"\nHere she gave him both her hands which he respectfully kissed. \"You\ncannot imagine how much I have longed to see you again!\"\n\n\"I must apologise for my sudden appearance, Geoffrey,\"--he then\nobserved, turning to me--\"But as I walked here from the station and came\nup your fine avenue of trees, I was so struck with the loveliness of\nthis place and the exquisite peace of its surroundings, that, knowing my\nway through the grounds, I thought I would just look about and see if\nyou were anywhere within sight before I presented myself at the\nconventional door of entrance. And I was not disappointed,--I found you,\nas I expected, enjoying each other's society!--the happiest and most\nfortunate couple existent,--people whom, out of all the world I should\nbe disposed to envy, if I envied worldly happiness at all, which I do\nnot!\"\n\nI glanced at him quickly;--he met my gaze with a perfectly unembarrassed\nair, and I concluded that he had not overheard Sibyl's sudden\nmelodramatic outburst.\n\n\"Have you dined?\" I asked, with my hand on the bell.\n\n\"Thanks, yes. The town of Leamington provided me with quite a sumptuous\nrepast of bread and cheese and ale. I am tired of luxuries you\nknow,--that is why I find plain fare delicious. You are looking\nwonderfully well, Geoffrey!--shall I offend you if I say you are\ngrowing--yes--positively stout?--with the stoutness befitting a true\ncounty gentleman, who means to be as gouty in the future as his\nrespectable ancestors?\"\n\nI smiled, but not altogether with pleasure; it is never agreeable to be\ncalled 'stout' in the presence of a beautiful woman to whom one has only\nbeen wedded a matter of three months.\n\n\"_You_ have not put on any extra flesh;--\" I said, by way of feeble\nretort.\n\n\"No\"--he admitted, as he disposed his slim elegant figure in an\narm-chair near my own--\"The necessary quantity of flesh is a bore to me\nalways,--extra flesh would be a positive infliction. I should like, as\nthe irreverent though reverend Sidney Smith said, on a hot day, 'to sit\nin my bones,' or rather, to become a spirit of fine essence like\nShakespeare's Ariel, if such things were possible and permissible. How\nadmirably married life agrees with _you_, Lady Sibyl!\"\n\nHis fine eyes rested upon her with apparent admiration,--she flushed\nunder his gaze I saw, and seemed confused.\n\n\"When did you arrive in England?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Yesterday,\"--he answered,--\"I ran over Channel from Honfleur in my\nyacht,--you did not know I had a yacht, did you Tempest?--oh, you must\ncome for a trip in her some day. She is a quick vessel, and the weather\nwas fair.\"\n\n\"Is Amiel with you?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. I left him on board the yacht. I can, as the common people say,\n'valet myself' for a day or two.\"\n\n\"A day or two?\" echoed Sibyl--\"But you surely will not leave us so soon?\nYou promised to make a long visit here.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" and he regarded her steadily, with the same languorous\nadmiration in his eyes--\"But, my dear Lady Sibyl, time alters our ideas,\nand I am not sure whether you and your excellent husband are of the same\nopinion as you were when you started on your wedding-tour. You may not\nwant me now!\"\n\nHe said this with a significance to which I paid no heed whatever.\n\n\"Not want you!\" I exclaimed--\"I shall always want you Lucio,--you are\nthe best friend I ever had, and the only one I care to keep. Believe\nme!--there's my hand upon it!\"\n\nHe looked at me curiously for a minute,--then turned his head towards my\nwife.\n\n\"And what does Lady Sibyl say?\" he asked in a gentle, almost caressing\ntone.\n\n\"Lady Sibyl says,\" she answered with a smile, and the colour coming and\ngoing in her cheeks--\"that she will be proud and glad if you will\nconsider Willowsmere your home as long as you have leisure to make it\nso,--and that she hopes,--though you are reputed to be a hater of\nwomen,--\" here she raised her beautiful eyes and fixed them full upon\nhim--\"you will relent a little in favour of your present ch\u00c3\u00a2telaine!\"\n\nWith these words, and a playful salutation, she passed out of the room\ninto the garden, and stood on the lawn at a little distance from us, her\nwhite robes shimmering in the mellow autumnal twilight,--and Lucio,\nspringing up from his seat, looked after her, clapping his hand down\nheavily on my shoulder.\n\n\"By Heaven!\" he said softly, \"A perfect woman! I should be a churl to\nwithstand her,--or you, my good Geoffrey,\"--and he regarded me\nearnestly--\"I have led a very devil of a life since I saw you\nlast,--it's time I reformed,--upon my soul it is! The peaceful\ncontemplation of virtuous marriage will do me good!--send for my luggage\nto the station, Geoffrey, and make the best of me,--_I've come to\nstay!_\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nA tranquil time now ensued; a time which, though I knew it not, was just\nthat singular pause so frequently observed in nature before a storm, and\nin human life before a crushing calamity. I put aside all troublesome\nand harassing thoughts, and became oblivious of everything save my own\npersonal satisfaction in the renewal of the comradeship between myself\nand Lucio. We walked together, rode together, and passed most of our\ndays in each other's company,--nevertheless though I gave my friend much\nof my closest confidence I never spoke to him of the moral obliquities\nand perversions I had discovered in Sibyl's character,--not out of any\nconsideration for Sibyl, but simply because I knew by instinct what his\nreply would be. He would have no sympathy with my feelings. His keen\nsense of sarcasm would over-rule his friendship, and he would retort\nupon me with the question--What business had I, being imperfect myself,\nto expect perfection in my wife? Like many others of my sex I had the\nnotion that I, as man, could do all I pleased, when I pleased and how I\npleased; I could sink to a level lower than that of the beasts if I\nchose,--but all the same I had the right to demand from my wife the most\nflawless purity to mate with my defilement. I was aware how Lucio would\ntreat this form of arrogant egoism,--and with what mocking laughter he\nwould receive any expression of ideas from me on the subject of morality\nin woman. So I was careful to let no hint of my actual position escape\nme,--and I comported myself on all occasions to Sibyl with special\ntenderness and consideration, though she, I thought, appeared rather to\nresent my playing the part of lover-husband too openly. She was herself,\nin Lucio's presence, strangely erratic of humour, by turns brilliant and\nmournful,--sometimes merry and anon depressed: yet never had she\ndisplayed a more captivating grace and charm of manner. How foolish and\nblind I was all the while!--how dead to any perception of the formation\nand sequence of events! Absorbed in gross material pleasures, I ignored\nall the hidden forces that make the history of an individual life no\nless than of a whole nation, and looked upon each day that dawned almost\nas if it had been my own creation and possession, to waste as I thought\nfit,--never considering that days are but so many white leaflets from\nGod's chronicle of human life, whereon we place our mark, good or bad,\nfor the just and exact summing-up of our thoughts and deeds here after.\nHad any one dared to say this truth to me then, I should have bade him\ngo and preach nonsense to children,--but _now_,--when I recall those\nwhite leaves of days that were unrolled before me fresh and blank with\nevery sunrise, and with which I did nothing save scrawl my own Ego in a\nfoul smudge across each one, I tremble, and inwardly pray that I may\nnever be forced to send back my self-written record! Yet of what use is\nit to pray against eternal Law? It is eternal Law that we shall\nourselves count up our own misdeeds at the final reckoning,--hence it is\nno wonder that many are found who prefer not to believe in a future\nafter death. Rightly do such esteem it better to die utterly, than be\nforced to live again and look back upon the wilful evil they have done!\n\nOctober ripened slowly and almost imperceptibly towards its end, and the\ntrees put on their gorgeous autumnal tints of burning crimson and gold.\nThe weather remained fine and warm, and what the French Canadians\npoetically term the 'Summer of all Saints' gave us bright days and\ncloudless moonlit evenings. The air was so mild that we were always\nable to take our coffee after dinner on the terrace overlooking the lawn\nin front of the drawing-room,--and it was on one of these balmy nights\nthat I was the interested spectator of a strange scene between Lucio and\nMavis Clare,--a scene I should have thought impossible of occurrence had\nI not myself witnessed it. Mavis had dined at Willowsmere; she very\nrarely so honoured us; and there were a few other guests besides. We had\nlingered over the coffee longer than usual, for Mavis had given an extra\ncharm to the conversation by her eloquent vivacity and bright humour,\nand all present were anxious to hear, see and know as much of the\nbrilliant novelist as possible. But when a full golden moon rose in\nmellow splendour over the tree-tops, my wife suggested a stroll in the\ngrounds, and everyone agreeing to the proposal with delight, we\nstarted,--more or less together,--some in couples, some in groups of\nthree or four. After a little desultory rambling however, the party got\nseparated in the rose-gardens and adjacent shrubberies, and I found\nmyself alone. I turned back to the house to get my cigar-case which I\nhad left on a table in the library, and passing out again in another\ndirection I strolled slowly across the grass, smoking as I went, towards\nthe river, the silver gleam of which could clearly be discerned through\nthe fast-thinning foliage overhanging its banks. I had almost reached\nthe path that followed the course of the winding water, when I was\nbrought to a standstill by the sound of voices--one, a man's, low and\npersuasive,--the other a woman's, tender, grave and somewhat tremulous.\nNeither voice could be mistaken; I recognized Lucio's rich penetrating\ntones, and the sweet _vibrante_ accents of Mavis Clare. Out of sheer\nsurprise I paused,--had Lucio fallen in love, I wondered,\nhalf-smiling?--was I about to discover that the supposed 'woman-hater'\nhad been tamed and caught at last? By Mavis too!--little Mavis, who was\nnot beautiful according to accepted standards, but who had something\nmore than beauty to enravish a proud and unbelieving soul,--here, as my\nthoughts ran on, I was conscious of a foolish sense of jealousy,--why\nshould he choose Mavis, I thought, out of all women in the world? Could\nhe not leave her in peace with her dreams, her books and her\nflowers?--safe under the pure, wise, impassive gaze of Pallas Athene,\nwhose cool brows were never fevered by a touch of passion? Something\nmore than curiosity now impelled me to listen, and I cautiously advanced\na step or two towards the shadow of a broad elm where I could see\nwithout being seen. Yes, there was Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,--standing erect with folded\narms, his dark, sad, inscrutable eyes fixed on Mavis, who stood opposite\nto him a few paces off, looking at him in her turn with an expression of\nmingled fascination and fear.\n\n\"I have asked you Mavis Clare,\"--said Lucio slowly--\"to let me serve\nyou. You have genius--a rare quality in a woman,--and I would advance\nyour fortunes. I should not be what I am if I did not try to persuade\nyou to let me help on your career. You are not rich,--I could show you\nhow to become so. You have a great fame--that I grant; but you have many\nenemies and slanderers who are for ever trying to pull you down from the\nthrone you have won. I could bring these to your feet, and make them\nyour slaves. With your intellectual power, your personal grace and gifts\nof temperament, I could, if you would let me guide you, give you such\nfar-reaching influence as no woman has possessed in this century. I am\nno boaster,--I can do what I say and more; and I ask nothing from you in\nreturn except that you should follow my advice implicitly. My advice,\nlet me tell you is not difficult to follow; most people find it easy!\"\n\nHis expression of face, I thought, was very singular as he spoke,--it\nwas so haggard, dreary and woe-begone that one might have imagined he\nwas making some proposal that was particularly repugnant to him, instead\nof offering to perform the benevolent action of helping a hard-working\nliterary woman to achieve greater wealth and distinction. I waited\nexpectantly for Mavis to reply.\n\n\"You are very good, Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,\" she said, after a little pause--\"to\ntake any thought for me at all. I cannot imagine why you should do so;\nfor I am really nothing to you. I have of course heard from Mr Tempest\nof your great wealth and influence, and I have no doubt you mean kindly.\nBut I have never owed anything to any one,--no one has ever helped\nme,--I have helped myself, and still prefer to do so. And really I have\nnothing to wish for,--except--when the time comes--a happy death. It is\ntrue I am not rich,--but then I do not want to be rich. I would not be\nthe possessor of wealth for all the world! To be surrounded with\nsycophants and flatterers,--never to be able to distinguish false\nfriends from true,--to be loved for what you _have_ and not for what you\n_are_!--oh no, it would be misery to me. And I have never craved for\npower,--except perhaps the power to win love. And that I have,--many\npeople love my books, and through my books love me,--I feel their love,\nthough I may never see or know them personally. But I am so conscious of\ntheir sympathy that I love them in return without the necessity of\npersonal acquaintance. They have hearts which respond to _my_\nheart,--that is all the power I care about.\"\n\n\"You forget your numerous enemies!\" said Lucio, still morosely regarding\nher.\n\n\"No, I do not forget them,\"--she returned,--\"But--I forgive them! They\ncan do me no harm. As long as I do not lower myself, no one else can\nlower me. If my own conscience is clear, no reproaches can wound. My\nlife is open to all,--people can see how I live, and what I do. I try to\ndo well,--but if there are those who think I do ill, I am sorry,--and if\nmy faults can be amended I shall be glad to amend them. One must have\nenemies in this world,--that is, if one makes any sort of\nposition,--people without enemies are generally nonentities. All who\nsucceed in winning some little place of independence must expect the\ngrudging enmity of hundreds who cannot find even the smallest foothold,\nand are therefore failures in the battle of life,--I pity these\nsincerely, and when they say or write cruel things of me, I know it is\nonly spleen and disappointment that moves both their tongues and pens,\nand freely pardon them. They cannot hurt or hinder me,--in fact, no one\ncan hurt or hinder me but myself.\"\n\nI heard the trees rustle slightly,--a branch cracked,--and peering\nthrough the leaves, I saw that Lucio had advanced a step closer to where\nMavis stood. A faint smile was on his face, softening it wonderfully and\ngiving an almost supernatural light to his beautiful dark features.\n\n\"Fair philosopher, you are almost a feminine Marcus Aurelius in your\nestimate of men and things!\"--he said; \"But--you are still a woman--and\nthere is one thing lacking to your life of sublime and calm\ncontentment--a thing at whose touch philosophy fails, and wisdom withers\nat its root. Love, Mavis Clare!--lover's love,--devoted love, blindly\npassionate,--this has not been yours as yet to win! No heart beats\nagainst your own,--no tender arms caress you,--you are alone. Men are\nfor the most part afraid of you,--being brute fools themselves, they\nlike their women to be brute fools also,--and they grudge you your keen\nintellect,--your serene independence. Yet which is best?--the adoration\nof a brute fool, or the loneliness pertaining to a spirit aloft on some\nsnowy mountain-peak, with no companions but the stars? Think of it!--the\nyears will pass, and you must needs grow old,--and with the years will\ncome that solitary neglect which makes age bitter. Now, you will\ndoubtless wonder at my words--yet believe me I speak the truth when I\nsay that I can give you love,--not _my_ love, for I love none,--but I\ncan bring to your feet the proudest men in any country of the world as\nsuitors for your hand. You shall have your choice of them, and your own\ntime for choosing,--and whomsoever you love, him you shall wed, ...\nwhy--what is wrong with you that you shrink from me thus?\"\n\nFor she had retreated, and was gazing at him in a kind of horror.\n\n\"You terrify me!\" she faltered,--and as the moonlight fell upon\nher I could see that she was very pale--\"Such promises are\nincredible--impossible! You speak as if you were more than human! I do\nnot understand you, Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez,--you are different to anyone I ever\nmet, and ... and ... something in me stronger than myself warns me\nagainst you. What are you?--why do you talk to me so strangely? Pardon\nme if I seem ungrateful ..., oh, let us go in--it is getting quite late\nI am sure, and I am cold ...\"\n\nShe trembled violently, and caught at the branch of a tree to steady\nherself,--Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez stood immovably still, regarding her with a fixed and\nalmost mournful gaze.\n\n\"You say my life is lonely,\"--she went on reluctantly and with a note of\npathos in her sweet voice--\"and you suggest love and marriage as the\nonly joys that can make a woman happy. You may be right. I do not\npresume to assert that you are wrong. I have many married\nwomen-friends--but I would not change my lot with any one of them. I\nhave dreamed of love,--but because I have not realized my dream I am not\nthe less content. If it is God's will that I should be alone all my\ndays, I shall not murmur, for _my_ solitude is not actual loneliness.\nWork is a good comrade,--then I have books, and flowers and birds--I am\nnever really lonely. And that I shall fully realize my dream of love one\nday I am sure,--if not here, then hereafter. I can wait!\"\n\nAs she spoke, she looked up to the placid heavens where one or two stars\ntwinkled through the arching boughs,--her face expressed angelic\nconfidence and perfect peace,--and Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez advancing a step or two,\nfully confronted her with a strange light of exultation in his eyes.\n\n\"True,--you can wait, Mavis Clare!\" he said in deep clear tones from\nwhich all sadness had fled--\"You can afford to wait! Tell me,--think for\na moment!--can you remember me? Is there a time on which you can look\nback, and looking, see my face, not here but elsewhere? Think! Did you\never see me long ago--in a far sphere of beauty and light, when you were\nan Angel, Mavis,--and I was--not what I am now! How you tremble! You\nneed not fear me,--I would not harm you for a thousand worlds! I talk\nwildly at times I know;--I think of things that are past,--long long\npast,--and I am filled with regrets that burn my soul with fiercer heat\nthan fire! And so neither world's wealth, world's power, nor world's\nlove will tempt you, Mavis!--and you,--a woman! You are a living miracle\nthen,--as miraculous as the drop of undefiled dew which reflects in its\ntiny circumference all the colours of the sky, and sinks into the earth\nsweetly, carrying moisture and refreshment where it falls. I can do\nnothing for you--you will not have my aid--you reject my service? Then\nas I may not help you, you must help _me_!\"--and dropping before her, he\nreverently took her hand and kissed it--\"I ask a very little thing of\nyou,--pray for me! I know you are accustomed to pray, so it will be no\ntrouble to you,--_you_ believe God hears you,--and when I look at you,\n_I_ believe it too. Only a pure woman can make faith possible to man.\nPray for me then, as one who has fallen from his higher and better\nself,--who strives, but who may not attain,--who labours under heavy\npunishment,--who would fain reach Heaven, but who by the curs\u00c3\u00abd will of\nman, and man alone, is kept in Hell! Pray for me, Mavis Clare! promise\nit!--and so shall you lift me a step nearer the glory I have lost!\"\n\nI listened, petrified with amazement. Could this be Lucio?--the mocking,\ncareless, cynical scoffer I knew, as I thought, so well?--was it really\nhe who knelt thus like a repentant sinner, abasing his proud head before\na woman? I saw Mavis release her hand from his, the while she stood\nlooking down upon him in alarm and bewilderment. Presently she spoke in\nsweet yet tremulous accents--\n\n\"Since you desire it so earnestly, I promise,\"--she said--\"I will pray\nthat the strange and bitter sorrow which seems to consume you may be\nremoved from your life----\"\n\n\"Sorrow!\" he echoed, interrupting her and springing to his feet with an\nimpassioned gesture--\"Woman,--genius,--angel, whatever you are, do not\nspeak of _one_ sorrow for me! I have a thousand thousand sorrows!--aye a\nmillion million, that are as little flames about my heart, and as deeply\nseated as the centres of the universe! The foul and filthy crimes of\nmen,--the base deceits and cruelties of women,--the ruthless, murderous\ningratitude of children,--the scorn of good, the martyrdom of intellect,\nthe selfishness, the avarice, the sensuality of human life, the hideous\nblasphemy and sin of the creature to the Creator--these are _my_ endless\nsorrows!--these keep me wretched and in chains, when I would fain be\nfree. These create hell around me, and endless torture,--these bind and\ncrush me and pervert my being till I become what I dare not name to\nmyself, or to others. And yet, ... as the eternal God is my witness, ...\nI do not think I am as bad as the worst man living! I may tempt--but I\ndo not pursue,--I take the lead in many lives, yet I make the way I go\nso plain that those who follow me do so by their own choice and free\nwill more than by my persuasion!\" He paused,--then continued in a softer\ntone--\"You look afraid of me,--but be assured you never had less cause\nfor terror. You have truth and purity--I honour both. You will have none\nof my advice or assistance in the making of your life's\nhistory,--to-night therefore we part, to meet no more on earth. Never\nagain, Mavis Clare!--no, not through all your quiet days of sweet and\ncontented existence will I cross your path,--before Heaven I swear it!\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Mavis gently, approaching him now as she spoke, with a\nsoft grace of movement, and laying her hand on his arm--\"Why do you\nspeak with such a passion of self-reproach? What dark cloud is on your\nmind? Surely you have a noble nature,--and I feel that I have wronged\nyou in my thoughts, ... you must forgive me--I have mistrusted you--\"\n\n\"You do well to mistrust me!\" he answered, and with these words he\ncaught both her hands and held them in his own, looking at her full in\nthe face with eyes that flashed like jewels, \"Your instinct teaches you\nrightly. Would there were many more like you to doubt me and repel me!\nOne word,--if, when I am gone, you ever think of me, think that I am\nmore to be pitied than the veriest paralysed and starving wretch that\never crawled on earth,--for he, perchance, has hope--and I have none.\nAnd when you pray for me--for I hold you to this promise,--pray for one\nwho dares not pray for himself! You know the words, 'Lead us not into\ntemptation but deliver us from evil'? To-night you have been led into\ntemptation, though you knew it not, but you have delivered yourself from\nevil as only a true soul can. And now farewell! In life I shall see you\nno more:--in death,--well! I have attended many death-beds in response\nto the invitations of the moribund,--but I shall not be present at\nyours! Perhaps, when your parting spirit is on the verge between\ndarkness and light, you may know who I was, and am!--and you may thank\nGod with your last breath that we parted to-night--as we do\nnow--forever!\"\n\nHe loosened his grasp of her,--she fell back from him pale and\nterrified,--for there was something now in the dark beauty of his face\nthat was unnatural and appalling. A sombre shadow clouded his\nbrows,--his eyes had gleams in them as of fire,--and a smile was on his\nlips, half tender, half cruel. His strange expression moved even me to a\nsense of fear, and I shivered with sudden cold, though the air was warm\nand balmy. Slowly retreating, Mavis moved away, looking round at him now\nand then as she went, in wistful wonder and alarm,--till in a minute or\ntwo her slight figure in its shimmering silken white robe, had vanished\namong the trees. I lingered, hesitating and uncertain what to do,--then\nfinally determining to get back to the house if possible without being\nnoticed, I made one step, when Lucio's voice, scarcely raised, addressed\nme--\n\n\"Well, eavesdropper! Why did you not come out of the shadow of that\nelm-tree and see the play to a better advantage?\"\n\nSurprised and confused, I advanced, mumbling some unintelligible excuse.\n\n\"You saw a pretty bit of acting here,\" he went on, striking a match and\nlighting a cigar the while he regarded me coolly, his eyes twinkling\nwith their usual mockery--\"you know my theory, that all men and all\nwomen are purchaseable for gold? Well, I wanted to try Mavis Clare. She\nrejected all my advantageous offers, as you must have heard, and I could\nonly make matters smooth by asking her to pray for me. That I did this\nvery melodramatically I hope you will admit? A woman of that dreamy\nidealistic temperament always likes to imagine that there is a man who\nis grateful for her prayers!\"\n\n\"You seemed very much in earnest about it!\" I said, vexed with myself\nthat he had caught me spying.\n\n\"Why, of course!\" he responded, thrusting his arm familiarly through\nmine--\"I had an audience! Two fastidious critics of dramatic art heard\nme rant my rantings,--I had to do my best!\"\n\n\"Two critics?\" I repeated perplexedly.\n\n\"Yes. You on one side,--Lady Sibyl on the other. Lady Sibyl rose, after\nthe custom of fashionable beauties at the opera, before the last scene,\nin order to get home in good time for supper!\"\n\nHe laughed wildly and discordantly, and I felt desperately\nuncomfortable.\n\n\"You must be mistaken Lucio--\" I said--\"That _I_ listened I admit,--and\nit was wrong of me to do so,--but my wife would never condescend ...\"\n\n\"Ah, then it must have been a sylph of the woods that glided out of the\nshadow with a silken train behind her and diamonds in her hair!\" he\nretorted gaily--\"Tut Geoffrey!--don't look so crestfallen. I have done\nwith Mavis Clare, and she with me. I have not been making love to\nher,--I have simply, just to amuse myself, tested her character,--and I\nfind it stronger than I thought. The combat is over. She will never go\nmy way,--nor, I fear, shall I ever go hers!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Lucio,\" I said with some irritation--\"Your disposition\nseems to grow more and more erratic and singular every day!\"\n\n\"Does it not!\" he answered with a droll affectation of interested\nsurprise in himself--\"I am a curious creature altogether! Wealth is mine\nand I care not a jot for it,--power is mine and I loathe its\nresponsibility;--in fact I would rather be anything but what I am! Look\nat the lights of your 'home, sweet home' Geoffrey!\" this he said as we\nemerged from among the trees on to the moonlit lawn, from whence could\nbe seen the shining of the electric lamps in the drawing-room--\"Lady\nSibyl is there,--an enchanting and perfect woman, who lives but to\nwelcome you to her embracing arms! Fortunate man!--who would not envy\nyou! Love!--who would, who could exist without it--save me! Who, in\nEurope at least, would forego the delights of kissing,--(which the\nJapanese by-the-by consider a disgusting habit),--without embraces,--and\nall those other endearments which are supposed to dignify the progress\nof true love! One never tires of these things,--there is no satiety! I\nwish I could love somebody!\"\n\n\"So you can, if you like,\"--I said, with a little uneasy laugh.\n\n\"I cannot. It is not in me. You heard me tell Mavis Clare as much. I\nhave it in my power to make other people fall in love, somewhat after\nthe dexterous fashion practised by match-making mothers,--but for\nmyself, love on this planet is too low a thing--too brief in duration.\nLast night, in a dream,--I have strange dreams at times,--I saw one whom\npossibly I could love,--but she was a Spirit, with eyes more lustrous\nthan the morning, and a form as transparent as flame;--she could sing\nsweetly, and I watched her soaring upward, and listened to her song. It\nwas a wild song, and to many mortal ears meaningless,--it was something\nlike this ...\" and his rich baritone pealed lusciously forth in\nmelodious tune--\n\n          Into the Light,\n          Into the heart of the fire!\n  To the innermost core of the deathless flame\n          I ascend,--I aspire!\n  Under me rolls the whirling Earth\n  With the noise of a myriad wheels that run\n          Ever round and about the sun,--\n  Over me circles the splendid heaven\n  Strewn with the stars of morn and even,\n          And I a queen\n          Of the air serene,\n  Float with my flag-like wings unfurled,\n  Alone--alone--'twixt God and the world!\n\nHere he broke off with a laugh. \"She was a strange Spirit,\"--he\nsaid--\"because she could see nothing but herself ''twixt God and the\nworld.' She was evidently quite unaware of the numerous existing\nbarriers put up by mankind between themselves and their Maker. I wonder\nwhat unenlightened sphere she came from!\"\n\nI looked at him in mingled wonder and impatience.\n\n\"You talk wildly,\"--I said--\"And you sing wildly. Of things that mean\nnothing, and _are_ nothing.\"\n\nHe smiled, lifting his eyes to the moon, now shining her fullest and\nbrightest.\n\n\"True!\" he replied--\"Things which have meaning and are valuable, have\nall to do with money or appetite, Geoffrey! There is no wider outlook\nevidently! But we were speaking of love, and I hold that love should be\neternal as hate. Here you have the substance of my religious creed if I\nhave any,--that there are two spiritual forces ruling the universe--love\nand hate,--and that their incessant quarrel creates the general\nconfusion of life. Both contend one against the other,--and only at\nJudgment-Day will it be proved which is the strongest. I am on the side\nof Hate myself,--for at present Hate has scored all the victories worth\nwinning, while Love has been so often martyred that there is only the\npoor ghost of it left on earth.\"\n\nAt that moment my wife's figure appeared at the drawing-room window, and\nLucio threw away his half-smoked cigar.\n\n\"Your guardian-angel beckons!\" he said, looking at me an odd expression\nof something like pity mingled with disdain,--\"Let us go in.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nThe very next night but one after Lucio's strange interview with Mavis\nClare, the thunderbolt destined to wreck my life and humiliate me to the\ndust, fell with appalling suddenness. No warning given!--it came at a\nmoment when I had dared to deem myself happy. All that day,--the last\nday I was ever to know of pride or self-gratulation,--I had enjoyed life\nto the full; it was a day too in which Sibyl had seemed transformed to a\nsweeter, gentler woman than I had hitherto known her,--when all her\nattractions of beauty and manner were apparently put forth to captivate\nand enthrall me as though she were yet to be wooed and won. Or,--did she\nmean to bewitch and subjugate Lucio? Of this I never thought,--never\ndreamed:--I only saw in my wife an enchantress of the most voluptuous\nand delicate loveliness,--a woman whose very garments seemed to cling to\nher tenderly as though proud of clothing so exquisite a form,--a\ncreature whose every glance was brilliant, whose every smile was a\nravishment,--and whose voice, attuned to the softest and most caressing\ntones appeared in its every utterance to assure me of a deeper and more\nlasting love than I had yet enjoyed. The hours flew by on golden\nwings,--we all three,--Sibyl, myself and Lucio,--had attained, as I\nimagined, to a perfect unity of friendship and mutual understanding,--we\nhad passed that last day together in the outlying woods of Willowsmere,\nunder a gorgeous canopy of autumn leaves, through which the sun shed\nmellow beams of rose and gold,--we had had an _al fresco_ luncheon in\nthe open air,--Lucio had sung for us wild old ballads and love-madrigals\ntill the very foliage had seemed to tremble with joy at the sound of\nsuch entrancing melody,--and not a cloud had marred the perfect peace\nand pleasure of the time. Mavis Clare was not with us,--and I was glad.\nSomehow I felt that of late she had been more or less a discordant\nelement whenever she had joined our party. I admired her,--in a sort of\nfraternal half-patronizing way I even loved her,--nevertheless I was\nconscious that her ways were not as our ways,--her thoughts not as our\nthoughts. I placed the fault on her of course; I concluded that it was\nbecause she had what I elected to call 'literary egoism,' instead of by\nits rightful name, the spirit of honourable independence. I never\nconsidered the inflated quality of my own egoism,--the poor pride of a\n'cash and county' position, which is the pettiest sort of vain-glory\nanyone can indulge in,--and after turning the matter over in my mind, I\ndecided that Mavis was a very charming young woman with great literary\ngifts, and an amazing pride, which made it totally impossible for her to\nassociate with many 'great' people, so-called,--as she would never\ndescend to the necessary level of flunkeyish servility which they\nexpected, and which _I_ certainly demanded. I should almost have been\ninclined to relegate her to 'Grub Street,' had not a faint sense of\njustice as well as shame held me back from doing her that indignity even\nin my thoughts. However I was too much impressed with my own vast\nresources of unlimited wealth, to realize the fact that anyone who, like\nMavis, earns independence by intellectual work and worth alone, is\nentitled to feel a far greater pride than those who by mere chance of\nbirth or heritage become the possessors of millions. Then again, Mavis\nClare's literary position was, though I liked her personally, always a\nkind of reproach to me when I thought of my own abortive efforts to win\nthe laurels of fame. So that on the whole I was glad she did not spend\nthat day with us in the woods;--of course, if I had paid any attention\nto the \"trifles which make up the sum of life\" I should have remembered\nthat Lucio had told her he would \"meet her no more on earth,\"--but I\njudged this to be a mere trifle of hasty and melodramatic speech,\nwithout any intentional meaning.\n\nSo my last twenty-four hours of happiness passed away in halcyon\nserenity,--I felt a sense of deepening pleasure in existence, and I\nbegan to believe that the future had brighter things in store for me\nthan I had lately ventured to expect. Sibyl's new phase of gentleness\nand tenderness towards me, combined with her rare beauty, seemed to\naugur that the misunderstandings between us would be of short duration,\nand that her nature, too early rendered harsh and cynical by a 'society'\neducation would soften in time to that beautiful womanliness which is,\nafter all, woman's best charm. Thus I thought, in blissful and contented\nreverie, reclining under the branching autumnal foliage, with my fair\nwife beside me, and listening to the rich tones of my friend Lucio's\nmagnificent voice pealing forth sonorous, wild melodies, as the sunset\ndeepened in the sky and the twilight shadows fell. Then came the\nnight--the night which dropped only for a few hours over the quiet\nlandscape, but for ever over me!\n\nWe had dined late, and, pleasantly fatigued with our day in the open\nair, had retired early. I had latterly grown a heavy sleeper, and I\nsuppose I must have slumbered some hours, when I was awakened suddenly\nas though by an imperative touch from some unseen hand. I started up in\nmy bed,--the night-lamp was burning dimly, and by its glimmer I saw that\nSibyl was no longer at my side. My heart gave one bound against my ribs\nand then almost stood still--a sense of something unexpected and\ncalamitous chilled my blood. I pushed aside the embroidered silken\nhangings of the bed and peered into the room,--it was empty. Then I rose\nhastily, put on my clothes and went to the door,--it was carefully shut,\nbut not locked as it had been when we retired for the night. I opened it\nwithout the least noise, and looked out into the long passage,--no one\nthere! Immediately opposite the bedroom door there was a winding oak\nstaircase leading down to a broad corridor, which in former times had\nbeen used as a music-room or picture-gallery,--an ancient organ, still\nsweet of tone, occupied one end of it with dull golden pipes towering up\nto the carved and embossed ceiling,--the other end was lit by a large\noriel window like that of a church, filled with rare old stained glass,\nrepresenting in various niches the lives of the saints, the centre\nsubject being the martyrdom of St Stephen. Advancing with soft caution\nto the balustrade overlooking this gallery, I gazed down into it, and\nfor a moment could see nothing on the polished floor but the criss-cross\npatterns made by the moonlight falling through the great window,--but\npresently, as I watched breathlessly, wondering where Sibyl could have\ngone to at this time of night, I saw a dark tall Shadow waver across the\nmoonlit network of lines, and I heard the smothered sound of voices.\nWith my pulses beating furiously, and a sensation of suffocation in my\nthroat,--full of strange thoughts and suspicions which I dared not\ndefine, I crept slowly and stealthily down the stair, till as my foot\ntouched the last step I saw--what nearly struck me to the ground with a\nshock of agony--and I had to draw back and bite my lips hard to repress\nthe cry that nearly escaped them. There,--there before me in the full\nmoonlight, with the colours of the red and blue robes of the painted\nsaints on the window glowing blood-like and azure about her, knelt my\nwife,--arrayed in a diaphanous garment of filmy white which betrayed\nrather than concealed the outline of her form,--her wealth of hair\nfalling about her in wild disorder,--her hands clasped in\nsupplication,--her pale face upturned; and above her towered the dark\nimposing figure of Lucio! I stared at the twain with dry burning\neyes,--what did this portend? Was she--my wife--false? Was he--my\nfriend--a traitor?\n\n\"Patience----patience!----\" I muttered to myself--\"This is a piece of\nacting doubtless----such as chanced the other night with Mavis\nClare!----patience!----let us hear this----this comedy!\" And, drawing\nmyself close up against the wall, I leaned there, scarcely drawing\nbreath, waiting for _her_ voice,--for _his_;--when they spoke I should\nknow,----yes, I should know all! And I fastened my looks on them as\nthey stood there,--vaguely wondering even in my tense anguish, at the\nfearful light on Lucio's face,--a light which could scarcely be the\nreflection of the moon, as he backed the window,--and at the scorn of\nhis frowning brows. What terrific humour swayed him?--why did he, even\nto my stupefied thought appear more than human?--why did his very beauty\nseem hideous at that moment, and his aspect fiendish? Hush--hush! _She_\nspoke,--my wife,--I heard her every word--heard all and endured all,\nwithout falling dead at her feet in the extremity of my dishonour and\ndespair!\n\n\"I love you!\" she wailed--\"Lucio, I love you, and my love is killing me!\nBe merciful!--have pity on my passion!--love me for one hour, one little\nhour!--it is not much to ask, and afterwards,--do with me what you\nwill,--torture me, brand me an outcast in the public sight, curse me\nbefore Heaven--I care nothing--I am yours body and soul--I love you!\"\n\nHer accents vibrated with mad idolatrous pleading,--I listened\ninfuriated, but dumb. \"Hush,--hush!\" I told myself \"This is a\ncomedy--not yet played out!\" And I waited, with every nerve strained,\nfor Lucio's reply. It came, accompanied by a laugh, low and sarcastic.\n\n\"You flatter me!\" he said--\"I regret I am unable to return the\ncompliment!\"\n\nMy heart gave a throb of relief and fierce joy,--almost I could have\njoined in his ironical laughter. She--Sibyl--dragged herself nearer to\nhim.\n\n\"Lucio--Lucio!\" she murmured--\"Have you a heart? Can you reject me when\nI pray to you thus?--when I offer you all myself,--all that I am, or\never hope to be? Am I so repugnant to you? Many men would give their\nlives if I would say to them what I say to you,--but they are nothing to\nme--you alone are my world,--the breath of my existence!--ah, Lucio, can\nyou not believe, will you not realize how deeply I love you!\"\n\nHe turned towards her with a sudden fierce movement that startled\nme,--and the cloud of scorn upon his brows grew darker.\n\n\"I know you love me!\" he said, and from where I stood I saw the cold\nderisive smile flash from his lips to his eyes in lightning-like\nmockery--\"I have always known it! Your vampire soul leaped to mine at\nthe first glance I ever gave you,--you were a false foul thing from the\nfirst, and you recognized your master! Yes--your Master!\" for she had\nuttered a faint cry as if in fear,--and he, stooping, snatched her two\nhands and grasped them hard in his own--\"Listen to the truth of yourself\nfor once from one who is not afraid to speak it!--you love me,--and\ntruly your body and soul are mine to claim, if I so choose! You married\nwith a lie upon your lips; you swore fidelity to your husband before\nGod, with infidelity already in your thoughts, and by your own act made\nthe mystical blessing a blasphemy and a curse! Wonder not then that the\ncurse has fallen! I knew it all!--the kiss I gave you on your\nwedding-day put fire in your blood and sealed you mine!--why, you would\nhave fled to me that very night, had I demanded it,--had I loved you as\nyou love me,--that is, if you choose to call the disease of vanity and\ndesire that riots in your veins, by such a name as love! But now hear\n_me_!\" and as he held her two wrists he looked down upon her with such\nblack wrath depicted in his face as seemed to create a darkness round\nhim where he stood,--\"I hate you! Yes--I hate you, and all such women as\nyou! For you corrupt the world,--you turn good to evil,--you deepen\nfolly into crime,--with the seduction of your nude limbs and lying eyes,\nyou make fools, cowards and beasts of men! When you die, your bodies\ngenerate foulness,--things of the mould and slime are formed out of the\nflesh that was once fair for man's delight,--you are no use in life--you\nbecome poison in death,--I hate you all! I read your soul--it is an open\nbook to me--and it is branded with a name given to those who are\npublicly vile, but which should, of strict right and justice, be equally\nbestowed on women of your position and type, who occupy pride and place\nin this world's standing, and who have not the excuse of poverty for\nselling themselves to the devil!\"\n\nHe ceased abruptly and with passion, making a movement as though to\nfling her from him,--but she clung to his arm,--clung with all the\npertinacity of the loathly insect he had taken from the bosom of the\ndead Egyptian woman and made a toy of to amuse his leisure! And I,\nlooking on and listening, honoured him for his plain speaking, for his\ncourage in telling this shameless creature what she was in the opinion\nof an honest man, without glozing over her outrageous conduct for the\nsake of civility or social observance. My friend,--my more than friend!\nHe was true,--he was loyal--he had neither desire nor intent to betray\nor dishonour me. My heart swelled with gratitude to him, and also with a\ncurious sense of feeble self-pity,--compassionating myself intensely, I\ncould have sobbed aloud in nervous fury and pain, had not my desire to\nhear more, repressed my personal excitement and emotion. I watched my\nwife wonderingly--what had become of her pride that she still knelt\nbefore the man who had taunted her with such words as should have been\nbeyond all endurance?\n\n\"Lucio! ... Lucio!\" she whispered, and her whisper sounded through the\nlong gallery like the hiss of a snake--\"Say what you will--say all you\nwill of me,--you can say nothing that is not true. I am vile--I own it.\nBut is it of much avail to be virtuous? What pleasure comes from\ngoodness?--what gratification from self-denial? There is no God to care!\nA few years, and we all die, and are forgotten even by those who loved\nus,--why should we lose such joys as we may have for the mere asking?\nSurely it is not difficult to love even me for an hour?--am I not fair\nto look upon?--and is all this beauty of my face and form worthless in\nyour sight, and you no more than man? Murder me as you may with all the\ncruelty of cruel words, I care nothing!--I love you--love you!\"--and in\na perfect passion of self-abandonment she sprang to her feet, tossing\nback her rich hair over her shoulders, and stood erect, a very bacchante\nof wild loveliness--\"Look at me! You shall not,--you dare not spurn such\na love as mine!\"\n\nDead silence followed her outburst,--and I stared in fascinated awe at\nLucio as he turned more fully round and confronted her. The expression\nof his countenance struck me then as quite unearthly,--his beautiful\nbroad brows were knitted in a darkling line of menace,--his eyes\nliterally blazed with scorn, and yet he laughed,--a low laugh, resonant\nwith satire.\n\n\"Shall not!--dare not!\" he echoed disdainfully--\"Woman's words,--woman's\nranting!--the shriek of the outraged feminine animal who fails to\nattract, as she thinks, her chosen mate. Such a love as yours!--what is\nit? Degradation to whosoever shall accept it,--shame to whosoever shall\nrely upon it! You make a boast of your beauty; your mirror shows you a\npleasing image,--but your mirror lies!--as admirably as you do! You see\nwithin it not the reflection of yourself, for that would cause you to\nrecoil in horror, ... you merely look upon your fleshly covering, a\ngarment of tissues, shrinkable, perishable, and only fit to mingle with\nthe dust from which it sprang. Your beauty! I see none of it,--I see\nYou! and to me you are hideous, and will remain hideous for ever. I hate\nyou!--I hate you with the bitterness of an immeasurable and unforgiving\nhatred,--for you have done me a wrong,--you have wrought an injury upon\nme,--you have added another burden to the load of punishment I carry!\"\n\nShe made a forward movement with outstretched arms,--he repulsed her by\na fierce gesture.\n\n\"Stand back!\" he said--\"Be afraid of me, as of an unknown Terror! O\npitiless Heaven!--to think of it!--but a night ago I was lifted a step\nnearer to my lost delight!--and now this woman drags me back, and\ndown!--and yet again I hear the barring of the gates of Paradise! O\ninfinite torture! O wicked souls of men and women!--is there no touch of\ngrace or thought of God left in you!--and will ye make my sorrows\neternal!\"\n\nHe stood, lifting his face to the light where it streamed through the\noriel window, and the moonbeams colouring themselves faintly roseate as\nthey filtered through the painted garments of St Stephen, showed a\ngreat and terrible anguish in his eyes. I heard him with amazement and\nawe,--I could not imagine what he meant by his strange words,--and it\nwas evident by her expression, that my reckless and abandoned wife was\nequally mystified.\n\n\"Lucio,\"--she murmured--\"Lucio, ... what is it ... what have I done?--I\nwho would not wound you for the world?--I who but seek your love, Lucio,\nto repay it in full with such fond passion and tenderness as you have\nnever known! For this and this only, I married Geoffrey,--I chose your\nfriend as husband because he was your friend!\" (O perfidious woman!)\n\"and because I saw his foolish egotism--his pride in himself and his\nriches,--his blind confidence in me and in you;--I knew that I could,\nafter a time, follow the fashion of many another woman in my set and\nchoose my lover,--ah, my lover!--I had chosen him already,--I have\nchosen you, Lucio!--yes, though you hate me you cannot hinder me from\nloving you,--I shall love you till I die!\"\n\nHe turned his gaze upon her steadily,--the gloom deepening on his brows.\n\n\"And after you die?\" he said--\"Will you love me then?\"\n\nThere was a stern derision in his tone which appeared to vaguely terrify\nher.\n\n\"After death! ...\" she stammered.\n\n\"Yes,--after death!\" he repeated sombrely--\"There _is_ an after;--as\nyour mother knows!\" A faint exclamation escaped her,--she fixed her eyes\nupon him affrightedly. \"Fair lady,\" he went on--\"your mother was, like\nyourself, a voluptuary. She, like you, made up her mind to 'follow the\nfashion' as you put it, as soon as her husband's 'blind' or willing\nconfidence was gained. She chose, not one lover but many. You know her\nend. In the written but miscomprehended laws of Nature, a diseased body\nis the natural expression of a diseased mind,--her face in her last days\nwas the reflex of her soul. You shudder?--the thought of her\nhideousness is repellent to your self-conscious beauty? Yet the evil\nthat was in her is also in you,--it festers in your blood slowly but\nsurely, and as you have no faith in God to cure the disease, it will\nhave its way--even at the final moment when death clutches at your\nthroat and stops your breathing. The smile upon your frozen lips then\nwill not be the smile of a saint, believe me, but of a sinner! Death is\nnever deceived, though life may be. And afterwards ... I ask again, will\nyou love me, do you think? ... when you know WHO I am?\"\n\nI was myself startled at his manner of putting this strange question;--I\nsaw her lift her hands beseechingly towards him, and she seemed to\ntremble.\n\n\"When I know who you are!\" she repeated wonderingly--\"Do I not know? You\nare Lucio,--Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez--my love,--my love!--whose voice is my\nmusic,--whose beauty I adore,--whose looks are my heaven\" ...\n\n\"And Hell!\" he interposed, with a low laugh--\"Come here!\"\n\nShe went towards him eagerly, yet falteringly. He pointed to the\nground,--I saw the rare blue diamond he always wore on his right hand,\nflash like a flame in the moonrays.\n\n\"Since you love me so well,\"--he said--\"Kneel down and worship me!\"\n\nShe dropped on her knees--and clasped her hands,--I strove to move,--to\nspeak,--but some resistless force held me dumb and motionless;--the\nlight from the stained glass window fell upon her face, and showed its\nfairness illumined by a smile of perfect rapture.\n\n\"With every pulse of my being I worship you!\" she murmured\npassionately--\"My king!--my god! The cruel things you say but deepen my\nlove for you,--you can kill, but you can never change me! For one kiss\nof your lips I would die,--for one embrace from you I would give my\nsoul! ...\"\n\n\"Have you one to give?\" he asked derisively--\"Is it not already disposed\nof? You should make sure of that first! Stay where you are and let me\nlook at you! So!--a woman, wearing a husband's name, holding a\nhusband's honour, clothed in the very garments purchased with a\nhusband's money, and newly risen from a husband's side, steals forth\nthus in the night, seeking to disgrace him and pollute herself by the\nvulgarest unchastity! And this is all that the culture and training of\nnineteenth-century civilization can do for you? Myself, I prefer the\nbarbaric fashion of old times, when rough savages fought for their women\nas they fought for their cattle, treated them as cattle, and kept them\nin their place, never dreaming of endowing them with such strong virtues\nas truth and honour! If women were pure and true, then the lost\nhappiness of the world might return to it,--but the majority of them are\nlike you, liars, ever pretending to be what they are not. I may do what\nI choose with you, you say? torture you, kill you, brand you with the\nname of outcast in the public sight, and curse you before Heaven--if I\nwill only love you!--all this is melodramatic speech, and I never cared\nfor melodrama at any time. I shall neither kill you, brand you, curse\nyou, nor love you;--I shall simply--call your husband!\"\n\nI stirred from my hiding-place,--then stopped. She sprang to her feet in\nan insensate passion of anger and shame.\n\n\"You dare not!\" she panted--\"You dare not so ... disgrace me!\"\n\n\"Disgrace you!\" he echoed scornfully--\"That remark comes rather late,\nseeing you have disgraced yourself!\"\n\nBut she was now fairly roused. All the savagery and obstinacy of her\nnature was awakened, and she stood like some beautiful wild animal at\nbay, trembling from head to foot with the violence of her emotions.\n\n\"You repulse me,--you scorn me!\" she muttered in hurried fierce accents\nthat scarcely rose above an angry whisper--\"You make a mockery of my\nheart's anguish and despair, but you shall suffer for it! I am your\nmatch,--nay your equal! You shall not spurn me a second time! You ask,\nwill I love you when I know who you are,--it is your pleasure to deal in\nmysteries, but I have no mysteries--I am a woman who loves you with all\nthe passion of a life,--and I will murder myself and you, rather than\nlive to know that I have prayed you for your love in vain. Do you think\nI came unprepared?--no!\" and she suddenly drew from her bosom a short\nsteel dagger with a jewelled hilt, a _curio_ I recognized as one of the\ngifts to her on her marriage; \"Love me, I say!--or I will stab myself\ndead here at your feet, and cry out to Geoffrey that you have murdered\nme!\"\n\nShe raised the weapon aloft,--I almost sprang forward--but I drew back\nagain quickly as I saw Lucio seize the hand that held the dagger and\ndrag it firmly down,--while, wresting the weapon from her clutch he\nsnapped it asunder and flung the pieces on the floor.\n\n\"Your place was the stage, Madam!\" he said--\"You should have been the\nchief female mime at some 'high-class' theatre! You would have adorned\nthe boards, drawn the mob, had as many lovers, stagey and private as you\npleased, been invited to act at Windsor, obtained a payment-jewel from\nthe Queen, and written your name in her autograph album. That should\nundoubtedly have been your 'great' career--you were born for it--made\nfor it! You would have been as brute-souled as you are now,--but that\nwould not have mattered,--mimes are exempt from chastity!\"\n\nIn the action of breaking the dagger, and in the intense bitterness of\nhis speech he had thrust her back a few paces from him, and she stood\nbreathless and white with rage, eyeing him in mingled passion and\nterror. For a moment she was silent,--then advancing slowly with the\nfeline suppleness of movement which had given her a reputation for grace\nexceeding that of any woman in England, she said in deliberately\nmeasured accents--\n\n\"Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez, I have borne your insults as I would bear my death at\nyour hands, because I love you. You loathe me, you say--you repulse\nme,--I love you still! You cannot cast me off--I am yours! You shall\nlove me, or I will die,--one of the two. Take time for thought,--I leave\nyou to-night,--I give you all to-morrow to consider,--love me,--give me\nyourself,--be my lover,--and I will play the comedy of social life as\nwell as any other woman,--so well that my husband shall never know. But\nrefuse me again as you have refused me now, and I will make away with\nmyself. I am not 'acting,'--I am speaking calmly and with conviction; I\nmean what I say!\"\n\n\"Do you?\" queried Lucio coldly--\"Let me congratulate you! Few women\nattain to such coherence!\"\n\n\"I will put an end to this life of mine;\" she went on, paying no sort of\nheed to his words--\"I cannot endure existence without your love, Lucio!\"\nand a dreary pathos vibrated in her voice--\"I hunger for the kisses of\nyour lips,--the clasp of your arms! Do you know--do you ever think of\nyour own power?--the cruel, terrible power of your eyes, your speech,\nyour smile,--the beauty which makes you more like an angel than a\nman,--and have you no pity? Do you think that ever a man was born like\nyou?\" he looked at her as she said this, and a faint smile rested on his\nlips--\"When you speak, I hear music--when you sing, it seems to me that\nI understand what the melodies of a poet's heaven must be;--surely,\nsurely you know that your very looks are a snare to the warm weak soul\nof a woman! Lucio!--\" and emboldened by his silence, she stole nearer to\nhim--\"Meet me to-morrow in the lane near the cottage of Mavis Clare....\"\n\nHe started as if he had been stung--but not a word escaped him.\n\n\"I heard all you said to her the other night;\" she continued, advancing\nyet a step closer to his side--\"I followed you,--and I listened. I was\nwell-nigh mad with jealousy--I thought--I feared--you loved her,--but I\nwas wrong. I never do thank God for anything,--but I thanked God that\nnight that I was wrong! She was not made for you--I am! Meet me outside\nher house, where the great white rose-tree is in bloom--gather one,--one\nof those little autumnal roses and give it to me--I shall understand it\nas a signal--a signal that I may come to you to-morrow night and not be\ncursed or repulsed, but loved,--loved!--ah Lucio! promise me!--one\nlittle rose!--the symbol of an hour's love!--then let me die; I shall\nhave had all I ask of life!\"\n\nWith a sudden swift movement, she flung herself upon his breast, and\ncircling her arms about his neck, lifted her face to his. The moonbeams\nshowed me her eyes alit with rapture, her lips trembling with passion,\nher bosom heaving, ... the blood surged up to my brain, and a red mist\nswam before my sight, ... would Lucio yield? Not he!--he loosened her\ndesperate hands from about his throat, and forced her back, holding her\nat arm's length.\n\n\"Woman, false and accurs\u00c3\u00a9d!\" he said in tones that were sonorous and\nterrific--\"You know not what you seek! All that you ask of life shall be\nyours in death!--this is the law,--therefore beware what demands you\nmake lest they be too fully granted! A rose from the cottage of Mavis\nClare?--a rose from the garden of Eden!--they are one and the same to\nme! Not for my gathering or yours! Love and joy? For the unfaithful\nthere is no love,--for the impure there is no joy. Add no more to the\nmeasure of my hatred and vengeance!--Go while there is yet time,--go and\nfront the destiny you have made for yourself--for nothing can alter it!\nAnd as for me, whom you love,--before whom you have knelt in idolatrous\nworship--\" and a low fierce laugh escaped him--\"why,--restrain your\nfeverish desires, fair fiend!--have patience!--we shall meet ere long!\"\n\nI could not bear the scene another moment, and springing from my\nhiding-place, I dragged my wife away from him and flung myself between\nthem.\n\n\"Let me defend you, Lucio, from the pertinacities of this wanton!\" I\ncried with a wild burst of laughter--\"An hour ago I thought she was my\nwife,--I find her nothing but a purchased chattel, who seeks a change of\nmasters!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nFor one instant we all three stood facing each other,--I breathless and\nmad with fury,--Lucio calm and disdainful,--my wife staggering back from\nme, half-swooning with fear. In an access of black rage, I rushed upon\nher and seized her in my arms.\n\n\"I have heard you!\" I said--\"I have seen you! I have watched you kneel\nbefore my true friend, my loyal comrade there, and try your best to make\nhim as vile as yourself! I am that poor fool, your husband,--that blind\negoist whose confidence you sought to win--and to betray! I am the\nunhappy wretch whose surplus of world's cash has bought for him in\nmarriage a shameless courtezan! You dare to talk of love? You profane\nits very name! Good God!--what are such women as you made of? You throw\nyourselves into our arms,--you demand our care--you exact our\nrespect--you tempt our senses--you win our hearts,--and then you make\nfools of us all! Fools, and worse than fools,--you make us men without\nfeeling, conscience, faith, or pity! If we become criminals, what\nwonder! If we do things that shame our sex, is it not because you set us\nthe example? God--God! I, who loved you,--yes, loved you in spite of all\nthat my marriage with you taught me,--I, who would have died to save you\nfrom a shadow of suspicion,--I am the one out of all the world you\nchoose to murder by your treachery!\"\n\nI loosened my grasp of her,--she recovered her self-possession by an\neffort, and looked at me straightly with cold unfeeling eyes.\n\n\"What did you marry me for?\" she demanded--\"For my sake or your own?\"\n\nI was silent,--too choked with wrath and pain to speak. All I could do\nwas to hold out my hand to Lucio, who grasped it with a cordial and\nsympathetic pressure. Yet ... I fancied he smiled!\n\n\"Was it because you desired to make me happy out of pure love for me?\"\npursued Sibyl--\"Or because you wished to add dignity to your own\nposition by wedding the daughter of an Earl? Your motives were not\nunselfish,--you chose me simply because I was the 'beauty' of the day\nwhom London men stared at and talked of,--and because it gave you a\ncertain 'prestige' to have me for your wife, in the same way as it gave\nyou a footing with Royalty to be the owner of the Derby-winner. I told\nyou honestly what I was before our marriage,--it made no effect upon\nyour vanity and egoism. I never loved you,--I could not love you, and I\ntold you so. You have heard, so you say, all that has passed between me\nand Lucio,--therefore you know why I married you. I state it boldly to\nyour face,--it was that I might have your intimate friend for my lover.\nThat you should pretend to be scandalized at this is absurd; it is a\ncommon position of things in France, and is becoming equally common in\nEngland. Morality has always been declared unnecessary for men,--it is\nbecoming equally unnecessary for women!\"\n\nI stared at her, amazed at the glibness of her speech, and the cool\nconvincing manner in which she spoke, after her recent access of passion\nand excitement.\n\n\"You have only to read the 'new' fiction,\"--she went on, a mocking smile\nlighting up her pale face, \"and indeed all 'new' literature generally,\nto be assured that your ideas of domestic virtue are quite out of date.\nBoth men and women are, according to certain accepted writers of the\nday, at equal liberty to love when they will, and where they may.\nPolygamous purity is the 'new' creed! Such love, in fact, so we are\ntaught, constitutes the only 'sacred' union. If you want to alter this\n'movement,' and return to the old-fashioned types of the modest maiden\nand the immaculate matron, you must sentence all the 'new' writers of\nprofitable pruriency to penal servitude for life, and institute a\nGovernment censorship of the modern press. As matters stand, your\nattitude of the outraged husband is not only ridiculous,--it is\nunfashionable. I assure you I do not feel the slightest prick of\nconscience in saying I love Lucio,--any woman might be proud of loving\nhim;--he, however, will not, or cannot love me,--we have had a 'scene,'\nand you have completed the dramatic effect by witnessing it,--there is\nno more to be said or done in the affair. I do not suppose you can\ndivorce me,--but if you can, you may--I shall make no defence.\"\n\nShe turned, as if to go;--I still stared dumbly at her, finding no words\nto cope with her effrontery,--when Lucio's voice, attuned to a grave and\nsoothing suavity, interposed,--\n\n\"This is a very painful and distressing state of things,\"--he said, and\nthe strange half-cynical, half contemptuous smile still rested on his\nlips--\"but I must positively protest against the idea of divorce, not\nonly for her ladyship's sake, but my own. I am entirely innocent in the\nmatter!\"\n\n\"Innocent!\" I exclaimed, grasping him again by the hand; \"You are\nnobility itself, Lucio!--as loyal a friend as ever man had! I thank you\nfor your courage,--for the plain and honest manner in which you have\nspoken. I heard all you said! Nothing was too strong,--nothing could be\ntoo strong to awaken this misguided woman to a sense of her outrageous\nconduct,--her unfaithfulness----\"\n\n\"Pardon me!\" he interrupted delicately--\"The Lady Sibyl can scarcely be\ncalled unfaithful, Geoffrey. She suffers,----from----let us call it, a\nlittle exaltation of nerves! In thought she may be guilty of infidelity,\nbut society does not know that,--and in act she is pure,--pure as the\nnewly-driven snow,--and as the newly-driven snow, will society, itself\nimmaculate, regard her!\"\n\nHis eyes glittered,--I met his chill derisive glance.\n\n\"You think as I do, Lucio!\" I said hoarsely--\"You feel with me, that a\nwife's unchaste thought is as vile as her unchaste act. There is no\nexcuse,--no palliative for such cruel and abominable ingratitude.\nWhy,\"--and my voice rose unconsciously as I turned fiercely again\ntowards Sibyl--\"Did I not free you and your family from the heavy\npressure of poverty and debt? Have I grudged you anything? Are you not\nloaded with jewels?--have you not greater luxuries and liberties than a\nqueen? And do you not owe me at least some duty?\"\n\n\"I owe you nothing!\" she responded boldly--\"I gave you what you paid\nfor,--my beauty and my social position. It was a fair bargain!\"\n\n\"A dear and bitter one!\" I cried.\n\n\"Maybe so. But such as it was, you struck it,--not I. You can end it\nwhen you please,--the law ...\"\n\n\"The law will give you no freedom in such a case,\"--interposed Lucio\nwith a kind of satirical urbanity--\"A judicial separation on the ground\nof incompatibility of temper might be possible certainly--but would not\nthat be a pity? Her ladyship is unfortunate in her tastes,--that is\nall!--she selected me as her _cavaliere servente_, and I refused the\nsituation,--hence there is nothing for it but to forget this unpleasant\nincident, and try to live on a better understanding for the future----\"\n\n\"Do you think\"--said my wife, advancing with her proud head uplifted in\nscorn, the while she pointed at me--\"Do you think I will live with him\nafter what he has seen and heard to-night? What do you take me for?\"\n\n\"For a very charming woman of hasty impulses and unwise\nreasoning,\"--replied Lucio, with an air of sarcastic gallantry--\"Lady\nSibyl, you are illogical,--most of your sex are. You can do no good by\nprolonging this scene,--a most unpleasant and trying one to us poor men.\nYou know how we hate 'scenes'! Let me beg of you to retire! Your duty is\nto your husband; pray heaven he may forget this midnight delirium of\nyours, and set it down to some strange illness rather than to any evil\nintention.\"\n\nFor all answer she came towards him, stretching out her arms in wild\nappeal.\n\n\"Lucio!\" she cried--\"Lucio, my love! Good-night!--Good-bye!\"\n\nI sprang between him and her advancing form.\n\n\"Before my very face!\" I exclaimed--\"O infamous woman! Have you no\nshame?\"\n\n\"None!\" she said, with a wild smile--\"I glory in my love for such a king\nof worth and beauty! Look at him!--and then look at yourself in the\nnearest mirror that reflects so poor and mean a picture of a man! How,\neven in your egoism, could you deem it possible for a woman to love\n_you_ when _he_ was near! Stand out of the light!--you interpose a\nshadow between my god and me!\"\n\nAs she uttered these mad words, her aspect was so strange and unearthly,\nthat out of sheer stupefied wonder, I mechanically did as she bade me,\nand stood aside. She regarded me fixedly.\n\n\"I may as well say good-bye to you also,\"--she observed--\"For I shall\nnever live with you again.\"\n\n\"Nor I with you!\" I said fiercely.\n\n\"Nor I with you--nor I with you!\" she repeated like a child saying a\nlesson--\"Of course not!--if I do not live with you, you cannot live with\nme!\" She laughed discordantly; then turned her beseeching gaze once more\nupon Lucio--\"Good-bye!\" she said.\n\nHe looked at her with a curious fixity, but returned no word in answer.\nHis eyes flashed coldly in the moonlight like sharp steel, and he\nsmiled. She regarded him with such passionate intentness that it seemed\nas though she sought to draw his very soul into herself by the magnetism\nof her glance,--but he stood unmoved, a very statue of fine disdain and\nintellectual self-repression. My scarcely controlled fury broke out\nagain at the sight of her dumb yearning, and I gave vent to a shout of\nscornful laughter.\n\n\"By heaven, a veritable new Venus and reluctant Adonis!\" I cried\ndeliriously--\"A poet should be here to immortalize so touching a scene!\nGo--go!\"--and I motioned her away with a furious gesture--\"Go, if you do\nnot want me to murder you! Go, with the proud consciousness that you\nhave worked all the mischief and ruin that is most dear to the heart of\na woman,--you have spoilt a life and dishonoured a name,--you can do no\nmore,--your feminine triumph is complete! Go!--would to God I might\nnever see your face again!--would to God I had been spared the misery of\nhaving married you!\"\n\nShe paid no attention whatever to my words, but kept her eyes fixed on\nLucio. Retreating slowly, she seemed to feel rather than see her way to\nthe winding stair, and there, turning, she began to ascend. Half way up\nshe paused--looked back and fully confronted us once more,--with a wild\nwicked rapture on her face she kissed her hands to Lucio, smiling like a\nspectral woman in a dream,--then she went onward and upward step by\nstep, till the last white fold of her robe had vanished,--and we\ntwo,--my friend and I,--were alone. Facing one another we stood,\nsilently,--I met his sombre eyes and thought I read an infinite\ncompassion in them!--then,--while I yet looked upon him, something\nseemed to clutch my throat and stop my breathing,--his dark and\nbeautiful countenance appeared to me to grow suddenly lurid as with\nfire,--a coronal of flame seemed to tremble above his brows,--the\nmoonlight glistened blood-red!--a noise was in my ears of mingled\nthunder and music as though the silent organ at the end of the gallery\nwere played by hands invisible;--struggling against these delusive\nsensations, I involuntarily stretched out my hands ...\n\n\"Lucio! ...\" I gasped--\"Lucio ... my friend! I think, ... I am, ...\ndying! My heart is broken!\"\n\nAs I spoke, a great blackness closed over me,--and I fell senseless.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nOh, the blessedness of absolute unconsciousness! It is enough to make\none wish that death were indeed annihilation! Utter oblivion,--complete\ndestruction,--surely this would be a greater mercy to the erring soul of\nman than the terrible God's-gift of Immortality,--the dazzling impress\nof that divine 'Image' of the Creator in which we are all made, and\nwhich we can never obliterate from our beings. I, who have realized to\nthe full the unalterable truth of eternal life,--eternal regeneration\nfor each individual spirit in each individual human creature,--look upon\nthe endless futures through which I am compelled to take my part with\nsomething more like horror than gratitude. For I have wasted my time and\nthrown away priceless opportunities,--and though repentance may retrieve\nthese, the work of retrieval is long and bitter. It is easier to lose a\nglory than to win it; and if I could have died the death that\npositivists hope for at the very moment when I learned the full measure\nof my heart's desolation, surely it would have been well! But my\ntemporary swoon was only too brief,--and when I recovered I found myself\nin Lucio's own apartment, one of the largest and most sumptuously\nfurnished of all the guest-chambers at Willowsmere,--the windows were\nwide open, and the floor was flooded with moonlight. As I shuddered\ncoldly back to life and consciousness, I heard a tinkling sound of tune,\nand opening my eyes wearily I saw Lucio himself seated in the full\nradiance of the moon with a mandoline on his knee from which he was\nsoftly striking delicate impromptu melodies. I was amazed at\nthis,--astounded that while I personally was overwhelmed with a weight\nof woe, _he_ should still be capable of amusing himself. It is a common\nidea with us all that when we ourselves are put out, no one else should\ndare to be merry,--in fact we expect Nature itself to wear a miserable\nface if our own beloved Ego is disturbed by any trouble,--such is the\nextent of our ridiculous self-consciousness. I moved in my chair and\nhalf rose from it,--when Lucio, still thrumming the strings of his\ninstrument _piano pianissimo_, said--\n\n\"Keep still, Geoffrey! You'll be all right in a few minutes. Don't worry\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Worry myself!\" I echoed bitterly--\"Why not say don't kill yourself!\"\n\n\"Because I see no necessity to offer you that advice at present--\" he\nresponded coolly--\"and if there were necessity, I doubt if I should give\nit,--because I consider it better to kill one's self than worry one's\nself. However opinions differ. I want you to take this matter lightly.\"\n\n\"Lightly!--take my own dishonour and disgrace lightly!\" I exclaimed,\nalmost leaping from my chair--\"You ask too much!\"\n\n\"My good fellow, I ask no more than is asked and expected of a hundred\n'society' husbands to-day. Consider!--your wife has been led away from\nher soberer judgment and reasoning by an exalted and hysterical passion\nfor me on account of my looks,--not for myself at all--because she\nreally does not know _Me_,--she only sees me as I appear to be. The love\nof handsome exterior personalities is a common delusion of the fair\nsex--and passes in time like other women's diseases. No actual dishonour\nor disgrace attaches to her or to you,--nothing has been seen, heard, or\ndone, _in public_. This being so, I can't understand what you are making\na fuss about. The great object of social life, you know, is to hide all\nsavage passions and domestic differences from the gaze of the vulgar\ncrowd. You can be as bad as you like in private--only God sees--and\nthat does not matter!\"\n\nHis eyes had a mocking lustre in them,--twanging his mandoline, he sang\nunder his breath,\n\n \"If she be not fair for me\n  What care I how fair she be!\"\n\n\"That is the true spirit, Geoffrey,\"--he went on--\"It sounds flippant to\nyou no doubt in your present tragic frame of mind,--but it is the only\nway to treat women, in marriage or out of it. Before the world and\nsociety, your wife is like C\u00c3\u00a6sar's, above suspicion. Only you and I\n(we will leave God out) have been the witnesses of her attack of\nhysteria ...\"\n\n\"Hysteria, you call it! She loves you!\" I said hotly--\"And she has\nalways loved you. She confessed it,--and you admitted that you always\nknew it!\"\n\n\"I always knew she was hysterical--yes--if that is what you mean;\"--he\nanswered--\"The majority of women have no real feelings, no serious\nemotions--except one--vanity. They do not know what a great love\nmeans,--their chief desire is for conquest,--and failing in this, they\nrun up the gamut of baffled passion to the pitch of frenetic hysteria,\nwhich with some becomes chronic. Lady Sibyl suffers in this way. Now\nlisten to me. I will go off to Paris or Moscow or Berlin at once,--after\nwhat has happened, of course I cannot stay here,--and I give you my word\nI will not intrude myself into your domestic circle again. In a few days\nyou will tide over this rupture, and learn the wisdom of supporting the\ndifferences that occur in matrimony, with composure----\"\n\n\"Impossible! I will not part with you!\" I said vehemently--\"Nor will I\nlive with her! Better the companionship of a true friend than that of a\nfalse wife!\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows with a puzzled half humorous expression--then\nshrugged his shoulders, as one who gives up a difficult argument.\nRising, he put aside his mandoline and came over to me, his tall\nimposing figure casting a gigantic shadow in the brilliant moonbeams.\n\n\"Upon my word, you put me in a very awkward position Geoffrey,--what is\nto be done? You can get a judicial separation if you like, but I think\nit would be an unwise course of procedure after barely four months of\nmarriage. The world would be set talking at once. Really it is better to\ndo anything than give the gossips a chance for floating scandal. Look\nhere--don't decide anything hastily,--come up to town with me for a day,\nand leave your wife alone to meditate upon her foolishness and its\npossible consequences,--then you will be better able to judge as to your\nfuture movements. Go to your room, and sleep till morning.\"\n\n\"Sleep!\" I repeated with a shudder--\"In that room where she----\" I broke\noff with a cry and looked at him imploringly--\"Am I going mad, I wonder!\nMy brain seems on fire! If I could forget! ... if I could forget!\nLucio--if you, my loyal friend, had been false to me I should have\ndied,--your truth, your honour have saved me!\"\n\nHe smiled--an odd, cynical little smile.\n\n\"Tut----I make no boast of virtue\"--he rejoined--\"If the lady's beauty\nhad been any temptation to me I might have yielded to her charms,--in so\ndoing I should have been no more than man, as she herself suggested. But\nperhaps I _am_ more than man!--at anyrate bodily beauty in woman makes\nno sort of effect on me, unless it is accompanied by beauty of\nsoul,--then it does make an effect, and a very extraordinary one. It\nprovokes me to try how deep the beauty goes--whether it is impervious or\nvulnerable. As I find it, so I leave it!\"\n\nI stared wearily at the moonlight patterns on the floor.\n\n\"What am I to do?\" I asked--\"What would you advise?\"\n\n\"Come up to town with me,\"--he replied--\"You can leave a note for your\nwife, explaining your absence,--and at one of the clubs we will talk\nover the matter quietly, and decide how best to avoid a social scandal.\nMeanwhile, go to bed. If you won't go back to your own room, sleep in\nthe spare one next to mine.\"\n\nI rose mechanically and prepared to obey him. He watched me furtively.\n\n\"Will you take a composing draught if I mix it for you?\" he said--\"It is\nharmless, and will give you a few hours' sleep.\"\n\n\"I would take poison from your hand!\" I answered recklessly--\"Why don't\nyou mix _that_ for me?--and then, ... then I should sleep indeed,--and\nforget this horrible night!\"\n\n\"No,--unfortunately you would not forget!\" he said, going to his\ndressing-case and taking out a small white powder which he dissolved\ngradually in a glass of water--\"That is the worst of what people call\ndying. I must instruct you in a little science by-and-by, to distract\nyour thoughts. The scientific part of death,--the business that goes on\nbehind the scenes you know--will interest you very much--it is highly\ninstructive, particularly that section of it which I am entitled to call\nthe regeneration of atoms. The brain-cells are atoms, and within these,\nare other atoms called memories, curiously vital and marvellously\nprolific! Drink this,\"--and he handed me the mixture he had\nprepared--\"For temporary purposes it is much better than death--because\nit does numb and paralyse the conscious atoms for a little while,\nwhereas death only liberates them to a larger and more obstinate\nvitality.\"\n\nI was too self-absorbed to heed or understand his words, but I drank\nwhat he gave me submissively and returned the glass,--he still watched\nme closely for about a minute. Then he opened the door of the apartment\nwhich adjoined his own.\n\n\"Throw yourself on that bed and close your eyes,\"--he continued in\nsomewhat peremptory accents--\"Till morning breaks I give you a\nrespite,--\" and he smiled strangely--\"both from dreams and memories!\nPlunge into Oblivion, my friend!--brief as it is and as it must ever be,\nit is sweet!--even to a millionaire!\"\n\nThe ironical tone of his voice vexed me,--I looked at him half\nreproachfully, and saw his proud beautiful face, pale as marble,\nclear-cut as a cameo, soften as I met his eyes,--I felt he was sorry for\nme despite his love of satire,--and grasping his hand I pressed it\nfervently without offering any other reply. Then, going into the next\nroom as he bade me, I lay down, and falling asleep almost instantly, I\nremembered no more.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nWith the morning came full consciousness; I realized bitterly all that\nhad happened, but I was no longer inclined to bemoan my fate. My senses\nwere stricken, as it seemed, too numb and rigid for any further outbreak\nof passion. A hard callousness took the place of outraged feeling; and\nthough despair was in my heart, my mind was made up to one stern\nresolve,--I would look upon Sibyl no more. Never again should that fair\nface, the deceitful mask of a false nature, tempt my sight and move me\nto pity or forgiveness,--that I determined. Leaving the room in which I\nhad passed the night, I went to my study and wrote the following\nletter;--\n\n    Sibyl.\n\n    After the degrading and disgraceful scene of last night you must be\n    aware that any further intercourse between us is impossible. Prince\n    Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez and I are leaving for London; we shall not return. You can\n    continue to reside at Willowsmere,--the house is yours,--and the\n    half of my fortune unconditionally settled upon you on our\n    marriage-day will enable you to keep up the fashions of your 'set,'\n    and live with that luxury and extravagance you deem necessary to an\n    'aristocratic' position. I have decided to travel,--and I intend to\n    make such arrangements as may prevent, if possible, our ever meeting\n    again,--though I shall of course do my best for my own sake, to\n    avoid any scandal. To reproach you for your conduct would be\n    useless; you are lost to all sense of shame. You have abased\n    yourself in the humiliation of a guilty passion before a man who\n    despises you,--who, in his own loyal and noble nature, hates you for\n    your infidelity and hypocrisy,--and I can find no pardon for the\n    wrong you have thus done to me, and the injury you have brought upon\n    my name. I leave you to the judgment of your own conscience,--if you\n    have one,--which is doubtful. Such women as you, are seldom troubled\n    with remorse. It is not likely you will ever see me or the man to\n    whom you have offered your undesired love again,--make of your life\n    what you can or will, I am indifferent to your movements, and for my\n    own part, shall endeavour as much as may be, to forget that you\n    exist.\n\n        Your husband,\n            Geoffrey Tempest.\n\nThis letter, folded and sealed, I sent to my wife in her own apartments\nby her maid,--the girl came back and said she had delivered it, but that\nthere was no answer. Her ladyship had a severe headache and meant to\nkeep her room that morning. I expressed just as much civil regret as a\nconfidential maid would naturally expect from the newly-wedded husband\nof her mistress,--and then, giving instructions to my man Morris to pack\nmy portmanteau, I partook of a hurried breakfast with Lucio in more or\nless silence and constraint, for the servants were in attendance, and I\ndid not wish them to suspect that anything was wrong. For their benefit,\nI gave out that my friend and I were called suddenly to town on urgent\nbusiness,--that we might be absent a couple of days, perhaps\nlonger,--and that any special message or telegram could be sent on to me\nat Arthur's Club. I was thankful when we at last got away,--when the\ntall, picturesque red gables of Willowsmere vanished from my sight,--and\nwhen finally, seated in a railway smoking-carriage reserved for our two\nselves, we were able to watch the miles of distance gradually extending\nbetween us and the beautiful autumnal woods of poet-haunted\nWarwickshire. For a long time we kept silence, turning over and\npretending to read the morning's papers,--till presently flinging down\nthe dull and wearisome 'Times' sheet, I sighed heavily, and leaning\nback, closed my eyes.\n\n\"I am truly very much distressed about all this;\" said Lucio then, with\nextreme gentleness and suavity--\"It seems to me that _I_ am the adverse\nelement in the affair. If Lady Sibyl had never seen _me_,----\"\n\n\"Why, then I should never have seen _her_!\" I responded bitterly--\"It\nwas through you I met her first.\"\n\n\"True!\" and he eyed me thoughtfully--\"I am very unfortunately\nplaced!--it is almost as if I were to blame, though no-one could be more\ninnocent or well-intentioned than myself!\" He smiled,--then went on very\ngravely--\"I really should avoid scandalous gossip if I were you,--I do\nnot speak of my own involuntary share in the disaster,--what people say\nof me is quite immaterial; but for the lady's sake----\"\n\n\"For my own sake I shall try to avoid it;\" I said brusquely, whereat his\neyes glittered strangely--\"It is myself I have to consider most of all.\nI shall, as I hinted to you this morning, travel for a few years.\"\n\n\"Yes,--go on a tiger-hunting expedition in India,\"--he suggested--\"Or\nkill elephants in Africa. It is what a great many men do when their\nwives forget themselves. Several well-known husbands are abroad just\nnow!\"\n\nAgain the brilliant enigmatical smile flashed over his face,--but I\ncould not smile in answer. I stared moodily out of the window at the\nbare autumnal fields, past which the train flew,--bare of\nharvest,--stripped of foliage--like my own miserable life.\n\n\"Come and winter with me in Egypt,\"--he continued--\"Come in my yacht\n'The Flame,'--we will take her to Alexandria,--and then do the Nile in a\ndahabeah, and forget that such frivolous dolls as women exist except to\nbe played with by us 'superior' creatures and thrown aside.\"\n\n\"Egypt----the Nile!\" I murmured,--somehow the idea pleased\nme--\"Yes,----why not?\"\n\n\"Why not indeed!\" he echoed--\"The proposal is agreeable to you I am\nsure. Come and see the land of the old gods,--the land where my princess\nused to live and torture the souls of men!--perhaps we may discover the\nremains of her last victim,----who knows!\"\n\nI avoided his gaze;--the recollection of the horrible winged thing he\npersisted in imagining to be the transmigrated soul of an evil woman,\nwas repugnant to me. Almost I felt as if there were some subtle\nconnection between that hateful creature and my wife Sibyl. I was glad\nwhen the train reached London, and we, taking a hansom, were plunged\ninto the very vortex of human life. The perpetual noise of traffic,\nthe motley crowds of people, the shouting of news-boys and\nomnibus-conductors,--all this hubbub was grateful to my ears, and for a\ntime at least, distracted my thoughts. We lunched at the Savoy, and\namused ourselves with noting the town noodles of fashion,--the inane\nyoung man in the stocks of the stiff high collar, and wearing the\nmanacles of equally stiff and exaggerated cuffs, a veritable prisoner in\nthe dock of silly custom,--the frivolous fool of a woman, painted and\npowdered, with false hair and dyed eyebrows, trying to look as much like\na paid courtezan as possible,--the elderly matron, skipping forward on\nhigh heels, and attempting by the assumption of juvenile airs and graces\nto cover up and conceal the obtrusive facts of a too obvious paunch and\noverlapping bosom,--the would-be dandy and 'beau' of seventy, strangely\npossessed by youthful desires, and manifesting the same by goat-like\ncaperings at the heels of young married women;--these and such-like\ncontemptible units of a contemptible social swarm, passed before us like\npuppets at a country fair, and aroused us in turn to laughter or\ndisdain. While we yet lingered over our wine, a man came in alone, and\nsat down at the table next to ours;--he had with him a book, which,\nafter giving his orders for luncheon, he at once opened at a marked\nplace and began to read with absorbed attention,--I recognised the\ncover of the volume and knew it to be Mavis Clare's \"Differences.\" A\nhaze floated before my sight,--a sensation of rising tears was in my\nthroat,--I saw the fair face, earnest eyes, and sweet smile of\nMavis,--that woman-wearer of the laurel-crown,--that keeper of the\nlilies of purity and peace. Alas, those lilies!--they were for me\n\n                      \"des fleurs \u00c3\u00a9tranges,[3]\n  Avec leurs airs de sceptres d'anges;\n  De thyrses lumineux pour doigts de s\u00c3\u00a9raphins,--\n  Leurs parfums sont trop forts, tout ensemble, et trop fins!\"\n\nI shaded my eyes with one hand,--yet under that shade I felt that Lucio\nwatched me closely. Presently he spoke softly, just as if he had read my\nthoughts.\n\n\"Considering the effect a perfectly innocent woman has on the mind of\neven an evil man, it's strange, isn't it that there are so few of them!\"\n\nI did not answer.\n\n\"In the present day,\" he went on--\"there are a number of females\nclamouring like unnatural hens in a barn-yard about their 'rights' and\n'wrongs.' Their greatest right, their highest privilege, is to guide and\nguard the souls of men. This, they for the most part, throw away as\nworthless. Aristocratic women, royal women even, hand over the care of\ntheir children to hired attendants and inferiors, and then are surprised\nand injured if those children turn out to be either fools or\nblackguards. If I were controller of the State, I would make it a law\nthat every mother should be bound to nurse and guard her children\nherself as nature intended, unless prevented by ill-health, in which\ncase she would have to get a couple of doctor's certificates to certify\nthe fact. Otherwise, any woman refusing to comply with the law should be\nsentenced to imprisonment with hard labour. This would bring them to\ntheir senses. The idleness, wickedness, extravagance and selfishness of\nwomen, make men the boors and egotists they are.\"\n\nI looked up.\n\n\"The devil is in the whole business;\"--I said bitterly--\"If women were\ngood, men would have nothing to do with them. Look round you at what is\ncalled 'society'! How many men there are who deliberately choose tainted\nwomen for their wives, and leave the innocent uncared for! Take Mavis\nClare----\"\n\n\"Oh, you were thinking of Mavis Clare, were you?\" he rejoined, with a\nquick glance at me--\"But she would be a difficult prize for any man to\nwin. She does not seek to be married,--and she is not uncared for, since\nthe whole world cares for her.\"\n\n\"That is a sort of impersonal love;\"--I answered--\"It does not give her\nthe protection such a woman needs, and ought to obtain.\"\n\n\"Do you want to become her lover?\" he asked with a slight smile--\"I'm\nafraid you've no chance!\"\n\n\"I! Her lover! Good God!\" I exclaimed, the blood rushing hotly to my\nface at the mere suggestion--\"What a profane idea!\"\n\n\"You are right,--it _is_ profane;\"--he agreed, still smiling--\"It is as\nthough I should propose your stealing the sacramental cup from a church,\nwith just this difference,--you might succeed in running off with the\ncup because it is only the church's property, but you would never\nsucceed in winning Mavis Clare, inasmuch as she belongs to God. You know\nwhat Milton says:\n\n 'So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity\n  That when a soul is found sincerely so,\n  A thousand liveried angels lacquey her,\n  Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,\n  And in clear dream and solemn vision\n  Tell her of things which no gross ear can hear,\n  Till oft converse with heavenly habitants\n  Begin to cast a beam on th'outward shape\n  The unpolluted temple of the mind,\n  And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence\n  Till all be made immortal!'\n\nHe quoted the lines softly and with an exquisite gravity.\n\n\"That is what you see in Mavis Clare,\"--he continued--\"that 'beam on the\noutward shape' which 'turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,'--and\nwhich makes her beautiful, without what is called beauty by lustful\nmen.\"\n\nI moved impatiently, and looked out from the window near which we were\nseated, at the yellow width of the flowing Thames below.\n\n\"Beauty, according to man's ordinary standard,\" pursued Lucio, \"means\nsimply good flesh,--nothing more. Flesh, arranged prettily and roundly\non the always ugly skeleton beneath,--flesh, daintily coloured and soft\nto the touch, without scar or blemish. Plenty of it too, disposed in the\nproper places. It is the most perishable sort of commodity,--an illness\nspoils it,--a trying climate ruins it,--age wrinkles it,--death destroys\nit,--but it is all the majority of men look for in their bargains with\nthe fair sex. The most utter _rou\u00c3\u00a9_ of sixty that ever trotted jauntily\ndown Piccadilly pretending to be thirty, expects like Shylock his\n'pound' or several pounds of youthful flesh. The desire is neither\nrefined nor intellectual, but there it is,--and it is solely on this\naccount that the 'ladies' of the music-hall become the tainted members\nand future mothers of the aristocracy.\"\n\n\"It does not need the ladies of the music-hall to taint the already\ntainted!\" I said.\n\n\"True!\" and he looked at me with kindly commiseration--\"Let us put the\nwhole mischief down to the 'new' fiction!\"\n\nWe rose then, having finished luncheon, and leaving the Savoy we went on\nto Arthur's. Here we sat down in a quiet corner and began to talk of our\nfuture plans. It took me very little time to make up my mind,--all\nquarters of the world were the same to me, and I was really indifferent\nas to where I went. Yet there is always something suggestive and\nfascinating about the idea of a first visit to Egypt, and I willingly\nagreed to accompany Lucio thither, and remain the winter.\n\n\"We will avoid society\"--he said--\"The well-bred, well-educated\n'swagger' people who throw champagne-bottles at the Sphinx, and think a\ndonkey-race 'ripping fun' shall not have the honour of our company.\nCairo is full of such dancing dolls, so we will not stay there. Old Nile\nhas many attractions; and lazy luxury on a dahabeah will soothe your\noverwrought nerves. I suggest our leaving England within a week.\"\n\nI consented,--and while he went over to a table and wrote some letters\nin preparation for our journey, I looked through the day's papers. There\nwas nothing to read in them,--for though all the world's news palpitates\ninto Great Britain on obediently throbbing electric wires, each editor\nof each little pennyworth, being jealous of every other editor of every\nother pennyworth, only admits into his columns exactly what suits his\npolitics or personally pleases his taste, and the interests of the\npublic at large are scarcely considered. Poor, bamboozled, patient\npublic!--no wonder it is beginning to think that a halfpenny spent on a\nnewspaper which is only purchased to be thrown away, enough and more\nthan enough. I was still glancing up and down the tedious columns of the\nAmericanized Pall Mall Gazette, and Lucio was still writing, when a\npage-boy entered with a telegram.\n\n\"Mr Tempest?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" And I snatched the yellow-covered missive and tore it open,--and\nread the few words it contained almost uncomprehendingly. They ran\nthus--\n\n    \"Return at once. Something alarming has happened. Afraid to act\n    without you. Mavis Clare.\"\n\nA curious chill came over me,--the telegram fell from my hands on the\ntable. Lucio took it up and glanced at it. Then, regarding me\nstedfastly, he said--\n\n\"Of course you must go. You can catch the four-forty train if you take a\nhansom.\"\n\n\"And you?\" I muttered. My throat was dry and I could scarcely speak.\n\n\"I'll stay at the Grand, and wait for news. Don't delay a moment,--Miss\nClare would not have taken it upon herself to send this message, unless\nthere had been serious cause.\"\n\n\"What do you think--what do you suppose----\" I began.\n\nHe stopped me by a slight imperative gesture.\n\n\"I think nothing--I suppose nothing. I only urge you to start\nimmediately. Come!\"\n\nAnd almost before I realized it, he had taken me with him out into the\nhall of the club, where he helped me on with my coat, gave me my hat,\nand sent for a cab to take me to the railway station. We scarcely\nexchanged farewells,--stupefied with the suddenness of the unexpected\nsummons back to the home I had left in the morning, as I thought, for\never, I hardly knew what I was doing or where I was going, till I found\nmyself alone in the train, returning to Warwickshire as fast as steam\nwould bear me, with the gloom of the deepening dusk around me, and such\na fear and horror at my heart as I dared not think of or define. What\nwas the 'something alarming' that had happened? How was it that Mavis\nClare had telegraphed to me? These, and endless other questions\ntormented my brain,--and I was afraid to suggest answers to any of them.\nWhen I arrived at the familiar station, there was no one waiting to\nreceive me, so I hired a fly, and was driven up to my own house just as\nthe short evening deepened into night. A low autumnal wind was sighing\nrestlessly among the trees like a wandering soul in torment; not a star\nshone in the black depths of the sky. Directly the carriage stopped, a\nslim figure in white came out under the porch to meet me,--it was Mavis,\nher angel's face grave and pale with emotion.\n\n\"It is you at last!\" she said in a trembling voice----\"Thank God you\nhave come!\"\n\n\n  [3] _Edmond Rostand._ '_La Princesse Lointaine._'\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nI grasped her hands hard.\n\n\"What is it?\"--I began;--then, looking round I saw that the hall was\nfull of panic-stricken servants, some of whom came forward, confusedly\nmurmuring together about being 'afraid,' and 'not knowing what to do.' I\nmotioned them back by a gesture and turned again to Mavis Clare.\n\n\"Tell me,--quick--what is wrong?\"\n\n\"We fear something has happened to Lady Sibyl,\"--she replied at\nonce--\"Her rooms are locked, and we cannot make her hear. Her maid got\nalarmed, and ran over to my house to ask me what was best to be done,--I\ncame at once, and knocked and called, but could get no response. You\nknow the windows are too high to reach from the ground,--there is no\nladder on the premises long enough for the purpose,--and no one can\nclimb up that side of the building. I begged some of the servants to\nbreak open the door by force,--but they would not,--they were all\nafraid; and I did not like to act on my own responsibility, so I\ntelegraphed for you----\"\n\nI sprang away from her before she had finished speaking and hurried\nupstairs at once,--outside the door of the ante-room which led into my\nwife's luxurious 'suite' of apartments, I paused breathless.\n\n\"Sibyl!\" I cried.\n\nThere was not a sound. Mavis had followed me, and stood by my side,\ntrembling a little. Two or three of the servants had also crept up the\nstairs, and were clinging to the banisters, listening nervously.\n\n\"Sibyl!\" I called again. Still absolute silence. I turned round upon the\nwaiting and anxious domestics with an assumption of calmness.\n\n\"Lady Sibyl is probably not in her rooms at all;\"--I said; \"She may have\ngone out unobserved. This door of the ante-chamber has a\nspring-lock,--it can easily get fast shut by the merest accident. Bring\na strong hammer,--or a crowbar,--anything that will break it open,--if\nyou had had sense you would have obeyed Miss Clare, and done this a\ncouple of hours ago.\"\n\nAnd I waited with enforced composure, while my instructions were carried\nout as rapidly as possible. Two of the men-servants appeared with the\nnecessary tools, and very soon the house resounded with clamour,--blow\nafter blow was dealt upon the solid oaken door for some time without\nsuccess,--the spring lock would not yield,--neither would the strong\nhinges give way. Presently however, after ten minutes' hard labour, one\nof the finely carved panels was smashed in,--then another,--and,\nspringing over the d\u00c3\u00a9bris I rushed through the ante-room into the\nboudoir,--then paused, listening, and calling again, \"Sibyl!\" No one\nfollowed me,--some indefinable instinct, some nameless dread, held the\nservants back, and Mavis Clare as well. I was alone, ... and in complete\ndarkness. Groping about, with my heart beating furiously, I sought for\nthe ivory button in the wall which would, at pressure, flood the rooms\nwith electric light, but somehow I could not find it. My hand came in\ncontact with various familiar things which I recognised by touch,--rare\nbits of china, bronzes, vases, pictures,--costly trifles that were\nheaped up as I knew, in this particular apartment with a lavish luxury\nand disregard of cost befitting a wanton eastern empress of old\ntime,--cautiously feeling my way along, I started with terror to see, as\nI thought, a tall figure outline itself suddenly against the\ndarkness,--white, spectral and luminous,--a figure that, as I stared at\nit aghast, raised a pallid hand and pointed me forward with a menacing\nair of scorn! In my dazed horror at this apparition, or delusion, I\nstumbled over the heavy trailing folds of a velvet _porti\u00c3\u00a9re_, and knew\nby this that I had passed from the boudoir into the adjoining bedroom.\nAgain I stopped,--calling \"Sibyl!\" but my voice had scarcely strength\nenough to raise itself above a whisper. Giddy and confused as I was, I\nremembered that the electric light in this room was fixed at the side of\nthe toilet-table, and I stepped hurriedly in that direction, when all at\nonce in the thick gloom I touched something clammy and cold like dead\nflesh, and brushed against a garment that exhaled faint perfume, and\nrustled at my touch with a silken sound. This alarmed me more thoroughly\nthan the spectre I fancied I had just seen,--I drew back shudderingly\nagainst the wall,--and in so doing, my fingers involuntarily closed on\nthe polished ivory stud which, like a fairy talisman in modern\ncivilization, emits radiance at the owner's will. I pressed it\nnervously,--the light blazed forth through the rose-tinted shells which\nshaded its dazzling clearness, and showed me where I stood, ... within\nan arm's length of a strange, stiff white creature that sat staring at\nitself in the silver-framed mirror with wide-open, fixed and glassy\neyes!\n\n\"Sibyl!\" I gasped--\"My wife ... ! ...\" but the words died chokingly in my\nthroat. Was it indeed my wife?--this frozen statue of a woman, watching\nher own impassive image thus intently? I looked upon her\nwonderingly,--doubtingly,--as if she were some stranger;--it took me\ntime to recognize her features, and the bronze-gold darkness of her long\nhair which fell loosely about her in a lavish wealth of rippling waves,\n... her left hand hung limply over the arm of the chair in which, like\nsome carven ivory goddess, she sat enthroned,--and tremblingly, slowly,\nreluctantly, I advanced and took that hand. Cold as ice it lay in my\npalm much as though it were a waxen model of itself;--it glittered with\njewels,--and I studied every ring upon it with a curious, dull\npertinacity, like one who seeks a clue to identity. That large turquoise\nin a diamond setting was a marriage-gift from a duchess,--that opal her\nfather gave her,--the lustrous circle of sapphires and brilliants\nsurmounting her wedding-ring was my gift,--that ruby I seemed to\nknow,----well, well! what a mass of sparkling value wasted on such\nfragile clay! I peered into her face,--then at the reflection of that\nface in the mirror,--and again I grew perplexed,--was it, could it be\nSibyl after all? Sibyl was beautiful,--_this_ dead thing had a devilish\nsmile on its blue, parted lips, and frenzied horror in its eyes!\nSuddenly something tense in my brain seemed to snap and give\nway,--dropping the chill fingers I held, I cried aloud--\n\n\"Mavis! Mavis Clare!\"\n\nIn a moment she was with me,--in a glance she comprehended all. Falling\non her knees by the dead woman she broke into a passion of weeping.\n\n\"Oh, poor girl!\" she cried--\"Oh, poor, unhappy, misguided girl!\"\n\nI stared at her gloomily. It seemed to me very strange that she should\nweep for sorrows not her own. There was a fire in my brain,--a confused\ntrouble in my thoughts,--I looked at my dead wife with her fixed gaze\nand evil smile, sitting rigidly upright, and robed in the mocking sheen\nof her rose-silk peignoir, showered with old lace, after the costliest\nof Paris fashions,--then at the living, tender-souled, earnest creature,\nfamed for her genius throughout the world, who knelt on the ground,\nsobbing over the stiffening hand on which so many rare gems glistened\nderisively,--and an impulse rose in me stronger than myself, moving me\nto wild and clamorous speech.\n\n\"Get up, Mavis!\" I cried--\"Do not kneel there! Go,--go out of this\nroom,--out of my sight! You do not know what she was--this woman whom I\nmarried,--I deemed her an angel, but she was a fiend,--yes, Mavis, a\nfiend! Look at her, staring at her own image in the glass,--you cannot\ncall her beautiful--_now_! She smiles, you see,--just as she smiled last\nnight when, ... ah, you know nothing of last night! I tell you, go!\" and\nI stamped my foot almost furiously,--\"This air is contaminated,--it\nwill poison you! The perfume of Paris and the effluvia of death\nintermingled are sufficient to breed a pestilence! Go quickly,--inform\nthe household their mistress is dead,--have the blinds drawn down,--show\nall the exterior signs of decent and fashionable woe!\"--and I began\nlaughing deliriously--\"Tell the servants they may count upon expensive\nmourning,--for all that money can do shall be done in homage to King\nDeath! Let everyone in the place eat and drink as much as they can or\nwill,--and sleep, or chatter as such menials love to do, of hearses,\ngraves and sudden disasters;--but let _me_ be left alone,--alone with\n_her_;--we have much to say to one another!\"\n\nWhite and trembling, Mavis rose up and stood gazing at me in fear and\npity.\n\n\"Alone? ...\" she faltered--\"You are not fit to be alone!\"\n\n\"No, I am not fit to be, but I must be,\"--I rejoined quickly and\nharshly--\"This woman and I loved--after the manner of brutes, and were\nwedded or rather mated in a similar manner, though an archbishop blessed\nthe pairing, and called upon Heaven to witness its sanctity! Yet we\nparted ill friends,--and dead though she is, I choose to pass the night\nwith her,--I shall learn much knowledge from her silence! To-morrow the\ngrave and the servants of the grave may claim her, but to-night she is\nmine!\"\n\nThe girl's sweet eyes brimmed over with tears.\n\n\"Oh you are too distracted to know what you are saying,\" she\nmurmured--\"You do not even try to discover how she died!\"\n\n\"That is easy enough to guess,\"--I answered quickly, and I took up a\nsmall dark-coloured bottle labelled 'Poison' which I had already\nperceived on the toilet-table--\"This is uncorked and empty. What it\ncontained I do not know,--but there must be an inquest of\ncourse,--people must be allowed to make money for themselves out of her\nladyship's rash act! And see there,--\" here I pointed to some loose\nsheets of note-paper covered with writing, and partially concealed by a\nfilmy lace handkerchief which had evidently been hastily thrown across\nthem, and a pen and inkstand close by--\"There is some admirable reading\nprepared for me doubtless!--the last message from the beloved dead is\nsacred, Mavis Clare; surely you, a writer of tender romances, can\nrealize this!--and realizing it, you will do as I ask you,--leave me!\"\n\nShe looked at me in deep compassion, and slowly turned to go.\n\n\"God help you!\" she said sobbingly--\"God console you!\"\n\nAt this, some demon in me broke loose, and springing to her side I\ncaught her hands in mine.\n\n\"Do not dare to talk of God!\" I said in passionate accents; \"Not in this\nroom,--not in _that_ presence! Why should you call curses down upon me?\nThe help of God means punishment,--the consolations of God are terrible!\nFor strength must acknowledge itself weak before He will help it,--and a\nheart must be broken before He will console it! But what do I say!--I\nbelieve in _no_ God--! I believe in an unknown Force that encompasses me\nand hunts me down to the grave, but nothing more. _She_ thought as I\ndo,--and with reason,--for what has God done for her? She was made evil\nfrom the first,--a born snare of Satan....\"\n\nSomething caught my breath here,--I stopped, unable to utter another\nword. Mavis stared at me affrighted, and I stared back again.\n\n\"What is it?\" she whispered alarmedly. I struggled to speak,--finally,\nwith difficulty I answered her--\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\nAnd I motioned her away with a gesture of entreaty. The expression of my\nface must have startled or intimidated her I fancy, for she retreated\nhastily and I watched her disappearing as if she were the phantom of a\ndream,--then, as she passed out through the boudoir, I drew close the\nvelvet porti\u00c3\u00a9re behind her and locked the intermediate door. This done I\nwent slowly back to the side of my dead wife.\n\n\"Now Sibyl,\"--I said aloud--\"we are alone, you and I--alone with our own\nreflected images,--you dead, and I living! You have no terrors for me in\nyour present condition,--your beauty has gone. Your smile, your eyes,\nyour touch cannot stir me to a throb of the passion you craved, yet\nwearied of! What have you to say to me?--I have heard that the dead can\nspeak at times,--and you owe me reparation,--reparation for the wrong\nyou did me,--the lie on which you based our marriage,--the guilt you\ncherished in your heart! Shall I read your petition for forgiveness\nhere?\"\n\nAnd I gathered up the written sheets of note-paper in one hand, feeling\nthem rather than seeing them, for my eyes were fixed on the pallid\ncorpse in its rose-silk 'neglig\u00c3\u00a9e' and jewels, that gazed at itself so\npertinaciously in the shining mirror. I drew a chair close to it, and\nsat down, observing likewise the reflection of my own haggard face in\nthe glass beside that of the self-murdered woman. Turning presently, I\nbegan to scrutinize my immovable companion more closely--and perceived\nthat she was very lightly clothed,--under the silk peignoir there was\nonly a flowing white garment of soft fine material lavishly embroidered,\nthrough which the statuesque contour of her rigid limbs could be\ndistinctly seen. Stooping, I felt her heart,--I knew it was pulseless;\nyet I half imagined I should feel its beat. As I withdrew my hand,\nsomething scaly and glistening caught my eye, and looking I perceived\nLucio's marriage-gift circling her waist,--the flexible emerald snake\nwith its diamond crest and ruby eyes. It fascinated me,----coiled round\nthat dead body it seemed alive and sentient,--if it had lifted its\nglittering head and hissed at me I should scarcely have been surprised.\nI sat back for a moment in my chair, almost as rigid as the corpse\nbeside me,--I stared again, as the corpse stared always, into the mirror\nwhich pictured us both, we 'twain in one,' as the sentimentalists aver\nof wedded folk, though in truth it often happens that there are no two\ncreatures in the world more widely separated than husband and wife. I\nheard stealthy movements and suppressed whisperings in the passage\noutside, and guessed that some of the servants were there watching and\nwaiting,--but I cared nothing for that. I was absorbed in the ghastly\nnight interview I had planned for myself, and I so entered into the\nspirit of the thing, that I turned on all the electric lamps in the\nroom, besides lighting two tall clusters of shaded candles on either\nside of the toilet-table. When all the surroundings were thus rendered\nas brilliant as possible, so that the corpse looked more livid and\nghastly by comparison, I seated myself once more, and prepared to read\nthe last message of the dead.\n\n\"Now Sibyl,\"--I muttered, leaning forward a little, and noting with a\nmorbid interest that the jaws of the corpse had relaxed a little within\nthe last few minutes, and that the smile on the face was therefore more\nhideous--\"Confess your sins!--for I am here to listen. Such dumb,\nimpressive eloquence as yours deserves attention!\"\n\nA gust of wind fled round the house with a wailing cry,--the windows\nshook, and the candles flickered. I waited till every sound had died\naway, and then--with a glance at my dead wife, under the sudden\nimpression that she had heard what I said, and knew what I was doing, I\nbegan to read.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nThus ran the 'last document,' commencing abruptly and without prefix;--\n\n    \"I have made up my mind to die. Not out of passion or\n    petulance,--but from deliberate choice, and as I think, necessity.\n    My brain is tired of problems,--my body is tired of life; it is best\n    to make an end. The idea of death,--which means annihilation,--is\n    very sweet to me. I am glad to feel that by my own will and act I\n    can silence this uneasy throbbing of my heart, this turmoil and heat\n    of my blood,--this tortured aching of my nerves. Young as I am, I\n    have no delight now in existence,--I see nothing but my love's\n    luminous eyes, his god-like features, his enthralling smile,--and\n    these are lost to me. For a brief while he has been my world, life\n    and time,--he has gone,--and without him there is no universe. How\n    could I endure the slow, wretched passing of hours, days, weeks,\n    months and years alone?--though it is better to be alone than in the\n    dull companionship of the self-satisfied, complacent and arrogant\n    fool who is my husband. He has left me for ever, so he says in a\n    letter the maid brought to me an hour ago. It is quite what I\n    expected of him,--what man of his type could find pardon for a blow\n    to his own _amour propre_! If he had studied my nature, entered into\n    my emotions, or striven in the least to guide and sustain me,--if he\n    had shown me any sign of a great, true love such as one sometimes\n    dreams of and seldom finds,--I think I should be sorry for him\n    now,--I should even ask his forgiveness for having married him. But\n    he has treated me precisely as he might treat a paid mistress,--that\n    is, he has fed me, clothed me, and provided me with money and jewels\n    in return for making me the toy of his passions,--but he has not\n    given me one touch of sympathy,--one proof of self-denial or humane\n    forbearance. Therefore, I owe him nothing. And now he, and my love\n    who will not be my lover, have gone away together; I am free to do\n    as I will with this small pulse within me called life, which is\n    after all, only a thread, easily broken. There is no one to say me\n    nay, or to hold my hand back from giving myself the final _quietus_.\n    It is well I have no friends; it is good for me that I have probed\n    the hypocrisy and social sham of the world, and that I have mastered\n    the following hard truths of life,--that there is no love without\n    lust,--no friendship without self-interest,--no religion without\n    avarice,--and no so-called virtue without its accompanying stronger\n    vice. Who, knowing these things, would care to take part in them! On\n    the verge of the grave I look back along the short vista of my\n    years, and I see myself a child in this very place, this wooded\n    Willowsmere; I can note how that life began to which I am about to\n    put an end. Pampered, petted and spoilt, told that I must 'look\n    pretty' and take pleasure in my clothes, I was even at the age of\n    ten, capable of a certain amount of coquetry. Old _rou\u00c3\u00a9s_, smelling\n    of wine and tobacco, were eager to take me on their knees and pinch\n    my soft flesh;--they would press my innocent lips with their\n    withered ones,--withered and contaminated by the kisses of\n    _cocottes_ and 'soiled doves' of the town!--I have often wondered\n    how it is these men can dare to touch a young child's mouth, knowing\n    in themselves what beasts they are! I see my nurse,--a trained liar\n    and time-server, giving herself more airs than a queen, and\n    forbidding me to speak to this child or that child, because they\n    were 'beneath' me;--then came my governess, full of a prurient\n    prudery, as bad a woman in morals as ever lived, yet 'highly\n    recommended' and with excellent references, and wearing an\n    assumption of the strictest virtue, like many equally hypocritical\n    clergymen's wives I have known. I soon found her out,--for even as a\n    child I was painfully observant,--and the stories she and my\n    mother's French maid used to tell, in lowered voices now and then\n    broken by coarse laughter, were sufficient to enlighten me as to her\n    true character. Yet, beyond having a supreme contempt for the woman\n    who practised religious austerity outwardly, and was at heart a\n    rake, I gave small consideration to the difficult problem such a\n    nature suggested. I lived,--how strange it seems that I should be\n    writing now of myself, as past and done with!--yes, I lived in a\n    dreamy, more or less idyllic state of mind, thinking without being\n    conscious of thought, full of fancies concerning the flowers, trees\n    and birds,--wishing for things of which I knew nothing,--imagining\n    myself a queen at times, and again, a peasant. I was an omnivorous\n    reader,--and I was specially fond of poetry. I used to pore over the\n    mystic verse of Shelley, and judged him then as a sort of\n    demi-god;--and never, even when I knew all about his life, could I\n    realize him as a man with a thin, shrieking falsetto voice and\n    'loose' notions concerning women. But I am quite sure it was good\n    for his fame that he was drowned in early youth with so many\n    melancholy and dramatic surroundings,--it saved him, I consider,\n    from a possibly vicious and repulsive old age. I adored Keats till I\n    knew he had wasted his passion on a Fanny Brawn,--and then the\n    glamour of him vanished. I can offer no reason for this,--I merely\n    set down the fact. I made a hero of Lord Byron,--in fact he has\n    always formed for me the only heroical type of poet. Strong in\n    himself and pitiless in his love for women, he treated them for the\n    most part as they merited, considering the singular and unworthy\n    specimens of the sex it was his misfortune to encounter. I used to\n    wonder, when reading these men's amorous lines, whether love would\n    ever come my way, and what beatific state of emotion I should then\n    enjoy. Then came the rough awakening from all my dreams,--childhood\n    melted into womanhood,--and at sixteen I was taken up to town with\n    my parents to \"know something of the ways and manners of society,\"\n    before finally 'coming out.' Oh, those ways and manners! I learnt\n    them to perfection! Astonished at first, then bewildered, and\n    allowed no time to form any judgment on what I saw, I was hurried\n    through a general vague 'impression' of things such as I had never\n    imagined or dreamed of. While I was yet lost in wonderment, and kept\n    constantly in companionship with young girls of my own rank and age,\n    who nevertheless seemed much more advanced in knowledge of the world\n    than I, my father suddenly informed me that Willowsmere was lost to\n    us,--that he could not afford to keep it up,--and that we should\n    return there no more. Ah, what tears I shed!--what a fury of grief\n    consumed me!--I did not then comprehend the difficult entanglements\n    of either wealth or poverty;--all I could realize was that the doors\n    of my dear old home were closed upon me for ever. After that, I\n    think I grew cold and hard in disposition; I had never loved my\n    mother very dearly,--in fact I had seen very little of her, as she\n    was always away visiting, if not entertaining visitors, and she\n    seldom had me with her,--so that when she was suddenly struck down\n    by a first shock of paralysis, it affected me but little. She had\n    her doctors and nurses,--I had my governess still with me; and my\n    mother's sister, Aunt Charlotte, came to keep house for us,--so I\n    began to analyse society for myself, without giving any expression\n    of my opinions on what I observed. I was not yet 'out,' but I went\n    everywhere where girls of my age were invited, and perceived things\n    without showing that I had any faculty of perception. I cultivated a\n    passionless and cold exterior,--a listless, uninterested and frigid\n    demeanor,--for I discovered that this was accepted by many people as\n    dullness or stupidity, and that by assuming such a character,\n    certain otherwise crafty persons would talk more readily before me,\n    and betray themselves and their vices unawares. Thus my 'social\n    education' began in grim earnest;--women of title and renown would\n    ask me to their 'quiet teas,' because I was what they were pleased\n    to call a 'harmless girl--' 'rather pretty, but dull,'--and allow me\n    to assist them in entertaining the lovers who called upon them\n    while their husbands were out. I remember that on one occasion, a\n    great lady famous for two things, her diamonds and her intimacy with\n    the Queen, kissed her 'cavaliere servente,' a noted sporting earl,\n    with considerable _abandon_ in my presence. He muttered something\n    about me,--I heard it;--but his amorous mistress merely answered in\n    a whisper--\"Oh, it's only Sibyl Elton,--she understands nothing.\"\n    Afterwards however, when he had gone, she turned to me with a grin\n    and remarked--\"You saw me kiss Bertie, didn't you? I often do; he's\n    quite like my brother!\" I made no reply,--I only smiled vaguely; and\n    the next day she sent me a valuable diamond ring, which I at once\n    returned to her with a prim little note, stating that I was much\n    obliged, but that my father considered me too young as yet to wear\n    diamonds. Why do I think of these trifles now I wonder!--now when I\n    am about to take my leave of life and all its lies! ... There is a\n    little bird singing outside my bedroom window,--such a pretty\n    creature! I suppose it is happy?--it should be, as it is not\n    human... The tears are in my eyes as I listen to its sweet\n    warbling, and think that it will be living and singing still to-day\n    at sunset when I am dead!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    That last sentence was mere sentiment, for I am not sorry to die. If\n    I felt the least regret about it I should not carry out my\n    intention. I must resume my narrative,--for it is an analysis I am\n    trying to make of myself, to find out if I can whether there are no\n    excuses to be found for my particular disposition,--whether it is\n    not after all, the education and training I have had that have made\n    me what I am, or whether indeed I was born evil from the first. The\n    circumstances that surrounded me, did not, at any rate, tend to\n    soften or improve my character. I had just passed my seventeenth\n    birthday, when one morning my father called me into his library and\n    told me the true position of his affairs. I learned that he was\n    crippled on all sides with debt,--that he lived on advances made to\n    him by Jew usurers,--and that these advances were trusted to him\n    solely on the speculation that I, his only daughter, would make a\n    sufficiently rich marriage to enable him to repay all loans with\n    heavy interest. He went on to say that he hoped I would act\n    sensibly,--and that when any men showed indications of becoming\n    suitors for my hand, I would, before encouraging them, inform him,\n    in order that he might make strict enquiries as to their actual\n    extent of fortune. I then understood, for the first time, that I was\n    for sale. I listened in silence till he had finished,--then I asked\n    him--'Love, I suppose, is not to be considered in the matter?' He\n    laughed, and assured me it was much easier to love a rich man than a\n    poor one, as I would find out after a little experience. He added,\n    with some hesitation, that to help make both ends meet, as the\n    expenses of town life were considerable, he had arranged to take a\n    young American lady under his charge, a Miss Diana Chesney, who\n    wished to be introduced into English society, and who would pay two\n    thousand guineas a year to him for that privilege, and for Aunt\n    Charlotte's services as chaper\u00c3\u00b4ne. I do not remember now what I said\n    to him when I heard this,--I know that my long suppressed feelings\n    broke out in a storm of fury, and that for the moment he was\n    completely taken aback by the force of my indignation. An American\n    boarder in _our_ house!--it seemed to me as outrageous and\n    undignified as the conduct of a person I once heard of, who,\n    favoured by the Queen's patronage with 'free' apartments in\n    Kensington Palace, took from time to time on the sly, an American or\n    Colonial 'paying-guest,' who adopted forthwith the address of Her\n    Majesty's birthplace as her own, thus lowering the whole prestige of\n    that historic habitation. My wrath however was useless;--the bargain\n    was arranged,--my father, regardless of his proud lineage and the\n    social dignity of his position, had degraded himself, in my opinion,\n    to the level of a sort of superior lodging-house keeper,--and from\n    that time I lost all my former respect for him. Of course it can be\n    argued that I was wrong,--that I ought to have honoured him for\n    turning his name to monetary account by loaning it out as a\n    protective shield and panoply for an American woman without\n    anything but the dollars of a vulgar 'railway-king' to back her up\n    in society,--but I could not see it in that light. I retreated into\n    myself more than ever,--and became more than pleasantly known for my\n    coldness, reserve and hauteur. Miss Chesney came, and strove hard to\n    be my friend,--but she soon found that impossible. She is a\n    good-hearted creature I believe,--but she is badly bred and badly\n    trained as all her compatriots are, more or less, despite their\n    smattering of an European education; I disliked her from the first,\n    and have spared no pains to show it. Yet I know she will be Countess\n    of Elton as soon as it is decently possible,--say, after the year's\n    ceremonious mourning for my mother has expired, and perhaps three\n    months' hypocritical wearing of black for me,--my father believes\n    himself to be still young and passably good-looking, and he is quite\n    incapable of resisting the fortune she will bring him. When she took\n    up her fixed abode in our house and Aunt Charlotte became her paid\n    chaper\u00c3\u00b4ne, I seldom went out to any social gatherings, for I could\n    not endure the idea of being seen in her companionship. I kept to my\n    own room a great deal, and thus secluded, read many books. All the\n    fashionable fiction of the day passed through my hands, much to my\n    gradual enlightenment, if not to my edification. One day,--a day\n    that is stamped on my memory as a kind of turning-point in my\n    life,--I read a novel by a woman which I did not at first entirely\n    understand,--but on going over some of its passages a second time,\n    all at once its horrible lasciviousness flashed upon me, and filled\n    me with such genuine disgust that I flung it on the ground in a fit\n    of loathing and contempt. Yet I had seen it praised in all the\n    leading journals of the day; its obscenities were hinted at as\n    'daring,'--its vulgarities were quoted as 'brilliant wit,'--in fact\n    so many laudatory columns were written about it in the press that I\n    resolved to read it again. Encouraged by the 'literary censors' of\n    the time, I did so, and little by little the insidious abomination\n    of it filtered into my mind and _stayed there_. I began to think\n    about it,--and by-and-by found pleasure in thinking about it. I\n    sent for other books by the same tainted hand, and my appetite for\n    that kind of prurient romance grew keener. At this particular\n    juncture as chance or fate would have it, an acquaintance of mine,\n    the daughter of a Marchioness, a girl with large black eyes, and\n    those full protruding lips which remind one unconsciously of a\n    swine's snout, brought me two or three odd volumes of the poems of\n    Swinburne. Always devoted to poetry, and considering it to be the\n    highest of the arts, and up to that period having been ignorant of\n    this writer's work, I turned over the books with eagerness,\n    expecting to enjoy the usual sublime emotions which it is the\n    privilege and glory of the poet to inspire in mortals less divinely\n    endowed than himself, and who turn to him\n\n              \"for help to climb\n      Beyond the highest peaks of time.\"\n\n    Now I should like, if I could do so, to explain clearly the effect\n    of this satyr-songster upon my mind,--for I believe there are many\n    women to whom his works have been deadlier than the deadliest\n    poison, and far more soul-corrupting than any book of Zola's or the\n    most pernicious of modern French writers. At first I read the poems\n    quickly, with a certain pleasure in the musical swing and jangle of\n    rhythm, and without paying much attention to the subject-matter of\n    the verse,--but presently, as though a lurid blaze of lightning had\n    stripped a fair tree of its adorning leaves, my senses suddenly\n    perceived the cruelty and sensuality concealed under the ornate\n    language and persuasive rhymes,--and for a moment I paused in my\n    reading, and closed my eyes, shuddering and sick at heart. Was human\n    nature as base and abandoned as this man declared it to be? Was\n    there no God but Lust? Were men and women lower and more depraved in\n    their passions and appetites than the very beasts? I mused and\n    dreamed,--I pored over the 'Laus Veneris'--'Faustine' and\n    'Anactoria,' till I felt myself being dragged down to the level of\n    the mind that conceived such outrages to decency,--I drank in the\n    poet's own fiendish contempt of God, and I read over and over again\n    his verses 'Before a Crucifix' till I knew them by heart;--till they\n    rang in my brain as persistently as any nursery jingle, and drove my\n    thoughts into as haughty a scorn of Christ and His teachings, as any\n    unbelieving Jew. It is nothing to me now,--now, when without hope,\n    or faith or love, I am about to take the final plunge into eternal\n    darkness and silence,--but for the sake of those who _have_ the\n    comfort of a religion I ask, why, in a so-called Christian country,\n    is such a hideous blasphemy as 'Before a Crucifix' allowed to\n    circulate among the people without so much as one reproof from those\n    who elect themselves judges of literature? I have seen many noble\n    writers condemned unheard,--many have been accused of blasphemy,\n    whose works tend quite the other way,--but these lines are permitted\n    to work their cruel mischief unchecked, and the writer of them is\n    glorified as though he were a benefactor to mankind. I quote them\n    here, from bitter memory, that I may not be deemed as exaggerating\n    their nature--\n\n     \"So when our souls look back to thee,\n        They sicken, seeing against thy side,\n     _Too foul to speak of or to see_,\n        The leprous likeness of a bride,\n      Whose kissing lips through his lips grown\n     _Leave their God rotten to the bone_.\n\n      When we would see thee man, and know\n        What heart thou had'st towards man indeed,\n      Lo, thy blood-blackened altars; lo,\n        The lips of priests that pray and feed,\n     _While their own hell's worm curls and licks\n      The poison of the crucifix_.\n\n      Thou bad'st the children come to thee,--\n       _What children now but curses come_,\n      What manhood in that God can be\n        Who sees their worship and is dumb?--\n      No soul that lived, loved, wrought, and died\n     _Is this, their Carrion Crucified!_\n\n      Nay, if their God and thou be one\n        If thou and _this thing_ be the same,\n      Thou should'st not look upon the sun,\n       _The sun grows haggard at thy name!_\n      Come down, be done with, cease, give o'er,\n      Hide thyself, strive not, _be no more!_\"\n\n    From the time of reading this, I used to think of Christ as 'carrion\n    crucified';--if I ever thought at all. I found out that no one had\n    ever reproached Swinburne for this term,--that it did not interfere\n    with his chances for the Laureateship,--and that not even a priest\n    of the church had been bold-spoken or zealous enough in his Master's\n    cause to publicly resent the shameless outrage. So I concluded that\n    Swinburne must, after all, be right in his opinions, and I followed\n    the lazy and unthinking course of social movement, spending my days\n    with such literature as stored my brain with a complete knowledge of\n    things evil and pernicious. Whatever soul I had in me was killed;\n    the freshness of my mind was gone,--Swinburne, among others, had\n    helped me to live mentally, if not physically, through such a phase\n    of vice as had poisoned my thoughts for ever. I understand there is\n    some vague law in existence about placing an interdiction on certain\n    books considered injurious to public morals,--if there is such a\n    rule, it has been curiously lax concerning the author of\n    'Anactoria'--who, by virtue of being a poet, passes unquestioned\n    into many a home, carrying impure suggestion into minds that were\n    once cleanly and simple. As for me, after I had studied his verse to\n    my heart's content, nothing remained sacred,--I judged men as beasts\n    and women as little better,--I had no belief in honour, virtue or\n    truth,--and I was absolutely indifferent to all things save one, and\n    that was my resolve to have my own way as far as love was concerned.\n    I might be forced to marry without love for purely\n    money-considerations,--but all the same, love I would have, or what\n    I called love;--not an 'ideal' passion by any means, but precisely\n    what Mr Swinburne and a few of the most-praised novelists of the day\n    had taught me to consider as love. I began to wonder when and how I\n    should meet my lover,--such thoughts as I had at this time indeed\n    would have made moralists stare and uplift their hands in\n    horror,--but to the exterior world I was the very pink and pattern\n    of maidenly decorum, reserve and pride. Men desired, but feared me;\n    for I never gave them any encouragement, seeing as yet none among\n    them whom I deemed worthy of such love as I could give. The majority\n    resembled carefully trained baboons,--respectably clothed and\n    artistically shaven,--but nevertheless all with the spasmodic grin,\n    the leering eye and the uncouth gestures of the hairy woodland\n    monster. When I was just eighteen I 'came out' in earnest--that is,\n    I was presented at Court with all the foolish and farcical pomp\n    practised on such occasions. I was told before going that it was a\n    great and necessary thing to be 'presented,'--that it was a\n    guarantee of position, and above all of reputation,--the Queen\n    received none whose conduct was not rigidly correct and virtuous.\n    What humbug it all was!--I laughed then, and I can smile now to\n    think of it,--why, the very woman who presented me had two\n    illegitimate sons, unknown to her lawful husband, and she was not\n    the only playful sinner in the Court comedy! Some women were there\n    that day whom since even _I_ would not receive--so openly infamous\n    are their lives and characters, yet they make their demure curtseys\n    before the Throne at stated times, and assume to be the very\n    patterns of virtue and austerity. Now and then, it chances in the\n    case of an exceedingly beautiful woman, of whom all the others are\n    jealous, that for her little slips she is selected as an 'example'\n    and excluded from Court, while her plainer sisters, though sinning\n    seventy times seven against all the laws of decency and morality,\n    are still received,--but otherwise, there is very little real care\n    exercised as to the character and prestige of the women whom the\n    Queen receives. If any one of them _is_ refused, it is certain she\n    adds to her social enormities, the greater crime of being beautiful,\n    otherwise there would be no one to whisper away her reputation! I\n    was what is called a 'success' on my presentation day. That is, I\n    was stared at, and openly flattered by certain members of my sex who\n    were too old and ugly to be jealous, and treated with insolent\n    contempt by those who were young enough to be my rivals. There was a\n    great crush to get into the Throne-Room; and some of the ladies used\n    rather strong language. One duchess, just in front of me, said to\n    her companion--'Do as I do,--_kick out_! Bruise their shins for\n    them--as hard as you can,--we shall get on faster then!' This choice\n    remark was accompanied by the grin of a fishwife and the stare of a\n    drab. Yet it was a 'great' lady who spoke,--not a Transatlantic\n    importation, but a woman of distinguished lineage and connection.\n    Her observation however was only one out of many similar speeches\n    which I heard on all sides of me during the 'distinguished'\n    m\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9e,--a thoroughly ill-mannered 'crush,' which struck me as\n    supremely vulgar and totally unfitting the dignity of our\n    Sovereign's court. When I curtsied before the Throne at last, and\n    saw the majesty of the Empire represented by a kindly faced old\n    lady, looking very tired and bored, whose hand was as cold as ice\n    when I kissed it, I was conscious of an intense feeling of pity for\n    her in her high estate. Who would be a Monarch, to be doomed to the\n    perpetual receiving of a company of fools! I got through my duties\n    quickly, and returned home more or less wearied out and disgusted\n    with the whole ceremony,--and next day I found that my 'deb\u00c3\u00bbt' had\n    given me the position of a 'leading beauty'; or in other words that\n    I was now formally put up for sale. That is really what is meant by\n    being 'presented' and 'coming out,'--these are the fancy terms of\n    one's parental auctioneer. My life was now passed in dressing,\n    having my photograph taken, giving 'sittings' to aspiring\n    fashionable painters, and being 'inspected' by men with a view to\n    matrimony. It was distinctly understood in society that I was not to\n    be sold under a certain figure per annum,--and the price was too\n    high for most would-be purchasers. How sick I grew of my constant\n    exhibition in the marriage-market! What contempt and hatred was\n    fostered in me for the mean and pitiable hypocrisies of my set! I\n    was not long in discovering that money was the chief-motive power of\n    all social success,--that the proudest and highest personages in\n    the world could be easily gathered together under the roof of any\n    vulgar plebeian who happened to have enough cash to feed and\n    entertain them. As an example of this, I remember a woman, ugly,\n    pass\u00c3\u00a9e and squint-eyed, who during her father's life was only\n    allowed about half-a-crown a week as pocket-money up to her fortieth\n    year,--and who, when that father died, leaving her in possession of\n    half his fortune, (the other half going to illegitimate children of\n    whom she had never heard, he having always posed as a pattern of\n    immaculate virtue) suddenly blossomed out as a 'leader' of fashion,\n    and succeeded, through cautious scheming and ungrudging toadyism, in\n    assembling some of the highest people in the land under her roof.\n    Ugly and pass\u00c3\u00a9e though she was, and verging towards fifty, with\n    neither grace, wit, nor intelligence, through the power of her cash\n    alone she invited Royal dukes and 'titles' generally to her dinners\n    and dances,--and it is to their shame that they actually accepted\n    her invitations. Such voluntary degradations on the part of really\n    well-connected people I have never been able to understand,--it is\n    not as if they were actually in want of food or amusement, for they\n    have a surfeit of both every season,--and it seems to me that they\n    ought to show a better example than to flock in crowds to the\n    entertainments of a mere uninteresting and ugly nobody just because\n    she happens to have money. I never entered her house myself though\n    she had the audacity to invite me,--I learned moreover, that she had\n    promised a friend of mine a hundred guineas if she could persuade me\n    to make one appearance in her rooms. For my renown as a 'beauty'\n    combined with my pride and exclusiveness, would have given her\n    parties a _prestige_ greater than even Royalty could bestow,--_she_\n    knew that and _I_ knew that,--and knowing it, never condescended to\n    so much as notice her by a bow. But though I took a certain\n    satisfaction in thus revenging myself on the atrocious vulgarity of\n    _parvenus_ and social interlopers, I grew intensely weary of the\n    monotony and emptiness of what fashionable folks call 'amusement,'\n    and presently falling ill of a nervous fever, I was sent down to\n    the seaside for a few weeks' change of air with a young cousin of\n    mine, a girl I rather liked because she was so different to myself.\n    Her name was Eva Maitland--she was but sixteen and extremely\n    delicate--poor little soul! she died two months before my marriage.\n    She and I, and a maid to attend us, went down to Cromer,--and one\n    day, sitting on the cliffs together, she asked me timidly if I knew\n    an author named Mavis Clare? I told her no,--whereupon she handed me\n    a book called 'The Wings of Psyche.'\n\n    \"Do read it!\" she said earnestly--\"It will make you feel so happy!\"\n\n    I laughed. The idea of a modern author writing anything to make one\n    feel happy, seemed to me quite ludicrous, the aim of most of them\n    being to awaken a disgust of life, and a hatred of one's\n    fellow-creatures. However, to please Eva, I read the 'Wings of\n    Psyche,'--and if it did not make me actually happy, it moved me to a\n    great wonder and deep reverence for the woman-writer of such a book.\n    I found out all about her,--that she was young, good-looking, of a\n    noble character and unblemished reputation, and that her only\n    enemies were the press-critics. This last point was so much in her\n    favour with me that I at once bought everything she had ever\n    written, and her works became, as it were, my haven of rest. Her\n    theories of life are strange, poetic, ideal and beautiful;--though I\n    have not been able to accept them or work them out in my own case, I\n    have always felt soothed and comforted for a while in the very act\n    of wishing they were true. And the woman is like her\n    books,--strange, poetic, ideal and beautiful,--how odd it is to\n    think that she is within ten minutes walk of me now!--I could send\n    for her if I liked, and tell her all,--but she would prevent me\n    carrying out my resolve. She would cling to me woman-like and kiss\n    me, and hold my hands and say 'No, Sibyl, no! You are not\n    yourself,--you must come to me and rest!' An odd fancy has seized\n    me, ... I will open my window and call her very gently,--she might\n    be in the garden coming here to see me,--and if she hears and\n    answers, who knows!--why, perhaps my ideas may change, and fate\n    itself may take a different course!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Well, I have called her. I have sent her name 'Mavis!' softly out on\n    the sunshine and still air three times, and only a little brown\n    namesake of hers, a thrush, swinging on a branch of fir, answered me\n    with his low autumnal piping. Mavis! She will not come,--to-day God\n    will not make her His messenger. She cannot guess--she does not know\n    this tragedy of my heart, greater and more poignant than all the\n    tragedies of fiction. If she did know me as I am, I wonder what she\n    would think of me!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Let me go back to the time when love came to me,--love, ardent,\n    passionate, and eternal! Ah, what wild joy thrilled through me! what\n    mad ecstasy fired my blood!--what delirious dreams possessed my\n    brain!--I saw Lucio,--and it seemed as if the splendid eyes of some\n    great angel had flashed a glory in my soul! With him came his\n    friend, the foil to his beauty,--the arrogant, self-satisfied fool\n    of a millionaire, Geoffrey Tempest,--he who bought me, and who by\n    virtue of his purchase, is entitled by law to call himself my\n    husband ...\"\n\nHere I paused in my reading and looked up. The dead woman's eyes\nappeared now to regard me as steadily as herself in the opposite\nmirror,--the head was a little more dropped forward on the breast, and\nthe whole face very nearly resembled that of the late Countess of Elton\nwhen the last shock of paralysis had rendered her hideous disfigurement\ncomplete.\n\n\"To think I loved _that_!\" I said aloud, pointing at the corpse's\nghastly reflection--\"Fool that I was indeed!--as great a fool as all men\nare who barter their lives for the possession of a woman's mere body!\nWhy if there were any life after death,--if such a creature had a soul\nthat at all resembled this poisoned clay, the very devils might turn\naway aghast from such a loathly comrade!\"\n\nThe candles flickered and the dead face seemed to smile,--a clock\nchimed in the adjoining room, but I did not count the hour,--I merely\narranged the manuscript pages I held more methodically, and read on with\nrenewed attention.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\n    \"From the moment I saw Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez\"--went on Sibyl's 'dying\n    speech'--\"I abandoned myself to love and the desire of love. I had\n    heard of him before from my father who had (as I learned to my\n    shame) been indebted to him for monetary assistance. On the very\n    night we met, my father told me quite plainly that now was my chance\n    to get 'settled' in life. 'Marry Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez or Tempest, whichever you\n    can most easily catch,' he said--'The prince is fabulously\n    wealthy--but he keeps up a mystery about himself and no one knows\n    where he actually comes from,--besides which he dislikes women;--now\n    Tempest has five millions and seems an easy-going fool,--I should\n    say you had better go for Tempest.' I made no answer and gave no\n    promise either way. I soon found out however that Lucio did not\n    intend to marry,--and I concluded that he preferred to be the lover\n    of many women, instead of the husband of one. I did not love him any\n    the less for this,--I only resolved that I would at least be one of\n    those who were happy enough to share his passion. I married the man\n    Tempest, feeling that like many women I knew, I should when safely\n    wedded, have greater liberty of action,--I was aware that most\n    modern men prefer an amour with a married woman to any other kind of\n    _liaison_,--and I thought Lucio would have readily yielded to the\n    plan I had pre-conceived. But I was mistaken,--and out of this\n    mistake comes all my perplexity, pain and bewilderment I cannot\n    understand why my love,--beloved beyond all word or\n    thought,--should scorn me and repulse me with such bitter loathing!\n    It is such a common thing now-a-days for a married woman to have her\n    own lover, apart from her husband _de convenance_! The writers of\n    books advise it,--I have seen the custom not only excused but\n    advocated over and over again in long and scientific articles that\n    are openly published in leading magazines. Why then should I be\n    blamed or my desires considered criminal? As long as no public\n    scandal is made, what harm is done? I cannot see it,--it is not as\n    if there were a God to care,--the scientists say there is no God!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I was very startled just now. I thought I heard Lucio's voice\n    calling me. I have walked through the rooms looking everywhere, and\n    I opened my door to listen, but there is no one. I am alone. I have\n    told the servant not to disturb me till I ring; ... I shall never\n    ring! Now I come to think of it, it is singular that I have never\n    known who Lucio really is. A prince, he says--and that I can well\n    believe,--though truly princes now-a-days are so plebeian and common\n    in look and bearing that he seems too great to belong to so shabby a\n    fraternity. From what kingdom does he come?--to what nation does he\n    belong? These are questions which he never answers save equivocally.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I pause here, and look at myself in the mirror. How beautiful I am!\n    I note with admiration the deep and dewy lustre of my eyes and their\n    dark silky fringes,--I see the delicate colouring of my cheeks and\n    lips,--the dear rounded chin with its pretty dimple,--the pure lines\n    of my slim throat and snowy neck,--the glistening wealth of my long\n    hair. All this was given to me for the attraction and luring of men,\n    but my love, whom I love with all this living, breathing, exquisite\n    being of mine, can see no beauty in me, and rejects me with such\n    scorn as pierces my very soul. I have knelt to him,--I have prayed\n    to him,--I have worshipped him,--in vain! Hence it comes that I must\n    die. Only one thing he said that had the sound of hope, though the\n    utterance was fierce, and his looks were cruel,--'Patience!' he\n    whispered--'we shall meet ere long!' What did he mean?--what\n    possible meeting can there be now, when death must close the gate of\n    life, and even love would come too late!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I have unlocked my jewel-case and taken from it the deadly thing\n    secreted there,--a poison that was entrusted to me by one of the\n    physicians who lately attended my mother. 'Keep this under lock and\n    key,' he said, 'and be sure that it is used only for external\n    purposes. There is sufficient in this flask to kill ten men, if\n    swallowed by mistake.' I look at it wonderingly. It is\n    colourless,--and there is not enough to fill a teaspoon, ... yet ...\n    it will bring down upon me an eternal darkness, and close up for\n    ever the marvellous scenes of the universe! So little!--to do so\n    much! I have fastened Lucio's wedding-gift round my waist,--the\n    beautiful snake of jewels that clings to me as though it were\n    charged with an embrace from him,--ah! would I could cheat myself\n    into so pleasing a fancy! ... I am trembling, but not with cold or\n    fear,--it is simply an excitation of the nerves,----an instinctive\n    recoil of flesh and blood at the near prospect of death.... How\n    brilliantly the sun shines through my window!--its callous golden\n    stare has watched so many tortured creatures die without so much as\n    a cloud to dim its radiance by way of the suggestion of pity! If\n    there were a God I fancy He would be like the sun,--glorious,\n    changeless, unapproachable, beautiful, but pitiless!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Out of all the various types of human beings I think I hate the\n    class called poets most. I used to love them and believe in them;\n    but I know them now to be mere weavers of lies,--builders of cloud\n    castles in which no throbbing life can breathe, no weary heart find\n    rest. Love is their chief motive,--they either idealize or degrade\n    it,--and of the love we women long for most, they have no\n    conception. They can only sing of brute passion or ethical\n    impossibilities,--of the mutual great sympathy, the ungrudging\n    patient tenderness that should make love lovely, they have no sweet\n    things to say. Between their strained \u00c3\u00a6stheticism and unbridled\n    sensualism, my spirit has been stretched on the rack and broken on\n    the wheel, ... I should think many a wretched woman wrecked among\n    love's disillusions must curse them as I do!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I am ready now, I think. There is nothing more to say. I offer no\n    excuses for myself. I am as I was made,--a proud and rebellious\n    woman, self-willed and sensual, seeing no fault in free love, and no\n    crime in conjugal infidelity,--and if I am vicious, I can honestly\n    declare that my vices have been encouraged and fostered in me by\n    most of the literary teachers of my time. I married, as most women\n    of my set marry, merely for money,--I loved, as most women of my set\n    love, for mere bodily attraction,--I die, as most women of my set\n    will die, either naturally or self-slain, in utter atheism,\n    rejoicing that there is no God and no Hereafter!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I had the poison in my hand a moment ago, ready to take, when I\n    suddenly felt someone approaching me stealthily from behind, and\n    glancing up quickly at the mirror I saw ... my mother! Her face,\n    hideous and ghastly as it had been in her last illness, was\n    reflected in the glass, peering over my shoulder! I sprang up and\n    confronted her,----she was gone! And now I am shivering with cold,\n    and I feel a chill dampness on my forehead,--mechanically I have\n    soaked a handkerchief with perfume from one of the silver bottles on\n    the dressing table, and have passed it across my temples to help me\n    recover from this sick swooning sensation. To _recover_!--how\n    foolish of me, seeing I am about to die. I do not believe in\n    ghosts,--yet I could have sworn my mother was actually present just\n    now,--of course it was an optical delusion of my own feverish brain.\n    The strong scent on my handkerchief reminds me of Paris--I can see\n    the shop where I bought this particular perfume, and the\n    well-dressed doll of a man who served me, with his little waxed\n    moustache, and his indefinable French manner of conveying a\n    speechless personal compliment while making out a bill.... Laughing\n    at this recollection, I see my face radiate in the glass,--my eyes\n    flash into vivid lustre, and the dimples near my lips come and go,\n    giving my expression an enchanting sweetness. Yet in a few hours\n    this loveliness will be destroyed,--and in a few days, the worms\n    will twine where the smile is now!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    An idea has come upon me that perhaps I ought to say a prayer. It\n    would be hypocritical,--but conventional. To die fashionably, one\n    ought to concede a few words to the church. And yet ... to kneel\n    down with clasped hands and tell an inactive, unsympathetic,\n    selfish, paid community called the church, that I am going to kill\n    myself for the sake of love and love's despair, and that therefore I\n    humbly implore its forgiveness for the act seems absurd,--as absurd\n    as to tell the same thing to a non-existent Deity. I suppose the\n    scientists do not think what a strange predicament their advanced\n    theories put the human mind in at the hour of death. They forget\n    that on the brink of the grave, thoughts come that will not be\n    gainsaid, and that cannot be appeased by a learned thesis....\n    However I will not pray,--it would seem to myself cowardly that I\n    who have never said my prayers since I was a child, should run over\n    them now in a foolish babbling attempt to satisfy the powers\n    invisible,--I could not, out of sheer association, appeal to Mr\n    Swinburne's 'crucified carrion'! Besides I do not believe in the\n    powers invisible at all,--I feel that once outside this life, 'the\n    rest' as Hamlet said 'is silence.'\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    I have been staring dreamily and in a sort of stupefaction at the\n    little poison-flask in my hand. _It is quite empty now._ I have\n    swallowed every drop of the liquid it contained,--I took it quickly\n    and determinately as one takes nauseous medicine, without allowing\n    myself another moment of time for thought or hesitation. It tasted\n    acrid and burning on my tongue,--but at present I am not conscious\n    of any strange or painful result. I shall watch my face in the\n    mirror and trace the oncoming of death,--this will be at any rate a\n    new sensation not without interest!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    My mother is here,--here with me in this room! She is moving about\n    restlessly, making wild gestures with her hands and trying to speak.\n    She looks as she did when she was dying,--only more alive, more\n    sentient. I have followed her up and down, but am unable to touch\n    her,--she eludes my grasp. I have called her 'Mother! Mother!' but\n    no sound issues from her white lips. Her face is so appalling that I\n    was seized with a convulsion of terror a moment ago and fell on my\n    knees before her imploring her to leave me,--and then she paused in\n    her gliding to and fro and--smiled! What a hideous smile it was! I\n    think I lost consciousness, ... for I found myself lying on the\n    ground. A sharp and terrible pain running through me made me spring\n    to my feet, ... and I bit my lips till they bled, lest I should\n    scream aloud with the agony I suffered and so alarm the house. When\n    the paroxysm passed I saw my mother standing quite near to me,\n    dumbly watching me with a strange expression of wonder and remorse.\n    I tottered past her and back to this chair where I now sit,----I am\n    calmer now, and I am able to realize that she is only the phantom of\n    my own brain--that I _fancy_ she is here while _knowing_ she is\n    dead.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Torture indescribable has made of me a writhing, moaning, helpless\n    creature for the past few minutes. Truly that drug was deadly;--the\n    pain is horrible ... horrible! ... it has left me quivering in every\n    limb and palpitating in every nerve. Looking at my face in the glass\n    I see that it has already altered. It is drawn and livid,--all the\n    fresh rose-tint of my lips has gone,--my eyes protrude unnaturally,\n    ... there are dull blue marks at the corners of my mouth and in the\n    hollows of my temples, and I observe a curious quick pulsation in\n    the veins of my throat. Be my torment what it will, now there is no\n    remedy,--and I am resolved to sit here and study my own features to\n    the end. 'The reaper whose name is Death' must surely be near, ready\n    to gather my long hair in his skeleton hand like a sheaf of ripe\n    corn, ... my poor beautiful hair!--how I have loved its glistening\n    ripples, and brushed it, and twined it round my fingers, ... and how\n    soon it will lie like a dank weed in the mould!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    A devouring fire is in my brain and body,--I am burning with heat\n    and parched with thirst,--I have drunk deep draughts of cold water,\n    but this has not relieved me. The sun glares in upon me like an open\n    furnace,--I have tried to rise and close the blind against it, but\n    find I have no force to stand upright. The strong radiance blinds\n    me:--the silver toilet boxes on my table glitter like so many points\n    of swords. It is by a powerful effort of will that I am able to\n    continue writing,--my head is swimming round,--and there is a\n    choking sensation in my throat.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    A moment since I thought I was dying. Torn asunder as it were by the\n    most torturing pangs, I could have screamed for help,--and would\n    have done so, had voice been left me. But I cannot speak above a\n    whisper,--I mutter my own name to myself 'Sibyl! Sibyl!' and can\n    scarcely hear it. My mother stands beside me,--apparently\n    waiting;--a little while ago I thought I heard her say 'Come, Sibyl!\n    Come to your chosen lover!' Now I am conscious of a great silence\n    everywhere,--a numbness has fallen upon me, and a delicious respite\n    from pain,--but I see my face in the glass and know it is the face\n    of the dead. It will soon be all over,--a few more uneasy\n    breathings,--and I shall be at rest. I am glad,--for the world and I\n    were never good friends;--I am sure that if we could know, before we\n    were born, what life really is, we should never take the trouble to\n    live!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    A horrible fear has suddenly beset me. What if death were not what\n    the scientists deem it,--suppose it were another form of life? Can\n    it be that I am losing reason and courage together? ... or what is\n    this terrible misgiving that is taking possession of me? ... I begin\n    to falter ... a strange sense of horror is creeping over me ... I\n    have no more physical pain, but something worse than pain oppresses\n    me ... a feeling that I cannot define. I am dying ... dying!--I\n    repeat this to myself for comfort, ... in a little while I shall be\n    deaf and blind and unconscious, ... why then is the silence around\n    me now broken through by sound? I listen,--and I hear distinctly the\n    clamour of wild voices mingled with a sullen jar and roll as of\n    distant thunder! ... My mother stands closer to me, ... she is\n    stretching out her hand to touch mine!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Oh God! ... Let me write--write--while I can! Let me yet hold fast\n    the thread which fastens me to earth,--give me time--time before I\n    drift out, lost in yonder blackness and flame! Let me write for\n    others the awful Truth, as I see it,--there is No death!\n    None--none!--_I cannot die._ I am passing out of my body,--I am\n    being wrenched away from it inch by inch in inexplicable mystic\n    torture,--but I am not dying,--I am being carried forward into a new\n    life, vague and vast! ... I see a new world full of dark forms, half\n    shaped yet shapeless!--they float towards me, beckoning me on. I am\n    actively conscious--I hear, I think, I know! Death is a mere human\n    dream,--a comforting fancy; it has no real existence,--there is\n    nothing in the Universe but life! O hideous misery!--_I cannot die!_\n    In my mortal body I can scarcely breathe,--the pen I try to hold\n    writes of itself rather than through my shaking hand,--but these\n    pangs are the throes of birth--not death! ... I hold back,--with all\n    the force of my soul I strive not to plunge into that black abyss I\n    see before me--but--_my mother drags me with her_,--I cannot shake\n    her off! I hear her voice now;--she speaks distinctly, and laughs as\n    though she wept; 'Come Sibyl! Soul of the child I bore, come and\n    meet your lover! Come and see upon WHOM you fixed your faith! Soul\n    of the woman I trained, return to that from whence you came!' Still\n    I hold back,--nude and trembling I stare into a dark void--and now\n    there are wings about me,--wings of fiery scarlet!--they fill the\n    space,--they enfold me,--they propel me,--they rush past and whirl\n    around me, stinging me as with flying arrows and showers of hail!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Let me write on,--write on, with this dead fleshly hand, ... one\n    moment more time, dread God! ... one moment more to write the\n    truth,--the terrible truth of Death whose darkest secret, Life, is\n    unknown to men! I live!--a new, strong, impetuous vitality possesses\n    me, though my mortal body is nearly dead. Faint gasps and weak\n    shudderings affect it still,--and I, outside it and no longer of it,\n    propel its perishing hand to write these final words--_I live!_ To\n    my despair and horror,--to my remorse and agony, I live!--oh the\n    unspeakable misery of this new life! And worst of all,--God whom I\n    doubted, God whom I was taught to deny, this wronged, blasphemed,\n    and outraged God EXISTS! And I could have found Him had I\n    chosen,--this knowledge is forced upon me as I am torn from\n    hence,--it is shouted at me by a thousand wailing voices! ... too\n    late!--too late!--the scarlet wings beat me downward,--these strange\n    half-shapeless forms close round and drive me onward ... to a\n    further darkness, ... amid wind and fire!\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Serve me, dead hand, once more ere I depart, ... my tortured spirit\n    must seize and compel you to write down this thing unnameable, that\n    earthly eyes may read, and earthly souls take timely warning! ... I\n    know at last WHOM I have loved!--whom I have chosen, whom I have\n    worshipped! ... Oh God, have mercy! ... I know WHO claims my worship\n    now, and drags me into yonder rolling world of flame! ... his name\n    is ........\"\n\nHere the manuscript ended,--incomplete and broken off abruptly,--and\nthere was a blot on the last sentence as though the pen had been\nviolently wrenched from the dying fingers and hastily flung down.\n\nThe clock in the west room again chimed the hour. I rose stiffly from my\nchair, trembling,--my self-possession was giving way, and I began to\nfeel at last unnerved. I looked askance at my dead wife,--she, who with\na superhuman dying effort had declared herself to be yet alive,--who, in\nsome imaginable strange way had seemingly written _after_ death, in a\nfrantic desire to make some appalling declaration which nevertheless\nremained undeclared. The rigid figure of the corpse had now real terrors\nfor me,--I dared not touch it,--I scarcely dared look at it, ... in some\ndim inscrutable fashion I felt as if \"scarlet wings\" environed it,\nbeating me down, yet pressing me on,--me too, in my turn! With the\nmanuscript gathered close in my hand, I bent nervously forward to blow\nout the wax lights on the toilet table, ... I saw on the floor the\nhandkerchief odorous with the French perfume the dead woman had written\nof,--I picked it up and placed it near her where she sat, grinning\nhideously at her own mirrored ghastliness. The flash of the jewelled\nserpent round her waist caught my eyes anew as I did this, and I stared\nfor a moment at its green glitter, dumbly fascinated,--then, moving\nstealthily, with the cold sweat pouring down my back and every pulse in\nme rendered feeble by sheer horror, I turned to leave the room. As I\nreached the porti\u00c3\u00a9re and lifted it, some instinct made me look back at\nthe dread picture of the leading \"society\" beauty sitting stark and\nlivid pale before her own stark and livid-pale image in the glass,--what\na \"fashion-plate\" she would make now, I thought, for a frivolous and\nhypocritical \"ladies' paper!\"\n\n\"You say you are not dead, Sibyl!\" I muttered aloud--\"Not dead, but\nliving! Then, if you are alive, where are you, Sibyl?----where are you?\"\n\nThe heavy silence seemed fraught with fearful meaning,--the light of the\nelectric lamps on the corpse and on the shimmering silk garment wrapped\nround it appeared unearthly,--and the perfume in the room had a\ngrave-like earthy smell. A panic seized me, and dragging frantically at\nthe porti\u00c3\u00a9re till all its velvet folds were drawn thickly together, I\nmade haste to shut out from my sight the horrible figure of the woman\nwhose bodily fairness I had loved in the customary way of sensual\nmen,--and left her without so much as a pardoning or pitying kiss of\nfarewell on the cold brow. For, ... after all I had Myself to think of,\n... and She was dead!\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nI pass over all the details of polite \"shock,\" affected sorrow, and\nfeigned sympathy of society at my wife's sudden death. No one was really\ngrieved about it,--men raised their eyebrows, shrugged their shoulders,\nlit extra cigarettes and dismissed the subject as too unpleasant and\ndepressing to dwell upon,--women were glad of the removal of a too\nbeautiful and too much admired rival, and the majority of fashionable\nfolk delighted in having something \"thrilling\" to talk about in the\ntragic circumstances of her end. As a rule, people are seldom or never\nunselfish enough to be honestly sorry for the evanishment of some\nleading or brilliant figure from their midst,--the vacancy leaves room\nfor the pushing in of smaller fry. Be sure that if you are unhappily\ncelebrated for either beauty, wit, intellect, or all three together,\nhalf society wishes you dead already, and the other half tries to make\nyou as wretched as possible while you are alive. To be missed at all\nwhen you die, some one must love you very deeply and unselfishly; and\ndeep unselfish love is rarer to find among mortals than a pearl in a\ndust-bin.\n\nThanks to my abundance of cash, everything concerning Sibyl's suicide\nwas admirably managed. In consideration of her social position as an\nEarl's daughter, two doctors certified (on my paying them very handsome\nfees) that hers was a 'death by misadventure,'--namely, through taking\nan accidental overdose of a powerful sleeping draught. It was the best\nreport to make,--and the most respectable. It gave the penny press an\nopportunity of moralizing on the dangers that lurked in sleeping\ndraughts generally,--and Tom, Dick, and Harry all wrote letters to their\nfavorite periodicals (signing their names in full) giving _their_\nopinions as to the nature of sleeping draughts, so that for a week at\nleast the ordinary dullness of the newspapers was quite enlivened by\nungrammatical _gratis_ 'copy.' The conventionalities of law, decency and\norder were throughout scrupulously observed and complied\nwith,--everybody was paid (which was the chief thing), and everybody\nwas, I believe, satisfied with what they managed to make out of the\ndeath-payment. The funeral gave joy to the souls of all undertakers,--it\nwas so expensive and impressive. The florist's trade gained something of\nan impetus by the innumerable orders received for wreaths and crosses\nmade of the costliest flowers. When the coffin was carried to the grave,\nit could not be seen for the load of blossoms that covered it. And amid\nall the cards and 'loving tokens' and 'farewell dearests' and\n'not-lost-but-gone-befores'--that ticketed the white masses of lilies,\ngardenias and roses which were supposed to symbolize the innocence and\nsweetness of the poisoned corpse they were sent to adorn, there was not\none honest regret,--not one unfeigned expression of true sorrow. Lord\nElton made a sufficiently striking figure of dignified parental woe, but\non the whole I think he was not sorry for his daughter's death, since\nthe only opposing obstacle to his marriage with Diana Chesney was now\nremoved. I fancy Diana herself was sorry, so far as such a frivolous\nlittle American could be sorry for anything,--perhaps, however it would\nbe more correct to say that she was frightened. Sibyl's sudden end\nstartled and troubled her,--but I am not sure that it grieved her. There\nis such a difference between unselfish grief, and the mere sense of\nnervous personal shock! Miss Charlotte Fitzroy took the news of her\nniece's death with that admirable fortitude which frequently\ncharacterizes religious spinsters of a certain age. She put by her\nknitting,--said 'God's will be done!' and sent for her favorite\nclergyman. He came, stayed with her some hours drinking strong\ntea,--and the next morning at church administered to her communion.\nThis done, Miss Fitzroy went on the blameless and even tenor of her way,\nwearing the same virtuously distressed expression as usual, and showed\nno further sign of feeling. I, as the afflicted millionaire-husband, was\nno doubt the most interesting figure on the scene; I was, I know very\nwell got up, thanks to my tailor, and to the affectionate care of the\nchief undertaker who handed me my black gloves on the day of the funeral\nwith servile solicitude, but in my heart I felt myself to be a far\nbetter actor than Henry Irving, and if only for my admirable mimicry of\nheart-break, more fully worthy of the accolade. Lucio did not attend the\nobsequies,--he wrote me a brief note of sympathy from town, and hinted\nthat he was sure I could understand his reasons for not being present. I\ndid understand, of course,--and appreciated his respect, as I thought,\nfor me and my feelings,--yet strange and incongruous as it may seem, I\nnever longed so much for his company as I did then! However,--we had a\nglorious burial of my fair and false lady,--prancing horses drew\ncoroneted carriages in a long defile down the pretty Warwickshire lanes\nto the grey old church, picturesque and peaceful, where the clergyman\nand his assistants in newly-washed surplices, met the flower-laden\ncoffin, and with the usual conventional mumblings, consigned it to the\ndust. There were even press-reporters present, who not only described\nthe scene as it did _not_ happen, but who also sent fancy sketches, to\ntheir respective journals, of the church as it did _not_ exist. I\nmention this simply to show how thoroughly all \"proper forms\" were\ncarried out and conceded to. After the ceremony all we \"mourners\" went\nback to Willowsmere to luncheon, and I well remember that Lord Elton\ntold me a new and _risqu\u00c3\u00a9_ joke over a glass of port before the meal was\nfinished. The undertakers had a sort of festive banquet in the servants'\nhall,--and taking everything into due consideration, my wife's death\ngave a great deal of pleasure to many people, and put useful money into\nseveral ready pockets. She had left no blank in society that could not\nbe easily filled up,--she was merely one butterfly out of thousands,\nmore daintily coloured perhaps and more restless in flight,--but never\njudged as more than up to the butterfly standard. I said no one gave her\nan honest regret, but I was wrong. Mavis Clare was genuinely, almost\npassionately grieved. She sent no flowers for the coffin, but she came\nto the funeral by herself, and stood a little apart waiting silently\ntill the grave was covered in,--and then, just as the \"fashionable\"\ntrain of mourners were leaving the churchyard, she advanced and placed a\nwhite cross of her own garden-lilies upon the newly-turned brown mould.\nI noticed her action, and determined that before I left Willowsmere for\nthe East with Lucio (for my journey had only been postponed a week or\ntwo on account of Sibyl's death) she should know all.\n\nThe day came when I carried out this resolve. It was a rainy and chill\nafternoon, and I found Mavis in her study, sitting beside a bright log\nfire with her small terrier in her lap and her faithful St Bernard\nstretched at her feet. She was absorbed in a book,--and over her watched\nthe marble Pallas inflexible and austere. As I entered she rose, and\nputting down the volume and her pet dog together, she advanced to meet\nme with an intense sympathy in her clear eyes, and a wordless pity in\nthe tremulous lines of her sweet mouth. It was charming to see how sorry\nshe felt for me,--and it was odd that I could not feel sorry for myself.\nAfter a few words of embarrassed greeting I sat down and watched her\nsilently, while she arranged the logs in the fire to make them burn\nbrighter, and for the moment avoided my gaze.\n\n\"I suppose you know,\"--I began with harsh abruptness--\"that the\nsleeping-draught story is a polite fiction? You know that my wife\npoisoned herself intentionally?\"\n\nMavis looked at me with a troubled and compassionate expression.\n\n\"I feared it was so--\" ... she began nervously.\n\n\"Oh there is nothing either to fear or to hope\"--I said with some\nviolence--\"_She did it._ And can you guess why she did it? Because she\nwas mad with her own wickedness and sensuality,--because she loved with\na guilty love, my friend Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez.\"\n\nMavis gave a little cry as of pain, and sat down white and trembling.\n\n\"You can read quickly, I am sure,\"--I went on. \"Part of the profession\nof literature is the ability to skim books and manuscripts rapidly, and\ngrasp the whole gist of them in a few minutes;--read _this_--\" and I\nhanded her the rolled-up pages of Sibyl's dying declaration--\"Let me\nstay here, while you learn from that what sort of a woman she was, and\njudge whether, despite her beauty, she is worth a regret!\"\n\n\"Pardon me,--\" said Mavis gently--\"I would rather not read what was not\nmeant for my eyes.\"\n\n\"But it _is_ meant for your eyes,\"--I retorted impatiently--\"It is meant\nfor everybody's eyes apparently,--it is addressed to nobody in\nparticular. There is a mention of you in it. I beg--nay I command you to\nread it!--I want your opinion on it,--your advice; you may possibly\nsuggest, after perusal, the proper sort of epitaph I ought to inscribe\non the monument I am going to build to her sacred and dear memory!\"\n\nI covered my face with one hand to hide the bitter smile which I knew\nbetrayed my thoughts, and pushed the manuscript towards her. Very\nreluctantly she took it,--and slowly unrolling it, began to read. For\nseveral minutes there was a silence, broken only by the crackling of the\nlogs on the fire, and the regular breathing of the dogs who now both lay\nstretched comfortably in front of the wood blaze. I looked covertly at\nthe woman whose fame I had envied,--at the slight figure, the coronal of\nsoft hair,--the delicate, drooping sensitive face,--the small white\nclassic hand that held the written sheets of paper so firmly, yet so\ntenderly,--the very hand of the Greek marble Psyche;--and I thought what\nshort-sighted asses some literary men are who suppose they can succeed\nin shutting out women like Mavis Clare from winning everything that fame\nor fortune can offer. Such a head as hers, albeit covered with locks\nfair and caressable, was not meant, in its fine shape and compactness,\nfor submission to inferior intelligences whether masculine or\nfeminine,--that determined little chin which the firelight delicately\noutlined, was a visible declaration of the strength of will and the\nindomitably high ambition of its owner,--and yet, ... the soft\neyes,--the tender mouth,--did not these suggest the sweetest love, the\npurest passion that ever found place in a woman's heart? I lost myself\nin dreamy musing,--I thought of many things that had little to do with\neither my own past or present. I realized that now and then at rare\nintervals God makes a woman of genius with a thinker's brain and an\nangel's soul,--and that such an one is bound to be a destiny to all\nmortals less divinely endowed, and a glory to the world in which she\ndwells. So considering, I studied Mavis Clare's face and form,--I saw\nher eyes fill with tears as she read on;--why should she weep, I\nwondered, over that 'last document' which had left me unmoved and\ncallous? I was startled almost as if from sleep when her voice,\nthrilling with pain, disturbed the stillness,--she sprang up, gazing at\nme as if she saw some horrible vision.\n\n\"Oh, are you so blind,\" she cried, \"as not to see what this means? Can\nyou not understand? Do you not know your worst enemy?\"\n\n\"My worst enemy?\" I echoed amazed--\"You surprise me, Mavis,--what have\nI, or my enemies or friends to do with my wife's last confession? She\nraved,--between poison and passion, she could not tell, as you see by\nher final words, whether she was dead or alive,--and her writing at all\nunder such stress of circumstances was a phenomenal effort,--but it has\nnothing to do with me personally.\"\n\n\"For God's sake do not be so hard-hearted!\"--said Mavis\npassionately--\"To me these last words of Sibyl's,--poor, tortured,\nmiserable girl!--are beyond all expression horrible and appalling. Do\nyou mean to tell me you have no belief in a future life?\"\n\n\"None.\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"Then this is nothing to you?--this solemn assurance of hers that she\nis not dead, but living again,--living too, in indescribable\nmisery!--you do not believe it?\"\n\n\"Does anyone believe the ravings of the dying!\" I answered--\"She was, as\nI have said, suffering the torments of poison and passion,--and in those\ntorments wrote as one tormented....\"\n\n\"Is it impossible to convince you of the truth?\" asked Mavis\nsolemnly,--\"Are you so diseased in your spiritual perceptions as not to\n_know_, beyond a doubt, that this world is but the shadow of the Other\nWorlds awaiting us? I assure you, as I live, you will have that terrible\nknowledge forced upon you some day! I am aware of your theories,--your\nwife had the same beliefs or rather non-beliefs as yourself,--yet _she_\nhas been convinced at last! I shall not attempt to argue with you. If\nthis last letter of the unhappy girl you wedded cannot open your eyes to\nthe eternal facts you choose to ignore, nothing will ever help you. You\nare in the power of your enemy!\"\n\n\"Of whom are you speaking, Mavis?\" I asked astonished, observing that\nshe stood like one suddenly appalled in a dream, her eyes fixed musingly\non vacancy, and her lips trembling apart.\n\n\"Your Enemy--your Enemy!\" she repeated with energy--\"It seems to me as\nif his Shadow stood near you now! Listen to this voice from the\ndead--Sibyl's voice!----what does she say?----'_Oh God, have mercy!----I\nknow who claims my worship now and drags me into yonder rolling world of\nflame ... his name is--_'\" ...\n\n\"Well!\" I interrupted eagerly----\"She breaks off there; his name is----\"\n\n\"Lucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez!\" said Mavis in a thrilling tone--\"I do not know from\nwhence he came,--but I take God to witness my belief that he is a worker\nof evil,--a fiend in beautiful human shape,--a destroyer and a\ncorrupter! The curse of him fell on Sibyl the moment she met him,--the\nsame curse rests on you! Leave him if you are wise,--take your chance of\nescape while it remains to you,--and never let him see your face\nagain!\"\n\nShe spoke with a kind of breathless haste as though impelled by a force\nnot her own,--I stared at her amazed, and in a manner irritated.\n\n\"Such a course of action would be impossible to me, Mavis,\"--I said\nsomewhat coldly--\"The Prince Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez is my best friend--no man ever had\na better;--and his loyalty to me has been put to a severe test under\nwhich most men would have failed. I have not told you all.\"\n\nAnd I related in a few words the scene I had witnessed between my wife\nand Lucio in the music-gallery at Willowsmere. She listened,--but with\nan evident effort,--and pushing back her clustering hair from her brows\nshe sighed heavily.\n\n\"I am sorry,--but it does not alter my conviction!\"--she said--\"I look\nupon your best friend as your worst foe. And I feel you do not realize\nthe awful calamity of your wife's death in its true aspect. Will you\nforgive me if I ask you to leave me now?----Lady Sibyl's letter has\naffected me terribly--I feel I cannot speak about it any more.... I wish\nI had not read it....\"\n\nShe broke off with a little half-suppressed sob,--I saw she was\nunnerved, and taking the manuscript from her hand, I said\nhalf-banteringly--\n\n\"You cannot then suggest an epitaph for my wife's monument?\"\n\nShe turned upon me with a grand gesture of reproach.\n\n\"Yes I can!\"--she replied in a low indignant voice--\"Inscribe it\nas--'From a pitiless hand to a broken heart!' That will suit the dead\ngirl,--and you, the living man!\"\n\nHer rustling gown swept across my feet,--she passed me and was gone.\nStupefied by her sudden anger, and equally sudden departure, I stood\ninert,--the St Bernard rose from the hearth-rug and glowered at me\nsuspiciously, evidently wishing me to take my leave,--Pallas Athene\nstared, as usual, through me and beyond me in a boundless scorn,--all\nthe various objects in this quiet study seemed silently to eject me as\nan undesired occupant. I looked round it once longingly as a tired\noutcast may look on a peaceful garden and wish in vain to enter.\n\n\"How like her sex she is after all!\" I said half aloud--\"She blames _me_\nfor being pitiless,--and forgets that Sibyl was the sinner,--not I! No\nmatter how guilty a woman may be, she generally manages to secure a\ncertain amount of sympathy,--a man is always left out in the cold.\"\n\nA shuddering sense of loneliness oppressed me as my eyes wandered round\nthe restful room. The odour of lilies was in the air, exhaled, so I\nfancied, from the delicate and dainty personality of Mavis herself.\n\n\"If I had only known her first,--and loved her!\" I murmured, as I turned\naway at last and left the house.\n\nBut then I remembered I had hated her before I ever met her,--and not\nonly had I hated her, but I had vilified and misrepresented her work\nwith a scurrilous pen under the shield of anonymity, and out of sheer\nmalice,--thus giving her in the public sight, the greatest proof of her\nown genius a gifted woman can ever win,--man's envy!\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nTwo weeks later I stood on the deck of Lucio's yacht 'The Flame,'--a\nvessel whose complete magnificence filled me, as well as all other\nbeholders, with bewildered wonderment and admiration. She was a miracle\nof speed, her motive power being electricity; and the electric engines\nwith which she was fitted were so complex and remarkable as to baffle\nall would-be inquirers into the secret of their mechanism and potency. A\nlarge crowd of spectators gathered to see her as she lay off\nSouthampton, attracted by the beauty of her shape and appearance,--some\nbolder spirits even came out in tugs and row-boats, hoping to be allowed\nto make a visit of inspection on board, but the sailors,\npowerfully-built men of a foreign and somewhat unpleasing type, soon\nintimated that the company of such inquisitive persons was undesirable\nand unwelcome. With white sails spread, and a crimson flag flying from\nher mast, she weighed anchor at sunset on the afternoon of the day her\nowner and I joined her, and moving through the waters with delicious\nnoiselessness and incredible rapidity, soon left far behind her the\nEnglish shore, looking like a white line in the mist, or the pale vision\nof a land that might once have been. I had done a few quixotic things\nbefore departing from my native country,--for example, I had made a free\ngift of his former home Willowsmere, to Lord Elton, taking a sort of\nsullen pleasure in thinking that he, the spendthrift nobleman, owed the\nrestoration of his property to _me_,--to me who had never been either a\nsuccessful linen-draper or furniture-man, but simply an author, one of\n'those sort of people' whom my lord and my lady imagine they can\n'patronize' and neglect again at pleasure without danger to themselves.\nThe arrogant fools invariably forget what lasting vengeance can be taken\nfor an unmerited slight by the owner of a brilliant pen! I was glad too,\nin a way, to realize that the daughter of the American railway-king\nwould be brought to the grand old house to air her 'countess-ship,' and\nlook at her prettily pert little physiognomy in the very mirror where\nSibyl had watched herself die. I do not know why this idea pleased me,\nfor I bore no grudge against Diana Chesney,--she was vulgar but\nharmless, and would probably make a much more popular ch\u00c3\u00a2telaine at\nWillowsmere Court than my wife had ever been. Among other things, I\ndismissed my man Morris, and made him miserable,--with the gift of a\nthousand pounds, to marry and start a business on. He was miserable\nbecause he could not make up his mind what business to adopt, his\nanxiety being to choose the calling that would 'pay' best,--and also,\nbecause though he 'had his eye' upon several young women, he could not\ntell which among them would be likely to be least extravagant, and the\nmost serviceable as a cook and housekeeper. The love of money and the\npains of taking care of it, embittered his days as it embitters the days\nof most men, and my unexpected munificence towards him burdened him with\nsuch a weight of trouble as robbed him of natural sleep and appetite. I\ncared nothing for his perplexities however, and gave him no advice, good\nor bad. My other servants I dismissed, each with a considerable gift of\nmoney, not that I particularly wished to benefit _them_, but simply\nbecause I desired them to speak well of _me_. And in this world it is\nvery evident that the only way to get a good opinion is to pay for it! I\ngave orders to a famous Italian sculptor for Sibyl's monument, English\nsculptors having no conception of sculpture,--it was to be of exquisite\ndesign, wrought in purest white marble, the chief adornment being the\ncentre-figure of an angel ready for flight, with the face of Sibyl\nfaithfully copied from her picture. Because, however devilish a woman\nmay be in her life-time, one is bound by all the laws of social\nhypocrisy to make an angel of her as soon as she is dead! Just before I\nleft London I heard that my old college-friend 'Boffles,' John\nCarrington, had met with a sudden end. Busy at the 'retorting' of his\ngold, he had been choked by the mercurial fumes and had died in hideous\ntorment. At one time this news would have deeply affected me, but now, I\nwas scarcely sorry. I had heard nothing of him since I had come into my\nfortune,--he had never even written to congratulate me. Always full of\nmy own self-importance, I judged this as great neglect on his part, and\nnow that he was dead I felt no more than any of us feel now-a-days at\nthe loss of friends. And that is very little,--we have really no time to\nbe sorry,--so many people are always dying!--and we are in such a\ndesperate hurry to rush on to death ourselves! Nothing seemed to touch\nme that did not closely concern my own personal interest,--and I had no\naffections left, unless I may call the vague tenderness I had for Mavis\nClare an affection. Yet, to be honest, this very emotion was after all\nnothing but a desire to be consoled, pitied and loved by her,--to be\nable to turn upon the world and say \"This woman whom you have lifted on\nyour shield of honour and crowned with laurels,--she loves _me_--she is\nnot yours, but _mine_!\" Purely interested and purely selfish was the\nlonging,--and it deserved no other name than selfishness.\n\nMy feelings for Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez too began at this time to undergo a curious\nchange. The fascination I had for him, the power he exercised over me\nremained as great as ever, but I found myself often absorbed in a close\nstudy of him, strangely against my own will. Sometimes his every look\nseemed fraught with meaning,--his every gesture suggestive of an almost\nterrific authority. He was always to me the most attractive of\nbeings,--nevertheless there was an uneasy sensation of doubt and fear\ngrowing up in my mind regarding him,--a painful anxiety to know more\nabout him than he had ever told me,--and on rare occasions I experienced\na sudden shock of inexplicable repulsion against him which like a\ntremendous wave threw me back with violence upon myself and left me\nhalf-stunned with a dread of I knew not what. Alone with him, as it\nwere, on the wide sea, cut off for a time from all other intercourse\nthan that which we shared together, these sensations were very strong\nupon me. I began to note many things which I had been too blind or too\nabsorbed in my own pursuits to observe before; the offensive presence of\nAmiel, who acted as chief steward on board the yacht, filled me now not\nonly with dislike, but nervous apprehension,--the dark and more or less\nrepulsive visages of the crew haunted me in my dreams;--and one day,\nleaning over the vessel's edge and gazing blankly down into the\nfathomless water below, I fell to thinking of strange sorceries of the\nEast, and stories of magicians who by the exercise of unlawful science\ndid so make victims of men and delude them that their wills were\nentirely perverted and no longer their own. I do not know why this\npassing thought should have suddenly overwhelmed me with deep\ndepression,--but when I looked up, to me the sky had grown dark, and the\nface of one of the sailors who was near me polishing the brass\nhand-rail, seemed singularly threatening and sinister. I moved to go to\nthe other side of the deck, when a hand was gently laid on my shoulder\nfrom behind, and turning, I met the sad and splendid eyes of Lucio.\n\n\"Are you growing weary of the voyage Geoffrey?\" he asked--\"Weary of\nthose two suggestions of eternity--the interminable sky, the\ninterminable sea? I am afraid you are!--man easily gets fatigued with\nhis own littleness and powerlessness when he is set afloat on a plank\nbetween air and ocean. Yet we are travelling as swiftly as electricity\nwill bear us,--and, as worked in this vessel, it is carrying us at a far\ngreater speed than you perhaps realize or imagine.\"\n\nI made no immediate answer, but taking his arm strolled slowly up and\ndown. I felt he was looking at me, but I avoided meeting his gaze.\n\n\"You have been thinking of your wife?\" he queried softly and, as I\nthought, sympathetically--\"I have shunned,--for reasons you know\nof,--all allusion to the tragic end of so beautiful a creature. Beauty\nis, alas!--so often subject to hysteria! Yet--if you had any faith, you\nwould believe she is an angel now!\"\n\nI stopped short at this, and looked straight at him. There was a fine\nsmile on his delicate mouth.\n\n\"An angel!\" I repeated slowly--\"or a devil? Which would you say she\nis?--you, who sometimes declare that you believe in Heaven,--and Hell?\"\n\nHe was silent, but the dreamy smile remained still on his lips.\n\n\"Come, speak!\" I said roughly--\"You can be frank with me, you\nknow,--angel or devil--which?\"\n\n\"My dear Geoffrey!\" he remonstrated gently and with gravity--\"A woman is\nalways an angel,--both here and hereafter!\"\n\nI laughed bitterly. \"If that is part of your faith I am sorry for you!\"\n\n\"I have not spoken of my faith,\"--he rejoined in colder accents, lifting\nhis brilliant eyes to the darkening heaven--\"I am not a Salvationist,\nthat I should bray forth a creed to the sound of trump and drum.\"\n\n\"All the same, you _have_ a creed;\"--I persisted--\"And I fancy it must\nbe a strange one! If you remember, you promised to explain it to me----\"\n\n\"Are you ready to receive such an explanation?\" he asked in a somewhat\nironical tone--\"No, my dear friend!--permit me to say you are _not_\nready--not yet! My beliefs are too positive to be brought even into\ncontact with your contradictions,--too frightfully real to submit to\nyour doubts for a moment. You would at once begin to revert to the puny,\nused-up old arguments of Voltaire, Schopenhauer and Huxley,--little\natomic theories like grains of dust in the whirlwind of My knowledge! I\ncan tell you I believe in God as a very Actual and Positive Being,--and\nthat is presumably the first of the Church articles.\"\n\n\"You believe in God!\" I echoed his words, staring at him stupidly. He\nseemed in earnest. In fact he had always seemed in earnest on the\nsubject of Deity. Vaguely I thought of a woman in society whom I\nslightly knew,--an ugly woman, unattractive and mean-minded, who passed\nher time in entertaining semi-Royalties and pushing herself amongst\nthem,--she had said to me one day--[4] \"I hate people who believe in\nGod, don't you? The idea of a God makes me _sick_!\"\n\n\"You believe in God!\" I repeated again dubiously.\n\n\"Look!\" he said, raising his hand towards the sky--\"There a few drifting\nclouds cover millions of worlds, impenetrable, mysterious, yet\n_actual_;--down there--\" and he pointed to the sea, \"lurk a thousand\nthings of which, though the ocean is a part of earth, human beings have\nnot yet learned the nature. Between these upper and lower spaces of the\nIncomprehensible yet Absolute, you, a finite atom of limited\ncapabilities stand, uncertain how long the frail thread of your life\nshall last, yet arrogantly balancing the question with your own poor\nbrain, as to whether you,--_you_ in your utter littleness and\nincompetency shall condescend to accept a God or not! I confess, that of\nall astonishing things in the Universe, this particular attitude of\nmodern mankind is the most astonishing to me!\"\n\n\"Your own attitude is?----\"\n\n\"The reluctant acceptance of such terrific knowledge as is forced upon\nme,--\" he replied with a dark smile--\"I do not say I have been an apt or\na willing pupil,--I have had to suffer in learning what I know!\"\n\n\"Do you believe in hell?\" I asked him suddenly--\"And in Satan, the\nArch-Enemy of mankind?\"\n\nHe was silent for so long that I was surprised, the more so as he grew\npale to the lips, and a curious, almost deathlike rigidity of feature\ngave his expression something of the ghastly and terrible. After a pause\nhe turned his eyes upon me,--an intense burning misery was reflected in\nthem, though he smiled.\n\n\"Most assuredly I believe in hell! How can I do otherwise if I believe\nin heaven? If there is an Up there must be a Down; if there is Light,\nthere must also be Darkness! And, ... concerning the Arch-Enemy of\nmankind,--if half the stories reported of him be true, he must be the\nmost piteous and pitiable figure in the Universe! What would be the\nsorrows of a thousand million worlds, compared to the sorrows of Satan!\"\n\n\"Sorrows!\" I echoed--\"He is supposed to rejoice in the working of evil!\"\n\n\"Neither angel nor devil can do that,\"--he said slowly--\"To rejoice in\nthe working of evil is a temporary mania which affects man only. For\nactual joy to come out of evil, Chaos must come again, and God must\nextinguish Himself.\" He stared across the dark sea,--the sun had sunk,\nand one faint star twinkled through the clouds. \"And so I again say--the\nsorrows of Satan! Sorrows immeasurable as eternity itself,--imagine\nthem! To be shut out of Heaven!--to hear all through the unending \u00c3\u00a6ons,\nthe far-off voices of angels whom once he knew and loved!--to be a\nwanderer among deserts of darkness, and to pine for the light celestial\nthat was formerly as air and food to his being,--and to know that Man's\nfolly, Man's utter selfishness, Man's cruelty, keep him thus exiled, an\noutcast from pardon and peace! Man's nobleness may lift the Lost Spirit\nalmost within reach of his lost joys,--but Man's vileness drags him down\nagain,--easy was the torture of Sisyphus compared with the torture of\nSatan! No wonder that he loathes Mankind!--small blame to him if he\nseeks to destroy the puny tribe eternally,--little marvel that he\ngrudges them their share of immortality! Think of it as a legend\nmerely,\"--and he turned upon me with a movement that was almost\nfierce--\"Christ redeemed Man,--and by his teaching, showed how it was\npossible for Man to redeem the Devil!\"\n\n\"I do not understand you--\" I said feebly, awed by the strange pain and\npassion of his tone.\n\n\"Do you not? Yet my meaning is scarcely obscure! If men were true to\ntheir immortal instincts and to the God that made them,--if they were\ngenerous, honest, fearless, faithful, reverent, unselfish, ... if women\nwere pure, brave, tender and loving,--can you not imagine that in the\nstrong force and fairness of such a world, 'Lucifer, son of the Morning'\nwould be moved to love instead of hate?--that the closed doors of\nParadise would be unbarred--and that he, lifted towards his Creator on\nthe prayers of pure lives, would wear again his Angel's crown? Can you\nnot realize this, even by way of a legendary story?\"\n\n\"Why yes, as a legendary story the idea is beautiful,\"--I admitted--\"And\nto me, as I told you once before, quite new. Still, as men are never\nlikely to be honest or women pure, I'm afraid the poor devil stands a\nbad chance of ever getting redeemed!\"\n\n\"I fear so too!\" and he eyed me with a curious derision--\"I very much\nfear so! And his chances being so slight, I rather respect him for being\nthe Arch-Enemy of such a worthless race!\" He paused a moment, then\nadded--\"I wonder how we have managed to get on such an absurd subject of\nconversation? It is dull and uninteresting as all 'spiritual' themes\ninvariably are. My object in bringing you out on this voyage is not to\nindulge in psychological argument, but to make you forget your troubles\nas much as possible, and enjoy the present while it lasts.\"\n\nThere was a vibration of compassionate kindness in his voice which at\nonce moved me to an acute sense of self-pity, the worst enervator of\nmoral force that exists. I sighed heavily.\n\n\"Truly I have suffered\"--I said--\"More than most men!\"\n\n\"More even than most millionaires deserve to suffer!\" declared Lucio,\nwith that inevitable touch of sarcasm which distinguished some of his\nfriendliest remarks--\"Money is supposed to make amends to a man for\neverything,--and even the wealthy wife of a certain Irish 'patriot' has\nnot found it incompatible with affection to hold her moneybags close to\nherself while her husband has been declared a bankrupt. How she has\n'idolized' him, let others say! Now, considering _your_ cash-abundance,\nit must be owned the fates have treated you somewhat unkindly!\"\n\nThe smile that was half-cruel and half-sweet radiated in his eyes as he\nspoke,--and again a singular revulsion of feeling against him moved me\nto dislike and fear. And yet,--how fascinating was his company! I could\nnot but admit that the voyage with him to Alexandria on board 'The\nFlame' was one of positive enchantment and luxury all the way. There was\nnothing in a material sense left to wish for,--all that could appeal to\nthe intelligence or the imagination had been thought of on board this\nwonderful yacht which sped like a fairy ship over the sea. Some of the\nsailors were skilled musicians, and on tranquil nights or at sunset,\nwould bring stringed instruments and discourse to our ears the most\ndulcet and ravishing melodies. Lucio himself too would often sing,--his\nluscious voice resounding, as it seemed, over all the visible sea and\nsky, with such passion as might have drawn an angel down to listen.\nGradually my mind became impregnated with these snatches of mournful,\nfierce, or weird minor tunes,--and I began to suffer in silence from an\ninexplicable depression and foreboding sense of misery, as well as from\nanother terrible feeling to which I could scarcely give a name,--a\ndreadful _uncertainty of myself_, as of one lost in a wilderness and\nabout to die. I endured these fits of mental agony alone,--and in such\ndreary burning moments, believed I was going mad. I grew more and more\nsullen and taciturn, and when we at last arrived at Alexandria I was not\nmoved to any particular pleasure. The place was new to me, but I was not\nconscious of novelty,--everything seemed flat, dull, and totally\nuninteresting. A heavy almost lethargic stupor chained my wits, and when\nwe left the yacht in harbour and went on to Cairo, I was not sensible of\nany personal enjoyment in the journey, or interest in what I saw. I was\nonly partially roused when we took possession of a luxurious dahabeah,\nwhich, with a retinue of attendants, had been specially chartered for\nus, and commenced our lotus-like voyage up the Nile. The reed-edged,\nsluggish yellow river fascinated me,--I used to spend long hours\nreclining at full length in a deck-chair, gazing at the flat shores, the\nblown sand-heaps, the broken columns and mutilated temples of the dead\nkingdoms of the past. One evening, thus musing, while the great golden\nmoon climbed languidly up into the sky to stare at the wrecks of earthly\nages I said--\n\n\"If one could only see these ancient cities as they once existed, what\nstrange revelations might be made! Our modern marvels of civilization\nand progress might seem small trifles after all,--for I believe in our\ndays we are only re-discovering what the peoples of old time knew.\"\n\nLucio drew his cigar from his mouth and looked at it meditatively. Then\nhe glanced up at me with a half-smile--\n\n\"Would you like to see a city resuscitated?\" he inquired--\"Here, in this\nvery spot, some six thousand years ago, a king reigned, with a woman not\nhis queen but his favourite, (quite a lawful arrangement in those days)\nwho was as famous for her beauty and virtue, as this river is for its\nfructifying tide. Here civilization had progressed enormously,--with the\none exception that it had not outgrown faith. Modern France and England\nhave beaten the ancients in their scorn of God and creed, their contempt\nfor divine things, their unnameable lasciviousness and blasphemy. This\ncity\"----and he waved his hand towards a dreary stretch of shore where a\ncluster of tall reeds waved above the monster fragment of a fallen\ncolumn,--\"was governed by the strong pure faith of its people more than\nanything,--and the ruler of social things in it was a woman. The king's\nfavourite was something like Mavis Clare in that she possessed\ngenius,--she had also the qualities of justice, intelligence, love,\ntruth and a most noble unselfishness,--she made this place happy. It was\na paradise on earth while she lived,--when she died, its glory ended. So\nmuch can a woman do if she chooses,--so much does she _not_ do, in her\nusual cow-like way of living!\"\n\n\"How do you know all this you tell me of?\" I asked him.\n\n\"By study of past records\"--he replied--\"I read what modern men declare\nthey have no time to read. You are right in the idea that all 'new'\nthings are only old things re-invented or re-discovered,--if you had\ngone a step further and said that some of men's present lives are only\nthe continuation of their past, you would not have been wrong. Now, if\nyou like, I can by my science, show you the city that stood here long\nago,--the 'City Beautiful' as its name is, translated from the ancient\ntongue.\"\n\nI roused myself from my lounging attitude and looked at him amazedly. He\nmet my gaze unmoved.\n\n\"You can show it to me!\" I exclaimed--\"How can you do such an impossible\nthing?\"\n\n\"Permit me to hypnotize you,\"--he answered smiling,--\"My system of\nhypnotism is, very fortunately, not yet discovered by meddlesome\ninquirers into occult matters,--but it never fails of its effect,--and I\npromise you, you shall, under my influence, see not only the place, but\nthe people.\"\n\nMy curiosity was strongly excited, and I became more eager to try the\nsuggested experiment than I cared to openly show. I laughed however,\nwith affected indifference.\n\n\"I am perfectly willing!\" I said--\"All the same, I don't think you can\nhypnotize me,--I have much too strong a will of my own----\" at which\nremark I saw a smile, dark and saturnine, hover on his lips--\"But you\ncan make the attempt.\"\n\nHe rose at once, and signed to one of our Egyptian servants.\n\n\"Stop the dahabeah, Azimah,\" he said--\"We will rest here for the night.\"\n\nAzimah, a superb-looking Eastern in picturesque white garments, put his\nhands to his head in submission and retired to give the order. In\nanother few moments the dahabeah had stopped. A great silence was around\nus,--the moonlight fell like yellow wine on the deck,--in the far\ndistance across the stretches of dark sand, a solitary column towered so\nclear-cut against the sky that it was almost possible to discern upon it\nthe outline of a monstrous face. Lucio stood still, confronting\nme,--saying nothing, but looking me steadily through and through, with\nthose wonderful mystic, melancholy eyes that seemed to penetrate and\nburn my very flesh. I was attracted as a bird might be by the basilisk\neyes of a snake,--yet I tried to smile and say something indifferent. My\nefforts were useless,--personal consciousness was slipping from me\nfast,--the sky, the water and the moon whirled round each other in a\ngiddy chase for precedence;--I could not move, for my limbs seemed\nfastened to my chair with weights of iron, and I was for a few minutes\nabsolutely powerless. Then suddenly my vision cleared (as I thought)--my\nsenses grew vigorous and alert, ... I heard the sound of solemn marching\nmusic, and there,--there in the full radiance of the moon, with a\nthousand lights gleaming forth from high cupolas, shone the 'City\nBeautiful'!\n\n\n  [4] Said in the author's hearing by one of the 'lady leaders' of\n      'smart' society.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nA vision of majestic buildings, vast, stately and gigantic!----of\nstreets crowded with men and women in white and coloured garments\nadorned with jewels,--of flowers that grew on the roofs of palaces and\nswung from terrace to terrace in loops and garlands of fantastic\nbloom,--of trees, broad-branched and fully leafed,--of marble\nembankments overlooking the river,--of lotus-lilies growing thickly\nbelow, by the water's edge,--of music that echoed in silver and brazen\ntwangings from the shelter of shady gardens and covered\nbalconies,--every beautiful detail rose before me more distinctly than\nan ivory carving mounted on an ebony shield. Just opposite where I stood\nor seemed to stand, on the deck of a vessel in the busy harbour, a wide\navenue extended, opening up into huge squares embellished with strange\nfigures of granite gods and animals,--I saw the sparkling spray of many\nfountains in the moonlight, and heard the low persistent hum of the\nrestless human multitudes that thronged the place as thickly as bees\nclustered in a hive. To the left of the scene I could discern a huge\nbronze gate guarded by sphinxes; there was a garden beyond it, and from\nthat depth of shade a girl's voice, singing a strange wild melody, came\nfloating towards me on the breeze. Meanwhile the marching music I had\nfirst of all caught the echo of, sounded nearer and nearer,--and\npresently I perceived a great crowd approaching with lighted torches and\ngarlands of flowers. Soon I saw a band of priests in brilliant robes\nthat literally blazed with sun-like gems,--they were moving towards the\nriver, and with them came young boys and little children, while on\neither side, maidens white-veiled and rose-wreathed, paced demurely,\nswinging silver censers to and fro. After the priestly procession walked\na regal figure between ranks of slaves and attendants,--I knew it for\nthe King of this 'City Beautiful,' and was almost moved to join in the\nthundering acclamations which greeted his progress. And that snowy\npalanquin, carried by lily-crowned girls, that followed his train,--who\noccupied it? ... what gem of his land was thus tenderly enshrined? I was\nconsumed by an extraordinary longing to know this,--I watched the white\nburden coming nearer to my point of vantage,--I saw the priests arrange\nthemselves in a semi-circle on the river-embankment, the King in their\nmidst, and the surging shouting multitude around,--then came the brazen\nclangour of many bells, intermixed with the rolling of drums and the\nshrilling sound of reed-pipes lightly blown upon,--and, amid the blaze\nof the flaring torches, the White Palanquin was set down upon the\nground. A woman, clad in some silvery glistening tissue, stepped forth\nfrom it like a sylph from the foam of the sea, but----she was veiled,--I\ncould not discern so much as the outline of her features,--and the keen\ndisappointment of this was a positive torture to me. If I could but see\nher, I thought, I should know something I had never hitherto guessed!\n\"Lift, oh lift the shrouding veil, Spirit of the City Beautiful!\" I\ninwardly prayed--\"For I feel I shall read in your eyes the secret of\nhappiness!\"\n\nBut the veil was not withdrawn, ... the music made barbaric clamour in\nmy ears, ... the blaze of strong light and colour blinded me, ... and I\nfelt myself reeling into a dark chaos, where as I imagined, I chased the\nmoon, as she flew before me on silver wings,--then ... the sound of a\nrich baritone trolling out a light song from a familiar modern _opera\nbouffe_ confused and startled me,----and in another second I found\nmyself staring wildly at Lucio, who, lying easily back in his\ndeck-chair, was carolling joyously to the silent night and the blank\nexpanse of sandy shore, in front of which our dahabeah rested\nmotionless. With a cry I flung myself upon him.\n\n\"Where is she?\" I exclaimed--\"_Who_ is she?\"\n\nHe looked at me without replying, and smiling quizzically, released\nhimself from my sudden grasp. I drew back shuddering and bewildered.\n\n\"I saw it all!\" I murmured--\"The city--the priests,--the people--the\nKing!----all but Her face! Why was that hidden from me!\"\n\nAnd actual tears rose to my eyes involuntarily,--Lucio surveyed me with\nevident amusement.\n\n\"What a 'find' you would be to a first-class 'spiritual' impostor\nplaying his tricks in cultured and easily-gulled London society!\" he\nobserved--\"You seem most powerfully impressed by a passing vision!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" I said earnestly \"that what I saw just now was\nthe mere thought of your brain conveyed to mine?\"\n\n\"Precisely!\" he responded--\"I know what the 'City Beautiful' was like,\nand I was able to draw it for you on the canvas of my memory and present\nit as a complete picture to your inward sight. For you _have_ an inward\nsight,--though like most people, you live unconscious of that neglected\nfaculty.\"\n\n\"But--who was She?\" I repeated obstinately.\n\n\"'She' was, I presume, the King's favourite. If she kept her face hidden\nfrom you as you complain, I am sorry!--but I assure you it was not my\nfault! Get to bed, Geoffrey,--you look dazed. You take visions\nbadly,--yet they are better than realities, believe me!\"\n\nSomehow I could not answer him. I left him abruptly and went below to\ntry and sleep, but my thoughts were all cruelly confused, and I began to\nbe more than ever overwhelmed with a sense of deepening terror,--a\nfeeling that I was being commanded, controlled and, as it were, driven\nalong by a force that had in it something unearthly. It was a most\ndistressing sensation,--it made me shrink at times, from the look of\nLucio's eyes,--now and then indeed I almost cowered before him, so\nincreasingly great was the indefinable dread I had of his presence. It\nwas not so much the strange vision of the 'City Beautiful' that had\ninspired this in me,--for after all, that was only a trick of hypnotism,\nas he had said, and as I was content to argue it with myself,--but it\nwas his whole manner that suddenly began to impress me as it had never\nimpressed me before. If any change was slowly taking place in my\nsentiments towards him, so surely it seemed was he changing equally\ntowards me. His imperious ways were more imperial,--his sarcasm more\nsarcastic,--his contempt for mankind more openly displayed and more\nfrequently pronounced. Yet I admired him as much as ever,--I delighted\nin his conversation, whether it were witty, philosophical or cynical,--I\ncould not imagine myself without his company. Nevertheless the gloom on\nmy mind deepened,--our Nile trip became infinitely wearisome to me, so\nmuch so, that almost before we had got half-way on our journey up the\nriver, I longed to turn back again and wished the voyage at an end. An\nincident that occurred at Luxor was more than sufficient to strengthen\nthis desire. We had stayed there for several days exploring the district\nand visiting the ruins of Thebes and Karnac, where they were busy\nexcavating tombs. One afternoon they brought to light a red granite\nsarcophagus intact,--in it was a richly painted coffin which was opened\nin our presence, and was found to contain the elaborately adorned mummy\nof a woman. Lucio proved himself an apt reader of hieroglyphs, and he\ntranslated in brief, and with glib accuracy the history of the corpse as\nit was pictured inside the sepulchral shell.\n\n\"A dancer at the court of Queen Amenartes;\" he announced for the benefit\nof several interested spectators who with myself, stood round the\nsarcophagus--\"Who because of her many sins, and secret guilt which made\nher life unbearable, and her days full of corruption, died of poison\nadministered by her own hand, according to the King's command, and in\npresence of the executioners of law. Such is the lady's\nstory,--condensed;--there are a good many other details of course. She\nappears to have been only in her twentieth year. Well!\" and he smiled as\nhe looked round upon his little audience,--\"We may congratulate\nourselves on having progressed since the days of these over-strict\nancient Egyptians! The sins of dancers are not, with us, taken _au grand\nserieux_! Shall we see what she is like?\"\n\nNo objection was raised by the authorities concerned in the\ndiscoveries,--and I, who had never witnessed the unrolling of a mummy\nbefore, watched the process with great interest and curiosity. As one by\none of the scented wrappings were removed, a long tress of nut-brown\nhair became visible,--then, those who were engaged in the task, used\nmore extreme and delicate precaution, Lucio himself assisting them to\nuncover the face. As this was done, a kind of sick horror stole over\nme,--brown and stiff as parchment though the features were, their\ncontour was recognisable,--and when the whole countenance was exposed to\nview I could almost have shrieked aloud the name of '_Sibyl!_' For it\nwas like her!--dreadfully like!--and as the faint, half-aromatic\nhalf-putrid odours of the unrolled cerements crept towards me on the\nair, I reeled back giddily and covered my eyes. Irresistibly I was\nreminded of the subtle French perfume exhaled from Sibyl's garments when\nI found her dead,--that, and this sickly effluvia were similar! A man\nstanding near me saw me swerve as though about to fall, and caught me on\nhis arm.\n\n\"The sun is too strong for you I fear?\" he said kindly--\"This climate\ndoes not suit everybody.\"\n\nI forced a smile and murmured something about a passing touch of\nvertigo,--then, recovering myself I gazed fearfully at Lucio, who was\nstudying the mummy attentively with a curious smile. Presently stooping\nover the coffin he took out of it a piece of finely wrought gold in the\nshape of a medallion.\n\n\"This, I imagine must be the fair dancer's portrait,\"--he said, holding\nit up to the view of all the eager and exclaiming spectators--\"Quite a\ntreasure-trove! An admirable piece of ancient workmanship, besides\nbeing the picture of a very lovely woman. Do you not think so,\nGeoffrey?\"\n\nHe handed me the medallion,--and I examined it with deadly and\nfascinated interest,--the face was exquisitely beautiful,--but assuredly\nit was the face of Sibyl!\n\nI never remember how I lived through the rest of that day. At night, as\nsoon as I had an opportunity of speaking to Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez alone, I asked him ...\n\n\"Did you see,----did you not recognize? ...\"\n\n\"That the dead Egyptian dancer resembled your late wife?\" he quietly\ncontinued--\"Yes,--I noticed it at once. But that should not affect you.\nHistory repeats itself,--why should not lovely women repeat themselves?\nBeauty always has its double somewhere, either in the past or future.\"\n\nI said no more,--but next morning I was very ill,--so ill that I could\nnot rise from my bed, and passed the hours in restless moaning and\nirritable pain that was not so much physical as mental. There was a\nphysician resident at the hotel at Luxor, and Lucio, always showing\nhimself particularly considerate for my personal comfort, sent for him\nat once. He felt my pulse, shook his head, and after much dubious\npondering, advised my leaving Egypt immediately. I heard his mandate\ngiven with a joy I could scarcely conceal. The yearning I had to get\nquickly away from this 'land of the old gods' was intense and\nfeverish,--I loathed the vast and awful desert silences, where the\nSphinx frowns contempt on the puny littleness of mankind,--where the\nopened tombs and coffins expose once more to the light of day, faces\nthat are the very semblances of those we ourselves have known and loved\nin our time,--and where painted history tells us of just such things as\nour modern newspapers chronicle, albeit in different form. Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez was\nready and willing to carry out the doctor's orders,--and arranged our\nreturn to Cairo and from thence to Alexandria, with such expedition as\nleft me nothing to desire, and filled me with gratitude for his apparent\nsympathy. In as short a time as abundance of cash could make possible,\nwe had rejoined 'The Flame,' and were _en route_, as I thought, for\nFrance or England. We had not absolutely settled our destination, having\nsome idea of coasting along the Riviera,--but my old confidence in\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez being now almost restored, I left this to him for decision,\nsufficiently satisfied in myself that I had not been destined to leave\nmy bones in terror-haunted Egypt. And it was not till I had been about a\nweek or ten days on board, and had made good progress in the recovery of\nmy health, that the beginning of the end of this never-to-be-forgotten\nvoyage was foreshadowed to me in such terrific fashion as nearly plunged\nme into the darkness of death,--or rather let me now say, (having\nlearned my bitter lesson thoroughly) into the fell brilliancy of that\nLife beyond the tomb which we refuse to recognise or realize till we are\nwhirled into its glorious or awful vortex!\n\nOne evening, after a bright day of swift and enjoyable sailing over a\nsmooth and sunlit sea, I retired to rest in my cabin, feeling almost\nhappy. My mind was perfectly tranquil,--my trust in my friend Lucio was\nagain re-established,--and I may add, so was my old arrogant and\nconfident trust in myself. My access to fortune had not, so far, brought\nme either much joy or distinction,--but it was not too late for me yet\nto pluck the golden apples of Hesperides. The various troubles I had\nendured, though of such recent occurrence, began to assume a blurred\nindistinctness in my mind, as of things long past and done with,--I\nconsidered the strength of my financial position again with\nsatisfaction, to the extent of contemplating a second marriage--and that\nmarriage with--Mavis Clare! No other woman should be my wife, I mentally\nswore,--she, and she only should be mine! I foresaw no difficulties in\nthe way,--and full of pleasant dreams and self-delusions I settled\nmyself in my berth, and dropped easily off to sleep. About midnight I\nawoke, vaguely terrified, to see the cabin full of a strong red light\nand fierce glare. My first dazed impression was that the yacht was on\nfire,--the next instant I became paralysed and dumb with horror. Sibyl\nstood before me! ... Sibyl, a wild, strange, tortured writhing figure,\nhalf nude, waving beckoning arms, and making desperate gestures,--her\nface was as I had seen it last in death, livid and hideous, ... her\neyes blazed mingled menace, despair, and warning upon me! Round her a\nliving wreath of flame coiled upwards like a twisted snake, ... her lips\nmoved as though she strove to speak, but no sound came from them,----and\nwhile I yet looked at her, she vanished! I must have lost consciousness\nthen,--for when I awoke it was broad day. But this ghastly visitation\nwas only the first of many such,--and at last, _every night_ I saw her\nthus, sheeted in flame, till I grew well-nigh mad with fear and misery.\nMy torment was indescribable,--yet I said nothing to Lucio, who watched\nme, as I imagined, narrowly,--I took sleeping-draughts in the hope to\nprocure unbroken rest, but in vain,--always I woke at one particular\nmoment, and always I had to face this fiery phantom of my dead wife,\nwith despair in her eyes and an unuttered warning on her lips. This was\nnot all. One day in the full sunlight of a quiet afternoon, I entered\nthe saloon of the yacht alone, and started back amazed to see my old\nfriend John Carrington seated at the table, pen in hand, casting up\naccounts. He bent over his papers closely,--his face was furrowed and\nvery pale,--but so life-like was he, so seemingly substantial that I\ncalled him by name, whereat he looked up,--smiled drearily, and was\ngone! Trembling in every limb I realized that here was another spectral\nterror added to the burden of my days; and sitting down, I tried to\nrally my scattered forces and reason out what was best to be done. There\nwas no doubt I was very ill;--these phantoms were the warning of\nbrain-disease. I must endeavour, I thought, to keep myself well under\ncontrol till I got to England,--there I determined to consult the best\nphysicians, and put myself under their care till I was thoroughly\nrestored.\n\n\"Meanwhile\"--I muttered to myself--\"I will say nothing, ... not even to\nLucio. He would only smile, ... and I should hate him! ...\"\n\nI broke off, wondering at this. For was it possible I should ever hate\nhim? Surely not!\n\nThat night by way of a change, I slept in a hammock on deck, hoping to\ndispel midnight illusions by resting in the open air. But my sufferings\nwere only intensified. I woke as usual, ... to see, not only Sibyl, but\nalso to my deadly fear, the Three Phantoms that had appeared to me in my\nroom in London on the evening of Viscount Lynton's suicide. There they\nwere,--the same, the very same!--only this time all their livid faces\nwere lifted and turned towards me, and though their lips never moved,\nthe word 'Misery!' seemed uttered, for I heard it tolling like a funeral\nbell on the air and across the sea! ... And Sibyl, with her face of death\nin the coils of a silent flame, ... Sibyl smiled at me!----a smile of\ntorture and remorse! ... God!--I could endure it no longer! Leaping from\nmy hammock, I ran towards the vessel's edge, ... one plunge into the\ncool waves, ... ha!--there stood Amiel, with his impenetrable dark face\nand ferret eyes!\n\n\"Can I assist you sir?\" he inquired deferentially.\n\nI stared at him,--then burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Assist me? Why no!--you can do nothing. I want rest, ... and I cannot\nsleep here, ... the air is too close and sulphureous,----the very stars\nare burning hot! ...\" I paused,--he regarded me with his usual gravely\nderisive expression. \"I am going down to my cabin\"--I continued, trying\nto speak more calmly----\"I shall be _alone_ there ... perhaps!\" Again I\nlaughed wildly and involuntarily, and staggered away from him down the\ndeck-stairs, afraid to look back lest I should see those Three Figures\nof fate following me.\n\nOnce safe in my cabin I shut to the door violently, and in feverish\nhaste, seized my case of pistols. I took out one and loaded it. My heart\nwas beating furiously,--I kept my eyes fixed on the ground, lest they\nshould encounter the dead eyes of Sibyl.\n\n\"One click of the trigger--\" I whispered--\"and all is over! I shall be\nat peace,--senseless,--sightless and painless. Horrors can no longer\nhaunt me, ... I shall sleep!\"\n\nI raised the weapon steadily to my right temple, ... when suddenly my\ncabin-door opened, and Lucio looked in.\n\n\"Pardon me!\" he said, as he observed my attitude--\"I had no idea you\nwere busy! I will go away. I would not disturb you for the world!\"\n\nHis smile had something fiendish in its fine mockery;--moved with a\nquick revulsion of feeling I turned the pistol downwards and held its\nmuzzle firmly against the table near me.\n\n\"_You_ say that!\" I exclaimed in acute anguish,--\"_you_ say it--seeing\nme thus! I thought you were my friend!\"\n\nHe looked full at me, ... his eyes grew large and luminous with a\nsplendour of scorn, passion and sorrow intermingled.\n\n\"Did you?\" and again the terrific smile lit up his pale features,--\"You\nwere mistaken! _I am your Enemy!_\"\n\nA dreadful silence followed. Something lurid and unearthly in his\nexpression appalled me, ... I trembled and grew cold with fear.\nMechanically I replaced the pistol in its case,----then I gazed up at\nhim with a vacant wonder and wild piteousness, seeing that his dark and\nfrowning figure seemed to increase in stature, towering above me like\nthe gigantic shadow of a storm-cloud! My blood froze with an unnameable\nsickening terror, ... then, thick darkness veiled my sight, and I\ndropped down senseless!\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nThunder and wild tumult,--the glare of lightning,--the shattering roar\nof great waves leaping mountains high and hissing asunder in\nmid-air,--to this fierce riot of savage elements let loose in a whirling\nboisterous dance of death, I woke at last with a convulsive shock.\nStaggering to my feet I stood in the black obscurity of my cabin, trying\nto rally my scattered forces,--the electric lamps were extinguished, and\nthe lightning alone illumined the sepulchral darkness. Frantic shoutings\nechoed above me on deck,--fiend-like yells that sounded now like\ntriumph, now like despair, and again like menace,--the yacht leaped to\nand fro like a hunted stag amid the furious billows, and every frightful\ncrash of thunder threatened, as it seemed, to split her in twain. The\nwind howled like a devil in torment,--it screamed and moaned and sobbed\nas though endowed with a sentient body that suffered acutest\nagony,--anon it rushed downwards with an angry swoop as of wide-flapping\nwings, and at each raging gust I thought the vessel must surely founder.\nForgetting everything but immediate personal danger, I tried to open my\ndoor. It was locked outside!--I was a prisoner! My indignation at this\ndiscovery exceeded every other feeling, and beating with both hands on\nthe wooden panels, I called, I shouted, I threatened, I swore,----all in\nvain! Thrown down twice by the topsy-turvey lurching of the yacht, I\nstill kept up a desperate hammering and calling, striving to raise my\nvoice above the distracting pandemonium of noise that seemed to possess\nthe ship from end to end, but all to no purpose,--and finally, hoarse\nand exhausted, I stopped and leaned against the unyielding door to\nrecover breath and strength. The storm appeared to be increasing in\nforce and clamour,--the lightning was well-nigh incessant, and the\nclattering thunder followed each flash so instantaneously as to leave no\ndoubt but that it was immediately above us. I listened,--and presently\nheard a frenzied cry--\n\n\"Breakers ahead!\" This was followed by peals of discordant laughter.\nTerrified, I strained my ears for every sound,--and all at once some-one\nspoke to me quite closely, as though the very darkness around me had\nfound a tongue.\n\n\"Breakers ahead! Throughout the world, storm and danger and doom! Doom\nand Death!--but afterwards--Life!\"\n\nA certain intonation in these words filled me with such frantic horror\nthat I fell on my knees in abject misery, and almost prayed to the God I\nhad through all my life disbelieved in and denied. But I was too mad\nwith fear to find words;--the dense blackness,--the horrid uproar of the\nwind and sea,--the infuriated and confused shouting,--all this was to my\nmind as though hell itself had broken loose, and I could only kneel\ndumbly and tremble. Suddenly a swirling sound as of an approaching\nmonstrous whirlwind made itself heard above all the rest of the din,--a\nsound that gradually resolved itself into a howling chorus of thousands\nof voices sweeping along on the gusty blast,----fierce cries were\nmingled with the jarring thunder, and I leapt erect as I caught the\nwords of the clangorous shout--\n\n\"AVE SATHANAS! AVE!\"\n\nRigidly upright, with limbs stiffening for sheer terror, I stood\nlistening,--the waves seemed to roar \"AVE SATHANAS!\"--the wind shrieked\nit to the thunder,--the lightning wrote it in a snaky line of fire on\nthe darkness \"AVE SATHANAS!\" My brain swam round and grew full to\nbursting,--I was going mad,--raving mad surely!--or why should I thus\ndistinctly hear such unmeaning sounds as these? With a sudden access of\nsuperhuman force I threw the whole weight of my body against the door of\nmy cabin in a delirious effort to break it open,--it yielded\nslightly,--and I prepared myself for another rush and similar\nattempt,--when all at once it was flung widely back, admitting a stream\nof pale light, and Lucio, wrapped in heavy shrouding garments,\nconfronted me.\n\n\"Follow me, Geoffrey Tempest,--\" he said in low clear tones--\"Your time\nhas come!\"\n\nAs he spoke, all self-possession deserted me,--the terrors of the storm,\nand now the terror of his presence, overwhelmed my strength, and I\nstretched out my hands to him appealingly, unknowing what I did or said.\n\n\"For God's sake...!\" I began wildly.\n\nHe silenced me by an imperious gesture.\n\n\"Spare me your prayers! For God's sake, for your own sake, and for mine!\nFollow!\"\n\nHe moved before me like a black phantom in the pale strange light\nsurrounding him,--and I, dazzled, dazed and terror-stricken, trod in his\nsteps closely, moved, as it seemed by some volition not my own, till I\nfound myself alone with him in the saloon of the yacht, with the waves\nhissing up against the windows like live snakes ready to sting.\nTrembling and scarcely able to stand I sank on a chair,--he turned round\nand looked at me for a moment meditatively. Then he threw open one of\nthe windows,--a huge wave dashed in and scattered its bitter salt spray\nupon me where I sat,--but I heeded nothing,--my agonised looks were\nfixed on Him,--the Being I had so long made the companion of my days.\nRaising his hand with a gesture of authority he said--\n\n\"Back, ye devils of the sea and wind!--ye which are not God's elements\nbut My servants, the unrepenting souls of men! Lost in the waves, or\nwhirled in the hurricane, whichever ye have made your destiny, get hence\nand cease your clamour! This hour is Mine!\"\n\nPanic-stricken I heard,--aghast I saw the great billows that had\nshouldered up in myriads against the vessel, sink suddenly,--the yelling\nwind dropped, silenced,--the yacht glided along with a smooth even\nmotion as though on a tranquil inland lake,--and almost before I could\nrealize it, the light of the full moon beamed forth brilliantly and fell\nin a broad stream across the floor of the saloon. But in the very\ncessation of the storm the words \"AVE SATHANAS!\" trembled as it were\nupwards to my ears from the underworld of the sea, and died away in\ndistance like a parting echo of thunder. Then Lucio faced me,--with what\na countenance of sublime and awful beauty!\n\n\"Do you know Me now, man whom my millions of dross have made\nwretched?--or do you need me to tell you WHO I am?\"\n\nMy lips moved,--but I could not speak; the dim and dreadful thought that\nwas dawning on my mind seemed as yet too frenzied, too outside the\nboundaries of material sense for mortal utterance.\n\n\"Be dumb,--be motionless!--but hear and feel!\" he continued--\"By the\nsupreme power of God,--for there is no other power in any world or any\nheaven,--I control and command you at this moment, your own will being\nset aside for once as naught! I choose you as one out of millions to\nlearn in this life the lesson that all must learn hereafter;--let every\nfaculty of your intelligence be ready to receive that which I shall\nimpart,--and teach it to your fellow-men if you have a conscience as you\nhave a Soul!\"\n\nAgain I strove to speak,--he seemed so human,--so much my friend still,\nthough he had declared himself my Enemy,----and yet ... what was that\nlambent radiance encircling his brows?--that burning glory steadily\ndeepening and flashing from his eyes?\n\n\"You are one of the world's 'fortunate' men,--\" he went on, surveying me\nstraightly and pitilessly--\"So at least this world judges you, because\nyou can buy its good-will. But the Forces that govern all worlds, do not\njudge you by such a standard,--you cannot buy _their_ good-will, not\nthough all the Churches should offer to sell it you! They regard you as\nyou _are_, stripped soul-naked,--not as you _seem_! They behold in you\na shameless egoist, persistently engaged in defacing their divine Image\nof Immortality,--and for that sin there is no excuse and no escape but\nPunishment. Whosoever prefers Self to God, and in the arrogance of that\nSelf, presumes to doubt and deny God, invites another Power to compass\nhis destinies,--the power of Evil, made evil and kept evil by the\ndisobedience and wickedness of Man alone,--that power whom mortals call\nSatan, Prince of Darkness,--but whom once the angels knew as Lucifer,\nPrince of Light!\" ... He broke off,--paused,--and his flaming regard\nfell full upon me. \"Do you know Me, ... now?\"\n\nI sat a rigid figure of fear, dumbly staring, ... was this man, for he\nseemed man, mad that he should thus hint at a thing too wild and\nterrible for speech?\n\n\"If you do not know Me,--if you do not feel in your convicted soul that\nyou are aware of Me,--it is because you will not know! Thus do I come\nupon men, when they rejoice in their wilful self-blindness and\nvanity!--thus do I become their constant companion, humouring them in\nsuch vices as they best love!--thus do I take on the shape that pleases\n_them_, and fit myself to their humours! _They_ make me what I am;--they\nmould my very form to the fashion of their flitting time. Through all\ntheir changing and repeating eras, they have found strange names and\ntitles for me,--and their creeds and churches have made a monster of\nme,--as though imagination could compass any worse monster than the\nDevil in Man!\"\n\nFrozen and mute I heard, ... the dead silence, and his resonant voice\nvibrating through it, seemed more terrific than the wildest storm.\n\n\"You,--God's work,--endowed as every conscious atom of His creation is\nendowed,--with the infinite germ of immortality;--you, absorbed in the\ngathering together of such perishable trash as you conceive good for\nyourself on this planet,--you dare, in the puny reach of your mortal\nintelligence to dispute and question the everlasting things invisible!\nYou, by the Creator's will, are permitted to see the Natural\nUniverse,--but in mercy to you, the veil is drawn across the\nSuper-natural! For such things as exist there, would break your puny\nearth-brain as a frail shell is broken by a passing wheel,--and because\nyou cannot see, you doubt! You doubt not only the surpassing Love and\nWisdom that keeps you in ignorance till you shall be strong enough to\nbear full knowledge, but you doubt the very fact of such another\nuniverse itself. Arrogant fool!--your hours are counted by Super-natural\ntime!--your days are compassed by Super-natural law!--your every\nthought, word, deed and look must go to make up the essence and shape of\nyour being in Super-natural life hereafter!--and what you _have been_ in\nyour Soul _here_, must and shall be the aspect of your Soul _there_!\nThat law knows no changing!\"\n\nThe light about his face deepened,--he went on in clear accents that\nvibrated with the strangest music.\n\n\"Men make their own choice and form their own futures,\" he said--\"And\nnever let them dare to say they are not _free_ to choose! From the\nuttermost reaches of high Heaven the Spirit of God descended to them as\nMan,--from the uttermost depths of lowest Hell, I, the Spirit of\nRebellion, come,--equally as Man! But the God-in-Man was rejected and\nslain,--I, the Devil-in-Man live on, forever accepted and adored! Man's\nchoice this is--not God's or mine! Were this self-seeking human race\nonce to reject me utterly, I should exist no more as I am,--nor would\nthey exist who are with me. Listen, while I trace your career!--it is a\ncopy of the lives of many men;--and judge how little the powers of\nHeaven can have to do with you!--how much the powers of Hell!\"\n\nI shuddered involuntarily;--dimly I began to realize the awful nature of\nthis unearthly interview.\n\n\"You, Geoffrey Tempest, are a man in whom a Thought of God was once\nimplanted,--that subtle fire or note of music out of heaven called\nGenius. So great a gift is rarely bestowed on any mortal,--and woe\nbetide him, who having received it, holds it as of mere personal value,\nto be used for Self and not for God! Divine laws moved you gently in\nthe right path of study,--the path of suffering, of disappointment, of\nself-denial and poverty,--for only by these things is humanity made\nnoble and trained in the ways of perfection. Through pain and enduring\nlabour the soul is armed for battle, and strengthened for conquest. For\nit is more difficult to bear a victory well, than to endure many\nbuffetings of war! But you,--you resented Heaven's good-will towards\nyou,--the Valley of Humiliation suited you not at all. Poverty maddened\nyou,--starvation sickened you. Yet poverty is better than arrogant\nwealth,--and starvation is healthier than self-indulgence! You could not\nwait,--your own troubles seemed to you enormous,--your own efforts\nlaudable and marvellous,--the troubles and efforts of others were\nnothing to you;--you were ready to curse God and die. Compassionating\nyourself, admiring yourself and none other, with a heart full of\nbitterness, and a mouth full of cursing, you were eager to make quick\nhavoc of both your genius and your soul. For this cause, your millions\nof money came----and,--_so did I_!\"\n\nStanding now full height he confronted me,--his eyes were less\nbrilliant, but, they reflected in their dark splendour a passionate\nscorn and sorrow.\n\n\"O fool!--in my very coming I warned you!--on the very day we met I told\nyou I was not what I seemed! God's elements crashed a menace when we\nmade our compact of friendship! And I,--when I saw the faint last\nstruggle of the not quite torpid soul in you to resist and distrust me,\ndid I not urge you to let that better instinct have its way?\nYou,--jester with the Supernatural!--you,--base scoffer at Christ! A\nthousand hints have been given you,--a thousand chances of doing such\ngood as must have forced me to leave you,--as would have brought me a\nwelcome respite from sorrow,--a moment's cessation of torture!\"\n\nHis brows contracted in a sombre frown,--he was silent a moment,--then\nhe resumed--\n\n\"Now learn from me the weaving of the web you so willingly became\nentangled in! Your millions of money were Mine!--the man that left you\nheir to them, was a wretched miser, evil to the soul's core! By virtue\nof his own deeds he and his dross were Mine! and maddened by the sheer\naccumulation of world's wealth, he slew himself in a fit of frenzy. He\nlives again in a new and much more realistic phase of existence, and\nknows the actual value of mankind's cash-payments! This _you_ have yet\nto learn!\"\n\nHe advanced a step or two, fixing his eyes more steadily upon me.\n\n\"Wealth is like Genius,--bestowed not for personal gratification, but\nfor the benefit of those who lack it. What have _you_ done for your\nfellow-men? The very book you wrote and launched upon the tide of\nbribery and corruption was published with the intention to secure\napplause for Yourself, not to give help or comfort to others. Your\nmarriage was prompted by Lust and Ambition, and in the fair Sensuality\nyou wedded, you got your deserts! No love was in the union,--it was\nsanctified by the blessing of Fashion, but not the blessing of God. You\nhave done without God; so you think! Every act of your existence has\nbeen for the pleasure and advancement of Yourself,--and this is why I\nhave chosen you out to hear and see what few mortals ever hear or see\ntill they have passed the dividing-line between this life and the next.\nI have chosen you because you are a type of the apparently respected and\nunblamable man;--you are not what the world calls a criminal,--you have\nmurdered no-one,--you have stolen no neighbour's goods--, your\nunchastities and adulteries are those of every 'fashionable'\nvice-monger,--and your blasphemies against the Divine are no worse than\nthose of the most approved modern magazine-contributors. You are guilty\nnevertheless of the chief crime of the age--Sensual Egotism--the\nblackest sin known to either angels or devils, because hopeless. The\nmurderer may repent, and save a hundred lives to make up for the one he\nsnatched,--the thief may atone with honest labour,--the adulterer may\nscourge his flesh and do grim penance for late pardon,--the blasphemer\nmay retrieve his blasphemies,--but for the Egoist there is no chance of\nwholesome penitence, since to himself he is perfect, and counts his\nCreator as somewhat inferior. This present time of the world breathes\nEgotism,--the taint of Self, the hideous worship of money, corrodes all\nlife, all thought, all feeling. For vulgar cash, the fairest and noblest\nscenes of Nature are wantonly destroyed without public protest,[5]--the\nearth, created in beauty, is made hideous,--parents and children, wives\nand husbands are ready to slay each other for a little gold,--Heaven is\nbarred out,--God is denied,--and Destruction darkens over this planet,\nknown to all angels as the Sorrowful Star! Be no longer blind,\nmillionaire whose millions have ministered to Self without relieving\nsorrow!----for when the world is totally corrupt,--when Self is\ndominant,--when cunning supersedes honesty,--when gold is man's chief\nambition,--when purity is condemned,--when poets teach lewdness, and\nscientists blasphemy,--when love is mocked, and God forgotten,--the End\nis near! I take My part in that end!--for the souls of mankind are not\ndone with when they leave their fleshly tenements! When this planet is\ndestroyed as a bubble broken in the air, the souls of men and women live\non,--as the soul of the woman you loved lives on,--as the soul of the\nmother who bore her, lives on,--aye!--as all My worshippers live on\nthrough a myriad worlds, a myriad phases, till they learn to shape their\ndestinies for Heaven! And I, with them live on, in many shapes, in many\nways!--when they return to God cleansed and perfect, so shall I\nreturn!--but not till then!\"\n\nHe paused again,--and I heard a faint sighing sound everywhere as of\nwailing voices, and the name \"Ahrimanes!\" was breathed suddenly upon the\nsilence. I started up listening, every nerve strained----Ahrimanes?--or\nRim\u00c3\u00a2nez? I gazed fearfully at him, ... always beautiful, his countenance\nwas now sublime, ... and his eyes shone with a lustrous flame.\n\n\"You thought me friend!\" he said--\"You should have known me Foe! For\neveryone who flatters a man for his virtues, or humours him in his vices\nis that man's worst enemy, whether demon or angel! But you judged me a\nfitting comrade,--hence I was bound to serve you,--I and my followers\nwith me. You had no perception to realize this,--you, supreme scorner of\nthe Supernatural! Little did you think of the terrifying agencies that\nworked the wonders of your betrothal feast at Willowsmere! Little did\nyou dream that fiends prepared the costly banquet and poured out the\nluscious wine!\"\n\nAt this, a smothered groan of horror escaped me,--I looked wildly round\nme, longing to find some deep grave of oblivious rest wherein to fall.\n\n\"Aye!\" he continued--\"The festival was fitted to the time of the world\nto-day!--Society, gorging itself blind and senseless, and attended by a\nretinue from Hell! My servants looked like men!--for truly there is\nlittle difference 'twixt man and devil! 'Twas a brave gathering!--England\nhas never seen so strange a one in all her annals!\"\n\nThe sighing, wailing cries increased in loudness,--my limbs shook under\nme, and all power of thought was paralysed in my brain. He bent his\npiercing looks upon me with a new expression of infinite wonder, pity\nand disdain.\n\n\"What a grotesque creation you men have made of Me!\" he said--\"As\ngrotesque as your conception of God! With what trifling human attributes\nyou have endowed me! Know you not that the changeless, yet ever-changing\nEssence of Immortal Life can take a million million shapes and yet\nremain unalterably the same? Were I as hideous as your Churches figure\nme,--could the eternal beauty with which all angels are endowed, ever\nchange to such loathsomeness as haunts mankind's distorted imaginations,\nperchance it would be well,--for none would make of me their comrade,\nand none would cherish me as friend! As fits each separate human nature,\nso seems my image,--for thus is my fate and punishment commanded. Yet\neven in this mask of man I wear, men own me their superior,--think you\nnot that when the Supreme Spirit of God wore that same mask on earth,\nmen did not know Him for their Master? Yea, they did know!--and knowing,\nmurdered Him,--as they ever strive to murder all divine things as soon\nas their divinity is recognised. Face to face I stood with Him upon the\nmountain-top, and there fulfilled my vow of temptation. Worlds and\nkingdoms, supremacies and powers!----what were they to the Ruler of\nthem all! 'Get thee hence, Satan!' said the golden-sounding\nVoice;--ah!--glorious behest!--happy respite!--for I reached the very\ngate of Heaven that night, and heard the angels sing!\"\n\nHis accents sank to an infinitely mournful cadence.\n\n\"What have your teachers done with me and my eternal sorrows?\" he went\non--\"Have not they, and the unthinking churches, proclaimed a lie\nagainst me, saying that I rejoice in evil? O man to whom, by God's will\nand because the world's end draws nigh, I unveil a portion of the\nmystery of my doom, learn now once and for all, that there is no\npossible joy in evil!--it is the despair and the discord of the\nUniverse,--it is Man's creation,--My torment,--God's sorrow! Every sin\nof every human being adds weight to my torture, and length to my\ndoom,--yet my oath against the world must be kept! I have sworn to\ntempt,--to do my uttermost to destroy mankind,--but man has not sworn to\nyield to my tempting. He is free!--let him resist and I depart;--let him\naccept me, I remain! Eternal Justice has spoken,--Humanity, through the\nteaching of God made human, must work out its own redemption,--and\nMine!\"\n\nHere, suddenly advancing he stretched out his hand,--his figure grew\ntaller, vaster and more majestic.\n\n\"Come with me now!\" he said in a low penetrating voice that sounded\nsweet, yet menacing--\"Come!--for the veil is down for you to-night! You\nshall understand with WHOM you have dwelt so long in your shifting\ncloud-castle of life!--and in What company you have sailed perilous\nseas!--one, who proud and rebellious, like you, errs less, in that he\nowns GOD as his Master!\"\n\nAt these words a thundering crash assailed my ears,--all the windows on\neither side of the saloon flew open, and showed a strange glitter as of\nsteely spears pointed aloft to the moon,-- ... then, ... half-fainting,\nI felt myself grasped and lifted suddenly and forcibly upwards, ... and\nin another moment found myself on the deck of 'The Flame,' held fast as\na prisoner in the fierce grip of hands invisible. Raising my eyes in\ndeadly despair,--prepared for hellish tortures, and with a horrible\nsense of conviction in my soul that it was too late to cry out to God\nfor mercy,--I saw around me a frozen world!--a world that seemed as if\nthe sun had never shone upon it. Thick glassy-green walls of ice pressed\nround the vessel on all sides and shut her in between their inflexible\nbarriers!--fantastic palaces, pinnacles, towers, bridges and arches of\nice formed in their architectural outlines and groupings the semblance\nof a great city,--over all the coldly glistening peaks, the round moon,\nemerald-pale, looked down,--and standing opposite to me against the\nmast, I beheld, ... not Lucio, ... but an Angel!\n\n\n  [5] Witness the destruction of Foyers, to the historical shame and\n      disgrace of Scotland and Scotsmen.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\n\nCrowned with a mystic radiance as of trembling stars of fire, that\nsublime Figure towered between me and the moonlit sky; the face,\nausterely grand and beautiful, shone forth luminously pale,--the eyes\nwere full of unquenchable pain, unspeakable remorse, unimaginable\ndespair! The features I had known so long and seen day by day in\nfamiliar intercourse were the same,--the same, yet transfigured with\nethereal splendour, while shadowed by an everlasting sorrow! Bodily\nsensations I was scarcely conscious of;--only the Soul of me, hitherto\ndormant, was awake and palpitating with fear. Gradually I became aware\nthat others were around me, and looking, I saw a dense crowd of faces,\nwild and wonderful,--imploring eyes were turned upon me in piteous or\nstern agony,--and pallid hands were stretched towards me more in appeal\nthan menace. And I beheld as I gazed, the air darkening, and anon\nlightening with the shadow and the brightness of wings!--vast pinions of\ncrimson flame began to unfurl and spread upwards all round the ice-bound\nvessel,--upwards till their glowing tips seemed well-nigh to touch the\nmoon. And He, my Foe, who leaned against the mast, became likewise\nencircled with these shafted pinions of burning rose, which like\nfinely-webbed clouds coloured by a strong sunset, streamed outward\nflaringly from his dark Form and sprang aloft in a blaze of scintillant\nglory. And a Voice infinitely sad, yet infinitely sweet, struck solemn\nmusic from the frozen silence.\n\n\"Steer onward, Amiel! Onward, to the boundaries of the world!\"\n\nWith every spiritual sense aroused, I glanced towards the steerman's\nwheel,--was _that_ Amiel whom I had instinctively loathed?--that Being,\nstern as a figure of deadliest fate, with sable wings and tortured\ncountenance? If so, I knew him now for a fiend in very truth!--if\nburning horror and endless shame can so transfigure the soul of man! A\nhistory of crime was written in his anguished looks, ... what secret\ntorment racked him no living mortal might dare to guess! With pallid\nskeleton hands he moved the wheel;--and as it turned, the walls of ice\naround us began to split with a noise of thunder.\n\n\"Onward Amiel!\" said the great sad Voice again--\"Onward where never man\nhath trod,--steer on to the world's end!\"\n\nThe crowd of weird and terrible faces grew denser,--the flaming and\ndarkening of wings became thicker than driving storm-clouds rent by\nlightning,--wailing cries, groans and dreary sounds of sobbing echoed\nabout me on all sides, ... again the shattering ice roared like an\nearthquake under the waters, ... and, unhindered by her frozen\nprison-walls, the ship moved on! Dizzily, and as one in a mad dream I\nsaw the great glittering bergs rock and bend forward,--the massive\nice-city shook to its foundations, ... glistening pinnacles dropped and\nvanished, ... towers lurched over, broke and plunged into the sea,--huge\nmountains of ice split up like fine glass, yawning asunder with a green\nglare in the moonlight as the 'Flame' propelled, so it seemed, by the\ndemon-wings of her terrific crew, cut through the frozen passage with\nthe sharpness of a sword and the swiftness of an arrow! Whither were we\nbound? I dared not think,--I deemed myself dead. The world I saw was not\nthe world I knew,--I believed I was in some spirit-land beyond the\ngrave, whose secrets I should presently realize perchance too well!\nOn,--on we went,--I keeping my strained sight fixed for the most part on\nthe supreme Shape that always confronted me,--that Angel-Foe whose eyes\nwere wild with an eternity of sorrows! Face to face with such an\nImmortal Despair, I stood confounded and slain forever in my own\nregard,--a worthless atom, meriting naught but annihilation. The wailing\ncries and groans had ceased,--and we sped on in an awful silence,--while\ncountless tragedies,--unnameable histories,--were urged upon me in the\ndumb eloquence of the dreary faces round me, and the expressive teaching\nof their terrific eyes!\n\nSoon the barriers of ice were passed,--and the 'Flame' floated out\nbeyond them into a warm inland sea, calm as a lake, and bright as silver\nin the broad radiance of the moon. On either side were undulating\nshores, rich with lofty and luxuriant verdure,--I saw the distant hazy\noutline of dusky purple hills,--I heard the little waves plashing\nagainst hidden rocks, and murmuring upon the sand. Delicious odours\nfilled the air;--a gentle breeze blew, ... was this the lost\nParadise?--this semi-tropic zone concealed behind a continent of ice and\nsnow? Suddenly, from the tops of the dark branching trees, came floating\nthe sound of a bird's singing,--and so sweet was the song, so\nheart-whole was the melody, that my aching eyes filled with tears.\nBeautiful memories rushed upon me,--the value and graciousness of\nlife,--life on the kindly sunlit earth,--seemed very dear to my soul!\nLife's opportunities,--its joys, its wonders, its blessings, all\nshowered down upon a thankless race by a loving Creator,--these appeared\nto me all at once as marvellous! Oh for another chance of such life!--to\nredeem the past,--to gather up the wasted gems of lost moments,--to live\nas a man should live, in accordance with the will of God, and in\nbrotherhood with his fellow-men! ... The unknown bird sang on in a\ncadence like that of a mavis in spring, only more tunefully,--surely no\nother woodland songster ever sang half so well! And as its dulcet notes\ndropped roundly one by one upon the mystic silence, I saw a pale\nCreature move out from amid the shadowing of black and scarlet wings,--a\nwhite woman-shape, clothed in her own long hair. She glided to the\nvessel's edge, and there she leaned, with anguished face upturned,--it\nwas the face of Sibyl! And even while I looked upon her, she cast\nherself wildly down upon the deck and wept! My soul was stirred within\nme, ... I saw in very truth all that she might have been,--I realized\nwhat an angel a little guiding love and patience might have made her,\n... and at last I pitied her! I never pitied her before!\n\nAnd now many familiar faces shone upon me like white stars in a mist of\nrain,--all faces of the dead,--all marked with unquenchable remorse and\nsorrow. One figure passed before me drearily, in fetters glistening with\na weight of gold,--I knew him for my college-friend of olden days;\nanother, crouching on the ground in fear, I recognised as him who had\nstaked his last possession at play, even to his immortal soul,--I even\nsaw my father's face, worn and aghast with grief, and trembled lest the\nsacred beauty of Her who had died to give me birth, should find a place\namong these direful horrors. But no!--thank God I never saw\nher!----_her_ spirit had not lost its way to Heaven!\n\nAgain my eyes reverted to the Mover of this mystic scene,--that Fallen\nSplendour whose majestic shape now seemed to fill both earth and sky. A\nfiery glory blazed about him, ... he raised his hand, ... the ship\nstopped,--and the dark Steersman rested motionless on the wheel. Round\nus the moonlit landscape was spread like a glittering dream of\nfairyland,--and still the unknown bird of God sang on with such\nentrancing tenderness as must have soothed hell's tortured souls.\n\n\"Lo, here we pause!\" said the commanding Voice--\"Here, where the\ndistorted shape of Man hath never cast a shadow!--here,--where the\narrogant mind of Man hath never conceived a sin!--here, where the\ngodless greed of Man hath never defaced a beauty, or slain a woodland\nthing!--here, the last spot on earth left untainted by Man's presence!\nHere is the world's end!--when this land is found, and these shores\nprofaned,--when Mammon plants its foot upon this soil,--then dawns the\nJudgment-Day! But, until then, ... here, where only God doth work\nperfection, angels may look down undismayed, and even fiends find\nrest!\"\n\nA solemn sound of music surged upon the air,--and I who had been as one\nin chains, bound by invisible bonds and unable to stir, was suddenly\nliberated. Fully conscious of freedom I still faced the dark gigantic\nfigure of my Foe,--for his luminous eyes were now upon me, and his\npenetrating voice addressed me only.\n\n\"Man, deceive not thyself!\" he said--\"Think not the terrors of this\nnight are the delusion of a dream or the snare of a vision! Thou art\nawake,--not sleeping,--thou art flesh as well as spirit! This place is\nneither hell nor heaven nor any space between,--it is a corner of thine\nown world on which thou livest. Wherefore know from henceforth that the\nSupernatural Universe in and around the Natural is no lie,--but the\nchief Reality, inasmuch as God surroundeth all! Fate strikes thine\nhour,--and in this hour 'tis given thee to choose thy Master. Now, by\nthe will of God, thou seest me as Angel;--but take heed thou forget not\nthat among men I am as Man! In human form I move with all humanity\nthrough endless ages,--to kings and counsellors, to priests and\nscientists, to thinkers and teachers, to old and young, I come in the\nshape their pride or vice demands, and am as one with all. Self finds in\nme another Ego;--but from the pure in heart, the high in faith, the\nperfect in intention, I do retreat with joy, offering naught save\nreverence, demanding naught save prayer! So am I,--so must I ever\nbe,--till Man of his own will releases and redeems me. Mistake me not,\nbut know me!--and choose thy Future for truth's sake and not out of\nfear! Choose and change not in any time hereafter,--this hour, this\nmoment is thy last probation,--choose, I say! Wilt thou serve Self and\nMe? or God only?\"\n\nThe question seemed thundered on my ears, ... shuddering, I looked from\nright to left, and saw a gathering crowd of faces, white, wistful,\nwondering, threatening and imploring,--they pressed about me close, with\nglistening eyes and lips that moved dumbly. And as they stared upon me I\nbeheld another spectral thing,--the image of Myself!--a poor frail\ncreature, pitiful, ignorant, and undiscerning,--limited in both\ncapacity and intelligence, yet full of strange egotism and still\nstranger arrogance; every detail of my life was suddenly presented to me\nas in a magic mirror, and I read my own chronicle of paltry intellectual\npride, vulgar ambition and vulgarer ostentation,--I realised with shame\nmy miserable vices, my puny scorn of God, my effronteries and\nblasphemies; and in the sudden strong repulsion and repudiation of my\nown worthless existence, being and character, I found both voice and\nspeech.\n\n\"GOD only!\" I cried fervently--\"Annihilation at His hands, rather than\nlife without Him! GOD only! I have chosen!\"\n\nMy words vibrated passionately on my own ears, ... and ... even as they\nwere spoken, the air grew misty with a snowy opalescent radiance, ...\nthe sable and crimson wings uplifted in such multitudinous array around\nme, palpitated with a thousand changeful hues, ... and over the face of\nmy dark Foe a light celestial fell like the smile of dawn! Awed and\nafraid I gazed upward, ... and there I saw a new and yet more wondrous\nglory, ... a shining Figure outlined against the sky in such surpassing\nbeauty and vivid brilliancy as made me think the sun itself had risen in\nvast Angel-shape on rainbow pinions! And from the brightening heaven\nthere rang a silver voice, clear as a clarion-call,--\n\n\"_Arise, Lucifer, Son of the Morning! One soul rejects thee,--one hour\nof joy is granted thee! Hence and arise!_\"\n\nEarth, air, and sea blazed suddenly into fiery gold,--blinded and\nstunned, I was seized by compelling hands and held firmly down by a\nforce invisible, ... the yacht was slowly sinking under me! Overwhelmed\nwith unearthly terrors, my lips yet murmured,\n\n\"GOD! God only!\" The heavens changed from gold to crimson--anon to\nshining blue, ... and against this mass of wavering colour that seemed\nto make a jewelled archway of the sky, I saw the Form of him whom I had\nknown as man, swiftly ascend god-like, with flaming pinions and upturned\nglorious visage, like a vision of light in darkness! Around him\nclustered a million winged shapes,--but He, supreme, majestic,\nwonderful, towered high above them all, a very king of splendour, the\nglory round his brows resembling meteor-fires in an Arctic\nmidnight,--his eyes, twin stars, ablaze with such great rapture as\nseemed half agony! Breathless and giddy, I strained my sight to follow\nhim as he fled; ... and heard the musical calling of strange sweet\nvoices everywhere, from east to west, from north to south.\n\n\"Lucifer! ... Belov\u00c3\u00abd and unforgotten! Lucifer, Son of the morning!\nArise! ... arise! ...\"\n\nWith all my remaining strength I strove to watch the vanishing upward of\nthat sublime Luminance that now filled the visible universe,--the\ndemon-ship was still sinking steadily, ... invisible hands still held me\ndown, ... I was falling,--falling,--into unimaginable depths, ... when\nanother Voice, till then unheard, solemn yet sweet, spoke aloud--\n\n\"Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outermost darkness of the\nworld! There let him find My Light!\"\n\nI heard,--yet felt no fear.\n\n\"God only!\" I said, as I sank into the vast profound,--and lo! while the\nwords yet trembled on my lips, I saw the sun! The sweet earth's\nsun!--the kindly orb familiar,--the lamp of God's protection,--its\ngolden rim came glittering upwards in the east,--higher and higher it\nrose, making a shining background for that mighty Figure, whose darkly\nluminous wings now seemed like sable storm-clouds stretched wide across\nthe horizon! Once more ... yet once, ... the Angel-visage bent its\nwarning looks on me, ... I saw the anguished smile, ... the great eyes\nburning with immortal sorrows! ... then, I was plunged forcibly\ndownwards and thrust into an abysmal grave of frozen cold.\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\n\nThe blue sea--the blue sky!--and God's sunshine over all! To this I\nwoke, after a long period of unconsciousness, and found myself afloat on\na wide ocean, fast bound to a wooden spar. So strongly knotted were my\nbonds that I could not stir either hand or foot, ... and after one or\ntwo ineffectual struggles to move I gave up the attempt, and lay\nsubmissively resigned to my fate, face upturned and gazing at the\ninfinite azure depths above me, while the heaving breath of the sea\nrocked me gently to and fro like an infant in its mother's arms. Alone\nwith God and Nature, I, a poor human wreck, drifted,----lost, yet found!\nLost on this vast sea which soon should serve my body as a sepulchre,\n... but found, inasmuch as I was fully conscious of the existence and\nawakening of the Immortal Soul within me,--that divine, actual and\nimperishable essence, which now I recognised as being all that is\nvaluable in a man in the sight of his Creator. I was to die, soon and\nsurely;--this I thought, as the billows swayed me in their huge cradle,\nrunning in foamy ripples across my bound body, and dashing cool spray\nupon my brows,--what could I do now, doomed and helpless as I was, to\nretrieve my wasted past? Nothing! save repent,--and could repentance at\nso late an hour fit the laws of eternal justice? Humbly and sorrowfully\nI considered, ... to me had been given a terrific and unprecedented\nexperience of the awful Reality of the Spirit-world around us,--and now\nI was cast out on the sea as a thing worthless, I felt that the brief\ntime remaining to me of life in this present sphere was indeed my \"last\nprobation,\" as that Supernatural Wonder, the declared Enemy of mankind,\nwhom still in my thoughts I called Lucio, had declared.\n\n\"If I dared,--after a life's denial and blasphemy,--turn to Christ!\" I\nsaid--\"Would He,--the Divine Brother and Friend of man,--reject me?\"\n\nI whispered the question to the sky and sea, ... solemn silence seemed\nto invest the atmosphere, and marvellous calm. No other answer came than\nthis, ... a deep and charm\u00c3\u00abd peace, that insensibly stole over my\nfretting conscience, my remorseful soul, my aching heart, my tired mind.\nI remembered certain words heard long ago, and lightly forgotten. \"_Him\nwho cometh unto Me will I in no wise cast out._\" Looking up to the clear\nheavens and radiant sun, I smiled; and with a complete abandonment of\nmyself and my fears to the Divine Will, I murmured the words that in my\nstress of mystic agony had so far saved me,--\n\n\"God only! Whatsoever He shall choose for me in life, in death, and\nafter death, is best.\"\n\nAnd closing my eyes, I resigned my life to the mercy of the soft waves,\nand with the sunbeams warm upon my face, I slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n               *       *       *\n                       *\n\nI woke again with an icy shudder and cry,--rough cheery voices sounded\nin my ears,--strong hands were at work busily unfastening the cords with\nwhich I was bound, ... I was on the deck of a large steamer, surrounded\nby a group of men,--and all the glory of the sunset fired the seas.\nQuestions were poured upon me, ... I could not answer them, for my\ntongue was parched and blistered, ... lifted upright upon my feet by\nsturdy arms, I could not stand for sheer exhaustion. Dimly, and in\nfeeble dread I stared around me,----was this great vessel with smoking\nfunnels and grinding engines another devil's craft set sailing round\nthe world! Too weak to find a voice I made dumb signs of terrified\ninquiry, ... a broad-shouldered bluff-looking man came forward, whose\nkeen eyes rested on me with kindly compassion.\n\n\"This is an English vessel,\" he said--\"We are bound for Southampton. Our\nhelmsman saw you floating ahead,--we stopped and sent a boat for rescue.\nWhere were you wrecked? Any more of the crew afloat?\"\n\nI gazed at him, but could not speak. The strangest thoughts crowded into\nmy brain, moving me to wild tears and laughter. England! The word struck\nclashing music on my mind, and set all my pulses trembling. England! The\nlittle spot upon the little world, most loved and honoured of all men,\nsave those who envy its worth! I made some gesture, whether of joy or\nmad amazement I know not,----had I been able to speak I could have\nrelated nothing that those men around me could have comprehended or\nbelieved, ... then I sank back again in a dead swoon.\n\nThey were very good to me, all those English sailors. The captain gave\nme his own cabin,--the ship's doctor attended me with a zeal that was\nonly exceeded by his curiosity to know where I came from, and the nature\nof the disaster that had befallen me. But I remained dumb, and lay inert\nand feeble in my berth, grateful for the care bestowed upon me, as well\nas for the temporary exhaustion that deprived me of speech. For I had\nenough to do with my own thoughts,--thoughts far too solemn and weighty\nfor utterance. I was saved,--I was given another chance of life in the\nworld,--and _I knew why_! My one absorbing anxiety now was to retrieve\nmy wasted time, and to do active good where hitherto I had done nothing!\n\nThe day came at last, when I was sufficiently recovered to be able to\nsit on deck and watch with eager eyes the approaching coast-line of\nEngland. I seemed to have lived a century since I left it,--aye, almost\nan eternity,--for time is what the Soul makes it, and no more. I was an\nobject of interest and attention among all the passengers on board, for\nas yet I had not broken silence. The weather was calm and bright, ...\nthe sun shone gloriously,--and far off the pearly rim of Shakespeare's\n'happy isle' glistened jewel-like upon the edge of the sea. The captain\ncame and looked at me,--nodded encouragingly,--and after a moment's\nhesitation, said--\n\n\"Glad to see you out on deck! Almost yourself again, eh?\"\n\nI silently assented with a faint smile.\n\n\"Perhaps\"--he continued, \"as we're so near home, you'll let me know your\nname? It's not often we pick up a man alive and drifting in\nmid-Atlantic.\"\n\nIn mid-Atlantic! What force had flung me there I dared not think, ...\nnor whether it was hellish or divine.\n\n\"My name?\" I murmured, surprised into speech,--how odd it was I had\nnever thought of myself lately as having a name or any other thing\nbelonging to me!--\"Why certainly! Geoffrey Tempest is my name.\"\n\nThe captain's eyes opened widely.\n\n\"Geoffrey Tempest! Dear me! ... _The_ Mr Tempest?----the great\nmillionaire that _was_?\"\n\nIt was now my turn to stare.\n\n\"That _was_?\" I repeated--\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Have you not heard?\" he asked excitedly.\n\n\"Heard? I have heard nothing since I left England some months ago--with\na friend, on board his yacht ... we went on a long voyage and ... a\nstrange one! We were wrecked, ... you know the rest, and how I owe my\nlife to your rescue. But of news I am ignorant ...\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he interrupted quickly--\"Bad news travels fast as a rule\nthey say,--but you have missed it ... and I confess I don't like to be\nthe bearer of it ...\"\n\nHe broke off, and his genial face looked troubled. I smiled,--yet\nwondered.\n\n\"Pray speak out!\" I said--\"I don't think you can tell me anything that\nwill deeply affect me,--_now_. I know the best and worst of most things\nin the world, I assure you!\"\n\nHe eyed me dubiously;--then, going into his smoking-cabin, he brought\nme out an American newspaper seven days old. He handed it to me pointing\nto its leading columns without a word. There I saw in large type--\"A\nMillionaire Ruined! Enormous Frauds! Monster Forgeries! Gigantic\nSwindle! On the track of Bentham and Ellis!\"\n\nMy brain swam for a minute,--then I read on steadily, and soon grasped\nthe situation. The respectable pair of lawyers whom I had implicitly\nrelied on for the management of all my business affairs in my absence,\nhad succumbed to the temptation of having so much cash in charge for\ninvestment,--and had become a pair of practised swindlers. Dealing with\nthe same bank as myself, they had forged my name so cleverly that the\ngenuineness of the signature had never been even suspected,--and, after\ndrawing enormous sums in this way, and investing in various 'bubble'\ncompanies with which they personally were concerned, they had finally\nabsconded, leaving me almost as poor as I was when I first heard of my\ninherited fortune. I put aside the paper, and looked up at the good\ncaptain, who stood watching me with sympathetic anxiety.\n\n\"Thank you!\" I said--\"These thieves were my trusted lawyers,--and I can\ncheerfully say that I am much more sorry for them than I am for myself.\nA thief is always a thief,--a poor man, if he be honest, is at any rate\nthe thief's superior. The money they have stolen will bring them misery\nrather than pleasure,--of that I am convinced. If this account be\ncorrect, they have already lost large sums in bogus companies,--and the\nman Bentham, whom I thought the very acme of shrewd caution has sunk an\nenormous amount of capital in a worn-out gold mine. Their forgeries must\nhave been admirably done!--a sad waste of time and cleverness. It\nappears too that the investments I have myself made are\nworthless;--well, well!--it does not matter,--I must begin the world\nagain, that's all!\" He looked amazed.\n\n\"I don't think you quite realize your own misfortune, Mr Tempest\"--he\nsaid--\"You take it too quietly by half. You'll think worse of it\npresently.\"\n\n\"I hope not!\" I responded, with a smile--\"It never does to think the\nworst of anything. I assure you I realize perfectly. I am in the world's\nsight a ruined man,--I quite understand!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders with quite a desperate air, and left me. I am\nconvinced he thought me mad,--but I knew I had never been so sane. I did\nindeed entirely comprehend my 'misfortune,' or rather the great chance\nbestowed on me of winning something far higher than all the coffers of\nMammon; I read in my loss of world's cash the working of such a merciful\nprovidence and pity as gave me a grander hope than any I had ever known.\nClear before me rose the vision of that most divine and beautiful\nnecessity of happiness,--Work!--the grand and too often misprized Angel\nof Labour, which moulds the mind of man, steadies his hands, controls\nhis brain, purifies his passions, and strengthens his whole mental and\nphysical being. A rush of energy and health filled my veins,--and I\nthanked God devoutly for the golden opportunities held out afresh for me\nto accept and use. Gratitude there should be in every human soul for\nevery gift of heaven,--but nothing merits more thankfulness and praise\nto the Creator than the call to work, and the ability to respond to it.\n\nEngland at last! I bade farewell to the good ship that had rescued me,\nand to all on board her, most of whom now knew my name and looked upon\nme with pity as well as curiosity. The story of my being wrecked on a\nfriend's yacht was readily accepted,--and the subject of that adventure\nwas avoided, as the general impression was that my friend, whoever he\nwas, had been drowned with his crew, and that I was the one survivor. I\ndid not offer any further explanation, and was content to so let the\nmatter rest, though I was careful to send both the captain and the\nship's doctor a handsome recompense for their united attention and\nkindness. I have reason to believe, from the letters they wrote me, that\nthey were more than satisfied with the sums received, and that I really\ndid some actual good with those few last fragments of my vanished\nwealth.\n\nOn reaching London, I interviewed the police concerning the thieves and\nforgers, Bentham and Ellis, and stopped all proceedings against them.\n\n\"Call me mad if you like,\"--I said to the utterly confounded chief of\nthe detective force--\"I do not mind! But let these rascals keep the\ntrash they have stolen. It will be a curse to them, as it has been to\nme! It is devil's money! Half of it was already gone, being settled on\nmy late wife,--at her death, it reverted by the same deed of settlement,\nto any living members of her family, and it now belongs to Lord Elton. I\nhave lived to make a noble Earl rich, who was once bankrupt,--and I\ndoubt if he would lend me a ten-pound-note for the asking! However, I\nshall not ask him. The rest has gone into the universal waste of\ncorruption and sham--let it stay there! I shall never bother myself to\nget it back. I prefer to be a free man.\"\n\n\"But the bank,--the principle of the thing!\" exclaimed the detective\nwith indignation.\n\nI smiled.\n\n\"Exactly! The principle of the thing has been perfectly carried out. A\nman who has too much money _creates_ forgers and thieves about him,--he\ncannot expect to meet with honesty. Let the bank prosecute if it\nlikes,--I shall not. I am free!--free to work for my living. What I earn\nI shall enjoy,--what I inherited, I have learnt to loathe!\"\n\nWith that I left him, puzzled and irate,--and in a day or two the papers\nwere full of strange stories concerning me, and numerous lies as well. I\nwas called 'mad,' 'unprincipled,' 'thwarting the ends of justice,'--and\nsundry other names, while scurrilous civilities known only to the penny\nparagraphist were heaped upon me by the score. To complete my entire\nsatisfaction, a man on the staff of one of the leading journals, dug out\nmy book from Mudie's underground cellar, and 'slashed' it with a\nbitterness and venom only excelled by my own violence when anonymously\nlibelling the work of Mavis Clare! And the result was remarkable,--for\nin a sudden wind of caprice, the public made a rush for my neglected\nliterary offspring,--they took it up, handled it tenderly, read it\nlingeringly, found something in it that pleased them, and finally bought\nit by thousands! ... whereat the astute Morgeson, as virtuous publisher,\nwrote to me in wonder and congratulation, enclosing a cheque for a\nhundred pounds on 'royalties,' and promising more in due course, should\nthe 'run' continue. Ah, the sweetness of that earned hundred pounds! I\nfelt a King of independence!--realms of ambition and attainment opened\nout before me,--life smiled upon me as it had never smiled before. Talk\nof poverty! I was rich!----rich with a hundred pounds made out of my own\nbrain-labour,--and I envied no millionaire that ever flaunted his gold\nbeneath the sun! I thought of Mavis Clare, ... but dared not dwell too\nlong upon her gentle image. In time perhaps, ... when I had settled down\nto fresh work, ... when I had formed my life as I meant to form it, in\nthe habits of faith, firmness and unselfishness, I would write to her\nand tell her all,--all, even to that dread insight into worlds unseen,\nbeyond the boundaries of an unknown region of everlasting frozen snow!\nBut now,----now I resolved to stand alone,--fighting my battle as a man\nshould fight, seeking for neither help nor sympathy, and trusting not in\nSelf, but God only. Moreover I could not induce myself yet to look again\nupon Willowsmere. The place was terror-haunted for me; and though Lord\nElton with a curious condescension, (seeing that it was to me he owed\nthe free gift of his former property) invited me to stay there, and\nprofessed a certain lame regret for the 'heavy financial losses' I had\nsustained, I saw in the tone of his epistle that he looked upon me\nsomewhat in the light of a madman after my refusal to take up the matter\nof my absconding solicitors, and that he would rather I stayed away. And\nI did stay away;--and even when his marriage with Diana Chesney took\nplace with great pomp and splendour, I refused his invitation to be\npresent. In the published list of guests, however which appeared in the\nprincipal papers, I was scarcely surprised to read the name of 'Prince\nLucio Rim\u00c3\u00a2nez.'\n\nI now took a humble room and set to work on a new literary enterprise,\navoiding everyone I had hitherto known, for being now almost a poor man,\nI was aware that 'swagger society' wished to blot me from its\nvisiting-list. I lived with my own sorrowful thoughts,--musing on many\nthings, training myself to humility, obedience, and faith with\nfortitude,--and day by day I did battle with the monster, Egotism, that\npresented itself in a thousand disguises at every turn in my own life as\nwell as in the lives of others. I had to re-form my character,--to mould\nthe obstinate nature that rebelled, and make its obstinacy serve for the\nattainment of higher objects than world's renown,--the task was\ndifficult,--but I gained ground a little with every fresh effort.\n\nI had lived for some months like this in bitter self-abasement, when all\nthe reading world was suddenly electrified by another book of Mavis\nClare's. My lately favoured first work was again forgotten and thrust\naside,--hers, slated and screamed at as usual by the criticasters, was\nborne along to fame by a great wave of honest public praise and\nenthusiasm. And I? I rejoiced!--no longer grudging or envious of her\nsweet fame, I stood apart in spirit as it were, while the bright car of\nher triumph went by, decked, not only with laurels, but with roses,--the\nblossoms of a people's love and honour. With all my soul I reverenced\nher genius,--with all my heart I honoured her pure womanliness! And in\nthe very midst of her brilliant success, when all the world was talking\nof her, she wrote to me, a simple little letter, as gracious as her own\nfair name.\n\n    Dear Mr Tempest,\n\n    I heard by chance the other day that you had returned to England. I\n    therefore send this note to the care of your publisher to express my\n    sincere delight in the success your clever book has now attained\n    after its interval of probation. I fancy the public appreciation of\n    your work must go far to console you for the great losses you have\n    had both in life and fortune, of which I will not here speak. When\n    you feel that you can bear to look again upon scenes which I know\n    will be sure to rouse in your mind many sad and poignant memories,\n    will you come and see me?\n\n        Your friend\n            Mavis Clare.\n\nA mist came before my eyes,--I almost felt her gentle presence in my\nroom,--I saw the tender look, the radiant smile,--the innocent yet\nearnest joy in life and love of purity that emanated from the fair\npersonality of the sweetest woman I had ever known. She called herself\nmy friend!--... it was a privilege of which I felt myself unworthy! I\nfolded the letter and put it near my heart to serve me as a talisman,\n... she, of all bright creatures in the world surely knew the secret of\nhappiness! ... Some-day, ... yes, ... I would go and see her, ... my\nMavis that sang in her garden of lilies,--some day when I had force and\nmanliness enough to tell her all,--save my love for her! For that, I\nfelt, must never be spoken,--Self must resist Self, and clamour no more\nat the gate of a forfeited Paradise! Some day I would see her, ... but\nnot for a long time, ... not till I had, in part at least, worked out my\nsecret expiation. As I sat musing thus, a strange memory came into my\nbrain, ... I thought I heard a voice resembling my own, which said--\n\n\"_Lift, oh lift the shrouding veil, spirit of the City Beautiful! For I\nfeel I shall read in your eyes the secret of happiness!_\"\n\nA cold shudder ran through me,--I sprang up erect, in a kind of horror.\nLeaning at my open window I looked down into the busy street below,--and\nmy thoughts reverted to the strange things I had seen in the East,--the\nface of the dead Egyptian dancer, uncovered to the light again after two\nthousand years,--the face of Sibyl!--then I remembered the vision of the\n\"City Beautiful,\" in which one face had remained veiled,--the face I\nmost desired to see!----and I trembled more and more as my mind, despite\nmy will, began to weave together links of the past and present, till\nthey seemed growing into one and the same. Was I again to be the prey of\nevil forces?----did some new danger threaten me?--had I, by some\nunconscious wicked wish invited new temptation to assail me?\n\nOvercome by my sensations, I left my work and went out into the fresh\nair, ... it was late at night,--and the moon was shining. I felt for the\nletter of Mavis,--it pressed against my heart, a shield against all\nvileness. The room I occupied was in a house not far from Westminster\nAbbey, and I instinctively bent my steps towards that grey old shrine of\nkings and poets dead. The square around it was almost deserted,----I\nslackened my pace, strolling meditatively along the narrow paved way\nthat forms a short cut across into Old Palace Yard, ... when suddenly a\nShadow crossed my path, and looking up, I came face to face\nwith----Lucio! The same as ever,--the perfect impersonation of perfect\nmanhood! ... his countenance, pale, proud, sorrowful yet scornful,\nflashed upon me like a star!----he looked full at me, and a questioning\nsmile rested on his lips!\n\nMy heart almost stopped beating, ... I drew a quick sharp breath, ...\nagain I felt for the letter of Mavis, and then, ... meeting his gaze\nfixedly and straightly in my turn, I moved slowly on in silence. He\nunderstood,--his eyes flashed with the jewel-like strange brilliancy I\nknew so well, and so well remembered,--and drawing back he stood aside\nand--let me pass! I continued my walk steadily, though dazed and like\none in a dream,--till reaching the shadowed side of the street opposite\nthe Houses of Parliament, I stopped for a moment to recover my startled\nsenses. There again I saw him!----the superb man's form,--the Angel's\nface,--the haunting, splendid sorrowful eyes!----he came with his usual\nease and grace of step into the full moonlight and paused,--apparently\nwaiting for some one. For me?--ah no!--I kept the name of God upon my\nlips,--I gathered all the strength of faith within my soul,--and though\nI was wholesomely afraid of Myself, I feared no other foe! I lingered\ntherefore--watching;--and presently I saw a few members of Parliament\nwalking singly and in groups towards the House,--one or two greeted the\ntall dark Figure as a friend and familiar, and others knew him not.\nStill he waited on, ... and so did I. At last, just as Big Ben chimed\nthe quarter to eleven, one man whom I instantly recognised as a\nwell-known Cabinet minister, came walking briskly towards the House, ...\nthen, and then only, He, whom I had known as Lucio, advanced smiling.\nGreeting the minister cordially, in that musical rich voice I knew of\nold, he took his arm,--and they both walked on slowly, talking\nearnestly. I watched them till their figures receded in the moonlight,\n... the one tall, kingly and commanding, ... the other burly and broad,\nand self-assertive in demeanour;--I saw them ascend the steps, and\nfinally disappear within the House of England's Imperial\nGovernment,--Devil and Man,--together!\n\n\n\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  |                                                              |\n  | Transcriber's Note                                           |\n  |                                                              |\n  | Inconsistent hyphenation and word boundaries  have been      |\n  | retained: any rate \/ anyrate, bluebells \/ blue-bells,        |\n  | commonplace \/ common-place, deathlike \/ death-like,          |\n  | goodwill \/ good-will, honeysuckle \/ honey-suckle, Maypole \/  |\n  | May-pole, notepaper \/ note-paper, nowadays \/ now-a-days,     |\n  | overhead \/ over-head, Pall Mall \/ Pall-Mall, pocket book \/   |\n  | pocketbook \/ pocket-book, someone \/ some-one, Supernatural \/ |\n  | Super-natural, uplifted \/ up-lifted.                         |\n  |                                                              |\n  | Minor punctuation and spelling repairs have been made        |\n  | without comment.                                             |\n  |                                                              |\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sorrows of Satan, by Marie Corelli\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SORROWS OF SATAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 42332-8.txt or 42332-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/2\/3\/3\/42332\/\n\nProduced by Julie Barkley, David Wilson and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1236,"split":"test"}
