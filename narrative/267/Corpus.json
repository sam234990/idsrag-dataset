She lives with her mother and her widowed sister, Dorothea Prime, in a cottage near Exeter in Devon.\nMrs. Ray is amiable but weak, unable to make decisions on her own and ruled by her older daughter. Mrs. Prime is a strict and gloomy Evangelical, persuaded that all worldly joys are impediments to salvation.\nRachel is courted by Luke Rowan, a young man from London who has inherited an interest in the profitable local brewery. Mrs. Prime suspects his morals and motives, and communicates these suspicions to her mother. Mrs. Ray consults her pastor, the Low Churchman Charles Comfort; and upon his vouching for Rowan, allows Rachel to accept his offer of marriage.\nSoon after this, Rowan falls into a dispute with the senior proprietor of the brewery, and returns to London to seek legal advice. Rumours circulate about his conduct in Devon; Comfort believes the rumours, and advises Mrs. Ray to end the engagement between Rachel and Rowan. Rachel obeys her mother's instructions to write Rowan and release him from the engagement. When he fails to respond, she grows increasingly depressed.\nRowan returns to Devon, and the dispute over the brewery is settled to his satisfaction. This accomplished, he calls upon the Rays and assures Rachel that his love for her is still strong. She assents to his renewed proposals. Marital bliss ensues.\nA subplot involves the abortive courtship of Mrs. Prime by her pastor, Samuel Prong. Prong is a zealous but intolerant Evangelical. His religious beliefs are in agreement with hers, but the two have incompatible notions of marriage: Prong insists on a husband's authority over his wife, and in particular over the income from her first husband's estate; Mrs. Prime wants to retain control of her money, and is otherwise unwilling to submit to a husband's rule.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Rachel Ray, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

MATERNAL ELOQUENCE.\n\n\n\n\nRACHEL RAY.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE RAY FAMILY.\n\n\nThere are women who cannot grow alone as standard trees;--for whom\nthe support and warmth of some wall, some paling, some post, is\nabsolutely necessary;--who, in their growth, will bend and incline\nthemselves towards some such prop for their life, creeping with their\ntendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances\nof life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate\nreach. Of most women it may be said that it would be well for them\nthat they should marry,--as indeed of most men also, seeing that man\nand wife will each lend the other strength, and yet in lending lose\nnone; but to the women of whom I now speak some kind of marriage is\nquite indispensable, and by them some kind of marriage is always\nmade, though the union is often unnatural. A woman in want of a wall\nagainst which to nail herself will swear conjugal obedience sometimes\nto her cook, sometimes to her grandchild, sometimes to her lawyer.\nAny standing corner, post, or stump, strong enough to bear her weight\nwill suffice; but to some standing corner, post, or stump, she will\nfind her way and attach herself, and there will she be married.\n\nSuch a woman was our Mrs. Ray. As her name imports, she had been\nmarried in the way most popular among ladies, with bell, book, and\nparson. She had been like a young peach tree that, in its early days,\nis carefully taught to grow against a propitious southern wall. Her\nnatural prop had been found for her, and all had been well. But her\nheaven had been made black with storms; the heavy winds had come,\nand the warm sheltering covert against which she had felt herself\nso safe had been torn away from her branches as they were spreading\nthemselves forth to the fulness of life. She had been married at\neighteen, and then, after ten years of wedded security, she had\nbecome a widow.\n\nHer husband had been some years older than herself,--a steady, sober,\nhardworking, earnest man, well fitted to act as a protecting screen\nto such a woman as he had chosen. They had lived in Exeter, both\nof them having belonged to Devonshire from their birth; and Mr.\nRay, though not a clergyman himself, had been employed in matters\necclesiastical. He was a lawyer,--but a lawyer of that sort that is\nso nearly akin to the sacerdotal profession, as to make him quite\nclerical and almost a clergyman. He managed the property of the dean\nand chapter, and knew what were the rights, and also what were the\nwrongs, of prebendaries and minor canons,--of vicars choral, and\neven of choristers. But he had been dead many years before our story\ncommences, and so much as this is now said of him simply to explain\nunder what circumstances Mrs. Ray had received the first tinge of\nthat colouring which was given to her life by church matters.\n\nThey had been married somewhat over ten years when he died, and she\nwas left with two surviving daughters, the eldest and the youngest of\nthe children she had borne. The eldest, Dorothea, was then more than\nnine years old, and as she took much after her father, being stern,\nsober, and steady, Mrs. Ray immediately married herself to her eldest\nchild. Dorothea became the prop against which she would henceforth\ngrow. And against Dorothea she had grown ever since, with the\nexception of one short year. In that year Dorothea had taken a\nhusband to herself and had lost him;--so that there were two widows\nin the same house. She, like her mother, had married early, having\njoined her lot to that of a young clergyman near Baslehurst; but he\nhad lived but a few months, and Mrs. Ray's eldest child had come back\nto her mother's cottage, black, and stiff, and stern, in widow's\nweeds,--Mrs. Prime by name. Black, and stiff, and stern, in widow's\nweeds, she had remained since, for nine years following, and those\nnine years will bring us to the beginning of our story.\n\nAs regards Mrs. Ray herself, I think it was well that poor Mr. Prime\nhad died. It assured to her the support which she needed. It must,\nhowever, be acknowledged that Mrs. Prime was a harder taskmaster than\nDorothea Ray had been, and that the mother might have undergone a\ngentler ruling had the daughter never become a wife. I think there\nwas much in the hardness of the weeds she wore. It seemed as though\nMrs. Prime in selecting her crape, her bombazine, and the models of\nher caps, had resolved to repress all ideas of feminine softness;--as\nthough she had sworn to herself, with a great oath, that man should\nnever again look on her with gratified eyes. The materials she\nwore have made other widows very pleasant to be seen,--with a sad\nthoughtful pleasantness indeed, but still very pleasant. There was\nnothing of that with Mrs. Prime. When she came back to her mother's\ncottage near Baslehurst she was not yet twenty years old, but she was\nrough with weeds. Her caps were lumpy, heavy, full of woe, and clean\nonly as decency might require,--not nicely clean with feminine care.\nThe very stuff of which they were made was brown, rather than white,\nand her dress was always the same. It was rough, and black, and\nclinging,--disagreeable to the eye in its shape, as will always be\nthe dress of any woman which is worn day after day through all hours.\nBy nature and education Mrs. Prime was a prim, tidy woman, but it\nseemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate\nagainst her nature and education, at any rate in appearance. And this\nwas her lot in life before she had yet reached her twentieth year!\n\nDorothea Ray had not been wanting in some feminine attraction.\nShe had ever been brown and homely, but her features had been\nwell-formed, and her eyes had been bright. Now, as she approached to\nthirty years of age, she might have been as well-looking as at any\nearlier period of her life if it had been her wish to possess good\nlooks. But she had had no such wish. On the contrary, her desire had\nbeen to be ugly, forbidding, unattractive, almost repulsive; so that,\nin very truth, she might be known to be a widow indeed. And here\nI must not be misunderstood. There was nothing hypocritical about\nMrs. Prime, nor did she make any attempt to appear before men to\nbe weighted with a deeper sorrow than that which she truly bore;\nhypocrisy was by no means her fault. Her fault was this; that she had\ntaught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin, and that the\nmore she became morose, the nearer would she be to the fruition of\nthose hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set. In all\nher words and thoughts she was genuine; but, then, in so very many of\nthem she was mistaken! This was the wall against which Mrs. Ray had\nallowed herself to be fastened for many years past, and though the\nsupport was strong it must be admitted that it could hardly have been\nat all times pleasant.\n\nMrs. Ray had become a widow before she was thirty; and she had\ngrieved for her husband with truest sorrow, pouring herself out at\nfirst in tears, and afterwards expending herself in long hours of\nvain regrets. But she had never been rough or hard in her widowhood.\nIt had ever been her nature to be soft. She was a woman all over,\nand had about her so much of a woman's prettiness, that she had not\naltogether divested herself of it, even when her weepers had been of\nthe broadest. To obtain favour in men's eyes had never been in her\nmind since she had first obtained favour in the eyes of him who had\nbeen her lord; but yet she had never absolutely divested herself\nof her woman charms, of that look half retreating, half beseeching,\nwhich had won the heart of the ecclesiastical lawyer. Gradually her\nweeds and her deep heavy crapes had fallen away from her, and then,\nwithout much thought on the matter, she dressed herself much as\ndid other women of forty or forty-five,--being driven, however, on\ncertain occasions by her daughter to a degree of dinginess, not by\nany means rivalling that of the daughter herself, but which she would\nnot have achieved had she been left to her own devices. She was a\nsweet-tempered, good-humoured, loving, timid woman, ever listening\nand believing and learning, with a certain aptitude for gentle\nmirth at her heart which, however, was always being repressed and\ncontrolled by the circumstances of her life. She could gossip over a\ncup of tea, and enjoy buttered toast and hot cake very thoroughly, if\nonly there was no one near her to whisper into her ear that any such\nenjoyment was wicked. In spite of the sorrows she had suffered she\nwould have taught herself to believe this world to be a pleasant\nplace, were it not so often preached into her ears that it is a vale\nof tribulation in which no satisfaction can abide. And it may be said\nof Mrs. Ray that her religion, though it sufficed her, tormented her\ngrievously. It sufficed her; and if on such a subject I may venture\nto give an opinion, I think it was of a nature to suffice her in that\ngreat strait for which it had been prepared. But in this world it\ntormented her, carrying her hither and thither, and leaving her in\ngrievous doubt, not as to its own truth in any of its details, but as\nto her own conduct under its injunctions, and also as to her own mode\nof believing in it. In truth she believed too much. She could never\ndivide the minister from the Bible;--nay, the very clerk in the\nchurch was sacred to her while exercising his functions therein. It\nnever occurred to her to question any word that was said to her. If a\nlinen-draper were to tell her that one coloured calico was better for\nher than another, she would take that point as settled by the man's\nword, and for the time would be free from all doubt on that heading.\nSo also when the clergyman in his sermon told her that she should\nlive simply and altogether for heaven, that all thoughts as to this\nworld were wicked thoughts, and that nothing belonging to this world\ncould be other than painful, full of sorrow and vexations, she would\ngo home believing him absolutely, and with tear-laden eyes would\nbethink herself how utterly she was a castaway, because of that tea,\nand cake, and innocent tittle tattle with which the hours of her\nSaturday evening had been beguiled. She would weakly resolve that she\nwould laugh no more, and that she would live in truth in a valley of\ntears. But then as the bright sun came upon her, and the birds sang\naround her, and some one that she loved would cling to her and kiss\nher, she would be happy in her own despite, and would laugh with a\nlow musical sweet tone, forgetting that such laughter was a sin.\n\nAnd then that very clergyman himself would torment her;--he that told\nher from the pulpit on Sundays how frightfully vain were all attempts\nat worldly happiness. He would come to her on the Monday with a\ngood-natured, rather rubicund face, and would ask after all her\nlittle worldly belongings,--for he knew of her history and her\nmeans,--and he would joke with her, and tell her comfortably of his\ngrown sons and daughters, who were prospering in worldly matters,\nand express the fondest solicitude as to their worldly advancement.\nTwice or thrice a year Mrs. Ray would go to the parsonage, and such\nevenings would be by no means hours of wailing. Tea and buttered\ntoast on such occasions would be very manifestly in the ascendant.\nMrs. Ray never questioned the propriety of her clergyman's life, nor\ntaught herself to see a discrepancy between his doctrine and his\nconduct. But she believed in both, and was unconsciously troubled\nat having her belief so varied. She never thought about it, or\ndiscovered that her friend allowed himself to be carried away in his\nsermons by his zeal, and that he condemned this world in all things,\nhoping that he might thereby teach his hearers to condemn it in\nsome things. Mrs. Ray would allow herself the privilege of no such\nargument as that. It was all gospel to her. The parson in the church,\nand the parson out of the church, were alike gospels to her sweet,\nwhite, credulous mind; but these differing gospels troubled her and\ntormented her.\n\nOf that particular clergyman, I may as well here say that he was the\nRev. Charles Comfort, and that he was rector of Cawston, a parish in\nDevonshire, about two miles out of Baslehurst. Mr. Prime had for a\nyear or two been his curate, and during that term of curacy he had\nmarried Dorothea Ray. Then he had died, and his widow had returned\nfrom the house her husband had occupied near the church to her\nmother's cottage. Mr. Prime had been possessed of some property, and\nwhen he died he left his widow in the uncontrolled possession of\ntwo hundred a year. As it was well known that Mrs. Ray's income was\nconsiderably less than this, the people of Baslehurst and Cawston\nhad declared how comfortable for Mrs. Ray would be this accession of\nwealth to the family. But Mrs. Ray had not become much the richer.\nMrs. Prime did no doubt pay her fair quota towards the maintenance\nof the humble cottage at Bragg's End, for such was the name of the\nspot at which Mrs. Ray lived. But she did not do more than this.\nShe established a Dorcas society at Baslehurst, of which she became\npermanent president, and spent her money in carrying on this\ninstitution in the manner most pleasing to herself. I fear that Mrs.\nPrime liked to be more powerful at these charitable meetings than her\nsister labourers in the same vineyard, and that she achieved this\npower by the means of her money. I do not bring this as a heavy\naccusation against her. In such institutions there is generally need\nof a strong, stirring, leading mind. If some one would not assume\npower, the power needed would not be exercised. Such a one as Mrs.\nPrime is often necessary. But we all have our own pet temptations,\nand I think that Mrs. Prime's temptation was a love of power.\n\nIt will be understood that Baslehurst is a town,--a town with a\nmarket, and hotels, and a big brewery, and a square, and street;\nwhereas Cawston is a village, or rather a rural parish, three miles\nout of Baslehurst, north of it, lying on the river Avon. But Bragg's\nEnd, though within the parish of Cawston, lies about a mile and a\nhalf from the church and village, on the road to Baslehurst, and\npartakes therefore almost as much of the township of Baslehurst as\nit does of the rusticity of Cawston. How Bragg came to such an end,\nor why this corner of the parish came to be thus united for ever\nto Bragg's name, no one in the parish knew. The place consisted of\na little green, and a little wooden bridge, over a little stream\nthat trickled away into the Avon. Here were clustered half a dozen\nlabourers' cottages, and a beer or cider shop. Standing back from the\ngreen was the house and homestead of Farmer Sturt, and close upon\nthe green, with its garden hedge running down to the bridge, was the\npretty cottage of Mrs. Ray. Mr. Comfort had known her husband, and\nhe had found for her this quiet home. It was a pretty place, with\none small sitting-room opening back upon the little garden, and with\nanother somewhat larger fronting towards the road and the green. In\nthe front room Mrs. Ray lived, looking out upon so much of the world\nas Bragg's End green afforded to her view. The other seemed to be\nkept with some faint expectation of company that never came. Many of\nthe widow's neatest belongings were here preserved in most perfect\norder; but one may say that they were altogether thrown away,--unless\nindeed they afforded solace to their owner in the very act of dusting\nthem. Here there were four or five books, prettily bound, with gilt\nleaves, arranged in shapes on the small round table. Here also was\ndeposited a spangled mat of wondrous brightness, made of short white\nsticks of glass strung together. It must have taken care and time in\nits manufacture, but was, I should say, but of little efficacy either\nfor domestic use or domestic ornament. There were shells on the\nchimneypiece, and two or three china figures. There was a birdcage\nhung in the window but without a bird. It was all very clean, but the\nroom conveyed at the first glance an overpowering idea of its own\nabsolute inutility and vanity. It was capable of answering no purpose\nfor which men and women use rooms; but he who could have said so to\nMrs. Ray must have been a cruel and a hardhearted man.\n\nThe other room which looked out upon the green was snug enough, and\nsufficed for all the widow's wants. There was a little book-case\nladen with books. There was the family table at which they ate their\nmeals; and there was the little table near the window at which Mrs.\nRay worked. There was an old sofa, and an old arm-chair; and there\nwas, also, a carpet, alas, so old that the poor woman had become\npainfully aware that she must soon have either no carpet or a new\none. A word or two had already been said between her and Mrs. Prime\non that matter, but the word or two had not as yet been comfortable.\nThen, over the fire, there was an old round mirror; and, having told\nof that, I believe I need not further describe the furniture of the\nsitting room at Bragg's End.\n\nBut I have not as yet described the whole of Mrs. Ray's family. Had\nI done so, her life would indeed have been sour, and sorrowful, for\nshe was a woman who especially needed companionship. Though I have\nhitherto spoken but of one daughter, I have said that two had been\nleft with her when her husband died. She had one whom she feared\nand obeyed, seeing that a master was necessary to her; but she had\nanother whom she loved and caressed, and I may declare, that some\nsuch object for her tenderness was as necessary to her as the master.\nShe could not have lived without something to kiss, something to\ntend, something to which she might speak in short, loving, pet terms\nof affection. This youngest girl, Rachel, had been only two years old\nwhen her father died, and now, at the time of this story, was not yet\nquite twenty. Her sister was, in truth, only seven years her senior,\nbut in all the facts and ways of life, she seemed to be the elder by\nat least half a century. Rachel indeed, at the time, felt herself to\nbe much nearer of an age with her mother. With her mother she could\nlaugh and talk, ay, and form little wicked whispered schemes behind\nthe tyrant's back, during some of those Dorcas hours, in which Mrs.\nPrime would be employed at Baslehurst; schemes, however, for the\nfinal perpetration of which, the courage of the elder widow would too\nfrequently be found insufficient.\n\nRachel Ray was a fair-haired, well-grown, comely girl,--very like\nher mother in all but this, that whereas about the mother's eyes\nthere was always a look of weakness, there was a shadowing of coming\nstrength of character round those of the daughter. On her brow there\nwas written a capacity for sustained purpose which was wanting to\nMrs. Ray. Not that the reader is to suppose that she was masterful\nlike her sister. She had been brought up under Mrs. Prime's\ndirections, and had not, as yet, learned to rebel. Nor was she in\nany way prone to domineer. A little wickedness now and then, to the\nextent, perhaps, of a vain walk into Baslehurst on a summer evening,\na little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and\nwhom she had seen, a yawn in church, or a word of complaint as to the\nlength of the second Sunday sermon,--these were her sins; and when\nrebuked for them by her sister, she would of late toss her head, and\nlook slily across to her mother, with an eye that was not penitent.\nThen Mrs. Prime would become black and angry, and would foretell hard\nthings for her sister, denouncing her as fashioning herself wilfully\nin the world's ways. On such occasions Mrs. Ray would become very\nunhappy, believing first in the one child and then in the other.\nShe would defend Rachel, till her weak defence would be knocked\nto shivers, and her poor vacillating words taken from out of her\nmouth. Then, when forced to acknowledge that Rachel was in danger\nof backsliding, she would kiss her and cry over her, and beg her to\nlisten to the sermons. Rachel hitherto had never rebelled. She had\nnever declared that a walk into Baslehurst was better than a sermon.\nShe had never said out boldly that she liked the world and its\nwickednesses. But an observer of physiognomy, had such observer been\nthere, might have seen that the days of such rebellion were coming.\n\nShe was a fair-haired girl, with hair, not flaxen, but of light-brown\ntint,--thick, and full, and glossy, so that its charms could not\nall be hidden away let Mrs. Prime do what she would to effect such\nhiding. She was well made, being tall and straight, with great\nappearance of health and strength. She walked as though the motion\nwere pleasant to her, and easy,--as though the very act of walking\nwere a pleasure. She was bright too, and clever in their little\ncottage, striving hard with her needle to make things look well, and\nnot sparing her strength in giving household assistance. One little\nmaiden Mrs. Ray employed, and a gardener came to her for half a day\nonce a week;--but I doubt whether the maiden in the house, or the\ngardener out of the house, did as much hard work as Rachel. How\nshe had toiled over that carpet, patching it and piecing it! Even\nDorothea could not accuse her of idleness. Therefore Dorothea accused\nher of profitless industry, because she would not attend more\nfrequently at those Dorcas meetings.\n\n\"But, Dolly, how on earth am I to make my own things, and look after\nmamma's? Charity begins at home.\" Then had Dorothea put down her huge\nDorcas basket, and explained to her sister, at considerable length,\nher reading of that text of Scripture. \"One's own clothes must\nbe made all the same,\" Rachel said when the female preacher had\nfinished. \"And I don't suppose even you would like mamma to go to\nchurch without a decent gown.\" Then Dorothea had seized up her\nhuge basket angrily, and had trudged off into Baslehurst at a\nquick pace,--at a pace much too quick when the summer's heat is\nconsidered;--and as she went, unhappy thoughts filled her mind. A\ncoloured dress belonging to Rachel herself had met her eye, and she\nhad heard tidings of--a young man!\n\nSuch tidings, to her ears, were tidings of iniquity, of vanity,\nof terrible sin; they were tidings which hardly admitted of being\ndiscussed with decency, and which had to be spoken of below the\nbreath. A young man! Could it be that such disgrace had fallen upon\nher sister! She had not as yet mentioned the subject to Rachel, but\nshe had given a dark hint to their afflicted mother.\n\n\"No, I didn't see it myself, but I heard it from Miss Pucker.\"\n\n\"She that was to have been married to William Whitecoat, the baker's\nson, only he went away to Torquay and picked up with somebody else.\nPeople said he did it because she does squint so dreadfully.\"\n\n\"Mother!\"--and Dorothea spoke very sternly as she answered--\"what\ndoes it matter to us about William Whitecoat, or Miss Pucker's\nsquint? She is a woman eager in doing good.\"\n\n\"It's only since he left Baslehurst, my dear.\"\n\n\"Mother!--does that matter to Rachel? Will that save her if she be in\ndanger? I tell you that Miss Pucker saw her walking with that young\nman from the brewery!\"\n\nThough Mrs. Ray had been strongly inclined to throw what odium she\ncould upon Miss Pucker, and though she hated Miss Pucker in her\nheart,--at this special moment,--for having carried tales against her\ndarling, she could not deny, even to herself, that a terrible state\nof things had arrived if it were really true that Rachel had been\nseen walking with a young man. She was not bitter on the subject\nas was Mrs. Prime and poor Miss Pucker, but she was filled full of\nindefinite horror with regard to young men in general. They were all\nregarded by her as wolves,--as wolves, either with or without sheep's\nclothing. I doubt whether she ever brought it home to herself that\nthose whom she now recognized as the established and well-credited\nlords of the creation had ever been young men themselves. When she\nheard of a wedding,--when she learned that some struggling son of\nAdam had taken to himself a wife, and had settled himself down to the\nsober work of the world, she rejoiced greatly, thinking that the son\nof Adam had done well to get himself married. But whenever it was\nwhispered into her ear that any young man was looking after a young\nwoman,--that he was taking the only step by which he could hope to\nfind a wife for himself,--she was instantly shocked at the wickedness\nof the world, and prayed inwardly that the girl at least might be\nsaved like a brand from the burning. A young man, in her estimation,\nwas a wicked wild beast, seeking after young women to devour them, as\na cat seeks after mice. This at least was her established idea,--the\nidea on which she worked, unless some other idea on any special\noccasion were put into her head. When young Butler Cornbury, the\neldest son of the neighbouring squire, came to Cawston after pretty\nPatty Comfort,--for Patty Comfort was said to have been the prettiest\ngirl in Devonshire;--and when Patty Comfort had been allowed to go to\nthe assemblies at Torquay almost on purpose to meet him, Mrs. Ray had\nthought it all right, because it had been presented to her mind as\nall right by the Rector. Butler Cornbury had married Patty Comfort\nand it was all right. But had she heard of Patty's dancings without\nthe assistance of a few hints from Mr. Comfort himself, her mind\nwould have worked in a different way.\n\nShe certainly desired that her own child Rachel should some day\nfind a husband, and Rachel was already older than she had been\nwhen she married, or than Mrs. Prime had been at her wedding; but,\nnevertheless, there was something terrible in the very thought of--a\nyoung man; and she, though she would fain have defended her child,\nhardly knew how to do so otherwise than by discrediting the words of\nMiss Pucker. \"She always was very ill-natured, you know,\" Mrs. Ray\nventured to hint.\n\n\"Mother!\" said Mrs. Prime, in that peculiarly stern voice of hers.\n\"There can be no reason for supposing that Miss Pucker wishes to\nmalign the child. It is my belief that Rachel will be in Baslehurst\nthis evening. If so, she probably intends to meet him again.\"\n\n\"I know she is going into Baslehurst after tea,\" said Mrs. Ray,\n\"because she has promised to walk with the Miss Tappitts. She told me\nso.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--with the brewery girls! Oh, mother!\" Now it is certainly\ntrue that the three Miss Tappitts were the daughters of Bungall and\nTappitt, the old-established brewers of Baslehurst. They were, at\nleast, the actual children of Mr. Tappitt, who was the sole surviving\npartner in the brewery. The name of Bungall had for many years been\nused merely to give solidity and standing to the Tappitt family.\nThe Miss Tappitts certainly came from the brewery, and Miss Pucker\nhad said that the young man came from the same quarter. There was\nground in this for much suspicion, and Mrs. Ray became uneasy. This\nconversation between the two widows had occurred before dinner at the\ncottage on a Saturday;--and it was after dinner that the elder sister\nhad endeavoured to persuade the younger one to accompany her to the\nDorcas workshop;--but had endeavoured in vain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE YOUNG MAN FROM THE BREWERY.\n\n\nThere were during the summer months four Dorcas afternoons held\nweekly in Baslehurst, at all of which Mrs. Prime presided. It was her\ncustom to start soon after dinner, so as to reach the working room\nbefore three o'clock, and there she would remain till nine, or as\nlong as the daylight remained. The meeting was held in a sitting room\nbelonging to Miss Pucker, for the use of which the Institution paid\nsome moderate rent. The other ladies, all belonging to Baslehurst,\nwere accustomed to go home to tea in the middle of their labours;\nbut, as Mrs. Prime could not do this because of the distance, she\nremained with Miss Pucker, paying for such refreshment as she needed.\nIn this way there came to be a great friendship between Mrs. Prime\nand Miss Pucker;--or rather, perhaps, Mrs. Prime thus obtained the\nservices of a most obedient minister. Rachel had on various occasions\ngone with her sister to the Dorcas meetings, and once or twice had\nremained at Miss Pucker's house, drinking tea there. But this she\ngreatly disliked. She was aware, when she did so, that her sister\npaid for her, and she thought that Dorothea showed by her behaviour\nthat she was mistress of the entertainment. And then Rachel greatly\ndisliked Miss Pucker. She disliked that lady's squint, she disliked\nthe tone of her voice, she disliked her subservience to Mrs. Prime,\nand she especially disliked the vehemence of her objection to--young\nmen. When Rachel had last left Miss Pucker's room she had resolved\nthat she would never again drink tea there. She had not said to\nherself positively that she would attend no more of the Dorcas\nmeetings;--but as regarded their summer arrangement this resolve\nagainst the tea-drinking amounted almost to the same thing.\n\nIt was on this account, I protest, and by no means on account of\nthat young man from the brewery, that Rachel had with determination\nopposed her sister's request on this special Saturday. And the\nrefusal had been made in an unaccustomed manner, owing to the request\nalso having been pressed with unusual vigour.\n\n\"Rachel, I particularly wish it, and I think that you ought to come,\"\nDorothea had said.\n\n\"I had rather not come, Dolly.\"\n\n\"That means,\" continued Mrs. Prime, \"that you prefer your pleasure to\nyour duty;--that you boldly declare yourself determined to neglect\nthat which you know you ought to do.\"\n\n\"I don't know any such thing,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"If you think of it you will know it,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"At any rate I don't mean to go to Miss Pucker's this\nafternoon.\"--Then Rachel left the room.\n\nIt was immediately after this conversation that Mrs. Prime uttered to\nMrs. Ray that terrible hint about the young man; and at the same time\nuttered another hint by which she strove to impress upon her mother\nthat Rachel ought to be kept in subordination,--in fact, that the\npower should not belong to Rachel of choosing whether she would or\nwould not go to Dorcas meetings. In all such matters, according to\nDorothea's view of the case, Rachel should do as she was bidden. But\nthen how was Rachel to be made to do as she was bidden? How was her\nsister to enforce her attendance? Obedience in this world depends as\nfrequently on the weakness of him who is governed as on the strength\nof him who governs. That man who was going to the left is ordered by\nyou with some voice of command to go to the right. When he hesitates\nyou put more command into your voice, more command into your\neyes,--and then he obeys. Mrs. Prime had tried this, but Rachel had\nnot turned to the right. When Mrs. Prime applied for aid to their\nmother, it was a sign that the power of command was going from\nherself. After dinner the elder sister made another little futile\nattempt, and then, when she had again failed, she trudged off with\nher basket.\n\nMrs. Ray and Rachel were left sitting at the open window, looking out\nupon the mignionette. It was now in July, when the summer sun is at\nthe hottest,--and in those southern parts of Devonshire the summer\nsun in July is very hot. There is no other part of England like it.\nThe lanes are low and narrow, and not a breath of air stirs through\nthem. The ground rises in hills on all sides, so that every spot is\na sheltered nook. The rich red earth drinks in the heat and holds it,\nand no breezes come up from the southern torpid sea. Of all counties\nin England Devonshire is the fairest to the eye; but, having known it\nin its summer glory, I must confess that those southern regions are\nnot fitted for much noonday summer walking.\n\n\"I'm afraid she'll find it very hot with that big basket,\" said Mrs.\nRay, after a short pause. It must not be supposed that either she or\nRachel were idle because they remained at home. They both had their\nneedles in their hands, and Rachel was at work, not on that coloured\nfrock of her own which had roused her sister's suspicion, but on\nneedful aid to her mother's Sunday gown.\n\n\"She might have left it in Baslehurst if she liked,\" said Rachel, \"or\nI would have carried it for her as far as the bridge, only that she\nwas so angry with me when she went.\"\n\n\"I don't think she was exactly angry, Rachel.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she was, mamma;--very angry. I know by her way of flinging\nout of the house.\"\n\n\"I think she was sorry because you would not go with her.\"\n\n\"But I don't like going there, mamma. I don't like that Miss Pucker.\nI can't go without staying to tea, and I don't like drinking tea\nthere.\" Then there was a little pause. \"You don't want me to go;--do\nyou, mamma? How would the things get done here? and you can't like\nhaving your tea alone.\"\n\n\"No; I don't like that at all,\" said Mrs. Ray. But she hardly thought\nof what she was saying. Her mind was away, working on the subject\nof that young man. She felt that it was her duty to say something\nto Rachel, and yet she did not know what to say. Was she to quote\nMiss Pucker? It went, moreover, sorely against the grain with\nher to disturb the comfort of their present happy moments by any\ndisagreeable allusion. The world gave her nothing better than those\nhours in which Rachel was alone with her,--in which Rachel tended\nher and comforted her. No word had been said on a subject so wicked\nand full of vanity, but Mrs. Ray knew that her evening meal would be\nbrought in at half-past five in the shape of a little feast,--a feast\nwhich would not be spread if Mrs. Prime had remained at home. At five\no'clock Rachel would slip away and make hot toast, and would run over\nthe Green to Farmer Sturt's wife for a little thick cream, and there\nwould be a batter cake, and so there would be a feast. Rachel was\nexcellent at the preparation of such banquets, knowing how to coax\nthe teapot into a good drawing humour, and being very clever in\nlittle comforts; and she would hover about her mother, in a way very\ndelightful to that lady, making the widow feel for the time that\nthere was a gleam of sunshine in the valley of tribulation. All that\nmust be over for this afternoon if she spoke of Miss Pucker and the\nyoung man. Yes; and must it not be over for many an afternoon to\ncome? If there were to be distrust between her and Rachel what would\nher life be worth to her?\n\nBut yet there was her duty! As she sat there looking out into the\ngarden indistinct ideas of what were a mother's duties to her child\nlay heavy on her mind,--ideas which were very indistinct, but which\nwere not on that account the less powerful in their operation. She\nknew that it behoved her to sacrifice everything to her child's\nwelfare, but she did not know what special sacrifice she was at this\nmoment called upon to make. Would it be well that she should leave\nthis matter altogether in the hands of Mrs. Prime, and thus, as it\nwere, abdicate her own authority? Mrs. Prime would undertake such a\ntask with much more skill and power of language than she could use.\nBut then would this be fair to Rachel, and would Rachel obey her\nsister? Any explicit direction from herself,--if only she could bring\nherself to give any,--Rachel would, she thought, obey. In this way\nshe resolved that she would break the ice and do her duty.\n\n\"Are you going into Baslehurst this evening, dear?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, mamma; I shall walk in after tea;--that is if you don't want\nme. I told the Miss Tappitts I would meet them.\"\n\n\"No; I shan't want you. But Rachel--\"\n\n\"Well, mamma?\"\n\nMrs. Ray did not know how to do it. The matter was surrounded with\ndifficulties. How was she to begin, so as to introduce the subject\nof the young man without shocking her child and showing an amount of\ndistrust which she did not feel? \"Do you like those Miss Tappitts?\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Yes;--in a sort of a way. They are very good-natured, and one likes\nto know somebody. I think they are nicer than Miss Pucker.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--I never did like Miss Pucker myself. But, Rachel--\"\n\n\"What is it, mamma? I know you've something to say, and that you\ndon't half like to say it. Dolly has been telling tales about me, and\nyou want to lecture me, only you haven't got the heart. Isn't that\nit, mamma?\" Then she put down her work, and coming close up to her\nmother, knelt before her and looked up into her face. \"You want to\nscold me, and you haven't got the heart to do it.\"\n\n\"My darling, my darling,\" said the mother, stroking her child's soft\nsmooth hair. \"I don't want to scold you;--I never want to scold you.\nI hate scolding anybody.\"\n\n\"I know you do, mamma.\"\n\n\"But they have told me something which has frightened me.\"\n\n\"They! who are they?\"\n\n\"Your sister told me, and Miss Pucker told her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Pucker! What business has Miss Pucker with me? If she is\nto come between us all our happiness will be over.\" Then Rachel rose\nfrom her knees and began to look angry, whereupon her mother was more\nfrightened than ever. \"But let me hear it, mamma. I've no doubt it is\nsomething very awful.\"\n\nMrs. Ray looked at her daughter with beseeching eyes, as though\npraying to be forgiven for having introduced a subject so\ndisagreeable. \"Dorothea says that on Wednesday evening you were\nwalking under the churchyard elms with--that young man from the\nbrewery.\"\n\nAt any rate everything had been said now. The extent of the depravity\nwith which Rachel was to be charged had been made known to her in\nthe very plainest terms. Mrs. Ray as she uttered the terrible words\nturned first pale and then red,--pale with fear and red with shame.\nAs soon as she had spoken them she wished the words unsaid. Her\ndislike to Miss Pucker amounted almost to hatred. She felt bitterly\neven towards her own eldest daughter. She looked timidly into\nRachel's face and unconsciously construed into their true meaning\nthose lines which formed themselves on the girl's brow and over her\neyes.\n\n\"Well, mamma; and what else?\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Dorothea thinks that perhaps you are going into Baslehurst to meet\nhim again.\"\n\n\"And suppose I am?\"\n\nFrom the tone in which this question was asked it was clear to Mrs.\nRay that she was expected to answer it. And yet what answer could she\nmake?\n\nIt had never occurred to her that her child would take upon herself\nto defend such conduct as that imputed to her, or that any question\nwould be raised as to the propriety or impropriety of the proceeding.\nShe was by no means prepared to show why it was so very terrible\nand iniquitous. She regarded it as a sin,--known to be a sin\ngenerally,--as is stealing or lying. \"Suppose I am going to walk with\nhim again? what then?\"\n\n\"Oh, Rachel, who is he? I don't even know his name. I didn't believe\nit, when Dorothea told me; only as she did tell me I thought I ought\nto mention it. Oh dear, oh dear! I hope there is nothing wrong. You\nwere always so good;--I can't believe anything wrong of you.\"\n\n\"No, mamma;--don't. Don't think evil of me.\"\n\n\"I never did, my darling.\"\n\n\"I am not going into Baslehurst to walk with Mr. Rowan;--for I\nsuppose it is him you mean.\"\n\n\"I don't know, my dear; I never heard the young man's name.\"\n\n\"It is Mr. Rowan. I did walk with him along the churchyard path when\nthat woman with her sharp squinting eyes saw me. He does belong to\nthe brewery. He is related in some way to the Tappitts, and was a\nnephew of old Mrs. Bungall's. He is there as a clerk, and they say he\nis to be a partner,--only I don't think he ever will, for he quarrels\nwith Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"And now, mamma, you know as much about him as I do; only this, that\nhe went to Exeter this morning, and does not come back till Monday,\nso that it is impossible that I should meet him in Baslehurst this\nevening;--and it was very unkind of Dolly to say so; very unkind\nindeed.\" Then Rachel gave way and began to cry.\n\nIt certainly did seem to Mrs. Ray that Rachel knew a good deal about\nMr. Rowan. She knew of his kith and kin, she knew of his prospects\nand what was like to mar his prospects, and she knew also of his\nimmediate proceedings, whereabouts, and intentions. Mrs. Ray did not\nlogically draw any conclusion from these premises, but she became\nuncomfortably assured that there did exist a considerable intimacy\nbetween Mr. Rowan and her daughter. And how had it come to pass that\nthis had been allowed to form itself without any knowledge on her\npart? Miss Pucker might be odious and disagreeable;--Mrs. Ray was\ninclined to think that the lady in question was very odious and\ndisagreeable;--but must it not be admitted that her little story\nabout the young man had proved itself to be true?\n\n\"I never will go to those nasty rag meetings any more.\"\n\n\"Oh Rachel, don't speak in that way.\"\n\n\"But I won't. I will never put my foot in that woman's room again.\nThey talk nothing but scandal all the time they are there, and speak\nany ill they can of the poor young girls whom they talk about. If you\ndon't mind my knowing Mr. Rowan, what is it to them?\"\n\nBut this was assuming a great deal. Mrs. Ray was by no means prepared\nto say that she did not object to her daughter's acquaintance with\nMr. Rowan. \"But I don't know anything about him, my dear. I never\nheard his name before.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; you never did. And I know very little of him; so little\nthat there has been nothing to tell,--at least next to nothing. I\ndon't want to have any secrets from you, mamma.\"\n\n\"But, Rachel,--he isn't, is he--? I mean there isn't anything\nparticular between him and you? How was it you were walking with him\nalone?\"\n\n\"I wasn't walking with him alone;--at least only for a little way. He\nhad been out with his cousins and we had all been together, and when\nthey went in, of course I was obliged to come home. I couldn't help\nhis coming along the churchyard path with me. And what if he did,\nmamma? He couldn't bite me.\"\n\n\"But my dear--\"\n\n\"Oh mamma;--don't be afraid of me.\" Then she came across, and again\nknelt at her mother's feet. \"If you'll trust me I'll tell you\neverything.\"\n\nUpon hearing this assurance, Mrs. Ray of course promised Rachel that\nshe would trust her and expected in return to be told everything\nthen, at the moment. But she perceived that her daughter did not\nmean to tell her anything further at that time. Rachel, when she had\nreceived her mother's promise, embraced her warmly, caressing her and\npetting her as was her custom, and then after a while she resumed her\nwork. Mrs. Ray was delighted to have the evil thing over, but she\ncould not but feel that the conversation had not terminated as it\nshould have done.\n\nSoon after that the hour arrived for their little feast, and Rachel\nwent about her work just as merrily and kindly as though there had\nbeen no words about the young man. She went across for the cream,\nand stayed gossiping for some few minutes with Mrs. Sturt. Then she\nbustled about the kitchen making the tea and toasting the bread. She\nhad never been more anxious to make everything comfortable for her\nmother, and never more eager in her coaxing way of doing honour to\nthe good things which she had prepared; but, through it all, her\nmother was aware that everything was not right; there was something\nin Rachel's voice which betrayed inward uneasiness;--something in\nthe vivacity of her movements that was not quite true to her usual\nnature. Mrs. Ray felt that it was so, and could not therefore be\naltogether at her ease. She pretended to enjoy herself;--but Rachel\nknew that her joy was not real. Nothing further, however, was said,\neither regarding that evening's walk into Baslehurst, or touching\nthat other walk as to which Miss Pucker's tale had been told. Mrs.\nRay had done as much as her courage enabled her to attempt on that\noccasion.\n\nWhen the tea-drinking was over, and the cups and spoons had been\ntidily put away, Rachel prepared herself for her walk. She had been\nvery careful that nothing should be hurried,--that there should be no\napparent anxiety on her part to leave her mother quickly. And even\nwhen all was done, she would not go without some assurance of her\nmother's goodwill. \"If you have any wish that I should stay, mamma, I\ndon't care in the least about going.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; I don't want you to stay at all.\"\n\n\"Your dress is finished.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear; you have been very good.\"\n\n\"I haven't been good at all; but I will be good if you'll trust me.\"\n\n\"I will trust you.\"\n\n\"At any rate you need not be afraid to-night, for I am only going to\ntake a walk with those three girls across the church meadows. They're\nalways very civil, and I don't like to turn my back upon them.\"\n\n\"I don't wish you to turn your back upon them.\"\n\n\"It's stupid not to know anybody; isn't it?\"\n\n\"I dare say it is,\" said Mrs. Ray. Then Rachel had finished tying on\nher hat, and she walked forth.\n\nFor more than two hours after that the widow sat alone, thinking of\nher children. As regarded Mrs. Prime, there was at any rate no cause\nfor trembling, timid thoughts. She might be regarded as being safe\nfrom the world's wicked allurements. She was founded like a strong\nrock, and was, with her stedfast earnestness, a staff on which\nher weaker mother might lean with security. But then she was so\nstern,--and her very strength was so oppressive! Rachel was weaker,\nmore worldly, given terribly to vain desires and thoughts that were\nalmost wicked; but then it was so pleasant to live with her! And\nRachel, though weak and worldly and almost wicked, was so very good\nand kind and sweet! As Mrs. Ray thought of this she began to doubt\nwhether, after all, the world was so very bad a place, and whether\nthe wickedness of tea and toast, and of other creature comforts,\ncould be so very great. \"I wonder what sort of a young man he is,\"\nshe said to herself.\n\nMrs. Prime's return was always timed with the regularity of\nclockwork. At this period of the year she invariably came in exactly\nat half-past nine. Mrs. Ray was very anxious that Rachel should come\nin first, so that nothing should be said of her walk on this evening.\nShe had been unwilling to imply distrust by making any special\nrequest on this occasion, and had therefore said nothing on the\nsubject as Rachel went; but she had carefully watched the clock, and\nhad become uneasy as the time came round for Mrs. Prime's appearance.\nExactly at half-past nine she entered the house, bringing with her\nthe heavy basket laden with work, and bringing with her also a face\nfull of the deepest displeasure. She said nothing as she seated\nherself wearily on a chair against the wall; but her manner was such\nas to make it impossible that her mother should not notice it. \"Is\nthere anything wrong, Dorothea?\" she said.\n\n\"Rachel has not come home yet, of course?\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"No; not yet. She is with the Miss Tappitts.\"\n\n\"No, mother, she is not with the Miss Tappitts:\" and her voice, as\nshe said these words, was dreadful to the mother's ears.\n\n\"Isn't she? I thought she was. Do you know where she is?\"\n\n\"Who is to say where she is? Half an hour since I saw her alone\nwith--\"\n\n\"With whom? Not with that young man from the brewery, for he is at\nExeter.\"\n\n\"Mother, he is here,--in Baslehurst! Half an hour since he and Rachel\nwere standing alone together beneath the elms in the churchyard. I\nsaw them with my own eyes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE ARM IN THE CLOUDS.\n\n\nThere was plenty of time for full inquiry and full reply between\nMrs. Ray and Mrs. Prime before Rachel opened the cottage door, and\ninterrupted them. It was then nearly half-past ten. Rachel had never\nbeen so late before. The last streak of the sun's reflection in the\neast had vanished, the last ruddy line of evening light had gone, and\nthe darkness of the coming night was upon them. The hour was late for\nany girl such as Rachel Ray to be out alone.\n\nThere had been a long discussion between the mother and the\nelder daughter; and Mrs. Ray, believing implicitly in the last\nannouncements made to her, was full of fears for her child. The\nutmost rigour of self-denying propriety should have been exercised\nby Rachel, whereas her conduct had been too dreadful almost to be\ndescribed. Two or three hours since Mrs. Ray had fondly promised that\nshe would trust her younger daughter, and had let her forth alone,\nproud in seeing her so comely as she went. An idea had almost entered\nher mind that if the young man was very steady, such an acquaintance\nmight perhaps be not altogether wicked. But everything was changed\nnow. All the happiness of her trust was gone. All her sweet hopes\nwere crushed. Her heart was filled with fear, and her face was pale\nwith sorrow.\n\n\"Why should she know where he was to be?\" Dorothea had asked. \"But he\nis not at Exeter;--he is here, and she was with him.\" Then the two\nhad sat gloomily together till Rachel returned. As she came in there\nwas a little forced laugh upon her face. \"I am late; am I not?\" she\nsaid. \"Oh, Rachel, very late!\" said her mother. \"It is half-past\nten,\" said Mrs. Prime. \"Oh, Dolly, don't speak with that terrible\nvoice, as though the world were coming to an end,\" said Rachel; and\nshe looked up almost savagely, showing that she was resolved to\nfight.\n\nBut it may be as well to say a few words about the firm of Messrs.\nBungall and Tappitt, about the Tappitt family generally, and about\nMr. Luke Rowan, before any further portion of the history of that\nevening is written.\n\nWhy there should have been any brewery at all at Baslehurst, seeing\nthat everybody in that part of the world drinks cider, or how, under\nsuch circumstances, Messrs. Bungall and Tappitt had managed to live\nupon the proceeds of their trade, I cannot pretend to say. Baslehurst\nis in the heart of the Devonshire cider country. It is surrounded\nby orchards, and farmers talk there of their apples as they do of\ntheir cheese in Cheshire, or their wheat in Essex, or their sheep in\nLincolnshire. Men drink cider by the gallon,--by the gallon daily;\ncider presses are to be found at every squire's house, at every\nparsonage, and every farm homestead. The trade of a brewer at\nBaslehurst would seem to be as profitless as that of a breeches-maker\nin the Highlands, or a shoemaker in Connaught;--but nevertheless\nBungall and Tappitt had been brewers in Baslehurst for the last fifty\nyears, and had managed to live out of their brewery.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that they were great men like the mighty men\nof beer known of old,--such as Barclay and Perkins, or Reid and Co.\nNor were they new, and pink, and prosperous, going into Parliament\nfor this borough and that, just as they pleased, like the modern\nheroes of the bitter cask. When the student at Oxford was asked what\nman had most benefited humanity, and when he answered \"Bass,\" I think\nthat he should not have been plucked. It was a fair average answer.\nBut no student at any university could have said as much for Bungall\nand Tappitt without deserving utter disgrace, and whatever penance\nan outraged examiner could inflict. It was a sour and muddy stream\nthat flowed from their vats; a beverage disagreeable to the palate,\nand very cold and uncomfortable to the stomach. Who drank it I\ncould never learn. It was to be found at no respectable inn. It was\nadmitted at no private gentleman's table. The farmers knew nothing\nof it. The labourers drenched themselves habitually with cider.\nNevertheless the brewery of Messrs. Bungall and Tappitt was kept\ngoing, and the large ugly square brick house in which the Tappitt\nfamily lived was warm and comfortable. There is something in the very\nname of beer that makes money.\n\nOld Bungall, he who first established the house, was still remembered\nby the seniors of Baslehurst, but he had been dead more than twenty\nyears before the period of my story. He had been a short, fat old\nman, not much above five feet high, very silent, very hard, and\nvery ignorant. But he had understood business, and had established\nthe firm on a solid foundation. Late in life he had taken into\npartnership his nephew Tappitt, and during his life had been a severe\ntaskmaster to his partner. Indeed the firm had only assumed its\npresent name on the demise of Bungall. As long as he had lived it\nhad been Bungall's brewery. When the days of mourning were over,\nthen--and not till then--Mr. Tappitt had put up a board with the\njoint names of the firm as at present called.\n\nIt was believed in Baslehurst that Mr. Bungall had not bequeathed his\nundivided interest in the concern to his nephew. Indeed people went\nso far as to say that he had left away from Mr. Tappitt all that he\ncould leave. The truth in that respect may as well be told at once.\nHis widow had possessed a third of the profits of the concern, in\nlieu of her right to a full half share in the concern, which would\nhave carried with it the onus of a full half share of the work. That\nthird and those rights she had left to her nephew,--or rather to her\ngreat-nephew, Luke Rowan. It was not, however, in this young man's\npower to walk into the brewery and claim a seat there as a partner.\nIt was not in his power to do so, even if such should be his wish.\nWhen old Mrs. Bungall died at Dawlish at the very advanced age of\nninety-seven, there came to be, as was natural, some little dispute\nbetween Mr. Tappitt and his distant connection, Luke Rowan. Mr.\nTappitt suggested that Luke should take a thousand pounds down, and\nwalk forth free from all contamination of malt and hops. Luke's\nattorney asked for ten thousand. Luke Rowan at the time was articled\nto a lawyer in London, and as the dinginess of the chambers which he\nfrequented in Lincoln's Inn Fields appeared to him less attractive\nthan the beautiful rivers of Devonshire, he offered to go into the\nbrewery as a partner. It was at last settled that he should place\nhimself there as a clerk for twelve months, drawing a certain\nmoderate income out of the concern; and that if at the end of the\nyear he should show himself to be able, and feel himself to be\nwilling, to act as a partner, the firm should be changed to Tappitt\nand Rowan, and he should be established permanently as a Baslehurst\nbrewer. Some information, however, beyond this has already been given\nto the reader respecting Mr. Rowan's prospects. \"I don't think he\never will be a partner,\" Rachel had said to her mother, \"because\nhe quarrels with Mr. Tappitt.\" She had been very accurate in her\nstatement. Mr. Rowan had now been three months at Baslehurst, and had\nnot altogether found the ways of his relative pleasant. Mr. Tappitt\nwished to treat him as a clerk, whereas he wished to be treated as\na partner. And Mr. Tappitt had by no means found the ways of the\nyoung man to be pleasant. Young Rowan was not idle, nor did he lack\nintelligence; indeed he possessed more energy and cleverness than,\nin Tappitt's opinion, were necessary to the position of a brewer in\nBaslehurst; but he was by no means willing to use these good gifts in\nthe manner indicated by the sole existing owner of the concern. Mr.\nTappitt wished that Rowan should learn brewing seated on a stool, and\nthat the lessons should be purely arithmetical. Luke was instructed\nas to the use of certain dull, dingy, disagreeable ledgers, and\ninformed that in them lay the natural work of a brewer. But he\ndesired to learn the chemical action of malt and hops upon each\nother, and had not been a fortnight in the concern before he\nsuggested to Mr. Tappitt that by a salutary process, which he\ndescribed, the liquor might be made less muddy. \"Let us brew good\nbeer,\" he had said; and then Tappitt had known that it would not do.\n\"Yes,\" said Tappitt, \"and sell for twopence a pint what will cost you\nthreepence to make!\" \"That's what we've got to look to,\" said Rowan.\n\"I believe it can be done for the money,--only one must learn how\nto do it.\" \"I've been at it all my life,\" Tappitt said. \"Yes, Mr.\nTappitt; but it is only now that men are beginning to appreciate\nall that chemistry can do for them. If you'll allow me I'll make an\nexperiment on a small scale.\" After that Mr. Tappitt had declared\nemphatically to his wife that Luke Rowan should never become a\npartner of his. \"He would ruin any business in the world,\" said\nTappitt. \"And as to conceit!\" It is true that Rowan was conceited,\nand perhaps true also that he would have ruined the brewery had he\nbeen allowed to have his own way.\n\nBut Mrs. Tappitt by no means held him in such aversion as did her\nhusband. He was a well-grown, good-looking young man for whom his\nfriends had made comfortable provision, and Mrs. Tappitt had three\nmarriageable daughters. Her ideas on the subject of young men in\ngeneral were by no means identical with those held by Mrs. Ray. She\nwas aware how frequently it happened that a young partner would marry\na daughter of the senior in the house, and it seemed to her that\nspecial provision for such an arrangement was made in this case.\nYoung Rowan was living in her house, and was naturally thrown into\ngreat intimacy with her girls. It was clear to her quick eye that\nhe was of a susceptible disposition, fond of ladies' society, and\naltogether prone to those pleasant pre-matrimonial conversations,\nfrom the effects of which it is so difficult for an inexperienced\nyoung man to make his escape. Mrs. Tappitt was minded to devote to\nhim Augusta, the second of her flock,--but not so minded with any\nobstinacy of resolution. If Luke should prefer Martha, the elder, or\nCherry, the younger girl, Mrs. Tappitt would make no objection; but\nshe expected that he should do his duty by taking one of them. \"Laws,\nT., don't be so foolish,\" she said to her husband, when he made his\ncomplaint to her. She always called her husband T., unless when the\nsolemnity of some special occasion justified her in addressing him\nas Mr. Tappitt. To have called him Tom or Thomas, would, in her\nestimation, have been very vulgar. \"Don't be so foolish. Did you\nnever have to do with a young man before? Those tantrums will all\nblow off when he gets himself into harness.\" The tantrums spoken of\nwere Rowan's insane desire to brew good beer, but they were of so\nfatal a nature that Tappitt was determined not to submit himself to\nthem. Luke Rowan should never be partner of his,--not though he had\ntwenty daughters waiting to be married!\n\nRachel had been acquainted with the Tappitts before young Rowan\nhad come to Baslehurst, and had been made known to him by them all\ncollectively. Had they shared their mother's prudence they would\nprobably not have done anything so rash. Rachel was better-looking\nthan either of them,--though that fact perhaps might not have been\nknown to them. But in justice to them all I must say that they lacked\ntheir mother's prudence. They were good-humoured, laughing, ordinary\ngirls,--very much alike, with long brown curls, fresh complexions,\nlarge mouths, and thick noses. Augusta was rather the taller of the\nthree, and therefore, in her mother's eyes, the beauty. But the girls\nthemselves, when their distant cousin had come amongst them, had not\nthought of appropriating him. When, after the first day, they became\nintimate with him, they promised to introduce him to the beauties\nof the neighbourhood, and Cherry had declared her conviction that\nhe would fall in love with Rachel Ray directly he saw her. \"She is\ntall, you know,\" said Cherry, \"a great deal taller than us.\" \"Then\nI'm sure I shan't like her,\" Luke had said. \"Oh, but you must like\nher, because she is a friend of ours,\" Cherry had answered; \"and I\nshouldn't be a bit surprised if you fell violently in love with her.\"\nMrs. Tappitt did not hear all this, but, nevertheless, she began\nto entertain a dislike to Rachel. It must not be supposed that she\nadmitted her daughter Augusta to any participation in her plans.\nMrs. Tappitt could scheme for her child, but she could not teach her\nchild to scheme. As regarded the girl, it must all fall out after the\nnatural, pleasant, everyday fashion of such things; but Mrs. Tappitt\nconsidered that her own natural advantages were so great that she\ncould make the thing fall out as she wished. When she was informed\nabout a fortnight after Rowan's arrival in Baslehurst that Rachel\nRay had been walking with the party from the brewery, she could not\nprevent herself from saying an ill-natured word or two. \"Rachel Ray\nis all very well,\" she said, \"but she is not the person whom you\nshould show off to a stranger as your particular friend.\"\n\n\"Why not, mamma?\" said Cherry.\n\n\"Why not, my dear! There are reasons why not. Mrs. Ray is very well\nin her way, but--\"\n\n\"Her husband was a gentleman,\" said Martha, \"and a great friend of\nMr. Comfort's.\"\n\n\"My dear, I have nothing to say against her,\" said the mother, \"only\nthis; that she does not go among the people we know. There is Mrs.\nPrime, the other daughter; her great friend is Miss Pucker. I don't\nsuppose you want to be very intimate with Miss Pucker.\" The brewer's\nwife had a position in Baslehurst and wished that her daughters\nshould maintain it.\n\nIt will now be understood in what way Rachel had formed her\nacquaintance with Luke Rowan, and I think it may certainly be\nadmitted that she had been guilty of no great impropriety;--unless,\nindeed, she had been wrong in saying nothing of the acquaintance to\nher mother. Previous to those ill-natured tidings brought home as to\nthe first churchyard meeting, Rachel had seen him but twice. On the\nfirst occasion she had thought but little of it,--but little of Luke\nhimself or of her acquaintance with him. In simple truth the matter\nhad passed from her mind, and therefore she had not spoken of it.\nWhen they met the second time, Luke had walked much of the way\nhome with her,--with her alone,--having joined himself to her when\nthe Tappitt girls went into their house as Rachel had afterwards\ndescribed to her mother. In all that she had said she had spoken\nabsolutely the truth; but it cannot be pleaded on her behalf that\nafter this second meeting with Mr. Rowan she had said nothing of him\nbecause she had thought nothing. She had indeed thought much, but it\nhad seemed well to her to keep her thoughts to herself.\n\nThe Tappitt girls had by no means given up their friend because their\nmother had objected to Miss Pucker; and when Rachel met them on that\nSaturday evening,--that fatal Saturday,--they were very gracious to\nher. The brewery at Baslehurst stood on the outskirts of the town, in\na narrow lane which led from the church into the High-street. This\nlane,--Brewery-lane, as it was called,--was not the main approach to\nthe church; but from the lane there was a stile into the churchyard,\nand a gate, opened on Sundays, by which people on that side reached\nthe church. From the opposite side of the churchyard a road led away\nto the foot of the High-street, and out towards the bridge which\ndivided the town from the parish of Cawston. Along one side of this\nroad there was a double row of elms, having a footpath beneath them.\nThis old avenue began within the churchyard, running across the lower\nend of it, and was continued for some two hundred yards beyond its\nprecincts. This, then, would be the way which Rachel would naturally\ntake in going home, after leaving the Miss Tappitts at their door;\nbut it was by no means the way which was the nearest for Mrs. Prime\nafter leaving Miss Pucker's lodgings in the High-street, seeing that\nthe High-street itself ran direct to Cawston bridge.\n\nAnd it must also be explained that there was a third path out of the\nchurchyard, not leading into any road, but going right away across\nthe fields. The church stood rather high, so that the land sloped\naway from it towards the west, and the view there was very pretty.\nThe path led down through a small field, with high hedgerows, and by\norchards, to two little hamlets belonging to Baslehurst, and this was\na favourite walk with the people of the town. It was here that Rachel\nhad walked with the Miss Tappitts on that evening when Luke Rowan had\nfirst accompanied her as far as Cawston bridge, and it was here that\nthey agreed to walk again on the Saturday when Rowan was supposed to\nbe away at Exeter. Rachel was to come along under the elms, and was\nto meet her friends there, or in the churchyard, or, if not so, then\nshe was to call for them at the brewery.\n\nShe found the three girls leaning against the rails near the\nchurchyard stile. \"We have been waiting ever so long,\" said Cherry,\nwho was more specially Rachel's friend.\n\n\"Oh, but I said you were not to wait,\" said Rachel, \"for I never am\nquite sure whether I can come.\"\n\n\"We knew you'd come,\" said Augusta, \"because--\"\n\n\"Because what?\" asked Rachel.\n\n\"Because nothing,\" said Cherry. \"She's only joking.\"\n\nRachel said nothing more, not having understood the point of the\njoke. The joke was this,--that Luke Rowan had come back from Exeter,\nand that Rachel was supposed to have heard of his return, and\ntherefore that her coming for the walk was certain. But Augusta had\nnot intended to be ill-natured, and had not really believed what she\nhad been about to insinuate. \"The fact is,\" said Martha, \"that Mr.\nRowan has come home; but I don't suppose we shall see anything of him\nthis evening as he is busy with papa.\"\n\nRachel for a few minutes became silent and thoughtful. Her mind had\nnot yet freed itself from the effects of her conversation with her\nmother, and she had been thinking of this young man during the whole\nof her solitary walk into town. But she had been thinking of him as\nwe think of matters which need not put us to any immediate trouble.\nHe was away at Exeter, and she would have time to decide whether or\nno she would admit his proffered intimacy before she should see him\nagain. \"I do so hope we shall be friends,\" he had said to her as he\ngave her his hand when they parted on Cawston bridge. And then he had\nmuttered something, which she had not quite caught, as to Baslehurst\nbeing altogether another place to him since he had seen her. She\nhad hurried home on that occasion with a feeling, half pleasant and\nhalf painful, that something out of the usual course had occurred to\nher. But, after all, it amounted to nothing. What was there that she\ncould tell her mother? She had no special tale to tell, and yet she\ncould not speak of young Rowan as she would have spoken of a chance\nacquaintance. Was she not conscious that he had pressed her hand\nwarmly as he parted from her?\n\nRachel herself entertained much of that indefinite fear of young men\nwhich so strongly pervaded her mother's mind, and which, as regarded\nher sister, had altogether ceased to be indefinite. Rachel knew that\nthey were the natural enemies of her special class, and that any kind\nof friendship might be allowed to her, except a friendship with any\nof them. And as she was a good girl, loving her mother, anxious to do\nwell, guided by pure thoughts, she felt aware that Mr. Rowan should\nbe shunned. Had it not been that he himself had told her that he was\nto be in Exeter, she would not have come out to walk with the brewery\ngirls on that evening. What she might hereafter decide upon doing,\nhow these affairs might be made to arrange themselves, she by no\nmeans could foresee;--but on that evening she had thought she would\nbe safe, and therefore she had come out to walk.\n\n\"What do you think?\" said Cherry; \"we are going to have a party next\nweek.\"\n\n\"It won't be till the week after,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"At any rate, we are going to have a party, and you must come. You'll\nget a regular invite, you know, when they're sent out. Mr. Rowan's\nmother and sister are coming down on a visit to us for a few days,\nand so we're going to be quite smart.\"\n\n\"I don't know about going to a party. I suppose it is for a dance?\"\n\n\"Of course it is for a dance,\" said Martha.\n\n\"And of course you'll come and dance with Luke Rowan,\" said Cherry.\nNothing could be more imprudent than Cherry Tappitt, and Augusta\nwas beginning to be aware of this, though she had not been allowed\nto participate in her mother's schemes. After that, there was much\ntalking about the party, but the conversation was chiefly kept up by\nthe Tappitt girls. Rachel was almost sure that her mother would not\nlike her to go to a dance, and was quite sure that her sister would\noppose such iniquity with all her power; therefore she made no\npromise. But she listened as the list was repeated of those who were\nexpected to come, and asked some few questions as to Mrs. Rowan and\nher daughter. Then, at a sudden turn of a lane, a lane that led back\nto the town by another route, they met Luke Rowan himself.\n\nHe was a cousin of the Tappitts, and therefore, though the\nrelationship was not near, he had already assumed the privilege of\ncalling them by their Christian names; and Martha, who was nearly\nthirty years old, and four years his senior, had taught herself\nto call him Luke; with the other two he was as yet Mr. Rowan. The\ngreeting was of course very friendly, and he returned with them on\ntheir path. To Rachel he raised his hat, and then offered his hand.\nShe had felt herself to be confused the moment she saw him,--so\nconfused that she was not able to ask him how he was with ordinary\ncomposure. She was very angry with herself, and heartily wished that\nshe was seated with the Dorcas women at Miss Pucker's. Any position\nwould have been better for her than this, in which she was disgracing\nherself and showing that she could not bear herself before this young\nman as though he were no more than an ordinary acquaintance. Her mind\nwould revert to that hand-squeezing, to those muttered words, and to\nher mother's caution. When he remarked to her that he had come back\nearlier than he expected, she could not take his words as though\nthey signified nothing. His sudden return was a momentous fact to\nher, putting her out of her usual quiet mode of thought. She said\nlittle or nothing, and he, at any rate, did not observe that she was\nconfused; but she was herself so conscious of it, that it seemed to\nher that all of them must have seen it.\n\nThus they sauntered along, back to the outskirts of the town, and so\ninto the brewery lane, by a route opposite to that of the churchyard.\nThe whole way they talked of nothing but the party. Was Miss Rowan\nfond of dancing? Then by degrees the girls called her Mary, declaring\nthat as she was a cousin they intended so to do. And Luke said that\nhe ought to be called by his Christian name; and the two younger\ngirls agreed that he was entitled to the privilege, only they would\nask mamma first; and in this way they were becoming very intimate.\nRachel said but little, and perhaps not much that was said was\naddressed specially to her, but she seemed to feel that she was\nincluded in the friendliness of the gathering. Every now and then\nLuke Rowan would address her, and his voice was pleasant to her ears.\nHe had made an effort to walk next to her,--an attempt almost too\nslight to be called an effort, which she had, almost unconsciously,\nfrustrated, by so placing herself that Augusta should be between\nthem. Augusta was not quite in a good humour, and said one or two\nwords which were slightly snubbing in their tendency; but this was\nmore than atoned for by Cherry's high good-humour.\n\nWhen they reached the brewery they all declared themselves to be very\nmuch astonished on learning that it was already past nine. Rachel's\nsurprise, at any rate, was real. \"I must go home at once,\" she\nsaid; \"I don't know what mamma will think of me.\" And then, wishing\nthem all good-bye, without further delay she hurried on into the\nchurchyard.\n\n\"I'll see you safe through the ghosts at any rate,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"I'm not a bit afraid of churchyard ghosts,\" said Rachel, moving on.\nBut Rowan followed her.\n\n\"I've got to go into town to meet your father,\" said he to the other\ngirls, \"and I'll be back with him.\"\n\nAugusta saw with some annoyance that he had overtaken Rachel before\nshe had passed over the stile, and stood lingering at the door long\nenough to be aware that Luke was over first. \"That girl is a flirt,\nafter all,\" she said to her sister Martha.\n\nLuke was over the stile first, and then turned round to assist Miss\nRay. She could not refuse him her hand in such a position; or if she\ncould have done so she lacked the presence of mind that was necessary\nfor such refusal. \"You must let me walk home with you,\" he said.\n\n\"Indeed I will do no such thing. You told Augusta that you were going\nto her papa in the town.\"\n\n\"So I am, but I will see you first as far as the bridge; you can't\nrefuse me that.\"\n\n\"Indeed I can, and indeed I will. I beg you won't come. I am sure you\nwould not wish to annoy me.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said he, pointing to the west; \"did you ever see such a\nsetting sun as that? Did you ever see such blood-red colour?\" The\nlight was very wonderful, for the sun had just gone down and all\nthe western heavens were crimson with its departing glory. In the\nfew moments that they stood there gazing it might almost have been\nbelieved that some portentous miracle had happened, so deep and\ndark, and yet so bright, were the hues of the horizon. It seemed as\nthough the lands below the hill were bathed in blood. The elm trees\ninterrupted their view, so that they could only look out through the\nspaces between their trunks. \"Come to the stile,\" said he. \"If you\nwere to live a thousand years you might never again see such a sunset\nas that. You would never forgive yourself if you missed it, just that\nyou might save three minutes.\"\n\nRachel stepped with him towards the stile; but it was not solely his\nentreaty that made her do so. As he spoke of the sun's glory her\nsharp ear caught the sound of a woman's foot close to the stile over\nwhich she had passed, and knowing that she could not escape at once\nfrom Luke Rowan, she had left the main path through the churchyard,\nin order that the new comer might not see her there talking to him.\nSo she accompanied him on till they stood between the trees, and then\nthey remained encompassed as it were in the full light of the sun's\nrays. But if her ears had been sharp, so were the eyes of this new\ncomer. And while she stood there with Rowan beneath the elms, her\nsister stood a while also on the churchyard path and recognized the\nfigures of them both.\n\n\"Rachel,\" said he, after they had remained there in silence for a\nmoment, \"live as long as you may, never on God's earth will you look\non any sight more lovely than that. Ah! do you see the man's arm, as\nit were; the deep purple cloud, like a huge hand stretched out from\nsome other world to take you? Do you see it?\"\n\nThe sound of his voice was very pleasant. His words to her young ears\nseemed full of poetry and sweet mysterious romance. He spoke to her\nas no one,--no man or woman,--had ever spoken to her before. She had\na feeling, as painful as it was delicious, that the man's words were\nsweet with a sweetness which she had known in her dreams. He had\nasked her a question, and repeated it, so that she was all but driven\nto answer him; but still she was full of the one great fact that he\nhad called her Rachel, and that he must be rebuked for so calling\nher. But how could she rebuke a man who had bid her look at God's\nbeautiful works in such language as he had used?\n\n\"Yes, I see it; it is very grand; but--\"\n\n\"There were the fingers, but you see how they are melting away. The\narm is there still, but the hand is gone. You and I can trace it\nbecause we saw it when it was clear, but we could not now show it to\nanother. I wonder whether any one else saw that hand and arm, or only\nyou and I. I should like to think that it was shown to us, and us\nonly.\"\n\nIt was impossible for her now to go back upon that word Rachel. She\nmust pass it by as though she had not heard it. \"All the world might\nhave seen it had they looked,\" said she.\n\n\"Perhaps not. Do you think that all eyes can see alike?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I suppose so.\"\n\n\"All eyes will see a loaf of bread alike, or a churchyard stile, but\nall eyes will not see the clouds alike. Do you not often find worlds\namong the clouds? I do.\"\n\n\"Worlds!\" she said, amazed at his energy; and then she bethought\nherself that he was right. She would never have seen that hand and\narm had he not been there to show it her. So she gazed down upon the\nchanging colours of the horizon, and almost forgot that she should\nnot have lingered there a moment.\n\nAnd yet there was a strong feeling upon her that she was\nsinking,--sinking,--sinking away into iniquity. She ought not to have\nstood there an instant, she ought not to have been there with him at\nall;--and yet she lingered. Now that she was there she hardly knew\nhow to move herself away.\n\n\"Yes; worlds among the clouds,\" he continued; but before he did so\nthere had been silence between them for a minute or two. \"Do you\nnever feel that you look into other worlds beyond this one in which\nyou eat, and drink, and sleep? Have you no other worlds in your\ndreams?\" Yes; such dreams she had known, and now, she almost thought\nthat she could remember to have seen strange forms in the clouds. She\nknew that henceforth she would watch the clouds and find them there.\nShe looked down into the flood of light beneath her, with a full\nconsciousness that he was close to her, touching her; with a full\nconsciousness that every moment that she lingered there was a new\nsin; with a full consciousness, too, that the beauty of those fading\ncolours seen thus in his presence possessed a charm, a sense of soft\ndelight, which she had never known before. At last she uttered a long\nsigh.\n\n\"Why, what ails you?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, I must go; I have been so wrong to stand here. Good-bye; pray,\npray do not come with me.\"\n\n\"But you will shake hands with me.\" Then he got her hand, and held\nit. \"Why should it be wrong for you to stand and look at the sunset?\nAm I an ogre? Have I done anything that should make you afraid of\nme?\"\n\n\"Do not hold me. Mr. Rowan I did not think you would behave like\nthat.\" The gloom of the evening was now coming on, and though but\na few minutes had passed since Mrs. Prime had walked through the\nchurchyard, she would not have been able to recognize them had she\nwalked there now. \"It is getting dark, and I must go instantly.\"\n\n\"Let me go with you, then, as far as the bridge.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. Pray do not vex me.\"\n\n\"I will not. You shall go alone. But stand while I say one word to\nyou. Why should you be afraid of me?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of you,--at least,--you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I wonder,--I wonder whether--you dislike me.\"\n\n\"I don't dislike anybody. Good-night.\"\n\nHe had however again got her hand. \"I'll tell you why I ask;--because\nI like you so much, so very much! Why should we not be friends? Well;\nthere. I will not trouble you now. I will not stir from here till you\nare out of sight. But mind,--remember this; I intend that you shall\nlike me.\"\n\nShe was gone from him, fleeing away along the path in a run while the\nlast words were being spoken; and yet, though they were spoken in a\nlow voice, she heard and remembered every syllable. What did the man\nmean by saying that he intended that she should like him? Like him!\nHow could she fail of liking him? Only was it not incumbent on her to\ntake some steps which might save her from ever seeing him again? Like\nhim, indeed! What was the meaning of the word? Had he intended to ask\nher to love him? And if so, what answer must she make?\n\nHow beautiful had been those clouds! As soon as she was beyond the\nchurch wall, so that she could look again to the west, she gazed with\nall her eyes to see if there were still a remnant left of that arm.\nNo; it had all melted into a monstrous shape, indistinct and gloomy,\npartaking of the darkness of night. The brightness of the vision was\ngone. But he bade her look into the clouds for new worlds, and she\nseemed to feel that there was a hidden meaning in his words. As she\nlooked out into the coming darkness, a mystery crept over her, a\nsense of something wonderful that was out there, away,--of something\nso full of mystery that she could not tell whether she was thinking\nof the hidden distances of the horizon, or of the distances of her\nown future life, which were still further off and more closely\nhidden. She found herself trembling, sighing, almost sobbing,\nand then she ran again. He had wrapped her in his influence, and\nfilled her full of the magnetism of his own being. Her woman's\nweakness,--the peculiar susceptibility of her nature, had never\nbefore been touched. She had now heard the first word of romance that\nhad ever reached her ears, and it had fallen upon her with so great a\npower that she was overwhelmed.\n\nWords of romance! Words direct from the Evil One, Mrs. Prime would\nhave called them! And in saying so she would have spoken the belief\nof many a good woman and many a good man. She herself was a good\nwoman,--a sincere, honest, hardworking, self-denying woman; a woman\nwho struggled hard to do her duty as she believed it had been taught\nto her. She, as she walked through the churchyard,--having come\ndown the brewery lane with some inkling that her sister might be\nthere,--had been struck with horror at seeing Rachel standing with\nthat man. What should she do? She paused a moment to ask herself\nwhether she should return for her; but she said to herself that her\nsister was obstinate, that a scene would be occasioned, that she\nwould do no good,--and so she passed on. Words of romance, indeed!\nMust not all such words be words from the Father of Lies, seeing that\nthey are words of falseness? Some such thoughts passed through her\nmind as she walked home, thinking of her sister's iniquity,--of her\nsister who must be saved, like a brand from the fire, but whose\nsaving could now be effected only by the sternest of discipline. The\nhours at the Dorcas meetings must be made longer, and Rachel must\nalways be there.\n\nIn the mean time Rachel hurried home with her spirits all a-tremble.\nOf her immediately-coming encounter with her mother and her sister\nshe hardly thought much before she reached the door. She thought\nonly of him, how beautiful he was, how grand,--and how dangerous; of\nhim and of his words, how beautiful they were, how grand, and how\nterribly dangerous! She knew that it was very late and she hurried\nher steps. She knew that her mother must be appeased, and her sister\nmust be opposed,--but neither to her mother or to her sister was\ngiven the depth of her thoughts. She was still thinking of him, and\nof the man's arm in the clouds, when she opened the door of the\ncottage at Bragg's End.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nWHAT SHALL BE DONE ABOUT IT?\n\n\nRachel was still thinking of Luke Rowan and of the man's arm when\nshe opened the cottage door, but the sight of her sister's face,\nand the tone of her sister's voice, soon brought her back to a full\nconsciousness of her immediate present position. \"Oh, Dolly, do not\nspeak with that terrible voice, as though the world were coming to\nan end,\" she said, in answer to the first note of objurgation that\nwas uttered; but the notes that came afterwards were so much more\nterrible, so much more severe, that Rachel found herself quite unable\nto stop them by any would-be joking tone.\n\nMrs. Prime was desirous that her mother should speak the words of\ncensure that must be spoken. She would have preferred herself to\nremain silent, knowing that she could be as severe in her silence as\nin her speech, if only her mother would use the occasion as it should\nbe used. Mrs. Ray had been made to feel how great was the necessity\nfor outspoken severity; but when the moment came, and her dear\nbeautiful child stood there before her, she could not utter the words\nwith which she had been already prompted. \"Oh, Rachel,\" she said,\n\"Dorothea tells me--\" and then she stopped.\n\n\"What has Dorothea told you?\" asked Rachel.\n\n\"I have told her,\" said Mrs. Prime, now speaking out, \"that I saw you\nstanding alone an hour since with that young man,--in the churchyard.\nAnd yet you had said that he was to have been away in Exeter!\"\n\nRachel's cheeks and forehead were now suffused with red. We used to\nthink, when we pretended to read the faces of our neighbours, that\na rising blush betrayed a conscious falsehood. For the most part\nwe know better now, and have learned to decipher more accurately\nthe outward signs which are given by the impulses of the heart. An\nunmerited accusation of untruth will ever bring the blood to the face\nof the young and innocent. But Mrs. Ray was among the ignorant in\nthis matter, and she groaned inwardly when she saw her child's\nconfusion.\n\n\"Oh, Rachel, is it true?\" she said.\n\n\"Is what true, mamma? It is true that Mr. Rowan spoke to me in the\nchurchyard, though I did not know that Dorothea was acting as a spy\non me.\"\n\n\"Rachel, Rachel!\" said the mother.\n\n\"It is very necessary that some one should act the spy on you,\" said\nthe sister. \"A spy, indeed! You think to anger me by using such a\nword, but I will not be angered by any words. I went there to look\nafter you, fearing that there was occasion,--fearing it, but hardly\nthinking it. Now we know that there was occasion.\"\n\n\"There was no occasion,\" said Rachel, looking into her sister's face\nwith eyes of which the incipient strength was becoming manifest.\n\"There was no occasion. Oh, mamma, you do not think there was an\noccasion for watching me?\"\n\n\"Why did you say that that young man was at Exeter?\" asked Mrs.\nPrime.\n\n\"Because he had told me that he would be there;--he had told us all\nso, as we were walking together. He came to-day instead of coming\nto-morrow. What would you say if I questioned you in that way about\nyour friends?\" Then, when the words had passed from her lips, she\nremembered that she should not have called Mr. Rowan her friend. She\nhad never called him so, in thinking of him, to herself. She had\nnever admitted that she had any regard for him. She had acknowledged\nto herself that it would be very dangerous to entertain friendship\nfor such as he.\n\n\"Friend, Rachel!\" said Mrs. Prime. \"If you look for such friendship\nas that, who can say what will come to you?\"\n\n\"I haven't looked for it. I haven't looked for anything. People do\nget to know each other without any looking, and they can't help it.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Prime took off her bonnet and her shawl, and Rachel laid\ndown her hat and her little light summer cloak; but it must not be\nsupposed that the war was suspended during these operations. Mrs.\nPrime was aware that a great deal more must be said, but she was very\nanxious that her mother should say it. Rachel also knew that much\nmore would be said, and she was by no means anxious that the subject\nshould be dropped, if only she could talk her mother over to her\nside.\n\n\"If mother thinks it right,\" exclaimed Mrs. Prime, \"that you should\nbe standing alone with a young man after nightfall in the churchyard,\nthen I have done. In that case I will say no more. But I must tell\nher, and I must tell you also, that if it is to be so, I cannot\nremain at the cottage any longer.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dorothea!\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Indeed, mother, I cannot. If Rachel is not hindered from such\nmeetings by her own sense of what is right, she must be hindered by\nthe authority of those older than herself.\"\n\n\"Hindered,--hindered from what?\" said Rachel, who felt that her tears\nwere coming, but struggled hard to retain them. \"Mamma, I have done\nnothing that was wrong. Mamma, you will believe me, will you not?\"\n\nMrs. Ray did not know what to say. She strove to believe both of\nthem, though the words of one were directly at variance with the\nwords of the other.\n\n\"Do you mean to claim it as your right,\" said Mrs. Prime, \"to be\nstanding out there alone at any hour of the night, with any young man\nthat you please? If so, you cannot be my sister.\"\n\n\"I do not want to be your sister if you think such hard things,\" said\nRachel, whose tears now could no longer be restrained. Honi soit qui\nmal y pense. She did not, at the moment, remember the words to speak\nthem, but they contain exactly the purport of her thought. And now,\nhaving become conscious of her own weakness by reason of these tears\nwhich would overwhelm her, she determined that she would say nothing\nfurther till she pleaded her cause before her mother alone. How could\nshe describe before her sister the way in which that interview at the\nchurchyard stile had been brought about? But she could kneel at her\nmother's feet and tell her everything;--she thought, at least, that\nshe could tell her mother everything. She occupied generally the same\nbedroom as her sister; but, on certain occasions,--if her mother was\nunwell or the like,--she would sleep in her mother's room. \"Mamma,\"\nshe said, \"you will let me sleep with you to-night. I will go now,\nand when you come I will tell you everything. Good night to you,\nDolly.\"\n\n\"Good night, Rachel;\" and the voice of Mrs. Prime, as she bade her\nsister adieu for the evening, sounded as the voice of the ravens.\n\nThe two widows sat in silence for a while, each waiting for the other\nto speak. Then Mrs. Prime got up and folded her shawl very carefully,\nand carefully put her bonnet and gloves down upon it. It was her\nhabit to be very careful with her clothes, but in her anger she had\nalmost thrown them upon the little sofa. \"Will you have anything\nbefore you go to bed, Dorothea?\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Nothing, thank you,\"\nsaid Mrs. Prime; and her voice was very like the voice of the ravens.\nThen Mrs. Ray began to think it possible that she might escape away\nto Rachel without any further words. \"I am very tired,\" she said,\n\"and I think I will go, Dorothea.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Mrs. Prime, \"something must be done about this.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; she will talk to me to-night, and tell it me all.\"\n\n\"But will she tell you the truth?\"\n\n\"She never told me a falsehood yet, Dorothea. I'm sure she didn't\nknow that the young man was to be here. You know if he did come back\nfrom Exeter before he said he would she couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"And do you mean that she couldn't help being with him there,--all\nalone? Mother, what would you think of any other girl of whom you\nheard such a thing?\"\n\nMrs. Ray shuddered; and then some thought, some shadow perhaps of a\nremembrance, flitted across her mind, which seemed to have the effect\nof palliating her child's iniquity. \"Suppose--\" she said. \"Suppose\nwhat?\" said Mrs. Prime, sternly. But Mrs. Ray did not dare to go on\nwith her supposition. She did not dare to suggest that Mr. Rowan\nmight perhaps be a very proper young man, and that the two young\npeople might be growing fond of each other in a proper sort of way.\nShe hardly believed in any such propriety herself, and she knew that\nher daughter would scout it to the winds. \"Suppose what?\" said Mrs.\nPrime again, more sternly than before. \"If the other girls left her\nand went away to the brewery, perhaps she could not have helped it,\"\nsaid Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"But she was not walking with him. Her face was not turned towards\nhome even. They were standing together under the trees, and, judging\nfrom the time at which I got home, they must have remained together\nfor nearly half an hour afterwards. And this with a perfect stranger,\nmother,--a man whose name she had never mentioned to us till she was\ntold how Miss Pucker had seen them together! You cannot suppose that\nI want to make her out worse than she is. She is your child, and my\nsister; and we are bound together for weal or for woe.\"\n\n\"You talked about going away and leaving us,\" said Mrs. Ray, speaking\nin soreness rather than in anger.\n\n\"So I did; and so I must, unless something be done. It could not be\nright that I should remain here, seeing such things, if my voice is\nnot allowed to be heard. But though I did go, she would still be my\nsister. I should still share the sorrow,--and the shame.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dorothea, do not say such words.\"\n\n\"But they must be said, mother. Is it not from such meetings that\nshame comes,--shame, and sorrow, and sin? You love her dearly, and so\ndo I; and are we therefore to allow her to be a castaway? Those whom\nyou love you must chastise. I have no authority over her,--as she has\ntold me, more than once already,--and therefore I say again, that\nunless all this be stopped, I must leave the cottage. Good night,\nnow, mother. I hope you will speak to her in earnest.\" Then Mrs.\nPrime took her candle and went her way.\n\nFor ten minutes the mother sat herself down, thinking of the\ncondition of her youngest daughter, and trying to think what words\nshe would use when she found herself in her daughter's presence.\nSorrow, and Shame, and Sin! Her child a castaway! What terrible words\nthey were! And yet there had been nothing that she could allege in\nanswer to them. That comfortable idea of a decent husband for her\nchild had been banished from her mind almost before it had been\nentertained. Then she thought of Rachel's eyes, and knew that she\nwould not be able to assume a perfect mastery over her girl. When\nthe ten minutes were over she had made up her mind to nothing, and\nthen she also took up her candle and went to her room. When she\nfirst entered it she did not see Rachel. She had silently closed the\ndoor and come some steps within the chamber before her child showed\nherself from behind the bed. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"put down the candle\nthat I may speak to you.\" Whereupon Mrs. Ray put down the candle, and\nRachel took hold of both her arms. \"Mamma, you do not believe ill of\nme; do you? You do not think of me the things that Dorothea says? Say\nthat you do not, or I shall die.\"\n\n\"My darling, I have never thought anything bad of you before.\"\n\n\"And do you think bad of me now? Did you not tell me before I went\nout that you would trust me, and have you so soon forgotten your\ntrust? Look at me, mamma. What have I ever done that you should think\nme to be such as she says?\"\n\n\"I do not think that you have done anything; but you are very young,\nRachel.\"\n\n\"Young, mamma! I am older than you were when you married, and older\nthan Dolly was. I am old enough to know what is wrong. Shall I tell\nyou what happened this evening? He came and met us all in the fields.\nI knew before that he had come back, for the girls had said so, but\nI thought that he was in Exeter when I left here. Had I not believed\nthat, I should not have gone. I think I should not have gone.\"\n\n\"Then you are afraid of him?\"\n\n\"No, mamma; I am not afraid of him. But he says such strange things\nto me; and I would not purposely have gone out to meet him. He came\nto us in the fields, and then we returned up the lane to the brewery,\nand there we left the girls. As I went through the churchyard he came\nthere too, and then the sun was setting, and he stopped me to look at\nit; I did stop with him,--for a few moments, and I felt ashamed of\nmyself; but how was I to help it? Mamma, if I could remember them I\nwould tell you every word he said to me, and every look of his face.\nHe asked me to be his friend. Mamma, if you will believe in me I will\ntell you everything. I will never deceive you.\"\n\nShe was still holding her mother's arms while she spoke. Now she\nheld her very close and nestled in against her bosom, and gradually\ngot her cheek against her mother's cheek, and her lips against her\nmother's neck. How could any mother refuse such a caress as that, or\nremain hard and stern against such signs of love? Mrs. Ray, at any\nrate, was not possessed of strength to do so. She was vanquished, and\nput her arm round her girl and embraced her. She spoke soft words,\nand told Rachel that she was her dear, dear, dearest darling. She was\nstill awed and dismayed by the tidings which she had heard of the\nyoung man; she still thought there was some terrible danger against\nwhich it behoved them all to be on their guard. But she no longer\nfelt herself divided from her child, and had ceased to believe in\nthe necessity of those terrible words which Mrs. Prime had used.\n\n\"You will believe me?\" said Rachel. \"You will not think that I am\nmaking up stories to deceive you?\" Then the mother assured the\ndaughter with many kisses that she would believe her.\n\nAfter that they sat long into the night, discussing all that Luke\nRowan had said, and the discussion certainly took place after a\nfashion that would not have been considered satisfactory by Mrs.\nPrime had she heard it. Mrs. Ray was soon led into talking about Mr.\nRowan as though he were not a wolf,--as though he might possibly be\nneither a wolf ravenous with his native wolfish fur and open wolfish\ngreed; or, worse than that, a wolf, more ravenous still, in sheep's\nclothing. There was no word spoken of him as a lover; but Rachel told\nher mother that the man had called her by her Christian name, and\nMrs. Ray had fully understood the sign. \"My darling, you mustn't let\nhim do that.\" \"No, mamma; I won't. But he went on talking so fast\nthat I had not time to stop him, and after that it was not worth\nwhile.\" The project of the party was also told to Mrs. Ray, and\nRachel, sitting now with her head upon her mother's lap, owned that\nshe would like to go to it. \"Parties are not always wicked, mamma,\"\nshe said. To this assertion Mrs. Ray expressed an undecided assent,\nbut intimated her decided belief that very many parties were wicked.\n\"There will be dancing, and I do not like that,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Yet\nI was taught dancing at school,\" said Rachel. When the matter had\ngone so far as this it must be acknowledged that Rachel had done much\ntowards securing her share of mastery over her mother. \"He will be\nthere, of course,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Oh, yes; he will be there,\" said\nRachel. \"But why should I be afraid of him? Why should I live as\nthough I were afraid to meet him? Dolly thinks that I should be shut\nup close, to be taken care of; but you do not think of me like that.\nIf I was minded to be bad, shutting me up would not keep me from it.\"\nSuch arguments as these from Rachel's mouth sounded, at first, very\nterrible to Mrs. Ray, but yet she yielded to them.\n\nOn the next morning Rachel was down first, and was found by her\nsister fast engaged on the usual work of the house, as though nothing\nout of the way had occurred on the previous evening. \"Good morning,\nDolly,\" she said, and then went on arranging the things on the\nbreakfast-table. \"Good morning, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Prime, still\nspeaking like a raven. There was not a word said between them about\nthe young man or the churchyard, and at nine o'clock Mrs. Ray came\ndown to them, dressed ready for church. They seated themselves and\nate their breakfast together, and still not a word was said.\n\nIt was Mrs. Prime's custom to go to morning service at one of the\nchurches in Baslehurst; not at the old parish church which stood in\nthe churchyard near the brewery, but at a new church which had been\nbuilt as auxiliary to the other, and at which the Rev. Samuel Prong\nwas the ministering clergyman. As we shall have occasion to know\nMr. Prong it may be as well to explain here that he was not simply\na curate to old Dr. Harford, the rector of Baslehurst. He had a\nseparate district of his own, which had been divided from the old\nparish, not exactly in accordance with the rector's good pleasure.\nDr. Harford had held the living for more than forty years; he had\nheld it for nearly forty years before the division had been made, and\nhe had thought that the parish should remain a parish entire,--more\nespecially as the presentation to the new benefice was not conceded\nto him. Therefore Dr. Harford did not love Mr. Prong.\n\nBut Mrs. Prime did love him,--with that sort of love which devout\nwomen bestow upon the church minister of their choice. Mr. Prong was\nan energetic, severe, hardworking, and, I fear, intolerant young man,\nwho bestowed very much laudable care upon his sermons. The care and\nindustry were laudable, but not so the pride with which he thought of\nthem and their results. He spoke much of preaching the Gospel, and\nwas sincere beyond all doubt in his desire to do so; but he allowed\nhimself to be led away into a belief that his brethren in the\nministry around him did not preach the Gospel,--that they were\ncareless shepherds, or shepherds' dogs indifferent to the wolf, and\nin this way he had made himself unpopular among the clergy and gentry\nof the neighbourhood. It may well be understood that such a man\ncoming down upon a district, cut out almost from the centre of Dr.\nHarford's parish, would be a thorn in the side of that old man. But\nMr. Prong had his circle of friends, of very ardent friends, and\namong them Mrs. Prime was one of the most ardent. For the last year\nor two she had always attended morning service at his church, and\nvery frequently had gone there twice in the day, though the walk\nwas long and tedious, taking her the whole length of the town of\nBaslehurst. And there had been some little uneasiness between Mrs.\nRay and Mrs. Prime on the matter of this church attendance. Mrs.\nPrime had wished her mother and sister to have the benefit of Mr.\nProng's eloquence; but Mrs. Ray, though she was weak in morals, was\nstrong in her determination to adhere to Mr. Comfort of Cawston. It\nhad been matter of great sorrow to her that her daughter should leave\nMr. Comfort's church, and she had positively declined to be taken\nout of her own parish. Rachel had, of course, stuck to her mother\nin this controversy, and had said some sharp things about Mr. Prong.\nShe declared that Mr. Prong had been educated at Islington, and that\nsometimes he forgot his \"h's.\" When such things were said Mrs. Prime\nwould wax very angry, and would declare that no one could be saved\nby the perfection of Dr. Harford's pronunciation. But there was no\nquestion as to Dr. Harford, and no justification for the introduction\nof his name into the dispute. Mrs. Prime, however, did not choose\nto say anything against Mr. Comfort, with whom her husband had been\ncurate, and who, in her younger days, had been a light to her own\nfeet. Mr. Comfort was by no means such a one as Dr. Harford, though\nthe two old men were friends. Mr. Comfort had been regarded as a\nCalvinist when he was young, as Evangelical in middle life, and was\nstill known as a Low Churchman in his old age. Therefore Mrs. Prime\nwould spare him in her sneers, though she left his ministry. He had\nbecome lukewarm, but not absolutely stone cold, like the old rector\nat Baslehurst. So said Mrs. Prime. Old men would become lukewarm, and\ntherefore she could pardon Mr. Comfort. But Dr. Harford had never\nbeen warm at all,--had never been warm with the warmth which she\nvalued. Therefore she scorned him and sneered at him. In return for\nwhich Rachel scorned Mr. Prong and sneered at him.\n\nBut though it was Mrs. Prime's custom to go to church at Baslehurst,\non this special Sunday she declared her intention of accompanying her\nmother to Cawston. Not a word had been said about the young man, and\nthey all started off on their walk together in silence and gloom.\nWith such thoughts as they had in their mind it was impossible that\nthey should make the journey pleasantly. Rachel had counted on the\nwalk with her mother, and had determined that everything should be\npleasant. She would have said a word or two about Luke Rowan, and\nwould have gradually reconciled her mother to his name. But as it\nwas she said nothing; and it may be feared that her mind, during\nthe period of her worship, was not at charity with her sister. Mr.\nComfort preached his half-hour as usual, and then they all walked\nhome. Dr. Harford never exceeded twenty minutes, and had often been\nknown to finish his discourse within ten. What might be the length of\na sermon of Mr. Prong's no man or woman could foretell, but he never\nspared himself or his congregation much under an hour.\n\nThey all walked home gloomily to their dinner, and ate their cold\nmutton and potatoes in sorrow and sadness. It seemed as though no\nsort of conversation was open to them. They could not talk of their\nusual Sunday subjects. Their minds were full of one matter, and it\nseemed that that matter was by common consent to be banished from\ntheir lips for the day. In the evening, after tea, the two sisters\nagain went up to Cawston church, leaving their mother with her\nBible;--but hardly a word was spoken between them, and in the same\nsilence they sat till bed-time. To Mrs. Ray and to Rachel it had\nbeen one of the saddest, dreariest days that either of them had ever\nknown. I doubt whether the suffering of Mrs. Prime was so great. She\nwas kept up by the excitement of feeling that some great crisis was\nat hand. If Rachel were not made amenable to authority she would\nleave the cottage.\n\nWhen Rachel had run with hurrying steps from the stile in the\nchurchyard, she left Luke Rowan still standing there. He watched her\ntill she crossed into the lane, and then he turned and again looked\nout upon the still ruddy line of the horizon. The blaze of light was\ngone, but there were left, high up in the heavens, those wonderful\nhues which tinge with softly-changing colour the edges of the clouds\nwhen the brightness of some glorious sunset has passed away. He sat\nhimself on the wooden rail, watching till all of it should be over,\nand thinking, with lazy half-formed thoughts, of Rachel Ray. He did\nnot ask himself what he meant by assuring her of his friendship,\nand by claiming hers, but he declared to himself that she was very\nlovely,--more lovely than beautiful, and then smiled inwardly at the\nprettiness of her perturbed spirit. He remembered well that he had\ncalled her Rachel, and that she had allowed his doing so to pass\nby without notice; but he understood also how and why she had done\nso. He knew that she had been flurried, and that she had skipped\nthe thing because she had not known the moment at which to make her\nstand. He gave himself credit for no undue triumph, nor her discredit\nfor any undue easiness. \"What a woman she is!\" he said to himself;\n\"so womanly in everything.\" Then his mind rambled away to other\nsubjects, possibly to the practicability of making good beer instead\nof bad.\n\nHe was a young man, by no means of a bad sort, meaning to do well,\nwith high hopes in life, one who had never wronged a woman, or been\nuntrue to a friend, full of energy and hope and pride. But he was\nconceited, prone to sarcasm, sometimes cynical, and perhaps sometimes\naffected. It may be that he was not altogether devoid of that Byronic\nweakness which was so much more prevalent among young men twenty\nyears since than it is now. His two trades had been those of an\nattorney and a brewer, and yet he dabbled in romance, and probably\nwrote poetry in his bedroom. Nevertheless, there were worse young men\nabout Baslehurst than Luke Rowan.\n\n\"And now for Mr. Tappitt,\" said he, as he slowly took his legs from\noff the railing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nMR. COMFORT GIVES HIS ADVICE.\n\n\nMrs. Tappitt was very full of her party. It had grown in her mind\nas those things do grow, till it had come to assume almost the\ndimensions of a ball. When Mrs. Tappitt first consulted her husband\nand obtained his permission for the gathering, it was simply intended\nthat a few of her daughters' friends should be brought together to\nmake the visit cheerful for Miss Rowan; but the mistress of the house\nhad become ambitious; two fiddles, with a German horn, were to be\nintroduced because the piano would be troublesome; the drawing-room\ncarpet was to be taken up, and there was to be a supper in the\ndining-room. The thing in its altered shape loomed large by degrees\nupon Mr. Tappitt, and he found himself unable to stop its growth.\nThe word ball would have been fatal; but Mrs. Tappitt was too good a\ngeneral, and the girls were too judicious as lieutenants, to commit\nthemselves by the presumption of any such term. It was still Mrs.\nTappitt's evening tea-party, but it was understood in Baslehurst that\nMrs. Tappitt's evening tea-party was to be something considerable.\n\nA great success had attended this lady at the onset of her scheme.\nMrs. Butler Cornbury had called at the brewery, and had promised that\nshe would come, and that she would bring some of the Cornbury family.\nNow Mr. Butler Cornbury was the eldest son of the most puissant\nsquire within five miles of Baslehurst, and was indeed almost as\ngood as Squire himself, his father being a very old man. Mrs. Butler\nCornbury had, it is true, not been esteemed as holding any very high\nrank while shining as a beauty under the name of Patty Comfort;\nbut she had taken kindly to her new honours, and was now reckoned\nas a considerable magnate in that part of the county. She did not\ncustomarily join in the festivities of the town, and held herself\naloof from people even of higher standing than the Tappitts. But\nshe was an ambitious woman, and had inspired her lord with the\ndesire of representing Baslehurst in Parliament. There would be an\nelection at Baslehurst in the coming autumn, and Mrs. Cornbury was\nalready preparing for the fight. Hence had arisen her visit at the\nbrewery, and hence also her ready acquiescence in Mrs. Tappitt's\nhalf-pronounced request.\n\nThe party was to be celebrated on a Tuesday,--Tuesday week after\nthat Sunday which was passed so uncomfortably at Bragg's End; and on\nthe Monday Mrs. Tappitt and her daughters sat conning over the list\nof their expected guests, and preparing their invitations. It must\nbe understood that the Rowan family had somewhat grown upon them\nin estimation since Luke had been living with them. They had not\nknown much of him till he came among them, and had been prepared to\npatronise him; but they found him a young man not to be patronised by\nany means, and imperceptibly they learned to feel that his mother and\nsister would have to be esteemed by them rather as great ladies. Luke\nwas in nowise given to boasting, and had no intention of magnifying\nhis mother and sister; but things had been said which made the\nTappitts feel that Mrs. Rowan must have the best bedroom, and that\nMary Rowan must be provided with the best partners.\n\n\"And what shall we do about Rachel Ray?\" said Martha, who was sitting\nwith the list before her. Augusta, who was leaning over her sister,\npuckered up her mouth and said nothing. She had watched from the\nhouse door on that Saturday evening, and had been perfectly aware\nthat Luke Rowan had taken Rachel off towards the stile under the\ntrees. She could not bring herself to say anything against Rachel,\nbut she certainly wished that she might be excluded.\n\n\"Of course she must be asked,\" said Cherry. Cherry was sitting\nopposite to the other girls writing on a lot of envelopes the\naddresses of the notes which were afterwards to be prepared. \"We told\nher we should ask her.\" And as she spoke she addressed a cover to\n\"Miss Ray, Bragg's End Cottage, Cawston.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, my dear,\" said Mrs. Tappitt from the corner of the\nsofa on which she was sitting. \"Put that aside, Cherry. Rachel Ray is\nall very well, but considering all things I am not sure that she will\nquite do for Tuesday night. It's not quite in her line, I think.\"\n\n\"But we have mentioned it to her already, mamma,\" said Martha.\n\n\"Of course we did,\" said Cherry. \"It would be the meanest thing in\nthe world not to ask her now!\"\n\n\"I am not at all sure that Mrs. Rowan would like it,\" said Mrs.\nTappitt.\n\n\"And I don't think that Rachel is quite up to what Mary has been used\nto,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"If she has half a mind to flirt with Luke already,\" said Mrs.\nTappitt, \"I ought not to encourage it.\"\n\n\"That is such nonsense, mamma,\" said Cherry. \"If he likes her he'll\nfind her somewhere if he doesn't find her here.\"\n\n\"My dear, you shouldn't say that what I say is nonsense,\" said Mrs.\nTappitt.\n\n\"But, mamma, when we have already asked her!--Besides, she is a\nlady,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"I can't say that I think Mrs. Butler Cornbury would wish to meet\nher,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Mrs. Butler Cornbury's father is their particular friend,\" said\nMartha. \"Mrs. Ray always goes to Mr. Comfort's parties.\"\n\nIn this way the matter was discussed, and at last Cherry's eagerness\nand Martha's sense of justice carried the day. The envelope which\nCherry had addressed was brought into use, and the note to Rachel was\ndeposited in the post with all those other notes, the destination\nof which was too far to be reached by the brewery boy without\ndetrimental interference with the brewery work. We will continue\nour story by following the note which was delivered by the Cawston\npostman at Bragg's End about seven o'clock on the Tuesday morning. It\nwas delivered into Rachel's own hand, and read by her as she stood by\nthe kitchen dresser before either her mother or Mrs. Prime had come\ndown from their rooms. There still was sadness and gloom at Bragg's\nEnd. During all the Monday there had been no comfort in the house,\nand Rachel had continued to share her mother's bedroom. At intervals,\nwhen Rachel had been away, much had been said between Mrs. Ray and\nMrs. Prime; but no conclusion had been reached; no line of conduct\nhad received their joint adhesion; and the threat remained that Mrs.\nPrime would leave the cottage. Mrs. Ray, while listening to her elder\ndaughter's words, still continued to fear that evil spirits were\nhovering around them; but yet she would not consent to order Rachel\nto become a devout attendant at the Dorcas meetings. Monday had not\nbeen a Dorcas day, and therefore it had been very dull and very\ntedious.\n\nRachel stood a while with the note in her hand, fearing that the\ncontest must be brought on again and fought out to an end before she\ncould send her answer to it. She had told her mother that she was to\nbe invited, and Mrs. Ray had lacked the courage at the moment which\nwould have been necessary for an absolute and immediate rejection of\nthe proposition. If Mrs. Prime had not been with them in the house,\nRachel little doubted but that she might have gone to the party.\nIf Mrs. Prime had not been there, Rachel, as she was now gradually\nbecoming aware, might have had her own way almost in everything.\nWithout the support which Mrs. Prime gave her, Mrs. Ray would have\ngradually slid down from that stern code of morals which she had been\ninduced to adopt by the teaching of those around her, and would have\nentered upon a new school of teaching under Rachel's tutelage. But\nMrs. Prime was still there, and Rachel herself was not inclined to\nfight, if fighting could be avoided. So she put the note into her\npocket, and neither answered it or spoke of it till Mrs. Prime had\nstarted on her after-dinner walk into Baslehurst. Then she brought it\nforth and read it to her mother. \"I suppose I ought to answer it by\nthe post this evening, mamma?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, this evening! that's very short.\"\n\n\"It can be put off till to-morrow if there's any good in putting it\noff,\" said Rachel. Mrs. Ray seemed to think that there might be good\nin putting it off, or rather that there would be harm in doing it at\nonce.\n\n\"Do you particularly want to go, my dear?\" Mrs. Ray said, after a\npause.\n\n\"Yes, mamma; I should like to go.\" Then Mrs. Ray uttered a little\nsound which betokened uneasiness, and was again silent for a while.\n\n\"I can't understand why you want to go to this place,--so\nparticularly. You never used to care about such things. You know your\nsister won't like it, and I'm not at all sure that you ought to go.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why I wish it particularly, only--\"\n\n\"Well, my dear.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I can make you understand just what I mean.\"\n\n\"If you tell me, I shall understand, I suppose.\"\n\nRachel considered her words for a moment or two before she spoke, and\nthen she endeavoured to explain herself. \"It isn't that I care for\nthis party especially, mamma, though I own that, after what the girls\nhave said, I should like to be there; but I feel--\"\n\n\"You feel what, my dear?\"\n\n\"It is this, mamma. Dolly and I do not agree about these things, and\nI don't intend to let her manage me just in the way she thinks\nright.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rachel!\"\n\n\"Well, mamma, would you wish it? If you could tell me that you really\nthink it wrong to go to parties, I would give them up. Indeed it\nwouldn't be very much to give up, for I don't often get the chance.\nBut you don't say so. You only say that I had better not go, because\nDolly doesn't like it. Now, I won't be ruled by her. Don't look at me\nin that way, mamma. Is it right that I should be?\"\n\n\"You have heard what she says about going away.\"\n\n\"I shall be very sorry if she goes, and I hope she won't; but I\ncan't think that her threatening you in that way ought to make any\ndifference. And--I'll tell you more; I do particularly wish to go to\nMrs. Tappitt's, because of all that Dolly has said about,--about Mr.\nRowan. I wish to show her and you that I am not afraid to meet him.\nWhy should I be afraid of any one?\"\n\n\"You should be afraid of doing wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes; and if it were wrong to meet any other young man I ought not to\ngo; but there is nothing specially wrong in my meeting him. She has\nsaid very unkind things about it, and I intend that she shall know\nthat I will not notice them.\" As Rachel spoke Mrs. Ray looked up at\nher, and was surprised by the expression of unrelenting purpose which\nshe saw there. There had come over her face that motion in her eyes\nand that arching of her brows which Mrs. Ray had seen before, but\nwhich hitherto she had hardly construed into their true meaning. Now\nshe was beginning to construe these signs aright, and to understand\nthat there would be difficulty in managing her little family.\n\nThe conversation ended in an undertaking on Rachel's part that she\nwould not answer the note till the following day. \"Of course that\nmeans,\" said Rachel, \"that I am to answer it just as Dolly thinks\nfit.\" But she repented of these words as soon as they were spoken,\nand repented of them almost in ashes when her mother declared, with\ntears in her eyes, that it was not her intention to be guided by\nDorothea in this matter. \"You ought not to say such things as that,\nRachel,\" she said. \"No, mamma, I ought not; for there is no one so\ngood as you are; and if you'll say that you think I ought not to go,\nI'll write to Cherry, and explain it to her at once. I don't care a\nbit about the party,--as far as the party is concerned.\" But Mrs. Ray\nwould not now pronounce any injunction on the matter. She had made\nup her mind as to what she would do. She would call upon Mr. Comfort\nat the parsonage, explain the whole thing to him, and be guided\naltogether by his counsel.\n\nNot a word was said in the cottage about the invitation when Mrs.\nPrime came back in the evening, nor was a word said on the following\nmorning. Mrs. Ray had declared her intention of going up to the\nparsonage, and neither of her daughters had asked her why she was\ngoing. Rachel had no need to ask, for she well understood her\nmother's purpose. As to Mrs. Prime, she was in these days black and\nfull of gloom, asking but few questions, watching the progress of\nevents with the eyes of an evil-singing prophetess, but keeping back\nher words till the moment should come in which she would be driven by\nher inner impulses to speak them forth with terrible strength. When\nthe breakfast was over, Mrs. Ray took her bonnet and started forth to\nthe parsonage.\n\nI do not know that a widow, circumstanced as was Mrs. Ray, could do\nbetter than go to her clergyman for advice, but nevertheless, when\nshe got to Mr. Comfort's gate she felt that the task of explaining\nher purpose would not be without difficulty. It would be necessary to\ntell everything; how Rachel had become suddenly an object of interest\nto Mr. Luke Rowan, how Dorothea suspected terrible things, and how\nRachel was anxious for the world's vanities. The more she thought\nover it, the more sure she felt that Mr. Comfort would put an embargo\nupon the party. It seemed but yesterday that he had been telling\nher, with all his pulpit unction, that the pleasures of this world\nshould never be allowed to creep near the heart. With doubting feet\nand doubting heart she walked up to the parsonage door, and almost\nimmediately found herself in the presence of her husband's old\nfriend.\n\nWhatever faults there might be in Mr. Comfort's character, he was at\nany rate good-natured and patient. That he was sincere, too, no one\nwho knew him well had ever doubted,--sincere, that is, as far as his\nintentions went. When he endeavoured to teach his flock that they\nshould despise money, he thought that he despised it himself. When\nhe told the little children that this world should be as nothing to\nthem, he did not remember that he himself enjoyed keenly the good\nthings of this world. If he had a fault it was perhaps this,--that he\nwas a hard man at a bargain. He liked to have all his temporalities,\nand make them go as far as they could be stretched. There was the\nless excuse for this, seeing that his children were well, and even\nrichly, settled in life, and that his wife, should she ever be left a\nwidow, would have ample provision for her few remaining years. He had\ngiven his daughter a considerable fortune, without which perhaps the\nCornbury Grange people would not have welcomed her so kindly as they\nhad done, and now, as he was still growing rich, it was supposed that\nhe would leave her more.\n\nHe listened to Mrs. Ray with the greatest attention, having first\nbegged her to recruit her strength with a glass of wine. As she\ncontinued to tell her story he interrupted her from time to time with\ngood-natured little words, and then, when she had done, he asked\nafter Luke Rowan's worldly means. \"The young man has got something,\nI suppose,\" said he.\n\n\"Got something!\" repeated Mrs. Ray, not exactly catching his meaning.\n\n\"He has some share in the brewery, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"I believe he has, or is to have. So Rachel told me.\"\n\n\"Yes,--yes; I've heard of him before. If Tappitt doesn't take him\ninto the concern he'll have to give him a very serious bit of money.\nThere's no doubt about the young man having means. Well, Mrs. Ray, I\ndon't suppose Rachel could do better than take him.\"\n\n\"Take him!\"\n\n\"Yes,--why not? Between you and me, Rachel is growing into a very\nhandsome girl,--a very handsome girl indeed. I'd no idea she'd be so\ntall, and carry herself so well.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Comfort, good looks are very dangerous for a young woman.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; indeed they are. But still, you know, handsome girls very\noften do very well; and if this young man fancies Miss Rachel--\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Comfort, there hasn't been anything of that. I don't\nsuppose he has ever thought of it, and I'm sure she hasn't.\"\n\n\"But young people get to think of it. I shouldn't be disposed to\nprevent their coming together in a proper sort of way. I don't like\nnight walkings in churchyards, certainly, but I really think that was\nonly an accident.\"\n\n\"I'm sure Rachel didn't mean it.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure she didn't mean anything improper. And as for him, if\nhe admires her, it was natural enough that he should go after her. If\nyou ask my advice, Mrs. Ray, I should just tell her to be cautious,\nbut I shouldn't be especially careful to separate them. Marriage is\nthe happiest condition for a young woman, and for a young man, too.\nAnd how are young people to get married if they are not allowed to\nsee each other?\"\n\n\"And about the party, Mr. Comfort?\"\n\n\"Oh, let her go; there'll be no harm. And I'll tell you what, Mrs.\nRay; my daughter, Mrs. Cornbury, is going from here, and she shall\npick her up and bring her home. It's always well for a young girl to\ngo with a married woman.\" Then Mrs. Ray did take her glass of sherry,\nand walked back to Bragg's End, wondering a good deal, and not\naltogether at ease in her mind as to that great question,--what line\nof moral conduct might best befit a devout Christian.\n\nSomething also had been said at the interview about Mrs. Prime. Mrs.\nRay had intimated that Mrs. Prime would separate herself from her\nmother and her sister unless her views were allowed to prevail in\nthis question regarding the young man from the brewery. But Mr.\nComfort, in what few words he had said on this part of the subject,\nhad shown no consideration whatever for Mrs. Prime. \"Then she'll\nbehave very wickedly,\" he had said. \"But I'm afraid Mrs. Prime has\nlearned to think too much of her own opinion lately. If that's what\nshe has got by going to Mr. Prong she had better have remained in her\nown parish.\" After that, nothing more was said about Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"Oh, let her go; there'll be no harm.\" That had been Mr. Comfort's\ndictum about the evening party. Such as it was, Mrs. Ray felt herself\nbound to be guided by it. She had told Rachel that she would ask the\nclergyman's advice, and take it, whatever it might be. Nevertheless\nshe did not find herself to be easy as she walked home. Mr. Comfort's\nlatter teachings tended to upset all the convictions of her life.\nAccording to his teaching, as uttered in the sanctum of his own\nstudy, young men were not to be regarded as ravening wolves. And that\nmeeting in the churchyard, which had utterly overwhelmed Dorothea\nby the weight of its iniquity, and which even to her had been\nvery terrible, was a mere nothing;--a venial accident on Rachel's\npart, and the most natural proceeding in the world on the part of\nLuke Rowan! That it was natural enough for a wolf Mrs. Ray could\nunderstand; but she was now told that the lamb might go out and meet\nthe wolf without any danger! And then those questions about Rowan's\nshare in the brewery, and Mr. Comfort's ready assertion that the\nyoung wolf,--man or wolf, as the case might be,--was well to do in\nthe world! In fact Mrs. Ray's interview with her clergyman had not\ngone exactly as she had expected, and she was bewildered; and the\npath into evil,--if it was a path into evil,--was made so easy and\npleasant! Mrs. Ray had already considered the difficult question of\nRachel's journey to the party, and journey home again; but provision\nwas now made for all that in a way that was indeed very comfortable,\nbut which might make Rachel very vain. She was to be ushered into\nMrs. Tappitt's drawing-room under the wing of the most august lady\nof the neighbourhood. After that, for the remaining half-hour of her\nwalk home, Mrs. Ray gave her mind up to the consideration of what\ndress Rachel should wear.\n\nWhen Mrs. Ray reached her own gate, Rachel was in the garden waiting\nfor her. \"Well, mamma?\" she said. \"Is Dorothea at home?\" Mrs. Ray\nasked; and on being informed that Dorothea was at work within, she\ndesired Rachel to follow her up to her bedroom. When there she told\nher budget of news,--not stinting her child of the gratification\nwhich it was sure to give. She said nothing about Luke Rowan and\nhis means, keeping that portion of Mr. Comfort's recommendation\nto herself; but she declared it out as a fact, that Rachel was to\naccept the invitation, and to be carried to the party by Mrs. Butler\nCornbury. \"Oh, mamma! Dear mamma!\" said Rachel, who was leaning\nagainst the side of the bed. Then she gave a long sigh, and a bright\ncolour came over her face,--almost as though she were blushing. But\nshe said no more at the moment, but allowed her mind to run off and\nrevel in its own thoughts. She had indeed longed to go to this party,\nthough she had taught herself to believe that she could bear being\ntold that she was not to go without disappointment. \"And now we must\nlet Dorothea know,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Yes,--we must let her know,\" said\nRachel; but her mind was away, straying, I fear, under the churchyard\nelms with Luke Rowan, and looking at the arm amidst the clouds. He\nhad said that it was stretched out as though to take her; and she had\nnever shaken off from her imagination the idea that it was his arm on\nwhich she had been bidden to look,--the arm which had afterwards held\nher when she strove to go.\n\nIt was tea-time before courage was mustered for telling the facts to\nMrs. Prime. Mrs. Prime, after dinner, had gone into Baslehurst; but\nthe meeting at Miss Pucker's had not been a regular full gathering,\nand Mrs. Prime had come back to tea. There was no hot toast, and no\nclotted cream. It may appear selfish on the part of Mrs. Ray and\nRachel that they should have kept such good things for their only\nlittle private banquets, but, in truth, such delicacies did not suit\nMrs. Prime. Nice things aggravated her spirits and made her fretful.\nShe liked the tea to be stringy and bitter, and she liked the bread\nto be stale;--as she preferred also that her weeds should be battered\nand old. She was approaching that stage of discipline at which ashes\nbecome pleasant eating, and sackcloth is grateful to the skin. The\nself-indulgences of the saints in this respect often exceed anything\nthat is done by the sinners.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" said Mrs. Ray, and she looked down upon the dark dingy\nfluid in her cup as she spoke, \"I have been up to Mr. Comfort's\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Yes; I heard you say you were going there.\"\n\n\"I went to ask him for advice.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"As I was in much doubt, I thought it right to go to the clergyman of\nmy parish.\"\n\n\"I don't think much about parishes myself. Mr. Comfort is an old\nman now, and I fear he does not give himself up to the Gospel as he\nused to do. If people were called upon to bind themselves down to\nparishes, what would those poor creatures do who have over them such\na pastor as Dr. Harford?\"\n\n\"Dr. Harford is a very good man, I believe,\" said Rachel, \"and he\nkeeps two curates.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, Rachel, you know but little about it. He does keep two\ncurates,--but what are they? They go to cricket-matches, and among\nyoung women with bows and arrows! If you had really wanted advice,\nmamma, I would sooner have heard that you had gone to Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"But I didn't go to Mr. Prong, my dear;--and I don't mean. Mr. Prong\nis all very well, I dare say, but I've known Mr. Comfort for nearly\nthirty years, and I don't like sudden changes.\" Then Mrs. Ray stirred\nher tea with rather a quick motion of her hand. Rachel said not a\nword, but her mother's sharp speech and spirited manner was very\npleasant to her. She was quite contented now that Mr. Comfort should\nbe regarded as the family counsellor. She remembered how well she had\nloved Mr. Comfort always, and thought of days when Patty Comfort had\nbeen very good-natured to her as a child.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Mrs. Prime. \"Of course, mamma, you must judge\nfor yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I must; or rather, as I didn't wish to trust my own\njudgment, I went to Mr. Comfort for advice. He says that he sees no\nharm in Rachel going to this party.\"\n\n\"Party! what party?\" almost screamed Mrs. Prime. Mrs. Ray had\nforgotten that nothing had as yet been said to Dorothea about the\ninvitation.\n\n\"Mrs. Tappitt is going to give a party at the brewery,\" said Rachel,\nin her very softest voice, \"and she has asked me.\"\n\n\"And you are going? You mean to let her go?\" Mrs. Prime had asked\ntwo questions, and she received two answers. \"Yes,\" said Rachel; \"I\nsuppose I shall go, as mamma says so.\" \"Mr. Comfort says there is no\nharm in it,\" said Mrs. Ray; \"and Mrs. Butler Cornbury is to come from\nthe parsonage to take her up.\" All question as to Dorcas discipline\nto be inflicted daily upon Rachel on account of that sin of which\nshe had been guilty in standing under the elms with a young man was\nutterly lost in this terrible proposition! Instead of being sent to\nMiss Pucker in her oldest merino dress, Rachel was to be decked in\nmuslin and finery, and sent out to a dancing party at which this\nyoung man was to be the hero! It was altogether too much for Dorothea\nPrime. She slowly wiped the crumbs from off her dingy crape, and with\ncreaking noise pushed back her chair. \"Mother,\" she said, \"I couldn't\nhave believed it! I could not have believed it!\" Then she withdrew to\nher own chamber.\n\nMrs. Ray was much afflicted; but not the less did Rachel look out for\nthe returning postman, on his road into Baslehurst, that she might\nsend her little note to Mrs. Tappitt, signifying her acceptance of\nthat lady's kind invitation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR MRS. TAPPITT'S PARTY.\n\n\nI am disposed to think that Mrs. Butler Cornbury did Mrs. Tappitt an\ninjury when she with so much ready goodnature accepted the invitation\nfor the party, and that Mrs. Tappitt was aware of this before the\nnight of the party arrived. She was put on her mettle in a way that\nwas disagreeable to her, and forced into an amount of submissive\nsupplication to Mr. Tappitt for funds, which was vexatious to her\nspirit. Mrs. Tappitt was a good wife, who never ran her husband into\ndebt, and kept nothing secret from him in the management of her\nhousehold,--nothing at least which it behoved him to know. But she\nunderstood the privileges of her position, and could it have been\npossible for her to have carried through this party without extra\nhousehold moneys, or without any violent departure from her usual\ncustoms of life, she could have snubbed her husband's objections\ncomfortably, and have put him into the background for the occasion\nwithout any inconvenience to herself or power of remonstrance from\nhim. But when Mrs. Butler Cornbury had been gracious, and when the\nfiddles and horn had become a fact to be accomplished, when Mrs.\nRowan and Mary began to loom large on her imagination and a regular\nsupper was projected, then Mrs. Tappitt felt the necessity of\nsuperior aid, and found herself called upon to reconcile her lord.\n\nAnd this work was the more difficult and the more disagreeable to\nher feelings because she had already pooh-poohed her husband when he\nasked a question about the party. \"Just a few friends got together by\nthe girls,\" she had said. \"Leave it all to them, my dear. It's not\nvery often they see anybody at home.\"\n\n\"I believe I see my friends as often as most people in Baslehurst,\"\nMr. Tappitt had replied indignantly, \"and I suppose my friends are\ntheir friends.\" So there had been a little soreness which made the\nlady's submission the more disagreeable to her.\n\n\"Butler Cornbury! He's a puppy. I don't want to see him, and what's\nmore, I won't vote for him.\"\n\n\"You need not tell her so, my dear; and he's not coming. I suppose\nyou like your girls to hold their heads up in the place; and if they\nshow that they've respectable people with them at home, respectable\npeople will be glad to notice them.\"\n\n\"Respectable! If our girls are to be made respectable by giving grand\ndances, I'd rather not have them respectable. How much is the whole\nthing to cost?\"\n\n\"Well, very little, T.; not much more than one of your Christmas\ndinner-parties. There'll be just the music, and the lights, and a\nbit of something to eat. What people drink at such times comes to\nnothing,--just a little negus and lemonade. We might possibly have a\nbottle or two of champagne at the supper-table, for the look of the\nthing.\"\n\n\"Champagne!\" exclaimed the brewer. He had never yet incurred the cost\nof a bottle of champagne within his own house, though he thought\nnothing of it at public dinners. The idea was too much for him; and\nMrs. Tappitt, feeling how the ground lay, gave that up,--at any rate\nfor the present. She gave up the champagne; but in abandoning that,\nshe obtained the marital sanction, a quasi sanction which he was too\nhonourable as a husband afterwards to repudiate, for the music and\nthe eatables. Mrs. Tappitt knew that she had done well, and prepared\nfor his dinner that day a beef-steak pie, made with her own hands.\nTappitt was not altogether a dull man, and understood these little\nsigns. \"Ah,\" said he, \"I wonder how much that pie is to cost me?\"\n\n\"Oh, T., how can you say such things! As if you didn't have\nbeef-steak pie as often as it's good for you.\" The pie, however, had\nits effect, as also did the exceeding \"boilishness\" of the water\nwhich was brought in for his gin-toddy that night; and it was known\nthroughout the establishment that papa was in a good humour, and that\nmamma had been very clever.\n\n\"The girls must have had new dresses anyway before the month was\nout,\" Mrs. Tappitt said to her husband the next morning before he had\nleft the conjugal chamber.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that they're to have gowns made on purpose for\nthis party?\" said the brewer; and it seemed by the tone of his voice\nthat the hot gin and water had lost its kindly effects.\n\n\"My dear, they must be dressed, you know. I'm sure no girls in\nBaslehurst cost less in the way of finery. In the ordinary way they'd\nhave had new frocks almost immediately.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" Mr. Tappitt was shaving just at this moment, and dashed\naside his razor for a moment to utter this one word. He intended to\nsignify how perfectly well he was aware that a muslin frock prepared\nfor an evening party would not fill the place of a substantial\nmorning dress.\n\n\"Well, my dear, I'm sure the girls ain't unreasonable; nor am I.\nFive-and-thirty shillings apiece for them would do it all. And I\nshan't want anything myself this year in September.\" Now Mr. Tappitt,\nwho was a man of sentiment, always gave his wife some costly article\nof raiment on the 1st of September, calling her his partridge and\nhis bird,--for on that day they had been married. Mrs. Tappitt had\nfrequently offered to intromit the ceremony when calling upon his\ngenerosity for other purposes, but the September gift had always been\nforthcoming.\n\n\"Will thirty-five shillings a-piece do it?\" said he, turning round\nwith his face all covered with lather. Then again he went to work\nwith his razor just under his right ear.\n\n\"Well, yes; I think it will. Two pounds each for the three shall do\nit anyway.\"\n\nMr. Tappitt gave a little jump at this increased demand for fifteen\nshillings, and not being in a good position for jumping, encountered\nan unpleasant accident, and uttered a somewhat vehement exclamation.\n\"There,\" said he, \"now I've cut myself, and it's your fault. Oh dear;\noh dear! When I cut myself there it never stops. It's no good doing\nthat, Margaret; it only makes it worse. There; now you've got the\nsoap and blood all down inside my shirt.\"\n\nMrs. Tappitt on this occasion was subjected to some trouble, for the\nwound on Mr. Tappitt's cheek-bone declined to be stanched at once;\nbut she gained her object, and got the dresses for her daughters.\nIt was not taken by them as a drawback on their happiness that they\nhad to make the dresses themselves, for they were accustomed to such\nwork; but this necessity joined to all other preparations for the\nparty made them very busy. Till twelve at night on three evenings\nthey sat with their smart new things in their laps and their needles\nin their hands; but they did not begrudge this, as Mrs. Butler\nCornbury was coming to the brewery. They were very anxious to get the\nheavy part of the work done before the Rowans should arrive, doubting\nwhether they would become sufficiently intimate with Mary to tell her\nall their little domestic secrets, and do their work in the presence\nof their new friend during the first day of her sojourn in the house.\nSo they toiled like slaves on the Wednesday and Thursday in order\nthat they might walk about like ladies on the Friday and Saturday.\n\nBut the list of their guests gave them more trouble than aught else.\nWhom should they get to meet Mrs. Butler Cornbury? At one time Mrs.\nTappitt had proposed to word certain of her invitations with a\nspecial view to this end. Had her idea been carried out people who\nmight not otherwise have come were to be tempted by a notification\nthat they were especially asked to meet Mrs. Butler Cornbury. But\nMartha had said that this she thought would not do for a dance.\n\"People do do it, my dear,\" Mrs. Tappitt had pleaded.\n\n\"Not for dancing, mamma,\" said Martha. \"Besides, she would be sure to\nhear of it, and perhaps she might not like it.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"It would show that we\nappreciated her kindness.\" The plan, however, was abandoned.\n\nOf the Baslehurst folk there were so few that were fitted to meet\nMrs. Butler Cornbury! There was old Miss Harford, the rector's\ndaughter. She was fit to meet anybody in the county, and, as she was\ngood-natured, might probably come. But she was an old maid, and was\nnever very bright in her attire. \"Perhaps Captain Gordon's lady would\ncome,\" Mrs. Tappitt suggested. But at this proposition all the girls\nshook their heads. Captain Gordon had lately taken a villa close to\nBaslehurst, but had shown himself averse to any intercourse with the\ntownspeople. Mrs. Tappitt had called on his \"lady,\" and the call\nhad not even been returned, a card having been sent by post in an\nenvelope.\n\n\"It would be no good, mamma,\" said Martha, \"and she would only make\nus uncomfortable if she did come.\"\n\n\"She is always awfully stuck up in church,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"And her nose is red at the end,\" said Cherry.\n\nTherefore no invitation was sent to Captain Gordon's house.\n\n\"If we could only get the Fawcetts,\" said Augusta. The Fawcetts were\na large family living in the centre of Baslehurst, in which there\nwere four daughters, all noted for dancing, and noted also for being\nthe merriest, nicest, and most popular girls in Devonshire. There was\na fat good-natured mother, and a thin good-natured father who had\nonce been a banker at Exeter. Everybody desired to know the Fawcetts,\nand they were the especial favourites of Mrs. Butler Cornbury. But\nthen Mrs. Fawcett did not visit Mrs. Tappitt. The girls and the\nmothers had a bowing acquaintance, and were always very gracious\nto each other. Old Fawcett and old Tappitt saw each other in town\ndaily, and knew each other as well as they knew the cross in the\nbutter-market; but none of the two families ever went into each\nother's houses. It had been tacitly admitted among them that the\nFawcetts were above the Tappitts, and so the matter had rested. But\nnow, if anything could be done? \"Mrs. Butler Cornbury is all very\nwell, of course,\" said Augusta, \"but it would be so nice for Mary\nRowan to see the Miss Fawcetts dancing here.\"\n\nMartha shook her head, but at last she did write a note in the\nmothers name. \"My girls are having a little dance, to welcome a\nfriend from London, and they would feel so much obliged if your young\nladies would come. Mrs. Butler Cornbury has been kind enough to say\nthat she would join us, &c., &c., &c.\" Mrs. Tappitt and Augusta were\nin a seventh heaven of happiness when Mrs. Fawcett wrote to say that\nthree of her girls would be delighted to accept the invitation; and\neven the discreet Martha and the less ambitious Cherry were well\npleased.\n\n\"I declare I think we've been very fortunate,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Only the Miss Fawcetts will get all the best partners,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Augusta, holding up her head.\n\nBut there had been yet another trouble. It was difficult for them to\nget people proper to meet Mrs. Butler Cornbury; but what must they do\nas to those people who must come and who were by no means proper to\nmeet her? There were the Griggses for instance, who lived out of town\nin a wonderfully red brick house, the family of a retired Baslehurst\ngrocer. They had been asked before Mrs. Cornbury's call had been\nmade, or, I fear, their chance of coming to the party would have\nbeen small. There was one young Griggs, a man very terrible in his\nvulgarity, loud, rampant, conspicuous with villainous jewellery, and\nodious with the worst abominations of perfumery. He was loathsome\neven to the Tappitt girls; but then the Griggses and the Tappitts\nhad known each other for half a century, and among their ordinary\nacquaintances Adolphus Griggs might have been endured. But what\nshould they do when he asked to be introduced to Josceline Fawcett?\nOf all men he was the most unconscious of his own defects. He had\nonce shown some symptoms of admiration for Cherry, by whom he was\nhated with an intensity of dislike that had amounted to a passion.\nShe had begged that he might be omitted from the list; but Mrs.\nTappitt had been afraid of angering their father.\n\nThe Rules also would be much in the way. Old Joshua Rule was a\nmaltster, living in Cawston, and his wife and daughter had been\nasked before the accession of the Butler Cornbury dignity. Old Rule\nhad supplied the brewery with malt almost ever since it had been a\nbrewery; and no more harmless people than Mrs. Rule and her daughter\nexisted in the neighbourhood;--but they were close neighbours of the\nComforts, of Mrs. Cornbury's father and mother, and Mr. Comfort would\nhave as soon asked his sexton to dine with him as the Rules. The\nRules never expected such a thing, and therefore lived on very good\nterms with the clergyman. \"I'm afraid she won't like meeting Mrs.\nRule,\" Augusta had said to her mother; and then the mother had shaken\nher head.\n\nEarly in the week, before Rachel had accepted the invitation, Cherry\nhad written to her friend. \"Of course you'll come,\" Cherry had said;\n\"and as you may have some difficulty in getting here and home again,\nI'll ask old Mrs. Rule to call for you. I know she'll have a place in\nthe fly, and she's very good-natured.\" In answer to this Rachel had\nwritten a separate note to Cherry, telling her friend in the least\nboastful words which she could use that provision had been already\nmade for her coming and going. \"Mamma was up at Mr. Comfort's\nyesterday,\" Rachel wrote, \"and he was so kind as to say that Mrs.\nButler Cornbury would take me and bring me back. I am very much\nobliged to you all the same, and to Mrs. Rule.\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" said Cherry, who had received her note in the\nmidst of one of the family conferences; \"Augusta said that Mrs.\nButler Cornbury would not like to meet Rachel Ray; but she is going\nto bring her in her own carriage.\"\n\n\"I never said anything of the kind,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Oh, but you did, Augusta; or mamma did, or somebody. How nice for\nRachel to be chaperoned by Mrs. Butler Cornbury!\"\n\n\"I wonder what she'll wear,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, who had on that\nmorning achieved her victory over the wounded brewer in the matter of\nthe three dresses.\n\nOn the Friday morning Mrs. Rowan came with her daughter, Luke having\nmet them at Exeter on the Thursday. Mrs. Rowan was a somewhat stately\nlady, slow in her movements and careful in her speech, so that the\ngirls were at first very glad that they had valiantly worked up their\nfinery before her coming. But Mary was by no means stately; she was\nyounger than them, very willing to be pleased, with pleasant round\neager eyes, and a kindly voice. Before she had been three hours in\nthe house Cherry had claimed Mary for her own, had told her all about\nthe party, all about the dresses, all about Mrs. Butler Cornbury and\nthe Miss Fawcetts, and a word or two also about Rachel Ray. \"I can\ntell you somebody that's almost in love with her.\" \"You don't mean\nLuke?\" said Mary. \"Yes, but I do,\" said Cherry; \"but of course I'm\nonly in fun.\" On the Saturday Mary was hard at work herself assisting\nin the decoration of the drawing-room, and before the all-important\nTuesday came even Mrs. Rowan and Mrs. Tappitt were confidential. Mrs.\nRowan perceived at once that Mrs. Tappitt was provincial,--as she\ntold her son, but she was a good motherly woman, and on the whole,\nMrs. Rowan condescended to be gracious to her.\n\nAt Bragg's End the preparations for the party required almost as much\nthought as did those at the brewery, and involved perhaps deeper\ncare. It may be remembered that Mrs. Prime, when her ears were first\nastounded by that unexpected revelation, wiped the crumbs from out of\nher lap and walked off, wounded in spirit, to her own room. On that\nevening Rachel saw no more of her sister. Mrs. Ray went up to her\ndaughter's bedroom, but stayed there only a minute or two. \"What does\nshe say?\" asked Rachel, almost in a whisper. \"She is very unhappy.\nShe says that unless I can be made to think better of this she must\nleave the cottage. I told her what Mr. Comfort says, but she only\nsneers at Mr. Comfort. I'm sure I'm endeavouring to do the best I\ncan.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do, mamma, to say that she should manage everything,\notherwise I'm sure I'd give up the party.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; I don't want you to do that,--not after what Mr.\nComfort says.\" Mrs. Ray had in truth gone to the clergyman feeling\nsure that he would have given his word against the party, and that,\nso strengthened, she could have taken a course that would have been\noffensive to neither of her daughters. She had expected, too, that\nshe would have returned home armed with such clerical thunders\nagainst the young man as would have quieted Rachel and have\nsatisfied Dorothea. But in all this she had been,--I may hardly\nsay disappointed,--but dismayed and bewildered by advice the very\nopposite to that which she had expected. It was perplexing, but she\nseemed to be aware that she had no alternative now, but to fight the\nbattle on Rachel's side. She had cut herself off from all anchorage\nexcept that given by Mr. Comfort, and therefore it behoved her to\ncling to that with absolute tenacity. Rachel must go to the party,\neven though Dorothea should carry out her threat. On that night\nnothing more was said about Dorothea, and Mrs. Ray allowed herself to\nbe gradually drawn into a mild discussion about Rachel's dress.\n\nBut there was nearly a week left to them of this sort of life. Early\non the following morning Mrs. Prime left the cottage, saying that she\nshould dine with Miss Pucker, and betook herself at once to a small\nhouse in a back street of the town, behind the new church, in which\nlived Mr. Prong. Have I as yet said that Mr. Prong was a bachelor?\nSuch was the fact; and there were not wanting those in Baslehurst who\ndeclared that he would amend the fault by marrying Mrs. Prime. But\nthis rumour, if it ever reached her, had no effect upon her. The\nworld would be nothing to her if she were to be debarred by the\nwickedness of loose tongues from visiting the clergyman of her\nchoice. She went, therefore, in her present difficulty to Mr. Prong.\n\nMr. Samuel Prong was a little man, over thirty, with scanty,\nlight-brown hair, with a small, rather upturned nose, with eyes by no\nmeans deficient in light and expression, but with a mean mouth. His\nforehead was good, and had it not been for his mouth his face would\nhave been expressive of intellect and of some firmness. But there\nwas about his lips an assumption of character and dignity which\nhis countenance and body generally failed to maintain; and there\nwas a something in the carriage of his head and in the occasional\nprojection of his chin, which was intended to add to his dignity, but\nwhich did, I think, only make the failure more palpable. He was a\ndevout, good man; not self-indulgent; perhaps not more self-ambitious\nthan it becomes a man to be; sincere, hard-working, sufficiently\nintelligent, true in most things to the instincts of his\ncalling,--but deficient in one vital qualification for a clergyman of\nthe Church of England; he was not a gentleman. May I not call it a\nnecessary qualification for a clergyman of any church? He was not a\ngentleman. I do not mean to say that he was a thief or a liar; nor\ndo I mean hereby to complain that he picked his teeth with his fork\nand misplaced his \"h's.\" I am by no means prepared to define what\nI do mean,--thinking, however, that most men and most women will\nunderstand me. Nor do I speak of this deficiency in his clerical\naptitudes as being injurious to him simply,--or even chiefly,--among\nfolk who are themselves gentle; but that his efficiency for clerical\npurposes was marred altogether, among high and low, by his misfortune\nin this respect. It is not the owner of a good coat that sees\nand admires its beauty. It is not even they who have good coats\nthemselves who recognize the article on the back of another. They who\nhave not good coats themselves have the keenest eyes for the coats\nof their better-clad neighbours. As it is with coats, so it is with\nthat which we call gentility. It is caught at a word, it is seen at a\nglance, it is appreciated unconsciously at a touch by those who have\nnone of it themselves. It is the greatest of all aids to the doctor,\nthe lawyer, the member of Parliament,--though in that position a man\nmay perhaps prosper without it,--and to the statesman; but to the\nclergyman it is a vital necessity. Now Mr. Prong was not a gentleman.\n\nMrs. Prime told her tale to Mr. Prong, as Mrs. Ray had told hers to\nMr. Comfort. It need not be told again here. I fear that she made\nthe most of her sister's imprudence, but she did not do so with\nintentional injustice. She declared her conviction that Rachel might\nstill be made to go in a straight course, if only she could be guided\nby a hand sufficiently strict and armed with absolute power. Then she\nwent on to tell Mr. Prong how Mrs. Ray had gone off to Mr. Comfort,\nas she herself had now come to him. It was hard,--was it not?--for\npoor Rachel that the story of her few minutes' whispering under\nthe elm tree should thus be bruited about among the ecclesiastical\ncouncillors of the locality. Mr. Prong sat with patient face and with\nmild demeanour while the simple story of Rachel's conduct was being\ntold; but when to this was added the iniquity of Mr. Comfort's\nadvice, the mouth assumed the would-be grandeur, the chin came out,\nand to any one less infatuated than Mrs. Prime it would have been\napparent that the purse was not made of silk, but that a coarser\nmaterial had come to hand in the manufacture.\n\n\"What shall the sheep do,\" said Mr. Prong, \"when the shepherd\nslumbers in the folds?\" Then he shook his head and puckered up his\nmouth.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Prime; \"it is well for the sheep that there are still\nleft a few who do not run from their work, even in the heat of the\nnoonday sun.\"\n\nMr. Prong closed his eyes and bowed his head, and then reassumed that\npeculiarly disagreeable look about his mouth by which he thought\nto assert his dignity, intending thereby to signify that he would\nwillingly reject the compliment as unnecessary, were he not forced to\naccept it as being true. He knew himself to be a shepherd who did not\nfear the noonday heat; but he was wrong in this,--that he suspected\nall other shepherds of stinting their work. It appeared to him that\nno sheep could nibble his grass in wholesome content, unless some\nshepherd were at work at him constantly with his crook. It was for\nthe shepherd, as he thought, to know what tufts of grass were rank,\nand in what spots the herbage might be bitten down to the bare\nground. A shepherd who would allow his flock to feed at large under\nhis eye, merely watching his fences and folding his ewes and lambs\nat night, was a truant who feared the noonday sun. Such a one had Mr.\nComfort become, and therefore Mr. Prong despised him in his heart.\nAll sheep will not endure such ardent shepherding as that practised\nby Mr. Prong, and therefore he was driven to seek out for himself a\npeculiar flock. These to him were the elect of Baslehurst, and of his\nelect, Mrs. Prime was the most elect. Now this fault is not uncommon\namong young ardent clergymen.\n\nI will not repeat the conversation that took place between the two,\nbecause they used holy words and spoke on holy subjects. In doing so\nthey were both sincere, and not, as regarded their language, fairly\nsubject to ridicule. In their judgment I think they were defective.\nHe sustained Mrs. Prime in her resolution to quit the cottage unless\nshe could induce her mother to put a stop to that great iniquity of\nthe brewery. \"The Tappitts,\" he said, \"were worldly people,--very\nworldly people; utterly unfit to be the associates of the sister of\nhis friend. As to the 'young man,' he thought that nothing further\nshould be said at present, but that Rachel should be closely\nwatched,--very closely watched.\" Mrs. Prime asked him to call upon\nher mother and explain his views, but he declined to do this. \"He\nwould have been most willing,--so willing! but he could not force\nhimself where he would be unwelcome!\" Mrs. Prime was, if necessary,\nto quit the cottage and take up her temporary residence with Miss\nPucker; but Mr. Prong was inclined to think, knowing something of\nMrs. Ray's customary softness of character, that if Mrs. Prime were\nfirm, things would not be driven to such a pass as that. Mrs. Prime\nsaid that she would be firm, and she looked as though she intended to\nkeep her word.\n\nMr. Prong's manner as he bade adieu to his favourite sheep was\ncertainly of a nature to justify that rumour to which allusion has\nbeen made. He pressed Mrs. Prime's hand very closely, and invoked a\nblessing on her head in a warm whisper. But such signs among such\npeople do not bear the meaning which they have in the outer world.\nThese people are demonstrative and unctuous,--whereas the outer world\nis reticent and dry. They are perhaps too free with their love, but\nthe fault is better than that other fault of no love at all. Mr.\nProng was a little free with his love, but Mrs. Prime took it all in\ngood part, and answered him with an equal fervour. \"If I can help\nyou, dear friend,\"--and he still held her hand in his,--\"come to me\nalways. You never can come too often.\"\n\n\"You can help me, and I will come, always,\" she said, returning\nhis pressure with mutual warmth. But there was no touch of earthly\naffection in her pressure; and if there was any in his at its close,\nthere had, at any rate, been none at its commencement.\n\nWhile Mrs. Prime was thus employed, Rachel and her mother became\nwarm upon the subject of the dress, and when the younger widow\nreturned home to the cottage, the elder widow was actually engaged\nin Baslehurst on the purchase of trappings and vanities. Her little\nhoard was opened, and some pretty piece of muslin was purchased by\naid of which, with the needful ribbons, Rachel might be made, not\nfit, indeed, for Mrs. Butler Cornbury's carriage,--no such august\nfitness was at all contemplated by herself,--but nice and tidy, so\nthat her presence need not be a disgrace. And it was pretty to see\nhow Mrs. Ray revelled in these little gauds for her daughter now that\nthe barrier of her religious awe was broken down, and that the waters\nof the world had made their way in upon her. She still had a feeling\nthat she was being drowned, but she confessed that such drowning was\nvery pleasant. She almost felt that such drowning was good for her.\nAt any rate it had been ordered by Mr. Comfort, and if things went\nastray Mr. Comfort must bear the blame. When the bright muslin was\nlaid out on the counter before her, she looked at it with a pleased\neye and touched it with a willing hand. She held the ribbon against\nthe muslin, leaning her head on one side, and enjoyed herself. Now\nand again she would turn her face upon Rachel's figure, and she would\nalmost indulge a wish that this young man might like her child in the\nnew dress. Ah!--that was surely wicked. But if so, how wicked are\nmost mothers in this Christian land!\n\nThe morning had gone very comfortably with them during Dorothea's\nabsence. Mrs. Prime had hardly taken her departure before a note came\nfrom Mrs. Butler Cornbury, confirming Mr. Comfort's offer as to the\ncarriage. \"Oh, papa, what have you done?\"--she had said when her\nfather first told her. \"Now I must stay there all the night, for of\ncourse she'll want to go on to the last dance!\" But, like her father,\nshe was good-natured, and therefore, though she would hardly have\nchosen the task, she resolved, when her first groans were over, to\ndo it well. She wrote a kind note, saying how happy she should be,\nnaming her hour,--and saying that Rachel should name the hour for her\nreturn.\n\n\"It will be very nice,\" said Rachel, rejoicing more than she should\nhave done in thinking of the comfortable grandeur of Mrs. Butler\nCornbury's carriage.\n\n\"And are you determined?\" Mrs. Prime asked her mother that evening.\n\n\"It is too late to go back now, Dorothea,\" said Mrs. Ray, almost\ncrying.\n\n\"Then I cannot remain in the house,\" said Dorothea. \"I shall go to\nMiss Pucker's,--but not till that morning; so that if you think\nbetter of it, all may be prevented yet.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Ray would not think better of it, and it was thus that the\npreparations were made for Mrs. Tappitt's--ball. The word \"party\" had\nnow been dropped by common consent throughout Baslehurst.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF MRS. TAPPITT'S BALL--COMMENCED.\n\n\nMrs. Butler Cornbury was a very pretty woman. She possessed that\npeculiar prettiness which is so often seen in England, and which\nis rarely seen anywhere else. She was bright, well-featured, with\nspeaking lustrous eyes, with perfect complexion, and full bust, with\nhead of glorious shape and figure like a Juno;--and yet with all her\nbeauty she had ever about her an air of homeliness which made the\nsweetness of her womanhood almost more attractive than the loveliness\nof her personal charms. I have seen in Italy and in America women\nperhaps as beautiful as any that I have seen in England, but in\nneither country does it seem that such beauty is intended for\ndomestic use. In Italy the beauty is soft, and of the flesh. In\nAmerica it is hard, and of the mind. Here it is of the heart,\nI think, and as such is the happiest of the three. I do not say\nthat Mrs. Butler Cornbury was a woman of very strong feeling; but\nher strongest feelings were home feelings. She was going to Mrs.\nTappitt's party because it might serve her husband's purposes; she\nwas going to burden herself with Rachel Ray because her father had\nasked her; and her greatest ambition was to improve the worldly\nposition of the squires of Cornbury Grange. She was already\ncalculating whether it might not some day be brought about that her\nlittle Butler should sit in Parliament for his county.\n\nAt nine o'clock exactly on that much to be remembered Tuesday the\nCornbury carriage stopped at the gate of the cottage at Bragg's End,\nand Rachel, ready dressed, blushing, nervous, but yet happy, came\nout, and mounting on to the step was almost fearful to take her\nshare of the seat. \"Make yourself comfortable, my dear,\" said Mrs.\nCornbury, \"you can't crush me. Or rather I always make myself\ncrushable on such occasions as this. I suppose we are going to have a\ngreat crowd?\" Rachel merely said that she didn't know. She supposed\nthere would be a good many persons. Then she tried to thank Mrs.\nCornbury for being so good to her, and of course broke down. \"I'm\ndelighted,--quite delighted,\" said Mrs. Cornbury. \"It's so good of\nyou to come with me. Now that I don't dance myself, there's nothing I\nlike so much as taking out girls that do.\"\n\n\"And don't you dance at all?\"\n\n\"I stand up for a quadrille sometimes. When a woman has five children\nI don't think she ought to do more than that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall not do more than that, Mrs. Cornbury.\"\n\n\"You mean to say you won't waltz?\"\n\n\"Mamma never said anything about it, but I'm sure she would not like\nit. Besides--\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"I don't think I know how. I did learn once, when I was very little;\nbut I've forgotten.\"\n\n\"It will soon come again to you if you like to try. I was very fond\nof waltzing before I was married.\" And this was the daughter of Mr.\nComfort, the clergyman who preached with such strenuous eloquence\nagainst worldly vanities! Even Rachel was a little puzzled, and was\nalmost afraid that her head was sinking beneath the waters.\n\nThere was a great fuss made when Mrs. Butler Cornbury's carriage\ndrove up to the brewery door, and Rachel almost felt that she could\nhave made her way up to the drawing-room more comfortably under Mrs.\nRule's mild protection. All the servants seemed to rush at her, and\nwhen she found herself in the hall and was conducted into some inner\nroom, she was not allowed to shake herself into shape without the aid\nof a maid-servant. Mrs. Cornbury,--who took everything as a matter of\ncourse and was ready in a minute,--had turned the maid over to the\nyoung lady with a kind idea that the young lady's toilet was more\nimportant than that of the married woman. Rachel was losing her head\nand knew that she was doing so. When she was again taken into the\nhall she hardly remembered where she was, and when Mrs. Cornbury\ntook her by the arm and began to walk up-stairs with her, her\nstrongest feeling was a wish that she was at home again. On the first\nlanding,--for the dancing-room was upstairs,--they encountered Mr.\nTappitt, conspicuous in a blue satin waistcoat; and on the second\nlanding they found Mrs. Tappitt, magnificent in a green Irish poplin.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Cornbury, we are so delighted. The Miss Fawcetts are\nhere; they are just come. How kind of you to bring Rachel Ray. How\ndo you do, Rachel?\" Then Mrs. Cornbury moved easily on into the\ndrawing-room, and Rachel still found herself carried with her.\nShe was half afraid that she ought to have slunk away from her\nmagnificent chaperon as soon as she was conveyed safely within the\nhouse, and that she was encroaching as she thus went on; but still\nshe could not find the moment in which to take herself off. In the\ndrawing-room,--the room from which the carpets had been taken,--they\nwere at once encountered by the Tappitt girls, with whom the Fawcett\ngirls on the present occasion were so intermingled that Rachel hardly\nknew who was who. Mrs. Butler Cornbury was soon surrounded, and a\nclatter of words went on. Rachel was in the middle of the fray, and\nsome voices were addressed also to her; but her presence of mind was\ngone, and she never could remember what she said on the occasion.\n\nThere had already been a dance,--the commencing operation of the\nnight's work,--a thin quadrille, in which the early comers had taken\npart without much animation, and to which they had been driven up\nunwillingly. At its close the Fawcett girls had come in, as had now\nMrs. Cornbury, so that it may be said that the evening was beginning\nagain. What had been as yet done was but the tuning of the fiddles\nbefore the commencement of the opera. No one likes to be in at\nthe tuning, but there are those who never are able to avoid this\nannoyance. As it was, Rachel, under Mrs. Cornbury's care, had been\nbrought upon the scene just at the right moment. As soon as the great\nclatter had ceased, she found herself taken by the hand by Cherry,\nand led a little on one side. \"You must have a card, you know,\" said\nCherry handing her a ticket on which was printed the dances as they\nwere to succeed each other. \"That first one is over. Such a dull\nthing. I danced with Adolphus Griggs, just because I couldn't escape\nhim for one quadrille.\" Rachel took the card, but never having seen\nsuch a thing before did not in the least understand its object. \"As\nyou get engaged for the dances you must put down their names in this\nway, you see,\"--and Cherry showed her card, which already bore the\ndesignations of several cavaliers, scrawled in hieroglyphics which\nwere intelligible to herself. \"Haven't you got a pencil? Well, you\ncan come to me. I have one hanging here, you know.\" Rachel was\nbeginning to understand, and to think that she should not have\nvery much need for the pencil, when Mrs. Cornbury returned to her,\nbringing a young man in her wake. \"I want to introduce my cousin to\nyou, Walter Cornbury,\" said she. Mrs. Cornbury was a woman who knew\nher duty as a chaperon, and who would not neglect it. \"He waltzes\ndelightfully,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, whispering, \"and you needn't be\nafraid of being a little astray with him at first. He always does\nwhat I tell him.\" Then the introduction was made; but Rachel had\nno opportunity of repeating her fears, or of saying again that she\nthought she had better not waltz. What to say to Mr. Walter Cornbury\nshe hardly knew; but before she had really said anything he had\npricked her down for two dances,--for the first waltz, which was just\ngoing to begin, and some not long future quadrille. \"She is very\npretty,\" Mrs. Butler Cornbury had said to her cousin, \"and I want to\nbe kind to her.\" \"I'll take her in hand and pull her through,\" said\nWalter. \"What a tribe of people they've got here, haven't they?\"\n\"Yes, and you must dance with them all. Every time you stand up may\nbe as good as a vote.\" \"Oh,\" said Walter, \"I'm not particular;--I'll\ndance as long as they keep the house open.\" Then he went back to\nRachel, who had already been at work with Cherry's pencil.\n\n\"If there isn't Rachel Ray going to waltz with Walter Cornbury,\" said\nAugusta to her mother. Augusta had just refused the odious Griggs,\nand was about to stand up with a clerk in the brewery, who was almost\nas odious.\n\n\"It's because she came in the carriage,\" said Mrs. Tappitt; \"but I\ndon't think she can waltz.\" Then she hurried off to welcome other\ncomers.\n\nRachel had hardly been left alone for a minute, and had been so much\nbewildered by the lights and crowd and strangeness of everything\naround her, that she had been unable to turn her thoughts to the one\nsubject on which during the last week her mind had rested constantly.\nShe had not even looked round the room for Luke Rowan. She had just\nseen Mary Rowan in the crowd, but had not spoken to her. She had only\nknown her from the manner in which Cherry Tappitt had spoken to her,\nand it must be explained that Rachel had not seen young Rowan since\nthat parting under the elm-trees. Indeed, since then she had seen\nnone of the Tappitt family. Her mother had said no word to her,\ncautioning her that she had better not seek them in her evening\nwalks; but she had felt herself debarred from going into Baslehurst\nby all that her sister had said, and in avoiding Luke Rowan she had\navoided the whole party from the brewery.\n\nNow the room was partially cleared, the non-dancers being pressed\nback into a border round the walls, and the music began. Rachel, with\nher heart in her mouth, was claimed by her partner, and was carried\nforward towards the ground for dancing, tacitly assenting to her fate\nbecause she lacked words in which to explain to Mr. Cornbury how very\nmuch she would have preferred to be left in obscurity behind the wall\nof crinoline.\n\n\"Pray wait a minute or two,\" said she, almost panting.\n\n\"Oh, certainly. There's no hurry, only we'll stand where we can get\nour place when we like it. You need not be a bit afraid of going on\nwith me. Patty has told me all about it, and we'll make it right in a\nbrace of turns.\" There was something very good-natured in his voice,\nand she almost felt that she could ask him to let her sit down.\n\n\"I don't think I can,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh yes; come, we'll try!\" Then he took her by the waist, and away\nthey went. Twice round the room he took her, very gently, as he\nthought; but her head had gone from her instantly in a whirl of\namazement! Of her feet and their movements she had known nothing;\nthough she had followed the music with fair accuracy, she had done so\nunconsciously, and when he allowed her to stop she did not know which\nway she had been going, or at which end of the room she stood. And\nyet she had liked it, and felt some little triumph as a conviction\ncame upon her that she had not conspicuously disgraced herself.\n\n\"That's charming,\" said he. She essayed to speak a word in answer,\nbut her want of breath did not as yet permit it.\n\n\"Charming!\" he went on. \"The music's perhaps a little slow, but we'll\nhurry them up presently.\" Slow! It seemed to her that she had been\ncarried round in a vortex, of which the rapidity, though pleasant,\nhad been almost frightful. \"Come; we'll have another start,\" said he;\nand she was carried away again before she had spoken a word. \"I'd no\nidea that girl could waltz,\" said Mrs. Tappitt to old Mrs. Rule. \"I\ndon't think her mother would like it if she saw it,\" said Mrs. Rule.\n\"And what would Mrs. Prime say?\" said Mrs. Tappitt. However the ice\nwas broken, and Rachel, when she was given to understand that that\ndance was done, felt herself to be aware that the world of waltzing\nwas open to her, at any rate for that night. Was it very wicked?\nShe had her doubts. If anybody had suggested to her, before Mrs.\nCornbury's carriage had called for her, that she would waltz on that\nevening, she would have repudiated the idea almost with horror. How\neasy is the path down the shores of the Avernus! but then,--was she\ngoing down the shores of the Avernus?\n\nShe was still walking through the crowd, leaning on her partner's\narm, and answering his good-natured questions almost in\nmonosyllables, when she was gently touched on the arm by a fan, and\non turning found herself confronted by Luke Rowan and his sister.\n\"I've been trying to get at you so long,\" said he, making some sort\nof half apology to Cornbury, \"and haven't been able; though once I\nvery nearly danced you down without your knowing it.\"\n\n\"We're so much obliged to you for letting us escape,\" said Cornbury;\n\"are we not, Miss Ray?\"\n\n\"We carried heavy metal, I can tell you,\" said Rowan. \"But I must\nintroduce you to my sister. Where on earth have you been for these\nten days?\" Then the introduction was made, and young Cornbury,\nfinding that his partner was in the hands of another lady, slipped\naway.\n\n\"I have heard a great deal about you, Miss Ray,\" said Mary Rowan.\n\n\"Have you? I don't know who should say much about me.\" The words\nsounded uncivil, but she did not know what words to choose.\n\n\"Oh, from Cherry especially;--and--and from my brother.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to make your acquaintance,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"He told me that you would have been sure to come and walk with us,\nand we have all been saying that you had disappeared.\"\n\n\"I have been kept at home,\" said Rachel, who could not help\nremembering all the words of the churchyard interview, and feeling\nthem down to her finger nails. He must have known why she had not\nagain joined the girls from the brewery in their walks. Or had he\nforgotten that he had called her Rachel, and held her fast by the\nhand? Perhaps he did these things so often to other girls that he\nthought nothing of them!\n\n\"You have been keeping yourself up for the ball,\" said Rowan.\n\"Precious people are right to make themselves scarce. And now what\nvacancies have you got for me?\"\n\n\"Vacancies!\" said Rachel.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you've got none. Look here, I've kept all\nthese on purpose for you, although twenty girls have begged me to\ndispose of them in their favour.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, how can you tell such fibs?\" said his sister.\n\n\"Well;--here they are,\" and he showed his card.\n\n\"I'm not engaged to anybody,\" said Rachel; \"except for one quadrille\nto Mr. Cornbury,--that gentleman who just went away.\"\n\n\"Then you've no excuse for not filling up my vacancies,--kept on\npurpose for you, mind.\" And immediately her name was put down for she\nknew not what dances. Then he took her card and scrawled his own name\non it in various places. She knew that she was weak to let him thus\nhave his way in everything; but he was strong and she could not\nhinder him.\n\nShe was soon left with Mary Rowan, as Luke went off to fulfil the\nfirst of his numerous engagements. \"Do you like my brother?\" said\nshe. \"But of course I don't mean you to answer that question. We all\nthink him so very clever.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is very clever.\"\n\n\"A great deal too clever to be a brewer. But you mustn't say that I\nsaid so. I wanted him to go into the army.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't at all like that for my brother--if I had one.\"\n\n\"And what would you like?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. I never had a brother;--perhaps to be a\nclergyman.\"\n\n\"Yes; that would be very nice; but Luke would never be a clergyman.\nHe was going to be an attorney, but he didn't like that at all. He\nsays there's a great deal of poetry in brewing beer, but of course\nhe's only quizzing us. Oh, here's my partner. I do so hope I shall\nsee you very often while I'm at Baslehurst.\" Then Rachel was alone,\nbut Mrs. Tappitt came up to her in a minute. \"My dear,\" said she,\n\"Mr. Griggs desires the honour of your hand for a quadrille.\" And\nthus Rachel found herself standing up with the odious Mr. Griggs.\n\"I do so pity you,\" said Cherry, coming behind her for a moment.\n\"Remember, you need not do it more than once. I don't mean to do it\nagain.\"\n\nAfter that she was allowed to sit still while a polka was being\nperformed. Mrs. Cornbury came to her saying a word or two; but she\ndid not stay with her long, so that Rachel could think about Luke\nRowan, and try to make up her mind as to what words she should say\nto him. She furtively looked down upon her card and found that he\nhad written his own name to five dances, ending with Sir Roger de\nCoverley at the close of the evening. It was quite impossible that\nshe should dance five dances with him, so she thought that she would\nmark out two with her nail. The very next was one of them, and during\nthat she would explain to him what she had done. The whole thing\nloomed large in her thoughts and made her feel anxious. She would\nhave been unhappy if he had not come to her at all, and now she was\nunhappy because he had thrust himself upon her so violently,--or if\nnot unhappy, she was at any rate uneasy. And what should she say\nabout the elm-trees? Nothing, unless he spoke to her about them. She\nfancied that he would say something about the arm in the cloud, and\nif so, she must endeavour to make him understand that--that--that--.\nShe did not know how to fix her thoughts. Would it be possible to\nmake him understand that he ought not to have called her Rachel?\n\nWhile she was thinking of all this Mr. Tappitt came and sat beside\nher. \"Very pretty; isn't it?\" said he. \"Very pretty indeed, I call\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, very pretty. I had no idea it would be so nice.\" To Mr.\nTappitt in his blue waistcoat she could speak without hesitation. Ah\nme! It is the young men who receive all the reverence that the world\nhas to pay;--all the reverence that is worth receiving. When a man is\nturned forty and has become fat, anybody can speak to him without\nawe!\n\n\"Yes, it is nice,\" said Mr. Tappitt, who, however, was not quite\neasy in his mind. He had been into the supper room, and had found\nthe waiter handling long-necked bottles, arranging them in rows,\napparently by the dozen. \"What's that?\" said he, sharply. \"The\nchampagne, sir! there should have been ice, sir, but I suppose they\nforgot it.\" Where had Mrs. T. procured all that wine? It was very\nplain to him that she had got the better of him by some deceit. He\nwould smile, and smile, and smile during the evening; but he would\nhave it out with Mrs. Tappitt before he would allow that lady to have\nany rest. He lingered in the room, pretending that he was overlooking\nthe arrangements, but in truth he was counting the bottles. After\nall there was but a dozen. He knew that at Griggs's they sold it for\nsixty shillings. \"Three pounds!\" he said to himself. \"Three pounds\nmore; dear, dear!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is nice!\" he said to Rachel. \"Mind you get a glass of\nchampagne when you go in to supper. By-the-by, shall I get a partner\nfor you? Here, Buckett, come and dance the next dance with Miss Ray.\"\nBuckett was the clerk in the brewery. Rachel had nothing to say for\nherself; so Buckett's name was put down on the card, though she would\nrather not have danced with Buckett. A week or two ago, before she\nhad been taken up into Mrs. Cornbury's carriage, or had waltzed with\nMrs. Cornbury's cousin, or had looked at the setting sun with Luke\nRowan, she would have been sufficiently contented to dance with Mr.\nBuckett,--if in those days she had ever dreamed of dancing with any\none. Then Mrs. Cornbury came to her again, bringing other cavaliers,\nand Rachel's card began to be filled. \"The quadrille before supper\nyou dance with me,\" said Walter Cornbury. \"That's settled, you know.\"\nOh, what a new world it was, and so different from the Dorcas\nmeetings at Miss Pucker's rooms!\n\nThen came the moment of the evening which, of all the moments, was\nthe most trying to her. Luke Rowan came to claim her hand for the\nnext quadrille. She had already spoken to him,--or rather he to her;\nbut that had been in the presence of a third person, when, of course,\nnothing could be said about the sunset and the clouds,--nothing about\nthat promise of friendship. But now she would have to stand again\nwith him in solitude,--a solitude of another kind,--in a solitude\nwhich was authorized, during which he might whisper what words he\npleased to her, and from which she could not even run away. It had\nbeen thought to be a great sin on her part to have remained a moment\nwith him by the stile; but now she was to stand up with him beneath\nthe glare of the lights, dressed in her best, on purpose that he\nmight whisper to her what words he pleased. But she was sure--she\nthought that she was sure, that he would utter no words so sweet, so\nfull of meaning, as those in which he bade her watch the arm in the\nclouds.\n\nTill the first figure was over for them he hardly spoke to her. \"Tell\nme,\" said he then, \"why has nobody seen you since Saturday week\nlast?\"\n\n\"I have been at home.\"\n\n\"Ah; but tell me the truth. Remember what we said as we\nparted,--about being friends. One tells one's friend the real truth.\nBut I suppose you do not remember what we said?\"\n\n\"I don't think I said anything, Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"Did you not? Then I must have been dreaming. I thought you promised\nme your friendship.\" He paused for her answer, but she said nothing.\nShe could not declare to him that she would not be his friend. \"But\nyou have not told me yet why it was that you remained at home.\nCome;--answer me a fair question fairly. Had I offended you?\" Again\nshe paused and made him no reply. It seemed to her that the room was\ngoing round her, and that the music made her dizzy. If she told him\nthat he had not offended her would she not thereby justify him in\nhaving called her Rachel?\n\n\"Then I did offend you?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan,--never mind now; you must go on with the figure,\" and\nthus for a moment she was saved from her difficulty. When he had done\nhis work of dancing, she began hers, and as she placed both her hands\nin his to make the final turn, she flattered herself that he would\nnot go back to the subject.\n\nNor did he while the quadrille lasted. As they continued to dance\nhe said very little to her, and before the last figure was over she\nhad almost settled down to enjoyment. He merely spoke a word or two\nabout Mrs. Cornbury's dress, and another word about the singular\narrangement of Mr. Griggs' jewellery, at which word she almost\nlaughed outright, and then a third word laudatory of the Tappitt\ngirls. \"As for Cherry,\" said he \"I'm quite in love with her for her\npure good-nature and hearty manners; and of all living female human\nbeings Martha is the most honest and just.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'll tell her that,\" said Rachel. \"She will so like it.\"\n\n\"No, you mustn't. You mustn't repeat any of the things I tell you in\nconfidence.\" That word confidence again silenced her, and nothing\nmore was said till he had offered her his arm at the end of the\ndance.\n\n\"Come away and have some negus on the stairs,\" he said. \"The reason\nI like these sort of parties is, that one is allowed to go into such\nqueer places. You see that little room with the door open. That's\nwhere Mr. Tappitt keeps his old boots and the whip with which he\ndrives his grey horse. There are four men playing cards there now,\nand one is seated on the end of an upturned portmanteau.\"\n\n\"And where are the old boots?\"\n\n\"Packed away on the top of Mrs. Tappitt's bed. I helped to put them\nthere. Some are stuck under the grate because there are no fires now.\nLook here; there's a seat in the window.\" Then he placed her in the\ninclosure of an old window on the staircase landing, and brought her\nlemonade, and when she had drunk it he sat down beside her.\n\n\"Hadn't we better go back to the dancing?\"\n\n\"They won't begin for a few minutes. They're only tuning up again.\nYou should always escape from the hot air for a moment or two.\nBesides, you must answer me that question. Did I offend you?\"\n\n\"Please don't talk of it. Please don't. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it is not all over. I knew you were angry with me\nbecause,--shall I say why?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Rowan, don't say anything about it.\"\n\n\"At any rate, I may think that you have forgiven me. But what if I\noffend in the same way again? What if I ask permission to do it,\nso that it may be no offence? Only think; if I am to live here in\nBaslehurst all my life, is it not reasonable that I should wish you\nto be my friend? Are you going to separate yourself from Cherry\nTappitt because you are afraid of me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"But is not that what you have done during the last week, Miss\nRay;--if it must be Miss Ray?\" Then he paused, but still she said\nnothing. \"Rachel is such a pretty name.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think it so ugly.\"\n\n\"It's the prettiest name in the Bible, and the name most fit for\npoetic use. Who does not remember Rachel weeping for her children?\"\n\n\"That's the idea, and not the name. Ruth is twice prettier, and Mary\nthe sweetest of all.\"\n\n\"I never knew anybody before called Rachel,\" said he.\n\n\"And I never knew anybody called Luke.\"\n\n\"That's a coincidence, is it not?--a coincidence that ought to make\nus friends. I may call you Rachel then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; please don't. What would people think?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they would think the truth,\" said he. \"Perhaps they would\nimagine that I called you so because I liked you. But perhaps they\nmight think also that you let me do so because you liked me. People\ndo make such mistakes.\"\n\nAt this moment up came to them, with flushed face, Mr. Buckett.\n\"I have been looking for you everywhere,\" said he to Rachel. \"It's\nnearly over now.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" said Rachel, \"but I quite forgot.\"\n\n\"So I presume,\" said Mr. Buckett angrily, but at the same time he\ngave his arm to Rachel and led her away. The fag end of some waltz\nremained, and he might get a turn with her. People in his hearing had\nspoken of her as the belle of the room, and he did not like to lose\nhis chance. \"Oh, Mr. Rowan,\" said Rachel, looking back as she was\nbeing led away. \"I must speak one word to Mr. Rowan.\" Then she\nseparated herself, and returning a step or two almost whispered to\nher late partner--\"You have put me down for ever so many dances. You\nmust scratch out two or three of them.\"\n\n\"Not one,\" said he. \"An engagement is an engagement.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I really can't.\"\n\n\"Of course I cannot make you, but I will scratch out nothing,--and\nforget nothing.\"\n\nThen she rejoined Mr. Buckett, and was told by him that young Rowan\nwas not liked in the brewery at all. \"We think him conceited, you\nknow. He pretends to know more than anybody else.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF MRS. TAPPITT'S BALL--CONCLUDED.\n\n\nIt came to be voted by public acclamation that Rachel Ray was the\nbelle of the evening. I think this was brought about quite as much\nby Mrs. Butler Cornbury's powerful influence as by Rachel's beauty.\nMrs. Butler Cornbury having begun the work of chaperon carried it\non heartily, and talked her young friend up to the top of the tree.\nLong before supper her card was quite full, but filled in a manner\nthat was not comfortable to herself,--for she knew that she had made\nmistakes. As to those spaces on which the letter R was written, she\nkept them very sacred. She was quite resolved that she would not\nstand up with him on all those occasions,--that she would omit at\nany rate two; but she would accept no one else for those two dances,\nnot choosing to select any special period for throwing him over. She\nendeavoured to explain this when she waltzed with him, shortly before\nsupper; but her explanation did not come easy, and she wanted all\nher attention for the immediate work she had in hand. \"If you'd only\ngive yourself to it a little more eagerly,\" he said, \"you'd waltz\nbeautifully.\"\n\n\"I shall never do it well,\" she answered. \"I don't suppose I shall\never try again.\"\n\n\"But you like it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; I like it excessively. But one can't do everything that one\nlikes.\"\n\n\"No; I can't. You won't let me do what I like.\"\n\n\"Don't talk in that way, Mr. Rowan. If you do you'll destroy all my\npleasure. You should let me enjoy it while it lasts.\" In this way she\nwas becoming intimate with him.\n\n\"How very nicely your house does for a dance,\" said Mrs. Cornbury to\nMrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Oh dear,--I don't think so. Our rooms are so small. But it's very\nkind of you to say so. Indeed, I never can be sufficiently obliged--\"\n\n\"By-the-by,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, \"what a nice girl Rachel Ray has\ngrown.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"And dances so well! I'd no idea of it. The young men seem rather\ntaken with her. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"I declare I think they are. I always fancy that is rather a\nmisfortune to a young girl,--particularly when it must mean nothing,\nas of course it can't with poor Rachel.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all.\"\n\n\"Her mother, you know, Mrs. Cornbury;--they are not in the way of\nseeing any company. It was so kind of you to bring her here, and\nreally she does look very nice. My girls are very good-natured to\nher. I only hope her head won't be turned. Here's Mr. Tappitt. You\nmust go down Mrs. Cornbury, and eat a little bit of supper.\" Then Mr.\nTappitt in his blue waistcoat led Mrs. Cornbury away.\n\n\"I am a very bad hand at supper,\" said the lady.\n\n\"You must take just one glass of champagne,\" said the gentleman. Now\nthat the wine was there, Mr. Tappitt appreciated the importance of\nthe occasion.\n\nFor the last dance before supper,--or that which was intended to be\nthe last,--Rachel had by long agreement been the partner of Walter\nCornbury. But now that it was over, the majority of the performers\ncould not go into the supper-room because of the crowd. Young\nCornbury therefore proposed that they should loiter about till their\ntime came. He was very well inclined for such loitering with Rachel.\n\n\"You're flirting with that girl, Master Walter,\" said Mrs. Cornbury.\n\n\"I suppose that's what she came for,\" said the cousin.\n\n\"By no means, and she's under my care; therefore I beg you'll talk no\nnonsense to her.\"\n\nWalter Cornbury probably did talk a little nonsense to her, but it\nwas very innocent nonsense. Most of such flirtations if they were\ndone out loud would be very innocent. Young men are not nearly so\npointed in their compliments as their elders, and generally confine\nthemselves to remarks of which neither mothers nor grandmothers\ncould disapprove if they heard them. The romance lies rather in\nthe thoughts than in the words of those concerned. Walter Cornbury\nbelieved that he was flirting and felt himself to be happy, but he\nhad uttered nothing warmer to Rachel than a hope that he might meet\nher at the next Torquay ball.\n\n\"I never go to public balls,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"But why not, Miss Ray?\" said Walter.\n\n\"I never went to a dance of any description before this.\"\n\n\"But now that you've begun of course you'll go on.\" Mr. Cornbury's\nflirtation never reached a higher pitch than that.\n\nWhen he had got as far as that Luke Rowan played him a trick,--an\ninhospitable trick, seeing that he, Rowan, was in some sort at home,\nand that the people about him were bound to obey him. He desired\nthe musicians to strike up again while the elders were eating their\nsupper,--and then claimed Rachel's hand, so that he might have the\npleasure of serving her with cold chicken and champagne.\n\n\"Miss Ray is going into supper with me,\" said Cornbury.\n\n\"But supper is not ready,\" said Rowan, \"and Miss Ray is engaged to\ndance with me.\"\n\n\"Quite a mistake on your part,\" said Cornbury.\n\n\"No mistake at all,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"Indeed it is. Come, Miss Ray, we'll take a turn down into the hall,\nand see if places are ready for us.\" Cornbury rather despised Rowan,\nas being a brewer and mechanical; and probably he showed that he did\nso.\n\n\"Places are not ready, so you need not trouble Miss Ray to go down as\nyet. But a couple is wanted for a quadrille, and therefore I'm sure\nshe'll stand up.\"\n\n\"Come along, Rachel,\" said Cherry. \"We just want you. This will be\nthe nicest of all, because we shall have room.\"\n\nRachel had become unhappy seeing that the two men were in earnest.\nHad not Cherry spoken she would have remained with Mr. Cornbury,\nthinking that to be her safer conduct; but Cherry's voice had\noverpowered her, and she gave her arm to young Rowan, moving away\nwith slow, hesitating step.\n\n\"Of course Miss Ray will do as she pleases,\" said Cornbury.\n\n\"Of course she will,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" said Rachel, \"but I was engaged, and it seems I am\nreally wanted.\" Walter Cornbury bowed very stiffly, and there was an\nend of his flirtation. \"That's the sort of thing that always happens\nwhen a fellow comes among this sort of people!\" It was thus he\nconsoled himself as he went down solitary to his supper.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Rowan; \"now we've Cherry for our vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis,\nand after that we'll go down to supper comfortably.\"\n\n\"But I said I'd go with him.\"\n\n\"You can't now, for he has gone without you. What a brick Cherry is!\nDo you know what she said of you?\"\n\n\"No; do tell me.\"\n\n\"I won't. It will make you vain.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no; but I want Cherry to like me, because I am so fond of\nher.\"\n\n\"She says you're by far-- But I won't tell you. I hate compliments,\nand that would look like one. Come, who's forgetting the figure\nnow? I shouldn't wonder if young Cornbury went into the brewery and\ndrowned himself in one of the vats.\"\n\nIt was very nice,--very nice indeed. This was her third dance with\nLuke Rowan, and she was beginning to think that the other two might\nperhaps come off without any marked impropriety on her part. She was\na little unhappy about Mr. Cornbury,--on his cousin's account rather\nthan on his own. Mrs. Cornbury had been so kind to her that she\nought to have remained with Walter when he desired it. So she told\nherself;--but yet she liked being taken down to supper by Luke\nRowan. She had one other cause of uneasiness. She constantly caught\nMrs. Tappitt's eye fixed upon herself, and whenever she did so\nMrs. Tappitt's eye seemed to look unkindly at her. She had also an\ninstinctive feeling that Augusta did not regard her with favour, and\nthat this disfavour arose from Mr. Rowan's attentions. It was all\nvery nice; but still she felt that there was danger around her, and\nsometimes she would pause a moment in her happiness, and almost\ntremble as she thought of things. She was dividing herself poles\nasunder from Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"And now we'll go to supper,\" said Rowan. \"Come, Cherry; do you\nand Boyd go on first.\" Boyd was a friend of Rowan's. \"Do you know,\nI've done such a clever trick. This is my second descent among the\neatables. As I belong in a manner to the house I took down Miss\nHarford, and hovered about her for five minutes. Then I managed\nto lose myself in the crowd, and coming up here got the music up.\nThe fellows were just going off. We've plenty of time now, because\nthey're in the kitchen eating and drinking. I contrived all that\ndodge that I might give you this glass of wine with my own hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan, it was very wrong!\"\n\n\"And that's my reward! I don't care about its being wrong as long as\nit's pleasant.\"\n\n\"What shocking morality!\"\n\n\"All is fair in-- Well, never mind, you'll own it is pleasant.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; it's very pleasant.\"\n\n\"Then I'm contented, and will leave the moral of it for Mr. Cornbury.\nI'll tell you something further if you'll let me.\"\n\n\"Pray don't tell me anything that you ought not.\"\n\n\"I've done all I could to get up this party on purpose that we might\nhave you here.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"But I have. I have cared about it just because it would enable me to\nsay one word to you;--and now I'm afraid to say it.\"\n\nShe was sitting there close to him, and she couldn't go away. She\ncouldn't run as she had done from the stile. She couldn't show\nany feeling of offence before all those who were around her; and\nyet,--was it not her duty to do something to stop him? \"Pray don't\nsay such things,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I tell you that I'm afraid to say it. Here; give me some wine.\nYou'll take some more. No? Well; shall we go? I am afraid to say it.\"\nThey were now out in the hall, standing idly there, with their backs\nto another door. \"I wonder what answer you would make me!\"\n\n\"We had better go up-stairs. Indeed we had.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Miss Ray. Why is it that you are so unwilling even to\nstay a moment with me?\"\n\n\"I'm not unwilling. Only we had better go now.\"\n\n\"Do you remember when I held your arm at the stile?\"\n\n\"No; I don't remember anything about it. You ought not to have\ndone it. Do you know, I think you are very cruel.\" As she made the\naccusation, she looked down upon the floor, and spoke in a low,\ntrembling voice that almost convinced him that she was in earnest.\n\n\"Cruel!\" said he. \"That's hard too.\"\n\n\"Or you wouldn't prevent me enjoying myself while I am here, by\nsaying things which you ought to know I don't like.\"\n\n\"I have hardly thought whether you would like what I say or not; but\nI know this; I would give anything in the world to make myself sure\nthat you would ever look back upon this evening as a happy one.\"\n\n\"I will if you'll come up-stairs, and--\"\n\n\"And what?\"\n\n\"And go on without,--without seeming to mind me so much.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I do mind you. Rachel--no; you shall not go for a minute.\nListen to me for one moment.\" Then he tried to stand before her, but\nshe was off from him, and ran up-stairs by herself. What was it that\nhe wished to say to her? She knew that she would have liked to have\nheard it;--nay, that she was longing to hear it. But she was startled\nand afraid of him, and as she gently crept in at the door of the\ndancing-room, she determined that she would tell Mrs. Cornbury that\nshe was quite ready for the carriage. It was impossible that she\nshould go through those other two dances with Luke Rowan; and as for\nher other engagements, they must be allowed to shift for themselves.\nOne had been made early in the evening with Mr. Griggs. It would be a\ngreat thing to escape dancing with Mr. Griggs. She would ask Cherry\nto make her apologies to everybody. As she entered the room she felt\nashamed of herself, and unable to take any place. She was oppressed\nby an idea that she ought not to be walking about without some\ngentleman with her, and that people would observe her. She was still\nvery near the door when she perceived that Mr. Rowan was also coming\nin. She determined to avoid him if she could, feeling sure that\nshe could not stop him in anything that he might say, while so\nmany people would be close around them. And yet she felt almost\ndisappointment when she heard his voice as he talked merrily with\nsome one at the door. At that moment Mrs. Cornbury came up to her,\nwalking across the room on purpose to join her.\n\n\"What, all alone! I thought your hand was promised for every dance up\nto five o'clock.\"\n\n\"I believe I'm engaged to some one now, but I declare I don't know\nwho it is. I dare say he has forgotten.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; people do get confused a little just about this time. Will\nyou come and sit down?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I should like that. But, Mrs. Cornbury, when you're ready\nto go away, I am,--quite ready.\"\n\n\"Go away! Why I thought you intended to dance at least for the next\ntwo hours.\"\n\nIn answer to this, Rachel declared that she was tired. \"And, Mrs.\nCornbury, I want to avoid that man,\" and she pointed out Mr. Griggs\nby a glance of her eye. \"I think he'll say I'm engaged to him for the\nnext waltz, and--I don't like him.\"\n\n\"Poor man; he doesn't look very nice, certainly; but if that's all\nI'll get you out of the scrape without running away.\" Then Mr. Griggs\ncame up, and, with a very low bow, struck out the point of his elbow\ntowards Rachel, expecting her immediately to put her hand within it.\n\n\"I'm afraid, sir, you must excuse Miss Ray just at present. She's too\ntired to dance immediately.\"\n\nMr. Griggs looked at his card, then looked at Rachel, then looked\nat Mrs. Cornbury, and stood twiddling the bunch of little gilt\nplaythings that hung from his chain. \"That is too hard,\" said he;\n\"deuced hard.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"So shall I be,--uncommon. Really, Mrs. Cornbury, I think a turn or\ntwo would do her good. Don't you?\"\n\n\"I can't say I do. She says she would rather not, and of course you\nwon't press her.\"\n\n\"I don't see it in that light,--I really don't. A gentleman has his\nrights you know, Mrs. Cornbury. Miss Ray won't deny--\"\n\n\"Miss Ray will deny that she intends to stand up for this dance. And\none of the rights of a gentleman is to take a lady at her word.\"\n\n\"Really, Mrs. Cornbury, you are down upon one so hard.\"\n\n\"Rachel,\" said she, \"would you mind coming across the room with me?\nThere are seats on the sofa on the other side.\" Then Mrs. Cornbury\nsailed across the floor, and Rachel crept after her more dismayed\nthan ever. Mr. Griggs the while stood transfixed to his place,\nstroking his mustaches with his hand, and showing plainly by his\ncountenance that he didn't know what he ought to do next. \"Well,\nthat's cool,\" said he; \"confounded cool!\"\n\n\"Anything wrong, Griggs, my boy?\" said a bank clerk, slapping him on\nthe back.\n\n\"I call it very wrong; very wrong, indeed,\" said Griggs; \"but people\ndo give themselves such airs! Miss Cherry, may I have the honour of\nwaltzing with you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Cherry, who was passing by. Then Mr. Griggs\nmade his way back to the door.\n\nRachel felt that things were going wrong with her. It had so happened\nthat she had parted on bad terms with three gentlemen. She had\noffended Mr. Cornbury and Mr. Griggs, and had done her best to make\nMr. Rowan understand that he had offended her! She conceived that\nall the room would know of it, and that Mrs. Cornbury would become\nashamed of her. That Mrs. Tappitt was already very angry with her she\nwas quite sure. She wished she had not come to the ball, and began\nto think that perhaps her sister might be right. It almost seemed to\nherself that she had not known how to behave herself. For a short\ntime she had been happy,--very happy; but she feared that she had\nin some way committed herself during the moments of her happiness.\n\"I hope you are not angry with me,\" she said, \"about Mr. Griggs?\"\nappealing to her friend in a plaintive voice.\n\n\"Angry!--oh dear, no. Why should I be angry with you? I should be\nangry with that man, only I'm a person that never gets angry with\nanybody. You were quite right not to dance with him. Never be made\nto dance with any man you don't like; and remember that a young lady\nshould always have her own way in a ball-room. She doesn't get much\nof it anywhere else; does she, my dear? And now I'll go whenever you\nlike it, but I'm not the least in a hurry. You're the young lady, and\nyou're to have your own way. If you're quite in earnest, I'll get\nsome one to order the carriage.\"--Rachel said that she was quite\nin earnest, and then Walter was called. \"So you're going, are you?\"\nsaid he. \"Miss Ray has ill-treated me so dreadfully that I can't\nexpress my regret.\" \"Ill-treated you, too, has she? Upon my word,\nmy dear, you've shown yourself quite great upon the occasion. When\nI was a girl, there was nothing I liked so much as offending all my\npartners.\" But Rachel was red with dismay, and wretched that such an\naccusation should be made against her. \"Oh, Mrs. Cornbury, I didn't\nmean to offend him! I'll explain it all in the carriage. What will\nyou think of me?\" \"Think, my dear?--why, I shall think that you are\ngoing to turn all the young men's heads in Baslehurst. But I shall\nhear all about it from Walter to-morrow. He tells me of all his loves\nand all his disappointments.\"\n\nWhile the carriage was being brought round, Rachel kept close to\nher chaperon; but every now and again her eyes, in spite of herself,\nwould wander away to Mr. Rowan. Was he in any way affected by her\nleaving him, or was it all a joke to him? He was dancing now with\nCherry Tappitt, and Rachel was sure that all of it was a joke.\nBut it was a cruel joke,--cruel because it exposed her to so much\nill-natured remark. With him she would quarrel,--quarrel really.\nShe would let him know that he should not call her by her Christian\nname just when it suited him to do so, and then take himself off\nto play with others in the same way. She would tell Cherry, and\nmake Cherry understand that all walks and visiting and friendly\nintercommunications must be abandoned because this young man would\ntake advantage of her position to annoy her! He should be made to\nunderstand that she was not in his power! Then, as she thought of\nthis, she caught his eye as he made a sudden stop in the dance close\nto her, and all her hard thoughts died away. Ah, dear, what was it\nthat she wanted of him?\n\nAt that moment they got up to go away. Such a person as Mrs. Butler\nCornbury could not, of course, escape without a parade of adieux. Mr.\nTappitt was searched up from the little room in which the card-party\nheld their meeting in order that he might hand the guest that had\nhonoured him down to her carriage; and Mrs. Tappitt fluttered about,\nprofuse in her acknowledgments for the favour done to them. \"And we\ndo so hope Mr. Cornbury will be successful,\" she said, as she bade\nher last farewell. This was spoken close to Mr. Tappitt's ear; and\nMrs. Cornbury flattered herself that after that Mr. Tappitt's vote\nwould be secure. Mr. Tappitt said nothing about his vote, but handed\nthe lady down stairs in solemn silence.\n\nThe Tappitt girls came and clustered about Rachel as she was going.\n\"I can't conceive why you are off so early,\" said Martha. \"No,\nindeed,\" said Mrs. Tappitt; \"only of course it would be very wrong to\nkeep Mrs. Cornbury waiting when she has been so excessively kind to\nyou.\" \"The naughty girl! It isn't that at all,\" said Cherry. \"It's\nshe that is hurrying Mrs. Cornbury away.\" \"Good night,\" said Augusta\nvery coldly. \"And Rachel,\" said Cherry, \"mind you come up to-morrow\nand talk it all over; we shall have so much to say.\" Then Rachel\nturned to go, and found Luke Rowan at her elbow waiting to take her\ndown. She had no alternative;--she must take his arm; and thus they\nwalked down stairs into the hall together.\n\n\"You'll come up here to-morrow,\" said he.\n\n\"No, no; tell Cherry that I shall not come.\"\n\n\"Then I shall go to Bragg's End. Will your mother let me call?\"\n\n\"No, don't come. Pray don't.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall;--certainly, certainly! What things have you got?\nLet me put your shawl on for you. If you do not come up to the girls,\nI shall certainly go down to you. Now, good-night. Good-night, Mrs.\nCornbury.\" And Luke, getting hold of Rachel's reluctant hand, pressed\nit with all his warmth.\n\n\"I don't want to ask indiscreet questions,\" said Mrs. Cornbury; \"but\nthat young man seems rather smitten, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Rachel, not knowing what to say.\n\n\"But I say,--oh, yes; a nice good-looking man he is too, and a\ngentleman, which is more than I can say for all of them there. What\nan escape you had of Mr. Griggs, my dear!\"\n\n\"Yes, I had. But I was so sorry that you should have to speak to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Of course I spoke to him. I was there to fight your battles for you.\nThat's why married ladies go to balls. You were quite right not to\ndance with him. A girl should always avoid any intimacy with such men\nas that. It is not that he would have done you any harm; but they\nstand in the way of your satisfaction and contentment. Balls are\ngiven specially for young ladies; and it is my theory that they are\nto make themselves happy while they are there, and not sacrifice\nthemselves to men whom they don't wish to know. You can't always\nrefuse when you're asked, but you can always get out of an engagement\nafterwards if you know what you're about. That was my way when I was\na girl.\" And this was the daughter of Mr. Comfort, whose somewhat\nmelancholy discourses against the world's pleasures and vanities had\nso often filled Rachel's bosom with awe!\n\nRachel sat silent, thinking of what had occurred at Mrs. Tappitt's;\nand thinking also that she ought to make some little speech to her\nfriend, thanking her for all that she had done. Ought she not also to\napologise in some way for her own conduct? \"What was that between you\nand my cousin Walter?\" Mrs. Cornbury asked, after a few moments.\n\n\"I hope I wasn't to blame,\" said Rachel. \"But--\"\n\n\"But what? Of course you weren't to blame;--unless it was in being\nrun after by so many gentlemen at once.\"\n\n\"He was going to take me down to supper,--and it was so kind of him.\nAnd then while we were waiting because the room down-stairs was full,\nthere was another quadrille, and I was engaged to Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; I understand. And so Master Walter got thrown once. His\nwrath in such matters never lasts very long. Here we are at Bragg's\nEnd. I've been so glad to have you with me; and I hope I may take\nyou again with me somewhere before long. Remember me kindly to your\nmother. There she is at the door waiting for you.\" Then Rachel jumped\nout of the carriage, and ran across the little gravel-path into the\nhouse.\n\nMrs. Ray had been waiting up for her daughter, and had been listening\neagerly for the wheels of the carriage. It was not yet two o'clock,\nand by ball-going people the hour of Rachel's return would have been\nconsidered early; but to Mrs. Ray anything after midnight was very\nlate. She was not, however, angry, or even vexed, but simply pleased\nthat her girl had at last come back to her. \"Oh, mamma, I'm afraid\nit has been very hard upon you, waiting for me!\" said Rachel; \"but\nI did come away as soon as I could.\" Mrs. Ray declared that she had\nnot found it all hard, and then,--with a laudable curiosity, seeing\nhow little she had known about balls,--desired to have an immediate\naccount of Rachel's doings.\n\n\"And did you get anybody to dance with you?\" asked the mother,\nfeeling a mother's ambition that her daughter should have been\n\"respectit like the lave.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; plenty of people asked me to dance.\"\n\n\"And did you find it come easy?\"\n\n\"Quite easy. I was frightened about the waltzing, at first.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you waltzed, Rachel?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma. Everybody did it. Mrs. Cornbury said she always waltzed\nwhen she was a girl; and as the things turned out I could not help\nmyself. I began with her cousin. I didn't mean to do it, but I got so\nashamed of myself that I couldn't refuse.\"\n\nMrs. Ray still was not angry; but she was surprised, and perhaps a\nlittle dismayed. \"And did you like it?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Were they all kind to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"You seem to have very little to say about it; but I suppose you're\ntired.\"\n\n\"I am tired, but it isn't that. It seems that there is so much to\nthink about. I'll tell you everything to-morrow, when I get quiet\nagain. Not that there is much to tell.\"\n\n\"Then I'll wish you good-night, dear.\"\n\n\"Good-night, mamma. Mrs. Cornbury was so kind,--you can have no idea\nhow good-natured she is.\"\n\n\"She always was a good creature.\"\n\n\"If I'd been her sister she couldn't have done more for me. I feel\nas though I were really quite fond of her. But she isn't a bit like\nwhat I expected. She chooses to have her own way; but then she is so\ngood-humoured! And when I got into any little trouble she--\"\n\n\"Well, what else did she do; and what trouble had you?\"\n\n\"I can't quite describe what I mean. She seemed to make so much of\nme;--just as she might have done if I'd been some grand young lady\ndown from London, or any, any;--you know what I mean.\"\n\nMrs. Ray sat with her candle in her hand, receiving great comfort\nfrom the knowledge that her daughter had been \"respectit.\" She knew\nwell what Rachel meant, and reflected, with perhaps a pardonable\npride, that she herself had \"come of decent people.\" The Tappitts\nwere higher than her in the world, and so were the Griggses. But she\nknew that her forbears had been gentlefolk, when there were, so to\nspeak, no Griggses and no Tappitts in existence. It was pleasant to\nher to think that her daughter had been treated as a lady.\n\n\"And she did do me such a kindness. That horrid Mr. Griggs was going\nto dance with me, and she wouldn't let him.\"\n\n\"I don't like that young man at all.\"\n\n\"Poor Cherry! you should hear her talk of him! And she would have\nstayed ever so much longer if I had not pressed her to go; and then\nshe has such a nice way of saying things.\"\n\n\"She always had that, when she was quite a young girl.\"\n\n\"I declare I feel that I quite love her. And there was such a grand\nsupper. Champagne!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I got some cold turkey. Mr. Rowan took me down to supper.\" These\nlast words were spoken very mildly, and Rachel, as she uttered them,\ndid not dare to look into her mother's face.\n\n\"Did you dance with him?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma, three times. I should have stayed later only I was\nengaged to dance with him twice more; and I didn't choose to do so.\"\n\n\"Was he--? Did he--?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma; I can't tell you. I don't know how to tell you. I wish\nyou knew it all without my saying anything. He says he shall come\nhere to-morrow if I don't go up to the brewery; and I can't possibly\ngo there now, after that.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything more than that, Rachel?\"\n\n\"He calls me Rachel, and speaks--I can't tell you how he speaks. If\nyou think it wrong, mamma, I won't ever see him again.\"\n\nMrs. Ray didn't know whether she ought to think it wrong or not. She\nwas inclined to wish that it was right and to believe that it was\nwrong. A few minutes ago Rachel was unable to open her mouth, and was\nanxious to escape to bed; but, now that the ice was broken between\nher and her mother, they sat up for more than an hour talking about\nLuke Rowan.\n\n\"I wonder whether he will really come?\" Rachel said to herself, as\nshe laid her head upon her pillow--\"and why does he want to come?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nMR. PRONG AT HOME.\n\n\nMrs. Tappitt's ball was celebrated on a Tuesday, and on the preceding\nMonday Mrs. Prime moved herself off, bag and baggage, to Miss\nPucker's lodgings. Miss Pucker had been elated with a dismal joy\nwhen the proposition was first made to her. \"Oh, yes; it was very\ndreadful. She would do anything;--of course she would give up the\nfront bedroom up-stairs to Mrs. Prime, and get a stretcher for\nherself in the little room behind, which looked out on the tiles of\nGriggs' sugar warehouse. She hadn't thought such a thing would have\nbeen possible; she really had not. A ball! Mrs. Prime couldn't help\ncoming away;--of course not. And there would be plenty of room for\nall her boxes in the small room behind the shop. Mrs. Ray's daughter\ngo to a ball!\" And then some threatening words were said as to the\ndestiny of wicked people, which shall not be repeated here.\n\nThat flitting had been a very dismal affair. An old man out of\nBaslehurst had come for Mrs. Prime's things with a donkey-cart, and\nthe old man, assisted by the girl, had carried them out together.\nRachel had remained secluded in her mother's room. The two sisters\nhad met at the same table at breakfast, but had not spoken over their\ntea and bread and butter. As Rachel was taking the cloth away Mrs.\nPrime had asked her solemnly whether she still persisted in bringing\nperdition upon herself and her mother. \"You have no right to ask me\nsuch a question,\" Rachel had answered, and taking herself up-stairs\nhad secluded herself till the old man with the donkey, followed by\nMrs. Prime, had taken himself away from Bragg's End. Mrs. Ray, as her\neldest daughter was leaving her, stood at the door of her house with\nher handkerchief to her eyes. \"It makes me very unhappy, Dorothea;\nso it does.\" \"And it makes me very unhappy, too, mother. Perhaps my\nsorrow in the matter is deeper than yours. But I must do my duty.\"\nThen the two widows kissed each other with a cold unloving kiss, and\nMrs. Prime had taken her departure from Bragg's End Cottage. \"It\nwill make a great difference in the housekeeping,\" Mrs. Ray said to\nRachel, and then she went to work at her little accounts.\n\nIt was Dorcas-day at Miss Pucker's, and as the work of the meeting\nbegan soon after Mrs. Prime had unpacked her boxes in the front\nbedroom and had made her little domestic arrangements with her\nfriend, that first day passed by without much tedium. Mrs. Prime was\nused to Miss Pucker, and was not therefore grievously troubled by the\nways and habits of that lady, much as they were unlike those to which\nshe had been accustomed at Bragg's End; but on the next morning, as\nshe was sitting with her companion after breakfast, an idea did come\ninto her head that Miss Pucker would not be a pleasant companion for\nlife. She would talk incessantly of the wickednesses of the cottage,\nand ask repeated questions about Rachel and the young man. Mrs. Prime\nwas undoubtedly very angry with her mother, and much shocked at\nher sister, but she did not relish the outspoken sympathy of her\nconfidential friend. \"He'll never marry her, you know. He don't think\nof such a thing,\" said Miss Pucker over and over again. Mrs. Prime\ndid not find this pleasant when spoken of her sister. \"And the young\nmen I'm told goes on anyhow, as they pleases at them dances,\" said\nMiss Pucker, who in the warmth of her intimacy forgot some of those\nlittle restrictions in speech with which she had burdened herself\nwhen first striving to acquire the friendship of Mrs. Prime. Before\ndinner was over Mrs. Prime had made up her mind that she must soon\nmove her staff again, and establish herself somewhere in solitude.\n\nAfter tea she took herself out for a walk, having managed to decline\nMiss Pucker's attendance, and as she walked she thought of Mr. Prong.\nWould it not be well for her to go to him and ask his further advice?\nHe would tell her in what way she had better live. He would tell her\nalso whether it was impossible that she should ever return to the\ncottage, for already her heart was becoming somewhat more soft than\nwas its wont. And as she walked she met Mr. Prong himself, intent on\nhis pastoral business. \"I was thinking of coming to you to-morrow,\"\nshe said, after their first salutation was over.\n\n\"Do,\" said he; \"do; come early,--before the toil of the day's work\ncommences. I also am specially anxious to see you. Will nine be too\nearly,--or, if you have not concluded your morning meal by that time,\nhalf-past nine?\"\n\nMrs. Prime assured him that her morning meal was always concluded\nbefore nine o'clock, and promised to be with him by that hour. Then\nas she slowly paced up the High Street to the Cawston Bridge and\nback again, she wondered within herself as to the matter on which Mr.\nProng could specially want to see her. He might probably desire to\nclaim her services for some woman's work in his sheepfold. He should\nhave them willingly, for she had begun to feel that she would sooner\nco-operate with Mr. Prong than with Miss Pucker. As she returned down\nthe High Street, and came near to her own door, she saw the cause\nof all her family troubles standing at the entrance to Griggs's\nwine-store. He was talking to the shopman within, and as she passed\nshe frowned grimly beneath her widow's bonnet. \"Send them to the\nbrewery at once,\" said Luke Rowan to the man. \"They are wanted this\nevening.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the man.\n\n\"And tell your fellow to take them round to the back door.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the man, winking with one eye. He understood very\nwell that young Rowan was ordering the champagne for Mrs. Tappitt's\nsupper, and that it was thought desirable that Mr. Tappitt shouldn't\nsee the bottles going into the house.\n\nMiss Pucker possessed at any rate the virtue of being early, so that\nMrs. Prime had no difficulty in concluding her \"morning meal,\" and\nbeing at Mr. Prong's house punctually at nine o'clock. Mr. Prong,\nit seemed, had not been quite so steadfast to his purpose, for his\nteapot was still upon the table, together with the debris of a large\ndish of shrimps, the eating of small shell-fish being an innocent\nenjoyment to which he was much addicted.\n\n\"Dear me; so it is; just nine. We'll have these things away in a\nminute. Mrs. Mudge; Mrs. Mudge!\" Whereupon Mrs. Mudge came forth,\nand between the three the table was soon cleared. \"I wish you hadn't\ncaught me so late,\" said Mr. Prong; \"it looks as though I hadn't been\nthinking of you.\" Then he picked up the stray shell of a shrimp, and\nin order that he might get rid of it, put it into his mouth. Mrs.\nPrime said she hoped she didn't trouble him, and that of course she\ndidn't expect him to be thinking about her particularly. Then Mr.\nProng looked at her in a way that was very particular out of the\ncorner of his eyes, and assured her that he had been thinking of\nher all night. After that Mrs. Prime sat down on a horsehair-seated\nchair, and Mr. Prong sat on another opposite to her, leaning back,\nwith his eyes nearly closed, and his hands folded upon his lap.\n\n\"I don't think Miss Pucker's will quite do for me,\" said Mrs. Prime,\nbeginning her story first.\n\n\"I never thought it would, my friend,\" said Mr. Prong, with his eyes\nstill nearly closed.\n\n\"She's a very good woman,--an excellent woman, and her heart is full\nof love and charity. But--\"\n\n\"I quite understand it, my friend. She is not in all things the\ncompanion you desire.\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure that I shall want any companion.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed Mr. Prong, shaking his head, but still keeping his eyes\nclosed.\n\n\"I think I would rather be alone, if I do not return to them at the\ncottage. I would fain return if only they--\"\n\n\"If only they would return too. Yes! That would be a glorious end to\nthe struggle you have made, if you can bring them back with you from\nfollowing after the Evil One! But you cannot return to them now, if\nyou are to countenance by your presence dancings and love-makings\nin the open air,\"--why worse in the open air than in a close\nlittle parlour in a back street, Mr. Prong did not say,--\"and loud\nrevellings, and the absence of all good works, and rebellion against\nthe Spirit.\" Mr. Prong was becoming energetic in his language, and at\none time had raised himself in his chair, and opened his eyes. But he\nclosed them at once, and again fell back. \"No, my friend,\" said he,\n\"no. It must not be so. They must be rescued from the burning; but\nnot so,--not so.\" After that for a minute or two they both sat still\nin silence.\n\n\"I think I shall get two small rooms for myself in one of the quiet\nstreets, near the new church,\" said she.\n\n\"Ah, yes, perhaps so,--for a time.\"\n\n\"Till I may be able to go back to mother. It's a sad thing families\nbeing divided, Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is sad;--unless it tends to the doing of the Lord's work.\"\n\n\"But I hope;--I do hope, that all this may be changed. Rachel I know\nis obstinate, but mother means well, Mr. Prong. She means to do her\nduty, if only she had good teaching near her.\"\n\n\"I hope she may, I hope she may. I trust that they may both be\nbrought to see the true light. We will wrestle for them,--you and me.\nWe will wrestle for them,--together. Mrs. Prime, my friend, if you\nare prepared to hear me with attention, I have a proposition to make\nwhich I think you will acknowledge to be one of importance.\" Then\nsuddenly he sat bolt upright, opened his eyes wide, and dressed his\nmouth with all the solemn dignity of which he was the master. \"Are\nyou prepared to listen to me, Mrs. Prime?\"\n\nMrs. Prime, who was somewhat astonished, said in a low voice that she\nwas prepared to listen.\n\n\"Because I must beg you to hear me out. I shall fail altogether in\nreaching your intelligence,--whatever effect I might possibly have\nupon your heart,--unless you will hear me to the end.\"\n\n\"I will hear you certainly, Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, for it will be necessary. If I could convey to your\nmind all that is now passing through my own, without any spoken word,\nhow glad should I be! The words of men, when taken at the best, how\nweak they are! They often tell a tale quite different from that which\nthe creature means who uses them. Every minister has felt that in\naddressing his flock from the pulpit. I feel it myself sadly, but I\nnever felt it so sadly as I do now.\"\n\nMrs. Prime did not quite understand him, but she assured him again\nthat she would give his words her best attention, and that she would\nendeavour to gather from them no other meaning than that which seemed\nto be his. \"Ah,--seemed!\" said he. \"There is so much of seeming in\nthis deceitful world. But you will believe this of me, that whatever\nI do, I do as tending to the strengthening of my hands in the\nministry.\" Mrs. Prime said that she would believe so much; and then\nas she looked into her companion's face, she became aware that there\nwas something of weakness displayed in that assuming mouth. She did\nnot argue about it within her own mind, but the fact had in some way\nbecome revealed to her.\n\n\"My friend,\" said he,--and as he spoke he drew his chair across the\nrug, so as to bring it very near to that on which Mrs. Prime was\nsitting--\"our destinies in this world, yours and mine, are in many\nthings alike. We are both alone. We both of us have our hands full of\nwork, and of work which in many respects is the same. We are devoted\nto the same cause: is it not so?\" Mrs. Prime, who had been told that\nshe was to listen and not to speak, did not at first make any answer.\nBut she was pressed by a repetition of the question. \"Is it not so,\nMrs. Prime?\"\n\n\"I can never make my work equal to that of a minister of the Gospel,\"\nsaid she.\n\n\"But you can share the work of such a minister. You understand me\nnow. And let me assure you of this; that in making this proposition\nto you, I am not self-seeking. It is not my own worldly comfort and\nhappiness to which I am chiefly looking.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Prime, \"I suppose not.\" Perhaps there was in her\nvoice the slightest touch of soreness.\n\n\"No;--not chiefly to that. I want assistance, confidential\nintercourse, sympathy, a congenial mind, support when I am like to\nfaint, counsel when I am pressing on, aid when the toil is too heavy\nfor me, a kind word when the day's work is over. And you,--do you not\ndesire the same? Are we not alike in that, and would it not be well\nthat we should come together?\" Mr. Prong as he spoke had put out his\nhand, and rested it on the table with the palm upwards, as though\nexpecting that she would put hers within it; and he had tilted his\nchair so as to bring his body closer to hers, and had dropped from\nhis face his assumed look of dignity. He was quite in earnest, and\nbeing so had fallen away into his natural dispositions of body.\n\n\"I do not quite understand you,\" said Mrs. Prime. She did however\nunderstand him perfectly, but thought it expedient that he should\nbe required to speak a little further before she answered him. She\nwanted time also to arrange her reply. As yet she had not made up her\nmind whether she would say yes or no.\n\n\"Mrs. Prime, I am offering to make you my wife. I have said nothing\nof love, of that human affection which one of God's creatures\nentertains for another;--not, I can assure you, because I do not feel\nit, but because I think that you and I should be governed in our\nconduct by a sense of duty, rather than by the poor creature-longings\nof the heart.\"\n\n\"The heart is very deceitful,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"That is true,--very true; but my heart, in this matter, is not\ndeceitful. I entertain for you all that deep love which a man should\nfeel for her who is to be the wife of his bosom.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Prong--\"\n\n\"Let me finish before you give me your answer. I have thought much\nof this, as you may believe; and by only one consideration have I\nbeen made to doubt the propriety of taking this step. People will\nsay that I am marrying you for,--for your money, in short. It is\nan insinuation which would give me much pain, but I have resolved\nwithin my own mind, that it is my duty to bear it. If my motives are\npure,\"--here he paused a moment for a word or two of encouragement,\nbut received none,--\"and if the thing itself be good, I ought not to\nbe deterred by any fear of what the wicked may say. Do you not agree\nwith me in that?\"\n\nMrs. Prime still did not answer. She felt that any word of assent,\nthough given by her to a minor proposition, might be taken as\ninvolving some amount of assent towards the major proposition. Mr.\nProng had enjoyed the advantage of thinking over his matrimonial\nprospects in undisturbed solitude, but she had as yet possessed no\nsuch advantage. As the idea had never before presented itself to her,\nshe did not feel inclined to commit herself hastily.\n\n\"And as regards money,\" he continued.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Prime, looking down demurely upon the ground, for\nMr. Prong had not at once gone on to say what were his ideas about\nmoney.\n\n\"And as regards money,--need I hardly declare that my motives are\npure and disinterested? I am aware that in worldly affairs you are\nat present better off than I am. My professional income from the\npew-rents is about a hundred and thirty pounds a year.\"--It must\nbe admitted that it was very hard work. By this time Mr. Prong\nhad withdrawn his hand from the table, finding that attempt to be\nhopeless, and had re-settled his chair upon its four feet. He had\ncommenced by requesting Mrs. Prime to hear him patiently, but he had\nprobably not calculated that she would have listened with a patience\nso cruel and unrelenting. She did not even speak a word when he\ncommunicated to her the amount of his income. \"That is what I receive\nhere,\" he continued, \"and you are probably aware that I have no\nprivate means of my own.\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"No; none. But what then?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no.\"\n\n\"Money is but dross. Who feels that more strongly than you do?\"\n\nMr. Prong in all that he was saying intended to be honest, and in\nasserting that money was dross, he believed that he spoke his true\nmind. He thought also that he was passing a just eulogium on Mrs.\nPrime, in declaring that she was of the same opinion. But he was not\nquite correct in this, either as regarded himself, or as regarded\nher. He did not covet money, but he valued it very highly; and as\nfor Mrs. Prime, she had an almost unbounded satisfaction in her own\nindependence. She had, after all, but two hundred a year, out of\nwhich she gave very much in charity. But this giving in charity was\nher luxury. Fine raiment and dainty food tempted her not at all; but\nnevertheless she was not free from temptations, and did not perhaps\nalways resist them. To be mistress of her money, and to superintend\nthe gifts, not only of herself but of others; to be great among the\npoor, and esteemed as a personage in her district,--that was her\nambition. When Mr. Prong told her that money in her sight was dross,\nshe merely shook her head. Why was it that she wrote those terribly\ncaustic notes to the agent in Exeter if her quarterly payments were\never late by a single week? \"Defend me from a lone widow,\" the agent\nused to say, \"and especially if she's evangelical.\" Mrs. Prime\ndelighted in the sight of the bit of paper which conveyed to her the\npossession of her periodical wealth. To her money certainly was not\ndross, and I doubt if it was truly so regarded by Mr. Prong himself.\n\n\"Any arrangements that you choose as to settlements or the like of\nthat, could of course be made.\" Mr. Prong when he began, or rather\nwhen he made up his mind to begin, had determined that he would use\nall his best power of language in pressing his suit; but the work\nhad been so hard that his fine language had got itself lost in the\nstruggle. I doubt whether this made much difference with Mrs. Prime;\nor it may be, that he had sustained the propriety of his words as\nlong as such propriety was needful and salutary to his purpose. Had\nhe spoken of the \"like of that\" at the opening of the negotiation, he\nmight have shocked his hearer; but now she was too deeply engaged in\nsolid serious considerations to care much for the words which were\nused. \"A hundred and thirty from pew-rents,\" she said to herself, as\nhe endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to look under her bonnet into her\nface.\n\n\"I think I have said it all now,\" he continued. \"If you will trust\nyourself into my keeping I will endeavour, with God's assistance, to\ndo my duty by you. I have said but little personally of myself or of\nmy feelings, hoping that it might be unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite so,\" said she.\n\n\"I have spoken rather of those duties which we should undertake\ntogether in sweet companionship, if you will consent to--to--to be\nMrs. Prong, in short.\" Then he waited for an answer.\n\nAs she sat in her widow's weeds, there was not, to the eye, the\npromise in her of much sweet companionship. Her old crape bonnet\nhad been lugged and battered about--not out of all shape, as hats\nand bonnets are sometimes battered by young ladies, in which guise,\nif the young ladies themselves be pretty, the battered hats and\nbonnets are often more becoming than ever they were in their proper\nshapes--but so as closely to fit her head, and almost hide her\nface. Her dress was so made, and so put on, as to give to her the\nappearance of almost greater age than her mother's. She had studied\nto divest herself of all outward show of sweet companionship; but\nperhaps she was not the less, on that account, gratified to find that\nshe had not altogether succeeded.\n\n\"I have done with the world, and all the world's vanities and cares,\"\nshe said, shaking her head.\n\n\"No one can have done with the world as long as there is work in it\nfor him or her to do. The monks and nuns tried that, and you know\nwhat they came to.\"\n\n\"But I am a widow.\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend; and have shown yourself, as such, very willing to do\nyour part. But do you not know that you could be more active and more\nuseful as a clergyman's wife than you can be as a solitary woman?\"\n\n\"But my heart is buried, Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"No; not so. While the body remains in this vale of tears, the heart\nmust remain with it.\" Mrs. Prime shook her head; but in an anatomical\npoint of view, Mr. Prong was no doubt strictly correct. \"Other hopes\nwill arise,--and perhaps, too, other cares, but they will be sources\nof gentle happiness.\"\n\nMrs. Prime understood him as alluding to a small family, and again\nshook her head at the allusion.\n\n\"What I have said may probably have taken you by surprise.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has, Mr. Prong;--very much.\"\n\n\"And if so, it may be that you would wish time for consideration\nbefore you give me an answer.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will be best, Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"Let it be so. On what day shall we say? Will Friday suit you? If I\ncome to you on Friday morning, perhaps Miss Pucker will be there.\"\n\n\"Yes, she will.\"\n\n\"And in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"We shall be at the Dorcas meeting.\"\n\n\"I don't like to trouble you to come here again.\"\n\nMrs. Prime herself felt that there was a difficulty. Hitherto she had\nentertained no objection to calling on Mr. Prong at his own house.\nHis little sitting-room had been as holy ground to her,--almost as\npart of the church, and she had taken herself there without scruple.\nBut things had now been put on a different footing. It might be that\nthat room would become her own peculiar property, but she could never\nagain regard it in a simply clerical light. It had become as it were\na bower of love, and she could not take her steps thither with the\nexpress object of assenting to the proposition made to her,--or even\nwith that of dissenting from it. \"Perhaps,\" said she, \"you could call\nat ten on Saturday. Miss Pucker will be out marketing.\" To this Mr.\nProng agreed, and then Mrs. Prime got up and took her leave. How\nfearfully wicked would Rachel have been in her eyes, had Rachel made\nan appointment with a young man at some hour and some place in which\nshe might be found alone! But then it is so easy to trust oneself,\nand so easy also to distrust others.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said Mrs. Prime; and as she went she gave her hand as\na matter of course to her lover.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said he; \"and think well of this if you can do so. If you\nbelieve that you will be more useful as my wife than you can be in\nyour present position,--then--\"\n\n\"You think it would be my duty to--\"\n\n\"Well, I will leave that for you to decide. I merely wish to put\nthe matter before you. But, pray, understand this; money need be no\nhindrance.\" Then, having said that last word, he let her go.\n\nShe walked away very slowly, and did not return by the most direct\nroad to Miss Pucker's rooms. There was much to be considered in\nthe offer that had been made to her. Her lot in life would be\nvery lonely if this separation from her mother and sister should\nbecome permanent. She had already made up her mind that a continued\nresidence with Miss Pucker would not suit her; and although, on that\nvery morning, she had felt that there would be much comfort in living\nby herself, now, as she looked forward to that loneliness, it had\nfor her very little attraction. Might it not be true, also, that she\ncould do more good as a clergyman's wife than could possibly come\nwithin her reach as a single woman? She had tried that life once\nalready, but then she had been very young. As that memory came upon\nher, she looked back to her early life, and thought of the hopes\nwhich had been hers as she stood at the altar, now so many years ago.\nHow different had been everything with her then! She remembered the\nsort of love she had felt in her heart, and told herself that there\ncould be no repetition of such love on Mr. Prong's behalf. She had\ncome round in her walk to that very churchyard stile at which she\nhad seen Rachel standing with Luke Rowan, and as she remembered some\npassages in her own girlish days, she almost felt inclined to forgive\nher sister. But then, on a sudden, she drew herself up almost with a\ngasp, and went on quickly with her walk. Had she not herself in those\ndays walked in darkness, and had it not since that been vouchsafed\nto her to see the light? In her few months of married happiness it\nhad been given to her to do but little of that work which might now\nbe possible to her. Then she had been married in the flesh; now she\nwould be married in the spirit;--she would be married in the spirit,\nif it should, on final consideration, seem good to her to accept Mr.\nProng's offer in that light. Then unconsciously, she began to reflect\non the rights of a married woman with regard to money,--and also on\nthe wrongs. She was not sure as to the law, and asked herself whether\nit would be possible for her to consult an attorney. Finally, she\nthought it would not be practicable to do so before giving her answer\nto Mr. Prong.\n\nAnd she could not even ask her mother. As to that, too, she\nquestioned herself, and resolved that she could not so far lower\nherself under existing circumstances. There was no one to whom she\ncould go for advice. But we may say this of her,--let her have asked\nwhom she would, she would have at least been guided by her own\njudgment. If only she could have obtained some slight amount of legal\ninformation, how useful it would have been!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nLUKE ROWAN DECLARES HIS PLANS AS TO THE BREWERY.\n\n\n\"The truth is, T., there was some joking among the young people\nabout the wine, and then Rowan went and ordered it.\" This was Mrs.\nTappitt's explanation about the champagne, made to her husband on the\nnight of the ball, before she was allowed to go to sleep. But this\nby no means satisfied him. He did not choose, as he declared, that\nany young man should order whatever he might think necessary for his\nhouse. Then Mrs. Tappitt made it worse. \"To tell the truth, T., I\nthink it was intended as a present to the girls. We are doing a great\ndeal to make him comfortable, you know, and I fancy he thought it\nright to make them this little return.\" She should have known her\nhusband better. It was true that he grudged the cost of the wine; but\nhe would have preferred to endure that to the feeling that his table\nhad been supplied by another man,--by a young man whom he wished to\nregard as subject to himself, but who would not be subject, and at\nwhom he was beginning to look with very unfavourable eyes. \"A present\nto the girls? I tell you I won't have such presents. And if it was\nso, I think he has been very impertinent,--very impertinent indeed.\nI shall tell him so,--and I shall insist on paying for the wine. And\nI must say, you ought not to have taken it.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear T., I have been working so hard all night; and I do think\nyou ought to let me go to sleep now, instead of scolding me.\"\n\nOn the following morning the party was of course discussed in the\nTappitt family under various circumstances. At the breakfast-table\nMrs. Rowan, with her son and daughter, were present; and then a song\nof triumph was sung. Everything had gone off with honour and glory,\nand the brewery had been immortalized for years to come. Mrs. Butler\nCornbury's praises were spoken,--with some little drawback of a sneer\non them, because \"she had made such a fuss with that girl Rachel\nRay;\" and then the girls had told of their partners, and Luke had\ndeclared it all to have been superb. But when the Rowans' backs were\nturned, and the Tappitts were alone together, others besides old\nTappitt himself had words to say in dispraise of Luke. Mrs. Tappitt\nhad been much inclined to make little of her husband's objections\nto the young man while she hoped that he might possibly become her\nson-in-law. He might have been a thorn in the brewery, among the\nvats, but he would have been a flourishing young bay-tree in the\nouter world of Baslehurst. She had, however, no wish to encourage\nthe growth of a thorn within her own premises, in order that Rachel\nRay, or such as she, might have the advantage of the bay-tree. Luke\nRowan had behaved very badly at her party. Not only had he failed\nto distinguish either of her own girls, but he had, as Mrs. Tappitt\nsaid, made himself so conspicuous with that foolish girl, that all\nthe world had been remarking it.\n\n\"Mrs. Butler Cornbury seemed to think it all right,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"Mrs. Butler Cornbury is not everybody,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"I didn't\nthink it right, I can assure you;--and what's more, your papa didn't\nthink it right.\"\n\n\"And he was going on all the evening as though he were quite master\nin the house,\" said Augusta. \"He was ordering the musicians to do\nthis and that all the evening.\"\n\n\"He'll find that he's not master. Your papa is going to speak to him\nthis very day.\"\n\n\"What!--about Rachel?\" asked Cherry, in dismay.\n\n\"About things in general,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. Then Mary Rowan\nreturned to the room, and they all went back upon the glories of\nthe ball. \"I think it was nice,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, simpering. \"I'm\nsure there was no trouble spared,--nor yet expense.\" She knew that\nshe ought not to have uttered that last word, and she would have\nrefrained if it had been possible to her;--but it was not possible.\nThe man who tells you how much his wine costs a dozen, knows that he\nis wrong while the words are in his mouth; but they are in his mouth,\nand he cannot restrain them.\n\nMr. Tappitt was not about to lecture Luke Rowan as to his conduct in\nregard to Rachel Ray. He found some difficulty in speaking to his\nwould-be partner, even on matters of business, in a proper tone, and\nwith becoming authority. As he was so much the senior, and Rowan so\nmuch the junior, some such tone of superiority was, as he thought,\nindispensable. But he had great difficulty in assuming it. Rowan had\na way with him that was not exactly a way of submission, and Tappitt\nwould certainly not have dared to encounter him on any such matter as\nhis behaviour in a drawing-room. When the time came he had not even\nthe courage to allude to those champagne bottles; and it may be as\nwell explained that Rowan paid the little bill at Griggs's, without\nfurther reference to the matter. But the question of the brewery\nmanagement was a matter vital to Tappitt. There, among the vats,\nhe had reigned supreme since Bungall ceased to be king, and for\ncontinual mastery there it was worth his while to make a fight. That\nhe was under difficulties even in that fight he had already begun\nto know. He could not talk Luke Rowan down, and make him go about\nhis work in an orderly, every-day, business-like fashion. Luke\nRowan would not be talked down, nor would he be orderly,--not\naccording to Mr. Tappitt's orders. No doubt Mr. Tappitt, under\nthese circumstances, could decline the partnership; and this he\nwas disposed to do; but he had been consulting lawyers, consulting\npapers, and looking into old accounts, and he had reason to fear,\nthat under Bungall's will, Luke Rowan would have the power of\nexacting from him much more than he was inclined to give.\n\n\"You'd better take him into the concern,\" the lawyer had said. \"A\nyoung head is always useful.\"\n\n\"Not when the young head wants to be master,\" Tappitt had answered.\n\"If I'm to do that the whole thing will go to the dogs.\" He did not\nexactly explain to the lawyer that Rowan had carried his infatuation\nso far as to be desirous of brewing good beer, but he did make it\nvery clear that such a partner would, in his eyes, be anything but\ndesirable.\n\n\"Then, upon my word, I think you'll have to give him the ten thousand\npounds. I don't even know but what the demand is moderate.\"\n\nThis was very bad news to Tappitt. \"But suppose I haven't got ten\nthousand pounds!\" Now it was very well known that the property and\nthe business were worth money, and the lawyer suggested that Rowan\nmight take steps to have the whole concern sold. \"Probably he might\nbuy it himself and undertake to pay you so much a year,\" suggested\nthe lawyer. But this view of the matter was not at all in accordance\nwith Mr. Tappitt's ideas. He had been brewer in Baslehurst for nearly\nthirty years, and still wished to remain so. Mrs. Tappitt had been of\nopinion that all difficulties might be overcome if only Luke would\nfall in love with one of her girls. Mrs. Rowan had been invited to\nBaslehurst specially with a view to some such arrangement. But Luke\nRowan, as it seemed to them both now, was an obstinate young man,\nwho, in matters of beer as well as in matters of love, would not be\nguided by those who best knew how to guide him. Mrs. Tappitt had\nwatched him closely at the ball, and had now given him up altogether.\nHe had danced only once with Augusta, and then had left her the\nmoment the dance was over. \"I should offer him a hundred and fifty\npounds a year out of the concern, and if he didn't like that let him\nlump it,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"Lump it!\" said Mr. Tappitt. \"That means\ngoing to a London lawyer.\" He felt the difficulties of his position\nas he prepared to speak his mind to young Rowan on the morning after\nthe party; but on that occasion his strongest feeling was in favour\nof expelling the intruder. Any lot in life would be preferable to\nworking in the brewery with such a partner as Luke Rowan.\n\n\"I suppose your head's hardly cool enough for business,\" he said, as\nLuke came in and took a stool in his office. Tappitt was sitting in\nhis customary chair, with his arm resting on a large old-fashioned\nleather-covered table, which was strewed with his papers, and which\nhad never been reduced to cleanliness or order within the memory of\nany one connected with the establishment. He had turned his chair\nround from its accustomed place so as to face Rowan, who had perched\nhimself on a stool which was commonly occupied by a boy whom Tappitt\nemployed in his own office.\n\n\"My head not cool!\" said Rowan. \"It's as cool as a cucumber. I wasn't\ndrinking last night.\"\n\n\"I thought you might be tired with the dancing.\" Then Tappitt's mind\nflew off to the champagne, and he determined that the young man\nbefore him was too disagreeable to be endured.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. Those things never tire me. I was across here with\nthe men before eight this morning. Do you know, I'm sure we could\nsave a third of the fuel by altering the flues. I never saw such\ncontrivances. They must have been put in by the coal-merchants, for\nthe sake of wasting coal.\"\n\n\"If you please, we won't mind the flues at present.\"\n\n\"I only tell you; it's for your sake much more than my own. If you\nwon't believe me, do you ask Newman to look at them the first time\nyou see him in Baslehurst.\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw for Newman.\"\n\n\"He's got the best concerns in Devonshire, and knows what he's about\nbetter than any man in these parts.\"\n\n\"I dare say. But now, if you please, we won't mind him. The concerns,\nas I have managed them, have done very well for me for the last\nthirty years;--very well I may say also for your uncle, who\nunderstood what he was doing. I'm not very keen for so many changes.\nThey cost a great deal of money, and as far as I can see don't often\nlead to much profit.\"\n\n\"If we don't go on with the world,\" said Rowan, \"the world will leave\nus behind. Look at the new machinery they're introducing everywhere.\nPeople don't do it because they like to spend their money. It's\ncompetition; and there's competition in beer as well as in other\nthings.\"\n\nFor a minute or two Mr. Tappitt sat in silence collecting his\nthoughts, and then he began his speech. \"I'll tell you what it is,\nRowan, I don't like these new-fangled ways. They're very well for\nyou, I dare say. You are young, and perhaps you may see your way.\nI'm old, and I don't see mine among all these changes. It's clear to\nme that you and I could not go on together as partners in the same\nconcern. I should expect to have my own way,--first because I've a\ndeal of experience, and next because my share in the concern would be\nso much the greatest.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Mr. Tappitt; I'm not quite sure that it would be much\nthe greatest. I don't want to say anything about that now; only if I\nwere to let your remark pass without notice it would seem that I had\nassented.\"\n\n\"Ah; very well. I can only say that I hope you'll find yourself\nmistaken. I've been over thirty years in the concern, and it would be\nodd if I with my large family were to find myself only equal to you,\nwho have never been in the business at all, and ain't even married\nyet.\"\n\n\"I don't see what being married has to do with it.\"\n\n\"Don't you? You'll find that's the way we look at these things down\nin these parts. You're not in London here, Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"Certainly not; but I suppose the laws are the same. This is an\naffair of capital.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" said Mr. Tappitt. \"I don't know that you've brought in any\ncapital.\"\n\n\"Bungall did, and I'm here as his representative. But you'd better\nlet that pass by just at present. If we can agree as to the\nmanagement of the business, you won't find me a hard man to deal\nwith as to our relative shares.\" Hereupon Tappitt scratched his head,\nand tried to think. \"But I don't see how we are to agree about the\nmanagement,\" he continued. \"You won't be led by anybody.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that. I certainly want to improve the concern.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; and so ruin it. Whereas I've been making money out of it\nthese thirty years. You and I won't do together; that's the long of\nit and the short of it.\"\n\n\"It would be a putting of new wine into old bottles, you think?\"\nsuggested Rowan.\n\n\"I'm not saying anything about wine; but I do think that I ought to\nknow something about beer.\"\n\n\"And I'm to understand,\" said Rowan, \"that you have definitively\ndetermined not to carry on the old concern in conjunction with me as\nyour partner.\"\n\n\"Yes; I think I have.\"\n\n\"But it will be as well to be sure. One can't allow one's self to\ndepend upon thinking.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sure; I've made up my mind. I've no doubt you're a very\nclever young man, but I am quite sure we should not do together; and\nto tell you the truth, Rowan, I don't think you'll ever make your\nfortune by brewing.\"\n\n\"You think not?\"\n\n\"No; never.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for that.\"\n\n\"I don't know that you need be sorry. You'll have a nice income for\na single man to begin the world with, and there's other businesses\nbesides brewing,--and a deal better.\"\n\n\"Ah! But I've made up my mind to be a brewer. I like it. There's\nopportunity for chemical experiments, and room for philosophical\ninquiry, which gives the trade a charm in my eyes. I dare say it\nseems odd to you, but I like being a brewer.\"\n\nTappitt only scratched his head, and stared at him. \"I do indeed,\"\ncontinued Rowan. \"Now a man can't do anything to improve his own\ntrade as a lawyer. A great deal will be done; but I've made up my\nmind that all that must come from the outside. All trades want\nimproving; but I like a trade in which I can do the improvements\nmyself,--from the inside. Do you understand me, Mr. Tappitt?\"\nMr. Tappitt did not understand him,--was very far indeed from\nunderstanding him.\n\n\"With such ideas as those I don't think Baslehurst is the ground for\nyou,\" said Mr. Tappitt.\n\n\"The very ground!\" said Rowan. \"That's just it;--it's the very place\nI want. Brewing, as I take it, is at a lower ebb here than in any\nother part of England,\"--this at any rate was not complimentary to\nthe brewer of thirty years' standing--\"than in any other part of\nEngland. The people swill themselves with the nasty juice of the\napple because sound malt and hops have never been brought within\ntheir reach. I think Devonshire is the very county for a man who\nmeans to work hard, and who wishes to do good; and in all Devonshire\nI don't think there's a more fitting town than Baslehurst.\"\n\nMr. Tappitt was dumbfounded. Did this young man mean him to\nunderstand that it was his intention to open a rival establishment\nunder his nose; to set up with Bungall's money another brewery in\nopposition to Bungall's brewery? Could such ingratitude as that be in\nthe mind of any one? \"Oh,\" said Tappitt; \"I don't quite understand,\nbut I don't doubt but what you say is all very fine.\"\n\n\"I don't think that it's fine at all, Mr. Tappitt, but I believe that\nit's true. I represent Mr. Bungall's interest here in Baslehurst, and\nI intend to carry on Mr. Bungall's business in the town in which he\nestablished it.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Bungall's business;--this here, where I'm sitting, and\nit is in my hands.\"\n\n\"The use of these premises depends on you certainly.\"\n\n\"Yes; and the name of the firm, and the--the--the--. In point of\nfact, this is the old establishment. I never heard of such a thing in\nall my life.\"\n\n\"Quite true; it is the old establishment; and if I should set up\nanother brewery here, as I think it probable I may, I shall not make\nuse of Bungall's name. In the first place it would hardly be fair;\nand in the next place, by all accounts, he brewed such very bad beer\nthat it would not be a credit to me. If you'll tell me what your plan\nis, then I'll tell you mine. You'll find that everything shall be\nabove-board, Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"My plan? I've got no plan. I mean to go on here as I've always\ndone.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you intend to come to some arrangement with me. My\nclaims are these: I will either come into this establishment on an\nequal footing with yourself, as regards share and management, or else\nI shall look to you to give me the sum of money to which my lawyers\ntell me I am entitled. In fact, you must either take me in or buy me\nout.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of a settled income.\"\n\n\"No; it wouldn't suit me. I have told you what are my intentions, and\nto carry them out I must either have a concern of my own, or a share\nin a concern. A settled income would do me no good.\"\n\n\"Two hundred a-year,\" suggested Tappitt.\n\n\"Psha! Three per cent. would give me three hundred.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds is out of the question, you know.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Tappitt. I can't say anything fairer than I have\ndone. It will suit my own views much the best to start alone, but I\ndo not wish to oppose you if I can help it. Start alone I certainly\nwill, if I cannot come in here on my own terms.\"\n\nAfter that there was nothing more said. Tappitt turned round,\npretending to read his letters, and Rowan descending from his seat\nwalked out into the yard of the brewery. His intention had been, ever\nsince he had looked around him in Baslehurst, to be master of that\nplace, or if not of that, to be master of some other. \"It would break\nmy heart to be sending out such stuff as that all my life,\" he said\nto himself, as he watched the muddy stream run out of the shallow\ncoolers. He had resolved that he would brew good beer. As to that\nambition of putting down the consumption of cider, I myself am\ninclined to think that the habits of the country would be too strong\nfor him. At the present moment he lighted a cigar and sauntered\nabout the yard. He had now, for the first time, spoken openly of his\npurpose to Mr. Tappitt; but, having done so, he resolved that there\nshould be no more delay. \"I'll give him till Saturday for an answer,\"\nhe said. \"If he isn't ready with one by that time I'll manage it\nthrough the lawyers.\" After that he turned his mind to Rachel Ray and\nthe events of the past evening. He had told Rachel that he would go\nout to Bragg's End if she did not come into town, and he was quite\nresolved that he would do so. He knew well that she would not come\nin, understanding exactly those feelings of hers which would prevent\nit. Therefore his walk to Bragg's End on that afternoon was a settled\nthing with him. They were to dine at the brewery at three, and he\nwould go almost immediately after dinner. But what would he say to\nher when he got there, and what would he say to her mother? He had\nnot even yet made up his mind that he would positively ask her on\nthat day to be his wife, and yet he felt that if he found her at home\nhe would undoubtedly do so. \"I'll arrange it all,\" said he, \"as I'm\nwalking over.\" Then he threw away the end of his cigar, and wandered\nabout for the next half-hour among the vats and tubs and furnaces.\n\nMr. Tappitt took himself into the house as soon as he found himself\nable to do so without being seen by young Rowan. He took himself into\nthe house in order that he might consult with his wife as to this\nunexpected revelation that had been made to him; or rather that he\nmight have an opportunity of saying to some one all the hard things\nwhich were now crowding themselves upon his mind with reference to\nthis outrageous young man. Had anything ever been known, or heard, or\ntold, equal in enormity to this wickedness! He was to be called upon\nto find capital for the establishment of a rival in his own town, or\nelse he was to bind himself in a partnership with a youth who knew\nnothing of his business, but was nevertheless resolved to constitute\nhimself the chief manager of it! He who had been so true to Bungall\nin his young days was now to be sacrificed in his old age to\nBungall's audacious representative! In the first glow of his anger\nhe declared to his wife that he would pay no money and admit of no\npartnership. If Rowan did not choose to take his income as old Mrs.\nBungall had taken hers he might seek what redress the law would give\nhim. It was in vain that Mrs. Tappitt suggested that they would\nall be ruined. \"Then we will be ruined,\" said Tappitt, hot with\nindignation; \"but all Baslehurst,--all Devonshire shall know why.\"\nPernicious young man! He could not explain,--he could not even quite\nunderstand in what the atrocity of Rowan's proposed scheme consisted,\nbut he was possessed by a full conviction that it was atrocious. He\nhad admitted this man into his house; he was even now entertaining as\nhis guests the man's mother and sister; he had allowed him to have\nthe run of the brewery, so that he had seen both the nakedness and\nthe fat of the land; and this was to be his reward! \"If I were to\ntell it at the reading-room,\" said Tappitt, \"he would never be able\nto show himself again in the High Street.\"\n\nMrs. Tappitt, who was anxious but not enraged, did not see the matter\nquite in the same light, but she was not able to oppose her husband\nin his indignation. When she suggested that it might be well for them\nto raise money and pay off their enemy's claim, merely stipulating\nthat a rival brewery should not be established in Baslehurst, he\nswore an oath that he would raise no money for such a purpose. He\nwould have no dealings with so foul a traitor except through his\nlawyer, Honyman. \"But Honyman thinks you'd better settle with him,\"\npleaded Mrs. T. \"Then I'll go to another lawyer,\" said Tappitt. \"If\nHonyman won't stand to me I'll go to Sharpit and Longfite. They won't\ngive way as long as there's a leg to stand on.\" For the time Mrs.\nTappitt let this pass. She knew how useless it would be to tell her\nhusband at the present moment that Sharpit and Longfite would be the\nonly winners in such a contest as that of which he spoke. At the\npresent moment Mr. Tappitt felt a pride in his anger, and was almost\nhappy in the fury of his wrath; but Mrs. Tappitt was very wretched.\nIf that nasty girl, Rachel Ray, had not come in the way all might\nhave been well.\n\n\"He shan't eat another meal in this house,\" said Tappitt. \"I don't\ncare,\" he went on, when his wife pleaded that Luke Rowan must be\nadmitted to their table because of Mrs. Rowan and Mary. \"You can say\nwhat you like to them. They're welcome to stay if they like it, or\nwelcome to go; but he shan't put his feet under my mahogany again.\"\nOn this point, however, he was brought to relent before the hour\nof dinner. Baslehurst, his wife told him, would be against him if\nhe turned his guests away from his house hungry. If a fight was\nnecessary for them, it would be everything to them that Baslehurst\nshould be with them in the fight. It was therefore arranged that\nMrs. Tappitt should have a conversation with Mrs. Rowan after dinner,\nwhile the young people were out in the evening. \"He shan't sleep in\nthis house to-morrow,\" said Tappitt, riveting his assertion with very\nstrong language; and Mrs. Tappitt understood that her communications\nwere to be carried on upon that basis.\n\nAt three o'clock the Tappitts and Rowans all sat down to dinner. Mr.\nTappitt ate his meal in absolute silence; but the young people were\nfull of the ball, and the elder ladies were very gracious to each\nother. At such entertainments Paterfamilias is simply required to\nfind the provender and to carve it. If he does that satisfactorily,\nsilence on his part is not regarded as a great evil. Mrs. Tappitt\nknew that her husband's mood was not happy, and Martha may have\nremarked that all was not right with her father. To the others I am\ninclined to think his ill humour was a matter of indifference.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nLUKE ROWAN TAKES HIS TEA QUITE LIKE A STEADY YOUNG MAN.\n\n\nIt was the custom of the Miss Tappitts, during these long midsummer\ndays, to start upon their evening walk at about seven o'clock, the\nhour for the family gathering round the tea-table being fixed at six.\nBut, in accordance with the same custom, dinner at the brewery was\nusually eaten at one. At this immediate time with which we are now\ndealing, dinner had been postponed till three, out of compliment to\nMrs. Rowan, Mrs. Tappitt considering three o'clock more fashionable\nthan one; and consequently the afternoon habits of the family were\ndisarranged. Half-past seven, it was thought, would be a becoming\nhour for tea, and therefore the young ladies were driven to go out at\nfive o'clock, while the sun was still hot in the heavens.\n\n\"No,\" said Luke, in answer to his sister's invitation; \"I don't think\nI will mind walking to-day: you are all going so early.\" He was\nsitting at the moment after dinner with his glass of brewery port\nwine before him.\n\n\"The young ladies must be very unhappy that their hours can't be\nmade to suit you,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, and the tone of her voice was\nsarcastic and acid.\n\n\"I think we can do without him,\" said Cherry, laughing.\n\n\"Of course we can,\" said Augusta, who was not laughing.\n\n\"But you might as well come all the same,\" said Mary.\n\n\"There's metal more attractive somewhere else,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"I cannot bear to see so much fuss made with the young men,\" said\nMrs. Tappitt. \"We never did it when I was young. Did we, Mrs. Rowan?\"\n\n\"I don't think there's much change,\" said Mrs. Rowan; \"we used to be\nvery glad to get the young men when we could, and to do without them\nwhen we couldn't.\"\n\n\"And that's just the way with us,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Augusta.\n\nDuring all this time Mr. Tappitt spoke never a word. He also sipped\nhis glass of wine, and as he sipped it he brooded over his wrath.\nWho were these Rowans that they should have come about his house and\npremises, and forced everything out of its proper shape and position?\nThe young man sat there as though he were lord of everything,--so\nTappitt declared to himself; and his own wife was snubbed in her own\nparlour as soon as she opened her mouth. There was an uncomfortable\natmosphere of discord in the room, which gradually pervaded them all,\nand made even the girls feel that things were going wrong.\n\nMrs. Tappitt rose from her chair, and made a stiff bow across the\ntable to her guest, understanding that that was the proper way in\nwhich to effect a retreat into the drawing-room; whereupon Luke\nopened the door, and the ladies went. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs.\nTappitt very solemnly as she passed by him. Mrs. Rowan, going first,\nhad given him a loving little nod of recognition, and Mary had\npinched his arm. Martha uttered a word of thanks, intended for\nconciliation; Augusta passed him in silence with her nose in the air;\nand Cherry, as she went by, turned upon him a look of dismay. He\nreturned Cherry's look with a shake of his head, and both of them\nunderstood that things were going wrong.\n\n\"I don't think I'll take any more wine, sir,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"Do as you like,\" said Tappitt. \"It's there if you choose to take\nit.\"\n\n\"It seems to me, Mr. Tappitt, that you want to quarrel with me,\" said\nLuke.\n\n\"You can form your own opinion about that. I'm not bound to tell my\nmind to everybody.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; certainly not. But it's very unpleasant going on in that way\nin the same house. I'm thinking particularly of Mrs. Tappitt and the\ngirls.\"\n\n\"You needn't trouble yourself about them at all. You may leave me to\ntake care of them.\"\n\nLuke had not sat down since the ladies left the room, and now\ndetermined that he had better not do so. \"I think I'll say good\nafternoon,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"Good day to you,\" said Tappitt, with his face turned away, and his\neyes fixed upon one of the open windows.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Tappitt, if I have to say good-bye to you in that way in\nyour own house, of course it must be for the last time. I have not\nmeant to offend you, and I don't think I've given you ground for\noffence.\"\n\n\"You don't, don't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. If, unfortunately, there must be any disagreement\nbetween us about matters of business, I don't see why that should be\nbrought into private life.\"\n\n\"Look here, young man,\" said Tappitt, turning upon him. \"You lectured\nme in my counting-house this morning, and I don't intend that you\nshall lecture me here also. I'm drinking my own wine in my own\nparlour, and choose to drink it in peace and quietness.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; I will not disturb you much longer. Perhaps you will\nmake my apologies to Mrs. Tappitt, and tell her how much obliged I am\nby her hospitality, but that I will not trespass upon it any longer.\nI'll get a bed at the Dragon, and I'll write a line to my mother or\nsister.\" Then Luke left the room, took his hat up from the hall, and\nmade his way out of the house.\n\nHe had much to occupy his mind at the present moment. He felt that he\nwas being turned out of Mr. Tappitt's house, but would not much have\nregarded that if no one was concerned in it but Mr. Tappitt himself.\nHe had, however, been on very intimate terms with all the ladies of\nthe family; even for Mrs. Tappitt he had felt a friendship; and for\nthe girls--especially for Cherry--he had learned to entertain an easy\nbrotherly affection, which had not weighed much with him as it grew,\nbut which it was not in his nature to throw off without annoyance. He\nhad acknowledged to himself, as soon as he found himself among them,\nthat the Tappitts did not possess, in their ways and habits of life,\nquite all that he should desire in his dearest and most intimate\nfriends. I do not know that he had thought much of this; but he had\nfelt it. Nevertheless he had determined that he would like them. He\nintended to make his way in life as a tradesman, and boldly resolved\nthat he would not be above his trade. His mother sometimes reminded\nhim, with perhaps not the truest pride, that he was a gentleman.\nIn answer to this he had once or twice begged her to define the\nword, and then there had been some slight, very slight, disagreement\nbetween them. In the end the mother always gave way to the son; as\nto whom she believed that the sun shone with more special brilliancy\nfor him than for any other of God's creatures. Now, as he left the\nbrewery house, he remembered how intimate he had been with them all\nbut a few hours since, arranging matters for their ball, and giving\norders about the place as though he had belonged to the family. He\nhad allowed himself to be at home with them, and to be one of them.\nHe was by nature impulsive, and had thus fallen instantly into the\nintimacy which had been permitted to him. Now he was turned out of\nthe house; and as he walked across the churchyard to bespeak a bed\nfor himself at the inn, and write the necessary note to his sister,\nhe was melancholy and almost unhappy. He felt sure that he was right\nin his views regarding the business, and could not accuse himself\nof any fault in his manner of making them known to Mr. Tappitt; but,\nnevertheless, he was ill at ease with himself in that he had given\noffence. And with all these thoughts were mingled other thoughts\nas to Rachel Ray. He did not in the least imagine that any of the\nanger felt towards him at the brewery had been caused by his open\nadmiration of Rachel. It had never occurred to him that Mrs. Tappitt\nhad regarded him as a possible son-in-law, or that, having so\nregarded him, she could hold him in displeasure because he had failed\nto fall into her views. He had never regarded himself as being of\nvalue as a possible future husband, or entertained the idea that he\nwas a prize. He had taken hold in good faith of the Tappitt right\nhand which had been stretched out to him, and was now grieved that\nthat hand should be suddenly withdrawn.\n\nBut as he was impulsive, so also was he light-hearted, and when he\nhad chosen his bedroom and written the note to Mary, in which he\ndesired her to pack up his belongings and send them to him, he was\nalmost at ease as regarded that matter. Old Tappitt was, as he said\nto himself, an old ass, and if he chose to make that brewery business\na cause of quarrel no one could help it. Mary was bidden in the\nnote to say very civil things to Mrs. Tappitt; but, at the same\ntime, to speak out the truth boldly. \"Tell her,\" said he, \"that I am\nconstrained to leave the house because Mr. Tappitt and I cannot agree\nat the present moment about matters of business.\" When this was done\nhe looked at his watch, and started off on his walk to Bragg's End.\n\nIt has been said that Rowan had not made up his mind to ask Rachel\nto be his wife,--that he had not made up his mind on this matter,\nalthough he was going to Bragg's End in a mood which would very\nprobably bring him to such a conclusion. It will, I fear, be thought\nfrom this that he was light in purpose as well as light in heart; but\nI am not sure that he was open to any special animadversion of that\nnature. It is the way of men to carry on such affairs without any\ncomplete arrangement of their own plans or even wishes. He knew that\nhe admired Rachel and liked her. I doubt whether he had ever yet\ndeclared to himself that he loved her. I doubt whether he had done so\nwhen he started on that walk,--thinking it probable, however, that he\nhad persuaded himself of the fact before he reached the cottage door.\nHe had already, as we know, said words to Rachel which he should\nnot have said unless he intended to seek her as his wife;--he had\nspoken words and done things of that nature, being by no means\nperfect in all his ways. But he had so spoken and so acted without\npremeditation, and now was about to follow up those little words\nand little acts to their natural consequence,--also without much\npremeditation.\n\nRachel had told her mother, on her return from the ball, that Luke\nRowan had promised to call; and had offered to take herself off from\nthe cottage for the whole afternoon, if her mother thought it wrong\nthat she should see him. Mrs. Ray had never felt herself to be in\ngreater difficulty.\n\n\"I don't know that you ought to run away from him,\" said she: \"and\nbesides, where are you to go to?\"\n\nRachel said at once that if her absence were desirable she would find\nwhither to betake herself. \"I'd stay upstairs in my bedroom, for the\nmatter of that, mamma.\"\n\n\"He'd be sure to know it,\" said Mrs. Rowan, speaking of the young man\nas though he were much to be feared;--as indeed he was much feared by\nher.\n\n\"If you don't think I ought to go, perhaps it would be best that I\nshould stay,\" said Rachel, at last, speaking in a very low tone, but\nstill with some firmness in her voice.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know what I'm to say to him,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"That must depend upon what he says to you, mamma,\" said Rachel.\n\nAfter that there was no further talk of running away; but the morning\ndid not pass with them lightly or pleasantly. They made an effort\nto sit quietly at their work, and to talk over the doings at Mrs.\nTappitt's ball; but this coming of the young man threw its shadow,\nmore or less, over everything. They could not talk, or even look at\neach other, as they would have talked and looked had no such advent\nbeen expected. They dined at one, as was their custom, and after\ndinner I think it probable that each of them stood before her glass\nwith more care than she would have done on ordinary days. It was no\nordinary day, and Mrs. Ray certainly put on a clean cap.\n\n\"Will that collar do?\" she said to Rachel.\n\n\"Oh, yes, mamma,\" said Rachel, almost angrily. She also had taken her\nlittle precautions, but she could not endure to have such precautions\nacknowledged, even by a word.\n\nThe afternoon was very tedious. I don't know why Luke should have\nbeen expected exactly at three; but Mrs. Ray had, I think, made up\nher mind that he might be looked for at that time with the greatest\ncertainty. But at three he was sitting down to dinner, and even at\nhalf-past five had not as yet left his room at the \"Dragon.\"\n\n\"I suppose that we can't have tea till he's been,\" said Mrs. Ray,\njust at that hour; \"that is, if he does come at all.\"\n\nRachel felt that her mother was vexed, because she suspected that Mr.\nRowan was not about to keep his word.\n\n\"Don't let his coming make any difference, mamma,\" said Rachel. \"I\nwill go and get tea.\"\n\n\"Wait a few minutes longer, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\nIt was all very well for Rachel to beg that it might make \"no\ndifference.\" It did make a very great deal of difference.\n\n\"I think I'll go over and see Mrs. Sturt for a few minutes,\" said\nRachel, getting up.\n\n\"Pray don't, my dear,--pray don't; I should never know what to say to\nhim if he should come while you were away.\"\n\nSo Rachel again sat down.\n\nShe had just, for the second time, declared her intention of getting\ntea, having now resolved that no weakness on her mother's part should\nhinder her, when Mrs. Ray, from her seat near the window, saw the\nyoung man coming over the green. He was walking very slowly, swinging\na big stick as he came, and had taken himself altogether away from\nthe road, almost to the verge of Mrs. Sturt's farmyard. \"There he\nis,\" said Mrs. Ray, with a little start. Rachel, who was struggling\nhard to retain her composure, could not resist her impulse to jump\nup and look out upon the green from behind her mother's shoulder.\nBut she did this from some little distance inside the room, so\nthat no one might possibly see her from the green. \"Yes; there\nhe is, certainly,\" and, having thus identified their visitor,\nshe immediately sat down again. \"He's talking to Farmer Sturt's\nploughboy,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"He's asking where we live,\" said Rachel.\n\"He's never been here before.\"\n\nRowan, having completed his conversation with the ploughboy, which\nby the way seemed to Mrs. Ray to have been longer than was necessary\nfor its alleged purpose, came boldly across the green, and without\npausing for a moment made his way through the cottage gate. Mrs. Ray\ncaught her breath, and could not keep herself quite steady in her\nchair. Rachel, feeling that something must be done, got up from her\nseat and went quickly out into the passage. She knew that the front\ndoor was open, and she was prepared to meet Rowan in the hall.\n\n\"I told you I should call,\" said he. \"I hope you'll let me come in.\"\n\n\"Mamma will be very glad to see you,\" she said. Then she brought him\nup and introduced him. Mrs. Ray rose from her chair and curtseyed,\nmuttering something as to its being a long way for him to walk out\nthere to the cottage.\n\n\"I said I should come, Mrs. Ray, if Miss Ray did not make her\nappearance at the brewery in the morning. We had such a nice party,\nand of course one wants to talk it over.\"\n\n\"I hope Mrs. Tappitt is quite well after it,--and the girls,\" said\nRachel.\n\n\"Oh, yes. You know we kept it up two hours after you were gone. I\ncan't say Mr. Tappitt is quite right this morning.\"\n\n\"Is he ill?\" asked Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Well, no; not ill, I think, but I fancy that the party put him out\na little. Middle-aged gentlemen don't like to have all their things\npoked away anywhere. Ladies don't mind it, I fancy.\"\n\n\"Ladies know where to find them, as it is they who do the poking\naway,\" said Rachel. \"But I'm sorry about Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, too, for he's a good-natured sort of a man when he's\nnot put out. I say, Mrs. Ray, what a very pretty place you have got\nhere.\"\n\n\"We think so because we're proud of our flowers.\"\n\n\"I do almost all the gardening myself,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"There's nothing I like so much as a garden, only I never can\nremember the names of the flowers. They've got such grand names down\nhere. When I was a boy, in Warwickshire, they used to have nothing\nbut roses and sweetwilliams. One could remember them.\"\n\n\"We haven't got anything very grand here,\" said Rachel. Soon after\nthat they were sauntering out among the little paths and Rachel was\npicking flowers for him. She felt no difficulty in doing it, as her\nmother stood by her, though she would not for worlds have given him\neven a rose if they'd been alone.\n\n\"I wonder whether Mr. Rowan would come in and have some tea,\" said\nMrs. Ray.\n\n\"Oh, wouldn't I,\" said Rowan, \"if I were asked?\"\n\nRachel was highly delighted with her mother, not so much on account\nof her courtesy to their guest, as that she had shown herself equal\nto the occasion, and had behaved, in an unabashed manner, as a\nmistress of a house should do. Mrs. Ray had been in such dread of the\nyoung man's coming, that Rachel had feared she would be speechless.\nNow the ice was broken, and she would do very well. The merit,\nhowever, did not belong to Mrs. Ray, but to Rowan. He had the gift of\nmaking himself at home with people, and had done much towards winning\nthe widow's heart, when, after an interval of ten minutes, they two\nfollowed Rachel into the house. Rachel then had her hat on, and was\nabout to go over the green to the farmer's house. \"Mamma, I'll just\nrun over to Mrs. Sturt's for some cream,\" said she.\n\n\"Mayn't I go with you?\" said Rowan.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Rachel. \"You'd frighten Mrs. Sturt out of all\nher composure, and we should never get the cream.\" Then Rachel went\noff, and Rowan was again left with her mother.\n\nHe had seated himself at her request in an arm-chair, and there for a\nminute or two he sat silent. Mrs. Ray was busy with the tea-things,\nbut she suddenly felt that she was oppressed by the stranger's\npresence. While Rachel had been there, and even when they had been\nwalking among the flower-beds, she had been quite comfortable; but\nnow the knowledge that he was there, in the room with her, as he sat\nsilent in the chair, was becoming alarming. Had she been right to ask\nhim to stay for tea? He looked and spoke like a sheep; but then, was\nit not known to all the world that wolves dressed themselves often in\nthat guise, so that they might carry out their wicked purposes? Had\nshe not been imprudent? And then there was the immediate trouble of\nhis silence. What was she to say to him to break it? That trouble,\nhowever, was soon brought to an end by Rowan himself. \"Mrs. Ray,\"\nsaid he, \"I think your daughter is the nicest girl I ever saw in my\nlife.\"\n\nMrs. Ray instantly put down the tea-caddy which she had in her hand,\nand started, with a slight gasp in her throat, as though cold water\nhad been thrown over her. At the instant she said nothing. What was\nshe to say in answer to so violent a proposition?\n\n\"Upon my word I do,\" said Luke, who was too closely engaged with his\nown thoughts and his own feelings to pay much immediate attention\nto Mrs. Ray. \"It isn't only that she's good-looking, but there's\nsomething,--I don't know what it is,--but she's just the sort of\nperson I like. I told her I should come to-day, and I have come on\npurpose to say this to you. I hope you won't be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Pray, sir, don't say anything to her to turn her head.\"\n\n\"If I understand her, Mrs. Ray, it wouldn't be very easy to turn her\nhead. But suppose she has turned mine?\"\n\n\"Ah, no. Young gentlemen like you are in no danger of that sort of\nthing. But for a poor girl--\"\n\n\"I don't think you quite understand me, Mrs. Ray. I didn't mean\nanything about danger. My danger would be that she shouldn't care\ntwopence for me; and I don't suppose she ever will. But what I want\nto know is whether you would object to my coming over here and seeing\nher. I don't doubt but she might do much better.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"But I should like to have my chance.\"\n\n\"You've not said anything to her yet, Mr. Rowan?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I can't say I have. I meant to do so last night at the\nparty, but she wouldn't stay and hear me. I don't think she cares\nvery much about me, but I'll take my chance if you'll let me.\"\n\n\"Here she is,\" said Mrs. Ray. Then she again went to work with the\ntea-caddy, so that Rachel might be led to believe that nothing\nspecial had occurred in her absence. Nevertheless, had Rowan been\naway, every word would have been told to her.\n\n\"I hope you like clotted cream,\" said Rachel, taking off her hat.\nLuke declared that it was the one thing in all the world that he\nliked best, and that he had come into Devonshire with the express\nobject of feasting upon it all his life. \"Other Devonshire dainties\nwere not,\" he said, \"so much to his taste. He had another object in\nlife. He intended to put down cider.\"\n\n\"I beg you won't do anything of the kind,\" said Mrs. Ray, \"for I\nalways drink it at dinner.\" Then Rowan explained how that he was a\nbrewer, and that he looked upon it as his duty to put down so poor a\nbeverage as cider. The people of Devonshire, he averred, knew nothing\nof beer, and it was his ambition to teach them. Mrs. Ray grew eager\nin the defence of cider, and then they again became comfortable and\nhappy. \"I never heard of such a thing in my life,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\"What are the farmers to do with all their apple trees? It would be\nthe ruin of the whole country.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it can be done all at once,\" said Luke.\n\n\"Not even by Mr. Rowan,\" said Rachel.\n\nHe sat there for an hour after their tea, and Mrs. Ray had in truth\nbecome fond of him. When he spoke to Rachel he did so with the utmost\nrespect, and he seemed to be much more intimate with the mother than\nwith the daughter. Mrs. Ray's mind was laden with the burden of what\nhe had said in Rachel's absence, and with the knowledge that she\nwould have to discuss it when Rowan was gone; but she felt herself to\nbe happy while he remained, and had begun to hope that he would not\ngo quite yet. Rachel also was perfectly happy. She said very little,\nbut thought much of her different meetings with him,--of the arm in\nthe clouds, of the promise of his friendship, of her first dance, of\nthe little fraud by which he had secured her company at supper, and\nthen of those words he had spoken when he detained her after supper\nin the hall. She knew that she liked him well, but had feared that\nsuch liking might not be encouraged. But what could be nicer than\nthis,--to sit and listen to him in her mother's presence? Now she\nwas not afraid of him. Now she feared no one's eyes. Now she was\ndisturbed by no dread lest she might be sinning against rules of\npropriety. There was no Mrs. Tappitt by, to rebuke her with an angry\nlook.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan, I'm sure you need not go yet,\" she said, when he got\nup and sought his hat.\n\n\"Mr. Rowan, my dear, has got other things to do besides talking to\nus.\"\n\n\"Oh no, he has not. He can't go and brew after eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"When my brewery is really going, I mean to brew all night; but just\nat present I'm the idlest man in Baslehurst. When I go away I shall\nsit upon Cawston Bridge and smoke for an hour, till some of the\nBriggses of the town come and drive me away. But I won't trouble you\nany longer. Good night, Mrs. Ray.\"\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"And I may come and see you again?\"\n\nMrs. Ray was silent. \"I'm sure mamma will be very happy,\" said\nRachel.\n\n\"I want to hear her say so herself,\" said Luke.\n\nPoor woman! She felt that she was driven into a position from which\nany safe escape was quite impossible. She could not tell her guest\nthat he would not be welcome. She could not even pretend to speak to\nhim with cold words after having chatted with him so pleasantly, and\nwith such cordial good humour; and yet, were she to tell him that\nhe might come, she would be granting him permission to appear there\nas Rachel's lover. If Rachel had been away, she would have appealed\nto his mercy, and have thrown herself, in the spirit, on her knees\nbefore him. But she could not do this in Rachel's presence.\n\n\"I suppose business will prevent your coming so far out of town again\nvery soon.\"\n\nIt was a foolish subterfuge; a vain, silly attempt.\n\n\"Oh dear no,\" said he; \"I always walk somewhere every day, and you\nshall see me again before long.\" Then he turned to Rachel. \"Shall you\nbe at Mr. Tappitt's to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"I suppose I might as well tell you the truth and have done with it,\"\nsaid Luke, laughing. \"I hate secrets among friends. The fact is Mr.\nTappitt has turned me out of his house.\"\n\n\"Turned you out?\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan!\" said Rachel.\n\n\"That's the truth,\" said Rowan. \"It's about that horrid brewery. He\nmeans to be honest, and so do I. But in such matters it is so hard to\nknow what the right of each party really is. I fear we shall have to\ngo to law. But there's a lady coming in, so I'll tell you the rest of\nit to-morrow. I want you to know it all, Mrs. Ray, and to understand\nit too.\"\n\n\"A lady!\" said Mrs. Ray, looking out through the open window. \"Oh\ndear, if here isn't Dorothea!\"\n\nThen Rowan shook hands with them both, pressing Rachel's very warmly,\nclose under her mother's eyes; and as he went out of the house into\nthe garden, he passed Mrs. Prime on the walk, and took off his hat to\nher with great composure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nRACHEL RAY THINKS \"SHE DOES LIKE HIM.\"\n\n\nLuke Rowan's appearance at Mrs. Ray's tea-table, as described in\nthe last chapter, took place on Wednesday evening, and it may be\nremembered that on the morning of that same day Mrs. Prime had been\ncloseted with Mr. Prong in that gentleman's parlour. She had promised\nto give Mr. Prong an answer to his proposal on Saturday, and had\nconsequently settled herself down steadily to think of all that\nwas good and all that might be evil in such an arrangement as that\nsuggested to her. She wished much for legal advice, but she made up\nher mind that that was beyond her reach, was beyond her reach as a\npreliminary assistance. She knew enough of the laws of her country to\nenable her to be sure that, though she might accept the offer, her\nown money could be so tied up on her behalf that her husband could\nnot touch the principal of her wealth; but she did not know whether\nthings could be so settled that she might have in her own hands the\nspending of her income. By three o'clock on that day she thought that\nshe would accept Mr. Prong, if she could be satisfied on that head.\nHer position as a clergyman's wife,--a minister's wife she called\nit,--would be unexceptionable. The company of Miss Pucker was\ndistasteful. Solitude was not charming to her. And then, could she\nnot work harder as a married woman than in the position which she\nnow held? and also, could she not so work with increased power and\nincreased perseverance? At three o'clock she had almost made up her\nmind, but still she was sadly in need of counsel and information.\nThen it occurred to her that her mother might have some knowledge\nin this matter. In most respects her mother was not a woman of the\nworld; but it was just possible that in this difficulty her mother\nmight assist her. Her mother might at any rate ask of others, and\nthere was no one else whom she could trust to seek such information\nfor her. And if she did this thing she must tell her mother. It is\ntrue that she had quarrelled with them both at Bragg's End; but there\nare affairs in life which will ride over family quarrels and trample\nthem out, unless they be deeper and of longer standing than that\nbetween Mrs. Prime and Mrs. Ray. Therefore it was that she appeared\nat the cottage at Bragg's End just as Luke Rowan was leaving it.\n\nShe had entered upon the green with something of the olive-branch\nin her spirit, and before she reached the gate had determined that,\nas far as was within her power, all unkindness should be buried on\nthe present occasion; but when she saw Luke Rowan coming out of her\nmother's door, she was startled out of all her good feeling. She had\ntaught herself to look on Rowan as the personification of mischief,\nas the very mischief itself in regard to Rachel. She had lifted up\nher voice against him. She had left her home and torn herself from\nher family because it was not compatible with the rigour of her\nprinciples that any one known to her should be known to him also!\nBut she had hardly left her mother's house when this most pernicious\ncause of war was admitted to all the freedom of family intercourse!\nIt almost seemed to her that her mother must be a hypocrite. It was\nbut the other day that Mrs. Ray could not hear Luke Rowan's name\nmentioned without wholesome horror. But where was that wholesome\nhorror now? On Monday, Mrs. Prime had left the cottage; on Tuesday,\nRachel had gone to a ball, expressly to meet the young man! and on\nWednesday the young man was drinking tea at Bragg's End cottage! Mrs.\nPrime would have gone away without speaking a word to her mother or\nsister, had such retreat been possible.\n\nStately and solemn was the recognition which she accorded to Luke's\nsalutation, and then she walked on into the house.\n\n\"Oh, Dorothea!\" said her mother, and there was a tone almost of shame\nin Mrs. Ray's voice.\n\n\"We're so glad to see you, Dolly,\" said Rachel, and in Rachel's voice\nthere was no tone of shame. It was all just as it should not be!\n\n\"I did not mean to disturb you, mother, while you were entertaining\ncompany.\"\n\nMrs. Ray said nothing,--nothing at the moment; but Rachel took upon\nherself to answer her sister. \"You wouldn't have disturbed us at all,\neven if you had come a little sooner. But you are not too late for\ntea, if you'll have some.\"\n\n\"I've taken tea, thank you, two hours ago;\" and she spoke as though\nthere were much virtue in the distance of time at which she had\neaten and drunk, as compared with the existing rakish and dissipated\nappearance of her mother's tea-table. Tea-things about at eight\no'clock! It was all of a piece together.\n\n\"We are very glad to see you, at any rate,\" said Mrs. Ray; \"I was\nafraid you would not have come out to us at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would have been better if I had not come.\"\n\n\"I don't see that,\" said Rachel. \"I think it's much better. I hate\nquarrelling, and I hope you're going to stay now you are here.\"\n\n\"No, Rachel, I'm not going to stay. Mother, it is impossible I should\nsee that young man walking out of your house in that way without\nspeaking of it; although I'm well aware that my voice here goes for\nnothing now.\"\n\n\"That was Mr. Luke Rowan,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"I know very well who it was,\" said Mrs. Prime, shaking her head.\n\"Rachel will remember that I've seen him before.\"\n\n\"And you'll be likely to see him again if you stay here, Dolly,\" said\nRachel. This she said out of pure mischief,--that sort of mischief\nwhich her sister's rebuke was sure to engender.\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Mrs. Prime; \"whenever he pleases, no doubt. But I\nshall not see him. If you approve of it, mother, of course I can say\nnothing further,--nothing further than this, that I don't approve of\nsuch things.\"\n\n\"But what ails him that he shouldn't be a very good young man?\" says\nMrs. Ray. \"And if it was so that he was growing fond of Rachel, why\nshouldn't he? And if Rachel was to like him, I don't see why she\nshouldn't like somebody some day as well as other girls.\" Mrs. Ray\nhad been a little put beside herself or she would hardly have said\nso much in Rachel's presence. She had forgotten, probably, that\nRachel had not as yet been made acquainted with the nature of Rowan's\nproposal.\n\n\"Mamma, don't talk in that way. There's nothing of that kind,\" said\nRachel.\n\n\"I don't believe there is,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"I say there is then,\" said Mrs. Ray; \"and it's very ill-natured in\nyou, Dorothea, to speak and think in that way of your sister.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well. I see that I had better go back to Baslehurst at\nonce.\"\n\n\"So it is very ill-natured. I can't bear to have these sort of\nquarrels; but I must speak out for her. I believe he's a very good\nyoung man, with nothing bad about him at all, and he is welcome to\ncome here whenever he pleases. And as for Rachel, I believe she knows\nhow to mind herself as well as you did when you were her age; only\npoor Mr. Prime was come and gone at that time. And as for his not\nintending, he came out here just because he did intend, and only to\nask my permission. I didn't at first tell him he might because Rachel\nwas over at the farm getting the cream, and I thought she ought to be\nconsulted first; and if that's not straightforward and proper, I'm\nsure I don't know what is; and he having a business of his own, too,\nand able to maintain a wife to-morrow! And if a young man isn't to\nbe allowed to ask leave to see a young woman when he thinks he likes\nher, I for one don't know how young people are to get married at\nall.\" Then Mrs. Ray sat down, put her apron up to her eyes, and had a\ngreat cry.\n\nIt was a most eloquent speech, and I cannot say which of her\ndaughters was the most surprised by it. As to Rachel, it must be\nremembered that very much was communicated to her of which she had\nhitherto known nothing. Very much indeed, we may say, so much that\nit was of a nature to alter the whole tone and tenor of her life.\nThis young man of whom she had thought so much, and of whom she had\nbeen so much in dread,--fearing that her many thoughts of him were\nbecoming dangerous,--this young man who had interested her so warmly,\nhad come out to Bragg's End simply to get her mother's leave to pay\nhis court to her. And he had done this without saying a word to\nherself! There was something in this infinitely sweeter to her than\nwould have been any number of pretty speeches from himself. She had\nhitherto been angry with him, though liking him well; she had been\nangry with though almost loving him. She had not known why it was so,\nbut the cause had been this,--that he had seemed in their intercourse\ntogether, to have been deficient in that respect which she had a\nright to claim. But now all that sin was washed away by such a deed\nas this. As the meaning of her mother's words sank into her heart,\nand as she came to understand her mother's declaration that Luke\nRowan should be welcome to the cottage as her lover, her eyes became\nfull of tears, and the spirit of her animosity against her sister was\nquenched by the waters of her happiness.\n\nAnd Mrs. Prime was almost equally surprised, but was by no means\nequally delighted. Had the whole thing fallen out in a different way,\nshe would probably have looked on a marriage with Luke Rowan as good\nand salutary for her sister. At any rate, seeing that the world is\nas it is, and that all men cannot be hard-working ministers of the\nGospel, nor all women the wives of such or their assistants in godly\nministrations, she would not have taken upon herself to oppose such\na marriage. But as it was, she had resolved that Luke Rowan was a\nblack sheep; that he was pitch, not to be touched without defilement;\nthat he was, in short, a man to be regarded by religious people as\nanathema,--a thing accursed; and of that idea she was not able to\ndivest herself suddenly. Why had the young man walked about under the\nchurchyard elms at night? Why, if he were not wicked and abandoned,\ndid he wear that jaunty look,--that look which was so worldly? And,\nmoreover, he went to balls, and tempted others to do the like! In a\nword, he was a young man manifestly of that class which was esteemed\nby Mrs. Prime more dangerous than roaring lions. It was not possible\nthat she should give up her opinion merely because this roaring lion\nhad come out to her mother with a plausible story. Upon her at that\nmoment fell the necessity of forming a judgment to which it would be\nnecessary that she should hereafter abide. She must either at once\ngive in her adherence to the Rowan alliance; or else, if she opposed\nit, she must be prepared to cling to that opposition. She was aware\nthat some such decision was now required, and paused for a moment\nbefore she declared herself. But that moment only strengthened her\nverdict against Rachel's lover. Could any serious young man have\ntaken off his hat with the flippancy which had marked that action\non his part? Would not any serious young man, properly intent on\nmatrimonial prospects, have been subdued at such a moment to a more\nsolemn deportment? Mrs. Prime's verdict was still against him, and\nthat verdict she proceeded to pronounce.\n\n\"Oh, very well; then of course I shall interfere no further. I\nshouldn't have thought that Rachel's seeing him twice, in such a way\nas that, too--hiding under the churchyard trees!\"\n\n\"I wasn't hiding,\" said Rachel, \"and you've no business to say so.\"\nHer tears, however, prevented her from fighting her own battle\nmanfully, or with her usual courage.\n\n\"It looked very much like it, Rachel, at any rate. I should have\nthought that mother would have wished you to have known a great deal\nmore about any young man before she encouraged you to regard him in\nthat way, than you can possibly know of Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"But how are they to know each other, Dorothea, if they mustn't see\none another?\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"I have no doubt he knows how to dance very cleverly. As Rachel\nis being taught to live now, that may perhaps be the chief thing\nnecessary.\"\n\nThis blow did reach poor Mrs. Ray, who a week or two since would\ncertainly have agreed with her elder daughter in thinking that\ndancing was sinful. Into this difficulty, however, she had been\nbrought by Mr. Comfort's advice. \"But what else can she know of him?\"\ncontinued Mrs. Prime. \"He is able to maintain a wife you say,--and\nis that all that is necessary to consider in the choice of a husband,\nor is that the chief thing? Oh, mother, you should think of your\nresponsibility at such a time as this. It may be very pleasant for\nRachel to have this young man as her lover, very pleasant while it\nlasts. But what--what--what?\" Then Mrs. Prime was so much oppressed\nby the black weight of her own thoughts, that she was unable further\nto express them.\n\n\"I do think about it,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"I think about it more than\nanything else.\"\n\n\"And have you concluded that in this way you can best secure Rachel's\nwelfare? Oh, mother!\"\n\n\"He always goes to church on Sundays,\" said Rachel. \"I don't know why\nyou are to make him out so bad.\" This she said with her eyes fixed\nupon her mother, for it seemed to her that her mother was almost\nabout to yield.\n\nA good deal might be said in excuse for Mrs. Prime. She was not\nonly acting for the best in accordance with her own lights, but the\ndoctrine which she now preached was the doctrine which had been held\nby the inhabitants of the cottage at Bragg's End. The fault, if fault\nthere was, had been in the teaching under which had lived both Mrs.\nPrime and her mother. In their desire to live in accordance with that\nteaching, they had agreed to regard all the outer world, that is\nall the world except their world, as wicked and dangerous. They had\nnever conceived that in forming this judgment they were deficient in\ncharity; nor, indeed, were they conscious that they had formed any\nsuch judgment. In works of charity they had striven to be abundant,\nbut had taken simply the Dorcas view of that virtue. The younger and\nmore energetic woman had become sour in her temper under the _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_\nof this life, while the elder and weaker had retained her own\nsweetness partly because of her weakness. But who can say that either\nof them were other than good women,--good according to such lights\nas had been lit for their guidance? But now the younger was stanch\nto her old lessons while the elder was leaving them. The elder was\nleaving them, not by force of her own reason, but under the necessity\nof coming in contact with the world which was brought upon her by the\nvitality and instincts of her younger child. This difficulty she had\nsought to master, once and for ever, by a reference to her clergyman.\nWhat had been the result of that reference the reader already knows.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Mrs. Prime, very solemnly, \"is this young man such a\none as you would have chosen for Rachel's husband six months ago?\"\n\n\"I never wished to choose any man for her husband,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"I\ndon't think you ought to talk to me in that way, Dorothea.\"\n\n\"I don't know in what other way to talk to you. I cannot be\nindifferent on such a subject as this. When you tell me, and that\nbefore Rachel herself, that you have given this young man leave to\ncome and see her whenever he pleases.\"\n\n\"I never said anything of the kind, Dorothea.\"\n\n\"Did you not, mother? I am sure I understood you so.\"\n\n\"I said he had come to ask leave, and that I should be glad to see\nhim when he did come, but I didn't say anything of having told him\nso. I didn't tell him anything of the kind; did I, Rachel? But I know\nhe will come, and I don't see why he shouldn't. And if he does, I\ncan't turn him out. He took his tea here quite like a steady young\nman. He drank three large cups; and if, as Rachel says, he always\ngoes to church regularly, I don't know why we are to judge him and\nsay that he's anything out of the way.\"\n\n\"I have not judged him, mother.\"\n\nThen Rachel spoke out, and we may say that it was needful that she\nshould do so. This offering of her heart had been discussed in her\npresence in a manner that had been very painful to her, though the\npersons discussing it had been her own mother and her own sister. But\nin truth she had been so much affected by what had been said, there\nhad been so much in it that was first joyful and then painful to her,\nthat she had not hitherto been able to repress her emotions so as to\nacquire the power of much speech. But she had struggled, and now so\nfar succeeded as to be able to come to her mother's support.\n\n\"I don't know, mamma, why anybody should judge him yet; and as to\nwhat he has said to me, I'm sure no one has a right to judge him\nunkindly. Dolly has been very angry with me because she saw me\nspeaking to him in the churchyard, and has said that I was--hiding.\"\n\n\"I meant that he was hiding.\"\n\n\"Neither of us were hiding, and it was an unkind word, not like a\nsister. I have never had to hide from anybody. And as for--for--for\nliking Mr. Rowan after such words as that, I will not say anything\nabout it to anybody, except to mamma. If he were to ask me to be--his\nwife, I don't know what answer I should make,--not yet. But I shall\nnever listen to any one while mamma lives, if she wishes me not.\"\nThen she turned to her mother, and Mrs. Ray, who had before been\ndriven to doubt by Mrs. Prime's words, now again became strong in her\nresolution to cherish Rachel's lover.\n\n\"I don't believe she'll ever do anything to make me think that I\noughtn't to have trusted her,\" said Mrs. Ray, embracing Rachel and\nspeaking with her own eyes full of tears.\n\nIt now seemed to Mrs. Prime that there was nothing left for her but\nto go. In her eagerness about her sister's affairs, she had for a\nwhile forgotten her own; and now, as she again remembered the cause\nthat had brought her on the present occasion to Bragg's End, she felt\nthat she must return without accomplishing her object. After having\nsaid so much in reprobation of her sister's love-affair, it was\nhardly possible that she should tell the tale of her own. And yet\nher need was urgent. She had pledged herself to give Mr. Prong an\nanswer on Friday, and she could hardly bring herself to accept that\ngentleman's offer without first communicating with her mother on the\nsubject. Any such communication at the present moment was quite out\nof the question.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be better that I should go and leave you,\" she\nsaid. \"If I can do no good, I certainly don't want to do any harm. I\nwish that Rachel would have taken to what I think a better course of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Why, what have I done?\" said Rachel, turning round sharply.\n\n\"I mean about the Dorcas meetings.\"\n\n\"I don't like the women there;--that's why I haven't gone.\"\n\n\"I believe them to be good, praiseworthy, godly women. But it is\nuseless to talk about that now. Good-night, Rachel,\" and she gave her\nhand coldly to her sister. \"Good-night, mother; I wish I could see\nyou alone to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Come here for your dinner,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"No;--but if you would come to me in the morning I should take it\nkindly.\" This Mrs. Ray promised to do, and then Mrs. Prime walked\nback to Baslehurst.\n\nRachel, when her sister was gone, felt that there was much to be said\nbetween her and her mother. Mrs. Ray herself was so inconsequent in\nher mental workings, so shandy-pated if I may say so, that it did not\noccur to her that an entirely new view of Luke Rowan's purposes had\nbeen exposed to Rachel during this visit of Mrs. Prime's, or that\nanything had been said, which made a further explanation necessary.\nShe had, as it were, authorized Rachel to regard Rowan as her lover,\nand yet was not aware that she had done so. But Rachel had remembered\nevery word. She had resolved that she would permit herself to form\nno special intimacy with Luke Rowan without her mother's leave; but\nshe was also beginning to resolve that with her mother's leave, such\nintimacy would be very pleasant. Of this she was quite sure within\nher own heart,--that it should not be abandoned at her sister's\ninstigation.\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"I did not know that he had spoken to you in that\nway.\"\n\n\"In what way, Rachel?\" Mrs. Ray's voice was not quite pleasant. Now\nthat Mrs. Prime was gone, she would have been glad to have had the\ndangerous subject abandoned for a while.\n\n\"That he had asked you to let him come here, and that he had said\nthat about me.\"\n\n\"He did then,--while you were away at Mrs. Sturt's.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you give him?\"\n\n\"I didn't give him any answer. You came back, and I'm sure I was very\nglad that you did, for I shouldn't have known what to say to him.\"\n\n\"But what was it that he did say, mamma?--that is, if you don't think\nit wrong to tell me.\"\n\n\"I hardly know; but I don't suppose it can be wrong, for no young man\ncould have spoken nicer; and it made me happy to hear him,--so it\ndid, for the moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, do tell me!\" and Rachel kneeled down before her.\n\n\"Well;--he said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen.\"\n\n\"Did he, mamma?\" And the girl clung closer to her mother as she heard\nthe pleasant words.\n\n\"But I oughtn't to tell you such nonsense as that; and then he said\nthat he wanted to come out here and see you, and--and--and--; it is\nsimply this, that he meant to ask you to be his sweetheart, if I\nwould let him.\"\n\n\"And what did you say, mamma?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say anything because you came back.\"\n\n\"But you told Dolly that you would be glad to see him whenever he\nmight choose to come here.\"\n\n\"Did I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you said he was welcome to come whenever he pleased, and that\nyou believed him to be a very good young man.\"\n\n\"And so I do. Why should he be anything else?\"\n\n\"I don't say that he's anything else; but, mamma--\"\n\n\"Well, my dear.\"\n\n\"What shall I say to him if he does ask me that question? He has\ncalled me by my name two or three times, and spoken to me as though\nhe wanted me to like him. If he does say anything to me like that,\nwhat shall I answer?\"\n\n\"If you think you don't like him well enough, you must tell him so,\nof course.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I must.\" Then Rachel was silent for a minute or\ntwo. She had not as yet received the full answer which she desired.\nIn such an alternative as that which her mother had suggested, we\nmay say that she would have known how to frame her answer to the\nyoung man without any advice from her mother. But there was another\nalternative as to which she thought it well that she should have her\nmother's judgment and opinion. \"But, mamma, I think I do like him,\"\nsaid Rachel, burying her face.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't wonder at it,\" said Mrs. Ray, \"for I like him very\nmuch. He has a way with him so much nicer than most of the young men\nnow; and then, he's very well off, which, after all, must count for\nsomething. A young woman should never fall in love with a man who\ncan't earn his bread, not if he was ever so religious or steady. And\nhe's very good-looking, too. Good looks are only skin-deep I know,\nand they won't bring much comfort when sorrow comes; but I do own I\nlove to look on a young fellow with a sonsy face and a quick lively\nstep. Mr. Comfort seemed to think it would do very well if there was\nto be any such thing; and if he's not able to tell, I'm sure I don't\nknow who ought to be. And nothing could be fairer than his coming out\nhere and telling me first. There's so many of them are sly; but there\nwas nothing sly about that.\"\n\nIn this way, with many more rambling words, with many kisses also,\nand with some tears, Rachel Ray received from her mother permission\nto regard Luke Rowan as her lover.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMR. TAPPITT IN HIS COUNTING-HOUSE.\n\n\nLuke Rowan, when he left the cottage, walked quickly back across the\ngreen towards Baslehurst. He had sauntered out slowly on his road\nfrom the brewery to Bragg's End, being in doubt as to what he would\ndo when he reached his destination; but there was no longer room for\ndoubt now; he had said that to Rachel's mother which made any further\ndoubt impossible, and he was resolved that he would ask Rachel to be\nhis wife. He had spoken to Mrs. Ray of his intention in that respect\nas though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be\nrejected, and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth; but he\nwas eager, sanguine, and self-confident by nature, and though he was\nby no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom\nany young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved, he\ndid not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with\ndespair. He walked quickly home along the dusty road, picturing to\nhimself a happy prosperous future in Baslehurst, with Rachel as his\nwife, and the Tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income\npaid to old Tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery. That\nwas his present solution of the brewery difficulty. Tappitt was\ngrowing old, and it might be quite as well not only for himself, but\nfor the cause of humanity in Devonshire, that he should pass the\nremainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement\nfrom business affords. He did not desire Tappitt for a partner any\nmore than Tappitt desired him. Nevertheless he was determined to brew\nbeer, and was anxious to do so if possible on the spot where his\ngreat-uncle Bungall had commenced operations in that line.\n\nIt may be well to explain here that Rowan was not without good\nstanding-ground in his dispute with Tappitt. Old Bungall's will had\nsomewhat confused matters, as it is in the nature of wills to do;\nbut it had been Bungall's desire that his full share in the brewery\nshould go to his nephew after his widow's death, should he on dying\nleave a widow. Now it had happened that he had left a widow, and\nthat the widow had contrived to live longer than the nephew. She had\ndrawn an income of five hundred a year from the concern, by agreement\nbetween her and her lawyer and Tappitt and his lawyer; and Tappitt,\nwhen the elder Rowan, Bungall's nephew, died, had taught himself\nto believe that all the affairs of the brewery must now remain for\never in his own hands, unless he himself might choose to make other\nprovision. He knew that some property in the concern would pass away\nfrom him when the old lady died, but he had not acknowledged to\nhimself that young Rowan would inherit from his father all the rights\nwhich old Rowan would have possessed had he lived. Luke's father had\ngone into other walks of life, and had lived prosperously, leaving\nbehind him money for his widow, and money also for his children; and\nTappitt, when he found that there was a young man with a claim to\na partnership in his business, had been not only much annoyed, but\nsurprised also. He had been, as we have seen, persuaded to hold out\nthe right hand of friendship, and the left hand of the partnership to\nthe young man. He had thought that he might manage a young man from\nLondon who knew nothing of beer; and his wife had thought that the\nyoung man might probably like to take a wife as well as an income\nout of the concern; but, as we have seen, they had both been wrong\nin their hopes. Luke chose to manage the brewery instead of being\nmanaged; and had foolishly fallen in love with Rachel Ray instead of\ntaking Augusta Tappitt to himself as he should have done.\n\nThere was much certainly of harshness and cruelty in that idea of\nan opposition brewery in Baslehurst to be established in enmity to\nBungall and Tappitt, and to be so established with Bungall's money,\nand by Bungall's heir. But Luke, as he walked back to Baslehurst,\nthinking now of his beer and now of his love, declared to himself\nthat he wanted only his own. Let Tappitt deal justly with him in that\nmatter of the partnership, and he would deal even generously with\nTappitt. The concern gave an income of some fifteen hundred pounds,\nout of which Mrs. Bungall, as taking no share of the responsibility\nor work, had been allowed to have a third. He was informed by his\nlawyer that he was entitled to claim one-half of the whole concern.\nIf Tappitt would give in his adhesion to that villa arrangement, he\nshould still have his thousand a year for life, and Mrs. Tappitt\nafterwards should have due provision, and the girls should have all\nthat could fairly be claimed for them. Or, if the villa scheme could\nnot be carried out quite at present, he, Rowan, would do two shares\nof the work, and allow Tappitt to take two shares of the pay; but\nthen, in that case, he must be allowed scope for his improvements.\nGood beer should be brewed for the people of Baslehurst, and the\neyes of Devonshire should be opened. Pondering over all this, and\nresolving that he would speak out his mind openly to Rachel on the\nmorrow, Luke Rowan reached his inn.\n\n\"There's a lady, sir, up-stairs, as wishes to speak to you,\" said the\nwaiter.\n\n\"A lady?\"\n\n\"Quite elderly, sir,\" said the waiter, intending to put an end to any\nexcitement on Rowan's part.\n\n\"It's the gentleman's own mother,\" said the chambermaid, in a tone\nof reproof, \"and she's in number two sitting-room, private.\" So Luke\nwent to number two sitting-room, private, and there he found his\nmother waiting for him.\n\n\"This is very sad,\" she said, when their first greetings were over.\n\n\"About old Tappitt? yes, it is; but what could I do, mother? He's a\nstupid old man, and pig-headed. He would quarrel with me, so that\nI was obliged to leave the house. If you and Mary like to come into\nlodgings while you stay here, I can get rooms for you.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Rowan explained that she herself did not wish to come to\nany absolute or immediate rupture with Mrs. Tappitt. Of course their\nvisit would be shortened, but Mrs. Tappitt was disposed to be very\ncivil, as were the girls. Then Mrs. Rowan suggested whether there\nmight not be a reconciliation between Luke and the brewery family.\n\n\"But, mother, I have not quarrelled with the family.\"\n\n\"It comes to the same thing, Luke; does it not? Don't you think you\ncould say something civil to Mr. Tappitt, so as to--to bring him\nround again? He's older than you are, you know, Luke.\"\n\nRowan perceived at once that his mother was ranging herself on the\nTappitt side in the contest, and was therefore ready to fight with\nso much the more vigour. He was accustomed to yield to his mother in\nall little things, Mrs. Rowan being a woman who liked such yieldings;\nbut for some time past he had held his own against her in all greater\nmatters. Now and again, for an hour or so, she would show that she\nwas vexed; but her admiration for him was so genuine, and her love so\nstrong, that this vexation never endured, and Luke had been taught\nto think that his judgment was to be held supreme in all their joint\nconcerns. \"Yes, mother, he is older than I am; but I do not know that\nI can say anything particularly civil to him,--that is, more civil\nthan what I have said. The civility which he wants is the surrender\nof my rights. I can't be so civil as that.\"\n\n\"No, Luke, I should be the last to ask you to surrender any of your\nrights; you must be sure of that. But--oh, Luke, if what I hear is\ntrue I shall be so unhappy!\"\n\n\"And what have you heard, mother?\"\n\n\"I am afraid all this is not about the brewery altogether.\"\n\n\"But it is about the brewery altogether;--about that and about\nnothing else to any smallest extent. I don't at all know what you\nmean.\"\n\n\"Luke, is there no young lady in the case?\"\n\n\"Young lady! in what case;--in the case of my quarrel with old\nTappitt;--whether he and I have had a difference about a young lady?\"\n\n\"No, Luke; you know I don't mean that.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean, mother?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that you know too well. Is there not a young lady whom\nyou've met at Mrs. Tappitt's, and whom you--you pretend to admire?\"\n\n\"And suppose there is,--for the sake of the argument,--what has that\nto do with my difference with Mr. Tappitt?\" As Rowan asked this\nquestion some slight conception of the truth flashed across his mind;\nsome faint idea came home to him of the connecting link between his\nadmiration for Rachel Ray and Mr. Tappitt's animosity.\n\n\"But is it so, Luke?\" asked the anxious mother. \"I care much more\nabout that than I do about all the brewery put together. Nothing\nwould make me so wretched as to see you make a marriage that was\nbeneath you.\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall ever make you wretched in that way.\"\n\n\"And you tell me that there is nothing in this that I have\nheard;--nothing at all.\"\n\n\"No, by heavens!--I tell you no such thing. I do not know what you\nmay have heard. That you have heard falsehood and calumny I guess by\nyour speaking of a marriage that would be beneath me. But, as you\nthink it right to ask me, I will not deceive you by any subterfuge.\nIt is my purpose to ask a girl here in Baslehurst to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Then you have not asked her yet.\"\n\n\"You are cross-examining me very closely, mother. If I have not asked\nher I am bound to do so; not that any binding is necessary,--for\nwithout being bound I certainly should do so.\"\n\n\"And it is Miss Ray?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is Miss Ray.\"\n\n\"Oh, Luke, then indeed I shall be very wretched.\"\n\n\"Why so, mother? Have you heard anything against her?\"\n\n\"Against her! well; I will not say that, for I do not wish to say\nanything against any young woman. But do you know who she is, Luke;\nand who her mother is? They are quite poor people.\"\n\n\"And is that against them?\"\n\n\"Not against their moral character certainly, but it is against them\nin considering the expediency of a connection with them. You would\nhardly wish to marry out of your own station. I am told that the\nmother lives in a little cottage, quite in a humble sphere, and that\nthe sister--\"\n\n\"I intend to marry neither the mother nor the sister; but Rachel Ray\nI do intend to marry,--if she will have me. If I had been left to\nmyself I should not have told you of this till I had found myself to\nbe successful; as you have asked me I have not liked to deceive you.\nBut, mother, do not speak against her if you can say nothing worse of\nher than that she is poor.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand me, Luke.\"\n\n\"I hope so. I do not like to think that that objection should be made\nby you.\"\n\n\"Of course it is an objection, but it is not the one which I meant\nto make. There may be many a young lady whom it would be quite\nfitting that you should wish to marry even though she had not got a\nshilling. It would be much pleasanter of course that the lady should\nhave something, though I should never think of making any serious\nobjection about that. But what I should chiefly look to would be the\nyoung lady herself, and her position in life.\"\n\n\"The young lady herself would certainly be the main thing,\" said\nLuke.\n\n\"That's what I say;--the young lady herself and her position in life.\nHave you made any inquiries?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have;--and am almost ashamed of myself for doing so.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt Mrs. Ray is very respectable, but the sort of people\nwho are her friends are not your friends. Their most particular\nfriends are the farmer's family that lives near them.\"\n\n\"How was it then that Mrs. Cornbury took her to the party?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; I can explain that. And Mrs. Tappitt has told me how sorry\nshe is that people should have been deceived by what has occurred.\"\nLuke Rowan's brow grew black as Mrs. Tappitt's name was mentioned,\nbut he said nothing and his mother continued her speech. \"Her girls\nhave been very kind to Miss Ray, inviting her to walk with them and\nall that sort of thing, because of her being so much alone without\nany companions of her own.\"\n\n\"Oh, that has been it, has it? I thought she had the farmer's family\nout near where she lived.\"\n\n\"If you choose to listen to me, Luke, I shall be obliged to you, but\nif you take me up at every word in that way, of course I must leave\nyou.\" Then she paused, but as Luke said nothing she went on with\nher discourse. \"It was in that way that she came to know the Miss\nTappitts, and then one of them, the youngest I think, asked her to\ncome to the party. It was very indiscreet; but Mrs. Tappitt did not\nlike to go back from her daughter's word, and so the girl was allowed\nto come.\"\n\n\"And to make the blunder pass off easily, Mrs. Cornbury was induced\nto take her?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cornbury happened to be staying with her father, in whose\nparish they had lived for many years, and it certainly was very kind\nof her. But it has been an unfortunate mistake altogether. The poor\ngirl has for a moment been lifted out of her proper sphere, and,--as\nyou must have seen yourself,--hardly knew how to behave herself. It\nmade Mrs. Tappitt very unhappy.\"\n\nThis was more than Luke Rowan was able to bear. His anger was not\nagainst his own mother, but against the mistress of the brewery. It\nwas manifest that she had been maligning Rachel, and instigating his\nmother to take up the cudgels against her. And he was vexed also\nthat his mother had not perceived that Rachel held, or was entitled\nto hold, among women a much higher position than could be fairly\naccorded to Mrs. Tappitt. \"I do not care one straw for Mrs. Tappitt's\nunhappiness,\" he said; \"and as to Miss Ray's conduct at her house, I\ndo not think that there was anything in it that did not become her.\nI do not know what you mean, the least in the world; and I think you\nwould have no such idea yourself, if Mrs. Tappitt had not put it into\nyour head.\"\n\n\"You should not speak in that way to your mother, Luke.\"\n\n\"I must speak strongly when I am defending my wife,--as I hope she\nwill be. I never heard of anything in my life so little as this\nwoman's conduct! It is mean, paltry jealousy, and nothing else. You,\nas my mother, may think it better that I should not marry.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, I want you to marry.\"\n\n\"Then I will do as you want. Or you may think that I should find some\none with money, or with grand friends, or with a better connection.\nIt is natural that you should think like this. But why should she\nwant to belittle a young girl like Rachel Ray,--a girl that her own\ndaughters call their friend? I'll tell you why, mother. Because\nRachel Ray was admired and they were not.\"\n\n\"Is there anybody in Baslehurst that will say that she is your\nequal?\"\n\n\"I am not disposed to ask any one in Baslehurst just at present; and\nI would not advise any one in Baslehurst to volunteer an opinion to\nme on the subject. I intend that she shall be my equal,--my equal in\nevery respect, if I can make her so. I shall certainly ask her to\nbe my wife; and, mother, as my mind is positively made up on that\npoint,--as nothing on earth will alter me,--I hope you will teach\nyourself to think kindly of her. I should be very unhappy if my house\ncould not be your home when you may choose to make it so.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Rowan, much as she was accustomed to yield to her son, could\nnot bring herself to yield in this matter,--or, at least, not to\nyield with grace. She felt that the truth and wisdom all lay on her\nside in the argument, though she knew that she had lacked words in\nwhich to carry it on. She declared to herself that she was not at all\ninclined to despise anybody for living in a small cottage, or for\nbeing poor. She would have been delighted to be very civil to Mrs.\nRay herself, and could have patronized Rachel quite as kindly, though\nperhaps not so graciously, as Mrs. Cornbury had done. But it was a\ndifferent thing when her son came to think of making this young woman\nhis wife! Old Mrs. Cornbury would have been very sorry to see either\nof her sons make such an alliance. When anything so serious as\nmarriage was to be considered, it was only proper to remember that\nMrs. Ray lived in a cottage, and that farmer Sturt was her friend and\nneighbour. But to all this prudence and wisdom Luke would not listen\nat all, and at last Mrs. Rowan left him in dudgeon. Foolish and hasty\nas he was, he could, as she felt, talk better than she could; and\ntherefore she retreated, feeling that she had been worsted. \"I have\ndone my duty,\" said she, going away. \"I have warned you. Of course\nyou are your own master and can do as you please.\" Then she left him,\nrefusing his escort, and in the last fading light of the long summer\nevening, made her way back to the brewery.\n\nLuke's first impulse was to start off instantly to the cottage, and\nsettle the matter out of hand; but before he had taken up his hat\nfor this purpose he remembered that he could not very well call at\nBragg's End on such a mission at eleven o'clock at night; so he threw\nhimself back on the hotel sofa, and gave vent to his feelings against\nthe Tappitt family. He would make them understand that they were not\ngoing to master him. He had come down there disposed to do them all\nmanner of kindness,--to the extent even of greatly improving their\nfortunes by improving the brewing business,--and they had taken\nupon themselves to treat him as though he were a dependent. He did\nnot tell himself that a plot had been made to catch him for one of\nthe girls; but he accused them of jealousy, meanness, selfishness,\nand all those sins and abominations by which such a plot would be\nengendered. When, about an hour afterwards, he took himself off to\nbed, he was full of wrath, and determined to display his wrath early\non the morrow. As he prayed for forgiveness on condition that he\nforgave others, his conscience troubled him; but he gulped it down,\nand went on with his angry feelings till sleep came upon him.\n\nBut in the morning some of this bitterness had worn away. His last\nresolve overnight had been to go to the brewery before breakfast, at\nwhich period of the day Mr. Tappitt was always to be found for half\nan hour in his counting-house, and curtly tell the brewer that all\nfurther negotiations between them must be made by their respective\nlawyers; but as he was dressing, he reflected that Mr. Tappitt's\nposition was certainly one of difficulty, that amicable arrangements\nwould still be best if amicable arrangements were possible, and that\nsomething was due to the man who had for so many years been his\nuncle's partner. Mr. Tappitt, moreover, was not responsible for\nany of those evil things which had been said about Rachel by Mrs.\nTappitt. Therefore, priding himself somewhat on his charity, he\nentered Mr. Tappitt's office without the display of any anger on his\nface.\n\nThe brewer was standing with his back to the empty fireplace, with\nhis hands behind the tails of his coat, and his eyes fixed upon a\nletter which he had just read, and which lay open upon his desk.\nRowan advanced with his hand out, and Tappitt, hesitating a little as\nhe obeyed the summons, put out his own and just touched that of his\nvisitor; then hastily he resumed his position, with his arm behind\nhis coat-tail.\n\n\"I have come down,\" said Rowan, \"because I thought it might be well\nto have a little chat with you before breakfast.\"\n\nThe letter which lay open on the desk was from Rowan's lawyer in\nLondon, and contained that offer on Rowan's part of a thousand a year\nand retirement, to which Luke still looked as the most comfortable\ntermination of all their difficulties. Luke had almost forgotten that\nhe had, ten days since, absolutely instructed his lawyer to make the\noffer; but there was the offer made, and lying on Tappitt's table.\nTappitt had been considering it for the last five minutes, and every\nadditional moment had added to the enmity which he felt against\nRowan. Rowan, at twenty-five, no doubt regarded Tappitt, who was\nnearer sixty than fifty, as a very old man; but men of fifty-five\ndo not like to be so regarded, and are not anxious to be laid upon\nshelves by their juniors. And, moreover, where was Tappitt to find\nhis security for the thousand a year,--as he had not failed to remark\nto himself on his first glance over the lawyer's letter. Buy him\nout, indeed, and lay him on one side! He hated Rowan with all his\nheart;--and his hatred was much more bitter in its nature than\nthat which Rowan was capable of feeling for him. He remembered the\nchampagne; he remembered the young man's busy calling for things\nin his own house; he remembered the sneers against the beer, and\nthe want of respect with which his experience in the craft had been\ntreated. Buy him out! No; not as long as he had a five-pound note to\nspend, or a leg to stand upon. He was strong in his resolution now,\nand capable of strength, for Mrs. Tappitt was also on his side. Mrs.\nRowan had not quite kept her secret as to what had transpired at the\ninn, and Mrs. Tappitt was certain that Rachel Ray had succeeded. When\nTappitt declared that morning that he would fight it out to the last,\nMrs. T. applauded his courage.\n\n\"Oh! a little chat, is it?\" said Tappitt. \"About this letter that\nI've just got, I suppose;\" and he gave a contemptuous poke to the\nepistle with one of his hands.\n\n\"What letter?\" asked Rowan.\n\n\"Come now, young man, don't let us have any humbug and trickery,\nwhatever we may do. If there's anything I do hate, it's deceit.\"\n\nAll Rowan's wrath returned upon him instantly, redoubled and trebled\nin its energy. \"What do you mean, sir?\" said he. \"Who is trying to\ndeceive anybody? How dare you speak to me in such language as that?\"\n\n\"Now, look here, Mr. Rowan. This letter comes from your man in Craven\nStreet, as of course you know very well. You have chosen to put our\nbusiness in the hands of the lawyers, and in the hands of the lawyers\nit shall remain. I have been very wrong in attempting to have any\ndealings with you. I should have known what sort of a man you were\nbefore I let you put your foot in the concern. But I know enough of\nyou now, and, if you please, you'll keep yourself on the other side\nof those gates for the future. D'ye hear me? Unless you wish to be\nturned out by the men, don't you put your feet inside the brewery\npremises any more.\" And Tappitt's face as he uttered these words was\na face very unpleasant to behold.\n\nLuke was so astounded that he could not bethink himself at the moment\nof the most becoming words in which to answer his enemy. His first\nidea had prompted him to repudiate all present knowledge of the\nlawyer's letter, seeing that the lawyer's letter had been the ground\nof that charge against him of deceit. But having been thus kicked\nout,--kicked out as far as words could kick him, and threatened with\npersonal violence should those words not be obeyed, he found himself\nunable to go back to the lawyer's letter. \"I should like to see any\none of your men dare to touch me,\" said he.\n\n\"You shall see it very soon if you don't take yourself off,\" said\nTappitt. Luckily the men were gone to breakfast, and opportunity for\nviolence was wanting.\n\nLuke looked round, and then remembered that he and Tappitt were\nprobably alone in the place. \"Mr. Tappitt,\" said he, \"you're a very\nfoolish man.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Tappitt; \"very foolish not to give up my own\nbread, and my wife's and children's bread, to an adventurer like\nyou.\"\n\n\"I have endeavoured to treat you with kindness and also with honesty,\nand because you differ from me, as of course you have a right to do,\nyou think it best to insult me with all the Billingsgate you can\nmuster.\"\n\n\"If you don't go out of my counting-house, young man, I'll see if I\ncan't put you out myself;\" and Tappitt, in spite of his fifty-five\nyears, absolutely put his hand down upon the poker.\n\nThere is no personal encounter in which a young man is so sure to\ncome by the worst as in that with a much older man. This is so surely\nthe case that it ought to be considered cowardly in an old man to\nattack a young one. If an old man hit a young man over the head with\na walking-stick, what can the young man do, except run away to avoid\na second blow? Then the old man, if he be a wicked old man, as so\nmany are, tells all his friends that he has licked the young man.\nTappitt would certainly have acted in this way if the weapon in his\nhand had been a stick instead of a poker. But Tappitt, when he saw\nhis own poker in his own hand, was afraid of it. If a woman attack a\nman with a knife, the man will be held to have fought fairly, though\nhe shall have knocked her down in the encounter. And so also with an\nold man, if he take a poker instead of a stick, the world will refuse\nto him the advantage of his gray hairs. Some such an idea as this\ncame upon Tappitt--by instinct, and thus, though he still held the\npoker, he refrained his hand.\n\n\"The man must be mad this morning,\" said Rowan, standing firmly\nbefore him, with his two hands fixed upon his hips.\n\n\"Am I to send for the police?\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"For a mad-doctor, I should think,\" said Rowan. Then Tappitt turned\nround and rang a bell very violently. But as the bell was intended\nto summon some brewery servant who was now away at his breakfast, it\nproduced no result.\n\n\"But I have no intention of staying here against your wish, Mr.\nTappitt, whether you're mad or only foolish. This matter must of\ncourse be settled by the lawyers now, and I shall not again come on\nto these premises unless I acquire a legal right to do so as the\nowner of them.\" And then, having so spoken, Luke Rowan walked off.\n\nGrowling inwardly Tappitt deposited the poker within the upright\nfender, and thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets stood\nscowling at the door through which his enemy had gone. He knew that\nhe had been wrong; he knew that he had been very foolish. He was a\nman who had made his way upwards through the world with fair success,\nand had walked his way not without prudence. He had not been a man\nof violence, or prone to an illicit use of pokers. He had never been\nin difficulty for an assault; and had on his conscience not even\nthe blood of a bloody nose, or the crime of a blackened eye. He was\nhard-working and peaceable; had been churchwarden three times, and\nmayor of Baslehurst once. He was poor-law guardian and way-warden,\nand filled customarily the various offices of a steady good citizen.\nWhat had he to do with pokers, unless it were to extract heat\nfrom his coals? He was ashamed of himself as he stood scowling at\nthe door. One fault he perhaps had; and of that fault he had been\nruthlessly told by lips that should have been sealed for ever on\nsuch a subject. He brewed bad beer; and by whom had this been thrown\nin his teeth? By Bungall's nephew,--by Bungall's heir,--by him who\nclaimed to stand in Bungall's shoes within that establishment! Who\nhad taught him to brew beer--bad or good? Had it not been Bungall?\nAnd now, because in his old age he would not change these things, and\nruin himself in a vain attempt to make some beverage that should look\nbright to the eye, he was to be turned out of his place by this chip\nfrom the Bungall block, this stave out of one of Bungall's vats!\n\"_Ruat coelum, fiat justitia_,\" he said, as he walked forth to his\nown breakfast. He spoke to himself in other language, indeed, though\nthe Roman's sentiment was his own. \"I'll stand on my rights, though I\nhave to go into the poor-house.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nLUKE ROWAN PAYS A SECOND VISIT TO BRAGG'S END.\n\n\nEarly after breakfast on that morning,--that morning on which Tappitt\nhad for a moment thought of braining Luke Rowan with the poker,--Mrs.\nRay started from the cottage on her mission into Baslehurst. She was\ngoing to see her daughter, Mrs. Prime, at Miss Pucker's lodgings, and\nfelt sure that the object of her visit was to be a further discourse\non the danger of admitting that wolf Rowan into the sheepfold at\nBragg's End. She would willingly have avoided the conference had she\nbeen able to do so, knowing well that Mrs. Prime would get the better\nof her in words when called upon to talk without having Rachel at her\nback. And indeed she was not happy in her mind. It had been conceded\nat the cottage as an understood thing that Rachel was to have this\nman as her lover; but what, if after all, the man didn't mean to be a\nlover in the proper sense; and what, if so meaning, he should still\nturn out to be a lover of a bad sort,--a worldly, good-for-nothing,\nrakish lover? \"I wonder,\" says the wicked man in the play, \"I wonder\nany man alive would ever rear a daughter!\" Mrs. Ray knew nothing of\nthe play, and had she done so, she would not have repeated such a\nline. But the hardness of the task which Providence had allotted\nto her struck her very forcibly on this morning. Rachel was dearer\nto her than aught else in the world. For Rachel's happiness she\nwould have made any sacrifice. In Rachel's presence, and sweet\nsmile, and winning caresses was the chief delight of her existence.\nNevertheless, in these days the possession of Rachel was hardly a\nblessing to her. The responsibility was so great; and, worse than\nthat as regarded her own comfort, the doubts were so numerous; and\nthen, they recurred over and over again, as often as they were\nsettled!\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know what she can have to say to me.\" Mrs. Ray, as\nshe spoke, was tying on her bonnet, and Rachel was standing close to\nher with her light summer shawl.\n\n\"It will be the old story, mamma, I'm afraid; my terrible iniquity\nand backslidings, because I went to the ball, and because I won't go\nto Miss Pucker's. She'll want you to say that I shall go, or else be\nsent to bed without my supper.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Rachel. Dorothea knows very well that I can't make\nyou go.\" Mrs. Ray was wont to become mildly petulant when things went\nagainst her.\n\n\"But, mamma, you don't want me to go?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it's about Miss Pucker at all. It's about that other\nthing.\"\n\n\"You mean Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. I'm sure I don't know what's for the best. When she\ngets me to herself she does say such terrible things to me that it\nquite puts me in a heat to have to go to her. I don't think anybody\nought to say those sort of things to me except a clergyman, or a\nperson's parents, or a schoolmaster, or masters and mistresses,\nor such like.\" Rachel thought so too,--thought that at any rate a\ndaughter should not so speak to such a mother as was her mother; but\non that subject she said nothing.\n\n\"And I don't like going to that Miss Pucker's house,\" continued Mrs.\nRay. \"I'm sure I don't want her to come here. I wouldn't go, only I\nsaid that I would.\"\n\n\"I would go now, if I were you, mamma.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall go; haven't I got myself ready?\"\n\n\"But I would not let her go on in that way.\"\n\n\"That's very easy said, Rachel; but how am I to help it? I can't tell\nher to hold her tongue; and if I did, she wouldn't. If I am to go I\nmight as well start. I suppose there's cold lamb enough for dinner?\"\n\n\"Plenty, I should think.\"\n\n\"And if I find poultry cheap, I can bring a chicken home in my\nbasket, can't I?\" And so saying, with her mind full of various cares,\nMrs. Ray walked off to Baslehurst.\n\n\"I wonder when he'll come.\" Rachel, as she said or thought these\nwords, stood at the open door of the cottage looking after her mother\nas she made her way across the green. It was a delicious midsummer\nday, warm with the heat of the morning sun, but not yet oppressed\nwith the full blaze of its noonday rays. The air was alive with\nthe notes of birds, and the flowers were in their brightest beauty.\n\"I wonder when he'll come.\" None of those doubts which so harassed\nher mother troubled her mind. Other doubts there were. Could it be\npossible that he would like her well enough to wish to make her his\nown? Could it be that any one so bright, so prosperous in the world,\nso clever, so much above herself in all worldly advantages, should\ncome and seek her as his wife,--take her from their little cottage\nand lowly ways of life? When he had first said that he would come\nto Bragg's End, she declared to herself that it would be well that\nhe should see in how humble a way they lived. He would not call her\nRachel after that, she said to herself; or, if he did, he should\nlearn from her that she knew how to rebuke a man who dared to take\nadvantage of the humility of her position. He had come, and he had\nnot called her Rachel. He had come, and taking advantage of her\nmomentary absence, had spoken of her behind her back as a lover\nspeaks, and had told his love honestly to her mother. In Rachel's\nview of the matter no lover could have carried himself with better\ndecorum or with a sweeter grace; but because he had so done, she\nwould not hold him to be bound to her. He had been carried away by\nhis feelings too rapidly, and had not as yet known how poor and lowly\nthey were. He should still have opened to him a clear path backwards.\nThen if the path backwards were not to his mind, then in that case--.\nI am not sure that Rachel ever declared to herself in plain terms\nwhat in such case would happen; but she stood at the door as though\nshe was minded to stand there till he should appear upon the green.\n\n\"I wonder when he'll come.\" She had watched her mother's figure\ndisappear along the lane, and had plucked a flower or two to pieces\nbefore she returned within the house. He will not come till the\nevening, she determined,--till the evening, when his day's work in\nthe brewery would be over. Then she thought of the quarrel between\nhim and Tappitt, and wondered what it might be. She was quite sure\nthat Tappitt was wrong, and thought of him at once as an obstinate,\nfoolish, pigheaded old man. Yes; he would come to her, and she would\ntake care to be provided in that article of cream which he pretended\nto love so well. She would not have to run away again. But how lucky\non that previous evening had been that necessity, seeing that it had\ngiven opportunity for that great display of a lover's excellence on\nRowan's part. Having settled all this in her mind, she went into the\nhouse, and was beginning to think of her household work, when she\nheard a man's steps in the passage. She went at once out from the\nsitting-room, and encountered Luke Rowan at the door.\n\n\"How d'ye do?\" said he. \"Is Mrs. Ray at home?\"\n\n\"Mamma?--no. You must have met her on the road if you've come from\nBaslehurst.\"\n\n\"But I could not meet her on the road, because I've come across the\nfields.\"\n\n\"Oh!--that accounts for it.\"\n\n\"And she's away in Baslehurst, is she?\"\n\n\"She's gone in to see my sister, Mrs. Prime.\" Rachel, still standing\nat the door of the sitting-room, made no attempt of asking Rowan into\nthe parlour.\n\n\"And mayn't I come in?\" he said. Rachel was absolutely ignorant\nwhether, under such circumstances, she ought to allow him to enter.\nBut there he was, in the house, and at any rate she could not turn\nhim out.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to wait a long time if you wait for mamma,\"\nshe said, slightly making way, so that he obtained admittance. Was\nshe not a hypocrite? Did she not know that Mrs. Ray's absence would\nbe esteemed by him as a great gain, and not a loss? Why did she\nthus falsely talk of his waiting a long time? Dogs fight with their\nteeth, and horses with their heels; swans with their wings, and cats\nwith their claws;--so also do women use such weapons as nature has\nprovided for them.\n\n\"I came specially to see you,\" said he; \"not but what I should be\nvery glad to see your mother, too, if she comes back before I am\ngone. But I don't suppose she will, for you won't let me stay so long\nas that.\"\n\n\"Well, now you mention it, I don't think I shall, for I have got ever\nso many things to do;--the dinner to get ready, and the house to look\nafter.\" This she did by way of making him acquainted with her mode\nof life,--according to the plan which she had arranged for her own\nguidance.\n\nHe had come into the room, had put down his hat, and had got himself\nup to the window, so that his back was turned to her. \"Rachel,\" he\nsaid, turning round quickly, and speaking almost suddenly. Now he had\ncalled her Rachel again, but she could find at the moment no better\nway of answering him than by the same plaintive objection which she\nhad made before. \"You shouldn't call me by my name in that way, Mr.\nRowan; you know you shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Did your mother tell you what I said to her yesterday?\" he asked.\n\n\"What you said yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, when you were away across the green.\"\n\n\"What you said to mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes; I know she told you. I see it in your face. And I am glad she\ndid so. May I not call you Rachel now?\"\n\nAs they were placed the table was still between them, so that he was\ndebarred from making any outward sign of his presence as a lover.\nHe could not take her hand and press it. She stood perfectly silent,\nlooking down upon the table on which she leaned, and gave no answer\nto his question. \"May I not call you Rachel now?\" he said, repeating\nthe question.\n\nI hope it will be understood that Rachel was quite a novice at this\npiece of work which she now had in hand. It must be the case that\nvery many girls are not novices. A young lady who has rejected the\nfirst half-dozen suitors who have asked for her love, must probably\nfeel herself mistress of the occasion when she rejects the seventh,\nand will not be quite astray when she accepts the eighth. There\nare, moreover, young ladies who, though they may have rejected and\naccepted none, have had so wide an advantage in society as to be\nable, when the moment comes, to have their wits about them. But\nRachel had known nothing of what is called society, and had never\nbefore known either the trouble or the joy of being loved. So when\nthe question was pressed upon her, she trembled, and felt that her\nbreath was failing her. She had filled herself full of resolutions\nas to what she would do when this moment came,--as to how she would\nbehave and what words she would utter. But all that was gone from her\nnow. She could only stand still and tremble. Of course he might call\nher Rachel;--might call her what he pleased. To him, with his wider\nexperience, that now became manifest enough.\n\n\"You must give me leave for more than that, Rachel, if you would\nnot send me away wretched. You must let me call you my own.\" Then\nhe moved round the table towards her; and as he moved, though she\nretreated from him, she did not retreat with a step as rapid as his\nown. \"Rachel,\"--and he put out his hand to her--\"I want you to be my\nwife.\" She allowed the tips of her fingers to turn themselves toward\nhim, as though unable altogether to refuse the greeting which he\noffered her, but as she did so she turned away from him, and bent\ndown her head. She had heard all she wanted to hear. Why did he not\ngo away, and leave her to think of it? He had named to her the word\nso sacred between man and woman. He had said that he sought her for\nhis wife. What need was there that he should stay longer?\n\nHe got her hand in his, and then passed his arm round her waist.\n\"Say, love; say, Rachel;--shall it be so? Nay, but I will have an\nanswer from you. You shall look it to me, if you will not speak it;\"\nand he got his head round over her shoulder, as though to look into\nher eyes.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan; pray don't;--pray don't pull me.\"\n\n\"But, dearest, say a word to me. You must say some word. Can you\nlearn to love me, Rachel?\"\n\nLearn to love him! The lesson had come to her very easily. How was it\npossible, she had once thought, not to love him.\n\n\"Say a word to me,\" said Rowan, still struggling to look into her\nface; \"one word, and then I will let you go.\"\n\n\"What word?\"\n\n\"Say to me, 'Dear Luke, I will be your wife.'\"\n\nShe remained for a moment quite passive in his hands, trying to say\nit, but the words would not come. Of course she would be his wife.\nWhy need he trouble her further?\n\n\"Nay, but, Rachel, you shall speak, or I will stay with you here till\nyour mother comes, and she shall answer for you. If you had disliked\nme I think you would have said so.\"\n\n\"I don't dislike you,\" she whispered.\n\n\"And do you love me?\" She slightly bowed her head. \"And you will be\nmy wife?\" Again she went through the same little piece of acting.\n\"And I may call you Rachel now?\" In answer to this question she shook\nherself free from his slackened grasp, and escaped away across the\nroom.\n\n\"You cannot forbid me now. Come and sit down by me, for of course I\nhave got much to say to you. Come and sit down, and indeed I will not\ntrouble you again.\"\n\nThen she went to him very slowly, and sat with him, leaving her hand\nin his, listening to his words, and feeling in her heart the full\ndelight of having such a lover. Of the words that were then spoken,\nbut very few came from her lips; he told her all his story of the\nbrewery quarrel, and was very eloquent and droll in describing\nTappitt as he brandished the poker.\n\n\"And was he going to hit you with it?\" said Rachel, with all her eyes\nopen.\n\n\"Well, he didn't hit me,\" said Luke; \"but to look at him he seemed\nmad enough to do anything.\" Then he told her how at the present\nmoment he was living at the inn, and how it became necessary, from\nthis unfortunate quarrel, that he should go at once to London. \"But\nunder no circumstances would I have gone,\" said he, pressing her hand\nvery closely, \"without an answer from you.\"\n\n\"But you ought not to think of anything like that when you are in\nsuch trouble.\"\n\n\"Ought I not? Well, but I do, you see.\" Then he explained to her that\npart of his project consisted in his marrying her out of hand,--at\nonce. He would go up to London for a week or two, and then, coming\nback, be married in the course of the next month.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan, that would be impossible.\"\n\n\"You must not call me Mr. Rowan, or I shall call you Miss Ray.\"\n\n\"But indeed it would be impossible.\"\n\n\"Why impossible?\"\n\n\"Indeed it would. You can ask mamma;--or rather, you had better give\nover thinking of it. I haven't had time yet even to make up my mind\nwhat you are like.\"\n\n\"But you say that you love me.\"\n\n\"So I do, but I suppose I ought not; for I'm sure I don't know what\nyou are like yet. It seems to me that you're very fond of having\nyour own way, sir;--and so you ought,\" she added; \"but really you\ncan't have your own way in that. Nobody ever heard of such a thing.\nEverybody would think we were mad.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't care one straw for that.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I should,--a great many straws.\"\n\nHe sat there for two hours, telling her of all things appertaining to\nhimself. He explained to her that, irrespective of the brewery, he\nhad an income sufficient to support a wife,--\"though not enough to\nmake her a fine lady like Mrs. Cornbury,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can give me bread and cheese, it's as much as I have a right\nto expect,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"I have over four hundred a year,\" said he: and Rachel, hearing it,\nthought that he could indeed support a wife. Why should a man with\nfour hundred a year want to brew beer?\n\n\"But I have got nothing,\" said Rachel; \"not a farthing.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Rowan; \"it is my theory that unmarried girls\nnever ought to have anything. If they have, they ought to be\nconsidered as provided for, and then they shouldn't have husbands.\nAnd I rather think it would be better if men didn't have anything\neither, so that they might be forced to earn their bread. Only they\nwould want capital.\"\n\nRachel listened to it all with the greatest content, and most\nunalloyed happiness. She did not quite understand him, but she\ngathered from his words that her own poverty was not a reproach in\nhis eyes, and that he under no circumstances would have looked for\na wife with a fortune. Her happiness was unalloyed at all she heard\nfrom him, till at last he spoke of his mother.\n\n\"And does she dislike me?\" asked Rachel, with dismay.\n\n\"It isn't that she dislikes you, but she's staying with that Mrs.\nTappitt, who is furious against me because,--I suppose it's because\nof this brewery row. But indeed I can't understand it. A week ago I\nwas at home there; now I daren't show my nose in the house, and have\nbeen turned out of the brewery this morning with a poker.\"\n\n\"I hope it's nothing about me,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"How can it be about you?\"\n\n\"Because I thought Mrs. Tappitt looked at the ball as though--. But I\nsuppose it didn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"It ought to be a matter of perfect indifference whether it meant\nanything or not.\"\n\n\"But how can it be so about your mother? If this is ever to lead to\nanything--\"\n\n\"Lead to anything! What it will lead to is quite settled.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. But how could I become your wife if your\nmother did not wish it?\"\n\n\"Look here, Rachel; that's all very proper for a girl, I dare say.\nIf your mother thought I was not fit to be your husband, I won't say\nbut what you ought to take her word in such a matter. But it isn't\nso with a man. It will make me very unhappy if my mother cannot be\nfriends with my wife; but no threats of hers to that effect would\nprevent me from marrying, nor should they have any effect upon you.\nI'm my own master, and from the nature of things I must look out for\nmyself.\"\n\nThis was all very grand and masterful on Rowan's part, and might in\ntheory be true; but there was that in it which made Rachel uneasy,\nand gave to her love its first shade of trouble. She could not be\nquite happy as Luke's promised bride, if she knew that she would not\nbe welcomed to that place by Luke's mother. And then what right had\nshe to think it probable that Luke's mother would give her such a\nwelcome? At that first meeting, however, she said but little herself\non the subject. She had pledged to him her troth, and she would not\nattempt to go back from her pledge at the first appearance of a\ndifficulty. She would talk to her own mother, and perhaps his mother\nmight relent. But throughout it all there ran a feeling of dismay at\nthe idea of marrying a man whose mother would not willingly receive\nher as a daughter!\n\n\"But you must go,\" said she at last. \"Indeed you must. I have things\nto do, if you have nothing.\"\n\n\"I'm the idlest man in the world at the present moment. If you turn\nme out I can only go and sit at the inn.\"\n\n\"Then you must go and sit at the inn. If you stay any longer mamma\nwon't have any dinner.\"\n\n\"If that's so, of course I'll go. But I shall come back to tea.\"\n\nAs Rachel gave no positive refusal to this proposition, Rowan took\nhis departure on the understanding that he might return.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said he. \"When I come this evening I shall expect you to\nwalk with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, you will; and we will see the sun set again, and you will not\nrun from me this evening as though I were an ogre.\" As he spoke he\ntook her in his arms and held her, and kissed her before she had\ntime to escape from him. \"You're mine altogether now,\" said he, \"and\nnothing can sever us. God bless you, Rachel!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Luke,\" and then they parted.\n\nShe had told him to go, alleging her household duties as her ground\nfor dismissing him; but when he was gone she did not at once betake\nherself to her work. She sat on the seat which he had shared with\nher, thinking of the thing which she had done. She was now betrothed\nto this man as his wife, the only man towards whom her fancy had ever\nturned with the slightest preference. So far love for her had run\nvery smoothly. From her first meetings with him, on those evenings\nin which she had hardly spoken to him, his form had filled her eye,\nand his words had filled her mind. She had learned to love to see him\nbefore she understood what her heart was doing for her. Gradually,\nbut very quickly, all her vacant thoughts had been given to him, and\nhe had become the hero of her life. Now, almost before she had had\ntime to question herself on the matter, he was her affianced husband.\nIt had all been so quick and so very gracious that she seemed to\ntremble at her own good fortune. There was that one little cloud in\nthe sky,--that frown on his mother's brow; but now, in the first\nglow of her happiness, she could not bring herself to believe that\nthis cloud would bring a storm. So she sat there dreaming of her\nhappiness, and longing for her mother's return that she might tell\nit all;--that it might be talked of hour after hour, and that Luke's\nmerits might receive their fitting mention. Her mother was not a\nwoman who on such an occasion would stint the measure of her praise,\nor refuse her child the happiness of her sympathy.\n\nBut Rachel knew that she must not let the whole morning pass by in\nidle dreams, happy as those dreams were, and closely as they were\nallied to her waking life. After a while she jumped up with a start.\n\"I declare there will be nothing done. Mamma will want her dinner\nthough I'm ever so much going to be married.\"\n\nBut she had not been long on foot, or done much in preparation of the\ncold lamb which it was intended they should eat that day, before she\nheard her mother's footsteps on the gravel path. She ran out to the\nfront door full of her own news, though hardly knowing as yet in what\nwords she would tell it; but of her mother's news, of any tidings\nwhich there might be to tell as to that interview which had just\ntaken place in Baslehurst, Rachel did not think much. Nothing that\nDorothea could say would now be of moment. So at least Rachel\nflattered herself. And as for Dorothea and all her growlings, had\nthey not chiefly ended in this;--that the young man did not intend\nto present himself as a husband? But he had now done so in a manner\nwhich Rachel felt to be so satisfactory that even Dorothea's\ncriticism must be disarmed. So Rachel, as she met her mother, thought\nonly of the tale which she had to tell, and nothing of that which she\nwas to hear.\n\nBut Mrs. Ray was so full of her tale, was so conscious of the fact\nthat her tidings were entitled to the immediate and undivided\nattention of her daughter, and from their first greeting on the\ngravel path was so ready with her words, that Rachel, with all the\nstory of her happiness, was for a while obliterated.\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ray, \"I have such news for you!\"\n\n\"So have I, mamma, news for you,\" said Rachel, putting out her hand\nto her mother.\n\n\"I never was so warm in my life. Do let me get in; oh dear, oh\ndear! It's no good looking in the basket, for when I came away from\nDorothea I was too full of what I had just heard to think of buying\nanything.\"\n\n\"What have you heard, mamma?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope she'll be happy; I'm sure I do. But it's a great\nventure, a terribly great venture.\"\n\n\"What is it, mamma?\" And Rachel, though she could not yet think that\nher mother's budget could be equal in importance to her own, felt\nthat there was that which it was necessary that she should hear.\n\n\"Your sister is going to be married to Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"Dolly?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. It's a great venture; but if any woman can live\nhappy with such a man, she can do so. She's troubled about her\nmoney;--that's all.\"\n\n\"Marry Mr. Prong! I suppose she may if she likes. Oh dear! I can't\nthink I shall ever like him.\"\n\n\"I never spoke to him yet, so perhaps I oughtn't to say; but he\ndoesn't look a nice man to my eyes. But what are looks, my dear?\nThey're only skin deep; we ought all of us to remember that always,\nRachel; they're only skin deep; and if, as she says, she only wants\nto work in the vineyard, she won't mind his being so short. I dare\nsay he's honest;--at least I'm sure I hope he is.\"\n\n\"I should think he's honest, at any rate, or he wouldn't be what he\nis.\"\n\n\"There's some of them are so very fond of money;--that is, if all\nthat we hear is true. Perhaps he mayn't care about it; let us hope\nthat he doesn't; but if so he's a great exception. However, she means\nto have it tied up as close as possible, and I think she's right.\nWhere would she be if he was to go away some fine morning and leave\nher? You see, he's got nobody belonging to him. I own I do like\npeople who have got people belonging to them; you feel sure, in a\nsort of way, that they'll go on living in their own houses.\"\n\nRachel immediately reflected that Luke Rowan had people belonging to\nhim,--very nice people,--and that everybody knew who he was and from\nwhence he came.\n\n\"But she has quite made up her mind about it,\" continued Mrs. Ray;\n\"and when I saw that I didn't say very much against it. What was\nthe use? It isn't as though he wasn't quite respectable. He is a\nclergyman, you know, my dear, though he never was at any of the\nregular colleges; and he might be a bishop, just as much as if he had\nbeen; so they tell me. And I really don't think that she would ever\nhave come back to the cottage,--not unless you had promised to have\nbeen ruled by her in everything.\"\n\n\"I certainly shouldn't have done that;\" and Rachel, as she made this\nassurance with some little obstinacy in her voice, told herself that\nfor the future she meant to be ruled by a very different person\nindeed.\n\n\"No, I suppose not; and I'm sure I shouldn't have asked you, because\nI think it isn't the thing, dragging people away out of their own\nparishes, here and there, to anybody's church. And I told her that\nthough I would of course go and hear Mr. Prong now and then if she\nmarried him, I wouldn't leave Mr. Comfort, not as a regular thing.\nBut she didn't seem to mind that now, much as she used always to be\nsaying about it.\"\n\n\"And when is it to be, mamma?\"\n\n\"On Friday; that is, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\"\n\n\"That is, she's to go and tell him to-morrow that she means to take\nhim,--or he's to come to her at Miss Pucker's lodgings. It's not to\nbe wondered at when one sees Miss Pucker, really; and I'm not sure\nI'd not have done the same if I'd been living with her too; only I\ndon't think I ever should have begun. I think it's living with Miss\nPucker has made her do it; I do indeed, my dear. Well, now that I\nhave told you, I suppose I may as well go and get ready for dinner.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you, mamma. The potatoes are strained, and Kitty\ncan put the things on the table. Mamma\"--and now they were on the\nstairs,--\"I've got something to tell also.\"\n\nWe'll leave Mrs. Ray to eat her dinner, and Rachel to tell her story,\nmerely adding a word to say that the mother did not stint the measure\nof her praise, or refuse her child the happiness of her sympathy.\nThat evening was probably the happiest of Rachel's existence,\nalthough its full proportions of joy were marred by an unforeseen\noccurrence. At four o'clock a note came from Rowan to his \"Dearest\nRachel,\" saying that he had been called away by telegraph to London\nabout that \"horrid brewery business.\" He would write from there. But\nRachel was almost as happy without him, talking about him, as she\nwould have been in his presence, listening to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nMATERNAL ELOQUENCE.\n\n\nOn the Friday morning there was a solemn conference at the brewery\nbetween Mrs. Tappitt and Mrs. Rowan. Mrs. Rowan found herself to be\nin some difficulty as to the line of action which she ought to take,\nand the alliances which she ought to form. She was passionately\nattached to her son, and for Mrs. Tappitt she had no strong liking.\nBut then she was very averse to this proposed marriage with Rachel\nRay, and was willing for a while to make a treaty with Mrs. Tappitt,\noffensive and defensive, as against her own son, if by doing so she\ncould put a stop to so outrageous a proceeding on his part. He had\nseen her before he started for London, and had told her both the\noccurrences of the day. He had described to her how Tappitt had\nturned him out of the brewery, poker in hand, and how, in consequence\nof Tappitt's \"pig-headed obstinacy,\" it was now necessary that their\njoint affairs should be set right by the hand of the law. He had then\ntold her also that there was no longer any room for doubt or argument\nbetween them as regarding Rachel. He had gone out to Bragg's End\nthat morning, had made his offer, and had been accepted. His mother\ntherefore would see,--so he surmised,--that, as any opposition on her\npart must now be futile, she might as well take Rachel to her heart\nat once. He went so far as to propose to her that she should go over\nto Rachel in his absence,--\"it would be very gracious if you could do\nit to-morrow, mother,\" he said,--and go through that little process\nof taking her future daughter-in-law to her heart. But in answer\nto this Mrs. Rowan said very little. She said very little, but she\nlooked much. \"My dear, I cannot move so quick as you do; I am older.\nI am afraid, however, that you have been rash.\" He said something,\nas on such occasions young men do, as to his privilege of choosing\nfor himself, as to his knowing what wife would suit him, as to\nhis contempt for money, and as to the fact,--\"the undoubted fact,\"\nas he declared it,--and in that declaration I am prepared to go\nhand-in-hand with him,--that Rachel Ray was a lady. But he was\nclear-headed enough to perceive that his mother did not intend to\nagree with him. \"When we are married she will come round,\" he said\nto himself, and then he took himself off by the night mail train to\nLondon.\n\nUnder these circumstances Mrs. Rowan felt that her only chance\nof carrying on the battle would be by means of a treaty with Mrs.\nTappitt. Had the affair of the brewery stood alone, Mrs. Rowan would\nhave ranged herself loyally on the side of her son. She would have\nresented the uplifting of that poker, and shown her resentment by an\nimmediate withdrawal from the brewery. She would have said a word or\ntwo,--a stately word or two,--as to the justice of her son's cause,\nand have carried herself and her daughter off to the inn. As things\nwere now, her visit to the brewery must no doubt be curtailed in its\nduration; but in the mean time might not a blow be struck against\nthat foolish matrimonial project,--an opportune blow, and by the aid\nof Mrs. Tappitt? Therefore on that Friday morning, when Mr. Prong\nwas listening with enraptured ears to Mrs. Prime's acceptance of\nhis suit,--under certain pecuniary conditions,--Mrs. Rowan and Mrs.\nTappitt were sitting in conference at the brewery.\n\nThey agreed together at that meeting that Rachel Ray was the head and\nfront of the whole offence, the source of all the evil done and to\nbe done, and the one great sinner in the matter. It was clear to Mrs.\nRowan that Rachel could have no just pretensions to look for such a\nlover or such a husband as her son; and it was equally clear to Mrs.\nTappitt that she could have had no right to seek a lover or a husband\nout of the brewery. If Rachel Ray had not been there all might have\ngone smoothly for both of them. Mrs. Tappitt did not, perhaps, argue\nvery logically as to the brewery business, or attempt to show either\nto herself or to her ally that Luke Rowan would have made himself an\nagreeable partner if he had kept himself free from all love vagaries;\nbut she was filled with an indefinite woman's idea that the mischief,\nwhich she felt, had been done by Rachel Ray, and that against Rachel\nand Rachel's pretensions her hand should be turned.\n\nThey resolved therefore that they would go out together and call at\nthe cottage. Mrs. Tappitt knew, from long neighbourhood, of what\nstuff Mrs. Ray was made. \"A very good sort of woman,\" she said\nto Mrs. Rowan, \"and not at all headstrong and perverse like her\ndaughter. If we find the young lady there we must ask her mamma to\nsee us alone.\" To this proposition Mrs. Rowan assented, not eagerly,\nbut with a slow, measured, dignified assent, feeling that she was\nderogating somewhat from her own position in allowing herself to\nbe led by such a one as Mrs. Tappitt. It was needful that on this\noccasion she should act with Mrs. Tappitt and connect herself\nwith the Tappitt interests; but all this she did with an air that\ndistinctly claimed for herself a personal superiority. If Mrs.\nTappitt did not perceive and understand this, it was her fault, and\nnot Mrs. Rowan's.\n\nAt two o'clock they stepped into a fly at the brewery door and had\nthemselves driven out to Bragg's End.\n\n\"Mamma, there's a carriage,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"It can't be coming here,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"But it is; it's the fly from the Dragon. I know it by the man's\nwhite hat. And, oh dear, there's Mrs. Rowan and Mrs. Tappitt! Mamma,\nI shall go away.\" And Rachel, without another word, escaped out into\nthe garden. She escaped, utterly heedless of her mother's little weak\nprayer that she would remain. She went away quickly, so that not a\nskirt of her dress might be visible. She felt instantly, by instinct,\nthat these two women had come out there especially as her enemies,\nas upsetters of her happiness, as opponents of her one great hope in\nlife; and she knew that she could not fight her battle with them face\nto face. She could not herself maintain her love stoutly and declare\nher intention of keeping her lover to his word; and yet she did\nintend to maintain her love, not doubting that he would be true to\nhis word without any effort on her part. Her mother would make a\nvery poor fight,--of that she was quite well aware. It would have\nbeen well if her mother could have run away also. But, as that could\nnot be, her mother must be left to succumb, and the fight must be\ncarried on afterwards as best it might. The two ladies remained\nat the cottage for about an hour, and during that time Rachel was\nsequestered in the garden, hardening her heart against all enemies to\nher love. If Luke would only stand by her, she would certainly stand\nby him.\n\nThere was a good deal of ceremony between the three ladies when they\nfirst found themselves together in Mrs. Ray's parlour. Mrs. Rowan\nand Mrs. Tappitt were large and stiff in their draperies, and did\nnot fit themselves easily in among Mrs. Ray's small belongings;\nand they were stately in their demeanour, conscious that they were\nvisiting an inferior, and conscious also that they were there on no\nfriendly mission. But the interview was commenced with a show of much\ncivility. Mrs. Tappitt introduced Mrs. Rowan in due form, and Mrs.\nRowan made her little bow, if with some self-asserting supremacy,\nstill with fitting courtesy. Mrs. Ray hoped that Mrs. Tappitt and\nthe young ladies were quite well, and then there was a short silence,\nvery oppressive to Mrs. Ray, but refreshing rather than otherwise to\nMrs. Rowan. It gave a proper business aspect to the visit, and paved\nthe way for serious words.\n\n\"Miss Rachel is out, I suppose,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Yes, she is out,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"But she's about the place\nsomewhere, if you want to see her.\" This she added in her weakness,\nnot knowing how she was to sustain the weight of such an interview\nalone.\n\n\"Perhaps it is as well that she should be away just at present,\" said\nMrs. Rowan, firmly but mildly.\n\n\"Quite as well,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, as firmly, but less mildly.\n\n\"Because we wish to say a few words to you, Mrs. Ray,\" said Mrs.\nRowan.\n\n\"That is what has brought us out so early,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. It\nwas only half-past two now, and company visiting was never done at\nBaslehurst till after three. \"We want to say a few words to you, Mrs.\nRay, about a very serious matter. I'm sure you know how glad I've\nalways been to see Rachel with my girls, and I had her at our party\nthe other night, you know. It isn't likely therefore that I should be\ndisposed to say anything unkind about her.\"\n\n\"At any rate not to me, I hope,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Not to anybody. Indeed I'm not given to say unkind things about\npeople. No one in Baslehurst would give me that character. But the\nfact is, Mrs. Ray--\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Tappitt, you'll allow me,\" said Mrs. Rowan. \"He's my\nson.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, certainly;--that is, if you wish it,\" said Mrs. Tappitt,\ndrawing herself up in her chair; \"but I thought that perhaps, as I\nknew Miss Ray so well--\"\n\n\"If you don't mind, Mrs. Tappitt--\" and Mrs. Rowan, as she again took\nthe words out of her friend's mouth, smiled upon her with a smile of\ngreat efficacy.\n\n\"Oh, dear, certainly not,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, acknowledging by her\nconcession the superiority of Mrs. Rowan's nature.\n\n\"I believe you are aware, Mrs. Ray,\" said Mrs. Rowan, \"that Mr. Luke\nRowan is my son.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm aware of that.\"\n\n\"And I'm afraid you must be aware also that there have been\nsome,--some,--some talkings as it were, between him and your\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. The truth is, ma'am, that he has offered himself to my\ngirl, and that she has accepted him. Whether it's for good or for\nbad, the open truth is the best, Mrs. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"Truth is truth,\" said Mrs. Tappitt; \"and deception is not truth.\"\n\n\"I didn't think it had gone anything so far as that,\" said Mrs.\nRowan,--who at the moment, perhaps, forgot that deception is not\ntruth; \"and in saying that he has actually offered himself, you may\nperhaps,--without meaning it, of course,--be attributing a more\npositive significance to his word than he has intended.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said Mrs. Ray very solemnly. \"That would be a very sad\nthing for my poor girl. But I think, Mrs. Rowan, you had better ask\nhim. If he says he didn't intend it, of course there will be an end\nof it, as far as Rachel is concerned.\"\n\n\"I can't ask him just at present,\" said Mrs. Rowan, \"because he has\ngone up to London. He went away yesterday afternoon, and there's no\nsaying when he may be in Baslehurst again.\"\n\n\"If ever--,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, very solemnly. \"Perhaps he has not\ntold you, Mrs. Ray, that that partnership between him and Mr. T. is\nall over.\"\n\n\"He did tell us that there had been words between him and Mr.\nTappitt.\"\n\n\"Words indeed!\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"And therefore it isn't so easy to ask him,\" said Mrs. Rowan,\nignoring Mrs. Tappitt and the partnership. \"But of course, Mrs. Ray,\nour object in this matter must be the same. We both wish to see our\nchildren happy and respectable.\" Mrs. Rowan, as she said this, put\ngreat emphasis on the last word.\n\n\"As to my girl, I've no fear whatever but what she'll be\nrespectable,\" said Mrs. Ray, with more heat than Mrs. Tappitt had\nthought her to possess.\n\n\"No doubt; no doubt. But what I'm coming to is this, Mrs. Ray; here\nhas this boy of mine been behaving foolishly to your daughter, as\nyoung men will do. It may be that he has really said something to her\nof the kind you suppose--\"\n\n\"Said something to her! Why, ma'am, he came out here and asked my\npermission to pay his addresses to her, which I didn't answer because\njust at that moment Rachel came in from Farmer Sturt's opposite--\"\n\n\"Farmer Sturt's!\" said Mrs. Tappitt to Mrs. Rowan, in an under voice\nand nodding her head. Whereupon Mrs. Rowan nodded her head also. One\nof the great accusations made against Mrs. Ray had been that she\nlived on the Farmer Sturt level, and not on the Tappitt level;--much\nless on the Rowan level.\n\n\"Yes,--from Farmer Sturt's,\" continued Mrs. Ray, not at all\nunderstanding this by-play. \"So I didn't give him any answer at all.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't encourage him,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"I don't know about that; but at any rate he encouraged himself, for\nhe came again the next morning when I was in Baslehurst.\"\n\n\"I hope Miss Rachel didn't know he was coming in your absence,\" said\nMrs. Rowan.\n\n\"It would look so sly;--wouldn't it?\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"No, she didn't, and she isn't sly at all. If she had known anything\nshe would have told me. I know what my girl is, Mrs. Rowan, and I\ncan depend on her.\" Mrs. Ray's courage was up, and she was inclined\nto fight bravely, but she was sadly impeded by tears, which she now\nfound it impossible to control.\n\n\"I'm sure it isn't my wish to distress you,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"It does distress me very much, then, for anybody to say that Rachel\nis sly.\"\n\n\"I said I hoped she wasn't sly,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"I heard what you said,\" continued Mrs. Ray; \"and I don't see why you\nshould be speaking against Rachel in that way. The young man isn't\nyour son.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, \"indeed he's not;--nor yet he ain't Mr.\nTappitt's partner.\"\n\n\"Nor wishes to be,\" said Mrs. Rowan, with a toss of her head. It was\na thousand pities that Mrs. Ray had not her wits enough about her to\nhave fanned into a fire of battle the embers which glowed hot between\nher two enemies. Had she done so they might probably have been made\nto consume each other,--to her great comfort. \"Nor wishes to be!\"\nThen Mrs. Rowan paused a moment, and Mrs. Tappitt assumed a smile\nwhich was intended to indicate incredulity. \"But Mrs. Ray,\" continued\nMrs. Rowan, \"that is neither here nor there. Luke Rowan is my son,\nand I certainly have a right to speak. Such a marriage as this would\nbe very imprudent on his part, and very disagreeable to me. From the\nway in which things have turned out it's not likely that he'll settle\nhimself at Baslehurst.\"\n\n\"The most unlikely thing in the world,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"I don't\nsuppose he'll ever show himself in Baslehurst again.\"\n\n\"As for showing himself, Mrs. Tappitt, my son will never be ashamed\nof showing himself anywhere.\"\n\n\"But he won't have any call to come to Baslehurst, Mrs. Rowan. That's\nwhat I mean.\"\n\n\"If he's a gentleman of his word, as I take him to be,\" said Mrs.\nRay, \"he'll have a great call to show himself. He never can have\nintended to come out here, and speak to her in that way, and ask her\nto marry him, and then never to come back and see her any more! I\nwouldn't believe it of him, not though his own mother said it!\"\n\n\"I don't say anything,\" said Mrs. Rowan, who felt that her position\nwas one of some difficulty. \"But we all do know that in affairs of\nthat kind young men do allow themselves to go great lengths. And the\ngreater lengths they go, Mrs. Ray, the more particular the young\nladies ought to be.\"\n\n\"But what's a young lady to do? How's she to know whether a young\nman is in earnest, or whether he's only going lengths, as you call\nit?\" Mrs. Ray's eyes were still moist with tears; and, I grieve to\nsay that though, as far as immediate words are concerned, she was\nfighting Rachel's battle not badly, still the blows of the enemy were\ntaking effect upon her. She was beginning to wish that Luke Rowan had\nnever been seen, or his name heard, at Bragg's End.\n\n\"I think it's quite understood in the world,\" said Mrs. Rowan, \"that\na young lady is not to take a gentleman at his first word.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"We've all of us daughters,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"Yes, all of us,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"That's what makes it so fitting\nthat we should discuss this matter together in a friendly feeling.\"\n\n\"My son is a very good young man,--a very good young man indeed.\"\n\n\"But a little hasty, perhaps,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"If you'll allow me, Mrs. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, Mrs. Rowan.\"\n\n\"A very good young man indeed; and I don't think it at all probable\nthat in such a matter as this he will act in opposition to his\nmother's wishes. He has his way to make in the world.\"\n\n\"Which will never be in the brewery line,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"He has his way to make in the world,\" continued Mrs. Rowan, with\nmuch severity; \"and if he marries in four or five years' time, that\nwill be quite as soon as he ought to think of doing. I'm sure you\nwill agree with me, Mrs. Ray, that long engagements are very bad,\nparticularly for the lady.\"\n\n\"He wanted to be married next month,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Ah, yes; that shows that the whole thing couldn't come to much. If\nthere was an engagement at all, it must be a very long one. Years\nmust roll by.\" From the artistic manner in which Mrs. Rowan allowed\nher voice to dwell upon the words which signified duration of space,\nany hope of a marriage between Luke and Rachel seemed to be put off\nat any rate to some future century. \"Years must roll by, and we all\nknow what that means. The lady dies of a broken heart, while the\ngentleman lives in a bachelor's rooms, and dines always at his club.\nNobody can wish such a state of things as that, Mrs. Ray.\"\n\n\"I knew a girl who was engaged for seven years,\" said Mrs. Tappitt,\n\"and she wore herself to a thread-paper,--so she did. And then he\nmarried his housekeeper after all.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner see my girl make up her mind to be an old maid than let\nher have a long engagement,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"And so would I, my girls, all three. If anybody comes, I say to\nthem, 'Let your papa see them. He'll know what's the meaning of it.'\nIt don't do for young girls to manage those things all themselves.\nNot but what I think my girls have almost as much wit about them as I\nhave. I won't mention any names, but there's a young man about here\nas well-to-do as any young man in the South Hams, but Cherry won't as\nmuch as look at him.\" Mrs. Rowan again tossed her head. She felt her\nmisfortune in being burthened with such a colleague as Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"What is it you want me to do, Mrs. Rowan?\" asked Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"I want you and your daughter, who I am sure is a very nice young\nlady, and good-looking too,--\"\n\n\"Oh, quite so,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"I want you both to understand that this little thing should be\nallowed to drop. If my boy has done anything foolish I'm here to\napologize for him. He isn't the first that has been foolish, and\nI'm afraid he won't be the last. But it can't be believed, Mrs. Ray,\nthat marriages should be run up in this thoughtless sort of way. In\nthe first place the young people don't know anything of each other;\nabsolutely nothing at all. And then,--but I'm sure I don't want to\ninsist on any differences that there may be in their positions in\nlife. Only you must be aware of this, Mrs. Ray, that such a marriage\nas that would be very injurious to a young man like my son Luke.\"\n\n\"My child wouldn't wish to injure anybody.\"\n\n\"And therefore, of course, she won't think any more about it. All I\nwant from you is that you should promise me that.\"\n\n\"If Rachel will only just say that,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, \"my daughters\nwill be as happy to see her out walking with them as ever.\"\n\n\"Rachel has had quite enough of such walking, Mrs. Tappitt; quite\nenough.\"\n\n\"If harm has come of it, it hasn't been the fault of my girls,\" said\nMrs. Tappitt.\n\nThen there was a pause among the three ladies, and it appeared that\nMrs. Rowan was waiting for Mrs. Ray's answer. But Mrs. Ray did not\nknow what answer she should make. She was already disposed to regard\nthe coming of Luke Rowan to Baslehurst as a curse rather than a\nblessing. She felt all but convinced that Fate would be against\nher and hers in that matter. She had ever been afraid of young men,\nbelieving them to be dangerous, bringers of trouble into families,\nroaring lions sometimes, and often wolves in sheep's clothing. Since\nshe had first heard of Luke Rowan in connection with her daughter she\nhad been trembling. If she could have acted in accordance with her\nown feelings at this moment, she would have begged that Luke Rowan's\nname might never again be mentioned in her presence. It would be\nbetter for them, she thought, to bear what had already come upon\nthem, than to run further risk. But she could not give any answer\nto Mrs. Rowan without consulting Rachel;--she could not at least\ngive any such answer as that contemplated without doing so. She had\nsanctioned Rachel's love, and could not now undertake to oppose it.\nRachel had probably been deceived, and must bear her misfortune. But,\nas the question stood at present between her and her daughter, she\ncould not at once accede to Mrs. Rowan's views in the matter. \"I will\ntalk to Rachel,\" she said.\n\n\"Give her my kindest respects,\" said Mrs. Rowan; \"and pray make her\nunderstand that I wouldn't interfere if I didn't think it was for\nboth their advantages. Good-bye, Mrs. Ray.\" And Mrs. Rowan got up.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Ray,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, putting out her hand. \"Give\nmy love to Rachel. I hope that we shall be good friends yet, for all\nthat has come and gone.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Ray would not accept Mrs. Tappitt's hand, nor would she\nvouchsafe any answer to Mrs. Tappitt's amenities. \"Good-bye, ma'am,\"\nshe said to Mrs. Rowan. \"I suppose you mean to do the best you can by\nyour own child.\"\n\n\"And by yours too,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"If so, I can only say that you must think very badly of your own\nson. Good-bye, ma'am.\" Then Mrs. Ray curtseyed them out,--not without\na certain amount of dignity, although her eyes were red with tears,\nand her whole body trembling with dismay.\n\nVery little was said in the fly between the two ladies on their\nway back to the brewery, nor did Mrs. Rowan remain very long as a\nvisitor at Mrs. Tappitt's house. She had found herself compelled by\ncircumstances to take a part inimical to Mrs. Ray, but she felt in\nher heart a much stronger animosity to Mrs. Tappitt. With Mrs. Ray\nshe could have been very friendly, only for that disastrous love\naffair; but with Mrs. Tappitt she could not again put herself into\npleasant relations. I must point out how sadly unfortunate it was\nthat Mrs. Ray had not known how to fan that flame of anger to her own\nand her daughter's advantage.\n\n\"Well, mamma,\" said Rachel, returning to the room as soon as she\nheard the wheels of the fly in motion upon the road across the green.\nShe found her mother in tears,--hardly able to speak because of her\nsobs. \"Never mind it, mamma: of course I know the kind of things they\nhave been saying. It was what I expected. Never mind it.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, you will be broken-hearted.\"\n\n\"Broken-hearted! Why?\"\n\n\"I know you will. Now that you have learned to love him, you'll never\nbear to lose him.\"\n\n\"And must I lose him?\"\n\n\"She says so. She says that he doesn't mean it, and that it's all\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"I don't believe her. Nothing shall make me believe that, mamma.\"\n\n\"She says it would be ruinous to all his prospects, especially just\nnow when he has quarrelled about this brewery.\"\n\n\"Ruinous to him!\"\n\n\"His mother says so.\"\n\n\"I will never wish him to do anything that shall be ruinous to\nhimself; never;--not though I were broken-hearted, as you call it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is it, Rachel, my darling; I wish he had not come here.\"\n\nRachel went away across the room and looked out of the window upon\nthe green. There she stood in silence for a few minutes while her\nmother was wiping her eyes and suppressing her sobs. Tears also had\nrun down Rachel's cheeks; but they were silent tears, few in number\nand very salt. \"I cannot bring myself to wish that yet,\" said she.\n\n\"But he has gone away, and what can you do if he does not come\nagain?\"\n\n\"Do! Oh, I can do nothing. I could do nothing, even though he were\nhere in Baslehurst every day of his life. If I once thought that he\ndidn't wish me--to--be--his wife, I should not want to do anything.\nBut, mamma, I can't believe it of him. It was only yesterday that he\nwas here.\"\n\n\"They say that young men don't care what they say in that way\nnow-a-days.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it of him, mamma; his manner is so steadfast, and\nhis voice sounds so true.\"\n\n\"But then she is so terribly against it.\"\n\nThen again they were silent for a while, after which Rachel ended\nthe conversation. \"It is clear, at any rate, that you and I can do\nnothing, mamma. If she expects me to say that I will give him up, she\nis mistaken. Give him up! I couldn't give him up, without being false\nto him. I don't think I'll ever be false to him. If he's false to me,\nthen,--then, I must bear it. Mamma, don't say anything to Dolly about\nthis just at present.\" In answer to which request Mrs. Ray promised\nthat she would not at present say anything to Mrs. Prime about Mrs.\nRowan's visit.\n\nThe following day and the Sunday were not passed in much happiness by\nthe two ladies at Bragg's End. Tidings reached them that Mrs. Rowan\nand her daughter were going to London on the Monday, but no letter\ncame to them from Luke. By the Monday morning Mrs. Ray had quite made\nup her mind that Luke Rowan was lost to them for ever, and Rachel\nhad already become worn with care. During that Saturday and Sunday\nnothing was seen of Mrs. Prime at Bragg's End.\n\n\nEND OF VOL.

CONCLUSION.\n\n\n\n\nRACHEL RAY\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nRACHEL RAY'S FIRST LOVE-LETTER.\n\n\nOn the Monday evening, after tea, Mrs. Prime came out to the cottage.\nIt was that Monday on which Mrs. Rowan and her daughter had left\nBaslehurst and had followed Luke up to London. She came out and sat\nwith her mother and sister for about an hour, restraining herself\nwith much discretion from the saying of disagreeable things about her\nsister's lover. She had heard that the Rowans had gone away, and she\nhad also heard that it was probable that they would be no more seen\nin Baslehurst. Mr. Prong had given it as his opinion that Luke would\nnot trouble them again by his personal appearance among them. Under\nthese circumstances Mrs. Prime had thought that she might spare her\nsister. Nor had she said much about her own love affairs. She had\nnever mentioned Mr. Prong's offer in Rachel's presence; nor did she\ndo so now. As long as Rachel remained in the room the conversation\nwas very innocent and very uninteresting. For a few minutes the two\nwidows were alone together, and then Mrs. Prime gave her mother to\nunderstand that things were not yet quite arranged between herself\nand Mr. Prong.\n\n\"You see, mother,\" said Mrs. Prime, \"as this money has been committed\nto my charge, I do not think it can be right to let it go altogether\nout of my own hands.\"\n\nIn answer to this Mrs. Ray had uttered a word or two agreeing with\nher daughter. She was afraid to say much against Mr. Prong;--was\nafraid, indeed, to express any very strong opinion about this\nproposed marriage; but in her heart she would have been delighted to\nhear that the Prong alliance was to be abandoned. There was nothing\nin Mr. Prong to recommend him to Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"And is she going to marry him?\" Rachel asked, as soon as her sister\nwas gone.\n\n\"There's nothing settled as yet. Dorothea wants to keep her money in\nher own hands.\"\n\n\"I don't think that can be right. If a woman is married the money\nshould belong to the husband.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's what Mr. Prong thinks;--at any rate, there's\nnothing settled. It seems to me that we know so little about him. He\nmight go away any day to Australia, you know.\"\n\n\"And did she say anything about--Mr. Rowan?\"\n\n\"Not a word, my dear.\"\n\nAnd that was all that was then said about Luke even between Rachel\nand her mother. How could they speak about him? Mrs. Ray also\nbelieved that he would be no more seen in Baslehurst; and Rachel\nwas well aware that such was her mother's belief, although it had\nnever been expressed. What could be said between them now,--or ever\nafterwards,--unless, indeed, Rowan should take some steps to make it\nnecessary that his doings should be discussed?\n\nThe Tuesday passed and the Wednesday, without any sign from the young\nman; and during these two sad days nothing was said at the cottage.\nOn that Wednesday his name was absolutely not mentioned between them,\nalthough each of them was thinking of him throughout the day. Mrs.\nRay had now become almost sure that he had obeyed his mother's\nbehests, and had resolved not to trouble himself about Rachel any\nfurther; and Rachel herself had become frightened if not despondent.\nCould it be that all this should have passed over her and that it\nshould mean nothing?--that the man should have been standing there,\nonly three or four days since, in that very room, with his arm round\nher waist, begging for her love, and calling her his wife;--and that\nall of it should have no meaning? Nothing amazed her so much as her\nmother's firm belief in such an ending to such an affair. What must\nbe her mother's thoughts about men and women in general if she could\nexpect such conduct from Luke Rowan,--and yet not think of him as one\nwhose falsehood was marvellous in its falseness!\n\nBut on the Thursday morning there came a letter from Luke addressed\nto Rachel. On that morning Mrs. Ray was up when the postman passed by\nthe cottage, and though Rachel took the letter from the man's hand\nherself, she did not open it till she had shown it to her mother.\n\n\"Of course it's from him,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Ray, taking the unopened letter in her hand\nand looking at it. She spoke almost in a whisper, as though there\nwere something terrible in the coming of the letter.\n\n\"Is it not odd,\" said Rachel, \"but I never saw his handwriting\nbefore? I shall know it now for ever and ever.\" She also spoke in a\nwhisper, and still held the letter as though she dreaded to open it.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"If you think you ought to read it first, mamma, you may.\"\n\n\"No, Rachel. It is your letter. I do not wish you to imagine that I\ndistrust you.\"\n\nThen Rachel sat herself down, and with extreme care opened the\nenvelope. The letter, which she read to herself very slowly, was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   MY OWN DEAREST RACHEL,\n\n   It seems so nice having to write to you, though it would\n   be much nicer if I could see you and be sitting with you\n   at this moment at the churchyard stile. That is the spot\n   in all Baslehurst that I like the best. I ought to have\n   written sooner, I know, and you will have been very angry\n   with me; but I have had to go down into Northamptonshire\n   to settle some affairs as to my father's property, so that\n   I have been almost living in railway carriages ever since\n   I saw you. I am resolved about the brewery business more\n   firmly than ever, and as it seems that \"T\"\n\n--Mrs. Tappitt would occasionally so designate her lord, and her\ndoing so had been a joke between Luke and Rachel,--\n\n   will not come to reason without a lawsuit, I must scrape\n   together all the capital I have, or I shall be fifty years\n   old before I can begin. He is a pig-headed old fool, and\n   I shall be driven to ruin him and all his family. I would\n   have done,--and still would do,--anything for him in\n   kindness; but if he drives me to go to law to get what\n   is as much my own as his share is his own, I will build\n   another brewery just under his nose. All this will require\n   money, and therefore I have to run about and get my\n   affairs settled.\n\n   But this is a nice love-letter,--is it not? However, you\n   must take me as I am. Just now I have beer in my very\n   soul. The grand object of my ambition is to stand and\n   be fumigated by the smoke of my own vats. It is a fat,\n   prosperous, money-making business, and one in which there\n   is a clear line between right and wrong. No man brews bad\n   beer without knowing it,--or sells short measure. Whether\n   the fatness and the honesty can go together;--that is the\n   problem I want to solve.\n\n   You see I write to you exactly as if you were a man\n   friend, and not my own dear sweet girl. But I am a very\n   bad hand at love-making. I considered that that was all\n   done when you nodded your head over my arm in token that\n   you consented to be my wife. It was a very little nod, but\n   it binds you as fast as a score of oaths. And now I think\n   I have a right to talk to you about all my affairs, and\n   expect you at once to get up the price of malt and hops in\n   Devonshire. I told you, you remember, that you should be\n   my friend, and now I mean to have my own way.\n\n   You must tell me exactly what my mother has been doing and\n   saying at the cottage. I cannot quite make it out from\n   what she says, but I fear that she has been interfering\n   where she had no business, and making a goose of herself.\n   She has got an idea into her head that I ought to make a\n   good bargain in matrimony, and sell myself at the highest\n   price going in the market;--that I ought to get money,\n   or if not money, family connexion. I'm very fond of\n   money,--as is everybody, only people are such liars,--but\n   then I like it to be my own; and as to what people call\n   connexion, I have no words to tell you how I despise it.\n   If I know myself I should never have chosen a woman as my\n   companion for life who was not a lady; but I have not the\n   remotest wish to become second cousin by marriage to a\n   baronet's grandmother. I have told my mother all this, and\n   that you and I have settled the matter together; but I see\n   that she trusts to something that she has said or done\n   herself to upset our settling. Of course, what she has\n   said can have no effect on you. She has a right to speak\n   to me, but she has none to speak to you;--not as yet. But\n   she is the best woman in the world, and as soon as ever we\n   are married you will find that she will receive you with\n   open arms.\n\n   You know I spoke of our being married in August. I wish it\n   could have been so. If we could have settled it when I was\n   at Bragg's End, it might have been done. I don't, however,\n   mean to scold you, though it was your fault. But as it is,\n   it must now be put off till after Christmas. I won't name\n   a day yet for seeing you, because I couldn't well go to\n   Baslehurst without putting myself into Tappitt's way. My\n   lawyer says I had better not go to Baslehurst just at\n   present. Of course you will write to me constantly,--to\n   my address here; say, twice a week at least. And I shall\n   expect you to tell me everything that goes on. Give my\n   kind love to your mother.\n\n   Yours, dearest Rachel,\n   Most affectionately,\n\n   LUKE ROWAN.\n\n\nThe letter was not quite what Rachel had expected, but, nevertheless,\nshe thought it very nice. She had never received a love-letter\nbefore, and probably had never read one,--even in print; so that she\nwas in possession of no strong preconceived notions as to the nature\nor requisite contents of such a document. She was a little shocked\nwhen Luke called his mother a goose;--she was a little startled\nwhen he said that people were \"liars,\" having an idea that the word\nwas one not to be lightly used;--she was amused by the allusion to\nthe baronet's grandmother, feeling, however, that the manner and\nlanguage of his letter was less pretty and love-laden than she had\nexpected;--and she was frightened when he so confidently called upon\nher to write to him twice a week. But, nevertheless, the letter was\na genial one, joyous, and, upon the whole, comforting. She read it\nvery slowly, going back over much of it twice and thrice, so that her\nmother became impatient before the perusal was finished.\n\n\"It seems to be very long,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Yes, mamma, it is long. It's nearly four sides.\"\n\n\"What can he have to say so much?\"\n\n\"There's a good deal of it is about his own private affairs.\"\n\n\"I suppose, then, I mustn't see it.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, mamma!\" And Rachel handed her the letter. \"I shouldn't think\nof having a letter from him and not showing it to you;--not as things\nare now.\" Then Mrs. Ray took the letter and spent quite as much time\nin reading it as Rachel had done. \"He writes as though he meant to\nhave everything quite his own way,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"That's what he does mean. I think he will do that always. He's what\npeople call imperious; but that isn't bad in a man, is it?\"\n\nMrs. Ray did not quite know whether it was bad in a man or no.\nBut she mistrusted the letter, not construing it closely so as to\ndiscover what might really be its full meaning, but perceiving that\nthe young man took, or intended to take, very much into his own\nhands; that he demanded that everything should be surrendered to\nhis will and pleasure, without any guarantee on his part that such\nsurrendering should be properly acknowledged. Mrs. Ray was disposed\nto doubt people and things that were at a distance from her. Some\ncheck could be kept over a lover at Baslehurst; or, if perchance the\nlover had removed himself only to Exeter, with which city Mrs. Ray\nwas personally acquainted, she could have believed in his return. He\nwould not, in that case, have gone utterly beyond her ken. But she\ncould put no confidence in a lover up in London. Who could say that\nhe might not marry some one else to-morrow,--that he might not be\npromising to marry half a dozen? It was with her the same sort of\nfeeling which made her think it possible that Mr. Prong might go\nto Australia. She would have liked as a lover for her daughter a\nyoung man fixed in business,--if not at Baslehurst, then at Totnes,\nDartmouth, or Brixham,--under her own eye as it were;--a young man\nso fixed that all the world of South Devonshire would know of all\nhis doings. Such a young man, when he asked a girl to marry him, must\nmean what he said. If he did not there would be no escape for him\nfrom the punishment of his neighbours' eyes and tongues. But a young\nman up in London,--a young man who had quarrelled with his natural\nfriends in Baslehurst,--a young man who was confessedly masterful\nand impetuous,--a young man who called his own mother a goose,\nand all the rest of the world liars, in his first letter to his\nlady-love;--was that a young man in whom Mrs. Ray could place\nconfidence as a lover for her pet lamb? She read the letter very\nslowly, and then, as she gave it back to Rachel, she groaned.\n\nFor nearly half an hour after that nothing was said in the cottage\nabout the letter. Rachel had perceived that it had not been thought\nsatisfactory by her mother; but then she was inclined to believe\nthat her mother would have regarded no letter as satisfactory until\narguments had been used to prove to her that it was so. This, at\nany rate, was clear,--must be clear to Mrs. Ray as it was clear to\nRachel,--that Luke had no intention of shirking the fulfilment of his\nengagement. And after all, was not that the one thing as to which\nit was essentially necessary that they should be confident? Had she\nnot accepted Luke, telling him that she loved him? and was it not\nacknowledged by all around her that such a marriage would be good\nfor her? The danger which they feared was the expectation of such\na marriage without its accomplishment. Even the forebodings of Mrs.\nPrime had shown that this was the evil to which they pointed. Under\nthese circumstances what better could be wished for than a ready,\nquick, warm assurance on Luke's part, that he did intend all that he\nhad said?\n\nWith Rachel now, as with all girls under such circumstances, the\nchief immediate consideration was as to the answer which should be\ngiven. Was she to write to him, to write what she pleased; and might\nshe write at once? She felt that she longed to have the pen in her\nhand, and that yet, when holding it, she would have to think for\nhours before writing the first word. \"Mamma,\" she said at last,\n\"don't you think it's a good letter?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think, my dear. I doubt whether any letters of\nthat sort are good for much.\"\n\n\"Of what sort, mamma?\"\n\n\"Letters from men who call themselves lovers to young girls. It would\nbe safer, I think, that there shouldn't be any;--very much safer.\"\n\n\"But if he hadn't written we should have thought that he had\nforgotten all about us. That would not have been good. You said\nyourself that if he did not write soon, there would be an end of\neverything.\"\n\n\"A hundred years ago there wasn't all this writing between young\npeople, and these things were managed better then than they are now,\nas far as I can understand.\"\n\n\"People couldn't write so much then,\" said Rachel, \"because there\nwere no railways and no postage stamps. I suppose I must answer it,\nmamma?\" To this proposition Mrs. Ray made no immediate answer. \"Don't\nyou think I ought to answer it, mamma?\"\n\n\"You can't want to write at once.\"\n\n\"In the afternoon would do.\"\n\n\"In the afternoon! Why should you be in so much hurry, Rachel? It\ntook him four or five days to write to you.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he was down in Northamptonshire on business. Besides he\nhadn't any letter from me to answer. I shouldn't like him to think--\"\n\n\"To think what, Rachel?\"\n\n\"That I had forgotten him.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"Or that I didn't treat his letter with respect.\"\n\n\"He won't think that. But I must turn it over in my mind; and I\nbelieve I ought to ask somebody.\"\n\n\"Not Dolly,\" said Rachel, eagerly.\n\n\"No, not your sister. I will not ask her. But if you don't mind,\nmy dear, I'll take the young man's letter out to Mr. Comfort, and\nconsult him. I never felt myself so much in need of somebody to\nadvise me. Mr. Comfort is an old man, and you won't mind his seeing\nthe letter.\"\n\nRachel did mind it very much, but she had no means of saving herself\nfrom her fate. She did not like the idea of having her love-letter\nsubmitted to the clergyman of the parish. I do not know any young\nlady who would have liked it. But bad as that was, it was preferable\nto having the letter submitted to Mrs. Prime. And then she remembered\nthat Mr. Comfort had advised that she might go to the ball, and that\nhe was father to her friend Mrs. Butler Cornbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nELECTIONEERING.\n\n\nAnd now, in these days,--the days immediately following the departure\nof Luke Rowan from Baslehurst,--the Tappitt family were constrained\nto work very hard at the task of defaming the young man who had\nlately been living with them in their house. They were constrained\nto do this by the necessities of their position; and in doing so by\nno means showed themselves to be such monsters of iniquity as the\nreaders of the story will feel themselves inclined to call them.\nAs for Tappitt himself, he certainly believed that Rowan was so\nbase a scoundrel that no evil words against him could be considered\nas malicious or even unnecessary. Is it not good to denounce a\nscoundrel? And if the rascality of any rascal be specially directed\nagainst oneself and one's own wife and children, is it not a duty to\ndenounce that rascal, so that his rascality may be known and thus\nmade of no effect? When Tappitt declared in the reading-room at\nthe Dragon, and afterwards in the little room inside the bar at\nthe King's Head, and again to a circle of respectable farmers and\ntradesmen in the Corn Market, that young Rowan had come down to the\nbrewery and made his way into the brewery-house with a ready prepared\nplan for ruining him--him, the head of the firm,--he thought that\nhe was telling the truth. And again, when he spoke with horror of\nRowan's intention of setting up an opposition brewery, his horror was\nconscientious. He believed that it would be very wicked in a man to\noppose the Bungall establishment with money left by Bungall,--that\nit would be a wickedness than which no commercial rascality could\nbe more iniquitous. His very soul was struck with awe at the idea.\nThat anything was due in the matter to the consumer of beer, never\noccurred to him. And it may also be said in Tappitt's favour that\nhis opinion,--as a general opinion,--was backed by those around him.\nHis neighbours could not be made to hate Rowan as he hated him. They\nwould not declare the young man to be the very Mischief, as he did.\nBut that idea of a rival brewery was distasteful to them all. Most of\nthem knew that the beer was almost too bad to be swallowed; but they\nthought that Tappitt had a vested interest in the manufacture of bad\nbeer;--that as a manufacturer of bad beer he was a fairly honest and\nuseful man;--and they looked upon any change as the work, or rather\nthe suggestion, of a charlatan.\n\n\"This isn't Staffordshire,\" they said. \"If you want beer like that\nyou can buy it in bottles at Griggs'.\"\n\n\"He'll soon find where he'll be if he tries to undersell me,\" said\nyoung Griggs. \"All the same, I hope he'll come back, because he has\nleft a little bill at our place.\"\n\nAnd then to other evil reports was added that special evil\nreport,--that Rowan had gone away without paying his debts. I am\ninclined to think that Mr. Tappitt can be almost justified in his\nevil thoughts and his evil words.\n\nI cannot make out quite so good a case for Mrs. Tappitt and her two\nelder daughters;--for even Martha, Martha the just, shook her head\nin these days when Rowan's name was mentioned;--but something may\nbe said even for them. It must not be supposed that Mrs. Tappitt's\nsingle grievance was her disappointment as regarded Augusta. Had\nthere been no Augusta on whose behalf a hope had been possible, the\npredilection of the young moneyed stranger for such a girl as Rachel\nRay would have been a grievance to such a woman as Mrs. Tappitt. Had\nshe not been looking down on Rachel Ray and despising her for the\nlast ten years? Had she not been wondering among her friends, with\ncharitable volubility, as to what that poor woman at Bragg's End was\nto do with her daughter? Had she not been regretting that the young\ngirl should be growing up so big, and promising to look so coarse?\nWas it not natural that she should be miserable when she saw her\ntaken in hand by Mrs. Butler Cornbury, and made the heroine at her\nown party, to the detriment of her own daughters, by the fashionable\nlady in catching whom she had displayed so much unfortunate\ningenuity? Under such circumstances how could she do other than\nhate Luke Rowan,--than believe him to be the very Mischief,--than\nprophesying all manner of bad things for Rachel,--and assist her\nhusband tooth and nail in his animosity against the sinner?\n\nAugusta was less strong in her feelings than her parents, but\nof course she disliked the man who could admire Rachel Ray. As\nregards Martha, her dislike to him,--or rather, her judicial\ndisapproval,--was founded on his social and commercial improprieties.\nShe understood that he had threatened her father about the\nbusiness,--and she had been scandalized in that matter of the\nchampagne. Cherry was very brave, and still stood up for him before\nher mother and sisters;--but even Cherry did not dare to say a word\nin his favour before her father. Mr. Tappitt had been driven to\nforget himself, and to take a poker in his hand as a weapon of\nviolence! After that let no one speak a word on the offender's behalf\nin Tappitt's house and within Tappitt's hearing!\n\nIn that affair of the champagne Rowan was most bitterly injured. He\nhad ordered it, if not at the request, at least at the instigation\nof Mrs. Tappitt;--and he had paid for it. When he left Baslehurst he\nowed no shilling to any man in it; and, indeed, he was a man by no\nmeans given to owing money to any one. He was of a spirit masterful,\nself-confident, and perhaps self-glorious;--but he was at the same\ntime honest and independent. That wine had been ordered in some\nunusual way,--not at the regular counter, and in the same way the\nbill for it had been paid. Griggs, when he made his assertion in the\nbar-room at the King's Head, had stated what he believed to be the\ntruth. The next morning he chanced to hear that the account had been\nsettled, but not, at the moment, duly marked off the books. As far as\nGriggs went that was the end of it. He did not again say that Rowan\nowed money to him; but he never contradicted his former assertion,\nand allowed the general report to go on,--that report which had been\nfounded on his own first statement. Thus before Rowan had been a week\nout of the place it was believed all over the town that he had left\nunpaid bills behind him.\n\n\"I am told that young man is dreadfully in debt,\" said Mr. Prong to\nMrs. Prime. At this time Mr. Prong and Mrs. Prime saw each other\ndaily, and were affectionate in their intercourse,--with a serious,\nsolemn affection; but affairs were by no means settled between them.\nThat affection was, however, strong enough to induce Mr. Prong to\ntake a decided part in opposing the Rowan alliance. \"They say he owes\nmoney all over the town.\"\n\n\"So Miss Pucker tells me,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"Does your mother know it?\"\n\n\"Mother never knows anything that other people know. But he has gone\nnow, and I don't suppose we shall hear of him or see him again.\"\n\n\"He has not written to her, Dorothea?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"You should find out. You should not leave them in this danger. Your\nmother is weak, and you should give her the aid of your strength.\nThe girl is your sister, and you should not leave her to grope in\ndarkness. You should remember, Dorothea, that you have a duty in this\nmatter.\"\n\nDorothea did not like being told of her duty in so pastoral a manner,\nand resolved to be more than ever particular in the protection of\nher own pecuniary rights before she submitted herself to Mr. Prong's\nmarital authority once and for ever. By Miss Pucker she was at any\nrate treated with great respect, and was allowed perhaps some display\nof pastoral manner on her own part. It began to be with her a matter\nof doubt whether she might not be of more use in that free vineyard\nwhich she was about to leave, than in that vineyard with closed doors\nand a pastoral overseer, which she was preparing herself to enter. At\nany rate she would be careful about the money. But, in the mean time,\nshe did agree with Mr. Prong that Rowan's proper character should\nbe made known to her mother, and with this view she went out to the\ncottage and whispered into Mrs. Ray's astonished ears the fact that\nLuke was terribly in debt.\n\n\"You don't say so!\"\n\n\"But I do say so, mother. Everybody in Baslehurst is talking about\nit. And they all say that he has treated Mr. Tappitt shamefully. Has\nanything come from him since he went?\"\n\nThen Mrs. Ray told her elder daughter of the letter, and told her\nalso that she intended to consult Mr. Comfort. \"Oh, Mr. Comfort!\"\nsaid Mrs. Prime, signifying her opinion that her mother was going to\na very poor counsellor. \"And what sort of a letter was it?\" said Mrs.\nPrime, with a not unnatural desire to see it.\n\n\"It was an honest letter enough,--very honest to my thinking; and\nspeaking as though everything between them was quite settled.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, mother.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may be nonsense, Dorothea; but I am only telling you what\nthe letter said. He called his mother a goose; that was the worst\nthing in it.\"\n\n\"You cannot expect that such a one as he should honour his parents.\"\n\n\"But his mother thinks him the finest young man in the world. And I\nmust say this for him, that he has always spoken of her as though he\nloved her very dearly; and I believe he has been a most excellent\nson. He shouldn't have said goose;--at any rate in a letter;--not to\nmy way of thinking. But perhaps they don't mind those things up in\nLondon.\"\n\n\"I never knew a young man so badly spoken of at a place he'd left as\nhe is in Baslehurst. I think it right to tell you; but if you have\nmade up your mind to ask Mr. Comfort--\"\n\n\"Yes; I have made up my mind to ask Mr. Comfort. He has sent to say\nhe will call the day after to-morrow.\" Then Mrs. Prime went back\nhome, having seen neither the letter nor her sister.\n\nIt may be remembered that an election was impending over the town of\nBaslehurst, the coming necessities of which had induced Mrs. Butler\nCornbury to grace Mrs. Tappitt's ball. It was now nearly the end\nof July, and the election was to be made early in September. Both\ncandidates were already in the field, and the politicians of the\nneighbourhood already knew to a nicety how the affair would go. Mr.\nHart the great clothier from Houndsditch and Regent Street,--Messrs.\nHart and Jacobs of from 110 to 136 Houndsditch, and about as many\nmore numbers in Regent Street,--would come in at the top of the poll\nwith 173 votes, and Butler Cornbury, whose forefathers had lived in\nthe neighbourhood for the last four hundred years and been returned\nfor various places in Devonshire to dozens of parliaments, would be\nleft in the lurch with 171 votes. A petition might probably unseat\nthe Jew clothier; but then, as was well known, the Cornbury estate\ncould not bear the expenditure of the necessary five thousand pounds\nfor the petition, in addition to the twelve hundred which the\nelection itself was computed to cost. It was all known and thoroughly\nunderstood; and men in Baslehurst talked about the result as though\nthe matter were past a doubt. Nevertheless there were those who were\nready to bet on the Cornbury side of the question.\n\nBut though the thing was thus accurately settled, and though its\ntermination was foreseen by so many and with so perfect a certainty,\nstill the canvassing went on. In fact there were votes that had\nnot even yet been asked, much less promised,--and again, much less\npurchased. The Hart people were striving to frighten the Cornbury\npeople out of the field by the fear of the probable expenditure; and\nhad it not been for the good courage of Mrs. Butler Cornbury would\nprobably have succeeded in doing so. The old squire was very fidgety\nabout the money, and the young squire declared himself unwilling\nto lean too heavily upon his father. But the lady of the household\ndeclared her conviction that there was more smoke than fire, and more\nthreats of bribery than intention of bribing. She would go on, she\ndeclared; and as her word passed for much at Cornbury Grange, the\nbattle was still to be fought.\n\nAmong the votes which certainly had not as yet been promised was that\nof Mr. Tappitt. Mr. Hart in person had called upon him, but had not\nbeen quite satisfied with his reception. Mr. Tappitt was a man who\nthought much of his local influence and local privileges, and was by\nno means disposed to make a promise of his vote on easy terms, at a\nmoment when his vote was becoming of so much importance. He was no\ndoubt a liberal as was also Mr. Hart; but in small towns politics\nbecome split, and a man is not always bound to vote for a liberal\ncandidate because he is a liberal himself. Mr. Hart had been\nconfident in his tone, and had not sufficiently freed himself from\nall outer taint of his ancient race to please Mr. Tappitt's taste.\n\"He's an impudent low Jew,\" he had said to his wife. \"As for Butler\nCornbury he gives himself airs, and is too grand even to come and\nask. I don't think I shall vote at all.\" His wife had reminded him\nhow civil to them Mrs. Cornbury had been;--this was before the\nmorning of the poker;--but Tappitt had only sneered, and declared he\nwas not going to send a man to Parliament because his wife had come\nto a dance.\n\nBut we, who know Tappitt best, may declare now that his vote was to\nhave been had by any one who would have joined him energetically in\nabuse of Luke Rowan. His mind was full of his grievance. His heart\nwas laden with hatred of his enemy. His very soul was heavy with\nthat sorrow. Honyman, whom he had not yet dared to desert, had again\nrecommended submission to him, submission to one of the three terms\nproposed. Let him take the thousand a year and go out from the\nbrewery. That was Honyman's first advice. If not that, then let him\nadmit his enemy to a full partnership. If that were too distasteful\nto be possible, then let him raise ten thousand pounds on a mortgage\non the whole property, and buy Rowan out. Honyman thought that the\nmoney might be raised if Tappitt were willing to throw into the\nlump the moderate savings of his past life. But in answer to either\nproposal Tappitt only raved. Had Mr. Hart known all about this, he\nmight doubtless have secured Tappitt's vote.\n\nButler Cornbury refused to call at the brewery. \"The man's a\nliberal,\" he said to his wife, \"and what's the use? Besides he's just\nthe man I can't stand. We've always hated each other.\"\n\nWhereupon Mrs. B. Cornbury determined to call on Mrs. Tappitt, and\nto see Tappitt himself if it were possible. She had heard something\nof the Rowan troubles, but not all. She had heard, too, of Rowan's\nliking for Rachel Ray, having also seen something of it, as we know.\nBut, unfortunately for her husband's parliamentary interests, she had\nnot learned that the two things were connected together. And, very\nunfortunately also for the same interests, she had taken it into her\nhead that Rachel should be married to young Rowan. She had conceived\na liking for Rachel; and being by nature busy, fond of employment,\nand apt at managing other people's affairs, she had put her finger\non that match as one which she would task herself to further. This,\nI say, was unfortunate as regards her husband's present views. Her\nwork, now in hand, was to secure Tappitt's vote; and to have carried\nher point in that quarter, her surest method would have been to have\nentered the brewery open-mouthed against Luke Rowan and Rachel Ray.\n\nBut the conversation, almost at once, led to a word in praise of\nRachel, and to following words in praise of Luke. Martha only was in\nthe room with her mother. Mrs. Cornbury did not at once begin about\nthe vote, but made, as was natural, certain complimentary speeches\nabout the ball. Really she didn't remember when she had seen anything\nbetter done; and the young ladies looked so nice. She had indeed gone\naway early; but she had done so by no means on her own account, but\nbecause Rachel Ray had been tired. Then she said a nice good-natured\ngenial word or two about Rachel Ray and her performance on that\noccasion. \"It seemed to me,\" she added, \"that a certain young\ngentleman was quite smitten.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Tappitt's brow became black as thunder, and Mrs. Cornbury\nknew at once that she had trodden on unsafe ground,--on ground which\nshe should specially have avoided.\n\n\"We are all aware,\" Mrs. Tappitt said, \"that the certain young\ngentleman behaved very badly,--disgracefully, I may say;--but it\nwasn't our fault, Mrs. Cornbury.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Mrs. Tappitt, I didn't see anything amiss.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid everybody saw it. Indeed, everybody has been talking of\nit ever since. As regards him, what he did then was only of a piece\nwith his general conduct, which it doesn't become me to name in\nthe language which it deserves. His behaviour to Mr. T. has been\nshameful;--quite shameful.\"\n\n\"I had heard something, but I did not know there was anything like\nthat. I'm so sorry I mentioned his name.\"\n\n\"He has disagreed with papa about the brewery business,\" said Martha.\n\n\"It's more than that, Martha, as you know very well,\" continued Mrs.\nTappitt, still speaking in her great heat. \"He has shown himself bad\nin every way,--giving himself airs all over the town, and then going\naway without paying his debts.\"\n\n\"I don't think we know that, mamma.\"\n\n\"Everybody says so. Your own father heard Sam Griggs say with his own\nears that there was a shop bill left there of I don't know how long.\nBut that's nothing to us. He came here under false pretences, and now\nhe's been turned out, and we don't want to have any more to do with\nhim. But, Mrs. Cornbury, I am sorry about that poor foolish girl.\"\n\n\"I didn't think her poor or foolish at all,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, who\nhad quite heart enough to forget the vote her husband wanted in her\nwarmth for her young friend.\n\n\"I must say, then, I did;--I thought her very foolish, and I didn't\nat all like the way she went on in my house and before my girls. And\nas for him, he doesn't think of her any more than he thinks of me. In\nthe first place, he's engaged to another girl.\"\n\n\"We are not quite sure that he's engaged, mamma,\" said Martha.\n\n\"I don't know what you call being sure, my dear. I can't say I've\never heard it sworn to, on oath. But his sister Mary told your sister\nAugusta that he was. I think that's pretty good evidence. But, Mrs.\nCornbury, he's one of those that will be engaged to twenty, if he can\nfind twenty foolish enough to listen to him. And for her, who never\nwas at a dance before, to go on with him like that;--I must say that\nI thought it disgraceful!\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Tappitt,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, speaking with much\nauthority in her voice, \"I can only say that I didn't see it. She\nwas under my charge, and if it was as you say I must be very much to\nblame,--very much indeed.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I didn't mean that,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, frightened.\n\n\"I don't suppose you did,--but I mean it. As for the young gentleman,\nI know very little about him. He may be everything that is bad.\"\n\n\"You'll find that he is, Mrs. Cornbury.\"\n\n\"But as to Miss Ray, whom I've known all my life, and whose mother\nmy father has known for all her life, I cannot allow anything of\nthe kind to be said. She was under my charge; and when young ladies\nare under my charge I keep a close eye upon them,--for their own\ncomfort's sake. I know how to manage for them, and I always look\nafter them. On the night of your party I saw nothing in Miss Ray's\nconduct that was not nice, ladylike, and well-behaved. I must say so;\nand if I hear a whisper to the contrary in any quarter, you may be\nsure that I shall say so open-mouthed. How d'you do, Mr. Tappitt? I'm\nso glad you've come in, as I specially wanted to see you.\" Then she\nshook hands with Mr. Tappitt, who entered the room at the moment, and\nthe look and manner of her face was altered.\n\nMrs. Tappitt was cowed. If her husband had not come in at that moment\nshe might have said a word or two in her own defence, being driven to\ndo so by the absence of any other mode of retreating. But as he came\nin so opportunely, she allowed his coming to cover her defeat. Strong\nas was her feeling on the subject, she did not dare to continue her\nattack upon Rachel in opposition to the defiant bravery which came\nfull upon her from Mrs. Cornbury's eyes. The words had been bad, but\nthe determined fire of those eyes had been worse. Mrs. Tappitt was\ncowed, and allowed Rachel's name to pass away without further remark.\n\nMrs. Cornbury saw it all at a glance;--saw it all and understood it.\nThe vote was probably lost; but it would certainly be lost if Tappitt\nand his wife discussed the matter before he had pledged himself.\nThe vote would probably be lost, even though Tappitt should, in his\nignorance of what had just passed, pledge himself to give it. All\nthat Mrs. Cornbury perceived, and knew that she could lose nothing by\nan immediate request.\n\n\"Mr. Tappitt,\" said she, \"I have come canvassing. The fact is this:\nMr. Cornbury says you are a liberal, and that therefore he has not\nthe face to ask you. I tell him that I think you would rather support\na neighbour from the county, even though there may be a shade of\ndifference in politics between you, than a stranger, whose trade and\nreligion cannot possibly recommend him, and whose politics, if you\nreally knew them, would probably be quite as much unlike your own as\nare my husband's.\"\n\nThe little speech had been prepared beforehand, but was brought out\nquite as naturally as though Mrs. Cornbury had been accustomed to\nspeak on her legs for a quarter of a century.\n\nMr. Tappitt grunted. The attack came upon him so much by surprise\nthat he knew not what else to do but to grunt. If Mr. Cornbury had\ncome with the same speech in his mouth, and could then have sided off\ninto some general abuse of Luke Rowan, the vote would have been won.\n\n\"I'm sure Mrs. Tappitt will agree with me,\" said Mrs. Cornbury,\nsmiling very sweetly upon the foe she had so lately vanquished.\n\n\"Women don't know anything about it,\" said Tappitt, meaning to snub\nno one but his own wife, and forgetting that Mrs. Cornbury was a\nwoman. He blushed fiery red when the thought flashed upon him, and\nwished that his own drawing-room floor would open and receive him;\nnevertheless he was often afterwards heard to boast how he had put\ndown the politician in petticoats when she came electioneering to the\nbrewery.\n\n\"Well, that is severe,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, laughing.\n\n\"Oh, T.! you shouldn't have said that before Mrs. Cornbury!\"\n\n\"I only meant my own wife, ma'am; I didn't indeed.\"\n\n\"I'll forgive your satire if you'll give me your vote,\" said Mrs.\nCornbury, with her sweetest smile. \"He owes it me now; doesn't he,\nMrs. Tappitt?\"\n\n\"Well,--I really think he do.\" Mrs. Tappitt, in her double\ntrouble,--in her own defeat and her shame on behalf of her\nhusband's rudeness,--was driven back, out of all her latter-day\nconventionalities, into the thoughts and even into the language of\nold days. She was becoming afraid of Mrs. Cornbury, and submissive,\nas of old, to the rank and station of Cornbury Grange. In her terror\nshe was becoming a little forgetful of niceties learned somewhat late\nin life. \"I really think he do,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\nTappitt grunted again.\n\n\"It's a very serious thing,\" he said.\n\n\"So it is,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, interrupting him. She knew that her\nchance was gone if the man were allowed to get himself mentally upon\nhis legs. \"It is very serious; but the fact that you are still in\ndoubt shows that you have been thinking of it. We all know how good\na churchman you are, and that you would not willingly send a Jew to\nParliament.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Tappitt. \"I'm not for persecuting even the\nJews;--not when they pay their way and push themselves honourably in\ncommerce.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; commerce! There is nobody who has shown himself more\ndevoted to the commercial interests than Mr. Cornbury. We buy\neverything in Baslehurst. Unfortunately our people won't drink beer\nbecause of the cider.\"\n\n\"Tappitt doesn't think a bit about that, Mrs. Cornbury.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I shall be called upon in honour to support my party,\"\nsaid Tappitt.\n\n\"Exactly; but which is your party? Isn't the Protestant religion of\nyour country your party? These people are creeping down into all\nparts of the kingdom, and where shall we be if leading men like you\nthink more of shades of difference between liberal and conservative\nthan of the fundamental truths of the Church of England? Would you\ndepute a Jew to get up and speak your own opinions in your own\nvestry-room?\"\n\n\"That you wouldn't, T.,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, who was rather carried\naway by Mrs. Cornbury's eloquence.\n\n\"Not in a vestry, because it's joined on to a church,\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"Or would you like a Jew to be mayor in Baslehurst;--a Jew in the\nchair where you yourself were sitting only three years ago?\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be seemly, because our mayor is expected to attend\nin church on Roundabout Sunday.\" Roundabout Sunday, so called for\ncertain local reasons which it would be long to explain, followed\nimmediately on the day of the mayor's inauguration.\n\n\"Would you like to have a Jew partner in your own business?\"\n\nMrs. Butler Cornbury should have said nothing to Mr. Tappitt as to\nany partner in the brewery, Jew or Christian.\n\n\"I don't want any partner, and what's more, I don't mean to have\nany.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cornbury is in favour of Luke Rowan; she takes his side,\" said\nMrs. Tappitt, some portion of her courage returning to her as this\nopportunity opened upon her. Mr. Tappitt turned his head full round\nand looked upon Mrs. Cornbury with an evil eye. That lady knew that\nthe vote was lost, lost unless she would denounce the man whom Rachel\nloved; and she determined at once that she would not denounce him.\nThere are many things which such a woman will do to gain such an\nobject. She could smile when Tappitt was offensive; she could smile\nagain when Mrs. Tappitt talked like a kitchenmaid. She could flatter\nthem both, and pretend to talk seriously with them about Jews and her\nown Church feelings. She could have given up to them Luke Rowan,--if\nhe had stood alone. But she could not give up the girl she had\nchaperoned, and upon whom, during that chaperoning, her good-will and\nkindly feelings had fallen. Rachel had pleased her eye, and gratified\nher sense of feminine nicety. She felt that a word said against Rowan\nwould be a word said also against Rachel; and therefore, throwing\nher husband over for the nonce, she resolved to sacrifice the vote\nand stand up for her friend. \"Well, yes; I do,\" said she, meeting\nTappitt's eye steadily. She was not going to be looked out of\ncountenance by Mr. Tappitt.\n\n\"She thinks he'll come back to marry that young woman at Bragg's\nEnd,\" said Mrs. Tappitt; \"but I say that he'll never dare to show his\nface in Baslehurst again.\"\n\n\"That young woman is making a great fool of herself,\" said Tappitt,\n\"if she trusts to a swindler like him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Mrs. Tappitt,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, \"we needn't mind\ndiscussing Miss Ray. It's not good to talk about a young lady in that\nway, and I'm sure I never said that I thought she was engaged to\nMr. Rowan. Had I done so I should have been very wrong, for I know\nnothing about it. What little I saw of the gentleman I liked;\" and as\nshe used the word gentleman she looked Tappitt full in the face; \"and\nfor Miss Ray, I've a great regard for her, and think very highly of\nher. Independently of her acknowledged beauty and pleasant, ladylike\nmanners, she's a very charming girl. About the vote, Mr. Tappitt--;\nat any rate you'll think of it.\"\n\nBut had he not been defied in his own house? And as for her, the\nmother of those three finely educated girls, had not every word said\nin Rachel's favour been a dagger planted in her own maternal bosom?\nWhose courage would not have risen under such provocation?\n\nMrs. Cornbury had got up to go, but the indignant, injured Tappitts\nresolved mutually, though without concert, that she should be\nanswered.\n\n\"I'm an honest man, Mrs. Cornbury,\" said the brewer, \"and I like\nto speak out my mind openly. Mr. Hart is a liberal, and I mean to\nsupport my party. Will you tell Mr. Cornbury so with my compliments?\nIt's all nonsense about Jews not being in Parliament. It's not the\nsame as being mayors or churchwardens, or anything like that. I shall\nvote for Mr. Hart; and, what's more, we shall put him in.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Cornbury, if you have so much regard for Miss Rachel, you'd\nbetter advise her to think no more of that young man. He's no good;\nhe's not indeed. If you ask, you'll find he's in debt everywhere.\"\n\n\"Swindler!\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"I don't suppose it can be very bad with Miss Rachel yet, for she\nonly saw him about three times,--though she was so intimate with him\nat our party.\"\n\nMrs. Butler Cornbury curtseyed and smiled, and got herself out of the\nroom. Mrs. Tappitt, as soon as she remembered herself, rang the bell,\nand Mr. Tappitt, following her down to the hall door, went through\nthe pretence of putting her into her carriage.\n\n\"She's a nasty meddlesome woman,\" said Tappitt, as soon as he got\nback to his wife.\n\n\"And how ever she can stand up and say all those things for that\ngirl, passes me!\" said Mrs. Tappitt, holding up both her hands. \"She\nwas flighty herself, when young; she was, no doubt; and now I suppose\nshe likes others to be the same. If that's what she calls manners, I\nshouldn't like her to take my girls about.\"\n\n\"And him a gentleman!\" said Tappitt. \"If those are to be our\ngentlemen I'd sooner have all the Jews out of Jerusalem. But they'll\nfind out their gentleman; they'll find him out! He'll rob that old\nmother of his before he's done; you mark my words else.\" Comforting\nhimself with this hope he took himself back to his counting-house.\n\nMrs. Cornbury had smiled as she went, and had carried herself through\nthe whole interview without any sign of temper. Even when declaring\nthat she intended to take Rachel's part open-mouthed, she had spoken\nin a half-drolling way which had divested her words of any tone of\noffence. But when she got into her carriage, she was in truth very\nangry. \"I don't believe a word of it,\" she said to herself; \"not a\nword of it.\" That in which she professed to herself her own disbelief\nwas the general assertion that Rowan was a swindler, supported by the\nparticular assertion that he had left Baslehurst over head and ears\nin debt. \"I don't believe it.\" And she resolved that it should be her\nbusiness to find out whether the accusation were true or false. She\nknew the ins and outs of Baslehurst life and Baslehurst doings with\ntolerable accuracy, and was at any rate capable of unravelling such a\nmystery as that. If the Tappitts in their jealousy were striving to\nrob Rachel Ray of her husband by spreading false reports, she would\nencourage Rachel Ray in her love by spreading the truth;--if, as she\nbelieved, the truth should speak in Rowan's favour. She would have\nconsiderable pleasure in countermining Mr. and Mrs. Tappitt.\n\nAs to Mr. Tappitt's vote for the election;--that was gone!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nDR. HARFORD.\n\n\nThe current of events forced upon Rachel a delay of three or four\ndays in answering her letter, or rather forced upon her that delay in\nlearning whether or no she might answer it; and this was felt by her\nto be a grievous evil. It had been arranged that she should not write\nuntil such writing should have received what might almost be called\na parochial sanction, and no idea of acting in opposition to that\narrangement ever occurred to her; but the more she thought of it\nthe more she was vexed; and the more she thought of it the more she\nlearned to doubt whether or no her mother was placing her in safe\ntutelage. During these few weeks a great change came upon the girl's\ncharacter. When first Mrs. Prime had brought home tidings that Miss\nPucker had seen her walking and talking with the young man from the\nbrewery, angry as she had been with her sister, and disgusted as she\nhad been with Miss Pucker, she had acknowledged to herself that such\ntalking and walking were very dangerous, if not very improper, and\nshe had half resolved that there should be no more of them. And when\nMrs. Prime had seen her standing at the stile, and had brought home\nthat second report, Rachel, knowing what had occurred at that stile,\nhad then felt sure that she was in danger. At that time, though she\nhad thought much of Luke Rowan, she had not thought of him as a man\nwho could possibly be her husband. She had thought of him as having\nno right to call her Rachel, because he could not possibly become\nso. There had been great danger;--there had been conduct which she\nbelieved to be improper though she could not tell herself that she\nhad been guilty. In her outlook into the world nothing so beautiful\nhad promised itself to her as having such a man to love her as Luke\nRowan. Though her mother was not herself ascetic,--liking tea and\nbuttered toast dearly, and liking also little soft laughter with\nher child,--she had preached ascetisms till Rachel had learned to\nthink that the world was all either ascetic or reprobate. The Dorcas\nmeetings had become distasteful to her because the women were vulgar;\nbut yet she had half believed herself to be wrong in avoiding the\nwork and the vulgarity together. Idle she had never been. Since a\nneedle had come easy to her hand, and the economies of a household\nhad been made intelligible to her, she had earned her bread and\nassisted in works of charity. She had read no love stories, and been\ntaught to expect no lover. She was not prepared to deny,--did not\ndeny even to herself,--that it was wrong that she should even like to\ntalk to Luke Rowan.\n\nThen came the ball; or, rather, first came the little evening party,\nwhich afterwards grew to be a ball. She had been very desirous of\ngoing, not for the sake of any pleasure that she promised herself;\nnot for the sake of such pleasure as girls do promise themselves at\nsuch gatherings; but because her female pride told her that it was\nwell for her to claim the right of meeting this young man,--well for\nher to declare that nothing had passed between them which should make\nher afraid to meet him. That some other hopes had crept in as the\nevening had come nigh at hand,--hopes of which she had been made\naware only by her efforts in repressing them,--may not be denied. She\nhad been accused because of him; and she would show that no such\naccusation had daunted her. But would he,--would he give occasion for\nfurther accusation? She believed he would not; nay, she was sure; at\nany rate she hoped he would not. She told herself that such was her\nhope; but had he not noticed her she would have been wretched.\n\nWe know now in what manner he had noticed her, and we know also\nwhether she had been wretched. She had certainly fled from him. When\nshe left the brewery-house, inducing Mrs. Cornbury to bring her away,\nshe did so in order that she might escape from him. But she ran from\nhim as one runs from some great joy in order that the mind may revel\nover it in peace. Then, little as she knew it, her love had been\ngiven. Her heart was his. She had placed him upon her pinnacle,\nand was prepared to worship him. She was ready to dress herself in\nhis eyes, to believe that to be good which he thought good, and to\nrepudiate that which he repudiated. When she bowed her head over his\nbreast a day or two afterwards, she could have spoken to him with the\nfull words of passionate love had not maiden fear repressed her.\n\nBut she had not even bowed her head for him, she had not acknowledged\nto herself that such love was possible to her, till her mother had\nconsented. That her mother's consent had been wavering, doubtful,\nexpressed without intention of such expression,--so expressed that\nMrs. Ray hardly knew that she had expressed it,--was not understood\nby Rachel. Her mother had consented, and, that consent having been\ngiven, Rachel was not now disposed to allow of any steps backwards.\nShe seemed to have learned her rights, or to have assumed that she\nhad rights. Hitherto her obedience to her mother had been pure and\nsimple, although, from the greater force of her character, she had\nin many things been her mother's leader. But now, though she was\nill inclined to rebel, though in this matter of the letter she had\nobeyed, she was beginning to feel that obedience might become a\nhardship. She did not say to herself, \"They have let me love him, and\nnow they must not put out their hands to hold back my love;\" but the\ncurrent of her feelings ran as though such unspoken words had passed\nacross her mind. She had her rights; and though she did not presume\nthat she could insist on them in opposition to her mother or her\nmother's advisers, she knew that she would be wronged if those\nrights were withheld from her. The chief of those rights was the\npossession of her lover. If he was taken from her she would be as one\nimprisoned unjustly,--as one robbed by those who should have been\nhis friends,--as one injured, wounded, stricken in the dark, and\ntreacherously mutilated by hands that should have protected him.\nDuring these days she was silent, and sat with that look upon her\nbrow which her mother feared.\n\n\"I could not make Mr. Comfort come any sooner, Rachel,\" said Mrs.\nRay.\n\n\"No, mamma.\"\n\n\"I can see how impatient you are.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I'm impatient. I'm sure that I haven't said\nanything.\"\n\n\"If you said anything I shouldn't mind it so much; but I can't bear\nto see you with that unhappy look. I'm sure I only wish to do what's\nbest. You can't think it right that you should be writing letters to\na gentleman without being sure that it is proper.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, don't talk about it!\"\n\n\"You don't like me to ask your sister; and I'm sure it's natural I\nshould want to ask somebody. He's nearly seventy years old, and he\nhas known you ever since you were born. And then he's a clergyman,\nand therefore he'll be sure to know what's right. Not that I should\nhave liked to have said a word about it to Mr. Prong, because there's\na difference when they come from one doesn't know where.\"\n\n\"Pray, mamma, don't. I haven't made any objection to Mr. Comfort. It\nisn't nice to be talked over in that way by anybody, that's all.\"\n\n\"But what was I to do? I'm sure I liked the young man very much. I\nnever knew a young man who took his tea so pleasant. And as for his\nmanners and his way of talking, I had it in my heart to fall in love\nwith him myself. I had indeed. As far as that goes, he's just the\nyoung man that I could make a son of.\"\n\n\"Dear mamma! my own dearest mamma!\" and Rachel, jumping up, threw\nherself upon her mother's neck. \"Stop there. You shan't say another\nword.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I didn't mean to say anything unpleasant.\"\n\n\"No, you did not; and I won't be impatient.\"\n\n\"Only I can't bear that look. And you know what his mother said,--and\nMrs. Tappitt. Not that I care about Mrs. Tappitt; only a person's\nmother is his mother, and he shouldn't have called her a goose.\"\n\nIt must be acknowledged that Rachel's position was not comfortable;\nand it certainly would not have been improved had she known how many\npeople in Baslehurst were talking about her and Rowan. That Rowan was\ngone everybody knew; that he had made love to Rachel everybody said;\nthat he never meant to come back any more most professed to believe.\nTappitt's tongue was loud in proclaiming his iniquities; and her\nfollies and injuries Mrs. Tappitt whispered into the ears of all her\nfemale acquaintances.\n\n\"I'm sorry for her,\" Miss Harford said, mildly. Mrs. Tappitt was\ncalling at the rectory, and had made her way in. Mr. Tappitt was\nan upholder of the old rector, and there was a fellow-townsman's\nfriendship between them.\n\n\"Oh yes;--very sorry for her,\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Very sorry indeed,\" said Augusta, who was with her mother.\n\n\"She always seemed to me a pretty, quiet, well-behaved girl,\" said\nMiss Harford.\n\n\"Still waters run deepest, you know, Miss Harford,\" said Mrs.\nTappitt. \"I should never have imagined it of her;--never. But she\ncertainly met him half-way.\"\n\n\"But we all thought he was respectable, you know,\" said Miss Harford.\n\nMiss Harford was thoroughly good-natured; and though she had never\ngone half-way herself, and had perhaps lost her chance from having\nbeen unable to go any part of the way, she was not disposed to\ncondemn a girl for having been willing to be admired by such a one as\nLuke Rowan.\n\n\"Well;--yes; at first we did. He had the name of money, you know, and\nthat goes so far with some girls. We were on our guard,\"--and she\nlooked proudly round on Augusta,--\"till we should hear what the young\nman really was. He has thrown off his sheep's clothing now with a\nvengeance. Mr. Tappitt feels quite ashamed that he should have\nintroduced him to any of the people here; he does indeed.\"\n\n\"That may be her misfortune, and not her fault,\" said Miss Harford,\nwho in defending Rachel was well enough inclined to give up Luke.\nIndeed, Baslehurst was beginning to have a settled mind that Luke was\na wolf.\n\n\"Oh, quite so,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"The poor girl has been very\nunfortunate no doubt.\"\n\nAfter that she took her leave of the rectory.\n\nOn that evening Mr. Comfort dined with Dr. Harford, as did also\nButler Cornbury and his wife, and one or two others. The chances of\nthe election formed, of course, the chief subject of conversation\nboth in the drawing-room and at the dinner-table; but in talking of\nthe election they came to talk of Mr. Tappitt, and in talking of\nTappitt they came to talk of Luke Rowan.\n\nIt has already been said that Dr. Harford had been rector of\nBaslehurst for many years at the period to which this story refers.\nHe had nearly completed half a century of work in that capacity, and\nhad certainly been neither an idle nor an inefficient clergyman. But,\nnow in his old age, he was discontented and disgusted by the changes\nwhich had come upon him; and though some bodily strength for further\nservice still remained to him, he had no longer any aptitude for\nuseful work. A man cannot change as men change. Individual men are\nlike the separate links of a rotatory chain. The chain goes on with\ncontinuous easy motion as though every part of it were capable of\nadapting itself to a curve, but not the less is each link as stiff\nand sturdy as any other piece of wrought iron. Dr. Harford had in his\ntime been an active, popular man,--a man possessing even some liberal\ntendencies in politics, though a country rector of nearly half a\ncentury's standing. In his parish he had been more than a clergyman.\nHe had been a magistrate, and a moving man in municipal affairs. He\nhad been a politician, and though now for many years he had supported\nthe Conservative candidate, he had been loudly in favour of the\nReform Bill when Baslehurst was a close borough in the possession of\na great duke, who held property hard by. But liberal politics had\ngone on and had left Dr. Harford high and dry on the standing-ground\nwhich he had chosen for himself in the early days of his manhood. And\nthen had come that pestilent act of the legislature under which his\nparish had been divided. Not that the Act of Parliament itself had\nbeen violently condemned by the doctor on its becoming law. I doubt\nwhether he had then thought much of it.\n\nBut when men calling themselves Commissioners came actually upon\nhim and his, and separated off from him a district of his own town,\ntaking it away altogether from his authority, and giving it over to\nsuch inexperienced hands as chance might send thither,--then Dr.\nHarford became a violent Tory. And my readers must not conceive that\nthis was a question touching his pocket. One might presume that his\npocket would be in some degree benefited, seeing that he was saved\nfrom the necessity of supplying the spiritual wants of a certain\nportion of his parish. No shilling was taken from his own income,\nwhich, indeed, was by no means excessive. His whole parish gave him\nbarely six hundred a year, out of which he had kept always one, and\nlatterly two curates. It was no question of money in any degree.\nSooner than be invaded and mutilated he would have submitted to an\norder calling upon him to find a third curate,--could any power\nhave given such order. His parish had been invaded and his clerical\nauthority mutilated. He was no longer _totus teres atque rotundus_.\nThe beauty of his life was over, and the contentment of his mind\nwas gone. He knew that it was only left for him to die, spending\nsuch days as remained to him in vague prophecies of evil against his\ndevoted country,--a country which had allowed its ancient parochial\nlandmarks to be moved, and its ecclesiastical fastnesses to be\ninvaded!\n\nBut perhaps hatred of Mr. Prong was the strongest passion of Dr.\nHarford's heart at the present moment. He had ever hated the\ndissenting ministers by whom he was surrounded. In Devonshire dissent\nhas waxed strong for many years, and the pastors of the dissenting\nflocks have been thorns in the side of the Church of England\nclergymen. Dr. Harford had undergone his full share of suffering\nfrom such thorns. But they had caused him no more than a pleasant\nirritation in comparison with what he endured from the presence of\nMr. Prong in Baslehurst. He would sooner have entertained all the\ndissenting ministers of the South Hams together than have put his\nlegs under the same mahogany with Mr. Prong. Mr. Prong was to him the\nevil thing! Anathema! He believed all bad things of Mr. Prong with\nan absolute faith, but without any ground on which such faith should\nhave been formed. He thought that Mr. Prong drank spirits; that\nhe robbed his parishioners;--Dr. Harford would sooner have lost\nhis tongue than have used such a word with reference to those who\nattended Mr. Prong's chapel;--that he had left a deserted wife on\nsome parish; that he was probably not in truth ordained. There was\nnothing which Dr. Harford could not believe of Mr. Prong. Now all\nthis was, to say the least of it, a pity, for it disfigured the close\nof a useful and conscientious life.\n\nDr. Harford of course intended to vote for Mr. Cornbury, but he\nwould not join loudly in condemnation of Mr. Tappitt. Tappitt had\nstood stanchly by him in all parochial contests regarding the new\ndistrict. Tappitt opposed the Prong faction at all points. Tappitt as\nchurchwarden had been submissive to the doctor. Church of England\nprinciples had always been held at the brewery, and Bungall had been\never in favour with Dr. Harford's predecessor.\n\n\"He calls himself a Liberal, and always has done,\" said the doctor.\n\"You can't expect that he should desert his own party.\"\n\n\"But a Jew!\" said old Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"Well; why not a Jew?\" said the doctor. Whereupon Mr. Comfort, and\nButler Cornbury, and Dr. Harford's own curate, young Mr. Calclough,\nand Captain Byng, an old bachelor, who lived in Baslehurst, all\nstared at him; as Dr. Harford had intended that they should. \"Upon\nmy word,\" said he, \"I don't see the use for caring for that kind of\nthing any longer; I don't indeed. In the way we are going on now, and\nfor the sort of thing we do, I don't see why Jews shouldn't serve\nus as well in Parliament as Christians. If I am to have my brains\nknocked out, I'd sooner have it done by a declared enemy than by one\nwho calls himself my friend.\"\n\n\"But our brains are not knocked out yet,\" said Butler Cornbury.\n\n\"I don't know anything about yours, but mine are.\"\n\n\"I don't think the world's coming to an end yet,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Nor do I. I said nothing about the world coming to an end. But if\nyou saw a part of your ship put under the command of a landlubber,\nwho didn't know one side of the vessel from the other, you'd think\nthe world had better come to an end than be carried on in that way.\"\n\n\"It's not the same thing, you know,\" said the captain. \"You couldn't\ndivide a ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, well; you'll see.\"\n\n\"I don't think any Christian should vote for a Jew,\" said the curate.\n\"A verdict has gone out against them, and what is man that he should\nreverse it?\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure that you are reversing it by putting them into\nParliament?\" said Dr. Harford. \"May not that be a carrying on of the\ncurse?\"\n\n\"There's consolation in that idea for Butler if he loses his\nelection,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"Parliament isn't what it was,\" said the doctor. \"There's no doubt\nabout that.\"\n\n\"And who is to blame?\" said Mr. Comfort, who had never supported the\nReform Bill as his neighbour had done.\n\n\"I say nothing about blame. It's natural that things should get worse\nas they grow older.\"\n\n\"Dr. Harford thinks Parliament is worn out,\" said Butler Cornbury.\n\n\"And what if I do think so? Have not other things as great fallen\nand gone into decay? Did not the Roman senate wear out, as you call\nit? And as for these Jews, of whom you are speaking, what was the\ncurse upon them but the wearing out of their grace and wisdom? I am\ninclined to think that we are wearing out; only I wish the garment\ncould have lasted my time without showing so many thin places.\"\n\n\"Now I believe just the contrary,\" said the captain. \"I don't think\nwe have come to our full growth yet.\"\n\n\"Could we lick the French as we did at Trafalgar and Waterloo?\" said\nthe doctor.\n\nThe captain thought a while before he answered, and then spoke with\nmuch solemnity. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I think we could. And I hope the\ntime will soon come when we may.\"\n\n\"We shan't do it if we send Jews to Parliament,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"I must say I think Tappitt wrong,\" said young Cornbury. \"Of course,\nnear as the thing is going, I'm sorry to lose his vote; but I'm not\nspeaking because of that. He has always pretended to hold on to the\nChurch party here, and the Church party has held on to him. His beer\nis none of the best, and I think he'd have been wise to stick to his\nold friends.\"\n\n\"I don't see the argument about the beer,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"He shouldn't provoke his neighbours to look at his faults.\"\n\n\"But the Jew's friends would find out that the beer is bad as well as\nyours.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" said Cornbury, \"that Tappitt thinks he has a personal\ngrievance against me. He's as cross as a bear with a sore head at the\npresent moment, because this young fellow who was to have been his\npartner has turned against him. There's some love affair, and my wife\nhas been there and made a mess of it. It's hard upon me, for I don't\nknow that I ever saw the young man in my life.\"\n\n\"I believe that fellow is a scamp,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Mr. Comfort, thinking of Rachel and her hopes.\n\n\"We all hope he isn't, of course,\" said the doctor. \"But we can't\nprevent men being scamps by hoping. There are other scamps in\nthis town in whom, if my hoping would do any good, a very great\nchange would be made.\"--Everybody present knew that the doctor\nalluded especially to Mr. Prong, whose condition, however, if the\ndoctor's hopes could have been carried out, would not have been\nenviable.--\"But I fear this fellow Rowan is a scamp, and I think he\nhas treated Tappitt badly. Tappitt told me all about it only this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Audi alteram partem,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"The scamp's party you mean,\" said the doctor. \"I haven't the means\nof doing that. If in this world we suspend our judgment till we've\nheard all that can be said on both sides of every question, we should\nnever come to any judgment at all. I hear that he's in debt; I\nbelieve he behaved very badly to Tappitt himself, so that Tappitt\nwas forced to use personal violence to defend himself; and he has\ncertainly threatened to open a new brewery here. Now that's bad, as\ncoming from a young man related to the old firm.\"\n\n\"I think he should leave the brewery alone,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"Of course he should,\" said the doctor. \"And I hear, moreover, that\nhe is playing a wicked game with a girl in your parish.\"\n\n\"I don't know about a wicked game,\" said the other. \"It won't be a\nwicked game if he marries her.\"\n\nThen Rachel's chances of matrimonial success were discussed with\na degree of vigour which must have been felt by her to be highly\ncomplimentary, had she been aware of it. But I grieve to say that\npublic opinion, as expressed in Dr. Harford's dining-room, went\nagainst Luke Rowan. Mr. Tappitt was not a great man, either as a\ncitizen or as a brewer: he was not one to whom Baslehurst would even\nrejoice to raise a monument; but such as he was he had been known for\nmany years. No one in that room loved or felt for him anything like\nreal friendship; but the old familiarity of the place was in his\nfavour, and his form was known of old upon the High Street. He was\nnot a drunkard, he lived becomingly with his wife, he had paid his\nway, and was a fellow-townsman. What was it to Dr. Harford, or\neven to Mr. Comfort, that he brewed bad beer? No man was compelled\nto drink it. Why should not a man employ himself, openly and\nlegitimately, in the brewing of bad beer, if the demand for bad beer\nwere so great as to enable him to live by the occupation? On the\nother hand, Luke Rowan was personally known to none of them; and they\nwere jealous that a change should come among them with any view of\nteaching them a lesson or improving their condition. They believed,\nor thought they believed, that Mr. Tappitt had been ill-treated in\nhis counting-house. It was grievous to them that a man with a wife\nand three daughters should have been threatened by a young unmarried\nman,--by a man whose shoulders were laden with no family burden.\nWhether Rowan's propositions had been in truth good or evil, just\nor unjust, they had not inquired, and would not probably have\nascertained had they done so. But they judged the man and condemned\nhim. Mr. Comfort was brought round to condemn him as thoroughly\nas did Dr. Harford,--not reflecting, as he did so, how fatal his\ncondemnation might be to the happiness of poor Rachel Ray.\n\n\"The fact is, Butler,\" said the doctor, when Mr. Comfort had left\nthem, and gone to the drawing-room;--\"the fact is, your wife has not\nplayed her cards at the brewery as well as she usually does play\nthem. She has been taking this young fellow's part; and after that I\ndon't know how she was to expect that Tappitt would stand by you.\"\n\n\"No general can succeed always,\" said Cornbury, laughing.\n\n\"Well; some generals do. But I must confess your wife is generally\nvery successful. Come; we'll go up-stairs; and don't you tell her\nthat I've been finding fault. She's as good as gold, and I can't\nafford to quarrel with her; but I think she has tripped here.\"\n\nWhen the old doctor and Butler Cornbury reached the drawing-room the\nnames of Rowan and Tappitt had not been as yet banished from the\nconversation; but to them had been added some others. Rachel's name\nhad been again mentioned, as had also that of Rachel's sister.\n\n\"Papa, who do you think is going to be married?\" said Miss Harford.\n\n\"Not you, my dear, is it?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Mr. Prong is going to be married to Mrs. Prime,\" said Miss Harford,\nshowing by the solemnity of her voice that she regarded the subject\nas one which should by its nature repress any further joke.\n\nNor was Dr. Harford inclined to joke when he heard such tidings as\nthese. \"Mr. Prong!\" said he. \"Nonsense; who told you?\"\n\n\"Well, it was Baker told me.\" Mrs. Baker was the housekeeper at the\nBaslehurst rectory, and had been so for the last thirty years. \"She\nlearned it at Drabbit's in the High Street, where Mrs. Prime had been\nliving since she left her mother's cottage.\"\n\n\"If that's true, Comfort,\" said the doctor, \"I congratulate you on\nyour parishioner.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Prime is no parishioner of mine,\" said the vicar of Cawston.\n\"If it's true, I'm very sorry for her mother,--very sorry.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" said Mrs. Cornbury.\n\n\"Poor, wretched, unfortunate woman!\" said the doctor. \"Her little bit\nof money is all in her own hands; is it not?\"\n\n\"I believe it is,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"Ah, yes; I dare say it's true,\" said the vicar. \"She's been running\nafter him ever since he's been here. I don't doubt it's true. Poor\ncreature!--poor creature! Poor thing!\" And the doctor absolutely\nsighed as he thought of the misery in store for Mr. Prong's future\nbride. \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good,\" he said after\na while. \"He'll go off, no doubt, when he has got the money in his\nhand, and we shall be rid of him. Poor thing;--poor thing!\"\n\nBefore the evening was over Mrs. Cornbury and her father had again\ndiscussed the question of Rachel's possible engagement with Luke\nRowan. Mr. Comfort had declared his conviction that it would be\ndangerous to encourage any such hopes; whereas his daughter protested\nthat she would not see Rachel thrown over if she could help it.\n\"Don't condemn him yet, papa,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't condemn him at all, my dear; but I hardly think we shall\nsee him back at Baslehurst. And he shouldn't have gone away without\npaying his debts, Patty!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nMR. COMFORT CALLS AT THE COTTAGE.\n\n\nMrs. Ray, in her trouble occasioned by Luke's letter, had walked up\nto Mr. Comfort's house, but had not found him at home. Therefore\nshe had written to him, in his own study, a few very simple words,\ntelling the matter on which she wanted his advice. Almost any other\nwoman would have half hidden her real meaning under a cloud of\nambiguous words; but with her there was no question of hiding\nanything from her clergyman. \"Rachel has had a letter from young Mr.\nRowan,\" she said, \"and I have begged her not to answer it till I have\nshown it to you.\" So Mr. Comfort sent word down to Bragg's End that\nhe would call at the cottage, and fixed an hour for his coming. This\ntask was to be accomplished by him on the morning after Dr. Harford's\ndinner; and he had thought much of the coming conference between\nhimself and Rachel's mother while Rowan's character was being\ndiscussed at Dr. Harford's house: but on that occasion he had said\nnothing to any one, not even to his daughter, of the application\nwhich had been made to him by Mrs. Ray. At eleven o'clock he\npresented himself at the cottage door, and, of course, found Mrs.\nRay alone. Rachel had taken herself over to Mrs. Sturt, and greatly\namazed that kindhearted person by her silence and confusion. \"Why,\nmy dear,\" said Mrs. Sturt, \"you hain't got a word to-day to throw at\na dog.\" Rachel acknowledged that she had not; and then Mrs. Sturt\nallowed her to remain in her silence.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Comfort, this is so good of you!\" Mrs. Ray began as soon as\nher friend was inside the parlour. \"When I went up to the parsonage\nI didn't think of bringing you down here all the way;--I didn't\nindeed.\" Mr. Comfort assured her that he thought nothing of the\ntrouble, declared that he owed her a visit, and then asked after\nRachel.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, then, she's just stept across the green to\nMrs. Sturt's, so as to be out of the way. It's a trying time to her,\nMr. Comfort,--very; and whatever way it goes, she's a good girl,--a\nvery good girl.\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me that, Mrs. Ray.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I must. There's her sister thinks she's encouraged this\nyoung man too freely, but--\"\n\n\"By-the-by, Mrs. Ray, I've been told that Mrs. Prime is engaged to be\nmarried herself.\"\n\n\"Have you, now?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I heard it in Baslehurst yesterday;--to Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"She's kept it so close, Mr. Comfort, I didn't think anybody had\nheard it.\"\n\n\"It is true, then?\"\n\n\"I can't say she has accepted him yet. He has offered to\nher;--there's no doubt about that, Mr. Comfort,--and she hasn't said\nhim no.\"\n\n\"Do let her look sharp after her money,\" said Mr. Comfort.\n\n\"Well, that's just it. She's not a bit inclined to give it up to him,\nI can tell you.\"\n\n\"I can't say, Mrs. Ray, that the connexion is one that I like very\nmuch, in any way. There's no reason at all why your eldest daughter\nshould not marry again, but--\"\n\n\"What can I do, Mr. Comfort? Of course I know he's not just what he\nshould be,--that is, for a clergyman. When I knew he hadn't come\nfrom any of the colleges, I never had any fancy for going to hear\nhim myself. But of course I should never have left your church, Mr.\nComfort,--not if anybody had come there. And if I could have had my\nway with Dorothy, she would never have gone near him,--never. But\nwhat could I do, Mr. Comfort? Of course she can go where she likes.\"\n\n\"Mr. Prime was a gentleman and a Christian,\" said the vicar.\n\n\"That he was, Mr. Comfort; and a husband for a young woman to be\nproud of. But he was soon taken away from her--very soon! and she\nhasn't thought much of this world since.\"\n\n\"I don't know what she's thinking of now.\"\n\n\"It isn't of herself, Mr. Comfort; not a bit. Dorothy is very stern;\nbut, to give her her due, it's not herself she's thinking of.\"\n\n\"Why does she want to marry him, then?\"\n\n\"Because he's lonely without some one to do for him.\"\n\n\"Lonely!--and he should be lonely for me, Mrs. Ray.\"\n\n\"And because she says she can work in the vineyard better as a\nclergyman's wife.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! work in the vineyard, indeed! But it's no business of mine;\nand, as you say, I suppose you can't help it.\"\n\n\"Indeed I can't. She'd never think of asking me.\"\n\n\"I hope she'll look after her money, that's all. And what's all this\nabout my friend Rachel? I'd a great deal sooner hear that she was\ngoing to be married,--if I knew that the man was worthy of her.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Ray put her hand into her pocket, and taking out Rowan's\nletter, gave it to the vicar to read. As she did so, she looked into\nhis face with eyes full of the most intense anxiety. She was herself\ngreatly frightened by the magnitude of this marriage question.\nShe feared the enmity of Mrs. Rowan; and she doubted the firmness\nof Luke. She could not keep herself from reflecting that a young\nman from London was very dangerous; that he might probably be a\nwolf; that she could not be safe in trusting her one lamb into\nsuch custody. But, nevertheless, she most earnestly hoped that Mr.\nComfort's verdict might be in the young man's favour. If he would\nonly say that the young man was not a wolf,--if he would only take\nupon his own clerical shoulders the responsibility of trusting the\nyoung man,--Mrs. Ray would become for the moment one of the happiest\nwomen in Devonshire. With what a beaming face,--with what a true\njoy,--with what smiles through her tears, would she then have\nwelcomed Rachel back from the farm-house! How she would have watched\nher as she came across the green, beckoning to her eagerly, and\ntelling all her happy tale beforehand by the signs of her joy! But\nthere was to be no such happy tale as that told on this morning. She\nwatched the vicar's face as he read the letter, and soon perceived\nthat the verdict was to be given against the writer of it. I do not\nknow that Mrs. Ray was particularly quick at reading the countenances\nof men, but, in this instance, she did read the countenance of Mr.\nComfort. We, all of us, read more in the faces of those with whom we\nhold converse, than we are aware of doing. Of the truth, or want of\ntruth in every word spoken to us, we judge, in great part, by the\nface of the speaker. By the face of every man and woman seen by us,\nwhether they speak or are silent, we form a judgment,--and in nine\ncases out of ten our judgment is true. It is because our tenth\njudgment,--that judgment which has been wrong,--comes back upon us\nalways with the effects of its error, that we teach ourselves to\nsay that appearances cannot be trusted. If we did not trust them\nwe should be walking ever in doubt, in darkness, and in ignorance.\nAs Mr. Comfort read the letter, Mrs. Ray knew that it would not be\nallowed to her to speak words of happiness to Rachel on that day. She\nknew that the young man was to be set down as dangerous; but she was\nby no means aware that she was reading the vicar's face with precise\naccuracy. Mr. Comfort had been slow in his perusal, weighing the\nwords of the letter; and when he had finished it he slowly refolded\nthe paper and put it back into its envelope. \"He means what he says,\"\nsaid he, as he gave the letter back to Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Yes; I think he means what he says.\"\n\n\"But we cannot tell how long he may mean it; nor can we tell as yet\nwhether such a connection would be good for Rachel, even if he should\nremain stedfast in such meaning. If you ask me, Mrs. Ray--\"\n\n\"I do ask you, Mr. Comfort.\"\n\n\"Then I think we should all of us know more about him, before we\nallow Rachel to give him encouragement;--I do indeed.\"\n\nMrs. Ray could not quite repress in her heart a slight feeling of\nanger against the vicar. She remembered the words,--so different not\nonly in their meaning, but in the tone in which they were spoken,--in\nwhich he had sanctioned Rachel's going to the ball: \"Young people\nget to think of each other,\" he had then said, speaking with\ngood-humoured, cheery voice, as though such thinking were worthy of\nall encouragement. He had spoken then of marriage being the happiest\ncondition for both men and women, and had inquired as to Rowan's\nmeans. Every word that had then fallen from him had expressed his\nopinion that Luke Rowan was an eligible lover. But now he was named\nas though he were undoubtedly a wolf. Why had not Mr. Comfort said\nthen, at that former interview, when no harm had as yet been done,\nthat it would be desirable to know more of the young man before any\nencouragement was given to him? Mrs. Ray felt that she was injured;\nbut, nevertheless, her trust in her counsellor was not on that\naccount the less.\n\n\"I suppose it must be answered,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course it should be answered.\"\n\n\"And who should write it, Mr. Comfort?\"\n\n\"Let Rachel write it herself. Let her tell him that she is not\nprepared to correspond with him as yet, any further that is, you\nunderstand, than the writing of that letter.\"\n\n\"And about,--about,--about what he says as to loving her, you know?\nThere has been a sort of promise between them, Mr. Comfort, and no\nyoung man could have spoken more honestly than he did.\"\n\n\"And he meant honestly, no doubt; but you see, Mrs. Ray, it is\nnecessary to be so careful in these matters! It is quite evident his\nmother doesn't wish this marriage.\"\n\n\"And he shouldn't have called her a goose; should he?\"\n\n\"I don't think much about that.\"\n\n\"Don't you, now?\"\n\n\"It was all meant in good-humour. But she thinks it a bad marriage\nfor him as regards money, and money considerations always go so far,\nyou know. And then he's away, and you've got no hold upon him.\"\n\n\"That's quite true, Mr. Comfort.\"\n\n\"He has quarrelled with the people here. And upon my word I'm\ninclined to think he has not behaved very well to Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"Hasn't he, now?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Ray. They were talking about him last night in\nBaslehurst, and I'm afraid he has behaved badly at the brewery. There\nwere words between him and Mr. Tappitt,--very serious words.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know that. He told Rachel as much as that. I think he said he\nwas going to law with Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"And if so, the chances are that he may never be seen here again.\nIt's ill coming to a place where one is quarrelling with people. And\nas to the lawsuit, it seems to me, from what I hear, that he would\ncertainly lose it. No doubt he has a considerable property in the\nbrewery; but he wants to be master of everything, and that can't be\nreasonable, you know. And then, Mrs. Ray, there's worse than that\nbehind.\"\n\n\"Worse than that!\" said Mrs. Ray, in whose heart every gleam of\ncomfort was quickly being extinguished by darkening shadows.\n\n\"They tell me that he has gone away without paying his debts. If that\nis so, it shows that his means cannot be very good.\" Then why had Mr.\nComfort taken upon himself expressly to say that they were good at\nthat interview before Mrs. Tappitt's party? That was the thought in\nthe widow's mind at the present moment. Mr. Comfort, however, went\non with his caution. \"And then, when the happiness of such a girl as\nRachel is concerned, it is impossible to be too careful. Where should\nwe all be if we found that we had given her to a scamp?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear! I don't think he can be a scamp;--he did take his\ntea so nicely.\"\n\n\"I don't say he is;--I don't judge him. But then we should be\ncareful. Why didn't he pay his debts before he went away? A young man\nshould always pay his debts.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's sent it down in a money-order,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"They\nare so very convenient,--that is if you've got the money.\"\n\n\"If he hasn't I hope he will, for I can assure you I don't want to\nthink badly of him. Maybe he will turn out all right. And you may be\nsure of this, Mrs. Ray, that if he is really attached to Rachel he\nwon't give her up, because she doesn't throw herself into his arms at\nhis first word. There's nothing becomes a young woman like a little\ncaution, or makes a young man think more of her. If Rachel fancies\nthat she likes him let her hold back a while and find out what sort\nof stuff he's made of. If I were her I should just tell him that\nI thought it better to wait a little before I made any positive\nengagement.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Comfort, how is she to begin it? You see he calls her\nDearest Rachel.\"\n\n\"Let her say Dear Mr. Rowan. There can't be any harm in that.\"\n\n\"She mustn't call him Luke, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I think she'd better not. Young men think so much of those things.\"\n\n\"And she's not to say 'Yours affectionately' at the end?\"\n\n\"She'll understand all that when she comes to write the letter better\nthan we can tell her. Give her my love; and tell her from me I'm\nquite sure she's a dear, good girl, and that it must be a great\ncomfort to you to know that you can trust her so thoroughly.\" Then,\nhaving spoken these last words, Mr. Comfort took himself away.\n\nRachel, sitting in the window of Mrs. Sturt's large front kitchen on\nthe other side of the green, could see Mr. Comfort come forth from\nthe cottage and get into his low four-wheeled carriage, which, with\nhis boy in livery, had been standing at the garden gate during the\ninterview. Mrs. Sturt was away among the milk-pans, scalding cream or\npreparing butter, and did not watch either Rachel or the visitor at\nthe cottage. But she knew with tolerable accuracy what was going on,\nand with all her heart wished that her young friend might have luck\nwith her lover. Rachel waited for a minute or two till the little\ncarriage was out of sight, till the sound of the wheels could be no\nlonger heard, and then she prepared to move. She slowly got herself\nup from her chair as though she were afraid to show herself upon the\ngreen, and paused still a few moments longer before she left the\nkitchen.\n\n\"So, thou's off,\" said Mrs. Sturt, coming in from the back regions of\nher territory, with the sleeves of her gown tucked up, enveloped in a\nlarge roundabout apron which covered almost all her dress. Mrs. Sturt\nwould no more have thought of doing her work in the front kitchen\nthan I should think of doing mine in the drawing-room. \"So thou's off\nhome again, my lass,\" said Mrs. Sturt.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Sturt. Mr. Comfort has been with mamma,--about business;\nand as I didn't want to be in the way I just came over to you.\"\n\n\"Thou art welcome, as flowers in May, morning or evening; but thee\nknowest that, girl. As for Mr. Comfort,--it's cold comfort he is, I\nalways say. It's little I think of what clergymen says, unless it be\nout of the pulpit or the like of that. What does they know about lads\nand lasses?\"\n\n\"He's a very old friend of mamma's.\"\n\n\"Old friends is always best, I'll not deny that. But, look thee here,\nmy girl; my man's an old friend too. He's know'd thee since he lifted\nthee in his arms to pull the plums off that bough yonder; and he's\nseen thee these ten years a deal oftener than Mr. Comfort. If they\nsay anything wrong of thy joe there, tell me, and Sturt 'll find out\nwhether it be true or no. Don't let ere a parson in Devonshire rob\nthee of thy sweetheart. It's passing sweet, when true hearts meet.\nBut it breaks the heart, when true hearts part.\" With the salutary\nadvice contained in these ancient local lines Mrs. Sturt put her arms\nround Rachel, and having kissed her, bade her go.\n\nWith slow step she made her way across the green, hardly daring to\nlook to the door of the cottage. But there was no figure standing\nat the door; and let her have looked with all her eyes, there was\nnothing there to have told her anything. She walked very slowly,\nthinking as she went of Mrs. Sturt's words--\"Don't let ere a parson\nin Devonshire rob thee of thy sweetheart.\" Was it not hard upon her\nthat she should be subjected to the misery of such discussion, seeing\nthat she had given no hope, either to her lover or to herself, till\nshe had received full warranty for doing so? She would do what her\nmother should bid her, let it be what it might; but she would be\nwronged,--she felt that she would be wronged and injured, grievously\ninjured, if her mother should now bid her think of Rowan as one\nthinks of those that are gone.\n\nShe entered the cottage slowly, and turning into the parlour, found\nher mother seated there on the old sofa, opposite to the fireplace.\nShe was seated there in stiff composure, waiting the work which she\nhad to do. It was no customary place of hers, and she was a woman\nwho, in the ordinary occupations of her life, never deserted her\ncustomary places. She had an old easy chair near the fireplace, and\nanother smaller chair close to the window, and in one of these she\nmight always be found, unless when, on special occasions like the\npresent, some great thing had occurred to throw her out of the\ngrooves of her life.\n\n\"Well, mamma?\" said Rachel, coming in and standing before her mother.\nMrs. Ray, before she spoke, looked up into her child's face, and was\nafraid. \"Well, mamma, what has Mr. Comfort said?\"\n\nWas it not hard for Mrs. Ray that at such a moment she should have\nhad no sort of husband on whom to lean? Does the reader remember that\nin the opening words of this story Mrs. Ray was described as a woman\nwho specially needed some standing-corner, some post, some strong\nprop to bear her weight,--some marital authority by which she might\nbe guided? Such prop and such guiding she had never needed more\nsorely than she needed them now. She looked up into Rachel's face\nbefore she spoke, and was afraid. \"He has been here, my dear,\" she\nsaid, \"and has gone away.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma, I knew that,\" said Rachel. \"I saw his phaeton drive off;\nthat's why I came over from Mrs. Sturt's.\"\n\nRachel's voice was hard, and there was no comfort in it. It was so\nhard that Mrs. Ray felt it to be unkind. No doubt Rachel suffered;\nbut did not she suffer also? Would not she have given blood from her\nbreast, like the maternal pelican, to have secured from that clerical\ncounsellor a verdict that might have been comforting to her child?\nWould she not have made any sacrifice of self for such a verdict,\neven though the effecting of it must have been that she herself would\nhave been left alone and deserted in the world? Why, then, should\nRachel be stern to her? If misery was to fall on both of them, it was\nnot of her doing.\n\n\"I know you will think it's my fault, Rachel; but I cannot help it,\neven though you should say so. Of course I was obliged to ask some\none; and who else was there that would be able to tell me so well\nas Mr. Comfort? You would not have liked it at all if I had gone to\nDorothea; and as for Mr. Prong--\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma, mamma, don't! I haven't said anything. I haven't\ncomplained of Mr. Comfort. What has he said now? You forget that you\nhave not told me.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, I don't forget; I wish I could. He says that Mr. Rowan\nhas behaved badly to Mr. Tappitt, and that he hasn't paid his debts,\nand that the lawsuit will be sure to go against him, and that he will\nnever show his face in Baslehurst again; and he says, too, that it\nwould be very wrong for you to correspond with him,--very; because a\nyoung girl like you must be so careful about such things; and he says\nhe'll be much more likely to respect you if you don't,--don't,--don't\njust throw yourself into his arms like. Those were his very words;\nand then he says that if he really cares for you, he'll be sure to\ncome back again, and so you're to answer the letter, and you must\ncall him Dear Mr. Rowan. Don't call him Luke, because young men think\nso much about those things. And you are to tell him that there isn't\nto be any engagement, or any letter-writing, or anything of that sort\nat all. But you can just say something friendly,--about hoping he's\nquite well, or something of that kind. And then when you come to the\nend, you had better sign yourself 'Yours truly.' It won't do to say\nanything about affection, because one never knows how it may turn\nout. And,--let me see; there was only one thing more. Mr. Comfort\nsays that you are a good girl, and that he is sure you have done\nnothing wrong,--not even in a word or a thought; and I say so too.\nYou are my own beautiful child; and, Rachel,--I do so wish I could\nmake it all right between you.\"\n\nNobody can deny that Mrs. Ray had given, with very fair accuracy, an\nepitome of Mr. Comfort's words; but they did not leave upon Rachel's\nmind a very clear idea of what she was expected to do. \"Go away in\ndebt!\" she said; \"who says so?\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort told me so just now. But perhaps he'll send the money in\na money-order, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would go away in debt. And why should the lawsuit\ngo against him if he's got right on his side? He does not wish to do\nany harm to Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, my dear; but at any rate they've\nquarrelled.\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't that be Mr. Tappitt's fault as much as his? And as\nfor not showing his face in Baslehurst--! Oh, mamma! don't you know\nhim well enough to be sure that he will never be ashamed of showing\nhis face anywhere? He not show his face! Mamma, I don't believe a\nword of it all,--not a word.\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort said so; he did indeed.\" Then Mrs. Sturt's words came\nback upon Rachel. \"Don't let ere a parson in Devonshire rob thee of\nthy sweetheart.\" This lover of hers was her only possession,--the\nonly thing of her own winning that she had ever valued. He was her\ngreat triumph, the rich upshot of her own prowess,--and now she felt\nthat this parson was indeed robbing her. Had he been then present,\nshe would have risen up and spoken at him, as she had never spoken\nbefore. The spirit of rebellion against all the world was strong\nwithin her;--against all the world except that one weak woman who now\nsat before her on the sofa. Her eyes were full of anger, and Mrs. Ray\nsaw that it was so; but still she was minded to obey her mother.\n\n\"It's no good talking,\" said Rachel; \"but when they say that he's\nafraid to show himself in Baslehurst, I don't believe them. Does he\nlook like a man afraid to show himself?\"\n\n\"Looks are so deceitful, Rachel.\"\n\n\"And as for debts,--people, if they're called away by telegraph in a\nminute, can't pay all that they owe. There are plenty of people in\nBaslehurst that owe a deal more than he does, I'm sure. And he's got\nhis share in the brewery, so that nobody need be afraid.\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort didn't say that you were to quarrel with him\naltogether.\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort! What's Mr. Comfort to me, mamma?\" This was said in such\na tone that Mrs. Ray absolutely started up from her seat.\n\n\"But, Rachel, he is my oldest friend. He was your father's friend.\"\n\n\"Why did he not say it before, then? Why--why--why--? Mamma, I can't\nthrow him off now. Didn't I tell him that,--that,--that I would--love\nhim? Didn't you say that it might be so,--you yourself? How am I to\nshow my face, if I go back now? Mamma, I do love him, with all my\nheart and all my strength, and nothing that anybody can say can make\nany difference. If he owed ever so much money I should love him the\nsame. If he had killed Mr. Tappitt it wouldn't make any difference.\"\n\n\"Oh, Rachel!\"\n\n\"No more it would. If Mr. Tappitt began it first, it wasn't his\nfault.\"\n\n\"But Rachel, my darling,--what can we do? If he has gone away we\ncannot make him come back again.\"\n\n\"But he wrote almost immediately.\"\n\n\"And you are going to answer it;--are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes;--but what sort of an answer, mamma? How can I expect that he\nwill ever want to see me again when I have written to him in that\nway? I won't say anything about hoping that he's very well. If I may\nnot tell him that he's my own, own, own Luke, and that I love him\nwith all my heart, I'll bid him stay away and not trouble himself any\nfurther. I wonder what he'll think of me when I write in that way!\"\n\n\"If he's constant-hearted he'll wait a while and then he'll come back\nagain.\"\n\n\"Why should he come back when I've treated him in that way? What have\nI got to give him? Mamma, you may write the letter yourself, and put\nin it what you please.\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort said that you had better write it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Comfort! I don't know why I'm to do all that Mr. Comfort tells\nme,\" and then those other words of Mrs. Sturt's recurred to her,\n\"It's little I think of what a clergyman says unless it be out of a\npulpit.\" After that there was nothing further said for some minutes.\nMrs. Ray still sat on the sofa, and as she gazed upon the table\nwhich stood in the middle of the room, she wiped her eyes with her\nhandkerchief. Rachel was now seated in a chair with her back almost\nturned to her mother, and was beating with her impatient fingers on\nthe table. She was very angry,--angry even with her mother; and she\nwas half broken-hearted, truly believing that such a letter as that\nwhich she was desired to write would estrange her lover from her for\never. So they sat, and for a few minutes no word was spoken between\nthem.\n\n\"Rachel,\" said Mrs. Ray at last, \"if wrong has been done, is it not\nbetter that it should be undone?\"\n\n\"What wrong have I done?\" said Rachel, jumping up.\n\n\"It is I that have done it,--not you.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; you have done no wrong.\"\n\n\"I should have known more before I let him come here and encouraged\nyou to think of him. It has been my fault. My dear, will you not\nforgive me?\"\n\n\"Mamma, there has been no fault. There is nothing to forgive.\"\n\n\"I have made you unhappy, my child,\" and then Mrs. Ray burst out into\nopen tears.\n\n\"No, mamma, I won't be unhappy;--or if I am I will bear it.\" Then she\ngot up and threw her arms round her mother's neck, and embraced her.\n\"I will write the letter, but I will not write it now. You shall see\nit before it goes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nSHOWING WHAT RACHEL RAY THOUGHT WHEN SHE SAT ON THE STILE,\nAND HOW SHE WROTE HER LETTER AFTERWARDS.\n\n\nRachel, as soon as she had made her mother the promise that she would\nwrite the letter, left the parlour and went up to her own room. She\nhad many thoughts to adjust in her mind which could not be adjusted\nsatisfactorily otherwise than in solitude, and it was clearly\nnecessary that they should be adjusted before she could write her\nletter. It must be remembered, not only that she had never before\nwritten a letter to a lover, but that she had never before written\na letter of importance to any one. She had threatened at one moment\nthat she would leave the writing of it to her mother; but there came\nupon her a feeling, of which she was hardly conscious, that she\nherself might probably compose the letter in a strain of higher\ndignity than her mother would be likely to adopt. That her lover\nwould be gone from her for ever she felt almost assured; but still it\nwould be much to her that, on going, he should so leave her that his\nrespect might remain, though his love would be a thing of the past.\nIn her estimation he was a noble being, to have been loved by whom\neven for a few days was more honour than she had ever hoped to win.\nFor a few days she had been allowed to think that her great fortune\nintended him to be her husband. But Fate had interposed, and now\nshe feared that all her joy was at an end. But her joy should be so\nrelinquished that she herself should not be disgraced in the giving\nof it up. She sat there alone for an hour, and was stronger, when\nthat hour was over, than she had been when she left her mother. Her\npride had supported her, and had been sufficient for her support in\nthat first hour of her sorrow. It is ever so with us in our misery.\nIn the first flush of our wretchedness, let the outward signs of our\ngrief be what they may, we promise to ourselves the support of some\ninner strength which shall suffice to us at any rate as against the\neyes of the outer world. But anon, and that inner staff fails us; our\npride yields to our tears; our dignity is crushed beneath the load\nwith which we have burdened it, and then with loud wailings we own\nourselves to be the wretches which we are. But now Rachel was in the\nhour of her pride, and as she came down from her room she resolved\nthat her sorrow should be buried in her own bosom. She had known what\nit was to love,--had known it, perhaps, for one whole week,--and now\nthat knowledge was never to avail her again. Among them all she had\nbeen robbed of her sweetheart. She had been bidden to give her heart\nto this man,--her heart and hand; and now, when she had given all her\nheart, she was bidden to refuse her hand. She had not ventured to\nlove till her love had been sanctioned. It had been sanctioned, and\nshe had loved; and now that sanction was withdrawn! She knew that she\nwas injured,--deeply, cruelly injured, but she would bear it, showing\nnothing, and saying nothing. With this resolve she came down from her\nroom, and began to employ herself on her household work.\n\nMrs. Ray watched her carefully, and Rachel knew that she was watched;\nbut she took no outward notice of it, going on with her work, and\nsaying a soft, gentle word now and again, sometimes to her mother,\nand sometimes to the little maiden who attended them. \"Will you come\nto dinner, mamma?\" she said with a smile, taking her mother by the\nhand.\n\n\"I shouldn't mind if I never sat down to dinner again,\" said Mrs.\nRay.\n\n\"Oh, mamma! don't say that; just when you are going to thank God for\nthe good things he gives you.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Ray, in a low voice, as though rebuked, said the grace, and\nthey sat down together to their meal.\n\nThe afternoon went with them very slowly and almost in silence.\nNeither of them would now speak about Luke Rowan; and to neither of\nthem was it as yet possible to speak about aught else. One word on\nthe subject was said during those hours. \"You won't have time for\nyour letter after tea,\" Mrs. Ray said.\n\n\"I shall not write it till to-morrow,\" Rachel answered; \"another day\nwill do no harm now.\"\n\nAt tea Mrs. Ray asked her whether she did not think that a walk would\ndo her good, and offered to accompany her; but Rachel, acceding to\nthe proposition of the walk, declared that she would go alone. \"It's\nvery bad of me to say so, isn't it, when you're so good as to offer\nto go with me?\" But Mrs. Ray kissed her; saying, with many words,\nthat she was satisfied that it should be so. \"You want to think of\nthings, I know,\" said the mother. Rachel acknowledged, by a slight\nmotion of her head, that she did want to think of things, and soon\nafter that she started.\n\n\"I believe I'll call on Dolly,\" she said. \"It would be bad to\nquarrel with her; and perhaps now she'll come back here to live with\nus;--only I forgot about Mr. Prong.\" It was agreed, however, that she\nshould call on her sister, and ask her to dine at the cottage on the\nfollowing day.\n\nShe walked along the road straight into Baslehurst, and went at once\nto her sister's lodgings. She had another place to visit before she\nreturned home, but it was a place for which a later hour in the\nevening would suit her better. Mrs. Prime was at home; and Rachel,\non being shown up into the sitting-room,--a room in which every\npiece of furniture had become known to her during those Dorcas\nmeetings,--found not only her sister sitting there, but also Miss\nPucker and Mr. Prong. Rachel had not seen that gentleman since she\nhad learned that he was to become her brother-in-law, and hardly knew\nin what way to greet him; but it soon became apparent to her that no\noutward show of regard was expected from her at that moment.\n\n\"I think you know my sister, Mr. Prong,\" said Dorothea. Whereupon\nMr. Prong rose from his chair, took Rachel's hand, pressing it\nbetween his own, and then sat down again. Rachel, judging from his\ncountenance, thought that some cloud had passed also across the\nsunlight of his love. She made her little speech, giving her mother's\nlove, and adding her own assurance that she hoped her sister would\ncome out and dine at the cottage.\n\n\"I really don't know,\" said Mrs. Prime. \"Such goings about do cut up\none's time so much. I shouldn't be here again till--\"\n\n\"Of course you'd stay for tea with us,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"And lose the whole afternoon!\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"Oh do!\" said Miss Pucker. \"You have been working so hard; hasn't she\nnow, Mr. Prong? At this time of the year a sniff of fresh air among\nthe flowers does do a body so much good.\" And Miss Pucker looked and\nspoke as though she also would like the sniff of fresh air.\n\n\"I'm very well in health, and am thankful for it. I can't say that\nit's needed in that way,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"But mamma will be so glad to see you,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"I think you ought to go, Dorothea,\" said Mr. Prong; and even Rachel\ncould perceive that there was some slight touch of authority in his\nvoice. It was the slightest possible intonation of a command; but,\nnevertheless, it struck Rachel's ears.\n\nMrs. Prime merely shook her head and sniffed. It was not for a supply\nof air that she used her nostrils on this occasion, but that she\nmight indicate some grain of contempt for the authority which Mr.\nProng had attempted to exercise. \"I think I'd rather not, Rachel,\nthank you;--not to dinner, that is. Perhaps I'll walk out in the\nevening after tea, when the work of the day is over. If I come then,\nperhaps my friend, Miss Pucker, may come with me.\"\n\n\"And if your esteemed mamma will allow me to pay my respects,\" said\nMr. Prong, \"I shall be most happy to accompany the ladies.\"\n\nIt will be acknowledged that Rachel had no alternative left to her.\nShe said that her mother would be happy to see Mr. Prong, and happy\nto see Miss Pucker also. As to herself, she made no such assertion,\nbeing in her present mood too full of her own thoughts to care much\nfor the ordinary courtesies of life.\n\n\"I'm very sorry you won't come to dinner, Dolly,\" she said; but she\nabstained from any word of asking the others to tea.\n\n\"If it had only been Mr. Prong,\" she said to her mother afterwards,\n\"I should have asked him; for I suppose he'll have to come to the\nhouse sooner or later. But I wouldn't tell that horrid, squinting\nwoman that you wanted to see her, for I'm sure you don't.\"\n\n\"But we must give them some cake and a glass of sweet wine,\" said\nMrs. Ray.\n\n\"She won't have to take her bonnet off for that as she would for tea,\nand it isn't so much like making herself at home here. I couldn't\nbear to have to ask her up to my room.\"\n\nOn leaving the house in the High Street, which she did about eight\no'clock, she took her way towards the churchyard,--not passing down\nBrewery Lane, by Mr. Tappitt's house, but taking the main street\nwhich led from the High Street to the church. But at the corner, just\nas she was about to leave the High Street, she was arrested by a\nvoice that was familiar to her, and, turning round, she saw Mrs.\nCornbury seated in a low carriage, and driving a pair of ponies.\n\"How are you, Rachel?\" said Mrs. Cornbury, shaking hands with her\nfriend, for Rachel had gone out into the street up to the side of the\ncarriage, when she found that Mrs. Cornbury had stopped. \"I'm going\nby the cottage,--to papa's. I see you are turning the other way; but\nif you've not much delay, I'll stay for you and take you home.\"\n\nBut Rachel had before her that other visit to make, and she was not\nminded either to omit it or postpone it. \"I should like it so much,\"\nsaid Rachel, \"only--\"\n\n\"Ah! well; I see. You've got other fish to fry. But, Rachel, look\nhere, dear.\" And Mrs. Cornbury almost whispered into her ear across\nthe side of the pony carriage. \"Don't you believe quite all you hear.\nI'll find out the truth, and you shall know. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Cornbury,\" said Rachel, pressing her friend's hand as\nshe parted from her. This allusion to her lover had called a blush\nup over her whole face, so that Mrs. Cornbury well knew that she had\nbeen understood. \"I'll see to it,\" she said, driving away her ponies.\n\nSee to it! How could she see to it when that letter should have been\nwritten? And Rachel was well aware that another day must not pass\nwithout the writing of it.\n\nShe went down across the churchyard, leaving the path to the brewery\non her left, and that leading out under the elm trees to her right,\nand went on straight to the stile at which she had stood with Luke\nRowan, watching the reflection of the setting sun among the clouds.\nThis was the spot which she had determined to visit; and she had come\nhither hoping that she might again see some form in the heavens which\nmight remind her of that which he had shown her. The stile, at any\nrate, was the same, and there were the trees beneath which they had\nstood. There were the rich fields, lying beneath her, over which they\ntwo had gazed together at the fading lights of the evening. There was\nno arm in the clouds now, and the perverse sun was retiring to his\nrest without any of that royal pageantry and illumination with which\nthe heavens are wont to deck themselves when their king goes to his\ncouch. But Rachel, though she had come thither to look for these\nthings and had not found them, hardly marked their absence. Her mind\nbecame so full of him and of his words, that she required no outward\nsigns to refresh her memory. She thought so much of his look on that\nevening, of the tones of his voice, and of every motion of his body,\nthat she soon forgot to watch the clouds. She sat herself down upon\nthe stile with her face turned away from the fields, telling herself\nthat she would listen for the footsteps of strangers, so that she\nmight move away if any came near her; but she soon forgot also to\nlisten, and sat there thinking of him alone. The words that had been\nspoken between them on that occasion had been but trifling,--very few\nand of small moment; but now they seemed to her to have contained\nall her destiny. It was there that love for him had first come upon\nher--had come over her with broad outspread wings like an angel;\nbut whether as an angel of darkness or of light, her heart had then\nbeen unable to perceive. How well she remembered it all; how he had\ntaken her by the hand, claiming the right of doing so as an ordinary\nfarewell greeting; and how he had held her, looking into her face,\ntill she had been forced to speak some word of rebuke to him! \"I did\nnot think you would behave like that,\" she had said. But yet at that\nvery moment her heart was going from her. The warm friendliness of\nhis touch, the firm, clear brightness of his eye, and the eager tone\nof his voice, were even then subduing her coy unwillingness to part\nwith her maiden love. She had declared to herself then that she was\nangry with him; but, since that, she had declared to herself that\nnothing could have been better, finer, sweeter than all that he had\nsaid and done on that evening. It had been his right to hold her, if\nhe intended afterwards to claim her as his own. \"I like you so very\nmuch,\" he had said; \"why should we not be friends?\" She had gone away\nfrom him then, fleeing along the path, bewildered, ignorant as to\nher own feelings, conscious almost of a sin in having listened to\nhim; but still filled with a wondrous delight that any one so good,\nso beautiful, so powerful as he, should have cared to ask for her\nfriendship in such pressing words. During all her walk home she had\nbeen full of fear and wonder and mysterious delight. Then had come\nthe ball, which in itself had hardly been so pleasant to her, because\nthe eyes of many had watched her there. But she thought of the moment\nwhen he had first come to her in Mrs. Tappitt's drawing-room, just as\nshe was resolving that he did not intend to notice her further. She\nthought of those repeated dances which had been so dear to her, but\nwhich, in their repetition, had frightened her so grievously. She\nthought of the supper, during which he had insisted on sitting by\nher; and of that meeting in the hall, during which he had, as it\nwere, forced her to remain and listen to him,--forced her to stay\nwith him till, in her agony of fear, she had escaped away to her\nfriend and begged that she might be taken home! As she sat by Mrs.\nCornbury in the carriage, and afterwards as she had thought of it all\nwhile lying in her bed, she had declared to herself that he had been\nvery wrong;--but since that, during those few days of her permitted\nlove, she had sworn to herself as often that he had been very right.\n\nAnd he had been right. She said so to herself now again, though\nthe words which he had spoken and the things which he had done had\nbrought upon her all this sorrow. He had been right. If he loved\nher it was only manly and proper in him to tell his love. And for\nherself,--seeing that she had loved, had it not been proper and\nwomanly in her to declare her love? What had she done; when, at what\npoint, had she gone astray, that she should be brought to such a pass\nas this? At the beginning, when he had held her hand on the spot\nwhere she was now sitting, and again when he had kept her prisoner\nin Mr. Tappitt's hall, she had been half conscious of some sin, half\nashamed of her own conduct; but that undecided fear of sin and shame\nhad been washed out, and everything had been made white as snow, as\npure as running water, as bright as sunlight, by the permission to\nlove this man which had been accorded to her. What had she since done\nthat she should be brought to such a pass as that in which she now\nfound herself?\n\nAs she thought of this she was bitter against all the world except\nhim;--almost bitter against her own mother. She had said that she\nwould obey in this matter of the letter, and she knew well that\nshe would in truth do as her mother bade her. But, sitting there,\non the churchyard stile, she hatched within her mind plans of\ndisobedience,--dreadful plans! She would not submit to this usage.\nShe would go away from Baslehurst without knowledge of any one, and\nwould seek him out in his London home. It would be unmaidenly;--but\nwhat cared she now for that;--unless, indeed, he should care? All her\nvirgin modesty and young maiden fears,--was it not for him that she\nwould guard them, for his delight and his pride? And if she were to\nsee him no more, if she were to be forced to bid him go from her,\nof what avail would it be now to her to cherish and maintain the\nunsullied brightness of her woman's armour? If he were lost to her,\neverything was lost. She would go to him, and throwing herself at\nhis feet would swear to him that life without his love was no longer\npossible for her. If he would then take her as his wife she would\nstrive to bless him with all that the tenderness of a wife could\ngive. If he should refuse her,--then she would go away and die. In\nsuch case what to her would be the judgment of any man or any woman?\nWhat to her would be her sister's scorn and the malignant virtue\nof such as Miss Pucker and Mr. Prong? What the upturned hands and\namazement of Mr. Comfort? It would have been they who had driven her\nto this.\n\nBut how about her mother when she should have thus thrown herself\noverboard from the ship and cast herself away from the pilotage which\nhad hitherto been the guide of her conduct? Why--why--why had her\nmother deserted her in her need? As she thought of her mother she\nknew that her plan of rebellion was nothing; but why--why had her\nmother deserted her?\n\nAs for him, and these new tidings which had come to the cottage\nrespecting him, she would have cared for them not a jot. Mrs.\nCornbury had cautioned her not to believe all that she heard; but she\nhad already declined,--had altogether declined to believe any of it.\nIt was to her, whether believed or disbelieved, matter altogether\nirrelevant. A wife does not cease to love her husband because he\ngets into trouble. She does not turn against him because others have\nquarrelled with him. She does not separate her lot from his because\nhe is in debt! Those are the times when a wife, a true wife, sticks\nclosest to her husband, and strives the hardest to lighten the weight\nof his cares by the tenderness of her love! And had she not been\npermitted to place herself in that position with regard to him\nwhen she had been permitted to love him? In all her thoughts she\nrecognized the right of her mother to have debarred her from the\nprivilege of loving this man, if such embargo had been placed on her\nbefore her love had been declared. She had never, even within her\nown bosom, assumed to herself the right of such privilege without\nauthority expressed. But her very soul revolted against this\nwithdrawal of the sanction that had been given to her. The spirit\nwithin her rebelled, though she knew that she would not carry on that\nrebellion by word or deed. But she had been injured;--injured almost\nto death; injured even to death itself as regarded all that life\ncould give her worth her taking! As she thought of this injury that\nfierce look of which I have spoken came across her brow! She would\nobey her pastors and masters. Yes; she would obey them. But she could\nnever again be soft and pliable within their hands. Obedience in\nthis matter was a necessity to her. In spite of that wild thought\nof throwing off her maiden bonds and allowing her female armour to\nbe splashed and sullied in the gutter, she knew that there was that\nwhich would hinder her from the execution of such scheme. She was\nbound by her woman's lot to maintain her womanly purity. Let her\nsuffer as she might there was nothing for her but obedience. She\ncould not go forth as though she were a man, and claim her right to\nstand or fall by her love. She had been injured in being brought to\nsuch plight as this, but she would bear her injury as best might be\nwithin her power.\n\nShe was still thinking of all this, and still sitting with her eyes\nturned towards the tower of the church, when she was touched on\nthe back by a light hand. She turned round quickly, startled by\nthe touch,--for she had heard no footstep,--and saw Martha Tappitt\nand Cherry. It was Cherry who had come close upon her, and it was\nCherry's voice that she first heard. \"A penny for your thoughts,\"\nsaid Cherry.\n\n\"Oh, you have so startled me!\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Then I suppose your thoughts were worth more than a penny. Perhaps\nyou were thinking of an absent knight.\" And then Cherry began to\nsing--\"Away, away, away. He loves and he rides away.\"\n\nPoor Rachel blushed and was unable to speak. \"Don't be so foolish,\"\nsaid Martha to her sister. \"It's ever so long since we've seen you,\nRachel. Why don't you come and walk with us?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,--why don't you?\" said Cherry, whose good-nature was\nquite as conspicuous as her bad taste. She knew now that she had\nvexed Rachel, and was thoroughly sorry that she had done so. If any\nother girl had quizzed her about her lover it would not have annoyed\nher, and she had not understood at first that Rachel Ray might be\ndifferent from herself. \"I declare we have hardly seen you since the\nnight of the party, and we think it very ill-natured in you not to\ncome to us. Do come and walk to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you;--not to-morrow, because my sister is coming out from\nBaslehurst, to spend the evening with us.\"\n\n\"Well;--on Saturday, then,\" said Cherry, persistingly.\n\nBut Rachel would make no promise to walk with them on any day. She\nfelt that she must henceforth be divided from the Tappitts. Had not\nhe quarrelled with Mr. Tappitt; and could it be fitting that she\nshould keep up any friendship with the family that was hostile to\nhim? She was also aware that Mrs. Tappitt was among those who were\ndesirous of robbing her of her lover. Mrs. Tappitt was her enemy as\nMr. Tappitt was his. She asked herself no question as to that duty of\nforgiving them the injuries they had done her, but she felt that she\nwas divided from them,--from Mr. and Mrs. Tappitt, and also from the\ngirls. And, moreover, in her present strait she wanted no friend. She\ncould not talk to any friend about her lover, and she could not bring\nherself even to think on any other subject.\n\n\"It's late,\" she said, \"and I must go home, as mamma will be\nexpecting me.\"\n\nCherry had almost replied that she had not been in so great a hurry\nonce before, when she had stood in the churchyard with another\ncompanion; but she thought of Rachel's reproachful face when her last\nlittle joke had been uttered, and she refrained.\n\n\"She's over head and ears in love,\" said Cherry to her sister, when\nRachel was gone.\n\n\"I'm afraid she has been very foolish,\" said Martha, seriously.\n\n\"I don't see that she has been foolish at all. He's a very nice\nfellow, and as far as I can see he's just as fond of her as she is of\nhim.\"\n\n\"But we know what that means with young men,\" said Martha, who was\nsufficiently serious in her way of thinking to hold by that doctrine\nas to wolves in sheep's clothing in which Mrs. Ray had been educated.\n\n\"But young men do marry,--sometimes,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"But not merely for the sake of a pretty face or a good figure. I\nbelieve mamma is right in that, and I don't think he'll come back\nagain.\"\n\n\"If he were my lover I'd have him back,\" said Cherry, stoutly;--and\nso they went away to the brewery.\n\nRachel on her way home determined that she would write her letter\nthat night. Her mother was to read it when it was written; that was\nunderstood to be the agreement between them; but there would be no\nreason why she should not be alone when she wrote it. She could word\nit very differently, she thought, if she sat alone over it in her own\nbedroom, than she could do immediately under her mother's eye. She\ncould not pause and think and perhaps weep over it, sitting at the\nparlour table, with her mother in her arm-chair, close by, watching\nher. It needed that she should write it with tears, with many\nstruggles, with many baffled attempts to find the words that would\nbe wanted,--with her very heart's blood. It must not be tender. No;\nshe was prepared to omit all tenderness. And it must probably be\nshort;--but if so its very shortness would be another difficulty. As\nshe walked along she could not tell herself with what words she would\nwrite it; but she thought that the words would perhaps come to her if\nshe waited long enough for them in the solitude of her own chamber.\n\nShe reached home by nine o'clock and sat with her mother for an hour,\nreading out loud some book on which they were then engaged.\n\n\"I think I'll go to bed now, mamma,\" she said.\n\n\"You always want to go to bed so soon,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"I think you\nare getting tired of reading out loud. That will be very sad for me\nwith my eyes.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not, mamma, and I'll go on again for half an hour, if you\nplease; but I thought you liked going to bed at ten.\"\n\nThe watch was consulted, and as it was not quite ten Rachel did go on\nfor another half-hour, and then she went up to her bedroom.\n\nShe sat herself down at her open window and looked out for a while\nupon the heavens. The summer moon was at its full, so that the green\nbefore the cottage was as clear before her as in the day, and she\ncould see over into the gloom of Mr. Sturt's farmyard across it. She\nhad once watched Rowan as he came over the turf towards the cottage\nswinging his stick in his hand, and now she gazed on the spot where\nthe Baslehurst road came in as though she expected that his figure\nmight again appear. She looked and looked, thinking of this, till she\nwould hardly have been surprised had that figure really come forth\nupon the road. But no figure was to be seen, and after awhile she\nwithdrew from the window and sat herself down at the little table.\nIt was very late when she undressed herself and went to her bed,\nand later still when her eyes, red with many tears, were closed\nin sleep;--but the letter had been written and was ready for her\nmother's inspection. This was the letter as it stood after many\nstruggles in the writing of it,--\n\n\n   Bragg's End,\n   Thursday, 186--\n\n   MY DEAR MR. ROWAN,\n\n   I am much obliged to you for having written the letter\n   which I received from you the other day, and I should have\n   answered it sooner, only mamma thought it best to see Mr.\n   Comfort first, as he is our clergyman here, and to ask his\n   advice. I hope you will not be annoyed because I showed\n   your letter to mamma, but I could not receive any letter\n   from you without doing so, and I may as well tell you that\n   she will read this before it goes.\n\n   And now that I have begun I hardly know how to write what\n   I have to say. Mr. Comfort and mamma have determined that\n   there must be nothing fixed as an engagement between us,\n   and that for the present, at least, I may not correspond\n   with you. This will be my first and last letter. As that\n   will be so, of course I shall not expect you to write any\n   more, and I know that you will be very angry. But if you\n   understood all my feelings I think that perhaps you would\n   not be very, very angry. I know it is true that when you\n   asked me that question, I nodded my head as you say in\n   your letter. If I had sworn the twenty oaths of which you\n   speak they would not, as you say, have bound me tighter.\n   But neither could bind me to anything against mamma's\n   will. I thought that you were very generous to come to me\n   as you did;--oh, so generous! I don't know why you should\n   have looked to such a one as me to be your wife. But I\n   would have done my best to make you happy, had I been able\n   to do as I suppose you then wished me. But you well know\n   that a man is very different from a girl, and of course I\n   must do as mamma wishes.\n\n   They say that as the business here about the brewery is so\n   very unsettled they think it probable that you will not\n   have to come back to Baslehurst any more; and that as our\n   acquaintance has been so very short, it is not reasonable\n   to suppose that you will care much about me after a little\n   while. Perhaps it is not reasonable, and after this I\n   shall have no right to be angry with you if you forget me.\n   I don't think you will quite forget me; but I shall never\n   expect or even hope to see you again.\n\nTwice in writing her letter Rachel cut out this latter assertion, but\nat last, sobbing in despair, she restored the words. What right would\nshe have to hope that he would come to her, after she had taken upon\nherself to break that promise which had been conveyed to him, when\nshe bent her head over his arm?\n\n   I shall not forget you, and I will always be your friend,\n   as you said I should be. Being friends is very different\n   to anything else, and nobody can say that I may not do\n   that.\n\n   I will always remember what you showed me in the clouds;\n   and, indeed, I went there this very evening to see if I\n   could see another arm. But there was nothing there, and I\n   have taken that as an omen that you will not come back to\n   Baslehurst.--\n\n\"To me,\" had been the words as she had first written them; but there\nwas tenderness in those words, and she found it necessary to alter\nthem.\n\n   I will now say good-bye to you, for I have told you all\n   that I have to tell. Mamma desires that I will remember\n   her to you kindly.\n\n   May God bless you and protect you always!\n\n   Believe me to be\n   Your sincere friend,\n\n   RACHEL RAY.\n\n\nIn the morning she took down the letter in her hand and gave it to\nher mother. Mrs. Ray read it very slowly and demurred over it at\nsundry places. She especially demurred at that word about the omen,\nand even declared that it ought to be expunged. But Rachel was very\nstern and held her ground. She had put into the letter, she said, all\nthat she had been bidden to say. Such a word from herself to one who\nhad been so dear to her must be allowed to her.\n\nThe letter was not altered and was taken away by the postman that\nevening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMRS. RAY GOES TO EXETER, AND MEETS A FRIEND.\n\n\nSix weeks passed over them at Bragg's End, and nothing was heard of\nLuke Rowan. Rachel's letter, a copy of which was given in our last\nchapter, was duly sent away by the postman, but no answer to it came\nto Bragg's End. It must, however, be acknowledged that it not only\nrequired no answer, but that it even refused to be answered. Rachel\nhad told her lover that he was not to correspond with her, and that\nshe certainly would not write to him again. Having so said, she had\nno right to expect an answer; and she protested over and over again\nthat she did expect none. But still she would watch, as she thought\nunseen, for the postman's coming; and her heart would sink within her\nas the man would pass the gate without calling. \"He has taken me at\nmy word,\" she said to herself very bitterly. \"I deserve nothing else\nfrom him; but--but--but--\" In those days she was ever silent and\nstern. She did all that her mother bade her, but she did little or\nnothing from love. There were no more banquets, with clotted cream\nbrought over from Mrs. Sturt's. She would speak a word or two now and\nthen to Mrs. Sturt, who understood the whole case perfectly; but such\nwords were spoken on chance occasions, for Rachel now never went over\nto the farm. Farmer Sturt's assistance had been offered to her; but\nwhat could the farmer do for her in such trouble as hers?\n\nDuring the whole of these six weeks she did her household duties;\nbut gradually she became slower in them and still more slow, and\nher mother knew that her disappointment was becoming the source of\npermanent misery. Rachel never said that she was ill; nor, indeed,\nof any special malady did she show signs: but gradually she became\nthin and wan, her cheeks assumed a haggard look, and that aspect of\nthe brow which her mother feared had become habitual to her. Mrs.\nRay observed her closely in all that she did. She knew well of those\nwatchings for the postman. She was always thinking of her child, and,\nafter a while, longing that Luke Rowan might come back to them, with\na heart almost as sore with longing as was that of Rachel herself.\nBut what could she do? She could not bring him back. In all that\nshe had done,--in giving her sanction to this lover, and again in\nwithdrawing it, she had been guided by the advice of her clergyman.\nShould she go again to him and beg him to restore that young man to\nthem? Ah! no; great as was her trust in her clergyman she knew that\neven he could not do that for her.\n\nDuring all these weeks hardly a word was spoken openly between\nthe mother and daughter about the matter that chiefly occupied\nthe thoughts of them both. Luke Rowan's name was hardly mentioned\nbetween them. Once or twice some allusion was made to the subject of\nthe brewery, for it was becoming generally known that the lawyers\nwere already at work on behalf of Rowan's claim; but even on such\noccasions as these Mrs. Ray found that her speech was stopped by the\nexpression of Rachel's eyes, and by those two lines which on such\noccasions would mark her forehead. In those days Mrs. Ray became\nafraid of her younger daughter,--almost more so than she had ever\nbeen afraid of the elder one. Rachel, indeed, never spoke as Mrs.\nPrime would sometimes speak. No word of scolding ever passed her\nmouth; and in all that she did she was gentle and observant. But\nthere was ever on her countenance that look of reproach which by\ndegrees was becoming almost unendurable. And then her words during\nthe day were so few! She was so anxious to sit alone in her own room!\nShe would still read to her mother for some hours in the evening;\nbut this reading was to her so manifestly a task, difficult and\ndistasteful!\n\nIt may be remembered that Mrs. Prime, with her lover, Mr. Prong, and\nher friend Miss Pucker, had promised to call at Bragg's End on the\nevening after Rachel's walk into Baslehurst. They did come as they\nhad promised, about half an hour after Rachel's letter to Luke had\nbeen carried away by the postman. They had come, and had remained at\nBragg's End for an hour, eating cake and drinking currant wine, but\nnot having, on the whole, what our American friends call a good time\nof it. That visit had been terrible to Mrs. Ray. Rachel had sat there\ncold, hard, and speechless. Not only had she not asked Miss Pucker\nto take off her bonnet, but she had absolutely declined to speak\nto that lady. It was wonderful to her mother that she should thus,\nin so short a time, have become wilful, masterful, and resolved in\nfollowing out her own purposes. Not one word on that occasion did\nshe speak to Miss Pucker; and Mrs. Prime, observing this, had grown\nblack and still blacker, till the horror of the visit had become\nterrible to Mrs. Ray. Miss Pucker had grinned and smiled, and striven\ngallantly, poor woman, to make the best of it. She had declared how\nglad she had been to see Miss Rachel on the previous evening, and how\nwell Miss Rachel had looked, and had expressed quite voluminous hopes\nthat Miss Rachel would come to their Dorcas meetings. But to all this\nRachel answered not a syllable. Now and then she addressed a word\nor two to her sister. Now and then she spoke to her mother. When Mr.\nProng specially turned himself to her, asking her some question, she\nwould answer him with one or two monosyllables, always calling him\nSir; but to Miss Pucker she never once opened her mouth. Mrs. Prime\nbecame very angry,--very black and very angry; and the time of the\nvisit was a terrible time to Mrs. Ray.\n\nBut this visit is to be noticed in our story chiefly on account of\na few words which Mr. Prong found an opportunity of saying to Mrs.\nRay respecting his proposed marriage. Mrs. Ray knew that there were\ndifficulties about the money, and was disposed to believe, and\nperhaps to hope, that the match would be broken off. But on this\noccasion Mr. Prong was very marked in his way of speaking to Mrs.\nRay, as though everything were settled. Mrs. Ray was thoroughly\nconvinced by this that it was so, and her former beliefs and possible\nhopes were all dispersed. But then Mrs. Ray was easily convinced by\nany assertion. In thus speaking to his future mother-in-law he had\ncontrived to turn his back round upon the other three ladies, so as\nto throw them together for the time, and thus make their position\nthe more painful. It must be acknowledged that Rachel was capable of\nsomething great, after her determined resistance to Miss Pucker's\nblandishments under such circumstances as these.\n\n\"Mrs. Ray,\" Mr. Prong had said,--and as he spoke his voice was soft\nwith mingled love and sanctity,--\"I cannot let this moment pass\nwithout expressing one word of what I feel at the prospect of\nconnecting myself with your amiable family.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm much obliged,\" Mrs. Ray had answered.\n\n\"Of course I am aware that Dorothea has mentioned the matter to you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; she has mentioned it, certainly.\"\n\n\"And therefore I should be remiss, both as regards duty and manners,\nif I did not take this opportunity of assuring you how much\ngratification I feel in becoming thus bound up in family affection\nwith you and Miss Rachel. Family ties are sweet bonds of sanctified\nlove; and as I have none of my own,--nearer, that is, than Geelong,\nthe colony of Victoria, where my mother and brother and sisters have\nlocated themselves,--I shall feel the more pleasure in taking you and\nMiss Rachel to my heart.\"\n\nThis was complimentary to Mrs. Ray; but with her peculiar feelings as\nto the expediency of people having their own belongings, she almost\nthought that it would have been better for all parties if Mr. Prong\nhad gone to Geelong with the rest of the Prong family: this opinion,\nhowever, she did not express. As to taking Mr. Prong to her heart,\nshe felt some doubts of her own capacity for such a performance.\nIt would be natural for her to love a son-in-law. She had loved\nMr. Prime very dearly, and trusted him thoroughly. She would have\nbeen prepared to love Luke Rowan, had fate been propitious in that\nquarter. But she could not feel secure as to loving Mr. Prong. Such\nlove, moreover, should come naturally, of its own growth, and not be\ndemanded categorically as a right. It certainly was a pity that Mr.\nProng had not made himself happy, with that happiness for which he\nsighed, in the bosom of his family at Geelong. \"I'm sure you're very\nkind,\" Mrs. Ray had said.\n\n\"And when we are thus united in the bonds of this world,\" continued\nMr. Prong, \"I do hope that other bonds, more holy in their nature\neven than those of family, more needful even than them, may join us\ntogether. Dorothea has for some months past been a constant attendant\nat my church--\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't leave Mr. Comfort; indeed I couldn't,\" said Mrs. Ray\nin alarm. \"I couldn't go away from my own parish church was it ever\nso.\"\n\n\"No, no; not altogether, perhaps. I am not sure that it would be\ndesirable. But will it not be sweet, Mrs. Ray, when we are bound\ntogether as one family, to pour forth our prayers in holy communion\ntogether?\"\n\n\"I think so much of my own parish church, Mr. Prong,\" Mrs. Ray\nreplied. After that Mr. Prong did not, on that occasion, press the\nmatter further, and soon turned round his chair so as to relieve the\nthree ladies behind him.\n\n\"I think we had better be going, Mr. Prong,\" said Mrs. Prime, rising\nfrom her seat with a display of anger in the very motion of her\nlimbs. \"Good-evening, mother: good-evening to you, Rachel. I'm afraid\nour visit has put you out. Had I guessed as much, we would not have\ncome.\"\n\n\"You know, Dolly, that I am always glad to see you,--only you come to\nus so seldom,\" said Rachel. Then with a very cold bow to Miss Pucker,\nwith a very warm pressure of the hand from Mr. Prong, and with a\nsisterly embrace for Dorothea, that was not cordial as it should have\nbeen, she bade them good-bye. It was felt by all of them that the\nvisit had been a failure;--it was felt so, at least, by all the Ray\nfamily. Mr. Prong had achieved a certain object in discussing his\nmarriage as a thing settled; and as regarded Miss Pucker, she also\nhad achieved a certain object in eating cake and drinking wine in\nMrs. Ray's parlour.\n\nFor some weeks after that but little had been seen of Mrs. Prime at\nthe cottage; and nothing had been said of her matrimonial prospects.\nRachel did not once go to her sister's lodgings; and, on the few\noccasions of their meeting, asked no questions as to Mr. Prong.\nIndeed, as the days and weeks went on, her heart became too heavy to\nadmit of her asking any questions about the love affairs of others.\nShe still went about her work, as I have before said. She was not\nill,--not ill so as to demand the care due to an invalid. But she\nmoved about the house slowly, as though her limbs were too heavy for\nher. She spoke little, unless when her mother addressed her. She\nwould sit for hours on the sofa doing nothing, reading nothing, and\nlooking at nothing. But still, at the postman's morning hours, she\nwould keep her eye upon the road over which he came, and that dull\nlook of despair would come across her face when he passed on without\ncalling at the cottage.\n\nBut on a certain morning towards the end of the six weeks the postman\ndid call,--as indeed he had called on other days, though bringing\nwith him no letter from Luke Rowan. Neither now, on this occasion,\ndid he bring a letter from Luke Rowan. The letter was addressed to\nMrs. Ray; and, as Rachel well knew from the handwriting, it was from\nthe gentleman who managed her mother's little money matters,--the\ngentleman who had succeeded to the business left by Mr. Ray when he\ndied. So Rachel took the letter up to her mother and left it, saying\nthat it was from Mr. Goodall.\n\nMrs. Ray's small income arose partly from certain cottages in\nBaslehurst, which had been let in lump to a Baslehurst tradesman, and\npartly from shares in a gas company at Exeter. Now the gas company at\nExeter was the better investment of the two, and was considered to be\nsubject to less uncertainty than the cottages. The lease under which\nthe cottages had been let was out, and Mrs. Ray had been advised to\nsell the property. Building ground near the town was rising in value;\nand she had been advised by Mr. Goodall to part with her little\nestate. Both Mrs. Ray and Rachel were aware that this business, to\nthem very important, was imminent; and now had come a letter from Mr.\nGoodall, saying that Mrs. Ray must go to Exeter to conclude the sale.\n\"We should only bungle matters,\" Mr. Goodall had said, \"if I were to\nsend the deeds down to you; and as it is absolutely necessary that\nyou should understand all about it, I think you had better come up on\nTuesday; you can get back to Baslehurst easily on the same day.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Ray, coming into the parlour, \"I must go to\nExeter.\"\n\n\"To-day, mamma?\"\n\n\"No, not to-day, but on Tuesday. Mr. Goodall says I must understand\nall about the sale. It is a dreadful trouble.\"\n\nBut, dreadful as the trouble was, it seemed that Mrs. Ray was not\nmade unhappy by the prospect of the little expedition. She fussed\nand fretted as ladies do on such occasions, but--as is also common\nwith ladies,--the excitement of the journey was, upon the whole, a\ngratification to her. She asked Rachel to accompany her, and at first\npressed her to do so strongly; but such work at the present moment\nwas not in accord with Rachel's mood, and at last she escaped from it\nunder the plea of expense.\n\n\"I think it would be foolish, mamma,\" she said. \"Now that Dolly has\ngone you will be run very close; and when Mr. Goodall first spoke\nof selling the cottages, he said that perhaps you might be without\nanything from them for a quarter.\"\n\n\"But he has sold them now, my dear; and there will be the money at\nonce.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should throw away ten and sixpence, mamma,\" said\nRachel.\n\nAnd as she spoke in that resolved and masterful tone, her mother, of\ncourse, gave up the point. So when the Tuesday morning came, she went\nwith her mother only as far as the station.\n\n\"Don't mind meeting me, because I can't be sure about the train,\"\nsaid Mrs. Ray. \"But I shall be back to-night, certainly.\"\n\n\"And I'll wait tea for you,\" said Rachel. Then, when her mother was\ngone, she walked back to the cottage by herself.\n\nShe walked back at once, but took a most devious course. She was\ndetermined to avoid the length of the High Street, and she was\ndetermined also to avoid Brewery Lane; but she was equally determined\nto pass through the churchyard. So she walked down from the railway\nstation to the hamlet at the bottom of the hill below the church,\nand from thence went up by the field-path to the stile. In order to\naccomplish this she went fully two miles out of her way, and now the\nsun over her head was very hot. But what was the distance or the heat\nof the sun to her when her object was to stand for a few moments in\nthat place? Her visit, however, to the spot which was so constantly\nin her thoughts did her no good. Why had she been so injured? Why had\nthis sacrifice of herself been demanded from her? As she sat for a\nmoment on the stile this was the matter that filled her breast. She\nhad been exalted to the heavens when she first heard her mother speak\nof Mr. Rowan as an acceptable suitor. She had been filled with joy as\nthough Paradise had been opened to her, when she found herself to be\nthe promised bride of Luke Rowan. Then had come her lover's letter,\nand the clergyman's counsel, and her own reply; and after that the\ngates of her Paradise had been closed against her! \"I wonder whether\nit's the same thing to him,\" she said to herself. \"But I suppose not.\nI don't think it can be the same thing or he would come. Wouldn't\nI go to him if I were free as he is!\" She barely rested in the\nchurchyard, and then walked on between the elms at a quick pace, with\na heart sore,--sore almost to breaking. She would never have been\nbrought to this condition had not her mother told her that she might\nlove him! Thence came her vexation of spirit. There was the cruelty.\nAll the world knew that this man had been her lover;--all her world\nknew it. Cherry Tappitt had sung her little witless song about it.\nMrs. Tappitt had called at the cottage about it. Mr. Comfort had\ngiven his advice about it. Mrs. Cornbury had whispered to her about\nit out of her pony carriage. Mrs. Sturt had counselled her about it.\nMr. Prong had thought it very wrong on her part to love the man. Mr.\nSturt had thought it very right, and had offered his assistance. All\nthis would have been as nothing had her lover remained to her. Cherry\nmight have sung till her little throat was tired, and Mr. Prong might\nhave expressed his awe with outspread hands, and have looked as\nthough he expected the skies to fall. Had her Paradise not been\nclosed to her, all this talking would have been a thing of course.\nBut such talking,--such wide-spread knowledge of her condition, with\nthe gates of her Paradise closed against her, was very hard to bear!\nAnd who had closed the gates? Her own hands had done it. He, her\nlover, had not deserted her. He had done for her all that truth and\nearnestness demanded, and perhaps as much as love required. Men were\nnot so soft as girls, she argued within her own breast. Let a man be\never so true it could not be expected that he should stand by his\nlove after he had been treated with such cold indifference as had\nbeen shown in her letter! She would have stood by her love, let his\nletter have been as cold as it might. But then she was a woman, and\nher love, once encouraged, had become a necessity to her. A man, she\nsaid to herself, would be more proud but less stanch. Of course she\nwould hear no more from him. Of course the gates of her Paradise\nwere shut. Such were her thoughts as she walked home, and such the\nthoughts over which she sat brooding alone throughout the entire day.\n\nAt half-past seven in the evening Mrs. Ray came back home, wearily\ntrudging across the green. She was very weary, for she had now walked\nabove two miles from the station. She had also been on her feet half\nthe day, and, which was probably worse than all the rest had she\nknown it, she had travelled nearly eighty miles by railway. She was\nvery tired, and would under ordinary circumstances have been disposed\nto reckon up her grievances in the evening quite as accurately as\nRachel had reckoned hers in the morning. But something had occurred\nin Exeter, the recollection of which still overcame the sense of\nweariness which Mrs. Ray felt;--overcame it, or rather overtopped it;\nso that when Rachel came out to her at the cottage door she did not\nspeak at once of her own weariness, but looked lovingly into her\ndaughter's face,--lovingly and anxiously, and said some little word\nintended to denote affection.\n\n\"You must be very tired,\" said Rachel, who, with many self-reproaches\nand much communing within her own bosom, had for the time vanquished\nher own hard humour.\n\n\"Yes, I am tired, my dear; very. I thought the train never would have\ngot to the Baslehurst station. It stopped at all the little stations,\nand really I think I could have walked as fast.\" A dozen years had\nnot as yet gone by since the velocity of these trains had been so\nterrible to Mrs. Ray that she had hardly dared to get into one of\nthem!\n\n\"And whom have you seen?\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Seen!\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Who told you that I had seen anybody?\"\n\n\"I suppose you saw Mr. Goodall.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I saw him of course. I saw him, and the cottages are all\nsold. We shall have seven pounds ten a year more than before. I'm\nsure it will be a very great comfort. Seven pounds ten will buy so\nmany things.\"\n\n\"But ten pounds would buy more.\"\n\n\"Of course it would, my dear. And I told Mr. Goodall I wished he\ncould make it ten, as it would make it sound so much more regular\nlike; but he said he couldn't do it because the gas has gone up so\nmuch. He could have done it if I had sixty pounds, but of course I\nhadn't.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, whom did you see except Mr. Goodall? I know you saw\nsomebody, and you must tell me.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Rachel. You can't know that I saw anybody.\" It\nmay, however, be well to explain at once the cause of Mrs. Ray's\nhesitation, and that this may be done in the proper course, we will\ngo back to her journey to Exeter. All the incidents of her day may\nbe told very shortly; but there was one incident in her day which\nfilled her with so much anxiety, and almost dismay, that it must be\nnarrated.\n\nOn arriving at Exeter she got into an omnibus which would have taken\nher direct to Mr. Goodall's office in the Close; but she was minded\nto call at a shop in the High Street, and had herself put down at the\ncorner of one of those passages which lead from the High Street to\nthe Close. She got down from the step of the vehicle, very carefully,\nas is the wont with middle-aged ladies from the country, and turned\nround to walk directly into the shop; but before her, on the\npavement, she saw Luke Rowan. He was standing close to her, so that\nit was impossible that they should have pretended to miss seeing each\nother, even had they been so minded. Any such pretence would have\nbeen impossible to Mrs. Ray, and would have been altogether contrary\nto Luke Rowan's nature. He had been coming out of the shop, and had\nbeen arrested at once by Mrs. Ray's figure as he saw it emerging from\nthe door of the omnibus.\n\n\"How d'you do?\" said he, coming forward with outstretched hand, and\nspeaking as though there was nothing between him and Mrs. Ray which\nrequired any peculiar word or tone.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowan! is this you?\" said she. \"Dear, dear! I'm sure I\ndidn't expect to see you in Exeter.\"\n\n\"I dare say not, Mrs. Ray; and I didn't expect to see you. But the\nodd thing is I've come here about the same business as you, though\nI didn't know anything about it till yesterday.\"\n\n\"What business, Mr. Rowan?\"\n\n\"I've bought your cottages in Baslehurst.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But I have, and I've paid for them too, and you're going this very\nminute to Mr. Goodall to sign the deed of sale. Isn't that true? So\nyou see I know all about it.\"\n\n\"Well, that is strange! Isn't it, now?\"\n\n\"The fact is I must have a bit of land at Baslehurst for building.\nTappitt will go on fighting; and as I don't mean to be beaten, I'll\nhave a place of my own there.\"\n\n\"And you'll pull down the cottages?\"\n\n\"If I don't pull him down first, so as to get the old brewery. I was\nobliged to buy your bit of ground now, as I might not have been able\nto get any just when I wanted it. You've sold it a deal too cheap.\nYou tell Mr. Goodall I say so.\"\n\n\"But he says I'm to gain something by selling it.\"\n\n\"Does he? If it is so, I'm very glad of it. I only came down from\nLondon yesterday to finish this piece of business, and I'm going back\nto-day.\"\n\nDuring all this time not a word had been said about Rachel. He had\nnot even asked after her in the ordinary way in which men ask after\ntheir ordinary acquaintance. He had not looked as though he were in\nthe least embarrassed in speaking to Rachel's mother, and now it\nseemed as though he were going away, as though all had been said\nbetween them that he cared to say. Mrs. Ray at the first moment had\ndreaded any special word; but now, as he was about to leave her, she\nfelt disappointed that no special word had been spoken. But he was\nnot as yet gone.\n\n\"I literally haven't a minute to spare,\" he said, offering her his\nhand for a second time; \"for I've two or three people to see before\nI get to the train.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Ray. I don't think I've been very well treated among\nyou. I don't indeed. But I won't say any more about that at present.\nIs she quite well?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, thank you,\" said she, all of a tremble.\n\n\"I won't send her any message. As things are at present, no message\nwould be of any service. Good-bye.\" And so saying he went from her.\n\nMrs. Ray at that moment had no time for making up her mind as to\nwhat she would do or say in consequence of this meeting,--or whether\nshe would do or say anything. She looked forward to all the leisure\ntime of her journey home for thinking of that; so she finished her\nshopping and hurried on to Mr. Goodall's office without resolving\nwhether or no she would tell Rachel of the encounter. At Mr.\nGoodall's she remained some little time, dining at that gentleman's\nhouse as well as signing the deed, and asking questions about the gas\ncompany. He had grateful recollections of kindnesses received from\nMr. Ray, and always exercised his hospitality on those rare occasions\nwhich brought Mrs. Ray up to Exeter. As they sat at table he asked\nquestions about the young purchaser of the property which somewhat\nperplexed Mrs. Ray. Yes, she said, she did know him. She had just\nmet him in the street and heard his news. Young Rowan, she told her\nfriend, had been at the cottage more than once, but no mention had\nbeen made of his desire to buy these cottages. Was he well spoken of\nin Baslehurst? Well;--she was so little in Baslehurst that she hardly\nknew. She had heard that he had quarrelled with Mr. Tappitt, and she\nbelieved that many people had said that he was wrong in his quarrel.\nShe knew nothing of his property; but certainly had heard somebody\nsay that he had gone away without paying his debts. It may easily\nbe conceived how miserable and ineffective she would be under this\ncross-examination, although it was made by Mr. Goodall without any\nallusion to Rachel.\n\n\"At any rate we have got our money,\" said Mr. Goodall; \"and I suppose\nthat's all we care about. But I should say he's rather a harum-scarum\nsort of fellow. Why he should leave his debts behind him I can't\nunderstand, as he seems to have plenty of money.\"\n\nAll this made Mrs. Ray's task the more difficult. During the last\ntwo or three weeks she had been wishing that she had not gone\nto Mr. Comfort,--wishing that she had allowed Rachel to answer\nRowan's letter in any terms of warmest love that she might have\nchosen,--wishing, in fact, that she had permitted the engagement\nto go on. But now she began again to think that she had been right.\nIf this man were in truth a harum-scarum fellow was it not well\nthat Rachel should be quit of him,--even with any amount of present\nsorrow? Thinking of this on her way back to Baslehurst she again made\nup her mind that Rowan was a wolf. But she had not made up her mind\nas to what she would, or what she would not tell Rachel about the\nmeeting, even when she reached her own door. \"I will send her no\nmessage,\" he had said. \"As things are at present no message would be\nof service.\" What had he meant by this? What purpose on his part did\nthese words indicate? These questions Mrs. Ray had asked herself, but\nhad failed to answer them.\n\nBut no resolution on Mrs. Ray's part to keep the meeting secret would\nhave been of avail, even had she made such resolution. The fact would\nhave fallen from her as easily as water falls from a sieve. Rachel\nwould have extracted from her the information, had she been ever so\ndetermined not to impart it. As things had turned out she had at once\ngiven Rachel to understand that she had met some one in Exeter whom\nshe had not expected to meet.\n\n\"But, mamma, whom did you see except Mr. Goodall?\" Rachel asked. \"I\nknow you saw somebody, and you must tell me.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Rachel; you can't know that I saw anybody.\"\n\nAfter that there was a pause for some moments, and then Rachel\npersisted in her inquiry. \"But, mamma, I do know that you met\nsomebody.\"--Then there was another pause.--\"Mamma, was it Mr. Rowan?\"\n\nMrs. Ray stood convicted at once. Had she not spoken a word, the form\nof her countenance when the question was asked would have answered it\nwith sufficient clearness. But she did speak a word. \"Well; yes, it\nwas Mr. Rowan. He had come down to Exeter on business.\"\n\n\"And what did he say, mamma?\"\n\n\"He didn't say anything,--at least, nothing particular. It is he that\nhas bought the cottages, and he had come down from London about that.\nHe told me that he wanted some ground near Baslehurst, because he\ncouldn't get the brewery.\"\n\n\"And what else did he say, mamma?\"\n\n\"I tell you that he said nothing else.\"\n\n\"He didn't--didn't mention me then?\"\n\nMrs. Ray had been looking away from Rachel during this\nconversation,--had been purposely looking away from her. But now\nthere was a tone of agony in her child's voice which forced her to\nglance round. Ah me! She beheld so piteous an expression of woe in\nRachel's face that her whole heart was melted within her, and she\nbegan to wish instantly that they might have Rowan back again with\nall his faults.\n\n\"Tell me the truth, mamma; I may as well know it.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, he didn't mention your name, but he did say a word\nabout you.\"\n\n\"What word, mamma?\"\n\n\"He said he would send no message because it would be no good.\"\n\n\"He said that, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes, he said that. And so I suppose he meant it would be no good\nsending anything till he came himself.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; he didn't mean quite that. I understand what he meant. As\nit is to be so, he was quite right. No message could be of any use.\nIt has been my own doing, and I have no right to blame him. Mamma, if\nyou don't mind, I think I'll go to bed.\"\n\n\"My dear, you're wrong. I'm sure you're wrong. He didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"Didn't he, mamma?\" And as she spoke a sad, weary, wobegone smile\ncame over her face,--a smile so sad and piteous that it went to her\nmother's heart more keenly than would have done any sound of sorrow,\nany sobs, or wail of grief. \"But I think he did mean that, mamma.\nIt's no good doubting or fearing any longer. It's all over now.\"\n\n\"And it has been my fault!\"\n\n\"No, dearest. It has not been your fault, nor do I think that it has\nbeen mine. I think we'd better not talk of faults. Ah dear;--I do\nwish he had never come here!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may be all well yet, Rachel.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may,--in another world. It will never be well again for\nme in this. Good-night, mamma. You must never think that I am angry\nwith you.\"\n\nThen she went up stairs, leaving Mrs. Ray alone with her sorrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nDOMESTIC POLITICS AT THE BREWERY.\n\n\nIn the mean time things were not going on very pleasantly at the\nbrewery, and Mr. Tappitt was making himself unpleasant in the\nbosom of his family. A lawsuit will sometimes make a man extremely\npleasant company to his wife and children. Even a losing lawsuit will\nsometimes do so, if he be well backed up in his pugnacity by his\nlawyer, and if the matter of the battle be one in which he can take\na delight to fight. \"Ah,\" a man will say, \"though I spend a thousand\npounds over it, I'll stick to him like a burr. He shan't shake me\noff.\" And at such times he is almost sure to be in a good humour,\nand in a generous mood. Then let his wife ask him for money for\na dinner-party, and his daughters for new dresses. He has taught\nhimself for the moment to disregard money, and to think that he can\nsow five-pound notes broadcast without any inward pangs. But such was\nby no means the case with Mr. Tappitt. His lawyer Honyman was not\nbacking him up; and as cool reflection came upon him he was afraid of\ntrusting his interests to those other men, Sharpit and Longfite. And\nMrs. Tappitt, when cool reflection came on her, had begun to dread\nthe ruin which it seemed possible that terrible young man might\ninflict upon them. She had learned already, though Mrs. Ray had not,\nhow false had been that report which had declared Luke Rowan to\nbe frivolous, idle, and in debt. To her it was very manifest that\nHonyman was afraid of the young man; and Honyman, though he might\nnot be as keen as some others, was at any rate honest. Honyman also\nthought that if the brewery were given up to Rowan that thousand a\nyear which had been promised would be paid regularly; and to this\nsolution of the difficulty Mrs. Tappitt was gradually bending herself\nto submit as the best which an untoward fate offered to them. Honyman\nhimself had declared to her that Mr. Tappitt, if he were well\nadvised, would admit Rowan in as a partner, on equal terms as\nregarded power and ultimate possession, but with that lion's share of\nthe immediate concern for himself which Rowan offered. But this she\nknew that Tappitt would not endure; and she knew, also, that if he\nwere brought to endure it for a while, it would ultimately lead to\nterrible sorrows. \"They would be knocking each other about with the\npokers, Mr. Honyman,\" she had said; \"and where would the custom be\nwhen that got into the newspapers?\" \"If I were Mr. Tappitt, I would\njust let him have his own way,\" Honyman had replied. \"That shows that\nyou don't know Tappitt,\" had been Mrs. Tappitt's rejoinder. No;--the\nthousand a year and dignified retirement in a villa had recommended\nitself to Mrs. Tappitt's mind. She would use all her influence to\nattain that position,--if only she could bring herself to feel\nassured that the thousand a year would be forthcoming.\n\nAs to Tappitt himself, he was by no means so anxious to prolong the\nbattle as he had been at the time of Rowan's departure. His courage\nfor fighting was not maintained by good backing. Had Honyman clapped\nhim on the shoulder and bade him put ready money in his purse,\ntelling him that all would come out right eventually, and that Rowan\nwould be crushed, he would have gone about Baslehurst boasting\nloudly, and would have been happy. Then Mrs. T. and the girls would\nhave had a merry time of it; and the Tappitts would have come out of\nthe contest with four or five hundred a year for life instead of the\nthousand now offered to them, and nobody would have blamed anybody\nfor such a result. But Honyman had not spirit for such backing. In\nhis dull, slow, droning way he had shaken his head and said that\nthings were looking badly. Then Tappitt had cursed and had sworn, and\nhad half resolved to go to Sharpit and Longfite. Sharpit and Longfite\nwould have clapped him on the back readily enough, and have bade him\nput plenty of money in his purse. But we may suppose that Fate did\nnot intend the ruin of Tappitt, seeing that she did not make him mad\nenough to seek the counsels of Sharpit and Longfite. Fate only made\nhim very cross and unpleasant in the bosom of his family. Looking out\nhimself for some mode of escape from this terrible enemy that had\ncome upon him, he preferred the raising of the sum of money which\nwould be necessary to buy off Rowan altogether. Rowan had demanded\nten thousand pounds, but Tappitt still thought that seven, or, at any\nrate, eight thousand would do it.\n\n\"I don't think he'll take less than ten,\" said Honyman, \"because his\nshare is really worth as much as that.\"\n\nThis was very provoking; and who can wonder that Tappitt was not\npleasant company in his own house?\n\nOn the day after Mrs. Ray's visit to Exeter, Tappitt, as was now his\nalmost daily practice, made his way into Mr. Honyman's little back\nroom, and sat there with his hat on, discussing his affairs.\n\n\"I find that Mr. Rowan has bought those cottages of the widow Ray's,\"\nsaid Honyman.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" shouted Tappitt, as though such a purchase on Rowan's\npart was a new injury done to himself.\n\n\"Oh, but he has,\" said Honyman. \"There's not a doubt in life about\nit. If he does mean to build a new brewery, it wouldn't be a bad\nplace. You see it's out of the thoroughfare of the town, and yet, as\none may say, within a stone's throw of the High Street.\"\n\nI will not repeat Mr. Tappitt's exclamation as he listened to these\nsuggestions of his lawyer, but it was of a nature to show that he had\nnot heard the news with indifference.\n\n\"You see he's such a fellow that you don't know where to have him,\"\ncontinued Honyman. \"It's not only that he don't mind ruining you, but\nhe don't mind ruining himself either.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he's got anything to lose.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's where you're wrong. He has paid ready money for this bit\nof land to begin with, or Goodall would never have let him have it.\nGoodall knows what he's about as well as any man.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to tell me that he's going to put up buildings there\nat once?\" And Tappitt's face as he asked the question would have\nsoftened the heart of any ordinary lawyer. But Honyman was one whom\nnothing could harden and nothing soften.\n\n\"I don't know what he's going to put up, Mr. Tappitt, and I don't\nknow when. But I know this well enough; that when a man buys little\nbits of property about a place it shows that he means to do something\nthere.\"\n\n\"If he had twenty thousand pounds, he'd lose it all.\"\n\n\"That's very likely; but the question is, how would you fare in the\nmean time? If he hadn't this claim upon you, of course you'd let him\nbuild what he liked, and only laugh at him.\" Then Mr. Tappitt uttered\nanother exclamation, and pulling his hat tighter on to his head,\nwalked out of the lawyer's office and returned to the brewery.\n\nThey dined at three o'clock at the brewery, and during dinner on\nthis day the father of the family made himself very disagreeable. He\nscolded the maid-servant till the poor girl didn't know the spoons\nfrom the forks. He abused the cook's performances till that valuable\nold retainer declared that if \"master got so rampageous he might\nsuit hisself, the sooner the better; she didn't care how soon; she'd\ncooked victuals for his betters and would again.\" He snarled at\nhis daughters till they perked up their faces and came silently to\na mutual agreement that they would not condescend to notice him\nfurther while he held on in his present mood. And he replied to his\nwife's questions,--questions intended to be soothing and kindly\nconjugal,--in such a tone that she determined to have it out with him\nbefore she allowed him to go to bed. \"She knew her duty,\" she said to\nherself, \"and she could stand a good deal. But there were some things\nshe couldn't stand and some things that weren't her duty.\" After\ndinner Tappitt took himself out at once to his office in the brewery,\nand then, for the first time, saw the \"Baslehurst Gazette and\nTotnes Chronicle\" for that week. The \"Baslehurst Gazette and Totnes\nChronicle\" was an enterprising weekly newspaper, which had been\noriginally intended to convey on Sunday mornings to the inhabitants\nof South Devonshire the news of the past week, and the paper still\nbore the dates of successive Sundays. But it had gradually pushed\nitself out into the light of its own world before its own date,\ngaining first a night and then a day, till now, at the period of\nwhich I am speaking, it was published on the Friday morning.\n\n\"You ought just to look at this,\" a burly old foreman had said,\nhanding him the paper in question, with his broad thumb placed upon\na certain column. This foreman had known Bungall, and though he\nrespected Tappitt, he did not fear him. \"You should just look at\nthis. Of course it don't amount to nothing; but it's as well to\nsee what folks say.\" And he handed the paper to his master, almost\nmaking a hole in it by screwing his thumb on to the spot he wished to\nindicate.\n\nTappitt read the article, and his spirit was very bitter within\nhim. It was a criticism on his own beer written in no friendly tone.\n\"There is no reason,\" said the article, \"why Baslehurst should be\nflooded with a liquor which no Christian ought to be asked to drink.\nBaslehurst is as capable of judging good beer from bad as any town in\nthe British empire. Let Mr. Tappitt look to it, or some young rival\nwill spring up beneath his feet and seize from his brow the hop-leaf\nwreath which Bungall won and wore.\" This attack was the more cruel\nbecause the paper had originally been established by Bungall's\nmoney, and had, in old days, been altogether devoted to the Bungall\ninterest. That this paper should turn against him was very hard. But\nwhat else had he a right to expect? It was known that he had promised\nhis vote to the Jew candidate, and the paper in question supported\nthe Cornbury interest. A man that lives in a glass house should throw\nno stones. The brewer who brews bad beer should vote for nobody.\n\nBut Tappitt would not regard this attack upon him in its proper\npolitical light. Every evil at present falling upon him was\nsupposed to come from his present enemy. \"It's that dirty underhand\nblackguard,\" he said to the foreman.\n\n\"I don't think so, Mr. Tappitt,\" said the foreman. \"I don't think so\nindeed.\"\n\n\"But I tell you it is,\" said Tappitt, \"and I don't care what you\nthink.\"\n\n\"Just as you please, Mr. Tappitt,\" said the foreman, who thereupon\nretired from the office, leaving his master to meditate over the\nnewspaper in solitude.\n\nIt was a very bitter time for the poor brewer. He was one of those\nmen whose spirit is not wanting to them while the noise and tumult\nof contest are around them, but who cannot hold on by their own\nconvictions in the quiet hours. He could storm, and talk loud, and\ninsist on his own way while men stood around him listening and\nperhaps admiring; but he was cowed when left by himself to think of\nthings which seemed to be adverse. What could he do, if those around\nhim, who had known him all his life as those newspaper people had\nknown him,--what could he do if they turned against him, and talked\nof bad beer as Rowan had talked? He was not man enough to stand up\nand face this new enemy unless he were backed by his old friends.\nHonyman had told him that he would be beaten. How would it fare with\nhim and his family if he were beaten? As he sat in his little office,\nwith his hat low down over his eyes, balancing himself on the hind\nlegs of his chair, he abused Honyman roundly. Had Honyman been\npossessed of wit, of skill, of professional craft,--had he been the\nmaster of any invention, all might have been well. But the attorney\nwas a fool, an ass, a coward. Might it not be that he was a knave?\nBut luckily for Honyman, and luckily also for Mr. Tappitt himself,\nthis abuse did not pass beyond the precincts of Tappitt's own breast.\nWe all know how delightful is the privilege of abusing our nearest\nfriends after this fashion; but we generally satisfy ourselves with\nthat limited audience to which Mr. Tappitt addressed himself on the\npresent occasion.\n\nIn the mean time Mrs. Tappitt was sitting up-stairs in the brewery\ndrawing-room with her daughters, and she also was not happy in her\nmind. She had been snubbed, and almost browbeaten, at dinner time,\nand she also had had a little conversation in private with Mr.\nHonyman. She had been snubbed, and, if she did not look well about\nher, she was going to be ruined. \"You mustn't let him go on with this\nlawsuit,\" Mr. Honyman had said. \"He'll certainly get the worst of it\nif he does, and then he'll have to pay double.\" She disliked Rowan\nquite as keenly as did her husband, but she was fully alive to the\nfolly of spiting Rowan by doing an injury to her own face. She would\nspeak to Tappitt that night very seriously, and in the mean time\nshe turned the Rowan controversy over in her own mind, endeavouring\nto look at it from all sides. It had never been her custom to make\ncritical remarks on their father's conduct to any of the girls except\nMartha; but on the present great occasion she waived that rule, and\ndiscussed the family affairs in full female family conclave. \"I don't\nknow what's come over your papa,\" she began by saying. \"He seems\nquite beside himself to-day.\"\n\n\"I think he is troubled about Mr. Rowan and this lawsuit,\" said the\nsagacious Martha.\n\n\"Nasty man! I wish he'd never come near the place,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"I don't know that he's very nasty either,\" said Cherry. \"We all\nliked him when he was staying here.\"\n\n\"But to be so false to papa!\" said Augusta. \"I call it swindling,\ndownright swindling.\"\n\n\"One should know and understand all about it before one speaks in\nthat way,\" said Martha. \"I dare say it is very vexatious to papa; but\nafter all perhaps Mr. Rowan may have some right on his side.\"\n\n\"I don't know about right,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"I don't think he can\nhave any right to come and set himself up here in opposition, as one\nmay say, to the very ghost of his own uncle. I agree with Augusta,\nand think it is a very dirty thing to do.\"\n\n\"Quite shameful,\" said Augusta, indignantly.\n\n\"But if he has got the law on his side,\" continued Mrs. Tappitt,\n\"it's no good your papa trying to go against that. Where should we be\nif we were to lose everything and be told to pay more money than your\npapa has got? It wouldn't be very pleasant to be turned out of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"I don't think he'd ever do it,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"I declare, Cherry, I think you are in love with the man,\" said\nAugusta.\n\n\"If I ain't I know who was,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"As for love,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, \"we all know who is in love with\nhim,--nasty little sly minx! In the whole matter nothing makes me so\nangry as to think that she should have come here to our dance.\"\n\n\"That was Cherry's doing,\" said Augusta. This remark Cherry noticed\nonly by a grimace addressed specially to her sister. A battle in\nRachel's favour under present circumstances would have been so losing\nan affair that Cherry had not pluck enough to adventure it on her\nfriend's behalf.\n\n\"But the question is,--what are we to do about the lawsuit?\" said\nMrs. Tappitt. \"It is easy to see from your papa's manner that he\nis very much harassed. He won't admit him as a partner;--that's\ncertain.\"\n\n\"Oh dear! I should hope not,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said Martha; \"but if the young man can prove\nhis right, he must have it. Mamma, do you know what Mr. Honyman says\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I do.\" Mrs. Tappitt's manner became very solemn, and\nthe girls listened with all their ears. \"Yes, my dear, I do. Mr.\nHonyman thinks your father should give way.\"\n\n\"And take him in as a partner?\" said Augusta. \"Papa has got that\nspirit that he couldn't do it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't follow that your papa should take Mr. Rowan in as a\npartner because he gives up the lawsuit. He might pay him the money\nthat he asks.\"\n\n\"But has he got it?\" demanded Martha.\n\n\"Besides, it's such a deal; isn't it?\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Or,\" continued Mrs. Tappitt, \"your papa might accept his offer by\nretiring with a very handsome income for us all. Your papa has been\nin business for a great many years, working like a galley-slave.\nNobody knows how he has toiled and moiled, except me. It isn't any\njoke being a brewer,--and having it all on himself as he has had. And\nif young Rowan ever begins it, I wish him joy of it.\"\n\n\"But would he pay the income?\" Martha asked.\n\n\"Mr. Honyman says that he would; and if he did not, there would be\nthe property to fall back upon.\"\n\n\"And where should we live?\" said Cherry.\n\n\"That can't be settled quite yet. It must be somewhere near, so that\nyour papa might keep an eye on the concern, and know that it was\ngoing all right. Perhaps Torquay would be the best place.\"\n\n\"Torquay would be delicious,\" said Cherry.\n\n\"And would that man come and live at the brewery?\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Of course he would, if he pleased,\" said Martha.\n\n\"And bring Rachel Ray with him as his wife?\" said Cherry.\n\n\"He'll never do that,\" said Mrs. Tappitt with energy.\n\n\"Never; never!\" said Augusta,--with more energy.\n\nIn this way the large and influential feminine majority of the family\nat the brewery was brought round to look at one of the propositions\nmade by Rowan without disfavour. It was not that that young man's\nsins had been in any degree forgiven, but that they all perceived,\nwith female prudence, that it would be injudicious to ruin themselves\nbecause they hated him. And then to what lady living in a dingy brick\nhouse, close adjoining to the smoke and smells of beer-brewing,\nwould not the idea of a marine villa at Torquay be delicious? None\nof the family, not even Mrs. Tappitt herself, had ever known what\nannual profit had accrued to Mr. T. as the reward of his life's work.\nBut they had been required to live in a modest, homely way,--as\nthough that annual profit had not been great. Under the altered\ncircumstances, as now proposed, they would all know that papa had\na thousand a year to spend;--and what might not be done at Torquay\nwith a thousand a year? Before Mr. Tappitt came home for the\nevening,--which he did not do on that day till past ten, having been\ndetained, by business, in the bar of the Dragon Inn,--they had all\nresolved that the combined ease and dignity of a thousand a year\nshould be accepted.\n\nMr. Tappitt was still perturbed in spirit when he took himself to the\nmarital chamber. What had been the nature of the business which had\ndetained him at the bar of the Dragon he did not condescend to say,\nbut it seemed to have been of a nature not well adapted to smooth his\ntemper. Mrs. Tappitt perhaps guessed what that business had been; but\nif so, she said nothing of the subject in direct words. One little\nremark she did make, which may perhaps have had allusion to that\nbusiness.\n\n\"Bah!\" she exclaimed, as Mr. Tappitt came near her; \"if you must\nsmoke at all, I wish to goodness you'd smoke good tobacco.\"\n\n\"So I do,\" said Tappitt, turning round at her sharply. \"It's best\nmixed bird's-eye. As if you could know the difference, indeed!\"\n\n\"So I do, T. I know the difference very well. It's all poison to\nme,--absolute poison,--as you're very well aware. But that filthy\nstrong stuff that you've taken to lately, is enough to kill anybody.\"\n\n\"I haven't taken to any filthy strong stuff,\" said Tappitt.\n\nThis was the beginning of that evening's conversation. I am inclined\nto think that Mrs. Tappitt had made her calculations, and had\nconcluded that she could put forth her coming observations more\nefficaciously by having her husband in bad humour, than she could,\nif she succeeded in coaxing him into a good humour. I think that she\nmade the above remarks, not solely because the fumes of tobacco were\ndistasteful to her, but because the possession of a grievance might\ngive her an opportunity of commencing the forthcoming debate with\nsome better amount of justified indignation on her own side. It was\nnot often that she begrudged Tappitt his pipe, or made ill-natured\nremarks about his gin and water.\n\n\"T.,\" she said, when Tappitt had torn off his coat in some anger at\nthe allusion to \"filthy strong stuff,\"--\"T., what do you mean to do\nabout this lawsuit?\"\n\n\"I don't mean to do anything.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, T.; you must do something, you know. What does Mr.\nHonyman say?\"\n\n\"Honyman is a fool.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, T.; he's not a fool. Or if he is, why have you let him\nmanage your affairs so long? But I don't believe he's a fool at all.\nI believe he knows what he's talking about, quite as well as some\nothers, who pretend to be so clever. As to your going to Sharpit and\nLongfite, it's quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"Who's talking of going to them?\"\n\n\"You did talk of it.\"\n\n\"No I didn't. You heard me mention their names; but I never said that\nI should go to them at all. I almost wish I had.\"\n\n\"Now, T., don't talk in that way, or you'll really put me beside\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk of it at all. I only want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"But we must talk of it, T. It's all very well for you to say you\ndon't want to talk of things; but what is to become of me and my\ngirls if everything goes astray at the brewery? You can't expect me\nto sit by quiet and see you ruined.\"\n\n\"Who talks about my being ruined?\"\n\n\"Well, I believe all Baslehurst pretty well is talking about it. If\na man will go on with a lawsuit when his own lawyer says he oughtn't,\nwhat else can come to him but ruin?\"\n\n\"You don't know anything about it. I wish you'd hold your tongue, and\nlet me go to bed.\"\n\n\"I do know something about it, Mr. Tappitt; and I won't hold my\ntongue. It's all very well for you to bid me hold my tongue; but am\nI to sit by and see you ruined, and the girls left without a bit to\neat or a thing to wear? Goodness knows I've never thought much about\nmyself. Nobody will ever say that of me. But it has come to this, T.;\nthat something must be settled about Rowan's claim. If he hasn't got\njustice, he's got law on his side; and he seems to be one of those\nwho don't care much as long as he's got that. If you ask me, T.--\"\n\n\"But I didn't ask you,\" said Tappitt.\n\nTappitt never actually succumbed in these matrimonial encounters, and\nwould always maintain courage for a sharp word, even to the last.\n\n\"No, I know you didn't;--and more shame to you, not to consult the\nwife of your bosom and the mother of your children, when such an\naffair as this has to be settled. But if you think I'm going to hold\nmy tongue, you're mistaken. I know very well how things are going.\nYou must either let this young man come in as a partner--\"\n\n\"I'll be ----\"\n\nTappitt would not have disgraced himself by such an exclamation in\nhis wife's bedroom as he then used if his business in the bar of the\nDragon had been legitimate.\n\n\"Very well, sir. I say nothing about the coarseness of your language\non the present occasion, though I might say a great deal if I\npleased. But if you don't choose to have him for a partner,--why then\nyou must do something else.\"\n\n\"Of course I must.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--and therefore the only thing is for you to take the offer\nof a thousand a year that he has made. Now, T., don't begin cursing\nand swearing again, because you know that can't do any good. Honyman\nsays that he'll pay the income;--and if he don't,--if he gets into\narrear with it, then you can come down upon him and turn him out.\nThink how you'd like that! You've only just to keep a little ready\nmoney by you, so that you'll have something for six months or so, if\nhe should get into arrear.\"\n\n\"And I'm to give up everything myself?\"\n\n\"No, T.; you would not give up anything; quite the other way. You\nwould have every comfort round you that any man can possibly want.\nYou can't go on at it always, toiling and moiling as you're doing\nnow. It's quite dreadful for a man never to have a moment to himself\nat your time of life, and of course it must tell on any constitution\nif it's kept up too long. You're not the man you were, T.; and of\ncourse you couldn't expect it.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\"\n\n\"That's all very well; but it's my duty to see these things, and\nto think of them, and to speak of them too. Where should I be, and\nthe girls, if you was hurried into your grave by working too hard?\"\nMrs. Tappitt's voice, as this terrible suggestion fell from her, was\nalmost poetic, through the depth of its solemnity. \"Do you think I\ndon't know what it is that takes you to the Dragon so late at night?\"\n\n\"I don't go to the Dragon late at night.\"\n\n\"I'm not finding fault, T.; and you needn't answer me so sharp. It's\nonly natural you should want something to sustain you after such\nslavery as you have to go through. I'm not unreasonable. I know very\nwell what a man is, and what it is he can do, and what he can't. It\nwould be all very well your going on if you had a partner you could\ntrust.\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth shall induce me to carry on with that fellow.\"\n\n\"And therefore you ought to take him at his word and retire. It would\nbe the gentlemanlike thing to do. Of course you'd have the power of\ngoing over and seeing that things was straight. And if we was living\ncomfortable at some genteel place, such as Torquay or the like, of\ncourse you wouldn't want to be going out to Dragons every evening\nthen. I shouldn't wonder if, in two or three years, you didn't find\nyourself as strong as ever again.\"\n\nTappitt, beneath the clothes, insisted that he was strong; and made\nsome virile remark in answer to that further allusion to the Dragon.\nHe by no means gave way to his wife, or uttered any word of assent;\nbut the lady's scheme had been made known to him; the ice had been\nbroken; and Mrs. Tappitt, when she put out the candle, felt that she\nhad done a good evening's work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nMRS. RAY'S PENITENCE.\n\n\nAnother fortnight went by, and still nothing further was heard at\nBragg's End from Luke Rowan. Much was heard of him in Baslehurst.\nIt was soon known by everybody that he had bought the cottages; and\nthere was a widely-spread and well-credited rumour that he was going\nto commence the necessary buildings for a new brewhouse at once. Nor\nwere these tidings received by Baslehurst with all that horror,--with\nthat loud clamour of indignation,--which Tappitt conceived to be due\nto them. Baslehurst, I should say, as a whole, received the tidings\nwith applause. Why should not Bungall's nephew carry on a brewery of\nhis own? Especially why should he not, if he were resolved to brew\ngood beer? Very censorious remarks about the Tappitt beer were to\nbe heard in all bar-rooms, and were re-echoed with vehemence in the\nkitchens of the Baslehurst aristocracy.\n\n\"It ain't beer,\" said Dr. Harford's cook, who had come from the\nmidland counties, and knew what good beer was. \"It's a nasty muddle\nof stuff, not fit for any Christian who has to earn her victuals over\na kitchen fire.\"\n\nIt came to pass speedily that Luke Rowan was expected to build a new\nbrewery, and that the event of the first brick was looked for with\nanxious expectation. And that false report which had spread itself\nthrough Baslehurst respecting him and his debts had taken itself off.\nIt had been banished by a contrary report; and there now existed in\nBaslehurst a very general belief that Rowan was a man of means,--of\nvery considerable means,--a man of substantial capital, whom to\nhave settled in the town would be very beneficial to the community.\nThat false statement as to the bill at Griggs' had been sifted, and\nthe truth made known,--and somewhat to the disgrace of the Tappitt\nfaction. The only article supplied by Griggs to Rowan's order had\nbeen the champagne consumed at Tappitt's supper, and for this Rowan\nhad paid ready money within a week of the transaction. It was Mrs.\nCornbury who discovered all this, and who employed means for making\nthe truth known in Baslehurst. This truth also became known at last\nto Mrs. Ray,--but of what avail was it then? She had desired her\ndaughter to treat the young man as a wolf, and as a wolf he had been\nhounded off from her little sheep-cot. She heard now that he was\nexpected back at Baslehurst;--that he was a wealthy man; that he was\nthought well of in the town; that he was going to do great things.\nWith what better possible husband could any young woman have been\nblessed? And yet she had turned him away from her cottage as though\nhe had been a wolf!\n\nIt was from Mrs. Sturt that Mrs. Ray first learned the truth. Mr.\nSturt was a tenant on the Cornbury estate, and Mrs. Sturt was of\ncourse well known to Mrs. Cornbury. That lady, when she had sifted to\nthe bottom the story of Griggs' bill, and had assured herself that\nRowan was by no means minded to surrender his interest in Baslehurst,\ndetermined that the truth should be made known to Mrs. Ray. But she\nwas not willing to call on Mrs. Ray herself, nor did she wish to\npresent herself before Rachel at the cottage, unless she could bring\nwith her some more substantial comfort than could be afforded by\nsimple evidence as to Rowan's good character. She therefore took\nherself to Mrs. Sturt, and discussed the matter with her.\n\n\"I suppose she does care about him,\" said Mrs. Cornbury, sitting in\nMrs. Sturt's little parlour that opened out upon the kitchen garden.\nMrs. Sturt was also seated, leaning on the corner of the table, with\nthe sleeves of her gown tucked up, ready for work when the Squire's\nlady should be gone, but very willing to postpone her work as long as\nthe Squire's lady would stay and gossip with her.\n\n\"Oh! that she do, Mrs. Butler,--in her heart of hearts. If I know\nanything of true love, she do love that young man.\"\n\n\"And he did offer to her? There can be no doubt about that, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt on earth, Mrs. Butler. She never told me so\noutright,--nor yet didn't her mother;--but if he didn't, I'll give my\nhead for a cream cheese. Laws love you, Mrs. Butler, I know what's\nwhat well enough. I know when a girl's wild and flighty, and thinks\nof things as she oughtn't;--and I know when she's proper behaved, and\ngives a young man encouragement only when it becomes her.\"\n\n\"Of course you do, Mrs. Sturt.\"\n\n\"It isn't for me, Mrs. Butler, to say anything against your papa.\nNobody can have more respect for their clergyman than Sturt has and\nI; and before it was all settled like, Sturt never had a word with\nMr. Comfort about tithes; but, Mrs. Butler, I think your papa was\nwrong here. As far as I can learn, it was he that told Mrs. Ray that\nthis young man wasn't all that he should be.\"\n\n\"Papa meant it for the best. There were strange things said about\nhim, you know.\"\n\n\"I never believes one word of what I hears, and never will. People\nare such liars; bean't they, Mrs. Butler? And I didn't believe a word\nagain him. He's as fine a young man as you'd wish to see in a hundred\nyears, and of course that goes a long way with a young woman. Well,\nMrs. Butler, I'll tell Mrs. Ray what you say, but I'm afeard it's too\nlate; I'm afeard it is. He's of a stubborn sort, I think. He's one\nof them that says, 'If you will not when you may, when you will you\nshall have nay.'\"\n\nMrs. Cornbury still entertained hope that the stubbornness of the\nstubborn man might be overcome; but as to that she said nothing to\nMrs. Sturt.\n\nMrs. Sturt, with what friendly tact she possessed, made her\ncommunication to Mrs. Ray, but it may be doubted whether more harm\nthan good was not thus done. \"And he didn't owe a shilling then?\"\nasked Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Not a shilling,\" said Mrs. Sturt.\n\n\"And he is going to come back to Baslehurst about this brewery\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"There's not a doubt in life about that,\" answered Mrs. Sturt. If\nthese tidings could have come in time they would have been very\nsalutary; but what was Mrs. Ray to do with them now? She felt that\nshe could not honestly withhold them from Rachel; and yet she knew\nnot how to tell them without adding to Rachel's misery. It was very\nimprobable that Rachel should hear anything about Rowan from other\nlips than her own. It was clear that Mrs. Sturt did not intend to\nspeak to her, and also clear that Mrs. Sturt expected that Mrs. Ray\nwould do so.\n\nRachel's demeanour at this time was cause of great sorrow to Mrs.\nRay. She never smiled. She sought no amusement. She read no books.\nShe spoke but little, and when she did speak her words were hard and\ncold, and confined almost entirely to household affairs. Her mother\nknew that she was not ill, because she ate and drank and worked. Even\nDorothea must have been satisfied with the amount of needlework which\nshe produced in these days. But though not ill, she was thin and\npale, and unlike herself. But perhaps of all the signs which her\nmother watched so carefully, the signs which tormented her most were\nthose ever-present lines on her daughter's forehead,--lines which\nMrs. Ray had now learned to read correctly, and which indicated some\nsettled inward purpose, and an inward resolve that that purpose\nshould become the subject of no outward discussion. Rachel had\nformerly been everything to her mother;--her friend, her minister,\nher guide, her great comfort;--the subject on which could be lavished\nall the soft tenderness of her nature, the loving object to whom\ncould be addressed all the little innocent petulances of her life.\nBut now Mrs. Ray did not dare to be either tender with Rachel, or\npetulant. She hardly dared to speak to her on subjects that were not\nindifferent. On this matter of Luke Rowan she did not dare to speak\nto her. Rachel never upbraided her with words,--had never spoken\none word of reproach. But every moment of their passing life was an\nunspoken reproach, so severe and heavy that the poor mother hardly\nknew how to bear the burden of her fault.\n\nAs Mrs. Ray became more afraid of her younger daughter she became\nless afraid of the elder. This was occasioned partly, no doubt, by\nthe absence of Mrs. Prime from the cottage. When there she only\ncame as a visitor; and no visitor to a house can hold such dominion\nthere as may be held by a domestic tyrant, present at all meals, and\nclaiming an ascendancy in all conversations. But it arose in part\nalso from the overwhelming solicitude which filled Mrs. Ray's heart\nfrom morning to night, as she watched poor Rachel in her misery. Her\nbowels yearned towards her child, and she longed to give her relief\nwith an excessive longing. Had the man been a very wolf indeed,--such\nwere her feelings at present,--I think that she would have welcomed\nhim to the cottage. In ordering his repulse she had done a deed of\nwhich she had by no means anticipated the consequences, and now she\nrepented in the sackcloth and ashes of a sorrow-stricken spirit. Ah\nme! what could she do to relieve that oppressed one! So thoroughly\ndid this desire override all others in her breast, that she\nwould snub Mrs. Prime without dreading or even thinking of the\nconsequences. Her only hopes and her only fears at the present moment\nhad reference to Rachel. Had Rachel proposed to her that they should\nboth start off to London and there search for Luke Rowan, I doubt\nwhether she would have had the heart to decline the journey.\n\nIn these days Mrs. Prime came to the cottage regularly twice a\nweek,--on Wednesdays and Saturdays. On Wednesday she came after tea,\nand on Saturday she drank tea with her mother. On these occasions\nmuch was, of course, said as to the prospect of her marriage with\nMr. Prong. Nothing was as yet settled, and Rachel had concluded, in\nher own mind, that there would be no such wedding. As to Mrs. Ray's\nopinion, she, of course, thought there would be a wedding or that\nthere would not, in accordance with the last words spoken by Mrs.\nPrime to herself on the occasion of that special conversation.\n\n\"She'll never give up her money,\" Rachel had said, \"and he'll never\nmarry her unless she does.\"\n\nMrs. Prime at this period acknowledged to her mother that she was not\nhappy.\n\n\"I want,\" said she, \"to do what's right. But it's not always easy to\nfind out what is right.\"\n\n\"That's very true,\" said Mrs. Ray, thinking that there were\ndifficulties in the affairs of other people quite as embarrassing as\nthose of which Mrs. Prime complained.\n\n\"He says,\" continued the younger widow, \"that he wants nothing for\nhimself, but that it is not fitting that a married woman should have\na separate income.\"\n\n\"I think he's right there,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"I quite believe what he says about himself,\" said Mrs. Prime. \"It is\nnot that he wants my money for the money's sake, but that he chooses\nto dictate to me how I shall use it.\"\n\n\"So he ought if he's to be your husband,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\nThese conversations usually took place in Rachel's absence. When Mrs.\nPrime came Rachel would remain long enough to say a word to her, and\non the Saturdays would pour out the tea for her and would hand to her\nthe bread and butter with the courtesy due to a visitor; but after\nthat she would take herself to her own bedroom, and only come down\nwhen Mrs. Prime had prepared herself for going. At last, on one of\nthese evenings, there came a proposition from Mrs. Prime that she\nshould return to the cottage, and live again with her mother and\nsister. She had not said that she had absolutely rejected Mr. Prong,\nbut she spoke of her return as though it had become expedient because\nthe cause of her going away had been removed. Very little had been\nsaid between her and her mother about Rachel's love affair, nor was\nMrs. Prime inclined to say much about it now; but so much as that\nshe did say. \"No doubt it's all over now about that young man, and\ntherefore, if you like it, I don't see why I shouldn't come back.\"\n\n\"I don't at all know about it's being all over,\" said Mrs. Ray, in a\nhurried quick tone, and as she spoke she blushed with emotion.\n\n\"But I suppose it is, mother. From all that I can hear he isn't\nthinking of her; and I don't suppose he ever did much.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he's thinking about, Dorothea; and I ain't sure\nthat there's any good talking about it. Besides, if you're going to\nhave Mr. Prong at last--\"\n\n\"If I did, mother, it needn't prevent my coming here for a month or\ntwo first. It wouldn't be quite yet certainly,--if at all. And I\nthought that perhaps, if I am going to settle myself in that way,\nyou'd be glad that we should be altogether again for a little while.\"\n\n\"So I should, Dorothea,--of course. I have never wanted to be divided\nfrom my children. Your going away was your own doing, not mine. I'm\nsure it made me so wretched I didn't know what to do at the time.\nOnly other things have come since, that have pretty nearly put all\nthat out of my mind.\"\n\n\"But you can't think I was wrong to go when I felt it to be right.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that may be,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"If you thought it\nright to go I suppose you were right to go; but perhaps you shouldn't\nhave had such thoughts.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, we won't go back to that.\"\n\n\"No; we won't, if you please.\"\n\n\"This at any rate is certain, that Rachel, in departing from our\nusual ways of life, has brought great unhappiness upon herself. I'm\nafraid she is thinking of this young man now more than she ought to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Of course she is thinking of him. Why should she not think of him?\"\n\n\"Why, mother! Surely it cannot be good that any girl should think of\na man who thinks nothing of her!\"\n\nThen Mrs. Ray spoke out,--as perhaps she had never spoken before.\n\n\"What right have you to say that he thinks nothing of her? Who can\ntell? He did think of her,--as honestly as any man ever thought of\nthe woman he wished to mate with. He came to her fairly, and asked\nher to be his wife. What can any man do more by a girl than that? And\nshe didn't say a word to him to encourage him till those she had a\nright to look to had encouraged him too. So she didn't. And I don't\nbelieve any woman ever had a child that behaved better, or truer, or\nmore maidenly than she has done. And I was a fool, and worse than a\nfool, when I allowed any one to have an evil thought of her for a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Do you mean me, mother?\"\n\n\"I don't mean anybody except myself; so I don't.\" Mrs. Ray as she\nspoke was weeping bitterly, and rubbing the tears from her red eyes\nwith her apron. \"I've behaved like a fool to her,--worse than a\nfool,--and I've broken her heart. Not think of him! How's a girl\nnot to think of a man day and night when she loves him better than\nherself? Think of him! She'll think of him till she's in her grave.\nShe'll think of him till she's past all other thinking. I hate such\ncruelty; and I hate myself for having been cruel. I shall never\nforgive myself, the longest day I have to live.\"\n\n\"You only did your duty, mother.\"\n\n\"No; I didn't do my duty at all. It can't be a mother's duty to break\nher child's heart and to be set against her by what anybody else can\nsay. She was ever and always the best child that ever lived; and\nshe came away from him, and strove to banish him from her thoughts,\nand wouldn't own to herself that she cared for him the least in the\nworld, till he'd come here and spoken out straight, like a man as he\nis. I tell you what, Dorothea, I'd go to London, on my knees to him,\nif I could bring him back to her! I would. And if he comes here, I\nwill go to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother!\"\n\n\"I know he loves her. He's not one of your inconstant ones that take\nup with a girl for a week or so and then forgets her. But she has\noffended him, and he's stubborn. She has offended him at my bidding,\nand it's my doing;--and I'd humble myself in the dust to bring him\nback to her;--so I would. Never tell me of her not thinking of him.\nI tell you, Dorothea, she'll think of him always not because she has\nloved him, but because she has been brought to confess her love.\"\n\nMrs. Ray was so strong in her mingled passion and grief, that Mrs.\nPrime made no attempt to rebuke her. The daughter was indeed quelled\nby her mother's vehemence, and felt that for the present the subject\nof Rachel's love and Rachel's lover was not a fitting one for the\nexercise of her own talents as a preacher. The tragedy had progressed\nbeyond the reach of her preaching. Mrs. Ray protested that Rachel\nhad been right throughout, and that she herself had been wrong only\nwhen she had opposed Rachel's wishes. Such a view of the matter was\naltogether at variance with that entertained by Mrs. Prime, who was\nstill of opinion that young people shouldn't be allowed to please\nthemselves, and who feared the approach of any lover who came with\nlute in hand, and with light, soft, loving, worldly words. Men\nand women, according to her theory, were right to marry and have\nchildren; but she thought that such marriages should be contracted\nnot only in a solemn spirit, but with a certain dinginess of\nsolemnity, with a painstaking absence of mirth, that would divest\nlove of its worldly alloy. Rachel had gone about her business in a\ndifferent spirit, and it may almost be said that Mrs. Prime rejoiced\nthat she had failed. She did not believe in broken hearts; she did\nbelieve in the efficacy of chastisement; and she thought that on the\nwhole the present state of affairs would be beneficial to her sister.\nHad she been possessed of sufficient power she would now, on this\noccasion, have preached her sermon again as she had preached it\nbefore; but her mother's passion had overcome her, and she was unable\nto express her convictions.\n\n\"I hope that she will be better soon,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope she will,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\nAt this moment Rachel came down from her own room and joined them in\nthe parlour. She came in with that same look of sad composure on her\nface, as though she were determined to speak nothing of her thoughts\nto any one, and sat herself down near to her sister. In doing so,\nhowever, she caught a glimpse of her mother's face, and saw that she\nhad been crying,--saw, indeed, that she was still crying at that\nmoment.\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"what is the matter;--has anything happened?\"\n\n\"No, dear, nothing;--nothing has happened.\"\n\n\"But you would not cry for nothing. What is it, Dolly?\"\n\n\"We have been talking,\" said Dorothea. \"Things in this world are not\nso pleasant in themselves that they can always be spoken of without\ntears,--either outward tears or inward. People are too apt to think\nthat there is no true significance in their words when they say that\nthis world is a vale of tears.\"\n\n\"All the same. I don't like to see mamma crying like that.\"\n\n\"Don't mind it, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"If you will not regard me I\nshall be better soon.\"\n\n\"I was saying that I thought I would come back to the cottage,\" said\nMrs. Prime; \"that is, if mother likes it.\"\n\n\"But that did not make mamma cry.\"\n\n\"There were other things arose out of my saying so.\" Then Rachel\nasked no further questions, but sat silent, waiting till her sister\nshould go.\n\n\"Of course we shall be very glad to have you back again if it suits\nyou to come,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"I don't think it at all nice that a\nfamily should be divided,--that is, as long as they are the same\nfamily.\" Having received so much encouragement with reference to her\nproposed return, Mrs. Prime took her departure and walked back to\nBaslehurst.\n\nFor some minutes after they had been so left, neither Mrs. Ray nor\nRachel spoke. The mother sat rocking herself in her chair, and the\ndaughter remained motionless in the seat which she had taken when she\nfirst came into the room. Their faces were not turned to each other,\nbut Rachel was so placed that she could watch her mother without\nbeing observed. Every now and again Mrs. Ray would put her hand up to\nher eyes to squeeze away the tears, and a low gurgling sound would\ncome from her, as though she were striving without success to repress\nher sobs. She had thought that she would speak to Rachel when Mrs.\nPrime was gone,--that she would confess her error in having sent\nRowan away, and implore her child to pardon her and to love her once\nagain. It was not, however, that she doubted Rachel's love,--that she\nfeared that Rachel was casting her out from her heart, or that she\nwas learning to hate her. She knew well enough that her child still\nloved her. It was this,--that her life had become barren to her,\ncold, and altogether tasteless without those thousand little signs of\never-present affection to which she had been accustomed. If it was to\nbe always thus between them, what would the world be to her for the\nremainder of her days? She could have borne to part with Rachel, had\nRachel married, as in parting with her she would have looked forward\nto some future return of her girl's caresses; and in such case she\nwould at least have felt that her loss had come from no cessation of\nthe sweet loving nature of their mutual connexion. She would have\nwept as she gave Rachel over to a husband, but her tears would have\nbeen sweet as well as bitter. But there was nothing of sweetness\nin her tears as she shed them now,--nothing of satisfaction in her\nsorrow. If she could get Rachel to talk with her freely on the\nmatter, if she could find an opportunity for confessing herself to\nhave been wrong, might it not be that the soft caresses would be\nrestored to her,--caresses that would be soft, though moistened with\nsalt tears? But she feared to speak to her child. She knew that\nRachel's face was still hard and stern, and that her voice was not\nthe voice of other days. She knew that her daughter brooded over\nthe injury that had been done to her,--though she knew also that no\naccusation was made, even in the girl's own bosom, against herself.\nShe thoroughly understood the state of Rachel's mind, but she was\nunable to find the words that might serve to soften it.\n\n\"I suppose we may as well go to bed,\" she said at last, giving the\nmatter up, at any rate for that evening.\n\n\"Mamma, why were you crying when I came into the room?\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Was I crying, my dear?\"\n\n\"You are crying still, mamma. Is it I that make you unhappy?\"\n\nMrs. Ray was anxious to declare that the reverse of that was\ntrue,--that it was she who had made the other unhappy; but even\nnow she could not find the words in which to say this. \"No,\" she\nsaid; \"it isn't you. It isn't anybody. I believe it's true what Mr.\nComfort has told us so often when he's preaching. It's all vanity and\nvexation. There isn't anything to make anybody happy. I suppose I cry\nbecause I'm foolisher than other people. I don't know that anybody is\nhappy. I'm sure Dorothea is not, and I'm sure you ain't.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to be unhappy about me, mamma.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't. I know that. But how can I help it when I see\nhow things have gone? I tried to do for the best, and I have--\"\nbroken my child's heart, Mrs. Ray intended to say; but she failed\naltogether before she got as far as that, and bursting out into a\nflood of tears, hid her face in her apron.\n\nRachel still kept her seat, and her face was still hard and unmoved.\nHer mother did not see it; she did not dare to look upon it; but she\nknew that it was so; she knew her daughter would have been with her,\nclose to her, embracing her, throwing her arms round her, had that\nface relented. But Rachel still kept her chair, and Mrs. Ray sobbed\naloud.\n\n\"I wish I could be a comfort to you, mamma,\" Rachel said after\nanother pause, \"but I do not know how. I suppose in time we shall get\nover this, and things will be as they used to be.\"\n\n\"They'll never be to me as they used to be before he came to\nBaslehurst,\" said Mrs. Ray, through her tears.\n\n\"At any rate that is not his fault,\" said Rachel, almost angrily.\n\"Whoever may have done wrong, no one has a right to say that he has\ndone wrong.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I never said so. It is I that have done wrong,\" exclaimed\nMrs. Ray. \"I know it all now, and I wish I'd never asked anybody but\njust my own heart. I didn't mean to say anything against him, and I\ndon't think it. I'm sure I liked him as I never liked any young man\nthe first time of seeing him, that night he came out here to tea; and\nI know that what they said against him was all false. So I do.\"\n\n\"What was all false, mamma?\"\n\n\"About his going away in debt, and being a ne'er-do-well, and\nabout his going away from Baslehurst and not coming back any more.\nEverybody has a good word for him now.\"\n\n\"Have they, mamma?\" said Rachel. And Mrs. Ray learned in a moment,\nfrom the tone of her daughter's voice, that a change had come over\nher feeling. She asked her little question with something of the\nsoftness of her old manner, with something of the longing loving\nwishfulness which used to make so many of her questions sweet to her\nmother's ears. \"Have they, mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes they have, and I believe it was those wicked people at the\nbrewery who spread the reports about him. As for owing anybody money,\nI believe he's got plenty. Of course he has, or how could he have\nbought our cottages and paid for them all in a minute? And I believe\nhe'll come back and live at Baslehurst; so I do; only--\"\n\n\"Only what, mamma?\"\n\n\"If he's not to come back to you I'd rather that he never showed his\nface here again.\"\n\n\"He won't come to me, mamma. Had he meant it, he would have sent me a\nmessage.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he meant that he wouldn't send the message till he came\nhimself,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\nBut she made the suggestion in a voice so full of conscious doubt\nthat Rachel knew that she did not believe in it herself.\n\n\"I don't think he means that, mamma. If he did why should he keep me\nin doubt? He is very true and very honest, but I think he is very\nhard. When I wrote to him in that way after accepting the love he had\noffered me, he was angered, and felt that I was false to him. He is\nvery honest, but I think he must be very hard.\"\n\n\"I can't think that if he loved you he would be so hard as that.\"\n\n\"Men are different from women, I suppose. I feel about him that\nwhatever he might do I should forgive it. But then I feel, also, that\nhe would never do anything for me to forgive.\"\n\n\"I'll never forgive him, never, if he doesn't come back again.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, mamma. You've no right even to be angry with\nhim, because it was we who told him that there was to be no\nengagement,--after I had promised him.\"\n\n\"I didn't think he'd take you up so at the first word,\" said Mrs.\nRay;--and then there was again silence for a few minutes.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Well, Rachel.\"\n\nMrs. Ray was still rocking her chair, and had hardly yet repressed\nthat faint gurgling sound of half-controlled sobs.\n\n\"I am so glad to hear you say that you--respect him, and don't\nbelieve of him what people have said.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word bad of him, except that he oughtn't to take\nhuff in that way at one word that a girl says to him. He ought to\nhave known that you couldn't write just what letter you liked, as he\ncould.\"\n\n\"We won't say anything more about that. But as long as you don't\nthink him bad--\"\n\n\"I don't think him bad. I don't think him bad at all. I think him\nvery good. I'd give all I have in the world to bring him back again.\nSo I would.\"\n\n\"Dear mamma!\"\n\nAnd now Rachel moved away from her chair and came up to her mother.\n\n\"And I know it's been all my fault. Oh, my child, I am so unhappy!\nI don't get half an hour's sleep at night thinking of what I have\ndone;--I, that would have given the very blood out of my veins to\nmake you happy.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; it wasn't you.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was. I'd no business going away to other people after I had\ntold him he might come here. You, who had always been so good too!\"\n\n\"You mustn't say again that you wish he hadn't come here.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I do wish it, because then he would have been nothing to\nyou. I do wish he hadn't ever come, but now I'd do anything to bring\nhim back again. I believe I'll go to him and tell him that it was my\ndoing.\"\n\n\"No, mamma, you won't do that.\"\n\n\"Why should I not? I don't care what people say. Isn't your happiness\neverything to me?\"\n\n\"But I shouldn't take him if he came in that way. What! beg him\nto come and have compassion on me, as if I couldn't live without\nhim! No, mother; that wouldn't do. I do love him. I do love him. I\nsometimes think I cannot live without his love. I sometimes feel as\nthough stories about broken hearts might be true. But I wouldn't have\nhim in that way. How could he love me afterwards, when I was his\nwife? But, mamma, we'll be friends again;--shall we not? I've been so\nunhappy that you should have thought ill of him!\"\n\nThat night the mother and daughter shared the same bed together, and\nMrs. Ray was able to sleep. She would not confess to herself that\nher sorrow had been lightened, because nothing had been said or done\nto lessen that of her daughter; but on the morrow Rachel came and\nhovered round her again, and the bitterness of Mrs. Ray's grief was\nremoved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE ELECTION AT BASLEHURST.\n\n\nTowards the end of September the day of the election arrived, and\nwith it arrived Luke Rowan at Baslehurst. The vacancy had been\noccasioned by the acceptance of the then sitting member of that\nsituation under the crown which is called the stewardship of the\nmanor of Helpholme. In other words an old gentleman who had done his\nlife's work retired and made room for some one more young and active.\nThe old member had kept his seat till the end of the session, just\nleaving time for the moving for a new writ, and now the election was\nabout to be held, almost at the earliest day possible. It had been\nthought that a little reflection would induce the Baslehurst people\nto reject the smiles of the Jew tailor from London, and therefore as\nlittle time for reflection was given to them as possible. The wealth,\nthe liberal politics, the generosity, and the successes of Mr. Hart\nwere dinned into their ears by a succession of speeches, and by an\noverpowering flight of enormous posters; and then the Jewish hero,\nthe tailor himself, came among them, and astonished their minds by\nthe ease and volubility of his speeches. He did not pronounce his\nwords with any of those soft slushy Judaic utterances by which they\nhad been taught to believe he would disgrace himself. His nose was\nnot hookey, with any especial hook, nor was it thicker at the bridge\nthan was becoming. He was a dapper little man, with bright eyes,\nquick motion, ready tongue, and a very new hat. It seemed that\nhe knew well how to canvass. He had a smile and a good word for\nall,--enemies as well as friends. The task of abusing the Cornbury\nparty he left to his committee and backers. He spent a great deal of\nmoney,--throwing it away in every direction in which he could do so,\nwithout laying himself open to the watchful suspicion of the other\nside. He ate and drank like a Christian, and only laughed aloud when\nsome true defender of the Protestant faith attempted to scare him\naway out of the streets by carrying a gammon of bacon up on high.\nPerhaps his strength as a popular candidate was best shown by his\ndrinking a pint of Tappitt's beer in the little parlour behind the\nbar at the Dragon.\n\n\"He beats me there,\" said Butler Cornbury, when he heard of that\nfeat.\n\nBut the action was a wise one. The question as to Tappitt's brewery\nand Tappitt's beer was running high at Baslehurst, and in no stronger\nway could Mr. Hart have bound to him the Tappitt faction than by\nswallowing in public that pint of beer. \"Let me have a small glass of\nbrandy at once,\" said Mr. Hart to his servant, having retired to his\nroom immediately after the performance of the feat. His constitution\nwas good, and I may as well at once declare that before half an hour\nhad passed over his head he was again himself, and at his work.\n\nThe question of Tappitt's beer and Tappitt's brewery was running\nhigh in Baslehurst, and had gotten itself involved in the mouths of\nthe people of Baslehurst, not only with the loves and sorrows of\npoor Rachel Ray, but with the affairs of this election. We know how\nTappitt had been driven to declare himself a stanch supporter of the\nJew. He had become very stanch,--stanch beyond the promising of his\nown vote,--stanch even to a final sitting on the Jew's committee,\nand an active canvasser on the Jew's behalf. His wife, whose\npassions were less strong than his own and her prudence greater, had\nremonstrated with him on the matter. \"You can vote against Cornbury,\nif you please,\" she had said, \"but do it quietly. Keep your toe in\nyour pump and say nothing. Just as we stand at present about the\nbusiness of Rowan's, it would almost be better that you shouldn't\nvote at all.\" But Tappitt was an angry man, at this moment\nuncontrollable by the laws of prudence, and he went into these\nelection matters heart and soul, to his wife's great grief. Butler\nCornbury, or Mrs. Butler Cornbury,--it was all the same to him\nwhich,--had openly taken up Rowan's part in the brewery controversy.\nA rumour had reached Tappitt that the inmates of Cornbury Grange had\nloudly expressed a desire for good beer! Under such circumstances it\nwas not possible for him not to rush to the fight. He did rush into\nthe thick of it, and boasted among his friends that the Jew was safe.\nI think he was right,--right at any rate as regarded his own peace\nof mind. Nothing gives a man such spirit for a fight, as the act of\nfighting. During these election days he was almost regardless of\nRowan. He was to second the nomination of the Jew, and so keen was\nhe as to the speech that he would make, and as to the success of what\nhe was doing against Mr. Cornbury, that he was able to talk down his\nwife, and browbeat Honyman in his own office. Honyman was about to\nvote for Butler Cornbury, was employed in the Cornbury interest, and\nknew well on which side his bread was buttered. Sharpit and Longfite\nwere local attorneys for the Jew, and in this way Tappitt was thrown\ninto close intercourse with that eminent firm. \"Of course we wouldn't\ninterfere,\" said Sharpit confidently to the brewer. \"We never do\ninterfere with the clients of another firm. We never did such a thing\nyet, and don't mean to begin. We find people drop into us quick\nenough without that. But in a friendly way, Mr. Tappitt, let me\ncaution you, not to let your fine business be injured by that young\nsharper.\"\n\nMr. Tappitt found this to be very kind,--and very sensible too. He\ngave no authority to Sharpit on that occasion to act for him; but he\nthought of it, resolving that he would set his shoulders firmly to\nthat wheel as soon as he had carried through this business of the\nelection.\n\nBut even in the matter of the election everything did not go well\nwith Tappitt. He had appertaining to his establishment a certain\nforeman of the name of Worts, a heavy, respectable, useful man,\neducated on the establishment by Bungall and bequeathed by Bungall\nto Tappitt,--a man by no means ambitious of good beer, but very\nambitious of profits to the firm, a servant indeed almost invaluable\nin such a business. But Tappitt had ever found him deficient in\nthis,--that he had a certain objectionable pride in having been\nBungall's servant, and that as such he thought himself absolved from\nthe necessity of subserviency to his latter master. Once a day indeed\nhe did touch his cap, but when that was done he seemed to fancy that\nhe was almost equal to Mr. Tappitt upon the premises. He never shook\nin his shoes if Tappitt were angry, nor affected to hasten his steps\nif Tappitt were in a hurry, nor would he even laugh at Tappitt's\njokes, if,--as was too usual,--such jokes were not mirth-moving in\ntheir intrinsic nature. Clearly he was not at all points a good\nservant, and Tappitt in some hours of his prosperity had ventured to\nthink that the brewery could go on without him. Now, since the day\nin which Rowan's treachery had first loomed upon Tappitt, he had\nfelt much inclined to fraternize on easier terms with his foreman.\nWorts when he touched his cap had been received with a smile, and\nhis advice had been asked in a flattering tone,--not demanded as\nbelonging to the establishment by right. Then Tappitt began to talk\nof Rowan to his man, and to speak evil things of him, as was natural,\nexpecting a reciprocity of malignity from Worts. But Worts on such\noccasions had been ominously silent. \"H--m, I bean't so zure o'\nthat,\" Worts had once said, thus differing from his master on some\nfundamental point of Tappitt strategy as opposed to Rowan strategy.\n\"Ain't you?\" said Tappitt, showing his teeth. \"You'd better go now\nand look after those men at the carts.\" Worts had looked after the\nmen at the carts, but he had done so with an idea in his head that\nperhaps he would not long look after Tappitt's men or Tappitt's\ncarts. He had not himself been ambitious of good beer, but the idea\nhad almost startled him into acquiescence by its brilliancy.\n\nNow Worts had a vote in the borough, and it came to Tappitt's ears\nthat his servant intended to give that vote to Mr. Cornbury. \"Worts,\"\nsaid he, a day or two before the election, \"of course you intend to\nvote for Mr. Hart?\"\n\nWorts touched his cap, for it was the commencement of the day.\n\n\"I don't jest know,\" said he. \"I was thinking of woting for the young\nsquoire. I've know'd him ever since he was born, and I ain't never\nknow'd the Jew gentleman;--never at all.\"\n\n\"Look here, Worts; if you intend to remain in this establishment I\nshall expect you to support the liberal interest, as I support it\nmyself. The liberal interest has always been supported in Baslehurst\nby Bungall and Tappitt ever since Bungall and Tappitt have existed.\"\n\n\"The old maister, he wouldn't a woted for ere a Jew in\nChristendom,--not agin the squoire. The old maister was allays for\nthe Protestant religion.\"\n\n\"Very well, Worts; there can't be two ways of thinking here, that's\nall; especially not at such a time as this, when there's more\nreason than ever why those connected with the brewery should all\nstand shoulder to shoulder. You've had your bread out of this\nestablishment, Worts, for a great many years.\"\n\n\"And I've 'arned it hard;--no man can't say otherwise. The sweat\no' my body belongs to the brewery, but I didn't ever sell 'em my\nwote;--and I don't mean.\" Saying which words, with an emphasis that\nwas by no means servile, Worts went out from the presence of his\nmaster.\n\n\"That man's turning against me,\" said Tappitt to his wife at\nbreakfast time, in almost mute despair.\n\n\"What! Worts?\" said Mrs. Tappitt.\n\n\"Yes;--the ungrateful hound. He's been about the place almost ever\nsince he could speak, for more than forty years. He's had two pound a\nweek for the last ten years;--and now he's turning against me.\"\n\n\"Is he going over to Rowan?\"\n\n\"I don't know where the d---- he's going. He's going to vote for\nButler Cornbury, and that's enough for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, T., I wouldn't mind that; especially not just now. Only think\nwhat a help he'll be to that man!\"\n\n\"I tell you he shall walk out of the brewery the week after this, if\nhe votes for Cornbury. There isn't room for two opinions here, and I\nwon't have it.\"\n\nFor a moment or two Mrs. Tappitt sat mute, almost in despair. Then\nshe took courage and spoke out.\n\n\"T.,\" said she, \"it won't do.\"\n\n\"What won't do?\"\n\n\"All this won't do. We shall be ruined and left without a home. I\ndon't mind myself; I never did; but think of the girls! What would\nthey do if we was turned out of this?\"\n\n\"Who's to turn you out?\"\n\n\"I know. I see it. I am beginning to understand. T., that man would\nnot go against you and the brewery if he didn't know which way the\nwind is blowing. Worts is wide awake,--quite wide; he always was. T.,\nyou must take the offer Rowan has made of a regular income and live\nretired. If you don't do it,--I shall!\" And Mrs. Tappitt, as she\nspoke the audacious words, rose up from her chair, and stood with her\narms leaning upon the table.\n\n\"What!\" said Tappitt, sitting aghast with his mouth open.\n\n\"Yes, T.; if you don't think of your family I must. What I'm saying\nMr. Honyman has said before; and indeed all Baslehurst is saying the\nsame thing. There's an offer made to you that will put your family on\na footing quite genteel,--no gentlefolks in the county more so; and\nyou, too, that are getting past your work!\"\n\n\"I ain't getting past my work.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't say so, T., if it weren't for your own good,--and if\nI'm not to know about that, who is? It's all very well going about\nelectioneering; and indeed it's just what gentlefolks is fit for when\nthey're past their regular work; And I'm sure I shan't begrudge it so\nlong as it don't cost anything; but that's not work you know, T.\"\n\n\"Ain't I in the brewery every day for seven or eight hours, and often\nmore?\"\n\n\"Yes, T., you are; and what's like to come of it if you go on so?\nWhat would be my feelings if I saw you brought into the house struck\ndown with apoplepsy and paralepsy because I let you go on in that way\nwhen you wasn't fit? No, T.; I know my duty and I mean to do it. You\nknow Dr. Haustus said only last month that you were that bilious--\"\n\n\"Pshaw! bilious! it's enough to make any man bilious!\"\n\n\"Or any dog,\" he would have added, had he thought of it. Thereupon\nTappitt rushed away from his wife, back into his little office,\nand from that soon made his way to the Jew's committee-room at the\nDragon, at which he was detained till nearly eleven o'clock at night.\n\n\"It's a kind of work in which one has to do as much after dinner as\nbefore,\" he said to his wife when he got back.\n\n\"For the matter of that,\" said she, \"I think the after-dinner work is\nthe chief part of it.\"\n\nOn the day of the election Luke Rowan was to be seen standing in the\nHigh Street talking to Butler Cornbury the candidate. Rowan was not\nan elector, for the cottages had not been in his possession long\nenough to admit of his obtaining from them a qualification to vote;\nbut he was a declared friend of the Cornbury party. Mrs. Butler\nCornbury had sent a message to him saying that she hoped to see him\nsoon after the election should be over: on the following day or on\nthe next, and Butler Cornbury himself had come to him in the town.\nThough absent from Baslehurst Rowan had managed to declare his\nopinions before that time, and was suspected by many to have written\nthose articles in the \"Baslehurst Gazette\" which advocated the right\nof any constituency to send a Jew to Parliament if it pleased, but\nwhich proved at the same time that any constituency must be wrong to\nsend any Jew to Parliament, and that the constituency of Baslehurst\nwould in the present instance be specially wrong to send Mr. Hart to\nParliament. \"We have always advocated,\" said one of these articles,\n\"the right of absolute freedom of choice for every borough and every\ncounty in the land; but we trust that the day is far distant in\nwhich the electors of England shall cease to look to their nearest\nneighbours as their best representatives.\" There wasn't much in the\nargument, but it suited the occasion, and added strength to Rowan's\nown cause in the borough. All the stanch Protestants began to feel a\nwant of good beer. Questions very ill-natured as toward Tappitt were\nasked in the newspapers. \"Who owns The Spotted Dog at Busby-porcorum;\nand who compels the landlord to buy his liquor at Tappitt's brewery?\"\nThere were scores of questions of the same nature, all of which\nTappitt attributed, wrongly, to Luke Rowan. Luke had written that\narticle about freedom of election, but he had not condescended to\nnotice the beer at the Spotted Dog.\n\nAnd there was another quarrel taking place in Baslehurst, on the\nscore of that election, between persons with whom we are connected\nin this story. Mr. Prong had a vote in the borough, and was disposed\nto make use of it; and Mrs. Prime, regarding her own position as Mr.\nProng's affianced bride, considered herself at liberty to question\nMr. Prong as to the use which he proposed to make of that vote.\nTo Mrs. Prime it appeared that anything done in any direction for\nthe benefit of a Jew was a sin not to be forgiven. To Mr. Prong it\nseemed to be as great a sin not to do anything in his power for\nthe hindrance and vexation of those with whom Dr. Harford and Mr.\nComfort were connected by ties of friendship. Mrs. Prime, who, of\nthe two, was the more logical, would not disjoin her personal and\nher scriptural hatreds. She also hated Dr. Harford; but she hated\nthe Jews more. She was not disposed to support a Jew in Baslehurst\nbecause Mr. Comfort, in his doctrines, had fallen away from the\npurity of his early promise. Her idea was that a just man and a good\nChristian could not vote for either of the Baslehurst candidates\nunder the present unhappy local circumstances;--but that under\nno circumstances should a Christian vote for a Jew. All this she\nsaid, in a voice not so soft as should be the voice of woman to her\nbetrothed.\n\n\"Dorothea,\" said Mr. Prong very solemnly;--they were sitting at the\ntime in his own little front parlour, as to the due arrangement of\nthe furniture in which Mrs. Prime had already ventured to make some\nslight alterations which had not been received favourably by Mr.\nProng,--\"Dorothea, in this matter you must allow me to be the best\njudge. Voting for Members of Parliament is a thing which ladies\nnaturally are not called upon to understand.\"\n\n\"Ladies can understand as well as gentlemen,\" said Mrs. Prime, \"that\na curse has gone out from the Lord against that people; and gentlemen\nhave no more right than ladies to go against the will of the Lord.\"\n\nIt was in vain that Mr. Prong endeavoured to explain to her that the\ncurse attached to the people as a nation, and did not necessarily\nfollow units of that people who had adopted other nationalities.\n\n\"Let the units become Christians before they go into Parliament,\"\nsaid Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"I wish they would,\" said Mr. Prong. \"I heartily wish they would: and\nMr. Hart, if he be returned, shall have my prayers.\"\n\nBut this did not at all suffice for Mrs. Prime, who, perhaps, in the\nmatter of argument had the best of it. She told her betrothed to his\nface that he was going to commit a great sin, and that he was tempted\nto this sin by grievous worldly passions. When so informed Mr. Prong\nclosed his eyes, crossed his hands meekly on his breast, and shook\nhis head.\n\n\"Not from thee, Dorothea,\" said he, \"not from thee should this have\ncome.\"\n\n\"Who is to speak out to you if I am not?\" said she.\n\nBut Mr. Prong sat in silence, and with closed eyes again shook his\nhead.\n\n\"Perhaps we had better part,\" said Mrs. Prime, after an interval of\nfive minutes. \"Perhaps it will be better for both of us.\"\n\nMr. Prong, however, still shook his head in silence; and it was\ndifficult for a lady in Mrs. Prime's position to read accurately the\nmeaning of such shakings under such circumstances. But Mrs. Prime\nwas a woman sufficiently versed in the world's business to be able\nto resolve that she would have an answer to her question when she\nrequired an answer.\n\n\"Mr. Prong,\" she said, \"I remarked just now that perhaps we had\nbetter part.\"\n\n\"I heard the words,\" said Mr. Prong,--\"I heard the cruel words.\" But\neven then he did not open his eyes, or remove his hands from his\nbreast. \"I heard the words, and I heard those other words, still\nmore cruel. You had better leave me now that I may humble myself in\nprayer.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, Mr. Prong, and I'm sure I hope you will; but\nsituated as we are, of course I should choose to have an answer. It\nseems to me that you dislike that kind of interference which I regard\nas a wife's best privilege and sweetest duty. If this be so, it will\nbe better for us to part,--as friends of course.\"\n\n\"You have accused me of a great sin,\" he said; \"of a great sin;--of a\ngreat sin!\"\n\n\"And so in my mind it would be.\"\n\n\"Judge not, lest ye be judged, Dorothea; remember that.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean, Mr. Prong, that we are not to have our opinions,\nand that we are not to warn those that are near us when we see them\nwalking in the wrong path. I might as well say the same to you, when\nyou--\"\n\n\"No, Dorothea; it is my bounden duty. It is my work. It is that to\nwhich I am appointed as a minister. If you cannot see the difference\nI have much mistaken your character,--have much mistaken your\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that nobody but a clergyman is to know what's\nright and what's wrong? That must be nonsense, Mr. Prong. I'm sorry\nto say anything to grieve you,--\" Mr. Prong was now shaking his head\nagain, with his eyes most pertinaciously closed,--\"but there are some\nthings which really one can't bear.\"\n\nBut he only shook his head. His inward feelings were too many for\nhim, so that he could not at the present moment bring himself to give\na reply to the momentous proposition which his betrothed had made\nhim. Nor, indeed, had he at this moment fixed his mind as to the step\nwhich Duty and Wisdom combined would call upon him to take in this\nmatter. The temper of the lady was not certainly all that he had\ndesired. As an admiring member of his flock she had taken all his\nghostly counsels as infallible; but now it seemed to him as though\nmost of his words and many of his thoughts and actions were made\nsubject by her to a bitter criticism. But in this matter he was\ninclined to rely much upon his own strength. Should he marry the\nlady, as he was still minded to do for many reasons, he would be to\nher a loving, careful husband; but he would also be her lord and\nmaster,--as was intended when marriage was made a holy ordinance. In\nthis respect he did not doubt himself or his own powers. Hard words\nhe could bear, and, as he thought, after a time control. So thinking,\nhe was not disposed to allow the lady to recede from her troth to\nhim, simply because in her anger she expressed a wish to do so.\nTherefore he had wisely been silent, and had shaken his head in\nreproach. But unfortunately the terms of their compact had not been\nfinally settled with reference to another heading. Mrs. Prime had\npromised to be his wife, but she had burdened her promise with\ncertain pecuniary conditions which were distasteful to him,--which\nwere much opposed to that absolute headship and perfect mastery,\nwhich, as he thought, should belong to the husband as husband. His\nviews on this subject were very strong, and he was by no means\ninclined to abate one jot of his demand. Better remain single in\nhis work than accept the name of husband without its privileges!\nBut he had hoped that by mingled firmness and gentle words he might\nbring his Dorothea round to a more womanly way of thinking. He had\nflattered himself that there was a power of eloquence in him which\nwould have prevailed over her. Once or twice he thought that he was\non the brink of success. He knew well that there were many points in\nhis favour. A woman who has spoken of herself, and been spoken of,\nas being on the point of marriage, does not like to recede; and his\nDorothea, though not specially womanly among women, was still a\nwoman. Moreover he had the law on his side,--the old law as coming\nfrom the Scriptures. He could say that such a pecuniary arrangement\nas that proposed by his Dorothea was sinful. He had said so,--as he\nhad then thought not without effect; but now she retaliated upon him\nwith accusation of another sin! It was manifestly in her power to\nbreak away from him on that money detail. It seemed now to be her\nwish to break away from him; but she preferred doing so on that other\nmatter. He began to fear that he must lose his wife, seeing that he\nwas resolved never to yield on the money question; but he did not\nchoose to be entrapped into an instant resignation of his engagement\nby Dorothea's indignation on a point of abstruse Scripturo-political\nmorality. His Dorothea had assumed her indignation as a cloak for her\npecuniary obstinacy. It might be that he must yield; but he would not\nsurrender thus at the sound of a false summons. So he closed his eyes\nvery pertinaciously and shook his head.\n\n\"I think upon the whole,\" said she again, \"that we had better make up\nour minds to part.\" Then she stood up, feeling that she should thus\nemploy a greater power in forcing an answer from him. He must have\nseen her motion through some cranny of his pertinaciously closed\neyes, for he noticed it by rising from his own chair, with both his\nhands firmly fixed upon the table; but still he did not open his\neyes,--unless it might be to the extent of that small cranny.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Prong,\" said she.\n\nThen he altered the form of his hands, and taking them from the table\nhe dashed them together before his face. \"God bless you, Dorothea!\"\nsaid he. \"God bless you! God bless you!\" And he put out his hands as\nthough blessing her in his darkness. She, perceiving the inutility of\nendeavouring to shake hands with a man who wouldn't open his eyes,\nmoved away from her chair towards the door, purposely raising a sound\nof motion with her dress, so that he might know that she was going.\nIn that I think she took an unnecessary precaution, for the cranny at\nthe corner of his eye was still at his disposal.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Prong,\" she said again, as she opened the door for\nherself.\n\n\"God bless you, Dorothea!\" said he. \"May God bless you!\"\n\nThen, without assistance at the front door she made her way out\ninto the street, and as she stepped along the pavement, she\nformed a resolve,--which no eloquence from Mr. Prong could ever\novercome,--that she would remain a widow for the rest of her days.\n\nAt twelve o'clock on the morning of the election Mr. Hart was\ndeclared by his own committee to be nine ahead, and was admitted\nto be six ahead by Mr. Cornbury's committee. But the Cornbury folk\nasserted confidently that in this they saw certain signs of success.\nTheir supporters were not men who could be whipped up to the poll\nearly in the day, whereas Hart's voters were all, more or less, under\ncontrol, and had been driven up hurriedly to the hustings so as\nto make this early show of numbers. Mr. Hart was about everywhere\nspeaking, and so was Butler Cornbury; but in the matter of oratory I\nam bound to acknowledge that the Jew had by much the mastery over the\nChristian. There are a class of men,--or rather more than a class,\na section of mankind,--to whom a power of easy expression by means\nof spoken words comes naturally. English country gentlemen, highly\neducated as they are, undaunted as they usually are, self-confident\nas they in truth are at the bottom, are clearly not in this\nsection. Perhaps they are further removed from it, considering the\nadvantages they have for such speaking, than any other class of men\nin England,--or I might almost say elsewhere. The fact, for it is a\nfact, that some of the greatest orators whom the world has known have\nbeen found in this class, does not in any degree affect the truth of\nmy proposition. The best grapes in the world are perhaps grown in\nEngland, though England is not a land of grapes. And for the same\nreason. The value of the thing depends upon its rarity, and its value\ninstigates the efforts for excellence. The power of vocal expression\nwhich seems naturally to belong to an American is to an ordinary\nEnglishman very marvellous; but in America the talking man is but\nlittle esteemed. \"Very wonderful power of delivery,--that of Mr.\nSo-and-So,\" says the Englishman, speaking of an American.\n\n\"Guess we don't think much of that kind of thing here,\" says the\nYankee. \"There's a deal too much of that coin in circulation.\"\n\nEnglish country gentlemen are not to be classed among that section of\nmankind which speaks easily in public, but Jews, I think, may be so\nclassed. The men who speak thus easily and with natural fluency, are\nalso they who learn languages easily. They are men who observe rather\nthan think, who remember rather than create, who may not have great\nmental powers, but are ever ready with what they have, whose best\nword is at their command at a moment, and is then serviceable though\nperhaps incapable of more enduring service.\n\nAt any rate, as regarded oratory in Baslehurst the dark little man\nwith the bright new hat from London was very much stronger than\nhis opponent,--so much stronger that poor Butler Cornbury began\nto sicken of elections and to wish himself comfortably at home at\nCornbury Grange. He knew that he was talking himself down while\nthe Israelitish clothier was talking himself up. \"It don't matter,\"\nHonyman said to him comfortably. \"It's only done for the show of the\nthing and to fill up the day. If Gladstone were here he wouldn't talk\na vote out of them one way or the other;--nor yet the devil himself.\"\nThis consoled Butler Cornbury, but nevertheless he longed that the\nday might be over.\n\nAnd Tappitt spoke too more than once,--as did also Luke Rowan, in\nspite of various noisy interruptions in which he was told that he was\nnot an elector, and in spite also of an early greeting with a dead\ncat. Tappitt, in advocating the claims of Mr. Hart to be returned to\nParliament as member for Baslehurst, was clever enough to introduce\nthe subject of his own wrongs. And so important had this brewery\nquestion become that he was listened to with every sign of interest\nwhen he told the people for how many years Bungall and Tappitt had\nbrewed beer for them, there in Baslehurst. Doubtless he was met by\nsundry interruptions from the Rowanites.\n\n\"What sort of tipple has it been, T.?\" was demanded by one voice.\n\n\"Do you call that beer?\" said a second.\n\n\"Where do you buy your hops?\" asked a third.\n\nBut he went on manfully, and was buoyed up by a strong belief that he\nwas fighting his own battle with success.\n\nNor was Rowan slow to answer him. He was proud to say that he was\nBungall's heir, and as such he intended to continue Bungall's\nbusiness. Whether he could improve the quality of the old tap he\ndidn't know, but he would try. People had said a few weeks ago that\nhe had been hounded out of Baslehurst, and did not mean to come back\nagain. Here he was. He had bought property in Baslehurst. He meant\nto live in Baslehurst. He pledged himself to brew beer in Baslehurst.\nHe already regarded himself as belonging to Baslehurst. And, being\na bachelor, he hoped that he might live to marry a wife out of\nBaslehurst. This last assurance was received with unqualified\napplause from both factions, and went far in obtaining for Rowan that\nlocal popularity which was needful to him. Certainly the Rowan\ncontest added much to the popular interest of that election.\n\nAt the close of the poll on that evening it was declared by the mayor\nthat Mr. Butler Cornbury had been elected to serve the borough in\nParliament by a majority of one vote.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE BASLEHURST GAZETTE.\n\n\nBy one vote! Old Mr. Cornbury when he heard of it gasped with dismay,\nand in secret regretted that his son had not been beaten. What seat\ncould be gained by one vote and not be contested, especially when\nthe beaten candidate was a Jew clothier rolling in money? And what\nsums would not a petition and scrutiny cost? Butler Cornbury himself\nwas dismayed, and could hardly participate in the exultation of his\nmore enthusiastic wife. Mr. Hart of course declared that he would\npetition, and that he was as sure of the seat as though he already\noccupied it. But as it was known that every possible electioneering\ndevice had been put in practice on his behalf during the last two\nhours of the poll, the world at large in Baslehurst believed that\nyoung Cornbury's position was secure. Tappitt and some few others\nwere of a different opinion. At the present moment Tappitt could not\nendure to acknowledge to himself that he had been beaten. Nothing but\nthe prestige and inward support of immediate success could support\nhim in that contest, so much more important to himself, in which he\nwas now about to be engaged. That matter of the petition, however,\ncan hardly be brought into the present story. The political world\nwill understand that it would be carried on with great vigour.\n\nThe news of the election of Butler Cornbury reached the cottage\nat Bragg's End by the voice of Mr. Sturt on the same evening; and\nMrs. Ray, in her quiet way, expressed much joy that Mr. Comfort's\nson-in-law should have been successful, and that Baslehurst should\nnot have disgraced itself by any connexion with a Jew. To her it had\nappeared monstrous that such a one should have been even permitted to\nshow himself in the town as a candidate for its representation. To\nsuch she would have denied all civil rights, and almost all social\nrights. For a true spirit of persecution one should always go to a\nwoman; and the milder, the sweeter, the more loving, the more womanly\nthe woman, the stronger will be that spirit within her. Strong love\nfor the thing loved necessitates strong hatred for the thing hated,\nand thence comes the spirit of persecution. They in England who are\nnow keenest against the Jews, who would again take from them rights\nthat they have lately won, are certainly those who think most of the\nfaith of a Christian. The most deadly enemies of the Roman Catholics\nare they who love best their religion as Protestants. When we look to\nindividuals we always find it so, though it hardly suits us to admit\nas much when we discuss these subjects broadly. To Mrs. Ray it was\nwonderful that a Jew should have been entertained in Baslehurst as a\nfuture member for the borough, and that he should have been admitted\nto speak aloud within a few yards of the church tower!\n\nOn the day but one after the election Mrs. Sturt brought over to\nthe cottage an extra sheet of the \"Baslehurst Gazette,\" which had\nbeen published out of its course, and which was devoted to the\ncircumstances of the election. I am not sure that Mrs. Sturt would\nhave regarded this somewhat dull report of the election speeches as\nhaving any peculiar interest for Mrs. Ray and her daughter had it not\nbeen for one special passage. Luke Rowan's speech about Baslehurst\nwas given at length, and in it was contained that public promise\nas to his matrimonial intentions. Mrs. Sturt came into the cottage\nparlour with the paper doubled into four, and with her finger on\na particular spot. To her it had seemed that Rowan's promise must\nhave been intended for Rachel, and it seemed also that nothing could\nbe more manly, straightforward, or gallant than that assurance. It\nsuited her idea of chivalry. But she was not quite sure that Rachel\nwould enjoy the publicity of the declaration, and therefore she was\nprepared to point the passage out more particularly to Mrs. Ray.\n\"I've brought 'ee the account of it all,\" said she, still holding the\npaper in her hand. \"The gudeman,--he's done with t' paper, and you'll\nkeep it for good and all. One young man that we know of has made t'\nfinest speech of 'em all to my mind. Luik at that, Mrs. Ray.\" Then,\nwith a knowing wink at the mother, and a poke at the special words\nwith her finger, she left the sheet in Mrs. Ray's hand, and went her\nway.\n\nMrs. Ray, who had not quite understood the pantomime, and whose eye\nhad not caught the words relating to marriage, saw however that the\ncolumn indicated contained the report of a speech made by Luke Rowan,\nand she began it at the beginning and read it throughout. Luke had\nidentified himself with the paper, and therefore received from it\nalmost more than justice. His words were given at very full length,\nand for some ten minutes she was reading before she came to the words\nwhich Mrs. Sturt had hoped would be so delightful.\n\n\"What is it, mamma?\" Rachel asked.\n\n\"A speech, my dear, made at the election.\"\n\n\"And who made it, mamma?\"\n\nMrs. Ray hesitated for a moment before she answered, thereby letting\nRachel know full well who made the speech before the word was spoken.\nBut at last she did speak the word--\"Mr. Rowan, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Rachel; she longed to get hold of the newspaper, but she\nwould utter no word expressive of such longing. Since that evening on\nwhich she had been bidden to look at the clouds she had regarded Luke\nas a special hero, cleverer than other men around her, as a man born\nto achieve things and make himself known. It was not astonishing\nto her that a speech of his should be reported at length in the\nnewspaper. He was a man certain to rise, to make speeches, and to be\nreported. So she thought of him; and so thinking had almost wished\nthat it were not so. Could she expect that such a one would stoop\nto her? or that if he did so that she could be fit for him? He had\nnow perceived that himself, and therefore had taken her at her word,\nand had left her. Had he been more like other men around her;--more\nhomely, less prone to rise, with less about him of fire and genius,\nshe might have won him and kept him. The prize would not have been\nso precious; but still, she thought, it might have been sufficient\nfor her heart. A young man who could find printers and publishers to\nreport his words in that way, on the first moment of his coming among\nthem, would he turn aside from his path to look after her? Would he\nnot bring with him some grand lady down from London as his wife?\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mrs. Ray, quite startled. \"Oh, dear! What do you\nthink he says?\"\n\n\"What does he say, mamma?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. Perhaps he mayn't mean it. I don't think I ought\nto have spoken of it.\"\n\n\"If it's in the newspaper I suppose I should have heard of it, unless\nyou sent it back without letting me see it.\"\n\n\"She said we were to keep it, and it's because of that, I'm sure. She\nwas always the most good-natured woman in the world. I don't know\nwhat we should have done if we hadn't found such a neighbour as Mrs.\nSturt.\"\n\n\"But what is it, mamma, that you are speaking of in the newspapers?\"\n\n\"Mr. Rowan says--Oh, dear! I wish I'd let you come to it yourself.\nHow very odd that he should get up and say that kind of thing in\npublic before all the people. He says;--but any way I know he means\nit because he's so honest. And after all if he means it, it doesn't\nmuch matter where he says it. Handsome is that handsome does. There,\nmy dear; I don't know how to tell it you, so you had better read it\nyourself.\"\n\nRachel with eager hands took the paper, and began the speech as her\nmother had done, and read it through. She read it through till she\ncame to those words, and then she put the paper down beside her. \"I\nunderstand what you mean, mamma, and what Mrs. Sturt meant; but Mr.\nRowan did not mean that.\"\n\n\"What did he mean, my dear?\"\n\n\"He meant them to understand that he intended to become a man of\nBaslehurst like one of themselves.\"\n\n\"But then why did he talk about finding a wife there?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have said that, mamma, if he had meant anything\nparticular. If anything of that sort had been at all in his mind, it\nwould have kept him from saying what he did say.\"\n\n\"But didn't he mean that he intended to marry a Baslehurst lady?\"\n\n\"He meant it in that sort of way in which men do mean such things. It\nwas his way to make them think well of him. But don't let us talk any\nmore about it, mamma. It isn't nice.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I can't understand it,\" said Mrs. Ray. But she became\nsilent on the subject, and the reading of the newspaper was passed\nover to Rachel.\n\nThis had not been completed when a step was heard on the gravel walk\noutside, and Mrs. Ray, jumping up, declared it to be the step of\nher eldest daughter. It was so, and Mrs. Prime was very soon in the\nroom. It was at this time about four o'clock in the afternoon, and\ntherefore, as the hour for tea at the cottage was half-past five, it\nwas naturally understood that Mrs. Prime had come there to join them\nat their evening meal. After their first greeting she had seated\nherself on the sofa, and there was that in her manner which showed\nboth to her mother and sister that she was somewhat confused,--that\nshe had something to say as to which there was some hesitation. \"Do\ntake off your bonnet, Dorothea,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Will you come up-stairs, Dolly,\" said her sister, \"and put your hair\nstraight after your walk?\"\n\nBut Dolly did not care whether her hair was straight or tossed, as\nthe Irish girls say when the smoothness of their locks has been\ndisarranged. She took off her bonnet, however, and laid it on the\nsofa beside her. \"Mother,\" she said, \"I've got something particular\nthat I want to say to you.\"\n\n\"I hope it's not anything serious the matter,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Well, mother, it is serious. Things are serious mostly, I think,--or\nshould be.\"\n\n\"Shall I go into the garden while you are speaking to mamma?\" said\nRachel.\n\n\"No, Rachel; not on my account. What I've got to say should be said\nto you as well as to mother. It's all over between me and Mr. Prong.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"I thought it would be,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"And why did you think so?\" said Mrs. Prime, turning round upon her\nsister, almost angrily.\n\n\"I felt that he wouldn't suit you, Dolly; that's why I thought so. If\nit's all over now, I suppose there's no harm in saying that I didn't\nlike him well enough to hope he'd be my brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"But that couldn't make you think it. However, it's all over between\nus. We agreed that it should be so this morning; and I thought it\nright to come out and let you know at once.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you've told us,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Was there any quarrel?\" asked Rachel.\n\n\"No, Rachel, there was no quarrel; not what you call a quarrel,\nI suppose. We found there were subjects of disagreement between\nus,--matters on which we had adverse opinions; and therefore it was\nbetter that we should part.\"\n\n\"It was about the money, perhaps?\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Well, yes; it was in part about the money. Had I known then as much\nas I do now about the law in such matters, I should have told Mr.\nProng from the first that it could not be. He is a good man, and I\nhope I have not disturbed his happiness.\"\n\n\"I used to be afraid that he would disturb yours,\" said Rachel, \"and\ntherefore I cannot pretend to regret it.\"\n\n\"That's not charitable, Rachel. But if you please we won't say\nanything more about it. It's over, and that is enough. And now,\nmother, I want to know if you will object to my returning here and\nliving at the cottage again.\"\n\nMrs. Ray could not bethink herself at the moment what answer she\nmight best make, and therefore for some moments she made none. For\nherself she would have been delighted that her eldest daughter should\nreturn to the cottage. Under no circumstances could she refuse her\nown child a home under her own roof. But at the present moment she\ncould not forget the circumstances under which Mrs. Prime had gone,\nand it militated sorely against Mrs. Ray's sense of justice that the\nreturn should be made to depend on other circumstances. Mrs. Prime\nhad gone away in loud disapproval of Rachel's conduct; and now she\nproposed to return, on this breaking up of her own matrimonial\narrangements, as though she had left the cottage because of her\nproposed marriage. Mrs. Prime should be welcomed back, but her return\nshould be accompanied by a withdrawal of her accusation against\nRachel. Mrs. Ray did not know how to put her demand into words, but\nher mind was clear on the subject.\n\n\"Well, mother,\" said Mrs. Prime; \"is there any objection?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; no objection at all: of course not. I shall be\ndelighted to have you back, and so, I'm sure, will Rachel; but--\"\n\n\"But what? Is it about money?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! Nothing about money at all. If you do come back,--and\nI'm sure I hope you will; and indeed it seems quite unnatural that\nyou should be staying in Baslehurst, while we are living here. But\nI think you ought to say, my dear, that Rachel behaved just as she\nought to behave in all that matter about,--about Mr. Rowan, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Don't mind me, mamma,\" said Rachel,--who could, however, have\nsmothered her mother with kisses, on hearing these words.\n\n\"But I think we all ought to understand each other, Rachel. You and\nyour sister can't go on comfortably together, if there's to be more\nblack looks about that.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there have been any black looks,\" said Mrs. Prime,\nlooking very black as she spoke.\n\n\"At any rate we should understand each other,\" continued Mrs. Ray,\nwith admirable courage. \"I've thought a great deal about it since\nyou've been away. Indeed I haven't thought about much else. And I\ndon't think I shall ever forgive myself for having let a hard word be\nsaid to Rachel about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, don't,--don't,\" said Rachel. But those meditated embraces\nwere continued in her imagination.\n\n\"I don't want to say any hard words,\" said Mrs. Prime.\n\n\"No; I'm sure you don't;--only they were said,--weren't they, now?\nDidn't we blame her about being out there in the churchyard that\nevening?\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" exclaimed Rachel.\n\n\"Well, my dear, I won't say any more;--only this. Your sister went\naway because she thought you weren't good enough for her to live\nwith; and if she comes back again,--which I'm sure I hope she\nwill,--I think she ought to say that she's been mistaken.\"\n\nMrs. Prime looked very black, and no word fell from her. She sat\nthere silent and gloomy, while Mrs. Ray looked at the fireplace, lost\nin wonder at her own effort. Whether she would have given way or not,\nhad she and Mrs. Prime been alone, I cannot say. That Mrs. Prime\nwould have uttered no outspoken recantation I feel sure. It was\nRachel at last who settled the matter.\n\n\"If Dolly comes back to live here, mamma,\" said she, \"I shall take\nthat as an acknowledgment on her part that she thinks I am good\nenough to live with.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ray, \"perhaps that'll do; only there\nshould be an understanding, you know.\"\n\nMrs. Prime at the moment said nothing; but when next she spoke her\nwords showed her intention of having her things brought back to the\ncottage on the next day. I think it must be felt that Rachel had\nwon the victory. She felt it so herself, and was conscious that no\nfurther attempt would be made to carry her off to Dorcas meetings\nagainst her own will.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nCORNBURY GRANGE.\n\n\nLuke Rowan had been told that Mrs. Butler Cornbury wished to see him\nwhen the election should be over; and on the evening of the election\nthe victorious candidate, before he returned home, asked Luke to\ncome to the Grange on the following Monday and stay till the next\nWednesday. Now it must be understood that Rowan during this period\nof the election had become, in a public way, very intimate with\nCornbury. They were both young men, the new Member of Parliament\nnot being over thirty, and for the time they were together employed\non the same matter. Luke Rowan was one with whom such a man as\nMr. Cornbury could not zealously co-operate without reaching a\nconsiderable extent of personal intimacy. He was pleasant-mannered,\nfree in speech, with a bold eye, assuming though not asserting his\nequality with the best of those with whom he might be brought in\ncontact. Had Cornbury chosen to consider himself by reason of his\nsocial station too high for Rowan's fellowship, he might of course\nhave avoided him; but he could not have put himself into close\ncontact with the man, without submitting himself to that temporary\nequality which Rowan assumed, and to that temporary familiarity which\nsprung from it. Butler Cornbury had thought little about it. He had\nfound Rowan to be a pleasant associate and an able assistant, and had\nfallen into that mode of fellowship which the other man's ways and\nwords had made natural to him. When his wife begged him to ask Rowan\nup to the Grange, he had been startled for a moment, but had at once\nassented.\n\n\"Well,\" said he; \"he's an uncommon pleasant fellow. I don't see why\nhe shouldn't come.\"\n\n\"I've a particular reason,\" said Mrs. Butler.\n\n\"All right,\" said the husband. \"Do you explain it to my father.\" And\nso the invitation had been given.\n\nBut Rowan was a man more thoughtful than Cornbury, and was specially\nthoughtful as to his own position. He was a radical at heart if\never there was a radical. But in saying this I must beg my reader\nto understand that a radical is not necessarily a revolutionist\nor even a republican. He does not, by reason of his social or\npolitical radicalism, desire the ruin of thrones, the degradation\nof nobles, the spoliation of the rich, or even the downfall of the\nbench of bishops. Many a young man is frightened away from the just\nconclusions of his mind and the strong convictions of his heart by\ndread of being classed with those who are jealous of the favoured\nones of fortune. A radical may be as ready as any aristocrat to\nsupport the crown with his blood, and the church with his faith. It\nis in this that he is a radical; that he desires, expects, works for,\nand believes in, the gradual progress of the people. No doctrine of\nequality is his. Liberty he must have, and such position, high or\nlow, for himself and others, as each man's individual merits will\nachieve for him. The doctrine of outward equality he eschews as a\nbarrier to all ambition, and to all improvement. The idea is as mean\nas the thing is impracticable. But within,--is it in his soul or in\nhis heart?--within his breast there is a manhood that will own no\ninferiority to the manhood of another. He retires to a corner that\nan earl with his suite may pass proudly through the doorway, and he\ngrudges the earl nothing of his pride. It is the earl's right. But\nhe also has his right; and neither queen, nor earl, nor people shall\ninvade it. That is the creed of a radical.\n\nRowan, as I have said, was a man thoughtful as to his own position.\nHe had understood well the nature of the league between himself\nand Butler Cornbury. It was his intention to become a brewer in\nBaslehurst; and a brewer in Baslehurst would by no means be as the\nmighty brewers of great name, who marry lord's daughters, and give\ntheir daughters in marriage to mighty lords. He would simply be a\ntradesman in the town. It might well be that he should not find the\nsociety of the Tappitts and the Griggses much to his taste, but such\nas it was he would make the best of it. At any rate he would make no\nattempt to force his way into other society. If others came to him\nlet that be their look out. Now, when Cornbury asked him thus to come\nto Cornbury Grange, as though they two were men living in the same\nclass of life,--as though they were men who might be bound together\nsocially in their homes as well as politically on the hustings, the\nred colour came to his face and he hesitated for a moment in his\nanswer.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh! you must come,\" said Cornbury. \"My wife particularly desires\nit.\"\n\n\"She is very kind,\" said he. \"But if you ask all your supporters over\nto the Grange you'll get rather a mixed lot.\"\n\n\"I suppose I should; but I don't mean to do that. I shall be very\nglad, however, to see you;--very glad.\"\n\n\"And I shall be very happy to come,\" said Rowan, having again\nhesitated as he gave his answer.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't promised that I'd go there,\" he said to himself\nafterwards. This was on the Sunday, after evening church,--an hour\nor more after the people had all gone home, and he was sitting on\nthat stile, looking to the west, and thinking, as he looked, of that\nsunset which he and another had seen as they stood there together.\nHe did wish that he had not undertaken to go to Mr. Cornbury's house.\nWhat to him would be the society of such people as he should find\nthere,--to him who had laid out for himself a career that would\nnecessarily place his life among other associates? \"I'll send and\nexcuse myself,\" he said. \"I'll be called away to Exeter. I have\nthings to do there. I shall only get into a mess by knowing people\nwho will drop me when this ferment of the election is over.\" And yet\nthe idea of an intimacy at such a house as Cornbury Grange,--with\nsuch people as Mrs. Butler Cornbury, was very sweet to him; only\nthis, that if he associated with them or such as them it must be on\nequal terms. He could acknowledge them to be people apart from him,\nas ice creams and sponge cakes are things apart from the shillingless\nschoolboy. But as the schoolboy, if brought within the range of cakes\nand creams, must devour them with unchecked relish, as though his\npocket were lined with coin; so must he, Rowan, carry himself with\nthese curled darlings of society if he found himself placed among\nthem. He liked cakes and creams, but had made up his mind that other\nviands were as wholesome and more comfortably within his reach. Was\nit worth his while to go to this banquet which would unsettle his\ntaste, and at which perhaps if he sat there at his ease, he might not\nbe wholly welcome? All his thoughts were not noble. He had declared\nto himself that a certain thing could not be his except at a cost\nwhich he would not pay, and yet he hankered for that thing. He had\ndeclared to himself that no social position in which he might ever\nfind himself should make a change in him, on his inner self or on\nhis outward manner; and now he feared to go among these people, lest\nhe should find himself an inferior among superiors. It was not all\nnoble; but there was beneath it a basis of nobility. \"I will go,\" he\nsaid at last, fearing that if he did not, there would have been some\ngrain of cowardice in the motives of his action. \"If they don't like\nme it's their fault for asking me.\"\n\nOf course as he sat there he was thinking of Rachel. Of course he had\nthought of Rachel daily, almost hourly, since he had been with her\nat the cottage, when she had bent her head over his shoulder, and\nsubmitted to have his arm round her waist. But his thoughts of her\nwere not as hers of him. Nor is it often that a man's love is like\na woman's,--restless, fearful, uncomfortable, sleepless, timid, and\nall-pervading. Not the less may it be passionate, constant, and\nfaithful. He had been angered by Rachel's letter to him,--greatly\nangered. Of a truth when Mrs. Ray met him in Exeter he had no\nmessage to send back to Cawston. He had done his part, and had been\nrejected;--had been rejected too clearly because on the summing up of\nhis merits and demerits at the cottage, his demerits had been found\nto be the heavier. He did not suspect that the calculation had been\nmade by Rachel herself; and therefore he had never said to himself\nthat all should be over between them. He had never determined that\nthere should be a quarrel between them. But he was angered, and he\nwould stand aloof from her. He would stand aloof from her, and would\nno longer acknowledge that he was in any way bound by the words he\nhad spoken. All such bonds she had broken. Nevertheless I think he\nloved her with a surer love after receiving that letter than he had\never felt before.\n\nHe had been here, at this spot, every evening since his return\nto Baslehurst; and here had thought much of his future life, and\nsomething, too, of the days that were past. Looking to the left he\ncould see the trees that stood in front of the old brewery, hiding\nthe building from his eyes. That was the house in which old Bungall\nhad lived, and there Tappitt had lived for the last twenty years.\n\"I suppose,\" said he, speaking to himself, \"it will be my destiny to\nlive there too, with the vats and beer barrels under my nose. But\nwhat farmer ever throve who disliked the muck of his own farm-yard?\"\nThen he had thought of Tappitt and of the coming battle, and had\nlaughed as he remembered the scene with the poker. At that moment\nhis eye caught the bright colours of women's bonnets coming into the\nfield beneath him, and he knew that the Tappitt girls were returning\nhome from their walk. He had retired quickly round the chancel of the\nchurch, and had watched, thinking that Rachel would be with them. But\nRachel, of course, was not there. He said to himself that they had\nthrown her off; and said also that the time should come when they\nshould be glad to win from her a kind word and an encouraging smile.\nHis love for Rachel was as true and more strong than ever; but it was\nof that nature that he was able to tell himself that it had for the\npresent moment been set aside by her act, and that it became him to\nleave it for a while in abeyance.\n\n\"What on earth shall I do with myself all Tuesday?\" he said again as\nhe walked away from the churchyard on the Sunday evening. \"I don't\nknow what these people do with themselves when there's no hunting\nand shooting. It seems unnatural to me that a man shouldn't have his\nbread to earn,--or a woman either in some form.\" After that he went\nback to his inn.\n\nOn the Monday he went out to Cornbury Grange late in the afternoon.\nButler Cornbury drove into Baslehurst with a pair of horses, and took\nhim back in his phaeton.\n\n\"Give my fellow your portmanteau. That's all right. You never were\nat the Grange, were you? It's the prettiest five miles of a drive in\nDevonshire; but the walk along the river is the prettiest walk in\nEngland,--which is saying a great deal more.\"\n\n\"I know the walk well,\" said Rowan, \"though I never was inside the\npark.\"\n\n\"It isn't much of a park. Indeed there isn't a semblance of a park\nabout it. Grange is just the name for it, as it's an upper-class sort\nof homestead for a gentleman farmer. We've lived there since long\nbefore Adam, but we've never made much of a house of it.\"\n\n\"That's just the sort of place that I should like to have myself.\"\n\n\"If you had it you wouldn't be content. You'd want to pull down\nthe house and build a bigger one. It's what I shall do some day, I\nsuppose. But if I do it will never be so pretty again. I suppose that\nfellow will petition; won't he?\"\n\n\"I should say he would;--though he won't get anything by it.\"\n\n\"He knows his purse is longer than ours, and he'll think to frighten\nus;--and, by George, he will frighten us too! My father is not a rich\nman by any means.\"\n\n\"You should stand to your guns now.\"\n\n\"I mean to do so, if I can. My wife's father is made of money.\"\n\n\"What! Mr. Comfort?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's been blessed with the most surprising number of unmarried\nuncles and aunts that ever a man had. He's rather fond of me, and\nlikes the idea of my being in Parliament. I think I shall hint to him\nthat he must pay for the idea. Here we are. Will you come and take a\nturn round the place before dinner?\"\n\nRowan was then taken into the house and introduced to the old squire,\nwho received him with the stiff urbanity of former days.\n\n\"You are welcome to the Grange, Mr. Rowan. You'll find us very quiet\nhere; which is more, I believe, than can have been said of Baslehurst\nthese last two or three days. My daughter-in-law is somewhere with\nthe children. She'll be here before dinner. Butler, has that tailor\nfellow gone back to London yet?\"\n\nButler told his father that the tailor had at least gone away from\nBaslehurst; and then the two younger men went out and walked about\nthe grounds till dinner time.\n\nIt was Mrs. Butler Cornbury who gave soul and spirit to daily\nlife at Cornbury Grange,--who found the salt with which the bread\nwas quickened, and the wine with which the heart was made glad.\nMarvellous is the power which can be exercised, almost unconsciously,\nover a company, or an individual, or even upon a crowd by one person\ngifted with good temper, good digestion, good intellects, and good\nlooks. A woman so endowed charms not only by the exercise of her own\ngifts, but she endows those who are near her with a sudden conviction\nthat it is they whose temper, health, talents, and appearance is\ndoing so much for society. Mrs. Butler Cornbury was such a woman as\nthis. The Grange was a popular house. The old squire was not found to\nbe very dull. The young squire was thought to be rather clever. The\nair of the house was lively and bracing. Men and women did not find\nthe days there to be over long. And Mrs. Butler Cornbury did it all.\n\nRowan did not see her till he met her in the drawing-room, just\nbefore dinner, when he found that two or three other ladies were\nalso staying there. She came up to him when he entered the room, and\ngreeted him as though he were an old friend. All conversation at that\nmoment of course had reference to the election. Thanks were given and\ncongratulations received; and when old Mr. Cornbury shook his head,\nhis daughter-in-law assured him that there would be nothing to fear.\n\n\"I don't know what you call nothing to fear, my dear. I call two\nthousand pounds a great deal to fear.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if we don't hear another word about him,\" said\nshe.\n\nThe old man uttered a long sigh. \"It seems to me,\" said he, \"that no\ngentleman ought to stand for a seat in Parliament since these people\nhave been allowed to come up. Purity of election, indeed! It makes me\nsick. Come along, my dear.\" Then he gave his arm to one of the young\nladies, and toddled into the dining-room.\n\nMrs. Butler Cornbury said nothing special to Luke Rowan on that\nevening, but she made the hours very pleasant to him. All those\nhalf-morbid ideas as to social difference between himself and his\nhost's family soon vanished. The house was very comfortable, the\ngirls were very pretty, Mrs. Cornbury was very kind, and everything\nwent very well. On the following morning it was nearly ten when they\nsat down to breakfast, and half the morning before lunch had passed\naway in idle chat before the party bethought itself of what it should\ndo for the day. At last it was agreed that they would all stroll out\nthrough the woods up to a special reach of the river which there ran\nthrough a ravine of rock, called Cornbury Cleeves. Many in those\nparts declared that Cornbury Cleeves was the prettiest spot in\nEngland. I am not prepared to bear my testimony to the truth of that\nvery wide assertion. I can only say that I know no prettier spot. The\nriver here was rapid and sparkling; not rapid because driven into\nsmall compass, for its breadth was greater and more regular in its\npassage through the Cleeves than it was either above or below, but\nrapid from the declivity of its course. On one side the rocks came\nsheer down to the water, but on the other there was a strip of\nmeadow, or rather a grassy amphitheatre, for the wall of rocks at the\nback of it was semi-circular, so as to enclose the field on every\nside. There might be four or five acres of green meadow here; but\nthe whole was so interspersed with old stunted oak trees and thorns\nstanding alone that the space looked larger than it was. The rocks\non each side were covered here and there with the richest foliage;\nand the spot might be taken to be a valley from which, as from that\nof Rasselas, there was no escape. Down close upon the margin of the\nwater a bathing-house had been built, from which a plunge could be\ntaken into six or seven feet of the coolest, darkest, cleanest water\nthat a bather could desire in his heart.\n\n\"I suppose you never were here before,\" said Mrs. Cornbury to Rowan.\n\n\"Indeed I have,\" said he. \"I always think it such a grand thing that\nyou landed magnates can't keep all your delights to yourself. I\ndare say I've been here oftener than you have during the last three\nmonths.\"\n\n\"That's very likely, seeing that it's my first visit this summer.\"\n\n\"And I've been here a dozen times. I suppose you'll think I'm a\nvillanous trespasser when I tell you that I've bathed in that very\nhouse more than once.\"\n\n\"Then you've done more than I ever did; and yet we had it made\nthinking it would do for ladies. But the water looks so black.\"\n\n\"Ah! I like that, as long as it's a clear black.\"\n\n\"I like bathing where I can see the bright stones like jewels at\nthe bottom. You can never do that in fresh water. It's only in some\nnook of the sea, where there is no sand, when the wind outside has\ndied away, and when the tide is quiet and at its full. Then one can\ndrop gently in and almost fancy that one belongs to the sea as the\nmermaids do. I wonder how the idea of mermaids first came?\"\n\n\"Some one saw a crowd of young women bathing.\"\n\n\"But then how came they to have looking-glasses and fishes' tails?\"\n\n\"The fishes' tails were taken as granted because they were in the\nsea, and the looking-glasses because they were women,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"And the one with as much reason as the other. By-the-by, Mr. Rowan,\ntalking of women, and fishes' tails, and looking-glasses, and all\nother feminine attractions, when did you see Miss Ray last?\"\n\nRowan paused before he answered her, and looking round perceived that\nhe had strayed with Mrs. Cornbury to the furthest end of the meadow,\naway from their companions. It immediately came across his mind that\nthis was the matter on which Mrs. Cornbury wished to speak to him,\nand by some combative process he almost resolved that he would not be\nspoken to on that matter.\n\n\"When did I see Miss Ray?\" said he, repeating her question. \"Two or\nthree days after Mrs. Tappitt's party. I have not seen her since\nthat.\"\n\n\"And why don't you go and see her?\" said Mrs. Cornbury.\n\nNow this was asked him in a tone which made it necessary that he\nshould either answer her question or tell her simply that he would\nnot answer it. The questioner's manner was so firm, so eager, so\nincisive, that the question could not be turned away.\n\n\"I am not sure that I am prepared to tell you,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah! but I want you to be prepared,\" said she; \"or rather, perhaps,\nto tell the truth, I want to drive you to an answer without\npreparation. Is it not true that you made her an offer, and that she\naccepted it?\"\n\nRowan thought a moment, and then he answered her, \"It is true.\"\n\n\"I should not have asked the question if I had not positively known\nthat such was the case. I have never spoken a word to her about it,\nand yet I knew it. Her mother told my father.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And as that is so, why do you not go and see her? I am sure you are\nnot one of those who would play such a trick as that upon such a girl\nwith the mere purpose of amusing yourself.\"\n\n\"Upon no girl would I do so, Mrs. Cornbury.\"\n\n\"I feel sure of it. Therefore why do you not go to her?\" They walked\nalong together for a few minutes under the rocks in silence, and then\nMrs. Cornbury again repeated her question, \"Why do you not go to\nher?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cornbury,\" he said, \"you must not be angry with me if I say\nthat that is a matter which at the present moment I am not willing to\ndiscuss.\"\n\n\"Nor must you be angry with me if, as Rachel's friend, I say\nsomething further about it. As you do not wish to answer me, I will\nask no other question; but at any rate you will be willing to listen\nto me. Rachel has never spoken to me on this subject--not a word; but\nI know from others who see her daily that she is very unhappy.\"\n\n\"I am grieved that it should be so.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew you would be grieved. But how could it be otherwise? A\ngirl, you know, Mr. Rowan, has not other things to occupy her mind as\na man has. I think of Rachel Ray that she would have been as happy\nthere at Bragg's End as the day is long, if no offer of love had\ncome in her way. She was not a girl whose head had been filled with\nromance, and who looked for such things. But for that very reason is\nshe less able to bear the loss of it when the offer has come in her\nway. I think, perhaps, you hardly know the depth of her character and\nthe strength of her love.\"\n\n\"I think I know that she is constant.\"\n\n\"Then why do you try her so hardly?\"\n\nMrs. Cornbury had promised that she would ask no more questions; but\nthe asking of questions was her easiest mode of saying that which she\nhad to say. And Rowan, though he had declared that he would answer no\nquestion, could hardly avoid the necessity of doing so.\n\n\"It may be that the trial is the other way.\"\n\n\"I know;--I understand. They made her write a letter to you. It\nwas my father's doing. I will tell you the whole truth. It was my\nfather's doing, and therefore it is that I think myself bound to\nspeak to you. Her mother came to him for advice, and he had heard\nevil things spoken of you in Baslehurst. You will see that I am very\nfrank with you. And I will take some credit to myself too. I believed\nsuch tidings to be altogether false, and I made inquiry which proved\nthat I was right. But my father had given the advice which he thought\nbest. I do not know what Rachel wrote to you, but a girl's letter\nunder such circumstances can hardly do more than express the will of\nthose who guide her. It was sad enough for her to be forced to write\nsuch a letter, but it will be sadder still if you cannot be brought\nto forgive it.\"\n\nThen she paused, standing under the gray rock and looking up eagerly\ninto his face. But he made her no answer, nor gave her any sign. His\nheart was very tender at that moment towards Rachel, but there was\nthat in him of the stubbornness of manhood which would not let him\nmake any sign of his tenderness.\n\n\"I will not press you to say anything, Mr. Rowan,\" she continued,\n\"and I am much obliged to you for having listened to me. I've known\nRachel Ray for many years, and that must be my excuse.\"\n\n\"No excuse is wanting,\" he said. \"If I do not say anything it is not\nbecause I am offended. There are things on which a man should not\nallow himself to speak without considering them.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. Come; shall we go back to them at the bathing-house?\nThey'll think we've lost ourselves.\"\n\nThus Mrs. Cornbury said the words which she had desired to speak on\nRachel Ray's behalf.\n\nWhen they reached the Grange there were still two hours left before\nthe time of dressing for dinner should come, and during these hours\nLuke returned by himself to the Cleeves. He escaped from his host,\nand retraced his steps, and on reaching the river sat himself down on\nthe margin, and looked into the cool dark running water. Had he been\nsevere to Rachel? He would answer no such question when asked by Mrs.\nCornbury, but he was very desirous of answering it to himself. The\nwomen at the cottage had doubted him,--Mrs. Ray and her daughter,\nwith perhaps that other daughter of whom he had only heard; and he\nhad resolved that they should see him no more and hear of him no more\ntill there should be no further room for doubt. Then he would show\nhimself again at the cottage, and again ask Rachel to be his wife.\nThere was some manliness in this; but there was also a hardness in\nhis pride which deserved the rebuke which Mrs. Cornbury's words had\nconveyed to him. He had been severe to Rachel. Lying there, with his\nfull length stretched upon the grass, he acknowledged to himself\nthat he had thought more of his own feelings than of hers. While Mrs.\nCornbury had been speaking he could not bring himself to feel that\nthis was the case. But now in his solitude he did acknowledge it.\nWhat amount of sin had she committed against him that she should be\nso punished by him who loved her? He took out her letter from his\npocket, and found that her words were loving, though she had not been\nallowed to put into them that eager, pressing, speaking love which he\nhad desired.\n\n\"Spoken ill of me, have they?\" said he to himself, as he got up to\nwalk back to the Grange. \"Well, that was natural too. What an ass a\nman is to care for such things as that!\"\n\nOn that evening and the next morning the Cornburys were very gracious\nto him; and then he returned to Baslehurst, on the whole well pleased\nwith his visit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nIN WHICH THE QUESTION OF THE BREWERY IS SETTLED.\n\n\nDuring the day or two immediately subsequent to the election, Mr.\nTappitt found himself to be rather downhearted. The excitement of the\ncontest was over. He was no longer buoyed up by the consoling and\nalmost triumphant assurances of success for himself against his enemy\nRowan, which had been administered to him by those with whom he had\nbeen acting on behalf of Mr. Hart. He was alone and thoughtful in\nhis counting-house, or else subjected to the pressure of his wife's\narguments in his private dwelling. He had never yet been won over to\nsay that he would agree to any proposition, but he knew that he must\nnow form some decision. Rowan would not even wait till the lawsuit\nshould be decided by legal means. If Mr. Tappitt would not consent\nto one of the three propositions made to him, Rowan would at once\ncommence the building of his new brewery. \"He is that sort of man,\"\nsaid Honyman, \"that if he puts a brick down nothing in the world will\nprevent him from going on.\"\n\n\"Of course it won't,\" said Mrs. Tappitt. \"Oh dear, oh dear, T.! if\nyou go on in this way we shall all be ruined; and then people will\nsay that it was my fault, and that I ought to have had you inquired\ninto about your senses.\"\n\nTappitt gnashed his teeth and rushed out of the dining-room back into\nhis brewery. Among all those who were around him there was not one\nto befriend him. Even Worts had turned against him, and had received\nnotice to go with a stern satisfaction which Tappitt had perfectly\nunderstood.\n\nTappitt was in this frame of mind, and was seated on his office\nstool, with his hat over his eyes, when he was informed by one of the\nboys about the place that a deputation from the town had come to wait\nupon him;--so he pulled off his hat, and begged that the deputation\nmight be shown into the counting-house. The deputation consisted of\nthree tradesmen who were desirous of convening a meeting with the\nview of discussing the petition against Mr. Cornbury's return to\nParliament, and they begged that Mr. Tappitt would take the chair.\nThe meeting was to be held at the Dragon, and it was proposed that\nafter the meeting there should be a little dinner. Mr. Tappitt would\nperhaps consent to take the chair at the dinner also. Mr. Tappitt\ndid consent to both propositions, and when the deputation withdrew,\nhe felt himself to be himself once more. His courage had returned\nto him, and he would at once rebuke his wife for the impropriety of\nthe words she had addressed to him. He would rebuke his wife, and\nwould then proceed to meet Mr. Sharpit the attorney, at the Dragon,\nand to take the chair at the meeting. It could not be that a young\nadventurer such as Rowan could put down an old-established firm, such\nas his own, or banish from the scene of his labours a man of such\nstanding in the town as himself! It was all the fault of Honyman,--of\nHonyman who never was firm on any matter. When the meeting should be\nover he would say a word or two to Sharpit, and see if he could not\nput the matter into better training.\n\nWith a heavy tread, a tread that was intended to mark his\ndetermination, he ascended to the drawing-room and from thence to the\nbed-room above in which Mrs. Tappitt was then seated. She understood\nthe meaning of the footfall, and knew well that it indicated a\npurpose of marital authority. A woman must have much less of natural\nwit than had fallen to Mrs. Tappitt's share, who has not learned from\nthe experience of thirty years the meaning of such marital signs and\nsounds. So she sat herself firmly in her seat, caught hold of the\npetticoat which she was mending with a stout grasp, and prepared\nherself for the battle. \"Margaret,\" said he, when he had carefully\nclosed the door behind him, \"I have come up to say that I do not\nintend to dine at home to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said she. \"At the Dragon, I suppose then.\"\n\n\"Yes; at the Dragon. I've been asked to take the chair at a popular\nmeeting which is to be held with reference to the late election.\"\n\n\"Take the chair!\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, take the chair at the meeting and at the dinner.\"\n\n\"Now, T., don't you make a fool of yourself.\"\n\n\"No, I won't; but Margaret, I must tell you once for all that that\nis not the way in which I like you to speak to me. Why you should\nhave so much less confidence in my judgment than other people in\nBaslehurst, I cannot conceive; but--\"\n\n\"Now, T., look here; as for your taking the chair as you call it, of\ncourse you can do it if you like it.\"\n\n\"Of course I can; and I do like it, and I mean to do it. But it isn't\nonly about that I've come to speak to you. You said something to me\nto-day, before Honyman, that was very improper.\"\n\n\"What I say always is improper, I know.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you could have intended to insinuate that you\nthought that I was a lunatic.\"\n\n\"I didn't say so.\"\n\n\"You said something like it.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, T.\"\n\n\"Yes you did, Margaret.\"\n\n\"If you'll allow me for a moment, T., I'll tell you what I did say,\nand if you wish it, I'll say it again.\"\n\n\"No; I'd rather not hear it said again.\"\n\n\"But, T., I don't choose to be misunderstood, nor yet\nmisrepresented.\"\n\n\"I haven't misrepresented you.\"\n\n\"But I say you have misrepresented me. If I ain't allowed to speak\na word, of course it isn't any use for me to open my mouth. I hope\nI know what my duty is and I hope I've done it;--both by you, T.,\nand by the children. I know I'm bound to submit, and I hope I have\nsubmitted. Very hard it has been sometimes when I've seen things\ngoing as they have gone; but I've remembered my duty as a wife,\nand I've held my tongue when any other woman in England would have\nspoken out. But there are some things which a woman can't stand and\nshouldn't; and if I'm to see my girls ruined and left without a roof\nover their heads, or a bit to eat, or a thing to wear, it shan't be\nfor want of a word from me.\"\n\n\"Didn't they always have plenty to eat?\"\n\n\"But where is it to come from if you're going to rush openmouthed\ninto the lion's jaws in this way? I've done my duty by you, T., and\nno man nor yet no woman can say anything to the contrary. And if it\nwas myself only I'd see myself on the brink of starvation before\nI'd say a word; but I can't see those poor girls brought to beggary\nwithout telling you what everybody in Baslehurst is talking about;\nand I can't see you, T., behaving in such a way and sit by and hold\nmy tongue.\"\n\n\"Behave in what way? Haven't I worked like a horse? Do you mean\nto tell me that I am to give up my business, and my position, and\neverything I have in the world, and go away because a young scoundrel\ncomes to Baslehurst and tells me that he wants to have my brewery? I\ntell you what, Margaret, if you think I'm that sort of man, you don't\nknow me yet.\"\n\n\"I don't know about knowing you, T.\"\n\n\"No; you don't know me.\"\n\n\"If you come to that, I know very well that I have been deceived.\nI didn't want to speak of it, but now I must. I have been made to\nbelieve for these last twenty years that the brewery was all your\nown, whereas it now turns out that you've only got a share in it, and\nfor aught I can see, by no means the best share. Why wasn't I told\nall that before?\"\n\n\"Woman!\" shouted Mr. Tappitt.\n\n\"Yes; woman indeed! I suppose I am a woman, and therefore I'm to have\nno voice in anything. Will you answer me one question, if you please?\nAre you going to that man, Sharpit?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Tappitt, I shall consult my brothers.\" Mrs. Tappitt's\nbrothers were grocers in Plymouth; men whom Mr. Tappitt had never\nloved. \"They mayn't hold their heads quite as high as you do,--or\nrather as you used to do when people thought that the establishment\nwas all your own; but such as it is nobody can turn them out of\ntheir shop in the Market-place. If you are going to Sharpit, I shall\nconsult them.\"\n\n\"You may consult the devil, if you like it.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! very well, Mr. Tappitt. It's clear enough that you're not\nyourself any longer, and that somebody must take up your affairs and\nmanage them for you. If you'll follow my advice you'll stay at home\nthis evening and take a dose of physic and see Dr. Haustus quietly in\nthe morning.\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Very well. Of course I can't make you. As yet you're your own\nmaster. If you choose to go to this silly meeting and then to drink\ngin and water and to smoke bad tobacco till all hours at the Dragon,\nand you in the dangerous state you are at present, I can't help\nit. I don't suppose that anything I could do now, that is quite\nimmediately, would enable me to put you under fitting restraint.\"\n\n\"Put me where?\" Then Mr. Tappitt looked at his wife with a look that\nwas intended to annihilate her, for the time being,--seeing that no\nwords that he could speak had any such effect,--and he hurried out of\nthe room without staying to wash his hands or brush his hair before\nhe went off to preside at the meeting.\n\nMrs. Tappitt remained where she was for about half an hour and then\ndescended among her daughters.\n\n\"Isn't papa going to dine at home?\" said Augusta.\n\n\"No, my dear; your papa is going to dine with some friends of Mr.\nHart's, the candidate who was beaten.\"\n\n\"And has he settled anything about the brewery?\" Cherry asked.\n\n\"No; not as yet. Your papa is very much troubled about it, and I fear\nhe is not very well. I suppose he must go to this electioneering\ndinner. When gentlemen take up that sort of thing, they must go on\nwith it. And as they wish your father to preside over the petition, I\nsuppose he he can't very well help himself.\"\n\n\"Is papa going to preside over the petition?\" asked Augusta.\n\n\"Yes, my dear.\"\n\n\"I hope it won't cost him anything,\" said Martha. \"People say that\nthose petitions do cost a great deal of money.\"\n\n\"It's a very anxious time for me, girls; of course, you must all of\nyou see that. I'm sure when we had our party I didn't think things\nwere going to be as anxious as this, or I wouldn't have had a penny\nspent in such a way as that. If your papa could bring himself to give\nup the brewery, everything would be well.\"\n\n\"I do so wish he would,\" said Cherry, \"and let us all go and live at\nTorquay. I do so hate this nasty dirty old place.\"\n\n\"I shall never live in a house I like so well,\" said Martha.\n\n\"The house is well enough, my dears, and so is the brewery, but it\ncan't be expected that your father should go on working for ever as\nhe does at present. It's too much for his strength;--a great deal too\nmuch. I can see it, though I don't suppose any one else can. No one\nknows, only me, what your father has gone through in that brewery.\"\n\n\"But why doesn't he take Mr. Rowan's offer?\" said Cherry.\n\n\"Everybody seems to say now that Rowan is ever so rich,\" said\nAugusta.\n\n\"I suppose papa doesn't like the feeling of being turned out,\" said\nMartha.\n\n\"He wouldn't be turned out, my dear; not the least in the world,\"\nsaid Mrs. Tappitt. \"I don't choose to interfere much myself because,\nperhaps, I don't understand it; but certainly I should like your papa\nto retire. I have told him so; but gentlemen sometimes don't like to\nbe told of things.\"\n\nMrs. Tappitt could be very severe to her husband, could say to him\nterrible words if her spirit were put up, as she herself was wont\nto say. But she understood that it did not become her to speak ill\nof their father before her girls. Nor would she willingly have been\nheard by the servants to scold their master. And though she said\nterrible things she said them with a conviction that they would not\nhave any terrible effect. Tappitt would only take them for what\nthey were worth, and would measure them by the standard which his\nold experience had taught him to adopt. When a man has been long\nconsuming red pepper, it takes much red pepper to stimulate his\npalate. Had Mrs. Tappitt merely advised her husband, in proper\nconjugal phraseology, to relinquish his trade and to retire to\nTorquay, her advice, she knew, would have had no weight. She was\neager on the subject, feeling convinced that this plan of retirement\nwas for the good of the family generally, and therefore she had\nadvocated it with energy. There may be those who think that a wife\ngoes too far in threatening a husband with a commission of lunacy,\nand frightening him with a prospect of various fatal diseases; but\nthe dose must be adapted to the constitution, and the palate that is\naccustomed to large quantities of red pepper must have quantities\nlarger than usual whenever some special culinary effect is to be\nachieved. On the present occasion Mrs. Tappitt went on talking to\nthe girls of their father in language that was quite eulogistic. No\nthreat against the absent brewer passed her mouth,--or theirs. But\nthey all understood each other, and were agreed that everything was\nto be done to induce papa to accept Mr. Rowan's offer.\n\n\"Then,\" said Cherry, \"he'll marry Rachel Ray, and she'll be mistress\nof the brewery house.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Mrs. Tappitt, very solemnly. \"Never! He'll never be\nsuch a fool as that.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Augusta. \"Never!\"\n\nIn the mean time the meeting went on at the Dragon. I can't say that\nMr. Tappitt was on this occasion called upon to preside over the\npetition. He was simply invited to take the chair at a meeting of\na dozen men at Baslehurst who were brought together by Mr. Sharpit\nin order that they might be induced by him to recommend Mr. Hart to\nemploy him, Mr. Sharpit, in getting up the petition in question; and\nin order that there might be some sufficient temptation to these\ntwelve men to gather themselves together, the dinner at the Dragon\nwas added to the meeting. Mr. Tappitt took the chair in the big,\nuncarpeted, fusty room upstairs, in which masonic meetings were held\nonce a month, and in which the farmers of the neighbourhood dined\nonce a week, on market days. He took the chair and some seven or\neight of his townsmen clustered round him. The others had sent word\nthat they would manage to come in time for the dinner. Mr. Sharpit,\nbefore he put the brewer in his place of authority, prompted him\nas to what he was to do, and in the course of a quarter of an hour\ntwo resolutions, already prepared by Mr. Sharpit, had been passed\nunanimously. Mr. Hart was to be told by the assembled people of\nBaslehurst that he would certainly be seated by a scrutiny, and\nhe was to be advised to commence his proceedings at once. These\nresolutions were duly committed to paper by one of Mr. Sharpit's\nclerks, and Mr. Tappitt, before he sat down to dinner, signed a\nletter to Mr. Hart on behalf of the electors of Baslehurst. When\nthe work of the meeting was completed it still wanted half an hour\nto dinner, during which the nine electors of Baslehurst sauntered\nabout the yard of the inn, looked into the stables, talked to the\nlandlady at the bar, indulged themselves with gin and bitters,\nand found the time very heavy on their hands. They were nine\ndecent-looking, middle-aged men, dressed in black not of the newest,\nin swallow-tailed coats and black trousers, with chimney-pot hats,\nand red faces; and as they pottered about the premises of the Dragon\nthey seemed to be very little at their ease.\n\n\"What's up, Jim?\" said one of the postboys to the ostler.\n\n\"Sharpit's got 'em all here to get some more money out of that ere\nJew gent;--that's about the ticket,\" said the ostler.\n\n\"He's a clever un,\" said the postboy.\n\nAt last the dinner was ready; and the total number of the party\nhaving now completed itself, the liberal electors of Baslehurst\nprepared to enjoy themselves. No bargain had been made on the\nsubject, but it was understood by them all that they would not be\nasked to pay for their dinner. Sharpit would see to that. He would\nprobably know how to put it into his little bill; and if he failed in\nthat the risk was his own.\n\nBut while the body of the liberal electors was peeping into the\nstables and drinking gin and bitters, Mr. Sharpit and Mr. Tappitt\nwere engaged in a private conference.\n\n\"If you come to me,\" said Sharpit, \"of course I must take it up. The\netiquette of the profession don't allow me to decline.\"\n\n\"But why should you wish to decline?\" said Tappitt, not altogether\npleased by Mr. Sharpit's manner.\n\n\"Oh, by no means; no. It's just the sort of work I like;--not much to\nbe made by it, but there's injury to be redressed and justice to be\ndone. Only you see poor Honyman hasn't got much of a practice left to\nhim, and I don't want to take his bread out of his mouth.\"\n\n\"But I'm not to be ruined because of that!\"\n\n\"As I said before, if you bring the business to me I must take it up.\nI can't help myself, if I would. And if I do take it up I'll see you\nthrough it. Everybody who knows me knows that of me.\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall find you at home about ten to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll be in my office at ten;--only you should think it\nwell over, you know, Mr. Tappitt. I've nothing to say against Mr.\nHonyman,--not a word. You'll remember that, if you please, if there\nshould be anything about it afterwards. Ah! you're wanted for the\nchair, Mr. Tappitt. I'll come and sit alongside of you, if you'll\nallow me.\"\n\nThe dinner itself was decidedly bad, and the company undoubtedly\ndull. I am inclined to think that every individual there would have\ndined more comfortably at home. A horrid mess concocted of old gravy,\ncatsup, and bad wine was distributed under the name of soup. Then\nthere came upon the table half a huge hake,--the very worst fish that\nswims, a fish with which Devonshire is peculiarly invested. Some hard\ndark brown mysterious balls were handed round, which on being opened\nwith a knife were found to contain sausage-meat, very greasy and by\nno means cooked through. Even the _dura ilia_ of the liberal electors\nof Baslehurst declined to make acquaintance with these dainties.\nAfter that came the dinner, consisting of a piece of roast beef very\nraw, and a leg of parboiled mutton, absolutely blue in its state of\nrawness. When the gory mess was seen which displayed itself on the\nfirst incision made into these lumps of meat, the vice-president\nand one or two of his friends spoke out aloud. That hard and greasy\nsausage-meat might have been all right for anything they knew to the\ncontrary, and the soup they had swallowed without complaint. But they\ndid know what should be the state of a joint of meat when brought\nto the table, and therefore they spoke out in their anger. Tappitt\nhimself said nothing that was intended to be carried beyond the\nwaiter, seeing that beer from his own brewery was consumed in the tap\nof the Dragon; but the vice-president was a hardware dealer with whom\nthe Dragon had but small connection of trade, and he sent terrible\nmessages down to the landlady, threatening her with the Blue Boar,\nthe Mitre, and even with that nasty little pothouse the Chequers.\n\"What is it they expects for their three-and-sixpence?\" said the\nlandlady, in her wrath; for it must be understood that Sharpit knew\nwell that he was dealing with one who understood the value of money,\nand that he did not feel quite sure of passing the dinner in Mr.\nHart's bill. Then came a pie with crust an inch thick, which nobody\ncould eat, and a cabinet pudding, so called, full of lumps of suet.\nI venture to assert that each liberal elector there would have got\na better dinner at home, and would have been served with greater\ncomfort; but a public dinner at an inn is the recognized relaxation\nof a middle-class Englishman in the provinces. Did he not attend\nsuch banquets his neighbours would conceive him to be constrained\nby domestic tyranny. Others go to them, and therefore he goes also.\nHe is bored frightfully by every speech to which he listens. He is\ndriven to the lowest depths of dismay by every speech which he is\ncalled upon to make. He is thoroughly disgusted when he is called on\nto make no speech. He has no point of sympathy with the neighbours\nbetween whom he sits. The wine is bad. The hot water is brought to\nhim cold. His seat is hard and crowded. No attempt is made at the\npleasures of conversation. He is continually called upon to stand\nup that he may pretend to drink a toast in honour of some person or\ninstitution for which he cares nothing; for the hero of the evening,\nas to whom he is probably indifferent; for the church, which\nperhaps he never enters; the army, which he regards as a hotbed of\naristocratic insolence; or for the Queen, whom he reveres and loves\nby reason of his nature as an Englishman, but against whose fulsome\npraises as repeated to him ad nauseam in the chairman's speech his\nvery soul unconsciously revolts. It is all a bore, trouble, ennui,\nnastiness, and discomfort. But yet he goes again and again,--because\nit is the relaxation natural to an Englishman. The Frenchman who sits\nfor three hours tilted on the hind legs of a little chair with his\nback against the window-sill of the caf\u00c3\u00a9, with first a cup of coffee\nbefore him and then a glass of sugar and water, is perhaps as much to\nbe pitied as regards his immediate misery; but the liquids which he\nimbibes are not so injurious to him.\n\nMr. Tappitt with the eleven other liberal electors of Baslehurst went\nthrough the ceremony of their dinner in the usual way. They drank\nthe health of the Queen, and of the volunteers of the county because\nthere was present a podgy little grocer who had enrolled himself in\nthe corps and who was thus enabled to make a speech; and then they\ndrank the health of Mr. Hart, whose ultimate return for the borough\nthey pledged themselves to effect. Having done so much for business,\nand having thus brought to a conclusion the political work of the\nevening, they adjourned their meeting to a cosy little parlour\nnear the bar, and then they began to be happy. Some few of the\nnumber, including the angry vice-president, who sold hardware, took\nthemselves home to their wives. \"Mrs. Tongs keeps him sharp enough by\nthe ears,\" said Sharpit, winking to Tappitt. \"Come along, old fellow,\nand we'll get a drop of something really hot.\" Tappitt winked back\nagain and shook his head with an affected laugh; but as he did so he\nthought of Mrs. T. at home, and the terrible words she had spoken to\nhim;--and at the same moment an idea came across him that Mr. Sharpit\nwas a very dangerous companion.\n\nAbout half a dozen entered the cosy little parlour, and there they\nremained for a couple of hours. While sitting in that cosy little\nparlour they really did enjoy themselves. About nine o'clock they\nhad a bit of the raw beef broiled, and in that guise it was pleasant\nenough; and the water was hot, and the tobacco was grateful and the\nstiffness of the evening was gone. The men chatted together and\nmade no more speeches, and they talked of matters which bore a true\ninterest to them. Sharpit explained to them how each man might be\nassisted in his own business if this rich London tailor could be\nbrought in for the borough. And by degrees they came round to the\naffairs of the brewery, and Tappitt, as the brandy warmed him, spoke\nloudly against Rowan.\n\n\"By George!\" said the podgy grocer, \"if anybody would offer me a\nthousand a year to give up, I'd take it hopping.\"\n\n\"Then I wouldn't,\" said Tappitt, \"and what's more, I won't. But\nbrewing ain't like other businesses;--there's more in it than in most\nothers.\"\n\n\"Of course there is,\" said Sharpit; \"it isn't like any common trade.\"\n\n\"That's true too,\" said the podgy grocer.\n\nA man usually receives some compensation for having gone through the\npenance of the chairman's duties. For the remainder of the evening he\nis entitled to the flattery of his companions, and generally receives\nit till they become tipsy and insubordinate. Tappitt had not the\ncharacter of an intemperate man, but on this occasion he did exceed\nthe bounds of a becoming moderation. The room was hot and the tobacco\nsmoke was thick. The wine had been bad and the brandy was strong.\nSharpit, too, urged him to new mixtures and stronger denunciations\nagainst Rowan, till at last, at eleven o'clock, when he took himself\nto the brewery, he was not in a condition proper for the father of\nsuch daughters or for the husband of such a wife.\n\n\"Shall I see him home?\" said the podgy grocer to Mr. Sharpit.\n\nTappitt, with the suspicious quickness of a drunken man, turned\nsharply upon the podgy and abashed grocer, and abused him for his\ninsolence. He then made his way out of the inn-yard, and along the\nHigh Street, and down Brewery Lane to his own door, knowing the way\nas well as though he had been sober, and passing over it as quickly.\nNor did he fall or even stumble, though now and again he reeled\nslightly. And as he went the idea came strongly upon him that\nSharpit was a dangerous man, and that perhaps at this very moment he,\nTappitt, was standing on the brink of a precipice. Then he remembered\nthat his wife would surely be watching for him, and as he made his\nfirst attempt to insert the latch-key into the door his heart became\nforgetful of the brandy, and sank low within his breast.\n\nHow affairs went between him and Mrs. Tappitt on that night I will\nnot attempt to describe. That she used her power with generosity I do\nnot doubt. That she used it with discretion I am quite convinced. On\nthe following morning at ten o'clock Tappitt was still in bed; but\na note had been written by Mrs. T. to Messrs. Sharpit and Longfite,\nsaying that the projected visit had, under altered circumstances,\nbecome unnecessary. That Tappitt's head was racked with pain, and his\nstomach disturbed with sickness, there can be no doubt, and as little\nthat Mrs. T. used the consequent weakness of her husband for purposes\nof feminine dominion; but this she did with discretion and even with\nkindness. Only a word or two was said as to the state in which he had\nreturned home,--a word or two with the simple object of putting that\ndominion on a firm basis. After that Mrs. Tappitt took his condition\nas an established fact, administered to him the comforts of her\nmedicine-chest and teapot, excused his illness to the girls as having\nbeen produced by the fish, and never left his bedside till she had\nachieved her purpose. If ever a man got tipsy to his own advantage,\nMr. Tappitt did so on that occasion. And if ever a man in that\ncondition was treated with forbearing kindness by his wife, Mr.\nTappitt was so treated then.\n\n\"Don't disturb yourself, T.,\" she said; \"there's nothing wants doing\nin the brewery, and if it did what would it signify in comparison\nwith your health? The brewery won't be much to you now, thank\ngoodness; and I'm sure you've had enough of it. Thirty years of such\nwork as that would make any man sick and weak. I'm sure I don't\nwonder at your being ill;--not the least. The wonder is that you've\never stood up against it so long as you have. If you'll take my\nadvice you'll just turn round and try to sleep for an hour or so.\"\n\nTappitt took her advice at any rate, so far that he turned round\nand closed his eyes. Up to this time he had not given way about the\nbrewery. He had uttered no word of assent. But he was gradually\nbecoming aware that he would have to yield before he would be allowed\nto put on his clothes. And now, in the base and weak condition of\nhis head and stomach, yielding did not seem to him to be so very\nbad a thing. After all, the brewery was troublesome, the fight was\nharassing. Rowan was young and strong, and Mr. Sharpit was very\ndangerous. Rowan, too, had risen in his estimation as in that of\nothers, and he could not longer argue, even to himself, that the\nstipulated income would not be paid. He did not sleep, but got into\nthat half-drowsy state in which men think of their existing affairs,\nbut without any power of active thought. He knew that he ought to be\nin his counting-house and at work. He half feared that the world was\nfalling away from him because he was not there. He was ashamed of\nhimself, and sometimes almost entertained a thought of rising up and\nshaking off his lethargy. But his stomach was bad, and he could not\nbring himself to move. His head was tormented, and his pillow was\nsoft; and therefore there he lay. He wondered what was the time of\nday, but did not think of looking at his watch which was under his\nhead. He heard his wife's steps about the room as she shaded some\nwindow from his eyes, or crept to the door to give some household\norder to one of her girls outside; but he did not speak to her,\nnor she to him. She did not speak to him as long as he lay there\nmotionless, and when he moved with a small low groan she merely\noffered him some beef tea.\n\nIt was nearly six o'clock, and the hour of dinner at the brewery\nwas long passed, when Mrs. Tappitt sat herself down by the\nbedside determined to reap the fruit of her victory. He had just\nraised himself in his bed and announced his intention of getting\nup,--declaring, as he did so, that he would never again eat any of\nthat accursed fish. The moment of his renovation had come upon him,\nand Mrs. Tappitt perceived that if he escaped from her now, there\nmight even yet be more trouble.\n\n\"It wasn't only the fish, T.,\" she said, with somewhat of sternness\nin her eye.\n\n\"I hardly drank anything,\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"Of course I wasn't there to see what you took,\" said she; \"but you\nwere very bad when you came home last night;--very bad indeed. You\ncouldn't have got in at the door only for me.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense.\"\n\n\"But it is quite true. It's a mercy, T., that neither of the girls\nsaw you. Only think! But there'll be nothing more of that kind, I'm\nsure, when we are out of this horrid place; and it wouldn't have\nhappened now, only for all this trouble.\"\n\nTo this Tappitt made no answer, but he grunted, and again said that\nhe thought he would get up.\n\n\"Of course it's settled now, T., that we're to leave this place.\"\n\n\"I don't know that at all.\"\n\n\"Then, T., you ought to know it. Come now; just look at the common\nsense of the thing. If we don't give up the brewery what are we to\ndo? There isn't a decent respectable person in the town in favour\nof our staying here, only that rascal Sharpit. You desired me this\nmorning to write and tell him you'd have nothing more to do with\nhim; and so I did.\" Tappitt had not seen his wife's letter to the\nlawyer,--had not asked to see it, and now became aware that his only\npossible supporter might probably have been driven away from him.\nSharpit too, though dangerous as an enemy, was ten times more\ndangerous as a friend!\n\n\"Of course you'll take that young man's offer. Shall I sit down and\nwrite a line to Honyman, and tell him to come in the morning?\"\n\nTappitt groaned again and again, said that he would get up, but\nMrs. T. would not let him out of bed till he had assented to her\nproposition that Honyman should be again invited to the brewery. He\nknew well that the battle was gone from him,--had in truth known it\nthrough all those half-comatose hours of his bedridden day. But a\nman, or a nation, when yielding must still resist even in yielding.\nTappitt fumed and fussed under the clothes, protesting that his\nsending for Honyman would be useless. But the letter was written in\nhis name and sent with his knowledge; and it was perfectly understood\nthat that invitation to Honyman signified an unconditional surrender\non the part of Mr. Tappitt. One word Mrs. T. said as she allowed her\nhusband to escape from his prison amidst the blankets, one word by\nwhich to mark that the thing was done, and one word only. \"I suppose\nwe needn't leave the house for about a month or so,--because it would\nbe inconvenient about the furniture.\"\n\n\"Who's to turn you out if you stay for six months?\" said Tappitt.\n\nThe thing was marked enough then, and Mrs. Tappitt retired in muffled\ntriumph,--retired when she had made all things easy for the simplest\nceremony of dressing.\n\n\"Just sponge your face, my dear,\" she said, \"and put on your\ndressing-gown, and come down for half an hour or so.\"\n\n\"I'm all right now,\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"Oh! quite so;--but I wouldn't go to the trouble of much dressing.\"\nThen she left him, descended the stairs, and entered the parlour\namong her daughters. When there she could not abstain from one\nblast of the trumpet of triumph. \"Well, girls,\" she said, \"it's all\nsettled, and we shall be in Torquay now before the winter.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Augusta.\n\n\"That'll be a great change,\" said Martha.\n\n\"In Torquay before the winter!\" said Cherry. \"Oh, mamma, how clever\nyou have been!\"\n\n\"And now your papa is coming down, and you should thank him for what\nhe's doing for you. It's all for your sake that he's doing it.\"\n\nMr. Tappitt crept into the room, and when he had taken his seat in\nhis accustomed arm-chair, the girls went up to him and kissed him.\nThen they thanked him for his proposed kindness in taking them out of\nthe brewery.\n\n\"Oh, papa, it is so jolly!\" said Cherry.\n\nMr. Tappitt did not say much in answer to this;--but luckily there\nwas no necessity that he should say anything. It was an occasion on\nwhich silence was understood as giving a perfect consent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nWHAT TOOK PLACE AT BRAGG'S END FARM.\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Tappitt had settled within her own mind that the brewery\nshould be abandoned to Rowan, she was by no means, therefore, ready\nto assent that Rachel Ray should become the mistress of the brewery\nhouse. \"Never,\" she had exclaimed when Cherry had suggested such a\nresult; \"never!\" And Augusta had echoed the protestation, \"Never,\nnever!\" I will not say that she would have allowed her husband to\nremain in his business in order that she might thus exclude Rachel\nfrom such promotion, but she could not bring herself to believe that\nLuke Rowan would be so fatuous, so ignorant of his own interests, so\ndeluded, as to marry that girl from Bragg's End! It is thus that the\nMrs. Tappitts of the world regard other women's daughters when they\nhave undergone any disappointment as to their own. She had no reason\nfor wishing well to Rowan, and would not have cared if he had taken\nto his bosom a harpy in marriage; but she could not endure to hear of\nthe success of the girl whose attractions had foiled her own little\nplan. \"I don't believe that the man can ever be such a fool as that!\"\nshe said again to Augusta, when on the evening of the day following\nTappitt's abdication, a rumour reached the brewery that Luke Rowan\nhad been seen walking out upon the Cawston road.\n\nMr. Honyman, in accordance with his instructions, called at the\nbrewery on that morning, and was received by Mr. Tappitt with a\nsullen and almost savage submission. Mrs. T. had endeavoured to catch\nhim first, but in that she had failed; she did, however, manage to\nsee the attorney as he came out from her husband.\n\n\"It's all settled,\" said Honyman; \"and I'll see Rowan myself before\nhalf an hour is over.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's a great blessing, Mr. Honyman,\" said the lady,--not on\nthat occasion assuming any of the glory to herself.\n\n\"It was the only thing for him,\" said Mr. Honyman;--\"that is if he\ndidn't like to take the young man in as acting partner.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't have done at all,\" said Mrs. T. And then the lawyer\nwent his way.\n\nIn the mean time Tappitt sat sullen and wretched in the\ncounting-house. Such moments occur in the lives of most of\nus,--moments in which the real work of life is brought to an\nend,--and they cannot but be sad. It is very well to talk of ease and\ndignity; but ease of spirit comes from action only, and the world's\ndignity is given to those who do the world's work. Let no man put his\nneck from out of the collar till in truth he can no longer draw the\nweight attached to it. Tappitt had now got rid of his collar, and he\nsat very wretched in his brewery counting-house.\n\n\"Be I to go, sir?\"\n\nTappitt in his meditation was interrupted by these words, spoken\nnot in a rough voice, and looking up he saw Worts standing in the\ncounting-house before him. Worts had voted for Butler Cornbury,\nwhereas, had he voted for Mr. Hart, Mr. Hart would have been\nreturned; and, upon that, Worts, as a rebellious subject, had\nreceived notice to quit the premises. Now his time was out, and he\ncame to ask whether he was to leave the scene of his forty years of\nwork. But what would be the use of sending Worts away even if the\nwish to punish his contumacy still remained? In another week Worts\nwould be brought back again in triumph, and would tread those brewery\nfloors with the step almost of a master, while he, Tappitt, could\ntread them only as a stranger, if he were allowed to tread them at\nall.\n\n\"You can stay if you like,\" said Tappitt, hardly looking up at the\nman.\n\n\"I know you be a going, Mr. Tappitt,\" said the man; \"and I hear you\nbe a going very handsome like. Gentlefolk such as yeu needn't go on\nworking allays like uz. If so be yeu be a going, Mr. Tappitt, I hope\nyeu and me'll part friendly. We've been together a sight o'\nyears;--too great a sight for uz to part unfriendly.\"\n\nMr. Tappitt admitted the argument, shook hands with the man, and then\nof course took him into his immediate confidence with more warmth\nthan he would have done had there been no quarrel between them. And\nI think he found some comfort in this. He walked about the premises\nwith Worts, telling him much that was true, and some few things that\nwere not strictly accurate. For instance, he said that he had made\nup his mind to leave the place, whereas that action of decisive\nresolution which we call making up our minds had perhaps been done by\nMrs. Tappitt rather than by him. But Worts took all these assertions\nwith an air of absolute belief which comforted the brewer. Worts was\nvery wise in his discretion on that day, and threw much oil on the\ntroubled waters; so that Tappitt when he left him bade God bless him,\nand expressed a hope that the old place might still thrive for his\nsake.\n\n\"And for your'n too, master,\" said Worts, \"for yeu'll allays have the\nbest egg still. The young master, he'll only be a working for yeu.\"\n\nThere was comfort in this thought; and Tappitt, when he went into his\ndinner, was able to carry himself like a man.\n\nThe tidings which had reached Mrs. Tappitt as to Rowan having been\nseen on that evening walking on the Cawston road with his face\ntowards Bragg's End were true. On that morning Mr. Honyman had come\nto him, and his career in life was at once settled for him.\n\n\"Mr. Tappitt is quite in time, Mr. Honyman,\" he had said. \"But he\nwould not have been in time this day week unless he had consented\nto pay for what work had been already done; for I had determined to\nbegin at once.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Mr. Rowan, you step into an uncommon good thing; but\nMr. Tappitt is tired of the work, and glad to give it up.\"\n\nThus the matter was arranged between them, and before nightfall\neverybody in Baslehurst knew that Tappitt and Rowan had come to\nterms, and that Tappitt was to retire upon a pension. There was some\nlittle discrepancy as to the amount of Tappitt's annuity, the liberal\nfaction asserting that he was to receive two thousand a year, and\nthose of the other side cutting him down to two hundred.\n\nOn the evening of that day--in the cool of the evening--Luke Rowan\nsauntered down the High Street of Baslehurst, and crossed over\nCawston bridge. On the bridge he was all alone, and he stood there\nfor a moment or two leaning upon the parapet looking down upon the\nlittle stream beneath the arch. During the day many things had\noccupied him, and he had hardly as yet made up his mind definitely\nas to what he would do and what he would say during the hours of\nthe evening. From the moment in which Honyman had announced to him\nTappitt's intended resignation he became aware that he certainly\nshould go out to Bragg's End before that day was over. It had been\nwith him a settled thing, a thing settled almost without thought ever\nsince the receipt of Rachel's letter, that he would take this walk to\nBragg's End when he should have put his affairs at Baslehurst on some\nstable footing; but that he would not take that walk before he had so\ndone.\n\n\"They say,\" Rachel had written in her letter, \"they say that as the\nbusiness here about the brewery is so very unsettled, they think it\nprobable that you will not have to come back to Baslehurst any more.\"\n\nIn that had been the offence. They had doubted his stability, and,\nbeyond that, had almost doubted his honesty. He would punish them\nby taking them at their word till both should be put beyond all\nquestion. He knew well that the punishment would fall on Rachel,\nwhereas none of the sin would have been Rachel's sin; but he would\nnot allow himself to be deterred by that consideration.\n\n\"It is her letter,\" he said to himself, \"and in that way will I\nanswer her. When I do go there again they will all understand me\nbetter.\"\n\nIt had been, too, a matter of pride to him that Mr. Comfort and Mrs.\nButler Cornbury should thus be made to understand him. He would say\nnothing of himself and his own purposes to any of them. He would\nspeak neither of his own means nor his own stedfastness. But he\nwould prove to them that he was stedfast, and that he had boasted\nof nothing which he did not possess. When Mrs. Butler Cornbury had\nspoken to him down by the Cleeves, asking him of his purpose, and\nstruggling to do a kind thing by Rachel, he had resolved at once that\nhe would tell her nothing. She should find him out. He liked her for\nloving Rachel; but neither to her, nor even to Rachel herself, would\nhe say more till he could show them that the business about the\nbrewery was no longer unsettled.\n\nBut up to this moment--this moment in which he was standing on the\nbridge, he had not determined what he would say to Rachel or to\nRachel's mother. He had never relaxed in his purpose of making Rachel\nhis wife since his first visit to the cottage. He was one who, having\na fixed resolve, feels certain of their ultimate success in achieving\nit. He was now going to Bragg's End to claim that which he regarded\nas his own; but he had not as yet told himself in what terms he would\nput forward his claim. So he stood upon the bridge thinking.\n\nHe stood upon the bridge thinking, but his thoughts would only go\nbackwards, and would do nothing for him as to his future conduct.\nHe remembered his first walk with her, and the churchyard elms with\nthe setting sun, and the hot dances in Mrs. Tappitt's house; and he\nremembered them without much of the triumph of a successful lover.\nIt had been very sweet, but very easy. In so saying to himself he by\nno means threw blame upon Rachel. Things were easy, he thought, and\nit was almost a pity that they should be so. As for Rachel, nothing\ncould have been more honest or more to his taste, than her mode of\nlearning to love him. A girl who, while intending to accept him,\ncould yet have feigned indifference, would have disgusted him at\nonce. Nevertheless he could not but wish that there had been some\ncastles for him to storm in his career. Tappitt had made but poor\npretence of fighting before he surrendered; and as to Rachel, it had\nnot been in Rachel's nature to make any pretence. He passed from the\nbridge at last without determining what he would say when he reached\nthe cottage, but he did not pass on till he had been seen by the\nscrutinizing eyes of Miss Pucker.\n\n\"If there ain't young Rowan going out to Bragg's End again!\" she\nsaid to herself, comforting herself, I fear, or striving to comfort\nherself, with an inward assertion that he was not going there for\nany good. Striving to comfort herself, but not effectually; for\nthough the assertion was made by herself to herself, yet it was not\nbelieved. Though she declared, with well-pronounced mental words,\nthat Luke Rowan was going on that path for no good purpose, she felt\na wretched conviction at her heart's core that Rachel Ray would\nbe made to triumph over her and her early suspicions by a happy\nmarriage. Nevertheless she carried the tidings up into Baslehurst,\nand as she repeated it to the grocer's daughters and the baker's wife\nshe shook her head with as much apparent satisfaction as though she\nreally believed that Rachel oscillated between a ruined name and a\nbroken heart.\n\nHe walked on very slowly towards Bragg's End, as though he almost\ndreaded the interview, swinging his stick as was his custom, and\nkeeping his feet on the grassy edges of the road till he came to the\nturn which brought him on to the green. When on the green he did not\ntake the highway, but skirted along under Farmer Sturt's hedge, so\nthat he had to pass by the entrance of the farmyard before he crossed\nover to the cottage. Here, just inside her own gate, he encountered\nMrs. Sturt standing alone. She had been intent on the cares of\nher poultry-yard till she had espied Luke Rowan; but then she had\nforgotten chickens and ducks and all, and had given herself up to\nthoughts of Rachel's happiness in having her lover back again.\n\n\"It's he as sure as eggs,\" she had said to herself when she first saw\nhim; \"how mortal slow he do walk, to be sure! If he was coming as joe\nto me I'd soon shake him into quicker steps than them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Sturt!\" said he, \"I hope you're quite well,\" and he stopped\nshort at her gate.\n\n\"Pretty bobbish, thankee, Mr. Rowan; and how's yourself? Are you\ngoing over to the cottage this evening?\"\n\n\"Who's at home there, Mrs. Sturt?\"\n\n\"Well, they're all at home; Mrs. Ray, and Rachel, and Mrs. Prime. I\ndoubt whether you know the eldest daughter, Mr. Rowan?\"\n\nLuke did not know Mrs. Prime, and by no means wished to spend any of\nthe hours of the present evening in making her acquaintance.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Prime there?\" he asked.\n\n\"'Deed she is, Mr. Rowan. She's come back these last two days.\"\n\nThereupon Rowan paused for a moment, having carefully placed himself\ninside the gate-posts of the farmyard so that he might not be seen by\nthe inmates of the cottage, if haply he had hitherto escaped their\neyes.\n\n\"Mrs. Sturt,\" said he, \"I wonder whether you'd do me a great favour.\"\n\n\"That depends--\" said Mrs. Sturt. \"If it's to do any good to any of\nthem over there, I will.\"\n\n\"If I wanted to do harm to any of them I shouldn't come to you.\"\n\n\"Well, I should hope not. Is she and you going to be one, Mr. Rowan?\nThat's about the whole of it.\"\n\n\"It shan't be my fault if we're not,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"That's spoken honest,\" said the lady; \"and now I'll do anything in\nmy power to bring you together. If you'll just go into my little\nparlour, I'll bring her to you in five seconds; I will indeed, Mr.\nRowan. You won't mind going through the kitchen for once, will you?\"\n\nLuke did not mind going through the kitchen, and immediately found\nhimself shut up in Mrs. Sturt's back parlour, looking out among the\nmingled roses and cabbages.\n\nMrs. Sturt walked quickly across the road to the cottage door, and\nwent at once to the open window of the sitting-room. Mrs. Ray was\nthere with a book in her hand,--a serious book, the perusal of which\nI fear was in some degree due to the presence of her elder daughter;\nand Mrs. Prime was there with another book, evidently very serious;\nand Rachel was there too, seated on the sofa, deeply buried in the\nmanipulation of a dress belonging to her mother. Mrs. Sturt was sure\nat once that they had not seen Luke Rowan as he passed inside the\nfarmyard gate, and that they did not suspect that he was near them.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Sturt, is that you?\" said the widow, looking up. \"You'll\njust come in for a minute, won't you?\" and Mrs. Ray showed by a\nsuppressed yawn that her attention had not been deeply fixed by that\nserious book. Rachel looked up, and bade the visitor welcome with a\nlittle nod; but it was not a cheery nod as it would have been in old\ndays, before her sorrow had come upon her.\n\n\"I'll have the cherries back in her cheeks before the evening's\nover,\" said Mrs. Sturt to herself, as she looked at the pale-faced\ngirl. Mrs. Prime also made some little salutation to their neighbour;\nbut she did so with the very smallest expenditure of thoughts or\nmoments. Mrs. Sturt was all very well, but Mrs. Prime had greater\nwork on hand than gossiping with Mrs. Sturt.\n\n\"I'll not just come in, thankee, Mrs. Ray; but if it ain't troubling\nyou I want to speak a word to you outside; and a word to Rachel too,\nif she don't mind coming.\"\n\n\"A word to me!\" said Rachel getting up and putting down her dress.\nHer thoughts now-a-days were always fixed on the same subject, and\nit seemed that any special word to her must have reference to that.\nMrs. Ray also got up, leaving her mark in her book. Mrs. Prime went\non reading, harder than ever. There was to be some conference of\nimportance from which she could not but feel herself to be excluded\nin a very special way. Something wicked was surely to be proposed,\nor she would have been allowed to hear it. She said nothing, but her\nhead was almost shaken by the vehemence with which she read the book\nin her lap.\n\nMrs. Sturt retired beyond the precincts of the widow's front garden\nbefore she said a word. Rachel had followed her first through the\ngate, and Mrs. Ray came after with her apron turned over her head.\n\"What is it, Mrs. Sturt?\" said Rachel. \"Have you heard anything?\"\n\n\"Heard anything? Well; I'm always a hearing of something. Do you\nslip across the green while I speak just one word to your mother.\nAnd Rachel, wait for me at the gate. Mrs. Ray, he's in my little\nparlour.\"\n\n\"Who? not Luke Rowan?\"\n\n\"But he is though; that very young man! He's come over to make it up\nwith her. He's told me so with his own mouth. You may be as sure of\nit as,--as,--as anything. You leave 'em to me, Mrs. Ray; I wouldn't\nbring them together if it wasn't for good. It's my belief our pet\nwould a' died if he hadn't come back to her--it is then.\" And Mrs.\nSturt put her apron up to her eyes.\n\nRachel having paused for a moment, as she looked first at her mother\nand then at Mrs. Sturt, had done as she was bidden, and had walked\nquickly across the green. Mrs. Ray, when she heard her neighbour's\ntidings, stood fixed by dismay and dread, mingled with joy. She had\nlonged for his coming back; but now that he was there, close upon\nthem, intending to do all that she had wished him to do, she was half\nafraid of him! After all was he not a young man; and might he not,\neven yet, be a wolf? She was horrorstricken at the idea of sending\nRachel over to see a lover, and looked back at the cottage window,\ntowards Mrs. Prime, as though to see whether she was being watched\nin her iniquity. \"Oh, Mrs. Sturt!\" she said, \"why didn't you give us\ntime to think about it?\"\n\n\"Give you time! How could I give you time, and he here on the spot?\nThere's been too much time to my thinking. When young folk are\nagreeable and the old folk are agreeable too, there can't be too\nlittle time. Come along over and we'll talk of it in the kitchen\nwhile they talks in the parlour. He'd a' been in there among you all\nonly for Mrs. Prime. She is so dour like for a young man to have to\nsay anything before her, of the likes of that. That's why I took him\ninto our place.\"\n\nThey overtook Rachel at the house door and they all went through\ntogether into the great kitchen. \"Oh, Rachel!\" said Mrs. Ray. \"Oh,\ndear!\"\n\n\"What is it, mamma?\" said Rachel. Then looking into her mother's\nface, she guessed the truth. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"he's here! Mr. Rowan\nis here!\" And she took hold of her mother's arm, as though to support\nherself.\n\n\"And that's just the truth,\" said Mrs. Sturt, triumphantly. \"He's\nthrough there in the little parlour, and you must just go to him, my\ndear, and hear what he's got to say to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\" said Rachel.\n\n\"I suppose you must do what she tells you,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Of course she must,\" said Mrs. Sturt.\n\n\"Mamma, you must go to him,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"That won't do at all,\" said Mrs. Sturt.\n\n\"And why has he come here?\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Ah! I wonder why,\" said Mrs. Sturt. \"I wonder why any young man\nshould come on such an errand! But it won't do to leave him there\nstanding in my parlour by himself, so do you come along with me.\"\n\nSo saying Mrs. Sturt took Rachel by the arm to lead her away. Mrs.\nRay in this great emergency was perfectly helpless. She could simply\nlook at her daughter with imploring, loving eyes, and stand quivering\nin doubt against the dresser. Mrs. Sturt had very decided views on\nthe matter. She had put Luke Rowan into the parlour with a promise\nthat she would bring Rachel to him there, and she was not going to\nbreak her word through any mock delicacy. The two young people liked\none another, and they should have this opportunity of saying so in\neach other's hearing. So she took Rachel by the arm, and opening the\ndoor of the parlour led her into the room. \"Mr. Rowan,\" she said,\n\"when you and Miss Rachel have had your say out, you'll find me and\nher mamma in the kitchen.\" Then she closed the door and left them\nalone.\n\nRachel, when first summoned out of the cottage, had felt at once\nthat Mrs. Sturt's visit must have reference to Luke Rowan. Indeed\neverything with her in her present moods had some reference to\nhim,--some reference though it might be ever so remote. But now\nbefore she had time to form a thought, she was told that he was there\nin the same house with her, and that she was taken to him in order\nthat she might hear his words and speak her own. It was very sudden;\nand for the space of a few moments she would have fled away from Mrs.\nSturt's kitchen had such flight been possible. Since Rowan had gone\nfrom her there had been times in which she would have fled to him, in\nwhich she would have journeyed alone any distance so that she might\ntell him of her love, and ask whether she had got any right to hope\nfor his. But all that seemed to be changed. Though her mother was\nthere with her and her friend, she feared that this seeking of her\nlover was hardly maidenly. Should he not have come to her,--every\nfoot of the way to her feet, and there have spoken if he had aught to\nsay, before she had been called on to make any sign? Would he like\nher for thus going to him? But then she had no chance of escape. She\nfound herself in Mrs. Sturt's kitchen under her mother's sanction,\nbefore she had been able to form any purpose; and then an idea did\ncome to her, even at that moment, that poor Luke would have had a\nhard task of it in her sister's presence. When she was first told\nthat he was there in the farm-house parlour, her courage left her and\nshe dreaded the encounter; but she was able to collect her thoughts\nas she passed out of the kitchen, and across the passage, and when\nshe followed Mrs. Sturt into the room she had again acquired the\npower to carry herself as a woman having a soul of her own.\n\n\"Rachel!\" Rowan said, stepping up to her and tendering his hand to\nher. \"I have come to answer your letter in person.\"\n\n\"I knew,\" she said, \"when I wrote it, that my letter did not deserve\nany answer. I did not expect an answer.\"\n\n\"But am I wrong now to bring you one in person? I have thought so\nmuch of seeing you again! Will you not say a word of welcome to me?\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Mr. Rowan.\"\n\n\"Mr. Rowan! Nay; if it is to be Mr. Rowan I may as well go back to\nBaslehurst. It has come to that, that it must be Luke now, or there\nmust be no naming of names between us. You chided me once when I\ncalled you Rachel.\"\n\n\"You called me so once, sir, when I should have chided you and did\nnot. I remember it well. You were very wrong, and I was very\nfoolish.\"\n\n\"But I may call you Rachel now?\" Then, when she did not answer him at\nthe moment, he asked the question again in that imperious way which\nwas common with him. \"May I not call you now as I please? If it be\nnot so my coming here is useless. Come, Rachel, say one word to me\nboldly. Do you love me well enough to be my wife?\"\n\nShe was standing at the open window, looking away from him, while he\nremained at a little distance from her as though he would not come\nclose to her till he had exacted from her some positive assurance\nof her love as a penance for the fault committed by her letter. He\ncertainly was not a soft lover, nor by any means inclined to abate\nhis own privileges. He paused a moment as though he thought that his\nlast question must elicit a plain reply. But no reply to it came. She\nstill looked away from him through the window, as though resolved\nthat she would not speak till his mood should have become more\ntender.\n\n\"You said something in your letter,\" he continued, \"about my affairs\nhere in Baslehurst being unsettled. I would not show myself here\nagain till that matter was arranged.\"\n\n\"It was not I,\" she said, turning sharply round upon him. \"It was not\nI who thought that.\"\n\n\"It was in your letter, Rachel.\"\n\n\"Do you know so little of a girl like me as to suppose that what was\nwritten there came from me, myself? Did I not tell you that I said\nwhat I was told to say? Did I not explain to you that mamma had gone\nto Mr. Comfort? Did you not know that all that had come from him?\"\n\n\"I only know that I read it in your letter to me,--the only letter\nyou had ever written to me.\"\n\n\"You are unfair to me, Mr. Rowan. You know that you are unfair.\"\n\n\"Call me Luke,\" he said. \"Call me by my own name.\"\n\n\"Luke,\" she said, \"you are unfair to me.\"\n\n\"Then by heavens it shall be for the last time. May things in this\nworld and the next go well with me as I am fair to you for the\nfuture!\" So saying he came up close to her, and took her at once in\nhis arms.\n\n\"Luke, Luke; don't. You frighten me; indeed you do.\"\n\n\"You shall give me a fair open kiss, honestly, before I leave\nyou,--in truth you shall. If you love me, and wish to be my wife,\nand intend me to understand that you and I are now pledged to each\nother beyond the power of any person to separate us by his advice,\nor any mother by her fears, give me a bold, honest kiss, and I will\nunderstand that it means all that.\"\n\nStill she hesitated for a moment, turning her face away from him\nwhile he held her by the waist. She hesitated while she was weighing\nthe meaning of his words, and taking them home to herself as her\nown. Then she turned her neck towards him, still holding back her\nhead till her face was immediately under his own, and after another\nmoment's pause she gave him her pledge as he had asked it. Mrs.\nSturt's words had come true, and the cherries had returned to her\ncheek.\n\n\"My own Rachel! And now tell me one thing: are you happy?\"\n\n\"So happy!\"\n\n\"My own one!\"\n\n\"But, Luke,--I have been wretched;--so wretched! I thought you would\nnever come back to me.\"\n\n\"And did that make you wretched?\"\n\n\"Ah!--did it? What do you think yourself? When I wrote that letter\nto you I knew I had no right to expect that you would think of me\nagain.\"\n\n\"But how could I help thinking of you when I loved you?\"\n\n\"And then when mamma saw you in Exeter, and you sent me no word of\nmessage!\"\n\n\"I was determined to send none till this business was finished.\"\n\n\"Ah! that was cruel. But you did not understand. I suppose no man can\nunderstand. I couldn't have believed it myself till--till after you\nhad gone away. It seemed as though all the sun had deserted us, and\nthat everything was cold and dark.\"\n\nThey stood at the open window looking out upon the roses and cabbages\ntill the patience of Mrs. Sturt and of Mrs. Ray was exhausted. What\nthey said, beyond so much of their words as I have repeated, need not\nbe told. But when a low half-abashed knock at the door interrupted\nthem, Luke thought that they had hardly been there long enough to\nsettle the preliminaries of the affair which had brought him to\nBragg's End.\n\n\"May we come in?\" said Mrs. Sturt very timidly.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, mamma!\" said Rachel, and she hid her face upon her\nmother's shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMRS. PRIME READS HER RECANTATION.\n\n\nAbove an hour had passed after the interruption mentioned at the end\nof the last chapter before Mrs. Ray and Rachel crossed back from the\nfarm-house to the cottage, and when they went they went alone. During\nthat hour they had been sitting in Mrs. Sturt's parlour; and when at\nlast they got up to go they did not press Luke Rowan to go with them.\nMrs. Prime was at the cottage, and it was necessary that everything\nshould be explained to her before she was asked to give her hand to\nher future brother-in-law. The farmer had come in and had joked his\njoke, and Mrs. Sturt had clacked over them as though they were a\nbrood of chickens of her own hatching; and Mrs. Ray had smiled and\ncried, and sobbed and laughed till she had become almost hysterical.\nThen she had jumped up from her seat, saying, \"Oh, dear, what will\nDorothea think has become of us?\" After that Rachel insisted upon\ngoing, and the mother and daughter returned across the green, leaving\nLuke at the farm-house, ready to take his departure as soon as Mrs.\nRay and Rachel should have safely reached their home.\n\n\"I knew thee was minded stedfast to take her,\" said Mrs. Sturt,\n\"when it came out upon the newspaper how thou hadst told them all in\nBaslehurst that thou wouldst wed none but a Baslehurst lass.\"\n\nIn answer to this Luke protested that he had not thought of Rachel\nwhen he was making that speech, and tried to explain that all\nthat was \"soft sawder\" as he called it, for the election. But the\nwords were too apposite to the event, and the sentiment too much\nin accordance with Mrs. Sturt's chivalric views to allow of her\nadmitting the truth of any such assurance as this.\n\n\"I know,\" she said; \"I know. And when I read them words in the\nnewspaper I said to the gudeman there, we shall have bridecake from\nthe cottage now before Christmas.\"\n\n\"For the matter of that, so you shall,\" said Luke, shaking hands with\nher as he went, \"or the fault will not be mine.\"\n\nRachel, as she followed her mother out from the farmyard gate, had\nnot a word to say. Could it have been possible she would have wished\nto remain silent for the remainder of the evening and for the night,\nso that she might have time to think of this thing which she had\ndone, and to enjoy the full measure of her happiness. Hitherto she\nhad hardly had any joy in her love. The cup had been hardly given to\nher to drink before it had been again snatched away, and since then\nshe had been left to think that the draught for which she longed\nwould never again be offered to her lips. The whole affair had now\nbeen managed so suddenly, and the action had been so quick, that she\nhad hardly found a moment for thought. Could it be that things were\nso fixed that there was no room for further disappointment? She had\nbeen scalded so cruelly that she still feared the hot water. Her\nheart was sore with the old hurt, as the head that has ached will be\nstill sore when the actual malady has passed away. She longed for\nhours of absolute quiet, in which she might make herself sure that\nher malady had also passed away, and that the soreness which remained\ncame only from the memory of former pain. But there was no such\nperfect rest within her reach as yet.\n\n\"Will you tell her or shall I?\" said Mrs. Ray, pausing for a moment\nat the cottage gate.\n\n\"You had better tell her, mamma.\"\n\n\"I suppose she won't set herself against it; will she?\"\n\n\"I hope not, mamma. I shall think her very ill-natured if she does.\nBut it can't make any real difference now, you know.\"\n\n\"No; it can't make any difference. Only it will be so uncomfortable.\"\n\nThen with half-frightened, muffled steps they entered their own\nhouse, and joined Mrs. Prime in the sitting-room.\n\nMrs. Prime was still reading the serious book; but I am bound to say\nthat her mind had not been wholly intent upon it during the long\nabsence of her mother and sister. She had struggled for a time to\nignore the slight fact that her companions were away gossiping with\nthe neighbouring farmer's wife; she had made a hard fight with her\nbook, pinning her eyes down upon the page over and over again, as\nthough in pinning down her eyes she could pin down her mind also.\nBut by degrees the delay became so long that she was tantalized\ninto surmises as to the subject of their conversation. If it were\nnot wicked, why should not she have been allowed to share it? She\ndid not imagine it to be wicked according to the world's ordinary\nwickedness;--but she feared that it was wicked according to that\ntone of morals to which she was desirous of tying her mother down as\na bond slave. They were away talking about love and pleasure, and\nthose heart-throbbings in which her sister had so unfortunately been\nallowed to indulge. She felt all but sure that some tidings of Luke\nRowan had been brought in Mrs. Sturt's budget of news, and she had\nnever been able to think well of Luke Rowan since the evening on\nwhich she had seen him standing with Rachel in the churchyard. She\nknew nothing against him; but she had then made up her mind that he\nwas pernicious, and she could not bring herself to own that she had\nbeen wrong in that opinion. She had been loud and defiant in her\ndenunciation when she had first suspected Rachel of having a lover.\nSince that she had undergone some troubles of her own by which the\ntone of her remonstrances had been necessarily moderated; but even\nnow she could not forgive her sister such a lover as Luke Rowan. She\nwould have been quite willing to see her sister married, but the\nlover should have been dingy, black-coated, lugubrious, having about\nhim some true essence of the tears of the valley of tribulation.\nAlas, her sister's taste was quite of another kind!\n\n\"I'm afraid you will have been thinking that we were never coming\nback again,\" said Mrs. Ray, as she entered the room.\n\n\"No, mother, I didn't think that. But I thought you were staying late\nwith Mrs. Sturt.\"\n\n\"So we were,--and really I didn't think we had been so long. But,\nDorothea, there was some one else over there besides Mrs. Sturt, and\nhe kept us.\"\n\n\"He! What he?\" said Mrs. Prime. She had not even suspected that the\nlover had been over there in person.\n\n\"Mr. Rowan, my dear. He has been at the farm.\"\n\n\"What! the young man that was dismissed from Mr. Tappitt's?\"\n\nIt was ill said of her,--very ill said, and so she was herself aware\nas soon as the words were out of her mouth. But she could not help\nit. She had taken a side against Luke Rowan, and could not restrain\nherself from ill-natured words. Rachel was still standing in the\nmiddle of the room when she heard her lover thus described; but she\nwould not condescend to plead in answer to such a charge. The colour\ncame to her cheeks, and she threw up her head with a gesture of angry\npride, but at the moment she said nothing. Mrs. Ray spoke.\n\n\"It seems to me, Dorothea,\" she said, \"that you are mistaken there. I\nthink he has dismissed Mr. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about it,\" said Mrs. Prime; \"I only know that\nthey've quarrelled.\"\n\n\"But it would be well that you should learn, because I'm sure you\nwill be glad to think as well of your brother-in-law as possible.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he is engaged to marry Rachel?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dorothea. I think we may say that it is all settled\nnow;--mayn't we, Rachel? And a very excellent young man he is,--and\nas for being well off, a great deal better than what a child of mine\ncould have expected. And a fine comely fellow he is, as a woman's eye\nwould wish to rest on.\"\n\n\"Beauty is but skin deep,\" said Mrs. Prime, with no little\nindignation in her tone, that a thing so vile as personal comeliness\nshould have been mentioned by her mother on such an occasion.\n\n\"When he came out here and drank tea with us that evening,\" continued\nMrs. Ray, \"I took a liking to him most unaccountable, unless it was\nthat I had a foreshadowing that he was going to be so near and dear\nto me.\"\n\n\"Mother, there can have been nothing of the kind. You should not say\nsuch things. The Lord in his providence allows us no foreshadowing of\nthat kind.\"\n\n\"At any rate I liked him very much; didn't I, Rachel?--from the first\nmoment I set eyes on him. Only I don't think he'll ever do away with\ncider in Devonshire, because of the apple trees. But if people are\nto drink beer it stands to reason that good beer will be better than\nbad.\"\n\nAll this time Rachel had not spoken a word, nor had her sister\nuttered anything expressive of congratulation or good wishes. Now,\nas Mrs. Ray ceased, there came a silence in the room, and it was\nincumbent on the elder sister to break it.\n\n\"If this matter is settled, Rachel--\"\n\n\"It is settled,--I think,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"If it is settled I hope that it may be for your lasting happiness\nand eternal welfare.\"\n\n\"I hope it will,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"Marriage is a most important step.\"\n\n\"That's quite true, my dear,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"A most important step, and one that requires the most exact\ncircumspection,--especially on the part of the young woman. I hope\nyou may have known Mr. Rowan long enough to justify your confidence\nin him.\"\n\nIt was still the voice of a raven! Mrs. Prime as she spoke thus\nknew that she was croaking, and would have divested herself of her\ncroak and spoken joyously, had such mode of speech been possible\nto her. But it was not possible. Though she would permit no such\nforeshadowings as those at which her mother had hinted, she had\ncommitted herself to forebodings against this young man, to such\nextent that she could not wheel her thoughts round and suddenly think\nwell of him. She could not do so as yet, but she would make the\nstruggle.\n\n\"God bless you, Rachel!\" she said, when they parted for the night.\n\"You have my best wishes for your happiness. I hope you do not doubt\nmy love because I think more of your welfare in another world than in\nthis.\" Then she kissed her sister and they parted for the night.\n\nRachel now shared her mother's room; and from her mother, when they\nwere alone together, she received abundance of that sympathy for\nwhich her heart was craving.\n\n\"You mustn't mind Dorothea,\" the widow said.\n\n\"No, mamma; I do not.\"\n\n\"I mean that you mustn't mind her seeming to be so hard. She means\nwell through it all, and is as affectionate as any other woman.\"\n\n\"Why did she say that he had been dismissed when she knew that it\nwasn't true?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear! can't you understand? When she first heard of Mr.\nRowan--\"\n\n\"Call him Luke, mamma.\"\n\n\"When she first heard of him she was taught to believe that he was\ngiddy, and that he didn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Why should she think evil of people? Who taught her?\"\n\n\"Miss Pucker, and Mr. Prong, and that set.\"\n\n\"Yes; and they are the people who talk most of Christian charity!\"\n\n\"But, my dear, they don't mean to be uncharitable. They try to do\ngood. If Dorothea really thought that this young man was a dangerous\nacquaintance what could she do but say so? And you can't expect\nher to turn round all in a minute. Think how she has been troubled\nherself about this affair of Mr. Prong's.\"\n\n\"But that's no reason she should say that Luke is dangerous.\nDangerous! What makes me so angry is that she should think everybody\nis a fool except herself. Why should anybody be more dangerous to me\nthan to anybody else?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I think that perhaps she is not so wrong there. Of\ncourse everything is all right with you now, and I'm sure I'm the\nhappiest woman in the world to feel that it is so. I don't know how\nto be thankful enough when I think how things have turned out;--but\nwhen I first heard of him I thought he was dangerous too.\"\n\n\"But you don't think he is dangerous now, mamma?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; of course I don't. And I never did after he drank tea\nhere that night; only Mr. Comfort told me it wouldn't be safe not to\nsee how things went a little before you,--you understand, dearest?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand. I ain't a bit obliged to Mr. Comfort, though I\nmean to forgive him because of Mrs. Cornbury. She has behaved best\nthrough it all,--next to you, mamma.\"\n\nI am afraid it was late before Mrs. Ray went to sleep that night, and\nI almost doubt whether Rachel slept at all. It seemed to her that in\nthe present condition of her life sleep could hardly be necessary.\nDuring the last month past she had envied those who slept while she\nwas kept awake by her sorrow. She had often struggled to sleep as she\nsat in her chair, so that she might escape for a few moments from the\ntorture of her waking thoughts. But why need she sleep now that every\nthought was a new pleasure? There was no moment that she had ever\npassed with him that had not to be recalled. There was no word of his\nthat had not to be re-weighed. She remembered, or fancied that she\nremembered, her idea of the man when her eye first fell upon his\noutside form. She would have sworn that her first glance of him had\nconveyed to her far more than had ever come to her from many a day's\ncasual looking at any other man. She could almost believe that he had\nbeen specially made and destined for her behoof. She blushed even\nwhile lying in bed as she remembered how the gait of the man, and the\ntone of his voice, had taken possession of her eyes and ears from\nthe first day on which she had met him. When she had gone to Mrs.\nTappitt's party, so consciously alive to the fact that he was to be\nthere, she had told herself that she was sure she thought no more of\nhim than of any other man that she might meet; but she now declared\nto herself that she had been a weak fool in thus attempting to\ndeceive herself; that she had loved him from the first,--or at any\nrate from that evening when he had told her of the beauty of the\nclouds; and that from that day to the present hour there had been no\nother chance of happiness to her but that chance which had now been\nso wondrously decided in her favour. When she came down to breakfast\non the next morning she was very quiet,--so quiet that her sister\nalmost thought she was frightened at her future prospects; but I\nthink that there was no such fear. She was so happy that she could\nafford to be tranquil in her happiness.\n\nOn that day Rowan came out to the cottage in the evening and was\nformally introduced to Mrs. Prime. Mrs. Ray, I fear, did not find the\nlittle tea-party so agreeable on that evening as she had done on the\nprevious occasion. Mrs. Prime did make some effort at conversation;\nshe did endeavour to receive the young man as her future\nbrother-in-law; she was gracious to him with such graciousness as she\npossessed;--but the duration of their meal was terribly long, and\neven Mrs. Ray herself felt relieved when the two lovers went forth\ntogether for their evening walk. I think there must have been some\ntriumph in Rachel's heart as she tied on her hat before she started.\nI think she must have remembered the evening on which her sister had\nbeen so urgent with her to go to the Dorcas meeting;--when she had so\nobstinately refused that invitation, and had instead gone out to meet\nthe Tappitt girls, and had met with them the young man of whom her\nsister had before been speaking with so much horror. Now he was there\non purpose to take her with him, and she went forth with him, leaning\nlovingly on his arm, while yet close under her sister's eyes. I think\nthere must have been a gleam of triumph in her face as she put her\nhand with such confidence well round her lover's arm.\n\nGirls do triumph in their lovers,--in their acknowledged and\npermitted lovers, as young men triumph in their loves which are not\nacknowledged or perhaps permitted. A man's triumph is for the most\npart over when he is once allowed to take his place at the family\ntable, as a right, next to his betrothed. He begins to feel himself\nto be a sacrificial victim,--done up very prettily with blue\nand white ribbons round his horns, but still an ox prepared for\nsacrifice. But the girl feels herself to be exalted for those few\nweeks as a conqueror, and to be carried along in an ovation of which\nthat bucolic victim, tied round with blue ribbons on to his horns,\nis the chief grace and ornament. In this mood, no doubt, both Rachel\nand Luke Rowan went forth, leaving the two widows together in the\ncottage.\n\n\"It is pretty to see her so happy, isn't it now?\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\nThe question for the moment made Mrs. Prime uncomfortable and almost\nwretched, but it gave her the opportunity which in her heart she\ndesired of recanting her error in regard to Luke Rowan's character.\nShe wished to give in her adhesion to the marriage,--to be known to\nhave acknowledged its fitness so that she could, with some true word\nof sisterly love, wish her sister well. In Rachel's presence she\ncould not have first made this recantation. Though Rachel spoke no\ntriumph, there was a triumph in her eye, which prevented almost the\npossibility of such yielding on the part of Dorothea. But when the\nthing should have been once done, when she should once have owned\nthat Rachel was not wrong, then gradually she could bring herself\nround to the utterance of some kindly expression.\n\n\"Pretty,\" she said; \"yes, it is pretty. I do not know that anybody\never doubted its prettiness.\"\n\n\"And isn't it nice too? Dear girl! It does make me so happy to see\nher light-hearted again. She has had a sad time of it, Dorothea,\nsince we made her write that letter to him; a very sad time of it.\"\n\n\"People here, mother, do mostly have what you call a sad time of it.\nAre we not taught that it is better for us that it should be so? Have\nnot you and I, mother, had a sad time of it? It would be all sad\nenough if this were to be the end of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, just so; of course we know that. But it can't be wrong that she\nshould be happy now, when things are so bright all around her. You\nwouldn't have thought it better for her, or for him either, that they\nshould be kept apart, seeing that they really love each other?\"\n\n\"No; I don't say that. If they love one another of course it is right\nthat they should marry. I only wish we had known him longer.\"\n\n\"I am not sure that these things always go much better because young\npeople have known each other all their lives. It seems to be certain\nthat he is an industrious, steady young man. Everybody seems to speak\nwell of him now.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, I have nothing to say against him,--not a word. And\nif it will give Rachel any pleasure,--though I don't suppose it will,\nthe least in the world; but if it would, she may know that I think\nshe has done wisely to accept him.\"\n\n\"Indeed it will; the greatest pleasure.\"\n\n\"And I hope they will be happy together for very many years. I love\nRachel dearly, though I fear she does not think so, and anything I\nhave said, I have said in love, not in anger.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that, Dorothea.\"\n\n\"Now that she is to be settled in life as a married woman, of course\nshe must not look for counsel either to you or to me. She must obey\nhim, and I hope that God may give him grace to direct her steps\naright.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said Mrs. Ray, solemnly. It was thus that Mrs. Prime read her\nrecantation, which was repeated on that evening to Rachel with some\nlittle softening touches. \"You won't be living together in the same\nhouse after a bit,\" said Mrs. Ray, thinking, with some sadness, that\nthose little evening festivities of buttered toast and thick cream\nwere over for her now,--\"but I do hope you will be friends.\"\n\n\"Of course we will, mamma. She has only to put out her hand the least\nlittle bit in the world, and I will go the rest of the way. As for\nher living, I don't know what will be best about that, because Luke\nsays that of course you'll come and live with us.\"\n\nIt was two or three days after this that Rachel saw the Tappitt girls\nfor the first time since the fact of her engagement had become known.\nIt was in the evening, and she had been again walking with Luke, when\nshe met them; but at that moment she was alone. Augusta would have\nturned boldly away, though they had all come closely together before\neither had been aware of the presence of the other. But to this both\nMartha and Cherry objected.\n\n\"We have heard of your engagement,\" said Martha, \"and we congratulate\nyou. You have heard, of course, that we are going to move to Torquay,\nand we hope that you will be comfortable at the brewery.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Augusta, \"the place isn't what it used to be, and so\nwe think it best to go. Mamma has already looked at a villa near\nTorquay, which will suit us delightfully.\"\n\nThen they passed on, but Cherry remained behind to say another word.\n\"I am so happy,\" said Cherry, \"that you and he have hit it off. He's\na charming fellow, and I always said he was to fall in love with you.\nAfter the ball of course there wasn't a doubt about it. Mind you send\nus cake, dear; and by-and-by we'll come and see you at the old place,\nand be better friends than ever we were.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nEarly in November Mr. Tappitt officially announced his intention\nof abdicating, and the necessary forms and deeds and parchment\nobligations were drawn out, signed and sealed, for the giving\nup of the brewery to Luke Rowan. Mr. Honyman's clerk revelled in\nthinly-covered folio sheets to the great comfort and profit of his\nmaster; while Mr. Sharpit went about Baslehurst declaring that\nTappitt was an egregious ass, and hinting that Rowan was little\nbetter than a clever swindler. What he said, however, had but little\neffect on Baslehurst. It had become generally understood that Rowan\nwould spend money in the town, employing labour and struggling to\ngo ahead, and Baslehurst knew that such a man was desirable as a\ncitizen. The parchments were prepared, and the signatures were\nwritten with the necessary amount of witnessing, and Tappitt and\nRowan once more met each other on friendly terms. Tappitt had\nendeavoured to avoid this, pleading, both to Honyman and to his wife,\nthat his personal dislike to the young man was as great as ever; but\nthey had not permitted him thus to indulge his wrath. Mr. Honyman\npointed out to Mrs. Tappitt that such ill-humour might be very\ndetrimental to their future interests, and Tappitt had been made to\ngive way. We may as well declare at once that the days of Tappitt's\ndomestic dominion were over, as is generally the case with a man who\nretires from work and allows himself to be placed, as a piece of\nvenerable furniture, in the chimney corner. Hitherto he, and he only,\nhad known what funds could be made available out of the brewery for\nhousehold purposes; and Mrs. Tappitt had been subject, at every turn\nof her life, to provoking intimations of reduced profits: but now\nthere was the clear thousand a year, and she could demand her rights\nin accordance with that sum. Tappitt, too, could never again stray\naway from home with mysterious hints that matters connected with malt\nand hops must be discussed at places in which beer was consumed. He\nhad no longer left to him any excuse for deviating from the regular\ncourse of his life even by a hair's breadth; and before two years\nwere over he had learned to regard it almost as a favour to be\nallowed to take a walk with one of his own girls. No man should\nabdicate,--unless, indeed, he does so for his soul's advantage. As to\nhappiness in this life it is hardly compatible with that diminished\nrespect which ever attends the relinquishing of labour. Otium cum\ndignitate is a dream. There is no such position at any rate for\nthe man who has once worked. He may have the ease or he may have\nthe dignity; but he can hardly combine the two. This truth the\nunfortunate Tappitt learned before he had been three months settled\nin the Torquay villa.\n\nHe was called upon to meet Rowan on friendly terms, and he obeyed.\nThe friendship was not very cordial, but such as it was it served its\npurpose. The meeting took place in the dining-room of the brewery,\nand Mrs. Tappitt was present on the occasion. The lady received her\nvisitor with some little affectation of grandeur, while T., standing\nwith his hands in his pockets on his own rug, looked like a whipped\nhound. The right hand he was soon forced to bring forth, as Rowan\ndemanded it that he might shake it.\n\n\"I am very glad that this affair has been settled between us\namicably,\" said Luke, while he still held the hand of the abdicating\nbrewer.\n\n\"Yes; well, I suppose it's for the best,\" said Tappitt, bringing out\nhis words uncomfortably and with hesitation. \"Take care and mind what\nyou're about, or I suppose I shall have to come back again.\"\n\n\"There'll be no fear of that, I think,\" said Rowan.\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Mrs. Tappitt, with a tone that showed that she\nwas much better able to master the occasion than her husband. \"I\nhope not; but this is a great undertaking for so young a man, and I\ntrust you feel your responsibility. It would be disagreeable to us,\nof course, to have to return to the brewery after having settled\nourselves pleasantly at Torquay; but we shall have to do so if things\ngo wrong with you.\"\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Mrs. Tappitt; you shall never have to come back\nhere.\"\n\n\"I hope not; but it is always well to be on one's guard. I am\nsure you must be aware that Mr. Tappitt has behaved to you very\ngenerously; and if you have the high principle for which we are\nwilling to give you credit, and which you ought to possess for the\nmanagement of such an undertaking as the brewery, you will be careful\nthat me and my daughters shan't be put to inconvenience by any delay\nin paying up the income regularly.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid about that, Mrs. Tappitt.\"\n\n\"Into the bank on quarter day, if you please, Mr. Rowan. Short\naccounts make long friends. And as Mr. T. won't want to be troubled\nwith letters and such-like, you can send me a line to Montpellier\nVilla, Torquay, just to say that it's done.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll see to that,\" said Tappitt.\n\n\"My dear, as Mr. Rowan is so young for the business there'll be\nnothing like getting him to write a letter himself, saying that the\nmoney is paid. It'll keep him up to the mark like, and I'm sure I\nshan't mind the trouble.\"\n\n\"Don't you be alarmed about the money, Mrs. Tappitt,\" said Rowan,\nlaughing; \"and in order that you may know how the old shop is going\non, I'll always send you at Christmas sixteen gallons of the best\nstuff we're brewing.\"\n\n\"That will be a very proper little attention, Mr. Rowan, and we shall\nbe happy to drink success to the establishment. Here's some cake and\nwine on the table, and perhaps you'll do us the favour to take a\nglass,--so as to bury any past unkindness. T., my love, will you pour\nout the wine?\"\n\nIt was twelve o'clock in the day, and the port wine, which had been\nstanding for the last week in its decanter, was sipped by Luke Rowan\nwithout any great relish. But it also served its purpose,--and the\nburial service over past unkindness was performed with as much\nheartiness as the nature of the entertainment admitted. It was not\nas yet full four months since Rowan had filled Rachel's glass with\nchampagne in that same room. Then he had made himself quite at home\nin the house as a member of Mr. Tappitt's family; but now he was\ngoing to be at home there as master of the establishment. As he\nput down the glass he could not help looking round the room, and\nsuggesting to himself the changes he would make. As seen at present,\nthe parlour of the brewery was certainly a dull room. It was very\nlong since the wainscoting had been painted, longer since the\ncurtains or carpets had been renewed. It was dark and dingy. But then\nso were the Tappitts themselves. Before Rachel should be brought\nthere he would make the place as bright as herself.\n\nThey said to him no word about his marriage. As for Tappitt he said\nfew words about anything; and Mrs. Tappitt, with all her wish to be\ngracious, could not bring herself to mention Rachel Ray. Even between\nher and her daughters there was no longer any utterance of Rachel's\nname. She had once declared to Augusta, with irrepressible energy,\nthat the man was a greater fool than she had ever believed possible,\nbut after that it had been felt that the calamity would be best\nendured in silence.\n\nWhen that interview in the dining-room was over, Rowan saw no more of\nMrs. Tappitt. Business made it needful that he should be daily about\nthe brewery, and there occasionally he met the poor departing man\nwandering among the vats and empty casks like a brewer's ghost. There\nwas no word spoken between them as to business. The accounts, the\nkeys, and implements were all handed over through Worts; and Rowan\nfound himself in possession of the whole establishment with no more\ntrouble than would have been necessary in settling himself in a new\nlodging.\n\nThat promise which he had half made of sending bridecake to Mrs.\nSturt before Christmas was not kept, but it was broken only by a\nlittle. They were married early in January. In December Mrs. Rowan\ncame back to Baslehurst, and became the guest of her son, who was\nthen keeping a bachelor's house at the brewery. This lady's first\nvisit to the cottage after her return was an affair of great moment\nto Rachel. Everything now had gone well with her except that question\nof her mother-in-law. Her lover had come back to her a better lover\nthan ever; her mother petted her to her heart's content, speaking of\nLuke as though she had never suspected him of lupine propensities;\nMr. Comfort talked to her of her coming marriage as though she had\nacted with great sagacity through the whole affair, addressing her in\na tone indicating much respect, and differing greatly from that in\nwhich he had been wont to catechise her when she was nothing more\nthan Mrs. Ray's girl at Bragg's End; and even Dolly had sent in her\nadhesion, with more or less cordiality. But still she had feared\nMrs. Rowan's enmity, and when Luke told her that his mother was\ncoming to Baslehurst for the Christmas,--so that she might also\nbe present at the marriage,--Rachel felt that there was still a\ncloud in her heavens. \"I know your mother won't like me,\" she said\nto Luke. \"She made up her mind not to like me when she was here\nbefore.\" Luke assured her that she did not understand his mother's\ncharacter,--asserting that his mother would certainly like any woman\nthat he might choose for his wife as soon as she should have been\nmade to understand that his choice was irrevocable. But Rachel\nremembered too well the report as to that former visit to the cottage\nwhich Mrs. Rowan had made together with Mrs. Tappitt; and when she\nheard that Luke's mother was again in the parlour she went down from\nher bedroom with hesitating step and an uneasy heart. Mrs. Rowan was\nseated in the room with her mother and sister when she entered it,\nand therefore the first words of the interview had been already\nspoken. To Mrs. Ray the prospect of the visit had not been pleasant,\nfor she also remembered how grand and distant the lady had been when\nshe came to the cottage on that former occasion; but Rachel observed,\nas she entered the room, that her mother's face did not wear that\nlook of dismay which was usual to her when she was in any presence\nthat was disagreeable to her.\n\n\"My dear child!\" said Mrs. Rowan rising from her seat, and opening\nher arms for an embrace. Rachel underwent the embrace, and kissed the\nlady by whom she found herself to be thus enveloped. She kissed Mrs.\nRowan, but she could not, for the life of her, think of any word to\nspeak which would be fitting for the occasion.\n\n\"My own dear child!\" said Mrs. Rowan again; \"for you know that you\nare to be my child now as well as your own mamma's.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to say so,\" said Mrs. Ray.\n\n\"Very kind, indeed,\" said Mrs. Prime; \"and I'm sure that you will\nfind Rachel dutiful as a daughter.\" Rachel herself did not feel\ndisposed to give any positive assurance on that point. She intended\nto be dutiful to her husband, and was inclined to think that\nobedience in that direction was quite enough for a married woman.\n\n\"Now that Luke is going to settle himself for life,\" continued Mrs.\nRowan, \"it is so very desirable that he should be married at once.\nDon't you think so, Mrs. Ray?\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes, Mrs. Rowan. I always like to hear of young men getting\nmarried; that is when they've got anything to live upon. It makes\nthem less harum-scarum like.\"\n\n\"I don't think Luke was ever what you call harum-scarum,\" said Mrs.\nRowan.\n\n\"Mother didn't mean to say he was,\" said Mrs. Prime; \"but marriage\ncertainly does steady a young man, and generally makes him much more\nconstant at Divine service.\"\n\n\"My Luke always did go to church very regularly,\" said Mrs. Rowan.\n\n\"I like to see young men in church,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"As for the girls\nthey go as a matter of course; but young men are allowed so much of\ntheir own way. When a man is a father of a family it becomes very\ndifferent.\" Hereupon Rachel blushed, and then was kissed again by\nLuke's mother; and was made the subject of certain very interesting\nprophecies, which embarrassed her considerably and which need not be\nrepeated here. After that interview she was never again afraid of her\nmother-in-law.\n\n\"You'll love mamma, when you know her,\" said Mary Rowan to Rachel a\nday or two afterwards. \"Strangers and acquaintances generally think\nthat she is a very tremendous personage, but she always does what she\nis asked by those who belong to her;--and as for Luke, she's almost\na slave to him.\" I won't say that Rachel resolved that Mrs. Rowan\nshould be a slave to her also, but she did resolve that she would\nnot be a slave to Mrs. Rowan. She intended henceforward to serve one\nperson and one person only.\n\nMrs. Butler Cornbury also called at the cottage; and her visit was\nvery delightful to Rachel,--not the less so perhaps because Mrs.\nPrime was away at a Dorcas meeting. Had she been at the cottage all\nthose pleasant allusions to the transactions at the ball would hardly\nhave been made. \"Don't tell me,\" said Mrs. Cornbury. \"Do you think I\ncouldn't see how it was going to be with half an eye? I told Walter\nthat very night that he was a goose to suppose that you would go down\nto supper with him.\"\n\n\"But, Mrs. Cornbury, I really intended it; only they had another\ndance, and I was obliged to stand up with Mr. Rowan because I was\nengaged to him.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt you were engaged to him, my dear.\"\n\n\"Only for that dance, I mean.\"\n\n\"Only for that dance, of course. But now you are engaged to him for\nsomething else, and I tell you that I knew it was going to be so.\"\n\nAll this was very pretty and very pleasant; and when Mrs. Cornbury,\nas she went away, made a special request that she might be invited to\nthe wedding, Rachel was supremely happy.\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"I do love that woman. I hardly know why, but I do\nlove her so much.\"\n\n\"It was always the same with Patty Comfort,\" said Mrs. Ray. \"She had\na way of making people fond of her. They say that she can do just\nwhat she likes with the old gentleman at the Grange.\"\n\nIt may be well that I should declare here that there was no scrutiny\nas to the return of Butler Cornbury to Parliament,--to the great\nsatisfaction both of old Mr. Cornbury and of old Mr. Comfort. They\nhad been brought to promise that the needful funds for supporting\nthe scrutiny should be forthcoming; but the promise had been made\nwith heavy hearts, and the tidings of Mr. Hart's quiescence had been\nreceived very gratefully both at Cornbury and at Cawston.\n\nLuke and Rachel were married on New Year's Day at Cawston church, and\nafterwards made a short marriage trip to Penzance and the Land's End.\nIt was cold weather for pleasure-travelling; but snow and winds and\nrain affect young married people less, I think, than they do other\nfolk. Rachel when she returned could not bear to be told that it had\nbeen cold. There was no winter, she said, at Penzance,--and so she\ncontinued to say ever afterwards.\n\nMrs. Ray would not consent to abandon the cottage at Bragg's End. She\nstill remained its occupier in conjunction with Mrs. Prime, but she\npassed more than half her time at the brewery. Mrs. Prime is still\nMrs. Prime; and will, I think, remain so, although Mr. Prong is\noccasionally seen to call at the cottage.\n\nIt is, I think, now universally admitted by all Devonshire and\nCornwall that Luke Rowan has succeeded in brewing good beer; with\nwhat results to himself I am not prepared to say. I do not, however,\nthink it probable that he will succeed in his professed object of\nshutting up the apple orchards of the county.\n\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\n   Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\n\n   Volume I, Chapter XII, paragraph 45. \"She had pledged\n   herself to give Mr. Prong an answer on Friday, . . .\"\n   The astute reader will recall from Chapter IX that Mrs.\n   Prime asked Mr. Prong to call on Saturday, while Miss\n   Pucker was shopping, to learn her answer to his proposal.\n\n   Specific changes in wording of the text are listed below.\n\n      Volume I, Chaper VII, paragraph 16. The word \"walks\" was\n      changed to \"walls\" in the sentence: Now the room was\n      partially cleared, the non-dancers being pressed back\n      into a border round the WALLS, and the music began.\n\n      Volume I, Chapter XIV, paragraph 1. \"Excellence\" was\n      changed to \"existence\" in the sentence: In Rachel's\n      presence, and sweet smile, and winning caresses was\n      the chief delight of her EXISTENCE.\n\n      Volume II, Chapter III, paragraph 2. The word \"hopes\" was\n      changed to \"hope\" in the sentence: She told herself that\n      such was her HOPE;. . .\n\n      Volume II, Chapter XI, paragraph 32. \"Dining-room\" was\n      changed to \"drawing-room\" in the sentence beginning: Rowan\n      did not see her till he met her in the DRAWING-ROOM, just\n      before dinner . . .\n\n      Volume II, Chapter XII, paragraph 1. \"Country-house\" was\n      changed to \"counting-house\" in the sentence: He was alone\n      and thoughtful in his COUNTING-HOUSE, or else subjected to\n      the pressure of his wife's arguments in his private dwelling.\n\n      Volume II, Chapter XIII, paragraph 26. \"Wives\" was changed\n      to \"wife\" in the sentence: Nevertheless she carried the\n      tidings up into Baslehurst, and as she repeated it to the\n      grocer's daughters and the baker's WIFE she shook her head\n      with as much apparent satisfaction as though she really\n      believed that Rachel oscillated between a ruined name and a\n      broken heart.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RACHEL RAY***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 34000-8.txt or 34000-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/3\/4\/0\/0\/34000\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":267,"split":"train"}
