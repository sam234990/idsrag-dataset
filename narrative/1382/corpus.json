Contrasting with the opportunism of Transome is the sincere, but opinionated, Radical Felix Holt. A subplot concerns the stepdaughter of a Dissenting minister who is the true heir to the Transome estate, but who is unaware of the fact. She becomes the object of the affections of both Harold Transome and Felix Holt.As the story starts, the reader is introduced to the fictitious community of Treby in the English Midlands in 1832, around the time of the First Reform Act. Harold Transome, a local landowner, has returned home after a fifteen-year trading career in the Far East. Wealthy from trade, he stands for election to Parliament from the county seat of North Loamshire. But contrary to his family's Tory traditions, he intends to stand as a Radical. This alienates him from his traditional allies and causes despair for his mother, Mrs. Transome. Harold Transome gains the support of his Tory uncle, the Rector of Little Treby, and enlists the help of his family lawyer, Matthew Jermyn, as an electioneering agent.\nMuch of his electioneering is focused in Treby Magna. In this village resides Felix Holt, who has recently returned from extensive travels in Glasgow to live with his mother. He meets with Rev. Rufus Lyon, a Dissenting minister in Treby Magna, and his stepdaughter, Esther. Felix and Mr. Lyon become ready friends, but he appears to treat Esther with condescension. Felix and Rev. Lyon both appear aligned to the Radical cause.\nHarold Transome learns that Jermyn has been mismanaging the Transome estate and embezzling money for himself. Transome remains silent during the election, yet Jermyn tries to devise a plan to save himself from future prosecution. Meanwhile, Felix witnesses some electioneering for the Radical cause in the nearby mining town of Sproxton. He is upset with the 'treating' of workers with beer in exchange for their vocal support. Felix relays his concerns to Harold Transome, who chastises John Johnson for his electioneering methods. However, Jermyn convinces Transome not to interfere.\nRev. Lyon learns from Maurice Christian, servant of Philip Debarry, about the possible identity of Esther's biological father. Rev. Lyon decides to tell Esther the truth about her father. Esther's outlook on life changes upon finding that she is in fact Rev. Lyon's stepdaughter. Her relationship with her stepfather deepens, while she also desires to emulate the high moral standards impressed upon her by Felix Holt. Seeing the change in Esther's character, Felix Holt begins to fall in love with her. However, both share the feeling that they are destined never to marry each other. Meanwhile, Rev. Lyon challenges Rev. Augustus Debarry to a theological debate. The debate is initially agreed to, but is cancelled at the last minute.\nRiots erupt on election day in Treby Magna. Drunken mine workers from Sproxton assault townspeople and wantonly destroy property. Felix Holt is caught up in the riots, and tries foolhardily to direct its hostility away from the town. But in the end, Felix Holt is charged with the manslaughter of a constable who tried to break up the riot. Harold Transome also loses the election to Debarry.\nHarold Transome begins legal proceedings against Jermyn for the latter's mismanagement of the Transome estate. Jermyn counters by threatening to publicise the true owner of the Transome estate. However, Maurice Christian informs the Transomes that the true owner of the estate is in fact Esther Lyon. Harold Transome invites her to the Transome estate, hoping to persuade her to marry him. Harold and Esther establish a good rapport, and Esther also becomes more sympathetic with Mrs. Transome, whose despair has continued to deepen. Esther feels torn between Harold Transome and Felix Holt. She compares a life of comfortable wealth with Harold Transome and motherly affection with Mrs. Transome, to a life of personal growth in poverty with Felix Holt. Meanwhile, at Felix Holt's trial, Rev. Lyon, Harold Transome and Esther Lyon all vouch for his character, but he is nevertheless found guilty of manslaughter. However, Harold Transome and the Debarrys manage to have Felix Holt pardoned.\nHarold Transome proposes to Esther Lyon, with the eager support of Mrs. Transome. But despite Esther's feelings towards both Harold and Mrs. Transome, she declines the proposal. In an altercation between Jermyn and Harold Transome, it is revealed that Jermyn is Harold Transome's father. Harold considers he will no longer be suitable for marriage to Esther. Esther also surrenders her claim to the Transome estate. The story ends with Felix Holt and Esther Lyon marrying and moving away from Treby, along with Rev. Lyon. Matthew Jermyn is eventually ruined and moves abroad, while John Johnson remains and prospers as a lawyer. The Debarrys remain friends with the Transomes, and the contest to the Transome estate, while widely known, is never discussed.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Felix Holt, The Radical, by George Eliot\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Posterity may be shot, like a\nbullet through a tube, by atmospheric pressure, from Winchester to\nNewcastle: that is a fine result to have among our hopes; but the slow,\nold fashioned way of getting from one end of our country to the other is\nthe better thing to have in the memory. The tube-journey can never lend\nmuch to picture and narrative; it is as barren as an exclamatory O!\nWhereas, the happy outside passenger, seated on the box from the dawn to\nthe gloaming, gathered enough stories of English life, enough of English\nlabors in town and country, enough aspects of earth and sky, to make\nepisodes for a modern Odyssey. Suppose only that his journey took him\nthrough that central plain, watered at one extremity by the Avon, at the\nother by the Trent. As the morning silvered the meadows with their long\nlines of bushy willows marking the water-courses, or burnished the\ngolden corn-ricks clustered near the long roofs of some midland\nhomestead, he saw the full-uddered cows driven from their pasture to the\nearly milking. Perhaps it was the shepherd, head-servant of the farm,\nwho drove them, his sheep-dog following with a heedless, unofficial air,\nas of a beadle in undress. The shepherd, with a slow and slouching walk,\ntimed by the walk of grazing beasts, moved aside, as if unwillingly,\nthrowing out a monosyllabic hint to his cattle; his glance, accustomed\nto rest on things very near the earth, seemed to lift itself with\ndifficulty to the coachman. Mail or stage coach for him belonged to the\nmysterious distant system of things called \"Gover'ment,\" which, whatever\nit might be, was no business of his, any more than the most outlying\nnebula or the coal-sacks of the southern hemisphere: his solar system\nwas the parish; the master's temper and the casualties of lambing-time\nwere his region of storms. He cut his bread and bacon with his\npocket-knife, and felt no bitterness except in the matter of pauper\nlaborers and the bad-luck that sent contrarious seasons and the\nsheep-rot. He and his cows were soon left behind, and the homestead,\ntoo, with its pond overhung by elder-trees, its untidy kitchen-garden\nand cone-shaped yew-tree arbor. But everywhere the bushy hedgerows\nwasted the land with their straggling beauty, shrouded the grassy\nborders of the pastures with catkined hazels, and tossed their long\nblackberry branches on the corn-fields. Perhaps they were white with\nMay, or starred with pale pink dog-roses; perhaps the urchins were\nalready nutting among them, or gathering the plenteous crabs. It was\nworth the journey only to see those hedgerows, the liberal homes of\nunmarketable beauty--of the purple blossomed, ruby-berried nightshade,\nof the wild convolvulus climbing and spreading in tendriled strength\ntill it made a great curtain of pale-green hearts and white trumpets, of\nthe many-tubed honey-suckle which, in its most delicate fragrance, hid a\ncharm more subtle and penetrating than beauty. Even if it were winter,\nthe hedgerows showed their coral, the scarlet haws, the deep-crimson\nhips, with lingering brown leaves to make a resting-place for the jewels\nof the hoar-frost. Such hedgerows were often as tall as the laborers'\ncottages dotted along the lanes, or clustered into a small hamlet, their\nlittle dingy windows telling, like thick-filmed eyes, of nothing but the\ndarkness within. The passenger on the coach-box, bowled along above\nsuch a hamlet, saw chiefly the roofs of it: probably it turned its back\non the road, and seemed to lie away from everything but its own patch of\nearth and sky, away from the parish church by long fields and green\nlanes, away from all intercourse except that of tramps. If its face\ncould be seen, it was most likely dirty; but the dirt was Protestant\ndirt, and the big, bold, gin-breathing tramps were Protestant tramps.\nThere was no sign of superstition near, no crucifix or image to indicate\na misguided reverence: the inhabitants were probably so free from\nsuperstition that they were in much less awe of the parson than of the\noverseer. Yet they were saved from the excess of Protestantism by not\nknowing how to read, and by the absence of handlooms and mines to be the\npioneers of Dissent: they were kept safely in the _via media_ of\nindifference, and could have registered themselves in the census by a\nbig black mark as members of the Church of England.\n\nBut there were trim cheerful villages too, with a neat or handsome\nparsonage and gray church set in the midst; there was the pleasant\ntinkle of the blacksmith's anvil, the patient cart horses waiting at his\ndoor; the basket-maker peeling his willow wands in the sunshine; the\nwheelwright putting his last touch to a blue cart with red wheels; here\nand there a cottage with bright transparent windows showing pots full of\nblooming balsams or geraniums, and little gardens in front all double\ndaisies or dark wallflowers; at the well, clean and comely women\ncarrying yoked buckets, and toward the free school small Britons\ndawdling on, and handling their marbles in the pockets of unpatched\ncorduroys adorned with brass buttons. The land around was rich and\nmarly, great corn-stacks stood in the rick-yards--for the rick-burners\nhad not found their way hither; the homesteads were those of rich\nfarmers who paid no rent, or had the rare advantage of a lease, and\ncould afford to keep the corn till prices had risen. The coach would be\nsure to overtake some of them on their way to their outlying fields or\nto the market-town, sitting heavily on their well-groomed horses, or\nweighing down one side of an olive-green gig. They probably thought of\nthe coach with some contempt, as an accommodation for people who had not\ntheir own gigs, or who, wanting to travel to London and such distant\nplaces, belonged to the trading and less solid part of the nation. The\npassenger on the box could see that this was the district of protuberant\noptimists, sure that old England was the best of all possible countries,\nand that if there were any facts which had not fallen under their own\nobservation, they were facts not worth observing: the district of clean\nlittle market-towns without manufactures, of fat livings, an\naristocratic clergy, and low poor-rates. But as the day wore on the\nscene would change: the land would begin to be blackened with coal-pits,\nthe rattle of handlooms to be heard in hamlets and villages. Here were\npowerful men walking queerly with knees bent outward from squatting in\nthe mine, going home to throw themselves down in their blackened flannel\nand sleep through the daylight, then rise and spend much of their high\nwages at the ale-house with their fellows of the Benefit Club; here the\npale eager faces of the handloom-weavers, men and women, haggard from\nsitting up late at night to finish the week's work, hardly begun till\nthe Wednesday. Everywhere the cottages and the small children were\ndirty, for the languid mothers gave their strength to the loom; pious\nDissenting women, perhaps, who took life patiently, and thought that\nsalvation depended chiefly on predestination, and not at all on\ncleanliness. The gables of Dissenting chapels now made a visible sign of\nreligion, and of a meeting-place to counterbalance the ale-house, even\nin the hamlets; but if a couple of old termagants were seen tearing each\nother's caps, it was a safe conclusion that, if they had not received\nthe sacraments of the Church, they had not at least given in to\nschismatic rites, and were free from the errors of Voluntaryism. The\nbreath of the manufacturing town, which made a cloudy day and a red\ngloom by night on the horizon, diffused itself over all the surrounding\ncountry, filling the air with eager unrest. Here was a population not\nconvinced that old England was as good as possible; here were\nmultitudinous men and women aware that their religion was not exactly\nthe religion of their rulers, who might therefore be better than they\nwere, and who, if better, might alter many things which now made the\nworld perhaps more painful than it need be, and certainly more sinful.\nYet there were the gray steeples too, and the churchyards, with their\ngrassy mounds and venerable headstones, sleeping in the sunlight; there\nwere broad fields and homesteads, and fine old woods covering a rising\nground, or stretching far by the roadside, allowing only peeps at the\npark and mansion which they shut in from the working-day world. In these\nmidland districts the traveller passed rapidly from one phase of English\nlife to another: after looking down on a village dingy with coal-dust,\nnoisy with the shaking of looms, he might skirt a parish all of fields,\nhigh hedges, and deep rutted lanes; after the coach had rattled over the\npavement of a manufacturing town, the scenes of riots and trades-union\nmeetings, it would take him in another ten minutes into a rural region,\nwhere the neighborhood of the town was only felt in the advantages of a\nnear market for corn, cheese, and hay, and where men with a considerable\nbanking account were accustomed to say that \"they never meddled with\npolitics themselves.\" The busy scenes of the shuttle and the wheel, of\nthe roaring furnace, of the shaft and the pulley, seemed to make but\ncrowded nests in the midst of the large-spaced, slow-moving life of\nhomesteads and far-away cottages and oak-sheltered parks. Looking at the\ndwellings scattered amongst the woody flats and the plowed uplands,\nunder the low gray sky which overhung them with an unchanging stillness\nas if Time itself were pausing, it was easy for the traveller to\nconceive that town and country had no pulse in common, except where the\nhandlooms made a far-reaching straggling fringe about the great centres\nof manufacture; that till the agitation about the Catholics in '29,\nrural Englishmen had hardly known more of Catholics than of the fossil\nmammals; and that their notion of Reform was a confused combination of\nrick-burners, trades-unions, Nottingham riots, and in general whatever\nrequired the calling out of the yeomanry. It was still easier to see\nthat, for the most part, they resisted the rotation of crops and stood\nby their fallows: and the coachman would perhaps tell how in one parish\nan innovating farmer, who talked of Sir Humphrey Davy, had been fairly\ndriven out by popular dislike, as if he had been a confounded Radical;\nand how, the parson having one Sunday preached from the words, \"Break up\nyour fallow-ground,\" the people thought he had made the text out of his\nown head, otherwise it would never have come \"so pat\" on a matter of\nbusiness; but when they found it in the Bible at home, some said it was\nan argument for fallows (else why should the Bible mention fallows?),\nbut a few of the weaker sort were shaken, and thought it was an argument\nthat fallows should be done away with, else the Bible would have said,\n\"Let your fallows lie\"; and the next morning the parson had a stroke of\napoplexy, which, as coincident with a dispute about fallows, so set the\nparish against the innovating farmer and the rotation of crops, that he\ncould stand his ground no longer, and transferred his lease.\n\nThe coachman was an excellent travelling companion and commentator on\nthe landscape: he could tell the names of sites and persons, and explain\nthe meaning of groups, as well as the shade of Virgil in a more\nmemorable journey; he had as many stories about parishes, and the men\nand women in them, as the Wanderer in the \"Excursion,\" only his style\nwas different. His view of life had originally been genial, such as\nbecame a man who was well warmed within and without, and held a position\nof easy, undisputed authority; but the recent initiation of railways had\nembittered him: he now, as in a perpetual vision, saw the ruined country\nstrewn with shattered limbs, and regarded Mr. Huskisson's death as a\nproof of God's anger against Stephenson. \"Why, every inn on the road\nwould be shut up!\" and at that word the coachman looked before him with\nthe blank gaze of one who had driven his coach to the outermost edge of\nthe universe, and saw his leaders plunging into the abyss. Still he\nwould soon relapse from the high prophetic strain to the familiar one of\nnarrative. He knew whose the land was wherever he drove; what noblemen\nhad half-ruined themselves by gambling; who made handsome returns of\nrent; and who was at daggers-drawn with his eldest son. He perhaps\nremembered the fathers of actual baronets, and knew stories of their\nextravagant or stingy housekeeping; whom they had married, whom they had\nhorsewhipped, whether they were particular about preserving their game,\nand whether they had had much to do with canal companies. About any\nactual landed proprietor he could also tell whether he was a Reformer or\nan Anti-Reformer. That was a distinction which had \"turned up\" in latter\ntimes, and along with it the paradox, very puzzling to the coachman's\nmind, that there were men of old family and large estate who voted for\nthe Bill. He did not grapple with the paradox; he let it pass, with all\nthe discreetness of an experienced theologian or learned scholiast,\npreferring to point his whip at some object which could raise no\nquestions.\n\nNo such paradox troubled our coachman when, leaving the town of Treby\nMagna behind him, he drove between the hedges for a mile or so, crossed\nthe queer long bridge over the river Lapp, and then put his horses to a\nswift gallop up the hill by the low-nestled village of Little Treby,\ntill they were on the fine level road, skirted on one side by grand\nlarches, oaks, and wych elms, which sometimes opened so far as to let\nthe traveller see that there was a park behind them.\n\nHow many times in the year, as the coach rolled past the\nneglected-looking lodges which interrupted the screen of trees, and\nshowed the river winding through a finely-timbered park, had the\ncoachman answered the same questions, or told the same things without\nbeing questioned! That?--oh, that was Transome Court, a place there had\nbeen a fine sight of lawsuits about. Generations back, the heir of the\nTransome name had somehow bargained away the estate, and it fell to the\nDurfeys, very distant connections, who only called themselves Transomes\nbecause they had got the estate. But the Durfeys' claim had been\ndisputed over and over again; and the coachman, if he had been asked,\nwould have said, though he might have to fall down dead the next minute,\nthat property didn't always get into the right hands. However, the\nlawyers had found their luck in it; and people who inherited estates\nthat were lawed about often lived in them as poorly as a mouse in a\nhollow cheese; and, by what he could make out, that had been the way\nwith these present Durfeys, or Transomes, as they called themselves. As\nfor Mr. Transome, he was as poor, half-witted a fellow as you'd wish to\nsee; but _she_ was master, had come of a high family, and had a\nspirit--you might see it in her eye and the way she sat her horse. Forty\nyears ago, when she came into this country, they said she was a pictur';\nbut her family was poor, and so she took up with a hatchet-faced fellow\nlike this Transome. And the eldest son had been just such another as his\nfather, only worse--a wild sort of half-natural, who got into bad\ncompany. They said his mother hated him and wished him dead; for she'd\ngot another son, quite of a different cut, who had gone to foreign parts\nwhen he was a youngster, and she wanted her favorite to be heir. But\nheir or no heir, Lawyer Jermyn had had _his_ picking out of the estate.\nNot a door in his big house but what was the finest polished oak, all\ngot off the Transome estate. If anybody liked to believe he paid for it,\nthey were welcome. However, Lawyer Jermyn had sat on that box-seat many\nand many a time. He had made the wills of most people thereabout. The\ncoachman would not say that Lawyer Jermyn was not the man he would\nchoose to make his own will some day. It was not so well for a lawyer to\nbe over-honest, else he might not be up to other people's tricks. And as\nfor the Transome business, there had been ins and outs in time gone by,\nso that you couldn't look into it straight backward. At this Mr. Sampson\n(everybody in North Loamshire knew Sampson's coach) would screw his\nfeatures into a grimace expressive of entire neutrality, and appear to\naim his whip at a particular spot on the horse's flank. If the passenger\nwas curious for further knowledge concerning the Transome affairs,\nSampson would shake his head and say there had been fine stories in his\ntime; but he never condescended to state what the stories were. Some\nattributed this reticence to a wise incredulity, others to a want of\nmemory, others to simple ignorance. But at least Sampson was right in\nsaying that there had been fine stories--meaning, ironically, stories\nnot altogether creditable to the parties concerned.\n\nAnd such stories often come to be fine in a sense that is not ironical.\nFor there is seldom any wrong-doing which does not carry along with it\nsome downfall of blindly-climbing hopes, some hard entail of suffering,\nsome quickly-satiated desire that survives, with the life in death of\nold paralytic vice, to see itself cursed by its woeful progeny--some\ntragic mark of kinship in the one brief life to the far-stretching life\nthat went before, and to the life that is to come after, such as has\nraised the pity and terror of men ever since they began to discern\nbetween will and destiny. But these things are often unknown to the\nworld; for there is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations\nthat make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying\nexistence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of\nmurder; robberies that leave man or woman forever beggared of peace and\njoy, yet kept secret by the sufferer--committed to no sound except that\nof low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the\nface by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears.\nMany an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into\nno human ear.\n\nThe poets have told us of a dolorous enchanted forest in the under\nworld. The thorn-bushes there, and the thick-barked stems, have human\nhistories hidden in them; the power of unuttered cries dwells in the\npassionless-seeming branches, and the red warm blood is darkly feeding\nthe quivering nerves of a sleepless memory that watches through all\ndreams. These things are a parable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n    He left me when the down upon his lip\n    Lay like the shadow of a hovering kiss.\n    \"Beautiful mother, do not grieve,\" he said;\n    \"I will be great, and build our fortunes high.\n    And you shall wear the longest train at court,\n    And look so queenly, all the lords shall say,\n    'She is a royal changeling: there is some crown\n    Lacks the right head, since hers wears naught but braids.'\"\n    O, he is coming now--but I am gray:\n    And he----\n\n\nOn the first of September, in the memorable year 1832, some one was\nexpected at Transome Court. As early as two o'clock in the afternoon the\naged lodge-keeper had opened the heavy gate, green as the tree trunks\nwere green with nature's powdery paint, deposited year after year.\nAlready in the village of Little Treby, which lay on the side of a steep\nhill not far off the lodge-gates, the elder matrons sat in their best\ngowns at the few cottage doors bordering the road, that they might be\nready to get up and make their courtesy when a travelling carriage\nshould come in sight; and beyond the village several small boys were\nstationed on the look-out, intending to run a race to the barn-like old\nchurch, where the sexton waited in the belfry ready to set the one bell\nin joyful agitation just at the right moment.\n\nThe old lodge-keeper had opened the gate and left it in the charge of\nhis lame wife, because he was wanted at the Court to sweep away the\nleaves, and perhaps to help in the stables. For though Transome Court\nwas a large mansion, built in the fashion of Queen Anne's time, with a\npark and grounds as fine as any to be seen in Loamshire, there were very\nfew servants about it. Especially, it seemed, there must be a lack of\ngardeners; for, except on the terrace surrounded with a stone parapet in\nfront of the house, where there was a parterre, kept with some neatness,\ngrass had spread itself over the gravel walks, and over all the low\nmounds once carefully cut as black beds for the shrubs and larger\nplants. Many of the windows had the shutters closed, and under the grand\nScotch fir that stooped toward one corner, the brown fir-needles of many\nyears lay in a small stone balcony in front of two such darkened\nwindows. All round, both near and far, there were grand trees,\nmotionless in the still sunshine, and, like all large motionless things,\nseemed to add to the stillness. Here and there a leaf fluttered down;\npetals fell in a silent shower; a heavy moth fluttered by, and, when it\nsettled, seemed to fall wearily; the tiny birds alighted on the walks,\nand hopped about in perfect tranquillity; even a stray rabbit sat\nnibbling a leaf that was to its liking, in the middle of a grassy space,\nwith an air that seemed quite impudent in so timid a creature. No sound\nwas to be heard louder than a sleepy hum, and the soft monotony of\nrunning water hurrying on to the river that divided the park. Standing\non the south or east side of the house, you would never have guessed\nthat an arrival was expected.\n\nBut on the west side, where the carriage entrance was, the gates under\nthe stone archway were thrown open; and so was the double door of the\nentrance-hall, letting in the warm light on the scagliola pillars, the\nmarble statues, and the broad stone staircase, with its matting worn\ninto large holes. And, stronger sign of expectation than all, from one\nof the doors that surrounded the entrance-hall, there came forth from\ntime to time a lady, who walked lightly over the polished stone floor,\nand stood on the door-steps and watched and listened. She walked\nlightly, for her figure was slim and finely formed, though she was\nbetween fifty and sixty. She was a tall, proud-looking woman, with\nabundant gray hair, dark eyes and eyebrows, and a somewhat eagle-like\nyet not unfeminine face. Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn;\nthe fine lace of her cuffs and collar, and of the small veil that fell\nbackward over her high comb, was visibly mended; but rare jewels flashed\non her hands, which lay on her folded black-clad arms like finely-cut\nonyx cameos.\n\nMeantime Mrs. Transome went to the door-steps, watching and listening in\nvain. Each time she returned to the same room; it was a moderate-sized\ncomfortable room, with low ebony bookshelves round it, and it formed an\nante-room to a large library, of which a glimpse could be seen through\nan open doorway, partly obstructed by a heavy tapestry curtain drawn on\none side. There was a great deal of tarnished gilding and dinginess on\nthe walls and furniture of this smaller room, but the pictures above the\nbookcases were all of a cheerful kind: portraits in pastel of\npearly-skinned ladies with hair-powder, blue ribbons, and low bodices; a\nsplendid portrait in oils of a Transome in the gorgeous dress of the\nRestoration; another of a Transome in his boyhood, with his hand on the\nneck of a small pony; and a large Flemish battle-piece, where war seemed\nonly a picturesque blue-and-red accident in a vast sunny expanse of\nplain and sky. Probably such cheerful pictures had been chosen because\nthis was Mrs. Transome's usual sitting-room: it was certainly for this\nreason that, near the chair in which she seated herself each time she\nre-entered, there hung a picture of a youthful face which bore a strong\nresemblance to her own: a beardless but masculine face, with rich brown\nhair hanging low on the forehead, and undulating beside each cheek down\nto the loose white cravat. Near this same chair were her writing table,\nwith vellum-covered account-books on it, the cabinet in which she kept\nher neatly-arranged drugs, her basket for her embroidery, a folio volume\nof architectural engravings from which she took her embroidery-patterns,\na number of the \"North Loamshire Herald,\" and the cushion for her fat\nBlenheim, which was too old and sleepy to notice its mistress's\nrestlessness. For, just now, Mrs. Transome could not abridge the sunny\ntedium of the day by the feeble interest of her usual indoor\noccupations. Her consciousness was absorbed by memories and prospects,\nand except that she walked to the entrance-door to look out, she sat\nmotionless with folded arms, involuntarily from time to time turning\ntoward the portrait close by her, and as often, when its young brown\neyes met hers, turning away again with self-checking resolution.\n\nAt last, prompted by some sudden thought or by some sound, she rose and\nwent hastily beyond the tapestry curtain into the library. She paused\nnear the door without speaking: apparently she only wished to see that\nno harm was being done. A man nearer seventy than sixty was in the act\nof ranging on a large library-table a series of shallow drawers, some of\nthem containing dried insects, others mineralogical specimens. His pale\nmild eyes, receding lower jaw, and slight frame, could never have\nexpressed much vigor, either bodily or mental; but he had now the\nunevenness of gait and feebleness of gesture which tell of a past\nparalytic seizure. His threadbare clothes were thoroughly brushed: his\nsoft white hair was carefully parted and arranged: he was not a\nneglected-looking old man; and at his side a fine black retriever, also\nold, sat on its haunches, and watched him as he went to and fro. But\nwhen Mrs. Transome appeared within the doorway, her husband paused in\nhis work and shrank like a timid animal looked at in a cage where flight\nwas impossible. He was conscious of a troublesome intention, for which\nhe had been rebuked before--that of disturbing all his specimens with a\nview to a new arrangement.\n\nAfter an interval, in which his wife stood perfectly still, observing\nhim, he began to put back the drawers in their places in the row of\ncabinets which extended under the bookshelves at one end of the\nlibrary. When they were all put back and closed, Mrs. Transome turned\naway, and the frightened old man seated himself with Nimrod the\nretriever on an ottoman. Peeping at him again, a few minutes after, she\nsaw that he had his arm round Nimrod's neck, and was uttering his\nthoughts to the dog in a loud whisper, as little children do to any\nobject near them when they believe themselves unwatched.\n\nAt last the sound of the church-bell reached Mrs. Transome's ear, and\nshe knew that before long the sound of wheels must be within hearing;\nbut she did not at once start up and walk to the entrance-door. She sat\nstill, quivering and listening; her lips became pale, her hands were\ncold and trembling. Was her son really coming? She was far beyond fifty;\nand since her early gladness in this best-loved boy, the harvest of her\nlife had been scanty. Could it be that now--when her hair was gray, when\nsight had become one of the day's fatigues, when her young\naccomplishments seemed almost ludicrous, like the tone of her first\nharpsichord and the words of the song long browned with age--she was\ngoing to reap an assured joy? to feel that the doubtful deeds of her\nlife were justified by the result, since a kind Providence had\nsanctioned them?--to be no longer tacitly pitied by her neighbors for\nher lack of money, her imbecile husband, her graceless eldest-born, and\nthe loneliness of her life; but to have at her side a rich, clever,\npossibly a tender, son? Yes; but there were the fifteen years of\nseparation, and all that had happened in that long time to throw her\ninto the background of her son's memory and affection. And yet--did not\nmen sometimes become more filial in their feeling when experience had\nmellowed them, and they had themselves become fathers? Still, if Mrs.\nTransome had expected only her son, she would have trembled less; she\nexpected a little grandson also: and there were reasons why she had not\nbeen enraptured when her son had written to her only when he was on the\neve of returning that he already had an heir born to him.\n\nBut the facts must be accepted as they stood, and, after all, the chief\nthing was to have her son back again. Such pride, such affection, such\nhopes as she cherished in this fifty-sixth year of her life, must find\ntheir gratification in him--or nowhere. Once more she glanced at the\nportrait. The young brown eyes seemed to dwell on her pleasantly; but,\nturning from it with a sort of impatience, and saying aloud, \"Of course\nhe will be altered!\" she rose almost with difficulty, and walked more\nslowly than before across the hall to the entrance-door.\n\nAlready the sound of wheels was loud upon the gravel. The momentary\nsurprise of seeing that it was only a post-chaise, without a servant or\nmuch luggage, that was passing under the stone archway and then wheeling\nround against the flight of stone steps, was at once merged in the sense\nthat there was a dark face under a red travelling-cap looking at her\nfrom the window. She saw nothing else; she was not even conscious that\nthe small group of her own servants had mustered, or that old Hickes the\nbutler had come forward to open the chaise door. She heard herself\ncalled \"Mother!\" and felt a light kiss on each cheek; but stronger than\nall that sensation was the consciousness which no previous thought could\nprepare her for, that this son who had come back to her was a stranger.\nThree minutes before, she had fancied that, in spite of all changes\nwrought by fifteen years of separation, she should clasp her son again\nas she had done at their parting; but in the moment when their eyes met,\nthe sense of strangeness came upon her like a terror. It was not hard to\nunderstand that she was agitated, and the son led her across the hall to\nthe sitting-room, closing the door behind them. Then he turned toward\nher and said, smiling--\n\n\"You would not have known me, eh, mother?\"\n\nIt was perhaps the truth. If she had seen him in a crowd, she might have\nlooked at him without recognition--not, however, without startled\nwonder; for though the likeness to herself was no longer striking, the\nyears had overlaid it with another likeness which would have arrested\nher. Before she answered him, his eyes, with a keen restlessness, as\nunlike as possible to the lingering gaze of the portrait, had travelled\nquickly over the room, alighting on her as she said--\n\n\"Everything is changed, Harold. I am an old woman, you see.\"\n\n\"But straighter and more upright than some of the young ones!\" said\nHarold; inwardly, however, feeling that age had made his mother's face\nvery anxious and eager. \"The old women at Smyrna are like sacks. You've\nnot got clumsy and shapeless. How is it I have the trick of getting\nfat?\" (Here Harold lifted his arm and spread out his plump hand.) \"I\nremember my father was as thin as a herring. How is my father? Where is\nhe?\"\n\nMrs. Transome just pointed to the curtained doorway, and let her son\npass through it alone. She was not given to tears: but now, under the\npressure of emotion that could find no other vent, they burst forth. She\ntook care that they should be silent tears, and before Harold came out\nof the library again they were dried. Mrs. Transome had not the feminine\ntendency to seek influence through pathos; she had been used to rule in\nvirtue of acknowledged superiority. The consciousness that she had to\nmake her son's acquaintance, and that her knowledge of the youth of\nnineteen might help her little in interpreting the man of thirty-four,\nhad fallen like lead on her soul; but in this new acquaintance of theirs\nshe cared especially that her son, who had seen a strange world, should\nfeel that he was come home to a mother who was to be consulted on all\nthings, and who could supply his lack of the local experience necessary\nto an English landholder. Her part in life had been that of the clever\nsinner, and she was equipped with the views, the reasons, and the habits\nwhich belonged to that character; life would have little meaning for her\nif she were to be gently thrust aside as a harmless elderly woman. And\nbesides, there were secrets which her son must never know. So, by the\ntime Harold came from the library again, the traces of tears were not\ndiscernible, except to a very careful observer. And he did not observe\nhis mother carefully; his eyes only glanced at her on their way to the\n_North Loamshire Herald_, lying on the table near her, which he took up\nwith his left hand, as he said--\n\n\"Gad! what a wreck poor father is! Paralysis, eh? Terribly shrunk and\nshaken--crawls about among his books and beetles as usual, though. Well,\nit's a slow and easy death. But he's not much over sixty-five, is he?\"\n\n\"Sixty-seven, counting by birthdays; but your father was born old, I\nthink,\" said Mrs. Transome, a little flushed with the determination not\nto show any unasked for feeling. Her son did not notice her. All the\ntime he had been speaking his eyes had been running down the columns of\nthe newspaper.\n\n\"But your little boy, Harold--where is he? How is it he has not come\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I left him behind, in town,\" said Harold, still looking at the\npaper. \"My man Dominic will bring him, with the rest of the luggage. Ah,\nI see it is young Debarry, and not my old friend Sir Maximus, who is\noffering himself as candidate for North Loamshire.\"\n\n\"Yes. You did not answer me when I wrote to you to London about your\nstanding. There is no other Tory candidate spoken of, and you would\nhave all the Debarry interest.\"\n\n\"I hardly think that,\" said Harold, significantly.\n\n\"Why? Jermyn says a Tory candidate can never be got in without it.\"\n\n\"But I shall not be a Tory candidate.\"\n\nMrs. Transome felt something like an electric shock.\n\n\"What then?\" she said, almost sharply. \"You will not call yourself a\nWhig?\"\n\n\"God forbid! I'm a Radical.\"\n\nMrs. Transome's limbs tottered; she sank into a chair. Here was a\ndistinct confirmation of the vague but strong feeling that her son was a\nstranger to her. Here was a revelation to which it seemed almost as\nimpossible to adjust her hopes and notions of a dignified life as if her\nson had said that he had been converted to Mahometanism at Smyrna, and\nhad four wives, instead of one son, shortly to arrive under the care of\nDominic. For the moment she had a sickening feeling that it was of no\nuse that the long-delayed good fortune had come at last--all of no use\nthough the unloved Durfey was dead and buried, and though Harold had\ncome home with plenty of money. There were rich Radicals, she was aware,\nas there were rich Jews and Dissenters, but she had never thought of\nthem as county people. Sir Francis Burdett had been generally regarded\nas a madman. It was better to ask no questions, but silently to prepare\nherself for anything else there might be to come.\n\n\"Will you go to your rooms, Harold, and see if there is anything you\nwould like to have altered?\"\n\n\"Yes, let us go,\" said Harold, throwing down the newspaper, in which he\nhad been rapidly reading almost every advertisement while his mother had\nbeen going through her sharp inward struggle. \"Uncle Lingon is on the\nbench still, I see,\" he went on, as he followed her across the hall; \"is\nhe at home--will he be here this evening?\"\n\n\"He says you must go to the rectory when you want to see him. You must\nremember you have come back to a family with old-fashioned notions. Your\nuncle thought I ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two. He\nremembered that I had not seen my son for fifteen years.\"\n\n\"Ah, by Jove! fifteen years--so it is!\" said Harold, taking his mother's\nhand and drawing it under his arm; for he had perceived that her words\nwere charged with an intention. \"And you are as straight as an arrow\nstill; you will carry the shawls I have brought you as well as ever.\"\n\nThey walked up the broad stone steps together in silence. Under the\nshock of discovering her son's Radicalism, Mrs. Transome had no impulse\nto say one thing rather than another; as in a man who had just been\nbranded on the forehead all wonted motives would be uprooted. Harold, on\nhis side, had no wish opposed to filial kindness, but his busy thoughts\nwere determined by habits which had no reference to any woman's\nfeelings; and even if he could have conceived what his mother's feeling\nwas, his mind, after that momentary arrest, would have darted forward on\nits usual course.\n\n\"I have given you the south rooms, Harold,\" said Mrs. Transome, as they\npassed along a corridor lit from above and lined with old family\npictures. \"I thought they would suit you best, as they all open into\neach other, and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting-room for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Gad! the furniture is in a bad state,\" said Harold, glancing around at\nthe middle room which they had just entered; \"the moths seem to have got\ninto the carpets and hangings.\"\n\n\"I had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent,\" said Mrs.\nTransome. \"We have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited\nrooms.\"\n\n\"What! you've been rather pinched, eh?\"\n\n\"You find us living as we have been living these twelve years.\"\n\n\"Ah, you've had Durfey's debts as well as the lawsuits--confound them!\nIt will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages.\nHowever, he's gone now, poor fellow; and I suppose I should have spent\nmore in buying an English estate some time or other. I always meant to\nbe an Englishman, and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at Eton.\"\n\n\"I hardly thought you could have meant that, Harold, when I found you\nhad married a foreign wife.\"\n\n\"Would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical\nEnglishwoman, who would have hung all her relations around my neck? I\nhate English wives; they want to give their opinion about everything.\nThey interfere with a man's life. I shall not marry again.\"\n\nMrs. Transome bit her lip, and turned away to draw up a blind. She would\nnot reply to words which showed how completely any conception of herself\nand her feelings was excluded from her son's inward world.\n\nAs she turned round again she said, \"I suppose you have been used to\ngreat luxury; these rooms look miserable to you, but you can soon make\nany alterations you like.\"\n\n\"Oh, I must have a private sitting-room fitted up for myself\ndown-stairs. And the rest are bedrooms, I suppose,\" he went on, opening\na side-door. \"Ah, I can sleep here a night or two. But there's a bedroom\ndown-stairs, with an ante-room, I remember, that would do for my man\nDominic and the little boy. I should like to have that.\"\n\n\"Your father has slept there for years. He will be like a distracted\ninsect, and never know where to go, if you alter the track he has to\nwalk in.\"\n\n\"That's a pity. I hate going up-stairs.\"\n\n\"There is the steward's room: it is not used, and might be turned into a\nbedroom. I can't offer you my room, for I sleep up-stairs.\" (Mrs.\nTransome's tongue could be a whip upon occasion, but the lash had not\nfallen on a sensitive spot.)\n\n\"No; I'm determined not to sleep up-stairs. We'll see about the\nsteward's room to-morrow, and I dare say I shall find a closet of some\nsort for Dominic. It's a nuisance he had to stay behind, for I shall\nhave nobody to cook for me. Ah, there's the old river I used to fish in.\nI often thought, when I was at Smyrna, that I would buy a park with a\nriver through it as much like the Lapp as possible. Gad, what fine oaks\nthose are opposite! Some of them must come down, though.\"\n\n\"I've held every tree sacred on the demesne, as I told you, Harold. I\ntrusted to your getting the estate some time, and releasing it; and I\ndetermined to keep it worth releasing. A park without fine timber is no\nbetter than a beauty without teeth and hair.\"\n\n\"Bravo, mother!\" said Harold, putting his hand on her shoulder. \"Ah,\nyou've had to worry yourself about things that don't properly belong to\na woman--my father being weakly. We'll set all that right. You shall\nhave nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions.\"\n\n\"You must excuse me from the satin cushions. That is a part of the old\nwoman's duty I am not prepared for. I am used to be chief bailiff, and\nto sit in the saddle two or three hours every day. There are two farms\non our hands besides the Home Farm.\"\n\n\"Phew-ew! Jermyn manages the estate badly, then. That will not last\nunder _my_ reign,\" said Harold, turning on his heel and feeling in his\npockets for the keys of his portmanteaus, which had been brought up.\n\n\"Perhaps when you've been in England a little longer,\" said Mrs.\nTransome, coloring as if she had been a girl, \"you will understand\nbetter the difficulty there is in letting farms these times.\"\n\n\"I understand the difficulty perfectly, mother. To let farms, a man must\nhave the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers, and to\nget sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction I\nknow of. I suppose if I ring there's some fellow who can act as valet\nand learn to attend to my hookah?\"\n\n\"There is Hickes the butler, and there is Jabez the footman; those are\nall the men in the house. They were here when you left.\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember Jabez--he was a dolt. I'll have old Hickes. He was a\nneat little machine of a butler; his words used to come like the clicks\nof an engine. He must be an old machine now, though.\"\n\n\"You seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well, Harold.\"\n\n\"Never forget places and people--how they look and what can be done with\nthem. All the country round here lies like a map in my brain. A deuced\npretty country too; but the people were a stupid set of old Whigs and\nTories. I suppose they are much as they were.\"\n\n\"I am, at least, Harold. You are the first of your family that ever\ntalked of being a Radical. I did not think I was taking care of our old\noaks for that. I always thought Radicals' houses stood staring above\npoor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Radical sticks are growing, mother, and half the Tory oaks\nare rotting,\" said Harold, with gay carelessness. \"You've arranged for\nJermyn to be early to-morrow?\"\n\n\"He will be here to breakfast at nine. But I leave you to Hickes now; we\ndine in an hour.\"\n\nMrs. Transome went away and shut herself in her own dressing-room. It\nhad come to pass now--this meeting with the son who had been the object\nof so much longing; whom she had longed for before he was born, for whom\nshe had sinned, from whom she had wrenched herself with pain at their\nparting, and whose coming again had been the one great hope of her\nyears. The moment was gone by; there had been no ecstasy, no gladness\neven; hardly half an hour had passed, and few words had been spoken,\nyet with that quickness in weaving new futures which belongs to women\nwhose actions have kept them in habitual fear of consequences, Mrs.\nTransome thought she saw with all the clearness of demonstration that\nher son's return had not been a good for her in the sense of making her\nany happier.\n\nShe stood before a tall mirror, going close to it and looking at her\nface with hard scrutiny, as if it were unrelated to herself. No elderly\nface can be handsome, looked at in that way; every little detail is\nstartlingly prominent, and the effect of the whole is lost. She saw the\ndried-up complexion, and the deep lines of bitter discontent about the\nmouth.\n\n\"I am a hag!\" she said to herself (she was accustomed to give her\nthoughts a very sharp outline), \"an ugly old woman who happens to be his\nmother. That is what he sees in me, as I see a stranger in him. I shall\ncount for nothing. I was foolish to expect anything else.\"\n\nShe turned away from the mirror and walked up and down her room.\n\n\"What a likeness!\" she said, in a loud whisper; \"yet, perhaps, no one\nwill see it besides me.\"\n\nShe threw herself into a chair, and sat with a fixed look, seeing\nnothing that was actually present, but inwardly seeing with painful\nvividness what had been present with her a little more than thirty years\nago--the little round-limbed creature that had been leaning against her\nknees, and stamping tiny feet, and looking up at her with gurgling\nlaughter. She had thought that the possession of this child would give\nunity to her life, and make some gladness through the changing years\nthat would grow as fruit out of these early maternal caresses. But\nnothing had come just as she had wished. The mother's early raptures had\nlasted but a short time, and even while they lasted there had grown up\nin the midst of them a hungry desire, like a black poisonous plant\nfeeding in the sunlight,--the desire that her first, rickety, ugly,\nimbecile child should die, and leave room for her darling, of whom she\ncould be proud. Such desires make life a hideous lottery, where everyday\nmay turn up a blank; where men and women who have the softest beds and\nthe most delicate eating, who have a very large share of that sky and\nearth which some are born to have no more of than the fraction to be got\nin a crowded entry, yet grow haggard, fevered, and restless, like those\nwho watch in other lotteries. Day after day, year after year, had\nyielded blanks; new cares had come, bringing other desires for results\nquite beyond her grasp, which must also be watched for in the lottery;\nand all the while the round-limbed pet had been growing into a strong\nyouth, who liked many things better than his mother's caresses, and who\nhad a much keener consciousness of his independent existence than of his\nrelation to her: the lizard's egg, that white rounded passive\nprettiness, had become a brown, darting, determined lizard. The mother's\nlove is at first an absorbing delight, blunting all other sensibilities;\nit is an expansion of the animal existence; it enlarges the imagined\nrange for self to move in: but in after years it can only continue to be\njoy on the same terms as other long-lived love--that is, by much\nsuppression of self, and power of living in the experience of another.\nMrs. Transome had darkly felt the pressure of that unchangeable fact.\nYet she had clung to the belief that somehow the possession of this son\nwas the best thing she lived for; to believe otherwise would have made\nher memory too ghastly a companion. Some time or other, by some means,\nthe estate she was struggling to save from the grasp of the law would be\nHarold's. Somehow the hated Durfey, the imbecile eldest, who seemed to\nhave become tenacious of a despicable squandering life, would be got rid\nof; vice might kill him. Meanwhile the estate was burdened: there was no\ngood prospect for any heir. Harold must go and make a career for himself\nand this was what he was bent on, with a precocious clearness of\nperception as to the conditions on which he could hope for any\nadvantages in life. Like most energetic natures, he had a strong faith\nin his luck; he had been gay at their parting, and had promised to make\nhis fortune; and in spite of past disappointments, Harold's possible\nfortune still made some ground for his mother to plant her hopes in. His\nluck had not failed him; yet nothing had turned out according to her\nexpectations. Her life had been like a spoiled shabby pleasure-day, in\nwhich the music and the processions are all missed, and nothing is left\nat evening but the weariness of striving after what has been failed of.\nHarold had gone with the Embassy to Constantinople, under the patronage\nof a high relative, his mother's cousin; he was to be diplomatist, and\nwork his way upward in public life. But his luck had taken another\nshape: he had saved the life of an Armenian banker, who in gratitude had\noffered him a prospect which his practical mind had preferred to the\nproblematic promises of diplomacy and high-born cousinship. Harold had\nbecome a merchant and banker at Smyrna; and let the years pass without\ncaring to find the possibility of visiting his early home, and had shown\nno eagerness to make his life at all familiar to his mother, asking for\nletters about England, but writing scantily about himself. Mrs. Transome\nhad kept up the habit of writing to her son, but gradually the\nunfruitful years had dulled her hopes and yearnings; increasing\nanxieties about money had worried her, and she was more sure of being\nfretted by bad news about her dissolute eldest son than of hearing\nanything to cheer her from Harold. She had begun to live merely in small\nimmediate cares and occupations, and like all eager-minded women who\nadvance in life without any activity of tenderness or any large\nsympathy, she had contracted small rigid habits of thinking and acting,\nshe had her \"ways\" which must not be crossed, and had learned to fill up\nthe great void of life with giving small orders to tenants, insisting on\nmedicines for infirm cottagers, winning small triumphs in bargains and\npersonal economies, and parrying ill-natured remarks of Lady Debarry's\nby lancet-edged epigrams. So her life had gone on till more than a year\nago, when that desire which had been so hungry when she was a blooming\nyoung mother, was at last fulfilled--at last, when her hair was gray,\nand her face looked bitter, restless, and unenjoying, like her life. The\nnews came from Jersey that Durfey, the imbecile son, was dead. _Now_\nHarold was heir to the estate; now the wealth he had gained could\nrelease the land from its burdens; now he would think it worth while to\nreturn home. A change had come over her life, and the sunlight breaking\nthe clouds at evening was pleasant, though the sun must sink before\nlong. Hopes, affections, the sweeter part of her memories, started from\ntheir wintry sleep, and it once more seemed a great good to have had a\nsecond son who in some ways had cost her dearly. But again there were\nconditions she had not reckoned on. When the good tidings had been sent\nto Harold, and he had announced that he would return so soon as he could\nwind up his affairs, he had for the first time informed his mother that\nhe had been married, that his Greek wife was no longer living, but that\nhe should bring home a little boy, the finest and most desirable of\nheirs and grandsons. Harold seated in his distant Smyrna home considered\nthat he was taking a rational view of what things must have become by\nthis time at the old place in England, when he figured his mother as a\ngood elderly lady, who would necessarily be delighted with the\npossession on any terms of a healthy grandchild, and would not mind\nmuch about the particulars of a long-concealed marriage.\n\nMrs. Transome had torn up that letter in a rage. But in the months which\nhad elapsed before Harold could actually arrive, she had prepared\nherself as well as she could to suppress all reproaches or queries which\nher son might resent, and to acquiesce in his evident wishes. The return\nwas still looked for with longing; affection and satisfied pride would\nagain warm her later years. She was ignorant what sort of man Harold had\nbecome now, and of course he must be changed in many ways; but though\nshe told herself this, still the image that she knew, the image fondness\nclung to, necessarily prevailed over the negatives insisted on by her\nreason.\n\nAnd so it was, that when she had moved to the door to meet him, she had\nbeen sure that she should clasp her son again, and feel that he was the\nsame who had been her boy, her little one, the loved child of her\npassionate youth. An hour seemed to have changed everything for her. A\nwoman's hopes are woven of sunbeams; a shadow annihilates them. The\nshadow which had fallen over Mrs. Transome in this first interview with\nher son was the presentiment of her powerlessness. If things went wrong,\nif Harold got unpleasantly disposed in a certain direction where her\nchief dread had always lain, she seemed to foresee that her words would\nbe of no avail. The keenness of her anxiety in this matter had served as\ninsight; and Harold's rapidity, decision, and indifference to any\nimpressions in others, which did not further or impede his own purposes,\nhad made themselves felt by her as much as she would have felt the\nunmanageable strength of a great bird which had alighted near her, and\nallowed her to stroke its wing for a moment because food lay near her.\n\nUnder the cold weight of these thoughts Mrs. Transome shivered. That\nphysical reaction roused her from her reverie, and she could now hear\nthe gentle knocking at the door to which she had been deaf before.\nNotwithstanding her activity and the fewness of her servants, she had\nnever dressed herself without aid; nor would that small, neat,\nexquisitely clean old woman who now presented herself have wished that\nher labor should be saved at the expense of such a sacrifice on her\nlady's part. The small old woman was Mrs. Hickes, the butler's wife, who\nacted as housekeeper, lady's-maid, and superintendent of the\nkitchen--the large stony scene of inconsiderable cooking. Forty years\nago she had entered Mrs. Transome's service, when that lady was\nbeautiful Miss Lingon, and her mistress still called her Denner, as she\nhad done in the old days.\n\n\"The bell has rung, then, Denner, without my hearing it?\" said Mrs.\nTransome, rising.\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Denner, reaching from a wardrobe an old black velvet\ndress trimmed with much-mended point, in which Mrs. Transome was wont to\nlook queenly of an evening.\n\nDenner had still strong eyes of that short-sighted kind which sees\nthrough the narrowest chink between the eyelashes. The physical contrast\nbetween the tall, eagle-faced, dark-eyed lady, and the little peering\nwaiting woman, who had been round-featured and of pale mealy complexion\nfrom her youth up, had doubtless had a strong influence in determining\nDenner's feeling toward her mistress, which was of that worshipful sort\npaid to a goddess in ages when it was not thought necessary or likely\nthat a goddess should be very moral. There were different orders of\nbeings--so ran Denner's creed--and she belonged to another order than\nthat to which her mistress belonged. She had a mind as sharp as a\nneedle, and would have seen through and through the ridiculous\npretensions of a born servant who did not submissively accept the rigid\nfate which had given her born superiors. She would have called such\npretensions the wrigglings of a worm that tried to walk on its tail.\nThere was a tacit understanding that Denner knew all her mistress's\nsecrets, and her speech was plain and unflattering; yet with wonderful\nsubtlety of instinct she never said anything which Mrs. Transome could\nfeel humiliated by, as by familiarity from a servant who knew too much.\nDenner identified her own dignity with that of her mistress. She was a\nhard-headed godless little woman, but with a character to be reckoned on\nas you reckon on the qualities of iron.\n\nPeering into Mrs. Transome's face she saw clearly that the meeting with\nthe son had been a disappointment in some way. She spoke with a refined\naccent, in a low quick, monotonous tone--\n\n\"Mr. Harold is dressed; he shook me by the hand in the corridor, and was\nvery pleasant.\"\n\n\"What an alteration, Denner! No likeness to me now.\"\n\n\"Handsome, though, spite of his being so browned and stout. There's a\nfine presence about Mr. Harold. I remember you used to say, madam, there\nwere some people you would always know were in the room though they\nstood round a corner, and others you might never see till you ran\nagainst them. That's as true as truth. And as for likenesses,\nthirty-five and sixty are not much alike, only to people's memories.\"\n\nMrs. Transome knew perfectly that Denner had divined her thoughts.\n\n\"I don't know how things will go on now, but it seems something too good\nto happen that they will go on well. I am afraid of ever expecting\nanything good again.\"\n\n\"That's weakness, madam. Things don't happen because they're bad or\ngood, else all eggs would be addled or none at all, and at the most it\nis but six to the dozen. There's good chances and bad chances, and\nnobody's luck is pulled only by one string.\"\n\n\"What a woman you are, Denner! You talk like a French infidel. It seems\nto me you are afraid of nothing. I have been full of fears all my\nlife--always seeing something or other hanging over me that I couldn't\nbear to happen.\"\n\n\"Well, madam, put a good face on it, and don't seem to be on the look-out\nfor crows, else you'll set other people watching. Here you have a rich\nson come home, and the debts will all be paid, and you have your health\nand can ride about, and you've such a face and figure, and will have if\nyou live to be eighty, that everybody is cap in hand to you before they\nknow you who are; let me fasten up your veil a little higher: there's a\ngood deal of pleasure in life for you yet.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! there's no pleasure for old women, unless they get it out of\ntormenting other people. What are your pleasures, Denner--besides being\na slave to me?\"\n\n\"Oh, there's pleasure in knowing one's not a fool, like half the people\none sees about. And managing one's husband is some pleasure; and doing\nall one's business well. Why, if I've only got some orange flowers to\ncandy, I shouldn't like to die till I see them all right. Then there's\nthe sunshine now and then; I like that as the cats do. I look upon it,\nlife is like our game at whist, when Banks and his wife come to the\nstill-room of an evening. I don't enjoy the game much, but I like to\nplay my cards well, and see what will be the end of it; and I want to\nsee you make the best of your hand, madam, for your luck has been mine\nthese forty years now. But I must go and see how Kitty dishes up the\ndinner, unless you have any more commands.\"\n\n\"No, Denner; I am going down immediately.\"\n\nAs Mrs. Transome descended the stone staircase in her old black velvet\nand point, her appearance justified Denner's personal compliment. She\nhad that high-born, imperious air which would have marked her as an\nobject of hatred and reviling by a revolutionary mob. Her person was too\ntypical of social distinctions to be passed by with indifference by any\none: it would have fitted an empress in her own right, who had had to\nrule in spite of faction, to dare the violation of treaties and dread\nretributive invasions, to grasp after new territories, to be defiant in\ndesperate circumstances, and to feel a woman's hunger of the heart\nforever unsatisfied. Yet Mrs. Transome's cares and occupations had not\nbeen at all of an imperial sort. For thirty years she had led the\nmonotonous, narrowing life which used to be the lot of our poorer\ngentry; who never went to town, and were probably not on speaking terms\nwith two out of the five families whose parks lay within the distance of\na drive. When she was young she had been thought wonderfully clever and\naccomplished, and had been rather ambitious of intellectual\nsuperiority--had secretly picked out for private reading the higher\nparts of dangerous French authors--and in company had been able to talk\nof Mr. Burke's style, or of Chateaubriand's eloquence--had laughed at\nthe Lyrical Ballads, and admired Mr. Southey's Thalaba. She always\nthought that the dangerous French writers were wicked and that her\nreading of them was a sin; but many sinful things were highly agreeable\nto her, and many things which she did not doubt to be good and true were\ndull and meaningless. She found ridicule of Biblical characters very\namusing, and she was interested in stories of illicit passion; but she\nbelieved all the while that truth and safety lay in due attendance on\nprayers and sermons, in the admirable doctrines and ritual of the Church\nof England, equally remote from Puritanism and Popery; in fact, in such\na view of this world and the next as would preserve the existing\narrangements of English society quite unshaken, keeping down the\nobtrusiveness of the vulgar and the discontent of the poor. The history\nof the Jews, she knew, ought to be preferred to any profane history; the\nPagans, of course, were vicious, and their religions quite nonsensical,\nconsidered as religions--but classical learning came from the Pagans;\nthe Greeks were famous for sculpture; the Italians for painting; the\nmiddle ages were dark and Papistical; but now Christianity went hand in\nhand with civilization, and the providential government of the world,\nthough a little confused and entangled in foreign countries, in our\nfavored land was clearly seen to be carried forward on Tory and Church\nof England principles, sustained by the succession of the House of\nBrunswick, and by sound English divines. For Miss Lingon had had a\nsuperior governess, who held that a woman should be able to write a good\nletter, and to express herself with propriety on general subjects. And\nit is astonishing how effective this education appeared in a handsome\ngirl, who sat supremely well on horseback, sang and played a little,\npainted small figures in water-colors, had a naughty sparkle in her eyes\nwhen she made a daring quotation, and an air of serious dignity when she\nrecited something from her store of correct opinions. But however such a\nstock of ideas may be made to tell in elegant society, and during a few\nseasons in town, no amount of bloom and beauty can make them a perennial\nsource of interest in things not personal; and the notion that what is\ntrue and, in general, good for mankind, is stupid and drug-like, is not\na safe theoretic basis in circumstances of temptation and difficulty.\nMrs. Transome had been in her bloom before this century began, and in\nthe long painful years since then, what she had once regarded as her\nknowledge and accomplishments had become as valueless as old-fashioned\nstucco ornaments, of which the substance was never worth anything, while\nthe form is no longer to the taste of any living mortal. Crosses,\nmortifications, money-cares, conscious blame-worthiness, had changed the\naspect of the world for her; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight;\nthere was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting\nneighbors; there was advancing age, and a contracting prospect in the\nchanging seasons as they came and went. And what could then sweeten the\ndays to a hungry, much-exacting self like Mrs. Transome's? Under\nprotracted ill every living creature will find something that makes a\ncomparative ease, and even when life seems woven of pain, will convert\nthe fainter pang into a desire. Mrs. Transome, whose imperious will had\navailed little to ward off the great evils of her life, found the opiate\nfor her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things. She\nwas not cruel, and could not enjoy thoroughly what she called the old\nwoman's pleasure of tormenting; but she liked every little sign of power\nher lot had left her. She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded\nbelow her as she sat on horseback. She liked to insist that work done\nwithout her orders should be undone from beginning to end. She liked to\nbe courtesied and bowed to by all the congregation as she walked up the\nlittle barn of a church. She liked to change a laborer's medicine\nfetched from the doctor, and substitute a prescription of her own. If\nshe had only been more haggard and less majestic, those who had glimpses\nof her outward life might have said she was a tyrannical, griping\nharridan, with a tongue like a razor. No one said exactly that; but they\nnever said anything like the full truth about her, or divined what was\nhidden under that outward life--a woman's keen sensibility and dread,\nwhich lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions, as\nsome quivering thing with eyes and throbbing heart may lie crouching\nbehind withered rubbish. The sensibility and dread had palpitated all\nthe faster in the prospect of her son's return; and now that she had\nseen him, she said to herself, in her bitter way, \"It is a lucky eel\nthat escapes skinning. The best happiness I shall ever know, will be to\nescape the worst misery.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n    A jolly parson of the good old stock,\n    By birth a gentleman, yet homely too,\n    Suiting his phrase to Hodge and Margery\n    Whom he once christened, and has married since,\n    A little lax in doctrine and in life.\n    Not thinking God was captious in such things\n    As what a man might drink on holidays,\n    But holding true religion was to do\n    As you'd be done by--which could never mean\n    That he should preach three sermons in a week.\n\n\nHarold Transome did not choose to spend the whole evening with his\nmother. It was his habit to compress a great deal of effective\nconversation into a short space of time, asking rapidly all the\nquestions he wanted to get answered, and diluting no subject with\nirrelevancies, paraphrase, or repetitions. He volunteered no information\nabout himself and his past life at Smyrna, but answered pleasantly\nenough, though briefly, whenever his mother asked for any detail. He was\nevidently ill-satisfied as to his palate, trying red pepper to\neverything, then asking if there were any relishing sauces in the house,\nand when Hickes brought various home-filled bottles, trying several,\nfinding them failures, and finally falling back from his plate in\ndespair. Yet he remained good-humored, saying something to his father\nnow and then for the sake of being kind, and looking on with a pitying\nshrug as he saw him watch Hickes cutting his food. Mrs. Transome thought\nwith some bitterness that Harold showed more feeling for her feeble\nhusband who had never cared in the least about him, than for her, who\nhad given him more than the usual share of mother's love. An hour after\ndinner, Harold, who had already been turning over the leaves of his\nmother's account-books, said--\n\n\"I shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle Lingon.\"\n\n\"Very well. He can answer more questions for you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harold, quite deaf to the innuendo, and accepting the words\nas a simple statement of the fact. \"I want to hear all about the game\nand the North Loamshire hunt. I'm fond of sport; we had a great deal of\nit at Smyrna, and it keeps down my fat.\"\n\nThe Reverend John Lingon became very talkative over his second bottle of\nport, which was opened on his nephew's arrival. He was not curious about\nthe manners of Smyrna, or about Harold's experience, but he unbosomed\nhimself very freely as to what he himself liked and disliked, which of\nthe farmers he suspected of killing the foxes, what game he had bagged\nthat very morning, what spot he would recommend as a new cover, and the\ncomparative flatness of all existing sport compared with cock-fighting,\nunder which Old England had been prosperous and glorious, while, so far\nas he could see, it had gained little by the abolition of a practice\nwhich sharpened the faculties of men, gratified the instincts of the\nfowl, and carried out the designs of heaven in its admirable device of\nspurs. From these main topics, which made his points of departure and\nreturn, he rambled easily enough at any new suggestion or query; so that\nwhen Harold got home at a late hour, he was conscious of having gathered\nfrom amidst the pompous full-toned triviality of his uncle's chat some\nimpressions, which were of practical importance. Among the rector's\ndislikes, it appeared, was Mr. Matthew Jermyn.\n\n\"A fat-handed, glib-tongued fellow, with a scented cambric handkerchief;\none of your educated low-bred fellows; a foundling who got his Latin for\nnothing at Christ's Hospital; one of your middle-class upstarts who want\nto rank with gentlemen, and think they'll do it with kid gloves and new\nfurniture.\"\n\nBut since Harold meant to stand for the county, Mr. Lingon was equally\nemphatic as to the necessity of his not quarrelling with Jermyn till the\nelection was over. Jermyn must be his agent; Harold must wink hard till\nhe found himself safely returned; and even then it might be well to let\nJermyn drop gently and raise no scandal. He himself had no quarrel with\nthe fellow: a clergyman should have no quarrels, and he made it a point\nto be able to take wine with any man he met at table. And as to the\nestate, and his sister's going too much by Jermyn's advice, he never\nmeddled with business: it was not his duty as a clergyman. That, he\nconsidered, was the meaning of Melchisedec and the tithe, a subject,\ninto which he had gone to some depth thirty years ago, when he preached\nthe Visitation sermon.\n\nThe discovery that Harold meant to stand on the Liberal side--nay, that\nhe boldly declared himself a Radical--was rather startling; but to his\nuncle's good-humor, beatified by the sipping of port-wine, nothing could\nseem highly objectionable, provided it did not disturb that operation.\nIn the course of half an hour he had brought himself to see that\nanything really worthy to be called British Toryism had been entirely\nextinct since the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel had passed the\nCatholic Emancipation Bill; that Whiggery, with its rights of man\nstopping short at ten-pound householders, and its policy of pacifying a\nwild beast with a bite, was a ridiculous monstrosity; that therefore,\nsince an honest man could not call himself a Tory, which it was, in\nfact, as impossible to be now as to fight for the old Pretender, and\ncould still less become that execrable monstrosity a Whig, there\nremained but one course open to him. \"Why, lad, if the world was turned\ninto a swamp, I suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings, and\nwalk about like cranes\"--whence it followed plainly enough that, in\nthese hopeless times, nothing was left to men of sense and good family\nbut to retard the national ruin by declaring themselves Radicals, and\ntake the inevitable process of changing everything out of the hands of\nbeggarly demagogues and purse-proud tradesmen. It is true the rector was\nhelped to this chain of reasoning by Harold's remarks; but he soon\nbecame quite ardent in asserting the conclusion.\n\n\"If the mob can't be turned back, a man of family must try and head the\nmob, and save a few homes and hearths, and keep the country up on its\nlast legs as long as he can. And you're a man of family, my lad--dash\nit! You're a Lingon, whatever else you may be, and I'll stand by you.\nI've no great interest; I'm a poor parson. I've been forced to give up\nhunting; my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies\nbecoming my station that I can allow myself. But I'll give you my\ncountenance--I'll stick to you as my nephew. There's no need for me to\nchange sides exactly. I was born a Tory, and I shall never be a bishop.\nBut if anybody says you're in the wrong, I shall say, 'My nephew is in\nthe right; he has turned Radical to save his country. If William Pitt\nhad been living now he'd have done the same; for what did he say when he\nwas dying? Not 'Oh, save my party!' but 'Oh, save my country, heaven!'\nThat was what they dinned in our ears about Peel and the Duke; and now\nI'll turn it round upon them. They shall be hoist with their own petard.\nYes, yes, I'll stand by you.\"\n\nHarold did not feel sure that his uncle would thoroughly retain this\nsatisfactory thread of argument in the uninspired hours of the morning;\nbut the old gentleman was sure to take the facts easily in the end, and\nthere was no fear of family coolness or quarrelling on this side. Harold\nwas glad of it. He was not to be turned aside from any course he had\nchosen; but he disliked all quarrelling as an unpleasant expenditure of\nenergy that could have no good practical result. He was at once active\nand luxurious; fond of mastery, and good-natured enough to wish that\nevery one about him should like his mastery; not caring greatly to know\nother people's thoughts, and ready to despise them as blockheads if\ntheir thoughts differed from his, and yet solicitous that they should\nhave no colorable reason for slight thoughts about _him_. The blockheads\nmust be forced to respect him. Hence, in proportion as he foresaw his\nequals in the neighborhood would be indignant with him for his political\nchoice, he cared keenly about making a good figure before them in every\nother way. His conduct as a landholder was to be judicious, his\nestablishment was to be kept up generously, his imbecile father treated\nwith careful regard, his family relations entirely without scandal. He\nknew that affairs had been unpleasant in his youth--that there had been\nugly lawsuits--and that his scapegrace brother Durfey had helped to\nlower still farther the depressed condition of the family. All this must\nbe retrieved, now that events had made Harold the head of the Transome\nname.\n\nJermyn must be used for the election, and after that if he must be got\nrid of, it would be well to shake him loose quietly; his uncle was\nprobably right on both these points. But Harold's expectation that he\nshould want to get rid of Jermyn was founded on other reasons than his\nscented handkerchief and his charity-school Latin.\n\nIf the lawyer had been presuming on Mrs. Transome's ignorance as a\nwoman, and on the stupid rakishness of the original heir, the new heir\nwould prove to him that he had calculated rashly. Otherwise, Harold had\nno prejudice against him. In his boyhood and youth he had seen Jermyn\nfrequenting Transome Court, but had regarded him with that total\nindifference with which youngsters are apt to view those who neither\ndeny them pleasure nor give them any. Jermyn used to smile at him, and\nspeak to him affably; but Harold, half proud, half shy, got away from\nsuch patronage as soon as possible; he knew Jermyn was a man of\nbusiness; his father, his uncle, and Sir Maximus Debarry did not regard\nhim as a gentleman and their equal. He had known no evil of the man; but\nhe saw now that if he were really a covetous upstart, there had been a\ntemptation for him in the management of the Transome affairs; and it was\nclear that the estate was in a bad condition.\n\nWhen Mr. Jermyn was ushered into the breakfast-room the next morning,\nHarold found him surprisingly little altered by the fifteen years. He\nwas gray, but still remarkably handsome; fat, but tall enough to bear\nthat trial to man's dignity. There was as strong a suggestion of\ntoilette about him as if he had been five-and-twenty instead of nearly\nsixty. He chose always to dress in black, and was especially addicted to\nblack satin waistcoats, which carried out the general sleekness of his\nappearance; and this, together with his white, fat, but\nbeautifully-shaped hands, which he was in the habit of rubbing gently on\nhis entrance into a room, gave him very much the air of a lady's\nphysician. Harold remembered with some amusement his uncle's dislike of\nthose conspicuous hands; but as his own were soft and dimpled, and as he\ntoo was given to the innocent practice of rubbing those members, his\nsuspicions were not yet deepened.\n\n\"I congratulate you, Mrs. Transome,\" said Jermyn, with a soft and\ndeferential smile, \"all the more,\" he added, turning toward Harold, \"now\nI have the pleasure of actually seeing your son. I am glad to perceive\nthat an Eastern climate has not been unfavorable to him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Harold, shaking Jermyn's hand carelessly, and speaking with\nmore than his usual brusqueness, \"the question is, whether the English\nclimate will agree with me. It's deuced shifting and damp; and as for\nthe food, it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if\nthe southern cooks would change their religion, get persecuted, and fly\nto England, as the old silk-weavers did.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay\nfor them, I suppose,\" said Mrs. Transome, \"but they are unpleasant\npeople to have about one's house.\"\n\n\"Gad! I don't think so,\" said Harold.\n\n\"The old servants are sure to quarrel with them.\"\n\n\"That's no concern of mine. The old servants will have to put up with my\nman Dominic, who will show them how to cook and do everything else in a\nway that will rather astonish them.\"\n\n\"Old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways, Harold.\"\n\n\"Well, they can give up and watch the young ones,\" said Harold, thinking\nonly at that moment of old Mrs. Hickes and Dominic. But his mother was\nnot thinking of them only.\n\n\"You have a valuable servant, it seems,\" said Jermyn, who understood\nMrs. Transome better than her son did, and wished to smoothen the\ncurrent of their dialogue.\n\n\"Oh, one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one's life easy.\nHe's of no country in particular. I don't know whether he's most of a\nJew, a Greek, an Italian, or a Spaniard. He speaks five or six\nlanguages, one as well as another. He's cook, valet, major-domo, and\nsecretary all in one; and what's more, he's an affectionate fellow--I\ncan trust to his attachment. That's a sort of human specimen that\ndoesn't grow here in England, I fancy. I should have been badly off if I\ncould not have brought Dominic.\"\n\nThey sat down to breakfast with such slight talk as this going on. Each\nof the party was preoccupied and uneasy. Harold's mind was busy\nconstructing probabilities about what he should discover of Jermyn's\nmismanagement or dubious application of funds, and the sort of\nself-command he must in the worst case exercise in order to use the man\nas long as he wanted him. Jermyn was closely observing Harold with an\nunpleasant sense that there was an expression of acuteness and\ndetermination about him which would make him formidable. He would\ncertainly have preferred at that moment that there had been no second\nheir of the Transome name to come back upon him from the East. Mrs.\nTransome was not observing the two men; rather, her hands were cold, and\nher whole person shaken by their presence; she seemed to hear and see\nwhat they said and did with preternatural acuteness, and yet she was\nalso seeing and hearing what had been said and done many years before,\nand feeling a dim terror about the future. There were piteous\nsensibilities in this faded woman, who thirty-four years ago, in the\nsplendor of her bloom, had been imperious to one of these men, and had\nrapturously pressed the other as an infant to her bosom, and now knew\nthat she was of little consequence to either of them.\n\n\"Well, what are the prospects about election?\" said Harold, as the\nbreakfast was advancing. \"There are two Whigs and one Conservative\nlikely to be in the field, I know. What is your opinion of the chances?\"\n\nMr. Jermyn had a copious supply of words which often led him into\nperiphrase, but he cultivated a hesitating stammer, which, with a\nhandsome impassiveness of face, except when he was smiling at a woman,\nor when the latent savageness of his nature was thoroughly roused, he\nhad found useful in many relations, especially in business. No one could\nhave found out that he was not at his ease. \"My opinion,\" he replied,\n\"is in a state of balance at present. This division of the county, you\nare aware, contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude, and\nseveral smaller ones. The manufacturing interest is widely dispersed. So\nfar--a--there is a presumption--a--in favor of the two Liberal\ncandidates. Still, with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts,\nsuch as those we have round us at Treby Magna, I think--a--the\nauguries--a--would not be unfavorable to the return of a Conservative. A\nfourth candidate of good position, who should coalesce with Mr.\nDebarry--a----\"\n\nHere Mr. Jermyn hesitated for the third time, and Harold broke in.\n\n\"That will not be my line of action, so we need not discuss it. If I put\nup it will be as a Radical; and I fancy, in any county that would return\nWhigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a Radical who\noffered himself with good pretensions.\"\n\nThere was the slightest possible quiver discernible across Jermyn's\nface. Otherwise he sat as he had done before, with his eyes fixed\nabstractedly on the frill of a ham before him, and his hand trifling\nwith his fork. He did not answer immediately, but, when he did, he\nlooked round steadily at Harold.\n\n\"I'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly\nacquainted with English politics.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" said Harold, impatiently. \"I'm aware how things have\nbeen going on in England. I always meant to come back ultimately. I\nsuppose I know the state of Europe as well as if I'd been stationary at\nLittle Treby for the last fifteen years. If a man goes to the East,\npeople seem to think he gets turned into something like the one-eyed\ncalender in the 'Arabian Nights!'\"\n\n\"Yet I should think there are some things which people who have been\nstationary at Little Treby could tell you, Harold,\" said Mrs. Transome.\n\"It did not signify about your holding Radical opinions at Smyrna; but\nyou seem not to imagine how your putting up as a Radical will affect\nyour position here, and the position of your family. No one will visit\nyou. And then--the sort of people who will support you! You really have\nno idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a Radical.\nThere are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Harold, rising and walking along the room.\n\nBut Mrs. Transome went on with growing anger in her voice--\"It seems to\nme that a man owes something to his birth and station, and has no right\nto take up this notion or other, just as it suits his fancy; still less\nto work at the overthrow of his class. That was what every one said of\nLord Grey, and my family at least is as good as Lord Grey's. You have\nwealth now, and might distinguish yourself in the county; and if you had\nbeen true to your colors as a gentleman, you would have had all the\ngreater opportunity, because the times are so bad. The Debarrys and Lord\nWyvern would have set all the more store by you. For my part, I can't\nconceive what good you propose to yourself. I only entreat you to think\nagain before you take any decided step.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Harold, not angrily or with any raising of his voice, but\nin a quick, impatient manner, as if the scene must be got through as\nquickly as possible; \"it is natural that you should think in this way.\nWomen, very properly, don't change their views, but keep to the notions\nin which they have been brought up. It doesn't signify what they\nthink--they are not called upon to judge or to act. You must leave me to\ntake my own course in these matters, which properly belong to men.\nBeyond that, I will gratify any wish you may choose to mention. You\nshall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself; you shall\nhave the house done up in first-rate style, and I am not thinking of\nmarrying. But let us understand that there shall be no further collision\nbetween us on subjects on which I must be master of my own actions.\"\n\n\"And you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life, Harold. I\ndon't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight\nthing she will be to her son when she is old.\"\n\nMrs. Transome here walked out of the room by the nearest way--the glass\ndoor open toward the terrace. Mr. Jermyn had risen too, and his hands\nwere on the back of his chair. He looked quite impassive: it was not the\nfirst time he had seen Mrs. Transome angry; but now, for the first time,\nhe thought the outburst of her temper would be useful to him. She, poor\nwoman, knew quite well that she had been unwise, and that she had been\nmaking herself disagreeable to Harold to no purpose. But half the\nsorrows of women would be averted if they could repress the speech they\nknow to be useless--nay, the speech they have resolved not to utter.\nHarold continued his walking a moment longer, and then said to Jermyn--\n\n\"You smoke?\"\n\n\"No, I always defer to the ladies. Mrs. Jermyn is peculiarly sensitive\nin such matters, and doesn't like tobacco.\"\n\nHarold, who, underneath all the tendencies which had made him a Liberal,\nhad intense personal pride, thought, \"Confound the fellow--with his Mrs.\nJermyn! Does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about\nhis wife?\"\n\n\"Well, I took my hookah before breakfast,\" he said aloud, \"so, if you\nlike, we'll go into the library. My father never gets up till midday, I\nfind.\"\n\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" said Harold, as they entered the handsome,\nspacious library. But he himself continued to stand before a map of the\ncounty which he had opened from a series of rollers occupying a\ncompartment among the bookshelves. \"The first question, Mr. Jermyn, now\nyou know my intentions, is, whether you will undertake to be my agent in\nthis election, and help me through? There's no time to be lost, and I\ndon't want to lose my chance, as I may not have another for seven years.\nI understand,\" he went on, flashing a look straight at Jermyn, \"that you\nhave not taken any conspicuous course in politics, and I know that\nLabron is agent for the Debarrys.\"\n\n\"Oh--a--my dear sir--a man necessarily has his political convictions,\nbut of what use is it for a professional man--a--of some education, to\ntalk of them in a little country town? There really is no comprehension\nof public questions in such places. Party feeling, indeed, was quite\nasleep here before the agitation about the Catholic Relief Bill. It is\ntrue that I concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition\nagainst the Reform Bill, but I did not state my reasons. The weak points\nin that Bill are--a--too palpable, and I fancy you and I should not\ndiffer much on that head. The fact is, when I knew that you were to come\nback to us, I kept myself in reserve, though I was much pressed by the\nfriends of Sir James Clement, the Ministerial candidate, who is----\"\n\n\"However, you will act for me--that's settled?\" said Harold.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Jermyn, inwardly irritated by Harold's rapid manner of\ncutting him short.\n\n\"Which of the Liberal candidates, as they call themselves, has the\nbetter chance, eh?\"\n\n\"I was going to observe that Sir James Clement has not so good a\nchance as Mr. Garstin, supposing that a third Liberal candidate\npresents himself. There are two senses in which a politician can be\nliberal\"--here Mr. Jermyn smiled--\"Sir James Clement is a poor baronet,\nhoping for an appointment, and can't be expected to be liberal in that\nwider sense which commands majorities.\"\n\n\"I wish this man were not so much of a talker,\" thought Harold, \"he'll\nbore me. We shall see,\" he said aloud, \"what can be done in the way of\ncombination. I'll come down to your office after one o'clock if it will\nsuit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Ah, and you'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information\nready for me there. I must get up a dinner for the tenants, and we can\ninvite whom we like besides the tenants. Just now, I'm going over one of\nthe farms on hand with the bailiff. By the way, that's a desperately bad\nbusiness, having three farms unlet--how comes that about, eh?\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I wanted to say a few words about to you. You\nhave observed already how strongly Mrs. Transome takes certain things to\nheart. You can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways.\nMr. Transome's want of health; Mr. Durfey's habits--a----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"She is a woman for whom I naturally entertain the highest respect, and\nshe has had hardly any gratification for many years, except the sense of\nhaving affairs to a certain extent in her own hands. She objects to\nchanges; she will not have a new style of tenants; she likes the old\nstock of farmers who milk their own cows, and send their younger\ndaughters out to service: all this makes it difficult to do the best\nwith the estate. I am aware things are not as they ought to be, for, in\npoint of fact, improved agricultural management is a matter in which I\ntake considerable interest, and the farm which I myself hold on the\nestate you will see, I think, to be in a superior condition. But Mrs.\nTransome is a woman of strong feeling, and I would urge you, my dear\nsir, to make the changes which you have, but which I had not the right\nto insist on, as little painful to her as possible.\"\n\n\"I shall know what to do, sir, never fear,\" said Harold, much offended.\n\n\"You will pardon, I hope, a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a\nman of my age, who has been so long in a close connection with the\nfamily affairs--a--I have never considered that connection simply in a\nlight of business--a----\"\n\n\"Damn him, I'll soon let him know that _I_ do,\" thought Harold. But in\nproportion as he found Jermyn's manners annoying, he felt the necessity\nof controlling himself. He despised all persons who defeated their own\nprojects by the indulgence of momentary impulses.\n\n\"I understand, I understand,\" he said aloud. \"You've had more awkward\nbusiness on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family\nlawyer. We shall set everything right by degrees. But now as to the\ncanvassing. I've made arrangements with a first-rate man in London, who\nunderstands these matters thoroughly--a solicitor, of course--he has\ncarried no end of men into Parliament. I'll engage him to meet us at\nDuffield--say when?\"\n\nThe conversation after this was driven carefully clear of all angles,\nand ended with determined amicableness. When Harold, in his ride an hour\nor two afterward, encountered his uncle shouldering a gun, and followed\nby one black and one liver-spotted pointer, his muscular person with its\nred eagle face set off by a velveteen jacket and leather leggings, Mr.\nLingon's first question was--\n\n\"Well, lad, how have you got on with Jermyn?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think I shall like the fellow. He's a sort of amateur\ngentleman. But I must make use of him. I expect whatever I get out of\nhim will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of\nus. But I shall see.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, use his gun to bring down your game, and after that, beat the\nthief with the butt end. That's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in\none--talking between ourselves as uncle and nephew. But I say, Harold, I\nwas going to tell you, now I come to think of it, this is rather a\nnasty business, your calling yourself a Radical. I've been turning it\nover in after-dinner speeches, but it looks awkward--it's not what\npeople are used to--it wants a good deal of Latin to make it go down. I\nshall be worried about it at the sessions, and I can think of nothing\nneat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, uncle! I remember what a good speechifier you always were;\nyou'll never be at a loss. You only want a few more evenings to think of\nit.\"\n\n\"But you'll not be attacking the Church and the institutions of the\ncountry--you'll not be going those lengths; you'll keep up the bulwarks,\nand so on, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I shan't attack the Church, only the incomes of the bishops,\nperhaps, to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I have no objection to that. Nobody likes our bishop: he's\nall Greek and greediness; too proud to dine with his own father. You may\npepper the bishops a little. But you'll respect the constitution handed\ndown, etc.--and you'll rally round the throne--and the King, God bless\nhim, and the usual toasts, eh?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. I am a Radical only in rooting out abuses.\"\n\n\"That's the word I wanted, my lad!\" said the vicar, slapping Harold's\nknee. \"That's a spool to wind a speech on. Abuses is the very word; and\nif anybody shows himself offended, he'll put the cap on for himself.\"\n\n\"I remove the rotten timbers,\" said Harold, inwardly amused, \"and\nsubstitute fresh oak, that's all.\"\n\n\"Well done, my boy! By George, you'll be a speaker! But I say, Harold, I\nhope you've got a little Latin left. This young Debarry is a tremendous\nfellow at the classics, and walks on stilts to any length. He's one of\nthe new Conservatives. Old Sir Maximus doesn't understand him at all.\"\n\n\"That won't do at the hustings,\" said Harold. \"He'll get knocked off his\nstilts pretty quickly there.\"\n\n\"Bless me! it's astonishing how well you're up in the affairs of the\ncountry, my boy. But rub up a few quotations--'_Quod turpe bonis decebat\nCrispinum_'--and that sort of thing--just to show Debarry what you could\ndo if you liked. But you want to ride on?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have an appointment at Treby. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"He's a cleverish chap,\" muttered the vicar, as Harold rode away. \"When\nhe's had plenty of English exercise, and brought out his knuckle a bit,\nhe'll be a Lingon again as he used to be. I must go and see how Arabella\ntakes his being a Radical. It's a little awkward; but a clergyman must\nkeep peace in a family. Confound it! I'm not bound to love Toryism\nbetter than my own flesh and blood, and the manor I shoot over. That's a\nheathenish, Brutus-like sort of thing, as if Providence couldn't take\ncare of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister's son!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n    'Twas town, yet country too: you felt the warmth\n    Of clustering houses in the wintry time:\n    Supped with a friend, and went by lantern home.\n    Yet from your chamber window you could hear\n    The tiny bleat of new-yeaned lambs, or see\n    The children bend beside the hedgerow banks\n    To pluck the primroses.\n\n\nTreby Magna, on which the Reform Bill had thrust the new honor of being\na polling-place, had been, at the beginning of the century, quite a\ntypical old market-town, lying in pleasant sleepiness among green\npastures, with a rush-fringed river meandering through them. Its\nprincipal street had various handsome and tall-windowed brick houses\nwith walled gardens behind them; and at the end, where it widened into\nthe market-place, there was the cheerful rough-stuccoed front of that\nexcellent inn, the Marquis of Granby, where the farmers put up their\ngigs, not only on fair and market days, but on exceptional Sundays when\nthey came to church. And the church was one of those fine old English\nstructures worth travelling to see, standing in a broad churchyard with\na line of solemn yew-trees beside it, and lifting a majestic tower and\nspire far above the red-and-purple roofs of the town. It was not large\nenough to hold all the parishioners of a parish which stretched over\ndistant villages and hamlets; but then they were never so unreasonable\nas to wish to be all in at once, and had never complained that the space\nof a large side-chapel was taken up by the tombs of the Debarrys, and\nshut in by a handsome iron screen. For when the black Benedictines\nceased to pray and chant in this church, when the Blessed Virgin and St.\nGregory were expelled, the Debarrys, as lords of the manor, naturally\ncame next to Providence and took the place of the saints. Long before\nthat time, indeed, there had been a Sir Maximus Debarry who had been at\nthe fortifying of the old castle, which now stood in ruins in the midst\nof the green pastures, and with its sheltering wall toward the north\nmade an excellent strawyard for the pigs of Wace & Co., brewers of the\ncelebrated Treby beer. Wace & Co. did not stand alone in the town as\nprosperous traders on a large scale, to say nothing of those who had\nretired from business; and in no country town of the same small size as\nTreby was there a larger proportion of families who had handsome sets of\nchina without handles, hereditary punch-bowls, and large silver ladles\nwith a Queen Anne's guinea in the centre. Such people naturally took tea\nand supped together frequently; and as there was no professional man or\ntradesman in Treby who was not connected by business, if not by blood,\nwith the farmers of the district, the richer sort of these were much\ninvited, and gave invitations in their turn. They played at whist, ate\nand drank generously, praised Mr. Pitt and the war as keeping up prices\nand religion, and were very humorous about each other's property, having\nmuch the same coy pleasure in allusions to their secret ability to\npurchase, as blushing lasses sometimes have in jokes about their secret\npreferences. The rector was always of the Debarry family, associated\nonly with county people, and was much respected for his affability; a\nclergyman who would have taken tea with the townspeople would have given\na dangerous shock to the mind of a Treby churchman.\n\nSuch was the old-fashioned, grazing, brewing, wool-packing,\ncheese-loading life of Treby Magna, until there befell new conditions,\ncomplicating its relation with the rest of the world, and gradually\nawakening in it that higher consciousness which is known to bring higher\npains. First came the canal; next, the working of the coal-mines at\nSproxton, two miles off the town; and thirdly, the discovery of a saline\nspring, which suggested to a too constructive brain the possibility of\nturning Treby Magna into a fashionable watering-place. So daring an idea\nwas not originated by a native Trebian, but by a young lawyer who came\nfrom a distance, knew the dictionary by heart, and was probably an\nillegitimate son of somebody or other. The idea, although it promised an\nincrease of wealth to the town, was not well received at first; ladies\nobjected to seeing \"objects\" drawn about in hand-carriages, the doctor\nforesaw the advent of unsound practitioners, and most retail tradesmen\nconcurred with him that new doings were usually for the advantage of new\npeople. The more unanswerable reasoners urged that Treby had prospered\nwithout baths, and it was yet to be seen how it would prosper with them;\nwhile a report that the proposed name for them was Bethesda Spa,\nthreatened to give the whole affair a blasphemous aspect. Even Sir\nMaximus Debarry, who was to have an unprecedented return for the\nthousands he would lay out on a pump-room and hotel, regarded the thing\nas a little too new, and held back for some time. But the persuasive\npowers of the young lawyer, Mr. Matthew Jermyn, together with the\nopportune opening of a stone-quarry, triumphed at last; the handsome\nbuildings were erected, an excellent guide-book and descriptive cards,\nsurmounted by vignettes, were printed, and Treby Magna became conscious\nof certain facts in its own history of which it had previously been in\ncontented ignorance.\n\nBut it was all in vain. The Spa, for some mysterious reason, did not\nsucceed. Some attributed the failure to the coal-mines and the canal;\nothers to the peace, which had had ruinous effects on the country; and\nothers, who disliked Jermyn, to the original folly of the plan. Among\nthese last was Sir Maximus himself, who never forgave the too persuasive\nattorney: it was Jermyn's fault not only that a useless hotel had been\nbuilt, but that he, Sir Maximus, being straitened for money, had at last\nlet the building, with the adjacent land lying on the river, on a long\nlease, on the supposition that it was to be turned into a tape\nmanufactory--a bitter thing to any gentleman, and especially to the\nrepresentative of one of the oldest families in England.\n\nIn this way it happened that Treby Magna gradually passed from being\nsimply a respectable market town--the heart of a great rural district,\nwhere the trade was only such as had close relations with the local\nlanded interest--and took on the more complex life brought by mines and\nmanufactures, which belong more directly to the great circulating system\nof the nation than to the local system to which they had been\nsuperadded; and in this way it was that Trebian Dissent gradually\naltered its character. Formerly it had been of a quiescent, well-to-do\nkind, represented architecturally by a small, venerable, dark-pewed\nchapel, built by Presbyterians, but long occupied by a sparse\ncongregation of Independents, who were as little moved by doctrinal zeal\nas their church-going neighbors, and did not feel themselves deficient\nin religious liberty, inasmuch as they were not hindered from\noccasionally slumbering in their pews, and were not obliged to go\nregularly to the weekly prayer-meeting. But when stone-pits and\ncoal-pits made new hamlets that threatened to spread up to the very\ntown, when the tape-weavers came with their news-reading inspectors and\nbook-keepers, the Independent chapel began to be filled with eager men\nand women, to whom the exceptional possession of religious truth was the\ncondition which reconciled them to a meagre existence, and made them\nfeel in secure alliance with the unseen but supreme rule of a world in\nwhich their own visible part was small. There were Dissenters in Treby\nnow who could not be regarded by the Church people in the light of old\nneighbors to whom the habit of going to chapel was an innocent,\nunenviable inheritance along with a particular house and garden, a\ntan-yard, or a grocery business--Dissenters who, in their turn, without\nmeaning to be in the least abusive, spoke of the high-bred rector as a\nblind leader of the blind. And Dissent was not the only thing that the\ntimes had altered; prices had fallen, poor-rates had risen, rent and\ntithe were not elastic enough, and the farmer's fat sorrow had become\nlean; he began to speculate on causes, and to trace things back to that\ncauseless mystery, the cessation of one-pound notes. Thus, when\npolitical agitation swept in a current through the country, Treby Magna\nwas prepared to vibrate. The Catholic Emancipation Bill opened the eyes\nof neighbors and made them aware how very injurious they were to each\nother and to the welfare of mankind generally. Mr. Tiliot, the Church\nspirit-merchant, knew now that Mr. Nuttwood, the obliging grocer, was\none of those Dissenters, Deists, Socinians, Papists, and Radicals, who\nwere in league to destroy the Constitution. A retired old London\ntradesman, who was believed to understand politics, said that thinking\npeople must wish George III were alive again in all his early vigor of\nmind: and even the farmers became less materialistic in their view of\ncauses, and referred much to the agency of the devil and the Irish\nRomans. The rector, the Reverend Augustus Debarry, really a fine\nspecimen of the old-fashioned aristocratic clergyman, preaching short\nsermons, understanding business, and acting liberally about his tithe,\nhad never before found himself in collision with Dissenters; but now he\nbegan to feel that these people were a nuisance in the parish, that his\nbrother Sir Maximus must take care lest they should get land to build\nmore chapels, and that it might not have been a bad thing if the law had\nfurnished him as a magistrate with a power of putting a stop to the\npolitical sermons of the Independent preacher, which, in their way,\nwere as pernicious sources of intoxication as the beerhouses. The\nDissenters, on their side, were not disposed to sacrifice the cause of\ntruth and freedom to a temporizing mildness of language; but they\ndefended themselves from the charge of religious indifference, and\nsolemnly disclaimed any lax expectations that Catholics were likely to\nbe saved--urging, on the contrary, that they were not too hopeful about\nProtestants who adhered to a bloated and worldly Prelacy. Thus Treby\nMagna, which had lived quietly through the great earthquakes of the\nFrench Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, which had remained unmoved by\nthe \"Rights of Man,\" and saw little in Mr. Cobbett's \"Weekly Register\"\nexcept that he held eccentric views about potatoes, began at last to\nknow the higher pains of a dim political consciousness; and the\ndevelopment had been greatly helped by the recent agitation about the\nReform Bill. Tory, Whig, and Radical did not perhaps become clearer in\ntheir definition of each other; but the names seemed to acquire so\nstrong a stamp of honor or infamy, that definitions would only have\nweakened the impression. As to the short and easy method of judging\nopinions by the personal character of those who held them, it was liable\nto be much frustrated in Treby. It so happened in that particular town\nthat the Reformers were not all of them large-hearted patriots or ardent\nlovers of justice; indeed, one of them, in the very midst of the\nagitation, was detected in using unequal scales--a fact to which many\nTories pointed with disgust as showing plainly enough, without further\nargument, that the cry for a change in the representative system was\nhollow trickery. Again, the Tories were far from being all oppressors,\ndisposed to grind down the working classes into serfdom; and it was\nundeniable that the inspector at the tape manufactory, who spoke with\nmuch eloquence on the extension of the suffrage, was a more tyrannical\npersonage than open-handed Mr. Wace, whose chief political tenet was\nthat it was all nonsense to give men votes when they had no stake in the\ncountry. On the other hand there were some Tories who gave themselves a\ngreat deal of leisure to abuse hypocrites, Radicals, Dissenters, and\natheism generally, but whose inflamed faces, theistic swearing, and\nfrankness in expressing a wish to borrow, certainly did not mark them\nout strongly as holding opinions likely to save society.\n\nThe Reformers had triumphed: it was clear that the wheels were going\nwhither they were pulling, and they were in fine spirits for exertion.\nBut if they were pulling toward the country's ruin, there was the more\nneed for others to hang on behind and get the wheels to stick if\npossible. In Treby, as elsewhere, people were told they must \"rally\" at\nthe coming election; but there was now a large number of waverers--men\nof flexible, practical minds, who were not such bigots as to cling to\nany views when a good tangible reason could be urged against them; while\nsome regarded it as the most neighborly thing to hold a little with both\nsides, and were not sure that they should rally or vote at all. It\nseemed an invidious thing to vote for one gentleman rather than another.\n\nThese social changes in Treby parish are comparatively public matters,\nand this history is chiefly concerned with the private lot of a few men\nand women; but there is no private life which has not been determined by\na wider public life, from the time when the primeval milkmaid had to\nwander with the wanderings of her clan, because the cow she milked was\none of a herd which had made the pastures bare. Even in that\nconservatory existence where the fair Camellia is sighed for by the\nnoble young Pine-apple, neither of them needing to care about the frost,\nor rain outside, there is a nether apparatus of hot water pipes liable\nto cool down on a strike of the gardeners or a scarcity of coal. And the\nlives we are about to look back upon do not belong to those conservatory\nspecies; they are rooted in the common earth, having to endure all the\nordinary chances of past and present weather. As to the weather of 1832,\nthe Zadkiel of that time had predicted that the electrical condition of\nthe clouds in the political hemisphere would produce unusual\nperturbations in organic existence, and he would perhaps have seen a\nfulfillment of his remarkable prophecy in that mutual influence of\ndissimilar destinies which we shall see gradually unfolding itself. For\nif the mixed political conditions of Treby Magna had not been acted on\nby the passing of the Reform Bill, Mr. Harold Transome would not have\npresented himself as a candidate for North Loamshire, Treby would not\nhave been a polling-place, Mr. Matthew Jermyn would not have been on\naffable terms with a Dissenting preacher and his flock, and the\nvenerable town would not have been placarded with handbills, more or\nless complimentary and retrospective--conditions in this case essential\nto the \"where,\" and the \"what,\" without which, as the learned know,\nthere can be no event whatever.\n\nFor example, it was through these conditions that a young man named\nFelix Holt made a considerable difference in the life of Harold\nTransome, though nature and fortune seemed to have done what they could\nto keep the lots of the two men quite aloof from each other. Felix was\nheir to nothing better than a quack medicine; his mother lived up a back\nstreet in Treby Magna, and her sitting-room was ornamented with her best\ntea-tray and several framed testimonials to the virtues of Holt's\nCathartic Lozenges and Holt's Restorative Elixir. There could hardly\nhave been a lot less like Harold Transome's than this of the quack\ndoctor's son, except in the superficial facts that he called himself a\nRadical, that he was the only son of his mother, and that he had lately\nreturned to his home with ideas and resolves not a little disturbing to\nthat mother's mind.\n\nBut Mrs. Holt, unlike Mrs. Transome, was much disposed to reveal her\ntroubles, and was not without a counsellor into whose ear she could pour\nthem. On this second of September, when Mr. Harold Transome had had his\nfirst interview with Jermyn, and when the attorney went back to his\noffice with new views of canvassing in his mind, Mrs. Holt had put on\nher bonnet as early as nine o'clock in the morning, and had gone to see\nthe Reverend Rufus Lyon, minister of the Independent Chapel usually\nspoken of as \"Malthouse Yard.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n    \"A pious and painful preacher.\"--FULLER.\n\n\nMr. Lyon lived in a small house, not quite so good as the parish\nclerk's, adjoining the entry which led to the Chapel Yard. The new\nprosperity of Dissent at Treby had led to an enlargement of the chapel,\nwhich absorbed all extra funds and left none for the enlargement of the\nminister's income. He sat this morning, as usual, in a low up-stairs\nroom, called his study, which, by means of a closet capable of holding\nhis bed, served also as a sleeping-room. The bookshelves did not suffice\nfor his store of old books, which lay about him in piles so arranged as\nto leave narrow lanes between them; for the minister was much given to\nwalking about during his hours of meditation, and very narrow passages\nwould serve for his small legs, unencumbered by any other drapery than\nhis black silk stockings and the flexible, though prominent, bows of\nblack ribbon that tied his knee-breeches. He was walking about now, with\nhis hands clasped behind him, an attitude in which his body seemed to\nbear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone\nHermes bears to the carven image that crowns it. His face looked old and\nworn, yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung\nabout his neck retained much of its original auburn tint, and his large,\nbrown, short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first\nglance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the\nfree-school boys often hooted after him, and called him \"Revelations\";\nand to many respectable Church people, old Lyon's little legs and large\nhead seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too\nshort-sighted to notice those who tittered at him--too absent from the\nworld of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live. With\nSatan to argue against on matters of vital experience as well as of\nchurch government, with great texts to meditate on, which seemed to get\ndeeper as he tried to fathom them, it had never occurred to him to\nreflect what sort of image his small person made on the retina of a\nlight-minded beholder. The good Rufus had his ire and his egoism; but\nthey existed only as the red heat which gave force to his belief and his\nteaching. He was susceptible concerning the true office of deacons in\nthe primitive Church, and his small nervous body was jarred from head to\nfoot by the concussion of an argument to which he saw no answer. In\nfact, the only moments when he could be said to be really conscious of\nhis body, were when he trembled under the pressure of some agitating\nthought.\n\nHe was meditating on the text for his Sunday morning sermon, \"And all\nthe people said, Amen\"--a mere mustard-seed of a text, which had split\nat first only into two divisions, \"What was said,\" and \"Who said it\";\nbut these were growing into a many-branched discourse, and the\npreacher's eyes dilated, and a smile played about his mouth till, as his\nmanner was, when he felt happily inspired, he had begun to utter his\nthoughts aloud in the varied measure and cadence habitual to him,\nchanging from a rapid but distinct undertone to a loud emphatic\n_rallentando_.\n\n\"My brethren, do you think that great shout was raised in Israel by each\nman's waiting to say 'amen' till his neighbors had said amen? Do you\nthink there will be a great shout for the right--the shout of a nation\nas of one man, rounded and whole, like the voice of the archangel that\nbound together all the listeners of earth and heaven--if every Christian\nof you peeps round to see what his neighbors in good coats are doing, or\nelse puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard?\nBut this is what you do: when the servant of God stands up to deliver\nhis message, do you lay your souls beneath the Word as you set out your\nplants beneath the falling rain? No; one of you sends his eyes to all\ncorners, he smothers his soul with small questions, 'What does brother\nY. think?' 'Is this doctrine high enough for brother Z.?' 'Will the\nchurch members be pleased?' And another----\"\n\nHere the door was opened, and old Lyddy, the minister's servant, put in\nher head to say, in a tone of despondency, finishing with a groan, \"Here\nis Mrs. Holt wanting to speak to you; she says she comes out of season,\nbut she's in trouble.\"\n\n\"Lyddy,\" said Mr. Lyon, falling at once into a quiet conversational\ntone, \"if you are wrestling with the enemy, let me refer you to Ezekiel\nthe thirteenth and twenty-second, and beg of you not to groan. It is a\nstumbling-block and offence to my daughter; she would take no broth\nyesterday, because she said you had cried into it. Thus you cause the\ntruth to be lightly spoken of, and make the enemy rejoice. If your\nfaceache gives him an advantage, take a little warm ale with your\nmeat--I do not grudge the money.\"\n\n\"If I thought my drinking warm ale would hinder poor dear Miss Esther\nfrom speaking light--but she hates the smell of it.\"\n\n\"Answer not again, Lyddy, but send up Mistress Holt to me.\"\n\nLyddy closed the door immediately.\n\n\"I lack grace to deal with these weak sisters,\" said the minister, again\nthinking aloud, and walking. \"Their needs lie too much out of the track\nof my meditations, and take me often unawares. Mistress Holt is another\nwho darkens counsel by words without knowledge, and angers the reason of\nthe natural man. Lord, give me patience. My sins were heavier to bear\nthan this woman's folly. Come in, Mrs. Holt--come in.\"\n\nHe hastened to disencumber a chair of Matthew Henry's Commentary, and\nbegged his visitor to be seated. She was a tall elderly woman, dressed\nin black, with a light-brown front and a black band over her forehead.\nShe moved the chair a little and seated herself in it with some\nemphasis, looking fixedly at the opposite wall with a hurt and\nargumentative expression. Mr. Lyon had placed himself in the chair\nagainst his desk, and waited with the resolute resignation of a patient\nwho is about to undergo an operation. But his visitor did not speak.\n\n\"You have something on your mind, Mrs. Holt?\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Indeed I have, sir, else I shouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\n\"It's well known to you, Mr. Lyon, that my husband, Mr. Holt, came from\nthe north, and was a member in Malthouse Yard long before _you_ began\nto be pastor of it, which was seven year ago last Michaelmas. It's the\ntruth, Mr. Lyon, and I'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it\nwasn't true.\"\n\n\"Certainly, it is true.\"\n\n\"And if my husband had been alive when you'd come to preach upon trial,\nhe'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as Mr. Nuttwood or Mr.\nMuscat, though whether he'd have agreed with some that your doctrine\nwasn't high enough, I can't say. For myself, I've my opinion about high\ndoctrine.\"\n\n\"Was it my preaching you came to speak about?\" said the minister,\nhurrying in the question.\n\n\"No, Mr. Lyon, I'm not that woman. But this I _will_ say, for my husband\ndied before your time, that he had a wonderful gift in prayer, as the\nold members well know, if anybody likes to ask 'em, not believing my\nwords, and he believed himself that the receipt for the Cancer Cure,\nwhich I've sent out in bottles till this very last April before\nSeptember as now is, and have bottles standing by me--he believed it was\nsent to him in answer to prayer; and nobody can deny it, for he prayed\nmost regular, and read out of the green baize Bible.\"\n\nMrs. Holt paused, appearing to think that Mr. Lyon had been successfully\nconfuted, and should show himself convinced.\n\n\"Has any one been aspersing your husband's character?\" said Mr. Lyon,\nwith a slight initiative toward that relief of groaning for which he had\nreproved Lyddy.\n\n\"Sir, they daredn't. For though he was a man of prayer, he didn't want\nskill and knowledge to find things out for himself; and that's what I\nused to say to _my_ friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from\nLancashire, with no trade nor fortune, but what he'd got in his head.\nBut my husband's tongue 'ud have been a fortune to anybody, and there\nwas many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk;\nnot but what that got him into trouble in Lancashire, but he always\nsaid, if the worst came to the worst, he could go and preach to the\nblacks. But he did better than that, Mr. Lyon, for he married me; and\nthis I will say, that for age, and conduct, and managing----\"\n\n\"Mistress Holt,\" interrupted the minister, \"these are not the things\nwhereby we may edify one another. Let me beg of you to be as brief as\nyou can. My time is not my own.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Lyon, I've a right to my own character; and I'm one of your\ncongregation, though I'm not a church member, for I was born in the\nGeneral Baptist connection: and as for being saved without works,\nthere's a many, I dare say, can't do without that doctrine; but I thank\nthe Lord I never needed to put _my_self on a level with the thief on the\ncross. I've done _my_ duty, and more, if anybody comes to that; for I've\ngone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbor: and if\nthere's any of the church members say they've done the same, I'd ask\nthem if they had the sinking at the stomach as I have; for I've ever\nstrove to do the right thing, and more, for good-natured I always was;\nand I little thought, after being respected by everybody, I should come\nto be reproached by my own son. And my husband said, when he was\na-dying--'Mary,' he said, 'the Elixir, and the Pills, and the Cure will\nsupport you, for they've a great name in all the country round, and\nyou'll pray for a blessing on them.' And so I've done, Mr. Lyon; and to\nsay they're not good medicines, when they've been taken for fifty miles\nround by high and low, rich and poor, and nobody speaking against 'em\nbut Dr. Lukin, it seems to me it's a flying in the face of Heaven; for\nif it was wrong to take the medicines, couldn't the blessed Lord have\nstopped it?\"\n\nMrs. Holt was not given to tears; she was much sustained by conscious\nunimpeachableness, and by an argumentative tendency which usually checks\nthe too great activity of the lachrymal gland; nevertheless her eyes had\nbecome moist, her fingers played on her knee in an agitated manner, and\nshe finally plucked a bit of her gown and held it with great nicety\nbetween her thumb and finger. Mr. Lyon, however, by listening\nattentively, had begun partly to divine the source of her trouble.\n\n\"Am I wrong in gathering from what you say, Mistress Holt, that your son\nhas objected in some way to your sale of your late husband's medicines?\"\n\n\"Mr. Lyon, he's masterful beyond everything, and he talks more than his\nfather did. I've got my reason, Mr. Lyon, and if anybody talks sense I\ncan follow him; but Felix talks so wild, and contradicts his mother. And\nwhat do you think he says, after giving up his 'prenticeship, and going\noff to study at Glasgow, and getting through all the bit of money his\nfather saved for his bringing-up--what has all his learning come to? He\nsays I'd better never open my Bible, for it's as bad poison to me as the\npills are to half the people as swallow 'em. You'll not speak of this\nagain, Mr. Lyon--I don't think ill enough of you to believe _that_. For\nI suppose a Christian can understand the word o' God without going to\nGlasgow, and there's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine, and\nthere's one as might have been for a receipt of my husband's--it's just\nas if it was a riddle, and Holt's Elixir was the answer.\"\n\n\"Your son uses rash words, Mistress Holt,\" said the minister, \"but it is\nquite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the\nScripture. The word of God has to satisfy the larger needs of His\npeople, like the rain and the sunshine--which no man must think to be\nmeant for his own patch of seed-ground solely. Will it not be well that\nI should see your son, and talk with him on these matters? He was at\nchapel, I observe, and I suppose I am to be his pastor.\"\n\n\"That was what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Lyon. For perhaps he'll listen\nto you, and not talk you down as he does his poor mother. For after we'd\nbeen to chapel, he spoke better of you than he does of most: he said you\nwas a fine old fellow, and an old-fashioned Puritan--he uses dreadful\nlanguage, Mr. Lyon; but I saw he didn't mean you ill, for all that. He\ncalls most folks's religion rottenness; and yet another time he'll tell\nme I ought to feel myself a sinner, and do God's will and not my own.\nBut it's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to\nabuse his mother. Or else he's going off his head, and must be sent to a\n'sylum. But if he writes to the _North Loamshire Herald_ first, to tell\neverybody the medicines are good for nothing, how can I ever keep him\nand myself?\"\n\n\"Tell him I shall feel favored if he will come and see me this evening,\"\nsaid Mr. Lyon, not without a little prejudice in favor of the young man,\nwhose language about the preacher in Malthouse Yard did not seem to him\nto be altogether dreadful. \"Meanwhile, my friend, I counsel you to send\nup a supplication, which I shall not fail to offer also, that you may\nreceive a spirit of humility and submission, so that you may not be\nhindered from seeing and following the Divine guidance in this matter by\nany false lights of pride and obstinacy. Of this more when I have spoken\nwith your son.\"\n\n\"I'm not proud or obstinate, Mr. Lyon. I never did say I was everything\nthat was bad, and I never will. And why this trouble should be sent on\nme above everybody else--for I haven't told you all. He's made himself a\njourneyman to Mr. Prowd the watchmaker--after all this learning--and he\nsays he'll go with patches on his knees, and he shall like himself the\nbetter. And as for him having little boys to teach, they'll come in all\nweathers with dirty shoes. If it's madness, Mr. Lyon, it's no use your\ntalking to him.\"\n\n\"We shall see. Perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace\nwithin him. We must not judge rashly. Many eminent servants of God have\nbeen led by ways as strange.\"\n\n\"Then I'm sorry for their mothers, that's all, Mr. Lyon; and all the\nmore if they'd been well-spoken-on women. For not my biggest enemy,\nwhether it's he or she, if they'll speak the truth, can turn round and\nsay I've deserved this trouble. And when everybody gets their due, and\npeople's doings are spoke of on the house-tops, as the Bible says they\nwill be, it'll be known what I've gone through with those medicines--the\npounding and the pouring, and the letting stand, and the weighing--up\nearly and down late--there's nobody knows yet but One that's worthy to\nknow; and the pasting o' the printed labels right side upwards. There's\nfew women would have gone through with it; and it's reasonable to think\nit'll be made up to me; for if there's promised and purchased blessings,\nI should think this trouble is purchasing 'em. For if my son Felix\ndoesn't have a strait-waistcoat put on him, he'll have his way. But I\nsay no more. I wish you good-morning, Mr. Lyon, and thank you, though I\nwell know it's your duty to act as you're doing. And I never troubled\nyou about my own soul, as some do who look down on me for not being a\nchurch member.\"\n\n\"Farewell, Mistress Holt, farewell. I pray that a more powerful teacher\nthan I am may instruct you.\"\n\nThe door was closed, and the much-tried Rufus walked about again, saying\naloud, groaningly--\n\n\"This woman has sat under the Gospel all her life, and she is as blind\nas a heathen, and as proud and stiff-necked as a Pharisee; yet she is\none of the souls I watch for. 'Tis true that even Sara, the chosen\nmother of God's people, showed a spirit of unbelief, and perhaps of\nselfish anger; and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet,\n'doing honor to the wife or woman, as unto the weaker vessel.' For\ntherein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural\nman.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n    1ST CITIZEN. Sir, there's a hurry in the veins of youth\n                 That makes a vice of virtue by excess.\n\n    2D CITIZEN.  What if the coolness of our tardier veins\n                 Be loss of virtue?\n\n    1ST CITIZEN.                      All things cool with time--\n                 The sun itself, they say, till heat shall find\n                 A general level, nowhere in excess.\n\n    2D CITIZEN.  'Tis a poor climax, to my weaker thought,\n                 That future middlingness.\n\n\nIn the evening, when Mr. Lyon was expecting the knock at the door that\nwould announce Felix Holt, he occupied his cushionless arm-chair in the\nsitting-room, and was skimming rapidly, in his short-sighted way, by the\nlight of one candle, the pages of a missionary report, emitting\noccasionally a slight \"Hm-m\" that appeared to be expressive of criticism\nrather than of approbation. The room was dismally furnished, the only\nobjects indicating an intention of ornament being a bookcase, a map of\nthe Holy Land, an engraved portrait of Dr. Doddridge, and a black bust\nwith a colored face, which for some reason or other was covered with\ngreen gauze. Yet any one whose attention was quite awake must have been\naware, even on entering, of certain things that were incongruous with\nthe general air of sombreness and privation. There was a delicate scent\nof dried rose-leaves; the light by which the minister was reading was a\nwax-candle in a white earthenware candle-stick, and the table on the\nopposite side of the fireplace held a dainty work-basket frilled with\nblue satin.\n\nFelix Holt, when he entered, was not in an observant mood; and when,\nafter seating himself, at the minister's invitation, near the little\ntable which held the work-basket, he stared at the wax-candle opposite\nto him, he did so without any wonder or consciousness that the candle\nwas not of tallow. But the minister's sensitiveness gave another\ninterpretation to the gaze which he divined rather than saw; and in\nalarm lest this inconsistent extravagance should obstruct his\nusefulness, he hastened to say--\n\n\"You are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax-light, my young friend;\nbut this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter, who\nis so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her.\"\n\n\"I heeded not the candle, sir. I thank Heaven I am not a mouse to have a\nnose that takes note of wax or tallow.\"\n\nThe loud abrupt tones made the old man vibrate a little. He had been\nstroking his chin gently before, with a sense that he must be very\nquiet and deliberate in his treatment of the eccentric young man; but\nnow, quite unreflectingly, he drew forth a pair of spectacles, which he\nwas in the habit of using when he wanted to observe his interlocutor\nmore closely than usual.\n\n\"And I myself, in fact, am equally indifferent,\" he said, as he opened\nand adjusted his glasses, \"so that I have a sufficient light on my\nbook.\" Here his large eyes looked discerningly through the spectacles.\n\n\"'Tis the quality of the page you care about, not of the candle,\" said\nFelix, smiling pleasantly enough at his inspector. \"You're thinking that\nyou have a roughly-written page before you now.\"\n\nThat was true. The minister, accustomed to the respectable air of\nprovincial townsmen, and especially to the sleek well-clipped gravity of\nhis own male congregation, felt a slight shock as his glasses made\nperfectly clear to him the shaggy-headed, large-eyed, strong-limbed\nperson of this questionable young man, without waistcoat or cravat. But\nthe possibility, supported by some of Mrs. Holt's words, that a\ndisguised work of grace might be going on in the son of whom she\ncomplained so bitterly, checked any hasty interpretations.\n\n\"I abstain from judging by the outward appearance only,\" he answered,\nwith his usual simplicity. \"I myself have experienced that when the\nspirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neck-bands and\nstrings and such small accidents of our vesture, which are nevertheless\ndecent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh. And you, too, my\nyoung friend, as I gather from your mother's troubled and confused\nreport, are undergoing some travail of mind. You will not, I trust,\nobject to open yourself fully to me, as to an aged pastor who has\nhimself had much inward wrestling, and has especially known much\ntemptation from doubt.\"\n\n\"As to doubt,\" said Felix, loudly and brusquely as before, \"if it is\nthose absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has\nbeen talking of to you--and I suppose it is--I've no more doubt about\n_them_ than I have about pocket-picking. I know there's a stage of\nspeculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is\nblameworthy--but I'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at\nthe world through their own legs. If I allowed the sale of those\nmedicines to go on, and my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can\nkeep her by the honest labor of my hands, I've not the least doubt that\nI should be a rascal.\"\n\n\"I would fain enquire more particularly into your objection to these\nmedicines,\" said Mr. Lyon, gravely. Notwithstanding his\nconscientiousness and a certain originality in his own mental\ndisposition, he was too little used to high principle quite dissociated\nfrom sectarian phraseology to be as immediately in sympathy with it as\nhe would otherwise have been. \"I know they have been well reported of,\nand many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by\nthose who are not regular physicians, and have found a blessing in the\nuse of them. I may mention the eminent Mr. Wesley, who, though I hold\nnot altogether with his Arminian doctrine, nor with the usages of his\ninstitutions, was nevertheless a man of God; and the journals of various\nChristians whose names have left a sweet savor, might be cited in the\nsame sense. Moreover, your father, who originally concocted these\nmedicines and left them as a provision for your mother, was, as I\nunderstand, a man whose walk was not unfaithful.\"\n\n\"My father was ignorant,\" said Felix, bluntly. \"He knew neither the\ncomplication of the human system, nor the way in which drugs counteract\neach other. Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug, but when it\nprescribes pills it may happen to do more harm. I know something about\nthese things. I was 'prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute\nof a country apothecary--my poor father left money for that--he thought\nnothing could be finer for me. No matter: I know that the Cathartic\nPills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the\npeople who swallow them; that the Elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen\nincompatible things; and that the Cancer Cure might as well be bottled\nditch-water.\"\n\nMr. Lyon rose and walked up and down the room. His simplicity was\nstrongly mixed with sagacity as well as sectarian prejudice, and he did\nnot rely at once on a loud-spoken integrity--Satan might have flavored\nit with ostentation. Presently he asked, in a rapid, low tone, \"How long\nhave you known this, young man?\"\n\n\"Well put, sir,\" said Felix. \"I've known it a good deal longer than I\nhave acted upon it, like plenty of other things. But you believe in\nconversion?\"\n\n\"Yea, verily.\"\n\n\"So do I. I was converted by six weeks' debauchery.\"\n\nThe minister started. \"Young man,\" he said, solemnly, going up close to\nFelix and laying a hand on his shoulder, \"speak not lightly of the\nDivine operations, and restrain unseemly words.\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking lightly,\" said Felix. \"If I had not seen that I was\nmaking a hog of myself very fast, and that pig-wash, even if I could\nhave got plenty of it, was a poor sort of thing, I should never have\nlooked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it. I\nlaughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me, in a Scotch\ngarret, with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be\ndissipated upon, with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below, and old\nwomen breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs--wanting to turn my\nlife into easy pleasure. Then I began to see what else it could be\nturned into. Not much, perhaps. This world is not a very fine place for\na good many of the people in it. But I've made up my mind it shan't be\nthe worse for me, if I can help it. They may tell me I can't alter the\nworld--that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it,\nand if I don't lie and filch somebody else will. Well then, somebody\nelse shall, for I won't. That's the upshot of my conversion, Mr. Lyon,\nif you want to know it.\"\n\nMr. Lyon removed his hand from Felix's shoulder and walked about again.\n\"Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow, young man?\"\n\n\"No: I heard most of the preachers once, but I never wanted to hear them\ntwice.\"\n\nThe good Rufus was not without a slight rising of resentment at this\nyoung man's want of reverence. It was not yet plain whether he wanted to\nhear twice the preacher in Malthouse Yard. But the resentful feeling was\ncarefully repressed: a soul in so peculiar a condition must be dealt\nwith delicately.\n\n\"And now, may I ask,\" he said, \"what course you mean to take, after\nhindering your mother from making and selling these drugs? I speak no\nmore in their favor after what you have said. God forbid that I should\nstrive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and\nhonorable. But your mother is advanced in years; she needs comfortable\nsustenance; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends?\n'He that provideth not for his own----' I trust you respect the\nauthority that so speaks. And I will not suppose that, after being\ntender of conscience toward strangers, you will be careless toward your\nmother. There be indeed some who, taking a mighty charge on their\nshoulder, must perforce leave their households to Providence, and to the\ncare of humbler brethren, but in such a case the call must be clear.\"\n\n\"I shall keep my mother as well--nay, better--than she has kept herself.\nShe has always been frugal. With my watch and clock cleaning, and\nteaching one or two little chaps that I've got to come to me, I can earn\nenough. As for me, I can live on bran porridge. I have the stomach of a\nrhinoceros.\"\n\n\"But for a young man so well furnished as you, who can questionless\nwrite a good hand and keep books, were it not well to seek some higher\nsituation as clerk or assistant? I could speak to Brother Muscat, who is\nwell acquainted with all such openings. Any place in Pendrell's Bank, I\nfear, is now closed against such as are not Churchmen. It used not to be\nso, but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin, although he was a\nvaluable servant. Still, something might be found. There are ranks and\ndegrees--and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly\nchange what seems to be a providential appointment. Your poor mother is\nnot altogether----\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Lyon; I've had all that out with my mother, and I may as\nwell save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up\nabout that a long while ago. I'll take no employment that obliges me to\nprop up my chin with a high cravat, and wear straps, and pass the\nlivelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt\npins. That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts; it only\nhappens to be paid out of proportion. That's why I set myself to learn\nthe watchmaking trade. My father was a weaver first of all. It would\nhave been better for him if he had remained a weaver. I came home\nthrough Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still. I\nmean to stick to the class I belong to--people who don't follow the\nfashions.\"\n\nMr. Lyon was silent a few moments. This dialogue was far from plain\nsailing; he was not certain of his latitude and longitude. If the\ndespiser of Glasgow preachers had been arguing in favor of gin and\nSabbath-breaking, Mr. Lyon's course would have been clearer. \"Well,\nwell,\" he said, deliberately, \"it is true that St. Paul exercised the\ntrade of tent-making, though he was learned in all the wisdom of the\nRabbis.\"\n\n\"St. Paul was a wise man,\" said Felix. \"Why should I want to get into\nthe middle class because I have some learning? The most of the middle\nclass are as ignorant as the working people about everything that\ndoesn't belong to their own Brummagem life. That's how the workingmen\nare left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves: the best\nheads among them forsake their boon comrades, and go in for a house with\na high door-step and a brass knocker.\"\n\nMr. Lyon stroked his mouth and chin, perhaps because he felt some\ndisposition to smile; and it would not be well to smile too readily at\nwhat seemed but a weedy resemblance of Christian unworldliness. On the\ncontrary, there might be a dangerous snare in an unsanctified\noutstepping of average Christian practice.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he observed, gravely, \"it is by such self-advancement\nthat many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty\nand to the public well-being. The ring and the robe of Joseph were no\nobjects for a good man's ambition, but they were the signs of that\ncredit which he won by his divinely-inspired skill, and which enabled\nhim to act as a saviour to his brethren.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, your ringed and scented men of the people!--I won't be one of\nthem. Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock, and he'll get\nnew wants and new motives. Metamorphosis will have begun at his\nneck-joint, and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and\nthen his reasoning, which will follow his likings as the feet of a\nhungry dog follow his nose. I'll have none of your clerkly gentility. I\nmight end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine\ncoat and a glutton's dinner, on pretence of serving the poor men. I'd\nsooner be Paley's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach,\nthough\"--here Felix changed his voice a little--\"I should like well\nenough to be another sort of demagogue, if I could.\"\n\n\"Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of\nthese times?\" said Mr. Lyon, with a perceptible flashing of the eyes.\n\n\"I should think so. I despise every man who has not--or, having it,\ndoesn't try to rouse it in other men.\"\n\n\"Right, my young friend, right,\" said the minister, in a deep cordial\ntone. Inevitably his mind was drawn aside from the immediate\nconsideration of Felix Holt's spiritual interest by the prospect of\npolitical sympathy. In those days so many instruments of God's cause in\nthe fight for religious and political liberty held creeds that were\npainfully wrong, and, indeed, irreconcilable with salvation! \"That is\nmy own view, which I maintain in the face of some opposition from\nbrethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to\nthe closer walk, and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their\nduties as members of the commonwealth. I have had much puerile blame\ncast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and\nWellington in the pulpit. Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh? and\nwhy not Brougham as well as Balaam? Does God know less of men than He\ndid in the days of Hezekiah and Moses?--is His arm shortened, and is the\nworld become too wide for His providence? But, they say, there are no\npolitics in the New Testament----\"\n\n\"Well, they're right enough there,\" said Felix, with his usual\nunceremoniousness.\n\n\"What! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not\nmeddle with public matters in the pulpit?\" said Mr. Lyon, coloring. \"I\nam ready to join issue on that point.\"\n\n\"Not I, sir,\" said Felix; \"I should say, teach any truth you can,\nwhether it's in the Testament or out of it. It's little enough anybody\ncan get hold of, and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a\npence-counting, parcel-tying generation, such as mostly fill your\nchapels.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said Mr. Lyon, pausing in front of Felix. He spoke rapidly,\nas he always did, except when his words were specially weighted with\nemotion: he overflowed with matter, and in his mind matter was always\ncompletely organized into words. \"I speak not on my own behalf, for not\nonly have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which\nhe seeth me to be, but I am aware of much that should make me patient\nunder a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction. I speak not\nas claiming reverence for my own age and office--not to shame you, but\nto warn you. It is good that you should use plainness of speech, and I\nam not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young,\nthat they themselves, being elders, may be heard at large; but Elihu was\nthe youngest of Job's friends, yet was there a wise rebuke in his words;\nand the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel. I have to\nkeep a special watch over myself in this matter, inasmuch as I have need\nof utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent-up fire,\nuntil I have shot it forth, as it were, in arrowy words, each one\nhitting its mark. Therefore I pray for a listening spirit, which is a\ngreat mark of grace. Nevertheless, my young friend, I am bound, as I\nsaid, to warn you. The temptations that most beset those who have great\nnatural gifts, and are wise after the flesh, are pride and scorn, more\nparticularly toward those weak things of the world which have been\nchosen to confound the things which are mighty. The scornful nostril and\nthe high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth. The\nmind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is----\"\n\nHere the door opened, and Mr. Lyon paused to look around, but seeing\nonly Lyddy with the tea-tray, he went on--\n\n\"Is, I may say, as a clenched fist that can give blows, but is shut up\nfrom receiving and holding aught that is precious--though it were\nheaven-sent manna.\"\n\n\"I understand you, sir,\" said Felix, good-humoredly, putting out his\nhand to the little man, who had come close to him as he delivered the\nlast sentence with sudden emphasis and slowness. \"But I'm not inclined\nto clench my fist at you.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Mr. Lyon, shaking the proffered hand, \"we shall see\nmore of each other, and I trust shall have much profitable communing.\nYou will stay and have a dish of tea with us: we take the meal late on\nThursdays, because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the\nFrench tongue. But she is doubtless returned now, and will presently\ncome and pour out tea for us.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I'll stay,\" said Felix, not from any curiosity to see the\nminister's daughter, but from a liking for the society of the minister\nhimself--for his quaint looks and ways, and the transparency of his\ntalk, which gave a charm even to his weakness. The daughter was probably\nsome prim Miss, neat, sensible, pious, but all in a small feminine way,\nin which Felix was no more interested than in Dorcas meetings,\nbiographies of devout women, and that amount of ornamental knitting\nwhich was not inconsistent with Non-conforming seriousness.\n\n\"I'm perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing,\" he went on: \"a\nphrenologist at Glasgow told me I had large veneration; another man\nthere, who knew me, laughed out and said I was the most blasphemous\niconoclast living. 'That,' says my phrenologist, 'is because of his\nlarge ideality, which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough\nto be venerated.' Of course I put my ears down and wagged my tail at\nthat stroking.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I have had my own head explored with somewhat similar\nresults. It is, I fear, but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen\nprecept, 'Know thyself,' and too often leads to a self-estimate which\nwill subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality of\nthe tree is made evident. Nevertheless----Esther, my dear, this is Mr.\nHolt, whose acquaintance I have now been making with more than ordinary\ninterest. He will take tea with us.\"\n\nEsther bowed slightly as she walked across the room to fetch the candle\nand place it near her tray. Felix rose and bowed, also with an air of\nindifference, which was perhaps exaggerated by the fact that he was\ninwardly surprised. The minister's daughter was not the sort of person\nhe expected. She was quite incongruous with his notion of ministers'\ndaughters in general; and though he had expected something nowise\ndelightful, the incongruity repelled him. A very delicate scent, the\nfaint suggestion of a garden, was wafted as she went. He would not\nobserve her, but he had a sense of an elastic walk, the tread of small\nfeet, a long neck and a high crown of shining brown plaits and curls\nthat floated backward--things, in short, that suggested a fine lady to\nhim, and determined him to notice her as little as possible. A fine lady\nwas always a sort of spun-glass affair--not natural, and with no beauty\nfor him as art; but a fine lady as the daughter of this rusty old\nPuritan was especially offensive.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" continued Mr. Lyon, who rarely let drop any thread of\ndiscourse, \"that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the\nrevealed dispensations. And it is undeniable that we have our varying\nnative dispositions which even grace will not obliterate. I myself, from\nmy youth up, have been given to question too curiously concerning the\ntruth--to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply\nit.\"\n\n\"If your truth happens to be such medicine as Holt's Pills and Elixir,\nthe less you swallow of it the better,\" said Felix. \"But truth-vendors\nand medicine-vendors usually recommend swallowing. When a man sees his\nlivelihood in a pill or a proposition, he likes to have orders for the\ndose, and not curious enquiries.\"\n\nThis speech verged on rudeness, but it was delivered with a brusque\nopenness that implied the absence of any personal intention. The\nminister's daughter was now for the first time startled into looking at\nFelix. But her survey of this unusual speaker was soon made, and she\nrelieved her father from the need to reply by saying--\n\n\"The tea is poured out, father.\"\n\nThat was the signal for Mr. Lyon to advance toward the table, raise his\nright hand, and ask a blessing at sufficient length for Esther to glance\nat the visitor again. There seemed to be no danger of his looking at\nher: he was observing her father. She had time to remark that he was a\npeculiar looking person, but not insignificant, which was the quality\nthat most hopelessly consigned a man to perdition. He was massively\nbuilt. The striking points in his face were large clear gray eyes and\nfull lips.\n\n\"Will you draw up to the table, Mr. Holt?\" said the minister.\n\nIn the act of rising, Felix pushed back his chair too suddenly against\nthe rickety table close by him, and down went the blue-frilled\nwork-basket, flying open, and dispersing on the floor reels, thimble,\nmuslin-work, a small sealed bottle of attar of rose, and something\nheavier than these--a duodecimo volume which fell near him between the\ntable and the fender.\n\n\"Oh, my stars!\" said Felix, \"I beg your pardon.\" Esther had already\nstarted up, and with wonderful quickness had picked up half the small\nrolling things while Felix was lifting the basket and the book. This\nlast had opened, and had its leaves crushed in falling; and, with the\ninstinct of a bookish man, he saw nothing more pressing to be done than\nto flatten the corners of the leaves.\n\n\"Byron's Poems!\" he said, in a tone of disgust, while Esther was\nrecovering all the other articles. \"'The Dream'--he'd better have been\nasleep and snoring. What! do you stuff your memory with Byron, Miss\nLyon?\"\n\nFelix on his side, was led at last to look straight at Esther, but it\nwas with a strong denunciatory and pedagogic intention. Of course he saw\nmore clearly than ever that she was a fine lady.\n\nShe reddened, drew up her long neck, and said, as she retreated to her\nchair again--\n\n\"I have a great admiration for Byron.\"\n\nMr. Lyon had paused in the act of drawing his chair to the tea table,\nand was looking on at this scene, wrinkling the corners of his eyes with\na perplexed smile. Esther would not have wished him to know anything\nabout the volume of Byron, but she was too proud to show any concern.\n\n\"He is a worldly and vain writer, I fear,\" said Mr. Lyon. He knew\nscarcely anything of the poet, whose books embodied the faith and ritual\nof many young ladies and gentlemen.\n\n\"A misanthropic debauchee,\" said Felix, lifting a chair with one hand,\nand holding the book open in the other, \"whose notion of a hero was\nthat he should disorder his stomach and despise mankind. His corsairs\nand renegades, his Alps and Manfreds, are the most paltry puppets that\nwere ever pulled by the strings of lust and pride.\"\n\n\"Hand the book to me,\" said Mr. Lyon.\n\n\"Let me beg of you to put it aside till after tea, father,\" said Esther.\n\"However objectionable Mr. Holt may find its pages, they would certainly\nbe made worse by being greased with bread-and-butter.\"\n\n\"That is true, my dear,\" said Mr. Lyon, laying down the book on the\nsmall table behind him. He saw that his daughter was angry.\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" thought Felix, \"her father is frightened at her. How came he\nto have such a nice-stepping, long-necked peacock for his daughter? but\nshe shall see that I am not frightened.\" Then he said aloud, \"I should\nlike to know how you will justify your admiration for such a writer,\nMiss Lyon.\"\n\n\"I should not attempt it with you, Mr. Holt,\" said Esther. \"You have\nsuch strong words at command that they make the smallest argument seem\nformidable. If I had ever met the giant Cormoran, I should have made a\npoint of agreeing with him in his literary opinions.\"\n\nEsther had that excellent thing in woman, a soft voice with clear fluent\nutterance. Her sauciness was always charming because it was without\nemphasis, and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head.\n\nFelix laughed at her thrust with young heartiness.\n\n\"My daughter is a critic of words, Mr. Holt,\" said the minister, smiling\ncomplacently, \"and often corrects mine on the ground of niceties, which\nI profess are as dark to me as if they were the reports of a sixth sense\nwhich I possess not. I am an eager seeker for precision, and would fain\nfind language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the\nsoul's pathways, but I see not why a round word that means some object,\nmade and blessed by the Creator, should be branded and banished as a\nmalefactor.\"\n\n\"Oh, your niceties--I know what they are,\" said Felix, in his usual\n_fortissimo_. \"They'll go on your system of make-believe. 'Rottenness'\nmay suggest what is unpleasant, so you'd better say 'sugar-plums,' or\nsomething else such a long way off the fact that nobody is obliged to\nthink of it. Those are your roundabout euphuisms that dress up swindling\ntill it looks as well as honesty, and shoot with boiled peas instead of\nbullets. I hate your gentlemanly speakers.\"\n\n\"Then you would not like Mr. Jermyn, I think,\" said Esther. \"That\nreminds me, father, that to-day, when I was giving Miss Louisa Jermyn\nher lesson, Mr. Jermyn came in and spoke to me with grand politeness,\nand asked me at what times you were likely to be disengaged, because he\nwished to make your better acquaintance, and consult you on matters of\nimportance. He never took the least notice of me before. Can you guess\nthe reason of his sudden ceremoniousness?\"\n\n\"Nay, child,\" said the minister, ponderingly.\n\n\"Politics, of course,\" said Felix. \"He's on some committee. An election\nis coming. Universal peace is declared, and the foxes have a sincere\ninterest in prolonging the lives of the poultry. Eh, Mr. Lyon? Isn't\nthat it?\"\n\n\"Nay, not so. He is the close ally of the Transome family, who are blind\nhereditary Tories like the Debarrys, and will drive their tenants to the\npoll as if they were sheep, and it has even been hinted that the heir\nwho is coming from the East may be another Tory candidate, and coalesce\nwith the younger Debarry. It is said that he has enormous wealth, and\ncould purchase every vote in the county that has a price.\"\n\n\"He is come,\" said Esther. \"I heard Miss Jermyn tell her sister that she\nhad seen him going out of her father's room.\"\n\n\"'Tis strange,\" said Mr. Lyon.\n\n\"Something extraordinary must have happened,\" said Esther, \"for Mr.\nJermyn to intend courting us. Miss Jermyn said to me only the other day\nthat she could not think how I came to be so well educated and ladylike.\nShe always thought Dissenters were ignorant, vulgar people. I said, so\nthey were, usually, and Church people also in small towns. She considers\nherself a judge of what is ladylike, and she is vulgarity\npersonified--with large feet, and the most odious scent on her\nhandkerchief, and a bonnet that looks like 'The Fashion' printed in\ncapital letters.\"\n\n\"One sort of fine-ladyism is as good as another,\" said Felix.\n\n\"No, indeed. Pardon me,\" said Esther. \"A real fine-lady does not wear\nclothes that flare in people's eyes, or use importunate scents, or make\na noise as she moves: she is something refined and graceful, and\ncharming, and never obtrusive.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Felix, contemptuously. \"And she reads Byron also, and\nadmires Childe Harold--gentlemen of unspeakable woes, who employ a\nhairdresser, and look seriously at themselves in the glass.\"\n\nEsther reddened, and gave a little toss. Felix went on triumphantly. \"A\nfine-lady is a squirrel-headed thing, with small airs, and small\nnotions, about as applicable to the business of life as a pair of\ntweezers to the clearing of a forest. Ask your father what those old\npersecuted emigrant Puritans would have done with fine-lady wives and\ndaughters.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no danger of such _m\u00c3\u00a9salliances_,\" said Esther. \"Men who\nare unpleasant companions and make frights of themselves, are sure to\nget wives tasteless enough to suit them.\"\n\n\"Esther, my dear,\" said Mr. Lyon, \"let not your playfulness betray you\ninto disrespect toward those venerable pilgrims. They struggled and\nendured in order to cherish and plant anew the seeds of a scriptural\ndoctrine and of a pure discipline.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Esther, hastily, dreading a discourse on the pilgrim\nfathers.\n\n\"Oh, they were an ugly lot!\" Felix burst in, making Mr. Lyon start.\n\"Miss Medora wouldn't have minded if they had all been put into the\npillory and lost their ears. She would have said, 'Their ears did stick\nout so.' I shouldn't wonder if that's a bust of one of them.\" Here\nFelix, with sudden keenness of observation, nodded at the black bust\nwith the gauze over its colored face.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Lyon, \"that is the eminent George Whitfield, who, you\nwell know, had a gift of oratory as of one on whom the tongue of flame\nhad rested visibly. But Providence--doubtless for wise ends in relation\nto the inner man, for I would not enquire too closely into minuti\u00c3\u00a6 which\ncarry too many plausible interpretations for any one of them to be\nstable--Providence, I say, ordained that the good man should squint; and\nmy daughter has not yet learned to bear with his infirmity.\"\n\n\"She has put a veil over it. Suppose you had squinted yourself?\" said\nFelix, looking at Esther.\n\n\"Then, doubtless, you could have been more polite to me, Mr. Holt,\" said\nEsther, rising and placing herself at her work-table. \"You seem to\nprefer what is unusual and ugly.\"\n\n\"A peacock!\" thought Felix. \"I should like to come and scold her every\nday, and make her cry and cut her fine hair off.\"\n\nFelix rose to go, and said, \"I will not take up any more of your\nvaluable time, Mr. Lyon. I know that you have not many spare evenings.\"\n\n\"That is true, my young friend; for I now go to Sproxton one evening in\nthe week. I do not despair that we may some day need a chapel there,\nthough the hearers do not multiply save among the women, and there is no\nwork as yet begun among the miners themselves. I shall be glad of your\ncompany in my walk thither to-morrow at five o'clock, if you would like\nto see how that population has grown of late years.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've been to Sproxton already several times. I had a congregation\nof my own there last Sunday evening.\"\n\n\"What! do you preach?\" said Mr. Lyon, with brightened glance.\n\n\"Not exactly. I went to the ale-house.\"\n\nMr. Lyon started. \"I trust you are putting a riddle to me, young man,\neven as Samson did to his companions. From what you said but lately, it\ncannot be that you are given to tippling and to taverns.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't drink much. I order a pint of beer, and I get into talk\nwith the fellows over their pots and pipes. Somebody must take a little\nknowledge and common-sense to them in this way, else how are they to get\nit? I go for educating the non-electors, so I put myself in the way of\nmy pupils--my academy is the beer-house. I'll walk with you to-morrow\nwith pleasure.\"\n\n\"Do so, do so,\" said Mr. Lyon, shaking hands with his odd acquaintance.\n\"We shall understand each other better by-and-by, I doubt not.\"\n\n\"I wish you good-evening, Miss Lyon.\"\n\nEsther bowed very slightly, without speaking.\n\n\"That is a singular young man, Esther,\" said the minister, walking about\nafter Felix was gone. \"I discern in him a love for whatsoever things are\nhonest and true, which I would fain believe to be an earnest of further\nendowment with the wisdom that is from on high. It is true that, as the\ntraveller in the desert is often lured, by a false vision of water and\nfreshness, to turn aside from the track which leads to the tried and\nestablished fountains, so the Evil One will take advantage of a natural\nyearning toward the better, to delude the soul with a self-flattering\nbelief in a visionary virtue, higher than the ordinary fruits of the\nSpirit. But I trust it is not so here. I feel a great enlargement in\nthis young man's presence, notwithstanding a certain license in his\nlanguage, which I shall use my efforts to correct.\"\n\n\"I think he is very coarse and rude,\" said Esther, with a touch of\ntemper in her voice. \"But he speaks better English than most of our\nvisitors. What is his occupation?\"\n\n\"Watch and clock making, by which, together with a little teaching, as I\nunderstand, he hopes to maintain his mother, not thinking it right that\nhe should live by the sale of medicines whose virtues he distrusts. It\nis no common scruple.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Esther, \"I thought he was something higher than that.\"\nShe was disappointed.\n\nFelix, on his side, as he strolled out in the evening air, said to\nhimself: \"Now by what fine meshes of circumstance did that queer devout\nold man, with his awful creed, which makes this world a vestibule with\ndouble doors to hell, and a narrow stair on one side whereby the thinner\nsort may mount to heaven--by what subtle play of flesh and spirit did he\ncome to have a daughter so little in his own likeness? Married\nfoolishly, I suppose. I'll never marry, though I should have to live on\nraw turnips to subdue my flesh. I'll never look back and say, 'I had a\nfine purpose once--I meant to keep my hands clean and my soul upright,\nand to look truth in the face; but pray excuse me, I have a wife and\nchildren--I must lie and simper a little, else they'll starve'; or 'My\nwife is nice, she must have her bread well buttered, and her feelings\nwill be hurt if she is not thought genteel.' That is the lot Miss Esther\nis preparing for some man or other. I could grind my teeth at such\nself-satisfied minxes, who think they can tell everybody what is the\ncorrect thing, and the utmost stretch of their ideas will not place them\non a level with the intelligent fleas. I should like to see if she could\nbe made ashamed of herself.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n    Though she be dead, yet let me think she lives,\n    And feed my mind, that dies for want of her.\n\n                                 --MARLOWE: _Tamburlaine the Great_.\n\n\nHardly any one in Treby who thought at all of Mr. Lyon and his daughter\nhad not felt the same sort of wonder about Esther as Felix felt. She was\nnot much liked by her father's church and congregation. The less serious\nobserved that she had too many airs and graces and held her head much\ntoo high; the stricter sort feared greatly that Mr. Lyon had not been\nsufficiently careful in placing his daughter among God-fearing people,\nand that, being led astray by the melancholy vanity of giving her\nexceptional accomplishments, he had sent her to a French school, and\nallowed her to take situations where she had contracted notions not\nonly above her own rank, but of too worldly a kind to be safe in any\nrank. But no one knew what sort of woman her mother had been, for Mr.\nLyon never spoke of his past domesticities. When he was chosen as pastor\nat Treby in 1825, it was understood that he had been a widower many\nyears, and he had no companion but the tearful and much-exercised Lyddy,\nhis daughter being still at school. It was only two years ago that\nEsther had come home to live permanently with her father, and take\npupils in the town. Within that time she had excited a passion in two\nyoung Dissenting breasts that were clad in the best style of Treby\nwaistcoat--a garment which at that period displayed much design both in\nthe stuff and the wearer; and she had secured an astonished admiration\nof her cleverness from the girls of various ages who were her pupils;\nindeed, her knowledge of French was generally held to give a distinction\nto Treby itself as compared with other market-towns. But she had won\nlittle regard of any other kind. Wise Dissenting matrons were divided\nbetween fear lest their sons should want to marry her and resentment\nthat she should treat those \"undeniable\" young men with a distant scorn\nwhich was hardly to be tolerated in a minister's daughter; not only\nbecause that parentage appeared to entail an obligation to show an\nexceptional degree of Christian humility, but because, looked at from a\nsecular point of view, a poor minister must be below the substantial\nhouseholders who keep him. For at that time the preacher who was paid\nunder the Voluntary system was regarded by his flock with feelings not\nless mixed than the spiritual person who still took his tithe-pig or his\n_modus_. His gifts were admired, and tears were shed under best bonnets\nat his sermons; but the weaker tea was thought good enough for him; and\neven when he went to preach a charity sermon in a strange town, he was\ntreated with home-made wine and the smaller bedroom. As the good\nChurchman's reverence was often mixed with growling, and was apt to be\ngiven chiefly to an abstract parson who was what a parson ought to be,\nso the good Dissenter sometimes mixed his approval of ministerial gifts\nwith considerable criticism and cheapening of the human vessel which\ncontained those treasures. Mrs. Muscat and Mrs. Nuttwood applied the\nprinciple of Christian equality by remarking that Mr. Lyon had his\noddities, and that he ought not to allow his daughter to indulge in such\nunbecoming expenditure on her gloves, shoes, and hosiery, even if she\ndid pay for them out of her earnings. As for the Church people who\nengaged Miss Lyon to give lessons in their families, their imaginations\nwere altogether prostrated by the incongruity between accomplishments\nand Dissent, between weekly prayer-meetings and a conversance with so\nlively and altogether worldly a language as the French. Esther's own\nmind was not free from a sense of irreconcilableness between the objects\nof her taste and the conditions of her lot. She knew that Dissenters\nwere looked down upon by those whom she regarded as the most refined\nclasses; her favorite companions, both in France and at an English\nschool where she had been a junior teacher, had thought it quite\nridiculous to have a father who was a Dissenting preacher; and when an\nardently admiring school-fellow induced her parents to take Esther as a\ngoverness to the younger children, all her native tendencies toward\nluxury, fastidiousness, and scorn of mock gentility, were strengthened\nby witnessing the habits of a well-born and wealthy family. Yet the\nposition of servitude was irksome to her, and she was glad at last to\nlive at home with her father, for though, throughout her girlhood, she\nhad wished to avoid this lot, a little experience had taught her to\nprefer its comparative independence. But she was not contented with her\nlife; she seemed to herself to be surrounded with ignoble, uninteresting\nconditions, from which there was no issue; for even if she had been\nunamiable enough to give her father pain deliberately, it would have\nbeen no satisfaction to her to go to Treby church, and visibly turn her\nback on Dissent. It was not religious differences, but social\ndifferences, that Esther was concerned about, and her ambitious taste\nwould have been no more gratified in the society of the Waces than in\nthat of the Muscats. The Waces spoke imperfect English and played whist;\nthe Muscats spoke the same dialect and took in the \"Evangelical\nMagazine.\" Esther liked neither of these amusements. She had one of\nthose exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without\nbeing in the least morbid; she was alive to the finest shades of manner,\nto the nicest distinctions of tone and accent; she had a little code of\nher own about scents and colors, textures and behavior, by which she\nsecretly condemned or sanctioned all things and persons. And she was\nwell satisfied with herself for her fastidious taste, never doubting\nthat hers was the highest standard. She was proud that the best-born\nand handsomest girls at school had always said that she might be taken\nfor a born lady. Her own pretty instep, clad in a silk stocking, her\nlittle heel, just rising from a kid slipper, her irreproachable nails\nand delicate wrist, were the objects of delighted consciousness to her;\nand she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use\nwithout disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest\ngloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes,\nand she saved nothing from her earnings. I can not say that she had\npangs of conscience on this score; for she felt sure that she was\ngenerous: she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on\nsome sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had\na want, she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise. But\nthen the good man so seldom had a want--except the perpetual desire,\nwhich she could never gratify, of seeing her under convictions, and fit\nto become a member of the church.\n\nAs for little Mr. Lyon, he loved and admired this unregenerate child\nmore, he feared, than was consistent with the due preponderance of\nimpersonal and ministerial regards: he prayed and pleaded for her with\ntears, humbling himself for her spiritual deficiencies in the privacy of\nhis study; and then came down stairs to find himself in timorous\nsubjection to her wishes, lest, as he inwardly said, he should give his\nteaching an ill savor, by mingling it with outward crossing. There will\nbe queens in spite of Salic or other laws of later date than Adam and\nEve; and here in this small dingy house of the minister in Malthouse\nYard, there was a light-footed, sweet-voiced Queen Esther.\n\nThe stronger will always rule, say some, with an air of confidence which\nis like a lawyer's flourish, forbidding exceptions or additions. But\nwhat is strength? Is it blind wilfulness that sees no terrors, no\nmany-linked consequences, no bruises and wounds of those whose cords it\ntightens? Is it the narrowness of a brain that conceives no needs\ndiffering from its own, and looks to no results beyond the bargains of\nto-day; that tugs with emphasis for every small purpose, and thinks it\nweakness to exercise the sublime power of resolved renunciation? There\nis a sort of subjection which is the peculiar heritage of largeness and\nof love; and strength is often only another name for willing bondage to\nirremediable weakness.\n\nEsther had affection for her father: she recognized the purity of his\ncharacter, and a quickness of intellect in him which responded to her\nown liveliness, in spite of what seemed a dreary piety, which selected\neverything that was least interesting and romantic in life and history.\nBut his old clothes had a smoky odor, and she did not like to walk with\nhim, because, when people spoke to him in the street, it was his wont,\ninstead of remarking on the weather and passing on, to pour forth in an\nabsent manner some reflections that were occupying his mind about the\ntraces of the Divine government, or about a peculiar incident narrated\nin the life of the eminent Mr. Richard Baxter. Esther had a horror of\nappearing ridiculous even in the eyes of vulgar Trebians. She fancied\nthat she should have loved her mother better than she was able to love\nher father; and she wished she could have remembered that mother more\nthoroughly.\n\nBut she had no more than a broken vision of the time before she was five\nyears old--the time when the word oftenest on her lips was \"Mamma\"; when\na low voice spoke caressing French words to her, and she in her turn\nrepeated the words to her rag doll; when a very small white hand,\ndifferent from any that came after, used to pat her, and stroke her, and\ntie on her frock and pinafore, and when at last there was nothing but\nsitting with a doll on a bed where mamma was lying, till her father once\ncarried her away. Where distinct memory began, there was no longer the\nlow caressing voice and the small white hand. She knew that her mother\nwas a Frenchwoman, that she had been in want and distress, and that her\nmaiden name was Annette Ledru. Her father had told her no more than\nthis; and once, he had said, \"My Esther, until you are a woman, we will\nonly think of your mother: when you are about to be married and leave\nme, we will speak of her, and I will deliver to you her ring and all\nthat was hers; but, without a great command laid upon me, I cannot\npierce my heart by speaking of that which was and is not.\" Esther had\nnever forgotten these words, and the older she became, the more\nimpossible she felt it that she should urge her father with questions\nabout the past.\n\nHis inability to speak of that past to her depended on manifold causes.\nPartly it came from an initial concealment. He had not the courage to\ntell Esther that he was not really her father: he had not the courage to\nrenounce that hold on her tenderness which the belief in his natural\nfatherhood must help to give him, or to incur any resentment that her\nquick spirit might feel at having been brought up under a false\nsupposition. But there were other things yet more difficult for him to\nbe quite open about--deep sorrows of his life as a Christian minister\nthat were hardly to be told to a girl.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, when Rufus Lyon was no more than thirty-six years\nold, he was the admired pastor of a large Independent congregation in\none of our southern seaport towns. He was unmarried, and had met all\nexhortations of friends who represented to him that a bishop, _i.e._,\nthe overseer of an Independent church and congregation--should be the\nhusband of one wife, by saying that St. Paul meant this particular as a\nlimitation, and not as an injunction; that a minister was permitted to\nhave one wife, but that he, Rufus Lyon, did not wish to avail himself of\nthat permission, finding his studies and other labors of his vocation\nall-absorbing, and seeing that mothers in Israel were sufficiently\nprovided by those who had not been set apart for a more special work.\nHis church and congregation were proud of him: he was put forward on\nplatforms, was made a \"deputation,\" and was requested to preach\nanniversary sermons in far-off towns. Wherever noteworthy preachers were\ndiscussed, Rufus Lyon was almost sure to be mentioned as one who did\nhonor to the Independent body; his sermons were said to be full of fire;\nand while he had more of human knowledge than many of his brethren, he\nshowed in an eminent degree the marks of a true ministerial vocation.\nBut on a sudden this burning and shining light seemed to be quenched:\nMr. Lyon voluntarily resigned his charge and withdrew from the town.\n\nA terrible crisis had come upon him; a moment in which religious doubt\nand newly-awakened passion had rushed together in a common flood, and\nhad paralyzed his ministerial gifts. His thirty-six years had been a\nstory of purely religious and studious fervor; his passion had been for\ndoctrines, for argumentative conquest on the side of right; the sins he\nhad chiefly to pray against had been those of personal ambition (under\nsuch forms as ambition takes in the mind of a man who has chosen the\ncareer of an Independent preacher), and those of a too restless\nintellect, ceaselessly urging questions concerning the mystery of that\nwhich was assuredly revealed, and thus hindering the due nourishment of\nthe soul on the substance of the truth delivered. Even at that time of\ncomparative youth, his unworldliness and simplicity in small matters\n(for he was keenly awake to the larger affairs of this world) gave a\ncertain oddity to his manners and appearance; and though his sensitive\nface had much beauty, his person altogether seemed so irrelevant to a\nfashionable view of things, that well-dressed ladies and gentlemen\nusually laughed at him, as they probably did at Mr. John Milton after\nthe Restoration and ribbons had come in, and still more at that apostle,\nof weak bodily presence, who preached in the back streets of Ephesus and\nelsewhere, a new view of a religion that hardly anybody believed in.\nRufus Lyon was the singular-looking apostle of the Meeting in Skipper's\nLane. Was it likely that any romance should befall such a man? Perhaps\nnot; but romance did befall him.\n\nOne winter's evening in 1812, Mr. Lyon was returning from a village\npreaching. He walked at his usual rapid rate, with busy thoughts\nundisturbed by any sight more distinct than the bushes and the hedgerow\ntrees, black beneath a faint moonlight, until something suggested to him\nthat he had perhaps omitted to bring away with him a thin account-book\nin which he recorded certain subscriptions. He paused, unfastened his\nouter coat, and felt in all his pockets, then he took off his hat and\nlooked inside it. The book was not to be found, and he was about to walk\non, when he was startled by hearing a low, sweet voice, say, with a\nstrong foreign accent--\n\n\"Have pity on me, sir.\"\n\nSearching with his short-sighted eyes, he perceived some one on a\nside-bank; and approaching, he found a young woman with a baby on her\nlap. She spoke again more faintly than before.\n\n\"Sir, I die with hunger; in the name of God take the little one.\"\n\nThere was no distrusting the pale face and the sweet low voice. Without\npause, Mr. Lyon took the baby in his arms and said, \"Can you walk by my\nside, young woman?\"\n\nShe rose, but seemed tottering. \"Lean on me,\" said Mr. Lyon, and so they\nwalked slowly on, the minister for the first time in his life carrying a\nbaby.\n\nNothing better occurred to him than to take his charge to his own house;\nit was the simplest way of relieving the woman's wants, and finding out\nhow she could be helped further; and he thought of no other\npossibilities. She was too feeble for more words to be spoken between\nthem till she was seated by his fireside. His elderly servant was not\neasily amazed at anything her master did in the way of charity, and at\nonce took the baby, while Mr. Lyon unfastened the mother's damp bonnet\nand shawl, and gave her something warm to drink. Then, waiting by her\ntill it was time to offer her more, he had nothing to do but to notice\nthe loveliness of her face, which seemed to him as that of an angel,\nwith a benignity in its repose that carried a more assured sweetness\nthan any smile. Gradually she revived, lifted up her delicate hands\nbetween her face and the firelight, and looked at the baby which lay\nopposite to her on the old servant's lap, taking in spoonfuls with much\ncontent, and stretching out naked feet toward the warmth. Then, as her\nconsciousness of relief grew into contrasting memory, she lifted up her\neyes to Mr. Lyon, who stood close by her, and said, in her pretty broken\nway:\n\n\"I knew you had a good heart when you took your hat off. You seemed to\nme as the image of the _bien-ami\u00c3\u00a9 Saint Jean_.\"\n\nThe grateful glance of those blue-gray eyes, with their long\nshadow-making eyelashes, was a new kind of good to Rufus Lyon; it seemed\nto him as if a woman had never really looked at him before. Yet this\npoor thing was apparently a blind French Catholic--of delicate nurture,\nsurely, judging from her hands. He was in a tremor; he felt that it\nwould be rude to question her, and he only urged her now to take a\nlittle food. She accepted it with evident enjoyment, looking at the\nchild continually, and then, with a fresh burst of gratitude, leaning\nforward to press the servant's hand and say, \"Oh, you are good!\" Then\nshe looked up at Mr. Lyon again and said, \"Is there in the world a\nprettier _marmot?_\"\n\nThe evening passed; a bed was made up for the strange woman, and Mr.\nLyon had not asked her so much as her name. He never went to bed himself\nthat night. He spent it in misery, enduring a horrible assault of Satan.\nHe thought a frenzy had seized him. Wild visions of an impossible future\nthrust themselves upon him. He dreaded lest the woman had a husband; he\nwished that he might call her his own, that he might worship her beauty,\nthat she might love and caress him. And what to the mass of men would\nhave been only one of many allowable follies--a transient fascination,\nto be dispelled by daylight and contact with those common facts of which\ncommon-sense is the reflex--was to him a spiritual convulsion. He was as\none who raved, and knew that he raved. These mad wishes were\nirreconcilable with what he was, and must be, as a Christian minister,\nnay, penetrating his soul as tropic heat penetrates the frame, and\nchanges for it all aspects and all flavors, they were irreconcilable\nwith that conception of the world which made his faith. All the busy\ndoubt which had before been mere impish shadows flitting around a belief\nthat was strong with the strength of an unswerving moral bias, had now\ngathered blood and substance. The questioning spirit had become suddenly\nbold and blasphemous; it no longer insinuated scepticism--it prompted\ndefiance; it no longer expressed cool, inquisitive thought, but was the\nvoice of a passionate mood. Yet he never ceased to regard it as the\nvoice of the tempter: the conviction which had been the law of his\nbetter life remained within him as a conscience.\n\nThe struggle of that night was an abridgment of all the struggles that\ncame after. Quick souls have their intensest life in the first\nanticipatory sketch of what may or will be, and the pursuit of their\nwish is the pursuit of that paradisiacal vision which only impelled\nthem, and is left farther and farther behind, vanishing forever even out\nof hope in the moment which is called success.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Lyon heard his guest's history. She was the\ndaughter of a French officer of considerable rank, who had fallen in the\nRussian campaign. She had escaped from France to England with much\ndifficulty in order to rejoin her husband, a young Englishman, to whom\nshe had become attached during his detention as a prisoner of war on\nparole at Vesoul, where she was living under the charge of some\nrelatives, and to whom she had been married without the consent of her\nfamily. Her husband had served in the Hanoverian army, had obtained his\ndischarge in order to visit England on some business, with the nature of\nwhich she was not acquainted, and had been taken prisoner as a suspected\nspy. A short time after their marriage he and his fellow-prisoners had\nbeen moved to a town nearer the coast, and she had remained in wretched\nuncertainty about him, until at last a letter had come from him telling\nher that an exchange of prisoners had occurred, that he was in England,\nthat she must use her utmost effort to follow him, and that on arriving\non English ground she must send him word under a cover which he\nenclosed, bearing an address in London. Fearing the opposition of her\nfriends, she started unknown to them, with a very small supply of money;\nand after enduring much discomfort and many fears in waiting for a\npassage which she at last got in a small trading smack, she arrived at\nSouthampton--ill. Before she was able to write, her baby was born; and\nbefore her husband's answer came, she had been obliged to pawn some\nclothes and trinkets. He desired her to travel to London where he would\nmeet her at the Belle Sauvage, adding that he was himself in distress,\nand unable to come to her: when once she was in London they would take\nship and quit the country. Arrived at the Belle Sauvage, the poor thing\nwaited three days in vain for her husband: on the fourth a letter came\nin a strange hand, saying that in his last moments he had desired this\nletter to be written to inform her of his death, and recommend her to\nreturn to her friends. She could choose no other course, but she had\nsoon been reduced to walking, that she might save her pence to buy bread\nwith: and on the evening when she made her appeal to Mr. Lyon, she had\npawned the last thing, over and above needful clothing, that she could\npersuade herself to part with. The things she had not borne to part with\nwere her marriage-ring, and a locket containing her husband's hair, and\nbearing his baptismal name. This locket, she said, exactly resembled one\nworn by her husband on his watch-chain, only that his bore the name\nAnnette, and contained a lock of her hair. The precious trifle now hung\nround her neck by a cord, for she had sold the small gold chain which\nformerly held it.\n\nThe only guarantee of this story, besides the exquisite candor of her\nface, was a small packet of papers which she carried in her pocket,\nconsisting of her husband's few letters, the letter which announced his\ndeath, and her marriage certificate. It was not so probable a story as\nthat of many an inventive vagrant; but Mr. Lyon did not doubt it for a\nmoment. It was impossible to him to suspect this angelic-faced woman,\nbut he had strong suspicions concerning her husband. He could not help\nbeing glad that she had not retained the address he had desired her to\nsend to in London, as that removed any obvious means of learning\nparticulars about him. But enquiries might have been made at Vesoul by\nletter, and her friends there might have been appealed to. A\nconsciousness, not to be quite silenced, told Mr. Lyon that this was the\ncourse he ought to take, but it would have required an energetic\nself-conquest, and he was excused from it by Annette's own\ndisinclination to return to her relatives, if any other acceptable\npossibility could be found.\n\nHe dreaded, with a violence of feeling which surmounted all struggles,\nlest anything should take her away, and place such barriers between them\nas would make it unlikely or impossible that she should ever love him\nwell enough to become his wife. Yet he saw with perfect clearness that\nunless he tore up his mad passion by the roots, his ministerial\nusefulness would be frustrated, and the repose of his soul would be\ndestroyed. This woman was an unregenerate Catholic; ten minutes'\nlistening to her artless talk made that plain to him: even if her\nposition had been less equivocal, to unite himself to such a woman was\nnothing less than a spiritual fall. It was already a fall that he had\nwished there was no high purpose to which he owed an allegiance--that he\nhad longed to fly to some backwoods where there was no church to\nreproach him, and where he might have this sweet woman to wife, and to\nknow the joys of tenderness. Those sensibilities which in most lives are\ndiffused equally through the youthful years, were aroused suddenly in\nMr. Lyon, as some men have their special genius revealed to them by a\ntardy concurrence of conditions. His love was the first love of a fresh\nyoung heart full of wonder and worship. But what to one man is the\nvirtue which he has sunk below the possibility of aspiring to, is to\nanother the backsliding by which he forfeits his spiritual crown.\n\nThe end was, that Annette remained in his house. He had striven against\nhimself so far as to represent her position to some chief matrons in his\ncongregation, praying and yet dreading that they would so take her by\nthe hand as to impose on him that denial of his own longing not to let\nher go out of his sight, which he found it too hard to impose on\nhimself. But they regarded the case coldly; the woman was, after all, a\nvagrant. Mr. Lyon was observed to be surprisingly weak on the\nsubject--his eagerness seemed disproportionate and unbecoming; and this\nyoung Frenchwoman, unable to express herself very clearly, was no more\ninteresting to those matrons and their husbands than other pretty young\nwomen suspiciously circumstanced. They were willing to subscribe\nsomething to carry her on her way, or if she took some lodgings they\nwould give her a little sewing, and endeavor to convert her from\nPapistry. If, however, she was a respectable person, as she said, the\nonly proper thing for her was to go back to her own country and friends.\nIn spite of himself, Mr. Lyon exulted. There seemed a reason now that he\nshould keep Annette under his own eyes. He told himself that no real\nobject would be served by his providing food and lodging for her\nelsewhere--an expense which he could ill afford. And she was apparently\nso helpless, except as to the one task of attending to her baby, that it\nwould have been folly to think of her exerting herself for her own\nsupport.\n\nBut this course of his was severely disapproved by his church. There\nwere various signs that the minister was under some evil influence: his\npreaching wanted its old fervor, he seemed to shun the intercourse of\nhis brethren, and very mournful suspicions were entertained. A formal\nremonstrance was presented to him, but he met it as if he had already\ndetermined to act in anticipation of it. He admitted that external\ncircumstances, conjoined with a peculiar state of mind, were likely to\nhinder the fruitful exercise of his ministry, and he resigned it. There\nwas much sorrowing, much expostulation, but he declared that for the\npresent he was unable to unfold himself more fully; he only wished to\nstate solemnly that Annette Ledru, though blind in spiritual things, was\nin a worldly sense a pure and virtuous woman. No more was to be said,\nand he departed to a distant town. Here he maintained himself, Annette\nand the child, with the remainder of his stipend, and with the wages he\nearned as a printer's reader. Annette was one of those angelic-faced\nhelpless women who take all things as manna from heaven: the good image\nof the well-beloved Saint John wished her to stay with him, and there\nwas nothing else that she wished for except the unattainable. Yet for a\nwhole year Mr. Lyon never dared to tell Annette that he loved her: he\ntrembled before this woman; he saw that the idea of his being her lover\nwas too remote from her mind for her to have any idea that she ought not\nto live with him. She had never known, never asked the reason why he\ngave up his ministry. She seemed to entertain as little concern about\nthe strange world in which she lived as a bird in its nest: an avalanche\nhad fallen over the past, but she sat warm and uncrushed--there was food\nfor many morrows, and her baby flourished. She did not seem even to care\nabout a priest, or about having her child baptized; and on the subject\nof religion Mr. Lyon was as timid, and shrank as much from speaking to\nher, as on the subject of his love. He dreaded anything that might cause\nher to feel a sudden repulsion toward him. He dreaded disturbing her\nsimple gratitude and content. In these days his religious faith was not\nslumbering; it was awake and achingly conscious of having fallen in a\nstruggle. He had had a great treasure committed to him, and had flung it\naway: he held himself a backslider. His unbelieving thoughts never\ngained the full ear and consent of his soul. His prayers had been\nstifled by the sense that there was something he preferred to complete\nobedience; they had ceased to be anything but intermittent cries and\nconfessions, and a submissive presentiment, rising at times even to an\nentreaty, that some great discipline might come, that the dull spiritual\nsense might be roused to full vision and hearing as of old, and the\nsupreme facts become again supreme in his soul. Mr. Lyon will perhaps\nseem a very simple personage, with pitiably narrow theories; but none of\nour theories are quite large enough for all the disclosures of time, and\nto the end of men's struggles a penalty will remain for those who sink\nfrom the ranks of the heroes into the crowd for whom the heroes fight\nand die.\n\nOne day, however, Annette learned Mr. Lyon's secret. The baby had a\ntooth coming, and being large and strong now, was noisily fretful. Mr.\nLyon, though he had been working extra hours and was much in need of\nrepose, took the child from its mother immediately on entering the house\nand walked about with it, patting and talking soothingly to it. The\nstronger grasp, the new sensations, were a successful anodyne, and baby\nwent to sleep on his shoulder. But fearful lest any movement should\ndisturb it, he sat down, and endured the bondage of holding it still\nagainst his shoulder.\n\n\"You do nurse baby well,\" said Annette, approvingly. \"Yet you never\nnursed before I came?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Lyon. \"I had no brothers and sisters.\"\n\n\"Why were you not married?\" Annette had never thought of asking that\nquestion before.\n\n\"Because I never loved any woman--till now. I thought I should never\nmarry. Now I wish to marry.\"\n\nAnnette started. She did not see at once that she was the woman he\nwanted to marry; what had flashed on her mind was, that there might be a\ngreat change in Mr. Lyon's life. It was as if the lightning had entered\ninto her dream and half awaked her.\n\n\"Do you think it foolish, Annette, that I should wish to marry?\"\n\n\"I did not expect it,\" she said, doubtfully. \"I did not know you thought\nabout it.\"\n\n\"You know the woman I should like to marry?\"\n\n\"I know her?\" she said, interrogatively, blushing deeply.\n\n\"It is you, Annette--you whom I have loved better than my duty. I\nforsook everything for you.\"\n\nMr. Lyon paused: he was about to do what he felt would be ignoble--to\nurge what seemed like a claim.\n\n\"Can you love me, Annette? Will you be my wife?\" Annette trembled and\nlooked miserable.\n\n\"Do not speak--forget it,\" said Mr. Lyon, rising suddenly and speaking\nwith loud energy. \"No, no--I do not want it--I do not wish it.\"\n\nThe baby awoke as he started up; he gave the child into Annette's arms,\nand left her.\n\nHis work took him away early the next morning and the next again. They\ndid not need to speak much to each other. The third day Mr. Lyon was too\nill to go to work. His frame had been overwrought; he had been too poor\nto have sufficiently nourishing food, and under the shattering of his\nlong deferred hope his health had given away. They had no regular\nservant--only occasional help from an old woman, who lit the fires and\nput on the kettles. Annette was forced to be the sick-nurse, and this\nsudden demand on her shook away some of her torpor. The illness was a\nserious one, and the medical man one day hearing Mr. Lyon in his\ndelirium raving with an astonishing fluency in Biblical language,\nsuddenly looked round with increased curiosity at Annette, and asked if\nshe were the sick man's wife, or some other relative.\n\n\"No--no relation,\" said Annette, shaking her head. \"He has been good to\nme.\"\n\n\"How long have you lived with him?\"\n\n\"More than a year.\"\n\n\"Was he a preacher once?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When did he leave off being a preacher?\"\n\n\"Soon after he took care of me.\"\n\n\"Is that his child?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Annette, coloring indignantly, \"I am a widow.\"\n\nThe doctor, she thought, looked at her oddly, but he asked no more\nquestions.\n\nWhen the sick man was getting better, and able to enjoy invalid's food,\nhe observed one day, while he was taking some broth, that Annette was\nlooking at him; he paused to look at her in return, and was struck with\na new expression in her face, quite distinct from the merely passive\nsweetness which usually characterized it. She laid her little hand on\nhis, which was now transparently thin, and said, \"I am getting very\nwise; I have sold some of the books to make money--the doctor told me\nwhere; and I have looked into the shops where they sell caps and bonnets\nand pretty things, and I can do all that, and get more money to keep\nus. And when you are well enough to get up, we will go out and be\nmarried--shall we not? See! and _la petite_\" (the baby had never\nbeen named anything else) \"shall call you Papa--and then we shall never\npart.\"\n\nMr. Lyon trembled. This illness--something else, perhaps--had made a\ngreat change in Annette. A fortnight after that they were married. The\nday before he had ventured to ask her if she felt any difficulty about\nher religion, and if she would consent to have _la petite_ baptized and\nbrought up as a Protestant. She shook her head and said very simply--\n\n\"No: in France, in other days, I would have minded; but all is changed.\nI never was fond of religion, but I knew it was right. _J'aimais les\nfleurs, les bals, la musique, et mon mari qui \u00c3\u00a9tait beau_. But all that\nis gone away. There is nothing of my religion in this country. But the\ngood God must be here, for you are good; I leave all to you.\"\n\nIt was clear that Annette regarded her present life as a sort of death\nto the world--an existence on a remote island where she had been saved\nfrom wreck. She was too indolent mentally, too little interested, to\nacquaint herself with any secrets of the isle. The transient energy, the\nmore vivid consciousness and sympathy which had been stirred in her\nduring Mr. Lyon's illness, had soon subsided into the old apathy to\neverything except her child. She withered like a plant in strange air,\nand the three years of life that remained were but a slow and gentle\ndeath. Those three years were to Mr. Lyon a period of such\nself-suppression and life in another as few men know. Strange! that the\npassion for this woman, which he felt to have drawn him aside from the\nright as much as if he had broken the most solemn vows--for that only\nwas right to him which he held the best and highest--the passion for a\nbeing who had no glimpse of his thoughts induced a more thorough\nrenunciation than he had ever known in the time of his complete devotion\nto his ministerial career. He had no flattery now, either from himself\nor the world; he knew that he had fallen, and _his_ world had forgotten\nhim, or shook their heads at his memory. The only satisfaction he had\nwas the satisfaction of his tenderness--which meant untiring work,\nuntiring patience, untiring wakefulness even to the dumb signs of\nfeeling in a creature whom he alone cared for.\n\nThe day of parting came, and he was left with little Esther as the one\nvisible sign of that four years' break in his life. A year afterward he\nentered the ministry again, and lived with the utmost sparingness that\nEsther might be so educated as to be able to get her own bread in case\nof his death. Her probable facility in acquiring French naturally\nsuggested his sending her to a French school, which would give her a\nspecial advantage as a teacher. It was a Protestant school, and French\nProtestantism had the high recommendation of being non-Prelatical. It\nwas understood that Esther would contract no Papistical superstitions;\nand this was perfectly true; but she contracted, as we see, a good deal\nof non-Papistical vanity.\n\nMr. Lyon's reputation as a preacher and devoted pastor had revived; but\nsome dissatisfaction beginning to be felt by his congregation at a\ncertain laxity detected by them in his views as to the limits of\nsalvation, which he had in one sermon even hinted might extend to\nunconscious recipients of mercy, he had found it desirable seven years\nago to quit this ten years' pastorate and accept a call from the less\nimportant church in Malthouse Yard, Treby Magna.\n\nThis was Rufus Lyon's history, at that time unknown in its fullness to\nany human being besides himself. We can perhaps guess what memories they\nwere that relaxed the stringency of his doctrine on the point of\nsalvation. In the deepest of all senses his heart said--\n\n    \"Though she be dead, yet let me think she lives,\n    And feed my mind, that dies for want of her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n    _M._  It was but yesterday you spoke him well--\n          You've changed your mind so soon?\n\n    _N._                    Not I--'tis he\n          That, changing to my thought, has changed my mind.\n          No man puts rotten apples in his pouch\n          Because their upper side looked fair to him.\n          Constancy in mistake is constant folly.\n\n\nThe news that the rich heir of the Transomes was actually come back, and\nhad been seen at Treby, was carried to some one else who had more\nreasons for being interested in it than the Reverend Rufus Lyon was yet\nconscious of having. It was owing to this that at three o'clock, two\ndays afterward, a carriage and pair, with coachman and footman in\ncrimson and drab, passed through the lodge gates at Transome Court.\nInside there was a hale, good-natured-looking man of sixty, whose hands\nrested on a knotted stick held between his knees; and a blue-eyed,\nwell-featured lady, fat and middle-aged--a mountain of satin, lace, and\nexquisite muslin embroidery. They were not persons of a highly\nremarkable appearance, but to most Trebians they seemed absolutely\nunique, and likely to be known anywhere. If you had looked down upon\nthem from the box of Sampson's coach, he would have said, after lifting\nhis hat, \"Sir Maximus and his lady--did you see?\" thinking it needless\nto add the surname.\n\n\"We shall find her greatly elated, doubtless,\" Lady Debarry was saying.\n\"She has been in the shade so long.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor thing!\" said Sir Maximus. \"A fine woman she was in her bloom.\nI remember the first county ball she attended we were all ready to fight\nfor the sake of dancing with her. I always liked her from that time--I\nnever swallowed the scandal about her myself.\"\n\n\"If we are to be intimate with her,\" said Lady Debarry, \"I wish you\nwould avoid making such allusions, Sir Maximus. I should not like Selina\nand Harriet to hear them.\"\n\n\"My dear, I should have forgotten all about the scandal, only you remind\nme of it sometimes,\" retorted the baronet, smiling and taking out his\nsnuff-box.\n\n\"These sudden turns of fortune are often dangerous to an excitable\nconstitution,\" said Lady Debarry, not choosing to notice her husband's\nepigram. \"Poor Lady Alicia Methurst got heart-disease from a sudden\npiece of luck--the death of her uncle, you know. If Mrs. Transome was\nwise she would go to town--she can afford it now, and consult Dr.\nTruncheon. I should say myself he would order her digitalis: I have\noften guessed exactly what a prescription would be. But it certainly was\none of her weak points to think she understood medicine better than\nother people.\"\n\n\"She's a healthy woman enough, surely: see how upright she is, and she\nrides about like a girl of twenty.\"\n\n\"She is so thin that she makes me shudder.\"\n\n\"Pooh! she's slim and active; women are not bid for by the pound.\"\n\n\"Pray don't be so coarse.\"\n\nSir Maximus laughed and showed his good teeth, which made his laughter\nvery becoming. The carriage stopped, and they were soon ushered to Mrs.\nTransome's sitting-room, where she was working at her worsted\nembroidery. A little daily embroidery had been a constant element in\nMrs. Transome's life; but that soothing occupation of taking stitches to\nproduce what neither she nor any one else wanted, was then the resource\nof many a well-born and unhappy woman.\n\nShe received much warm congratulation and pressure of her hand with\nperfect composure of manner; but she became paler than usual, and her\nhands turned quite cold. The Debarrys did not yet know what Harold's\npolitics were.\n\n\"Well, our lucky youngster is come in the nick of time,\" said Sir\nMaximus: \"if he'll stand, he and Philip can run in harness together and\nkeep out both the Whigs.\"\n\n\"It is really quite a providential thing--his returning just now,\" said\nLady Debarry. \"I couldn't help thinking that something would occur to\nprevent Philip from having such a man as Peter Garstin for his\ncolleague.\"\n\n\"I call my friend Harold a youngster,\" said Sir Maximus, \"for, you know,\nI remember him only as he was when that portrait was taken.\"\n\n\"That is a long while ago,\" said Mrs. Transome. \"My son is much altered,\nas you may imagine.\"\n\nThere was a confused sound of voices in the library while this talk was\ngoing on. Mrs. Transome chose to ignore that noise, but her face, from\nbeing pale, began to flush a little.\n\n\"Yes, yes, on the outside, I dare say. But he was a fine fellow--I\nalways liked him. And if anybody should ask me what I should choose for\nthe good of the country, I couldn't have thought of anything better than\nhaving a young Transome for a neighbor who will take an active part. The\nTransomes and the Debarrys were always on the right side together in old\ndays. Of course he'll stand--he has made up his mind to it?\"\n\nThe need for an answer to this embarrassing question was deferred by the\nincrease of inarticulate sounds accompanied by a bark from the library,\nand the sudden appearance at the tapestry-hung doorway of old Mr.\nTransome with a cord around his waist, playing a very poor-paced horse\nfor a black-maned little boy about three years old, who was urging him\non with loud encouraging noises and occasional thumps from a stick which\nhe wielded with difficulty. The old man paused with a vague smile at the\ndoorway while the baronet got up to speak to him. Nimrod snuffed at his\nmaster's legs to ascertain that he was not hurt, and the little boy,\nfinding something new to be looked at, let go the cord and came round in\nfront of the company, dragging his stick, and standing at a safe\nwar-dancing distance as he fixed his great black eyes on Lady Debarry.\n\n\"Dear me, what a splendid little boy, Mrs. Transome! why--it cannot\nbe--can it be--that you have the happiness to be a grandmamma?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is my son's little boy.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Lady Debarry, really amazed. \"I never heard you speak of\nhis marriage. He has brought you home a daughter-in-law, then?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Transome, coldly; \"she is dead.\"\n\n\"O--o--oh!\" said Lady Debarry, in a tone ludicrously undecided between\ncondolence, satisfaction, and general mistiness. \"How very singular--I\nmean that we should not have heard of Mr. Harold's marriage. But he's a\ncharming little fellow: come to me, you round-cheeked cherub.\"\n\nThe black eyes continued fixed as if by a sort of fascination on Lady\nDebarry's face, and her affable invitation was unheeded. At last,\nputting his head forward and pouting his lips, the cherub gave forth\nwith marked intention the sounds, \"Nau-o-oom,\" many times repeated:\napparently they summed up his opinion of Lady Debarry, and may perhaps\nhave meant \"naughty old woman,\" but his speech was a broken lisping\npolyglot of hazardous interpretation. Then he turned to pull at the\nBlenheim spaniel, which, being old and peevish, gave a little snap.\n\n\"Go, go, Harry; let poor Puff alone--he'll bite you,\" said Mrs.\nTransome, stooping to release her aged pet.\n\nHer words were too suggestive, for Harry immediately laid hold of her\narm with his teeth, and bit with all his might. Happily the stuffs upon\nit were some protection, but the pain forced Mrs. Transome to give a low\ncry; and Sir Maximus, who had now turned to reseat himself, shook the\nlittle rascal off, whereupon he burst away and trotted into the library\nagain.\n\n\"I fear you are hurt,\" said Lady Debarry, with sincere concern. \"What a\nlittle savage! Do have your arm attended to, my dear--I recommend\nfomentation--don't think of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, it is nothing,\" said Mrs. Transome, biting her lip and\nsmiling alternately; \"it will soon go off. The pleasures of being a\ngrandmamma, you perceive. The child has taken a dislike to me; but he\nmakes quite a new life for Mr. Transome; they were playfellows at once.\"\n\n\"Bless my heart!\" said Sir Maximus, \"it is odd to think of Harold having\nbeen a family man so long. I made up my mind he was a young bachelor.\nWhat an old stager I am, to be sure! And whom has he married? I hope we\nshall soon have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Harold Transome.\" Sir\nMaximus, occupied with old Mr. Transome, had not overheard the previous\nconversation on that subject.\n\n\"She is no longer living,\" Lady Debarry hastily interposed; \"but now, my\ndear Sir Maximus, we must not hinder Mrs. Transome from attending to her\narm. I am sure she is in pain. Don't say another word, my dear--we shall\nsee you again--you and Mr. Harold will come and dine with us on\nThursday--say yes, only yes. Sir Maximus is longing to see him: and\nPhilip will be down.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Sir Maximus; \"he must lose no time in making Philip's\nacquaintance. Tell him Philip is a fine fellow--carried everything\nbefore him at Oxford. And your son must be returned along with him for\nNorth Loamshire. You said he meant to stand?\"\n\n\"I will write and let you know if Harold has any engagement for\nThursday; he would of course be happy otherwise,\" said Mrs. Transome,\nevading the question.\n\n\"If not Thursday, the next day--the very first day he can.\"\n\nThe visitors left, and Mrs. Transome was almost glad of the painful bite\nwhich had saved her from being questioned further about Harold's\npolitics. \"This is the last visit I shall receive from them,\" she said\nto herself as the door closed behind them, and she rang for Denner.\n\n\"That poor creature is not happy, Sir Maximus,\" said Lady Debarry as\nthey drove along. \"Something annoys her about her son. I hope there is\nnothing unpleasant in his character. Either he kept his marriage a\nsecret from her, or she was ashamed of it. He is thirty-four at least by\nthis time. After living in the East so long he may have become a sort of\nperson one would not care to be intimate with, and that savage boy--he\ndoesn't look like a lady's child.\"\n\n\"Pooh, my dear,\" said Sir Maximus, \"women think so much of those\nminuti\u00c3\u00a6. In the present state of the country it is our duty to look at a\nman's position and politics. Philip and my brother are both of that\nopinion, and I think they know what's right, if any man does. We are\nbound to regard every man of our party as a public instrument, and to\npull all together. The Transomes have always been a good Tory family,\nbut it has been a cipher of late years. This young fellow coming back\nwith a fortune to give the family a head and a position is a clear gain\nto the county; and with Philip he'll get into the right hands--of course\nhe wants guiding, having been out of the country so long. All we have to\nask is, whether a man's a Tory, and will make a stand for the good of\nthe country?--that's the plain English of the matter. And I do beg of\nyou, my dear, to set aside all these gossiping niceties, and exert\nyourself, like a woman of sense and spirit as you are, to bring the\nright people together.\"\n\nHere Sir Maximus gave a deep cough, took out his snuff-box, and tapped\nit: he had made a serious marital speech, an exertion to which he was\nrarely urged by anything smaller than a matter of conscience. And this\noutline of the whole duty of a Tory was a matter of conscience with him;\nthough the _Duffield Watchman_ had pointed expressly to Sir Maximus\nDebarry amongst others, in branding the co-operation of the Tories as a\nconscious selfishness and reckless immorality, which, however, would be\ndefeated by the co-operation of all the friends of truth and liberty,\nwho, the _Watchman_ trusted, would subordinate all non-political\ndifferences in order to return representatives pledged to support the\npresent government.\n\n\"I am sure, Sir Maximus,\" Lady Debarry answered, \"you could not have\nobserved that anything was wanting in my manners to Mrs. Transome.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear; but I say this by way of caution. Never mind what was\ndone at Smyrna, or whether Transome likes to sit with his heels tucked\nup. We may surely wink at a few things for the sake of the public\ninterest, if God Almighty does; and if He didn't, I don't know what\nwould have become of the country--Government could never have been\ncarried on, and many a good battle would have been lost. That's the\nphilosophy of the matter, and common-sense too.\"\n\nGood Sir Maximus gave a deep cough and tapped his box again, inwardly\nremarking, that if he had not been such a lazy fellow he might have made\nas good a figure as his son Philip.\n\nBut at this point the carriage, which was rolling by a turn toward Treby\nMagna, passed a well-dressed man, who raised his hat to Sir Maximus, and\ncalled to the coachman to stop.\n\n\"Excuse me, Sir Maximus,\" said this personage, standing uncovered at the\ncarriage-door, \"but I have just learned something of importance at\nTreby, which I thought you would like to know as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Ah! what's that? Something about Garstin or Clement?\" said Sir Maximus,\nseeing the other draw a poster from his pocket.\n\n\"No; rather worse, I fear you will think. A new Radical candidate. I got\nthis by a stratagem from the printer's boy. They're not posted yet.\"\n\n\"A Radical!\" said Sir Maximus, in a tone of incredulous disgust, as he\ntook the folded bill. \"What fool is he?--he'll have no chance.\"\n\n\"They say he's richer than Garstin.\"\n\n\"Harold Transome!\" shouted Sir Maximus, as he read the name in\nthree-inch letters. \"I don't believe it--it's a trick--it's a squib:\nwhy--why--we've just been to his place--eh? do you know any more? Speak,\nsir--speak; don't deal out your story like a damned mountebank, who\nwants to keep people gaping.\"\n\n\"Sir Maximus, pray don't give way so,\" said Lady Debarry.\n\n\"I'm afraid there's no doubt about it, sir,\" said Christian. \"After\ngetting the bill, I met Mr. Labron's clerk, and he said he had just had\nthe whole story from Jermyn's clerk. The Ram Inn is engaged already, and\na committee is being made up. He says Jermyn goes like a steam engine,\nwhen he has a mind, although he makes such long-winded speeches.\"\n\n\"Jermyn be hanged for a two-faced rascal! Tell Mitchell to drive on.\nIt's of no use to stay chattering here. Jump up on the box and go home\nwith us. I may want you.\"\n\n\"You see I was right, Sir Maximus,\" said the baronet's wife. \"I had an\ninstinct that we should find him an unpleasant person.\"\n\n\"Fudge! if you had such a fine instinct, why did you let us go to\nTransome Court and make fools of ourselves?\"\n\n\"Would you have listened to me? But of course you will not have him to\ndine with you?\"\n\n\"Dine with me? I should think not. I'd sooner he should dine off me. I\nsee how it is clearly enough. He has become a regular beast among those\nMahometans--he's got neither religion nor morals left. He can't know any\nthing about English politics. He'll go and cut his own nose off as a\nlandholder, and never know. However, he won't get in--he'll spend his\nmoney for nothing.\"\n\n\"I fear he is a very licentious man,\" said Lady Debarry. \"We know now\nwhy his mother seemed so uneasy. I should think she reflects a little,\npoor creature.\"\n\n\"It's a confounded nuisance we didn't meet Christian on our way, instead\nof coming back; but better now than later. He's an uncommonly adroit,\nuseful fellow, that factotum of Philip's. I wish Phil would take my man\nand give me Christian. I'd make him house-steward: he might reduce the\naccounts a little.\"\n\nPerhaps Sir Maximus would not have been so sanguine as to Mr.\nChristian's economical virtues if he had seen that gentleman relaxing\nhimself the same evening among the other distinguished dependents of the\nfamily and frequenters of the steward's room. But a man of Sir Maximus's\nrank is like those antediluvian animals whom the system of things\ncondemned to carry such a huge bulk that they really could not inspect\ntheir bodily appurtenance, and had no conception of their own tails:\ntheir parasites doubtless had a merry time of it, and often did\nextremely well when the high-bred saurian himself was ill at ease. Treby\nManor, measured from the front saloon to the remotest shed, was as large\nas a moderate-sized village, and there were certainly more lights\nburning in it every evening, more wine, spirits, and ale drunk, more\nwaste and more folly, than could be found in some large villages. There\nwas fast revelry in the steward's room, and slow revelry in the Scotch\nbailiff's room; short whist, costume, and flirtation in the\nhousekeeper's room, and the same at a lower price in the servants' hall;\na select Olympian feast in the private apartment of the cook, who was a\nmuch grander person than her ladyship, and wore gold and jewelry to a\nvast amount of suet; a gambling group in the stables, and the coachman,\nperhaps the most innocent member of the establishment, tippling in\nmajestic solitude by a fire in the harness-room. For Sir Maximus, as\nevery one said, was a gentleman of the right sort, condescended to no\nmean enquiries, greeted his head-servants with a \"good-evening,\ngentlemen,\" when he met them in the park, and only snarled in a subdued\nway when he looked over the accounts, willing to endure some personal\ninconvenience in order to keep up the institutions of the country, to\nmaintain his hereditary establishment, and do his duty in that station\nof life--the station of the long-tailed saurian--to which it had pleased\nProvidence to call him.\n\nThe focus of brilliancy at Treby Manor that evening was in no way the\ndining-room, where Sir Maximus sipped his port under some mental\ndepression, as he discussed with his brother, the Reverend Augustus, the\nsad fact that one of the oldest names in the county was to be on the\nwrong side--not in the drawing-room, where Miss Debarry and Miss Selina,\nquietly elegant in their dress and manners, were feeling rather dull\nthan otherwise, having finished Mr. Bulwer's \"Eugene Aram,\" and being\nthrown back on the last great prose work of Mr. Southey, while their\nmamma slumbered a little on the sofa. No; the centre of eager talk and\nenjoyment was the steward's room, where Mr. Scales, house-steward and\nhead-butler, a man most solicitous about his boots, wristbands, the roll\nof his whiskers, and other attributes of a gentleman, distributed\ncigars, cognac, and whiskey, to various colleagues and guests who were\ndiscussing, with that freedom of conjecture which is one of our\ninalienable privileges as Britons, the probable amount of Harold\nTransome's fortune, concerning which fame had already been busy long\nenough to have acquired vast magnifying power.\n\nThe chief part in this scene was undoubtedly Mr. Christian's, although\nhe had hitherto been comparatively silent; but he occupied two chairs\nwith so much grace, throwing his right leg over the seat of the second,\nand resting his right hand on the back; he held his cigar and displayed\na splendid seal-ring with such becoming nonchalance, and had his gray\nhair arranged with so much taste, that experienced eyes would at once\nhave seen even the great Scales himself to be but a secondary character.\n\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Crowder, an old respectable tenant, though much in\narrear as to his rent, who condescended frequently to drink in the\nsteward's room for the sake of the conversation; \"why, I suppose they\nget money so fast in the East--it's wonderful. Why,\" he went on, with a\nhesitating look toward Mr. Scales, \"this Transome p'r'aps got a matter\nof a hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand, my dear sir! fiddle-stick's end of a hundred\nthousand,\" said Mr. Scales, with a contempt very painful to be borne by\na modest man.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Crowder, giving way under torture, as the all-knowing\nbutler puffed and stared at him, \"perhaps not so much as that.\"\n\n\"Not so much, sir! I tell you that a hundred thousand pounds is a\nbagatelle.\"\n\n\"Well, I know it's a big sum,\" said Mr. Crowder, deprecatingly.\n\nHere there was a general laugh. All the other intellects present were\nmore cultivated than Mr. Crowder's.\n\n\"Bagatelle is the French for trifle, my friend,\" said Mr. Christian.\n\"Don't talk over people's heads so, Scales. I shall have hard work to\nunderstand you myself soon.\"\n\n\"Come, that's a good one,\" said the head-gardener, who was a ready\nadmirer; \"I should like to hear the thing you don't understand,\nChristian.\"\n\n\"He's a first-rate hand at sneering,\" said Mr. Scales, rather nettled.\n\n\"Don't be waspie, man. I'll ring the bell for lemons, and make some\npunch. That's the thing for putting people up to the unknown tongues,\"\nsaid Mr. Christian, starting up and slapping Scales's shoulder as he\npassed him.\n\n\"What I mean, Mr. Crowder, is this.\" Here Mr. Scales paused to puff,\nand pull down his waistcoat in a gentlemanly manner, and drink. He was\nwont in this way to give his hearers time for meditation.\n\n\"Come, then, speak English; I'm not against being taught,\" said the\nreasonable Crowder.\n\n\"What I mean is, that in a large way of trade a man turns his capital\nover almost as soon as he can turn himself. Bless your soul! I know\nsomething about these matters, eh, Brent?\"\n\n\"To be sure you do--few men more,\" said the gardener, who was the person\nappealed to.\n\n\"Not that I've had anything to do with commercial families myself. I've\nthose feelings that I look to other things besides lucre. But I can't\nsay that I've not been intimate with parties who have been less nice\nthan I am myself; and knowing what I know, I shouldn't wonder if\nTransome had as much as five hundred thousand. Bless your soul, sir!\npeople who get their money out of land are as long scraping five pounds\ntogether as your trading men are in turning five pounds into a hundred.\"\n\n\"That's a wicked thing, though,\" said Mr. Crowder, meditatively.\n\"However,\" he went on, retreating from this difficult ground, \"trade or\nno trade, the Transomes have been poor enough this many a long year.\nI've a brother a tenant on their estate--I ought to know a little bit\nabout that.\"\n\n\"They've kept up no establishment at all,\" said Mr. Scales, with\ndisgust. \"They've even let their kitchen gardens. I suppose it was the\nson's gambling. I've seen something of that. A man who has always lived\nin first-rate families is likely to know a thing or two on that\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it wasn't gambling did the first mischief,\" said Mr. Crowder,\nwith a slight smile, feeling that it was his turn to have some\nsuperiority. \"New-comers don't know what happened in this country twenty\nand thirty years ago. I'm turned fifty myself, and my father lived under\nSir Maximus's father. But if anybody from London can tell me more than I\nknow about this country-side, I'm willing to listen.\"\n\n\"What was it, then, if it wasn't gambling?\" said Mr. Scales, with some\nimpatience. \"_I_ don't pretend to know.\"\n\n\"It was law--law--that's what it was. Not but what the Transomes always\nwon.\"\n\n\"And always lost,\" said the too-ready Scales. \"Yes, yes; I think we all\nknow the nature of law.\"\n\n\"There was the last suit of all made the most noise, as I understood,\"\ncontinued Mr. Crowder; \"but it wasn't tried hereabout. They said there\nwas a deal o' false swearing. Some young man pretended to be the true\nheir--let me see--I can't justly remember the names--he'd got two. _He_\nswore he was one man, and _they_ swore he was another. However Lawyer\nJermyn won it--they say he'd win a game against the Old One himself--and\nthe young fellow turned out to be a scamp. Stop a bit--his name was\nScaddon--Henry Scaddon.\"\n\nMr. Christian here let a lemon slip from his hand into the punch-bowl\nwith a splash which sent some of the nectar into the company's faces.\n\n\"Hallo! What a bungler I am!\" he said, looking as if he were quite\njarred by this unusual awkwardness of his. \"Go on with your tale, Mr.\nCrowder--a scamp named Henry Scaddon.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the tale,\" said Mr. Crowder. \"He was never seen nothing of\nanymore. It was a deal talked of at the time--and I've sat by; and my\nfather used to shake his head; and always when this Mrs. Transome was\ntalked of, he used to shake his head, and say she carried things with a\nhigh hand once. But, Lord! it was before the battle of Waterloo, and I'm\na poor hand at tales; I don't see much good in 'em myself--but if\nanybody'll tell me a cure for the sheep-rot, I'll thank him.\"\n\nHere Mr. Crowder relapsed into smoking and silence, a little discomfited\nthat the knowledge of which he had been delivered had turned out rather\na shapeless and insignificant birth.\n\n\"Well, well, bygones should be bygones; there are secrets in most good\nfamilies,\" said Mr. Scales, winking, \"and this young Transome, coming\nback with a fortune to keep up the establishment, and have things done\nin a decent and gentlemanly way--it would all have been right if he'd\nnot been this sort of Radical madman. But now he's done for himself. I\nheard Sir Maximus say at dinner that he would be excommunicated; and\nthat's a pretty strong word, I take it.\"\n\n\"What does it mean, Scales?\" said Mr. Christian, who loved tormenting.\n\n\"Ay, what's the meaning?\" insisted Mr. Crowder, encouraged by finding\nthat even Christian was in the dark.\n\n\"Well, it's a law term--speaking in a figurative sort of way--meaning\nthat a Radical was no gentleman.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's partly accounted for by his getting his money so fast, and\nin foreign countries,\" said Mr. Crowder, tentatively. \"It's reasonable\nto think he'd be against the land and this country--eh, Sircome?\"\n\nSircome was an eminent miller who had considerable business transactions\nat the Manor, and appreciated Mr. Scales's merits at a handsome\npercentage on the yearly account. He was a highly honorable tradesman,\nbut in this and in other matters submitted to the institutions of his\ncountry; for great houses, as he observed, must have great butlers. He\nreplied to his friend Crowder sententiously.\n\n\"I say nothing. Before I bring words to market, I should like to see 'em\na bit scarcer. There's the land and there's trade--I hold with both. I\nswim with the stream.\"\n\n\"Hey-day, Mr. Sircome! that's a Radical maxim,\" said Mr. Christian, who\nknew that Mr. Sircome's last sentence was his favorite formula. \"I\nadvise you to give it up, else it will injure the quality of your\nflour.\"\n\n\"A Radical maxim!\" said Mr. Sircome, in a tone of angry astonishment. \"I\nshould like to hear you prove that. It's as old as my grandfather,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"I'll prove it in one minute,\" said the glib Christian. \"Reform has set\nin by the will of the majority--that's the rabble, you know; and the\nrespectability and good sense of the country, which are in the minority,\nare afraid of Reform running on too fast. So the stream must be running\ntoward Reform and Radicalism; and if you swim with it, Mr. Sircome,\nyou're a Reformer and a Radical, and your flour is objectionable, and\nnot full weight--and being tried by Scales, will be found wanting.\"\n\nThere was a roar of laughter. This pun upon Scales was highly\nappreciated by every one except the miller and butler. The latter pulled\ndown his waistcoat, and puffed and stared in rather an excited manner.\nMr. Christian's wit, in general, seemed to him a poor kind of quibbling.\n\n\"What a fellow you are for fence, Christian,\" said the gardener. \"Hang\nme, if I don't think you're up to everything.\"\n\n\"That's a compliment you might pay Old Nick, if you come to that,\" said\nMr. Sircome, who was in the painful position of a man deprived of his\nformula.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. Scales; \"I'm no fool myself, and could parry a\nthrust if I liked, but I shouldn't like it to be said of me that I was\nup to everything. I'll keep a little principle if you please.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Christian, ladling out the punch. \"What would justice\nbe without Scales?\"\n\nThe laughter was not quite so full-throated as before. Such excessive\ncleverness _was_ a little Satanic.\n\n\"A joke's a joke among gentlemen,\" said the butler, getting exasperated;\n\"I think there has been quite liberties enough taken with my name. But\nif you must talk about names, I've heard of a party before now calling\nhimself a Christian, and being anything _but_ it.\"\n\n\"Come, that's beyond a joke,\" said the surgeon's assistant, a fast man,\nwhose chief scene of dissipation was the manor. \"Let it drop, Scales.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say it's beyond a joke. I'm not a harlequin to talk nothing\nbut jokes. I leave that to other Christians, who are up to everything,\nand have been everywhere--to the hulks, for what I know; and more than\nthat, they come from nobody knows where, and try to worm themselves into\ngentlemen's confidence, to the prejudice of their betters.\"\n\nThere was a stricter sequence in Mr. Scales's angry eloquence than was\napparent--some chief links being confined to his own breast, as is often\nthe case in energetic discourse. The company were in a state of\nexpectation. There was something behind worth knowing, and something\nbefore them worth seeing. In the general decay of other fine British\npugnacious sports, a quarrel between gentlemen was all the more\nexciting, and though no one would himself have liked to turn on Scales,\nno one was sorry for the chance of seeing him put down. But the amazing\nChristian was unmoved. He had taken out his handkerchief and was rubbing\nhis lips carefully. After a slight pause, he spoke with perfect\ncoolness.\n\n\"I don't intend to quarrel with you, Scales. Such talk as this is not\nprofitable to either of us. It makes you purple in the face--you _are_\napoplectic, you know--and it spoils good company. Better tell a few fibs\nabout me behind my back--it will heat you less, and do me more harm.\nI'll leave you to it; I shall go and have a game of whist with the\nladies.\"\n\nAs the door closed behind the questionable Christian, Mr. Scales was in\na state of frustration that prevented speech. Every one was rather\nembarrassed.\n\n\"That's an uncommon sort o' fellow,\" said Mr. Crowder, in an undertone,\nto his next neighbor, the gardener. \"Why, Mr. Philip picked him up in\nforeign parts, didn't he?\"\n\n\"He was a courier,\" said the gardener. \"He's had a deal of experience.\nAnd I believe, by what I can make out--for he's been pretty free with me\nsometimes--there was a time when he was in that rank of life that he\nfought a duel.\"\n\n\"Ah! that makes him such a cool chap,\" said Mr. Crowder.\n\n\"He's what I call an overbearing fellow,\" said Mr. Sircome, also _sotto\nvoce_, to his next neighbor, Mr. Filmore, the surgeon's assistant. \"He\nruns you down with a sort of talk that's neither here nor there. He's\ngot a deal too many samples in his pocket for me.\"\n\n\"All I know is, he's a wonderful hand at cards,\" said Mr. Filmore, whose\nwhiskers and shirt-pin were quite above the average. \"I wish I could\nplay _\u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9_ as he does; it's beautiful to see him; he can make a man\nlook pretty blue; he'll empty his pocket for him in no time.\"\n\n\"That's none to his credit,\" said Mr. Sircome.\n\nThe conversation had in this way broken up into _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, and the\nhilarity of the evening might be considered a failure. Still the punch\nwas drunk, the accounts were duly swelled, and, notwithstanding the\ninnovating spirit of the time, Sir Maximus Debarry's establishment was\nkept up in sound hereditary British manner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n    \"Rumor doth double like the voice and echo.\"--_Shakespeare._\n\n    The mind of a man is as a country which was once open to squatters,\n    who have bred and multiplied and become masters of the land. But\n    then happeneth a time when new and hungry comers dispute the land;\n    and there is trial of strength, and the stronger wins. Nevertheless\n    the first squatters be they who have prepared the ground, and the\n    crops to the end will be sequent (though chiefly on the nature of\n    the soil, as of light sand, mixed loam, or heavy clay, yet)\n    somewhat on the primal labor and sowing.\n\n\nThat talkative maiden, Rumor, though in the interest of art she is\nfigured as a youthful, winged beauty with flowing garments, soaring\nabove the heads of men, and breathing world-thrilling news through a\ngracefully-curved trumpet, is in fact a very old maid, who puckers her\nsilly face by the fireside, and really does no more than chirp a wrong\nguess or a lame story into the ear of a fellow gossip; all the rest of\nthe work attributed to her is done by the ordinary working of those\npassions against which men pray in the Litany, with the help of a\nplentiful stupidity against which we have never yet had any authorized\nform of prayer.\n\nWhen Mr. Scales's strong need to make an impressive figure in\nconversation, together with his very slight need of any other premise\nthan his own sense of his wide general knowledge and probable\ninfallibility, led him to specify five hundred thousand as the lowest\nadmissible amount of Harold Transome's commercially-acquired fortune, it\nwas not fair to put this down to poor old Miss Rumor, who had only told\nScales that the fortune was considerable. And again, when the curt Mr.\nSircome found occasion at Treby to mention the five hundred thousand as\na fact that folks seemed pretty sure about, this expansion of the butler\ninto \"folks\" was entirely due to Mr. Sircome's habitual preference for\nwords which could not be laid hold of or give people a handle over him.\nIt was in this simple way that the report of Harold Transome's fortune\nspread and was magnified, adding much lustre to his opinion in the eyes\nof Liberals, and compelling even men of the opposite party to admit that\nit increased his eligibility as a member for North Loamshire. It was\nobserved by a sound thinker in these parts that property was ballast;\nand when once the aptness of that metaphor had been perceived, it\nfollowed that a man was not fit to navigate the sea of politics without\na great deal of such ballast; and that, rightly understood, whatever\nincreased the expense of election, inasmuch as it virtually raised the\nproperty qualification, was an unspeakable boon to the country.\n\nMeanwhile the fortune that was getting larger in the imagination of\nconstituents was shrinking a little in the imagination of its owner. It\nwas hardly more than a hundred and fifty thousand; and there were not\nonly the heavy mortgages to be paid off, but also a large amount of\ncapital was needed in order to repair the farm-buildings all over the\nestate, to carry out extensive drainage, and make allowances to\nin-coming tenants, which might remove the difficulties of newly letting\nthe farms in a time of agricultural depression. The farms actually\ntenanted were held by men who had begged hard to succeed their fathers\nin getting a little poorer every year, on land which was also getting\npoorer, where the highest rate of increase was in the arrears of rent,\nand where the master, in crushed hat and corduroys, looked pitiably lean\nand care-worn by the side of pauper laborers, who showed that superior\nassimilating power often observed to attend nourishment by the public\nmoney. Mr. Goffe, of Rabbit's End, had never had it explained to him\nthat, according to the true theory of rent, land must inevitably be\ngiven up when it would not yield a profit equal to the ordinary rate of\ninterest; so that from want of knowing what was inevitable, and not from\na Titanic spirit of opposition, he kept on his land. He often said to\nhimself, with a melancholy wipe of his sleeve across his brow, that he\n\"didn't know which-a-way to turn\"; and he would have been still more at\na loss on the subject if he had quitted Rabbit's End with a wagonful of\nfurniture and utensils, a file of receipts, a wife with five children,\nand a shepherd dog in low spirits.\n\nIt took no long time for Harold Transome to discover this state of\nthings, and to see, moreover, that, except on the demesne immediately\naround the house, the timber had been mismanaged. The woods had been\nrecklessly thinned, and there had been insufficient planting. He had not\nyet thoroughly investigated the various accounts kept by his mother, by\nJermyn, and by Banks the bailiff; but what had been done with the large\nsums which had been received for timber was a suspicious mystery to him.\nHe observed that the farm held by Jermyn was in first-rate order, that a\ngood deal had been spent on the buildings, and that the rent had stood\nunpaid. Mrs. Transome had taken an opportunity of saying that Jermyn had\nhad some of the mortgage deeds transferred to him, and that his rent was\nset against so much interest. Harold had only said, in his careless yet\ndecisive way, \"Oh, Jermyn be hanged! It seems to me if Durfey hadn't\ndied and made room for me, Jermyn would have ended by coming to live\nhere, and you would have had to keep the lodge and open the gate for his\ncarriage. But I shall pay him off--mortgages and all--by-and-by. I'll\nowe him nothing--not even a curse!\" Mrs. Transome said no more. Harold\ndid not care to enter fully into the subject with his mother. The fact\nthat she had been active in the management of the estate--had ridden\nabout it continually, had busied herself with accounts, had been\nhead-bailiff of the vacant farms, and had yet allowed things to go\nwrong--was set down by him simply to the general futility of women's\nattempts to transact men's business. He did not want to say anything to\nannoy her: he was only determined to let her understand, as quietly as\npossible, that she had better cease all interference.\n\nMrs. Transome did understand this; and it was very little that she dared\nto say on business, though there was a fierce struggle of her anger and\npride with a dread which was nevertheless supreme. As to the old\ntenants, she only observed, on hearing Harold burst forth about their\nwretched condition, \"that with the estate so burdened, the yearly loss\nby arrears could better be borne than the outlay and sacrifice necessary\nin order to let the farms anew.\"\n\n\"I was really capable of calculating, Harold,\" she ended, with a touch\nof bitterness. \"It seems easy to deal with farmers and their affairs\nwhen you only see them in print, I dare say; but it's not quite so easy\nwhen you live among them. You have only to look at Sir Maximus's estate:\nyou will see plenty of the same thing. The times have been dreadful and\nold families like to keep their old tenants. But I dare say that is\nToryism.\"\n\n\"It's a hash of odds and ends, if that is Toryism, my dear mother.\nHowever, I wish you had kept three more old tenants; for then I should\nhave had three more fifty-pound voters. And, in a hard run, one may be\nbeaten by a head. But,\" Harold added, smiling and handing her a ball of\nworsted which had fallen, \"a woman ought to be a Tory, and graceful, and\nhandsome, like you. I should hate a woman who took up my opinions and\ntalked for me. I'm an Oriental, you know. I say, mother, shall we have\nthis room furnished with rose-color? I notice that it suits your bright\ngray hair.\"\n\nHarold thought it was only natural that his mother should have been in a\nsort of subjection to Jermyn throughout the awkward circumstances of the\nfamily. It was the way of women, and all weak minds, to think that what\nthey had been used to was unalterable, and any quarrel with a man who\nmanaged private affairs was necessarily a formidable thing. He himself\nwas proceeding very cautiously, and preferred not even to know too much\njust at present, lest a certain personal antipathy he was conscious of\ntoward Jermyn, and an occasional liability to exasperation, should get\nthe better of a calm and clear-sighted resolve not to quarrel with the\nman while he could be of use. Harold would have been disgusted with\nhimself if he had helped to frustrate his own purpose. And his strongest\npurpose now was to get returned for Parliament, to make a figure there\nas a Liberal member, and to become on all grounds a personage of weight\nin North Loamshire.\n\nHow Howard Transome came to be a Liberal in opposition to all the\ntraditions of his family, was a more subtle enquiry than he had ever\ncared to follow out. The newspapers undertook to explain it. The _North\nLoamshire Herald_ witnessed with a grief and disgust certain to be\nshared by all persons who were actuated by wholesome British feeling, an\nexample of defection in the inheritor of a family name which in times\npast had been associated with attachment to right principle, and with\nthe maintenance of our constitution in Church and State; and pointed to\nit as an additional proof that men who had passed any large portion of\ntheir lives beyond the limits of our favored country, usually contracted\nnot only a laxity of feeling toward Protestantism, nay, toward religion\nitself--a latitudinarian spirit hardly distinguishable from atheism--but\nalso a levity of disposition, inducing them to tamper with those\ninstitutions by which alone Great Britain had risen to her pre-eminence\namong the nations. Such men, infected with outlandish habits,\nintoxicated with vanity, grasping at momentary power by flattery of the\nmultitude, fearless because godless, Liberal because un-English, were\nready to pull one stone from under another in the national edifice, till\nthe great structure tottered to its fall. On the other hand, the\n_Duffield Watchman_ saw in this signal instance of self-liberation from\nthe trammels of prejudice, a decisive guarantee of intellectual\npre-eminence, united with a generous sensibility to the claims of man as\nman, which had burst asunder, and cast off, by a spontaneous exertion of\nenergy, the cramping out-worn shell of hereditary bias and class\ninterest.\n\nBut these large-minded guides of public opinion argued from wider data\nthan could be furnished by any knowledge of the particular case\nconcerned. Harold Transome was neither the dissolute cosmopolitan so\nvigorously sketched by the Tory _Herald_, nor the intellectual giant and\nmoral lobster suggested by the Liberal imagination of the _Watchman_.\nTwenty years ago he had been a bright, active, good-tempered lad, with\nsharp eyes and a good aim; he delighted in success and in predominance;\nbut he did not long for an impossible predominance, and become sour and\nsulky because it was impossible. He played at the games he was clever\nin, and usually won; all other games he let alone, and thought them of\nlittle worth. At home and at Eton he had been side by side with his\nstupid elder brother Durfey, whom he despised; and he very early began\nto reflect that since this Caliban in miniature was older than himself,\nhe must carve out his own fortune. That was a nuisance; and on the whole\nthe world seemed rather ill-arranged, at Eton especially, where there\nwere many reasons why Harold made no great figure. He was not sorry the\nmoney was wanting to send him to Oxford; he did not see the good of\nOxford; he had been surrounded by many things during his short life, of\nwhich he had distinctly said to himself that he did not see the good,\nand he was not disposed to venerate on the strength of any good that\nothers saw. He turned his back on home very cheerfully, though he was\nrather fond of his mother, and very fond of Transome Court, and the\nriver where he had been used to fish; but he said to himself as he\npassed the lodge-gates, \"I'll get rich somehow, and have an estate of my\nown, and do what I like with it.\" This determined aiming at something\nnot easy but clearly possible, marked the direction in which Harold's\nnature was strong; he had the energetic will and muscle, the\nself-confidence, the quick perception, and the narrow imagination which\nmake what is admiringly called the practical mind.\n\nSince then his character had been ripened by a various experience, and\nalso by much knowledge which he had set himself deliberately to gain.\nBut the man was no more than the boy writ large, with an extensive\ncommentary. The years had nourished an inclination to as much opposition\nas would enable him to assert his own independence and power without\nthrowing himself into that tabooed condition which robs power of its\ntriumph. And this inclination had helped his shrewdness in forming\njudgments which were at once innovating and moderate. He was addicted at\nonce to rebellion and to conformity, and only an intimate personal\nknowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would\nbegin. The limit was not defined by theory, but was drawn in an\nirregular zigzag by early disposition and association; and his\nresolution, of which he had never lost hold, to be a thorough Englishman\nagain some day, had kept up the habit of considering all his conclusions\nwith reference to English politics and English social conditions. He\nmeant to stand up for every change that the economical condition of the\ncountry required, and he had an angry contempt for men with coronets on\ntheir coaches, but too small a share of brains to see when they had\nbetter make a virtue of necessity. His respect was rather for men who\nhad no coronets, but who achieved a just influence by furthering all\nmeasures which the common-sense of the country, and the increasing\nself-assertion of the majority, peremptorily demanded. He could be such\na man himself.\n\nIn fact Harold Transome was a clever, frank, good-natured egoist; not\nstringently consistent, but without any disposition to falsity; but with\na pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary\nform; unspeculative, unsentimental, unsympathetic; fond of sensual\npleasures, but disinclined to all vice, and attached as a healthy,\nclear-sighted person, to all conventional morality, construed with a\ncertain freedom, like doctrinal articles to which the public order may\nrequire subscription. A character is apt to look but indifferently,\nwritten out in this way. Reduced to a map, our premises seem\ninsignificant, but they make, nevertheless, a very pretty freehold to\nlive in and walk over; and so, if Harold Transome had been among your\nacquaintances, and you had observed his qualities through the medium of\nhis agreeable person, bright smile, and a certain easy charm which\naccompanies sensuousness when unsullied by coarseness--through the\nmedium also of the many opportunities in which he would have made\nhimself useful or pleasant to you--you would have thought him a good\nfellow, highly acceptable as a guest, a colleague, or a brother-in-law.\nWhether all mothers would have liked him as a son is another question.\n\nIt is a fact perhaps kept a little too much in the background, that\nmothers have a self larger than their maternity, and that when their\nsons have become taller than themselves, and are gone from them to\ncollege or into the world, there are wide spaces of their time which are\nnot filled with praying for their boys, reading old letters, and envying\nyet blessing those who are attending to their shirt-buttons. Mrs.\nTransome was certainly not one of those bland, adoring, and gently\ntearful women. After sharing the common dream that when a beautiful\nman-child was born to her, her cup of happiness would be full, she had\ntravelled through long years apart from that child to find herself at\nlast in the presence of a son of whom she was afraid, who was utterly\nunmanageable by her, and to whose sentiments in any given case she\npossessed no key. Yet Harold was a kind son: he kissed his mother's\nbrow, offered her his arm, let her choose what she liked for the house\nand garden, asked her whether she would have bays or grays for her new\ncarriage, and was bent on seeing her make as good a figure in the\nneighborhood as any other woman of her rank. She trembled under this\nkindness: it was not enough to satisfy her; still, if it should ever\ncease and give place to something else--she was too uncertain about\nHarold's feelings to imagine clearly what that something would be. The\nfinest threads, such as no eye sees, if bound cunningly about the\nsensitive flesh, so that the movement to break them would bring torture,\nmay make a worse bondage than any fetters. Mrs. Transome felt the fatal\nthread about her, and the bitterness of this helpless bondage mingled\nitself with the new elegancies of the dining and drawing-rooms, and all\nthe household changes which Harold had ordered to be brought about with\nmagical quickness. Nothing was as she had once expected it would be. If\nHarold had shown the least care to have her stay in the room with\nhim--if he had really cared for her opinion--if he had been what she had\ndreamed he would be in the eyes of those people who had made her\nworld--if all the past could be dissolved, and leave no solid trace of\nitself--mighty _ifs_ that were all impossible--she would have tasted\nsome joy; but now she began to look back with regret to the days when\nshe sat in loneliness among the old drapery, and still longed for\nsomething that might happen. Yet, save in a bitter little speech, or in\na deep sigh, heard by no one besides Denner, she kept all these things\nhidden in her heart, and went out in the autumn sunshine to overlook the\nalterations in the pleasure-grounds very much as a happy woman might\nhave done. One day, however, when she was occupied in this way, an\noccasion came on which she chose to express indirectly a part of her\ninward care.\n\nShe was standing on the broad gravel in the afternoon; the long shadows\nlay on the grass; the light seemed the more glorious because of the\nreddened and golden trees. The gardeners were busy at their pleasant\nwork; the newly-turned soil gave out an agreeable fragrance; and little\nHarry was playing with Nimrod round old Mr. Transome, who sat placidly\non a low garden-chair. The scene would have made a charming picture of\nEnglish domestic life, and the handsome, majestic, gray-haired woman\n(obviously grandmamma) would have been especially admired. But the\nartist would have felt it requisite to turn her face toward her husband\nand little grandson, and to have given her an elderly amiability of\nexpression which would have divided remark with his exquisite rendering\nof her Indian shawl. Mrs. Transome's face was turned the other way, and\nfor this reason she only heard an approaching step, and did not see\nwhose it was; yet it startled her: it was not quick enough to be her\nson's step, and besides, Harold was away at Duffield. It was Mr.\nJermyn's.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n    \"A woman naturally born to fears.\"--_King John._\n\n                                     \"Methinks,\n    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,\n    Is coming toward me; and my inward soul\n    With nothing trembles.\"--_King Richard II._\n\n\nMatthew Jermyn approached Mrs. Transome taking off his hat and smiling.\nShe did not smile, but said--\n\n\"You knew Harold was not at home?\"\n\n\"Yes; I came to see you, to know if you had any wishes that I could\nfurther, since I have not had an opportunity of consulting you since he\ncame home.\"\n\n\"Let us walk toward the Rookery, then.\"\n\nThey turned together, Mr. Jermyn still keeping his hat off and holding\nit behind him; the air was so soft and agreeable that Mrs. Transome had\nnothing but a large veil over her head.\n\nThey walked for a little while in silence till they were out of sight,\nunder tall trees, and treading noiselessly on falling leaves. What\nJermyn was really most anxious about, was to learn from Mrs. Transome\nwhether anything had transpired that was significant of Harold's\ndisposition toward him, which he suspected to be very far from friendly.\nJermyn was not naturally flinty-hearted: at five-and-twenty he had\nwritten verses, and had got himself wet through in order not to\ndisappoint a dark-eyed woman whom he was proud to believe in love with\nhim; but a family man with grown up sons and daughters, a man with a\nprofessional position and complicated affairs that make it hard to\nascertain the exact relation between property and liabilities,\nnecessarily thinks of himself and what may be impending.\n\n\"Harold is remarkably acute and clever,\" he began at last, since Mrs.\nTransome did not speak. \"If he gets into Parliament, I have no doubt he\nwill distinguish himself. He has a quick eye for business of all kinds.\"\n\n\"That is no comfort to me,\" said Mrs. Transome. To-day she was more\nconscious than usual of that bitterness which was always in her mind in\nJermyn's presence, but which was carefully suppressed:--suppressed\nbecause she could not endure that the degradation she inwardly felt\nshould ever become visible or audible in acts or words of her\nown--should ever be reflected in any word or look of his. For years\nthere had been a deep silence about the past between them; on her side\nbecause she remembered; on his, because he more and more forgot.\n\n\"I trust he is not unkind to you in any way. I know his opinions pain\nyou; but I trust you find him in everything else disposed to be a good\nson.\"\n\n\"Oh, to be sure--good as men are disposed to be to women, giving them\ncushions and carriages, and recommending them to enjoy themselves, and\nthen expecting them to be contented under contempt and neglect. I have\nno power over him--remember that--none.\"\n\nJermyn turned to look in Mrs. Transome's face: it was long since he had\nheard her speak to him as if she were losing her self-command.\n\n\"Has he shown any unpleasant feeling about your management of affairs?\"\n\n\"_My_ management!\" Mrs. Transome said, with concentrated rage, flashing\na fierce look at Jermyn. She checked herself: she felt as if she were\nlighting a torch to flare on her own past folly and misery. It was a\nresolve which had become a habit, that she would never quarrel with this\nman--never tell him what she saw him to be. She had kept her woman's\npride and sensibility intact: through all her life there had vibrated\nthe maiden need to have her hand kissed and be the object of chivalry.\nAnd so she sank into silence again, trembling.\n\nJermyn felt annoyed--nothing more. There was nothing in his mind\ncorresponding to the intricate meshes of sensitiveness in Mrs.\nTransome's. He was anything but stupid; yet he always blundered when he\nwanted to be delicate or magnanimous; he constantly sought to soothe\nothers by praising himself. Moral vulgarity cleaved to him like an\nhereditary odor. He blundered now.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Transome,\" he said, in a tone of bland kindness, \"you are\nagitated--you appear angry with me. Yet I think, if you consider, you\nwill see that you have nothing to complain of in me, unless you will\ncomplain of the inevitable course of man's life. I have always met your\nwishes both in happy circumstances and in unhappy ones. I should be\nready to do so now, if it were possible.\"\n\nEvery sentence was as pleasant to her as if it had been cut in her bared\narm. Some men's kindness and love-making are more exasperating, more\nhumiliating than others' derision; but the pitiable woman who has once\nmade herself secretly dependent on a man who is beneath her in feeling,\nmust bear that humiliation for fear of worse. Coarse kindness is at\nleast better than coarse anger; and in all private quarrels the duller\nnature is triumphant by reason of its dullness. Mrs. Transome knew in\nher inmost soul that those relations which had sealed her lips on\nJermyn's conduct in business matters, had been with him a ground for\npresuming that he should have impunity in any lax dealing into which\ncircumstances had led him. She knew that she herself had endured all the\nmore privation because of his dishonest selfishness. And now, Harold's\nlong-deferred heirship, and his return with startlingly unexpected\npenetration, activity, and assertion of mastery, had placed them both in\nthe full presence of a difficulty which had been prepared by the years\nof vague uncertainty as to issues. In this position, with a great dread\nhanging over her, which Jermyn knew, and ought to have felt that he had\ncaused her, she was inclined to lash him with indignation, to scorch him\nwith the words that were just the fit names for his doings--inclined all\nthe more when he spoke with an insolent blandness, ignoring all that was\ntruly in her heart. But no sooner did the words \"You have brought it on\nme\" rise within her than she heard within also the retort, \"You brought\nit on yourself.\" Not for all the world beside could she bear to hear\nthat retort uttered from without. What did she do? With strange sequence\nto all that rapid tumult, after a few moments' silence she said--\n\n\"Let me take your arm.\"\n\nHe gave it immediately, putting on his hat and wondering. For more than\ntwenty years Mrs. Transome had never chosen to take his arm.\n\n\"I have but one thing to ask. Make me a promise.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That you will never quarrel with Harold.\"\n\n\"You must know that it is my wish not to quarrel with him.\"\n\n\"But make a vow--fix it in your mind as a thing not to be done. Bear\nanything from him rather than quarrel with him.\"\n\n\"A man can't make a vow not to quarrel,\" said Jermyn, who was already a\nlittle irritated by the implication that Harold might be disposed to use\nhim roughly. \"A man's temper may get the better of him at any moment. I\nam not prepared to bear _anything_.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" said Mrs. Transome, taking her hand from his arm, \"is it\npossible you don't feel how horrible it would be?\"\n\nAs she took away her hand, Jermyn let his arm fall, put both his hands\nin his pockets, and shrugging his shoulders said, \"I shall use him as he\nuses me.\"\n\nJermyn had turned round his savage side, and the blandness was out of\nsight. It was this that had always frightened Mrs. Transome: there was a\npossibility of fierce insolence in this man who was to pass with those\nnearest to her as her indebted servant, but whose brand she secretly\nbore. She was as powerless with him as she was with her own son.\n\nThis woman, who loved rule, dared not speak another word of attempted\npersuasion. They were both silent, taking the nearest way into the\nsunshine again. There was a half-formed wish in both their minds--even\nin the mother's--that Harold Transome had never been born.\n\n\"We are working hard for the election,\" said Jermyn, recovering\nhimself, as they turned into the sunshine again. \"I think we shall get\nhim returned, and in that case he will be in high good-humor. Everything\nwill be more propitious than you are apt to think. You must persuade\nyourself,\" he added, smiling at her, \"that it is better for a man of his\nposition to be in Parliament on the wrong side than not to be in at\nall.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Transome. \"I am too old to learn to call bitter sweet\nand sweet bitter. But what I may think or feel is of no consequence now.\nI am as unnecessary as a chimney ornament.\"\n\nAnd in this way they parted on the gravel, in that pretty scene where\nthey had met. Mrs. Transome shivered as she stood alone: all around her,\nwhere there had once been brightness and warmth, there were white ashes,\nand the sunshine looked dreary as it fell on them.\n\nMr. Jermyn's heaviest reflections in riding homeward turned on the\npossibility of incidents between himself and Harold Transome which would\nhave disagreeable results, requiring him to raise money, and perhaps\ncausing scandal, which in its way might also help to create a monetary\ndeficit. A man of sixty, with a wife whose Duffield connections were of\nthe highest respectability, with a family of tall daughters, an\nexpensive establishment, and a large professional business, owed a great\ndeal more to himself as the mainstay of all those solidities, than to\nfeelings and ideas which were quite unsubstantial. There were many\nunfortunate coincidences which placed Mr. Jermyn in an uncomfortable\nposition just now; he had not been much to blame, he considered; if it\nhad not been for a sudden turn of affairs no one would have complained.\nHe defied any man to say that he had intended to wrong people; he was\nable to refund, to make reprisals, if they could be fairly demanded.\nOnly he would certainly have preferred that they should not be demanded.\n\nA German poet was entrusted with a particularly fine sausage, which he\nwas to convey to the donor's friend at Paris. In the course of a long\njourney he smelled the sausage; he got hungry, and desired to taste it;\nhe pared a morsel off, then another, and another, in successive moments\nof temptation, till at last the sausage was, humanly speaking, at an\nend. The offence had not been premeditated. The poet had never loved\nmeanness, but he loved sausage; and the result was undeniably awkward.\n\nSo it was with Matthew Jermyn. He was far from liking that ugly\nabstraction rascality, but he had liked other things which had suggested\nnibbling. He had to do many things in law and in daily life which, in\nthe abstract, he would have condemned; and indeed he had never been\ntempted by them in the abstract. Here, in fact, was the inconvenience:\nhe had sinned for the sake of particular concrete things, and particular\nconcrete consequences were likely to follow.\n\nBut he was a man of resolution, who, having made out what was the best\ncourse to take under a difficulty, went straight to his work. The\nelection must be won: that would put Harold in good-humor, give him\nsomething to do, and leave himself more time to prepare for any crisis.\n\nHe was in anything but low spirits that evening. It was his eldest\ndaughter's birthday, and the young people had a dance. Papa was\ndelightful--stood up for a quadrille and a country-dance, told stories\nat supper, and made humorous quotations from his early readings: if\nthese were Latin, he apologized, and translated to the ladies; so that a\ndeaf lady-visitor from Duffield kept her trumpet up continually, lest\nshe should lose any of Mr. Jermyn's conversation, and wished that her\nniece Maria had been present, who was young and had a good memory.\n\nStill the party was smaller than usual, for some families in Treby\nrefused to visit Jermyn, now that he was concerned for a Radical\ncandidate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n    \"He made love neither with roses, nor with apples, nor with locks\n    of hair.\"--THEOCRITUS.\n\n\nOne Sunday afternoon Felix Holt rapped at the door of Mr. Lyon's house,\nalthough he could hear the voice of the minister preaching in the\nchapel. He stood with a book under his arm, apparently confident that\nthere was someone in the house to open the door for him. In fact, Esther\nnever went to chapel in the afternoon: that \"exercise\" made her head\nache.\n\nIn these September weeks Felix had got rather intimate with Mr. Lyon.\nThey shared the same political sympathies; and though, to Liberals who\nhad neither freehold nor copyhold nor leasehold, the share in a county\nelection consisted chiefly of that prescriptive amusement of the\nmajority known as \"looking on,\" there was still something to be said on\nthe occasion, if not to be done. Perhaps the most delightful friendships\nare those in which there is much agreement, much disputation, and yet\nmore personal liking; and the advent of the public-spirited,\ncontradictory, yet affectionate Felix, into Treby life, had made a\nwelcome epoch to the minister. To talk with this young man, who, though\nhopeful, had a singularity which some might at once have pronounced\nheresy, but which Mr. Lyon persisted in regarding as orthodoxy \"in the\nmaking,\" was like a good bite to strong teeth after a too plentiful\nallowance of spoon meat. To cultivate his society with a view to\nchecking his erratic tendencies was a laudable purpose; but perhaps if\nFelix had been rapidly subdued and reduced to conformity, little Mr.\nLyon would have found the conversation much flatter.\n\nEsther had not seen so much of their new acquaintance as her father had.\nBut she had begun to find him amusing, and also rather irritating to her\nwoman's love of conquest. He always opposed and criticised her; and\nbesides that, he looked at her as if he never saw a single detail about\nher person--quite as if she were a middle-aged woman in a cap. She did\nnot believe that he had ever admired her hands, or her long neck, or her\ngraceful movements, which had made all the girls at school call her\nCalypso (doubtless from their familiarity with \"Tel\u00c3\u00a9maque\"). Felix ought\nproperly to have been a little in love with her--never mentioning it, of\ncourse, because that would have been disagreeable, and his being a\nregular lover was out of the question. But it was quite clear that,\ninstead of feeling any disadvantage on his own side, he held himself to\nbe immeasurably her superior: and, what was worse, Esther had a secret\nconsciousness that he was her superior. She was all the more vexed at\nthe suspicion that he thought slightly of her; and wished in her\nvexation that she could have found more fault with him--that she had not\nbeen obliged to admire more and more the varying expressions of his open\nface and his deliciously good-humored laugh, always loud at a joke\nagainst himself. Besides, she could not help having her curiosity roused\nby the unusual combinations both in his mind and in his outward\nposition, and she had surprised herself as well as her father one day by\nsuddenly starting up and proposing to walk with him when he was going to\npay an afternoon visit to Mrs. Holt, to try and soothe her concerning\nFelix. \"What a mother he has!\" she said to herself when they came away\nagain; \"but, rude and queer as he is, I cannot say there is anything\nvulgar about him. Yet--I don't know--if I saw him by the side of a\nfinished gentleman.\" Esther wished that finished gentleman were among\nher acquaintances: he would certainly admire her, and make her aware of\nFelix's inferiority.\n\nOn this particular Sunday afternoon, when she heard the knock at the\ndoor, she was seated in the kitchen corner between the fire and the\nwindow reading \"R\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9.\" Certainly in her well-fitting light-blue\ndress--she almost always wore some shade of blue--with her delicate\nsandaled slipper stretched toward the fire, her little gold watch, which\nhad cost her nearly a quarter's earnings, visible at her side, her\nslender fingers playing with a shower of brown curls, and a coronet of\nshining plaits, at the summit of her head, she was a remarkable\nCinderella. When the rap came, she colored, and was going to shut her\nbook and put it out of the way on the window ledge behind her; but she\ndesisted with a little toss, laid it open on the table beside her, and\nwalked to the outer door, which opened into the kitchen. There was\nrather a mischievous gleam in her face: the rap was not a small one; it\ncame probably from a large personage with a vigorous arm.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Miss Lyon,\" said Felix, taking off his cloth cap: he\nresolutely declined the expensive ugliness of a hat, and in a poked cap\nand without a cravat, made a figure at which his mother cried every\nSunday, and thought of with a slow shake of the head at several passages\nin the minister's prayer.\n\n\"Dear me, it is you, Mr. Holt! I fear you will have to wait some time\nbefore you can see my father. The sermon is not ended yet, and there\nwill be the hymn and the prayer, and perhaps other things to detain\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well, will you let me sit down in the kitchen? I don't want to be a\nbore.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Esther, with her pretty light laugh, \"I always give you\ncredit for not meaning it. Pray come in, if you don't mind waiting. I\nwas sitting in the kitchen: the kettle is singing quite prettily. It is\nmuch nicer than the parlor--not half so ugly.\"\n\n\"There I agree with you.\"\n\n\"How very extraordinary! But if you prefer the kitchen, and don't want\nto sit with me, I can go into the parlor.\"\n\n\"I came on purpose to sit with you,\" said Felix, in his blunt way, \"but\nI thought it likely you might be vexed at seeing me. I wanted to talk to\nyou, but I've got nothing pleasant to say. As your father would have it,\nI'm not given to prophesy smooth things--to prophesy deceit.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Esther, sitting down. \"Pray be seated. You thought\nI had no afternoon sermon, so you came to give me one.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Felix, seating himself sideways in a chair not far off her,\nand leaning over the back to look at her with his large, clear, gray\neyes, \"and my text is something you said the other day. You said you\ndidn't mind about people having right opinions so that they had good\ntaste. Now I want you to see what shallow stuff that is.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't doubt it if you say so. I know you are a person of right\nopinions.\"\n\n\"But by opinions you mean men's thoughts about great subjects, and by\ntaste you mean their thoughts about small ones: dress, behavior,\namusements, ornaments.\"\n\n\"Well--yes--or rather, their sensibilities about those things.\"\n\n\"It comes to the same thing; thoughts, opinions, knowledge, are only a\nsensibility to facts and ideas. If I understand a geometrical problem,\nit is because I have a sensibility to the way in which lines and figures\nare related to each other; and I want you to see that the creature who\nhas the sensibilities that you call taste, and not the sensibilities\nthat you call opinions, is simply a lower, pettier sort of thing--an\ninsect that notices the shaking of the table, but never notices the\nthunder.\"\n\n\"Very well, I am an insect; yet I notice that you are thundering at me.\"\n\n\"No, you are not an insect. That is what exasperates me at your making a\nboast of littleness. You have enough understanding to make it wicked\nthat you should add one more to the women who hinder men's lives from\nhaving any nobleness in them.\"\n\nEsther colored deeply: she resented this speech, yet she disliked it\nless than many Felix had addressed to her.\n\n\"What is my horrible guilt?\" she said, rising and standing, as she was\nwont, with one foot on the fender, and looking at the fire. If it had\nbeen any one but Felix who was near her, it might have occurred to her\nthat this attitude showed her to advantage; but she had only a mortified\nsense that he was quite indifferent to what others praised her for.\n\n\"Why do you read this mawkish stuff on a Sunday, for example?\" he said,\nsnatching up \"R\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9,\" and running his eye over the pages.\n\n\"Why don't you always go to chapel, Mr. Holt, and read Howe's 'Living\nTemple,' and join the church?\"\n\n\"There's just the difference between us--I know why I don't do those\nthings. I distinctly see that I can do something better. I have other\nprinciples, and should sink myself by doing what I don't recognize as\nthe best.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Esther, as lightly as she could, to conceal her\nbitterness. \"I am a lower kind of being, and could not so easily sink\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Not by entering into your father's ideas. If a woman really believes\nherself to be a lower kind of being, she should place herself in\nsubjection: she should be ruled by the thoughts of her father or\nhusband. If not, let her show her power of choosing something better.\nYou must know that your father's principles are greater and worthier\nthan what guides your life. You have no reason but idle fancy and\nselfish inclination for shirking his teaching and giving your soul up to\ntrifles.\"\n\n\"You are kind enough to say so. But I am not aware that I have ever\nconfided my reasons to you.\"\n\n\"Why, what worth calling a reason could make any mortal hang over this\ntrash?--idiotic immorality dressed up to look fine, with a little bit of\ndoctrine tacked to it, like a hare's foot on a dish, to make believe the\nmess is not cat's flesh. Look here! 'Est-ce ma faute, si je trouve\npartout les bornes, si ce qui est fini n'a pour moi aucune valeur?' Yes,\nsir, distinctly your fault, because you're an ass. Your dunce who can't\ndo his sums always has a taste for the infinite. Sir, do you know what a\nrhomboid is? Oh, no, I don't value these things with limits. 'Cependant,\nj'aime la monotonie des sentimens de la vie, et si j'avais encore la\nfolie de croire au bonheur----'\"\n\n\"Oh, pray, Mr. Holt, don't go on reading with that dreadful accent; it\nsets one's teeth on edge.\" Esther, smarting helplessly under the\nprevious lashes, was relieved by this diversion of criticism.\n\n\"There it is!\" said Felix, throwing the book on the table, and getting\nup to walk about. \"You are only happy when you can spy a tag or a tassel\nloose to turn the talk, and get rid of any judgment that must carry\ngrave action after it.\"\n\n\"I think I have borne a great deal of talk without turning it.\"\n\n\"Not enough, Miss Lyon--not all that I came to say. I want you to\nchange. Of course I am a brute to say so. I ought to say you are\nperfect. Another man would, perhaps. But I say I want you to change.\"\n\n\"How am I to oblige you? By joining the Church?\"\n\n\"No; but by asking yourself whether life is not as solemn a thing as\nyour father takes it to be--in which you may be either a blessing or a\ncurse to many. You know you have never done that. You don't care to be\nbetter than a bird trimming its feathers, and pecking about after what\npleases it. You are discontented with the world because you can't get\njust the small things that suit your pleasure, not because it's a world\nwhere myriads of men and women are ground by wrong and misery, and\ntainted with pollution.\"\n\nEsther felt her heart swelling with mingled indignation at this liberty,\nwounded pride at this depreciation, and acute consciousness that she\ncould not contradict what Felix said. He was outrageously ill-bred; but\nshe felt that she should be lowering herself by telling him so, and\nmanifesting her anger; in that way she would be confirming his\naccusation of a littleness that shrank from severe truth; and, besides,\nthrough all her mortification there pierced a sense that this\nexasperation of Felix against her was more complimentary than anything\nin his previous behavior. She had self-command enough to speak with her\nusual silvery voice.\n\n\"Pray go on, Mr. Holt. Relieve yourself of these burning truths. I am\nsure they must be troublesome to carry unuttered.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Felix, pausing, and standing not far off her. \"I\ncan't bear to see you going the way of the foolish women who spoil men's\nlives. Men can't help loving them, and so they make themselves slaves to\nthe petty desires of petty creatures. That's the way those who might do\nbetter spend their lives for nought--get checked in every great\neffort--toil with brain and limb for things that have no more to do with\na manly life than tarts and confectionery. That's what makes women a\ncurse; and life is stunted to suit their littleness. That's why I'll\nnever love, if I can help it; and if I love, I'll bear it, and never\nmarry.\"\n\nThe tumult of feeling in Esther's mind--mortification, anger, the sense\nof a terrible power over her that Felix seemed to have as his angry\nwords vibrated through her--was getting almost too much for her\nself-control. She felt her lips quivering; but her pride, which feared\nnothing so much as the betrayal of her emotion, helped her to a\ndesperate effort. She pinched her own hand hard to overcome her tremor,\nand said, in a tone of scorn--\n\n\"I ought to be very much obliged to you for giving me your confidence so\nfreely.\"\n\n\"Ah! now you are offended with me, and disgusted with me. I expected it\nwould be so. A woman doesn't like a man who tells her the truth.\"\n\n\"I think you boast a little too much of your truth-telling, Mr. Holt,\"\nsaid Esther, flashing out at last. \"That virtue is apt to be easy to\npeople when they only wound others and not themselves. Telling the truth\noften means no more than taking a liberty.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I should have been taking a liberty if I had tried to\ndrag you back by the skirt when I saw you running into a pit.\"\n\n\"You should really found a sect. Preaching is your vocation. It is a\npity you should ever have an audience of only one.\"\n\n\"I see I have made a fool of myself. I thought you had a more generous\nmind--that you might be kindled to a better ambition. But I've set your\nvanity aflame--nothing else. I'm going. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Esther, not looking at him. He did not open the door\nimmediately. He seemed to be adjusting his cap and pulling it down.\nEsther longed to be able to throw a lasso round him and compel him to\nstay, that she might say what she chose to him; her very anger made this\ndeparture irritating, especially as he had the last word, and that a\nvery bitter one. But soon the latch was lifted and the door closed\nbehind him. She ran up to her bedroom and burst into tears. Poor maiden!\nThere was a strange contradiction of impulses in her mind in those first\nmoments. She could not bear that Felix should not respect her, yet she\ncould not bear that he should see her bend before his denunciation. She\nrevolted against his assumption of superiority, yet she felt herself in\na new kind of subjection to him. He was ill-bred, he was rude, he had\ntaken an unwarrantable liberty; yet his indignant words were a tribute\nto her: he thought she was worth more pains than the women of whom he\ntook no notice. It was excessively impertinent in him to tell her of his\nresolving not to love--not to marry--as if she cared about that; as if\nhe thought himself likely to inspire an affection that would incline any\nwoman to marry him after such eccentric steps as he had taken. Had he\never for a moment imagined that she had thought of him in the light of a\nman who would make love to her?----But did he love her one little bit,\nand was that the reason why he wanted her to change? Esther felt less\nangry at that form of freedom; though she was quite sure that she did\nnot love him, and that she could never love any one who was so much of a\npedagogue and master, to say nothing of his oddities. But he wanted her\nto change. For the first time in her life Esther felt herself seriously\nshaken in her self-contentment. She knew there was a mind to which she\nappeared trivial, narrow, selfish. Every word Felix had said to her\nseemed to have burned itself into her memory. She felt as if she should\nforevermore be haunted by self-criticism, and never do anything to\nsatisfy those fancies on which she had simply piqued herself before\nwithout being dogged by inward questions. Her father's desire for her\nconversion had never moved her; she saw that he adored her all the\nwhile, and he never checked her unregenerate acts as if they degraded\nher on earth, but only mourned over them as unfitting her for heaven.\nUnfitness for heaven (spoken of as \"Jerusalem\" and \"glory\"), the prayers\nof a good little father, whose thoughts and motives seemed to her like\nthe \"Life of Dr. Doddridge,\" which she was content to leave unread, did\nnot attack her self-respect and self-satisfaction. But now she had been\nstung--stung even into a new consciousness concerning her father. Was it\ntrue that his life was so much worthier than her own? She could not\nchange for anything Felix said, but she told herself he was mistaken if\nhe supposed her incapable of generous thoughts.\n\nShe heard her father coming into the house. She dried her tears, tried\nto recover herself hurriedly, and went down to him.\n\n\"You want your tea, father; how your forehead burns!\" she said gently,\nkissing his brow, and then putting her cool hand on it.\n\nMr. Lyon felt a little surprise; such spontaneous tenderness was not\nquite common with her; it reminded him of her mother.\n\n\"My sweet child,\" he said gratefully, thinking with wonder of the\ntreasures still left in our fallen nature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n    Truth is the precious harvest of the earth.\n    But once, when harvest waved upon a land,\n    The noisome cankerworm and caterpillar,\n    Locusts, and all the swarming foul-born broods,\n    Fastened upon it with swift, greedy jaws,\n    And turned the harvest into pestilence,\n    Until men said, What profits it to sow?\n\n\nFelix was going to Sproxton that Sunday afternoon. He always enjoyed his\nwalk to that outlying hamlet; it took him (by a short cut) through a\ncorner of Sir Maximus Debarry's park; then across a piece of common,\nbroken here and there into red ridges below dark masses of furze; and\nfor the rest of the way alongside of the canal, where the Sunday\npeacefulness that seemed to rest on the bordering meadows and pastures\nwas hardly broken if a horse pulled into sight along the towing-path,\nand a boat, with a little curl of blue smoke issuing from its tin\nchimney, came slowly gliding behind. Felix retained something of his\nboyish impression that the days in a canal-boat were all like Sundays;\nbut the horse, if it had been put to him, would probably have preferred\na more Judaic or Scotch rigor with regard to canal-boats, or at least\nthat the Sunday towing should be done by asses, as a lower order.\n\nThis canal was only a branch of the grand trunk, and ended among the\ncoal-pits, where Felix, crossing a network of black tram-roads, soon\ncame to his destination--that public institute of Sproxton, known to its\nfrequenters chiefly as Chubb's, but less familiarly as the Sugar Loaf,\nor the New Pits; this last being the name for the more modern and lively\nnucleus of the Sproxton hamlet. The other nucleus, known as the Old\nPits, also supported its \"public,\" but it had something of the forlorn\nair of an abandoned capital; and the company at the Blue Cow was of an\ninferior kind--equal, of course, in the fundamental attributes of\nhumanity, such as desire for beer, but not equal in ability to pay for\nit.\n\nWhen Felix arrived, the great Chubb was standing at the door. Mr. Chubb\nwas a remarkable publican; none of your stock Bonifaces, red, bloated,\njolly, and joking. He was thin and sallow, and was never, as his\nconstant guests observed, seen to be the worse (or the better) for\nliquor; indeed, as among soldiers an eminent general was held to have a\ncharmed life, Chubb was held by the members of the Benefit Club to have\na charmed sobriety, a vigilance over his own interest that resisted all\nnarcotics. His very dreams, as stated by himself, had a method in them\nbeyond the waking thoughts of other men. Pharaoh's dream, he observed,\nwas nothing to them; and, as lying so much out of ordinary experience,\nthey were held particularly suitable for narration on Sunday evenings,\nwhen the listening colliers, well washed and in their best coats, shook\ntheir heads with a sense of peculiar edification which belongs to the\ninexplicable. Mr. Chubb's reasons for becoming landlord of the Sugar\nLoaf, were founded on the severest calculation. Having an active mind,\nand being averse to bodily labor, he had thoroughly considered what\ncalling would yield him the best livelihood with the least possible\nexertion, and in that sort of line he had seen that a \"public\" amongst\nminers who earned high wages was a fine opening. He had prospered\naccording to the merits of such judicious calculation, was already a\nforty-shilling freeholder, and was conscious of a vote for the county.\nHe was not one of those mean-spirited men who found the franchise\nembarrassing, and would rather have been without it: he regarded his\nvote as part of his investment, and meant to make the best of it. He\ncalled himself a straight-forward man, and at suitable moments expressed\nhis views freely; in fact, he was known to have one fundamental division\nfor all opinion--\"my idee\" and \"humbug.\"\n\nWhen Felix approached, Mr. Chubb was standing, as usual, with his hands\nnervously busy in his pockets, his eyes glancing around with a detective\nexpression at the black landscape, and his lipless mouth compressed, yet\nin constant movement. On a superficial view it might be supposed that so\neager-seeming a personality was unsuited to the publican's business; but\nin fact, it was a great provocative to drinking. Like the shrill biting\ntalk of a vixenish wife, it would have compelled you to \"take a little\nsomething\" by way of dulling your sensibility.\n\nHitherto, notwithstanding Felix drank so little ale, the publican\ntreated him with high civility. The coming election was a great\nopportunity for applying his political \"idee,\" which was, that society\nexisted for the sake of the individual, and that the name of that\nindividual was Chubb. Now, for a conjunction of absurd circumstances\ninconsistent with that idea, it happened that Sproxton hereto had been\nsomewhat neglected in the canvass. The head member of the company that\nworked the mines was Mr. Peter Garstin, and the same company received\nthe rent from the Sugar Loaf. Hence, as the person who had the most\npower of annoying Mr. Chubb, and being of detriment to him, Mr. Garstin\nwas naturally the candidate for whom he had reserved his vote. But where\nthere is this intention of ultimately gratifying a gentleman by voting\nfor him in an open British manner on the day of the poll, a man, whether\nPublican or Pharisee (Mr. Chubb used this generic classification of\nmankind as one that was sanctioned by Scripture), is all the freer in\nhis relation with those deluded persons who take him for what he is not,\nand imagine him to be a waverer. But for some time opportunity had\nseemed barren. There were but three dubious votes besides Mr. Chubb's\nin the small district of which the Sugar Loaf could be regarded as the\ncentre of intelligence and inspiration: the colliers, of course, had no\nvotes, and did not need political conversion; consequently, the\ninterests of Sproxton had only been tacitly cherished in the breasts of\ncandidates. But ever since it had been known that a Radical candidate\nwas in the field, that in consequence of this Mr. Debarry had coalesced\nwith Mr. Garstin, and that Sir James Clement, the poor baronet, had\nretired, Mr. Chubb had been occupied with the most ingenious mental\ncombinations in order to ascertain what possibilities of profit to the\nSugar Loaf might lie in this altered state of the canvass.\n\nHe had a cousin in another county, also a publican, but in a larger way,\nand resident in a borough, and from him Mr. Chubb had gathered more\ndetailed political information than he could find in the Loamshire\nnewspapers. He was now enlightened enough to know that there was a way\nof using voteless miners and navvies at nominations and elections. He\napproved of that; it entered into his political \"idee\"; and indeed he\nwould have been for extending the franchise to this class--at least in\nSproxton. If any one had observed that you must draw a line somewhere,\nMr. Chubb would have concurred at once, and would have given permission\nto draw it at a radius of two miles from his own tap.\n\nFrom the first Sunday evening when Felix had appeared at the Sugar Loaf,\nMr. Chubb had made up his mind that this 'cute man who kept himself\nsober was an electioneering agent. That he was hired for some purpose or\nother there was not a doubt; a man didn't come and drink nothing without\na good reason. In proportion as Felix's purpose was not obvious to\nChubb's mind, it must be deep; and this growing conviction had even led\nthe publican on the last Sunday evening privately to urge his mysterious\nvisitor to let a little ale be chalked up for him--it was of no\nconsequence. Felix knew his man, and had taken care not to betray too\nsoon that his real object was so to win the ear of the best fellows\nabout him as to induce them to meet him on a Saturday evening in the\nroom where Mr. Lyon, or one of his deacons, habitually held his\nWednesday preachings. Only women and children, three old men, a\njourneyman tailor, and a consumptive youth, attended those preachings;\nnot a collier had been won from the strong ale of the Sugar Loaf, not\neven a navvy from the muddier drink of the Blue Cow. Felix was sanguine;\nhe saw some pleasant faces among the miners when they were washed on\nSundays; they might be taught to spend their wages better. At all\nevents, he was going to try: he had great confidence in his powers of\nappeal, and it was quite true that he never spoke without arresting\nattention. There was nothing better than a dame school in the hamlet; he\nthought that if he could move the fathers, whose blackened week-day\npersons and flannel caps, ornamented with tallow candles by way of\nplume, were a badge of hard labor, for which he had a more sympathetic\nfibre than for any ribbon in the buttonhole--if he could move these men\nto save something from their drink and pay a school-master for their\nboys, a greater service would be done them than if Mr. Garstin and his\ncompany were persuaded to establish a school.\n\n\"I'll lay hold of them by their fatherhood,\" said Felix; \"I'll take one\nof their little fellows and set him in the midst. Till they can show\nthere's something they love better than swilling themselves with ale,\nextension of the suffrage can never mean anything for them but extension\nof boozing. One must begin somewhere: I'll begin at what is under my\nnose. I'll begin at Sproxton. That's what a man would do if he had a\nred-hot superstition. Can't one work for sober truth as hard as for\nmegrims?\"\n\nFelix Holt had his illusions, like other young men, though they were not\nof a fashionable sort; referring neither to the impression his costume\nand horsemanship might make on beholders, nor to the ease with which he\nwould pay the Jews when he gave a loose to his talents and applied\nhimself to work. He had fixed his choice on a certain Mike Brindle (not\nthat Brindle was his real name--each collier had his _sobriquet_) as the\nman whom he would induce to walk part of the way home with him this very\nevening, and get to invite some of his comrades for the next Saturday.\nBrindle was one of the head miners: he had a bright good-natured face,\nand had given especial attention to certain performances with a magnet\nwhich Felix carried in his pocket.\n\nMr. Chubb, who had also his illusions, smiled graciously as the\nenigmatic customer came up to the door-step.\n\n\"Well, sir, Sunday seems to be your day: I begin to look for you on a\nSunday now.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm a workingman; Sunday is my holiday,\" said Felix, pausing at\nthe door since the host seemed to expect this.\n\n\"Ah, sir, there's many ways of working. I look at it you're one of those\nas work with your brains. That's what I do myself.\"\n\n\"One may do a good deal of that and work with one's hands too.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Mr. Chubb, with a certain bitterness in his smile, \"I've\nthat sort of head that I've often wished I was stupider. I use things\nup, sir; I see into things a deal too quick. I eat my dinner, as you may\nsay, at breakfast-time. That's why I hardly ever smoke a pipe. No sooner\ndo I stick a pipe in my mouth than I puff and puff till it's gone before\nother folks' are well lit; and then, where am I? I might as well have\nlet it alone. In this world it's better not to be too quick. But you\nknow what it is, sir.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Felix, rubbing the back of his head, with a grimace. \"I\ngenerally feel myself rather a blockhead. The world's a largish place,\nand I haven't turned everything inside out yet.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's your deepness. I think we understand one another. And about\nthis here election, I lay two to one we should agree if we was to come\nto talk about it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Felix, with an air of caution.\n\n\"You're none of a Tory, eh, sir? You won't go to vote for Debarry? That\nwas what I said at the very first go-off. Says I, he's no Tory. I think\nI was right, sir--eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I'm no Tory.\"\n\n\"No, no, you don't catch me wrong in a hurry. Well, between you and me,\nI care no more for the Debarrys than I care for Johnny Groats. I live on\nnone o' their land, and not a pot's-worth did they ever send to the\nSugar Loaf. I'm not frightened at the Debarrys: there's no man more\nindependent than me. I'll plump or I'll split for them as treat me the\nhandsomest and are the most of what I call gentlemen; that's my idee.\nAnd in the way of hatching for any man, them are fools that don't employ\nme.\"\n\nWe mortals sometimes cut a pitiable figure in our attempts at display.\nWe may be sure of our own merits, yet fatally ignorant of the point of\nview from which we are regarded by our neighbor. Our fine patterns in\ntattooing may be far from throwing him into a swoon of admiration,\nthough we turn ourselves all round to show them. Thus it was with Mr.\nChubb.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Felix, dryly; \"I should think there are some sorts of work\nfor which you are just fitted.\"\n\n\"Ah, you see that? Well, we understand one another. You're no Tory; no\nmore am I. And if I'd got four hands to show at a nomination, the\nDebarrys shouldn't have one of 'em. My idee is, there's a deal too much\nof their scutchins and their moniments in Treby Church. What's their\nscutchins mean? They're a sign with little liquor behind 'em; that's how\nI take it. There's nobody can give account of 'em as I ever heard.\"\n\nMr. Chubb was hindered from further explaining his views as to the\nhistorical element in society by the arrival of new guests, who\napproached in two groups. The foremost group consisted of well-known\ncolliers, in their good Sunday beavers and colored handkerchiefs serving\nas cravats, with the long ends floating. The second group was a more\nunusual one, and caused Mr. Chubb to compress his mouth and agitate the\nmuscles about it in rather an excited manner.\n\nFirst came a smartly-dressed personage on horseback, with a conspicuous\nexpansive shirt-front and figured satin stock. He was a stout man, and\ngave a strong sense of broadcloth. A wild idea shot through Mr. Chubb's\nbrain; could this grand visitor be Harold Transome? Excuse him: he had\nbeen given to understand by his cousin from the distant borough that a\nRadical candidate in the condescension of canvassing had even gone the\nlength of eating bread-and-treacle with the children of an honest\nfreeman, and declaring his preference for that simple fare. Mr. Chubb's\nnotion of a Radical was that he was a new and agreeable kind of\nlick-spittle who fawned on the poor instead of on the rich, and so was\nlikely to send customers to a \"public\"; so that he argued well enough\nfrom the premises at his command.\n\nThe mounted man of broadcloth had followers: several shabby-looking men,\nand Sproxton boys of all sizes, whose curiosity had been stimulated by\nunexpected largesse. A stranger on horseback scattering half-pence on a\nSunday was so unprecedented that there was no knowing what he might do\nnext; and the smallest hindmost fellows in sealskin caps were not\nwithout hope that an entirely new order of things had set in.\n\nEveryone waited outside for the stranger to dismount, and Mr. Chubb\nadvanced to take the bridle.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Chubb,\" were the first words when the great man was safely\nout of the saddle, \"I've often heard of your fine tap, and I'm come to\ntaste it.\"\n\n\"Walk in, sir--pray walk in,\" said Mr. Chubb, giving the horse to the\nstable-boy. \"I shall be proud to draw for you. If anybody's been\npraising me, I think my ale will back him.\"\n\nAll entered in the rear of the stranger except the boys, who peeped in\nat the window.\n\n\"Won't you please to walk into the parlor, sir,\" said Mr. Chubb,\nobsequiously.\n\n\"No, no, I'll sit down here. This is what I like to see,\" said the\nstranger, looking round at the colliers, who eyed him rather shyly--\"a\nbright hearth where workingmen can enjoy themselves. However, I'll step\ninto the other room for three minutes, just to speak half a dozen words\nwith you.\"\n\nMr. Chubb threw open the parlor door, and then stepping back, took the\nopportunity of saying, in a low tone, to Felix, \"Do you know this\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"Not I; no.\"\n\nMr. Chubb's opinion of Felix Holt sank from that moment. The parlor door\nwas closed, but no one sat down or ordered beer.\n\n\"I say, master,\" said Mike Brindle, going up to Felix, \"don't you think\nthat's one o' the 'lection men?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"I heared a chap say they're up and down everywhere,\" said Brindle; \"and\nnow's the time, they say, when a man can get beer for nothing.\"\n\n\"Ay, that's sin' the Reform,\" said a big, red-whiskered man, called\nDredge. \"That's brought the 'lections and the drink into these parts;\nfor afore that, it was all kep' up the Lord knows wheer.\"\n\n\"Well, but the Reform's niver come anigh Sprox'on,\" said a gray-haired\nbut stalwart man called Old Sleck. \"I don't believe nothing about'n, I\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" said Brindle, with some contempt. \"Well, I do. There's\nfolks won't believe beyond the end o' their own pickaxes. You can't\ndrive nothing into 'em, not if you split their skulls. I know for\ncertain sure, from a chap in the cartin' way, as he's got money and\ndrink too, only for hollering. Eh, master, what do _you_ say?\" Brindle\nended, turning with some deference to Felix.\n\n\"Should you like to know all about the Reform?\" said Felix, using his\nopportunity. \"If you would, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay--tell's; you know I'll be bound,\" said several voices at once.\n\n\"Ah, but it will take some little time. And we must be quiet. The\ncleverest of you--those who are looked up to in the Club--must come and\nmeet me at Peggy Button's cottage next Saturday, at seven o'clock, after\ndark. And, Brindle, you must bring that little yellow-haired lad of\nyours. And anybody that's got a little boy--a very little fellow, who\nwon't understand what is said--may bring him. But you must keep it\nclose, you know. We don't want fools there. But everybody who hears me\nmay come. I shall be at Peggy Button's.\"\n\n\"Why, that's where the Wednesday preachin' is,\" said Dredge. \"I've been\naforced to give my wife a black eye to hinder her from going to the\npreachin'. Lors-a-massy, she thinks she knows better nor me, and I can't\nmake head nor tail of her talk.\"\n\n\"Why can't you let the woman alone?\" said Brindle, with some disgust.\n\"I'd be ashamed to beat a poor crawling thing 'cause she likes\npreaching.\"\n\n\"No more I did beat her afore, not if she scrat' me,\" said Dredge, in\nvindication; \"but if she jabbers at me, I can't abide it. Howsomever,\nI'll bring my Jack to Peggy's o' Saturday. His mother shall wash him. He\nis but four year old, and he'll swear and square at me a good un, if I\nset him on.\"\n\n\"There you go blatherin',\" said Brindle, intending a mild rebuke.\n\nThis dialogue, which was in danger of becoming too personal, was\ninterrupted by the reopening of the parlor door, and the reappearance of\nthe impressive stranger with Mr. Chubb, whose countenance seemed\nunusually radiant.\n\n\"Sit you down here, Mr. Johnson,\" said Chubb, moving an arm-chair. \"This\ngentleman is kind enough to treat the company,\" he added, looking round,\n\"and what's more, he'll take a cup with 'em; and I think there's no man\nbut what'll say that's a honor.\"\n\nThe company had nothing equivalent to a \"hear, hear,\" at command, but\nthey perhaps felt the more, as they seated themselves with an\nexpectation unvented by utterance. There was a general satisfactory\nsense that the hitherto shadowy Reform had at length come to Sproxton in\na good round shape, with broadcloth and pockets. Felix did not intend to\naccept the treating, but he chose to stay and hear, taking his pint as\nusual.\n\n\"Capital ale, capital ale,\" said Mr. Johnson, as he set down his glass,\nspeaking in a quick, smooth treble. \"Now,\" he went on, with a certain\npathos in his voice, looking at Mr. Chubb, who sat opposite, \"there's\nsome satisfaction to me in finding an establishment like this at the\nPits. For what would higher wages do for the workingman if he couldn't\nget a good article for his money? Why, gentlemen\"--here he looked\nround--\"I've been into ale-houses where I've seen a fine fellow of a\nminer or a stone-cutter come in and have to lay down money for beer that\nI should be sorry to give to my pigs!\" Here Mr. Johnson leaned forward\nwith squared elbows, hands placed on his knees, and a defiant shake of\nthe head.\n\n\"Aw, like at the Blue Cow,\" fell in the irrepressible Dredge, in a deep\nbass; but he was rebuked by a severe nudge from Brindle.\n\n\"Yes, yes, you know what it is, my friend,\" said Mr. Johnson, looking at\nDredge, and restoring his self-satisfaction. \"But it won't last much\nlonger, that's one good thing. Bad liquor will be swept away with other\nbad articles. Trade will prosper--and what's trade now without steam?\nand what is steam without coal? And mark you this, gentlemen--there's no\nman and no government can make coal.\"\n\nA loud \"Haw, haw,\" showed that this fact was appreciated.\n\n\"Nor freeston', nayther,\" said a wide-mouthed wiry man called Gills, who\nwished for an exhaustive treatment of the subject, being a stone-cutter.\n\n\"Nor freestone, as you say; else, I think, if coal could be made\nabove-ground, honest fellows who are the pith of our population would\nnot have to bend their backs and sweat in a pit six days out of the\nseven. No, no; I say, as this country prospers it has more and more need\nof you, sirs. It can do without a pack of lazy lords and ladies, but it\ncan never do without brave colliers. And the country _will_ prosper. I\npledge you my word, sirs, this country will rise to the tiptop of\neverything, and there isn't a man in it but what shall have his joint in\nthe pot, and his spare money jingling in his pocket, if we only exert\nourselves to send the right men to Parliament--men who will speak up for\nthe collier, and the stone-cutter, and the navvy\" (Mr. Johnson waved his\nhand liberally), \"and will stand no nonsense. This is a crisis, and we\nmust exert ourselves. We've got Reform, gentlemen, but now the thing is\nto make Reform work. It's a crisis--I pledge you my word it's a crisis.\"\n\nMr. Johnson threw himself back as if from the concussion of that great\nnoun. He did not suppose that one of his audience knew what a crisis\nmeant; but he had large experience in the effect of uncomprehended\nwords; and in this case the colliers were thrown into a state of\nconviction concerning they did not know what, which was a fine\npreparation for \"hitting out,\" or any other act carrying a due sequence\nto such a conviction.\n\nFelix felt himself in danger of getting into a rage. There is hardly any\nmental misery worse than that of having our own serious phrases, our own\nrooted beliefs, caricatured by a charlatan or a hireling. He began to\nfeel the sharp lower edge of his tin pint-measure, and to think it a\ntempting missile.\n\nMr. Johnson certainly had some qualifications as an orator. After this\nimpressive pause he leaned forward again, and said, in a lowered tone,\nlooking round--\n\n\"I think you all know the good news.\"\n\nThere was a movement of shoe-soles on the quarried floor, and a scrape\nof some chair legs, but no other answer.\n\n\"The good news I mean is, that a first-rate man, Mr. Transome, of\nTransome Court, has offered himself to represent you in Parliament,\nsirs. I say you in particular, for what he has at heart is the welfare\nof the workingman--of the brave fellows that wield the pickaxe, and the\nsaw, and the hammer. He's rich--has more money than Garstin--but he\ndoesn't want to keep it to himself. What he wants is, to make a good use\nof it, gentlemen. He's come back from foreign parts with his pockets\nfull of gold. He could buy up the Debarrys, if they were worth buying,\nbut he's got something better to do with his money. He means to use it\nfor the good of the workingmen in these parts. I know there are some men\nwho put up for Parliament and talk a little too big. They may say they\nwant to befriend the colliers, for example. But I should like to put a\nquestion to them. I should like to ask them, 'What colliers?' There are\ncolliers up at Newcastle, and there are colliers down in Wales. Will it\ndo any good to honest Tom, who is hungry in Sproxton, to hear that Jack\nat Newcastle has his belly full of beef and pudding?\"\n\n\"It ought to do him good,\" Felix burst in, with his loud, abrupt voice,\nin odd contrast with glib Mr. Johnson's. \"If he knows it's a bad thing\nto be hungry and not have enough to eat, he ought to be glad that\nanother fellow, who is not idle, is not suffering in the same way.\"\n\nEvery one was startled. The audience was much impressed with the\ngrandeur, the knowledge, and the power of Mr. Johnson. His brilliant\npromises confirmed the impression that Reform had at length reached the\nNew Pits; and Reform, if it were good for anything, must at last resolve\nitself into spare money--meaning \"sport\" and drink, and keeping away\nfrom work for several days in the week. These \"brave\" men of Sproxton\nliked Felix as one of themselves, only much more knowing--as a\nworkingman who had seen many distant parts, but who must be very poor,\nsince he never drank more than a pint or so. They were quite inclined to\nhear what he had got to say on another occasion, but they were rather\nirritated by his interruption at the present moment. Mr. Johnson was\nannoyed, but he spoke with the same glib quietness as before, though\nwith an expression of contempt.\n\n\"I call it a poor-spirited thing to take up a man's straight-forward\nwords and twist them. What I meant to say was plain enough--that no man\ncan be saved from starving by looking on while others eat. I think\nthat's common-sense, eh, sirs?\"\n\nThere was again an approving \"Haw, haw.\" To hear anything said, and\nunderstand it, was a stimulus that had the effect of wit. Mr. Chubb cast\na suspicious and viperous glance at Felix, who felt that he had been a\nsimpleton for his pains.\n\n\"Well, then,\" continued Mr. Johnson, \"I suppose I may go on. But if\nthere is any one here better able to inform the company than I am, I\ngive way--I give way.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Chubb, magisterially, \"no man shall take the words out\nof _your_ mouth in this house. And,\" he added, looking pointedly at\nFelix, \"company that's got no more orders to give, and wants to turn up\nrusty to them that has, had better be making room than filling it. Love\nan' 'armony's the word on our Club's flag, an' love an' 'armony's the\nmeaning of 'The Sugar Loaf, William Chubb.' Folks of a different mind\nhad better seek another house of call.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Felix, laying down his money and taking his cap. \"I'm\ngoing.\" He saw clearly enough that if he said more, there would be a\ndisturbance which could have no desirable end.\n\nWhen the door had closed behind him, Mr. Johnson said, \"What is that\nperson's name?\"\n\n\"Does anybody know it?\" said Mr. Chubb.\n\nA few noes were heard.\n\n\"I've heard him speak like a downright Reformer, else I should have\nlooked a little sharper after him. But you may see he's nothing\npartic'lar.\"\n\n\"It looks rather bad that no one knows his name,\" said Mr. Johnson.\n\"He's most likely a Tory in disguise--a Tory spy. You must be careful,\nsirs, of men who come to you and say they're Radicals, and yet do\nnothing for you. They'll stuff you with words--no lack of words--but\nwords are wind. Now, a man like Transome comes forward and says to the\nworkingmen of this country: 'Here I am, ready to serve you and speak for\nyou in Parliament, and to get the laws made all right for you; and in\nthe meanwhile, if there's any of you who are my neighbors who want a\nday's holiday, or a cup to drink with friends, or a copy of the King's\nlikeness--why, I'm your man. I'm not a paper handbill--all words and no\nsubstance--nor a man with land and nothing else; I've got bags of gold\nas well as land.' I think you know what I mean by the King's likeness.\"\n\nHere Mr. Johnson took a half-crown out of his pocket and held the head\ntoward the company.\n\n\"Well, sirs, there are some men who like to keep this pretty picture a\ngreat deal too much to themselves. I don't know whether I'm right, but I\nthink I've heard of such a one not a hundred miles from here. I think\nhis name was Spratt, and he managed some company's coal-pits.\"\n\n\"Haw, haw! Spratt--Spratt's his name,\" was rolled forth to an\naccompaniment of scraping shoe-soles.\n\n\"A screwing fellow, by what I understand--a domineering fellow--who\nwould expect men to do as he liked without paying them for it. I think\nthere's not an honest man wouldn't like to disappoint such an upstart.\"\n\nThere was a murmur which was interpreted by Mr. Chubb. \"I'll answer for\n'em, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, listen to me. Here's Garstin: he's one of the company you work\nunder. What's Garstin to you? who sees him? and when they do see him\nthey see a thin miserly fellow who keeps his pockets buttoned. He calls\nhimself a Whig, yet he'll split votes with a Tory--he'll drive with the\nDebarrys. Now, gentlemen, if I said I'd got a vote, and anybody asked me\nwhat I should do with it, I should say, 'I'll plump for Transome.'\nYou've got no votes, and that's a shame. But you _will_ have some day,\nif such men as Transome are returned; and then you'll be on a level with\nthe first gentleman in the land, and if he wants to sit in Parliament,\nhe must take off his hat and ask your leave. But though you haven't got\na vote you can give a cheer for the right man, and Transome's not a man\nlike Garstin; if you lost a day's wages by giving a cheer for Transome,\nhe'll make you amends. That's the way a man who has no vote can serve\nhimself and his country; he can lift up his hand and shout 'Transome\nforever!'--'hurray for Transome!' Let the workingmen--let the colliers\nand navvies and stone-cutters, who between you and me have a good deal\ntoo much the worst of it, as things are now--let them join together and\ngive their hands and voices for the right man, and they'll make the\ngreat people shake in their shoes a little; and when you shout for\nTransome, remember you shout for more wages, and more of your rights,\nand you shout to get rid of rats and _sprats_ and such small animals,\nwho are the tools the rich make use of to squeeze the blood out of the\npoor man.\"\n\n\"I wish there'd be a row--I'd pommel him,\" said Dredge, who was\ngenerally felt to be speaking to the question.\n\n\"No, no, my friend--there you're a little wrong. No pommelling--no\nstriking first. There you have the law and the constable against you. A\nlittle rolling in the dust and knocking hats off, a little pelting with\nsoft things that'll stick and not bruise--all that doesn't spoil the\nfun. If a man is to speak when you don't like to hear him, it is but\nfair you should give him something he doesn't like in return. And the\nsame if he's got a vote and doesn't use it for the good of the country;\nI see no harm in splitting his coat in a quiet way. A man must be taught\nwhat's right if he doesn't know it. But no kicks, no knocking down, no\npommelling.\"\n\n\"It 'ud be good fun, though, if so-_be_,\" said Old Sleck, allowing\nhimself an imaginative pleasure.\n\n\"Well, well, if a Spratt wants you to say Garstin, it's some pleasure to\nthink you can say Transome. Now, my notion is this. You are men who can\nput two and two together--I don't know a more solid lot of fellows than\nyou are; and what I say is, let the honest men in this country who've\ngot no vote show themselves in a body when they have got the chance.\nWhy, sirs, for every Tory sneak that's got a vote, there's fifty-five\nfellows who must stand by and be expected to hold their tongues. But I\nsay let 'em hiss the sneaks, let 'em groan at the sneaks, and the sneaks\nwill be ashamed of themselves. The men who've got votes don't know how\nto use them. There's many a fool with a vote, who is not sure in his\nmind whether he shall poll, say for Debarry, or Garstin, or\nTransome--whether he'll plump or whether he'll split; a straw will turn\nhim. Let him know your mind if he doesn't know his own. What's the\nreason Debarry gets returned? Because people are frightened at the\nDebarrys. What's that to you? You don't care for the Debarrys. If people\nare frightened at the Tories, we'll turn round and frighten _them_. You\nknow what a Tory is--one who wants to drive the workingman as he'd drive\ncattle. That's what a Tory is; and a Whig is no better, if he's like\nGarstin. A Whig wants to knock the Tory down and get the whip, that's\nall. But Transome's neither Whig nor Tory; he's the workingman's friend,\nthe collier's friend, the friend of the honest navvy. And if he gets\ninto Parliament, let me tell you it will be better for you. I don't say\nit will be the better for overlookers and screws, and rats and _sprats_;\nbut it will be the better for every good fellow who takes his pot at the\nSugar Loaf.\"\n\nMr. Johnson's exertions for the political education of the Sproxton men\ndid not stop here, which was the more disinterested in him as he did not\nexpect to see them again, and could only set on foot an organization by\nwhich their instruction could be continued without him. In this he was\nquite successful. A man known among the \"butties\" as Pack, who had\nalready been mentioned by Mr. Chubb, presently joined the party, and had\na private audience of Mr. Johnson, that he might be instituted as the\n\"shepherd\" of this new flock.\n\n\"That's a right down genelman,\" said Pack, as he took the seat vacated\nby the orator, who had ridden away.\n\n\"What's his trade, think you?\" said Gills, the wiry stone-cutter.\n\n\"Trade?\" said Mr. Chubb. \"He one of the top sawyers of the country. He\nworks with his head, you may see that.\"\n\n\"Let's have our pipes, then,\" said Old Sleck; \"I'm pretty well tired o'\njaw.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Dredge. \"It's wriggling work--like follering a stoat. It\nmakes a man dry. I'd as lief hear preaching, on'y there's naught to be\ngot by't. I shouldn't know which end I stood on if it wasn't for the\ntickets and the treatin'.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n    \"Oh, sir, 'twas that mixture of spite and over-fed merriment\n    which passes for humor with the vulgar. In their fun, they have\n    much resemblance to a turkey-cock. It has a cruel beak, and\n    a silly iteration of ugly sounds; it spreads its tail in\n    self-glorification, but shows you the wrong side of the\n    ornament--liking admiration, but knowing not what is admirable.\"\n\n\nThis Sunday evening, which promised to be so memorable in the experience\nof the Sproxton miners, had its drama also for those unsatisfactory\nobjects to Mr. Johnson's moral sense, the Debarrys. Certain incidents\noccurring at Treby Manor caused an excitement there which spread from\nthe dining-room to the stables; but no one underwent such agitating\ntransitions of feeling as Mr. Scales. At six o'clock that superior\nbutler was chuckling in triumph at having played a fine and original\npractical joke on his rival, Mr. Christian. Some two hours after that\ntime he was frightened, sorry, and even meek; he was on the brink of a\nhumiliating confession; his cheeks were almost livid; his hair was\nflattened for want of due attention from his fingers; and the fine roll\nof his whiskers, which was too firm to give way, seemed only a sad\nreminiscence of past splendor and felicity. His sorrow came about in\nthis wise.\n\nAfter service on that Sunday morning, Mr. Philip Debarry had left the\nrest of the family to go home in the carriage, and had remained at the\nrectory to lunch with his uncle Augustus, that he might consult him\ntouching some letters of importance. He had returned the letters to his\npocket-book but had not returned the book to his pocket, and he finally\nwalked away leaving the enclosure of private papers and bank-notes on\nhis uncle's escritoire. After his arrival at home he was reminded of his\nomission, and immediately dispatched Christian with a note begging his\nuncle to seal up the pocket-book and send it by the bearer. This\ncommission, which was given between three and four o'clock, happened to\nbe very unwelcome to the courier. The fact was that Mr. Christian, who\nhad been remarkable through life for that power of adapting himself to\ncircumstances which enables a man to fall safely on all-fours in the\nmost hurried expulsions and escapes, was not exempt from bodily\nsuffering--a circumstance to which there is no known way of adapting\none's self so as to be perfectly comfortable under it, or to push it off\non to other people's shoulders. He did what he could: he took doses of\nopium when he had an access of nervous pains, and he consoled himself as\nto future possibilities by thinking that if the pains ever became\nintolerably frequent, a considerable increase in the dose might put an\nend to them altogether. He was neither Cato nor Hamlet, and though he\nhad learned their soliloquies at his first boarding-school, he would\nprobably have increased his dose without reciting those master-pieces.\nNext to the pain itself he disliked that any one should know of it:\ndefective health diminished a man's market value; he did not like to be\nthe object of the sort of pity he himself gave to a poor devil who was\nforced to make a wry face or \"give in\" altogether.\n\nHe had felt it expedient to take a slight dose this afternoon, and still\nhe was not altogether relieved at the time he set off for the rectory.\nOn returning with the valuable case safely deposited in his hind\npocket, he felt increasing bodily uneasiness, and took another dose.\nThinking it likely that he looked rather pitiable, he chose not to\nproceed to the house by the carriage-road. The servants often walked in\nthe park on a Sunday, and he wished to avoid any meeting. He would make\na circuit, get into the house privately, and after delivering his packet\nto Mr. Debarry, shut himself up till the ringing of the half-hour bell.\nBut when he reached an elbowed seat under some sycamores, he felt so ill\nat ease that he yielded to the temptation of throwing himself on it to\nrest a little. He looked at his watch: it was but five; he had done his\nerrand quickly hitherto, and Mr. Debarry had not urged haste. But in\nless than ten minutes he was in a sound sleep. Certain conditions of his\nsystem had determined a stronger effect than usual from the opium.\n\nAs he had expected, there were servants strolling in the park, but they\ndid not all choose the most frequented part. Mr. Scales, in pursuit of a\nlight flirtation with the younger lady's maid, had preferred a more\nsequestered walk in the company of that agreeable nymph. And it happened\nto be this pair, of all others, who alighted on the sleeping\nChristian--a sight which at the very first moment caused Mr. Scales a\nvague pleasure as at an incident that must lead to something clever on\nhis part. To play a trick, and make some one or other look foolish, was\nheld the most pointed form of wit throughout the back regions of the\nManor, and served as a constant substitute for theatrical entertainment:\nwhat the farce wanted in costume or \"make up\" it gained in the reality\nof the mortification which excited the general laughter. And lo! here\nwas the offensive, the exasperatingly cool and superior Christian,\ncaught comparatively helpless, with his head hanging on his shoulder,\nand one coat-tail hanging out heavily below the elbow of the rustic\nseat. It was this coat-tail which served as a suggestion to Mr. Scales's\ngenius. Putting his finger up in warning to Mrs. Cherry, and saying,\n\"Hush--be quiet--I see a fine bit of fun\"--he took a knife from his\npocket, stepped behind the unconscious Christian, and quickly cut off\nthe pendent coat-tail. Scales knew nothing of the errand to the rectory;\nand as he noticed that there was something in the pocket, thought it was\nprobably a large cigar-case. So much the better--he had no time to\npause. He threw the coat-tail as far as he could, and noticed that it\nfell among the elms under which they had been walking. Then, beckoning\nto Mrs Cherry, he hurried away with her toward the more open part of\nthe park, not daring to explode in laughter until it was safe from the\nchance of waking the sleeper. And then the vision of the graceful,\nwell-appointed Mr. Christian, who sneered at Scales about his \"get up,\"\nhaving to walk back to the house with only one tail to his coat, was a\nsource of so much enjoyment to the butler, that the fair Cherry began to\nbe quite jealous of the joke. Still she admitted that it really was\nfunny, tittered intermittently, and pledged herself to secrecy. Mr.\nScales explained to her that Christian would try to creep in unobserved,\nbut that this must be made impossible; and he requested her to imagine\nthe figure this interloping fellow would cut when everybody was asking\nwhat had happened. \"Hallo, Christian! where's your coat tail?\" would\nbecome a proverb at the Manor, where jokes kept remarkably well without\nthe aid of salt; and Mr. Christian's comb would be cut so effectually\nthat it would take a long time to grow again. Exit Scales, laughing, and\npresenting a fine example of dramatic irony to any one in the secret of\nFate.\n\nWhen Christian awoke, he was shocked to find himself in the twilight. He\nstarted up, shook himself, missed something, and soon became aware what\nit was he missed. He did not doubt that he had been robbed, and he at\nonce foresaw that the consequences would be highly unpleasant. In no way\ncould the cause of the accident be so represented to Mr. Philip Debarry\nas to prevent him from viewing his hitherto unimpeachable factotum in a\nnew and unfavorable light. And though Mr. Christian did not regard his\npresent position as brilliant, he did not see his way to anything\nbetter. A man nearly fifty who is not always quite well is seldom\nardently hopeful: he is aware that this is a world in which merit is\noften overlooked. With the idea of robbery in full possession of his\nmind, to peer about and search in the dimness, even if it had occurred\nto him, would have seemed a preposterous waste of time and energy. He\nknew it was likely that Mr. Debarry's pocket-book had important and\nvaluable contents, and that he should deepen his offence by deferring\nhis announcement of the unfortunate fact. He hastened back to the house,\nrelieved by the obscurity from that mortification of his vanity on which\nthe butler had counted. Indeed, to Scales himself the affair had already\nbegun to appear less thoroughly jocose than he had anticipated. For he\nobserved that Christian's non-appearance before dinner had caused Mr.\nDebarry some consternation; and he had gathered that the courier had\nbeen sent on a commission to the rectory. \"My uncle must have detained\nhim for some reason or other,\" he heard Mr. Philip say; \"but it is odd.\nIf he were less trusty about commissions, or had ever seemed to drink\ntoo much, I should be uneasy.\" Altogether the affair was not taking the\nturn Mr. Scales had intended. At last, when dinner had been removed, and\nthe butler's chief duties were at an end, it was understood that\nChristian had entered without his coat tail, looking serious and even\nagitated; that he had asked leave at once to speak to Mr. Debarry, and\nthat he was even then in parley with the gentleman in the dining-room.\nScales was in alarm; it must have been some property of Mr. Debarry's\nthat had weighted the pocket. He took a lantern, got a groom to\naccompany him with another lantern, and with the utmost practical speed\nreached the fatal spot in the park. He searched under the elms--he was\ncertain that the pocket had fallen there--and he found the pocket; but\nhe found it empty, and, in spite of further search, did not find the\ncontents, though he had first consoled himself with thinking that they\nhad fallen out, and would be lying not far off. He returned with the\nlanterns and the coat tail and a most uncomfortable consciousness in\nthat great seat of a butler's emotion, the stomach. He had no sooner\nre-entered than he was met by Mrs. Cherry, pale and anxious, who drew\nhim aside to say that if he didn't tell everything she would; that the\nconstables were to be sent for; that there had been no end of bank-notes\nand letters and things in Mr. Debarry's pocket-book, which Christian was\ncarrying in that very pocket Scales had cut off; that the rector was\nsent for, the constable was coming, and they should all be hanged. Mr.\nScales's own intellect was anything but clear as to the possible issues.\nCrest-fallen, and with the coat-tail in his hands as an attestation that\nhe was innocent of anything more than a joke, he went and made his\nconfession. His story relieved Christian a little, but did not relieve\nMr. Debarry, who was more annoyed at the loss of the letters, and the\nchance of their getting into hands that might make use of them, than at\nthe loss of the bank-notes. Nothing could be done for the present, but\nthat the rector, who was a magistrate, should instruct the constables,\nand that the spot in the park indicated by Scales should again be\ncarefully searched. This was done, but in vain; and many of the family\nat the Manor had disturbed sleep that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n    \"Give sorrow leave awhile, to tutor me\n    To this submission.\"--_Richard II._\n\n\nMeanwhile Felix Holt had been making his way back from Sproxton to Treby\nin some irritation and bitterness of spirit. For a little while he\nwalked slowly along the direct road, hoping that Mr. Johnson would\novertake him, in which case he would have the pleasure of quarrelling\nwith him, and telling him what he thought of his intentions in coming to\ncant at the Sugar Loaf. But he presently checked himself in this folly\nand turned off again toward the canal, that he might avoid the\ntemptation of getting into a passion to no purpose.\n\n\"Where's the good,\" he thought, \"of pulling at such a tangled skein as\nthis electioneering trickery? As long as three-fourths of the men in\nthis country see nothing in an election but self-interest, and nothing\nin self-interest but some form of greed, one might as well try to purify\nthe proceedings of the fishes, and say to a hungry cod-fish--'My good\nfriend, abstain; don't goggle your eyes so, or show such a stupid\ngluttonous mouth, or think the little fishes are worth nothing except in\nrelation to your own inside.' He'd be open to no argument short of\ncrimping him. I should get into a rage with this fellow, and perhaps end\nby thrashing him. There's some reason in me as long as I keep my temper,\nbut my rash humor is drunkenness without wine. I shouldn't wonder if he\nupsets all my plans with these colliers. Of course he's going to treat\nthem for the sake of getting up a posse at the nomination and\nspeechifyings. They'll drink double, and never come near me on a\nSaturday evening. I don't know what sort of man Transome really is. It's\nno use my speaking to anybody else, but if I could get at him, he might\nput a veto on this thing. Though, when once the men have been promised\nand set a-going, the mischief is likely to be past mending. Hang the\nLiberal cod-fish! I shouldn't have minded so much if he'd been a Tory!\"\n\nFelix went along in the twilight struggling in this way with the\nintricacies of life, which would certainly be greatly simplified if\ncorrupt practices were the invariable mark of wrong opinions. When he\nhad crossed the common and had entered the park, the overshadowing trees\ndeepened the gray gloom of the evening; it was useless to try and keep\nthe blind path, and he could only be careful that his steps should be\nbent in the direction of the park gate. He was striding along rapidly\nnow, whistling \"Bannockburn\" in a subdued way as an accompaniment to\nhis inward discussion, when something smooth and soft on which his foot\nalighted arrested him with an unpleasant startling sensation, and made\nhim stoop to examine the object he was treading on. He found it to be a\nlarge leather pocket-book swelled by its contents, and fastened with a\nsealed ribbon as well as a clasp. In stooping he saw about a yard off\nsomething whitish and square lying on the dark grass. This was an\nornamental note-book of pale leather stamped with gold. Apparently it\nhad burst open in falling, and out of the pocket formed by the cover,\nthere protruded a small gold chain about four inches long, with various\nseals and other trifles attached to it by a ring at the end. Felix\nthrust the chain back, and finding that the clasp of the note-book was\nbroken, he closed it and thrust it into his side-pocket, walking along\nunder some annoyance that fortune had made him the finder of articles\nbelonging most probably to one of the family at Treby Manor. He was much\ntoo proud a man to like any contact with the aristocracy, and he could\nstill less endure coming within speech of their servants. Some plan must\nbe devised by which he could avoid carrying these things up to the Manor\nhimself: he thought at first of leaving them at the lodge, but he had a\nscruple against placing property, of which the ownership was after all\nuncertain, in the hands of persons unknown to him. It was possible that\nthe large pocket-book contained papers of high importance, and that it\ndid not belong to any of the Debarry family. He resolved at last to\ncarry his findings to Mr. Lyon, who would perhaps be good-natured enough\nto save him from the necessary transactions with the people at the Manor\nby undertaking those transactions himself. With this determination he\nwalked straight to Malthouse Yard, and waited outside the chapel until\nthe congregation was dispersing, when he passed along the aisle to the\nvestry in order to speak to the minister in private.\n\nBut Mr. Lyon was not alone when Felix entered. Mr. Nuttwood, the grocer,\nwho was one of the deacons, was complaining to him about the obstinate\ndemeanor of the singers, who had declined to change the tunes in\naccordance with a change in the selection of hymns, and had stretched\nshort metre into long out of pure wilfulness and defiance, irreverently\nadapting the most sacred monosyllables to a multitude of quavers,\narranged, it was to be feared, by some musician who was inspired by\nconceit rather than by the true spirit of psalmody.\n\n\"Come in, my friend,\" said Mr. Lyon, smiling at Felix, and then\ncontinuing in a faint voice, while he wiped the perspiration from his\nbrow and bald crown, \"Brother Nuttwood, we must be content to carry a\nthorn in our sides while the necessities of our imperfect state demand\nthat there should be a body set apart and called a choir, whose special\noffice it is to lead the singing, not because they are more disposed to\nthe devout uplifting of praise, but because they are endowed with better\nvocal organs, and have attained more of the musician's art. For all\noffice, unless it be accompanied by peculiar grace, becomes, as it were,\na diseased organ, seeking to make itself too much of a centre. Singers,\nspecially so called, are, it must be confessed, an anomaly among us who\nseek to reduce the Church to its primitive simplicity, and to cast away\nall that may obstruct the direct communion of spirit with spirit.\"\n\n\"They are so headstrong,\" said Mr. Nuttwood, in a tone of sad\nperplexity, \"that if we dealt not warily with them they might end in\ndividing the church, even now that we have had the chapel enlarged.\nBrother Kemp would side with them, and draw the half part of the members\nafter him. I cannot but think it a snare when a professing Christian has\na bass voice like Brother Kemp's. It makes him desire to be heard of\nmen; but the weaker song of the humble may have more power in the ear of\nGod.\"\n\n\"Do you think it any better vanity to flatter yourself that God likes to\nhear you, though men don't?\" said Felix, with unwarrantable bluntness.\n\nThe civil grocer was prepared to be scandalized by anything that came\nfrom Felix. In common with many hearers in Malthouse Yard, he already\nfelt an objection to a young man who was notorious for having interfered\nin a question of wholesale and retail, which should have been left to\nProvidence. Old Mr. Holt, being a church member, had probably had\n\"leadings\" which were more to be relied on than his son's boasted\nknowledge. In any case, a little visceral disturbance and inward\nchastisement to the consumers of questionable medicines would tend less\nto obscure the divine glory than a show of punctilious morality in one\nwho was not a \"professor.\" Besides, how was it to be known that the\nmedicines would not be blessed, if taken with due trust in a higher\ninfluence? A Christian must consider not the medicines alone in their\nrelation to our frail bodies (which are dust), but the medicines with\nOmnipotence behind them. Hence a pious vendor will look for \"leadings,\"\nand he is likely to find them in the cessation of demand and the\ndisproportion of expenses and returns. The grocer was thus on his guard\nagainst the presumptuous disputant.\n\n\"Mr. Lyon may understand you, sir,\" he replied. \"He seems to be fond of\nyour conversation. But you have too much of the pride of human learning\nfor me. I follow no new lights.\"\n\n\"Then follow an old one,\" said Felix, mischievously disposed toward a\nsleek tradesman. \"Follow the light of the old-fashioned Presbyterians\nthat I've heard sing at Glasgow. The preacher gives out the psalm, and\nthen everybody sings a different tune, as it happens to turn up in their\nthroats. It's a domineering thing to set a tune and expect everybody\nelse to follow it. It's a denial of private judgment.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, my young friend,\" said Mr. Lyon, hurt by this levity, which\nglanced at himself as well as at the deacon. \"Play not with paradoxes.\nThat caustic which you handle in order to scorch others, may happen to\nsear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things. 'Tis\ndifficult enough to see our way and keep our torch steady in this dim\nlabyrinth: to whirl the torch and dazzle the eyes of our fellow-seekers\nis a poor daring, and may end in total darkness. You yourself are a\nlover of freedom, and a bold rebel against usurping authority. But the\nright to rebellion is the right to seek a higher rule, and not to wander\nin mere lawlessness. Wherefore, I beseech you, seem not to say that\nliberty is license. And I apprehend--though I am not endowed with an ear\nto seize those earthly harmonies, which to some devout souls have\nseemed, as it were, the broken echoes of the heavenly choir--I apprehend\nthat there is a law in music, disobedience whereunto would bring us in\nour singing to the level of shrieking maniacs or howling beasts: so that\nherein we are well instructed how true liberty can be nought but the\ntransfer of obedience from the will of one or of a few men to that will\nwhich is the norm or rule for all men. And though the transfer may\nsometimes be but an erroneous direction of search, yet is the search\ngood and necessary to the ultimate finding. And even as in music, where\nall obey and concur to one end, so that each has the joy of contributing\nto a whole whereby he is ravished and lifted up into the courts of\nheaven, so will it be in that crowning time of the millennial reign,\nwhen our daily prayer will be fulfilled, and one law shall be written on\nall hearts, and be the very structure of all thought, and be the\nprinciple of all action.\"\n\nTired, even exhausted, as the minister had been when Felix Holt entered,\nthe gathering excitement of speech gave more and more energy to his\nvoice and manner; he walked away from the vestry table, he paused, and\ncame back to it; he walked away again, then came back, and ended with\nhis deepest toned largo, keeping his hands clasped behind him, while his\nbrown eyes were bright with the lasting youthfulness of enthusiastic\nthought and love. But to any one who had no share in the energies that\nwere thrilling his little body, he would have looked queer enough. No\nsooner had he finished his eager speech, than he held out his hand to\nthe deacon, and said, in his former faint tone of fatigue--\n\n\"God be with you, brother. We shall meet to-morrow, and we will see what\ncan be done to subdue these refractory spirits.\"\n\nWhen the deacon was gone, Felix said, \"Forgive me, Mr. Lyon; I was\nwrong, and you are right.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my friend, you have that mark of grace within you, that you\nare ready to acknowledge the justice of a rebuke. Sit down; you have\nsomething to say--some packet there.\"\n\nThey sat down at a corner of the small table, and Felix drew the\nnote-book from his pocket to lay it down with the pocket-book, saying--\n\n\"I've had the ill-luck to be the finder of these things in the Debarrys'\npark. Most likely they belong to one of the family at the Manor, or to\nsome grandee who is staying there. I hate having anything to do with\nsuch people. They'll think me a poor rascal, and offer me money. You are\na known man, and I thought you would be kind enough to relieve me by\ntaking charge of these things, and writing to Debarry, not mentioning\nme, and asking him to send some one for them, I found them on the grass\nin the park this evening about half-past seven, in the corner we cross\ngoing to Sproxton.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Mr. Lyon, \"this little book is open; we may venture to look\nin it for some sign of ownership. There be others who possess property,\nand might be crossing that end of the park, besides the Debarrys.\"\n\nAs he lifted the note-book close to his eyes, the chain again slipped\nout. He arrested it and held it in his hand, while he examined some\nwriting, which appeared to be a name on the inner leather. He looked\nlong, as if he were trying to decipher something that was partly rubbed\nout; and his hands began to tremble noticeably. He made a movement in an\nagitated manner, as if he were going to examine the chain and seals,\nwhich he held in his hand. But he checked himself, closed his hand\nagain, and rested it on the table, while with the other hand he pressed\nthe sides of the note-book together.\n\nFelix observed his agitation, and was much surprised; but with a\ndelicacy of which he was capable under all his abruptness, he said, \"You\nare overcome with fatigue, sir. I was thoughtless to tease you with\nthese matters at the end of Sunday, when you have been preaching three\nsermons.\"\n\nMr. Lyon did not speak for a few moments, but at last he said--\n\n\"It is true. I am overcome. It was a name I saw--a name that called up a\npast sorrow. Fear not; I will do what is needful with these things. You\nmay trust them to me.\"\n\nWith trembling fingers he replaced the chain, and tied both the large\npocket-book and the note-book in his handkerchief. He was evidently\nmaking a great effort over himself. But when he had gathered the knot of\nthe handkerchief in his hand he said--\n\n\"Give me your arm to the door, my friend. I feel ill. Doubtless I am\nover-wearied.\"\n\nThe door was already open, and Lyddy was watching for her master's\nreturn. Felix therefore said good-night and passed on, sure that this\nwas what Mr. Lyon would prefer. The minister's supper of warm porridge\nwas ready by the kitchen-fire, where he always took it on a Sunday\nevening, and afterward smoked his weekly pipe up the broad chimney--the\none great relaxation he allowed himself. Smoking, he considered, was a\nrecreation of the travailled spirit, which, if indulged in, might endear\nthis world to us by the ignoble bonds of mere sensuous ease. Daily\nsmoking might be lawful, but it was not expedient. And in this Esther\nconcurred with a doctrinal eagerness that was unusual in her. It was her\nhabit to go to her own room, professedly to bed, very early on\nSundays--immediately on her return from chapel--that she might avoid her\nfather's pipe. But this evening she had remained at home, under a true\nplea of not feeling well; and when she heard him enter, she ran out of\nthe parlor to meet him.\n\n\"Father, you are ill,\" she said, as he tottered to the wicker-bottomed\narm-chair, while Lyddy stood by, shaking her head.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" he answered feebly, as she took off his hat and looked in\nhis face enquiringly; \"I am weary.\"\n\n\"Let me lay these things down for you,\" said Esther, touching the bundle\nin the handkerchief.\n\n\"No; they are matters which I have to examine,\" he said, laying them on\nthe table, and putting his arm across them. \"Go you to bed, Lyddy.\"\n\n\"Not me, sir. If ever a man looked as if he was struck with death, it's\nyou, this very night as here is.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Lyddy,\" said Esther, angrily. \"Go to bed when my father\ndesires it. I will stay with him.\"\n\nLyddy was electrified by surprise at this new behavior of Miss Esther's.\nShe took her candle silently and went.\n\n\"Go you too, my dear,\" said Mr. Lyon, tenderly, giving his hand to\nEsther, when Lyddy was gone. \"It is your wont to go early. Why are you\nup?\"\n\n\"Let me lift your porridge from before the fire, and stay with you,\nfather. You think I'm so naughty that I don't like doing anything for\nyou,\" said Esther, smiling rather sadly at him.\n\n\"Child, what has happened? You have become the image of your mother\nto-night,\" said the minister, in a loud whisper. The tears came and\nrelieved him while Esther, who had stooped to lift the porridge from the\nfender, paused on one knee and looked up at him.\n\n\"She was very good to you?\" asked Esther, softly.\n\n\"Yes, dear. She did not reject my affection. She thought not scorn of my\nlove. She would have forgiven me, if I had erred against her, from very\ntenderness. Could you forgive me, child?\"\n\n\"Father, I have not been good to you; but I will be, I will be,\" said\nEsther, laying her head on his knee.\n\nHe kissed her head. \"Go to bed, dear; I would be alone.\"\n\nWhen Esther was lying down that night, she felt as if the little\nincidents between herself and her father on this Sunday had made it an\nepoch. Very slight words and deeds may have a sacramental efficacy, if\nwe can cast our self-love behind us, in order to say or do them. And it\nhas been well believed through many ages that the beginning of\ncompunction is the beginning of a new life; that the mind which sees\nitself blameless may be called dead in trespasses--in trespasses on the\nlove of others, in trespasses on their weakness, in trespasses on all\nthose great claims which are the image of our own need.\n\nBut Esther persisted in assuring herself that she was not bending to any\ncriticism from Felix. She was full of resentment against his rudeness,\nand yet more against his too harsh conception of her character. She was\ndetermined to keep as much at a distance from him as possible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n    This man's metallic; at a sudden blow\n    His soul rings hard. I cannot lay my palm,\n    Trembling with life, upon that jointed brass.\n    I shudder at the cold unanswering touch;\n    But if it press me in response, I'm bruised.\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Debarrys, including the rector, who had\nridden over to the Manor early, were still seated at breakfast,\nChristian came in with a letter, saying that it had been brought by a\nman employed at the chapel in Malthouse Yard, who had been ordered by\nthe minister to use all speed and care in the delivery.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Sir Maximus.\n\n\"Stay, Christian, it may possibly refer to the lost pocket-book,\" said\nPhilip Debarry, who was beginning to feel rather sorry for his factotum,\nas a reaction from previous suspicions and indignation.\n\nSir Maximus opened the letter and felt for his glasses, but then said,\n\"Here, you read it, Phil: the man writes a hand like small print.\"\n\nPhilip cast his eyes over it, and then read aloud in a tone of\nsatisfaction:--\n\n    SIR,--I send this letter to apprise you that I have now in my\n    possession certain articles, which, last evening, at about\n    half-past seven o'clock, were found lying on the grass at the\n    western extremity of your park. The articles are =1=, a well-filled\n    pocket-book, of brown leather, fastened with a black ribbon and\n    with a seal of red wax; =2=, a small note-book, covered with gilded\n    vellum, whereof the clasp was burst, and from out whereof had\n    partly escaped a small chain, with seals and a locket attached, the\n    locket bearing on the back a device, and round the face a female\n    name.\n\n    Whereof I request that you will further my effort to place these\n    articles in the right hands, by ascertaining whether any person\n    within your walls claims them as his property, and by sending that\n    person to me (if such be found); for I will on no account let them\n    pass from my care save into that of one who, declaring himself to\n    be the owner, can state to me what is the impression on the seal,\n    and what the device and name upon the locket.\n\n    I am, sir, yours to command in all right dealing,\n\n    Malthouse Yard. Oct. 3, 1832.                    RUFUS LYON.\n\n\"Well done, old Lyon,\" said the rector; \"I didn't think that any\ncomposition of his would ever give me so much pleasure.\"\n\n\"What an old fox it is!\" said Sir Maximus. \"Why couldn't he send the\nthings to me at once along with the letter?\"\n\n\"No, no, Max; he uses a justifiable caution,\" said the rector, a refined\nand rather severe likeness of his brother, with a ring of fearlessness\nand decision in his voice which startled all flaccid men and unruly\nboys. \"What are you going to do, Phil?\" he added, seeing his nephew\nrise.\n\n\"To write, of course. Those other matters are yours, I suppose?\" said\nMr. Debarry, looking at Christian.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall send you with a letter to the preacher. You can describe your\nown property. And the seal, uncle--was it your coat-of-arms?\"\n\n\"No, it was this head of Achilles. Here, I can take it off the ring, and\nyou can carry it, Christian. But don't lose that, for I've had it ever\nsince eighteen hundred. I should like to send my compliments with it,\"\nthe rector went on, looking at his brother, \"and beg that since he has\nso much wise caution at command, he would exercise a little in more\npublic matters, instead of making himself a firebrand in my parish, and\nteaching hucksters and tape-weavers that it's their business to dictate\nto statesmen.\"\n\n\"How did Dissenters, and Methodists, and Quakers, and people of that\nsort first come up, uncle?\" said Miss Selina, a radiant girl of\ntwenty, who had given much time to the harp.\n\n\"Dear me, Selina,\" said her elder sister, Harriet, whose forte was\ngeneral knowledge, \"don't you remember 'Woodstock'? They were in\nCromwell's time.\"\n\n\"Oh! Holdenough, and those people? Yes; but they preached in the\nchurches; they had no chapels. Tell me, uncle Gus; I like to be wise,\"\nsaid Selina, looking up at the face which was smiling down on her with a\nsort of severe benignity. \"Phil says I'm an ignorant puss.\"\n\n\"The seeds of Nonconformity were sown at the Reformation, my dear, when\nsome obstinate man made scruples about surplices and the place of the\ncommunion-table, and other trifles of that sort. But the Quakers came up\nabout Cromwell's time, and the Methodists only in the last century. The\nfirst Methodists were regular clergymen, the more's the pity.\"\n\n\"But all those wrong things, why didn't government put them down?\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure,\" fell in Sir Maximus, in a cordial tone of\ncorroboration.\n\n\"Because error is often strong, and government is often weak, my dear.\nWell, Phil, have you finished your letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will read it to you,\" said Philip, turning and leaning over the\nback of his chair with the letter in his hand.\n\nThere is a portrait of Mr. Philip Debarry still to be seen at Treby\nManor, and a very fine bust of him at Rome, where he died fifteen years\nlater, a convert to Catholicism. His face would have been plain but for\nthe exquisite setting of his hazel eyes, which fascinated even the dogs\nof the household. The other features, though slight and irregular, were\nredeemed from triviality by the stamp of gravity and intellectual\npreoccupation in his face and bearing. As he read aloud, his voice was\nwhat his uncle's might have been if it had been modulated by delicate\nhealth and a visitation of self-doubt.\n\n    SIR,--In reply to the letter with which you have favored me this\n    morning, I beg to state that the articles you describe were lost\n    from the pocket of my servant, who is the bearer of this letter to\n    you, and is the claimant of the vellum note-book and the gold\n    chain. The large leathern pocket-book is my own property and the\n    impression on the wax, a helmeted head of Achilles, was made by my\n    uncle, the Reverend Augustus Debarry, who allows me to forward this\n    seal to you in proof that I am not making a mistaken claim.\n\n    I feel myself under deep obligation to you, sir, for the care and\n    trouble you have taken in order to restore to its right owner a\n    piece of property which happens to be of particular importance to\n    me. And I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you\n    can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as\n    lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy\n    relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct.\n\n   I remain, sir, your obliged and faithful servant,\n                                                 PHILIP DEBARRY.\n\n\"You know best, Phil, of course,\" said Sir Maximus, pushing his plate\nfrom him, by way of interjection. \"But it seems to me you exaggerate\npreposterously every little service a man happens to do for you. Why\nshould you make a general offer of that sort? How do you know what he\nwill be asking you to do? Stuff and nonsense! Tell Willis to send him a\nfew head of game. You should think twice before you give a blank check\nof that sort to one of these quibbling, meddlesome Radicals.\"\n\n\"You are afraid of my committing myself to 'the bottomless perjury of an\net cetera,'\" said Philip, smiling, as he turned to fold his letter. \"But\nI think I am not doing any mischief; at all events I could not be\ncontent to say less. And I have a notion that he would regard a present\nof game just now as an insult. I should, in his place.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you; but you don't make yourself a measure of Dissenting\npreachers, I hope,\" said Sir Maximus, rather wrathfully. \"What do you\nsay, Gus?\"\n\n\"Phil is right,\" said the rector, in an absolute tone. \"I would not deal\nwith a Dissenter, or put profits into the pocket of a Radical which I\nmight put into the pocket of a good Churchman and a quiet subject. But\nif the greatest scoundrel in the world made way for me, or picked my hat\nup, I would thank him. So would you, Max.\"\n\n\"Pooh! I didn't mean that one shouldn't behave like a gentleman,\" said\nSir Maximus, in some vexation. He had great pride in his son's\nsuperiority even to himself; but he did not quite trust the dim vision\nopened by Phil's new words and new notions. He could only submit in\nsilence while the letter was delivered to Christian, with the order to\nstart for Malthouse Yard immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, in that somewhat dim locality the possible claimant of the\nnote-book and the chain was thought of and expected with palpitating\nagitation. Mr. Lyon was seated in his study, looking haggard and already\naged from a sleepless night. He was so afraid lest his emotion should\ndeprive him of the presence of mind necessary to the due attention to\nparticulars in the coming interview, that he continued to occupy his\nsight and touch with the objects which had stirred the depths, not only\nof memory, but of dread. Once again he unlocked a small box which stood\nbeside his desk, and took from it a little oval locket, and compared\nthis with one which hung with the seals on the stray gold chain. There\nwas the same device in enamel on the back of both: clasped hands\nsurrounded with blue flowers. Both had round the face a name in gold\nitalics on a blue ground: the name on the locket taken from the drawer\nwas _Maurice_; the name on the locket which hung with the seals was\n_Annette_, and within the circle of this name there was a lover's knot\nof light brown hair, which matched a curl that lay in the box. The hair\nin the locket which bore the name of Maurice was of a very dark brown,\nand before returning it to the drawer Mr. Lyon noted the color and\nquality of this hair more carefully than ever. Then he recurred to the\nnote-book: undoubtedly there had been something, probably a third name,\nbeyond the names _Maurice Christian_, which had themselves been rubbed\nand slightly smeared as if by accident; and from the very first\nexamination in the vestry, Mr. Lyon could not prevent himself from\ntransferring the mental image of the third name in faint lines to the\nrubbed leather. The leaves of the note-book seemed to have been recently\ninserted; they were of fresh white paper, and only bore some\nabbreviations in pencil with a notation of small sums. Nothing could be\ngathered from the comparison of the writing in the book with that of the\nyellow letters which lay in the box; the smeared name had been carefully\nprinted, and so bore no resemblance to the signature of those letters;\nand the pencil abbreviations and figures had been made too hurriedly to\nbear any decisive witness. \"I will ask him to write--to write a\ndescription of the locket,\" had been one of Mr. Lyon's thoughts; but he\nfaltered in that intention. His power of fulfilling it must depend on\nwhat he saw in this visitor, of whose coming he had a horrible dread, at\nthe very time he was writing to demand it. In that demand he was obeying\nthe voice of his rigid conscience, which had never left him perfectly at\nrest under his one act of deception--the concealment from Esther that he\nwas not her natural father, the assertion of a false claim upon her.\n\"Let my path be henceforth simple,\" he had said to himself in the\nanguish of that night; \"let me seek to know what is, and if possible to\ndeclare it.\" If he was really going to find himself face to face with\nthe man who had been Annette's husband, and who was Esther's father--if\nthat wandering of his from the light had brought the punishment of a\nblind sacrilege as the issue of a conscious transgression,--he prayed\nthat he might be able to accept all consequences of pain to himself. But\nhe saw other possibilities concerning the claimant of the book and\nchain. His ignorance and suspicions as to the history and character of\nAnnette's husband made it credible that he had laid a plan for\nconvincing her of his death as a means of freeing himself from a\nburdensome tie; but it seemed equally probable that he was really dead,\nand that these articles of property had been a bequest, or a payment, or\neven a sale, to their present owner. Indeed, in all these years there was\nno knowing into how many hands such pretty trifles might have passed.\nAnd the claimant might, after all, have no connection with the Debarrys;\nhe might not come on this day or the next. There might be more time left\nfor reflection and prayer.\n\nAll these possibilities, which would remove the pressing need for\ndifficult action, Mr. Lyon represented to himself, but he had no\neffective belief in them; his belief went with his strongest feeling,\nand in these moments his strongest feeling was dead. He trembled under\nthe weight that seemed already added to his own sin; he felt himself\nalready confronted by Annette's husband and Esther's father. Perhaps the\nfather was a gentleman on a visit to the Debarrys. There was no\nhindering the pang with which the old man said to himself--\n\n\"The child will not be sorry to leave this poor home, and I shall be\nguilty in her sight.\"\n\nHe was walking about among the rows of books when there came a loud rap\nat the outer door. The rap shook him so that he sank into his chair,\nfeeling almost powerless. Lyddy presented herself.\n\n\"Here's ever such a fine man from the Manor wants to see you, sir. Dear\nheart, dear heart! shall I tell him you're too bad to see him?\"\n\n\"Show him up,\" said Mr. Lyon, making an effort to rally. When Christian\nappeared, the minister half rose, leaning on an arm of his chair, and\nsaid, \"Be seated, sir,\" seeing nothing but that a tall man was entering.\n\n\"I've brought you a letter from Mr. Debarry,\" said Christian, in an\noff-hand manner. The rusty little man, in his dismal chamber, seemed to\nthe Ulysses of the steward's room a pitiable sort of human curiosity, to\nwhom a man of the world would speak rather loudly, in accommodation to\nan eccentricity which was likely to be accompanied with deafness. One\ncannot be eminent in everything; and if Mr. Christian had dispersed his\nfaculties in study that would have enabled him to share unconventional\npoints of view, he might have worn a mistaken kind of boot, and been\nless competent to win at _\u00c3\u00a9cart\u00c3\u00a9_, or at betting, or in any other\ncontest suitable to a person of figure.\n\nAs he seated himself, Mr. Lyon opened the letter, and held it close to\nhis eyes, so that his face was hidden. But at the word \"servant\" he\ncould not avoid starting, and looking off the letter toward the bearer.\nChristian, knowing what was in the letter, conjectured that the old man\nwas amazed to learn that so distinguished-looking a personage was a\nservant; he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees, balanced his\ncane on his fingers, and began a whispering whistle. The minister\nchecked himself, finished the reading of the letter, and then slowly and\nnervously put on his spectacles to survey this man, between whose fate\nand his own there might be a terrible collision. The word \"servant\" had\nbeen a fresh caution to him. He must do nothing rashly. Esther's lot was\ndeeply concerned.\n\n\"Here is the seal mentioned in the letter,\" said Christian.\n\nMr. Lyon drew the pocket-book from his desk, and after comparing the\nseal with the impression, said, \"It is right, sir: I deliver the\npocket-book to you.\"\n\nHe held it out with the seal, and Christian rose to take them, saying\ncarelessly, \"The other things--the chain and the little book--are mine.\"\n\n\"Your name then is----\"\n\n\"Maurice Christian.\"\n\nA spasm shot through Mr. Lyon. It had seemed possible that he might hear\nanother name, and be freed from the worse half of his anxiety. His next\nwords were not wisely chosen, but escaped him impulsively.\n\n\"And you have no other name?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Christian, sharply.\n\n\"Be so good as to reseat yourself.\"\n\nChristian did not comply. \"I'm rather in a hurry, sir,\" he said,\nrecovering his coolness. \"If it suits you to restore to me those small\narticles of mine, I shall be glad; but I would rather leave them behind\nthan be detained.\" He had reflected that the minister was simply a\npunctilious old bore. The question meant nothing else. But Mr. Lyon had\nwrought himself up to the task of finding out, then and there, if\npossible, whether or not this were Annette's husband. How could he lay\nhimself and his sin before God if he wilfully declined to learn the\ntruth? \"Nay, sir, I will not detain you unreasonably,\" he said, in a\nfirmer tone than before. \"How long have these articles been your\nproperty?\"\n\n\"Oh, for more than twenty years,\" said Christian, carelessly.\n\nHe was not altogether easy under the minister's persistence, but for\nthat very reason he showed no more impatience.\n\n\"You have been in France and in Germany?\"\n\n\"I have been in most countries on the continent.\"\n\n\"Be so good as to write me your name,\" said Mr. Lyon, dipping a pen in\nink, and holding it out with a piece of paper.\n\nChristian was much surprised, but not now greatly alarmed. In his rapid\nconjectures as to the explanation of the minister's curiosity, he had\nalighted on one which might carry advantage rather than inconvenience.\nBut he was not going to commit himself.\n\n\"Before I oblige you there, sir,\" he said, laying down the pen, and\nlooking straight at Mr. Lyon, \"I must know exactly the reasons you have\nfor putting these questions to me. You are a stranger to me--an\nexcellent person, I dare say--but I have no concern about you farther\nthan to get from you those small articles. Do you still doubt that they\nare mine? You wished, I think, that I should tell you what the locket is\nlike. It has a pair of hands and blue flowers on one side and the name\nAnnette round the hair on the other side. That is all I have to say. If\nyou wish for anything more from me, you will be good enough to tell me\nwhy you wish it. Now then, sir, what is your concern with me?\"\n\nThe cool stare, the hard challenging voice, with which these words were\nuttered, made them fall like the beating cutting chill of heavy hail on\nMr. Lyon. He sank back in his chair in utter irresolution and\nhelplessness. How was it possible to lay bare the sad and sacred past in\nanswer to such a call as this? The dread with which he had thought of\nthis man's coming, the strongly-confirmed suspicion that he was really\nAnnette's husband, intensified the antipathy created by his gestures and\nglances. The sensitive little minister knew instinctively that words\nwhich would cost him efforts as painful as the obedient footsteps of a\nwounded bleeding hound that wills a foreseen throe, would fall on this\nman as the pressure of tender fingers falls on a brazen glove. And\nEsther--if this man was her father, every additional word might help to\nbring down irrevocable, perhaps cruel consequences on her. A thick mist\nseemed to have fallen where Mr. Lyon was looking for the track of duty:\nthe difficult question, how far he was to care for consequences in\nseeking and avowing the truth, seemed anew obscured. All these things,\nlike the vision of a coming calamity, were compressed into a moment of\nconsciousness. Nothing could be done to-day; everything must be\ndeferred. He answered Christian in a low apologetic tone.\n\n\"It is true, sir; you have told me all I can demand. I have no\nsufficient reason for detaining your property further.\"\n\nHe handed the note-book and chain to Christian, who had been observing\nhim narrowly, and now said, in a tone of indifference, as he pocketed\nthe articles--\n\n\"Very good, sir. I wish you a good-morning.\"\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said Mr. Lyon, feeling, while the door closed behind his\nguest, that mixture of uneasiness and relief which all procrastination\nof difficulty produces in minds capable of strong forecast. The work\nwas still to be done. He had still before him the task of learning\neverything that could be learned about this man's relation to himself\nand Esther.\n\nChristian, as he made his way back along Malthouse Lane, was thinking,\n\"This old fellow has got some secret in his head. It's not likely he can\nknow anything about me: it must be about Bycliffe. But Bycliffe was a\ngentleman: how should he ever have had anything to do with such a seedy\nold ranter as that?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n    And doubt shall be as lead upon the feet\n    Of thy most anxious will.\n\n\nMr. Lyon was careful to look in at Felix as soon as possible after\nChristian's departure, to tell him that his trust was discharged. During\nthe rest of the day he was somewhat relieved from agitating reflections\nby the necessity of attending to his ministerial duties, the rebuke of\nrebellious singers being one of them; and on his return from the Monday\nevening prayer-meeting he was so overcome with weariness that he went to\nbed without taking note of any objects in his study. But when he rose\nthe next morning, his mind, once more eagerly active, was arrested by\nPhilip Debarry's letter, which still lay open on his desk, and was\narrested by precisely that portion which had been unheeded the day\nbefore:--\"_I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you\ncan point out to me some method by which I may procure you as lively a\nsatisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy relief from\nanxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct_.\"\n\nTo understand how these words could carry the suggestion they actually\nhad for the minister in a crisis of peculiar personal anxiety and\nstruggle, we must bear in mind that for many years he had walked through\nlife with the sense of having for a space been unfaithful to what he\nesteemed the highest trust ever committed to man--the ministerial\nvocation. In a mind of any nobleness, a lapse into transgression against\nan object still regarded as supreme, issues in a new and purer\ndevotedness, chastised by humility and watched over by a passionate\nregret. So it was with that ardent spirit which animated the little body\nof Rufus Lyon. Once in his life he had been blinded, defeated, hurried\nalong by rebellious impulse; he had gone astray after his own desires,\nand had let the fire die out on the altar; and as the true penitent,\nhating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead\nof joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the\nwatch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a\ngreat public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command.\n\nNow here was an opportunity brought by a combination of that unexpected\nincalculable kind which might be regarded as the Divine emphasis\ninvoking especial attention to trivial events--an opportunity of\nsecuring what Rufus Lyon had often wished for as a means of honoring\ntruth, and exhibiting error in the character of a stammering, halting,\nshort-breathed usurper of office and dignity. What was more exasperating\nto a zealous preacher, with whom copious speech was not a difficulty but\na relief--who never lacked argument, but only combatants and\nlisteners--than to reflect that there were thousands on thousands of\npulpits in this kingdom, supplied with handsome sounding-boards, and\noccupying an advantageous position in buildings far larger than the\nchapel in Malthouse Yard--buildings sure to be places of resort, even as\nthe markets were, if only from habit and interest; and that these\npulpits were filled, or rather made vacuous, by men whose privileged\neducation in the ancient centres of instruction issued in twenty\nminutes' formal reading of tepid exhortation or probably infirm\ndeductions from premises based on rotten scaffolding? And it is in the\nnature of exasperation gradually to concentrate itself. The sincere\nantipathy of a dog toward cats in general, necessarily takes the form of\nindignant barking at the neighbor's black cat which makes daily\ntrespass; the bark at imagined cats, though a frequent exercise of the\ncanine mind, is yet comparatively feeble. Mr. Lyon's sarcasm was not\nwithout an edge when he dilated in general on an elaborate education for\nteachers which issued in the minimum of teaching, but it found a\nwhetstone in the particular example of that bad system known as the\nrector of Treby Magna. There was nothing positive to be said against the\nRev. Augustus Debarry; his life could not be pronounced blameworthy\nexcept for its negatives. And the good Rufus was too pure-minded not to\nbe glad of that. He had no delight in vice as discrediting wicked\nopponents; he shrank from dwelling on the images of cruelty or\ngrossness, and his indignation was habitually inspired only by those\nmoral and intellectual mistakes which darken the soul but do not injure\nor degrade the temple of the body. If the rector had been a less\nrespectable man, Rufus would have more reluctantly made him an object\nof antagonism; but as an incarnation of soul-destroying error,\ndissociated from those baser sins which have no good repute even with\nthe worldly, it would be an argumentative luxury to get into close\nquarters with him, and fight with a dialectic short-sword in the eyes of\nthe Treby world (sending also a written account thereof to the chief\norgans of Dissenting opinion). Vice was essentially stupid--a deaf and\neyeless monster, insusceptible to demonstration: the Spirit might work\non it by unseen ways, and the unstudied sallies of sermons were often as\nthe arrows which pierced and awakened the brutified conscience; but\nilluminated thought, finely divided speech, were the choicer weapons of\nthe Divine armory, which whoso could wield must be careful not to leave\nidle.\n\nHere, then, was the longed-for opportunity. Here was an engagement--an\nexpression of a strong wish--on the part of Philip Debarry, if it were\nin his power, to procure a satisfaction to Rufus Lyon. How had that man\nof God and exemplary Independent minister, Mr. Ainsworth, of persecuted\nsanctity, conducted himself when a similar occasion had befallen him at\nAmsterdam? He had thought of nothing but the glory of the highest cause,\nand had converted the offer of recompense into a public debate with a\nJew on the chief mysteries of the faith. Here was a model: the case was\nnothing short of a heavenly indication, and he, Rufus Lyon, would seize\nthe occasion to demand a public debate with the rector on the\nconstitution of the true Church.\n\nWhat if he were inwardly torn by doubt and anxiety concerning his own\nprivate relations and the facts of his past life? That danger of\nabsorption within the narrow bounds of self only urged him the more\ntoward action which had a wider bearing, and might tell on the welfare\nof England at large. It was decided. Before the minister went down to\nbreakfast that morning he had written the following letter to Mr. Philip\nDebarry:--\n\n    SIR,--Referring to your letter of yesterday, I find the following\n    words: \"I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you\n    can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as\n    lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy\n    relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct.\"\n\n    I am not unaware, sir, that, in the usage of the world, there are\n    words of courtesy (so called) which are understood, by those\n    amongst whom they are current, to have no precise meaning, and to\n    constitute no bond of obligation. I will not now insist that this\n    is an abuse of language, wherein our fallible nature requires the\n    strictest safeguards against laxity and misapplication, for I do\n    not apprehend that in writing the words I have above quoted, you\n    were open to the reproach of using phrases which, while seeming to\n    carry a specific meaning, were really no more than what is called a\n    polite form. I believe, sir, that you used these words advisedly,\n    sincerely, and with an honorable intention of acting on them as a\n    pledge, should such action be demanded. No other supposition on my\n    part would correspond to the character you bear as a young man who\n    aspires (albeit mistakenly) to engraft the finest fruits of public\n    virtue on a creed and institutions, whereof the sap is composed\n    rather of human self-seeking than of everlasting truth.\n\n    Wherefore I act on this my belief in the integrity of your written\n    word; I beg you to procure for me (as it is doubtless in your\n    power) that I may be allowed a public discussion with your near\n    relative, the rector of this parish, the Reverend Augustus Debarry,\n    to be held in the large room of the Free School, or in the Assembly\n    Room of the Marquis of Granby, these being the largest covered\n    spaces at our command. For I presume he would neither allow me to\n    speak within his church, nor would consent himself to speak within\n    my chapel; and the probable inclemency of the approaching season\n    forbids an assured expectation that we could discourse in the open\n    air. The subjects I desire to discuss are--first, the Constitution\n    of the true Church; and secondly, the bearing thereupon of the\n    English Reformation. Confidently expecting that you will comply\n    with this request, which is the sequence of your expressed desire,\n    I remain, sir, yours, with the respect offered to a sincere\n    withstander,\n                                                     RUFUS LYON,\n    Malthouse Yard.\n\nAfter writing this letter, the good Rufus felt that serenity and\nelevation of mind which is infallibly brought by a preoccupation with\nthe wider relations of things. Already he was beginning to sketch the\ncourse his argument might most judiciously take in the coming debate;\nhis thoughts were running into sentences, and marking off careful\nexceptions in parentheses; and he had come down and seated himself at\nthe breakfast-table quite automatically, without expectation of toast or\ncoffee, when Esther's voice and touch recalled to him an inward debate\nof another kind, in which he felt himself much weaker. Again there arose\nbefore him the image of that cool, hard-eyed, worldly man, who might be\nthis dear child's father, and one against whose rights he had himself\ngrievously offended. Always as the image recurred to him Mr. Lyon's\nheart sent forth a prayer for guidance, but no definite guidance had yet\nmade itself visible for him. It could not be guidance--it was a\ntemptation--that said, \"Let the matter rest: seek to know no more; know\nonly what is thrust upon you.\" The remembrance that in his time of\nwandering he had wilfully remained in ignorance of facts which he might\nhave enquired after, deepened the impression that it was now an\nimperative duty to seek the fullest attainable knowledge. And the\nenquiry might possibly issue in a blessed repose, by putting a negative\non all his suspicions. But the more vividly all the circumstances became\npresent to him, the more unfit he felt himself to set about any\ninvestigation concerning this man who called himself Maurice Christian.\nHe could seek no confidant or helper among \"the brethren\"; he was\nobliged to admit to himself that the members of his church, with whom he\nhoped to go to heaven, were not easy to converse with on earth touching\nthe deeper secrets of his experience, and were still less able to advise\nhim as to the wisest procedure in a case of high delicacy, with a\nworldling who had a carefully-trimmed whisker and a fashionable costume.\nFor the first time in his life it occurred to the minister that he\nshould be glad of an adviser who had more worldly than spiritual\nexperience, and that it might not be inconsistent with his principles to\nseek some light from one who had studied human law. But it was a thought\nto be paused upon, and not followed out rashly; some other guidance\nmight intervene.\n\nEsther noticed that her father was in a fit of abstraction, that he\nseemed to swallow his coffee and toast quite unconsciously, and that he\nvented from time to time a low guttural interjection, which was habitual\nwith him when he was absorbed by an inward discussion. She did not\ndisturb him by remarks, and only wondered whether anything unusual had\noccurred on Sunday evening. But at last she thought it needful to say,\n\"You recollect what I told you yesterday, father?\"\n\n\"Nay, child; what?\" said Mr. Lyon, rousing himself.\n\n\"That Mr. Jermyn asked me if you would probably be at home this morning\nbefore one o'clock.\"\n\nEsther was surprised to see her father start and change color as if he\nhad been shaken by some sudden collision before he answered--\n\n\"Assuredly; I do not intend to move from my study after I have once been\nout to hand this letter to Zachary.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell Lyddy to take him up at once to your study if he comes? If\nnot, I shall have to stay in my own room, because I shall be at home all\nthis morning, and it is rather cold now to sit without a fire.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, let him come up to me; unless, indeed, he should bring a\nsecond person, which might happen, seeing that in all likelihood he is\ncoming, as hitherto, on electioneering business. And I could not well\naccommodate two visitors up-stairs.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Lyon went out to Zachary, the pew-opener, to give him a second\ntime the commission of carrying a letter to Treby Manor, Esther gave her\ninjunction to Lyddy that if one gentleman came he was to be shown\nup-stairs--if two, they were to be shown into the parlor. But she had to\nresolve several questions before Lyddy clearly saw what was before\nher--as that, \"if it was the gentleman as came on Thursday in the\npepper-and-salt coat, was he to be shown up-stairs? And the gentleman\nfrom the Manor yesterday as went out whistling--had Miss Esther heard\nabout him? There seemed no end of these great folks coming to Malthouse\nYard since there was talk of the election; but they might be poor lost\ncreatures the most of 'em.\" Whereupon Lyddy shook her head and groaned,\nunder an edifying despair as to the future lot of gentlemen callers.\n\nEsther always avoided asking questions of Lyddy, who found an answer as\nshe found a key, by pouring out a pocketful of miscellanies. But she had\nremarked so many indications that something had happened to cause her\nfather unusual excitement and mental preoccupation, that she could not\nhelp connecting with them the fact of this visit from the Manor, which\nhe had not mentioned to her.\n\nShe sat down in the dull parlor and took up her netting; for since\nSunday she had felt unable to read when she was alone, being obliged, in\nspite of herself, to think of Felix Holt--to imagine what he would like\nher to be, and what sort of views he took of life so as to make it seem\nvaluable in the absence of all elegance, luxury, gayety, or romance. Had\nhe yet reflected that he had behaved very rudely to her on Sunday?\nPerhaps not. Perhaps he had dismissed her from his mind with contempt.\nAnd at that thought Esther's eyes smarted unpleasantly. She was fond of\nnetting, because it showed to advantage both her hand and her foot; and\nacross this image of Felix Holt's indifference and contempt there passed\nthe vaguer image of a possible somebody who would admire her hands and\nfeet, and delight in looking at their beauty, and long, yet not dare, to\nkiss them. Life would be much easier in the presence of such a love. But\nit was precisely this longing after her own satisfaction that Felix had\nreproached her with. Did he want her to be heroic? That seemed\nimpossible without some great occasion. Her life was a heap of\nfragments, and so were her thoughts: some great energy was needed to\nbind them together. Esther was beginning to lose her complacency at her\nown wit and criticism; to lose the sense of superiority in an awakening\nneed of reliance on one whose vision was wider, whose nature was purer\nand stronger than her own. But then, she said to herself, that \"one\"\nmust be tender to her, not rude and predominating in his manners. A man\nwith any chivalry in him could never adopt a scolding tone toward a\nwoman--that is, toward a charming woman. But Felix had no chivalry in\nhim. He loved lecturing and opinion too well ever to love any woman.\n\nIn this way Esther strove to see that Felix was thoroughly in the\nwrong--at least, if he did not come again expressly to show that he was\nsorry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n    _Trueblue._ These men have no votes. Why should I court them?\n\n    _Grayfox._ No votes, but power.\n\n    _Trueblue._ What! over charities?\n\n    _Grayfox._ No, over brains: which disturbs the canvass. In a\n    natural state of things the average price of a vote at Paddlebrook\n    is nine-and-sixpence, throwing the fifty pound tenants, who cost\n    nothing, into the divisor. But these talking men cause an\n    artificial rise of prices.\n\n\nThe expected important knock at the door came about twelve o'clock, and\nEsther could hear that there were two visitors. Immediately the parlor\ndoor was opened and the shaggy-haired, cravatless image of Felix Holt,\nwhich was just then full in the mirror of Esther's mind, was displaced\nby the highly-contrasted appearance of a personage whose name she\nguessed before Mr. Jermyn had announced it. The perfect morning costume\nof that day differed much from our present ideal: it was essential that\na gentleman's chin should be well propped, that his collar should have a\nvoluminous roll, that his waistcoat should imply much discrimination,\nand that his buttons should be arranged in a manner which would now\nexpose him to general contempt. And it must not be forgotten that at the\ndistant period when Treby Magna first knew the excitements of an\nelection, there existed many other anomalies now obsolete, besides\nshort-waisted coats and broad stiffeners.\n\nBut we have some notions of beauty and fitness which withstand the\ncenturies; and quite irrespective of dates, it would be pronounced that\nat the age of thirty-four Harold Transome was a striking and handsome\nman. He was one of those people, as Denner remarked, to whose presence\nin the room you could not be indifferent; if you do not hate or dread\nthem, you must find the touch of their hands, nay, their very shadows,\nagreeable.\n\nEsther felt a pleasure quite new to her as she saw his finely-embrowned\nface and full bright eyes turned toward her with an air of deference by\nwhich gallantry must commend itself to a refined woman who is not\nabsolutely free from vanity. Harold Transome regarded women as slight\nthings, but he was fond of slight things in the intervals of business;\nand he held it among the chief arts of life to keep these pleasant\ndiversions within such bounds that they should never interfere with the\ncourse of his serious ambition. Esther was perfectly aware, as he took a\nchair near her, that he was under some admiring surprise at her\nappearance and manner. How could it be otherwise? She believed that in\nthe eyes of a well-bred man no young lady in Treby could equal her: she\nfelt a glow of delight at the sense that she was being looked at.\n\n\"My father expected you,\" she said to Mr. Jermyn. \"I delivered your\nletter to him yesterday. He will be down immediately.\"\n\nShe disentangled her foot from her netting and wound it up.\n\n\"I hope you are not going to let us disturb you,\" said Harold, noticing\nher action. \"We come to discuss election affairs, and we particularly\ndesire to interest the ladies.\"\n\n\"I have no interest with any one who is not already on the right side,\"\nsaid Esther smiling.\n\n\"I am happy to see at least that you wear the Liberal colors.\"\n\n\"I fear I must confess that it is more from love of blue than from love\nof Liberalism. Yellow opinions could only have brunettes on their side.\"\nEsther spoke with her usual pretty fluency, but she had no sooner\nuttered the words than she thought how angry they would have made Felix.\n\n\"If my cause is to be recommended by the becomingness of my colors, then\nI am sure you are acting in my interest by wearing them.\"\n\nEsther rose to leave the room.\n\n\"Must you really go?\" said Harold, preparing to open the door for her.\n\n\"Yes, I have an engagement--a lesson at half past twelve,\" said Esther,\nbowing and floating out like a blue-robed Na\u00c3\u00afad, but not without a\nsuffused blush as she passed through the doorway.\n\nIt was a pity the room was so small, Harold Transome thought: this girl\nought to walk in a house where there were halls and corridors. But he\nhad soon dismissed this chance preoccupation with Esther; for before the\ndoor was closed again Mr. Lyon had entered, and Harold was entirely bent\non what had been the object of his visit. The minister, though no\nelector himself, had considerable influence over Liberal electors, and\nit was the part of wisdom in a candidate to cement all political\nadhesion by a little personal regard, if possible. Garstin was a harsh\nand wiry fellow; he seemed to suggest that sour whey, which some say was\nthe original meaning of Whig in the Scottish, and it might suggest the\ntheoretic advantages of Radicalism if it could be associated with a more\ngenerous presence. What would conciliate the personal regard of old Mr.\nLyon became a curious problem to Harold, now the little man made his\nappearance. But canvassing makes a gentleman acquainted with many\nstrange animals; together with the ways of catching and taming them; and\nthus the knowledge of natural history advances amongst the aristocracy\nand wealthy commoners of our land.\n\n\"I am very glad to have secured this opportunity of making your personal\nacquaintance, Mr. Lyon,\" said Harold, putting out his hand to the\nminister when Jermyn had mentioned his name. \"I am to address the\nelectors here, in the Market-Place, to-morrow; and I should have been\nsorry to do so without first paying my respects privately to my chief\nfriends, as there may be points on which they particularly wish me to\nexplain myself.\"\n\n\"You speak civilly, sir, and reasonably,\" said Mr. Lyon, with a vague\nshort-sighted gaze, in which a candidate's appearance evidently went for\nnothing. \"Pray be seated, gentlemen. It is my habit to stand.\"\n\nHe placed himself at a right angle with his visitors, his worn look of\nintellectual eagerness, slight frame, and rusty attire, making an odd\ncontrast with their flourishing persons, unblemished costume, and\ncomfortable freedom from excitement. The group was fairly typical of the\ndifference between the men who are animated by ideas and the men who are\nexpected to apply them. Then he drew forth his spectacles, and began to\nrub them with the thin end of his coat tail. He was inwardly exercising\ngreat self-mastery--suppressing the thought of his personal needs, which\nJermyn's presence tended to suggest, in order that he might be equal to\nthe larger duties of this occasion.\n\n\"I am aware--Mr. Jermyn has told me,\" said Harold, \"what good service\nyou have done me already, Mr. Lyon. The fact is, a man of intellect like\nyou was especially needed in my case. The race I am running is really\nagainst Garstin only, who calls himself a Liberal, though he cares for\nnothing, and understands nothing, except the interests of the wealthy\ntraders. And you have been able to explain the difference between\nLiberal and Liberal, which, as you and I know, is something like the\ndifference between fish and fish.\"\n\n\"Your comparison is not unapt, sir,\" said Mr. Lyon, still holding his\nspectacles in his hand, \"at this epoch, when the mind of the nation has\nbeen strained on the passing of one measure. Where a great weight has to\nbe moved, we require not so much selected instruments as abundant\nhorse-power. But it is an unavoidable evil of these massive achievements\nthat they encourage a coarse undiscriminatingness obstructive of more\nnicely-wrought results, and an exaggerated expectation inconsistent with\nthe intricacies of our fallen and struggling condition. I say not that\ncompromise is unnecessary, but it is an evil attendant on our\nimperfection; and I would pray every one to mark that, where compromise\nbroadens, intellect and conscience are thrust into narrower room.\nWherefore it has been my object to show our people that there are many\nwho have helped to draw the car of Reform, whose ends are but partial,\nand who forsake not the ungodly principle of selfish alliances, but\nwould only substitute Syria for Egypt--thinking chiefly of their own\nshare in peacocks, gold and ivory.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Harold, who was quick at new languages, and still\nquicker at translating other men's generalities into his own special and\nimmediate purposes, \"men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in\na plutocracy, buy up the land, and stick the old crests on their new\ngateways. Now the practical point to secure against these false Liberals\nat present is, that our electors should not divide their votes. As it\nappears that many who vote for Debarry are likely to split their votes\nin favor of Garstin, it is of the first consequence that my voters\nshould give me plumpers. If they divide their votes they can't keep out\nDebarry, and they may help to keep out me. I feel some confidence in\nasking you to use your influence in this direction, Mr. Lyon. We\ncandidates have to praise ourselves more than is graceful; but you are\naware that, while I belong by my birth to the classes that have their\nroots in tradition and all the old loyalties, my experience has lain\nchiefly among those who make their own career, and depend on the new\nrather than the old. I have had the advantage of considering the\nnational welfare under varied lights: I have wider views than those of a\nmere cotton lord. On questions connected with religious liberty I would\nstop short at no measure that was not thorough.\"\n\n\"I hope not, sir--I hope not,\" said Mr. Lyon, gravely; finally putting\non his spectacles and examining the face of the candidate, whom he was\npreparing to turn into a catechumen. For the good Rufus, conscious of\nhis political importance as an organ of persuasion, felt it his duty to\ncatechise a little, and also to do his part toward impressing a probable\nlegislator with a sense of his responsibility. But the latter branch of\nduty somewhat obstructed the catechising, for his mind was so urged by\nconsiderations which he held in danger of being overlooked, that the\nquestions and answers bore a very slender proportion to his exposition.\nIt was impossible to leave the question of church-rates without noting\nthe grounds of their injustice, and without a brief enumeration of\nreasons why Mr. Lyon, for his own part, would not present that passive\nresistance to a legal imposition which had been adopted by the Friends\n(whose heroism in this regard was nevertheless worthy of all honor).\n\nComprehensive talkers are apt to be tiresome when we are not athirst for\ninformation, but, to be quite fair, we must admit that superior\nreticence is a good deal due to the lack of matter. Speech is often\nbarren; but silence also does not necessarily brood over a full nest.\nYour still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all the while be\nsitting on one addled nest-egg; and when it takes to cackling, will have\nnothing to announce but that addled delusion.\n\nHarold Transome was not at all a patient man, but in matters of business\nhe was quite awake to his cue, and in this case it was perhaps easier to\nlisten than to answer questions. But Jermyn, who had plenty of work on\nhis hands, took an opportunity of rising, and saying, as he looked at\nhis watch--\n\n\"I must really be at the office in five minutes. You will find me there,\nMr. Transome; you have probably still many things to say to Mr. Lyon.\"\n\n\"I beseech you, sir,\" said the minister, changing color, and by a quick\nmovement laying his hand on Jermyn's arm--\"I beseech you to favor me\nwith an interview on some private business--this evening, if it were\npossible.\"\n\nMr. Lyon, like others who are habitually occupied with impersonal\nsubjects, was liable to this impulsive sort of action. He snatched at\nthe details of life as if they were darting past him--as if they were\nlike the ribbons at his knees, which would never be tied all day if they\nwere not tied on the instant. Through these spasmodic leaps out of his\nabstractions into real life, it constantly happened that he suddenly\ntook a course which had been the subject of too much doubt with him ever\nto have been determined on by continuous thought. And if Jermyn had not\nstartled him by threatening to vanish just when he was plunged in\npolitics, he might never have made up his mind to confide in a worldly\nattorney.\n\n(\"An odd man,\" as Mrs. Muscat observed, \"to have such a gift in the\npulpit. But there's One knows better than we do----\" which, in a lady\nwho rarely felt her judgment at a loss, was a concession that showed\nmuch piety.)\n\nJermyn was surprised at the little man's eagerness. \"By all means,\" he\nanswered, quite cordially. \"Could you come to my office at eight\no'clock?\"\n\n\"For several reasons, I must beg you to come to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, very good. I'll walk out and see you this evening, if possible. I\nshall have much pleasure in being of any use to you.\" Jermyn felt that\nin the eyes of Harold he was appearing all the more valuable when his\nservices were thus in request. He went out, and Mr. Lyon easily relapsed\ninto politics, for he had been on the brink of a favorite subject on\nwhich he was at issue with his fellow-Liberals.\n\nAt that time, when faith in the efficacy of political change was at\nfever-heat in ardent Reformers, many measures which men are still\ndiscussing with little confidence on either side, were then talked about\nand disposed of like property in near reversion. Crying abuses--\"bloated\npaupers,\" \"bloated pluralists,\" and other corruptions hindering men from\nbeing wise and happy--had to be fought against and slain. Such a time is\na time of hope. Afterward when the corpses of those monsters have been\nheld up to the public wonder and abhorrence, and yet wisdom and\nhappiness do not follow, but rather a more abundant breeding of the\nfoolish and unhappy, comes a time of doubt and despondency. But in the\ngreat Reform-year Hope was mighty: the prospect of Reform had even\nserved the voters instead of drink; and in one place, at least, there\nhad been \"a dry election.\" And now the speakers at Reform banquets were\nexuberant in congratulation and promise: Liberal clergymen of the\nEstablishment toasted Liberal Catholic clergymen without any allusion to\nscarlet, and Catholic clergymen replied with a like tender reserve.\nSome dwelt on the abolition of all abuses, and on millennial blessedness\ngenerally; others, whose imaginations were less suffused with\nexhalations of the dawn insisted chiefly on the ballot-box.\n\nNow on this question of the ballot the minister strongly took the\nnegative side. Our pet opinions are usually those which place us in a\nminority of a minority amongst our own party:--very happily, else those\npoor opinions, born with no silver spoon in their mouths--how would they\nget nourished and fed? So it was with Mr. Lyon and his objection to the\nballot. But he had thrown out a remark on the subject which was not\nquite clear to his hearer, who interpreted it according to his best\ncalculation of probabilities.\n\n\"I have no objection to the ballot,\" said Harold, \"but I think that is\nnot the sort of thing we have to work at just now. We shouldn't get it.\nAnd other questions are imminent.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you would vote for the ballot?\" said Mr. Lyon, stroking his\nchin.\n\n\"Certainly, if the point came up. I have too much respect for the\nfreedom of the voter to oppose anything which offers a chance of making\nthat freedom more complete.\"\n\nMr. Lyon looked at the speaker with a pitying smile and a subdued\n\"h'm--m--m,\" which Harold took for a sign of satisfaction. He was soon\nundeceived.\n\n\"You grieve me, sir; you grieve me much. And I pray you to reconsider\nthis question, for it will take you to the root, as I think, of\npolitical morality. I engage to show to any impartial mind, duly\nfurnished with the principles of public and private rectitude, that the\nballot would be pernicious, and that if it were not pernicious, it would\nstill be futile. I will show, first, that it would be futile as a\npreservative from bribery and illegitimate influence; and, secondly,\nthat it would be in the worst kind pernicious, as shutting the door\nagainst those influences whereby the soul of a man and the character of\na citizen are duly educated for their great functions. Be not alarmed if\nI detain you, sir. It is well worth the while.\"\n\n\"Confound this old man,\" thought Harold. \"I'll never make a canvassing\ncall on a preacher again, unless he has lost his voice from a cold.\" He\nwas going to excuse himself as prudently as he could, by deferring the\nsubject till the morrow, and inviting Mr. Lyon to come to him in the\ncommittee-room before the time appointed for his public speech; but he\nwas relieved by the opening of the door, Lyddy put in her head to say--\n\n\"If you please, sir, here's Mr. Holt wants to know if he may come in and\nspeak to the gentleman. He begs your pardon, but you're to say 'no' if\nyou don't like him to come.\"\n\n\"Nay, show him in at once, Lyddy. A young man,\" Mr. Lyon went on,\nspeaking to Harold, \"whom a representative ought to know--no voter, but\na man of ideas and study.\"\n\n\"He is thoroughly welcome,\" said Harold, truthfully enough, though he\nfelt little interest in the voteless man of ideas except as a diversion\nfrom the subject of the ballot. He had been standing for the last minute\nor two, feeling less of a victim in that attitude, and more able to\ncalculate on means of escape.\n\n\"Mr. Holt, sir,\" said the minister, as Felix entered, \"is a young friend\nof mine, whose opinions on some points I hope to see altered, but who\nhas a zeal for public justice which I trust he will never lose.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see Mr. Holt,\" said Harold, bowing. He perceived from the\nway in which Felix bowed to him and turned to the most distant spot in\nthe room, that the candidate's shake of the hand would not be welcome\nhere. \"A formidable fellow,\" he thought, \"capable of mounting a cart in\nthe market-place to-morrow and cross-examining me, if I say anything\nthat doesn't please him.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lyon,\" said Felix, \"I have taken a liberty with you in asking to\nsee Mr. Transome when he is engaged with you. But I have to speak to him\non a matter which I shouldn't care to make public at present, and it is\none on which I am sure you will back me. I heard that Mr. Transome was\nhere, so I ventured to come. I hope you will both excuse me, as my\nbusiness refers to some electioneering measures which are being taken by\nMr. Transome's agents.\"\n\n\"Pray go on,\" said Harold, expecting something unpleasant.\n\n\"I'm not going to speak against treating voters,\" said Felix; \"I suppose\nbuttered ale, and grease of that sort to make the wheels go, belong to\nthe necessary humbug of representation. But I wish to ask you, Mr.\nTransome, whether it is with your knowledge that agents of yours are\nbribing rough fellows who are no voters--the colliers and navvies at\nSproxton--with the chance of extra drunkenness, that they may make a\nposse on your side at the nomination and polling?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Harold. \"You are aware, my dear sir, that a\ncandidate is very much at the mercy of his agents as to the means by\nwhich he is returned, especially when many years' absence has made him a\nstranger to the men actually conducting business. But are you sure of\nyour facts?\"\n\n\"As sure as my senses can make me,\" said Felix, who then briefly\ndescribed what had happened on Sunday. \"I believed that you were\nignorant of all this, Mr. Transome,\" he ended, \"and that was why I\nthought some good might be done by speaking to you. If not, I should be\ntempted to expose the whole affair as a disgrace to the Radical party.\nI'm a Radical myself, and mean to work all my life long against\nprivilege, monopoly, and oppression. But I would rather be a\nlivery-servant proud of my master's title, than I would seem to make\ncommon cause with scoundrels who turn the best hopes of men into\nby-words for cant and dishonesty.\"\n\n\"Your energetic protest is needless here, sir,\" said Harold, offended at\nwhat sounded like a threat, and was certainly premature enough to be in\nbad taste. In fact, this error of behavior in Felix proceeded from a\nrepulsion which was mutual. It was a constant source of irritation to\nhim that the public men on his side were, on the whole, not\nconspicuously better than the public men on the other side; that the\nspirit of innovation, which with him was a part of religion, was in many\nof its mouthpieces no more of a religion than the faith in rotten\nboroughs; and he was thus predisposed to distrust Harold Transome.\nHarold, in his turn, disliked impracticable notions of loftiness and\npurity--disliked all enthusiasm; and he thought he saw a very\ntroublesome, vigorous incorporation of that nonsense in Felix. But it\nwould be foolish to exasperate him in any way.\n\n\"If you choose to accompany me to Jermyn's office,\" he went on, \"the\nmatter shall be enquired into in your presence. I think you will agree\nwith me, Mr. Lyon, that this will be the most satisfactory course.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said the minister, who liked the candidate very well, and\nbelieved that he would be amenable to argument; \"and I would caution my\nyoung friend against a too great hastiness of words and action. David's\ncause against Saul was a righteous one; nevertheless not all who clave\nunto David were righteous men.\"\n\n\"The more was the pity, sir,\" said Felix. \"Especially if he winked at\ntheir malpractices.\"\n\nMr. Lyon smiled, shook his head, and stroked his favorite's arm\ndeprecatingly.\n\n\"It is rather too much for any man to keep the consciences of all his\nparty,\" said Harold. \"If you had lived in the East, as I have, you would\nbe more tolerant, for example, of an active industrious selfishness,\nsuch as we have here, though it may not always be quite scrupulous: you\nwould see how much better it is than an idle selfishness. I have heard\nit said, a bridge is a good thing--worth helping to make, though half\nthe men who worked at it were rogues.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Felix, scornfully, \"give me a handful of generalities\nand analogies, and I'll undertake to justify Burke and Hare, and prove\nthem benefactors of their species. I'll tolerate no nuisances but such\nas I can't help; and the question now is, not whether we can do away\nwith all the nuisances in the world, but with a particular nuisance\nunder our noses.\"\n\n\"Then we had better cut the matter short, as I propose, by going at once\nto Jermyn's,\" said Harold. \"In that case, I must bid you good-morning,\nMr. Lyon.\"\n\n\"I would fain,\" said the minister, looking uneasy--\"I would fain have\nhad a further opportunity of considering that question of the ballot\nwith you. The reasons against it need not be urged lengthily; they only\nrequire complete enumeration to prevent any seeming hiatus, where an\nopposing fallacy might trust itself in.\"\n\n\"Never fear, sir,\" said Harold, shaking Mr. Lyon's hand cordially,\n\"there will be opportunities. Shall I not see you in the committee-room\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Mr. Lyon, rubbing his brow, with a sad remembrance\nof his personal anxieties. \"But I will send you, if you will permit me,\na brief writing, on which you can meditate at your leisure.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted. Good-bye.\"\n\nHarold and Felix went out together; and the minister, going up to his\ndull study, asked himself whether, under the pressure of conflicting\nexperience, he had faithfully discharged the duties of the past\ninterview?\n\nIf a cynical sprite were present, riding on one of the motes in that\ndusty room, he may have made himself merry at the illusions of the\nlittle minister who brought so much conscience to-bear on the production\nof so slight an effect. I confess to smiling myself, being sceptical as\nto the effect of ardent appeals and nice distinctions on gentlemen who\nare got up, both inside and out, as candidates in the style of the\nperiod; but I never smiled at Mr. Lyon's trustful energy without falling\nto penitence and veneration immediately after. For what we call\nillusions are often, in truth, a wider vision of past and recent\nrealities--a willing movement of a man's soul with the larger sweep of\nthe world's forces--a movement toward a more assured end than the\nchances of a single life. We see human heroism broken into units and\nsay, this unit did little--might as well not have been. But in this way\nwe might break up a great army into units; in this way we might break\nthe sunlight into fragments, and think that this and the other might be\ncheaply parted with. Let us rather raise a monument to the soldiers\nwhose brave hearts only kept the ranks unbroken and met death--a\nmonument to the faithful who were not famous, and who are precious as\nthe continuity of the sunbeams is precious, though some of them fall\nunseen and on barrenness.\n\nAt present, looking back on that day at Treby, it seem to me that the\nsadder illusion lay with Harold Transome, who was trusting in his own\nskill to shape the success of his own morrows, ignorant of what many\nyesterdays had determined for him beforehand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n    It is a good and soothfast saw;\n    Half-roasted never will be raw;\n    No dough is dried once more to meal,\n    No crock new-shapen by the wheel;\n    You can't turn curds to milk again,\n    Nor Now, by wishing, back to Then;\n    And having tasted stolen honey,\n    You can't buy innocence for money.\n\n\nJermyn was not particularly pleased that some chance had apparently\nhindered Harold Transome from making other canvassing visits immediately\nafter leaving Mr. Lyon, and so had sent him back to the office earlier\nthan he had been expected to come. The inconvenient chance he guessed at\nonce to be represented by Felix Holt, whom he knew very well by Trebian\nreport to be a young man with so little of the ordinary Christian\nmotives as to making an appearance and getting on in the world, that he\npresented no handle to any judicious and respectable person who might be\nwilling to make use of him.\n\nHarold Transome, on his side, was a great deal annoyed at being worried\nby Felix in an enquiry about electioneering details. The real dignity\nand honesty there was in him made him shrink from this necessity of\nsatisfying a man with a troublesome tongue; it was as if he were to show\nindignation at the discovery of one barrel with a false bottom, when he\nhad invested his money in a manufactory where a larger or smaller\nnumber of such barrels had always been made. A practical man must seek a\ngood end by the only possible means; that is to say, if he is to get\ninto Parliament he must not be too particular. It was not disgraceful to\nbe neither a Quixote nor a theorist, aiming to correct the moral rules\nof the world: but whatever actually was, or might prove to be,\ndisgraceful, Harold held in detestation. In this mood he pushed on\nunceremoniously to the inner office without waiting to ask questions;\nand when he perceived that Jermyn was not alone he said, with haughty\nquickness--\n\n\"A question about the electioneering at Sproxton. Can you give your\nattention to it at once? Here is Mr. Holt, who has come to me about the\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"A--yes--a--certainly,\" said Jermyn, who, as usual, was the more cool\nand deliberate because he was vexed. He was standing, and, as he turned\nround, his broad figure concealed the person who was seated writing at\nthe bureau. \"Mr. Holt--a--will doubtless--a--make a point of saving a\nbusy man's time. You can speak at once. This gentleman\"--here Jermyn\nmade a slight backward movement of the head--\"is one of ourselves; he is\na true-blue.\"\n\n\"I have simply to complain,\" said Felix, \"that one of your agents has\nbeen sent on a bribing expedition to Sproxton--with what purpose you,\nsir, may know better than I do. Mr. Transome, it appears, was ignorant\nof the affair, and does not approve it.\"\n\nJermyn, looking gravely and steadily at Felix while he was speaking, at\nthe same time drew forth a small sheaf of papers from his side pocket,\nand then, as he turned his eyes slowly on Harold, felt in his\nwaistcoat-pocket for his pencil-case.\n\n\"I don't approve of it at all,\" said Harold, who hated Jermyn's\ncalculated slowness and conceit in his own impenetrability. \"Be good\nenough to put a stop to it, will you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Holt, I know, is an excellent Liberal,\" said Jermyn, just inclining\nhis head to Harold, and then alternately looking at Felix and docketing\nhis bills; \"but he is perhaps too inexperienced to be aware that no\ncanvass--a--can be conducted without the action of able men, who\nmust--a--be trusted, and not interfered with. And as to any possibility\nof promising to put a stop--a--to any procedure--a--that depends. If he\nhad ever held the coachman's ribbons in his hands, as I have in my\nyounger days--a--he would know that stopping is not always easy.\"\n\n\"I know very little about holding ribbons,\" said Felix; \"but I saw\nclearly enough at once that more mischief had been done than could be\nwell mended. Though I believe, if it were heartily tried, the treatment\nmight be reduced and something might be done to hinder the men from\nturning out in a body to make a noise, which might end in worse.\"\n\n\"They might be hindered from making a noise on our side,\" said Jermyn,\nsmiling. \"That is perfectly true. But if they made a noise on the\nother--would your purpose be answered better, sir?\"\n\nHarold was moving about in an irritated manner while Felix and Jermyn\nwere speaking. He preferred leaving the talk to the attorney, of whose\ntalk he himself liked to keep as clear as possible.\n\n\"I can only say,\" answered Felix, \"that if you make use of those heavy\nfellows when the drink is in them, I shouldn't like your responsibility.\nYou might as well drive bulls to roar on our side as bribe a set of\ncolliers and navvies to shout and groan.\"\n\n\"A lawyer may well envy your command of language, Mr. Holt,\" said\nJermyn, pocketing his bills again, and shutting up his pencil; \"but he\nwould not be satisfied with the accuracy--a--of your terms. You must\npermit me to check your use of the word 'bribery.' The essence of\nbribery is, that it should be legally proved; there is not such a\nthing--a--_in rerum natura_--a--as unproved bribery. There has been no\nsuch thing as bribery at Sproxton, I'll answer for it. The presence of a\nbody of stalwart fellows on--a--the Liberal side will tend to preserve\norder; for we know that the benefit clubs from the Pitchley district\nwill show for Debarry. Indeed, the gentleman who has conducted the\ncanvass at Sproxton is experienced in Parliamentary affairs, and would\nnot exceed--a--the necessary measures that a rational judgment would\ndictate.\"\n\n\"What! you mean the man who calls himself Johnson?\" said Felix, in a\ntone of disgust.\n\nBefore Jermyn chose to answer, Harold broke in, saying, quickly and\nperemptorily, \"The long and short of it is this, Mr. Holt: I shall\ndesire and insist that whatever can be done by way of remedy shall be\ndone. Will that satisfy you? You see now some of the candidate's\ndifficulties?\" said Harold, breaking into his most agreeable smile. \"I\nhope you will have some pity for me.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must be content,\" said Felix, not thoroughly propitiated.\n\"I bid you good-morning, gentlemen.\"\n\nWhen he was gone out, and had closed the door behind him, Harold,\nturning round and flashing, in spite of himself, an angry look at\nJermyn, said--\n\n\"And who is Johnson? an _alias_, I suppose. It seems you are fond of the\nname.\"\n\nJermyn turned perceptibly paler, but disagreeables of this sort between\nhimself and Harold had been too much in his anticipations of late for\nhim to be taken by surprise. He turned quietly round and just touched\nthe shoulder of the person seated at the bureau, who now rose.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Jermyn answered, \"the Johnson in question is this\ngentleman, whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you as one of my\nmost active helpmates in electioneering business--Mr. Johnson, of\nBedford Row, London. I am comparatively a novice--a--in these matters.\nBut he was engaged with James Putty in two hardly-contested elections,\nand there could scarcely be a better initiation. Putty is one of the\nfirst men of the country as an agent--a--on the Liberal side--a--eh,\nJohnson? I think Makepiece is--a--not altogether a match for him, not\nquite of the same calibre--a--_haud consimili ingenio_--a--in\ntactics--a--and in experience?\"\n\n\"Makepiece is a wonderful man, and so is Putty,\" said the glib Johnson,\ntoo vain not to be pleased with an opportunity of speaking, even when\nthe situation was rather awkward. \"Makepiece for scheming, but Putty for\nmanagement. Putty knows men, sir,\" he went on, turning to Harold: \"it's\na thousand pities that you have not had his talents employed in your\nservice. He's beyond any man for saving a candidate's money--does half\nthe work with his tongue. He'll talk of anything, from the Areopagus,\nand that sort of thing, down to the joke about 'Where are you going,\nPaddy?'--you know what I mean, sir! 'Back again, says Paddy'--an\nexcellent electioneering joke. Putty understands these things. He has\nsaid to me, 'Johnson, bear in mind there are two ways of speaking an\naudience will always like: one is to tell them what they don't\nunderstand; and the other is, to tell them what they're used to.' I\nshall never be the man to deny that I owe a great deal to Putty. I\nalways say it was a most providential thing in the Mugham election last\nyear that Putty was not on the Tory side. He managed the women; and, if\nyou'll believe me, sir, one-fourth of the men would never have voted if\ntheir wives hadn't driven them to it for the good of their families. And\nas for speaking--it's currently reported in our London circles that\nPutty writes regularly for the _Times_. He has that kind of language;\nand I needn't tell you, Mr. Transome, that it's the apex, which, I take\nit, means the tiptop--and nobody can get higher than that, I think. I've\nbelonged to a political debating society myself; I've heard a little\nlanguage in my time; but when Mr. Jermyn first spoke to me about having\nthe honor to assist in your canvass of North Loamshire\"--here Johnson\nplayed with his watch-seals and balanced himself a moment on his\ntoes--\"the very first thing I said was, 'And there's Garstin has got\nPutty! No Whig could stand against a Whig,' I said, 'who had Putty on\nhis side: I hope Mr. Transome goes in for something of a deeper color.'\nI don't say that, as a general rule, opinions go for much in a return,\nMr. Transome; it depends on who are in the field before you, and on the\nskill of your agents. But as a Radical, and a moneyed Radical, you are\nin a fine position, sir; and with care and judgment--with care and\njudgment----\"\n\nIt had been impossible to interrupt Johnson before, without the most\nimpolitic rudeness. Jermyn was not sorry that he should talk, even if he\nmade a fool of himself; for in that solid shape, exhibiting the average\namount of human foibles, he seemed less of the _alias_ which Harold had\ninsinuated him to be, and had all the additional plausibility of a lie\nwith a circumstance.\n\nHarold had thrown himself with contemptuous resignation into a chair,\nhad drawn off one of his buff gloves, and was looking at his hand. But\nwhen Johnson gave his iteration with a slightly slackened pace, Harold\nlooked up at him and broke in--\n\n\"Well then, Mr. Johnson, I shall be glad if you will use your care and\njudgment in putting an end, as well as you can, to this Sproxton affair;\nelse it may turn out an ugly business.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir; I must beg you to look at the matter a little more\nclosely. You will see that it is impossible to take a single step\nbackward at Sproxton. It was a matter of necessity to get the Sproxton\nmen; else I know to a certainty the other side would have laid hold of\nthem first, and now I've undermined Garstin's people. They'll use their\nauthority, and give a little shabby treating, but I've taken all the\nwind out of their sails. But if, by your orders, I or Mr. Jermyn here\nwere to break promise with the honest fellows, and offend Chubb the\npublican, what would come of it? Chubb would leave no stone unturned\nagainst you, sir; he would egg on his customers against you; the\ncolliers and navvies would be at the nomination and the election all the\nsame, or rather not all the same, for they would be there against us;\nand instead of hustling people good-humoredly by way of a joke, and\ncounterbalancing Debarry's cheers, they'd help to kick the cheering and\nvoting out of our men, and instead of being, let us say, half-a-dozen\nahead of Garstin, you'd be half-a-dozen behind him, that's all. I speak\nplain English to you, Mr. Transome, though I've the highest respect for\nyou as a gentleman of first-rate talents and position. But, sir, to\njudge of these things a man must know the English voter and the English\npublican; and it would be a poor tale indeed\"--here Mr. Johnson's mouth\ntook an expression at once bitter and pathetic--\"that a gentleman like\nyou, to say nothing of the good of the country, should have gone to the\nexpense and trouble of a canvass for nothing but to find himself out of\nParliament at the end of it. I've seen it again and again; it looks bad\nin the cleverest man to have to sing small.\"\n\nMr. Johnson's argument was not the less stringent because his idioms\nwere vulgar. It requires a conviction and resolution amounting to\nheroism not to wince at phrases that class our foreshadowed endurance\namong those common and ignominious troubles which the world is more\nlikely to sneer at than to pity. Harold remained a few minutes in angry\nsilence looking at the floor, with one hand on his knee and the other on\nhis hat, as if he were preparing to start up.\n\n\"As to undoing anything that's been done down there,\" said Johnson,\nthrowing in this observation as something into the bargain, \"I must wash\nmy hands of it, sir. I couldn't work knowingly against your interest.\nAnd that young man who is just gone out,--you don't believe that he need\nbe listened to, I hope? Chubb, the publican, hates him. Chubb would\nguess he was at the bottom of your having the treating stopped, and he'd\nset half-a-dozen of the colliers to duck him in the canal, or break his\nhead by mistake. I'm an experienced man, sir. I hope I've put it clear\nenough.\"\n\n\"Certainly, the exposition befits the subject,\" said Harold, scornfully,\nhis dislike of the man Johnson's personality being stimulated by causes\nwhich Jermyn more than conjectured. \"It's a damned, unpleasant, ravelled\nbusiness that you and Mr. Jermyn have knit up between you. I've no more\nto say.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, if you've no more commands, I don't wish to intrude. I shall\nwish you good-morning, sir,\" said Johnson, passing out quickly.\n\nHarold knew that he was indulging his temper, and he would probably have\nrestrained it as a foolish move if he had thought there was great danger\nin it. But he was beginning to drop much of his caution and self-mastery\nwhere Jermyn was concerned, under the growing conviction that the\nattorney had very strong reasons for being afraid of him; reasons which\nwould only be reinforced by any action hostile to the Transome interest.\nAs for a sneak like this Johnson, a gentleman had to pay him, not to\nplease him. Harold had smiles at command in the right place, but he was\nnot going to smile when it was neither necessary nor agreeable. He was\none of those good-humored, yet energetic men, who have the gift of\nanger, hatred, and scorn upon occasion, though they are too healthy and\nself-contented for such feelings to get generated in them without\nexternal occasion. And in relation to Jermyn the gift was coming into\nfine exercise.\n\n\"A--pardon me, Mr. Harold,\" said Jermyn, speaking as soon as Johnson\nwent out, \"but I am sorry--a--you should behave disobligingly to a man\nwho has it in his power to do much service--who, in fact, holds many\nthreads in his hands. I admit that--a--_nemo mortalium omnibus horis\nsapit_, as we say--a----\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Harold. \"I don't talk in tags of Latin, which\nmight be learned by a school-master's foot-boy. I find the King's\nEnglish expresses my meaning better.\"\n\n\"In the King's English, then,\" said Jermyn, who could be idiomatic\nenough when he was stung, \"a candidate should keep his kicks till he's a\nmember.\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose Johnson will bear a kick if you bid him. You're his\nprincipal, I believe.\"\n\n\"Certainly, thus far--a--he is my London agent. But he is a man of\nsubstance, and----\"\n\n\"I shall know what he is if it's necessary, I dare say. But I must jump\ninto the carriage again. I've no time to lose; I must go to Hawkins at\nthe factory. Will you go?\"\n\nWhen Harold was gone, Jermyn's handsome face gathered blackness. He\nhardly ever wore his worst expression in the presence of others, and but\nseldom when he was alone, for he was not given to believe that any game\nwould ultimately go against him. His luck had been good. New conditions\nmight always turn up to give him new chances; and if affairs threatened\nto come to an extremity between Harold and himself, he trusted to\nfinding some sure resource.\n\n\"He means to see to the bottom of everything if he can, that's quite\nplain,\" said Jermyn to himself. \"I believe he has been getting another\nopinion; he has some new light about those annuities on the estate that\nare held in Johnson's name. He has inherited a deuced faculty for\nbusiness--there's no denying that. But I shall beg leave to tell him\nthat I've propped up the family. I don't know where they would have been\nwithout me; and if it comes to balancing, I know into which scale the\ngratitude ought to go. Not that he's likely to feel any--but he can feel\nsomething else; and if he makes signs of setting the dogs on me, I shall\nmake him feel it. The people named Transome owe me a good deal more than\nI owe them.\"\n\nIn this way Mr. Jermyn inwardly appealed against an unjust construction\nwhich he foresaw that his old acquaintance the law might put on certain\nitems in his history.\n\nI have known persons who have been suspected of under-valuing gratitude,\nand excluding it from the list of virtues; but on closer observation it\nhas been seen that, if they have never felt grateful, it has been for\nwant of an opportunity; and that, far from despising gratitude, they\nregard it as the virtue most of all incumbent--on others toward them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n    The little, nameless, unremembered acts\n    Of kindness and of love.\n\n                                  --WORDSWORTH: _Tintern Abbey_.\n\n\nJermyn did not forget to pay his visit to the minister in Malthouse Yard\nthat evening. The mingled irritation, dread and defiance which he was\nfeeling toward Harold Transome in the middle of the day depended on too\nmany and far-stretching causes to be dissipated by eight o'clock; but\nwhen he left Mr. Lyon's house he was in a state of comparative triumph\nin the belief that he, and he alone, was now in possession of facts\nwhich, once grouped together, made a secret that gave him new power over\nHarold.\n\nMr. Lyon, in his need for help from one who had that wisdom of the\nserpent which, he argued, is not forbidden, but is only of hard\nacquirement to dovelike innocence, had been gradually led to pour out to\nthe attorney all the reasons which made him desire to know the truth\nabout the man who called himself Maurice Christian: he had shown all the\nprecious relics, the locket, the letters, and the marriage certificate.\nAnd Jermyn had comforted him by confidently promising to ascertain,\nwithout scandal or premature betrayals, whether this man were really\nAnnette's husband, or Maurice Christian Bycliffe.\n\nJermyn was not rash in making this promise, since he had excellent\nreasons for believing that he had already come to a true conclusion on\nthe subject. But he wished both to know a little more of this man\nhimself, and to keep Mr. Lyon in ignorance--not a difficult\nprecaution--in an affair which it cost the minister so much pain to\nspeak of. An easy opportunity of getting an interview with Christian was\nsure to offer itself before long--might even offer itself to-morrow.\nJermyn had seen him more than once, though hitherto without any reason\nfor observing him with interest; he had heard that Philip Debarry's\ncourier was often busy in the town, and it seemed specially likely that\nhe would be seen there when the market was to be agitated by politics,\nand the new candidate was to show his paces.\n\nThe world of which Treby Magna was the centre was, naturally, curious to\nsee the young Transome, who had come from the East, was as rich as a\nJew, and called himself a Radical--characteristics all equally vague in\nthe minds of various excellent ratepayers, who drove to market in their\ntaxed carts or in their hereditary gigs. Places at convenient windows\nhad been secured beforehand for a few best bonnets; but, in general, a\nRadical candidate excited no ardent feminine partisanship, even among\nthe Dissenters in Treby, if they were of the prosperous and\nlong-resident class. Some chapel-going ladies were fond of remembering\nthat \"their family had been Church\"; others objected to politics\naltogether as having spoiled old neighborliness, and sundered friends\nwho had kindred views as to cowslip wine and Michaelmas cleaning;\nothers, of the melancholy sort, said it would be well if people would\nthink less of reforming Parliament and more of pleasing God.\nIrreproachable Dissenting matrons, like Mrs. Muscat, whose youth had\nbeen passed in a short-waisted bodice and tight skirt, had never been\nanimated by the struggle for liberty, and had a timid suspicion that\nreligion was desecrated by being applied to the things of this world.\nSince Mr. Lyon had been in Malthouse Yard there had been far too much\nmixing up of politics with religion; but, at any rate, these ladies had\nnever yet been to hear speechifying in the market-place, and they were\nnot going to begin that practice.\n\nEsther, however, had heard some of her feminine acquaintances say that\nthey intended to sit at the druggist's upper window, and she was\ninclined to ask her father if he could think of a suitable place where\nshe also might see and hear. Two inconsistent motives urged her. She\nknew that Felix cared earnestly for public questions, and she supposed\nthat he held it one of her deficiencies not to care about them: well,\nshe would try to learn the secret of this ardor, which was so strong in\nhim that it animated what she thought the dullest form of life. She was\nnot too stupid to find it out. But this self-correcting motive was\npresently displaced by a motive of a different sort. It had been a\npleasant variety in her monotonous days to see a man like Harold\nTransome, with a distinguished appearance and polished manners, and she\nwould like to see him again: he suggested to her that brighter and more\nluxurious life on which her imagination dwelt without the painful effort\nit required to conceive the mental condition which would place her in\ncomplete sympathy with Felix Holt. It was this less unaccustomed\nprompting of which she was chiefly conscious when she awaited her\nfather's coming down to breakfast. Why, indeed, should she trouble\nherself so much about Felix?\n\nMr. Lyon, more serene now that he had unbosomed his anxieties and\nobtained a promise of help, was already swimming so happily in the deep\nwater of polemics in expectation of Philip Debarry's answer to his\nchallenge, that, in the occupation of making a few notes lest certain\nfelicitous inspirations should be wasted, he had forgotten to come down\nto breakfast. Esther, suspecting his abstraction, went up to his study,\nand found him at his desk looking up with wonder at her interruption.\n\n\"Come, father, you have forgotten your breakfast.\"\n\n\"It is true, child, I will come,\" he said, lingering to make some final\nstrokes.\n\n\"Oh, you naughty father!\" said Esther, as he got up from his chair,\n\"your coat-collar is twisted, your waistcoat is buttoned all wrong, and\nyou have not brushed your hair. Sit down and let me brush it again as I\ndid yesterday.\"\n\nHe sat down obediently, while Esther took a towel, which she threw over\nhis shoulders, and then brushed the thick, long fringe of soft auburn\nhair. This very trifling act, which she had brought herself to for the\nfirst time yesterday, meant a great deal in Esther's little history. It\nhad been her habit to leave the mending of her father's clothes to\nLyddy; she had not liked even to touch his cloth garments; still less\nhad it seemed a thing she would willingly undertake to correct his\ntoilette, and use a brush for him. But having once done this, under her\nnew sense of faulty omission, the affectionateness that was in her\nflowed so pleasantly, as she saw how much her father was moved by what\nhe thought a great act of tenderness, that she quite longed to repeat\nit. This morning, as he sat under her hands, his face had such a calm\ndelight in it that she could not help kissing the top of his bald head;\nand afterward, when they were seated at breakfast, she said, merrily--\n\n\"Father, I shall make a _petit ma\u00c3\u00aetre_ of you by-and-by; your hair looks\nso pretty and silken when it is well brushed.\"\n\n\"Nay, child, I trust that while I would willingly depart from my evil\nhabit of a somewhat slovenly forgetfulness in my attire, I shall never\narrive at the opposite extreme. For though there is that in apparel\nwhich pleases the eye, and I deny not that your neat gown and the color\nthereof--which is that of certain little flowers that spread themselves\nin the hedgerows, and make a blueness there as of the sky when it is\ndeepened in the water--I deny not, I say, that these minor strivings\nafter a perfection which is, as it were, an irrecoverable yet haunting\nmemory, are a good in their proportion. Nevertheless, the brevity of our\nlife, and the hurry and crush of the great battle with error and sin,\noften oblige us to an advised neglect of what is less momentous. This, I\nconceive, is the principle on which my friend Felix Holt acts; and I\ncannot but think the light comes from the true fount, though it shines\nthrough obstructions.\"\n\n\"You have not seen Mr. Holt since Sunday, have you, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was here yesterday. He sought Mr. Transome, having a matter of\nsome importance to speak upon with him. And I saw him afterward in the\nstreet, when he agreed that I should call for him this morning before I\ngo into the market-place. He will have it,\" Mr. Lyon went on, smiling,\n\"that I must not walk about in the crowd without him to act as my\nspecial constable.\"\n\nEsther felt vexed with herself that her heart was suddenly beating with\nunusual quickness, and that her last resolution not to trouble herself\nabout what Felix thought had transformed itself with magic swiftness\ninto mortification that he evidently avoided coming to the house when\nshe was there, though he used to come on the slightest occasion. He knew\nthat she was always at home until the afternoon on market-days: that was\nthe reason why he would not call for her father. Of course it was\nbecause he attributed such littleness to her that he supposed she would\nretain nothing else than a feeling of offence toward him for what he had\nsaid to her. Such distrust of any good in others, such arrogance of\nimmeasurable superiority, was extremely ungenerous. But presently she\nsaid--\n\n\"I should have liked to hear Mr. Transome speak, but I suppose it is too\nlate to get a place now.\"\n\n\"I am not sure, I would fain have you go if you desire it, my dear,\"\nsaid Mr. Lyon, who could not bear to deny Esther any lawful wish. \"Walk\nwith me to Mrs. Holt's, and we will learn from Felix, who will doubtless\nalready have been out, whether or not he could lead you in safety to\nFriend Lambert's.\"\n\nEsther was glad of the proposal, because, if it answered no other\npurpose, it would be an easy way of obliging Felix to see her, and of\nshowing him that it was not she who cherished offence. But when, later\nin the morning, she was walking toward Mrs. Holt's with her father, they\nmet Mr. Jermyn, who stopped them to ask, in his most affable manner,\nwhether Miss Lyon intended to hear the candidate, and whether she had\nsecured a suitable place. And he ended by insisting that his daughters,\nwho were presently coming in an open carriage, should call for her if\nshe would permit them. It was impossible to refuse this civility, and\nEsther turned back to await the carriage, pleased with the certainty of\nhearing and seeing, yet sorry to miss Felix. There was another day for\nher to think of him with unsatisfied resentment, mixed with some\nlongings for a better understanding: and in our spring-time every day\nhas its hidden growths in the mind, as it has in the earth when the\nlittle folded blades are getting ready to pierce the ground.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n    Consistency?--I never changed my mind,\n    Which is, and always was, to live at ease.\n\n\nIt was only in the time of summer fairs that the market-place had ever\nlooked more animated than it did under that autumn midday sun. There\nwere plenty of blue cockades and streamers, faces at all the windows,\nand a crushing buzzing crowd, urging each other backward and forward\nround the small hustings in front of the Ram Inn, which showed its more\nplebeian sign at right angles with the venerable Marquis of Granby.\nSometimes there were scornful shouts, sometimes a rolling cascade of\ncheers, sometimes the shriek of a penny whistle; but above all these\nfitful and feeble sounds, the fine old church-tower, which looked down\nfrom above the trees on the other side of the narrow stream, sent\nvibrating, at every quarter, the sonorous tones of its great bell, the\nGood Queen Bess.\n\nTwo carriages, with blue ribbons on the harness, were conspicuous near\nthe hustings. One was Jermyn's, filled with the brilliantly-attired\ndaughters, accompanied by Esther, whose quieter dress helped to mark her\nout for attention as the most striking of the group. The other was\nHarold Transome's; but in this there was no lady--only the olive-skinned\nDominic, whose acute yet mild face was brightened by the occupation of\namusing little Harry and rescuing from his tyrannies a King Charles\npuppy, with big eyes, much after the pattern of the boy's.\n\nThis Trebian crowd did not count for much in the political force of the\nnation, but it was not the less determined as to lending or not lending\nits ears. No man was permitted to speak from the platform except Harold\nand his uncle Lingon, though, in the interval of expectation, several\nLiberals had come forward. Among these ill-advised persons the one whose\nattempt met the most emphatic resistance was Rufus Lyon. This might have\nbeen taken for resentment at the unreasonableness of the cloth, that,\nnot content with pulpits, from whence to tyrannize over the ears of men,\nwishes to have the larger share of the platforms; but it was not so, for\nMr. Lingon was heard with much cheering, and would have been welcomed\nagain.\n\nThe rector of Little Treby had been a favorite in the neighborhood since\nthe beginning of the century. A clergyman thoroughly unclerical in his\nhabits had a piquancy about him which made him a sort of practical joke.\nHe had always been called Jack Lingon, or Parson Jack--sometimes, in\nolder and less serious days, even \"Cock-fighting Jack.\" He swore a\nlittle when the point of a joke seemed to demand it, and was fond of\nwearing a colored bandana tied loosely over his cravat, together with\nlarge brown leather leggings; he spoke in a pithy familiar way that\npeople could understand, and had none of that frigid mincingness called\ndignity, which some have thought a peculiar clerical disease. In fact,\nhe was \"a charicter--\" something cheerful to think of, not entirely out\nof connection with Sunday and sermons. And it seemed in keeping that he\nshould have turned sharp round in politics, his opinions being only\npart of the excellent joke called Parson Jack. When his red eagle face\nand white hair were seen on the platform, the Dissenters hardly cheered\nthis questionable Radical; but to make amends, all the Tory farmers gave\nhim a friendly \"hurray.\" \"Let's hear what old Jack will say for\nhimself,\" was the predominant feeling among them; \"he'll have something\nfunny to say, I'll bet a penny.\"\n\nIt was only Lawyer Labron's young clerks and their hangers-on who were\nsufficiently dead to Trebian traditions to assail the parson with\nvarious sharp-edged interjections, such as broken shells, and cries of\n\"Cock-a-doodle-doo.\"\n\n\"Come now, my lads,\" he began, in his full, pompous, yet jovial tones,\nthrusting his hands into the stuffed-out pockets of his greatcoat, \"I'll\ntell you what; I'm a parson you know; I ought to return good for evil.\nSo here are some good nuts for you to crack in return for your shells.\"\n\nThere was a roar of laughter and cheering as he threw handfuls of nuts\nand filberts among the crowd.\n\n\"Come now, you'll say I used to be a Tory; and some of you, whose faces\nI know as well as I know the head of my own crab-stick, will say that's\nwhy I'm a good fellow. But now I'll tell you something else. It's for\nthat very reason--that I used to be a Tory, and am a good fellow--that I\ngo along with my nephew here, who is a thorough-going Liberal. For will\nanybody here come forward and say, 'A good fellow has no need to tack\nabout and change his road?' No, there's not one of you such a Tom-noddy.\nWhat's good for one time is bad for another. If anybody contradicts\nthat, ask him to eat pickled pork when he's thirsty, and to bathe in the\nLapp there when the spikes of ice are shooting. And that's the reason\nwhy the men who are the best Liberals now are the very men who used to\nbe the best Tories. There isn't a nastier horse than your horse that'll\njib and back and turn round when there is but one road for him to go,\nand that's the road before him.\n\n\"And my nephew here--he comes of a Tory breed, you know--I'll answer for\nthe Lingons. In the old Tory times there was never a pup belonged to a\nLingon but would howl if a Whig came near him. The Lingon blood is good,\nrich old Tory blood--like good rich milk--and that's why, when the right\ntime comes, it throws up a liberal cream. The best sort of Tory turns to\nthe best sort of Radical. There's plenty of Radical scum--I say, beware\nof the scum, and look but for the cream. And here's my nephew--some of\nthe cream, if there is any: none of your Whigs, none of your painted\nwater that looks as if it ran, and it's standing still all the while;\nnone of your spinning-jenny fellows. A gentleman; but up to all sorts of\nbusiness. I'm no fool myself; I'm forced to wink a good deal, for fear\nof seeing too much, for a neighborly man must let himself be cheated a\nlittle. But though I've never been out of my own country, I know less\nabout it than my nephew does. You may tell what he is, and only look at\nhim. There's one sort of fellow sees nothing but the end of his own\nnose, and another sort that sees nothing but the hinder side of the\nmoon; but my nephew Harold is of another sort; he sees everything that's\nat hitting distance, and he's not one to miss his mark. A good-looking\nman in his prime! Not a greenhorn; not a shrivelled old fellow, who'll\ncome to speak to you and find he's left his teeth at home by mistake.\nHarold Transome will do you credit; if anybody says the Radicals are a\nset of sneaks, Brummagem half-pennies, scamps who want to play\npitch-and-toss with the property of the country, you can say, 'Look at\nthe member for North Loamshire!' And mind what you'll hear him say;\nhe'll go in for making everything right--Poor-laws and Charities and\nChurch--he wants to reform 'em all. Perhaps you'll say, 'There's that\nParson Lingon talking about Church Reform--why, he belongs to the Church\nhimself--he wants reforming too.' Well, well, wait a bit, and you'll\nhear by-and-by that old Parson Lingon is reformed--shoots no more,\ncracks his joke no more, has drunk his last bottle: the dogs, the old\npointers, will be sorry; but you'll hear that the Parson at Little Treby\nis a new man. That's what Church Reform is sure to come to before long.\nSo now here are some more nuts for you, lads, and I leave you to listen\nto your candidate. Here he is--give him a good hurray; wave your hats,\nand I'll begin. Hurray!\"\n\nHarold had not been quite confident beforehand as to the good effect of\nhis uncle's introduction; but he was soon reassured. There was no acrid\npartisanship among the old-fashioned Tories who mustered strong about\nthe Marquis of Granby, and Parson Jack had put them in a good humor.\nHarold's only interruption came from his own party. The oratorical clerk\nat the Factory, acting as the tribune of the Dissenting interest, and\nfeeling bound to put questions, might have been troublesome; but his\nvoice being unpleasantly sharp, while Harold's was full and\npenetrating, the questioning was cried down. Harold's speech \"did\": it\nwas not of the glib-nonsensical sort, not ponderous, not\nhesitating--which is as much as to say, that it was remarkable among\nBritish speeches. Read in print the next day, perhaps it would be\nneither pregnant nor conclusive, which is saying no more than that its\nexcellence was not of an abnormal kind, but such as is usually found in\nthe best efforts of eloquent candidates. Accordingly, the applause\ndrowned the opposition, and content predominated.\n\nBut, perhaps, the moment of most diffusive pleasure from public speaking\nis that in which the speech ceases and the audience can turn to\ncommenting on it. The one speech, sometimes uttered under great\nresponsibility as to missiles and other consequences, has given a text\nto twenty speakers who are under no responsibility. Even in the days of\nduelling a man was not challenged for being a bore, nor does this\nquality apparently hinder him from being much invited to dinner, which\nis the great index of social responsibility in a less barbarous age.\n\nCertainly the crowd in the market-place seemed to experience this\nculminating enjoyment when the speaking on the platform in front of the\nRam had ceased, and there were no less than three orators holding forth\nfrom the elevation of chance vehicles, not at all to the prejudice of\nthe talking among those who were on a level with their neighbors. There\nwas little ill-humor among the listeners, for Queen Bess was striking\nthe last quarter before two, and a savory smell from the inn kitchens\ninspired them with an agreeable consciousness that the speakers were\nhelping to trifle away the brief time before dinner.\n\nTwo or three of Harold's committee had lingered talking to each other on\nthe platform, instead of re-entering; and Jermyn, after coming out to\nspeak to one of them, had turned to the corner near which the carriages\nwere standing, that he might tell the Transome's coachman to drive round\nto the side door and signal to his own coachman to follow. But a\ndialogue which was going on below induced him to pause, and instead of\ngiving the order, to assume the air of a careless gazer. Christian, whom\nthe attorney had already observed looking out of a window at the Marquis\nof Granby, was talking to Dominic. The meeting appeared to be one of new\nrecognition, for Christian was saying:\n\n\"You've not got gray, as I have, Mr. Lenoni; you're not a day older for\nthe sixteen years. But no wonder you didn't know me; I'm bleached like a\ndried bone.\"\n\n\"Not so. It is true I was confused a meenute--I could put your face\nnowhere; but, after that, Naples came behind it, and I said, Mr.\nCreesstian. And so you reside at the Manor, and I am at Transome Court.\"\n\n\"Ah! it's a thousand pities you're not on our side, else we might have\ndined together at the Marquis,\" said Christian. \"Eh, could you manage\nit?\" he added, languidly, knowing there was no chance of a yes.\n\n\"No--much obliged--couldn't leave the leetle boy. Ahi! Arry, Arry, pinch\nnot poor Moro.\"\n\nWhile Dominic was answering, Christian had stared about him, as his\nmanner was when he was being spoken to, and had had his eyes arrested by\nEsther, who was leaning forward to look at Mr. Harold Transome's\nextraordinary little gypsy of a son. But, happening to meet Christian's\nstare, she felt annoyed, drew back, and turned away her head, coloring.\n\n\"Who are those ladies?\" said Christian, in a low tone, to Dominic, as if\nhe had been startled into a sudden wish for this information.\n\n\"They are Meester Jermyn's daughters,\" said Dominic, who knew nothing\neither of the lawyer's family or of Esther.\n\nChristian looked puzzled a moment or two, and was silent.\n\n\"Oh, well--_au revoir_,\" he said, kissing the tips of his fingers as the\ncoachman, having had Jermyn's order, began to urge on the horses.\n\n\"Does he see some likeness in the girl?\" thought Jermyn, as he turned\naway. \"I wish I hadn't invited her to come in the carriage, as it\nhappens.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n    \"Good earthenware pitchers, sir!--of an excellent quaint pattern\n    and sober color.\"\n\n\nThe market dinner at \"the Marquis\" was in high repute in Treby and its\nneighborhood. The frequenters of this three-and-sixpenny ordinary liked\nto allude to it, as men allude to anything which implies that they move\nin good society, and habitually converse with those who are in the\nsecret of the highest affairs. The guests were not only such rural\nresidents as had driven to market, but some of the most substantial\ntownsmen, who had always assured their wives that business required this\nweekly sacrifice of domestic pleasure. The poorer farmers, who put up at\nthe Ram or the Seven Stars, where there was no fish, felt their\ndisadvantage, bearing it modestly or bitterly, as the case might be;\nand although the Marquis was a Tory house, devoted to Debarry, it was\ntoo much to expect that such tenants of the Transomes as had always been\nused to dine there, should consent to eat a worse dinner, and sit with\nworse company, because they suddenly found themselves under a Radical\nlandlord, opposed to the political party known as Sir Maxim's. Hence the\nrecent political divisions had not reduced the handsome length of the\ntable at the Marquis; and the many gradations of dignity--from Mr. Wace,\nthe brewer, to the rich butcher from Leek Malton, who always modestly\ntook the lowest seat, though without the reward of being asked to come\nup higher--had not been abbreviated by any secessions.\n\nTo-day there was an extra table spread for expected supernumeraries, and\nit was at this that Christian took his place with some of the younger\nfarmers, who had almost a sense of dissipation in talking to a man of\nhis questionable station and unknown experience. The provision was\nespecially liberal, and on the whole the presence of a minority destined\nto vote for Transome was a ground for joking, which added to the good\nhumor of the chief talkers. A respectable old acquaintance turned\nRadical rather against his will, was rallied with even greater gusto\nthan if his wife had had twins twice over. The best Trebian Tories were\nfar too sweet-blooded to turn against such old friends, and to make no\ndistinction between them and the Radical, Dissenting, Papistical,\nDeistical set with whom they never dined, and probably never saw except\nin their imagination. But the talk was necessarily in abeyance until the\nmore serious business of dinner was ended, and the wine, spirits, and\ntobacco raised mere satisfaction into beatitude.\n\nAmong the frequent though not regular guests, whom every one was glad to\nsee, was Mr. Nolan, the retired London hosier, a wiry old gentleman past\nseventy, whose square, tight forehead, with its rigid hedge of gray\nhair, whose bushy eyebrows, sharp dark eyes, and remarkable hooked nose,\ngave a handsome distinction to his face in the midst of rural\nphysiognomies. He had married a Miss Pendrell early in life, when he was\na poor young Londoner, and the match had been thought as bad as ruin by\nher family; but fifteen years ago he had had the satisfaction of\nbringing his wife to settle amongst her own friends, and of being\nreceived with pride as a brother-in-law, retired from business,\npossessed of unknown thousands, and of a most agreeable talent for\nanecdote and conversation generally. No question had ever been raised\nas to Mr. Nolan's extraction on the strength of his hooked nose, or of\nhis name being Baruch. Hebrew names \"ran\" in the best Saxon families;\nthe Bible accounted for them; and no one among the uplands and hedgerows\nof that district was suspected of having an oriental origin unless he\ncarried a peddler's jewel-box. Certainly, whatever genealogical research\nmight have discovered, the worthy Baruch Nolan was so free from any\ndistinctive marks of religious persuasion--he went to church with so\nordinary an irregularity, and so often grumbled at the sermon--that\nthere was no ground for classing him otherwise than with good Trebian\nChurchmen. He was generally regarded as a good-looking old gentleman,\nand a certain thin eagerness in his aspect was attributed to the life of\nthe metropolis, where narrow space had the same sort of effect on men as\non thickly-planted trees. Mr. Nolan always ordered his pint of port,\nwhich, after he had sipped it a little, was wont to animate his\nrecollections of the Royal Family, and the various ministries which had\nbeen contemporary with the successive stages of his prosperity. He was\nalways listened to with interest: a man who had been born in the year\nwhen good old King George came to the throne--who had been acquainted\nwith the nude leg of the Prince Regent, and hinted at private reasons\nfor believing that the Princess Charlotte ought not to have died--had\nconversational matter as special to his auditors as Marco Polo could\nhave had on his return from his Asiatic travel.\n\n\"My good sir,\" he said to Mr. Wace, as he crossed his knees and spread\nhis silk handkerchief over them, \"Transome may be returned, or he may\nnot be returned--that's a question for North Loamshire; but it makes\nlittle difference to the kingdom. I don't want to say things which may\nput younger men out of spirits, but I believe this country has seen it's\nbest days--I do, indeed.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it from one of your experience, Mr. Nolan,\" said the\nbrewer, a large, happy-looking man. \"I'd make a good fight myself before\nI'd leave a worse world for my boys than I've found for myself. There\nisn't a greater pleasure than doing a bit of planting and improving\none's buildings, and investing one's money in some pretty acres of land,\nand when it turns up here and there--land you've known from a boy. It's\na nasty thought that these Radicals are to turn things round so as one\ncan calculate on nothing. One doesn't like it for one's self, and one\ndoesn't like it for one's neighbors. But somehow, I believe it won't\ndo: if we can't trust the Government just now, there's Providence and\nthe good sense of the country; and there's a right in things--that's\nwhat I've always said--there's a right in things. The heavy end will get\ndownmost. And if Church and King, and every man being sure of his own,\nare things good for this country, there's a God above will take care of\n'em.\"\n\n\"It won't do, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Nolan--\"It won't do. When Peel and\nthe Duke turned round about the Catholics in '29, I saw it was all over\nwith us. We could never trust ministers any more. It was to keep off a\nrebellion, they said; but I say it was to keep their places. They're\nmonstrously fond of place, both of them--that I know.\" Here Mr. Nolan\nchanged the crossing of his legs, and gave a deep cough, conscious of\nhaving made a point. Then he went on--\"What we want is a king with a\ngood will of his own. If we'd had that, we shouldn't have heard what\nwe've heard to-day; Reform would never have come to this pass. When our\ngood old King George III. heard his ministers talking about Catholic\nEmancipation, he boxed their ears all round. Ah, poor soul! he did\nindeed, gentlemen,\" ended Mr. Nolan, shaken by a deep laugh of\nadmiration.\n\n\"Well, now, that's something like a king,\" said Mr. Crowder, who was an\neager listener.\n\n\"It was uncivil, though. How did they take it?\" said Mr. Timothy Rose, a\n\"gentleman farmer\" from Leek Malton, against whose independent position\nnature had provided the safeguard of a spontaneous servility. His large\nporcine cheeks, round twinkling eyes, and thumbs habitually twirling,\nexpressed a concentrated effort not to get into trouble, and to speak\neverybody fair except when they were safely out of hearing.\n\n\"Take it! they'd be obliged to take it,\" said the impetuous young Joyce,\na farmer of superior information. \"Have you ever heard of the king's\nprerogative?\"\n\n\"I don't say but what I have,\" said Rose, retreating. \"I've nothing\nagainst it--nothing at all.\"\n\n\"No, but the Radicals have,\" said young Joyce, winking. \"The prerogative\nis what they want to clip close. They want us to be governed by\ndelegates from the trades-unions, who are to dictate to everybody, and\nmake everything square to their mastery.\"\n\n\"They're a pretty set, now, these delegates,\" said Mr. Wace, with\ndisgust. \"I once heard two of 'em spouting away. They're a sort of\nfellow I'd never employ in my brewery, or anywhere else. I've seen it\nagain and again. If a man takes to tongue-work it's all over with him.\n'Everything's wrong,' says he. That's a big text. But does he want to\nmake everything right? Not he. He'd lose his text. 'We want every man's\ngood,' say they. Why, they never knew yet what a man's good is. How\nshould they? It's working for his victual--not getting a slice of other\npeople's.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said young Joyce, cordially. \"I should just have liked all the\ndelegates in the country mustered for our yeomanry to go into--that's\nall. They'd see where the strength of Old England lay then. You may tell\nwhat it is for a country to trust to trade when it breeds such spindling\nfellows as those.\"\n\n\"That isn't the fault of trade, my good sir,\" said Mr. Nolan, who was\noften a little pained by the defects of provincial culture. \"Trade,\nproperly conducted, is good for a man's constitution. I could have shown\nyou, in my time, weavers past seventy, with all their faculties as sharp\nas a pen-knife, doing without spectacles. It's the new system of trade\nthat's to blame: a country can't have too much trade if it's properly\nmanaged. Plenty of sound Tories have made their fortune by trade. You've\nheard of Calibut & Co.--everybody has heard of Calibut. Well, sir, I\nknew old Mr. Calibut as well as I know you. He was once a crony of mine\nin a city warehouse; and now, I'll answer for it, he has a larger rent\nroll than Lord Wyvern. Bless your soul! his subscriptions to charities\nwould make a fine income for a nobleman. And he's as good a Tory as I\nam. And as for his town establishment--why, how much butter do you think\nis consumed there annually?\"\n\nMr. Nolan paused, and then his face glowed with triumph as he answered\nhis own question. \"Why, gentlemen, not less than two thousand pounds of\nbutter during the few months the family is in town! Trade makes\nproperty, my good sir, and property is conservative, as they say now.\nCalibut's son-in-law is Lord Fortinbras. He paid me a large debt on his\nmarriage. It's all one web, sir. The prosperity of the country is one\nweb.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Christian, who, smoking his cigar with his chair\nturned away from the table, was willing to make himself agreeable in the\nconversation. \"We can't do without nobility. Look at France. When they\ngot rid of the old nobles they were obliged to make new.\"\n\n\"True, very true,\" said Mr. Nolan, who thought Christian a little too\nwise for his position, but could not resist the rare gift of an instance\nin point. \"It's the French Revolution that has done us harm here. It was\nthe same at the end of the last century, but the war kept it off--Mr.\nPitt saved us. I knew Mr. Pitt. I had a particular interview with him\nonce. He joked me about getting the length of his foot. 'Mr. Nolan,'\nsaid he, 'there are those on the other side of the water whose name\nbegins with N. who would be glad to know what you know.' I was\nrecommended to send an account of that to the newspapers after his\ndeath, poor man! but I'm not fond of that kind of show myself.\" Mr.\nNolan swung his upper leg a little, and pinched his lip between his\nthumb and finger, naturally pleased with his own moderation.\n\n\"No, no--very right,\" said Mr. Wace, cordially. \"But you never said a\ntruer word than that about property. If a man's got a bit of property, a\nstake in the country, he'll want to keep things square. Where Jack isn't\nsafe, Tom's in danger. But that's what makes it such an uncommonly nasty\nthing that a man like Transome should take up with these Radicals. It's\nmy belief he does it only to get into Parliament; he'll turn round when\nhe gets there. Come, Dibbs, there's something to put you in spirits,\"\nadded Mr. Wace, raising his voice a little and looking at a guest lower\ndown. \"You've got to vote for a Radical with one side of your mouth, and\nmake a wry face with the other; but he'll turn round by-and-by. As\nParson Jack says, he's got the right sort of blood in him.\"\n\n\"I don't care two straws who I vote for,\" said Dibbs, sturdily. \"I'm not\ngoing to make a wry face. It stands to reason a man should vote for his\nlandlord. My farm's in good condition, and I've got the best pasture on\nthe estate. The rot's never come nigh me. Let them grumble as are on the\nwrong side of the hedge.\"\n\n\"I wonder if Jermyn'll bring him in, though,\" said Mr. Sircome, the\ngreat miller. \"He's an uncommon fellow for carrying things through. I\nknow he brought me through that suit about my weir; it cost a pretty\npenny, but he brought me through.\"\n\n\"It's a bit of a pill for him, too, having to turn Radical,\" said Mr.\nWace. \"They say he counted on making friends with Sir Maximus, by this\nyoung one coming home and joining with Mr. Philip.\"\n\n\"But I'll bet a penny he brings Transome in,\" said Mr. Sircome. \"Folks\nsay he hasn't got many votes hereabout; but toward Duffield, and all\nthere, where the Radicals are, everybody's for him. Eh, Mr. Christian?\nCome--you're at the fountain-head--what do they say about it now at the\nManor?\"\n\nWhen general attention was called to Christian young Joyce looked down\nat his own legs and touched the curves of his own hair, as if measuring\nhis own approximation to that correct copy of a gentleman. Mr. Wace\nturned his head to listen for Christian's answer with that tolerance of\ninferiority which becomes men in places of public resort.\n\n\"They think it will be a hard run between Transome and Garstin,\" said\nChristian. \"It depends on Transome's getting plumpers.\"\n\n\"Well, I know I shall not split for Garstin,\" said Mr. Wace. \"It's\nnonsense for Debarry's voters to split for a Whig. A man's either a Tory\nor not a Tory.\"\n\n\"It seems reasonable there should be one of each side,\" said Mr. Timothy\nRose. \"I don't like showing favor either way. If one side can't lower\nthe poor's rates and take off the tithe, let the other try.\"\n\n\"But there's this in it, Wace,\" said Mr. Sircome. \"I'm not altogether\nagainst the Whigs. For they don't want to go so far as the Radicals do,\nand when they find they've slipped a bit too far they'll hold on all the\ntighter. And the Whigs have got the upper hand now, and it's no use\nfighting with the current. I run with the----\"\n\nMr. Sircome checked himself, looked furtively at Christian, and, to\ndivert criticisms, ended with--\"eh, Mr. Nolan?\"\n\n\"There have been eminent Whigs, sir. Mr. Fox was a Whig,\" said Mr.\nNolan. \"Mr. Fox was a great orator. He was very intimate with the Prince\nof Wales. I've seen him, and the Duke of York too, go home by daylight\nwith their hats crushed. Mr. Fox was a great leader of Opposition:\nGovernment requires an Opposition. The Whigs should always be in\nopposition, and the Tories on the ministerial side. That's what the\ncountry used to like. 'The Whigs for salt and mustard, the Tories for\nmeat,' Mr. Gottlib, the banker, used to say to me. Mr. Gottlib was a\nworthy man. When there was a great run on Mr. Gottlib's bank in '16, I\nsaw a gentleman come in with bags of gold, and say, 'Tell Mr. Gottlib\nthere's plenty more where that came from.' It stopped the run,\ngentlemen--it did indeed.\"\n\nThis anecodote was received with great admiration, but Mr. Sircome\nreturned to the previous question.\n\n\"There now, you see, Wace--it's right there should be Whigs as well as\nTories--Pitt and Fox--I've always heard them go together.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like Garstin,\" said the brewer. \"I didn't like his\nconduct about the Canal Company. Of the two, I like Transome best. If a\nnag is to throw me, I say, let him have some blood.\"\n\n\"As for blood, Wace,\" said Mr. Salt, the wool-factor, a bilious man, who\nonly spoke when there was a good opportunity of contradicting, \"ask my\nbrother-in-law, Labron, a little about that. These Transomes are not the\nold blood.\"\n\n\"Well, they're the oldest that's forthcoming, I suppose,\" said Mr. Wace,\nlaughing. \"Unless you believe in mad old Tommy Trounsem. I wonder where\nthat old poaching fellow is now.\"\n\n\"I saw him half-drunk the other day,\" said young Joyce. \"He'd got a\nflag-basket with handbills in it over his shoulder.\"\n\n\"I thought the old fellow was dead,\" said Mr. Wace. \"Hey! why, Jermyn,\"\nhe went on merrily, as he turned round and saw the attorney entering;\n\"you Radical! how dare you show yourself in this Tory house? Come, this\nis going a bit too far. We don't mind Old Harry managing our law for\nus--that's his proper business from time immemorial; but----\"\n\n\"But--a--\" said Jermyn, smiling, always ready to carry on a joke, to\nwhich his slow manner gave the piquancy of surprise, \"if he meddles with\npolitics he must be a Tory.\"\n\nJermyn was not afraid to show himself anywhere in Treby. He knew many\npeople were not exactly fond of him, but a man can do without that, if\nhe is prosperous. A provincial lawyer in those old-fashioned days was as\nindependent of personal esteem as if he had been a Lord Chancellor.\n\nThere was a good-humored laugh at this upper end of the room as Jermyn\nseated himself at about an equal angle between Mr. Wace and Christian.\n\n\"We were talking about old Tommy Trounsem; you remember him? They say\nhe's turned up again,\" said Mr. Wace.\n\n\"Ah?\" said Jermyn, indifferently. \"But--a--Wace--I'm very busy\nto-day--but I wanted to see you about that bit of land of yours at the\ncorner of Pod's End. I've had a handsome offer for you--I'm not at\nliberty to say from whom--but an offer that ought to tempt you.\"\n\n\"It won't tempt me,\" said Mr. Wace, peremptorily, \"if I've got a bit of\nland, I'll keep it. It's hard enough to get hereabouts.\"\n\n\"Then I'm to understand that you refuse all negotiation?\" said Jermyn,\nwho had ordered a glass of sherry, and was looking around slowly as he\nsipped it, till his eyes seemed to rest for the first time on Christian,\nthough he had seen him at once on entering the room.\n\n\"Unless one of the confounded railways should come. But then I'll stand\nout and make 'em bleed for it.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approbation; the railways were a public wrong much\ndenunciated in Treby.\n\n\"A--Mr. Philip Debarry at the Manor now?\" said Jermyn, suddenly\nquestioning Christian, in a haughty tone of superiority which he often\nchose to use.\n\n\"No,\" said Christian, \"he is expected to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Ah!----\" Jermyn paused a moment or two, and then said, \"You are\nsufficiently in his confidence, I think, to carry a message to him with\na small document?\"\n\n\"Mr. Debarry has often trusted me so far,\" said Christian, with much\ncoolness; \"but if the business is yours, you can probably find some one\nyou know better.\"\n\nThere was a little winking and grimacing among those of the company who\nheard this answer.\n\n\"A--true--a,\" said Jermyn, not showing any offence; \"if you decline. But\nI think, if you will do me the favor to step round to my residence on\nyour way back, and learn the business, you will prefer carrying it\nyourself. At my residence, if you please--not my office.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Christian. \"I shall be very happy.\" Christian\nnever allowed himself to be treated as a servant by anyone but his\nmaster, and his master treated a servant more deferentially than an\nequal.\n\n\"Will it be five o'clock? what hour shall we say?\" said Jermyn.\n\nChristian looked at his watch and said, \"About five I can be there.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Jermyn, finishing his sherry.\n\n\"Well--a--Wace--a--so you will hear nothing about Pod's End?\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"A mere pocket-handkerchief, not enough to swear by-a--\" here Jermyn's\nface broke into a smile--\"without a magnifying-glass.\"\n\n\"Never mind. It's mine into the bowels of the earth and up to the sky. I\ncan build the Tower of Babel on it if I like--eh, Mr. Nolan?\"\n\n\"A bad investment, my good sir,\" said Mr. Nolan, who enjoyed a certain\nflavor of infidelity in this smart reply, and laughed much at it in his\ninward way.\n\n\"See now, how blind you Tories are,\" said Jermyn, rising; \"if I had been\nyour lawyer, I'd have had you make another forty-shilling freeholder\nwith that land, and all in time for this election. But--a--the verbum\nsapientibus comes a little too late now.\"\n\nJermyn was moving away as he finished speaking, but Mr. Wace called out\nafter him, \"We're not so badly off for votes as you are--good sound\nvotes, that'll stand the Revising Barrister. Debarry at the top of the\npoll!\"\n\nThe lawyer was already out of the doorway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n    'Tis grievous that with all amplification of travel both by sea and\n    land, a man can never separate himself from his past history.\n\n\nMr. Jermyn's handsome house stood a little way out of the town,\nsurrounded by garden and lawn and plantations of hopeful trees. As\nChristian approached it he was in a perfectly easy state of mind: the\nbusiness he was going on was none of his, otherwise than as he was well\nsatisfied with any opportunity of making himself valuable to Mr. Philip\nDebarry. As he looked at Jermyn's length of wall and iron railing, he\nsaid to himself, \"These lawyers are the fellows for getting on in the\nworld with the least expense of civility. With this cursed conjuring\nsecret of theirs called Law, they think everybody is frightened at them.\nMy Lord Jermyn seems to have his insolence as ready as his soft sawder.\nHe's as sleek as a rat, and has as vicious a tooth. I know the sort of\nvermin well enough. I've helped to fatten one or two.\"\n\nIn this mood of conscious, contemptuous penetration, Christian was shown\nby the footman into Jermyn's private room, where the attorney sat\nsurrounded with massive oaken bookcases, and other furniture to\ncorrespond, from the thickest-legged library-table to the calendar frame\nand card-rack. It was the sort of a room a man prepares for himself when\nhe feels sure of a long and respectable future. He was leaning back in\nhis leather chair, against the broad window opening on the lawn, and had\njust taken off his spectacles and let the newspaper fall on his knees,\nin despair of reading by the fading light.\n\nWhen the footman opened the door and said, \"Mr. Christian,\" Jermyn said,\n\"Good evening, Mr. Christian. Be seated,\" pointing to a chair opposite\nhimself and the window. \"Light the candles on the shelf, John, but leave\nthe blinds alone.\"\n\nHe did not speak again till the man was gone out, but appeared to be\nreferring to a document which lay on the bureau before him. When the\ndoor was closed he drew himself up again, began to rub his hands, and\nturned toward his visitor, who seemed perfectly indifferent to the fact\nthat the attorney was in shadow, and that the light fell on himself.\n\n\"A--your name--a--is Henry Scaddon.\"\n\nThere was a start through Christian's frame which he was quick enough,\nalmost simultaneously, to try and disguise as a change of position. He\nuncrossed his legs and unbuttoned his coat. But before he had time to\nsay anything, Jermyn went on with slow emphasis.\n\n\"You were born on the sixteenth of December, 1782, at Blackheath. Your\nfather was a cloth-merchant in London: he died when you were barely of\nage, leaving an extensive business: before you were five-and-twenty you\nhad run through the greater part of the property, and had compromised\nyour safety by an attempt to defraud your creditors. Subsequently you\nforged a check on your father's elder brother, who had intended to make\nyou his heir.\"\n\nHere Jermyn paused a moment and referred to the document. Christian was\nsilent.\n\n\"In 1808 you found it expedient to leave this country in a military\ndisguise, and were taken prisoner by the French. On the occasion of an\nexchange of prisoners you had the opportunity of returning to your own\ncountry, and to the bosom of your own family. You were generous enough\nto sacrifice that prospect in favor of a fellow-prisoner, of about your\nown age and figure, who had more pressing reasons than yourself for\nwishing to be on this side of the water. You exchanged dress, luggage,\nand names with him, and he passed to England instead of you as Henry\nScaddon. Almost immediately afterward you escaped from your\nimprisonment, after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of\nnames from being discovered; and it was reported that you--that is, you\nunder the name of your fellow-prisoner--were drowned in an open boat,\ntrying to reach a Neapolitan vessel bound for Malta. Nevertheless I\nhave to congratulate you on the falsehood of that report, and on the\ncertainty that you are now, after the lapse of more than twenty years,\nseated here in perfect safety.\"\n\nJermyn paused so long that he was evidently awaiting some answer. At\nlast Christian replied in a dogged tone--\n\n\"Well, sir, I've heard much longer stories than that told quite as\nsolemnly, when there was not a word of truth in them. Suppose I deny the\nvery peg you hang your statement on. Suppose I say I am not Henry\nScaddon.\"\n\n\"A--in that case--a,\" said Jermyn, with wooden indifference, \"you would\nlose the advantage which--a--may attach to your possession of Henry\nScaddon's knowledge. And at the same time, if it were in the\nleast--a--inconvenient to you that you should be recognized as Henry\nScaddon, your denial would not prevent me from holding the knowledge and\nevidence which I possess on that point; it would only prevent us from\npursuing the present conversation.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, suppose we admit, for the sake of the conversation, that\nyour account of the matter is the true one: what advantage have you to\noffer the man named Henry Scaddon?\"\n\n\"The advantage--a--is problematical; but it may be considerable. It\nmight, in fact, release you from the necessity of acting as courier,\nor--a--valet, or whatever other office you may occupy which prevents you\nfrom being your own master. On the other hand, my acquaintance with your\nsecret is not necessarily a disadvantage to you. To put the matter in a\nnutshell, I am not inclined--a--gratuitously--to do you any harm, and I\nmay be able to do you a considerable service.\"\n\n\"Which you want me to earn somehow?\" said Christian. \"You offer me a\nturn in a lottery?\"\n\n\"Precisely. The matter in question is of no earthly interest to you,\nexcept--a--as it may yield you a prize. We lawyers have to do with\ncomplicated questions, and--a--legal subtleties, which are\nnever--a--fully known even to the parties immediately interested, still\nless to the witnesses. Shall we agree, then, that you continue to retain\ntwo-thirds of the name which you gained by exchange, and that you oblige\nme by answering certain questions as to the experience of Henry\nScaddon?\"\n\n\"Very good. Go on.\"\n\n\"What articles of property once belonging to your fellow-prisoner,\nMaurice Christian Bycliffe, do you still retain?\"\n\n\"This ring,\" said Christian, twirling round the fine seal-ring on his\nfinger, \"his watch, and the little matters that hung with it, and a case\nof papers. I got rid of a gold snuff-box once when I was hard up. The\nclothes are all gone, of course. We exchanged everything; it was all\ndone in a hurry. Bycliffe thought we should meet again in England before\nlong, and he was mad to get there. But that was impossible--I mean that\nwe should meet soon after. I don't know what's become of him, else I\nwould give him up his papers and the watch, and so on--though, you know,\nit was I who did _him_ the service, and he felt that.\"\n\n\"You were at Vesoul together before being moved to Verdun?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What else do you know about Bycliffe?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing very particular,\" said Christian pausing, and rapping his\nboot with his cane. \"He'd been in the Hanoverian army--a high-spirited\nfellow, took nothing easily; not over-strong in health. He made a fool\nof himself with marrying at Vesoul; and there was the devil to pay with\nthe girl's relations; and then, when the prisoners were ordered off,\nthey had to part. Whether they ever got together again I don't know.\"\n\n\"Was the marriage all right then?\"\n\n\"Oh, all on the square--civil marriage, church--everything. Bycliffe was\na fool--a good-natured, proud, headstrong fellow.\"\n\n\"How long did the marriage take place before you left Vesoul?\"\n\n\"About three months. I was witness to the marriage.\"\n\n\"And you know no more about the wife?\"\n\n\"Not afterward. I knew her very well before--pretty Annette--Annette\nLedru was her name. She was of a good family, and they had made up a\nfine match for her. But she was one of your meek little diablesses, who\nhave a will of their own once in their lives--the will to choose their\nown master.\"\n\n\"Bycliffe was not open to you about his other affairs?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--a fellow you wouldn't dare to ask a question of. People told\nhim everything, but he told nothing in return. If Madame Annette ever\nfound him again, she found her lord and master with a vengeance; but she\nwas a regular lapdog. However, her family shut her up--made a prisoner\nof her--to prevent her running away.\"\n\n\"Ah--good. Much of what you have been so obliging as to say is\nirrelevant to any possible purpose of mine, which, in fact, has only to\ndo with a mouldy law-case that might be aired some day. You will\ndoubtless, on your own account, maintain perfect silence on what has\npassed between us, and with that condition duly preserved--a--it is\npossible that--a--the lottery you have put into--as you observe--may\nturn up a prize.\"\n\n\"This, then, is all the business you have with me?\" said Christian,\nrising.\n\n\"All. You will, of course, preserve carefully all the papers and other\narticles which have so many--a--recollections--a--attached to them?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. If there's any chance of Bycliffe turning up again, I shall be\nsorry to have parted with the snuff-box; but I was hard-up at Naples. In\nfact, as you see, I was obliged at last to turn courier.\"\n\n\"An exceedingly agreeable life for a man of some--a--accomplishments\nand--a--no income,\" said Jermyn, rising, and reaching a candle, which he\nplaced against his desk.\n\nChristian knew this was a sign that he was expected to go, but he\nlingered standing, with one hand on the back of his chair. At last, he\nsaid rather sulkily--\n\n\"I think you're too clever, Mr. Jermyn, not to perceive that I'm not a\nman to be made a fool of.\"\n\n\"Well--a--it may perhaps be a still better guarantee for you,\" said Jermyn,\nsmiling, \"that I see no use in attempting that--a--metamorphosis.\"\n\n\"The old gentleman, who ought never to have felt himself injured, is\ndead now, and I'm not afraid of creditors after more than twenty years.\"\n\n\"Certainly not;--a--there may indeed be claims which can't assert\nthemselves--a--legally, which yet are molesting to a man of some\nreputation. But you may perhaps be happily free from such fears.\"\n\nJermyn drew round his chair toward the bureau, and Christian, too acute\nto persevere uselessly, said, \"Good-day,\" and left the room.\n\nAfter leaning back in his chair to reflect a few minutes, Jermyn wrote\nthe following letter:--\n\n    DEAR JOHNSON,--I learn from your letter, received this morning,\n    that you intend returning to town on Saturday.\n\n    While you are there, be so good as to see Medwin, who used to be\n    with Batt & Cowley, and ascertain from him indirectly, and in the\n    course of conversation on other topics, whether in that old\n    business in 1810-11, Scaddon _alias_ Bycliffe, or Bycliffe _alias_\n    Scaddon, before his imprisonment, gave Batt & Cowley any reason to\n    believe that he was married and expected to have a child. The\n    question, as you know, is of no practical importance; but I wish to\n    draw up an abstract of the Bycliffe case, and the exact position in\n    which it stood before the suit was closed by the death of the\n    plaintiff, in order that, if Mr. Harold Transome desires it, he may\n    see how the failure of the last claim has secured the\n    Durfey-Transome title, and whether there is a hair's breadth of\n    chance that another claim should be set up.\n\n    Of course there is not a shadow of such a chance. For even if Batt\n    & Cowley were to suppose that they had alighted on a surviving\n    representative of the Bycliffes, it would not enter their heads to\n    set up a new claim, since they brought evidence that the last life\n    which suspended the Bycliffe remainder was extinct before the case\n    was closed, a good twenty years ago.\n\n    Still I want to show the present heir of the Durfey-Transomes the\n    exact condition of the family title to the estates. So get me an\n    answer from Medwin on the above mentioned point.\n\n    I shall meet you at Duffield next week. We must get Transome\n    returned. Never mind his having been a little rough the other day,\n    but go on doing what you know is necessary for his interest. His\n    interest is mine, which I need not say is John Johnson's.\n\n                Yours faithfully,                MATTHEW JERMYN.\n\nWhen the attorney had sealed this letter and leaned back in his chair\nagain, he was inwardly saying--\n\n\"Now, Mr. Harold, I shall shut up this affair in a private drawer till\nyou choose to take any extreme measures which will force me to bring it\nout. I have the matter entirely in my own power. No one but old Lyon\nknows about the girl's birth. No one but Scaddon can clench the evidence\nabout Bycliffe, and I've got Scaddon under my thumb. No soul except\nmyself and Johnson, who is a limb of myself, knows that there is one\nhalf-dead life which may presently leave the girl a new claim to the\nBycliffe heirship. I shall learn through Methurst whether Batt & Cowley\nknew, through Bycliffe, of this woman having come to England. I shall\nhold all the threads between my thumb and finger. I can use the evidence\nor I can nullify it.\n\n\"And so, if Mr. Harold pushes me to extremity, and threatens me with\nchancery and ruin, I have an opposing threat, which will either save me\nor turn into a punishment for him.\"\n\nHe rose, put out his candles, and stood with his back to the fire,\nlooking out on the dim lawn, with its black twilight fringe of shrubs,\nstill meditating. Quick thought was gleaming over five-and-thirty years\nfilled with devices more or less clever, more or less desirable to be\navowed. Those which might be avowed with impunity were not always to be\ndistinguished as innocent by comparison with those which it was\nadvisable to conceal. In a profession where much that is noxious may be\ndone without disgrace, is a conscience likely to be without balm when\ncircumstances have urged a man to overstep the line where his good\ntechnical information makes him aware that (with discovery) disgrace is\nlikely to begin?\n\nWith regard to the Transome affairs, the family had been in pressing\nneed of money, and it had lain with him to get it for them: was it to be\nexpected that he would not consider his own advantage where he had\nrendered services such as are never fully paid? If it came to a question\nof right and wrong instead of law, the least justifiable things he had\never done had been done on behalf of the Transomes. It had been a\ndeucedly unpleasant thing for him to get Bycliffe arrested and thrown\ninto prison as Henry Scaddon--perhaps hastening the man's death in that\nway. But if it had not been done by dint of his (Jermyn's) exertions and\ntact, he would like to know where the Durfey-Transomes might have been\nby this time. As for right or wrong, if the truth were known, the very\npossession of the estate by the Durfey-Transomes was owing to law-tricks\nthat took place nearly a century ago, when the original old Durfey got\nhis base fee.\n\nBut inward argument of this sort now, as always, was merged in anger, in\nexasperation, that Harold, precisely Harold Transome, should have turned\nout to be the probable instrument of a visitation which would be bad\nluck, not justice; for is there any justice where ninety-nine out of\nevery hundred escape? He felt himself beginning to hate Harold as he had\nnever--\n\nJust then Jermyn's third daughter, a tall slim girl, wrapped in a white\nwoollen shawl, which she had hung over her blanket-wise, skipped across\nthe lawn toward the greenhouse to get a flower. Jermyn was startled, and\ndid not identify the figure, or rather he identified it falsely with\nanother tall white-wrapped figure which had sometimes set his heart\nbeating quickly more than thirty years before. For a moment he was fully\nback in those distant years when he and another bright-eyed person had\nseen no reason why they should not indulge their passion and their\nvanity, and determine for themselves how their lives should be made\ndelightful in spite of unalterable external conditions. The reasons had\nbeen unfolding themselves gradually ever since through all the years\nwhich had converted the handsome, soft-eyed, slim young Jermyn (with a\ntouch of sentiment) into a portly lawyer of sixty, for whom life had\nresolved itself into the means of keeping up his head among his\nprofessional brethren and maintaining an establishment--into a\ngray-haired husband and father, whose third affectionate and expensive\ndaughter now rapped at the window and called to him, \"Papa, papa, get\nready for dinner; don't you remember that the Lukyns are coming?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n    Her gentle looks shot arrows, piercing him\n    As gods are pierced, with poison of sweet pity.\n\n\nThe evening of the market-day had passed, and Felix had not looked in at\nMalthouse Yard to talk over the public events with Mr. Lyon. When Esther\nwas dressing the next morning, she had reached a point of irritated\nanxiety to see Felix, at which she found herself devising little schemes\nfor attaining that end in some way that would be so elaborate as to seem\nperfectly natural. Her watch had a long-standing ailment of losing;\npossibly it wanted cleaning; Felix would tell her if it merely wanted\nregulating, whereas Mr. Prowd might detain it unnecessarily, and cause\nher useless inconvenience. Or could she not get a valuable hint from\nMrs. Holt about the home-made bread, which was something as \"sad\" as\nLyddy herself? Or, if she came home that way at twelve o'clock, Felix\nmight be going out, she might meet him, and not be obliged to call.\nOr--but it would be very much beneath her to take any steps of this\nsort. Her watch had been losing for the last two months--why should it\nnot go on losing a little longer? She could think of no devices that\nwere not so transparent as to be undignified. All the more undignified\nbecause Felix chose to live in a way that would prevent any one from\nclassing him according to his education and mental refinement--\"which\ncertainly are very high,\" said Esther, inwardly, coloring, as if in\nanswer to some contrary allegation, \"else I should not think his opinion\nof any consequence.\" But she came to the conclusion that she could not\npossibly call at Mrs. Holt's.\n\nIt followed that, up to a few minutes past twelve, when she reached the\nturning toward Mrs. Holt's, she believed that she should go home the\nother way; but at the last moment there is always a reason not existing\nbefore--namely, the impossibility of further vacillation. Esther turned\nthe corner without any visible pause, and in another minute was knocking\nat Mrs. Holt's door, not without an inward flutter, which she was bent\non disguising.\n\n\"It's never you, Miss Lyon! who'd have thought of seeing you at this\ntime? Is the minister ill? I thought he looked creechy. If you want\nhelp, I'll put my bonnet on.\"\n\n\"Don't keep Miss Lyon at the door, mother; ask her to come in,\" said the\nringing voice of Felix, surmounting various small shufflings and\nbabbling voices within.\n\n\"It's my wish for her to come in, I'm sure,\" said Mrs. Holt, making way;\n\"but what is there for her to come in to? a floor worse than any public.\nBut step in, pray, if you're so inclined. When I've been forced to take\nmy bit of carpet up, and have benches, I don't see why I need mind\nnothing no more.\"\n\n\"I only came to ask Mr. Holt if he would look at my watch for me,\" said\nEsther, entering, and blushing a general rose-color.\n\n\"He'll do that fast enough,\" said Mrs. Holt, with emphasis; \"that's one\nof the things he _will_ do.\"\n\n\"Excuse my rising, Miss Lyon,\" said Felix; \"I'm binding up Job's\nfinger.\"\n\nJob was a small fellow about five, with a germinal nose, large round\nblue eyes, and red hair that curled close to his head like the wool on\nthe back of an infantine lamb. He had evidently been crying, and the\ncorners of his mouth were still dolorous. Felix held him on his knee as\nhe bound and tied up very cleverly a tiny forefinger. There was a table\nin front of Felix and against the window, covered with his watchmaking\nimplements and some open books. Two benches stood at right angles on the\nsanded floor, and six or seven boys of various ages up to twelve were\ngetting their caps and preparing to go home. They huddled themselves\ntogether and stood still when Esther entered. Felix could not look up\ntill he had finished his surgery, but he went on speaking.\n\n\"This is a hero, Miss Lyon. This is Job Tudge, a bold Briton whose\nfinger hurts him, but who doesn't mean to cry. Good-morning, boys. Don't\nlose your time. Get out into the air.\"\n\nEsther seated herself on the end of the bench near Felix, much relieved\nthat Job was the immediate object of attention; and the other boys\nrushed out behind her with a brief chant of \"Good-morning!\"\n\n\"Did you ever see,\" said Mrs. Holt, standing to look on, \"how wonderful\nFelix is at that small work with his large fingers? And that's because\nhe learned doctoring. It isn't for want of cleverness he looks like a\npoor man, Miss Lyon. I've left off speaking, else I should say it's a\nsin and a shame.\"\n\n[Illustration: FELIX HOLT AND JOB TUDGE.]\n\n\"Mother,\" said Felix, who often amused himself and kept good-humored by\ngiving his mother answers that were unintelligible to her, \"you have an\nastonishing readiness in the Ciceronian antiphrasis, considering you\nhave never studied oratory. There, Job--thou patient man--sit still if\nthou wilt; and now we can look at Miss Lyon.\"\n\nEsther had taken off her watch and was holding it in her hand. But he\nlooked at her face, or rather at her eyes, as he said, \"You want me to\ndoctor your watch?\"\n\nEsther's expression was appealing and timid, as it had never been before\nin Felix's presence; but when she saw the perfect calmness, which to her\nseemed coldness, of his clear gray eyes, as if he saw no reason for\nattaching any emphasis to this first meeting, a pang swift as an\nelectric shock darted through her. She had been very foolish to think so\nmuch of it. It seemed to her as if her inferiority to Felix made a gulf\nbetween them. She could not at once rally her pride and self-command,\nbut let her glance fall on her watch, and said, rather tremulously, \"It\nloses. It is very troublesome. It has been losing a long while.\"\n\nFelix took the watch from her hand; then, looking round and seeing that\nhis mother was gone out of the room, he said, very gently--\n\n\"You look distressed, Miss Lyon. I hope there is no trouble at home\"\n(Felix was thinking of the minister's agitation on the previous Sunday).\n\"But I ought perhaps to beg your pardon for saying so much.\"\n\nPoor Esther was quite helpless. The mortification which had come like a\nbruise to all the sensibilities that had been in keen activity, insisted\non some relief. Her eyes filled instantly, and a great tear rolled down\nwhile she said in a loud sort of whisper, as involuntary as her tears--\n\n\"I wanted to tell you that I was not offended--that I am not\nungenerous--I thought you might think--but you have not thought of it.\"\n\nWas there ever more awkward speaking?--or any behavior less like that of\nthe graceful, self-possessed Miss Lyon, whose phrases were usually so\nwell turned, and whose repartees were so ready?\n\nFor a moment there was silence. Esther had her two little\ndelicately-gloved hands clasped on the table. The next moment she felt\none hand of Felix covering them both and pressing them firmly; but he\ndid not speak. The tears were both on her cheeks now, and she could look\nup at him. His eyes had an expression of sadness in them, quite new to\nher. Suddenly little Job, who had his mental exercises on the occasion,\ncalled out, impatiently--\n\n\"She's tut her finger!\"\n\nFelix and Esther laughed, and drew their hands away; and as Esther took\nher handkerchief to wipe the tears from her cheeks she said--\n\n\"You see, Job, I am a naughty coward. I can't help crying when I've hurt\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Zoo soodn't kuy,\" said Job energetically, being much impressed with a\nmoral doctrine which had come to him after a sufficient transgression of\nit.\n\n\"Job is like me,\" said Felix, \"fonder of preaching than of practice. But\nlet us look at this same watch,\" he went on, opening and examining it.\n\"These little Geneva toys are cleverly constructed to go always a little\nwrong. But if you wind them up and set them regularly every night, you\nmay know at least that it's not noon when the hand points there.\"\n\nFelix chatted, that Esther might recover herself; but now Mrs. Holt came\nback and apologized.\n\n\"You'll excuse my going away, I know, Miss Lyon. But there were the\ndumplings to see to, and what little I've got left on my hands now I\nlike to do well. Not but what I've more cleaning to do than ever I had\nin my life before, as you may tell soon enough if you look at this\nfloor. But when you've been used to doing things, and they've been taken\naway from you, it's as if your hands had been cut off, and you felt the\nfingers as are of no use to you.\"\n\n\"That's a great image, mother,\" said Felix, as he snapped the watch\ntogether and handed it to Esther; \"I never heard you use such an image\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you've always some fault to find with what your mother\nsays. But if ever there was a woman could talk with the open Bible\nbefore her, and not be afraid, it's me. I never did tell stories, and I\nnever will--though I know it's done, Miss Lyon, and by church members\ntoo, when they have candles to sell, as I could bring you to the proof.\nBut I never was one of 'em, let Felix say what he will about the\nprinting on the tickets. His father believed it was gospel truth, and\nit's presumptuous to say it wasn't. For as for curing, how can anybody\nknow? There's no physic'll cure without a blessing, and _with_ a\nblessing I know I've seen a mustard plaister work when there was no more\nsmell nor strength in the mustard than so much flour. And reason\ngood--for the mustard had lain in paper nobody knows how long--so I'll\nleave you to guess.\"\n\nMrs. Holt looked hard out of the window and gave a slight, inarticulate\nsound of scorn.\n\nFelix had leaned back in his chair with a resigned smile, and was\npinching Job's ears.\n\nEsther said, \"I think I had better go now,\" not knowing what else to\nsay, yet not wishing to go immediately, lest she should seem to be\nrunning away from Mrs. Holt. She felt keenly how much endurance there\nmust be for Felix. And she had often been discontented with her father,\nand called him tiresome!\n\n\"Where does Job Tudge live?\" she said, still sitting and looking at the\ndroll little figure, set off by a ragged jacket with a tail about two\ninches deep sticking out above the funniest of corduroys.\n\n\"Job has two mansions,\" said Felix. \"He lives here chiefly; but he has\nanother home, where his grandfather, Mr. Tudge, the stone-breaker,\nlives. My mother is very good to Job, Miss Lyon. She has made him a\nlittle bed in a cupboard, and she gives him sweetened porridge.\"\n\nThe exquisite goodness implied in these words of Felix impressed Esther\nthe more, because in her hearing his talk had usually been pungent and\ndenunciatory. Looking at Mrs. Holt, she saw that her eyes had lost their\nbleak north-easterly expression, and were shining with some mildness on\nlittle Job, who had turned round toward her, propping his head against\nFelix.\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't I be motherly to the child, Miss Lyon?\" said Mrs.\nHolt, whose strong powers of argument required the file of an imagined\ncontradiction, if there were no real one at hand. \"I never was\nhard-hearted, and I never will be. It was Felix picked the child up and\ntook to him, you may be sure, for there's nobody else master where he\nis; but I wasn't going to beat the orphan child and abuse him because of\nthat, and him as straight as an arrow when he's stripped, and me so fond\nof children, and only had one of my own to live. I'd three babies, Miss\nLyon, but the blessed Lord only spared Felix, and him the masterfulest\nand brownest of 'em all. But I did my duty by him, and I said, he'll\nhave more schooling than his father, and he'll grow up a doctor, and\nmarry a woman with money to furnish--as I was myself, spoons and\neverything--and I shall have the grandchildren to look up to me, and be\ndrove out in the gig sometimes, like old Mrs. Lukyn. And you see what\nit's all come to, Miss Lyon: here's Felix made a common man of himself,\nand says he'll never be married--which is the most unreasonable thing,\nand him never easy but when he's got the child on his lap, or when----\"\n\n\"Stop, stop, mother,\" Felix burst in; \"pray don't use that limping\nargument again--that a man should marry because he's fond of children.\nThat's a reason for not marrying. A bachelor's children are always\nyoung: they're immortal children--always lisping, waddling, helpless,\nand with a chance of turning out good.\"\n\n\"The Lord above may know what you mean! And haven't other folks's\nchildren a chance of turning out good?\"\n\n\"Oh, they grow out of it very fast. Here's Job Tudge now,\" said Felix,\nturning the little one round on his knee, and holding his head by the\nback--\"Job's limbs will get lanky; this little fist that looks like a\npuff-ball and can hide nothing bigger than a gooseberry, will get large\nand bony, and perhaps want to clutch more than its share; these wide\nblue eyes that tell me more truth than Job knows, will narrow and narrow\nand try to hide truth that Job would be better without knowing; this\nlittle negative nose will become long and self-asserting; and this\nlittle tongue--put out thy tongue, Job\"--Job, awe-struck under this\nceremony, put out a little red tongue very timidly--\"this tongue, hardly\nbigger than a rose-leaf, will get large and thick, wag out of season, do\nmischief, brag and cant for gain or vanity, and cut as cruelly, for all\nits clumsiness, as if it were a sharp-edged blade. Big Job will perhaps\nbe naughty--\" As Felix, speaking with the loud emphatic distinctness\nhabitual to him, brought out this terribly familiar word, Job's sense of\nmystification became too painful: he hung his lip and began to cry.\n\n\"See here,\" said Mrs. Holt, \"you're frightening the innocent child with\nsuch talk--and it's enough to frighten them that think themselves the\nsafest.\"\n\n\"Look here, Job, my man,\" said Felix, setting the boy down and turning\nhim toward Esther; \"go to Miss Lyon, ask her to smile at you, and that\nwill dry up your tears like the sunshine.\"\n\nJob put his two brown fists on Esther's lap, and she stooped to kiss\nhim. Then holding his face between her hands she said, \"Tell Mr. Holt we\ndon't mean to be naughty, Job. He should believe in us more. But now I\nmust really go home.\"\n\nEsther rose and held out her hand to Mrs. Holt, who kept it while she\nsaid, a little to Esther's confusion--\n\n\"I'm very glad it's took your fancy to come here sometimes, Miss Lyon. I\nknow you're thought to hold your head high, but I speak of people as I\nfind 'em. And I'm sure anybody had need be humble that comes where\nthere's a floor like this--for I've put by my best tea-trays, they're so\nout of all character--I must look Above for comfort now; but I don't say\nI'm not worthy to be called on for all that.\"\n\nFelix had risen and moved toward the door that he might open it and\nshield Esther from more last words on his mother's part.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Holt.\"\n\n\"Will Mr. Lyon like for me to sit with him an hour this evening, do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"Why not? He always likes to see you.\"\n\n\"Then I will come. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"She's a very straight figure,\" said Mrs. Holt. \"How she carries\nherself! But I doubt there's some truth in what our people say. If she\nwon't look at young Muscat, it's the better for _him_. He'd need have a\nbig fortune that marries her.\"\n\n\"That's true, mother,\" said Felix, sitting down, snatching up little\nJob, and finding a vent for some unspeakable feeling in the pretence of\nworrying him.\n\nEsther was rather melancholy as she went home, yet happier withal than\nshe had been for many days before. She thought, \"I need not mind having\nshown so much anxiety about his opinion. He is too clear-sighted to\nmistake our mutual position; he is quite above putting a false\ninterpretation on what I have done. Besides, he had not thought of me at\nall--I saw that plainly enough. Yet he was very kind. There is something\ngreater and better in him than I had imagined. His behavior to-day--to\nhis mother and me too--I should call it the highest gentlemanliness,\nonly it seems in him to be something deeper. But he has chosen an\nintolerable life; though I suppose, if I had a mind equal to his, and if\nhe loved me very dearly, I should choose the same life.\"\n\nEsther felt that she had prefixed an impossible \"if\" to that result. But\nnow she had known Felix her conception of what a happy love must be had\nbecome like a dissolving view, in which the once-dear images were\ngradually melting into new forms and new colors. The favorite Byronic\nheroes were beginning to look like last night's decorations seen in the\nsober dawn. So fast does a little leaven spread within us--so\nincalculable is one personality on another. Behind all Esther's\nthoughts, like an unacknowledged yet constraining presence, there was\nthe sense, that if Felix Holt were to love her, her life would be\nexalted into something quite new--into a sort of difficult blessedness,\nsuch as one may imagine in beings who are conscious of painfully growing\ninto possession of higher powers.\n\nIt was quite true that Felix had not thought the more of Esther because\nof that Sunday afternoon's interview which had shaken her mind to the\nvery roots. He had avoided intruding on Mr. Lyon without special reason,\nbecause he believed the minister to be preoccupied with some private\ncare. He had thought a great deal of Esther with a mixture of strong\ndisapproval and strong liking, which both together made a feeling the\nreverse of indifference; but he was not going to let her have any\ninfluence on his life. Even if his determination had not been fixed, he\nwould have believed that she would utterly scorn him in any other light\nthan that of an acquaintance, and the emotion she had shown to-day did\nnot change that belief. But he was deeply touched by this manifestation\nof her better qualities, and felt that there was a new tie of friendship\nbetween them. That was the brief history Felix would have given of his\nrelation to Esther. And he was accustomed to observe himself. But very\nclose and diligent looking at living creatures, even through the best\nmicroscope, will leave room for new and contradictory discoveries.\n\nFelix found Mr. Lyon particularly glad to talk to him. The minister had\nnever yet disburdened himself about his letter to Mr. Philip Debarry\nconcerning the public conference; and as by this time he had all the\nheads of his discussion thoroughly in his mind, it was agreeable to\nrecite them, as well as to express his regret that time had been lost by\nMr. Debarry's absence from the Manor, which had prevented the immediate\nfulfillment of his pledge.\n\n\"I don't see how he can fulfill it if the rector refuses,\" said Felix,\nthinking it well to moderate the little man's confidence.\n\n\"The rector is of a spirit that will not incur earthly impeachment, and\nhe cannot refuse what is necessary to his nephew's honorable discharge\nof an obligation,\" said Mr. Lyon. \"My young friend, it is a case wherein\nthe prearranged conditions tend by such a beautiful fitness to the issue\nI have sought, that I should have forever held myself a traitor to my\ncharge had I neglected the indication.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n    \"I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused; excuses shall not\n    be admitted; there's no excuse shall serve; you shall not be\n    excused.\"--_Henry IV._\n\n\nWhen Philip Debarry had come home that morning and read the letters\nwhich had not been forwarded to him, he laughed so heartily at Mr.\nLyon's that he congratulated himself on being in his private room.\nOtherwise his laughter would have awakened the curiosity of Sir Maximus,\nand Philip did not wish to tell any one the contents of the letter until\nhe had shown them to his uncle. He determined to ride over to the\nrectory to lunch; for as Lady Mary was away, he and his uncle might be\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a1-t\u00c3\u00aate_.\n\nThe rectory was on the other side of the river, close to the church of\nwhich it was the fitting companion: a fine old brick-and-stone house,\nwith a great bow-window opening from the library on to the deep-turfed\nlawn, one fat dog sleeping on the door-stone, another fat dog waddling\non the gravel, the autumn leaves duly swept away, the lingering\nchrysanthemums cherished, tall trees stooping or soaring in the most\npicturesque variety, and a Virginian creeper turning a little rustic hut\ninto a scarlet pavilion. It was one of those rectories which are among\nthe bulwarks of our venerable institutions--which arrest disintegrating\ndoubt, serve as a double embankment against Popery and Dissent, and\nrally feminine instinct and affection to reinforce the decisions of\nmasculine thought.\n\n\"What makes you look so merry, Phil?\" said the rector, as his nephew\nentered the pleasant library.\n\n\"Something that concerns you,\" said Philip, taking out the letter. \"A\nclerical challenge. Here's an opportunity for you to emulate the divines\nof the sixteenth century and have a theological duel. Read this letter.\"\n\n\"What answer have you sent the crazy little fellow?\" said the rector,\nkeeping the letter in his hand and running over it again and again, with\nbrow knit, but eyes gleaming without any malignity.\n\n\"Oh, I sent no answer. I awaited yours.\"\n\n\"Mine!\" said the rector, throwing down the letter on the table. \"You\ndon't suppose I'm going to hold a public debate with a schismatic of\nthat sort? I should have an infidel shoemaker next expecting me to\nanswer blasphemies delivered in bad grammar.\"\n\n\"But you see how he puts it,\" said Philip. With all his gravity of\nnature he could not resist a slightly mischievous prompting, though he\nhad a serious feeling that he should not like to be regarded as failing\nto fulfill his pledge. \"I think if you refuse, I shall be obliged to\noffer myself.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Tell him he is himself acting a dishonorable part in\ninterpreting your words as a pledge to do any preposterous thing that\nsuits his fancy. Suppose he had asked you to give him land to build a\nchapel on; doubtless that would have given him a 'lively satisfaction.'\nA man who puts a non-natural, strained sense on a promise is no better\nthan a robber.\"\n\n\"But he has not asked for land. I dare say he thinks you won't object to\nhis proposal. I confess there's a simplicity and quaintness about the\nletter that rather pleases me.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you, Phil, he's a crazy little firefly, that does a great\ndeal of harm in my parish. He inflames the Dissenters' minds on\npolitics. There's no end to the mischief done by these busy, prating\nmen. They make the ignorant multitude the judges of the largest\nquestions, both political and religious, till we shall soon have no\ninstitution left that is not on a level with the comprehension of a\nhuckster or a drayman. There can be nothing more retrograde--losing all\nthe results of civilization, all the lessons of Providence--letting the\nwindlass run down after men have been turning at it painfully for\ngenerations. If the instructed are not to judge for the uninstructed,\nwhy, let us set Dick Stubbs to make our almanacs, and have a President\nof the Royal Society elected by universal suffrage.\"\n\nThe rector had risen, placed himself with his back to the fire, and\nthrust his hands in his pockets, ready to insist further on this wide\nargument. Philip sat nursing one leg, listening respectfully, as he\nalways did, though often listening to the sonorous echo of his own\nstatements, which suited his uncle's needs so exactly that he did not\ndistinguish them from his own impressions.\n\n\"True,\" said Philip; \"but in special cases we have to do with special\nconditions. You know I defend the casuists. And it may happen that, for\nthe honor of the church in Treby, and a little also for my honor,\ncircumstances may demand a concession even to some notions of a\nDissenting preacher.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I should be making a figure which my brother clergy might\nwell take as an affront to themselves. The character of the\nEstablishment has suffered enough already through the Evangelicals, with\ntheir extempore incoherence and their pipe-smoking piety. Look at\nWimple, the man who is vicar of Shuttleton--without his gown and bands\nanybody would take him for a grocer in mourning.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall cut a still worse figure, and so will you, in the\nDissenting magazines and newspapers. It will go the round of the\nkingdom. There will be a paragraph headed, 'Tory Falsehood and Clerical\nCowardice,' or else, 'The Meanness of the Aristocracy and the\nIncompetence of the Beneficed Clergy.'\"\n\n\"There would be a worse paragraph if I were to consent to the debate. Of\ncourse it would be said that I was beaten hollow, and, that now the\nquestion had been cleared up at Treba Magna, the Church had not a sound\nleg to stand on. Besides,\" the rector went on, frowning and smiling,\n\"it's all very well for you to talk, Phil; but this debating is not so\neasy when a man's close upon sixty. What one writes or says must be\nsomething good and scholarly; and, after all had been done, this little\nLyon would buzz about one like a wasp, and cross-question and rejoin.\nLet me tell you, a plain truth may be so worried and mauled by fallacies\nas to get the worst of it. There's no such thing as tiring a\ntalking-machine like Lyon.\"\n\n\"Then you absolutely refuse?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"You remember that when I wrote my letter of thanks to Lyon you approved\nmy offer to serve him if possible.\"\n\n\"Certainly I remember it. But suppose he had asked you to vote for civil\nmarriage, or to go and hear him preach every Sunday?\"\n\n\"But he has not asked that.\"\n\n\"Something as unreasonable, though.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Philip, taking up Mr. Lyon's letter and looking\ngraver--looking even vexed, \"it is rather an unpleasant business for me.\nI really felt obliged to him. I think there's a sort of worth in the man\nbeyond his class. Whatever may be the reason of the case, I shall\ndisappoint him instead of doing him the service I offered.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a misfortune; we can't help it.\"\n\n\"The worst of it is, I should be insulting him to say, 'I will do\nanything else, but not just this that you want.' He evidently feels\nhimself in company with Luther and Zwingle and Calvin, and considers our\nletters part of the history of Protestantism.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I know it's rather an unpleasant thing, Phil. You are aware\nthat I would have done anything in reason to prevent you from becoming\nunpopular here. I consider your character a possession to all of us.\"\n\n\"I think I must call on him forthwith and explain and apologize.\"\n\n\"No, sit still; I've thought of something,\" said the rector, with a\nsudden revival of spirits. \"I've just seen Sherlock coming in. He is to\nlunch with me to-day. It would do no harm for him to hold the debate--a\ncurate and a young man--he'll gain by it; and it would release you from\nany awkwardness, Phil. Sherlock is not going to stay here long, you\nknow; he'll soon have his title. I'll put the thing to him. He won't\nobject if I wish it. It's a capital idea. It will do Sherlock good. He's\na clever fellow, but he wants confidence.\"\n\nPhilip had not time to object before Mr. Sherlock appeared--a young\ndivine of good birth and figure, of sallow complexion and bashful\naddress.\n\n\"Sherlock, you have come in most opportunely,\" said the rector. \"A case\nhas turned up in the parish in which you can be of eminent use. I know\nthat is what you have desired ever since you have been with me. But I'm\nabout so much myself that there really has not been sphere enough for\nyou. You are a studious man, I know; I dare say you have all the\nnecessary matter prepared--at your finger-ends, if not on paper.\"\n\nMr. Sherlock smiled with rather a trembling lip, willing to distinguish\nhimself, but hoping that the rector only alluded to a dialogue on\nBaptism by Aspersion, or some other pamphlet suited to the purposes of\nthe Christian Knowledge Society. But as the rector proceeded to unfold\nthe circumstances under which his eminent service was to be rendered, he\ngrew more and more nervous.\n\n\"You'll oblige me very much, Sherlock,\" the rector ended, \"by going into\nthis thing zealously. Can you guess what time you will require? because\nit will rest with us to fix the day.\"\n\n\"I should be rejoiced to oblige you, Mr. Debarry, but I really think I\nam not competent to----\"\n\n\"That's your modesty, Sherlock. Don't let me hear any more of that. I\nknow Filmore of Corpus said you might be a first-rate man if your\ndiffidence didn't do you injustice. And you can refer anything to me,\nyou know. Come, you will set about the thing at once. But, Phil, you\nmust tell the preacher to send a scheme of the debate--all the different\nheads--and he must agree to keep rigidly within the scheme. There, sit\ndown at my desk and write the letter now; Thomas shall carry it.\"\n\nPhilip sat down to write, and the rector, with his firm ringing voice,\nwent on at his ease, giving \"indications\" to his agitated curate.\n\n\"But you can begin at once preparing a good, cogent, clear statement,\nand considering the probable points of assault. You can look into Jewel,\nHall, Hooker, Whitgift, and the rest: you'll find them all here. My\nlibrary wants nothing in English divinity. Sketch the lower ground taken\nby Usher and those men, but bring all your force to bear on marking out\nthe true High-Church doctrine. Expose the wretched cavils of the\nNoncomformists, and the noisy futility that belongs to schismatics\ngenerally. I will give you a telling passage from Burke on the\nDissenters, and some good quotations which I brought together in two\nsermons of my own on the Position of the English Church in Christendom.\nHow long do you think it will take you to bring your thoughts together?\nYou can throw them afterward into the form of an essay; we'll have the\nthing printed; it will do you good with the Bishop.\"\n\nWith all Mr. Sherlock's timidity, there was fascination for him in this\ndistinction. He reflected that he could take coffee and sit up late, and\nperhaps produce something rather fine. It might be a first step toward\nthat eminence which it was no more than his duty to aspire to. Even a\npolemical fame like that of a Philpotts must have had a beginning. Mr.\nSherlock was not insensible to the pleasure of turning sentences\nsuccessfully, and it was a pleasure not always unconnected with\npreferment. A diffident man likes the idea of doing something\nremarkable, which will create belief in him without any immediate\ndisplay of brilliancy. Celebrity may blush and be silent, and win a\ngrace the more. Thus Mr. Sherlock was constrained, trembling all the\nwhile, and much wishing that his essay were already in print.\n\n\"I think I could hardly be ready under a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Very good. Just write that, Phil, and tell him to fix the precise day\nand place. And then we'll go to lunch.\"\n\nThe rector was quite satisfied. He had talked himself into thinking that\nhe should like to give Sherlock a few useful hints, look up his own\nearlier sermons, and benefit the curate by his criticism, when the\nargument had been got into shape. He was a healthy-natured man, but that\nwas not at all a reason why he should not have those sensibilities to\nthe odor of authorship which belong to almost everybody who is not\nexpected to be a writer--and especially to that form of authorship\nwhich is called suggestion, and consists in telling another man that he\nmight do a great deal with a given subject, by bringing a sufficient\namount of knowledge, reasoning, and wit to bear upon it.\n\nPhilip would have had some twinges of conscience about the curate, if he\nhad not guessed that the honor thrust upon him was not altogether\ndisagreeable. The Church might perhaps have had a stronger supporter;\nbut for himself, he had done what he was bound to do: he had done his\nbest toward fulfilling Mr. Lyon's desire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n    If he come not, the play is marred.--_Midsummer Night's Dream._\n\n\nRufus Lyon was very happy on that mild November morning appointed for\nthe great conference in the larger room at the Free School, between\nhimself and the Reverend Theodore Sherlock, B.A. The disappointment of\nnot contending with the rector in person, which had at first been\nbitter, had been gradually lost sight of in the positive enjoyment of an\nopportunity for debating on any terms. Mr. Lyon had two grand elements\nof pleasure on such occasions: confidence in the strength of his case,\nand confidence in his own power of advocacy. Not--to use his own\nphrase--not that \"he glorified himself herein;\" for speech and\nexposition were so easy to him, that if he argued forcibly, he believed\nit to be simply because the truth was forcible. He was not proud of\nmoving easily in his native medium. A panting man thinks of himself as a\nclever swimmer; but a fish swims much better, and takes his performance\nas a matter of course.\n\nWhether Mr. Sherlock were that panting, self-gratulating man, remained a\nsecret. Philip Debarry, much occupied with his electioneering affairs,\nhad only once had an opportunity of asking his uncle how Sherlock got\non, and the rector had said, curtly, \"I think he'll do. I've supplied\nhim well with references. I advise him to read only, and decline\neverything else as out of order. Lyon will speak to a point, and then\nSherlock will read: it will be all the more telling. It will give\nvariety.\" But on this particular morning peremptory business connected\nwith the magistracy called the rector away.\n\nDue notice had been given, and the feminine world of Treby Magna was\nmuch more agitated by the prospect than by that of any candidate's\nspeech. Mrs. Pendrell at the Bank, Mrs. Tiliot, and the Church ladies\ngenerally felt bound to hear the curate, who was known, apparently by an\nintuition concerning the nature of curates, to be a very clever young\nman; and he would show them what learning had to say on the right side.\nOne or two Dissenting ladies were not without emotion at the thought\nthat, seated on the front benches, they should be brought near to old\nChurch friends, and have a longer greeting than had taken place since\nthe Catholic Emancipation. Mrs. Muscat, who had been a beauty, and was\nas nice in her millinery as any Trebian lady belonging to the\nEstablishment, reflected that she should put on her best embroidered\ncollar, and that she should ask Mrs. Tiliot where it was in Duffield\nthat she once got her bed-hanging dyed so beautifully. When Mrs. Tiliot\nwas Mary Salt, the two ladies had been bosom friends; but Mr. Tiliot\nlooked higher and higher since his gin had become so famous; and in the\nyear '29 he had, in Mr. Muscat's hearing, spoken of Dissenters as\nsneaks--a personality which could not be overlooked.\n\nThe debate was to begin at eleven, for the rector would not allow the\nevening to be chosen, when low men and boys might want to be admitted\nout of mere mischief. This was one reason why the female part of the\naudience outnumbered the males. But some chief Trebians were there, even\nmen whose means made them as independent of theory as Mr. Pendrell and\nMr. Wace; encouraged by reflecting that they were not in a place of\nworship, and would not be obliged to stay longer than they chose. There\nwas a muster of all Dissenters who could spare the morning time, and on\nthe back benches were all the aged Churchwomen who shared the remnants\nof the sacrament wine, and who were humbly anxious to neglect nothing\necclesiastical or connected with \"going to a better place.\"\n\nAt eleven the arrival of listeners seemed to have ceased. Mr. Lyon was\nseated on the school tribune or dais at his particular round table;\nanother round table, with a chair, awaited the curate, with whose\nsuperior position it was quite in keeping that he should not be the\nfirst on the ground. A couple of extra chairs were placed farther back,\nand more than one important personage had been requested to act as\nchairman; but no Churchman would place himself in a position so\nequivocal as to dignity of aspect, and so unequivocal as to the\nobligation of sitting out the discussion; and the rector had beforehand\nput a veto on any Dissenting chairman.\n\nMr. Lyon sat patiently absorbed in his thoughts, with his notes in\nminute handwriting lying before him, seeming to look at the audience,\nbut not seeing them. Every one else was contented that there should be\nan interval in which there could be a little neighborly talk.\n\nEsther was particularly happy, seated on a side-bench near her father's\nside of the tribune, with Felix close behind her, so that she could turn\nher head and talk to him. He had been very kind ever since that morning\nwhen she had called at his home, more disposed to listen indulgently to\nwhat she had to say, and less blind to her looks and movements. If he\nhad never railed at her or ignored her, she would have been less\nsensitive to the attention he gave her; but as it was, the prospect of\nseeing him seemed to light up her life, and to disperse the old\ndullness. She looked unusually charming to-day, from the very fact that\nshe was not vividly conscious of anything but of having a mind near her\nthat asked her to be something better than she actually was. The\nconsciousness of her own superiority amongst the people around her was\nsuperseded, and even a few brief weeks had given a softened expression\nto her eyes, a more feminine beseechingness and self-doubt to her\nmanners. Perhaps, however, a little new defiance was rising in place of\nthe old contempt--defiance of the Trebian views about Felix Holt.\n\n\"What a very nice-looking young woman your minister's daughter is?\" said\nMrs. Tiliot in an undertone to Mrs. Muscat, who, as she had hoped, had\nfound a seat next her quondam friend--\"quite the lady.\"\n\n\"Rather too much so, considering,\" said Mrs. Muscat. \"She's thought\nproud, and that is not pretty in a girl, even if there was anything to\nback it up. But now she seems to be encouraging that young Holt, who\nscoffs at everything, as you may judge by his appearance. She has\ndespised his betters before now; but I leave you to judge whether a\nyoung man who has taken to low ways of getting a living can pay for fine\ncambric handkerchiefs and light kid gloves.\"\n\nMrs. Muscat lowered her blonde eyelashes and swayed her neat head just\nperceptibly from side to side, with a sincere desire to be moderate in\nher expressions, notwithstanding any shock that facts might have given\nher.\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Mrs. Tiliot. \"What! that is young Holt leaning\nforward now without a cravat? I've never seen him before to notice him,\nbut I've heard Tiliot talking about him. They say he's a dangerous\ncharacter, and goes stirring up the workingmen at Sproxton. And--well,\nto be sure, such great eyes and such a great head of hair--it is enough\nto frighten one. What can she see in him? Quite below her.\"\n\n\"Yes, and brought up a governess,\" said Mrs. Muscat; \"you'd have thought\nshe'd knowed better how to choose. But the minister has let her get the\nupper hand sadly too much. It's a pity in a man of God. I don't deny\nhe's _that_.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sorry,\" said Mrs. Tiliot, \"for I meant her to give my girls\nlessons when they came from school.\"\n\nMr. Wace and Mr. Pendrell meanwhile were standing up and looking round\nat the audience, nodding to their fellow-townspeople with the affability\ndue from men in their position.\n\n\"It's time he came now,\" said Mr. Wace, looking at his watch and\ncomparing it with the schoolroom clock. \"This debating is a new-fangled\nsort of thing; but the rector would never have given in to it if there\nhadn't been good reasons. Nolan said he wouldn't come. He says this\ndebating is an atheistical sort of thing; the Atheists are very fond of\nit. Theirs is a bad book to take a leaf out of. However, we shall hear\nnothing but what's good from Mr. Sherlock. He preaches a capital\nsermon--for such a young man.\"\n\n\"Well, it was our duty to support him--not to leave him alone among the\nDissenters,\" said Mr. Pendrell. \"You see everybody hasn't felt that.\nLabron might have shown himself, if not Lukyn. I could have alleged\nbusiness myself if I had thought proper.\"\n\n\"Here he comes, I think,\" said Mr. Wace, turning round on hearing a\nmovement near the small door on a level with the platform. \"By George!\nit's Mr. Debarry. Come now, this is handsome.\"\n\nMr. Wace and Mr. Pendrell clapped their hands, and the example was\nfollowed even by most of the Dissenters. Philip was aware that he was\ndoing a popular thing, of a kind that Treby was not used to from the\nelder Debarrys; but his appearance had not been long premeditated. He\nwas driving through the town toward an engagement at some distance, but\non calling at Labron's office he had found that the affair which\ndemanded his presence had been deferred, and so had driven round to the\nFree School. Christian came in behind him.\n\nMr. Lyon was now roused from his abstraction, and, stepping from his\nslight elevation, begged Mr. Debarry to act as moderator or president on\nthe occasion.\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Philip. \"But Mr. Sherlock has not arrived,\napparently?\"\n\n\"He tarries somewhat unduly,\" said Mr. Lyon. \"Nevertheless there may be\na reason of which we know not. Shall I collect the thoughts of the\nassembly by a brief introductory address in the interval?\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Mr. Wace, who saw a limit to his powers of endurance.\n\"Mr. Sherlock is sure to be here in a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Christian,\" said Philip Debarry, who felt a slight misgiving, \"just be\nso good--but stay, I'll go myself. Excuse me, gentlemen: I'll drive\nround to Mr. Sherlock's lodgings. He may be under a little mistake as to\nthe time. Studious men are sometimes rather absent-minded. You needn't\ncome with me, Christian.\"\n\nAs Mr. Debarry went out, Rufus Lyon stepped on to the tribune again in\nrather an uneasy state of mind. A few ideas had occurred to him,\neminently fitted to engage the audience profitably, and so to wrest some\nedification out of an unforeseen delay. But his native delicacy made him\nfeel that in this assembly the Church people might fairly decline any\n\"deliverance\" on his part which exceeded the programme, and Mr. Wace's\nnegative had been energetic. But the little man suffered from imprisoned\nideas, and was as restless as a racer held in. He could not sit down\nagain, but walked backward and forward, stroking his chin, emitting his\nlow guttural interjections under the pressure of clauses and sentences\nwhich he longed to utter aloud, as he would have done in his own study.\nThere was a low buzz in the room which helped to deepen the minister's\nsense that the thoughts within him were as divine messengers unheeded or\nrejected by a trivial generation. Many of the audience were standing;\nall, except the old Churchwomen on the back seats, and a few devout\nDissenters who kept their eyes shut and gave their bodies a gentle\noscillating motion, were interested in chat.\n\n\"Your father is uneasy,\" said Felix to Esther.\n\n\"Yes; and now, I think, he is feeling for his spectacles. I hope he has\nnot left them at home: he will not be able to see anything two yards\nbefore him without them;--and it makes him so unconscious of what people\nexpect or want.\"\n\n\"I'll go and ask him whether he has them,\" said Felix, striding over the\nform in front of him, and approaching Mr. Lyon, whose face showed a\ngleam of pleasure at this relief from his abstracted isolation.\n\n\"Miss Lyon is afraid that you are at a loss for your spectacles, sir,\"\nsaid Felix.\n\n\"My dear young friend,\" said Mr. Lyon, laying his hand on Felix Holt's\nfore-arm, which was about on a level with the minister's shoulder, \"it\nis a very glorious truth, albeit made somewhat painful to me by the\ncircumstances of the present moment, that as a counterpoise to the\nbrevity of our mortal life (wherein, as I apprehend, our powers are\nbeing trained not only for the transmission of an improved heritage, as\nI have heard you insist, but also for our own entrance into a higher\ninitiation in the Divine scheme)--it is, I say, a very glorious truth,\nthat even in what are called the waste minutes of our time, like those\nof expectation, the soul may soar and range, as in some of our dreams\nwhich are brief as a broken rainbow in duration, yet seem to comprise a\nlong history of terror or joy. And again, each moment may be a beginning\nof a new spiritual energy; and our pulse would doubtless be a coarse and\nclumsy notation of the passage from that which was not to that which is,\neven in the finer processes of the material world--and how much\nmore----\"\n\nEsther was watching her father and Felix, and though she was not within\nhearing of what was being said, she guessed the actual state of the\ncase--that the enquiry about the spectacles had been unheeded, and that\nher father was losing himself and embarrassing Felix in the intricacies\nof a dissertation. There was not the stillness around her that would\nhave made a movement on her part seem conspicuous, and she was impelled\nby her anxiety to step on the tribune and walk up to her father, who\npaused a little startled.\n\n\"Pray see whether you have forgotten your spectacles, father. If so, I\nwill go home at once and look for them.\"\n\nMr. Lyon was automatically obedient to Esther, and he began immediately\nto feel in his pockets.\n\n\"How is it that Miss Jermyn is so friendly with the Dissenting parson?\"\nsaid Christian to Quorlen, the Tory printer, who was an intimate of his.\n\"Those grand Jermyns are not Dissenters surely?\"\n\n\"_What_ Miss Jermyn?\"\n\n\"Why--don't you see?--that fine girl who is talking to him.\"\n\n\"Miss Jermyn! Why, that's the little parson's daughter.\"\n\n\"His daughter!\" Christian gave a low brief whistle, which seemed a\nnatural expression of surprise that \"the rusty old ranter\" should have a\ndaughter of such distinguished appearance.\n\nMeanwhile the search for the spectacles had proved vain. \"'Tis a\ngrievous fault in me, my dear,\" said the little man, humbly; \"I become\nthereby sadly burdensome to you.\"\n\n\"I will go at once,\" said Esther, refusing to let Felix go instead of\nher. But she had scarcely stepped off the tribune when Mr. Debarry\nre-entered, and there was a commotion which made her wait. After a\nlow-toned conversation with Mr. Pendrell and Mr. Wace, Philip Debarry\nstepped on to the tribune with his hat in his hand and said, with an air\nof much concern and annoyance--\n\n\"I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that--doubtless\nowing to some accidental cause which I trust will soon be explained as\nnothing serious--Mr. Sherlock is absent from his residence and is not to\nbe found. He went out early, his landlady informs me, to refresh himself\nby a walk on this agreeable morning, as is his habit, she tells me, when\nhe has been kept up late by study; and he has not returned. Do not let\nus be too anxious. I shall cause enquiry to be made in the direction of\nhis walk. It is easy to imagine many accidents, not of a grave\ncharacter, by which he might nevertheless be absolutely detained against\nhis will. Under these circumstances, Mr. Lyon,\" continued Philip,\nturning to the minister, \"I presume that the debate must be adjourned.\"\n\n\"The debate, doubtless,\" began Mr. Lyon; but his farther speech was\ndrowned by a general rising of the Church people from their seats, many\nof them feeling that, even if the cause were lamentable, the adjournment\nwas not altogether disagreeable.\n\n\"Good gracious me!\" said Mrs. Tiliot, as she took her husband's arm, \"I\nhope the poor young man hasn't fallen into the river or broken his leg.\"\n\nBut some of the more acrid Dissenters, whose temper was not controlled\nby the habits of retail business, had begun to hiss, implying that in\ntheir interpretation the curate's absence had not depended on any injury\nto life or limb.\n\n\"He's turned tail, sure enough,\" said Mr. Muscat to the neighbor behind\nhim, lifting his eyebrows and shoulders, and laughing in a way that\nshowed that, deacon as he was, he looked at the affair in an entirely\nsecular light.\n\nBut Mrs. Muscat thought it would be nothing but right to have all the\nwaters dragged, agreeing in this with the majority of the Church ladies.\n\n\"I regret sincerely, Mr. Lyon,\" said Philip Debarry, addressing the\nminister with politeness, \"that I must say good-morning to you, with the\nsense that I have not been able at present to contribute to your\nsatisfaction as I had wished.\"\n\n\"Speak not of it in the way of apology, sir,\" said Mr. Lyon, in a tone\nof depression. \"I doubt not that you yourself have acted in good faith.\nNor will I open any door of egress to constructions such as anger often\ndeems ingenious, but which the disclosure of the simple truth may expose\nas erroneous and uncharitable fabrications. I wish you good-morning,\nsir.\"\n\nWhen the room was cleared of the Church people, Mr. Lyon wished to\nsoothe his own spirit and that of his flock by a few reflections\nintroductory to a parting prayer. But there was a general resistance to\nthis effort. The men mustered round the minister and declared their\nopinion that the whole thing was disgraceful to the Church. Some said\nthat the curate's absence had been contrived from the first. Others more\nthan hinted that it had been a folly in Mr. Lyon to set on foot any\nprocedure in common with Tories and clergymen, who, if they ever aped\ncivility to Dissenters, would never do anything but laugh at them in\ntheir sleeves. Brother Kemp urged in his heavy bass that Mr. Lyon should\nlose no time in sending an account of the affair to the _Patriot_; and\nbrother Hawkins, in his high tenor, observed that it was an occasion on\nwhich some stinging things might be said with all the extra effect of an\n_apropos_.\n\nThe position of receiving a many-voiced lecture from the members of his\nchurch was familiar to Mr. Lyon; but now he felt weary, frustrated, and\ndoubtful of his own temper. Felix, who stood by and saw that this man of\nsensitive fibre was suffering from talkers whose noisy superficiality\ncost them nothing, got exasperated. \"It seems to me, sirs,\" he burst in,\nwith his predominant voice, \"that Mr. Lyon has hitherto had the hard\npart of the business, while you of his congregation have had the easy\none. Punish the Church clergy, if you like--they can take care of\nthemselves. But don't punish your own minister. It's no business of\nmine, perhaps, except so far as fair-play is everybody's business; but\nit seems to me the time to ask Mr. Lyon to take a little rest, instead\nof setting on him like so many wasps.\"\n\nBy this speech Felix raised a displeasure which fell on the minister as\nwell as on himself; but he gained his immediate end. The talkers dropped\noff after a slight show of persistence, and Mr. Lyon quitted the field\nof no combat with a small group of his less imperious friends, to whom\nhe confided his intention of committing his argument fully to paper,\nand forwarding it to a discriminating editor.\n\n\"But regarding personalities,\" he added, \"I have not the same clear\nshowing. For, say that this young man was pusillanimous--I were but\nill-provided with arguments if I took my stand even for a moment on so\npoor an irrelevancy as that because one curate is ill furnished\ntherefore Episcopacy is false. If I held up any one to just obloquy, it\nwould be the well-designated Incumbent of this parish, who, calling\nhimself one of the Church militant, sends a young and weak-kneed\nsubstitute to take his place in the fight.\"\n\nMr. Philip Debarry did not neglect to make industrious enquiry\nconcerning the accidents which had detained the Reverend Theodore\nSherlock on his morning walk. That well-intentioned young divine was\nseen no more in Treby Magna. But the river was not dragged, for by the\nevening coach the rector received an explanatory letter. The Reverend\nTheodore's agitation had increased so much during his walk, that the\npassing coach had been a means of deliverance not to be resisted; and,\nliterally at the eleventh hour, he had hailed and mounted the cheerful\nTally-ho! and carried away his portion of the debate in his pocket.\n\nBut the rector had subsequently the satisfaction of receiving Mr.\nSherlock's painstaking production in print, with a dedication to the\nReverend Augustus Debarry, a motto from St. Chrysostom, and other\nadditions, the fruit of ripening leisure. He was \"sorry for poor\nSherlock, who wanted confidence\"; but he was convinced that for his own\npart he had taken the course which under the circumstances was the least\ncompromising to the Church. Sir Maximus, however, observed to his son\nand brother that he had been right and they had been wrong as to the\ndanger of vague, enormous expressions of gratitude to a Dissenting\npreacher, and on any differences of opinion seldom failed to remind them\nof that precedent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n    Your fellow-man?--Divide the epithet:\n    Say rather, you're the fellow, he the man.\n\n\nWhen Christian quitted the Free School with the discovery that the young\nlady whose appearance had first startled him with an indefinable\nimpression in the market-place was the daughter of the old Dissenting\npreacher who had shown so much agitated curiosity about his name, he\nfelt very much like an uninitiated chess-player, who sees that the\npieces are in a peculiar position on the board, and might open the way\nfor him to give checkmate, if he only knew how. Ever since his interview\nwith Jermyn, his mind had been occupied with the charade it offered to\nhis ingenuity. What was the real meaning of the lawyer's interest in\nhim, and in his relations with Maurice Christian Bycliffe? Here was a\nsecret; and secrets were often a source of profit, of that agreeable\nkind which involved little labor. Jermyn had hinted at profit which\nmight possibly come through him; but Christian said inwardly, with\nwell-satisfied self-esteem, that he was not so pitiable a nincompoop as\nto trust Jermyn. On the contrary, the only problem before him was to\nfind out by what combination of independent knowledge he could outwit\nJermyn, elude any purchase the attorney had on him through his past\nhistory, and get a handsome bonus, by which a somewhat shattered man of\npleasure might live well without a master. Christian, having early\nexhausted the more impulsive delights of life, had become a sober\ncalculator; and he had made up his mind that, for a man who had long ago\nrun through his own money, servitude in a great family was the best kind\nof retirement after that of a pensioner; but if a better chance offered,\na person of talent must not let it slip through his fingers. He held\nvarious ends of threads, but there was danger of pulling at them too\nimpatiently. He had not forgotten the surprise which had made him drop\nthe punch-ladle, when Mr. Crowder, talking in the steward's room, had\nsaid that a scamp named Henry Scaddon had been concerned in a lawsuit\nabout the Transome estate. Again, Jermyn was the family lawyer of the\nTransomes; he knew of the exchange of names between Scaddon and\nBycliffe; he clearly wanted to know as much as he could about Bycliffe's\nhistory. The conclusion was not remote that Bycliffe had had some claim\non the Transome property, and that a difficulty had arisen from his\nbeing confounded with Henry Scaddon. But hitherto the other incident\nwhich had been apparently connected with the interchange of names--Mr.\nLyon's demand that he should write down the name Maurice Christian,\naccompanied with the question whether that were his whole name--had had\nno visible link with the inferences arrived at through Crowder and\nJermyn.\n\nThe discovery made this morning at the Free School that Esther was the\ndaughter of the Dissenting preacher at last suggested a possible link.\nUntil then, Christian had not known why Esther's face had impressed him\nso peculiarly; but the minister's chief association for him was with\nBycliffe, and that association served as a flash to show him that\nEsther's features and expression, and still more her bearing, now she\nstood and walked, revived Bycliffe's image. Daughter? There were various\nways of being a daughter. Suppose this were a case of adoption; suppose\nBycliffe were known to be dead, or thought to be dead. \"Begad, if the\nold parson had fancied the original father was come to life again, it\nwas enough to frighten him a little. Slow and steady,\" Christian said to\nhimself; \"I'll get some talk with the old man again. He's safe enough:\none can handle him without cutting one's self. I'll tell him I knew\nBycliffe, and was his fellow-prisoner. I'll worm out the truth about\nthis daughter. Could pretty Annette have married again, and married this\nlittle scare-crow? There's no knowing what a woman will not do.\"\n\nChristian could see no distinct result for himself from his industry;\nbut if there were to be any such result, it must be reached by following\nout every clue; and to the non-legal mind there are dim possibilities in\nlaw and heirship which prevent any issue from seeming too miraculous.\n\nThe consequence of these meditations was, that Christian hung about\nTreby more than usual in his leisure time, and that on the first\nopportunity he accosted Mr. Lyon in the street with suitable civility,\nstating that since the occasion which had brought them together some\nweeks before he had often wished to renew their conversation, and, with\nMr. Lyon's permission, would now ask to do so. After being assured, as\nhe had been by Jermyn, that this courier, who had happened by some\naccident to possess the memorable locket and pocket-book, was certainly\nnot Annette's husband, and was ignorant whether Maurice Christian\nBycliffe were living or dead, the minister's mind had become easy again;\nhis habitual lack of interest in personal details rendering him\ngradually oblivious of Jermyn's precautionary statement that he was\npursuing enquiries, and that if anything of interest turned up, Mr. Lyon\nshould be made acquainted with it. Hence, when Christian addressed him,\nthe minister, taken by surprise and shaken by the recollections of\nformer anxieties, said, helplessly--\n\n\"If it is business, sir, you would perhaps do better to address yourself\nto Mr. Jermyn.\"\n\nHe could not have said anything that was a more valuable hint to\nChristian. He inferred that the minister had made a confidant of Jermyn,\nand it was needful to be wary.\n\n\"On the contrary, sir,\" he answered, \"it may be of the utmost importance\nto you that what passes between us should not be known to Mr. Jermyn.\"\n\nMr. Lyon was perplexed, and felt at once that he was no more in clear\ndaylight concerning Jermyn than concerning Christian. He dared not\nneglect the possible duty of hearing what this man had to say, and he\ninvited him to proceed to Malthouse Yard, where they could converse in\nprivate.\n\nOnce in Mr. Lyon's study, Christian opened the dialogue by saying that\nsince he was in this room before it had occurred to him that the anxiety\nhe had observed in Mr. Lyon might be owing to some acquaintance with\nMaurice Christian Bycliffe--a fellow-prisoner in France, whom he,\nChristian, had assisted in getting freed from his imprisonment, and who,\nin fact, had been the owner of the trifles which Mr. Lyon had recently\nhad in his possession and had restored. Christian hastened to say that\nhe knew nothing of Bycliffe's history since they had parted in France,\nbut that he knew of his marriage with Annette Ledru, and had been\nacquainted with Annette herself. He would be very glad to know what\nbecame of Bycliffe, if he could, for he liked him uncommonly.\n\nHere Christian paused; but Mr. Lyon only sat changing color and\ntrembling. This man's bearing and tone of mind were made repulsive to\nhim by being brought in contact with keenly-felt memories, and he could\nnot readily summon the courage to give answers or ask questions.\n\n\"May I ask if you knew my friend Bycliffe?\" said Christian, trying a\nmore direct method.\n\n\"No, sir; I never saw him.\"\n\n\"Ah! well--you have seen a very striking likeness of him. It's\nwonderful--unaccountable; but when I saw Miss Lyon at the Free School\nthe other day, I could have sworn she was Bycliffe's daughter.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" said Mr. Lyon, in his deepest tone, half rising, and holding by\nthe arms of his chair, \"these subjects touch me with too sharp a point\nfor you to be justified in thrusting them on me out of mere levity. Is\nthere any good you seek or any injury you fear in relation to them?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. We shall come to an understanding. Suppose I believed\nthat the young lady who goes by the name of Miss Lyon was the daughter\nof Bycliffe?\"\n\nMr. Lyon moved his lips silently.\n\n\"And suppose I had reason to suspect that there would be some great\nadvantage for her if the law knew who was her father?\"\n\n\"Sir!\" said Mr. Lyon, shaken out of all reticence. \"I would not conceal\nit. She believes herself to be my daughter. But I will bear all things\nrather than deprive her of a right. Nevertheless I appeal to the pity of\nany fellow-man, not to thrust himself between her and me, but to let me\ndisclose the truth to her myself.\"\n\n\"All in good time,\" said Christian. \"We must do nothing rash. Then Miss\nLyon is Annette's child?\"\n\nThe minister shivered as if the edge of a knife had been drawn across\nhis hand. But the tone of this question, by the fact that it intensified\nhis antipathy to Christian, enabled him to collect himself for what must\nbe simply the endurance of a painful operation. After a moment or two he\nsaid more coolly, \"It is true, sir. Her mother became my wife. Proceed\nwith any statement which may concern my duty.\"\n\n\"I have no more to say than this: if there's a prize that the law might\nhand over to Bycliffe's daughter, I am much mistaken if there isn't a\nlawyer who'll take precious good care to keep the law hoodwinked. And\nthat lawyer is Mat Jermyn. Why, my good sir, if you've been taking\nJermyn into your confidence, you've been setting the fox to keep off the\nweasel. It strikes me that when you were made a little anxious about\nthose articles of poor Bycliffe's, you put Jermyn on making enquiries of\nme. Eh? I think I am right?\"\n\n\"I do not deny it.\"\n\n\"Ah!--it was very well you did, for by that means I've found that he's\ngot hold of some secrets about Bycliffe which he means to stifle. Now,\nsir, if you desire any justice for your daughter--step-daughter, I\nshould say--don't so much as wink to yourself before Jermyn; and if\nyou've got any papers or things of that sort that may come in evidence,\nas these confounded rascals the lawyers call it, clutch them tight, for\nif they get into Jermyn's hands they may soon fly up the chimney. Have I\nsaid enough?\"\n\n\"I had not purposed any further communication with Mr. Jermyn, sir;\nindeed, I have nothing further to communicate. Except that one fact\nconcerning my daughter's birth, which I have erred in concealing from\nher, I neither seek disclosures nor do I tremble before them.\"\n\n\"Then I have your word that you will be silent about this conversation\nbetween us? It is for your daughter's interest, mind.\"\n\n\"Sir, I shall be silent,\" said Mr. Lyon, with cold gravity. \"Unless,\"\nhe added, with an acumen as to possibilities rather disturbing to\nChristian's confident contempt for the old man--\"unless I were called\nupon by some tribunal to declare the whole truth in this relation; in\nwhich case I should submit myself to that authority of investigation\nwhich is a requisite of social order.\"\n\nChristian departed, feeling satisfied that he had got the utmost to be\nobtained at present out of the Dissenting preacher, whom he had not\ndared to question more closely. He must look out for chance lights, and\nperhaps, too, he might catch a stray hint by stirring the sediment of\nMr. Crowder's memory. But he must not venture on enquiries that might be\nnoticed.\n\nWhen Mr. Lyon was alone he paced up and down among his books, and\nthought aloud, in order to relieve himself after the constraint of this\ninterview. \"I will not wait for the urgency of necessity,\" he said more\nthan once. \"I will tell the child without compulsion. And then I shall\nfear nothing. And an unwonted spirit of tenderness has filled her of\nlate. She will forgive me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n    Consideration like an angel came\n    And whipped the offending Adam out of her;\n    Leaving her body as a paradise\n    To envelope and contain celestial spirits.\n\n                                       --SHAKESPEARE: _Henry V_.\n\n\nThe next morning, after much prayer for the needful strength and wisdom,\nMr. Lyon came down stairs with the resolution that another day should\nnot pass without the fulfillment of the task he had laid on himself: but\nwhat hour he should choose for this solemn disclosure to Esther must\ndepend on their mutual occupations. Perhaps he must defer it till they\nsat up alone together, after Lyddy was gone to bed. But at breakfast\nEsther said--\n\n\"To-day is a holiday, father. My pupils are all going to Duffield to see\nthe wild beasts. What have you got to do to-day? Come, you are eating no\nbreakfast. Oh, Lyddy, Lyddy, the eggs are hard again. I wish you would\nnot read Alleyne's 'Alarm' before breakfast; it makes you cry and forget\nthe eggs.\"\n\n\"They _are_ hard, and that's the truth; but there's hearts as are\nharder, Miss Esther,\" said Lyddy.\n\n\"I think not,\" said Esther. \"This is leathery enough for the heart of\nthe most obdurate Jew. Pray give it little Zachary for a football.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, don't you be so light, miss. We may all be dead before\nnight.\"\n\n\"You speak out of season, my good Lyddy,\" said Mr. Lyon, wearily;\n\"depart into the kitchen.\"\n\n\"What have you got to do to-day, father?\" persisted Esther. \"I have a\nholiday.\"\n\nMr. Lyon felt as if this were a fresh summons not to delay. \"I have\nsomething of great moment to do, my dear; and since you are not\notherwise demanded, I will ask you to come and sit with me up-stairs.\"\n\nEsther wondered what there could be on her father's mind more pressing\nthan his morning studies.\n\nSoon she knew. Motionless, but mentally stirred as she had never been\nbefore, Esther listened to her mother's story, and to the outpouring of\nher step-father's long-pent-up experience. The rays of the morning sun\nwhich fell athwart the books, the sense of the beginning day had\ndeepened the solemnity more than night would have done. All knowledge\nwhich alters our lives penetrates us more when it comes in the early\nmorning: the day that has to be travelled with something new and perhaps\nforever sad in its light, is an image of the life that spreads beyond.\nBut at night the time of rest is near.\n\nMr. Lyon regarded his narrative as a confession--as a revelation to this\nbeloved child of his own miserable weakness and error. But to her it\nseemed a revelation of another sort: her mind seemed suddenly enlarged\nby a vision of passion and struggle, of delight and renunciation, in the\nlot of beings who had hitherto been a dull enigma to her. And in the act\nof unfolding to her that he was not her real father, but had only\nstriven to cherish her as a father, had only longed to be loved as a\nfather, the odd, way-worn, unworldly man became the object of a new\nsympathy in which Esther exulted. Perhaps this knowledge would have been\nless powerful within her, but for the mental preparation that had come\nduring the last two months from her acquaintance with Felix Holt, which\nhad taught her to doubt the infallibility of her own standard, and\nraised a presentiment of moral depths that were hidden from her.\n\nEsther had taken her place opposite to her father, and had not moved\neven her clasped hands while he was speaking. But after the long\noutpouring in which he seemed to lose the sense of everything but the\nmemories he was giving utterance to, he paused a little while, and then\nsaid timidly--\n\n\"This is a late retrieval of a long error, Esther. I make not excuses\nfor myself, for we ought to strive that our affections be rooted in the\ntruth. Nevertheless you----\"\n\nEsther had risen, and had glided on to the wooden stool on a level with\nher father's chair, where he was accustomed to lay books. She wanted to\nspeak, but the flood-gates could not be opened for words alone. She\nthrew her arms round the old man's neck and sobbed out with a passionate\ncry, \"Father, father! forgive me if I have not loved you enough. I\nwill--I will!\"\n\nThe old man's little delicate frame was shaken by a surprise and joy\nthat was almost painful in their intensity. He had been going to ask\nforgiveness of her who asked it for herself. In that moment of supreme\ncomplex emotion one ray of the minister's joy was the thought, \"Surely\nthe work of grace is begun in her--surely here is a heart that the Lord\nhath touched.\"\n\nThey sat so, enclasped in silence, while Esther relieved her full heart.\nWhen she raised her head, she sat quite still for a minute or two\nlooking fixedly before her, and keeping one little hand in the\nminister's. Presently she looked at him and said--\n\n\"Then you lived like a workingman, father; you were very, very poor. Yet\nmy mother had been used to luxury, She was well born--she was a lady?\"\n\n\"It is true, my dear; it was a poor life that I could give her.\"\n\nMr. Lyon answered in utter dimness as to the course Esther's mind was\ntaking. He had anticipated before his disclosure, from his long-standing\ndiscernment of tendencies in her which were often the cause of silent\ngrief to him, that the discovery likely to have the keenest interest for\nher would be that her parents had a higher rank than that of the poor\nDissenting preacher; but she had shown that other and better\nsensibilities were predominant. He rebuked himself now for a hasty and\nshallow judgment concerning the child's inner life, and waited for new\nclearness.\n\n\"But that must be the best life, father,\" said Esther, suddenly rising,\nwith a flush across her paleness, and standing with her head thrown a\nlittle backward, as if some illumination had given her a new decision.\n\"That must be the best life.\"\n\n\"What life, my dear child?\"\n\n\"Why, that where one bears and does everything because of some great and\nstrong feeling--so that this and that in one's circumstances don't\nsignify.\"\n\n\"Yea, verily; but the feeling that should be thus supreme is devotedness\nto the Divine Will.\"\n\nEsther did not speak; her father's words did not fit on to the\nimpressions wrought in her by what he had told her. She sat down again,\nand said, more quietly--\n\n\"Mamma did not speak much of my--first father?\"\n\n\"Not much, dear. She said he was beautiful to the eye, and good and\ngenerous; and that his family was of those who had been long privileged\namong their fellows. But now I will deliver to you the letters, which,\ntogether with the ring and locket, are the only visible memorials she\nretained of him.\"\n\nMr. Lyon reached and delivered to Esther the box containing the relics.\n\"Take them, and examine them in privacy, my dear. And that I may no more\nerr by concealment, I will tell you some late occurrences that bear on\nthese memorials, though to my present apprehension doubtfully and\nconfusedly.\"\n\nHe then narrated to Esther all that had passed between himself and\nChristian. The possibility--to which Mr. Lyon's alarms had pointed--that\nher real father might still be living, was a new shock. She could not\nspeak about it to her present father, but it was registered in silence\nas a painful addition to the uncertainties which she suddenly saw\nhanging over her life.\n\n\"I have little confidence in this man's allegations,\" Mr. Lyon ended. \"I\nconfess his presence and speech are to me as the jarring of metal. He\nbears the stamp of one who has never conceived aught of more sanctity\nthan the lust of the eye and the pride of life. He hints at some\npossible inheritance for you, and denounces mysteriously the devices of\nMr. Jermyn. All this may or may not have a true foundation. But it is\nnot my part to move in this matter save on a clear showing.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, father,\" said Esther, eagerly. A little while ago, these\nproblematic prospects might have set her dreaming pleasantly; but now,\nfor some reasons that she could not have put distinctly into words, they\naffected her with dread.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n    To hear with eyes is part of love's rare wit.\n\n                                        --SHAKESPEARE: _Sonnets_.\n\n                        Custom calls me to't;\n    What custom wills, in all things should we do't.\n    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,\n    And mountainous error be too highly heaped\n    For truth to over-peer.--_Coriolanus._\n\n\nIn the afternoon Mr. Lyon went out to see the sick amongst his flock,\nand Esther, who had been passing the morning in dwelling on the memories\nand the few remaining relics of her parents, was left alone in the\nparlor amidst the lingering odors of the early dinner, not easily got\nrid of in that small house. Rich people, who know nothing of these\nvulgar details, can hardly imagine their significance in the history of\nmultitudes of human lives in which the sensibilities are never adjusted\nto the external conditions. Esther always felt so much discomfort from\nthose odors that she usually seized any possibility of escaping from\nthem, and to-day they oppressed her the more because she was weary with\nlong-continued agitation. Why did she not put on her bonnet as usual and\nget out into the open air? It was one of those pleasant November\nafternoons--pleasant in the wide country--when the sunshine is on the\nclinging brown leaves of the young oaks, and the last yellow leaves of\nthe elms flutter down in the fresh but not eager breeze. But Esther sat\nstill on the sofa--pale and with reddened eyelids, her curls all pushed\nback carelessly, and her elbow resting on the ridgy black horsehair,\nwhich usually almost set her teeth on edge if she pressed it even\nthrough her sleeve--while her eyes rested blankly on the dull street.\nLyddy had said, \"Miss, you look sadly; if you can't take a walk, go and\nlie down.\" She had never seen the curls in such disorder, and she\nreflected that there had been a death from typhus recently. But the\nobstinate Miss only shook her head.\n\nEsther was waiting for the sake of--not a probability, but--a mere\npossibility, which made the brothy odors endurable. Apparently, in less\nthan half an hour, the possibility came to pass, for she changed her\nattitude, almost started from her seat, sat down again, and listened\neagerly. If Lyddy should send him away, could she herself rush out and\ncall him back? Why not? Such things were permissible where it was\nunderstood, from the necessity of the case, that there was only\nfriendship. But Lyddy opened the door and said, \"Here's Mr. Holt, Miss,\nwants to know if you'll give him leave to come in. I told him you was\nsadly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Lyddy, beg him to come in.\"\n\n\"I should not have persevered,\" said Felix, as they shook hands, \"only I\nknow Lyddy's dismal way. But you do look ill,\" he went on, as he seated\nhimself at the other end of the sofa. \"Or rather--for that's a false way\nof putting it--you look as if you had been very much distressed. Do you\nmind about my taking notice of it?\"\n\nHe spoke very kindly, and looked at her more persistently than he had\never done before, when her hair was perfect.\n\n\"You are quite right. I am not at all ill. But I have been very much\nagitated this morning. My father has been telling me things I never\nheard before about my mother, and giving me things that belonged to her.\nShe died when I was a very little creature.\"\n\n\"Then it is no new pain or trouble for you and Mr. Lyon? I could not\nhelp being anxious to know that.\"\n\nEsther passed her hand over her brow before she answered. \"I hardly know\nwhether it is pain, or something better than pleasure. It has made me\nsee things I was blind to before--depths in my father's nature.\"\n\nAs she said this, she looked at Felix, and their eyes met very gravely.\n\n\"It is such a beautiful day,\" he said, \"it would do you good to go into\nthe air. Let me take you along the river toward Little Treby, will you?\"\n\n\"I will put my bonnet on,\" said Esther, unhesitatingly, though they had\nnever walked out together before.\n\nIt is true that to get into the fields they had to pass through the\nstreet; and when Esther saw some acquaintances, she reflected that her\nwalking alone with Felix might be a subject of remark--all the more\nbecause of his cap, patched boots, no cravat, and thick stick. Esther\nwas a little amazed herself at what she had come to. So our lives glide\non: the river ends we don't know where, and the sea begins, and there is\nno more jumping ashore.\n\nWhen they were in the streets Esther hardly spoke. Felix talked with his\nusual readiness, as easily as if he were not doing it solely to divert\nher thoughts, first about Job Tudge's delicate chest, and the\nprobability that the little white-faced monkey would not live long; and\nthen about a miserable beginning of a night-school, which was all he\ncould get together at Sproxton, and the dismalness of that hamlet, which\nwas a sort of lip to the coalpit on one side and the \"public\" on the\nother--and yet a paradise compared with the wynds of Glasgow, where\nthere was little more than a chink of daylight to show the hatred in\nwomen's faces.\n\nBut soon they got into the fields, where there was a right of way toward\nLittle Treby, now following the course of the river, now crossing toward\na lane, and now turning into a cart-track through a plantation.\n\n\"Here we are!\" said Felix, when they had crossed the wooden bridge, and\nwere treading on the slanting shadows made by the elm-trunks. \"I think\nthis is delicious. I never feel less unhappy than in these late autumn\nafternoons when they are sunny.\"\n\n\"Less unhappy! There now!\" said Esther, smiling at him with some of her\nhabitual sauciness, \"I have caught you in self-contradiction. I have\nheard you quite furious against puling, melancholy people. If I had said\nwhat you have just said, you would have given me a long lecture, and\ntold me to go home and interest myself in the reason of the\nrule-of-three.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Felix, beating the weeds, according to the foible of\nour common humanity when it has a stick in its hand. \"But I don't think\nmyself a fine fellow because I'm melancholy. I don't measure my force by\nthe negations in me, and think my soul must be a mighty one because it\nis more given to idle suffering than to beneficent activity. That's what\nyour favorite gentlemen do, of the Byronic-bilious style.\"\n\n\"I don't admit that those are my favorite gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I've heard you defend them--gentlemen like your R\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9s, who have no\nparticular talent for the finite, but a general sense that the infinite\nis the right thing for them. They might as well boast of nausea as a\nproof of a strong inside.\"\n\n\"Stop, stop! You run on in that way to get out of my reach. I convicted\nyou of confessing that you are melancholy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Felix, thrusting his left hand into his pocket, with a\nshrug; \"as I could confess to a great many other things I'm not proud\nof. The fact is, there are not many easy lots to be drawn in the world\nat present; and such as they are I am not envious of them. I don't say\nlife is not worth having to a man who has some sparks of sense and\nfeeling and bravery in him. And the finest fellow of all would be the\none who could be glad to have lived because the world was chiefly\nmiserable, and his life had come to help some one who needed it. He\nwould be the man who had the most powers and the fewest selfish wants.\nBut I'm not up to the level of what I see to be best. I'm often a hungry\ndiscontented fellow.\"\n\n\"Why have you made your life so hard then?\" said Esther, rather\nfrightened as she asked the question. \"It seems to me you have tried to\nfind just the most difficult task.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Felix, with curt decision. \"My course was a very\nsimple one. It was pointed out to me by conditions that I saw as clearly\nas I see the bars of this stile. It's a difficult stile too,\" added\nFelix, striding over. \"Shall I help you, or will you be left to\nyourself?\"\n\n\"I can do without help, thank you.\"\n\n\"It was simple enough,\" continued Felix, as they walked on. \"If I meant\nto put a stop to the sale of those drugs, I must keep my mother, and of\ncourse at her age she would not leave the place she had been used to.\nAnd I had made up my mind against what they call genteel business.\"\n\n\"But suppose every one did as you do? Please to forgive me for saying\nso; but I cannot see why you could not have lived as honorably with some\nemployment that presupposes education and refinement.\"\n\n\"Because you can't see my history or my nature,\" said Felix, bluntly. \"I\nhave to determine for myself, and not for other men. I don't blame them,\nor think I am better than they; their circumstances are different. I\nwould never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden\nof the world; but I do choose to withdraw myself from the push and the\nscramble for money and position. Any man is at liberty to call me a\nfool, and say that mankind are benefited by the push and the scramble in\nthe long-run. But I care for the people who live now and will not be\nliving when the long-run comes. As it is, I prefer going shares with the\nunlucky.\"\n\nEsther did not speak, and there was silence between them for a minute or\ntwo, till they passed through a gate into a plantation where there was\nno large timber, but only thin-stemmed trees and underwood, so that the\nsunlight fell on the mossy spaces which lay open here and there.\n\n\"See how beautiful those stooping birch-stems are with the light on\nthem!\" said Felix. \"Here is an old felled trunk they have not thought\nworth carrying away. Shall we sit down a little while?\"\n\n\"Yes; the mossy ground with the dry leaves sprinkled over it is\ndelightful to one's feet.\" Esther sat down and took off her bonnet, that\nthe light breeze might fall on her head. Felix, too, threw down his cap\nand stick, lying on the ground with his back against the felled trunk.\n\n\"I wish I felt more as you do,\" she said, looking at the point of her\nfoot, which was playing with a tuft of moss. \"I can't help caring very\nmuch what happens to me. And you seem to care so little about yourself.\"\n\n\"You are thoroughly mistaken,\" said Felix. \"It is just because I'm a\nvery ambitious fellow, with very hungry passions, wanting a great deal\nto satisfy me, that I have chosen to give up what people call worldly\ngood. At least that has been one determining reason. It all depends on\nwhat a man gets into his consciousness--what life thrusts into his mind,\nso that it becomes present to him as remorse is present to the guilty,\nor a mechanical problem to an inventive genius. There are two things\nI've got present in that way: one of them is the picture of what I\nshould hate to be. I'm determined never to go about making my face\nsimpering or solemn, and telling professional lies for profit; or to get\ntangled in affairs where I must wink at dishonesty and pocket the\nproceeds, and justify that knavery as part of a system that I can't\nalter. If I once went into that sort of struggle for success I should\nwant to win--I should defend the wrong that I had once identified myself\nwith. I should become everything that I see now beforehand to be\ndetestable. And what's more, I should do this, as men are doing it every\nday, for a ridiculously small prize--perhaps for none at all--perhaps\nfor the sake of two parlors, a rank eligible for the churchwardenship, a\ndiscontented wife, and several unhopeful children.\"\n\nEsther felt a terrible pressure on her heart--the certainty of her\nremoteness from Felix--the sense that she was utterly trivial to him.\n\n\"The other thing that's got into my mind like a splinter,\" said Felix,\nafter a pause, \"is the life of the miserable--the spawning life of vice\nand hunger. I'll never be one of the sleek dogs. The old Catholics are\nright, with their higher rule and their lower. Some are called to\nsubject themselves to a harder discipline, and renounce things\nvoluntarily which are lawful for others. It is the old word--'necessity'\nis laid upon me.\n\n\"It seems to me you are stricter than my father is.\"\n\n\"No; I quarrel with no delight that is not base or cruel, but one must\nsometimes accommodate one's self to a small share. That is the lot of\nthe majority. I would wish the minority joy, only they don't want my\nwishes.\"\n\nAgain there was silence. Esther's cheeks were hot in spite of the breeze\nthat sent her hair floating backward. She felt an inward strain, a\ndemand on her to see things in a light that was not easy or soothing.\nWhen Felix had asked her to walk he seemed so kind, so alive to what\nmight be her feelings, that she had thought herself nearer to him than\nshe had ever been before; but since they had come out he had appeared to\nforget all that. And yet she was conscious that this impatience of hers\nwas very petty. Battling in this way with her own little impulses, and\nlooking at the birch-stems opposite till her gaze was too wide for her\nto see anything distinctly, she was unaware how long they had remained\nwithout speaking. She did not know that Felix had changed his attitude a\nlittle, and was resting his elbow on the tree-trunk, while he supported\nhis head, which was turned toward her. Suddenly he said, in a lower tone\nthan was habitual to him:\n\n\"You are very beautiful.\"\n\nShe started and looked round at him, to see whether his face would give\nsome help to the interpretation of this novel speech. He was looking up\nat her quite calmly, very much as a reverential Protestant might look at\na picture of the Virgin, with a devoutness suggested by the type rather\nthan by the image. Esther's vanity was not in the least gratified: she\nfelt that, somehow or other, Felix was going to reproach her.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he went on, still looking at her, \"whether the subtle\nmeasuring of forces will ever come to measuring the force there would be\nin one beautiful woman whose mind was as noble as her face was\nbeautiful--who made a man's passion for her rush in one current with all\nthe great aims of his life.\"\n\nEsther's eyes got hot and smarting. It was no use trying to be\ndignified. She had turned away her head, and now said, rather bitterly,\n\"It is difficult for a woman ever to try to be anything good when she is\nnot believed in--when it is always supposed that she must be\ncontemptible.\"\n\n\"No, dear Esther\"--it was the first time Felix had been prompted to call\nher by her Christian name, and as he did so he laid his large hand on\nher two little hands, which were clasped on her knees. \"You don't\nbelieve that I think you contemptible. When I first saw you----\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Esther, interrupting him impetuously, but still\nlooking away. \"You mean you did think me contemptible then. But it was\nvery narrow of you to judge me in that way, when my life had been so\ndifferent from yours. I have great faults. I know I am selfish, and\nthink too much of my own small tastes and too little of what affects\nothers. But I am not stupid. I am not unfeeling. I can see what is\nbetter.\"\n\n\"But I have not done you injustice since I knew more of you,\" said\nFelix, gently.\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" said Esther, turning and smiling at him through her\ntears. \"You talk to me like an angry pedagogue. Were _you_ always wise?\nRemember the time when you were foolish or naughty.\"\n\n\"That is not far off,\" said Felix, curtly, taking away his hand, and\nclasping it with the other at the back of his head. The talk, which\nseemed to be introducing a mutual understanding, such as had not existed\nbefore, seemed to have undergone some check.\n\n\"Shall we get up and walk back now?\" said Esther, after a few moments.\n\n\"No,\" said Felix, entreatingly. \"Don't move yet. I dare say we shall\nnever walk together or sit here again.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I am a man who am warned by visions. Those old stories of\nvisions and dreams guiding men have their truth; we are saved by making\nthe future present to ourselves.\"\n\n\"I wish I could get visions, then,\" said Esther, smiling at him, with an\neffort of playfulness, in resistance to something vaguely mournful\nwithin her.\n\n\"That is what I want,\" said Felix, looking at her very earnestly. \"Don't\nturn your head. Do look at me, and then I shall know if I may go on\nspeaking. I do believe in you; but I want you to have such a vision of\nthe future that you may never lose your best self. Some charm or other\nmay be flung about you--some of your attar-of-rose fascinations--and\nnothing but a good strong terrible vision will save you. And if it did\nsave you, you might be that woman I was thinking of a little while ago\nwhen I looked at your face: the woman whose beauty makes a great task\neasier to men instead of turning them away from it. I am not likely to\nsee such fine issues; but they may come where a woman's spirit is finely\ntouched. I should like to be sure they would come to you.\"\n\n\"Why are you not likely to know what becomes of me?\" said Esther,\nturning away her eyes in spite of his command. \"Why should you not\nalways be my father's friend and mine?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall go away as soon as I can to some large town,\" said Felix,\nin his more usual tone--\"some ugly, wicked, miserable place. I want to\nbe a demagogue of a new sort; an honest one, if possible, who will tell\nthe people they are blind and foolish, and neither flatter them nor\nfatten on them. I have my heritage--an order I belong to. I have the\nblood of a line of handicraftsmen in my veins, and I want to stand up\nfor the lot of the handicraftsman as a good lot, in which a man may be\nbetter trained to all the best functions of his nature than if he\nbelonged to the grimacing set who have visiting-cards, and are proud to\nbe thought richer than their neighbors.\"\n\n\"Would nothing ever make it seem right to you to change your mind?\" said\nEsther (she had rapidly woven some possibilities out of the new\nuncertainties in her own lot, though she would not for the world have\nhad Felix know of her weaving). \"Suppose, by some means or other, a\nfortune might come to you honorably--by marriage, or in any other\nunexpected way--would you see no change in your course?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Felix, peremptorily; \"I will never be rich. I don't count\nthat as any peculiar virtue. Some men do well to accept riches, but that\nis not my inward vocation: I have no fellow-feeling with the rich as a\nclass; the habits of their lives are odious to me. Thousands of men have\nwedded poverty because they expect to go to heaven for it; I don't\nexpect to go to heaven for it, but I wed it because it enables me to do\nwhat I most want to do on earth. Whatever the hopes for the world may\nbe--whether great or small--I am a man of this generation; I will try to\nmake life less bitter for a few within my reach. It is held reasonable\nenough to toil for the fortunes of a family, though it may turn to\nimbecility in the third generation. I choose a family with more chances\nin it.\"\n\nEsther looked before her dreamily till she said, \"That seems a hard lot;\nyet it is a great one.\" She rose to walk back.\n\n\"Then you don't think I'm a fool,\" said Felix, loudly, starting to his\nfeet, and then stooping to gather up his cap and stick.\n\n\"Of course you suspected me of that stupidity.\"\n\n\"Well--women, unless they are Saint Theresas or Elizabeth Frys,\ngenerally think this sort of thing madness, unless when they read of it\nin the Bible.\"\n\n\"A woman can hardly ever choose in that way; she is dependent on what\nhappens to her. She must take meaner things, because only meaner things\nare within her reach.\"\n\n\"Why, can you imagine yourself choosing hardship as the better lot?\"\nsaid Felix, looking at her with a sudden question in his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" she said, flushing over neck and brow.\n\nTheir words were charged with a meaning dependent entirely on the secret\nconsciousness of each. Nothing had been said which was necessarily\npersonal. They walked a few yards along the road by which they had come,\nwithout further speech, till Felix said gently, \"Take my arm.\" She took\nit, and they walked home so, entirely without conversation. Felix was\nstruggling as a firm man struggles with a temptation, seeing beyond it\nand disbelieving its lying promise. Esther was struggling as a woman\nstruggles with the yearning for some expression of love, and with\nvexation under that subjection to a yearning which is not likely to be\nsatisfied. Each was conscious of a silence which each was unable to\nbreak, till they entered Malthouse Lane, and were within a few yards of\nthe minister's door.\n\n\"It is getting dusk,\" Felix then said; \"will Mr. Lyon be anxious about\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, I think not. Lyddy would tell him that I went out with you, and\nthat you carried a large stick,\" said Esther, with a light laugh.\n\nFelix went in with Esther to take tea, but the conversation was entirely\nbetween him and Mr. Lyon about the tricks of canvassing, the foolish\npersonality of the placards, and the probabilities of Transome's return,\nas to which Felix declared himself to have become indifferent. This\nscepticism made the minister uneasy: he had great belief in the old\npolitical watchwords, had preached that universal suffrage and no ballot\nwere agreeable to the will of God, and liked to believe that a visible\n\"instrument\" was forthcoming in the Radical candidate who had pronounced\nemphatically against Whig finality. Felix, being in a perverse mood,\ncontended that universal suffrage would be equally agreeable to the\ndevil; that he would change his politics a little, have a larger\ntraffic, and see himself more fully represented in Parliament.\n\n\"Nay, my friend,\" said the minister, \"you are again sporting with\nparadox; for you will not deny that you glory in the name of Radical, or\nRoot-and-branch man, as they said in the great times when Nonconformity\nwas in its giant youth.\"\n\n\"A Radical--yes; but I want to go to some roots a good deal lower down\nthan the franchise.\"\n\n\"Truly there is a work within which cannot be dispensed with; but it is\nour preliminary work to free men from the stifled life of political\nnullity, and bring them into what Milton calls 'the liberal air,'\nwherein alone can be wrought the final triumphs of the Spirit.\"\n\n\"With all my heart. But while Caliban is Caliban, though you multiply\nhim by a million, he'll worship every Trinculo that carries a bottle. I\nforget, though--you don't read Shakespeare, Mr. Lyon.\"\n\n\"I am bound to confess that I have so far looked into a volume of\nEsther's as to conceive your meaning; but the fantasies therein were so\nlittle to be reconciled with a steady contemplation of that divine\neconomy which is hidden from sense and revealed to faith, that I forbore\nthe reading, as likely to perturb my ministrations.\"\n\nEsther sat by in unusual silence. The conviction that Felix willed her\nexclusion from his life was making it plain that something more than\nfriendship between them was not so thoroughly out of the question as she\nhad always inwardly asserted. In her pain that his choice lay aloof from\nher, she was compelled frankly to admit to herself the longing that it\nhad been otherwise, and that he had entreated her to share his difficult\nlife. He was like no one else to her: he had seemed to bring at once a\nlaw, and the love that gave strength to obey the law. Yet the next\nmoment, stung by his independence of her, she denied that she loved him;\nshe had only longed for a moral support under the negations of her life.\nIf she were not to have that support, all effort seemed useless.\n\nEsther had been so long used to hear the formulas of her father's belief\nwithout feeling or understanding them, that they had lost all power to\ntouch her. The first religious experience of her life--the first\nself-questioning, the first voluntary subjection, the first longing to\nacquire the strength of greater motives and obey the more strenuous\nrule--had come to her through Felix Holt. No wonder that she felt as if\nthe loss of him were inevitable backsliding.\n\nBut was it certain that she should lose him? She did not believe that he\nwas really indifferent to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n    _Titus._  But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?\n\n    _Clown._  Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter:\n              I never drank with him in all my life.\n\n                                                --_Titus Andronicus_\n\n\nThe multiplication of uncomplimentary placards noticed by Mr. Lyon and\nFelix Holt was one of several signs that the days of nomination and\nelection were approaching. The presence of the Revising Barrister in\nTreby was not only an opportunity for all persons not otherwise busy to\nshow their zeal for the purification of the voting-lists, but also to\nreconcile private ease and public duty by standing about the streets and\nlounging at doors.\n\nIt was no light business for Trebians to form an opinion; the mere fact\nof a public functionary with an unfamiliar title was enough to give\nthem pause, as a premise that was not to be quickly started from. To Mr.\nPink, the saddler, for example, until some distinct injury or benefit\nhad accrued to him, the existence of the Revising Barrister was like the\nexistence of the young giraffe which Wombwell had lately brought into\nthose parts--it was to be contemplated, and not criticised. Mr. Pink\nprofessed a deep-dyed Toryism; but he regarded all fault-finding as\nRadical and somewhat impious, as disturbing to trade, and likely to\noffend the gentry, or the servants through whom their harness was\nordered: there was a Nemesis in things which made objection unsafe, and\neven the Reform Bill was a sort of electric eel which a thriving\ntradesman had better leave alone. It was only the \"Papists\" who lived\nfar enough off to be spoken of uncivilly.\n\nBut Mr. Pink was fond of news, which he collected and retailed with\nperfect impartiality, noting facts and rejecting comments. Hence he was\nwell pleased to have his shop so constant a place of resort for\nloungers, that to many Trebians there was a strong association between\nthe pleasures of gossip and the smell of leather. He had the\nsatisfaction of chalking and cutting, and of keeping his journeymen\nclose at work, at the very time that he learned from his visitors who\nwere those whose votes had been called in question before His Honor, how\nLawyer Jermyn had been too much for Lawyer Labron about Todd's cottages,\nand how, in the opinion of some townsmen, this looking into the value of\npeople's property, and swearing it down below a certain sum, was a nasty\ninquisitorial kind of thing; while others observed that being nice to a\nfew pounds was all nonsense--they should put the figure high enough, and\nthen never mind if a voter's qualification was thereabouts. But, said\nMr. Sims, the auctioneer, everything was done for the sake of the\nlawyers. Mr. Pink suggested impartially that lawyers must live; but Mr.\nSims, having a ready auctioneering wit, did not see that so many of them\nneed live, or that babies were born lawyers. Mr. Pink felt that this\nspeculation was complicated by the ordering of side-saddles for lawyers'\ndaughters, and, returning to the firm ground of fact, stated that it was\ngetting dusk.\n\nThe dusk seemed deepened the next moment by a tall figure obstructing\nthe doorway, at sight of whom Mr. Pink rubbed his hands and smiled and\nbowed more than once, with evident solicitude to show honor where honor\nwas due, while he said:\n\n\"Mr. Christian, sir, how do you do, sir?\"\n\nChristian answered with the condescending familiarity of a superior.\n\"Very badly, I can tell you, with these confounded braces that you were\nto make such a fine job of. See, old fellow, they've burst out again.\"\n\n\"Very sorry, sir. Can you leave them with me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I'll leave them. What's the news, eh?\" said Christian, half\nseating himself on a high stool, and beating his boot with a hand-whip.\n\n\"Well, sir, we look to you to tell us that,\" said Mr. Pink, with a\nknowing smile. \"You're at headquarters--eh, sir? That was what I said to\nMr. Scales the other day. He came up for some straps, Mr. Scales did,\nand he asked that question in pretty near the same terms that you've\ndone, sir, and I answered him, as I may say, ditto. Not meaning any\ndisrespect to you, sir, but a way of speaking.\"\n\n\"Come, that's gammon, Pink,\" said Christian. \"You know everything. You\ncan tell me if you will, who is the fellow employed to paste up\nTransome's handbills?\"\n\n\"What do _you_ say, Mr. Sims?\" said Pink, looking at the auctioneer.\n\n\"Why, you know and I know well enough. It's Tommy Trounsem--an old,\ncrippling, half-mad fellow. Most people know Tommy. I've employed him\nmyself for charity.\"\n\n\"Where shall I find him?\" said Christian.\n\n\"At the Cross-Keys, in Pollard's End, most likely,\" said Mr. Sims. \"I\ndon't know where he puts himself when he isn't at the public.\"\n\n\"He was a stoutish fellow fifteen year ago, when he carried pots,\" said\nMr. Pink.\n\n\"Ay, and has snared many a hare in his time,\" said Mr. Sims. \"But he was\nalways a little cracked. Lord bless you! he used to swear he had a right\nto the Transome estate.\"\n\n\"Why, what put that notion into his head?\" said Christian, who had\nlearned more than he expected.\n\n\"The lawing, sir--nothing but the lawing about the estate. There was a\ndeal of it twenty year ago,\" said Mr. Pink. \"Tommy happened to turn up\nhereabout at that time; a big, lungeous fellow, who would speak\ndisrespectfully of hanybody.\"\n\n\"Oh, he meant no harm,\" said Mr. Sims. \"He was fond of a drop to drink,\nand not quite right in the upper story, and he could hear no difference\nbetween Trounsem and Transome. It's an odd way of speaking they have in\nthat part where he was born--a little north'ard. You'll hear it in his\ntongue now, if you talk to him.\"\n\n\"At the Cross-Keys I shall find him, eh?\" said Christian, getting off\nhis stool. \"Good-day, Pink--good-day.\"\n\nChristian went straight from the saddler's to Quorlen's, the Tory\nprinter's, with whom he had contrived a political spree. Quorlen was a\nnew man in Treby, who had so reduced the trade of Dow, the old\nhereditary printer, that Dow had lapsed to Whiggery and Radicalism and\nopinions in general, so far as they were contented to express themselves\nin a small stock of types. Quorlen had brought his Duffield wit with\nhim, and insisted that religion and joking were the handmaids of\npolitics; on which principle he and Christian undertook the joking, and\nleft the religion to the rector. The joke at present in question was a\npractical one. Christian, turning into the shop, merely said, \"I've\nfound him out--give me the placards\"; and, tucking a thickish flat\nbundle, wrapped in a black glazed cotton bag, under his arm, walked out\ninto the dusk again.\n\n\"Suppose now,\" he said to himself, as he strode along--\"suppose there\nshould be some secret to be got out of this old scamp, or some notion\nthat's as good as a secret to those who know how to use it? That would\nbe virtue rewarded. But I'm afraid the old tosspot is not likely to be\ngood for much. There's truth in wine, and there may be some in gin and\nmuddy beer; but whether it's truth worth my knowing, is another\nquestion. I've got plenty of truth, but never any that was worth a\nsixpence to me.\"\n\nThe Cross-Keys was a very old-fashioned \"public\"; its bar was a big\nrambling kitchen, with an undulating brick floor; the small-paned\nwindows threw an interesting obscurity over the far-off dresser,\ngarnished with pewter and tin, and with large dishes that seemed to\nspeak of better times; the two settles were half pushed under the\nwide-mouthed chimney; and the grate with its brick hobs, massive iron\ncrane, and various pothooks, suggested a generous plenty possibly\nexistent in all moods and tenses except the indicative present. One way\nof getting an idea of our fellow-countrymen's miseries is to go and look\nat their pleasures. The Cross-Keys had a fungous-featured landlord and a\nyellow sickly landlady, with a large white kerchief bound round her cap,\nas if her head had recently required surgery; it had doctored ale, an\nodor of bad tobacco, and remarkably strong cheese. It was not what\nAstr\u00c3\u00a6a, when come back, might be expected to approve as the scene of\necstatic enjoyment for the beings whose special prerogative it is to\nlift their sublime faces toward heaven. Still, there was ample space on\nthe hearth--accommodation for narrative bagmen or boxmen--room for a man\nto stretch his legs; his brain was not pressed upon by a white wall\nwithin a yard of him, and the light did not stare in mercilessly on bare\nugliness, turning the fire to ashes. Compared with some beerhouses of\nthis more advanced period, the Cross-Keys of that day presented a high\nstandard of pleasure.\n\nBut though this venerable \"public\" had not failed to share in the recent\npolitical excitement of drinking, the pleasures it offered were not at\nthis hour of the evening sought by a numerous company. There were only\nthree or four pipes being smoked by the firelight, but it was enough for\nChristian when he found that one of these was being smoked by the\nbill-sticker, whose large flat basket, stuffed with placards, leaned\nnear him against the settle. So splendid an apparition as Christian was\nnot a little startling at the Cross-Keys, and was gazed at in expectant\nsilence; but he was a stranger in Pollard's End, and was taken for the\nhighest style of traveller when he declared that he was deucedly\nthirsty, ordered sixpenny worth of gin and a large jug of water, and,\nputting a few drops of the spirit into his own glass, invited Tommy\nTrounsem, who sat next him, to help himself. Tommy was not slower than a\nshaking hand obliged him to be in accepting this invitation. He was a\ntall, broad-shouldered old fellow, who had once been good-looking; but\nhis cheeks and chest were both hollow now, and his limbs were shrunken.\n\n\"You've got some bills there, master, eh?\" said Christian, pointing to\nthe basket. \"Is there an auction coming on?\"\n\n\"Auction? no,\" said Tommy, with a gruff hoarseness, which was the\nremnant of a jovial bass, and with an accent which differed from the\nTrebian fitfully, as an early habit is wont to reassert itself. \"I've\nnought to do wi' auctions; I'm a pol'tical charicter. It's me am getting\nTrounsem into Parl'ment.\"\n\n\"Trounsem, said he,\" the landlord observed, taking out his pipe with a\nlow laugh. \"It's Transome, sir. Maybe you don't belong to this part.\nIt's the candidate 'ull do most for the workingmen, and's proved it too,\nin the way o' being open-handed and wishing 'em to enjoy themselves. If\nI'd twenty votes, I'd give one for Transome, and I don't care who hears\nme.\"\n\nThe landlord peered out from his fungous cluster of features with a\nbeery confidence that the high figure of twenty had somehow raised the\nhypothetic value of his vote.\n\n\"Spilkins, now,\" said Tommy, waving his hand to the landlord, \"you let\none gentelman speak to another, will you? This genelman wants to know\nabout my bills. Does he, or doesn't he?\"\n\n\"What then? I spoke according,\" said the landlord, mildly holding his\nown.\n\n\"You're all very well, Spilkins,\" returned Tommy, \"but y'aren't me. I\nknow what the bills are. It's public business. I'm none o' your common\nbill-stickers, master; I've left off sticking up ten guineas reward for\na sheep-stealer, or low stuff like that. These are Trounsem's bills; and\nI'm the rightful family, and so I give him a lift. A Trounsem I am, and\na Trounsem I'll be buried; and if Old Nick tries to lay hold on me for\npoaching, I'll say, 'You be hanged for a lawyer, Old Nick; every hare\nand pheasant on the Trounsem's land is mine'; and what rises the family,\nrises old Tommy; and we're going to get into Parl'ment--that's the long\nand the short on't, master. And I'm the head o' the family, and I stick\nthe bills. There's Johnsons, and Thomsons, and Jacksons, and Billsons;\nbut I'm a Trounsem, I am. What do you say to that, master?\"\n\nThis appeal, accompanied by a blow on the table, while the landlord\nwinked at the company, was addressed to Christian, who answered, with\nsevere gravity--\n\n\"I say there isn't any work more honorable than bill-sticking.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Tommy, wagging his head from side to side. \"I thought\nyou'd come in to that. I thought you'd know better than say contrairy.\nBut I'll shake hands wi' you; I don't want to knock any man's head off.\nI'm a good chap--a sound crock--an old family kep' out o' my rights. I\nshall go to heaven, for all Old Nick.\"\n\nAs these celestial prospects might imply that a little extra gin was\nbeginning to tell on the bill-sticker, Christian wanted to lose no time\nin arresting his attention. He laid his hand on Tommy's and spoke\nemphatically.\n\n\"But I'll tell you what you bill-stickers are not up to. You should be\non the look-out when Debarry's side have stuck up fresh bills, and go\nand paste yours over them. I know where there's a lot of Debarry's bills\nnow. Come along with me and I'll show you. We'll paste them over, and\nthen we'll come back and treat the company.\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" said Tommy. \"Let's be off then.\"\n\nHe was one of the thoroughly inured, originally hale drunkards, and did\nnot easily lose his head or legs or the ordinary amount of method in his\ntalk. Strangers often supposed that Tommy was tipsy when he had only\ntaken what he called \"one blessed pint,\" chiefly from that glorious\ncontentment with himself and his adverse fortunes which is not usually\ncharacteristic of the sober Briton. He knocked the ashes out of his\npipe, seized his paste-vessel and his basket, and prepared to start with\na satisfactory promise that he could know what he was about.\n\nThe landlord and some others had confidently concluded that they\nunderstood all about Christian now. He was a Transome's man, come to see\nafter the bill-sticking in Transome's interest. The landlord, telling\nhis yellow wife snappishly to open the door for the gentleman, hoped\nsoon to see him again.\n\n\"This is a Transome's house, sir,\" he observed, \"in respect of\nentertaining customers of that color. I do my duty as a publican, which,\nif I know it, is to turn back no genelman's money. I say, give every\ngenelman a chance, and the more the merrier, in Parl'ment and out of it.\nAnd if anybody says they want but two Parl'ment men, I say it 'ud be\nbetter for trade if there was six of 'em, and voters according.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Christian; \"you're a sensible man, landlord. You don't\nmean to vote for Debarry, then, eh?\"\n\n\"Not nohow,\" said the landlord, thinking that where negatives were good\nthe more you had of them the better.\n\nAs soon as the door had closed behind Christian and his new companion\nTommy said--\n\n\"Now, master, if you're to be my lantern, don't you be a Jacky Lantern,\nwhich I take to mean one as leads you the wrong way. For I'll tell you\nwhat--if you've had the luck to fall in wi' Tommy Trounsem, don't you\nlet him drop.\"\n\n\"No, no--to be sure not,\" said Christian. \"Come along here. We'll go to\nthe Back Brewery wall first.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't you let me drop. Give me a shilling any day you like, and\nI'll tell you more nor you'll hear from Spilkins in a week. There isna\nmany men like me. I carried pots for fifteen year off and on--what do\nyou think o' that now, for a man as might ha' lived up there at Trounsem\nPark, and snared his own game? Which I'd ha' done,\" said Tommy, wagging\nhis head at Christian in the dimness undisturbed by gas. \"None o' your\nshooting for me--it's two to one you'll miss. Snaring's more\nfishing-like. You bait your hook, and if it isna the fishes' good-will\nto come, that's nothing again' the sporting genelman. And that's what I\nsay by snaring.\"\n\n\"But if you'd a right to the Transome estate, how was it you were kept\nout of it, old boy? It was some foul shame or other, eh?\"\n\n\"It's the law--that's what it is. You're a good sort of chap; I don't\nmind telling you. There's folks born to property, and there's folks\ncatch hold on it; and the law's made for them to catch hold. I'm pretty\ndeep; I see a good deal further than Spilkins. There was Ned Patch, the\npeddler, used to say to me, 'You canna read, Tommy,' says he. 'No; thank\nyou,' says I; 'I'm not going to crack my headpiece to make myself as big\na fool as you.' I was fond o' Ned. Many's the pot we've had together.\"\n\n\"I see well enough you're deep, Tommy. How came you to know you were\nborn to property?\"\n\n\"It was the regester--the parish regester,\" said Tommy, with his knowing\nwag of the head, \"that shows as you was born. I allays felt it inside me\nas I was somebody, and I could see other chaps thought it on me too; and\nso one day at Littleshaw, where I kep' ferrets and a little bit of a\npublic, there come a fine man looking after me, and walking me up and\ndown wi' questions. And I made out from the clerk as he'd been at the\nregester; and I gave the clerk a pot or two, and he got it off our\nparson as the name o' Trounsem was a great name hereabout. And I waits a\nbit for my fine man to come again. Thinks I, if there's property wants a\nright owner, I shall be called for; for I didn't know the law then. And\nI waited and waited, till I see'd no fun i' waiting. So I parted with my\npublic and my ferrets--for she was dead a' ready, my wife was, and I\nhadn't no cumbrance. And off I started a pretty long walk to this\ncountry-side, for I could walk for a wager in them days.\"\n\n\"Ah! well, here we are at the Back Brewery wall. Put down your paste and\nyour basket now, old boy, and I'll help you. You paste, and I'll give\nyou the bills, and then you can go on talking.\"\n\nTommy obeyed automatically, for he was now carried away by the rare\nopportunity of talking to a new listener, and was only eager to go on\nwith his story. As soon as his back was turned, and he was stooping over\nhis paste-pot, Christian, with quick adroitness, exchanged the placards\nin his own bag for those in Tommy's basket. Christian's placards had not\nbeen printed at Treby, but were a new lot which had been sent from\nDuffield that very day--\"highly spiced,\" Quorlen had said, \"coming from\na pen that was up to that sort of thing.\" Christian had read the first\nof the sheaf, and supposed they were all alike. He proceeded to hand one\nto Tommy and said--\n\n\"Here, old boy, paste this over the other. And so, when you got into\nthis country-side, what did you do?\"\n\n\"Why, I put up at a good public and ordered the best, for I'd a bit o'\nmoney in my pocket; and I axed about, and they said to me, if it's\nTrounsem business you're after, you go to Lawyer Jermyn. And I went; and\nsays I, going along, he's maybe the fine man as walked me up and down.\nBut no such thing. I'll tell you what Lawyer Jermyn was. He stands you\nthere, and holds you away from him wi' a pole three yard long. He stares\nat you, and says nothing, till you feel like a Tomfool; and then he\nthreats you to set the justice on you; and then he's sorry for you, and\nhands you money, and preaches you a sarmint, and tells you you're a poor\nman, and he'll give you a bit of advice--and you'd better not be\nmeddling wi' things belonging to the law, else you be catched up in a\nbig wheel and fly to bits. And I went of a cold sweat, and I wished I\nmight never come i' sight o' Lawyer Jermyn again. But he says, if you\nkeep i' this neighborhood, behave yourself well, and I'll pertect you. I\nwere deep enough, but it's no use being deep, 'cause you can never know\nthe law. And there's times when the deepest fellow's most frightened.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. There! Now for another placard. And so that was all?\"\n\n\"All?\" said Tommy, turning round and holding the paste-brush in suspense.\n\"Don't you be running too quick. Thinks I, 'I'll meddle no more. I've\ngot a bit o' money--I'll buy a basket, and be a pot-man. It's a pleasant\nlife. I shall live at publics and see the world, and pick 'quaintance,\nand get a chance penny.' But when I'd turned into the Red Lion, and got\nmyself warm again wi' a drop o' hot, something jumps into my head.\nThinks I, Tommy, you've done finely for yourself: you're a rat as has\nbroke up your house to take a journey, and show yourself to a ferret.\nAnd then it jumps into my head: I'd once two ferrets as turned on one\nanother, and the little un killed the big un. Says I to the landlady,\n'Missus, could you tell me of a lawyer,' says I, 'not very big or fine,\nbut a second-size--a big-potato, like?' 'That I can,' says she; 'there's\none now in the bar parlor.' 'Be so kind as bring us together,' says I.\nAnd she cries out--I think I hear her now--'Mr. Johnson!' And what do\nyou think?\"\n\nAt this crisis in Tommy's story the gray clouds, which had been\ngradually thinning, opened sufficiently to let down the sudden\nmoonlight, and show his poor battered old figure and face in the\nattitude and with the expression of a narrator sure of the coming effect\non his auditor; his body and neck stretched a little on one side, and\nhis paste-brush held out with an alarming intention of tapping\nChristian's coat-sleeve at the right moment. Christian started to a safe\ndistance, and said--\n\n\"It's wonderful. I can't tell what to think.\"\n\n\"Then never do you deny Old Nick,\" said Tommy, with solemnity. \"I've\nbelieved in him more ever since. Who was Johnson? Why, Johnson was the\nfine man as had walked me up and down with questions. And I out with it\nto him then and there. And he speaks me civil, and says, 'Come away wi'\nme, my good fellow.' And he told me a deal o' law. And he says, 'Whether\nyou're a Tommy Trounsem or no, it's no good to you, but only to them as\nhave got hold o' the property. If you was a Tommy Trounsem twenty times\nover, it 'ud be no good, for the law's bought you out; and your life's\nno good, only to them as have catched hold o' the property. The more you\nlive, the more they'll stick in. Not as they want you now,' says\nhe--'you're no good to anybody, and you might howl like a dog foriver,\nand the law 'ud take no notice on you.' Says Johnson, 'I'm doing a kind\nthing by you to tell you. For that's the law.' And if you want to know\nthe law, master, you ask Johnson. I heard 'em say after, as he was an\nunderstrapper at Jermyn's. I've never forgot it from that day to this.\nBut I saw clear enough, as if the law hadn't been again' me, the\nTrounsem estate 'ud ha' been mine. But folks are fools hereabouts, and\nI've left off talking. The more you tell 'em the truth, the more they'll\nniver believe you. And I went and bought my basket and the pots,\nand----\"\n\n\"Come then, fire away,\" said Christian. \"Here's another placard.\"\n\n\"I'm getting a bit dry, master.\"\n\n\"Well, then, make haste, and you'll have something to drink all the\nsooner.\"\n\nTommy turned to his work again, and Christian, continuing his help,\nsaid, \"And how long has Mr. Jermyn been employing you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no particular time--off and on; but a week or two ago he sees me\nupo' the road, and speaks to me uncommon civil, and tells me to go up to\nhis office and he'll give me employ. And I was noways unwilling to stick\nthe bills to get the family into Parl'ment. For there's no man can help\nthe law. And the family's the family, whether you carry pots or no.\nMaster, I'm uncommon dry; my head's a-turning round; it's talking so\nlong on end.\"\n\nThe unwonted excitement of poor Tommy's memory was producing a reaction.\n\n\"Well, Tommy,\" said Christian, who had just made a discovery among the\nplacards which altered the bent of his thoughts, \"you may go back to the\nCross-Keys now, if you like; here's a half-crown for you to spend\nhandsomely. I can't go back there myself just yet; but you may give my\nrespects to Spilkins, and mind you paste the rest of the bills early\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay. But don't you believe too much i' Spilkins,\" said Tommy,\npocketing the half-crown, and showing his gratitude by giving this\nadvice--\"he's no harm much--but weak. He thinks he's at the bottom o'\nthings because he scores you up. But I bear him no ill-will. Tommy\nTrounsem's a good chap; and any day you like to give me half-a-crown,\nI'll tell you the same story over again. Not now; I'm dry. Come, help me\nup wi' these things; you're a younger chap than me. Well, I'll tell\nSpilkins you'll come again another day.\"\n\nThe moonlight, which had lit up poor Tommy's oratorical attitude, had\nserved to light up for Christian the print of the placards. He had\nexpected the copies to be various, and had turned them half over at\ndifferent depths of the sheaf before drawing out those he offered to the\nbill-sticker. Suddenly the clearer light had shown him on one of them a\nname which was just then especially interesting to him, and all the more\nwhen occurring in a placard intended to dissuade the electors of North\nLoamshire from voting for the heir of the Transomes. He hastily turned\nover the bills that preceded and succeeded, that he might draw out and\ncarry away all of this pattern; for it might turn out to be wiser for\nhim not to contribute to the publicity of handbills which contained\nallusions to Bycliffe _versus_ Transome. There were about a dozen of\nthem; he pressed them together and thrust them into his pocket,\nreturning all the rest to Tommy's basket. To take away this dozen might\nnot be to prevent similar bills from being posted up elsewhere, but he\nhad reason to believe that these were all of the same kind which had\nbeen sent to Treby from Duffield.\n\nChristian's interest in his practical joke had died out like a morning\nrushlight. Apart from this discovery in the placards, old Tommy's story\nhad some indications in it that were worth pondering over. Where was\nthat well-informed Johnson now? Was he still an understrapper of\nJermyn's?\n\nWith this matter in his thoughts, Christian only turned in hastily at\nQuorlen's, threw down the black bag which contained the captured Radical\nhandbills, said he had done the job, and hurried back to the Manor that\nhe might study his problem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n    I doe believe that, as the gall has severall receptacles in several\n    creatures, soe there's scarce any creature but hath that emunctorye\n    somewhere.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE.\n\n\nFancy what a game at chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and\nintellects, more or less small and cunning: if you were not only\nuncertain about your adversary's men, but a little uncertain about your\nown; if your knight could shuffle himself on to a new square by the sly;\nif your bishop, in disgust at your castling, could wheedle your pawns\nout of their places; and if your pawns, hating you because they are\npawns, could make away from their appointed posts that you might get\ncheckmate on a sudden. You might be the longest-headed of deductive\nreasoners, and yet you might be beaten by your own pawns. You would be\nespecially likely to be beat, if you depended arrogantly on your\nmathematical imagination, and regarded your passionate pieces with\ncontempt.\n\nYet this imaginary chess is easy compared with the game a man has to\nplay against his fellow-men with other fellow-men for his instruments.\nHe thinks himself sagacious, perhaps, because he trusts no bond except\nthat of self-interest: but the only self-interest he can safely rely on\nis what seems to be such to the mind he would use or govern. Can he ever\nbe sure of knowing this?\n\nMatthew Jermyn was under no misgivings as to the fealty of Johnson. He\nhad \"been the making of Johnson\"; and this seems to many men as a reason\nfor expecting devotion, in spite of the fact that they themselves,\nthough very fond of their own persons and lives, are not at all devoted\nto the Maker they believe in. Johnson was a most serviceable\nsubordinate. Being a man who aimed at respectability, a family man, who\nhad a good church-pew, subscribed for engravings of banquet pictures\nwhere there were portraits of political celebrities, and wished his\nchildren to be more unquestionably genteel than their father, he\npresented all the more numerous handles of worldly motive by which a\njudicious superior might get a hold on him. But this useful regard to\nrespectability had its inconvenience in relation to such a superior: it\nwas a mark of some vanity and some pride, which, if they were not\ntouched just in the right handling-place, were liable to become raw and\nsensitive. Jermyn was aware of Johnson's weaknesses, and thought he had\nflattered them sufficiently. But on the point of knowing when we are\ndisagreeable, our human nature is fallible. Our lavender-water, our\nsmiles, our compliments, and other polite falsities, are constantly\noffensive, when in the very nature of them they can only be meant to\nattract admiration and regard. Jermyn had often been unconsciously\ndisagreeable to Johnson, over and above the constant offence of being an\nostentatious patron. He would never let Johnson dine with his wife and\ndaughters; he would not himself dine at Johnson's house when he was in\ntown. He often did what was equivalent to poohpoohing his conversation\nby not even appearing to listen, and by suddenly cutting it short with a\nquery on a new subject. Jermyn was able and politic enough to have\ncommanded a great deal of success in his life, but he could not help\nbeing handsome, arrogant, fond of being heard, indisposed to any kind of\ncomradeship, amorous and bland toward women, cold and self-contained\ntoward men. You will hear very strong denials that an attorney's being\nhandsome could enter into the dislike he excited; but conversation\nconsists a good deal in the denial of what is true. From the British\npoint of view masculine beauty is regarded very much as it is in the\ndrapery business:--as good solely for the fancy department--for young\nnoblemen, artists, poets, and the clergy. Some one who, like Mr. Lingon,\nwas disposed to revile Jermyn (perhaps it was Sir Maximus), had called\nhim \"a cursed, sleek, handsome, long-winded, overbearing sycophant\";\nepithets which expressed, rather confusedly, the mingled character of\nthe dislike he excited. And serviceable John Johnson, himself sleek, and\nmindful about his broadcloth and his cambric fronts, had what he\nconsidered \"spirit\" enough within him to feel that dislike of Jermyn\ngradually gathering force through years of obligation and subjection,\ntill it had become an actuating motive disposed to use an opportunity;\nif it did not watch for one.\n\nIt was not this motive, however, but rather the ordinary course of\nbusiness, which accounted for Johnson's playing a double part as an\nelectioneering agent. What men do in elections is not to be classed\neither among sins or marks of grace; it would be profane to include\nbusiness in religion, and conscience refers to failure, not to success.\nStill, the sense of being galled by Jermyn's harness was an additional\nreason for cultivating all relations that were independent of him; and\npique at Harold Transome's behavior to him in Jermyn's office perhaps\ngave all the more zest to Johnson's use of his pen and ink when he wrote\na handbill in the service of Garstin, and Garstin's incomparable agent,\nPutty, full of innuendoes against Harold Transome, as a descendant of\nthe Durfey-Transomes. It is a natural subject of self-congratulation to\na man, when special knowledge, gained long ago without any forecast,\nturns out to afford a special inspiration in the present; and Johnson\nfelt a new pleasure in the consciousness that he of all people in the\nworld next to Jermyn had the most intimate knowledge of the Transome\naffairs. Still better--some of these affairs were secrets of Jermyn's.\nIf in an uncomplimentary spirit he might have been called Jermyn's \"man\nof straw,\" it was a satisfaction to know that the unreality of the man\nJohn Johnson was confined to his appearance in annuity deeds, and that\nelsewhere he was solid, locomotive, and capable of remembering anything\nfor his own pleasure and benefit. To act with doubleness towards a man\nwhose conduct was double, was so near an approach to virtue that it\ndeserved to be called by no meaner name than diplomacy.\n\nBy such causes it came to pass that Christian held in his hands a bill\nin which Jermyn was playfully alluded to as Mr. German Cozen, who won\ngames by clever shuffling and odd tricks without any honor, and backed\nDurfey's crib against Bycliffe--in which it was adroitly implied that\nthe so-called head of the Transomes was only the tail of the\nDurfeys--and that some said the Durfeys would have died out and left\ntheir nest empty if it had not been for their German Cozen.\n\nJohnson had not dared to use any recollections except such as might\ncredibly exist in other minds besides his own. In the truth of the case,\nno one but himself had the prompting to recall these out-worn scandals;\nbut it was likely enough that such foul-winged things should be revived\nby election heats for Johnson to escape all suspicion.\n\nChristian could gather only dim and uncertain inferences from this flat\nirony and heavy joking; but one chief thing was clear to him. He had\nbeen right in his conjecture that Jermyn's interest about Bycliffe had\nits source in some claim of Bycliffe's on the Transome property. And\nthen, there was that story of the old bill-sticker's, which, closely\nconsidered, indicated that the right of the present Transomes depended,\nor, at least, had depended on the continuance of some other lives.\nChristian in his time had gathered enough legal notions to be aware that\npossession by one man sometimes depended on the life of another; that a\nman might sell his own interest in property, and the interest of his\ndescendants, while a claim on that property would still remain to some\none else than the purchaser, supposing the descendants became extinct,\nand the interests they had sold were at an end. But under what\nconditions the claim might be valid or void in any particular case, was\nall darkness to him. Suppose Bycliffe had any such claim on the Transome\nestates: how was Christian to know whether at the present moment it was\nworth anything more than a bit of rotten parchment? Old Tommy Trounsem\nhad said that Johnson knew all about it. But even if Johnson were still\nabove-ground--and all Johnsons are mortal--he might still be an\nunderstrapper of Jermyn's, in which case his knowledge would be on the\nwrong side of the hedge for the purposes of Henry Scaddon. His immediate\ncare must be to find out all he could about Johnson. He blamed himself\nfor not having questioned Tommy further while he had him at command; but\non this head the bill-sticker could hardly know more than the less\ndilapidated denizens of Treby.\n\nNow it had happened that during the weeks in which Christian had been at\nwork trying to solve the enigma of Jermyn's interest about Bycliffe,\nJohnson's mind also had been somewhat occupied with suspicion and\nconjecture as to new information on the subject of the old Bycliffe\nclaims which Jermyn intended to conceal from him. The letter which,\nafter his interview with Christian, Jermyn had written with a sense of\nperfect safety to his faithful ally Johnson, was, as we know, written to\na Johnson who had found his self-love incompatible with that\nfaithfulness of which it was supposed to be the foundation. Anything\nthat the patron felt it inconvenient for his obliged friend and servant\nto know, became by that very fact an object of peculiar curiosity. The\nobliged friend and servant secretly doted on his patron's inconvenience,\nprovided that he himself did not share it; and conjecture naturally\nbecame active.\n\nJohnson's legal imagination, being very differently furnished from\nChristian's, was at no loss to conceive conditions under which there\nmight arise a new claim on the Transome estates. He had before him the\nwhole history of the settlement of those estates made a hundred years\nago by John Justus Transome, entailing them, whilst in his possession,\non his son Thomas and his heirs-male, with remainder to the Bycliffes in\nfee. He knew that Thomas, son of John Justus, proving a prodigal, had,\nwithout the knowledge of his father, the tenant in possession, sold his\nown and his descendants' rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey; that,\ntherefore, the title of the Durfey-Transomes, in spite of that old\nDurfey's tricks to show the contrary, depended solely on the purchase of\nthe \"base fee\" thus created by Thomas Transome; and that the Bycliffes\nwere the \"remainder men\" who might fairly oust the Durfey-Transomes if\never the issue of the prodigal Thomas went clean out of existence, and\nceased to represent a right which he had bargained away from them.\n\nJohnson, as Jermyn's subordinate, had been closely cognizant of the\ndetails concerning the suit instituted by successive Bycliffes, of whom\nMaurice Christian Bycliffe was the last, on the plea that the extinction\nof Thomas Transome's line had actually come to pass--a weary suit, which\nhad eaten into the fortunes of two families, and had only made the\ncankerworms fat. The suit had closed with the death of Maurice Christian\nBycliffe in prison; but before his death, Jermyn's exertions to get\nevidence that there was still issue of Thomas Transome's line surviving,\nas a security of the Durfey title, had issued in the discovery of a\nThomas Transome at Littleshaw, in Stonyshire, who was the representative\nof the pawned inheritance. The death of Maurice had made this discovery\nuseless--had made it seem the wiser part to say nothing about it; and\nthe fact had remained a secret known only to Jermyn and Johnson. No\nother Bycliffe was known or believed to exist, and the Durfey-Transomes\nmight be considered safe, unless--yes, there was an \"unless\" which\nJohnson could conceive: an heir or heiress of the Bycliffes--if such a\npersonage turned out to be in existence--might sometime raise a new and\nvalid claim when once informed that wretched old Tommy Trounsem the\nbill-sticker, tottering drunkenly on the edge of the grave, was the last\nissue remaining above-ground from that dissolute Thomas who played his\nEsau part a century before. While the poor old bill-sticker breathed,\nthe Durfey-Transomes could legally keep their possession in spite of a\npossible Bycliffe proved real; but not when the parish had buried the\nbill-sticker.\n\nStill, it is one thing to conceive conditions, and another to see any\nchance of proving their existence. Johnson at present had no glimpse of\nsuch a chance; and even if he ever gained the glimpse, he was not sure\nthat he should ever make any use of it. His enquiries of Medwin, in\nobedience to Jermyn's letter, had extracted only a negative as to any\ninformation possessed by the lawyers of Bycliffe concerning a marriage,\nor expectation of offspring on his part. But Johnson felt not the less\nstung by curiosity to know what Jermyn had found out: that he had found\nsomething in relation to a possible Bycliffe, Johnson felt pretty sure.\nAnd he thought with satisfaction that Jermyn could not hinder him from\nknowing what he already knew about Thomas Transome's issue. Many things\nmight occur to alter his policy and give a new value to facts. Was it\ncertain that Jermyn would always be fortunate?\n\nWhen greed and unscrupulousness exhibit themselves on a grand historical\nscale, and there is a question of peace or war or amicable partition, it\noften occurs that gentlemen of high diplomatic talents have their minds\nbent on the same object from different points of view. Each, perhaps, is\nthinking of a certain duchy or province, with a view to arranging the\nownership in such a way as shall best serve the purposes of the\ngentleman with high diplomatic talents in whom each is more especially\ninterested. But these select minds in high office can never miss their\naims from ignorance of each other's existence or whereabouts. Their high\ntitles may be learned even by common people from every pocket almanac.\n\nBut with meaner diplomats, who might be mutually useful, such ignorance\nis often obstructive. Mr. John Johnson and Mr. Christian, otherwise Mr.\nScaddon, might have had a concentration of purpose and an ingenuity of\ndevice fitting them to make a figure in the parcelling of Europe, and\nyet they might never have met, simply because Johnson knew nothing of\nChristian, and because Christian did not know where to find Johnson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n    His nature is too noble for the world:\n    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\n    Or Jove for his power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;\n    What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;\n    And, being angry, doth forget that ever\n    He heard the name of death.--_Coriolanus._\n\n\nChristian and Johnson did meet, however, by means that were quite\nincalculable. The incident which brought them into communication was due\nto Felix Holt, who of all men in the world had the least affinity either\nfor the industrious or the idle parasite.\n\nMr. Lyon had urged Felix to go to Duffield on the fifteenth of December\nto witness the nomination of the candidates for North Loamshire. The\nminister wished to hear what took place; and the pleasure of gratifying\nhim helped to outweigh some opposing reasons.\n\n\"I shall get into a rage at something or other,\" Felix had said. \"I've\ntold you one of my weak points. Where I have any particular business, I\nmust incur the risks my nature brings. But I've no particular business\nat Duffield. However, I'll make a holiday and go. By dint of seeing\nfolly, I shall get lessons in patience.\"\n\nThe weak point to which Felix referred was his liability to be carried\ncompletely out of his own mastery by indignant anger. His strong health,\nhis renunciation of selfish claims, his habitual preoccupation with\nlarge thoughts and with purposes independent of everyday casualties,\nsecured him a fine and even temper, free from moodiness or irritability.\nHe was full of long-suffering toward his unwise mother, who \"pressed him\ndaily with her words and urged him, so that his soul was vexed;\" he had\nchosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of\npatience, that required those little rill-like outflowings of goodness\nwhich in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought\nand passionate devotedness. In this way his energies served to make him\ngentle; and now, in this twenty-sixth year of his life, they had ceased\nto make him angry, except in the presence of something that roused his\ndeep indignation. When once exasperated, the passionateness of his\nnature threw off the yoke of a long-trained consciousness in which\nthought and emotion had been more and more completely mingled, and\nconcentrated itself in a rage as ungovernable as that of boyhood. He was\nthoroughly aware of the liability, and knew that in such circumstances\nhe could not answer for himself. Sensitive people with feeble frames\nhave often the same sort of fury within them; but they are themselves\nshattered, and shatter nothing. Felix had a terrible arm: he knew that\nhe was dangerous; and he avoided the conditions that might cause him\nexasperation as he would have avoided intoxicating drinks if he had been\nin danger of intemperance.\n\nThe nomination-day was a great epoch of successful trickery, or, to\nspeak in a more parliamentary manner, of war-stratagem, on the part of\nskilful agents. And Mr. Johnson had his share of inward chuckling and\nself-approval, as one who might justly expect increasing renown, and be\nsome day in as general request as the great Putty himself. To have the\npleasure and the praise of electioneering ingenuity, and also to get\npaid for it, without too much anxiety whether the ingenuity will achieve\nits ultimate end, perhaps gives to some select persons a sort of\nsatisfaction in their superiority to their more agitated fellow-men that\nis worthy to be classed with those generous enjoyments of having the\ntruth chiefly to yourself, and of seeing others in danger of drowning\nwhile you are high and dry, which seem to have been regarded as unmixed\nprivileges by Lucretius and Lord Bacon.\n\nOne of Mr. Johnson's great successes was this. Spratt, the hated manager\nof the Sproxton Colliery, in careless confidence that the colliers and\nother laborers under him would follow his orders, had provided carts to\ncarry some loads of voteless enthusiasm to Duffield on behalf of\nGarstin; enthusiasm which, being already paid for by the recognized\nbenefit of Garstin's existence as a capitalist with a share in the\nSproxton mines, was not to cost much in the form of treating. A\ncapitalist was held worthy of pious honor as the cause why workingmen\nexisted. But Mr. Spratt did not sufficiently consider that a cause which\nwas to be proved by argument or testimony is not an object of passionate\ndevotion to colliers: a visible cause of beer acts on them much more\nstrongly. And even if there had been any love of the far-off Garstin,\nhatred of the too immediate Spratt would have been the stronger motive.\nHence Johnson's calculations, made long ago with Chubb, the remarkable\npublican, had been well founded, and there had been diligent care to\nsupply treating at Duffield in the name of Transome. After the election\nwas over it was not improbable that there would be much friendly joking\nbetween Putty and Johnson as to the success of this trick against\nPutty's employer, and Johnson would be conscious of rising in the\nopinion of his celebrated senior.\n\nFor the show of hands and the cheering, the hustling and the pelting,\nthe roaring and the hissing, the hard hits with small missiles and the\nsoft hits with small jokes, were strong enough on the side of Transome\nto balance the similar \"demonstrations\" for Garstin, even with the\nDebarry interest in his favor. And the inconvenient presence of Spratt\nwas easily got rid of by a dexterously-managed accident, which sent him\nbruised and limping from the scene of action. Mr. Chubb had never before\nfelt so thoroughly that the occasion was up to a level with his talents,\nwhile the clear daylight in which his virtue would appear when at the\nelection he voted, as his duty to himself bound him, for Garstin only,\ngave him thorough repose of conscience.\n\nFelix Holt was the only person looking on at the senseless exhibitions\nof this nomination-day, who knew from the beginning the history of the\ntrick with the Sproxton men. He had been aware all along that the\ntreating at Chubb's had been continued, and that so far Harold\nTransome's promise had produced no good fruits; and what he was\nobserving to-day, as he watched the uproarious crowd, convinced him that\nthe whole scheme would be carried out just as if he had never spoken\nabout it. He could be fair enough to Transome to allow that he might\nhave wished, and yet have been unable, with his notions of success, to\nkeep his promise; and his bitterness toward the candidate only took the\nform of contemptuous pity; for Felix was not sparing in his contempt for\nmen who put their inward honor in pawn by seeking the prizes of the\nworld. His scorn fell too readily on the fortunate. But when he saw\nJohnson passing to and fro, and speaking to Jermyn on the hustings, he\nfelt himself getting angry, and jumped off the wheel of the stationary\ncart on which he was mounted, that he might no longer be in sight of\nthis man, whose vitiating cant had made his blood hot and his fingers\ntingle on the first day of encountering him at Sproxton. It was a little\ntoo exasperating to look at this pink-faced rotund specimen of\nprosperity, to witness the power for evil that lay in his vulgar cant,\nbacked by another man's money, and to know that such stupid iniquity\nflourished the flags of Reform, and Liberalism, and justice to the\nneedy. While the roaring and the scuffling were still going on, Felix,\nwith his thick stick in his hand, made his way through the crowd, and\nwalked on through the Duffield streets, till he came out on a grassy\nsuburb, where the houses surrounded a small common. Here he walked\nabout in the breezy air, and ate his bread and apples, telling himself\nthat this angry haste of his about evils that could only be remedied\nslowly, could be nothing else than obstructive, and might some day--he\nsaw it so clearly that the thought seemed like a presentiment--be\nobstructive of his own work.\n\n\"Not to waste energy, to apply force where it would tell, to do small\nwork close at hand, not waiting for speculative chances of heroism, but\npreparing for them\"--these were the rules he had been constantly urging\non himself. But what could be a greater waste than to beat a scoundrel\nwho had law and opodeldoc at command? After this meditation, Felix felt\ncool and wise enough to return into the town, not, however, intending to\ndeny himself the satisfaction of a few pungent words wherever there was\nplace for them. Blows are sarcasms turned stupid: wit is a form of force\nthat leaves the limbs at rest.\n\nAnything that could be called a crowd was no longer to be seen. The show\nof hands having been pronounced to be in favor of Debarry and Transome,\nand a poll having been demanded for Garstin, the business of the day\nmight be considered at an end. But in the street where the hustings were\nerected, and where the great hotels stood, there were many groups, as\nwell as strollers and steady walkers to and fro. Men in superior\ngreatcoats and well-brushed hats were awaiting with more or less\nimpatience an important dinner, either at the Crown, which was Debarry's\nhouse, or at the Three Cranes, which was Garstin's, or at the Fox and\nHounds, which was Transome's. Knots of sober retailers, who had already\ndined, were to be seen at some shop-doors; men in very shabby coats and\nmiscellaneous head-coverings, inhabitants of Duffield and not county\nvoters, were lounging about in dull silence, or listening, some to a\ngrimy man in a flannel shirt, hatless and with turbid red hair, who was\ninsisting on political points with much more ease than had seemed to\nbelong to the gentlemen speakers on the hustings, and others to a Scotch\nvendor of articles useful to sell, whose unfamiliar accent seemed to\nhave a guarantee of truth in it wanting as an association with everyday\nEnglish. Some rough-looking pipe-smokers, or distinguished\ncigar-smokers, chose to walk up and down in isolation and silence. But\nthe majority of those who had shown a burning interest in the nomination\nhad disappeared, and cockades no longer studded a close-pressed crowd,\nlike, and also very unlike, meadow-flowers among the grass. The street\npavement was strangely painted with fragments of perishable missiles\nground flat under heavy feet: but the workers were resting from their\ntoil, and the buzz and tread and the fitfully discernible voices seemed\nlike stillness to Felix after the roar with which the wide space had\nbeen filled when he left it.\n\nThe group round the speaker in the flannel shirt stood at the corner of\na side-street, and the speaker himself was elevated by the head and\nshoulders above his hearers, not because he was tall, but because he\nstood on a projecting stone. At the opposite corner of the turning was\nthe great inn of the Fox and Hounds, and this was the ultra-Liberal\nquarter of the High street. Felix was at once attracted by this group;\nhe liked the look of the speaker, whose bare arms were powerfully\nmuscular, though he had the pallid complexion of a man who lives chiefly\namidst the heat of furnaces. He was leaning against the dark stone\nbuilding behind him with folded arms, the grimy paleness of his shirt\nand skin standing out in high relief against the dark stone building\nbehind him. He lifted up one forefinger, and marked his emphasis with it\nas he spoke. His voice was high and not strong, but Felix recognized the\nfluency and the method of an habitual preacher or lecturer.\n\n\"It's the fallacy of all monopolists,\" he was saying. \"We know what\nmonopolists are: men who want to keep a trade all to themselves, under\nthe pretence that they'll furnish the public with a better article. We\nknow what that comes to: in some countries a poor man can't afford to\nbuy a spoonful of salt, and yet there's salt enough in the world to\npickle every living thing in it. That's the sort of benefit monopolists\ndo to mankind. And these are the men who tell us we're to let politics\nalone; they'll govern us better without our knowing anything about it.\nWe must mind our business; we are ignorant; we've no time to study great\nquestions. But I tell them this: the greatest question in the world is,\nhow to give every man a man's share in what goes on in life----\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Felix in his sonorous voice, which seemed to give a\nnew impressiveness to what the speaker had said. Every one looked at\nhim: the well-washed face and its educated expression along with a dress\nmore careless than that of most well-to-do workmen on a holiday, made\nhis appearance strangely arresting.\n\n\"Not a pig's share,\" the speaker went on, \"not a horse's, not the share\nof a machine fed with oil only to make it work and nothing else. It\nisn't a man's share just to mind your pin-making, or your glass-blowing,\nand higgle about your own wages, and bring up your family to be ignorant\nsons of ignorant fathers, and no better prospect; that's a slave's\nshare; we want a freeman's share, and that is to think and speak and act\nabout what concerns us all, and see whether these fine gentlemen who\nundertake to govern us are doing the best they can for us. They've got\nthe knowledge, say they. Very well, we've got the wants. There's many a\none would be idle if hunger didn't pinch him; but the stomach sets us to\nwork. There's a fable told where the nobles are the belly and the people\nthe members. But I make another sort of fable. I say, we are the belly\nthat feels the pinches, and we'll set these aristocrats, these great\npeople who call themselves our brains, to work at some way of satisfying\nus a bit better. The aristocrats are pretty sure to try and govern for\ntheir own benefit; but how are we to be sure they'll try and govern for\nours? They must be looked after, I think, like other workmen. We must\nhave what we call inspectors, to see whether the work's well done for\nus. We want to send our inspectors to Parliament. Well, they say--you've\ngot the Reform Bill; what more can you want? Send your inspectors. But I\nsay, the Reform Bill is a trick--it's nothing but swearing-in special\nconstables to keep the aristocrats safe in their monopoly; it's bribing\nsome of the people with votes to make them hold their tongues about\ngiving votes to the rest. I say, if a man doesn't beg or steal, but\nworks for his bread, the poorer and the more miserable he is, the more\nhe'd need have a vote to send an inspector to Parliament--else the man\nwho is worst off is likely to be forgotten; and I say, he's the man who\nought to be first remembered. Else what does their religion mean? Why do\nthey build churches and endow them that their sons may get paid well for\npreaching a Saviour, and making themselves as little like Him as can be?\nIf I want to believe in Jesus Christ, I must shut my eyes for fear I\nshould see a parson. And what's a bishop? A bishop's a person dressed\nup, who sits in the House of Lords to help and throw out Reform Bills.\nAnd because it's hard to get anything in the shape of a man to dress\nhimself up like that, and do such work, they have to give him a palace\nfor it, and plenty of thousands a-year. And then they cry out--'The\nChurch is in danger,'--'the poor man's Church.' And why is it the poor\nman's Church? Because he can have a seat for nothing. I think it _is_\nfor nothing; for it would be hard to tell what he gets by it. If the\npoor man had a vote in the matter, I think he'd choose a different sort\nof Church to what that is. But do you think the aristocrats will ever\nalter it, if the belly doesn't pinch them? Not they. It's part of their\nmonopoly. They'll supply us with our religion like everything else, and\nget a profit on it. They'll give us plenty of heaven. We may have land\n_there_. That's the sort of religion they like--a religion that gives us\nworkingmen heaven, and nothing else. But we'll offer to change with\nthem. We'll give them back some of their heaven, and take it out in\nsomething for us and our children in this world. They don't seem to care\nso much about heaven themselves till they feel the gout very bad; but\nyou won't get them to give up anything else, if you don't pinch 'em for\nit. And to pinch them enough, we must get the suffrage, we must get\nvotes, that we may send the men to Parliament who will do our work for\nus; and we must have Parliament dissolved every year, that we may change\nour man if he doesn't do what we want him to do; and we must have the\ncountry divided so that the little kings of the counties can't do as\nthey like, but must be shaken up in one bag with us. I say, if we\nworkingmen are ever to get a man's share, we must have universal\nsuffrage, and annual Parliaments, and the vote by ballot, and electoral\ndistricts.\"\n\n\"No!--something else before all that,\" said Felix, again startling the\naudience into looking at him. But the speaker glanced coldly at him and\nwent on.\n\n\"That's what Sir Francis Burdett went in for fifteen years ago; and it's\nthe right thing for us, if it was Tomfool who went in for it. You must\nlay hold of such handles as you can. I don't believe much in Liberal\naristocrats; but if there's any fine carved gold-headed stick of an\naristocrat will make a broomstick of himself, I'll lose no time but I'll\nsweep with him. And that's what I think about Transome. And if any of\nyou have acquaintance among county voters, give 'em a hint that you wish\n'em to vote for Transome.\"\n\nAt the last word, the speaker stepped down from his slight eminence, and\nwalked away rapidly, like a man whose leisure was exhausted, and who\nmust go about his business. But he had left an appetite in his audience\nfor further oratory, and one of them seemed to express a general\nsentiment as he hurried immediately to Felix, and said, \"Come, sir, what\ndo you say?\"\n\nFelix did at once what he would very likely have done without being\nasked--he stepped on the stone, and took off his cap by an instinctive\nprompting that always led him to speak uncovered. The effect of his\nfigure in relief against the stone background was unlike that of the\nprevious speaker. He was considerably taller, his head and neck were\nmore massive, and the expression of his mouth and eyes was something\nvery different from the mere acuteness and rather hard-lipped antagonism\nof the trades-union man. Felix Holt's face had the look of habitual\nmeditative abstraction from objects of mere personal vanity or desire,\nwhich is the peculiar stamp of culture, and makes a very roughly-cut\nface worthy to be called \"the human face divine.\" Even lions and dogs\nknow a distinction between men's glances; and doubtless those Duffield\nmen, in the expectation with which they looked up at Felix, were\nunconsciously influenced by the grandeur of his full yet firm mouth, and\nthe calm clearness of his gray eyes, which were somehow unlike what they\nwere accustomed to see along with an old brown velveteen coat, and an\nabsence of chin-propping. When he began to speak, the contrast of voice\nwas still stronger than that of appearance. The man in the flannel shirt\nhad not been heard--had probably not cared to be heard--beyond the\nimmediate group of listeners. But Felix at once drew the attention of\npersons comparatively at a distance.\n\n\"In my opinion,\" he said, almost the moment after he was addressed,\n\"that was a true word spoken by your friend when he said the great\nquestion was how to give every man a man's share in life. But I think he\nexpects voting to do more toward it than I do. I want the workingmen to\nhave power. I'm a workingman myself, and I don't want to be anything\nelse. But there are two sorts of power. There's a power to do\nmischief--to undo what has been done with great expense and labor, to\nwaste and destroy, to be cruel to the weak, to lie and quarrel, and to\ntalk poisonous nonsense. That's the sort of power that ignorant numbers\nhave. It never made a joint stool or planted a potato. Do you think it's\nlikely to do much toward governing a great country, and making wise\nlaws, and giving shelter, food, and clothes to millions of men? Ignorant\npower comes in the end to the same thing as wicked power; it makes\nmisery. It's another sort of power that I want us workingmen to have,\nand I can see plainly enough that our all having votes will do little\ntoward it at present. I hope we, or the children that come after us,\nwill get plenty of political power some time. I tell everybody plainly,\nI hope there will be great changes, and that some time, whether we live\nto see it or not, men will have come to be ashamed of things they're\nproud of now. But I should like to convince you that votes would never\ngive you political power worth having while things are as they are now,\nand that if you go the right way to work you may get power sooner\nwithout votes. Perhaps all you who hear me are sober men, who try to\nlearn as much of the nature of things as you can, and to be as little\nlike fools as possible. A fool or idiot is one who expects things to\nhappen that never can happen; he pours milk into a can without a bottom,\nand expects the milk to stay there. The more of such vain expectations a\nman has, the more he is a fool or idiot. And if any working man expects\na vote to do for him what it never can do, he's foolish to that amount,\nif no more. I think that's clear enough, eh?\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said several voices, but they were not those of the\noriginal group; they belonged to some strollers who had been attracted\nby Felix Holt's vibrating voice, and were Tories from the Crown. Among\nthem was Christian, who was smoking a cigar with a pleasure he always\nfelt in being among people who did not know him, and doubtless took him\nto be something higher than he really was. Hearers from the Fox and\nHounds also were slowly adding themselves to the nucleus. Felix,\naccessible to the pleasure of being listened to, went on with more and\nmore animation: \"The way to get rid of folly is to get rid of vain\nexpectations, and of thoughts that don't agree with the nature of\nthings. The men who have had true thoughts about water, and what it will\ndo when it is turned into steam and under all sorts of circumstances,\nhave made themselves a great power in the world: they are turning the\nwheels of engines that will help to change most things. But no engines\nwould have done, if there had been false notions about the way water\nwould act. Now, all the schemes about voting, and districts, and annual\nParliaments, and the rest, are engines, and the water or steam--the\nforce that is to work them--must come out of human nature--out of men's\npassions, feelings, desires. Whether the engines will do good work or\nbad depends on these feelings; and if we have false expectations about\nmen's characters, we are very much like the idiot who thinks he'll carry\nmilk in a can without a bottom. In my opinion, the notions about what\nmere voting will do are very much of that sort.\"\n\n\"That's very fine,\" said a man in dirty fustian, with a scornful laugh.\n\"But how are we to get the power without votes?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what's the greatest power under heaven,\" said Felix, \"and\nthat is public opinion--the ruling belief in society about what is right\nand what is wrong, what is honorable and what is shameful. That's the\nsteam that is to work the engines. How can political freedom make us\nbetter, any more than a religion we don't believe in, if people laugh\nand wink when they see men abuse and defile it? And while public opinion\nis what it is--while men have no better beliefs about public duty--while\ncorruption is not felt to be a damning disgrace--while men are not\nashamed in Parliament and out of it to make public questions which\nconcern the welfare of millions a mere screen for their own petty\nprivate ends,--I say, no fresh scheme of voting will much mend our\ncondition. For, take us workingmen of all sorts. Suppose out of every\nhundred who had a vote there were thirty who had some soberness, some\nsense to choose with, some good feeling to make them wish the right\nthing for all. And suppose there were seventy out of the hundred who\nwere, half of them, not sober, who had no sense to choose one thing in\npolitics more than another, and who had so little good feeling in them\nthat they wasted on their own drinking the money that should have helped\nto feed and clothe their wives and children; and another half of them\nwho, if they didn't drink, were too ignorant or stupid to see any good\nfor themselves better than pocketing a five-shilling piece when it was\noffered them. Where would be the political power of the thirty sober\nmen? The power would lie with the seventy drunken and stupid votes; and\nI'll tell you what sort of men would get the power--what sort of men\nwould end by returning whom they pleased to Parliament.\"\n\nFelix had seen every face around him, and had particularly noticed a\nrecent addition to his audience; but now he looked about him, without\nappearing to fix his glance on any one. In spite of his cooling\nmeditations an hour ago, his pulse was getting quickened by indignation,\nand the desire to crush what he hated was likely to vent itself in\narticulation. His tone became more biting.\n\n\"They would be men who would undertake to do the business for a\ncandidate, and return him: men who have no real opinions, but who pilfer\nthe words of every opinion, and turn them into a cant which will serve\ntheir purpose at the moment; men who look out for dirty work to make\ntheir fortunes by, because dirty work wants little talent and no\nconscience; men who know all the ins and outs of bribery, because there\nis not a cranny in their own souls where a bribe can't enter. Such men\nas these will be the masters wherever there's a majority of voters who\ncare more for money, for drink, more for some mean little end which is\ntheir own and nobody else's, than for anything that has ever been called\nRight in the world. For suppose there's a poor voter named Jack, who has\nseven children, and twelve or fifteen shillings a-week wages, perhaps\nless. Jack can't read--I don't say whose fault that is--he never had the\nchance to learn; he knows so little that he perhaps thinks God made the\npoor-laws, and if anybody said the pattern of the work-house was laid\ndown in the Testament, he wouldn't be able to contradict them. What is\npoor Jack likely to do when he sees a smart stranger coming to him, who\nhappens to be just one of these men that I say will be the masters till\npublic opinion gets too hot for them? He's a middle-sized man, we'll\nsay; stout, with coat upon coat of fine broadcloth, open enough to show\na fine gold chain: none of your dark, scowling men, but one with an\ninnocent pink-and-white skin and very smooth light hair--a most\nrespectable man, who calls himself a good, sound, well-known English\nname--as Green, or Baker, or Wilson, or let us say, Johnson----\"\n\nFelix was interrupted by an explosion of laughter from a majority of the\nbystanders. Some eyes had been turned on Johnson, who stood on the right\nhand of Felix, at the very beginning of the description, and these were\ngradually followed by others, till at last every hearer's attention was\nfixed on him, and the first burst of laughter from the two or three who\nknew the attorney's name, let every one sufficiently into the secret to\nmake the amusement common. Johnson, who had kept his ground till his\nname was mentioned, now turned away, looking unusually white after being\nunusually red, and feeling by an attorney's instinct for his\npocket-book, as if he felt it was a case for taking down the names of\nwitnesses.\n\nAll the well-dressed hearers turned away too, thinking they had had the\ncream of the speech in the joke against Johnson, which, as a thing worth\ntelling, helped to recall them to the scene of dinner.\n\n\"Who is this Johnson?\" said Christian to a young man who had been\nstanding near him, and had been one of the first to laugh. Christian's\ncuriosity had naturally been awakened by what might prove a golden\nopportunity.\n\n\"Oh--a London attorney. He acts for Transome. That tremendous fellow at\nthe corner there is some red-hot Radical demagogue, and Johnson has\noffended him, I suppose; else he wouldn't have turned in that way on a\nman of their own party.\"\n\n\"I had heard there was a Johnson who was an understrapper of Jermyn's,\"\nsaid Christian.\n\n\"Well, so this man may have been for what I know. But he's a London man\nnow--a very busy fellow--on his own legs in Bedford Row. Ha, ha! it's\ncapital, though, when these Liberals get a slap in the face from the\nworkingmen they're so very fond of.\"\n\nAnother turn along the street enabled Christian to come to a resolution.\nHaving seen Jermyn drive away an hour before, he was in no fear: he\nwalked at once to the Fox and Hounds and asked to speak to Mr. Johnson.\nA brief interview, in which Christian ascertained that he had before him\nthe Johnson mentioned by the bill-sticker, issued in the appointment of\na longer one at a later hour; and before they left Duffield they had\ncome not exactly to a mutual understanding, but to an exchange of\ninformation mutually welcome.\n\nChristian had been very cautious in the commencement, only intimating\nthat he knew something important which some chance hints had induced him\nto think might be interesting to Mr. Johnson, but that this entirely\ndepended on how far he had a common interest with Mr. Jermyn. Johnson\nreplied that he had much business in which that gentleman was not\nconcerned, but that to a certain extent they had a common interest.\nProbably then, Christian observed, the affairs of the Transome estate\nwere part of the business in which Mr. Jermyn and Mr. Johnson might be\nunderstood to represent each other, in which case he need not detain Mr.\nJohnson? At this hint Johnson could not conceal that he was becoming\neager. He had no idea what Christian's information was, but there were\nmany grounds on which Johnson desired to know as much as he could about\nthe Transome affairs independently of Jermyn. By little and little an\nunderstanding was arrived at. Christian told of his interview with Tommy\nTrounsem, and stated that if Johnson could show him whether the\nknowledge could have any legal value, he could bring evidence that a\nlegitimate child of Bycliffe's existed: he felt certain of his fact, and\nof his proof. Johnson explained, that in this case the death of the old\nbill-sticker would give the child the first valid claim to the Bycliffe\nheirship; that for his own part he should be glad to further a true\nclaim, but that caution would have to be observed. How did Christian\nknow that Jermyn, was informed on this subject? Christian, more and more\nconvinced that Johnson would be glad to counteract Jermyn at length\nbecame explicit about Esther, but still withheld his own real name, and\nthe nature of his relations with Bycliffe. He said he would bring the\nrest of his information when Mr. Johnson took the case up seriously, and\nplace it in the hands of Bycliffe's old lawyers--of course he would do\nthat? Johnson replied that he would certainly do that; but that there\nwere legal niceties which Mr. Christian was probably not acquainted\nwith; that Esther's claim had not yet accrued, and that hurry was\nuseless.\n\nThe two men parted, each in distrust of the other, but each well pleased\nto have learned something. Johnson was not at all sure how he should\nact, but thought it likely that events would soon guide him. Christian\nwas beginning to meditate a way of securing his own ends without\ndepending in the least on Johnson's procedure. It was enough for him\nthat he was now assured of Esther's legal claim on the Transome estates.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n    \"In the copia of the factious language the word Tory was\n    entertained, and being a vocal clever-sounding word, readily\n    pronounced, it kept its hold, and took possession of the foul\n    mouths of the faction.----The Loyalists began to cheer up and to\n    take heart of grace, and in the working of this crisis, according\n    to the common law of scolding, they considered which way to make\n    payment for so much of Tory as they had been treated with to clear\n    scores.----Immediately the train took, and ran like wildfire and\n    became general. And so the account of Tory was balanced, and soon\n    began to run up a sharp score on the other side.\"--NORTH'S\n    _Examen_, p. 321.\n\n\nAt last the great epoch of the election for North Loamshire had arrived.\nThe roads approaching Treby were early traversed by a larger number of\nvehicles, horsemen, and also foot-passengers than were ever seen at the\nannual fair. Treby was the polling-place for many voters whose faces\nwere quite strange in the town; and if there were some strangers who did\nnot come to poll, though they had business not unconnected with the\nelection, they were not liable to be regarded with suspicion or especial\ncuriosity. It was understood that no division of a county had ever been\nmore thoroughly canvassed, and that there would be a hard run between\nGarstin and Transome. Mr. Johnson's headquarters were at Duffield; but\nit was a maxim which he repeated after the great Putty, that a capable\nagent makes himself omnipresent; and quite apart from the express\nbetween him and Jermyn, Mr. John Johnson's presence in the universe had\npotent effects on this December day at Treby Magna.\n\nA slight drizzling rain which was observed by some Tories who looked out\nof their bedroom windows before six o'clock, made them hope that, after\nall, the day might pass off better than alarmists had expected. The rain\nwas felt to be somehow on the side of quiet and Conservatism; but soon\nthe breaking of the clouds and the mild gleams of a December sun brought\nback previous apprehensions. As there were already precedents for riot\nat a Reformed election, and as the Trebian district had had its\nconfidence in the natural course of things somewhat shaken by a landed\nproprietor with an old name offering himself as a Radical candidate, the\nelection had been looked forward to by many with a vague sense that it\nwould be an occasion something like a fighting match, when bad\ncharacters would probably assemble, and there might be struggles and\nalarms for respectable men, which would make it expedient for them to\ntake a little neat brandy as a precaution beforehand and a restorative\nafterward. The tenants on the Transome estate were comparatively\nfearless: poor Mr. Goffe, of Rabbit's End, considered that \"one thing\nwas as mauling as the other,\" and that an election was no worse than the\nsheep-rot; while Mr. Dibbs, taking the more cheerful view of a\nprosperous man, reflected that if the Radicals were dangerous, it was\nsafer to be on their side. It was the voters for Debarry and Garstin who\nconsidered that they alone had the right to regard themselves as targets\nfor evil-minded men; and Mr. Crowder, if he could have got his ideas\ncountenanced, would have recommended a muster of farm-servants with\ndefensive pitchforks on the side of Church and king. But the bolder men\nwere rather gratified by the prospect of being groaned at, so that they\nmight face about and groan in return.\n\nMr. Crow, the high constable of Treby, inwardly rehearsed a brief\naddress to a riotous crowd in case it should be wanted, having been\nwarned by the rector that it was a primary duty on these occasions to\nkeep a watch against provocation as well as violence. The rector, with a\nbrother magistrate who was on the spot, had thought it desirable to\nswear in some special constables, but the presence of loyal men not\nabsolutely required for the polling was not looked at in the light of a\nprovocation. The Benefit Clubs from various quarters made a show, some\nwith the orange-colored ribbons and streamers of the true Tory\ncandidate, some with the mazarine of the Whig. The orange-colored bands\nplayed \"Auld Lang Syne,\" and a louder mazarine band came across them\nwith \"Oh, whistle and I will come to thee, my lad\"--probably as the tune\nthe most symbolical of Liberalism which their repertory would furnish.\nThere was not a single club bearing the Radical blue: the Sproxton Club\nmembers wore the mazarine, and Mr. Chubb wore so much of it that he\nlooked (at a sufficient distance) like a very large gentianella. It was\ngenerally understood that \"these brave fellows,\" representing the fine\ninstitution of Benefit Clubs, holding aloft the motto, \"Let brotherly\nlove continue,\" were a civil force calculated to encourage voters of\nsound opinions and keep up their spirits. But a considerable number of\nunadorned heavy navvies, colliers, and stone-pit men, who used their\nfreedom as British subjects to be present in Treby on this great\noccasion, looked like a possible uncivil force whose politics were\ndubious until it was clearly seen for whom they cheered and for whom\nthey groaned.\n\nThus the way up to the polling-booths was variously lined, and those who\nwalked it, to whatever side they belonged, had the advantage of hearing\nfrom the opposite side what were the most marked defects or excesses in\ntheir personal appearance; for the Trebians of that day held, without\nbeing aware that they had Cicero's authority for it, that the bodily\nblemishes of an opponent were a legitimate ground for ridicule; but if\nthe voter frustrated wit by being handsome, he was groaned at and\nsatirized according to a formula, in which the adjective was Tory, Whig,\nor Radical, as the case might be, and the substantive a blank to be\nfilled up after the taste of the speaker.\n\nSome of the more timid had chosen to go through this ordeal as early as\npossible in the morning. One of the earliest was Mr. Timothy Rose, the\ngentleman-farmer from Leek Malton. He had left home with some\nforeboding, having swathed his more vital parts in layers of flannel,\nand put on two greatcoats as a soft kind of armor. But reflecting with\nsome trepidation that there were no resources for protecting his head,\nhe once more wavered in his intention to vote; he once more observed to\nMrs. Rose that these were hard times when a man of independent property\nwas expected to vote \"willy-nilly;\" but finally coerced by the sense\nthat he should be looked ill on \"in these times\" if he did not stand by\nthe gentlemen round about, he set out in his gig, taking with him a\npowerful wagoner, whom he ordered to keep him in sight as he went to\nthe polling-booth. It was hardly more than nine o'clock when Mr. Rose,\nhaving thus come up to the level of his times, cheered himself with a\nlittle cherry-brandy at the Marquis, drove away in a much more\ncourageous spirit, and got down at Mr. Nolan's, just outside the town.\nThe retired Londoner, he considered, was a man of experience, who would\nestimate properly the judicious course he had taken, and could make it\nknown to others. Mr. Nolan was superintending the removal of some shrubs\nin his garden.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Nolan,\" said Rose, twinkling a self-complacent look over the\nred prominence of his cheeks, \"have you been to give your vote yet?\"\n\n\"No; all in good time. I shall go presently.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't lose an hour, I wouldn't. I said to myself, if I've\ngot to do gentlemen a favor, I'll do it at once. You see, I've got no\nlandlord, Nolan--I'm in that position o' life that I can be\nindependent.\"\n\n\"Just so, my dear sir,\" said the wiry-faced Nolan, pinching his\nunder-lip between his thumb and finger, and giving one of those\nwonderful universal shrugs, by which he seemed to be recalling all his\ngarments from a tendency to disperse themselves. \"Come in and see Mrs.\nNolan?\"\n\n\"No, no, thankye. Mrs. Rose expects me back. But, as I was saying, I'm a\nindependent man, and I consider it's not my part to show favor to one\nmore than another, but to make things as even as I can. If I'd been a\ntenant to anybody, well, in course I must have voted for my\nlandlord--that stands to sense. But I wish everybody well; and if one's\nreturned to Parliament more than another, nobody can say it's my doing;\nfor when you can vote for two, you can make things even. So I gave one\nto Debarry and one to Transome; and I wish Garstin no ill, but I can't\nhelp the odd number, and he hangs on to Debarry, they say.\"\n\n\"God bless me, sir,\" said Mr. Nolan, coughing down a laugh, \"don't you\nperceive that you might as well have stayed at home and not voted at\nall, unless you would rather send a Radical to Parliament than a sober\nWhig?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry you should have anything to say against what I've done,\nNolan,\" said Mr. Rose, rather crestfallen, though sustained by inward\nwarmth. \"I thought you'd agree with me, as you're a sensible man. But\nthe most a independent man can do is to try and please all; and if he\nhasn't the luck--here's wishing I may do it another time,\" added Mr.\nRose, apparently confounding a toast with a salutation, for he put out\nhis hand for a passing shake, and then stepped into his gig again.\n\nAt the time that Mr. Timothy Rose left the town, the crowd in King\nStreet and in the market-place, where the polling-booths stood, was\nfluctuating. Voters as yet were scanty, and brave fellows who had come\nfrom any distance this morning, or who had sat up late drinking the\nnight before, required some reinforcement of their strength and spirits.\nEvery public house in Treby, not excepting the venerable and sombre\nCross-Keys, was lively with changing and numerous company. Not, of\ncourse, that there was any treating: treating necessarily had stopped,\nfrom moral scruples, when once \"the wits were out;\" but there was\ndrinking, which did equally well under any name.\n\nPoor Tommy Trounsem, breakfasting here on Falstaff's proportion of\nbread, and something which, for gentility's sake, I will call sack, was\nmore than usually victorious over the ills of life, and felt himself one\nof the heroes of the day. He had an immense light-blue cockade in his\nhat, and an amount of silver in a dirty little canvas bag which\nastonished himself. For some reason, at first inscrutable to him, he had\nbeen paid for his bill-sticking with great liberality at Mr. Jermyn's\noffice, in spite of his having been the victim of a trick by which he\nhad once lost his own bills and pasted up Debarry's; but he soon saw\nthat this was simply a recognition of his merit as \"an old family kept\nout of its rights,\" and also of his peculiar share in an occasion when\nthe family was to get into Parliament. Under these circumstances, it was\ndue from him that he should show himself prominently where business was\ngoing forward, and give additional value by his presence to every vote\nfor Transome. With this view he got a half-pint bottle filled with his\npeculiar kind of \"sack,\" and hastened back to the market-place, feeling\ngood-natured and patronizing toward all political parties, and only so\nfar partial as his family bound him to be.\n\nBut a disposition to concentrate at that extremity of King Street which\nissued in the market-place, was not universal among the increasing\ncrowd. Some of them seemed attracted toward another nucleus at the other\nextremity of King Street, near the Seven Stars. This was Garstin's chief\nhouse, where his committee sat, and it was also a point which must\nnecessarily be passed by many voters entering the town on the eastern\nside. It seemed natural that the mazarine colors should be visible\nhere, and that Pack, the tall \"shepherd\" of the Sproxton men, should be\nseen moving to and fro where there would be a frequent opportunity of\ncheering the voters for a gentleman who had the chief share in the\nSproxton mines. But the side lanes and entries out of King Street were\nnumerous enough to relieve any pressure if there was need to make way.\nThe lanes had a distinguished reputation. Two of them had odors of\nbrewing; one had a side entrance to Mr. Tiliot's wine and spirit vaults;\nup another Mr. Muscat's cheeses were frequently being unloaded; and even\nsome of the entries had those cheerful suggestions of plentiful\nprovision which were among the characteristics of Treby.\n\nBetween ten and eleven the voters came in more rapid succession, and the\nwhole scene became spirited. Cheers, sarcasms, and oaths, which seemed\nto have a flavor of wit for many hearers, were beginning to be\nreinforced by more practical demonstrations, dubiously jocose. There was\na disposition in the crowd to close and hem in the way for voters,\neither going or coming, until they had paid some kind of toll. It was\ndifficult to see who set the example in the transition from words to\ndeeds. Some thought it was due to Jacob Cuff, a Tory charity-man, who\nwas a well-known ornament of the pothouse, and gave his mind much\nleisure for amusing devices; but questions of origination in stirring\nperiods are notoriously hard to settle. It is by no means necessary in\nhuman things that there should be only one beginner. This, however, is\ncertain--that Mr. Chubb, who wished it to be noticed that he voted for\nGarstin solely, was one of the first to get rather more notice than he\nwished, and that he had his hat knocked off and crushed in the interest\nof Debarry by Tories opposed to coalition. On the other hand, some said\nit was at the same time that Mr. Pink, the saddler, being stopped on his\nway and made to declare that he was going to vote for Debarry, got\nhimself well chalked as to his coat, and pushed up an entry, where he\nremained the prisoner of terror combined with the want of any back\noutlet, and never gave his vote that day.\n\nThe second Tory joke was performed with much gusto. The majority of the\nTransome tenants came in a body from the Ram Inn, with Mr. Banks, the\nbailiff, leading them. Poor Goffe was the last of them, and his worn\nmelancholy look and forward-leaning gait gave the jocose Cuff the notion\nthat the farmer was not what he called \"compus.\" Mr. Goffe was cut off\nfrom his companions and hemmed in: asked, by voices with hot breath\nclose to his ear, how many horses he had, how many cows, how many fat\npigs; then jostled from one to another, who made trumpets with their\nhands, and deafened him by telling him to vote for Debarry. In this way\nthe melancholy Goffe was hustled on till he was at the polling-booth,\nfilled with confused alarms, the immediate alarm being that of having to\ngo back in still worse fashion than he had come. Arriving in this way\nafter the other tenants had left, he astonished all hearers who knew him\nfor a tenant of the Transomes by saying \"Debarry,\" and was jostled back\ntrembling amid shouts of laughter.\n\nBy stages of this kind the fun grew faster, and was in danger of getting\nrather serious. The Tories began to feel that their jokes were returned\nby others of a heavier sort, and that the main strength of the crowd was\nnot on the side of sound opinion, but might come to be on the side of\nsound cudgelling and kicking. The navvies and pitmen in dishabille\nseemed to be multiplying, and to be clearly not belonging to the party\nof Order. The shops were freely resorted to for various forms of playful\nmissiles and weapons; and news came to the magistrates, watching from\nthe large window of the Marquis, that a gentleman coming in on horseback\nat the other end of the street to vote for Garstin had had his horse\nturned round and frightened into a headlong gallop out of it again.\n\nMr. Crow and his subordinates, and all the special constables, felt that\nit was necessary to make some energetic effort, or else every voter\nwould be intimidated and the poll must be adjourned. The rector\ndetermined to get on horseback and go amidst the crowd with the\nconstables; and he sent a message to Mr. Lingon, who was at the Ram,\ncalling on him to do the same. \"Sporting Jack\" was sure the good fellows\nmeant no harm, but he was courageous enough to face any bodily dangers,\nand rode out in his brown leggings and colored bandana, speaking\npersuasively.\n\nIt was nearly twelve o'clock when this sally was made: the constables\nand magistrates tried the most pacific measures, and they seemed to\nsucceed. There was a rapid thinning of the crowd: the most boisterous\ndisappeared, or seemed to do so by becoming quiet; missiles ceased to\nfly, and a sufficient way was cleared for voters along King Street. The\nmagistrates returned to their quarters, and the constables took\nconvenient posts of observation. Mr. Wace, who was one of Debarry's\ncommittee, had suggested to the rector that it might be wise to send\nfor the military from Duffield, with orders that they should station\nthemselves at Hathercote, three miles off: there was so much property in\nthe town that it would be better to make it secure against risks. But\nthe rector felt that this was not the part of a moderate and wise\nmagistrate, unless the signs of riot recurred. He was a brave man, and\nfond of thinking that his own authority sufficed for the maintenance of\nthe general good in Treby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n    Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand\n    Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore\n    Alone upon the threshold of my door\n    Of individual life. I shall command\n    The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand\n    Serenely in the sunshine as before\n    Without the sense of that which I forbore--\n    Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land\n    Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine\n    With pulses that beat double. What I do\n    And what I dream include thee, as the wine\n    Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue\n    God for myself, He hears that name of thine,\n    And sees within my eyes the tears of two.\n\n                                            --MRS. BROWNING.\n\n\nFelix Holt, seated at his work without his pupils, who had asked for a\nholiday with a notion that the wooden booths promised some sort of show,\nnoticed about eleven o'clock that the noises which reached him from the\nmain street were getting more and more tumultuous. He had long seen bad\nauguries for this election, but, like all people who dread the prophetic\nwisdom that ends in desiring the fulfillment of its own evil\nforebodings, he had checked himself with remembering that, though many\nconditions were possible which might bring on violence, there were just\nas many which might avert it. There would, perhaps, be no other mischief\nthan what he was already certain of. With these thoughts he sat down\nquietly to his work, meaning not to vex his soul by going to look on at\nthings he would fain have made different if he could. But he was of a\nfiber that vibrated too strongly to the life around him to shut himself\naway in quiet, even from suffering and irremediable wrong. As the noises\ngrew louder, and wrought more and more strongly on his imagination, he\nwas obliged to lay down his delicate wheel-work. His mother came from\nher turnip-paring, in the kitchen, where little Job was her companion,\nto observe that they must be killing everybody in the High Street, and\nthat the election, which had never been before at Treby, must have come\nfor a judgment; that there were mercies where you didn't look for them,\nand that she thanked God in His wisdom for making her live up a back\nstreet.\n\nFelix snatched his cap and rushed out. But when he got to the turning\ninto the market-place the magistrates were already on horseback there,\nthe constables were moving about, and Felix observed that there was no\nstrong spirit of resistance to them. He stayed long enough to see the\npartial dispersion of the crowd and the restoration of tolerable quiet,\nand then went back to Mrs. Holt to tell her that there was nothing to\nfear now; he was going out again, and she must not be in any anxiety at\nhis absence. She might set by his dinner for him.\n\nFelix had been thinking of Esther and her probable alarm at the noises\nthat must have reached her more distinctly than they had reached him,\nfor Malthouse Yard was removed but a little way from the main street.\nMr. Lyon was away from home, having been called to preach charity\nsermons and attend meetings in a distant town; and Esther, with the\nplaintive Lyddy for her sole companion, was not cheerfully\ncircumstanced. Felix had not been to see her yet since her father's\ndeparture, but to-day he gave way to new reasons.\n\n\"Miss Esther was in the garret,\" Lyddy said, trying to see what was\ngoing on. But before she was fetched she came running down the stairs,\ndrawn by the knock at the door, which had shaken the small dwelling.\n\n\"I am so thankful to see you,\" she said, eagerly. \"Pray come in.\"\n\nWhen she had shut the parlor door behind them, Felix said, \"I suspected\nthat you might have been made anxious by the noises. I came to tell you\nthat things are quiet now. Though, indeed, you can hear that they are.\"\n\n\"I _was_ frightened,\" said Esther. \"The shouting and roaring of rude men\nis so hideous. It is a relief to me that my father is not at home--that\nhe is out of the reach of any danger he might have fallen into if he had\nbeen here. But I gave you credit for being in the midst of the danger,\"\nshe added, smiling, with a determination not to show much feeling. \"Sit\ndown and tell me what has happened.\"\n\nThey sat down at the extremities of the old black sofa, and Felix said--\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I had shut myself up, and tried to be as\nindifferent to the election as if I'd been one of the fishes in the\nLapp, till the noises got too strong for me. But I only saw the tail end\nof the disturbance. The poor noisy simpletons seemed to give way before\nthe magistrates and the constables. I hope nobody has been much hurt.\nThe fear is that they may turn out again by-and-by; their giving way so\nsoon may not be altogether a good sign. There's a great number of heavy\nfellows in the town. If they go and drink more, the last end may be\nworse than the first. However----\"\n\nFelix broke off, as if this talk was futile, clasped his hands behind\nhis head, and, leaning backward, looked at Esther, who was looking at\nhim.\n\n\"May I stay here a little while?\" he said, after a moment, which seemed\nlong.\n\n\"Pray do,\" said Esther, coloring. To relieve herself she took some work\nand bowed her head over her stitching. It was in reality a little heaven\nto her that Felix was there, but she saw beyond it--saw that by-and-by\nhe would be gone, and that they should be farther on their way, not\ntoward meeting, but parting. His will was impregnable. He was a rock,\nand she was no more to him than the white clinging mist-cloud.\n\n\"I wish I could be sure that you see things just as I do,\" he said\nabruptly, after a minute's silence.\n\n\"I am sure you see them much more wisely than I do!\" said Esther, almost\nbitterly, without looking up.\n\n\"There are some people one must wish to judge truly. Not to wish it\nwould be mere hardness. I know you think I am a man without feeling--at\nleast, without strong affections. You think I love nothing but my own\nresolutions.\"\n\n\"Suppose I reply in the same sort of strain?\" said Esther, with a little\ntoss of the head.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Why, that you think me a shallow woman, incapable of believing what is\nbest in you, setting down everything that is too high for me as a\ndeficiency.\"\n\n\"Don't parry what I say. Answer me.\" There was an expression of painful\nbeseeching in the tone with which Felix said this. Esther let her work\nfall on her lap and looked at him, but she was unable to speak.\n\n\"I want you to tell me--once--that you know it would be easier to me to\ngive myself up to loving and being loved, as other men do, when they\ncan, than to----\"\n\nThis breaking-off in speech was something quite new in Felix. For the\nfirst time he had lost his self-possession, and turned his eyes away. He\nwas at variance with himself. He had begun what he felt he ought not to\nfinish.\n\nEsther, like a woman as she was--a woman waiting for love, never able\nto ask for it--had her joy in these signs of her power; but they made\nher generous, not chary, as they might have done if she had had a\npettier disposition. She said, with deep yet timid earnestness--\n\n\"What you have chosen to do has only convinced me that your love would\nbe the better worth having.\"\n\nAll the finest part of Esther's nature trembled in those words. To be\nright in great memorable moments is perhaps the thing we need most\ndesire for ourselves.\n\nFelix as quick as lightning turned his look upon her again, and, leaning\nforward, took her sweet hand and held it to his lips some moments before\nhe let it fall again and raised his head.\n\n\"We shall always be the better for thinking of each other,\" he said,\nleaning his elbow on the back of the sofa, and supporting his head as he\nlooked at her with calm sadness. \"This thing can never come to me twice\nover. It is my knighthood. That was always a business of great cost.\"\n\nHe smiled at her, but she sat biting her inner lip and pressing her\nhands together. She desired to be worthy of what she reverenced in\nFelix, but the inevitable renunciation was too difficult. She saw\nherself wandering through the future weak and forsaken. The charming\nsauciness was all gone from her face, but the memory of it made this\nchildlike dependent sorrow all the more touching.\n\n\"Tell me what you would----\" Felix burst out, leaning nearer to her; but\nthe next instant he started up, went to the table, took his cap in his\nhand and came in front of her.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said, very gently, not daring to put out his hand. But\nEsther put up hers instead of speaking. He just pressed it and then went\naway.\n\nShe heard the doors close behind him, and felt free to be miserable. She\ncried bitterly. If she might have married Felix Holt, she could have\nbeen a good woman. She felt no trust that she could ever be good without\nhim.\n\nFelix reproached himself. He would have done better not to speak in that\nway. But the prompting to which he had chiefly listened had been the\ndesire to prove to Esther that he set a high value on her feelings. He\ncould not help seeing that he was very important to her; and he was too\nsimple and sincere a man to ape a sort of humility which would not have\nmade him any the better if he had possessed it. Such pretences turn our\nlives into sorry dramas. And Felix wished Esther to know that her love\nwas dear to him as the beloved dead are dear. He felt that they must\nnot marry--that they would ruin each other's lives. But he had longed\nfor her to know fully that his will to be always apart from her was\nrenunciation, not an easy preference. In this he was thoroughly\ngenerous; and yet, now some subtle, mysterious conjuncture of\nimpressions and circumstances had made him speak, he questioned the\nwisdom of what he had done. Express confessions give definiteness to\nmemories that might more easily melt away without; and Felix felt for\nEsther's pain as the strong soldier, who can march on hungering without\nfear that he shall faint, feels for the young brother--the\nmaiden-cheeked conscript whose load is too heavy for him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n    Mischief, thou art afoot.--_Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar._\n\n\nFelix could not go home again immediately after quitting Esther. He got\nout of the town, skirted it a little while, looking across the December\nstillness of the fields, and then re-entered it by the main road into\nthe market-place, thinking that, after all, it would be better for him\nto look at the busy doings of men than to listen in solitude to the\nvoices within him; and he wished to know how things were going on.\n\nIt was now nearly half-past one, and Felix perceived that the street was\nfilling with more than the previous crowd. By the time he got in front\nof the booths, he was himself so surrounded by men who were being thrust\nhither and thither that retreat would have been impossible; and he went\nwhere he was obliged to go, although his height and strength were above\nthe average even in a crowd where there were so many heavy-armed workmen\nused to the pickaxe. Almost all shabby-coated Trebians must have been\nthere, but the entries and back streets of the town did not supply the\nmass of the crowd; and besides the rural incomers, both of the more\ndecent and the rougher sort, Felix, as he was pushed along, thought he\ndiscerned here and there men of that keener aspect which is only common\nin manufacturing towns.\n\nBut at present there was no evidence of any distinctly mischievous\ndesign. There was only evidence that the majority of the crowd were\nexcited with drink, and that their action could hardly be calculated on\nmore than those of the oxen and pigs congregated amidst hootings and\npushings. The confused deafening shouts, the incidental fighting, the\nknocking over, pulling and scuffling, seemed to increase every moment.\nSuch of the constables as were mixed with the crowd were quite helpless;\nand if an official staff was seen above the heads, it moved about\nfitfully, showing as little sign of a guiding hand as the summit of a\nbuoy on the waves. Doubtless many hurts and bruises had been received,\nbut no one could know the amount of injuries that were widely scattered.\n\nIt was clear that no more voting could be done, and the poll had been\nadjourned. The probabilities of serious mischief had grown strong enough\nto prevail over the rector's objection to getting military aid within\nreach; and when Felix re-entered the town, a galloping messenger had\nalready been dispatched to Duffield. The rector wished to ride out\nagain, and read the Riot Act from a point where he could be better heard\nthan from the window of the Marquis; but Mr. Crow, the high\nconstable, who had returned from closer observation, insisted that the\nrisk would be too great. New special constables had been sworn in, but\nMr. Crow said prophetically that if once mischief began, the mob was\npast caring for constables.\n\nBut the rector's voice was ringing and penetrating, and when he appeared\non the narrow balcony and read the formula, commanding all men to go to\ntheir homes or about their lawful business, there was a strong transient\neffect. Every one within hearing listened, and for a few moments after\nthe final words, \"God save the King!\" the comparative silence continued.\nThen the people began to move, the buzz rose again, and grew, and grew,\ntill it turned to shouts and roaring as before. The movement was that of\na flood hemmed in; it carried nobody away. Whether the crowd would obey\nthe order to disperse themselves within an hour, was a doubt that\napproached nearer to a negative certainty.\n\nPresently Mr. Crow, who called himself a tactician, took a\nwell-intentioned step, which went far to fulfill his own prophecy. He\nhad arrived with the magistrates by a back way at the Seven Stars, and\nhere again the Riot Act was read from a window, with much the same\nresult as before. The rector had returned by the same way to the\nMarquis, as the headquarters most suited for administration, but Mr.\nCrow remained at the other extremity of King Street, where some\nawe-striking presence was certainly needed. Seeing that the time was\npassing, and all effect from the voice of law had disappeared, he showed\nhimself at an upper window, and addressed the crowd, telling them that\nthe soldiers had been sent for, and that if they did not disperse they\nwould have cavalry upon them instead of constables.\n\nMr. Crow, like some other high constables more celebrated in history,\n\"enjoyed a bad reputation\"; that is to say, he enjoyed many things which\ncaused his reputation to be bad, and he was anything but popular in\nTreby. It is probable that a pleasant message would have lost something\nfrom his lips, and what he actually said was so unpleasant that, instead\nof persuading the crowd, it appeared to enrage them. Some one, snatching\na raw potato from a sack in the green-grocer's shop behind him, threw it\nat the constable, and hit him on the mouth. Straightway raw potatoes and\nturnips were flying by twenties at the windows of the Seven Stars, and\nthe panes were smashed. Felix, who was half-way up the street, heard the\nvoices turning to a savage roar, and saw a rush toward the hardware\nshop, which furnished more effective weapons and missiles than turnips\nand potatoes. Then a cry ran along that the Tories had sent for the\nsoldiers, and if those among the mob who called themselves Tories as\nwillingly as anything else were disposed to take whatever called itself\nthe Tory side, they only helped the main result of reckless disorder.\n\nBut there were proofs that the predominant will of the crowd was against\n\"Debarry's men,\" and in favor of Transome. Several shops were invaded,\nand they were all of them \"Tory shops.\" The tradesmen who could do so\nnow locked their doors and barricaded their windows within. There was a\npanic among the householders of this hitherto peaceful town, and a\ngeneral anxiety for the military to arrive. The rector was in painful\nanxiety on this head; he had sent out two messengers as secretly as he\ncould toward Hathercote, to order the soldiers to ride straight to the\ntown; but he feared that these messengers had been somehow intercepted.\n\nIt was three o'clock; more than an hour had elapsed since the reading of\nthe Riot Act. The rector of Treby Magna wrote an indignant message and\nsent it to the Ram, to Mr. Lingon, the rector of Little Treby, saying\nthat there was evidently a Radical animus in the mob, and that Mr.\nTransome's party should hold themselves peculiarly responsible. Where\nwas Mr. Jermyn?\n\nMr. Lingon replied that he was going himself out toward Duffield to see\nafter the soldiers. As for Jermyn, he was not that attorney's sponsor;\nhe believed that Jermyn was gone away somewhere on business--to fetch\nvoters.\n\nA serious effort was now being made by all the civil force at command.\nThe December day would soon be passing into evening, and all disorder\nwould be aggravated by obscurity. The horrors of fire were as likely to\nhappen as any minor evil. The constables, as many of them as could do\nso, armed themselves with carbines and sabres; all the respectable\ninhabitants who had any courage, prepared themselves to struggle for\norder; and many felt with Mr. Wace and Mr. Tiliot that the nearest duty\nwas to defend the breweries and the spirit and wine vaults, where the\nproperty was of a sort at once most likely to be threatened and most\ndangerous in its effects. The rector, with fine determination, got on\nhorseback again, as the best mode of leading the constables, who could\nonly act efficiently in a close body. By his direction the column of\narmed men avoided the main street, and made their way along a back road,\nthat they might occupy the two chief lanes leading into the wine-vaults\nof the brewery, and bear down on the crowd from these openings, which it\nwas especially desirable to guard.\n\nMeanwhile Felix Holt had been hotly occupied in King Street. After the\nfirst window-smashing at the Seven Stars, there was a sufficient reason\nfor damaging that inn to the utmost. The destructive spirit tends toward\ncompleteness; and any object once maimed or otherwise injured, is as\nreadily doomed by unreasoning men as by unreasoning boys. Also the Seven\nStars sheltered Spratt; and to some Sproxton men in front of that inn it\nwas exasperating that Spratt should be safe and sound on a day when\nblows were going, and justice might be rendered. And again, there was\nthe general desirableness of being inside a public house.\n\nFelix had at last been willingly urged on to this spot. Hitherto swayed\nby the crowd, he had been able to do nothing but defend himself and keep\non his legs; but he foresaw that the people would burst into the inn; he\nheard cries of \"Spratt!\" \"Fetch him out!\" \"We'll pitch him out!\" \"Pummel\nhim!\" It was not unlikely that lives might be sacrificed; and it was\nintolerable to Felix to be witnessing the blind outrages of this mad\ncrowd, and yet be doing nothing to counteract them. Even some vain\neffort would satisfy him better than mere gazing. Within the walls of\nthe inn he might save some one. He went in with a miscellaneous set, who\ndispersed themselves with different objects--some to the tap-room, and\nto search for the cellar: some up-stairs to search in all the rooms for\nSpratt, or any one else, perhaps, as a temporary scapegoat for Spratt.\nGuided by the screams of women, Felix at last got to a high up-stairs\npassage, where the landlady and some of her servants were running away\nin helpless terror from two or three half-tipsy men, who had been\nemptying a spirit decanter in the bar. Assuming the tone of a mob-leader\nhe cried out, \"Here, boys, here's better fun this way--come with me!\"\nand drew the men back with him along the passage. They reached the lower\nstaircase in time to see the unhappy Spratt being dragged, coatless and\nscreaming, down the steps. No one at present was striking or kicking\nhim; it seemed as if he were being reserved for punishment on some wider\narea, where the satisfaction might be more generally shared. Felix\nfollowed close, determined, if he could, to rescue both assailers and\nassaulted from the worst consequences. His mind was busy with possible\ndevices.\n\nDown the stairs, out along the stones through the gateway, Spratt was\ndragged as a mere heap of linen and cloth rags. When he was got outside\nthe gateway, there was an immense hooting and roaring, though many there\nhad no grudge against him, and only guessed that others had the grudge.\nBut this was the narrower part of the street; it widened as it went\nonward, and Spratt was dragged on, his enemies crying, \"We'll make a\nring--we'll see how frightened he looks!\"\n\n\"Kick him, and have done with him,\" Felix heard another say. \"Let's go\nto Tiliot's vaults--there's more gin there!\"\n\nHere were two hideous threats. In dragging Spratt onward the people were\ngetting very near to the lane leading up to Tiliot's. Felix kept as\nclose as he could to the threatened victim. He had thrown away his own\nstick, and carried a bludgeon which had escaped from the hands of an\ninvader at the Seven Stars; his head was bare; he looked, to\nundiscerning eyes, like a leading spirit of the mob. In this condition\nhe was observed by several persons looking anxiously from their upper\nwindows, and finally observed to push himself, by violent efforts, close\nbehind the dragged man.\n\nMeanwhile, the foremost among the constables, who, coming by the back\nway, had now reached the opening of Tiliot's lane, discerned that the\ncrowd had a victim amongst them. One spirited fellow, named Tucker, who\nwas a regular constable, feeling that no time was to be lost in\nmeditation, called on his neighbor to follow him, and with a sabre that\nhappened to be his weapon, got away for himself where he was not\nexpected, by dint of quick resolution. At this moment Spratt had been\nlet go--had been dropped, in fact, almost lifeless with terror, on the\nstreet stones, and the men round him had retreated for a little space,\nas if to amuse themselves with looking at him. Felix had taken his\nopportunity; and seeing the first step toward a plan he was bent on, he\nsprang forward close to the cowering Spratt. As he did this, Tucker had\ncut his way to the spot, and imagining Felix to be the destined\nexecutioner of Spratt--for any discrimination of Tucker's lay in his\nmuscles rather than his eyes--he rushed up to Felix, meaning to collar\nhim and throw him down. But Felix had rapid senses and quick thoughts;\nhe discerned the situation; he chose between two evils. Quick as\nlightning he frustrated the constable, fell upon him, and tried to\nmaster his weapon. In the struggle, which was watched without\ninterference, the constable fell undermost, and Felix got his weapon. He\nstarted up with the bare sabre in his hand. The crowd round him cried\n\"Hurray!\" with a sense that he was on their side against the constable.\nTucker did not rise immediately; but Felix did not imagine that he was\nmuch hurt.\n\n\"Don't touch him!\" said Felix. \"Let him go. Here, bring Spratt, and\nfollow me.\"\n\nFelix was perfectly conscious that he was in the midst of a tangled\nbusiness. But he had chiefly before his imagination the horrors that\nmight come if the mass of wild chaotic desires and impulses around him\nwere not diverted from any further attacks on places where they would\nget in the midst of intoxicating and inflammable materials. It was not a\nmoment in which a spirit like his could calculate the effect of\nmisunderstanding as to himself: nature never makes men who are at once\nenergetically sympathetic and minutely calculating. He believed he had\nthe power and was resolved to try, to carry the dangerous mass out of\nmischief till the military came to awe them--which he supposed, from Mr.\nCrow's announcement a long time ago, must be a near event.\n\nHe was followed the more willingly, because Tiliot's lane was seen by\nthe hindmost to be now defended by constables, some of whom had\nfirearms; and where there is no strong counter-movement, any proposition\nto do something that is unspecified stimulates stupid curiosity. To many\nof the Sproxton men who were within sight of him, Felix was known\npersonally, and vaguely believed to be a man who meant many queer\nthings, not at all of an everyday kind. Pressing along like a leader,\nwith the sabre in his hand, and inviting them to bring on Spratt, there\nseemed a better reason for following him than for doing anything else. A\nman with a definite will and an energetic personality acts as a sort of\nflag to draw and bind together the foolish units of a mob. It was on\nthis sort of influence over men whose mental state was a mere medley of\nappetites and confused impressions, that Felix had dared to count. He\nhurried them along with words of invitation, telling them to hold up\nSpratt and not drag him; and those behind followed him, with a growing\nbelief that he had some design worth knowing, while those in front were\nurged along partly by the same notion, partly by the sense that there\nwas a motive in those behind them, not knowing what the motive was. It\nwas that mixture of pushing forward and being pushed forward, which is a\nbrief history of most human things.\n\nWhat Felix really intended to do, was to get the crowd by the nearest\nway out of the town, and induce them to skirt it on the north side with\nhim, keeping up in them the idea that he was leading them to execute\nsome stratagem, by which they would surprise something worth attacking,\nand circumvent the constables who were defending the lanes. In the\nmeantime he trusted that the soldiers would have arrived, and with this\nsort of mob which was animated by no real political passion or fury\nagainst social distinctions, it was in the highest degree unlikely that\nthere would be any resistance to a military force. The presence of fifty\nsoldiers would probably be enough to scatter the rioting hundreds. How\nnumerous the mob was, no one ever knew: many inhabitants afterward were\nready to swear that there must have been at least two thousand rioters.\nFelix knew he was incurring great risks; but \"his blood was up\"; we\nhardly allow enough in common life for the results of that enkindled\npassionate enthusiasm which, under other conditions, makes world-famous\ndeeds.\n\nHe was making for a point where the street branched off on one side\ntoward a speedy opening between hedgerows, on the other toward the\nshabby wideness of Pollard's End. At this forking of the street there\nwas a large space, in the centre of which there was a small stone\nplatform, mounting by three steps, with an old green finger-post upon\nit. Felix went straight to this platform and stepped upon it, crying\n\"Halt!\" in a loud voice to the men behind and before him, and calling to\nthose who held Spratt to bring him there. All came to a stand with faces\ntoward the finger-post, and perhaps for the first time the extremities\nof the crowd got a definite idea that a man with a sabre in his hand was\ntaking the command.\n\n\"Now!\" said Felix, when Spratt had been brought to the stone platform,\nfaint and trembling, \"has anybody got cord? if not, handkerchiefs\nknotted fast; give them to me.\"\n\nHe drew out his own handkerchief, and two or three others were mustered\nand handed to him. He ordered them to be knotted together, while curious\neyes were fixed on him. Was he going to have Spratt hanged? Felix kept\nfast hold of his weapon, and ordered others to act.\n\n\"Now, put it round his waist, wind his arms in, draw them a little\nbackward--so! and tie it fast on the other side of the post.\"\n\nWhen that was done, Felix said, imperatively:\n\n\"Leave him there--we shall come back to him; let us make haste; march\nalong, lads! Up Park Street and down Hobb's Lane.\"\n\nIt was the best chance he could think of for saving Spratt's life. And\nhe succeeded. The pleasure of seeing the helpless man tied up sufficed\nfor the moment, if there were any who had ferocity enough to count much\non coming back to him. Nobody's imagination represented the certainty\nthat some one out of the houses at hand would soon come and untie him\nwhen he was left alone.\n\nAnd the rioters pushed up Park Street, a noisy stream, with Felix still\nin the midst of them, though he was laboring hard to get his way to the\nfront. He wished to determine the course of the crowd along a by-road\ncalled Hobb's Lane, which would have taken them to the other--the\nDuffield end of the town. He urged several of the men round him, one of\nwhom was no less a person than the big Dredge, our old Sproxton\nacquaintance, to get forward, and be sure that all the fellows would go\ndown the lane, else they would spoil sport. Hitherto Felix had been\nsuccessful, and he had gone along with an unbroken impulse. But soon\nsomething occurred which brought with a terrible shock the sense that\nhis plan might turn out to be as mad as all bold projects are seen to be\nwhen they have failed.\n\nMingled with the more headlong and half-drunken crowd there were some\nsharp-visaged men who loved the irrationality of riots for something\nelse than its own sake, and who at present were not so much the richer\nas they desired to be, for the pains they had taken in coming to the\nTreby election, induced by certain prognostics gathered at Duffield on\nthe nomination-day that there might be the conditions favorable to that\nconfusion which was always a harvest-time. It was known to some of these\nsharp men that Park Street led out toward the grand house of Treby\nManor, which was as good--nay, better, for their purpose than the bank.\nWhile Felix was entertaining his ardent purpose, these other sons of\nAdam were entertaining another ardent purpose of their peculiar sort,\nand the moment had come when they were to have their triumph.\n\nFrom the front ranks backward toward Felix there ran a new summons--a\nnew invitation.\n\n\"Let us go to Treby Manor!\"\n\nFrom that moment Felix was powerless; a new definite suggestion overrode\nhis vaguer influence. There was a determined rush past Hobb's Lane, and\nnot down it. Felix was carried along too. He did not know whether to\nwish the contrary. Once on the road, out of town, with openings into\nfields and with the wide park at hand, it would have been easy to\nliberate himself from the crowd. At first it seemed to him the better\npart to do this, and to get back to the town as fast as he could, in the\nhope of finding the military and getting a detachment to come and save\nthe Manor. But he reflected that the course of the mob had been\nsufficiently seen, and that there were plenty of people in Park Street\nto carry the information faster than he could. It seemed more necessary\nthat he should secure the presence of some help for the family at the\nManor by going there himself. The Debarrys were not of the class of\npeople he was wont to be anxious about; but Felix Holt's conscience was\nalive to the accusation that any danger they might be in now was brought\non by a deed of his. In these moments of bitter vexation and\ndisappointment, it did occur to him that very unpleasant consequences\nmight be hanging over him of a kind quite different from inward\ndissatisfaction; but it was useless now to think of averting such\nconsequences. As he was pressed along with the multitude into Treby\nPark, his very movement seemed to him only an image of the day's\nfatalities, in which the multitudinous small wickednesses of small\nselfish ends, really undirected toward any larger result, had issued in\nwidely-shared mischief that might yet be hideous.\n\n[Illustration: FELIX WOUNDED IN THE RIOT.]\n\nThe light was declining: already the candles shone through many windows\nof the Manor. Already the foremost part of the crowd had burst into the\noffices, and adroit men were busy in the right places to find plate,\nafter setting others to force the butler into unlocking the cellars; and\nFelix had only just been able to force his way on to the front terrace,\nwith the hope of getting to the rooms where he would find the ladies of\nthe household and comfort them with the assurance that rescue must\nsoon come, when the sound of horses' feet convinced him that the rescue\nwas nearer than he had expected. Just as he heard the horses, he had\napproached the large window of a room where a brilliant light suspended\nfrom the ceiling showed him a group of women clinging together in\nterror. Others of the crowd were pushing their way up the terrace-steps\nand gravel-slopes at various points. Hearing the horses, he kept his\npost in front of the window, and, motioning with his sabre, cried out to\nthe oncomers, \"Keep back! I hear the soldiers coming.\" Some scrambled\nback, some paused automatically.\n\nThe louder and louder sound of the hoofs changed its pace and\ndistribution. \"Halt! Fire!\" Bang! bang! bang!--came deafening the ears\nof the men on the terrace.\n\nBefore they had time or nerve to move, there was a rushing sound closer\nto them--again \"Fire!\" a bullet whizzed, and passed through Felix Holt's\nshoulder--the shoulder of the arm that held the naked weapon which shone\nin the light from the window.\n\nFelix fell. The rioters ran confusedly, like terrified sheep. Some of\nthe soldiers, turning, drove them along with the flat of their swords.\nThe greater difficulty was to clear the invaded offices.\n\nThe rector, who with another magistrate and several other gentlemen on\nhorseback had accompanied the soldiers, now jumped on to the terrace,\nand hurried to the ladies of the family.\n\nPresently there was a group round Felix, who had fainted, and, reviving,\nhad fainted again. He had had little food during the day, and had been\noverwrought. Two of the group were civilians, but only one of them knew\nFelix, the other being a magistrate not resident in Treby. The one who\nknew Felix was Mr. John Johnson, whose zeal for the public peace had\nbrought him from Duffield when he heard that the soldiers were summoned.\n\n\"I know this man very well,\" said Mr. Johnson. \"He is a dangerous\ncharacter--quite revolutionary.\"\n\nIt was a weary night; and the next day, Felix, whose wound was declared\ntrivial, was lodged in Loamford Jail. There were three charges against\nhim: that he had assaulted a constable, that he had committed\nmanslaughter (Tucker was dead from spinal concussion), and that he had\nled a riotous onslaught on a dwelling-house.\n\nFour other men were committed: one of them for possessing himself of a\ngold cup with the Debarry arms on it; the three others, one of whom was\nthe collier Dredge, for riot and assault.\n\nThat morning Treby town was no longer in terror; but it was in much\nsadness. Other men, more innocent than the hated Spratt, were groaning\nunder severe bodily injuries. And poor Tucker's corpse was not the only\none that had been lifted from the pavement. It is true that none grieved\nmuch for the other dead man, unless it be grief to say, \"Poor old\nfellow!\" He had been trampled upon, doubtless, where he fell drunkenly,\nnear the entrance of the Seven Stars. This second corpse was old Tommy\nTrounsem, the bill-sticker--otherwise Thomas Transome, the last of a\nvery old family-line.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n    The fields are hoary with December's frost,\n    I too am hoary with the chills of age.\n    But through the fields and through the untrodden woods\n    Is rest and stillness--only in my heart\n    The pall of winter shrouds a throbbing life.\n\n\nA week after that Treby riot, Harold Transome was at Transome Court. He\nhad returned from a hasty visit to town to keep his Christmas at this\ndelightful country home, not in the best Christmas spirits. He had lost\nthe election; but if that had been his only annoyance, he had good humor\nand good sense enough to have borne it as well as most men, and to have\npaid the eight or nine thousand, which had been the price of\nascertaining that he was not to sit in the next Parliament, without\nuseless grumbling. But the disappointments of life can never, any more\nthan its pleasures, be estimated singly; and the healthiest and most\nagreeable of men is exposed to that coincidence of various vexations,\neach heightening the effect of the other, which may produce in him\nsomething corresponding to the spontaneous and externally unaccountable\nmoodiness of the morbid and disagreeable.\n\nHarold might not have grieved much at a small riot in Treby, even if it\nhad caused some expenses to fall on the county; but the turn which the\nriot had actually taken was a bitter morsel for rumination, on more\ngrounds than one. However the disturbances had arisen and been\naggravated--and probably no one knew the whole truth on these\npoints--the conspicuous, gravest incidents had all tended to throw the\nblame on the Radical party, that is to say, on Transome and on\nTransome's agents; and so far the candidateship and its results had done\nHarold dishonor in the county: precisely the opposite effect to that\nwhich was a dear object of his ambition. More than this, Harold's\nconscience was active enough to be very unpleasantly affected by what\nhad befallen Felix Holt. His memory, always good, was particularly vivid\nin its retention of Felix Holt's complaint to him about the treating of\nthe Sproxton men, and of the subsequent irritating scene in Jermyn's\noffice, when the personage with the inauspicious name of Johnson had\nexpounded to him the impossibility of revising an electioneering scheme\nonce begun, and of turning your vehicle back when it had already begun\nto roll downhill. Remembering Felix Holt's words of indignant warning\nabout hiring men with drink in them to make a noise, Harold could not\nresist the urgent impression that the offences for which Felix was\ncommitted were fatalities, not brought about by any willing co-operation\nof his with the noisy rioters, but arising probably from some rather\nill-judged efforts to counteract their violence. And this urgent\nimpression, which insisted on growing into a conviction, became in one\nof its phases an uneasy sense that he held evidence which would at once\ntend to exonerate Felix and to place himself and his agents in anything\nbut a desirable light. It was likely that some one else could give\nequivalent evidence in favor of Felix--the little talkative Dissenting\npreacher, for example: but, anyhow, the affair with the Sproxton men\nwould be ripped open and made the worst of by the opposite parties. The\nman who has failed in the use of some indirectness, is helped very\nlittle by the fact that his rivals are men to whom that indirectness is\na something human, very far from being alien. There remains this grand\ndistinction, that he has failed, and that the jet of light is thrown\nentirely on his misdoings.\n\nIn this matter Harold felt himself a victim. Could he hinder the tricks\nof his agents? In this particular case he had tried to hinder them, and\nhad tried in vain. He had not loved the two agents in question, to begin\nwith; and now at this later stage of events he was more innocent than\never of bearing them anything but the most sincere ill-will. He was more\nutterly exasperated with them than he would probably have been if his\none great passion had been for public virtue. Jermyn, with his John\nJohnson, had added this ugly, dirty business of the Treby election to\nall the long-accumulating list of offences, which Harold was resolved to\nvisit on him to the utmost. He had seen some handbills carrying the\ninsinuation that there was a discreditable indebtedness to Jermyn on\nthe part of the Transomes. If any such notions existed apart from\nelectioneering slander, there was all the more reason for letting the\nworld see Jermyn severely punished for abusing his power over the family\naffairs, and tampering with the family property. And the world certainly\nshould see this with as little delay as possible. The cool, confident,\nassuming fellow should be bled to the last drop in compensation, and all\nconnection with him be finally got rid of. Now that the election was\ndone with, Harold meant to devote himself to private affairs, till\neverything lay in complete order under his supervision.\n\nThis morning he was seated as usual in his private room, which had now\nbeen handsomely fitted up for him. It was but the third morning after\nthe first Christmas he had spent in his English home for fifteen years,\nand the home looked like an eminently desirable one. The white frost was\nnow lying on the broad lawn, on the many-formed leaves of the evergreens\nand on the giant trees at a distance. Logs of dry oak blazed on the\nhearth; the carpet was like warm moss under his feet; he had breakfasted\njust according to his taste, and he had the interesting occupations of a\nlarge proprietor to fill the morning. All through the house now steps\nwere noiseless on carpets or on fine matting; there was warmth in hall\nand corridors; there were servants enough to do everything, and to do it\nat the right time. Skilful Dominic was always at hand to meet his\nmaster's demands, and his bland presence diffused itself like a smile\nover the household, infecting the gloomy English mind with the belief\nthat life was easy, and making his real predominance seem as soft and\nlight as a down quilt. Old Mr. Transome had gathered new courage and\nstrength since little Harry and Dominic had come, and since Harold had\ninsisted on his taking drives. Mrs. Transome herself was seen on a fresh\nbackground with a gown of rich new stuff. And if, in spite of this, she\ndid not seem happy, Harold either did not observe it, or kindly ignored\nit as the necessary frailty of elderly women whose lives have had too\nmuch of dullness and privation. Our minds get tricks and attitudes as\nour bodies do, thought Harold, and age stiffens them into\nunalterableness. \"Poor mother! I confess I should not like to be an\nelderly woman myself. One requires a good deal of the purring cat for\nthat, or else of the loving gran-dame. I wish she would take more to\nlittle Harry. I suppose she has her suspicions about the lad's mother,\nand is as rigid in those matters as in her Toryism. However, I do what\nI can; it would be difficult to say what there is wanting to her in the\nway of indulgence and luxury to make up for the old niggardly life.\"\n\nAnd certainly Transome Court was now such a home as many women would\ncovet. Yet even Harold's own satisfaction in the midst of its elegant\ncomfort needed at present to be sustained by the expectation of\ngratified resentment. He was obviously less bright and enjoying than\nusual, and his mother, who watched him closely without daring to ask\nquestions, had gathered hints and drawn inferences enough to make her\nfeel sure that there was some storm gathering between him and Jermyn.\nShe did not dare to ask questions, and yet she had not resisted the\ntemptation to say something bitter about Harold's failure to get\nreturned as a Radical, helping, with feminine self-defeat, to exclude\nherself more completely from any consultation by him. In this way poor\nwomen, whose power lies solely in their influence, make themselves like\nmusic out of tune, and only move men to run away.\n\nThis morning Harold had ordered his letters to be brought to him at the\nbreakfast-table, which was not his usual practice. His mother could see\nthat there were London business letters about which he was eager, and\nshe had found out that the letter brought by a clerk the day before was\nto make an appointment with Harold for Jermyn to come to Transome Court\nat eleven this morning. She observed Harold swallow his coffee and push\naway his plate with an early abstraction from the business of breakfast\nwhich was not at all after his usual manner. She herself ate nothing:\nher sips of tea seemed to excite her; her cheeks flushed, and her hands\nwere cold. She was still young and ardent in her terrors; the passions\nof the past were living in her dread.\n\nWhen Harold left the table she went into the long drawing-room, where\nshe might relieve her restlessness by walking up and down, and catch the\nsound of Jermyn's entrance into Harold's room, which was close by. Here\nshe moved to and fro amongst the rose-colored satin of chairs and\ncurtains--the great story of this world reduced for her to the little\ntale of her own existence--dull obscurity everywhere, except where the\nkeen light fell on the narrow track of her own lot, wide only for a\nwoman's anguish. At last she heard the expected ring and footstep, and\nthe opening and closing door. Unable to walk about any longer, she sank\ninto a large cushioned chair, helpless and prayerless. She was not\nthinking of God's anger or mercy, but of her son's. She was thinking of\nwhat might be brought, not by death, but by life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n    _M._  Check to your queen!\n\n    _N._                      Nay, your own king is bare,\n          And moving so, you give yourself checkmate.\n\n\nWhen Jermyn entered the room, Harold, who was seated at his library\ntable examining papers, with his back toward the light and his face\ntoward the door, moved his head coldly. Jermyn said an ungracious\n\"Good-morning,\"--as little as possible like a salutation to one who\nmight regard himself as a patron. On the attorney's handsome face there\nwas a black cloud of defiant determination slightly startling to Harold,\nwho had expected to feel that the overpowering weight of temper in the\ninterview was on his own side. Nobody was ever prepared beforehand for\nthis expression of Jermyn's face, which seemed as strongly contrasted\nwith the cold impenetrableness which he preserved under the ordinary\nannoyance of business as with the bland radiance of his lighter moments.\n\nHarold himself did not look amiable just then, but his anger was of the\nsort that seeks a vent without waiting to give a fatal blow; it was that\nof a nature more subtly mixed than Jermyn's--less animally forcible,\nless unwavering in selfishness, and with more of high-bred pride. He\nlooked at Jermyn with increased disgust and secret wonder.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said curtly.\n\nJermyn seated himself in silence, opened his greatcoat, and took some\npapers from a side pocket.\n\n\"I have written to Makepeace,\" said Harold, \"to tell him to take the\nentire management of the election expenses. So you will transmit your\naccounts to him.\"\n\n\"Very well. I am come this morning on other business.\"\n\n\"If it's about the riot and the prisoners, I have only to say that I\nshall enter into no plans. If I am called on, I shall say what I know\nabout that young fellow Felix Holt. People may prove what they can about\nJohnson's damnable tricks, or yours either.\"\n\n\"I am not come to speak about the riot. I agree with you in thinking\nthat quite a subordinate subject.\" (When Jermyn had the black cloud over\nhis face, he never hesitated or drawled, and made no Latin quotations.)\n\n\"Be so good, then, as to open your business at once,\" said Harold, in a\ntone of imperious indifference.\n\n\"That is precisely what I wish to do. I have here information from a\nLondon correspondent that you are about to file a bill against me in\nChancery.\" Jermyn, as he spoke, laid his hand on the papers before him,\nand looked straight at Harold.\n\n\"In that case, the question for you is, how far your conduct as the\nfamily solicitor will bear investigation. But it is a question which you\nwill consider quite apart from me.\"\n\n\"Doubtless. But prior to that there is a question which we must consider\ntogether.\"\n\nThe tone in which Jermyn said this gave an unpleasant shock to Harold's\nsense of mastery. Was it possible that he should have the weapon\nwrenched out of his hand?\n\n\"I shall know what to think of that,\" he replied, as haughtily as ever,\n\"when you have stated what the question is.\"\n\n\"Simply, whether you will choose to retain the family estates, or lay\nyourself open to be forthwith legally deprived of them.\"\n\n\"I presume you refer to some underhand scheme of your own, on a par with\nthe annuities you have drained us by in the name of Johnson,\" said\nHarold, feeling a new movement of anger. \"If so, you had better state\nyour scheme to my lawyers, Dymock and Halliwell.\"\n\n\"No. I think you will approve of my stating in your own ear first of\nall, that it depends on my will whether you remain an important landed\nproprietor in North Loamshire, or whether you retire from the country\nwith the remainder of the fortune you have acquired in trade.\"\n\nJermyn paused, as if to leave time for this morsel to be tasted.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Harold, sharply.\n\n\"Not any scheme of mine; but a state of the facts resulting from the\nsettlement of the estate made in 1729: state of the facts which renders\nyour father's title and your own title to the family estates utterly\nworthless as soon as the claimant is made aware of his right.\"\n\n\"And you intend to inform him?\"\n\n\"That depends. I am the only person who has the requisite knowledge. It\nrests with you to decide whether I shall use that knowledge against you;\nor whether I shall use it in your favor by putting an end to the\nevidence that would serve to oust you in spite of your 'robust title of\noccupancy.'\"\n\nJermyn paused again. He had been speaking slowly, but without the least\nhesitation, and with a bitter definiteness of enunciation. There was a\nmoment or two before Harold answered, and then he said abruptly--\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"I thought you were more shrewd,\" said Jermyn, with a touch of scorn. \"I\nthought you understood that I had had too much experience to waste my\ntime in telling fables to persuade a man who has put himself into the\nattitude of my deadly enemy.\"\n\n\"Well, then, say at once what your proofs are,\" said Harold, shaking in\nspite of himself, and getting nervous.\n\n\"I have no inclination to be lengthy. It is not more than a few weeks\nsince I ascertained that there is in existence an heir of the Bycliffes,\nthe old adversaries of your family. More curiously, it is only a few\ndays ago--in fact, only since the day of the riot--that the Bycliffe\nclaim has become valid, and that the right of remainder accrues to the\nheir in question.\"\n\n\"And how, pray?\" said Harold, rising from his chair, and making a turn\nin the room, with his hands thrust in his pockets. Jermyn rose too, and\nstood near the hearth, facing Harold, as he moved to and fro.\n\n\"By the death of an old fellow who got drunk and was trampled to death\nin the riot. He was the last of that Thomas Transome's line, by the\npurchase of whose interest your family got its title to the estate. Your\ntitle died with him. It was supposed that the line had become extinct\nbefore--and on that supposition the old Bycliffes founded their claim.\nBut I hunted up this man just about the time the last suit was closed.\nHis death would have been of no consequence to you if there had not been\na Bycliffe in existence; but I happen to know that there is, and that\nthe fact can be legally proved.\"\n\nFor a minute or two Harold did not speak, but continued to pace the\nroom, while Jermyn kept his position, holding his hands behind him. At\nlast Harold said, from the other end of the room, speaking in a scornful\ntone--\n\n\"That sounds alarming. But it is not to be proved simply by your\nstatement.\"\n\n\"Clearly. I have here a document, with a copy which will back my\nstatement. It is the opinion given on the case more than twenty years\nago, and it bears the signature of the Attorney-General and the first\nconveyancer of the day.\"\n\nJermyn took up the papers he had laid on the table, opening them slowly\nand coolly as he went on speaking, and as Harold advanced toward him.\n\n\"You may suppose that we spared no pains to ascertain the state of the\ntitle in the last suit against Maurice Christian Bycliffe, which\nthreatened to be a hard run. This document is the result of a\nconsultation; it gives an opinion which must be taken as a final\nauthority. You may cast your eyes over that, if you please; I will wait\nyour time. Or you may read the summing-up here,\" Jermyn ended, holding\nout one of the papers to Harold, and pointing to a final passage.\n\nHarold took the paper with a slight gesture of impatience. He did not\nchoose to obey Jermyn's indication, and confine himself to the\nsumming-up. He ran through the document. But in truth he was too much\nexcited really to follow the details, and was rather acting than\nreading, till at once he threw himself into his chair and consented to\nbend his attention on the passage to which Jermyn had pointed. The\nattorney watched him as he read and twice re-read:--\n\n    To sum up----we are of opinion that the title of the present\n    possessors of the Transome estate can be strictly proved to rest\n    solely upon a base fee created under the original settlement of\n    1729, and to be good so long only as issue exists of the tenant in\n    tail by whom that base fee was created. We feel satisfied by the\n    evidence that such issue exists in the person of Thomas Transome,\n    otherwise Trounsem, of Littleshaw. But upon his decease without\n    issue we are of opinion that the right in remainder of the Bycliffe\n    family will arise, which right would not be barred by any statute\n    of limitation.\n\nWhen Harold's eyes were on the signatures to this document for the third\ntime, Jermyn said--\n\n\"As it turned out, the case being closed by the death of the claimant,\nwe had no occasion for producing Thomas Transome, who was the old fellow\nI told you of. The enquiries about him set him agog, and after they were\ndropped he came into this neighborhood, thinking there was something\nfine in store for him. Here, if you like to take it, is a memorandum\nabout him. I repeat that he died in the riot. The proof is ready. And I\nrepeat, that, to my knowledge, and mine only, there is a Bycliffe in\nexistence; and that I know how the proof can be made out.\"\n\nHarold rose from his chair again, and again paced the room. He was not\nprepared with any defiance.\n\n\"And where is he--this Bycliffe?\" he said at last, stopping in his walk,\nand facing round toward Jermyn.\n\n\"I decline to say more till you promise to suspend proceedings against\nme.\"\n\nHarold turned again, and looked out of the window, without speaking, for\na moment or two. It was impossible that there should not be a conflict\nwithin him, and at present it was a very confused one. At last he said--\n\n\"This person is in ignorance of his claim?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Has been brought up in an inferior station?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jermyn, keen enough to guess part of what was going on in\nHarold's mind. \"There is no harm in leaving him in ignorance. The\nquestion is a purely legal one. And, as I said before, the complete\nknowledge of the case, as one of evidence, lies exclusively with me. I\ncan nullify the evidence, or I can make it tell with certainty against\nyou. The choice lies with you.\"\n\n\"I must have time to think of this,\" said Harold, conscious of a\nterrible pressure.\n\n\"I can give you no time unless you promise me to suspend proceedings.\"\n\n\"And then, when I ask you, you will lay the details before me?\"\n\n\"Not without a thorough understanding beforehand. If I engage not to use\nmy knowledge against you, you must engage in writing that on being\nsatisfied by the details, you will cancel all hostile proceedings\nagainst me, and will not institute fresh ones on the strength of any\noccurrences now past.\"\n\n\"Well, I must have time,\" said Harold, more than ever inclined to thrash\nthe attorney, but feeling bound hand and foot with knots that he was not\nsure he could ever unfasten.\n\n\"That is to say,\" said Jermyn, with his black-browed persistence, \"you\nwill write to suspend proceedings.\"\n\nAgain Harold paused. He was more than ever exasperated, but he was\nthreatened, mortified, and confounded by the necessity for an immediate\ndecision between alternatives almost equally hateful to him. It was with\ndifficulty that he could prevail on himself to speak any conclusive\nwords. He walked as far as he could from Jermyn--to the other end of the\nroom--then walked back to his chair and threw himself into it. At last\nhe said, without looking at Jermyn, \"I agree--I must have time.\"\n\n\"Very well. It is a bargain.\"\n\n\"No further than this,\" said Harold, hastily, flashing a look at\nJermyn--\"no further than this, that I require time, and therefore I give\nit to you.\"\n\n\"Of course. You require time to consider whether the pleasure of trying\nto ruin me--me to whom you are really indebted--is worth the loss of the\nTransome estates. I shall wish you good-morning.\"\n\nHarold did not speak to him or look at him again, and Jermyn walked out\nof the room. As he appeared outside the door and closed it behind him,\nMrs. Transome showed her white face at another door which opened on a\nlevel with Harold's in such a way that it was just possible for Jermyn\nnot to see her. He availed himself of that possibility, and walked\nstraight across the hall, where there was no servant in attendance to\nlet him out, as if he believed that no one was looking at him who could\nexpect recognition. He did not want to speak to Mrs. Transome at\npresent; he had nothing to ask from her, and one disagreeable interview\nhad been enough for him this morning.\n\nShe was convinced that he had avoided her, and she was too proud to\narrest him. She was as insignificant now in his eyes as in her son's.\n\"Men have no memories in their hearts,\" she said to herself, bitterly.\nAnd then turning into her sitting-room she heard the voices of Mr.\nTransome and little Harry at play together. She would have given a great\ndeal at this moment if her feeble husband had not always lived in dread\nof her temper and her tyranny, so that he might have been fond of her\nnow. She felt herself loveless; if she was important to any one, it was\nonly to her old waiting-woman Denner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n    Are these things then necessities?\n    Then let us meet them like necessities.\n\n                                        --SHAKESPEARE: _Henry IV_.\n\n    See now the virtue living in a word!\n    Hobson will think of swearing it was noon\n    When he saw Dobson at the May-day fair,\n    To prove poor Dobson did not rob the mail.\n    'Tis neighborly to save a neighbor's neck:\n    What harm in lying when you mean no harm?\n    But say 'tis perjury, then Hobson quakes--\n    He'll none of perjury.\n                          Thus words embalm\n    The conscience of mankind: and Roman laws\n    Bring still a conscience to poor Hobson's aid.\n\n\nFew men would have felt otherwise than Harold Transome felt, if, having\na reversion tantamount to possession of a fine estate, carrying an\nassociation with an old name and considerable social importance, they\nwere suddenly informed that there was a person who had a legal right to\ndeprive them of these advantages; that person's right having never been\ncontemplated by any one as more than a chance, and being quite unknown\nto himself. In ordinary cases a shorter possession than Harold's family\nhad enjoyed was allowed by the law to constitute an indefeasible right;\nand if in rare and peculiar instances the law left the possessor of a\nlong inheritance exposed to deprivation as the consequence of old\nobscure transactions, the moral reasons for giving legal validity to the\ntitle of long occupancy were not the less strong. Nobody would have said\nthat Harold was bound to hunt out this alleged remainder-man and urge\nhis rights upon him; on the contrary, all the world would have laughed\nat such conduct, and he would have been thought an interesting patient\nfor a mad-doctor. The unconscious remainder-man was probably much better\noff, left in his original station: Harold would not have been called\nupon to consider his existence, if it had not been presented to him in\nthe shape of a threat from one who had power to execute the threat.\n\nIn fact, what he would have done had the circumstances been different,\nwas much clearer than what he should choose to do or feel himself\ncompelled to do in the actual crisis. He would not have been disgraced\nif, on a valid claim being urged, he had got his lawyers to fight it out\nfor him on the chance of eluding the claim by some adroit technical\nmanagement. Nobody off the stage could be sentimental about these\nthings, or pretend to shed tears of joy because an estate was handed\nover from a gentleman to a mendicant sailor with a wooden leg. And this\nchance remainder-man was perhaps some such specimen of inheritance as\nthe drunken fellow killed in the riot. All the world would think the\nactual Transomes in the right to contest any adverse claim to the\nutmost. But then--it was not certain that they would win in the contest;\nand not winning, they would incur other losses besides that of the\nestate. There had been a little too much of such loss already.\n\nBut why, if it were not wrong to contest the claim, should he feel the\nmost uncomfortable scruples about robbing the claim of its sting by\ngetting rid of its evidence? It was a mortal disappointment--it was a\nsacrifice of indemnification--to abstain from punishing Jermyn. But even\nif he brought his mind to contemplate that as the wiser course, he still\nshrank from what looked like complicity with Jermyn; he still shrank\nfrom the secret nullification of a just legal claim. If he had only\nknown the details, if he had known who this alleged heir was, he might\nhave seen his way to some course that would not have grated on his sense\nof honor and dignity. But Jermyn had been too acute to let Harold know\nthis: he had even carefully kept to the masculine pronoun. And he\nbelieved that there was no one besides himself who would or could make\nHarold any wiser. He went home persuaded that between this interview and\nthe next which they would have together, Harold would be left to an\ninward debate, founded entirely on the information he himself had given.\nAnd he had not much doubt that the result would be what he desired.\nHarold was no fool: there were many good things he liked better in life\nthan an irrational vindictiveness.\n\nAnd it did happen that, after writing to London in fulfillment of his\npledge, Harold spent many hours over that inward debate, which was not\nvery different from what Jermyn imagined. He took it everywhere with him\non foot and on horseback, and it was his companion through a great deal\nof the night. His nature was not of a kind given to internal conflict,\nand he had never before been long undecided and puzzled. This\nunaccustomed state of mind was so painfully irksome to him--he rebelled\nso impatiently against the oppression of circumstances in which his\nquick temperament and habitual decision could not help him--that it\nadded tenfold to his hatred of Jermyn, who was the cause of it. And\nthus, as the temptation to avoid all risk of losing the estate grew and\ngrew till scruples looked minute by the side of it, the difficulty of\nbringing himself to make a compact with Jermyn seemed more and more\ninsurmountable.\n\nBut we have seen that the attorney was much too confident in his\ncalculations. And while Harold was being gulled by his subjection to\nJermyn's knowledge, independent information was on its way to him. The\nmessenger was Christian, who, after as complete a survey of\nprobabilities as he was capable of, had come to the conclusion that the\nmost profitable investment he could make of his peculiar experience and\ntestimony in relation to Bycliffe and Bycliffe's daughter, was to place\nthem at the disposal of Harold Transome. He was afraid of Jermyn; he\nutterly distrusted Johnson; but he thought he was secure in relying on\nHarold Transome's care for his own interest; and he preferred above all\nissues the prospect of forthwith leaving the country with a sum that at\nleast for a good while would put him at his ease.\n\nWhen, only three mornings after the interview with Jermyn, Dominic\nopened the door of Harold's sitting-room, and said that \"Meester\nChreestian,\" Mr. Philip Debarry's courier and an acquaintance of his own\nat Naples, requested to be admitted on business of importance, Harold's\nimmediate thought was that the business referred to the so-called\npolitical affairs which were just now his chief association with the\nname of Debarry, though it seemed an oddness requiring explanation, that\na servant should be personally an intermediary. He assented, expecting\nsomething rather disagreeable than otherwise.\n\nChristian wore this morning those perfect manners of a subordinate who\nis not servile, which he always adopted toward his unquestionable\nsuperiors. Mr. Debarry, who preferred having some one about him with as\nlittle resemblance as possible to a regular servant, had a singular\nliking for the adroit, quiet-mannered Christian, and would have been\namazed to see the insolent assumption he was capable of in the presence\nof people like Mr. Lyon, who were of no account in society. Christian\nhad that sort of cleverness which is said to \"know the world\"--that is\nto say, he knew the price-current of most things.\n\nAware that he was looked at as a messenger while he remained standing\nnear the door with his hat in his hand, he said, with respectful ease--\n\n\"You will probably be surprised, sir, at my coming to speak to you on my\nown account; and, in fact, I could not have thought of doing so if my\nbusiness did not happen to be something of more importance to you than\nto any one else.\"\n\n\"You don't come from Mr. Debarry, then?\" said Harold, with some\nsurprise.\n\n\"No, sir. My business is a secret; and, if you please, must remain so.\"\n\n\"Is it a pledge you are demanding from me?\" said Harold, rather\nsuspiciously, having no ground for confidence in a man of Christian's\nposition.\n\n\"Yes, sir; I am obliged to ask no less than that you will pledge\nyourself not to take Mr. Jermyn into confidence concerning what passes\nbetween us.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Harold, something like a gleam passing over\nhis face. His circulation had become more rapid. \"But what have you had\nto do with Jermyn?\"\n\n\"He has not mentioned me to you then--has he, sir?\"\n\n\"No; certainly not--never.\"\n\nChristian thought, \"Aha, Mr. Jermyn! you are keeping the secret well,\nare you?\" He said, aloud--\n\n\"Then Mr. Jermyn has never mentioned to you, sir, what I believe he is\naware of--that there is danger of a new suit being raised against you on\nthe part of a Bycliffe, to get the estate?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Harold, starting up, and placing himself with his back\nagainst the mantelpiece. He was electrified by surprise at the quarter\nfrom which this information was coming. Any fresh alarm was counteracted\nby the flashing thought that he might be enabled to act independently of\nJermyn; and in the rush of feelings he could utter no more than an\ninterjection. Christian concluded that Harold had no previous hint.\n\n\"It is this fact, that I came to tell you of.\"\n\n\"From some other motive than kindness to me, I presume,\" said Harold,\nwith a slight approach to a smile.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Christian, as quietly as if he had been stating\nyesterday's weather. \"I should not have the folly to use any affectation\nwith you, Mr. Transome. I lost considerable property early in life, and\nam now in the receipt of a salary simply. In the affair I have just\nmentioned to you I can give evidence which will turn the scale against\nyou. I have no wish to do so, if you will make it worth my while to\nleave the country.\"\n\nHarold listened as if he had been a legendary hero, selected for\npeculiar solicitation by the Evil One. Here was temptation in a more\nalluring form than before, because it was sweetened by the prospect of\neluding Jermyn. But the desire to gain time served all the purposes of\ncaution and resistance, and his indifference to the speaker in this case\nhelped him to preserve perfect self-command.\n\n\"You are aware,\" he said, coolly, \"that silence is not a commodity worth\npurchasing unless it is loaded. There are many persons, I dare say, who\nwould like me to pay their travelling expenses for them. But they might\nhardly be able to show me that it was worth my while.\"\n\n\"You wish me to state what I know?\"\n\n\"Well, that is a necessary preliminary to any further conversation.\"\n\n\"I think you will see, Mr. Transome, that, as a matter of justice, the\nknowledge I can give is worth something, quite apart from my future\nappearance or non-appearance as a witness. I must take care of my own\ninterest, and if anything should hinder you from choosing to satisfy me\nfor taking an essential witness out of the way, I must at least be paid\nfor bringing you the information.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me who and where this Bycliffe is?\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"-----And give me a notion of the whole affair?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have talked to a lawyer--not Jermyn--who is at the bottom of the\nlaw in the affair.\"\n\n\"You must not count on any wish of mine to suppress evidence or remove a\nwitness. But name your price for the information.\"\n\n\"In that case I must be paid the higher for my information. Say, two\nthousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Two thousand devils!\" burst out Harold, throwing himself into his chair\nagain, and turning his shoulder toward Christian. New thoughts crowded\nupon him. \"This fellow may want to decamp for some reason or other,\" he\nsaid to himself. \"More people besides Jermyn know about his evidence, it\nseems. The whole thing may look black for me if it comes out. I shall be\nbelieved to have bribed him to run away, whether or not.\" Thus the\noutside conscience came in aid of the inner.\n\n\"I will not give you one sixpence for your information,\" he said,\nresolutely, \"until time has made it clear that you do not intend to\ndecamp, but will be forthcoming when you are called for. On those terms\nI have no objection to give you a note, specifying that after the\nfulfilment of that condition--that is, after the occurrence of a suit,\nor the understanding that no suit is to occur--I will pay you a certain\nsum in consideration of the information you now give me!\"\n\nChristian felt himself caught in a vise. In the first instance he had\ncounted confidently on Harold's ready seizure of his offer to disappear,\nand after some words had seemed to cast a doubt on this presupposition\nhe had inwardly determined to go away, whether Harold wished it or not,\nif he could get a sufficient sum. He did not reply immediately, and\nHarold waited in silence, inwardly anxious to know what Christian could\ntell, but with a vision at present so far cleared that he was determined\nnot to risk incurring the imputation of having anything to do with\nscoundrelism. We are very much indebted to such a linking of events as\nmakes a doubtful action look wrong.\n\nChristian was reflecting that if he stayed and faced some possible\ninconveniences of being known publicly as Henry Scaddon for the sake of\nwhat he might get from Esther, it would at least be wise to be certain\nof some money from Harold Transome, since he turned out to be of so\npeculiar a disposition as to insist on a punctilious honesty to his own\ndisadvantage. Did he think of making a bargain with the other side? If\nso, he might be content to wait for the knowledge till it came in some\nother way. Christian was beginning to be afraid lest he should get\nnothing by this clever move of coming to Transome Court. At last he\nsaid--\n\n\"I think, sir, two thousand would not be an unreasonable sum, on those\nconditions.\"\n\n\"I will not give two thousand.\"\n\n\"Allow me to say, sir, you must consider that there is no one whose\ninterest it is to tell you as much as I shall, even if they could; since\nMr. Jermyn, who knows it, has not thought fit to tell you. There may be\nuse you don't think of in getting the information at once.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I think a gentleman should act liberally under such circumstances.\"\n\n\"So I will.\"\n\n\"I could not take less than a thousand pounds. It really would not be\nworth my while. If Mr. Jermyn knew I gave you the information, he would\nendeavor to injure me.\"\n\n\"I will give you a thousand,\" said Harold, immediately, for Christian\nhad unconsciously touched a sure spring. \"At least, I'll give you a note\nto the effect I spoke of.\"\n\nHe wrote as he had promised, and gave the paper to Christian.\n\n\"Now, don't be circuitous,\" said Harold. \"You seem to have a\nbusiness-like gift of speech. Who and where is this Bycliffe?\"\n\n\"You will be surprised to hear, sir, that she is supposed to be the\ndaughter of the old preacher, Lyon, in Malthouse Yard.\"\n\n\"Good God! How can that be?\" said Harold. At once, the first occasion on\nwhich he had seen Esther rose in his memory--the little dark parlor--the\ngraceful girl in blue, with the surprisingly distinguished manners and\nappearance.\n\n\"In this way. Old Lyon, by some strange means or other, married\nBycliffe's widow when this girl was a baby. And the preacher didn't want\nthe girl to know that he was not her real father: he told me that\nhimself. But she is the image of Bycliffe, whom I knew well--an\nuncommonly fine woman--steps like a queen.\"\n\n\"I have seen her,\" said Harold, more than ever glad to have purchased\nthis knowledge. \"But now, go on.\"\n\nChristian proceeded to tell all he knew, including his conversation with\nJermyn, except so far as it had an unpleasant relation to himself.\n\n\"Then,\" said Harold, as the details seemed to have come to a close, \"you\nbelieve that Miss Lyon and her supposed father are at present unaware of\nthe claims that might be urged for her on the strength of her birth?\"\n\n\"I believe so. But I need not tell you that where the lawyers are on\nthe scent you can never be sure of anything long together. I must remind\nyou, sir, that you have promised to protect me from Mr. Jermyn by\nkeeping my confidence.\"\n\n\"Never fear. Depend upon it, I shall betray nothing to Mr. Jermyn.\"\n\nChristian was dismissed with a \"good-morning\"; and while he cultivated\nsome friendly reminiscences with Dominic, Harold sat chewing the cud of\nhis new knowledge, and finding it not altogether so bitter as he had\nexpected.\n\nFrom the first, after his interview with Jermyn, the recoil of Harold's\nmind from the idea of strangling a legal right threw him on the\nalternative of attempting a compromise. Some middle course might be\npossible, which would be a less evil than a costly lawsuit, or than the\ntotal renunciation of the estates. And now he had learned that the new\nclaimant was a woman--a young woman, brought up under circumstances that\nwould make the fourth of the Transome property seem to her an immense\nfortune. Both the sex and the social condition were of the sort that\nlies open to many softening influences. And having seen Esther, it was\ninevitable that, amongst the various issues, agreeable and disagreeable,\ndepicted by Harold's imagination, there should present itself a\npossibility that would unite the two claims--his own, which he felt to\nbe the rational, and Esther's, which apparently was the legal claim.\n\nHarold, as he had constantly said to his mother, was \"not a marrying\nman\"; he did not contemplate bringing a wife to Transome Court for many\nyears to come, if at all. Having little Harry as an heir, he preferred\nfreedom. Western women were not to his taste; they showed a transition\nfrom the feebly animal to the thinking being, which was simply\ntroublesome. Harold preferred a slow-witted large-eyed woman, silent and\naffectionate, with a load of black hair weighing much more heavily than\nher brains. He had seen no such woman in England, except one which he\nhad brought with him from the East.\n\nTherefore Harold did not care to be married until or unless some\nsurprising chance presented itself; and now that such a chance had\noccurred to suggest marriage to him, he would not admit to himself that\nhe contemplated marrying Esther as a plan; he was only obliged to see\nthat such an issue was not inconceivable. He was not going to take any\nstep expressly directed toward that end: what he had made up his mind\nto, as the course most satisfactory to his nature under present\nurgencies, was to behave to Esther with a frank gentle manliness, which\nmust win her good will, and incline her to save his family interest as\nmuch as possible. He was helped to this determination by the pleasure of\nfrustrating Jermyn's contrivance to shield himself from punishment, and\nhis most distinct and cheering prospect was that within a very short\nspace of time he should not only have effected a satisfactory compromise\nwith Esther, but should have made Jermyn aware by a very disagreeable\nform of announcement, that Harold Transome was no longer afraid of him.\nJermyn should bite the dust.\n\nAt the end of these meditations he felt satisfied with himself and\nlight-hearted. He had rejected two dishonest propositions, and he was\ngoing to do something that seemed eminently graceful. But he needed his\nmother's assistance, and it was necessary that he should both confide in\nher and persuade her.\n\nWithin two hours after Christian left him, Harold begged his mother to\ncome into his private room, and there he told her the strange and\nstartling story, omitting, however, any particulars which would involve\nthe identification of Christian as his informant. Harold felt that his\nengagement demanded his reticence; and he told his mother that he was\nbound to conceal the source of that knowledge which he had got\nindependently of Jermyn.\n\nMrs. Transome said little in the course of the story: she made no\nexclamations, but she listened with close attention, and asked a few\nquestions so much to the point as to surprise Harold. When he showed her\nthe copy of the legal opinion which Jermyn had left with him, she said\nshe knew it very well; she had a copy herself. The particulars of that\nlast lawsuit were too well engraven on her mind: it happened at a time\nwhen there was no one to supersede her, and she was the virtual head of\nthe family affairs. She was prepared to understand how the estate might\nbe in danger; but nothing had prepared her for the strange details--for\nthe way in which the new claimant had been reared and brought within the\nrange of converging motives that had led to this revelation, least of\nall for the part Jermyn had come to play in the revelation. Mrs.\nTransome saw these things through the medium of certain dominant\nemotions that made them seem like a long-ripening retribution. Harold\nperceived that she was painfully agitated, that she trembled, and that\nher white lips would not readily lend themselves to speech. And this\nwas hardly more than he expected. He had not liked the revelation\nhimself when it had first come to him.\n\nBut he did not guess what it was in his narrative which had most pierced\nhis mother. It was something that made the threat about the estate only\na secondary alarm. Now, for the first time, she heard of the intended\nproceedings against Jermyn. Harold had not chosen to speak of them\nbefore; but having at last called his mother into consultation, there\nwas nothing in his mind to hinder him from speaking without reserve of\nhis determination to visit on the attorney his shameful\nmaladministration of the family affairs.\n\nHarold went through the whole narrative--of what he called Jermyn's\nscheme to catch him in a vise, and his power of triumphantly frustrating\nthat scheme--in his usual rapid way, speaking with a final decisiveness\nof tone; and his mother felt that if she urged any counter-consideration\nat all, she could only do so when he had no more to say.\n\n\"Now, what I want you to do, mother, if you can see this matter as I see\nit,\" Harold said in conclusion, \"is to go with me to call on this girl\nin Malthouse Yard. I will open the affair to her; it appears she is not\nlikely to have been informed yet; and you will invite her to visit you\nhere at once, that all scandal, all hatching of law-mischief, may be\navoided, and the thing may be brought to an amicable conclusion.\"\n\n\"It seems almost incredible--extraordinary--a girl in her position,\"\nsaid Mrs. Transome, with difficulty. It would have seemed the bitterest,\nhumiliating penance if another sort of suffering had left any room in\nher heart.\n\n\"I assure you she is a lady; I saw her when I was canvassing, and was\namazed at the time. You will be quite struck with her. It is no\nindignity for you to invite her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Transome, with low-toned bitterness, \"I must put up with\nall things as they are determined for me. When shall we go?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Harold, looking at his watch, \"it is hardly two yet. We\ncould really go to-day, when you have lunched. It is better to lose no\ntime. I'll order the carriage.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Mrs. Transome, with a desperate effort. \"There is plenty of\ntime. I shall not lunch. I have a word to say.\"\n\nHarold withdrew his hand from the bell, and leaned against the\nmantelpiece to listen.\n\n\"You see I comply with your wish at once, Harold?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother, I'm much obliged to you for making no difficulties.\"\n\n\"You ought to listen to me in return.\"\n\n\"Pray go on,\" said Harold, expecting to be annoyed.\n\n\"What is the good of having these Chancery proceedings against Jermyn?\"\n\n\"Good? This good: that fellow has burdened the estate with annuities and\nmortgages to the extent of three thousand a year; and the bulk of them,\nI am certain, he holds himself under the name of another man. And the\nadvances this yearly interest represents, have not been much more than\ntwenty thousand. Of course, he has hoodwinked you, and my father never\ngave attention to these things. He has been up to all sorts of devil's\nwork with the deeds; he didn't count on my coming back from Smyrna to\nfill poor Durfey's place. He shall feel the difference. And the good\nwill be, that I shall save almost all the annuities for the rest of my\nfather's life, which may be ten years or more, and I shall get back some\nof the money, and I shall punish a scoundrel. That is the good.\"\n\n\"He will be ruined.\"\n\n\"That's what I intend,\" said Harold, sharply.\n\n\"He exerted himself a great deal for us in the old suits: everyone said\nhe had wonderful zeal and ability,\" said Mrs. Transome, getting courage\nand warmth, as she went on. Her temper was rising.\n\n\"What he did, he did for his own sake, you may depend on that,\" said\nHarold, with a scornful laugh.\n\n\"There were very painful things in that last suit. You seem anxious\nabout this young woman, to avoid all further scandal and contests in the\nfamily. Why don't you wish to do it in this case? Jermyn might be\nwilling to arrange things amicably--to make restitution as far as he\ncan--if he has done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"I will arrange nothing amicably with him,\" said Harold, decisively. \"If\nhe has ever done anything scandalous as our agent, let him bear the\ninfamy. And the right way to throw the infamy on him is to show the\nworld that he has robbed us, and that I mean to punish him. Why do you\nwish to shield such a fellow, mother? It has been chiefly through him\nthat you have had to lead such a thrifty, miserable life--you who used\nto make as brilliant a figure as a woman need wish.\"\n\nMrs. Transome's rising temper was turned into a horrible sensation, as\npainful as a sudden concussion from something hard and immovable when we\nhave struck out with our fist, intending to hit something warm, soft,\nand breathing like ourselves. Poor Mrs. Transome's strokes were sent\njarring back on her by a hard unalterable past. She did not speak in\nanswer to Harold, but rose from the chair as if she gave up the debate.\n\n\"Women are frightened at everything I know,\" said Harold, kindly,\nfeeling that he had been a little harsh after his mother's compliance.\n\"And you have been used for so many years to think Jermyn a law of\nnature. Come, mother,\" he went on, looking at her gently, and resting\nhis hands on her shoulders, \"look cheerful. We shall get through all\nthese difficulties. And this girl--I dare say she will be quite an\ninteresting visitor for you. You have not had any young girl about you\nfor a long while. Who knows? she may fall deeply in love with me, and I\nmay be obliged to marry her.\"\n\nHe spoke laughingly, only thinking how he could make his mother smile.\nBut she looked at him seriously and said, \"Do you mean that, Harold?\"\n\n\"Am I not capable of making a conquest? Not too fat yet--a handsome,\nwell-rounded youth of thirty-four?\"\n\nShe was forced to look straight at the beaming face, with its rich dark\ncolor, just bent a little over her. Why could she not be happy in this\nson whose future she had once dreamed of, and who had been as fortunate\nas she had ever hoped? The tears came, not plenteously, but making her\ndark eyes as large and bright as youth had once made them without tears.\n\n\"There, there!\" said Harold, coaxingly. \"Don't be afraid. You shall not\nhave a daughter-in-law unless she is a pearl. Now we will get ready to\ngo.\"\n\nIn half an hour from that time Mrs. Transome came down, looking majestic\nin sables and velvet, ready to call on \"the girl in Malthouse Yard.\" She\nhad composed herself to go through this task. She saw there was nothing\nbetter to be done. After the resolutions Harold had taken, some sort of\ncompromise with this oddly-placed heiress was the result most to be\nhoped for; if the compromise turned out to be a marriage--well, she had\nno reason to care much: she was already powerless. It remained to be\nseen what this girl was.\n\nThe carriage was to be driven round the back way, to avoid too much\nobservation. But the late election affairs might account for Mr. Lyon's\nreceiving a visit from the unsuccessful Radical candidate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n    I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul's stead,\n    I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at\n    you.--_Book of Job._\n\n\nIn the interval since Esther parted with Felix Holt on the day of the\nriot, she had gone through so much emotion, and had already had so\nstrong a shock of surprise, that she was prepared to receive any new\nincident of an unwonted kind with comparative equanimity.\n\nWhen Mr. Lyon had got home again from his preaching excursion, Felix was\nalready on his way to Loamford Jail. The little minister was terribly\nshaken by the news. He saw no clear explanation of Felix Holt's conduct;\nfor the statements Esther had heard were so conflicting that she had not\nbeen able to gather distinctly what had come out in the examination by\nthe magistrates. But Mr. Lyon felt confident that Felix was innocent of\nany wish to abet a riot or the infliction of injuries; what he chiefly\nfeared was that in the fatal encounter with Tucker he had been moved by\na rash temper, not sufficiently guarded against by a prayerful and\nhumble spirit.\n\n\"My poor young friend is being taught with mysterious severity the evil\nof a too confident self-reliance,\" he said to Esther, as they sat\nopposite to each other, listening and speaking sadly.\n\n\"You will go and see him, father?\"\n\n\"Verily will I. But I must straightway go and see that poor afflicted\nwoman, whose soul is doubtless whirled about in this trouble like a\nshapeless and unstable thing driven by divided winds.\" Mr. Lyon rose and\ntook his hat hastily, ready to walk out, with his greatcoat flying open\nand exposing his small person to the keen air.\n\n\"Stay, father, pray, till you have had some food,\" said Esther, putting\nher hand on his arm. \"You look quite weary and shattered.\"\n\n\"Child, I cannot stay. I can neither eat bread nor drink water till I\nhave learned more about this young man's deeds, what can be proved and\nwhat cannot be proved against him. I fear he has none to stand by him in\nthis town, for even by the friends of our church I have been ofttimes\nrebuked because he seemed dear to me. But, Esther, my beloved child----\"\n\nHere Mr. Lyon grasped her arm, and seemed in the need of speech to\nforget his previous haste. \"I bear in mind this: the Lord knoweth them\nthat are His; but we--we are left to judge by uncertain signs, that so\nwe may learn to exercise hope and faith toward one another; and in this\nuncertainty I cling with awful hope to those whom the world loves not\nbecause their conscience, albeit mistakenly, is at war with the habits\nof the world. Our great faith, my Esther, is the faith of martyrs: I\nwill not lightly turn away from any man who endures harshness because he\nwill not lie; nay, though I would not wantonly grasp at ease of mind\nthrough an arbitrary choice of doctrine, I cannot but believe that the\nmerits of the Divine Sacrifice are wider than our utmost charity. I once\nbelieved otherwise--but not now, not now.\"\n\nThe minister paused, and seemed to be abstractedly gazing at some\nmemory: he was always liable to be snatched away by thoughts from the\npursuit of a purpose which had seemed pressing. Esther seized the\nopportunity and prevailed on him to fortify himself with some of Lyddy's\nporridge before he went out on his tiring task of seeking definite\ntrustworthy knowledge from the lips of various witnesses, beginning with\nthat feminine darkener of counsel, poor Mrs. Holt.\n\nShe, regarding all her trouble about Felix in the light of a fulfilment\nof her own prophecies, treated the sad history with a preference for\nedification above accuracy, and for mystery above relevance, worthy of a\ncommentator on the Apocalypse. She insisted chiefly, not on the\nimportant facts that Felix had sat at his work till after eleven, like a\ndeaf man, had rushed out in surprise and alarm, had come back to report\nwith satisfaction that things were quiet, and had asked her to set by\nhis dinner for him--facts which would tell as evidence that Felix was\ndisconnected with any project of disturbances, and was averse to them.\nThese things came out incidentally in her long plaint to the minister;\nbut what Mrs. Holt felt it essential to state was, that long before\nMichaelmas was turned, sitting in her chair, she had said to Felix that\nthere would be a judgment on him for being so certain sure about the\nPills and the Elixir.\n\n\"And now, Mr. Lyon,\" said the poor woman, who had dressed herself in a\ngown previously cast off, a front all out of curl, and a cap with no\nstarch in it, while she held little coughing Job on her knee,--\"and now\nyou see--my words have come true sooner than I thought they would. Felix\nmay contradict me if he will; but there he is in prison, and here am I,\nwith nothing in the world to bless myself with but half-a-crown a-week\nas I've saved by my own scraping, and this house I've got to pay rent\nfor. It's not me has done wrong, Mr. Lyon; there's nobody can say it of\nme--not the orphan child on my knee is more innicent o' riot and murder\nand anything else as is bad. But when you've got a son so masterful and\nstopping medicines as Providence has sent, and his betters have been\ntaking up and down the country since before he was a baby, it's o' no\nuse being good here below. But he _was_ a baby, Mr. Lyon, and I gave him\nthe breast,\"--here poor Mrs. Holt's motherly love over-came her\nexpository eagerness, and she fell more and more to crying as she\nspoke--\"And to think there's folks saying now as he'll be transported,\nand his hair shaved off, and the treadmill, and everything. Oh, dear!\"\n\nAs Mrs. Holt broke off into sobbing, little Job also, who had got a\nconfused yet profound sense of sorrow, and of Felix being hurt and gone\naway, set up a little wail of wondering misery.\n\n\"Nay, Mistress Holt,\" said the minister, soothingly, \"enlarge not your\ngrief by more than warrantable grounds. I have good hope that my young\nfriend, your son, will be delivered from any severe consequences beyond\nthe death of the man Tucker, which I fear will ever be a sore burden on\nhis memory. I feel confident that a jury of His country-men will\ndiscern between misfortune, or it may be misjudgment, and an evil will,\nand that he will be acquitted of any grave offence.\"\n\n\"He never stole anything in his life, Mr. Lyon,\" said Mrs. Holt,\nreviving. \"Nobody can throw it in my face as my son ran away with money\nlike the young man at the bank--though he looked most respectable, and\nfar different on a Sunday to what Felix ever did. And I know it's very\nhard fighting with constables; but they say Tucker's wife'll be a deal\nbetter off than she was before, for the great folks'll pension her, and\nshe'll be put on all the charities, and her children at the Free School,\nand everything. Your trouble's easy borne when everybody gives it a lift\nfor you; and if judge and jury wants to do right by Felix, they'll think\nof his poor mother, with the bread took out of her mouth, all but\nhalf-a-crown a-week and furniture--which, to be sure, is most excellent,\nand of my own buying--and got to keep this orphin child as Felix himself\nbrought on me. And I might send him back to his old grandfather on\nparish pay, but I'm not that woman, Mr. Lyon; I've a tender heart. And\nhere's his little feet and toes, like marbil; do but look\"--here Mrs.\nHolt drew off Job's sock and shoe, and showed a well-washed little\nfoot--\"and you'll perhaps say I might take a lodger; but it's easy\ntalking; it isn't everybody at a loose-end wants a parlor and a bedroom;\nand if anything bad happens to Felix, I may as well go and sit in the\nparish pound, and nobody to buy me out; for it's beyond everything how\nthe church members find fault with my son. But I think they might leave\nhis mother to find fault; for queer and masterful he might be, and\nflying in the face of the very Scripture about the physic, but he was\nmost clever beyond anything--that I _will_ say--and was his own father's\nlawful child, and me his mother, that was Mary Wall thirty years before\never I married his father.\" Here Mrs. Holt's feelings again became too\nmuch for her, but she struggled on to say, sobbingly, \"And if they're to\ntransport him, I should like to go to the prison and take the orphin\nchild; for he was most fond of having him on his lap, and said he'd\nnever marry; and there was One above overheard him, for he's been took\nat his word.\"\n\nMr. Lyon listened with low groans, and then tried to comfort her by\nsaying that he would himself go to Loamford as soon as possible, and\nwould give his soul no rest till he had done all he could do for Felix.\n\nOn one point Mrs. Holt's plaint tallied with his own forebodings, and he\nfound them verified: the state of feeling in Treby among the Liberal\nDissenting flock was unfavorable to Felix. None who had observed his\nconduct from the windows saw anything tending to excuse him, and his own\naccount of his motives, given on his examination, was spoken of with\nhead-shaking; if it had not been for his habit of always thinking\nhimself wiser than other people, he would never have entertained such a\nwild scheme. He had set himself up for something extraordinary, and had\nspoken ill of respectable trades-people. He had put a stop to the making\nof saleable drugs, contrary to the nature of buying and selling, and to\na due reliance on what Providence might effect in the human inside\nthrough the instrumentality of remedies unsuitable to the stomach,\nlooked at in a merely secular light; and the result was what might have\nbeen expected. He had brought his mother to poverty, and himself into\ntrouble. And what for? He had done no good to \"the cause\"; if he had\nfought about Church-rates, or had been worsted in some struggle in which\nhe was distinctly the champion of Dissent and Liberalism, his case would\nhave been one for gold, silver, and copper subscriptions, in order to\nprocure the best defence; sermons might have been preached on him, and\nhis name might have floated on flags from Newcastle to Dorchester. But\nthere seemed to be no edification in what had befallen Felix. The riot\nat Treby, \"turn it which way you would,\" as Mr. Muscat observed, was no\ngreat credit to Liberalism; and what Mr. Lyon had to testify as to Felix\nHolt's conduct in the matter of the Sproxton men, only made it clear\nthat the defence of Felix was the accusation of his party. The whole\naffair, Mr. Nuttwood said, was dark and inscrutable, and seemed not to\nbe one in which the interference of God's servants would tend to give\nthe glory where the glory was due. That a candidate for whom the richer\nchurch members had all voted should have his name associated with the\nencouragement of drunkenness, riot, and plunder, was an occasion for the\nenemy to blaspheme; and it was not clear how the enemy's mouth would be\nstopped by exertions in favor of a rash young man, whose interference\nhad made things worse instead of better. Mr. Lyon was warned lest his\nhuman partialities should blind him to the interests of truth: it was\nGod's cause that was endangered in this matter.\n\nThe little minister's soul was bruised; he himself was keenly alive to\nthe complication of public and private regards in this affair, and\nsuffered a good deal at the thought of Tory triumph in the demonstration\nthat, excepting the attack on the Seven Stars, which called itself a\nWhig house, all damage to property had been borne by Tories. He cared\nintensely for his opinions, and would have liked events to speak for\nthem in a sort of picture-writing that everybody could understand. The\nenthusiasms of the world are not to be stimulated by a commentary in\nsmall and subtle characters which alone can tell the whole truth; and\nthe picture writing in Felix Holt's troubles was of an entirely puzzling\nkind: if he were a martyr, neither side wanted to claim him. Yet the\nminister, as we have seen, found in his Christian faith a reason for\nclinging the more to one who had not a large party to back him. That\nlittle man's heart was heroic; he was not one of those Liberals who make\ntheir anxiety for \"the cause\" of Liberalism a plea for cowardly\ndesertion.\n\nBesides himself, he believed there was no one who could bear testimony\nto the remonstrances of Felix concerning the treating of the Sproxton\nmen, except Jermyn, Johnson, and Harold Transome. Though he had the\nvaguest idea of what could be done in the case, he fixed his mind on the\nprobability that Mr. Transome would be moved to the utmost exertion, if\nonly as an atonement; but he dared not take any step until he had\nconsulted Felix, who he foresaw was likely to have a very strong\ndetermination as to the help he would accept or not accept.\n\nThis last expectation was fulfilled. Mr. Lyon returned to Esther, after\nhis day's journey to Loamford and back, with less of trouble and\nperplexity in his mind: he had at least got a definite course marked\nout, to which he must resign himself. Felix had declared that he would\nreceive no aid from Harold Transome, except the aid he might give as an\nhonest witness. There was nothing to be done for him but what was\nperfectly simple and direct. Even if the pleading of counsel had been\npermitted (and at that time it was not) on behalf of a prisoner on trial\nfor felony, Felix would have declined it: he would in any case have\nspoken in his own defence. He had a perfectly simple account to give,\nand needed not to avail himself of any legal adroitness. He consented to\naccept the services of a respectable solicitor in Loamford, who offered\nto conduct his case without any fees. The work was plain and easy, Felix\nsaid. The only witnesses who had to be hunted up at all were some who\ncould testify that he had tried to take the crowd down Hobb's Lane, and\nthat they had gone to the Manor in spite of him.\n\n\"Then he is not so much cast down as you feared, father?\" said Esther.\n\n\"No, child; albeit he is pale and much shaken for one so stalwart. He\nhath no grief, he says, save for the poor man Tucker, and for his\nmother; otherwise his heart is without a burden. We discoursed greatly\non the sad effect of all this for his mother, and on the perplexed\ncondition of human things, whereby even right action seems to bring evil\nconsequences, if we have respect only to our own brief lives, and not to\nthat larger rule whereby we are stewards of the eternal dealings, and\nnot contrivers of our own success.\"\n\n\"Did he say nothing about me, father?\" said Esther, trembling a little,\nbut unable to repress her egoism.\n\n\"Yes; he asked if you were well, and sent his affectionate regards. Nay,\nhe bade me say something which appears to refer to your discourse\ntogether when I was not present. 'Tell her,' he said, 'whatever they\nsentence me to, she knows they can't rob me of my vocation. With poverty\nfor my bride, and preaching and pedagoguy for my business, I am sure of\na handsome establishment.' He laughed--doubtless bearing in mind some\nplayfulness of thine.\"\n\nMr. Lyon seemed to be looking at Esther as he smiled, but she was not\nnear enough for him to discern the expression of her face. Just then it\nseemed made for melancholy rather than for playfulness. Hers was not a\nchildish beauty; and when the sparkle of mischief, wit and vanity was\nout of her eyes, and the large look of abstracted sorrow was there, you\nwould have been surprised by a certain grandeur which the smiles had\nhidden. That changing face was the perfect symbol of her mixed\nsusceptible nature, in which battle was inevitable, and the side of\nvictory uncertain.\n\nShe began to look on all that had passed between herself and Felix as\nsomething not buried, but embalmed and kept as a relic in a private\nsanctuary. The very entireness of her preoccupation about him, the\nperpetual repetition in her memory of all that had passed between them,\ntended to produce this effect. She lived with him in the past; in the\nfuture she seemed shut out from him. He was an influence above her life,\nrather than a part of it; some time or other, perhaps, he would be to\nher as if he belonged to the solemn admonishing skies, checking her\nself-satisfied pettiness with the suggestion of a wider life.\n\nBut not yet--not while her trouble was so fresh. For it was still _her_\ntrouble, and not Felix Holt's. Perhaps it was a subtraction from his\npower over her, that she could never think of him with pity, because he\nalways seemed to her too great and strong to be pitied; he wanted\nnothing. He evaded calamity by choosing privation. The best part of a\nwoman's love is worship; but it is hard to her to be sent away with her\nprecious spikenard rejected, and her long tresses too, that were let\nfall ready to soothe the wearied feet.\n\nWhile Esther was carrying these things in her heart, the January days\nwere beginning to pass by with their wonted wintry monotony, except that\nthere was rather more of good cheer than usual remaining from the feast\nof Twelfth Night among the triumphant Tories, and rather more scandal\nthan usual excited among the mortified Dissenters by the wilfulness of\ntheir minister. He had actually mentioned Felix Holt by name in his\nevening sermon, and offered up a petition for him in the evening prayer,\nalso by name--not as \"a young Ishmaelite, whom he would fain see brought\nback from the lawless life of the desert, and seated in the same fold\neven with the sons of Judah and of Benjamin,\" a suitable periphrasis\nwhich Brother Kemp threw off without any effort, and with all the\nfelicity of a suggestive critic. Poor Mrs. Holt, indeed, even in the\nmidst of her grief, experienced a proud satisfaction; that though she\nwas not a church member she was now an object of congregational remark\nand ministerial allusion. Feeling herself a spotless character standing\nout in relief on a dark background of affliction, and a practical\ncontradiction to that extreme doctrine of human depravity which she had\nnever \"given in to,\" she was naturally gratified and soothed by a notice\nwhich must be a recognition. But more influential hearers were of\nopinion, that in a man who had so many long sentences at command as Mr.\nLyon, so many parentheses and modifying clauses, this naked use of a\nnon-scriptural Treby name in an address to the Almighty was all the more\noffensive. In a low unlettered local preacher of the Wesleyan persuasion\nsuch things might pass; but a certain style in prayer was demanded from\nIndependents, the most educated body in the ranks of orthodox Dissent.\nTo Mr. Lyon such notions seemed painfully perverse, and the next morning\nhe was declaring to Esther his resolution stoutly to withstand them, and\nto count nothing common or unclean on which a blessing could be asked,\nwhen the tenor of his thoughts was completely changed by a great shock\nof surprise which made both himself and Esther sit looking at each other\nin speechless amazement.\n\nThe cause was a letter brought by a special messenger from Duffield; a\nheavy letter addressed to Esther in a business-like manner, quite\nunexampled in her correspondence. And the contents of the letter were\nmore startling than its exterior. It began:\n\n    MADAM,--Herewith we send you a brief abstract of evidence which has\n    come within our knowledge, that the right of remainder whereby the\n    lineal issue of Edward Bycliffe can claim possession of the estates\n    of which the entail was settled by John Justus Transome in 1729,\n    now first accrues to you as the sole and lawful issue of Maurice\n    Christian Bycliffe. We are confident of success in the prosecution\n    of this claim, which will result to you in the possession of\n    estates to the value, at the lowest, of from five to six thousand\n    per annum----\n\nIt was at this point that Esther, who was reading aloud, let her hand\nfall with the letter on her lap, and with a palpitating heart looked at\nher father, who looked again in silence that lasted for two or three\nminutes. A certain terror was upon them both, though the thoughts that\nlaid that weight on the tongue of each were different.\n\nIt was Mr. Lyon who spoke first.\n\n\"This, then, is what the man named Christian referred to. I distrusted\nhim, yet it seems he spoke truly.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Esther, whose imagination ran necessarily to those\nconditions of wealth which she could best appreciate, \"Do they mean that\nthe Transomes would be turned out of Transome Court, and that I should\ngo and live there? It seems quite an impossible thing.\"\n\n\"Nay, child, I know not. I am ignorant in these things, and the thought\nof worldly grandeur for you hath more of terror than of gladness for me.\nNevertheless we must duly weigh all things, not considering aught that\nbefalls us as a bare event, but rather as an occasion for faithful\nstewardship. Let us go to my study and consider this writing further.\"\n\nHow this announcement, which to Esther seemed as unprepared as if it had\nfallen from the skies, came to be made to her by solicitors other than\nBatt & Cowley, the old lawyers of the Bycliffes, was by a sequence as\nnatural, that is to say, as legally natural, as any in the world. The\nsecret worker of the apparent wonder was Mr. Johnson, who, on the very\nday when he wrote to give his patron, Mr. Jermyn, the serious warning\nthat a bill was likely to be filed in Chancery against him, had carried\nforward with added zeal the business already commenced, of arranging\nwith another firm his share in the profits likely to result from the\nprosecution of Esther Bycliffe's claim.\n\nJermyn's star was certainly going down, and Johnson did not feel an\nunmitigated grief. Beyond some troublesome declarations as to his actual\nshare in transactions in which his name had been used, Johnson saw\nnothing formidable in prospect for himself. He was not going to be\nruined, though Jermyn probably was: he was not a high-flyer, but a mere\nclimbing-bird, who could hold on and get his livelihood just as well if\nhis wings were clipped a little. And, in the meantime, here was\nsomething to be gained in this Bycliffe business, which, it was not\nunpleasant to think, was a nut that Jermyn had intended to keep for his\nown particular cracking, and which would be rather a severe astonishment\nto Mr. Harold Transome, whose manners towards respectable agents were\nsuch as leave a smart in a man of spirit.\n\nUnder the stimulus of small many-mixed motives like these, a great deal\nof business has been done in the world by well-clad and, in 1833,\nclean-shaven men, whose names are on charity lists, and who do not know\nthat they are base. Mr. Johnson's character was not much more\nexceptional than his double chin.\n\nNo system, religious or political, I believe, has laid it down as a\nprinciple that all men are alike virtuous, or even that all the people\nrated for \u00c2\u00a380 houses are an honor to their species.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n    The down we rest on in our a\u00c3\u00abry dreams\n    Has not been plucked from birds that live and smart;\n    'Tis but warm snow, that melts not.\n\n\nThe story and the prospect revealed to Esther by the lawyer's letter,\nwhich she and her father studied together, had made an impression on her\nvery different from what she had been used to figure to herself in her\nmany day-dreams as to the effect of a sudden elevation in rank and\nfortune. In her day-dreams she had not traced out the means by which\nsuch a change could be brought about; in fact, the change had seemed\nimpossible to her, except in her little private Utopia, which, like\nother Utopias, was filled with delightful results, independent of\nprocesses. But her mind had fixed itself habitually on the signs and\nluxuries of ladyhood, for which she had the keenest perception. She had\nseen the very mat in her carriage, had scented the dried rose-leaves in\nher corridors, had felt the soft carpet under her pretty feet, and seen\nherself, as she rose from her sofa cushions, in the crystal panel that\nreflected a long drawing-room, where the conservatory flowers and the\npictures of fair women left her still with the supremacy of charm. She\nhad trodden the marble-firm gravel of her garden-walks and the soft deep\nturf of her lawn; she had had her servants about her filled with adoring\nrespect, because of her kindness as well as her grace and beauty; but\nshe had had several accomplished cavaliers all at once sueing for her\nhand--one of whom, uniting very high birth with long dark eyelashes and\nthe most distinguished talents, she secretly preferred, though his pride\nand hers hindered an avowal, and supplied the inestimable interest of\nretardation. The glimpses she had had in her brief life as a family\ngoverness, supplied her ready faculty with details enough of delightful\nstill life to furnish her day-dreams; and no one who has not, like\nEsther, a strong natural prompting and susceptibility toward such\nthings, and has at the same time suffered from the presence of opposite\nconditions, can understand how powerfully those minor accidents of rank\nwhich please the fastidious sense can preoccupy the imagination.\n\nIt seemed that almost everything in her day-dreams--cavaliers\napart--must be found at Transome Court. But now that fancy was becoming\nreal, and the impossible appeared possible, Esther found the balance of\nher attention reversed: now that her ladyhood was not simply in Utopia,\nshe found herself arrested and painfully grasped by the means through\nwhich the ladyhood was to be obtained. To her inexperience this strange\nstory of an alienated inheritance, of such a last representative of\npure-blooded lineage as old Thomas Transome the bill-sticker, above all\nof the dispossession hanging over those who actually held, and had\nexpected always to hold, the wealth and position which were suddenly\nannounced to be rightly hers--all these things made a picture, not for\nher own tastes and fancies to float in with Elysian indulgence, but in\nwhich she was compelled to gaze on the degrading hard experience of\nother human beings, and on a humiliating loss which was the obverse of\nher own proud gain. Even in her times of most untroubled egoism, Esther\nshrank from anything ungenerous; and the fact that she had a very lively\nimage of Harold Transome and his gypsy-eyed boy in her mind, gave\nadditional distinctness to the thought that if she entered they must\ndepart. Of the elder Transomes she had a dimmer vision, and they were\nnecessarily in the background to her sympathy.\n\nShe and her father sat with their hands locked, as they might have done\nif they had been listening to a solemn oracle in the days of old\nrevealing unknown kinship and rightful heirdom. It was not that Esther\nhad any thought of renouncing her fortune; she was incapable, in these\nmoments, of condensing her vague ideas and feelings into any distinct\nplan of action, nor indeed did it seem that she was called upon to act\nwith any promptitude. It was only that she was conscious of being\nstrangely awed by something that was called good fortune; and the awe\nshut out any scheme of rejection as much as any triumphant joy in\nacceptance. Her father, she learned, had died disappointed and in\nwrongful imprisonment, and an undefined sense of Nemesis seemed half to\nsanctify her inheritance, and counteract its apparent arbitrariness.\n\nFelix Holt was present in her mind throughout; what he would say was an\nimaginary commentary that she was constantly framing, and the words that\nshe most frequently gave him--for she dramatized under the inspiration\nof a sadness slightly bitter--were of this kind: \"That is clearly your\ndestiny--to be aristocratic, to be rich. I always saw that our lots lay\nwidely apart. You are not fit for poverty, or any work of difficulty.\nBut remember what I once said to you about a vision of consequences;\ntake care where your fortune leads you.\"\n\nHer father had not spoken since they had ended their study and\ndiscussion of the story and the evidence as it was presented to them.\nInto this he had entered with his usual penetrating activity; but he was\nso accustomed to the impersonal study of narrative, that even in these\nexceptional moments the habit of half a century asserted itself, and he\nseemed sometimes not to distinguish the case of Esther's inheritance\nfrom a story in ancient history, until some detail recalled him to the\nprofound feeling that a great, great change might be coming over the\nlife of this child who was so close to him. At last he relapsed into\ntotal silence, and for some time Esther was not moved to interrupt it.\nHe had sunk back in his chair with his hand locked in hers, and was\npursuing a sort of prayerful meditation: he lifted up no formal\npetition, but it was as if his soul travelled again over the facts he\nhad been considering in the company of a guide ready to inspire and\ncorrect him. He was striving to purify his feeling in this matter from\nselfish or worldly dross--a striving which is that prayer without\nceasing, sure to wrest an answer by its sublime importunity.\n\nThere is no knowing how long they might have sat in this way, if it had\nnot been for the inevitable Lyddy reminding them dismally of dinner.\n\n\"Yes, Lyddy, we come,\" said Esther: and then, before moving--\n\n\"Is there any advice you have in your mind for me, father?\" The sense of\nawe was growing in Esther. Her intensest life was no longer in her\ndreams, where she made things to her own mind: she was moving in a world\ncharged with forces.\n\n\"Not yet, my dear--save this; that you will seek special illumination in\nthis juncture, and, above all, be watchful that your soul be not lifted\nup within you by what, rightly considered, is rather an increase of\ncharge, and a call upon you to walk along a path which is indeed easy to\nthe flesh, but dangerous to the spirit.\"\n\n\"You would always live with me, father?\" Esther said, under a strong\nimpulse--partly affection, partly the need to grasp at some moral help.\nBut she had no sooner uttered the words than they raised a vision,\nshowing, as by a flash of lightning, the incongruity of that past which\nhad created the sanctities and affections of her life with that future\nwhich was coming to her----The little rusty old minister, with the one\nluxury of his Sunday evening pipe, smoked up the kitchen chimney, coming\nto live in the midst of grandeur----but no! her father, with the\ngrandeur of his past sorrow and his long struggling labors, forsaking\nhis vocation, and vulgarly accepting an existence unsuited to\nhim.----Esther's face flushed with the excitement of this vision and its\nreversed interpretation, which five months ago she would have been\nincapable of seeing. Her question to her father seemed like a mockery;\nshe was ashamed. He answered slowly--\n\n\"Touch not that chord yet, my child. I must learn to think of thy lot\naccording to the demands of Providence. We will rest a while from the\nsubject; and I will seek calmness in my ordinary duties.\"\n\nThe next morning nothing more was said. Mr. Lyon was absorbed in his\nsermon-making, for it was near the end of the week, and Esther was\nobliged to attend to her pupils. Mrs. Holt came by invitation with\nlittle Job to share their dinner of roast-meat; and, after much of what\nthe minister called unprofitable discourse, she was quitting the house\nwhen she hastened back with an astonished face, to tell Mr. Lyon and\nEsther, who were already in wonder at crashing, thundering sounds on the\npavement, that there was a carriage stopping and stamping at the entry\ninto Malthouse Yard, with \"all sorts of fine liveries,\" and a lady and\ngentleman inside. Mr. Lyon and Esther looked at each other, both having\nthe same name in their minds.\n\n\"If it's Mr. Transome or somebody else as is great, Mr. Lyon,\" urged\nMrs. Holt, \"you'll remember my son, and say he's got a mother with a\ncharacter they may enquire into as much as they like. And never mind\nwhat Felix says, for he's so masterful he'd stay in prison and be\ntransported whether or no, only to have his own way. For it's not to be\nthought but what the great people could get him off if they would; and\nit's very hard with a King in the country and all the texts in Proverbs\nabout the King's countenance, and Solomon and the live baby----\"\n\nMr. Lyon lifted up his hand deprecatingly, and Mrs. Holt retreated from\nthe parlor-door to a corner of the kitchen, the outer doorway being\noccupied by Dominic, who was enquiring if Mr. and Miss Lyon were at\nhome, and could receive Mrs. Transome and Mr. Harold Transome. While\nDominic went back to the carriage Mrs. Holt escaped with her tiny\ncompanion to Zachary's, the new pew-opener, observing to Lyddy that she\nknew herself, and was not that woman to stay where she might not be\nwanted; whereupon Lyddy, differing fundamentally, admonished her parting\near that it was well if she knew herself to be dust and ashes--silently\nextending the application of this remark to Mrs. Transome, as she saw\nthe tall lady sweep in arrayed in her rich black and fur, with that fine\ngentleman behind her whose thick top-knot of wavy hair, sparkling ring,\ndark complexion, and general air of worldly exaltation unconnected with\nchapel, were painfully suggestive to Lyddy of Herod, Pontius Pilate, or\nthe much-quoted Gallio.\n\nHarold Transome, greeting Esther gracefully, presented his mother, whose\neagle-like glance, fixed on her from the first moment of entering,\nseemed to Esther to pierce her through. Mrs. Transome hardly noticed Mr.\nLyon, not from studied haughtiness, but from sheer mental inability to\nconsider him--as a person ignorant of natural history is unable to\nconsider a fresh-water polyp otherwise than as a sort of animated weed,\ncertainly not fit for table. But Harold saw that his mother was\nagreeably struck by Esther, who indeed showed to much advantage. She was\nnot at all taken by surprise, and maintained a dignified quietude; but\nher previous knowledge and reflection about the possible dispossession\nof these Transomes gave her a softened feeling toward them which tinged\nher manners very agreeably.\n\nHarold was carefully polite to the minister, throwing out a word to make\nhim understand that he had an important part in the important business\nwhich had brought this unannounced visit; and the four made a group\nseated not far off each other near the window, Mrs. Transome and Esther\nbeing on the sofa.\n\n\"You must be astonished at a visit from me, Miss Lyon,\" Mrs. Transome\nbegan; \"I seldom come to Treby Magna. Now I see you, the visit is an\nunexpected pleasure; but the cause of my coming is business of a serious\nnature, which my son will communicate to you.\"\n\n\"I ought to begin by saying that what I have to announce to you is the\nreverse of disagreeable, Miss Lyon,\" said Harold, with lively ease. \"I\ndon't suppose the world would consider it very good news for me; but a\nrejected candidate, Mr. Lyon,\" Harold went on, turning graciously to the\nminister, \"begins to be inured to loss and misfortune.\"\n\n\"Truly, sir,\" said Mr. Lyon, with a rather sad solemnity, \"your allusion\nhath a grievous bearing for me, but I will not retard your present\npurpose by further remark.\"\n\n\"You will never guess what I have to disclose,\" said Harold, again\nlooking at Esther, \"unless, indeed, you have already had some previous\nintimation of it.\"\n\n\"Does it refer to law and inheritance?\" said Esther, with a smile. She\nwas already brightened by Harold's manner. The news seemed to be losing\nits chillness, and to be something really belonging to warm,\ncomfortable, interesting life.\n\n\"Then you have already heard of it?\" said Harold, inwardly vexed, but\nsufficiently prepared not to seem so.\n\n\"Only yesterday,\" said Esther, quite simply, \"I received a letter from\nsome lawyers with a statement of many surprising things, showing that I\nwas an heiress\"--here she turned very prettily to address Mrs.\nTransome--\"which, as you may imagine, is one of the last things I could\nhave supposed myself to be.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Transome with elderly grace, just laying her hand\nfor an instant on Esther's, \"it is a lot that would become you\nadmirably.\"\n\nEsther blushed, and said playfully:\n\n\"Oh, I know what to buy with fifty pounds a-year, but I know the price\nof nothing beyond that.\"\n\nHer father sat looking at her through his spectacles, stroking his chin.\nIt was amazing to herself that she was taking so lightly now what had\ncaused her such deep emotion yesterday.\n\n\"I daresay, then,\" said Harold, \"you are more fully possessed of\nparticulars than I am. So that my mother and I need only tell you what\nno one else can tell you--that is, what are her and my feelings and\nwishes under these new and unexpected circumstances.\"\n\n\"I am most anxious,\" said Esther, with a grave beautiful look of respect\nto Mrs. Transome--\"most anxious on that point. Indeed, being of course\nin uncertainty about it, I have not yet known whether I could rejoice.\"\nMrs. Transome's glance had softened. She liked Esther to look at her.\n\n\"Our chief anxiety,\" she said, knowing what Harold wished her to say,\n\"is, that there may be no contest, no useless expenditure of money. Of\ncourse we will surrender what can be rightfully claimed.\"\n\n\"My mother expresses our feeling precisely, Miss Lyon,\" said Harold.\n\"And I'm sure, Mr. Lyon, you will understand our desire.\"\n\n\"Assuredly, sir. My daughter would in any case have had my advice to\nseek a conclusion which would involve no strife. We endeavor, sir, in\nour body, to hold to the apostolic rule that one Christian brother\nshould not go to law with another; and I, for my part, would extend this\nrule to all my fellow-men, apprehending that the practice of our courts\nis little consistent with the simplicity that is in Christ.\"\n\n\"If it is to depend on my will,\" said Esther, \"there is nothing that\nwould be more repugnant to me than any struggle on such a subject. But\ncan't the lawyers go on doing what they will in spite of me? It seems\nthat this is what they mean.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Harold, smiling. \"Of course they live by such\nstruggles as you dislike. But we can thwart them by determining not to\nquarrel. It is desirable that we should consider the affair together,\nand put it into the hands of honorable solicitors. I assure you we\nTransomes will not contend for what is not our own.\"\n\n\"And this is what I have come to beg of you,\" said Mrs. Transome. \"It is\nthat you will come to Transome Court--and let us take full time to\narrange matters. Do oblige me: you shall not be teased more than you\nlike by an old woman: you shall do just as you please, and become\nacquainted with your future home, since it is to be yours. I can tell\nyou a world of things that you will want to know; and the business can\nproceed properly.\"\n\n\"Do consent,\" said Harold, with winning brevity.\n\nEsther was flushed and her eyes were bright. It was impossible for her\nnot to feel that the proposal was a more tempting step toward her change\nof condition than she could have thought of beforehand. She had\nforgotten that she was in any trouble. But she looked toward her father,\nwho was again stroking his chin, as was his habit when he was doubting\nor deliberating.\n\n\"I hope you do not disapprove of Miss Lyon's granting us this favor?\"\nsaid Harold to the minister.\n\n\"I have nothing to oppose to it, sir, if my daughter's own mind is clear\nas to her course.\"\n\n\"You will come--now--with us,\" said Mrs. Transome, persuasively. \"You\nwill go back with us now in the carriage.\"\n\nHarold was highly gratified with the perfection of his mother's manner\non this occasion, which he had looked forward to as difficult. Since he\nhad come home again he had never seen her so much at her ease, or with\nso much benignancy in her face. The secret lay in the charm of Esther's\nsweet young deference, a sort of charm that had not before entered into\nMrs. Transome's elderly life. Esther's pretty behavior, it must be\nconfessed, was not fed entirely from lofty moral sources: over and above\nher really generous feeling, she enjoyed Mrs. Transome's accent, the\nhigh-bred quietness of her speech, the delicate odor of her drapery. She\nhad always thought that life must be particularly easy if one could pass\nit among refined people; and so it seemed at this moment. She wished,\nunmixedly, to go to Transome Court.\n\n\"Since my father has no objection,\" she said, \"and you urge me so\nkindly. But I must beg for time to pack up a few clothes.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" said Mrs. Transome. \"We are not at all pressed.\"\n\nWhen Esther had left the room, Harold said, \"Apart from our immediate\nreason for coming, Mr. Lyon, I could have wished to see you about these\nunhappy consequences of the election contest. But you will understand\nthat I have been much preoccupied with private affairs.\"\n\n\"You have well said that the consequences are unhappy, sir. And but for\na reliance on something more than human calculation, I know not which I\nshould most bewail--the scandal which wrong-dealing has brought on right\nprinciples or the snares which it laid for the feet of a young man who\nis dear to me. 'One soweth, and another reapeth,' is a verity that\napplies to evil as well as good.\"\n\n\"You are referring to Felix Holt. I have not neglected steps to secure\nthe best legal help for the prisoners: but I am given to understand that\nHolt refuses any aid from me. I hope he will not go rashly to work in\nspeaking in his own defence without any legal instruction. It is an\nopprobrium of our law that no counsel is allowed to plead for the\nprisoner in cases of felony. A ready tongue may do a man as much harm as\ngood in a court of justice. He piques himself on making a display, and\ndisplays a little too much.\"\n\n\"Sir, you know him not,\" said the little minister, in his deeper tone.\n\"He would not accept, even if it were accorded, a defense wherein the\ntruth was screened or avoided,--not from a vainglorious spirit of\nself-exhibition, for he hath a singular directness and simplicity of\nspeech; but from an averseness to a profession wherein a man may without\nshame seek to justify the wicked for reward, and take away the\nrighteousness of the righteous from him.\"\n\n\"It's a pity a fine young fellow should do himself harm by fanatical\nnotions of that sort. I could at least have procured the advantage of\nfirst-rate consultation. He didn't look to me like a dreamy personage.\"\n\n\"Nor is he dreamy; rather, his excess lies in being too practical.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope you will not encourage him in such irrationality; the\nquestion is not one of misrepresentation, but of adjusting fact, so as\nto raise it to the power of evidence. Don't you see that?\"\n\n\"I do, I do. But I distrust not Felix Holt's discernment in regard to\nhis own case. He builds not on doubtful things and hath no illusory\nhopes; on the contrary, he is of a too-scornful incredulity where I\nwould fain see a more childlike faith. But he will hold no belief\nwithout action corresponding thereto; and the occasion of his return to\nthis, his native place, at a time which has proved fatal, was no other\nthan his resolve to hinder the sale of some drugs, which had chiefly\nsupported his mother, but which his better knowledge showed him to be\npernicious to the human frame. He undertook to support her by his own\nlabor; but, sir, I pray you to mark--and old as I am, I will not deny\nthat this young man instructs me herein--I pray you to mark the\npoisonous confusion of good and evil which is the wide-spreading effect\nof vicious practices. Through the use of undue electioneering\nmeans--concerning which, however, I do not accuse you farther than of\nhaving acted the part of him who washes his hands when he delivers up to\nothers the exercise of an iniquitous power--Felix Holt is, I will not\nscruple to say, the innocent victim of a riot; and that deed of strict\nhonesty, whereby he took on himself the charge of his aged mother, seems\nnow to have deprived her of sufficient bread, and is even an occasion of\nreproach to him from the weaker brethren.\"\n\n\"I shall be proud to supply her as amply as you think desirable,\" said\nHarold, not enjoying this lecture.\n\n\"I will pray you to speak of this question with my daughter, who, it\nappears, may herself have large means at command, and would desire to\nminister to Mrs. Holt's needs with all friendship and delicacy. For the\npresent I can take care that she lacks nothing essential.\"\n\nAs Mr. Lyon was speaking, Esther re-entered, equipped for her drive. She\nlaid her hand on her father's arm and said, \"You will let my pupils know\nat once, will you, father?\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my dear,\" said the old man, trembling a little under the\nfeeling that this departure of Esther's was a crisis. Nothing again\nwould be as it had been in their mutual life. But he feared that he was\nbeing mastered by a too tender self-regard, and struggled to keep\nhimself calm.\n\nMrs. Transome and Harold had both risen.\n\n\"If you are quite ready, Miss Lyon,\" said Harold, divining that the\nfather and daughter would like to have an unobserved moment, \"I will\ntake my mother to the carriage and come back for you.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, Esther put her hands on her father's shoulders and\nkissed him.\n\n\"This will not be a grief to you, I hope, father? You think it is better\nthat I should go?\"\n\n\"Nay, child, I am weak. But I would fain be capable of a joy quite apart\nfrom the accidents of my aged earthly existence, which, indeed, is a\npetty and almost dried-up fountain--whereas to the receptive soul the\nriver of life pauses not, nor is diminished.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will see Felix Holt again and tell him all?\"\n\n\"Shall I say aught to him for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; only that Job Tudge has a little flannel shirt and a box of\nlozenges,\" said Esther, smiling. \"Ah, I hear Mr. Transome coming back. I\nmust say good-bye to Lyddy, else she will cry over my hard heart.\"\n\nIn spite of all the grave thoughts that had been, Esther felt it a very\npleasant as well as new experience to be led to the carriage by Harold\nTransome, to be seated on soft cushions, and bowled along, looked at\nadmiringly and deferentially by a person opposite, whom it was agreeable\nto look at in return, and talked to with suavity and liveliness. Toward\nwhat prospect was that easy carriage really leading her? She could not\nbe always asking herself Mentor-like questions. Her young, bright nature\nwas rather weary of the sadness that had grown heavier in these last\nweeks, like a chill white mist hopelessly veiling the day. Her fortune\nwas beginning to appear worthy of being called good fortune. She had\ncome to a new stage in her journey; a new day had arisen on new scenes,\nand her young untired spirit was full of curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n    No man believes that many-textured knowledge and skill--as a just\n    idea of the solar system, or the power of painting flesh, or of\n    reading written harmonies--can come late and of a sudden; yet many\n    will not stick at believing that happiness can come at any day and\n    hour solely by a new disposition of events; though there is naught\n    less capable of a magical production than a mortal's happiness,\n    which is mainly a complex of habitual relations and dispositions\n    not to be wrought by news from foreign parts, or any whirling of\n    fortune's wheel for one on whose brow Time has written legibly.\n\n\nSome days after Esther's arrival at Transome Court, Denner, coming to\ndress Mrs. Transome before dinner--a labor of love for which she had\nample leisure now--found her mistress seated with more than ever of a\nmarble aspect of self-absorbed suffering, which to the waiting-woman's\nkeen observation had been gradually intensifying itself during the past\nweek. She had tapped at the door without having been summoned, and she\nhad ventured to enter though she had heard no voice saying, \"Come in.\"\n\nMrs. Transome had on a dark warm dressing-gown, hanging in thick folds\nabout her, and she was seated before a mirror which filled a panel from\nthe floor to the ceiling. The room was bright with the light of the fire\nand of wax candles. For some reason, contrary to her usual practice,\nMrs. Transome had herself unfastened her abundant gray hair, which\nrolled backward in a pale sunless stream over her dark dress. She was\nseated before the mirror apparently looking at herself, her brow knit in\none deep furrow, and her jewelled hands laid one above the other on her\nknee. Probably she had ceased to see the reflection in the mirror, for\nher eyes had the fixed wide-open look that belongs not to examination,\nbut to reverie. Motionless in that way, her clear-cut features keeping\ndistinct record of past beauty, she looked like an image faded, dried,\nand bleached by uncounted suns, rather than a breathing woman who had\nnumbered the years as they passed, and had a consciousness within her\nwhich was the slow deposit of those ceaseless roiling years.\n\nDenner, with all her ingrained and systematic reserve, could not help\nshowing signs that she was startled, when, peering from between her\nhalf-closed eyelids, she saw the motionless image in the mirror opposite\nto her as she entered. Her gentle opening of the door had not roused her\nmistress, to whom the sensations produced by Denner's presence were as\nlittle disturbing as those of a favorite cat. But the slight cry, and\nthe start reflected in the glass, were unusual enough to break the\nreverie, Mrs. Transome moved, leaned back in her chair, and said--\n\n\"So you're come at last, Denner?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam; it is not late. I'm sorry you should have undone your hair\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I undid it to see what an old hag I am. These fine clothes you put on\nme, Denner, are only a smart shroud.\"\n\n\"Pray don't talk so, madam. If there's anybody doesn't think it pleasant\nto look at you, so much the worse for them. For my part, I've seen no\nyoung ones fit to hold up your train. Look at your likeness down below;\nand though you're older now, what signifies? I wouldn't be Letty in the\nscullery because she's got red cheeks. She mayn't know she's a poor\ncreature, but I know it, and that's enough for me; I know what sort of a\ndowdy draggletail she'll be in ten years' time. I would change with\nnobody, madam. And if troubles were put up to market, I'd sooner buy old\nthan new. It's something to have seen the worst.\"\n\n\"A woman never has seen the worst till she is old, Denner,\" said Mrs.\nTransome, bitterly.\n\nThe keen little waiting-woman was not clear as to the cause of her\nmistress's added bitterness; but she rarely brought herself to ask\nquestions, when Mrs. Transome did not authorize them by beginning to\ngive her information. Banks the bailiff and the head-servant had nodded\nand winked a good deal over the certainty that Mr. Harold was \"none so\nfond\" of Jermyn, but this was a subject on which Mrs. Transome had never\nmade up her mind to speak, and Denner knew nothing definite. Again, she\nfelt quite sure that there was some important secret connected with\nEsther's presence in the house; she suspected that the close Dominic\nknew the secret, and was more trusted than she was, in spite of her\nforty years' service; but any resentment on this ground would have been\nan entertained reproach against her mistress, inconsistent with Denner's\ncreed and character. She inclined to the belief that Esther was the\nimmediate cause of the new discontent.\n\n\"If there's anything worse coming to you, I should like to know what it\nis, madam,\" she said, after a moment's silence, speaking always in the\nsame low quick way, and keeping up her quiet labors. \"When I awake at\ncock-crow, I'd sooner have one real grief on my mind than twenty false.\nIt's better to know one's robbed than to think one's going to be\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"I believe you are the creature in the world that loves me best, Denner;\nyet you will never understand what I suffer. It's of no use telling you.\nThere's no folly in you, and no heartache. You are made of iron. You\nhave never had any trouble.\"\n\n\"I've had some of your trouble, madam.\"\n\n\"Yes, you good thing. But as a sick-nurse, that never caught the fever.\nYou never even had a child.\"\n\n\"I can feel for things I never went through. I used to be sorry for the\npoor French Queen when I was young; I'd have lain cold for her to lie\nwarm. I know people have feelings according to their birth and station.\nAnd you always took things to heart, madam, beyond anybody else. But I\nhope there's nothing new, to make you talk of the worst.\"\n\n\"Yes, Denner, there is--there is,\" said Mrs. Transome, speaking in a low\ntone of misery, while she bent for her head-dress to be pinned on.\n\n\"Is it this young lady?\"\n\n\"Why, what do you think about her, Denner?\" said Mrs. Transome, in a\ntone of more spirit, rather curious to hear what the old woman would\nsay.\n\n\"I don't deny she's graceful, and she has a pretty smile and very good\nmanners: it's quite unaccountable by what Banks says about her father. I\nknow nothing of those Treby townsfolk myself, but for my part I'm\npuzzled. I'm fond of Mr. Harold. I always shall be, madam. I was at his\nbringing into the world, and nothing but his doing wrong by you would\nturn me against him. But the servants all say he's in love with Miss\nLyon.\"\n\n\"I wish it were true, Denner,\" said Mrs. Transome, energetically. \"I\nwish he were in love with her, so that she could master him, and make\nhim do what she pleased.\"\n\n\"Then it is not true--what they say?\"\n\n\"Not true that she will ever master him. No woman ever will. He will\nmake her fond of him, and afraid of him. That's one of the things you\nhave never gone through, Denner. A woman's love is always freezing into\nfear. She wants everything, she is secure of nothing. This girl has a\nfine spirit--plenty of fire and pride and wit. Men like such captives,\nas they like horses that champ the bit and paw the ground: they feel\nmore triumph in their mastery. What is the use of a woman's will?--if\nshe tries, she doesn't get it, and she ceases to be loved. God was cruel\nwhen He made women.\"\n\nDenner was used to such outbursts as this. Her mistress's rhetoric and\ntemper belonged to her superior rank, her grand person, and her piercing\nblack eyes. Mrs. Transome had a sense of impiety in her words which made\nthem all the more tempting to her impotent anger. The waiting-woman had\nnone of that awe which could be turned into defiance: the Sacred Grove\nwas a common thicket to her.\n\n\"It mayn't be good luck to be a woman,\" she said. \"But one begins with\nit from a baby: one gets used to it. And I shouldn't like to be a\nman--to cough so loud, and stand straddling about on a wet day, and be\nso wasteful with meat and drink. They're a coarse lot, I think. Then I\nneedn't make a trouble of this young lady, madam,\" she added, after a\nmoment's pause.\n\n\"No, Denner, I like her. If that were all--I should like Harold to marry\nher. It would be the best thing. If the truth were known--and it will be\nknown soon--the estate is hers by law--such law as it is. It's a strange\nstory: she's a Bycliffe really.\"\n\nDenner did not look amazed, but went on fastening her mistress's dress,\nas she said--\n\n\"Well, madam, I was sure there was something wonderful at the bottom of\nit. And turning the old lawsuits and everything else over in my mind, I\nthought the law might have something to do with it. Then she is a born\nlady?\"\n\n\"Yes; she has good blood in her veins.\"\n\n\"We talked that over in the housekeeper's room--what a hand and an\ninstep she has, and how her head is set on her shoulders--almost like\nyour own, madam. But her lightish complexion spoils her, to my thinking.\nAnd Dominic said Mr. Harold never admired that sort of woman before.\nThere's nothing that smooth fellow couldn't tell you if he would: he\nknows the answer to riddles before they're made. However, he knows how\nto hold his tongue; I'll say that for him. And so do I, madam.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; you will not talk of it till other people are talking of it.\"\n\n\"And so, if Mr. Harold married her, it would save all fuss and\nmischief?\"\n\n\"Yes--about the estate.\"\n\n\"And he seems inclined; and she'll not refuse him, I'll answer for it.\nAnd you like her, madam. There's everything to set your mind at rest.\"\n\nDenner was putting the finishing-touch to Mrs. Transome's dress by\nthrowing an Indian scarf over her shoulders, and so completing the\ncontrast between the majestic lady in costume and the dishevelled\nHecuba-like woman whom she had found half an hour before.\n\n\"I am not at rest!\" Mrs. Transome said, with slow distinctness, moving\nfrom the mirror to the window, where the blind was not drawn down, and\nshe could see the chill white landscape and the far-off unheeding stars.\n\nDenner, more distressed by her mistress's suffering than she could have\nbeen by anything else, took up with the instinct of affection a gold\nvinaigrette which Mrs. Transome often liked to carry with her, and going\nup to her put it into her hand gently. Mrs. Transome grasped the little\nwoman's hand hard, and held it so.\n\n\"Denner,\" she said, in a low tone, \"if I could choose at this moment, I\nwould choose that Harold should never have been born.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear,\" (Denner had only once before in her life said \"my dear\"\nto her mistress), \"it was a happiness to you then.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I felt the happiness then as I feel the misery now. It\nis foolish to say people can't feel much when they are getting old. Not\npleasure, perhaps--little comes. But they can feel they are\nforsaken--why, every fibre in me seems to be a memory that makes a pang.\nThey can feel that all the love in their lives is turned to hatred or\ncontempt.\"\n\n\"Not mine, madam, not mine. Let what would be I should want to live for\nyour sake, for fear you should have nobody to do for you as I would.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you are a happy woman, Denner; you have loved somebody for\nforty years who is old and weak now, and can't do without you.\"\n\nThe sound of the dinner-gong resounded below, and Mrs. Transome let the\nfaithful hand fall again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n    \"She's beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:\n    She is a woman; therefore to be won.\"\n\n                                               --_Henry IV._\n\n\nIf Denner had had a suspicion that Esther's presence at Transome Court\nwas not agreeable to her mistress, it was impossible to entertain such a\nsuspicion with regard to the other members of the family. Between her\nand little Harry there was an extraordinary fascination. This creature,\nwith the soft, broad, brown cheeks, low forehead, great black eyes,\ntiny, well-defined nose, fierce, biting tricks toward every person and\nthing he disliked, and insistence on entirely occupying those he liked,\nwas a human specimen such as Esther had never seen before, and she\nseemed to be equally original in Harry's experience. At first sight her\nlight complexion and her blue gown, probably also her sunny smile and\nher hands stretched out toward him, seemed to make a show for him as of\na new sort of bird: he threw himself backward against his \"Gappa,\" as he\ncalled old Mr. Transome, and stared at this new comer with the gravity\nof a wild animal. But she had no sooner sat down on the sofa in the\nlibrary than he climbed up to her, and began to treat her as an\nattractive object in natural history, snatched up her curls with his\nbrown fist, and, discovering that there was a little ear under them,\npinched it and blew into it, pulled at her coronet of plaits, and seemed\nto discover with satisfaction that it did not grow at the summit of her\nhead, but could be dragged down and altogether undone. Then finding that\nshe laughed, tossed him back, kissed, and pretended to bite him--in\nfact, was an animal that understood fun--he rushed off and made Dominic\nbring a small menagerie of white mice, squirrels, and birds, with Moro,\nthe black spaniel, to make her acquaintance. Whomsoever Harry liked, it\nfollowed that Mr. Transome must like: \"Gappa,\" along with Nimrod the\nretriever, was part of the menagerie, and perhaps endured more than all\nthe other live creatures in the way of being tumbled about. Seeing that\nEsther bore having her hair pulled down quite merrily, and that she was\nwilling to be harnessed and beaten, the old man began to confide to her,\nin his feeble, smiling, and rather jerking fashion, Harry's remarkable\nfeats: how he had one day, when Gappy was asleep, unpinned a whole\ndrawerful of beetles, to see if they would fly away; then, disgusted\nwith their stupidity, was about to throw them all on the ground and\nstamp on them, when Dominic came in and rescued these valuable\nspecimens; also, how he had subtly watched Mrs. Transome at the cabinet\nwhere she kept her medicines, and, when she had left it for a little\nwhile without locking it, had gone to the drawers and scattered half the\ncontents on the floor. But what old Mr. Transome thought the most\nwonderful proof of an almost preternatural cleverness was, that Harry\nwould hardly ever talk, but preferred making inarticulate noises, or\ncombining syllables after a method of his own.\n\n\"He can talk well enough if he likes,\" said Gappa, evidently thinking\nthat Harry, like the monkeys, had deep reasons for his reticence.\n\n\"You mind him,\" he added, nodding at Esther, and shaking with low-toned\nlaughter. \"You'll hear: he knows the right names of things well enough,\nbut he likes to make his own. He'll give you one all to yourself before\nlong.\"\n\nAnd when Harry seemed to have made up his mind distinctly that Esther's\nname was \"Boo,\" Mr. Transome nodded at her with triumphant satisfaction,\nand then told her in a low whisper, looking round cautiously beforehand,\nthat Harry would never call Mrs. Transome \"Gamma,\" but always \"Bite.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful!\" said he, laughing slyly.\n\nThe old man seemed so happy now in the new world created for him by\nDominic and Harry, that he would perhaps have made a holocaust of his\nflies and beetles if it had been necessary in order to keep this living,\nlively kindness about him. He no longer confined himself to the library,\nbut shuffled along from room to room, staying and looking on at what was\ngoing forward whenever he did not find Mrs. Transome alone.\n\nTo Esther the sight of this feeble-minded, timid, paralytic man, who had\nlong abdicated all mastery over the things that were his, was something\npiteous. Certainly this had never been part of the furniture she had\nimagined for the delightful aristocratic dwelling in her Utopia; and the\nsad irony of such a lot impressed her the more because in her father she\nwas accustomed to age accompanied with mental acumen and activity. Her\nthoughts went back in conjecture over the past life of Mr. and Mrs.\nTransome, a couple so strangely different from each other. She found it\nimpossible to arrange their existence in the seclusion of this fine park\nand in this lofty large-roomed house, where it seemed quite ridiculous\nto be anything so small as a human being, without finding it rather\ndull. Mr. Transome had always had his beetles, but Mrs. Transome----? it\nwas not easy to conceive that the husband and wife had ever been very\nfond of each other.\n\nEsther felt at her ease with Mrs. Transome: she was gratified by the\nconsciousness--for on this point Esther was very quick--that Mrs.\nTransome admired her, and looked at her with satisfied eyes. But when\nthey were together in the early days of her stay, the conversation\nturned chiefly on what happened in Mrs. Transome's youth--what she wore\nwhen she was presented at Court--who were the most distinguished and\nbeautiful women at that time--the terrible excitement of the French\nRevolution--the emigrants she had known, and the history of various\ntitled members of the Lingon family. And Esther, from native delicacy,\ndid not lead to more recent topics of a personal kind. She was copiously\ninstructed that the Lingon family was better than that even of the elder\nTransomes, and was privileged with an explanation of the various\nquarterings, which proved that the Lingon blood had been continually\nenriched. Poor Mrs. Transome, with her secret bitterness and dread,\nstill found a flavor in this sort of pride; none the less because\ncertain deeds of her own life had been in fatal inconsistency with it.\nBesides, genealogies entered into her stock of ideas, and her talk on\nsuch subjects was as necessary as the notes of the linnet or the\nblackbird. She had no ultimate analysis of things that went beyond blood\nand family--the Herons of Fenshore or the Badgers of Hillbury. She had\nnever seen behind the canvas with which her life was hung. In the dim\nbackground there was the burning mount and the tables of the law; in the\nforeground there was Lady Debarry privately gossipping about her, and\nLady Wyvern finally deciding not to send her invitations to dinner.\nUnlike that Semiramis who made laws to suit her practical license, she\nlived, poor soul, in the midst of desecrated sanctities, and of honors\nthat looked tarnished in the light of monotonous and weary suns.\nGlimpses of the Lingon heraldry in their freshness were interesting to\nEsther; but it occurred to her that when she had known about them a good\nwhile they would cease to be succulent themes of converse or meditation,\nand Mrs. Transome, having known them all along, might have felt a vacuum\nin spite of them.\n\nNevertheless it was entertaining at present to be seated on soft\ncushions with her netting before her, while Mrs. Transome went on with\nher embroidery, and told in that easy phrase, and with that refined\nhigh-bred tone and accent which she possessed in perfection, family\nstories that to Esther were like so many novelettes; what diamonds were\nin the Earl's family, own cousins to Mrs. Transome; how poor Lady Sara's\nhusband went off into jealous madness only a month after their marriage,\nand dragged that sweet blue-eyed thing by the hair; and how the\nbrilliant Fanny, having married a country parson, became so niggardly\nthat she had gone about almost begging for fresh eggs from the farmers'\nwives, though she had done very well with her six sons, as there was a\nbishop and no end of interest in the family, and two of them got\nappointments in India.\n\nAt present Mrs. Transome did not touch at all on her own time of\nprivation, or her troubles with her eldest son, or on anything that lay\nvery close to her heart. She conversed with Esther, and acted the part\nof hostess, as she performed her toilet and went on with her embroidery:\nthese things were to be done whether one were happy or miserable. Even\nthe patriarch Job, if he had been a gentleman of the modern West, would\nhave avoided picturesque disorder and poetical laments; and the friends\nwho called on him, though not less disposed than Bildad the Shuhite to\nhint that their unfortunate friend was in the wrong, would have sat on\nchairs and held their hats in their hands. The harder problems of our\nlife have changed less than our manners; we wrestle with the old\nsorrows, but more decorously. Esther's inexperience prevented her from\ndivining much about this fine gray-haired woman, whom she could not help\nperceiving to stand apart from the family group, as if there were some\ncause of isolation for her both within and without. To her young heart\nthere was a peculiar interest in Mrs. Transome. An elderly woman, whose\nbeauty, position, and graceful kindness toward herself, made deference\nto her spontaneous, was a new figure in Esther's experience. Her quick\nlight movement was always ready to anticipate what Mrs. Transome wanted;\nher bright apprehension and silvery speech were always ready to cap Mrs.\nTransome's narratives or instructions even about doses and liniments,\nwith some lively commentary. She must have behaved charmingly; for one\nday when she had tripped across the room to put the screen just in the\nright place, Mrs. Transome said, taking her hand, \"My dear, you make me\nwish I had a daughter!\"\n\nThat was pleasant; and so it was to be decked by Mrs. Transome's own\nhands in a set of turquoise ornaments, which became her wonderfully,\nworn with a white Cashmere dress, which was also insisted on. Esther\nnever reflected that there was a double intention in these pretty ways\ntoward her; with young generosity, she was rather preoccupied by the\ndesire to prove that she herself entertained no low triumph in the fact\nthat she had rights prejudicial to this family whose life she was\nlearning. And besides, through all Mrs. Transome's perfect manners,\nthere pierced some undefinable indications of a hidden anxiety much\ndeeper than anything she could feel about this affair of the estate--to\nwhich she often alluded slightly as a reason for informing Esther of\nsomething. It was impossible to mistake her for a happy woman; and young\nspeculation is always stirred by discontent for which there is no\nobvious cause. When we are older, we take the uneasy eyes and the bitter\nlips more as a matter of course.\n\nBut Harold Transome was more communicative about recent years than his\nmother was. He thought it well that Esther should know how the fortune\nof his family had been drained by law expenses, owing to suits\nmistakenly urged by her family; he spoke of his mother's lonely life\nand pinched circumstances, of her lack of comfort in her elder son, and\nof the habit she had consequently acquired of looking at the gloomy side\nof things. He hinted that she had been accustomed to dictate, and that,\nas he had left her when he was a boy, she had perhaps indulged the dream\nthat he would come back a boy. She was still sore on the point of his\npolitics. These things could not be helped, but so far as he could, he\nwished to make the rest of her life as cheerful as possible.\n\nEsther listened eagerly, and took these things to heart. The claim to an\ninheritance, the sudden discovery of a right to a fortune held by\nothers, was acquiring a very distinct and unexpected meaning for her.\nEvery day she was getting more clearly into her imagination what it\nwould be to abandon her own past, and what she would enter into in\nexchange for it; what it would be to disturb a long possession, and how\ndifficult it was to fix a point at which the disturbance might begin, so\nas to be contemplated without pain.\n\nHarold Transome's thoughts turned on the same subject, but accompanied\nby a different state of feeling and with more definite resolutions. He\nsaw a mode of reconciling all difficulties, which looked pleasanter to\nhim the longer he looked at Esther. When she had been hardly a week in\nthe house, he had made up his mind to marry her; and it had never\nentered into that mind that the decision did not rest entirely with his\ninclination. It was not that he thought slightly of Esther's demands; he\nsaw that she would require considerable attractions to please her, and\nthat there were difficulties to be overcome. She was clearly a girl who\nmust be wooed; but Harold did not despair of presenting the requisite\nattractions, and the difficulties gave more interest to the wooing than\nhe could have believed. When he had said that he would not marry an\nEnglishwoman, he had always made a mental reservation in favor of\npeculiar circumstances; and now the peculiar circumstances were come. To\nbe deeply in love was a catastrophe not likely to happen to him; but he\nwas readily amorous. No woman could make him miserable, but he was\nsensitive to the presence of women, and was kind to them; not with\ngrimaces, like a man of mere gallantry, but beamingly, easily, like a\nman of genuine good-nature. And each day he was near Esther, the\nsolution of all difficulties by marriage became a more pleasing\nprospect; though he had to confess to himself that the difficulties did\nnot diminish on a nearer view, in spite of the flattering sense that\nshe brightened at his approach.\n\nHarold was not one to fail in a purpose for want of assiduity. After an\nhour or two devoted to business in the morning, he went to look for\nEsther, and if he did not find her at play with Harry and old Mr.\nTransome, or chatting with his mother, he went into the drawing-room,\nwhere she was usually either seated with a book on her knee and \"making\na bed for her cheek\" with one little hand, while she looked out of the\nwindow, or else standing in front of one of the full-length family\nportraits with an air of rumination. Esther found it impossible to read\nin these days; her life was a book which she seemed herself to be\nconstructing--trying to make character clear before her, and looking\ninto the ways of destiny.\n\nThe active Harold had almost always something definite to propose by way\nof filling the time; if it were fine, she must walk out with him and see\nthe grounds; and when the snow melted and it was no longer slippery, she\nmust get on horseback and learn to ride. If they staid indoors, she must\nlearn to play at billiards, or she must go over the house and see the\npictures he had had hung anew, or the costumes he had brought from the\nEast; or come into his study and look at the map of the estate, and hear\nwhat--if it had remained in his family--he had intended to do in every\ncorner of it in order to make the most of its capabilities.\n\nAbout a certain time in the morning Esther had learned to expect him.\nLet every wooer make himself strongly expected; he may succeed by dint\nof being absent, but hardly in the first instance. One morning Harold\nfound her in the drawing-room, leaning against a console-table, and\nlooking at the full-length portrait of a certain Lady Betty Transome,\nwho had lived a century and a half before, and had the usual charm of\nladies in Sir Peter Lely's style.\n\n\"Don't move, pray,\" he said on entering; \"you look as if you were\nstanding for your own portrait.\"\n\n\"I take that as an insinuation,\" said Esther, laughing, and moving\ntoward her seat on an ottoman near the fire, \"for I notice almost all\nthe portraits are in a conscious, affected attitude. That fair Lady\nBetty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture, and had not\nwill enough of her own ever to move again unless she had a little push\ngiven to her.\"\n\n\"She brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt,\" said\nHarold, as he followed Esther, \"but alive I dare say she would have been\nless cheerful company.\"\n\n\"One would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver\npaper. Ah, how chivalrous you are!\" said Esther, as Harold, kneeling on\none knee, held her silken netting-stirrup for her to put her foot\nthrough. She had often fancied pleasant scenes in which such homage was\nrendered to her, and the homage was not disagreeable now it was really\ncome; but, strangely enough, a little darting sensation at that moment\nwas accompanied by the vivid remembrance of some one who had never paid\nthe least attention to her foot. There had been a slight blush, such as\noften came and went rapidly, and she was silent a moment. Harold\nnaturally believed that it was he himself who was filling the field of\nvision. He would have liked to place himself on the ottoman near Esther,\nand behave very much more like a lover; but he took a chair opposite to\nher at a circumspect distance. He dared not do otherwise. Along with\nEsther's playful charm she conveyed an impression of personal pride and\nhigh spirit which warned Harold's acuteness that in the delicacy of\ntheir present position he might easily make a false move and offend her.\nA woman was likely to be credulous about adoration, and to find no\ndifficulty in referring it to her intrinsic attractions; but Esther was\ntoo dangerously quick and critical not to discern the least awkwardness\nthat looked like offering her marriage as a convenient compromise for\nhimself. Beforehand, he might have said that such characteristics as\nhers were not loveable in a woman; but, as it was, he found that the\nhope of pleasing her had a piquancy quite new to him.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Esther, breaking the silence in her usual light silvery\ntones--\"I wonder whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any\ntroubles. I see there are two old ones up-stairs in the billiard-room\nwho have only got fat; the expression of their faces is just of the same\nsort.\"\n\n\"A woman ought never to have any trouble. There should always be a man\nto guard her from it. (Harold Transome was masculine and fallible; he\nhad incautiously sat down this morning to pay his addresses by talk\nabout nothing in particular; and, clever experienced man as he was, he\nfell into nonsense.)\n\n\"But suppose the man himself got into trouble--you would wish her to\nmind about that. Or suppose,\" added Esther, suddenly looking up merrily\nat Harold, \"the man himself was troublesome?\"\n\n\"Oh, you must not strain probabilities in that way. The generality of\nmen are perfect. Take me, for example.\"\n\n\"You are a perfect judge of sauces,\" said Esther, who had her triumphs\nin letting Harold know that she was capable of taking notes.\n\n\"That is perfection number one. Pray go on.\"\n\n\"Oh, the catalogue is too long--I should be tired before I got to your\nmagnificent ruby ring and your gloves always of the right color.\"\n\n\"If you would let me tell you your perfections, I should not be tired.\"\n\n\"That is not complimentary; it means that the list is short.\"\n\n\"No; it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon.\"\n\n\"Pray don't begin,\" said Esther, with her pretty toss of the head; \"it\nwould be dangerous to our good understanding. The person I liked best in\nthe world was one who did nothing but scold me and tell me of my\nfaults.\"\n\nWhen Esther began to speak, she meant to do no more than make a remote\nunintelligible allusion, feeling, it must be owned, a naughty will to\nflirt and be saucy, and thwart Harold's attempts to be felicitous in\ncompliment. But she had no sooner uttered the words than they seemed to\nher like a confession. A deep flush spread itself over her face and\nneck, and the sense that she was blushing went on deepening her color.\nHarold felt himself unpleasantly illuminated as to a possibility that\nhad never yet occurred to him. His surprise made an uncomfortable pause,\nin which Esther had time to feel much vexation.\n\n\"You speak in the past tense,\" said Harold, at last; \"yet I am rather\nenvious of that person. I shall never be able to win your regard in the\nsame way. Is it anyone at Treby? Because in that case I can enquire\nabout your faults.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know I have always lived among grave people,\" said Esther, more\nable to recover herself now she was spoken to. \"Before I came home to be\nwith my father I was nothing but a school-girl first, and then a teacher\nin different stages of growth. People in those circumstances are not\nusually flattered. But there are varieties in fault-finding. At our\nParis school the master I liked best was an old man who stormed at me\nterribly when I read Racine, but yet showed that he was proud of me.\"\n\nEsther was getting quite cool again. But Harold was not entirely\nsatisfied; if there was any obstacle in his way, he wished to know\nexactly what it was.\n\n\"That must have been a wretched life for you at Treby,\" he said--\"a\nperson of your accomplishments.\"\n\n\"I used to be dreadfully discontented,\" said Esther, much occupied with\nmistakes she had made in her netting. \"But I was becoming less so. I\nhave had time to get rather wise, you know; I am two-and-twenty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harold, rising and walking a few paces backward and forward,\n\"you are past your majority; you are empress of your own fortunes--and\nmore besides.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Esther, letting her work fall, and leaning back against\nthe cushions; \"I don't think I know very well what to do with my\nempire.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Harold, pausing in front of her, leaning one arm on the\nmantelpiece, and speaking very gravely, \"I hope that in any case, since\nyou appear to have no near relative who understands affairs, you will\nconfide in me, and trust me with all your intentions as if I had no\nother personal concern in the matter than a regard for you. I hope you\nbelieve me capable of acting as the guardian of your interest, even\nwhere it turns out to be inevitably opposed to my own.\"\n\n\"I am sure you have given me reason to believe it,\" said Esther, with\nseriousness, putting out her hand to Harold. She had not been left in\nignorance that he had had opportunities twice offered of stifling her\nclaims.\n\nHarold raised the hand to his lips, but dared not retain it more than an\ninstant. Still the sweet reliance in Esther's manner made an\nirresistible temptation to him. After standing still a moment or two,\nwhile she bent over her work, he glided to the ottoman and seated\nhimself close by her, looking at her busy hands.\n\n\"I see you have made mistakes in your work,\" he said, bending still\nnearer, for he saw that she was conscious, yet not angry.\n\n\"Nonsense! you know nothing about it,\" said Esther, laughing, and\ncrushing up the soft silk under her palms. \"Those blunders have a design\nin them.\"\n\nShe looked round, and saw a handsome face very near her. Harold was\nlooking, as he felt, thoroughly enamored of this bright woman, who was\nnot at all to his preconceived taste. Perhaps a touch of hypothetic\njealousy now helped to heighten the effect. But he mastered all\nindiscretion, and only looked at her as he said--\n\n\"I am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that I\ncan't guess.\"\n\n\"Pray don't speak of my wishes,\" said Esther, quite overmastered by this\nnew and apparently involuntary manifestation in Harold; \"I could not\npossibly tell you one at this moment--I think I shall never find them\nout again. Oh, yes,\" she said, abruptly, struggling to relieve herself\nfrom the oppression of unintelligible feelings--\"I do know one wish\ndistinctly. I want to go and see my father. He writes me word that all\nis well with him, but still I want to see him.\"\n\n\"You shall be driven there when you like.\"\n\n\"May I go now--I mean as soon as it is convenient?\" said Esther, rising.\n\n\"I will give the order immediately, if you wish it,\" said Harold,\nunderstanding that the audience was broken up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n    He rates me as the merchant does the wares\n    He will not purchase--\"quality not high\n    'Twill lose its color opened to the sun,\n    Has no aroma, and, in fine, is naught--\n    I barter not for such commodities--\n    There is no ratio betwixt sands and gems.\"\n    'Tis wicked judgment! for the soul can grow,\n    As embryos, that live and move but blindly,\n    Burst from the dark, emerge, regenerate,\n    And lead a life of vision and of choice.\n\n\nEsther did not take the carriage into Malthouse Lane, but left it to\nwait for her outside the town; and when she entered the house she put\nher finger on her lip to Lyddy and ran lightly up-stairs. She wished to\nsurprise her father by this visit, and she succeeded. The little\nminister was just then almost surrounded by a wall of books, with merely\nhis head peeping above them, being much embarrassed to find a substitute\nfor tables and desks on which to arrange the volumes he kept open for\nreference. He was absorbed in mastering all those painstaking\ninterpretations of the Book of Daniel, which are by this time well gone\nto the limbo of mistaken criticism; and Esther, as she opened the door\nsoftly, heard him rehearsing aloud a passage in which he declared, with\nsome parenthetic provisoes, that he conceived not how a perverse\ningenuity could blunt the edge of prophetic explicitness, or how an open\nmind could fail to see in the chronology of \"the little horn\" the\nresplendent lamp of an inspired symbol searching out the germinal growth\nof an anti-Christian power.\n\n\"You will not like me to interrupt you, father?\" said Esther, slyly.\n\n\"Ah, my beloved child!\" he exclaimed, upsetting a pile of books, and\nthus unintentionally making a convenient breach in his wall, through\nwhich Esther could get up to him and kiss him. \"Thy appearing is as a\njoy despaired of. I had thought of thee as the blinded think of the\ndaylight--which indeed is a thing to rejoice in, like all other good,\nthough we see it not nigh.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you have been as well and comfortable as you said you were\nin your letters?\" said Esther, seating herself close in front of her\nfather and laying her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"I wrote truly, my dear, according to my knowledge at the time. But to\nan old memory like mine the present days are but as a little water\npoured on the deep. It seems now that all has been as usual, except my\nstudies, which have gone somewhat curiously into prophetic history. But\nI fear you will rebuke me for my negligent apparel,\" said the little\nman, feeling in front of Esther's brightness like a bat overtaken by the\nmorning.\n\n\"That is Lyddy's fault, who sits crying over her want of Christian\nassurance instead of brushing your clothes and putting out your clean\ncravat. She is always saying her righteousness is filthy rags, and\nreally I don't think that is a very strong expression for it. I'm sure\nit is dusty clothes and furniture.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear, your playfulness glances too severely on our faithful\nLyddy. Doubtless I am myself deficient, in that I do not aid her infirm\nmemory by admonition. But now tell me aught that you have left untold\nabout yourself. Your heart has gone out somewhat toward this family--the\nold man and the child, whom I had not reckoned of?\"\n\n\"Yes, father. It is more and more difficult to me to see how I can make\nup my mind to disturb these people at all.\"\n\n\"Something should doubtless be devised to lighten the loss and the\nchange to the aged father and mother. I would have you in any case seek\nto temper a vicissitude, which is nevertheless a providential\narrangement not to be wholly set aside.\"\n\n\"Do you think, father--do you feel assured that a case of inheritance\nlike this of mine is a sort of providential arrangement that makes a\ncommand?\"\n\n\"I have so held it,\" said Mr. Lyon, solemnly; \"in all my meditations I\nhave so held it. For you have to consider, my dear, that you have been\nled by a peculiar path, and into experience which is not ordinarily the\nlot of those who are seated in high places, and what I have hinted to\nyou already in my letters on this head, I shall wish on a future\nopportunity to enter into more at large.\"\n\nEsther was uneasily silent. On this great question of her lot she saw\ndoubts and difficulties, in which it seemed as if her father could not\nhelp her. There was no illumination for her in this theory of\nprovidential arrangement. She said suddenly (what she had not thought of\nat all suddenly)--\n\n\"Have you been again to see Felix Holt, father? You have not mentioned\nhim in your letters.\"\n\n\"I have been since I last wrote, my dear, and I took his mother with me,\nwho, I fear, made the time heavy to him with her plaints. But afterward\nI carried her away to the house of a brother minister at Loamford, and\nreturned to Felix, and then we had much discourse.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him of everything that has happened--I mean about\nme--about the Transomes?\"\n\n\"Assuredly I told him, and he listened as one astonished. For he had\nmuch to hear, knowing naught of your birth, and that you had any other\nfather than Rufus Lyon. 'Tis a narrative I trust I shall not be called\non to give to others; but I was not without satisfaction in unfolding\nthe truth to this young man, who hath wrought himself into my affection\nstrangely--I would fain hope for ends that will be a visible good in his\nless way-worn life, when mine shall be no longer.\"\n\n\"And you told him how the Transomes had come, and that I was staying at\nTransome Court?\"\n\n\"Yes, I told these things with some particularity, as is my wont\nconcerning what hath imprinted itself on my mind.\"\n\n\"What did Felix say?\"\n\n\"Truly, my dear, nothing desirable to recite,\" said Mr. Lyon, rubbing\nhis hand over his brow.\n\n\"Dear father, he did say something, and you always remember what people\nsay. Pray tell me; I want to know.\"\n\n\"It was a hasty remark, and rather escaped him than was consciously\nframed. He said, 'Then she will marry Transome; that is what Transome\nmeans.'\"\n\n\"That was all?\" said Esther, turning rather pale, and biting her lip\nwith the determination that the tears should not start.\n\n\"Yes, we did not go further into that branch of the subject. I apprehend\nthere is no warrant for his seeming prognostic, and I should not be\nwithout disquiet if I thought otherwise. For I confess that in your\naccession to this great position and property, I contemplate with\nhopeful satisfaction your remaining attached to that body of\ncongregational Dissent, which, as I hold, hath retained most of pure and\nprimitive discipline. Your education and peculiar history would thus be\nseen to have coincided with a long train of events in making this family\nproperty a means of honoring and illustrating a purer form of\nChristianity than that which hath unhappily obtained the pre-eminence in\nthis land. I speak, my child, as you know, always in the hope that you\nwill fully join our communion; and this dear wish of my heart--nay, this\nurgent prayer--would seem to be frustrated by your marriage with a man,\nof whom there is at least no visible indication that he would unite\nhimself to our body.\"\n\nIf Esther had been less agitated, she would hardly have helped smiling\nat the picture her father's words suggested of Harold Transome \"joining\nthe church\" in Malthouse Yard. But she was too seriously preoccupied\nwith what Felix had said, which hurt her in a two-edged fashion that was\nhighly significant. First, she was very angry with him for daring to say\npositively whom she would marry; and secondly, she was angry at the\nimplication that there was from the first a cool deliberate design in\nHarold Transome to marry her. Esther said to herself that she was quite\ncapable of discerning Harold Transome's disposition, and judging of his\nconduct. She felt sure he was generous and open. It did not lower him in\nher opinion that since circumstances had brought them together he\nevidently admired her--was in love with her--in short, desired to marry\nher; and she thought that she discerned the delicacy which hindered him\nfrom being more explicit. There is no point on which young women are\nmore easily piqued than this of their sufficiency to judge the men who\nmake love to them. And Esther's generous nature delighted to believe in\ngenerosity. All these thoughts were making a tumult in her mind while\nher father was suggesting the radiance her lot might cast on the cause\nof congregational Dissent. She heard what he said, and remembered it\nafterward, but she made no reply at present, and chose rather to start\nup in search of a brush--an action which would seem to her father quite\na usual sequence with her. It served the purpose of diverting him from a\nlengthy subject.\n\n\"Have you yet spoken with Mr. Transome concerning Mrs. Holt, my dear?\"\nhe said, as Esther was moving about the room. \"I hinted to him that you\nwould best decide how assistance should be tendered to her.\"\n\n\"No, father, we have not approached the subject. Mr. Transome may have\nforgotten it, and, for several reasons, I would rather not talk of\nthis--of money matters to him at present. There is money due to me from\nthe Lukyns and the Pendrells.\"\n\n\"They have paid it,\" said Mr. Lyon, opening his desk. \"I have it here\nready to deliver to you.\"\n\n\"Keep it, father, and pay Mrs. Holt's rent with it, and do anything else\nthat is wanted for her. We must consider everything temporary now,\" said\nEsther, enveloping her father in a towel, and beginning to brush his\nauburn fringe of hair, while he shut his eyes in preparation for this\npleasant passivity. \"Everything is uncertain--what may become of\nFelix--what may become of us all. Oh, dear!\" she went on, changing\nsuddenly to laughing merriment, \"I am beginning to talk like Lyddy, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Lyon, smiling, \"the uncertainty of things is a text\nrather too wide and obvious for fruitful application; and to discourse\nof it is, as one may say, to bottle up the air, and make a present of it\nto those who are already standing out of doors.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Esther, in the course of their chat, \"that the\nTreby people know at all about the reasons of my being at Transome\nCourt?\"\n\n\"I have had no sign thereof: and indeed there is no one, as it appears,\nwho could make the story public. The man Christian is away in London\nwith Mr. Debarry, Parliament now beginning; and Mr. Jermyn would\ndoubtless respect the confidence of the Transomes. I have not seen him\nlately. I know nothing of his movements. And so far as my own speech is\nconcerned, and my strict command to Lyddy, I have withheld the means of\ninformation even as to your having returned to Transome Court in the\ncarriage, not wishing to give any occasion to solicitous questioning\ntill time hath somewhat inured me. But it hath got abroad that you are\nthere, and is the subject of conjectures, whereof, I imagine, the chief\nis, that you are gone as companion to Mistress Transome; for some of our\nfriends have already hinted a rebuke to me that I should permit your\ntaking a position so little likely to further your spiritual welfare.\"\n\n\"Now, father, I think I shall be obliged to run away from you, not to\nkeep the carriage too long,\" said Esther, as she finished her reforms on\nthe minister's toilet. \"You look beautiful now, and I must give Lyddy a\nlittle lecture before I go.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; I would not detain you, seeing that my duties demand me.\nBut take with you this Treatise, which I have purposely selected. It\nconcerns all the main questions between ourselves and the\nEstablishment--government, discipline, state-support. It is seasonable\nthat you should give a nearer attention to these polemics, lest you be\ndrawn aside by the fallacious association of a State Church with\nelevated rank.\"\n\nEsther chose to take the volume submissively, rather than to adopt the\nungraceful sincerity of saying that she was unable at present to give\nher mind to the original functions of a bishop or the comparative merit\nof Endowments and Voluntaryism. But she did not run her eyes over the\npages during her solitary drive to get a foretaste of the argument, for\nshe was entirely occupied with Felix Holt's prophecy that she would\nmarry Harold Transome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n    Thou sayst it, and not I; for thou hast done\n    The ugly deed that made these ugly words.\n\n                                     --SOPHOCLES: _Electra_.\n\n                       Yea, it becomes a man\n    To cherish memory, where he had delight.\n    For kindness is the natural birth of kindness.\n    Whose soul records not the great debt of joy,\n    Is stamped for ever an ignoble man.\n\n                                        --SOPHOCLES: _Ajax_.\n\n\nIt so happened that, on the morning of the day when Esther went to see\nher father, Jermyn had not yet heard of her presence at Transome Court.\nOne fact conducing to keep him in this ignorance was, that some days\nafter his critical interview with Harold--days during which he had been\nwondering how long it would be before Harold made up his mind to\nsacrifice the luxury of satisfied anger for the solid advantage of\nsecuring fortune and position--he was peremptorily called away by\nbusiness to the south of England, and was obliged to inform Harold by\nletter of his absence. He took care also to notify his return; but\nHarold made no sign in reply. The days passed without bringing him any\ngossip concerning Esther's visit, for such gossip was almost confined to\nMr. Lyon's congregation, her Church pupils, Miss Louisa Jermyn among\nthem, having been satisfied by her father's written statement that she\nwas gone on a visit of uncertain duration. But on this day of Esther's\ncall in Malthouse Yard, the Miss Jermyns in their walk saw her getting\ninto the Transomes' carriage, which they had previously observed to be\nwaiting, and which they now saw bowled along on the road toward Little\nTreby. It followed that only a few hours later the news reached the\nastonished ears of Matthew Jermyn.\n\nEntirely ignorant of those converging indications and small links of\nincident which had raised Christian's conjectures, and had gradually\ncontributed to put him in possession of the facts; ignorant too of some\nbusy motives in the mind of his obliged servant Johnson; Jermyn was not\nlikely to see at once how the momentous information that Esther was the\nsurviving Bycliffe could possibly have reached Harold. His daughters\nnaturally leaped, as others had done, to the conclusion that the\nTransomes, seeking a governess for little Harry, had had their choice\ndirected to Esther, and observed that they must have attracted her by a\nhigh salary to induce her to take charge of such a small pupil; though\nof course it was important that his English and French should be\ncarefully attended to from the first. Jermyn, hearing this suggestion,\nwas not without a momentary hope that it might be true, and that Harold\nwas still safely unconscious of having under the same roof with him the\nlegal claimant of the family estate.\n\nBut a mind in the grasp of a terrible anxiety is not credulous of easy\nsolutions. The one stay that bears up our hopes is sure to appear frail,\nand if looked at long will seem to totter. Too much depended on that\nunconsciousness of Harold's; and although Jermyn did not see the course\nof things that could have disclosed and combined the various items of\nknowledge which he had imagined to be his own secret, and therefore his\nsafeguard, he saw quite clearly what was likely to be the result of the\ndisclosure. Not only would Harold Transome be no longer afraid of him,\nbut also, by marrying Esther (and Jermyn at once felt sure of this\nissue), would be triumphantly freed from any unpleasant consequences,\nand could pursue much at his ease the gratification of ruining Matthew\nJermyn. The prevision of an enemy's triumphant ease is in any case\nsufficiently irritating to hatred, and there were reasons why it was\npeculiarly exasperating here: but Jermyn had not the leisure now for\nmere fruitless emotion; he had to think of a possible device which might\nsave him from imminent ruin--not an indefinite adversity, but a ruin in\ndetail, which his thoughts painted out with the sharpest, ugliest\nintensity. A man of sixty, with an unsuspicious wife and daughters\ncapable of shrieking and fainting at a sudden revelation, and of looking\nat him reproachfully in their daily misery under a shabby lot to which\nhe had reduced them--with a mind and with habits dried hard by the\nyears--with no glimpse of an endurable standing-ground except where he\ncould domineer and be prosperous according to the ambitions of pushing\nmiddle-class gentility,--such a man is likely to find the prospect of\nworldly ruin ghastly enough to drive him to the most uninviting means of\nescape. He will probably prefer any private scorn that will save him\nfrom public infamy, or that will leave him with money in his pocket, to\nthe humiliation and hardship of new servitude in old age, a shabby hat\nand a melancholy hearth, where the firing must be used charily and the\nwomen look sad. But though a man may be willing to escape through a\nsewer, a sewer with an outlet into the dry air is not always at hand.\nRunning away, especially when spoken of as absconding, seems at a\ndistance to offer a good modern substitute for the right of sanctuary;\nbut seen closely, it is often found inconvenient and scarcely possible.\n\nJermyn, on thoroughly considering his position, saw that he had no very\nagreeable resources at command. But he soon made up his mind what he\nwould do next. He wrote to Mrs. Transome requesting her to appoint an\nhour in which he could see her privately: he knew she would understand\nthat it was to be an hour when Harold was not at home. As he sealed the\nletter, he indulged a faint hope that in this interview he might be\nassured of Esther's birth being unknown at Transome Court; but in the\nworst case, perhaps some help might be found in Mrs. Transome. To such\nuses may tender relations come when they have ceased to be tender! The\nHazaels of our world who are pushed on quickly against their\npreconceived confidence in themselves to do doglike actions by the\nsudden suggestion of a wicked ambition, are much fewer than those who\nare led on through the years by the gradual demands of a selfishness\nwhich has spread its fibres far and wide through the intricate vanities\nand sordid cares of an everyday existence.\n\nIn consequence of that letter to Mrs. Transome, Jermyn was, two days\nafterward, ushered into the smaller drawing-room at Transome Court. It\nwas a charming little room in its refurbished condition: it had two\npretty inlaid cabinets, great china vases with contents that sent forth\nodors of paradise, groups of flowers in oval frames on the walls, and\nMrs. Transome's own portrait in the evening costume of =1800=, with a\ngarden in the background. That brilliant young woman looked smilingly\ndown on Mr. Jermyn as he passed in front of the fire; and at present\nhers was the only gaze in the room. He could not help meeting the gaze\nas he waited, holding his hat behind him--could not help seeing many\nmemories lit up by it; but the strong bent of his mind was to go on\narguing each memory into a claim, and to see in the regard others had\nfor him a merit of his own. There had been plenty of roads open to him\nwhen he was a young man; perhaps if he had not allowed himself to be\ndetermined (chiefly, of course, by the feelings of others, for of what\neffect would his own feelings have been without them?) into the road he\nactually took, he might have done better for himself. At any rate, he\nwas likely at last to get the worst of it, and it was he who had most\nreason to complain. The fortunate Jason, as we know from Euripides,\npiously thanked the goddess, and saw clearly that he was not at all\nobliged to Medea; Jermyn was, perhaps, not aware of the precedent, but\nthought out his own freedom from obligation and the indebtedness of\nothers toward him with a native faculty not inferior to Jason's.\n\nBefore three minutes had passed, however, as if by some sorcery, the\nbrilliant smiling young woman above the mantelpiece seemed to be\nappearing at the doorway withered and frosted by many winters, and with\nlips and eyes from which the smile had departed. Jermyn advanced, and\nthey shook hands, but neither of them said anything by way of greeting.\nMrs. Transome seated herself, and pointed to a chair opposite and near\nher.\n\n\"Harold has gone to Loamford,\" she said, in a subdued tone. \"You had\nsomething particular to say to me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jermyn, with his soft and deferential air. \"The last time I\nwas here I could not take the opportunity of speaking to you. But I am\nanxious to know whether you are aware of what has passed between me and\nHarold?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has told me everything.\"\n\n\"About his proceedings against me? and the reason he stopped them?\"\n\n\"Yes: have you had notice that he has begun them again?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jermyn, with a very unpleasant sensation.\n\n\"Of course he will now,\" said Mrs. Transome. \"There is no reason in his\nmind why he should not.\"\n\n\"Has he resolved to risk the estate then?\"\n\n\"He feels in no danger on that score. And if there were, the danger\ndoesn't depend on you. The most likely thing is, that he will marry this\ngirl.\"\n\n\"He knows everything then?\" said Jermyn, the expression of his face\ngetting clouded.\n\n\"Everything. It's of no use for you to think of mastering him: you can't\ndo it. I used to wish Harold to be fortunate, and he is fortunate,\" said\nMrs. Transome, with intense bitterness. \"It's not my star that he\ninherits.\"\n\n\"Do you know how he came by the information about this girl?\"\n\n\"No; but she knew it all before we spoke to her. It's no secret.\"\n\nJermyn was confounded by this hopeless frustration to which he had no\nkey. Though he thought of Christian, the thought shed no light; but the\nmore fatal point was clear: he held no secret that could help him.\n\n\"You are aware that these chancery proceedings may ruin me?\"\n\n\"He told me they would. But if you are imagining I can do anything, pray\ndismiss the notion. I have told him as plainly as I dare that I wish him\nto drop all public quarrel with you, and that you could make an\narrangement without scandal. I can do no more. He will not listen to me;\nhe doesn't mind about my feelings. He cares more for Mr. Transome than\nhe does for me. He will not listen to me any more than if I were an old\nballad-singer.\"\n\n\"It's very hard on me, I know,\" said Jermyn, in the tone with which a\nman flings out a reproach.\n\n\"I besought you three months ago to bear anything rather than quarrel\nwith him.\"\n\n\"I have not quarrelled with him. It is he who has been always seeking a\nquarrel with me. I have borne a great deal--more than any one else\nwould. He set his teeth against me from the first.\"\n\n\"He saw things that annoyed him; and men are not like women,\" said Mrs.\nTransome. There was bitter innuendo in that truism.\n\n\"It's very hard on me--I know that,\" said Jermyn, with an\nintensification of his previous tone, rising and walking a step or two,\nthen turning and laying his hand on the back of the chair. \"Of course\nthe law in this case can't in the least represent the justice of the\nmatter. I made a good many sacrifices in times past. I gave up a great\ndeal of fine business for the sake of attending to the family affairs,\nand in that lawsuit they would have gone to rack and ruin if it hadn't\nbeen for me.\"\n\nHe moved away again, laid down his hat, which he had been previously\nholding, and thrust his hands into his pockets as he returned. Mrs.\nTransome sat motionless as marble, and almost as pale. Her hands lay\ncrossed on her knees. This man, young, slim, and graceful, with a\nselfishness which then took the form of homage to her, had at one time\nkneeled to her and kissed those hands fervently, and she had thought\nthere was a poetry in such passion beyond any to be found in everyday\ndomesticity.\n\n\"I stretched my conscience a good deal in that affair of Bycliffe, as\nyou know perfectly well. I told you everything at the time. I told you I\nwas very uneasy about those witnesses, and about getting him thrown into\nprison. I know it's the blackest thing anybody could charge me with, if\nthey knew my life from beginning to end; and I should never have done\nit, if I had not been under an infatuation such as makes a man do\nanything. What did it signify to me about the loss of the lawsuit? I was\na young bachelor--I had the world before me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Transome, in a low tone. \"It was a pity you didn't make\nanother choice.\"\n\n\"What would have become of you?\" said Jermyn, carried along a climax,\nlike other self-justifiers. \"I had to think of you. You would not have\nliked me to make another choice then.\"\n\n\"Clearly,\" said Mrs. Transome, with concentrated bitterness, but still\nquietly; \"the greater mistake was mine.\"\n\nEgoism is usually stupid in a dialogue; but Jermyn's did not make him so\nstupid that he did not feel the edge of Mrs. Transome's words. They\nincreased his irritation.\n\n\"I hardly see that,\" he replied, with a slight laugh of scorn. \"You had\nan estate and a position to save, to go no farther. I remember very well\nwhat you said to me--'A clever lawyer can do anything if he has the\nwill; if it's impossible, he will make it possible. And the property is\nsure to be Harold's some day.' He was a baby then.\"\n\n\"I remember most things a little too well; you had better say at once\nwhat is your object in recalling them.\"\n\n\"An object that is nothing more than justice. With the relation I stood\nin, it was not likely I should think myself bound by all the forms that\nare made to bind strangers. I had often immense trouble to raise the\nmoney necessary to pay off debts and carry on the affairs; and, as I\nsaid before, I had given up other lines of advancement which would have\nbeen open to me if I had not stayed in this neighborhood at a critical\ntime when I was fresh to the world. Anybody who knew the whole\ncircumstances would say that my being hunted and run down on the score\nof my past transactions with regard to the family affairs, is an\nabominably unjust and unnatural thing.\"\n\nJermyn paused a moment, and then added, \"At my time of life----and with\na family about me----and after what has passed----I should have thought\nthere was nothing you would care more to prevent.\"\n\n\"I do care. It makes me miserable. That is the extent of my power--to\nfeel miserable.\"\n\n\"No, it is not the extent of your power. You could save me if you would.\nIt is not to be supposed that Harold would go on against me--if he knew\nthe whole truth.\"\n\nJermyn had sat down before he uttered the last words. He had lowered his\nvoice slightly. He had the air of one who thought that he had prepared\nthe way for an understanding. That a man with so much sharpness, with so\nmuch suavity at command--a man who piqued himself on his persuasiveness\ntoward women--should behave just as Jermyn did on this occasion, would\nbe surprising but for the constant experience that temper and selfish\ninsensibility will defeat excellent gifts--will make a sensible person\nshout when shouting is out of place, and will make a polished man rude\nwhen his polish might be of eminent use to him.\n\nAs Jermyn, sitting down and leaning forward with an elbow on his knee,\nuttered his last words--\"if he knew the whole truth\"--a slight shock\nseemed to pass through Mrs. Transome's hitherto motionless body,\nfollowed by a sudden light in her eyes, as in an animal's about to\nspring.\n\n\"And you expect me to tell him?\" she said, not loudly, but yet with a\nclear metallic ring in her voice.\n\n\"Would it not be right for him to know?\" said Jermyn, in a more bland\nand persuasive tone than he had yet used.\n\nPerhaps some of the most terrible irony of the human lot is this of a\ndeep truth coming to be uttered by lips that have no right to it.\n\n\"I will never tell him!\" said Mrs. Transome, starting up, her whole\nframe thrilled with a passion that seemed almost to make her young\nagain. Her hands hung beside her clenched tightly, her eyes and lips\nlost the helpless repressed bitterness of discontent, and seemed\nsuddenly fed with energy. \"You reckon up your sacrifices for me: you\nhave kept a good account of them, and it is needful: they are some of\nthem what no one else could guess or find out. But you made your\nsacrifices when they seemed pleasant to you; when you told me they were\nyour happiness; when you told me that it was I who stooped, and I who\nbestowed favors.\"\n\nJermyn rose too, and laid his hand on the back of the chair. He had\ngrown visibly paler, but seemed about to speak.\n\n\"Don't speak!\" Mrs. Transome said peremptorily. \"Don't open your lips\nagain. You have said enough; I will speak now. I have made sacrifices\ntoo, but it was when I knew that they were not my happiness. It was\nafter I saw that I had stooped--after I saw that your tenderness had\nturned into calculation--after I saw that you cared for yourself only,\nand not for me. I heard your explanations--of your duty in life--of our\nmutual reputation--of a virtuous young lady attached to you. I bore it;\nI let everything go; I shut my eyes: I might almost have let myself\nstarve, rather than have scenes of quarrel with the man I had loved, in\nwhich I must accuse him of turning my love into a good bargain.\" There\nwas a slight tremor in Mrs. Transome's voice in the last words, and for\na moment she paused: but when she spoke again it seemed as if the tremor\nhad frozen into a cutting icicle. \"I suppose if a lover picked one's\npocket, there's no woman would like to own it. I don't say I was not\nafraid of you: I was afraid of you, and I know now I was right.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Transome,\" said Jermyn, white to the lips, \"it is needless to say\nmore. I withdraw any words that have offended you.\"\n\n\"You can't withdraw them. Can a man apologize for being a dastard?--And\nI have caused you to strain your conscience, have I?--it is I who have\nsullied your purity? I should think the demons have more honor--they are\nnot so impudent to one another. I would not lose the misery of being a\nwoman, now I see what can be the baseness of a man. One must be a\nman--first to tell a woman that her love has made her your debtor, and\nthen ask her to pay you by breaking the last poor threads between her\nand her son.\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" said Jermyn, with a certain asperity. He was\nbeginning to find this intolerable. The mere brute strength of a\nmasculine creature rebelled. He felt almost inclined to throttle the\nvoice out of this woman.\n\n\"You do ask it: it is what you would like. I have had a terror on me\nlest evil should happen to you. From the first, after Harold came home,\nI had a terrible dread. It seemed as if murder might come between you--I\ndidn't know what. I felt the horror of his not knowing the truth. I\nmight have been dragged at last, by my own feeling--by my own memory--to\ntell him all, and make him as well as myself miserable, to save you.\"\n\nAgain there was a slight tremor, as if at the remembrance of womanly\ntenderness and pity. But immediately she launched forth again.\n\n\"But now you have asked me, I will never tell him! Be ruined--no--do\nsomething more dastardly to save yourself. If I sinned, my judgment went\nbeforehand--that I should sin for a man like you.\"\n\nSwiftly upon those last words Mrs. Transome passed out of the room. The\nsoftly padded door closed behind her making no noise, and Jermyn found\nhimself alone.\n\nFor a brief space he stood still. Human beings in moments of passionate\nreproach and denunciation, especially when their anger is on their own\naccount, are never so wholly in the right that the person who has to\nwince cannot possibly protest against some unreasonableness or\nunfairness in their outburst. And if Jermyn had been capable of feeling\nthat he had thoroughly merited this infliction, he would not have\nuttered the words that drew it down on him. Men do not become penitent\nand learn to abhor themselves by having their backs cut open with the\nlash; rather, they learn to abhor the lash. What Jermyn felt about Mrs.\nTransome when she disappeared was, that she was a furious woman--who\nwould not do what he wanted her to do. And he was supported as to his\njustifiableness by the inward repetition of what he had already said to\nher; it was right that Harold should know the truth. He did not take\ninto account (how should he?) the exasperation and loathing excited by\nhis daring to urge the plea of right. A man who had stolen the pyx, and\ngot frightened when justice was at his heels, might feel the sort of\npenitence which would induce him to run back in the dark and lay the pyx\nwhere the sexton might find it; but if in doing so he whispered to the\nBlessed Virgin that he was moved by considering the sacredness of all\nproperty, and the peculiar sacredness of the pyx, it is not to be\nbelieved that she would like him the better for it. Indeed, one often\nseems to see why the saints should prefer candles to words, especially\nfrom penitents whose skin is in danger. Some salt of generosity would\nhave made Jermyn conscious that he had lost the citizenship which\nauthorized him to plead the right; still more, that his self-vindication\nto Mrs. Transome would be like the exhibition of a brand-mark, and only\nshow that he was shame-proof. There is heroism even in the circles of\nhell for fellow-sinners who cling to each other in the fiery whirlwind\nand never recriminate. But these things, which are easy to discern when\nthey are painted for us on the large canvas of poetic story, become\nconfused and obscure even for well-read gentlemen when their affection\nfor themselves is alarmed by pressing details of actual experience. If\ntheir comparison of instances is active at such times, it is chiefly in\nshowing them that their own case has subtle distinctions from all other\ncases, which should free them from unmitigated condemnation.\n\nAnd it was in this way with Matthew Jermyn. So many things were more\ndistinctly visible to him, and touched him more acutely, than the effect\nof his acts or words on Mrs. Transome's feelings! In fact--he asked,\nwith a touch of something that makes us all akin--was it not\npreposterous, this excess of feeling on points which he himself did not\nfind powerfully moving? She had treated him most unreasonably. It would\nhave been right for her to do what he had--not asked, but only hinted at\nin a mild and interrogatory manner. But the clearest and most unpleasant\nresult of the interview was, that this right thing which he desired so\nmuch would certainly not be done for him by Mrs. Transome.\n\nAs he was moving his arm from the chair-back, and turning to take his\nhat, there was a boisterous noise in the entrance-hall; the door of the\ndrawing-room, which had closed without latching, was pushed open, and\nold Mr. Transome appeared with a face of feeble delight, playing horse\nto little Harry, who roared and flogged behind him, while Moro yapped in\na puppy voice at their heels. But when Mr. Transome saw Jermyn in the\nroom he stood still in the doorway, as if he did not know whether\nentrance was permissible. The majority of his thoughts were but ravelled\nthreads of the past. The attorney came forward to shake hands with due\npoliteness, but the old man said, with a bewildered look, and in a\nhesitating way--\n\n\"Mr. Jermyn?--why--why--where is Mrs. Transome?\"\n\nJermyn smiled his way out past the unexpected group; and little Harry,\nthinking he had an eligible opportunity, turned round to give a parting\nstroke on the stranger's coat-tails.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n    Whichever way my days decline,\n      I felt and feel, though left alone,\n      His being working in mine own,\n    The footsteps of his life in mine.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Dear friend, far off, my lost desire\n      So far, so near, in woe and weal;\n      Oh, loved the most when most I feel\n    There is a lower and a higher!\n\n                                  --TENNYSON: _In Memoriam_.\n\n\nAfter that morning on which Esther found herself reddened and confused\nby the sense of having made a distant allusion to Felix Holt, she felt\nit impossible that she should even, as she had sometimes intended, speak\nof him explicitly to Harold, in order to discuss probabilities as to the\nissue of his trial. She was certain she could not do it without\nbetraying emotion, and there were very complex reasons in Esther's mind\nwhy she could not bear that Harold should detect her sensibility on this\nsubject. It was not only all the fibres of maidenly pride and reserve,\nof a bashfulness undefinably peculiar toward this man, who, while much\nolder than herself, and bearing the stamp of an experience quite hidden\nfrom her imagination, was taking strongly the aspect of a lover--it was\nnot only this exquisite kind of shame which was at work within her:\nthere was another sort of susceptibility in Esther, which her present\ncircumstances tended to encourage, though she had come to regard it as\nnot at all lofty, but rather as something which condemned her to\nlittleness in comparison with a mind she had learned to venerate. She\nknew quite well that, to Harold Transome, Felix Holt was one of the\ncommon people who could come into question in no other than a public\nlight. She had a native capability for discerning that the sense of\nranks and degrees has its repulsions corresponding to the repulsions\ndependent on difference of race and color; and she remembered her own\nimpressions too well not to foresee that it would come on Harold\nTransome as a shock, if he suspected there had been any love-passages\nbetween her and this young man, who to him was of course no more than\nany other intelligent member of the working class. \"To him,\" said Esther\nto herself, with a reaction of her newer, better pride, \"who has not had\nthe sort of intercourse in which Felix Holt's cultured nature would have\nasserted its superiority.\" And in her fluctuations on this matter, she\nfound herself mentally protesting that, whatever Harold might think,\nthere was a light in which he was vulgar compared with Felix. Felix had\nideas and motives which she did not believe Harold could understand.\nMore than all, there was this test: she herself had no sense of\ninferiority and just subjection when she was with Harold Transome; there\nwere even points in him for which she felt a touch, not of anger, but of\nplayful scorn; whereas with Felix she had always a sense of dependence\nand possible illumination. In those large, grave, candid gray eyes of\nhis, love seemed something that belonged to the high enthusiasm of life,\nsuch as now might be forever shut out from her.\n\nAll the same, her vanity winced at the idea that Harold should discern\nwhat, from his point of view, would seem like a degradation of her taste\nand refinement. She could not help being gratified by all the\nmanifestations from those around her that she was thought thoroughly\nfitted for a high position--could not help enjoying, with more or less\nkeenness, a rehearsal of that demeanor amongst luxuries and dignities\nwhich had often been a part of her day-dreams, and the rehearsal\nincluded the reception of more and more emphatic attentions from Harold,\nand of an effusiveness in his manners, which, in proportion as it would\nhave been offensive if it had appeared earlier, became flattering as the\neffect of a growing acquaintance and daily contact. It comes in so many\nforms in this life of ours--the knowledge that there is something\nsweetest and noblest of which we despair, and the sense of something\npresent that solicits us with an immediate and easy indulgence. And\nthere is a pernicious falsity in the pretence that a woman's love lies\nabove the range of such temptations.\n\nDay after day Esther had an arm offered her, had very beaming looks upon\nher, had opportunities for a great deal of light, airy talk, in which\nshe knew herself to be charming, and had the attractive interest of\nnoticing Harold's practical cleverness--the masculine ease with which he\ngoverned everybody and administered everything about him, without the\nleast harshness, and with a facile good-nature which yet was not weak.\nIn the background, too, there was the ever-present consideration, that\nif Harold Transome wished to marry her, and she accepted him, the\nproblem of her lot would be more easily solved than in any other way. It\nwas difficult, by any theory of Providence, or consideration of results,\nto see a course which she could call duty: if something would come and\nurge itself strongly as pleasure, and save her from the effort to find a\nclue of principle amid the labyrinthine confusions of right and\npossession, the promise could not but seem alluring. And yet, this life\nat Transome Court was _not_ the life of her day-dreams: there was\ndullness already in its ease, and in the absence of high demand; and\nthere was a vague consciousness that the love of this not unfascinating\nman who hovered about her gave an air of moral mediocrity to all her\nprospects. She would not have been able perhaps to define this\nimpression; but somehow or other by this elevation of fortune it seemed\nthat the higher ambition which had begun to spring in her was forever\nnullified. All life seemed cheapened; as it might seem to a young\nstudent who, having believed that to gain a certain degree he must write\na thesis in which he would bring his powers to bear with memorable\neffect, suddenly ascertained that no thesis was expected, but the sum\n(in English money) of twenty-seven pounds ten shillings and sixpence.\n\nAfter all, she was a woman, and could not make her own lot. As she had\nonce said to Felix, \"A woman must choose meaner things, because only\nmeaner things are offered to her.\" Her lot is made for her by the love\nshe accepts. And Esther began to think that her lot was being made for\nher by the love that was surrounding her with the influence of a garden\non a summer morning.\n\nHarold, on his side, was conscious that the interest of his wooing was\nnot standing still. He was beginning to think it a conquest, in which it\nwould be disappointing to fail, even if this fair nymph had no claim to\nthe estate. He would have liked--and yet he would not have liked--that\njust a slight shadow of doubt as to his success should be removed. There\nwas something about Esther that he did not altogether understand. She\nwas clearly a woman that could be governed: she was too charming for him\nto fear that she would ever be obstinate or interfering. Yet there was a\nlightning that shot out of her now and then, which seemed the sign of a\ndangerous judgment; as if she inwardly saw something more admirable than\nHarold Transome. Now, to be perfectly charming, a woman should not see\nthis.\n\nOne fine February day, when already the golden and purple crocuses were\nout on the terrace--one of those flattering days which sometimes precede\nthe north-east winds of March, and make believe that the coming spring\nwill be enjoyable--a very striking group, of whom Esther and Harold made\na part, came out at midday to walk upon the gravel at Transome Court.\nThey did not, as usual, go toward the pleasure grounds on the eastern\nside, because Mr. Lingon, who was one of them, was going home, and his\nroad lay through the stone gateway into the park.\n\nUncle Lingon, who disliked painful confidences, and preferred knowing\n\"no mischief of anybody,\" had not objected to be let into the important\nsecret about Esther, and was sure at once that the whole affair, instead\nof being a misfortune, was a piece of excellent luck. For himself, he\ndid not profess to be a judge of women, but she seemed to have all the\n\"points,\" and to carry herself as well as Arabella did, which was saying\na good deal. Honest Jack Lingon's first impressions quickly became\ntraditions, which no subsequent evidence could disturb. He was fond of\nhis sister, and seemed never to be conscious of any change for the worse\nin her since their early time. He considered that man a beast who said\nanything unpleasant about the persons to whom he was attached. It was\nnot that he winked; his wide-open eyes saw nothing but what his easy\ndisposition inclined him to see. Harold was a good fellow, a clever\nchap; and Esther's peculiar fitness for him, under all the\ncircumstances, was extraordinary; it reminded him of something in the\nclassics, though he couldn't think exactly what--in fact, a memory was a\nnasty uneasy thing. Esther was always glad when the old rector came.\nWith an odd contrariety to her former niceties she liked his rough\nattire and careless frank speech; they were something not point device\nthat seemed to connect the life of Transome Court with that rougher,\ncommoner world where her home had been.\n\nShe and Harold were walking a little in advance of the rest of the\nparty, who were retarded by various causes. Old Mr. Transome, wrapped in\na cloth cloak trimmed with sable, and with a soft warm cap also trimmed\nwith fur on his head, had a shuffling uncertain walk. Little Harry was\ndragging a toy vehicle, on the seat of which he had insisted on tying\nMoro with a piece of scarlet drapery round him, making him look like a\nbarbaric prince in a chariot. Moro, having little imagination, objected\nto this, and barked with feeble snappishness as the tyrannous lad ran\nforward, then whirled the chariot round, and ran back to \"Gappa,\" then\ncame to a dead stop, which overset the chariot, that he might watch\nUncle Lingon's water-spaniel run for the hurled stick and bring it in\nhis mouth. Nimrod kept close to his old master's legs, glancing with\nmuch indifference at this youthful ardor about sticks--he had \"gone\nthrough all that\"; and Dominic walked by, looking on blandly, and\ntaking care both of young and old. Mrs. Transome was not there.\n\n[Illustration: ESTHER LYON AND HAROLD TRANSOME.]\n\nLooking back and seeing that they were a good deal in advance of the\nrest, Esther and Harold paused.\n\n\"What do you think about thinning the trees over there?\" said Harold,\npointing with his stick. \"I have a bit of a notion that if they were\ndivided into clumps so as to show the oaks beyond it would be a great\nimprovement. It would give an idea of extent that is lost now. And there\nmight be some very pretty clumps got out of those mixed trees. What do\nyou think?\"\n\n\"I should think it would be an improvement. One likes a 'beyond'\neverywhere. But I never heard you express yourself so dubiously,\" said\nEsther, looking at him rather archly: \"you generally see things so\nclearly, and are so convinced, that I shall begin to feel quite\ntottering if I find you in uncertainty. Pray don't begin to be doubtful;\nit is infectious.\"\n\n\"You think me a great deal too sure--too confident?\" said Harold.\n\n\"Not at all. It is an immense advantage to know your own will, when you\nalways mean to have it.\"\n\n\"But suppose I couldn't get it, in spite of meaning?\" said Harold, with\na beaming inquiry in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, then,\" said Esther, turning her head aside, carelessly, as if she\nwere considering the distant birch-stems, \"you would bear it quite\neasily, as you did your not getting into Parliament. You would know you\ncould get it another time--or get something else as good.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Harold, moving on a little, as if he did not want to\nbe quite overtaken by the others, \"you consider me a fat, fatuous,\nself-satisfied fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh, there are degrees,\" said Esther, with a silvery laugh; \"you have\njust as much of those qualities as is becoming. There are different\nstyles. You are perfect in your own.\"\n\n\"But you prefer another style, I suspect. A more submissive, tearful,\ndevout worshipper, who would offer his incense with more trembling.\"\n\n\"You are quite mistaken,\" said Esther, still lightly. \"I find I am very\nwayward. When anything is offered to me, it seems that I prize it less,\nand don't want to have it.\"\n\nHere was a very baulking answer, but in spite of it Harold could not\nhelp believing that Esther was very far from objecting to the sort of\nincense he had been offering just then.\n\n\"I have often read that that is in human nature,\" she went on, \"yet it\ntakes me by surprise in myself. I suppose,\" she added, smiling, \"I\ndidn't think of myself as human nature.\"\n\n\"I don't confess to the same waywardness,\" said Harold. \"I am very fond\nof things that I can get. And I never longed much for anything out of my\nreach. Whatever I feel sure of getting I like all the better. I think\nhalf those priggish maxims about human nature in the lump are no more to\nbe relied on than universal remedies. There are different sorts of human\nnature. Some are given to discontent and longing, others to securing and\nenjoying. And let me tell you, the discontented longing style is\nunpleasant to live with.\"\n\nHarold nodded with a meaning smile at Esther.\n\n\"Oh, I assure you I have abjured all admiration for it,\" she said,\nsmiling up at him in return.\n\nShe was remembering the schooling Felix had given her about her Byronic\nheroes, and was inwardly adding a third sort of human nature to those\nvarieties which Harold had mentioned. He naturally supposed that he\nmight take the abjuration to be entirely in his own favor. And his face\ndid look very pleasant; she could not help liking him, although he was\ncertainly too particular about sauces, gravies, and wines, and had a way\nof virtually measuring the value of everything by the contribution it\nmade to his own pleasure. His very good-nature was unsympathetic; it\nnever came from any thorough understanding or deep respect for what was\nin the mind of the person he obliged or indulged; it was like his\nkindness to his mother--an arrangement of his for the happiness of\nothers, which, if they were sensible, ought to succeed. And an\ninevitable comparison which haunted her, showed her the same quality in\nhis political views: the utmost enjoyment of his own advantages was the\nsolvent that blended pride in his family and position, with the adhesion\nto changes that were to obliterate tradition and melt down enchased gold\nheirlooms into plating for the egg-spoons of \"the people.\" It is\nterrible--the keen bright eye of a woman when it has once been turned\nwith admiration on what is severely true; but then, the severely true\nrarely comes within its range of vision. Esther had had an unusual\nillumination; Harold did not know how, but he discerned enough of the\neffect to make him more cautious than he had ever been in his life\nbefore. That caution would have prevented him just then from following\nup the question as to the style of person Esther would think pleasant to\nlive with, even if Uncle Lingon had not joined them, as he did, to talk\nabout soughing tiles, saying presently that he should turn across the\ngrass and get on to the Home Farm, to have a look at the improvements\nthat Harold was making with such racing speed.\n\n\"But you know, lad,\" said the rector, as they paused at the expected\nparting, \"you can't do everything in a hurry. The wheat must have time\nto grow, even when you've reformed all us old Tories off the face of the\nground. Dash it! now the election's over, I'm an old Tory again. You\nsee, Harold, a Radical won't do for the county. At another election, you\nmust be on the look-out for a borough where they want a bit of blood. I\nshould have liked you uncommonly to stand for the county; and a Radical\nof good family squares well enough with a new-fashioned Tory like young\nDebarry; but you see, these riots--it's been a nasty business. I shall\nhave my hair combed at the sessions for a year to come. But, heyday!\nWhat dame is this, with a small boy?--not one of my parishioners?\"\n\nHarold and Esther turned, and saw an elderly woman advancing with a tiny\nred-haired boy, scantily attired as to his jacket, which merged into a\nsmall sparrow-tail a little higher than his waist, but muffled as to his\nthroat with a blue woollen comforter. Esther recognized the pair too\nwell, and felt very uncomfortable. We are so pitiably in subjection to\nall sorts of vanity--even the very vanities we are practically\nrenouncing! And in spite of the almost solemn memories connected with\nMrs. Holt, Esther's first shudder was raised by the idea of what things\nthis woman would say, and by the mortification of having Felix in any\nway represented by his mother.\n\nAs Mrs. Holt advanced into closer observation, it became more evident\nthat she was attired with a view not to charm the eye, but rather to\nafflict it with all that expression of woe which belongs to very rusty\nbombazine and the limpest state of false hair. Still, she was not a\nwoman to lose the sense of her own value, or become abject in her\nmanners under any circumstances of depression; and she had a peculiar\nsense on the present occasion that she was justly relying on the force\nof her own character and judgment, in independence of anything that Mr.\nLyon or the masterful Felix would have said, if she had thought them\nworthy to know of her undertaking. She courtesied once, as if to the\nentire group, now including even the dogs, who showed various degrees of\ncuriosity, especially as to what kind of game the smaller animal Job\nmight prove to be after due investigation; and then she proceeded at\nonce toward Esther, who, in spite of her annoyance, took her arm from\nHarold's, said, \"How do you do, Mrs. Holt?\" very kindly, and stooped to\npat little Job.\n\n\"Yes--you know him, Miss Lyon,\" said Mrs. Holt, in that tone which\nimplies that the conversation is intended for the edification of the\ncompany generally; \"you know the orphin child, as Felix brought home for\nme that am his mother to take care of. And it's what I've done--nobody\nmore so--though it's trouble is my reward.\"\n\nEsther had raised herself again, to stand in helpless endurance of\nwhatever might be coming. But by this time young Harry, struck even more\nthan the dogs by the appearance of Job Tudge, had come round dragging\nhis chariot, and placed himself close to the pale child, whom he\nexceeded in height and breadth, as well as in depth of coloring. He\nlooked into Job's eyes, peeped round at the tail of his jacket and\npulled it a little, and then, taking off the tiny cloth-cap, observed\nwith much interest the tight red curls which had been hidden underneath\nit. Job looked at his inspector with the round blue eyes of\nastonishment, until Harry, purely by way of experiment, took a bon-bon\nfrom a fantastic wallet which hung over his shoulder, and applied the\ntest to Job's lips. The result was satisfactory to both. Every one had\nbeen watching this small comedy, and when Job crunched the bon-bon while\nHarry looked down at him inquiringly and patted his back, there was\ngeneral laughter except on the part of Mrs. Holt, who was shaking her\nhead slowly, and slapping the back of her left hand with the painful\npatience of a tragedian whose part is in abeyance to an ill-timed\nintroduction of the humorous.\n\n\"I hope Job's cough has been better lately,\" said Esther, in mere\nuncertainty as to what it would be desirable to say or do.\n\n\"I dare say you hope so, Miss Lyon,\" said Mrs. Holt, looking at the\ndistant landscape. \"I've no reason to disbelieve but what you wish well\nto the child, and to Felix, and to me. I'm sure nobody has any occasion\nto wish me otherways. My character will bear enquiry, and what you, as\nare young, don't know, others can tell you. That was what I said to\nmyself when I made up my mind to come here and see you, and ask you to\nget me the freedom to speak to Mr. Transome. I said, whatever Miss Lyon\nmay be now, in the way of being lifted up among great people, she's our\nminister's daughter, and was not above coming to my house and walking\nwith my son Felix--though I'll not deny he made that figure on the\nLord's Day, that'll perhaps go against him with the judge, if anybody\nthinks well to tell him.\"\n\nHere Mrs. Holt paused a moment, as with a mind arrested by the painful\nimage it had called up.\n\nEsther's face was glowing, when Harold glanced at her; and seeing this,\nhe was considerate enough to address Mrs. Holt instead of her.\n\n\"You are then the mother of the unfortunate young man who is in prison?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, sir,\" said Mrs. Holt, feeling that she was now in deep\nwater. \"It's not likely I should claim him if he wasn't my own; though\nit's not by my will, nor my advice, sir, that he ever walked; for I gave\nhim none but good. But if everybody's son was guided by their mothers,\nthe world 'ud be different; my son is not worse than many another\nwoman's son, and that in Treby, whatever they may say as haven't got\ntheir sons in prison. And as to his giving up the doctoring, and then\nstopping his father's medicines, I know it's bad--that I know--but it's\nme has had to suffer, and it's me a king and Parliament 'ud consider, if\nthey meant to do the right thing, and had anybody to make it known to\n'em. And as for the rioting and killing the constable--my son said most\nplain to me he never meant it, and there was his bit of potato-pie for\ndinner getting dry by the fire, the whole blessed time as I sat and\nnever knew what was coming on me. And it's my opinion as if great people\nmake elections to get themselves into Parliament, and there's riot and\nmurder to do it, they ought to see as the widow and the widow's son\ndoesn't suffer for it. I well know my duty: and I read my Bible; and I\nknow in Jude where it's been stained with the dried tulip-leaves this\nmany a year, as you're told not to rail at your betters if they was the\ndevil himself; nor will I; but this I do say, if it's three Mr.\nTransomes instead of one as is listening to me, as there's them ought to\ngo to the king and get him to let off my son Felix.\"\n\nThis speech, in its chief points, had been deliberately prepared. Mrs.\nHolt had set her face like a flint, to make the gentry know their duty\nas she knew hers: her defiant defensive tone was due to the\nconsciousness, not only that she was braving a powerful audience, but\nthat she was daring to stand on the strong basis of her own judgment in\nopposition to her son's. Her proposals had been waived off by Mr Lyon\nand Felix; but she had long had the feminine conviction that if she\ncould \"get to speak\" in the right quarter, things might be different.\nThe daring bit of impromptu about the three Mr. Transomes was\nimmediately suggested by a movement of old Mr. Transome to the\nforeground in a line with Mr. Lingon and Harold; his furred and unusual\ncostume appearing to indicate a mysterious dignity which she must hasten\nto include in her appeal.\n\nAnd there were reasons that none could have foreseen, which made Mrs.\nHolt's remonstrance immediately effective. While old Mr. Transome\nstared, very much like a waxen image in which the expression is a\nfailure, and the rector, accustomed to female parishioners and\ncomplainants, looked on with a smile in his eyes, Harold said at once,\nwith cordial kindness--\n\n\"I think you are quite right, Mrs. Holt. And for my part, I am\ndetermined to do my best for your son, both in the witness-box and\nelsewhere. Take comfort; if it is necessary, the king shall be appealed\nto. And rely upon it, I shall bear you in mind as Felix Holt's mother.\"\n\nRapid thoughts had convinced Harold that in this way he was best\ncommending himself to Esther.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Holt, who was not going to pour forth\ndisproportionate thanks, \"I am glad to hear you speak so becoming; and\nif you had been the king himself, I should have made free to tell you my\nopinion. For the Bible says the king's favor is toward a wise servant;\nand it's reasonable to think he'd make all the more account of them as\nhave never been in service, or took wage, which I never did, and never\nthought of my son doing; and his father left money, meaning otherways,\nso as he might have been a doctor on horseback at this very minute,\ninstead of being in prison.\"\n\n\"What! was he regularly apprenticed to a doctor?\" said Mr. Lingon, who\nhad not understood this before.\n\n\"Sir, he was, and most clever, like his father before him, only he\nturned contrary. But as for harming anybody, Felix never meant to harm\nanybody but himself and his mother, which he certainly did in respect of\nhis clothes, and taking to be a low workingman, and stopping my living\nrespectable, more particular by the pills, which had a sale, as you may\nbe sure they suited people's insides. And what folks can never have\nboxes enough of to swallow, I should think you have a right to sell. And\nthere's many and many a text for it, as I've opened on without ever\nthinking; for if it's true, 'Ask, and you shall have,' I should think\nit's truer when you're willing to pay for what you have.\"\n\nThis was a little too much for Mr. Lingon's gravity; he exploded, and\nHarold could not help following him. Mrs. Holt fixed her eyes on the\ndistance, and slapped the back of her left hand again; it might be that\nthis kind of mirth was the peculiar effect produced by forcible truth on\nhigh and worldly people who were neither in the Independent nor the\nGeneral Baptist connection.\n\n\"I'm sure you must be tired with your long walk, and little Job too,\"\nsaid Esther, by way of breaking this awkward scene. \"Aren't you, Job?\"\nshe added, stooping to caress the child, who was timidly shrinking from\nHarry's invitation to him to pull the little chariot--Harry's view being\nthat Job would make a good horse for him to beat, and would run faster\nthan Gappa.\n\n\"It's well you can feel for the orphin child, Miss Lyon,\" said Mrs.\nHolt, choosing an indirect answer rather than to humble herself by\nconfessing fatigue before gentlemen who seemed to be taking her too\nlightly. \"I didn't believe but what you'd behave pretty, as you always\ndid to me, though everybody said you held yourself high. But I'm sure\nyou never did to Felix, for you let him sit by you at the Free School\nbefore all the town, and him with never a bit of stock round his neck.\nAnd it shows you saw _that_ in him worth taking notice of;--and it is\nbut right, if you know my words are true, as you should speak for him to\nthe gentlemen.\"\n\n\"I assure you, Mrs. Holt,\" said Harold, coming to the rescue--\"I assure\nyou that enough has been said to make me use my best efforts for your\nson. And now, pray, go on to the house with the little boy and take some\nrest. Dominic, show Mrs. Holt the way, and ask Mrs. Hickes to make her\ncomfortable, and see that somebody takes her back to Treby in the\nbuggy.\"\n\n\"I will go back with Mrs. Holt,\" said Esther, making an effort against\nherself.\n\n\"No, pray,\" said Harold, with that kind of entreaty which is really a\ndecision. \"Let Mrs. Holt have time to rest. We shall have returned, and\nyou can see her before she goes. We will say good-by for the present,\nMrs. Holt.\"\n\nThe poor woman was not sorry to have the prospect of rest and food,\nespecially for \"the orphin child,\" of whom she was tenderly careful.\nLike many women who appear to others to have a masculine decisiveness of\ntone, and to themselves to have a masculine force of mind, and who come\ninto severe collision with sons arrived at the masterful stage, she had\nthe maternal cord vibrating strongly within her toward all tiny\nchildren. And when she saw Dominic pick up Job and hoist him on his arm\nfor a little while, by way of making acquaintance, she regarded him with\nan approval which she had not thought it possible to extend to a\nforeigner. Since Dominic was going, Harry and old Mr. Transome chose to\nfollow. Uncle Lingon shook hands and turned off across the grass, and\nthus Esther was left alone with Harold.\n\nBut there was a new consciousness between them. Harold's quick\nperception was least likely to be slow in seizing indications of\nanything that might affect his position with regard to Esther. Some time\nbefore, his jealousy had been awakened to the possibility that before\nshe had known him she had been deeply interested in some one else.\nJealousy of all sorts--whether for our fortune or our love--is ready at\ncombinations, and likely even to outstrip the fact. And Esther's renewed\nconfusion, united with her silence about Felix, which now first seemed\nnoteworthy, and with Mrs. Holt's graphic details as to her walking with\nhim and letting him sit by her before all the town were grounds not\nmerely for a suspicion, but for a conclusion in Harold's mind. The\neffect of this which he at once regarded as a discovery, was rather\ndifferent from what Esther had anticipated. It seemed to him that Felix\nwas the least formidable person that he could have found as an object of\ninterest antecedent to himself. A young workman who had got himself\nthrown into prison, whatever recommendations he might have had for a\ngirl at a romantic age in the dreariness of Dissenting society at Treby,\ncould hardly be considered by Harold in the light of a rival. Esther was\ntoo clever and tasteful a woman to make a ballad heroine of herself, by\nbestowing her beauty and her lands on this lowly lover. Besides, Harold\ncherished the belief that, at the present time, Esther was more wisely\ndisposed to bestow these things on another lover in every way eligible.\nBut in two directions this discovery had a determining effect on him,\nhis curiosity was stirred to know exactly what the relation with Felix\nhad been, and he was solicitous that his behavior with regard to this\nyoung man should be such as to enhance his own merit in Esther's eyes.\nAt the same time he was not inclined to any euphemisms that would seem\nto bring Felix into the lists with himself.\n\nNaturally when they were left alone, it was Harold who spoke first. \"I\nshould think there's a good deal of worth in this young fellow--this\nHolt, notwithstanding the mistakes he has made. A little queer and\nconceited, perhaps; but that is usually the case with men of his class\nwhen they are at all superior to their fellows.\"\n\n\"Felix Holt is a highly cultivated man; he is not at all conceited,\"\nsaid Esther. The different kinds of pride within her were coalescing\nnow. She was aware that there had been a betrayal.\n\n\"Ah?\" said Harold, not quite liking the tone of this answer. \"This\neccentricity is a sort of fanaticism, then?--this giving up being a\ndoctor on horseback, as the old woman calls it, and taking to--let me\nsee--watchmaking, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If it is eccentricity to be very much better than other men, he is\ncertainly eccentric; and fanatical too, if it is fanatical to renounce\nall small selfish motives for the sake of a great and unselfish one. I\nnever knew what nobleness of character really was before I knew Felix\nHolt.\"\n\nIt seemed to Esther as if in the excitement of this moment, her own\nwords were bringing her a clearer revelation.\n\n\"God bless me!\" said Harold, in a tone of surprised yet thorough belief,\nand looking in Esther's face. \"I wish you had talked to me about this\nbefore.\"\n\nEsther at that moment looked perfectly beautiful, with an expression\nwhich Harold had never hitherto seen. All the confusion which had\ndepended on personal feeling had given way before the sense that she had\nto speak the truth about the man whom she felt to be admirable.\n\n\"I think I didn't see the meaning of anything fine--I didn't even see\nthe value of my father's character, until I had been taught a little by\nhearing what Felix Holt said, and seeing that his life was like his\nwords.\"\n\nHarold looked and listened, and felt his slight jealousy allayed rather\nthan heightened. \"This is not like love,\" he said to himself, with some\nsatisfaction. With all due regard to Harold Transome, he was one of\nthose men who are liable to make the greater mistakes about a particular\nwoman's feelings, because they pique themselves on a power of\ninterpretation derived from much experience. Experience is enlightening,\nbut with a difference. Experiments on live animals may go on for a long\nperiod, and yet the fauna on which they are made may be limited. There\nmay be a passion in the mind of a woman which precipitates her, not\nalong the path of easy beguilement, but into a great leap away from it.\nHarold's experience had not taught him this; and Esther's enthusiasm\nabout Felix Holt did not seem to him to be dangerous.\n\n\"He's quite an apostolic sort of fellow, then,\" was the self-quieting\nanswer he gave to her last words. \"He didn't look like that; but I had\nonly a short interview with him, and I was given to understand that he\nrefused to see me in prison. I believe he's not very well inclined\ntoward me. But you saw a great deal of him, I suppose, and your\ntestimony to any one is enough for me,\" said Harold, lowering his voice\nrather tenderly. \"Now I know what your opinion is, I shall spare no\neffort on behalf of such a young man. In fact, I had come to the same\nresolution before, but your wish would make difficult things easy.\"\n\nAfter that energetic speech of Esther's, as often happens, the tears had\njust suffused her eyes. It was nothing more than might have been\nexpected in a tender-hearted woman, considering Felix Holt's\ncircumstances, and the tears only made more lovely the look with which\nshe met Harold's when he spoke so kindly. She felt pleased with him; she\nwas open to the fallacious delight of being assured that she had power\nover him to make him do what she liked, and quite forgot the many\nimpressions which had convinced her that Harold had a padded yoke ready\nfor the neck of every man, woman, and child that depended on him.\n\nAfter a short silence, they were getting near the stone gateway, and\nHarold said, with an air of intimate consultation--\n\n\"What could we do for this young man, supposing he were let off? I shall\nsend a letter with fifty pounds to the old woman to-morrow. I ought to\nhave done it before, but it really slipped my memory, amongst the many\nthings that have occupied me lately. But this young man--what do you\nthink would be the best thing we could do for him, if he gets at large\nagain. He should be put in a position where his qualities could be more\ntelling.\"\n\nEsther was recovering her liveliness a little, and was disposed to\nencourage it for the sake of veiling other feelings, about which she\nfelt renewed reticence, now that the overpowering influence of her\nenthusiasm was past. She was rather wickedly amused and scornful at\nHarold's misconceptions and ill-placed intentions of patronage.\n\n\"You are hopelessly in the dark,\" she said, with a light laugh and toss\nof her head. \"What would you offer Felix Holt? a place in the Excise?\nYou might as well think of offering it to John the Baptist. Felix has\nchosen his lot. He means always to be a poor man.\"\n\n\"Means? Yes,\" said Harold, slightly piqued, \"but what a man means\nusually depends on what happens. I mean to be a commoner; but a peerage\nmight present itself under acceptable circumstances.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is no sum in proportion to be done there,\" said Esther, again\ngaily. \"As you are to a peerage so is not Felix Holt to any offer of\nadvantage that you could imagine for him.\"\n\n\"You must think him fit for any position--the first in the county.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Esther, shaking her head mischievously. \"I think him\ntoo high for it.\"\n\n\"I see you can be ardent in your admiration.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is my champagne; you know I don't like the other kind.\"\n\n\"That would be satisfactory if one were sure of getting your\nadmiration,\" said Harold, leading her up to the terrace, and amongst the\ncrocuses, from whence they had a fine view of the park and river. They\nstood still near the east parapet, and saw the dash of light on the\nwater, and the pencilled shadows of the trees on the grassy lawn.\n\n\"Would it do as well to admire you, instead of being worthy to be\nadmired?\" said Harold, turning his eyes from that landscape to Esther's\nface.\n\n\"It would be a thing to be put up with,\" said Esther, smiling at him\nrather roguishly. \"But you are not in that state of self-despair.\"\n\n\"Well, I am conscious of not having those severe virtues that you have\nbeen praising.\"\n\n\"That is true. You are quite in another _genre_.\"\n\n\"A woman would not find me a tragic hero.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! She must dress for general comedy--such as your mother once\ndescribed to me--where the most thrilling event is the drawing of a\nhandsome check.\"\n\n\"You are a naughty fairy,\" said Harold, daring to press Esther's hand a\nlittle more closely to him, and drawing her down the eastern steps into\nthe pleasure-ground, as if he were unwilling to give up the\nconversation. \"Confess that you are disgusted with my want of romance.\"\n\n\"I shall not confess to being disgusted. I shall ask you to confess that\nyou are not a romantic figure.\"\n\n\"I am a little too stout.\"\n\n\"For romance--yes. At least you must find security for not getting\nstouter.\"\n\n\"And I don't look languishing enough?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--rather too much so--at a fine cigar.\"\n\n\"And I am not in danger of committing suicide?\"\n\n\"No; you are a widower.\"\n\nHarold did not reply immediately to this last thrust of Esther's. She\nhad uttered it with innocent thoughtlessness from the playful\nsuggestions of the moment; but it was a fact that Harold's previous\nmarried life had entered strongly in her impressions about him. The\npresence of Harry made it inevitable. Harold took this allusion of\nEsther's as an indication that his quality of widower was a point that\nmade against him; and after a brief silence he said, in an altered, more\nserious tone--\n\n\"You don't suppose, I hope, that any other woman has ever held the place\nthat you could hold in my life?\"\n\nEsther began to tremble a little, as she always did when the love-talk\nbetween them seemed getting serious. She only gave the rather stumbling\nanswer, \"How so?\"\n\n\"Harry's mother had been a slave--was bought, in fact.\"\n\nIt was impossible for Harold to preconceive the effect this had on\nEsther. His natural disqualification for judging of a girl's feelings\nwas heightened by the blinding effect of an exclusive object--which was\nto assure her that her own place was peculiar and supreme. Hitherto\nEsther's acquaintance with oriental love was derived chiefly from\nByronic poems, and this had not sufficed to adjust her mind to a new\nstory, where the Giaour concerned was giving her his arm. She was unable\nto speak; and Harold went on--\n\n\"Though I am close on thirty-five, I never met with a woman at all like\nyou before. There are new eras in one's life that are equivalent to\nyouth--are something better than youth. I was never an aspirant till I\nknew you.\"\n\nEsther was still silent.\n\n\"Not that I dare to call myself that. I am not so confident a personage\nas you imagine. I am necessarily in a painful position for a man who has\nany feeling.\"\n\nHere at last Harold had stirred the right fibre. Esther's generosity\nseized at once the whole meaning implied in that last sentence. She had\na fine sensibility to the line at which flirtation must cease; and she\nwas now pale and shaken with feelings she had not yet defined for\nherself.\n\n\"Do not let us speak of difficult things any more now,\" she said, with\ngentle seriousness. \"I am come into a new world of late, and have to\nlearn life all over again. Let us go in. I must see poor Mrs. Holt\nagain, and my little friend Job.\"\n\nShe paused at the glass door that opened on the terrace, and entered\nthere, while Harold went round to the stables.\n\nWhen Esther had been up-stairs and descended again into the large\nentrance-hall, she found its stony capaciousness made lively by human\nfigures extremely unlike the statues. Since Harry insisted on playing\nwith Job again, Mrs. Holt and her orphan, after dining, had just been\nbrought to this delightful scene for a game at hide-and-seek, and for\nexhibiting the climbing powers of the two pet squirrels. Mrs. Holt sat\non a stool, in singular relief against the pedestal of the Apollo, while\nDominic and Denner (otherwise Mrs. Hickes) bore her company; Harry, in\nhis bright red and purple, flitted about like a great tropic bird after\nthe sparrow-tailed Job, who hid himself with much intelligence behind\nthe scagliola pillars and the pedestals; while one of the squirrels\nperched itself on the head of the tallest statue, and the other was\nalready peeping down from among the heavy stuccoed angels on the\nceiling, near the summit of a pillar.\n\nMrs. Holt held on her lap a basket filled with good things for Job, and\nseemed much soothed by pleasant company and excellent treatment. As\nEsther, descending softly and unobserved, leaned over the stone\nbanisters and looked at the scene for a minute or two, she saw that Mrs.\nHolt's attention, having been directed to the squirrel which had\nscampered on to the head of the Silenus carrying the infant Bacchus, had\nbeen drawn downward to the tiny babe looked at with so much affection by\nthe rather ugly and hairy gentleman, of whom she nevertheless spoke with\nreserve as of one who possibly belonged to the Transome family.\n\n\"It's most pretty to see its little limbs, and the gentleman holding it.\nI should think he was amiable by his look; but it was odd he should have\nhis likeness took without any clothes. Was he Transome by name?\" (Mrs.\nHolt suspected that there might be a mild madness in the family.)\n\nDenner, peering and smiling quietly, was about to reply, when she was\nprevented by the appearance of old Mr. Transome, who since his walk had\nbeen having \"forty winks\" on the sofa in the library, and now came out\nto look for Harry. He had doffed his fur cap and cloak, but in lying\ndown to sleep he had thrown over his shoulders a soft Oriental scarf\nwhich Harold had given him, and this still hung over his scanty white\nhair and down to his knees, held fast by his wooden-looking arms and\nlaxly-clasped hands, which fell in front of him.\n\nThis singular appearance of an undoubted Transome fitted exactly into\nMrs. Holt's thought at the moment. It lay in the probabilities of things\nthat gentry's intellects should be peculiar: since they had not to get\ntheir own living, the good Lord might have economized in their case that\ncommon-sense which others were so much more in need of; and in the\nshuffling figure before her she saw a descendant of the gentleman who\nhad chosen to be represented without his clothes--all the more eccentric\nwhere there were the means of buying the best. But these oddities \"said\nnothing\" in great folks, who were powerful in high quarters all the\nsame. And Mrs. Holt rose and courtesied with a proud respect, precisely\nas she would have done if Mr. Transome had looked as wise as Lord\nBurleigh.\n\n\"I hope I'm in no way taking a liberty, sir,\" she began, while the old\ngentleman looked at her with bland feebleness; \"I'm not that woman to\nsit anywhere out of my own home without inviting and pressing to. But I\nwas brought here to wait, because the little gentleman wanted to play\nwith the orphin child.\"\n\n\"Very glad, my good woman--sit down--sit down,\" said Mr. Transome,\nnodding and smiling between his clauses. \"Nice little boy. Your\ngrandchild?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, no,\" said Mrs. Holt, continuing to stand. Quite apart from\nany awe of Mr. Transome--sitting down, she felt, would be a too great\nfamiliarity with her own pathetic importance on this extra and\nunlooked-for occasion. \"It's not me has any grandchild, nor ever shall\nhave, though most fit. But with my only son saying he'll never be\nmarried, and in prison besides, and some saying he'll be transported,\nyou may see yourself--though a gentleman--as there isn't much chance of\nmy having grandchildren of my own. And this is old Master Tudge's\ngrandchild, as my own Felix took to for pity because he was sickly and\nclemm'd, and I was noways against it, being of a tender heart. For I'm a\nwidow myself, and my son Felix, though big, is fatherless, and I know my\nduty in consequence. And it's to be wished, sir, as others should know\nit as are more in power and live in great houses, and can ride in a\ncarriage where they will. And if you're the gentleman as is the head of\neverything--and it's not to be thought you'd give up to your son as a\npoor widow's been forced to do--it behooves you to take the part of them\nas are deserving; for the Bible says gray hairs should speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--poor woman--what shall I say?\" said old Mr. Transome, feeling\nhimself scolded, and, as usual, desirous of mollifying displeasure.\n\n\"Sir, I can tell you what to say fast enough; for it's what I should say\nmyself if I could get to speak to the king. For I've asked them that\nknow, and they say it's the truth, both out of the Bible, and in, as the\nking can pardon anything and anybody. And judging by his countenance on\nthe new signs, and the talk there was a while ago about his being the\npeople's friend, as the minister once said it from the very pulpit--if\nthere's any meaning in words, he'll do the right thing by me and my son,\nif he's asked proper.\"\n\n\"Yes--a very good man--he'll do anything right,\" said Mr. Transome,\nwhose own ideas about the king just then were somewhat misty, consisting\nchiefly in broken reminiscences of George III. \"I'll ask him anything\nyou like,\" he added, with a pressing desire to satisfy Mrs. Holt, who\nalarmed him slightly.\n\n\"Then, sir, if you'll go in your carriage and say, this young man, Felix\nHolt by name, as his father was known the country round, and his mother\nmost respectable--he never meant harm to anybody, and so far from bloody\nmurder and fighting, would part with his victual to them that needed it\nmore--and if you'd get other gentlemen to say the same, and if they're\nnot satisfied to enquire--I'll not believe but what the king 'ud let my\nson out of prison. Or if it's true he must stand his trial, the king 'ud\ntake care no mischief happened to him. I've got my senses, and I'll\nnever believe as in a country where there's a God above and a king\nbelow, the right thing can't be done if great people was willing to do\nit.\"\n\nMrs. Holt, like all orators, had waxed louder and more energetic,\nceasing to propel her arguments, and being propelled by them. Poor old\nMr. Transome, getting more and more frightened at this severe-spoken\nwoman, who had the horrible possibility to his mind of being a novelty\nthat was to become permanent, seemed to be fascinated by fear, and stood\nhelplessly forgetful that if he liked he might turn round and walk away.\n\nLittle Harry, alive to anything that had relation to \"Gappa,\" had paused\nin his game, and discerning what he thought a hostile aspect in this\nnaughty black old woman, rushed toward her and proceeded first to beat\nher with his mimic jockey's whip, and then, suspecting that her\nbombazine was not sensitive, to set his teeth in her arm. While Dominic\nrebuked him and pulled him off, Nimrod began to bark anxiously, and the\nscene was become alarming even to the squirrels, which scrambled as far\noff as possible.\n\nEsther, who had been waiting for an opportunity of intervention, now\ncame up to Mrs. Holt to speak some soothing words; and old Mr. Transome,\nseeing a sufficient screen between himself and his formidable suppliant,\nat last gathered courage to turn round and shuffle away with unusual\nswiftness into the library.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Holt,\" said Esther, \"do rest comforted. I assure you, you\nhave done the utmost that can be done by your words. Your visit has not\nbeen thrown away. See how the children have enjoyed it! I saw little Job\nactually laughing. I think I never saw him do more than smile before.\"\nThen turning round to Dominic, she said, \"Will the buggy come round to\nthis door?\"\n\nThis hint was sufficient. Dominic went to see if the vehicle was ready,\nand Denner, remarking that Mrs. Holt would like to mount it in the inner\ncourt, invited her to go back into the housekeeper's room. But there was\na fresh resistance raised in Harry by the threatened departure of Job,\nwho had seemed an invaluable addition to the menagerie of tamed\ncreatures; and it was barely in time that Esther had the relief of\nseeing the entrance hall cleared so as to prevent any further encounter\nof Mrs. Holt with Harold, who was now coming up the flight of steps at\nthe entrance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n           I'm sick at heart. The eye of day,\n    The insistent summer noon, seems pitiless,\n    Shining in all the barren crevices\n    Of weary life, leaving no shade, no dark,\n    Where I may dream that hidden waters lie.\n\n\nShortly after Mrs. Holt's striking presentation of herself at Transome\nCourt, Esther went on a second visit to her father. The Loamford Assizes\nwere approaching; it was expected that in about ten days Felix Holt's\ntrial would come on, and some hints in her father's letters had given\nEsther the impression that he was taking a melancholy view of the\nresult. Harold Transome had once or twice mentioned the subject with a\nfacile hopefulness as to \"the young fellow's coming off easily,\" which,\nin her anxious mind, was not a counterpoise to disquieting suggestions,\nand she had not chosen to introduce another conversation about Felix\nHolt, by questioning Harold concerning the probabilities he relied on.\nSince those moments on the terrace, Harold had daily become more of the\nsolicitous and indirectly beseeching lover; and Esther, from the very\nfact that she was weighed on by thoughts that were painfully bewildering\nto her--by thoughts which, in their newness to her young mind, seemed to\nshake her belief that life could be anything else than a compromise with\nthings repugnant to the moral taste--had become more passive to his\nattentions at the very time that she had begun to feel more profoundly\nthat in accepting Harold Transome she left the high mountain air, the\npassionate serenity of perfect love forever behind her, and must adjust\nher wishes to a life of middling delights, overhung with the languorous\nhaziness of motiveless ease, where poetry was only literature, and the\nfine ideas had to be taken down from the shelves of the library when her\nhusband's back was turned. But it seemed as if all outward conditions\nconcurred, along with her generous sympathy for the Transomes, and with\nthose native tendencies against which she had once begun to struggle, to\nmake this middling lot the best she could attain to. She was in this\nhalf-sad, half-satisfied resignation to something like what is called\nworldly wisdom, when she went to see her father, and learn what she\ncould from him about Felix.\n\nThe little minister was much depressed, unable to resign himself to the\ndread which had begun to haunt him, that Felix might have to endure the\nodious penalty of transportation for the manslaughter, which was the\noffence that no evidence in his favor could disprove.\n\n\"I had been encouraged by the assurances of men instructed in this\nregard,\" said Mr. Lyon, while Esther sat on the stool near him, and\nlistened anxiously, \"that though he were pronounced guilty in regard to\nthis deed whereunto he hath calamitously fallen, yet that a judge mildly\ndisposed, and with a due sense of that invisible activity of the soul\nwhereby the deeds which are the same in outward appearance and effect,\nyet differ as the knife-stroke of the surgeon, even though it kill,\ndiffers from the knife-stroke of a wanton mutilater, might use his\ndiscretion in tempering the punishment, so that it would not be very\nevil to bear. But now it is said that the judge who cometh is a severe\nman, and one nourishing a prejudice against the bolder spirits who\nstand not in the old paths.\"\n\n\"I am going to be present at the trial, father,\" said Esther, who was\npreparing the way to express a wish, which she was timid about even with\nher father. \"I mentioned to Mrs. Transome that I should like to do so,\nand she said that she used in old days always to attend the assizes, and\nthat she would take me. You will be there, father?\"\n\n\"Assuredly I shall be there, having been summoned to bear witness to\nFelix's character, and to his having uttered remonstrances and warnings\nlong beforehand whereby he proved himself an enemy to riot. In our ears,\nwho know him, it sounds strangely that aught else should be credible;\nbut he hath few to speak for him, though I trust that Mr. Harold\nTransome's testimony will go far, if, as you say, he is disposed to set\naside minor regards, and not to speak the truth grudgingly and\nreluctantly. For the very truth hath a color from the disposition of the\nutterer.\"\n\n\"He is kind; he is capable of being generous,\" said Esther.\n\n\"It is well. For I verily believe that evil-minded men have been at work\nagainst Felix. The _Duffield Watchman_ hath written continually in\nallusion to him as one of those mischievous men who seek to elevate\nthemselves through the dishonor of their party; and as one of those who\ngo not heart and soul with the needs of the people, but seek only to get\na hearing for themselves by raising their voices in crotchety discord.\nIt is these things that cause me heaviness of spirit: the dark secret of\nthis young man's lot is a cross I carry daily.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Esther, timidly, while the eyes of both were filling with\ntears, \"I should like to see him again before his trial. Might I? Will\nyou ask him? Will you take me?\"\n\nThe minister raised his suffused eyes to hers, and did not speak for a\nmoment or two. A new thought had visited him. But his delicate\ntenderness shrank even from an inward enquiry that was too curious--that\nseemed like an effort to peep at sacred secrets.\n\n\"I see naught against it, my dear child, if you arrived early enough,\nand would take the elderly lady into your confidence, so that you might\ndescend from the carriage at some suitable place--the house of the\nIndependent minister, for example--where I could meet and accompany you.\nI would forewarn Felix, who would doubtless delight to see your face\nagain; seeing that he may go away, and be, as it were, buried from you,\neven though it may be only in prison, and not----\"\n\nThis was too much for Esther. She threw her arms round her father's neck\nand sobbed like a child. It was an unspeakable relief to her after all\nthe pent-up, stifling experience, all the inward incommunicable debate\nof the last few weeks. The old man was deeply moved, too, and held his\narm close round the dear child, praying silently.\n\nNo word was spoken for some minutes, till Esther raised herself, dried\nher eyes, and, with an action that seemed playful, though there was no\nsmile on her face, pressed her handkerchief against her father's cheeks.\nThen, when she had put her hand in his, he said, solemnly--\n\n\"'Tis a great and mysterious gift, this clinging of the heart, my\nEsther, whereby it hath often seemed to me that even in the very moment\nof suffering our souls have the keenest foretaste of heaven. I speak not\nlightly, but as one who hath endured. And 'tis a strange truth that only\nin the agony of parting we look into the depths of love.\"\n\nSo the interview ended, without any question from Mr. Lyon concerning\nwhat Esther contemplated as the ultimate arrangement between herself and\nthe Transomes.\n\nAfter this conversation, which showed him that what happened to Felix\ntouched Esther more closely than he had supposed, the minister felt no\nimpulse to raise the images of a future so unlike anything that Felix\nwould share. And Esther would have been unable to answer any such\nquestions. The successive weeks, instead of bringing her nearer to\nclearness and decision, had only brought that state of disenchantment\nbelonging to the actual presence of things which have long dwelt in the\nimagination with all the factitious charms of arbitrary arrangement. Her\nimaginary mansion had not been inhabited just as Transome Court was; her\nimaginary fortune had not been attended with circumstances which she was\nunable to sweep away. She, herself, in her Utopia, had never been what\nshe was now--a woman whose heart was divided and oppressed. The first\nspontaneous offering of her woman's devotion, the first great\ninspiration of her life, was a sort of vanished ecstasy which had left\nits wounds. It seemed to her a cruel misfortune of her young life that\nher best feeling, her most precious dependence, had been called forth\njust where the conditions were hardest, and that all the easy\ninvitations of circumstance were toward something which that previous\nconsecration of her longing had made a moral descent for her. It was\ncharacteristic of her that she scarcely at all entertained the\nalternative of such a compromise as would have given her the larger\nportion of the fortune to which she had a legal claim, and yet have\nsatisfied her sympathy by leaving the Transomes in possession of their\nold home. Her domestication with this family had brought them into the\nforeground of her imagination; the gradual wooing of Harold had acted on\nher with a constant immediate influence that predominated over all\nindefinite prospects; and a solitary elevation to wealth, which out of\nUtopia she had no notion how she should manage, looked as chill and\ndreary as the offer of dignities in an unknown country.\n\nIn the ages since Adam's marriage, it has been good for some men to be\nalone, and for some women also. But Esther was not one of these women:\nshe was intensely of the feminine type, verging neither toward the saint\nnor the angel. She was \"a fair divided excellence, whose fullness of\nperfection\" must be in marriage. And, like all youthful creatures, she\nfelt as if the present conditions of choice were final. It belonged to\nthe freshness of her heart that, having had her emotions strongly\nstirred by real objects, she never speculated on possible relations yet\nto come. It seemed to her that she stood at the first and last parting\nof the ways. And, in one sense she was under no illusion. It is only in\nthat freshness of our time that the choice is possible which gives unity\nto life, and makes the memory a temple where all relics and all votive\nofferings, all worship and all grateful joy, are an unbroken history\nsanctified by one religion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n    We may not make this world a paradise\n    By walking it together with clasped hands\n    And eyes that meeting feed a double strength.\n    We must be only joined by pains divine,\n    Of spirits blent in mutual memories.\n\n\nIt was a consequence of that interview with her father, that when Esther\nstepped early on a gray March morning into the carriage with Mrs.\nTransome, to go to the Loamford Assizes, she was full of an expectation\nthat held her lips in trembling silence, and gave her eyes that\nsightless beauty which tells that the vision is all within.\n\nMrs. Transome did not disturb her with unnecessary speech. Of late,\nEsther's anxious observation had been drawn to a change in Mrs.\nTransome, shown in many small ways which only women notice. It was not\nonly that when they sat together the talk seemed more of an effort to\nher: that might have come from the gradual draining away of matter for\ndiscourse pertaining to most sorts of companionship, in which repetition\nis not felt to be as desirable as novelty. But while Mrs. Transome was\ndressed just as usual, took her seat as usual, trifled with her drugs\nand had her embroidery before her as usual, and still made her morning\ngreetings with that finished easy politeness and consideration of tone\nwhich to rougher people seems like affectation, Esther noticed a strange\nfitfulness in her movements. Sometimes the stitches of her embroidery\nwent on with silent unbroken swiftness for a quarter of an hour, as if\nshe had to work out her deliverance from bondage by finishing a\nscroll-patterned border; then her hands dropped suddenly and her gaze\nfell blankly on the table before her, and she would sit in that way\nmotionless as a seated statue, apparently unconscious of Esther's\npresence, till some thought darting within her seemed to have the effect\nof an external shock and rouse her with a start, when she looked around\nhastily like a person ashamed of having slept. Esther, touched with\nwondering pity at signs of unhappiness that were new in her experience,\ntook the most delicate care to appear inobservant, and only tried to\nincrease the gentle attention that might help to soothe or gratify this\nuneasy woman. But, one morning, Mrs. Transome had said, breaking a\nrather long silence--\n\n\"My dear, I shall make this house dull for you. You sit with me like an\nembodied patience. I am unendurable; I am getting into a melancholy\ndotage. A fidgety old woman like me is as unpleasant to see as a rook\nwith its wing broken. Don't mind me, my dear. Run away from me without\nceremony. Every one else does, you see. I am part of the old furniture\nwith new drapery.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Transome,\" said Esther, gliding to the low ottoman close by\nthe basket of embroidery, \"do you dislike my sitting with you?\"\n\n\"Only for your own sake, my fairy,\" said Mrs. Transome, smiling faintly,\nand putting her hand under Esther's chin. \"Doesn't it make you shudder\nto look at me?\"\n\n\"Why will you say such naughty things?\" said Esther, affectionately. \"If\nyou had had a daughter, she would have desired to be with you most when\nyou most wanted cheering. And surely every young woman has something of\na daughter's feeling toward an older one who has been kind to her.\"\n\n\"I should like you to be really my daughter,\" said Mrs. Transome,\nrousing herself to look a little brighter. \"That is something still for\nan old woman to hope for.\"\n\nEsther blushed: she had not foreseen this application of words that came\nfrom pitying tenderness. To divert the train of thought as quickly as\npossible, she at once asked what she had previously had in her mind to\nask. Before her blush had disappeared she said:\n\n\"Oh, you are so good; I shall ask you to indulge me very much. It is to\nlet us set out very early to Loamford on Wednesday, and put me down at a\nparticular house, that I may keep an appointment with my father. It is a\nprivate matter, that I wish no one to know about, if possible. And he\nwill bring me back to you wherever you appoint.\"\n\nIn that way Esther won her end without needing to betray it; and as\nHarold was already away at Loamford, she was the more secure.\n\nThe Independent minister's house at which she was set down, and where\nshe was received by her father, was in a quiet street not far from the\njail. Esther had thrown a dark cloak over the handsomer coverings which\nDenner had assured her were absolutely required of ladies who sat\nanywhere near the judge at a great trial; and as the bonnet of that day\ndid not throw the face into high relief, but rather into perspective, a\nveil drawn down gave her a sufficiently inconspicuous appearance.\n\n\"I have arranged all things, my dear,\" said Mr. Lyon, \"and Felix expects\nus. We will lose no time.\"\n\nThey walked away at once, Esther not asking a question. She had no\nconsciousness of the road along which they passed; she could never\nremember anything but a dim sense of entering within high walls and\ngoing along passages, till they were ushered into a larger space than\nshe had expected, and her father said:\n\n\"It is here that we are permitted to see Felix, my Esther. He will\npresently appear.\"\n\nEsther automatically took off her gloves and bonnet, as if she had\nentered the house after a walk. She had lost the complete consciousness\nof everything except that she was going to see Felix. She trembled. It\nseemed to her as if he too would look altered after her new life--as if\neven the past would change for her and be no longer a steadfast\nremembrance, but something she had been mistaken about, as she had been\nabout the new life. Perhaps she was growing out of that childhood to\nwhich common things have rareness, and all objects look larger. Perhaps\nfrom henceforth the whole world was to be meaner for her. The dread\nconcentrated in those few moments seemed worse than anything she had\nknown before. It was what the dread of the pilgrim might be who has it\nwhispered to him that the holy places are a delusion, or that he will\nsee them with a soul unstirred and unbelieving. Every minute that passes\nmay be charged with some such crisis in the little inner world of man or\nwoman.\n\nBut soon the door opened slightly; someone looked in; then it opened\nwide, and Felix Holt entered.\n\n\"Miss Lyon--Esther!\" and her hand was in his grasp.\n\nHe was just the same--no, something inexpressibly better, because of the\ndistance and separation, and the half-weary novelties, which made him\nlike the return of the morning.\n\n\"Take no heed of me, children,\" said Mr. Lyon. \"I have some notes to\nmake, and my time is precious. We may remain here only a quarter of an\nhour.\" And the old man sat down at a window with his back to them,\nwriting with his head bent close to the paper.\n\n\"You are very pale; you look ill, compared with your old self,\" said\nEsther. She had taken her hand away, but they stood still near each\nother, she looking up at him.\n\n\"The fact is, I'm not fond of prison,\" said Felix, smiling; \"but I\nsuppose the best I can hope for is to have a good deal more of it.\"\n\n\"It is thought that in the worst case a pardon may be obtained,\" said\nEsther, avoiding Harold Transome's name.\n\n\"I don't rely on that,\" said Felix, shaking his head. \"My wisest course\nis to make up my mind to the very ugliest penalty they can condemn me\nto. If I can face that, anything less will seem easy. But you know,\" he\nwent on, smiling at her brightly, \"I never went in for fine company and\ncushions. I can't be very heavily disappointed in that way.\"\n\n\"Do you see things just as you used to do?\" said Esther, turning pale as\nshe said it--\"I mean--about poverty, and the people you will live among.\nHas all the misunderstanding and sadness left you just as obstinate?\"\nShe tried to smile, but could not succeed.\n\n\"What--about the sort of life I should lead if I were free again?\" said\nFelix.\n\n\"Yes. I can't help being discouraged for you by all these things that\nhave happened. See how you may fail!\" Esther spoke timidly. She saw a\npeculiar smile, which she knew well, gathering in his eyes. \"Ah, I dare\nsay I am silly,\" she said, deprecatingly.\n\n\"No, you are dreadfully inspired,\" said Felix. \"When the wicked Tempter\nis tired of snarling that word failure in a man's cell, he sends a voice\nlike a thrush to say it for him. See now what a messenger of darkness\nyou are!\" He smiled, and took her two hands between his, pressed\ntogether as children hold them up in prayer. Both of them felt too\nsolemnly to be bashful. They looked straight into each other's eyes, as\nangels do when they tell some truth. And they stood in that way while he\nwent on speaking.\n\n\"But I'm proof against that word failure. I've seen behind it. The only\nfailure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he\nsees to be best. As to just the amount of result he may see from his\nparticular work--that's a tremendous uncertainty: the universe has not\nbeen arranged for the gratification of his feelings. As long as a man\nsees and believes in some great good, he'll prefer working toward that\nin the way he's best fit for, come what may. I put effects at their\nminimum, but I'd rather have the maximum of effect, if it's of the sort\nI care for, than the maximum of effect I don't care for--a lot of fine\nthings that are not to my taste--and if they were, the conditions of\nholding them while the world is what it is, are such as would jar on me\nlike grating metal.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Esther, in a lone tone, \"I think I understand that now,\nbetter than I used to do.\" The words of Felix at last seemed strangely\nto fit her own experience. But she said no more, though he seemed to\nwait for it a moment or two, looking at her. But then he went on--\n\n\"I don't mean to be illustrious, you know, and make a new era, else it\nwould be kind of you to get a raven and teach it to croak 'failure' in\nmy ears. Where great things can't happen, I care for very small things,\nsuch as will never be known beyond a few garrets and workshops. And\nthen, as to one thing I believe in, I don't think I can altogether fail.\nIf there's anything our people want convincing of, it is, that there's\nsome dignity and happiness for a man other than changing his station.\nThat's one of the beliefs I choose to consecrate my life to. If anybody\ncould demonstrate to me that I was a flat for it, I shouldn't think it\nwould follow that I must borrow money to set up genteelly and order new\nclothes. That's not a rigorous consequence to my understanding.\"\n\nThey smiled at each other, with the old sense of amusement they had so\noften had together.\n\n\"You are just the same,\" said Esther.\n\n\"And you?\" said Felix. \"My affairs have been settled long ago. But\nyours--a great change has come in them--magic at work.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Esther, rather falteringly.\n\n\"Well,\" said Felix, looking at her gravely again, \"it's a case of\nfitness that seems to give a chance sanction to that musty law. The\nfirst time I saw you your birth was an immense puzzle to me. However,\nthe appropriate conditions are come at last.\"\n\nThese words seemed cruel to Esther. But Felix could not know all the\nreasons for their seeming so. She could not speak; she was turning cold\nand feeling her heart beat painfully.\n\n\"All your tastes are gratified now,\" he went on innocently. \"But you'll\nremember the old pedagogue and his lectures?\"\n\nOne thought in the mind of Felix was, that Esther was sure to marry\nHarold Transome. Men readily believe these things of the women who love\nthem. But he could not allude to the marriage more directly. He was\nafraid of this destiny for her, without having any very distinct\nknowledge by which to justify his fear to the mind of another. It did\nnot satisfy him that Esther should marry Harold Transome.\n\n\"My children,\" said Mr. Lyon at this moment, not looking round, but only\nlooking close at his watch, \"we have just two minutes more.\" Then he\nwent on writing.\n\nEsther did not speak, but Felix could not help observing now that her\nhands had turned to a deathly coldness, and that she was trembling. He\nbelieved, he knew, that whatever prospects she had, this feeling was for\nhis sake. An overpowering impulse from mingled love, gratitude, and\nanxiety, urged him to say--\n\n\"I had a horrible struggle, Esther. But you see I was right. There was a\nfitting lot in reserve for you. But remember you have cost a great\nprice--don't throw what is precious away. I shall want the news that you\nhave a happiness worthy of you.\"\n\nEsther felt too miserable for tears to come. She looked helplessly at\nFelix for a moment, then took her hands from his, and, turning away\nmutely, walked dreamily toward her father, and said, \"Father, I am\nready--there is no more to say.\"\n\nShe turned back again, toward the chair where her bonnet lay, with a\nface quite corpse-like above her dark garments.\n\n\"Esther!\"\n\nShe heard Felix say the word, with an entreating cry, and went toward\nhim with the swift movement of a frightened child toward its protector.\nHe clasped her, and they kissed each other.\n\nShe never could recall anything else that happened, till she was in the\ncarriage again with Mrs. Transome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\n    Why, there are maidens of heroic touch,\n    And yet they seem like things of gossamer\n    You'd pinch the life out of, as out of moths.\n    Oh, it is not loud tones and mouthingness,\n    'Tis not the arms akimbo and large strides,\n    That make a woman's force. The tiniest birds,\n    With softest downy breasts, have passions in them,\n    And are brave with love.\n\n\nEsther was so placed in the Court, under Mrs. Transome's wing, as to see\nand hear everything without effort: Harold had received them at the\nhotel, and had observed that Esther looked ill, and was unusually\nabstracted in her manner; but this seemed to be sufficiently accounted\nfor by her sympathetic anxiety about the result of a trial in which the\nprisoner at the bar was a friend, and in which both her father and\nhimself were important witnesses, Mrs. Transome had no reluctance to\nkeep a small secret from her son, and no betrayal was made of that\nprevious \"engagement\" of Esther's with her father. Harold was\nparticularly delicate and unobtrusive in his attentions to-day: he had\nthe consciousness that he was going to behave in a way that would\ngratify Esther and win her admiration, and we are all of us made more\ngraceful by the inward presence of what we believe to be a generous\npurpose; our actions move to a hidden music--\"a melody that's sweetly\nplayed in tune.\"\n\nIf Esther had been less absorbed by supreme feelings, she would have\nbeen aware that she was an object of special notice. In the bare\nsquareness of a public hall, where there was not one jutting angle to\nhang a guess or a thought upon, not an image or a bit of color to stir\nthe fancy, and where the only objects of speculation, of admiration, or\nof any interest whatever were human beings, that occupied positions\nindicating some importance, the notice bestowed on Esther would not have\nbeen surprising, even if it had been merely a tribute to her youthful\ncharm, which was well championed by Mrs. Transome's elderly majesty. But\nit was due also to whisperings that she was an hereditary claimant of\nthe Transome estates, whom Harold Transome was about to marry. Harold\nhimself had of late not cared to conceal either the fact or the\nprobability: they both tended rather to his honor than his dishonor. And\nto-day, when there was a good proportion of Trebians present, the\nwhisperings spread rapidly.\n\nThe Court was still more crowded than on the previous day, when our poor\nacquaintance Dredge and his two collier companions were sentenced to a\nyear's imprisonment with hard labor, and the more enlightened prisoner,\nwho stole the Debarry's plate, to transportation for life. Poor Dredge\nhad cried, had wished he'd \"never heared of 'lection,\" and in spite of\nsermons from the jail chaplain, fell back on the explanation that this\nwas a world in which Spratt and Old Nick were sure to get the best of\nit; so that in Dredge's case, at least, most observers must have had the\nmelancholy conviction that there had been no enhancement of public\nspirit and faith in progress from that wave of political agitation which\nhad reached the Sproxton Pits.\n\nBut curiosity was necessarily at a higher pitch to-day, when the\ncharacter of the prisoner and the circumstances of his offence were of a\nhighly unusual kind. Soon as Felix appeared at the bar, a murmur rose\nand spread into a loud buzz, which continued until there had been\nrepeated authoritative calls for silence in the Court. Rather\nsingularly, it was now for the first time that Esther had a feeling of\npride in him on the ground simply of his appearance. At this moment,\nwhen he was the centre of a multitudinous gaze, which seemed to act on\nher own vision like a broad unmitigated daylight, she felt that there\nwas something pre-eminent in him, notwithstanding the vicinity of\nnumerous gentlemen. No apple-woman would have admired him; not only to\nfeminine minds like Mrs. Tiliot's, but to many minds in coat and\nwaistcoat, there was something dangerous and perhaps unprincipled in his\nbare throat and great Gothic head; and his somewhat massive person would\ndoubtless have come out very oddly from the hands of a fashionable\ntailor of that time. But as Esther saw his large gray eyes looking round\ncalmly and undefiantly, first at the audience generally, and then with a\nmore observant expression at the lawyers and other persons immediately\naround him, she felt that he bore the outward stamp of a distinguished\nnature. Forgive her if she needed this satisfaction; all of us, whether\nmen or women, are liable to this weakness of liking to have our\npreference justified before others as well as ourselves. Esther said\ninwardly, with a certain triumph, that Felix Holt looked as worthy to\nbe chosen in the midst of this large assembly, as he had ever looked in\ntheir _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ under the sombre light of the little parlor in\nMalthouse Yard.\n\nEsther had felt some relief in hearing from her father that Felix had\ninsisted on doing without his mother's presence; and since to Mrs.\nHolt's imagination, notwithstanding her general desire to have her\ncharacter enquired into, there was no greatly consolatory difference\nbetween being a witness and a criminal, and an appearance of any kind\n\"before the judge\" could hardly be made to suggest anything definite\nthat would overcome the dim sense of unalleviated disgrace, she had been\nless inclined than usual to complain of her son's decision. Esther had\nshuddered beforehand at the inevitable farce there would be in Mrs.\nHolt's testimony. But surely Felix would lose something for want of a\nwitness who could testify to his behavior in the morning before he\nbecame involved in the tumult?\n\n\"He is really a fine young fellow,\" said Harold, coming to speak to\nEsther after a colloquy with the prisoner's solicitor. \"I hope he will\nnot make a blunder in defending himself.\"\n\n\"He is not likely to make a blunder,\" said Esther. She had recovered her\ncolor a little, and was brighter than she had been all the morning\nbefore.\n\nFelix had seemed to include her in his general glance, but had avoided\nlooking at her particularly. She understood how delicate feeling for her\nwould prevent this, and that she might safely look at him, and toward\nher father, whom she could see in the same direction. Turning to Harold,\nto make an observation, she saw that he was looking toward the same\npoint, but with an expression on his face that surprised her.\n\n\"Dear me,\" she said, prompted to speak without any reflection; \"--how\nangry you look! I never saw you look so angry before. It is not my\nfather you are looking at?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I am angry at something I'm looking away from,\" said Harold,\nmaking an effort to drive back the troublesome demon who would stare out\nat window. \"It's that Jermyn,\" he added, glancing at his mother as well\nas Esther. \"He will thrust himself under my eyes everywhere since I\nrefused him an interview and returned his letter. I'm determined never\nto speak to him directly again, if I can help it.\"\n\nMrs. Transome heard with a changeless face. She had for some time been\nwatching, and had taken on her marble look of immobility. She said an\ninward bitter \"Of course!\" to everything that was unpleasant.\n\nAfter this Esther soon became impatient of all speech; her attention was\nrivetted on the proceedings of the Court, and on the mode in which Felix\nbore himself. In the case for the prosecution there was nothing more\nthan a reproduction, with irrelevancies added by witnesses, of the facts\nalready known to us. Spratt had retained consciousness enough, in the\nmidst of his terror, to swear that, when he was tied to the finger-post,\nFelix was presiding over the actions of the mob. The landlady of the\nSeven Stars, who was indebted to Felix for rescue from pursuit by some\ndrunken rioters, gave evidence that went to prove his assumption of\nleadership prior to the assault on Spratt,--remembering only that he had\ncalled away her pursuers to \"better sport.\" Various respectable\nwitnesses swore to Felix's \"encouragement\" of the rioters who were\ndragging Spratt in King Street; to his fatal assault on Tucker; and to\nhis attitude in front of the drawing-room window at the Manor.\n\nThree other witnesses gave evidence of expressions used by the prisoner,\ntending to show the character of the acts with which he was charged. Two\nwere Treby tradesmen, the third was a clerk from Duffield. The clerk had\nheard Felix speak at Duffield; the Treby men had frequently heard him\ndeclare himself on public matters; and they all quoted expressions which\ntended to show that he had a virulent feeling against the respectable\nshopkeeping class, and that nothing was likely to be more congenial to\nhim than the gutting of retailer's shops. No one else knew--the\nwitnesses themselves did not know fully--how far their strong perception\nand memory on these points was due to a fourth mind, namely, that of Mr.\nJohn Johnson, the attorney, who was nearly related to one of the Treby\nwitnesses, and a familiar acquaintance of the Duffield clerk. Man cannot\nbe defined as an evidence-giving animal; and in the difficulty of\ngetting up evidence on any subject, there is room for much unrecognized\naction of diligent persons who have the extra stimulus of some private\nmotive. Mr. Johnson was present in Court to-day, but in a modest,\nretired situation. He had come down to give information to Mr. Jermyn,\nand to gather information in other quarters, which was well illuminated\nby the appearance of Esther in company with the Transomes.\n\nWhen the case for the prosecution closed, all strangers thought that it\nlooked very black for the prisoner. In two instances only Felix had\nchosen to put a cross-examining question. The first was to ask Spratt if\nhe did not believe that his having been tied to the post had saved him\nfrom a probably mortal injury? The second was to ask the tradesman who\nswore to his having heard Felix tell the rioters to leave Tucker alone\nand come along with him, whether he had not, shortly before, heard cries\namong the mob summoning to an attack on the wine-vaults and brewery.\n\nEsther had hitherto listened closely but calmly. She knew that there\nwould be this strong adverse testimony; and all her hopes and fears were\nbent on what was to come beyond it. It was when the prisoner was asked\nwhat he had to adduce in reply that she felt herself in the grasp of\nthat tremor which does not disable the mind, but rather gives keener\nconsciousness of a mind having a penalty of body attached to it.\n\nThere was a silence as of night when Felix Holt began to speak. His\nvoice was firm and clear: he spoke with simple gravity, and evidently\nwithout any enjoyment of the occasion. Esther had never seen his face\nlook so weary.\n\n\"My Lord, I am not going to occupy the time of the Court with\nunnecessary words. I believe the witnesses for the prosecution have\nspoken the truth as far as a superficial observation would enable them\nto do it; and I see nothing that can weigh with the jury in my favor,\nunless they believe my statement of my own motives, and the testimony\nthat certain witnesses will give to my character and purposes as being\ninconsistent with my willingly abetting disorder. I will tell the Court\nin as few words as I can, how I got entangled in the mob, how I came to\nattack the constable, and how I was led to take a course which seems\nrather mad to myself, now I look back upon it.\"\n\nFelix then gave a concise narrative of his motives and conduct on the\nday of the riot, from the moment when he was startled into quitting his\nwork by the earlier uproar of the morning. He omitted, of course, his\nvisit to Malthouse Yard, and merely said that he went out to walk again\nafter returning to quiet his mother's mind. He got warmed by the story\nof his experience, which moved him more strongly than ever, now he\nrecalled it in vibrating words before a large audience of his\nfellow-men. The sublime delight of truthful speech to one who has the\ngreat gift of uttering it, will make itself felt even through the pangs\nof sorrow.\n\n\"That is all I have to say for myself, my Lord. I pleaded 'Not guilty'\nto the charge of manslaughter, because I know that word may carry a\nmeaning which would not fairly apply to my act. When I threw Tucker\ndown, I did not see the possibility that he would die from a sort of\nattack which ordinarily occurs in fighting without any fatal effect. As\nto my assaulting a constable, it was a quick choice between two evils: I\nshould else have been disabled. And he attacked me under a mistake about\nmy intentions. I'm not prepared to say I never would assault a constable\nwhere I had more chance of deliberation. I certainly should assault him\nif I saw him doing anything that made my blood boil: I reverence the\nlaw, but not where it is a pretext for wrong, which it should be the\nvery object of law to hinder. I consider that I should be making an\nunworthy defence, if I let the Court infer from what I say myself, or\nfrom what is said by my witnesses, that because I am a man who hates\ndrunken, motiveless disorder, or any wanton harm, therefore I am a man\nwho would never fight against authority: I hold it blasphemy to say that\na man ought not to fight against authority: there is no great religion\nand no great freedom that has not done it, in the beginning. It would be\nimpertinent for me to speak of this now, if I did not need to say in my\nown defence, that I should hold myself the worst sort of traitor if I\nput my hand to either fighting or disorder--which must mean to injure\nsomebody--if I were not urged to it by what I hold to be sacred\nfeelings, making a sacred duty either to my own manhood or to my\nfellow-man. And certainly,\" Felix ended, with a strong ring of scorn in\nhis voice, \"I never held it a sacred duty to try and get a Radical\ncandidate returned for North Loamshire, by willingly heading a drunken\nhowling mob, whose public action must consist in breaking windows,\ndestroying hard-got produce, and endangering the lives of men and women.\nI have no more to say, my Lord.\"\n\n\"I foresaw he would make a blunder,\" said Harold, in a low voice to\nEsther. Then, seeing her shrink a little, he feared she might suspect\nhim of being merely stung by the allusion to himself. \"I don't mean what\nhe said about the Radical candidate,\" he added, hastily, in correction.\n\"I don't mean the last sentence. I mean that whole peroration of his,\nwhich he ought to have left unsaid. It has done him harm with the\njury--they won't understand it, or rather will misunderstand it. And\nI'll answer for it, it has soured the judge. It remains to be seen what\nwe witnesses can say for him, to nullify the effect of what he has said\nfor himself. I hope the attorney has done his best in collecting the\nevidence: I understand the expense of the witnesses is undertaken by\nsome Liberals at Glasgow and in Lancashire, friends of Holt's. But I\nsuppose your father has told you.\"\n\nThe first witness called to the defence was Mr. Lyon. The gist of his\nstatements was, that from the beginning of September last till the day\nof the election he was in very frequent intercourse with the prisoner;\nthat he had become intimately acquainted with his character and views of\nlife, and his conduct with respect to the election, and that these were\ntotally inconsistent with any other supposition than his being involved\nin the riot, and his fatal encounter with the constable, were due to the\ncalamitous failure of a bold but good purpose. He stated further that he\nhad been present when an interview had occurred in his own house between\nthe prisoner and Mr. Harold Transome, who was then canvassing for the\nrepresentation of North Loamshire. That the object of the prisoner in\nseeking this interview had been to inform Mr. Transome of treating given\nin his name to the workmen in the pits and on the canal at Sproxton, and\nto remonstrate against its continuance; the prisoner fearing that\ndisturbance and mischief might result from what he believed to be the\nend toward which this treating was directed--namely, the presence of\nthese men on the occasions of the nomination and polling. Several times\nafter this interview, Mr. Lyon said, he had heard Felix Holt recur to\nthe subject therein discussed with expressions of grief and anxiety. He\nhimself was in the habit of visiting Sproxton in his ministerial\ncapacity: he knew fully what the prisoner had done there in order to\nfound a night school, and was certain that the prisoner's interest in\nthe workingmen of that district turned entirely on the possibility of\nconverting them somewhat to habits of soberness and to a due care for\nthe instruction of their children. Finally, he stated that the prisoner,\nin compliance with his request, had been present at Duffield on the day\nof the nomination, and had on his return expressed himself with strong\nindignation concerning the employment of the Sproxton men on that\noccasion, and what he called the wickedness of hiring blind violence.\n\nThe quaint appearance and manner of the little Dissenting minister could\nnot fail to stimulate the peculiar wit of the bar. He was subjected to\na troublesome cross-examination, which he bore with wide-eyed\nshort-sighted quietude and absorption in the duty of truthful response.\nOn being asked rather sneeringly, if the prisoner was not one of his\nflock? he answered, in that deeper tone which made one of the most\neffective transitions of his varying voice--\n\n\"Nay--would to God he were! I should then feel that the great virtues\nand the pure life I have beheld in him were a witness to the efficacy of\nthe faith I believe in and the discipline of the Church whereunto I\nbelong.\"\n\nPerhaps it required a larger power of comparison than was possessed by\nany of that audience to appreciate the moral elevation of an Independent\nminister who could utter those words. Nevertheless there was a murmur\nwhich was clearly one of sympathy.\n\nThe next witness, and the one on whom the interest of the spectators was\nchiefly concentrated, was Harold Transome. There was a decided\npredominance of Tory feeling in the Court, and the human disposition to\nenjoy the infliction of a little punishment on an opposite party, was in\nthis instance, of a Tory complexion. Harold was keenly alive to this,\nand to everything else that might prove disagreeable to him in his\nhaving to appear in the witness-box. But he was not likely to lose his\nself-possession, or to fail in adjusting himself gracefully, under\nconditions which most men would find it difficult to carry without\nawkwardness. He had generosity and candor enough to bear Felix Holt's\nproud rejection of his advances without any petty resentment; he had all\nthe susceptibilities of a gentleman; and these moral qualities gave the\nright direction to his acumen, in judging of the behavior that would\nbest secure his dignity. Everything requiring self-command was easier to\nhim because of Esther's presence; for her admiration was just then the\nobject which this well-tanned man of the world had it most at heart to\nsecure.\n\nWhen he entered the witness-box he was much admired by the ladies\namongst the audience, many of whom sighed a little at the thought of his\nwrong course in politics. He certainly looked like a handsome portrait\nby Sir Thomas Lawrence, in which that remarkable artist had happily\nomitted the usual excess of honeyed blandness mixed with alert\nintelligence, which is hardly compatible with the state of man out of\nparadise. He stood not far off Felix; and the two Radicals certainly\nmade a striking contrast. Felix might have come from the hands of a\nsculptor in the later Roman period, when the plastic impulse was stirred\nby the grandeur of barbaric forms--when rolled collars were not yet\nconceived, and satin stocks were not.\n\nHarold Transome declared he had had only one interview with the\nprisoner: it was the interview referred to by the previous witness, in\nwhose presence and in whose house it was begun. The interview, however,\nwas continued beyond the observation of Mr. Lyon. The prisoner and\nhimself quitted the Dissenting minister's house in Malthouse Yard\ntogether, and proceeded to the office of Mr. Jermyn, who was then\nconducting electioneering business on his behalf. His object was to\ncomply with Holt's remonstrance by enquiring into the alleged\nproceedings at Sproxton, and, if possible, to put a stop to them. Holt's\nlanguage, both in the Malthouse Yard and in the attorney's office, was\nstrong: he was evidently indignant, and his indignation turned on the\ndanger of employing ignorant men excited by drink on an occasion of\npopular concourse. He believed that Holt's sole motive was the\nprevention of disorder, and what he considered the demoralization of the\nworkmen by treating. The event had certainly justified his\nremonstrances. He had not had any subsequent opportunities of observing\nthe prisoner; but if any reliance was to be placed on a rational\nconclusion, it must, he thought, be plain that the anxiety thus\nmanifested by Holt was a guarantee of the statement he had made as to\nhis motives on the day of the riot. His entire impression from Holt's\nmanner in that single interview was that he was a moral and political\nenthusiast, who, if he sought to coerce others, would seek to coerce\nthem into a difficult, and perhaps impracticable, scrupulosity.\n\nHarold spoke with as noticeable directness and emphasis, as if what he\nsaid could have no reaction on himself. He had of course not entered\nunnecessarily into what occurred in Jermyn's office. But now he was\nsubjected to a cross-examination on this subject, which gave rise to\nsome subdued shrugs, smiles, and winks, among county gentlemen.\n\nThe questions were directed so as to bring out, if possible, some\nindication that Felix Holt was moved to his remonstrance by personal\nresentment against the political agents concerned in setting on foot the\ntreating at Sproxton, but such questioning is a sort of target-shooting\nthat sometimes hits about widely. The cross-examining counsel had close\nconnections among the Tories of Loamshire, and enjoyed his business\nto-day. Under the fire of various questions about Jermyn and the agent\nemployed by him at Sproxton, Harold got warm, and in one of his replies\nsaid, with rapid sharpness--\n\n\"Mr. Jermyn was my agent then, not now: I have no longer any but hostile\nrelations with him.\"\n\nThe sense that he had shown a slight heat would have vexed Harold more\nif he had not got some satisfaction out of the thought that Jermyn heard\nthose words. He recovered his good temper quickly, and when,\nsubsequently, the question came--\n\n\"You acquiesced in the treating of the Sproxton men, as necessary to the\nefficient working of the reformed constituency?\" Harold replied, with\nquiet fluency--\"Yes; on my return to England, before I put up for North\nLoamshire, I got the best advice from practised agents, both Whig and\nTory. They all agreed as to electioneering measures.\"\n\nThe next witness was Michael Brincey, otherwise Mike Brindle, who gave\nevidence of the sayings and doings of the prisoner among the Sproxton\nmen. Mike declared that Felix went \"uncommon again' drink, and\npitch-and-toss, and quarrelling, and sich,\" and was \"all for schooling\nand bringing up the little chaps\"; but on being cross-examined, he\nadmitted that he \"couldn't give much account\"; that Felix did talk\nagain' idle folks, whether poor or rich, and that most like he meant the\nrich, who had \"a rights to be idle,\" which was what he, Mike, liked\nhimself sometimes, though for the most part he was \"a hard-working\nbutty.\" On being checked for this superfluous allegation of his own\ntheory and practice, Mike became timidly conscious that answering was a\ngreat mystery beyond the reach of a butty's soul, and began to err from\ndefect instead of excess. However, he reasserted that what Felix most\nwanted was, \"to get 'em to set up a school for the little chaps.\"\n\nWith the two succeeding witnesses, who swore to the fact that Felix had\ntried to lead the mob along Hobb's Lane instead of toward the Manor, and\nto the violently threatening character of Tucker's attack on him, the\ncase for the defence was understood to close.\n\nMeanwhile Esther had been looking on and listening with growing misery,\nin the sense that all had not been said which might have been said on\nbehalf of Felix. If it was the jury who were to be acted on, she argued\nto herself, there might have been an impression made on their feelings\nwhich would determine their verdict. Was it not constantly said and seen\nthat juries pronounced Guilty or Not Guilty from sympathy for or against\nthe accused? She was too inexperienced to check her own argument by\nthoroughly representing to herself the course of things: how the counsel\nfor the prosecution would reply, and how the judge would sum up, with\nthe object of cooling down sympathy into deliberation. What she had\npainfully pressing on her inward vision was that the trial was coming to\nan end, and that the voice of right and truth had not been strong\nenough.\n\nWhen a woman feels purely and nobly, that ardor of hers which breaks\nthrough formulas too rigorously urged on men by daily practical needs,\nmakes one of her most precious influences: she is the added impulse that\nshatters the stiffening crust of cautious experience. Her inspired\nignorance gives a sublimity to actions so incongruously simple, that\notherwise they would make men smile. Some of that ardor which has\nflashed out and illuminated all poetry and history was burning to-day in\nthe bosom of sweet Esther Lyon. In this, at least, her woman's lot was\nperfect: that the man she loved was her hero; that her woman's passion\nand her reverence for rarest goodness rushed together in an undivided\ncurrent. And to-day they were making one danger, one terror, one\nirresistible impulse for her heart. Her feelings were growing into a\nnecessity for action, rather than a resolve to act. She could not\nsupport the thought that the trial would come to an end, that sentence\nwould be passed on Felix, and that all the while something had been\nomitted which might have been said for him. There had been no witness to\ntell what had been his behavior and state of mind just before the riot.\nShe must do it. It was possible. There was time. But not too much time.\nAll other agitation became merged in eagerness not to let the moment\nescape. The last witness was being called. Harold Transome had not been\nable to get back to her on leaving the witness-box, but Mr. Lingon was\nclose by her. With firm quickness she said to him--\n\n\"Pray tell the attorney that I have evidence to give for the\nprisoner--lose no time.\"\n\n\"Do you know what you are going to say, my dear?\" said Mr. Lingon,\nlooking at her in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes--I entreat you, for God's sake,\" said Esther, in that low tone of\nurgent beseeching which is equivalent to a cry; and with a look of\nappeal more penetrating still, \"I would rather die than not do it.\"\n\nThe old rector, always leaning to the good-natured view of things, felt\nchiefly that there seemed to be an additional chance for the poor fellow\nwho had got himself into trouble. He disputed no farther, but went to\nthe attorney.\n\nBefore Harold was aware of Esther's intention she was on her way to the\nwitness-box. When she appeared there, it was as if a vibration, quick as\nlight, had gone through the Court and had shaken Felix himself, who had\nhitherto seemed impassive. A sort of a gleam seemed to shoot across his\nface, and any one close to him would have seen that his hand, which lay\non the edge of the dock, trembled.\n\nAt the first moment Harold was startled and alarmed; the next, he felt\ndelight in Esther's beautiful aspect, and in the admiration of the\nCourt. There was no blush on her face: she stood, divested of all\npersonal considerations whether of vanity or shyness. Her clear voice\nsounded as it might have done if she had been making a confession of\nfaith. She began and went on without query or interruption. Every face\nlooked grave and respectful.\n\n\"I am Esther Lyon, the daughter of Mr. Lyon, the Independent minister at\nTreby, who has been one of the witnesses for the prisoner. I know Felix\nHolt well. On the day of the election at Treby, when I had been much\nalarmed by the noises that reached me from the main street, Felix Holt\ncame to call upon me. He knew that my father was away, and he thought\nthat I should be alarmed by the sounds of disturbance. It was about the\nmiddle of the day, and he came to tell me that the disturbance was\nquieted, and that the streets were nearly emptied. But he said he feared\nthat the men would collect again after drinking, and that something\nworse might happen later in the day. And he was in much sadness at this\nthought. He stayed a little while, and then he left me. He was very\nmelancholy. His mind was full of great resolutions that came from his\nkind feeling toward others. It was the last thing he would have done to\njoin in riot or to hurt any man, if he could have helped it. His nature\nis very noble; he is tender-hearted; he could never have had any\nintention that was not brave and good.\"\n\nThere was something so naive and beautiful in this action of Esther's,\nthat it conquered every low or petty suggestion even in the commonest\nminds. The three men in that assembly who knew her best--even her father\nand Felix Holt--felt a thrill of surprise mingling with their\nadmiration. This bright, delicate, beautiful-shaped thing that seemed\nmost like a toy or ornament--some hand had touched the chords, and there\ncame forth music that brought tears. Half a year before, Esther's dread\nof being ridiculous spread over the surface of her life; but the depth\nbelow was sleeping.\n\nHarold Transome was ready to give her his hand and lead her back to her\nplace. When she was there, Felix, for the first time, could not help\nlooking toward her, and their eyes met in one solemn glance.\n\nAfterward Esther found herself unable to listen so as to form any\njudgment on what she heard. The acting out of that strong impulse had\nexhausted every energy. There was a brief pause, filled with a murmur, a\nbuzz, and much coughing. The audience generally felt as if dull weather\nwas setting in again. And under those auspices the counsel for the\nprosecution got up to make his reply. Esther's deed had its effect\nbeyond the momentary one, but the effect was not visible in the rigid\nnecessities of legal procedure. The counsel's duty of restoring all\nunfavorable facts to due prominence in the minds of the jurors, had its\neffect altogether reinforced by the summing-up of the judge. Even the\nbare discernment of facts, much more their arrangement with a view to\ninferences, must carry a bias: human impartiality, whether judicial or\nnot, can hardly escape being more or less loaded. It was not that the\njudge had severe intentions; it was only that he saw with severity. The\nconduct of Felix was not such as inclined him to indulgent\nconsideration, and, in his directions to the jury, that mental attitude\nnecessarily told on the light in which he placed the homicide. Even to\nmany in the Court who were not constrained by judicial duty, it seemed\nthat though this high regard felt for the prisoner by his friends, and\nespecially by a generous-hearted woman, was very pretty, such conduct as\nhis was not the less dangerous and foolish, and assaulting and killing a\nconstable was not the less an offence to be regarded without leniency.\n\nEsther seemed now so tremulous, and looked so ill, that Harold begged\nher to leave the Court with his mother and Mr. Lingon. He would come and\ntell her the issue. But she said, quietly, that she would rather stay;\nshe was only a little overcome by the exertion of speaking. She was\ninwardly resolved to see Felix to the last moment before he left the\nCourt.\n\nThough she could not follow the address of the counsel or the judge, she\nhad a keen ear for what was brief and decisive. She heard the verdict,\n\"Guilty of manslaughter.\" And every word uttered by the judge in\npronouncing sentence fell upon her like an unforgetable sound that would\ncome back in dreaming and in waking. She had her eyes on Felix, and at\nthe words, \"Imprisonment for four years,\" she saw his lip tremble. But\notherwise he stood firm and calm.\n\nEsther gave a start from her seat. Her heart swelled with a horrible\nsensation of pain; but, alarmed lest she should lose her self-command,\nshe grasped Mrs. Transome's hand, getting some strength from that human\ncontact.\n\nEsther saw that Felix had turned. She could no longer see his face.\n\"Yes,\" she said, drawing down her veil, \"let us go.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n    The devil tempts us not--'tis we tempt him,\n    Beckoning his skill with opportunity.\n\n\nThe more permanent effect of Esther's action in the trial was visible in\na meeting which took place the next day in the principal room of the\nWhite Hart of Loamford. To the magistrates and other county gentlemen\nwho were drawn together about noon, some of the necessary impulse might\nhave been lacking but for that stirring of heart in certain\njust-spirited men and good fathers among them, which had been raised to\na high pitch of emotion by Esther's maidenly fervor. Among these one of\nthe foremost was Sir Maximus Debarry, who had come to the assizes with a\nmind, as usual, slightly rebellious under an influence which he never\nultimately resisted--the influence of his son. Philip Debarry himself\nwas detained in London, but in his correspondence with his father he had\nurged him, as well as his uncle Augustus, to keep eyes and interest\nawake on the subject of Felix Holt, whom, from all the knowledge of the\ncase he had been able to obtain, he was inclined to believe peculiarly\nunfortunate rather than guilty. Philip had said he was the more anxious\nthat his family should intervene benevolently in this affair, if it were\npossible, because he understood that Mr. Lyon took the young man's case\nparticularly to heart, and he should always regard himself as obliged to\nthe old preacher. At this superfineness of consideration Sir Maximus had\nvented a few \"pshaws!\" and, in relation to the whole affair, had\ngrumbled that Phil was always setting him to do he didn't know\nwhat--always seeming to turn nothing into something by dint of words\nwhich hadn't so much substance as a mote behind them. Nevertheless he\nwas coerced; and in reality he was willing to do anything fair or\ngood-natured which had a handle that his understanding could lay hold\nof. His brother, the rector, desired to be rigorously just; but he had\ncome to Loamford with a severe opinion concerning Felix, thinking that\nsome sharp punishment might be a wholesome check on the career of a\nyoung man disposed to rely too much on his own crude devices.\n\nBefore the trial commenced, Sir Maximus had naturally been one of those\nwho had observed Esther with curiosity, owing to the report of her\ninheritance, and her probable marriage to his once welcome but now\nexasperating neighbor, Harold Transome; and he had made the emphatic\ncomment--\"A fine girl! something thoroughbred in the look of her. Too\ngood for a Radical; that's all I have to say.\" But during the trial Sir\nMaximus was wrought into a state of sympathetic ardor that needed no\nfanning. As soon as he could take his brother by the buttonhole, he\nsaid--\n\n\"I tell you what, Gus! we must exert ourselves to get a pardon for this\nyoung fellow. Confound it! what's the use of mewing him up for four\nyears? Example? Nonsense. Will there be a man knocked down the less for\nit? That girl made me cry. Depend upon it, whether she's going to marry\nTransome or not, she's been fond of Holt--in her poverty, you know.\nShe's a modest, brave, beautiful woman. I'd ride a steeple-chase, old as\nI am, to gratify her feelings. Hang it! the fellow's a good fellow if\nshe thinks so. And he threw out a fine sneer, I thought, at the Radical\ncandidate. Depend upon it, he's a good fellow at bottom.\"\n\nThe rector had not exactly the same kind of ardor, nor was he open too\nprecisely that process of proof which appeared to have convinced Sir\nMaximus; but he had been so far influenced as to be inclined to unite in\nan effort on the side of mercy, observing also that he \"knew Phil would\nbe on that side.\" And by the co-operation of similar movements in the\nminds of other men whose names were of weight, a meeting had been\ndetermined on to consult about getting up a memorial to the Home\nSecretary on behalf of Felix Holt. His case had never had the sort of\nsignificance that could rouse political partisanship; and such interest\nas was now felt in him was still more unmixed with that inducement. The\ngentlemen who gathered in the room at the White Hart were--not as the\nlarge imagination of the _North_ _Loamshire Herald_ suggested, \"of all\nshades of political opinion,\" but--of as many shades as were to be found\namong the gentlemen of that county.\n\nHarold Transome had been energetically active in bringing about this\nmeeting. Over and above the stings of conscience and a determination to\nact up to the level of all recognized honorableness, he had the powerful\nmotive of desiring to do what would satisfy Esther. His gradually\nheightened perception that she had a strong feeling toward Felix Holt\nhad not made him uneasy. Harold had a conviction that might have seemed\nlike fatuity if it had not been that he saw the effect he produced on\nEsther by the light of his opinions about women in general. The\nconviction was, that Felix Holt could not be his rival in any formidable\nsense. Esther's admiration for this eccentric young man was, he thought,\na moral enthusiasm, a romantic fervor, which was one among those many\nattractions quite novel in his own experience; her distress about the\ntrouble of one who had been a familiar object in her former home, was no\nmore than naturally followed from a tender woman's compassion. The place\nyoung Holt had held in her regard had necessarily changed its relations\nnow that her lot was so widely changed. It is undeniable, that what most\nconduced to the quieting nature of Harold's conclusions was the\ninfluence on his imagination of the more or less detailed reasons that\nFelix Holt was a watchmaker, that his home and dress were of a certain\nquality, that his person and manners--that, in short (for Harold, like\nthe rest of us, had many impressions which saved him the trouble of\ndistinct ideas), Felix Holt was not the sort of a man a woman would be\nin love with when she was wooed by Harold Transome.\n\nThus, he was sufficiently at rest on this point not to be exercising any\npainful self-conquest in acting as the zealous advocate of Felix Holt's\ncause with all persons worth influencing; but it was by no direct\nintercourse between him and Sir Maximus that they found themselves in\nco-operation, for the old baronet would not recognize Harold by more\nthan the faintest bow, and Harold was not a man to expose himself to a\nrebuff. Whatever he in his inmost soul regarded as nothing more than a\nnarrow prejudice, he could defy, not with airs of importance, but with\neasy indifference. He could bear most things good-humoredly where he\nfelt that he had the superiority. The object of the meeting was\ndiscussed, and the memorial agreed upon without any clashing. Mr.\nLingon was gone home, but it was expected that his concurrence and\nsignature would be given, as well as those of other gentlemen who were\nabsent. The business gradually reached that stage at which the\nconcentration of interest ceases--when the attention of all but a few\nwho are more practically concerned drops off and disperses itself in\nprivate chat, and there is no longer any particular reason why everybody\nstays except that everybody is there. The room was rather a long one,\nand invited to a little movement; one gentleman drew another aside to\nspeak in an undertone about Scotch bullocks; another had something to\nsay about the North Loamshire hunt to a friend who was the reverse of\ngood-looking, but who, nevertheless, while listening, showed his\nstrength of mind by giving a severe attention also to his full-length\nreflection in the handsome tall mirror that filled the space between two\nwindows. And in this way the groups were continually shifting.\n\nBut in the meantime there were moving toward this room at the White Hart\nthe footsteps of a person whose presence had not been invited, and who,\nvery far from being drawn thither by the belief that he would be\nwelcome, knew well that his entrance would, to one person at least, be\nbitterly disagreeable. They were the footsteps of Mr. Jermyn, whose\nappearance that morning was not less comely and less carefully tended\nthan usual, but who was suffering the torment of a compressed rage,\nwhich, if not impotent to inflict pain on another, was impotent to avert\nevil from himself. After his interview with Mrs. Transome there had been\nfor some reasons a delay of positive procedures against him by Harold,\nof which delay Jermyn had twice availed himself; first, to seek an\ninterview with Harold, and then to send him a letter. The interview had\nbeen refused; and the letter had been returned, with the statement that\nno communication could take place except through Harold's lawyers. And\nyesterday Johnson had brought Jermyn the information that he would\nquickly hear of the proceedings in Chancery being resumed: the watch\nJohnson kept in town had given him secure knowledge on this head. A\ndoomed animal, with every issue earthed up except that where its enemy\nstands, must, if it has teeth and fierceness, try its one chance without\ndelay. And a man may reach a point in his life in which his impulses are\nnot distinguished from those of a hunted brute by any capability of\nscruples. Our selfishness is so robust and many-clutching, that, well\nencouraged, it easily devours all sustenance away from our poor little\nscruples.\n\nSince Harold would not give Jermyn access to him, that vigorous attorney\nwas resolved to take it. He knew all about the meeting at the White\nHart, and he was going thither with the determination of accosting\nHarold. He thought he knew what he should say, and the tone in which he\nshould say it. It would be a vague intimation, carrying the effect of a\nthreat, which should compel Harold to give him a private interview. To\nany counter-consideration that presented itself in his mind--to anything\nthat an imagined voice might say--the imagined answer arose, \"That's all\nvery fine, but I'm not going to be ruined if I can help it--least of\nall, ruined in that way.\" Shall we call it degeneration or gradual\ndevelopment--this effect of thirty additional winters on the\nsoft-glancing, versifying young Jermyn?\n\nWhen Jermyn entered the room at the White Hart he did not immediately\nsee Harold. The door was at the extremity of the room, and the view was\nobstructed by groups of gentlemen with figures broadened by overcoats.\nHis entrance excited no particular observation: several persons had come\nin late. Only one or two, who knew Jermyn well, were not too much\npreoccupied to have a glancing remembrance of what had been chatted\nabout freely the day before--Harold's irritated reply about his agent,\nfrom the witness box. Receiving and giving a slight nod here and there,\nJermyn pushed his way, looking round keenly, until he saw Harold\nstanding near the other end of the room. The solicitor who had acted for\nFelix was just then speaking to him, but having put a paper into his\nhand turned away; and Harold, standing isolated, though at no great\ndistance from others, bent his eyes on the paper. He looked brilliant\nthat morning; his blood was flowing prosperously. He had come in after a\nride, and was additionally brightened by rapid talk and the excitement\nof seeking to impress himself favorably, or at least powerfully, on the\nminds of neighbors nearer or more remote. He had just that amount of\nflush which indicates that life is more enjoyable than usual; and as he\nstood with his left hand caressing his whisker, and his right holding\nthe paper and his riding-whip, his dark eyes running rapidly along the\nwritten lines, and his lips reposing in a curve of good-humor which had\nmore happiness in it than a smile, all beholders might have seen that\nhis mind was at ease.\n\nJermyn walked quickly and quietly close up to him. The two men were of\nthe same height, and before Harold looked round Jermyn's voice was\nsaying, close to his ear, not in a whisper, but in a hard, incisive,\ndisrespectful and yet not loud tone--\n\n\"Mr. Transome, I must speak to you in private.\"\n\nThe sound jarred through Harold with a sensation all the more\ninsufferable because of the revulsion from the satisfied, almost elated,\nstate in which it had seized him. He started and looked round into\nJermyn's eyes. For an instant, which seemed long, there was no sound\nbetween them, but only angry hatred gathering in the two faces. Harold\nfelt himself going to crush this insolence: Jermyn felt that he had\nwords within him that were fangs to clutch this obstinate strength, and\nwring forth the blood and compel submission. And Jermyn's impulse was\nthe more urgent. He said, in a tone that was rather lower, but yet\nharder and more biting--\n\n\"You will repent else--for your mother's sake.\"\n\nAt that sound, quick as a leaping flame, Harold had struck Jermyn across\nthe face with his whip. The brim of the hat had been a defense. Jermyn,\na powerful man, had instantly thrust out his hand and clutched Harold\nhard by the clothes just below the throat, pushing him slightly so as to\nmake him stagger.\n\nBy this time everybody's attention had been called to this end of the\nroom, but both Jermyn and Harold were beyond being arrested by any\nconsciousness of spectators.\n\n\"Let me go, you scoundrel!\" said Harold, fiercely, \"or I'll be the death\nof you.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said Jermyn, in a grating voice; \"_I am your father_.\"\n\nIn the thrust by which Harold had been made to stagger backward a\nlittle, the two men had got very near the long mirror. They were both\nwhite; both had anger and hatred in their faces; the hands of both were\nupraised. As Harold heard the last terrible words he started at a\nleaping throb that went through him, and in the start turned his eyes\naway from Jermyn's face. He turned them on the same face in the glass\nwith his own beside it, and saw the hated fatherhood reasserted.\n\nThe strong man reeled with a sick faintness. But in the same moment\nJermyn released his hold, and Harold felt himself supported by the arm.\nIt was Sir Maximus Debarry who had taken hold of him.\n\n\"Leave the room, sir!\" the baronet said to Jermyn, in a voice of\nimperious scorn. \"This is a meeting of gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Come, Harold,\" he said, in the old friendly voice, \"come away with\nme.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n    'Tis law as steadfast as the throne of Zeus--\n    Our days are heritors of days gone by.\n\n                                  \u00c3\u0086SCHYLUS: _Agamemnon_.\n\n\nA little after five o'clock that day, Harold arrived at Transome Court.\nAs he was winding along the broad road of the park, some parting gleams\nof the March sun pierced the trees here and there, and threw on the\ngrass a long shadow of himself and the groom riding, and illuminated a\nwindow or two of the home he was approaching. But the bitterness in his\nmind made these sunny gleams almost as odious as an artificial smile. He\nwished he had never come back to this pale English sunshine.\n\nIn the course of his eighteen miles' drive he had made up his mind what\nhe would do. He understood now, as he had never understood before, the\nneglected solitariness of his mother's life, the allusions and\ninnuendoes which had come out during the election. But with a proud\ninsurrection against the hardship of an ignominy which was not of his\nown making, he inwardly said, that if the circumstances of his birth\nwere such as to warrant any man in regarding his character of gentleman\nwith ready suspicion, that character should be the more strongly\nasserted in his conduct. No one should be able to allege with any show\nof proof that he had inherited meanness.\n\nAs he stepped from the carriage and entered the hall, there were the\nvoice and the trotting feet of little Harry as usual, and the rush to\nclasp his father's leg and make his joyful puppy-like noises. Harold\njust touched the boy's head, and then said to Dominic in a weary voice--\n\n\"Take the child away. Ask where my mother is.\"\n\nMrs. Transome, Dominic said, was up-stairs. He had seen her go up after\ncoming in from her walk with Miss Lyon, and she had not come down again.\n\nHarold throwing off his hat and greatcoat, went straight to his mother's\ndressing-room. There was still a hope in his mind. He might be suffering\nsimply from a lie. There is much misery created in the world by mere\nmistake or slander, and he might have been stunned by a lie suggested by\nsuch slander. He rapped at his mother's door.\n\nHer voice said immediately, \"Come in.\"\n\nMrs. Transome was resting in her easy-chair, as she often did between an\nafternoon walk and dinner. She had taken off her walking-dress and\nwrapped herself in a soft dressing-gown. She was neither more nor less\nempty of joy than usual. But when she saw Harold, a dreadful certainty\ntook possession of her. It was as if a long expected letter, with a\nblack seal, had come at last.\n\nHarold's face told her what to fear the more decisively, because she had\nnever before seen it express a man's deep agitation. Since the time of\nits pouting childhood and careless youth she had seen only the confident\nstrength and good-humored imperiousness of maturity. The last five hours\nhad made a change as great as illness makes. Harold looked as if he had\nbeen wrestling, and had had some terrible blow. His eyes had that sunken\nlook which, because it is unusual, seems to intensify expression.\n\nHe looked at his mother as he entered, and her eyes followed him as he\nmoved, till he came and stood in front of her, she looking up at him,\nwith white lips.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, speaking with a distinct slowness, in strange\ncontrast with his habitual manner, \"tell me the truth, that I may know\nhow to act.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then said, \"Who is my father?\"\n\nShe was mute: her lips only trembled. Harold stood silent for a few\nmoments, as if waiting. Then he spoke again.\n\n\"_He_ has said--said it before others--that _he_ is my father.\"\n\nHe looked still at his mother. She seemed as if age were striking her\nwith a sudden wand--as if her trembling face were getting haggard before\nhim. She was mute. But her eyes had not fallen; they looked up in\nhelpless misery at her son.\n\nHer son turned away his eyes from her, and left her. In that moment\nHarold felt hard: he could show no pity. All the pride of his nature\nrebelled against his sonship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n    Nay, falter not--'tis an assured good\n    To seek the noblest--'tis your only good\n    Now you have seen it; for that higher vision\n    Poisons all meaner choice forevermore.\n\n\nThat day Esther dined with old Mr. Transome only. Harold sent word that\nhe was engaged and had already dined, and Mrs. Transome that she was\nfeeling ill. Esther was much disappointed that any tidings Harold might\nhave brought relating to Felix were deferred in this way; and, her\nanxiety making her fearful, she was haunted by the thought that if there\nhad been anything cheering to tell, he would have found time to tell it\nwithout delay. Old Mr. Transome went as usual to his sofa in the library\nto sleep after dinner, and Esther had to seat herself in the small\ndrawing-room, in a well-lit solitude that was unusually dispiriting to\nher. Pretty as this room was, she did not like it. Mrs. Transome's\nfull-length portrait, being the only picture there, urged itself too\nstrongly on her attention: the youthful brilliancy it represented\nsaddened Esther by its inevitable association with what she daily saw\nhad come instead of it--a joyless, embittered age. The sense that Mrs.\nTransome was unhappy, affected Esther more and more deeply as the\ngrowing familiarity which relaxed the efforts of the hostess revealed\nmore and more the threadbare tissue of this majestic lady's life. Even\nthe flowers and the pure sunshine and the sweet waters of Paradise would\nhave been spoiled for a young heart, if the bowered walks had been\nhaunted by an Eve gone gray with bitter memories of an Adam who had\ncomplained. \"The woman----she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\" And\nmany of us know how, even in our childhood, some blank discontented face\non the background of our home has marred our summer mornings. Why was\nit, when the birds were singing, when the fields were a garden, and when\nwe were clasping another little hand just larger than our own, there was\nsomebody who found it hard to smile? Esther had got far beyond that\nchildhood to a time and circumstances when this daily presence of\nelderly dissatisfaction amidst such outward things as she had always\nthought must greatly help to satisfy, awaked, not merely vague\nquestioning emotion, but strong determining thought. And now, in these\nhours since her return from Loamford, her mind was in that state of\nhighly-wrought activity, that large discourse, in which we seem to stand\naloof from our own life--weighing impartially our own temptations and\nthe weak desires that most habitually solicit us. \"I think I am getting\nthat power Felix wished me to have: I shall soon see strong visions,\"\nshe said to herself, with a melancholy smile flitting across her face,\nas she put out her wax lights that she might get rid of the oppressive\nurgency of walls and upholstery and that portrait smiling with deluded\nbrightness, unwitting of the future.\n\nJust then Dominic came to say that Mr. Harold sent his compliments, and\nbegged that she would grant him an interview in his study. He disliked\nthe small drawing-room: if she would oblige him by going to the study at\nonce, he would join her very soon. Esther went, in some wonder and\nanxiety. What she most feared or hoped in these moments related to Felix\nHolt, and it did not occur to her that Harold could have anything\nspecial to say to her that evening on other subjects.\n\nCertainly the study was pleasanter than the small drawing-room. A quiet\nlight shone on nothing but greenness and dark wood, and Dominic had\nplaced a delightful chair for her opposite to his master's, which was\nstill empty. All the little objects of luxury around indicated Harold's\nhabitual occupancy; and as Esther sat opposite all these things along\nwith the empty chair which suggested the coming presence, the\nexpectation of his beseeching homage brought with it an impatience and\nrepugnance which she had never felt before. While these feelings were\nstrongly upon her, the door opened and Harold appeared.\n\nHe had recovered his self-possession since his interview with his\nmother: he had dressed and was perfectly calm. He had been occupied with\nresolute thoughts, determining to do what he knew that perfect honor\ndemanded, let it cost him what it would. It is true he had a tacit hope\nbehind, that it might not cost him what he prized most highly: it is\ntrue he had a glimpse even of reward; but it was not less true that he\nwould have acted as he did without that hope or glimpse. It was the most\nserious moment in Harold Transome's life; for the first time the iron\nhad entered into his soul, and he felt the hard pressure of our common\nlot, the yoke of that mighty resistless destiny laid upon us by the acts\nof other men as well as our own.\n\nWhen Esther looked at him she relented, and felt ashamed of her\ngratuitous impatience. She saw that his mind was in some way burdened.\nBut then immediately sprang the dread that he had to say something\nhopeless about Felix.\n\nThey shook hands in silence, Esther looking at him with anxious\nsurprise. He released her hand, but it did not occur to her to sit down,\nand they both continued standing on the hearth.\n\n\"Don't let me alarm you,\" said Harold, seeing that her face gathered\nsolemnity from his. \"I suppose I carry the marks of a past agitation. It\nrelates entirely to troubles of my own--of my own family. No one beyond\nis involved in them.\"\n\nEsther wondered still more, and felt still more relenting.\n\n\"But,\" said Harold, after a slight pause, and in a voice that was\nweighted with new feeling, \"it involves a difference in my position with\nregard to you; and it is on this point that I wished to speak to you at\nonce. When a man sees what ought to be done, he had better do it\nforthwith. He can't answer for himself to-morrow.\"\n\nWhile Esther continued to look at him, with eyes widened by anxious\nexpectation, Harold turned a little, leaned on the mantelpiece, and\nceased to look at her as he spoke.\n\n\"My feelings drag me another way. I need not tell you that your regard\nhas become very important to me--that if our mutual position had been\ndifferent--that, in short, you must have seen--if it had not seemed to\nbe a matter of worldly interest, I should have told you plainly already\nthat I loved you, and that my happiness could be complete only if you\nwould consent to marry me.\"\n\nEsther felt her heart beginning to beat painfully. Harold's voice and\nwords moved her so much that her own task seemed more difficult than she\nhad before imagined. It seemed as if the silence, unbroken by anything\nbut the clicking of the fire, had been long, before Harold turned round\ntoward her again and said--\n\n\"But to-day I have heard something that affects my own position. I\ncannot tell you what it is. There is no need. It is not any culpability\nof my own. But I have not just the same unsullied name and fame in the\neyes of the world around us, as I believed that I had when I allowed\nmyself to entertain that wish about you. You are very young, entering on\na fresh life with bright prospects--you are worthy of everything that is\nbest. I may be too vain in thinking it was at all necessary; but I take\nthis precaution against myself. I shut myself out from the chance of\ntrying, after to-day, to induce you to accept anything which others may\nregard as specked and stained by any obloquy, however slight.\"\n\nEsther was keenly touched. With a paradoxical longing, such as often\nhappens to us, she wished at that moment that she could have loved this\nman with her whole heart. The tears came into her eyes; she did not\nspeak, but, with an angel's tenderness in her face, she laid her hand on\nhis sleeve. Harold commanded himself strongly and said--\n\n\"What is to be done now is, that we should proceed at once to the\nnecessary legal measures for putting you in possession of your own, and\narranging mutual claims. After that I shall probably leave England.\"\n\nEsther was oppressed by an overpowering difficulty. Her sympathy with\nHarold at this moment was so strong, that it spread itself like a mist\nover all previous thought and resolve. It was impossible now to wound\nhim afresh. With her hand still resting on his arm, she said, timidly--\n\n\"Should you be urged--obliged to go--in any case?\"\n\n\"Not in every case, perhaps,\" Harold said, with an evident movement of\nthe blood toward his face; \"at least not for long, not for always.\"\n\nEsther was conscious of the gleam in his eyes. With terror at herself,\nshe said, in difficult haste, \"I can't speak. I can't say anything\nto-night. A great decision has to be made: I must wait--till to-morrow.\"\n\nShe was moving her hand from his arm, when Harold took it reverentially\nand raised it to his lips. She turned toward her chair, and as he\nreleased her hand she sank down on the seat with a sense that she needed\nthat support. She did not want to go away from Harold yet. All the while\nthere was something she needed to know, and yet she could not bring\nherself to ask it. She must resign herself to depend entirely on his\nrecollection of anything beyond his own immediate trial. She sat\nhelpless under contending sympathies while Harold stood at some distance\nfrom her, feeling more harassed by weariness and uncertainty, now that\nhe had fulfilled his resolve, and was no longer under the excitement of\nactually fulfilling it.\n\nEsther's last words had forbidden his revival of the subject that was\nnecessarily supreme with him. But still she sat there, and his mind,\nbusy as to the probabilities of her feeling, glanced over all she had\ndone and said in the later days of their intercourse. It was this\nretrospect that led him to say at last--\n\n\"You will be glad to hear that we shall get a very powerfully signed\nmemorial to the Home Secretary about young Holt. I think your speaking\nfor him helped a great deal. You made all the men wish what you wished.\"\n\nThis was what Esther had been yearning to hear and dared not ask, as\nwell from respect for Harold's absorption in his own sorrow, as from the\nshrinking that belongs to our dearest need. The intense relief of\nhearing what she longed to hear, affected her whole frame: her color,\nher expression, changed as if she had been suddenly freed from some\ntorturing constraint. But we interpret signs of emotion as we interpret\nother signs--often quite erroneously, unless we have the right key to\nwhat they signify. Harold did not gather that this was what Esther had\nwaited for, or that the change in her indicated more than he had\nexpected her to feel at this allusion to an unusual act which she had\ndone under a strong impulse.\n\nBesides the introduction of a new subject after very momentous words\nhave passed, and are still dwelling on the mind, is necessarily a sort\nof concussion, shaking us into a new adjustment of ourselves.\n\nIt seemed natural that soon afterward Esther put out her hand and said,\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nHarold went to his bedroom on the same level with his study, thinking of\nthe morning with an uncertainty that dipped on the side of hope. This\nsweet woman, for whom he felt a passion newer than any he had expected\nto feel, might possibly make some hard things more bearable--if she\nloved him. If not--well, he had acted so that he could defy anyone to\nsay he was not a gentleman.\n\nEsther went up-stairs to her bedroom, thinking that she should not sleep\nthat night. She set her light on a high stand, and did not touch her\ndress. What she desired to see with undisturbed clearness were things\nnot present: the rest she needed was the rest of a final choice. It was\ndifficult. On each side there was renunciation.\n\nShe drew up her blinds, liking to see the gray sky, where there were\nsome veiled glimmerings of moonlight, and the lines of the forever\nrunning river, and the bending movement of the black trees. She wanted\nthe largeness of the world to help her thought. This young creature, who\ntrod lightly backward and forward, and leaned against the window-frame,\nand shook back her brown curls as she looked at something not visible,\nhad lived hardly more than six months since she saw Felix Holt for the\nfirst time. But life is measured by the rapidity of change, the\nsuccession of influences that modify the being; and Esther had undergone\nsomething little short of an inward revolution. The revolutionary\nstruggle, however, was not quite at an end.\n\nThere was something which she now felt profoundly to be the best thing\nthat life could give her. But--if it was to be had at all--it was not to\nbe had without paying a heavy price for it, such as we must pay for all\nthat is greatly good. A supreme love, a motive that gives a sublime\nrhythm to a woman's life, and exalts habit into partnership with the\nsoul's highest needs, is not to be had where and how she wills: to know\nthat high initiation, she must often tread where it is hard to tread,\nand feel the chill air, and watch through darkness. It is not true that\nlove makes all things easy: it makes us choose what is difficult.\nEsther's previous life had brought her into close acquaintance with many\nnegations, and with many positive ills too, not of the acutely painful,\nbut of the distasteful sort. What if she chose the hardship, and had to\nbear it alone, with no strength to lean upon--no other better self to\nmake a place for trust and joy? Her past experience saved her from\nillusions. She knew the dim life of the back street, the contact with\nsordid vulgarity, the lack of refinement for the senses, the summons to\na daily task; and the gain that was to make that life of privation\nsomething on which she dreaded to turn her back, as if it were\nheaven--the presence and the love of Felix Holt--was only a quivering\nhope, not a certainty. It was not in her woman's nature that the hope\nshould not spring within her and make a strong impulse. She knew that he\nloved her: had he not said how a woman might help a man if she were\nworthy? and if she proved herself worthy? But still there was the dread\nthat after all she might find herself on the stony road alone, and faint\nand be weary. Even with the fulfillment of her hope, she knew that she\npledged herself to meet high demands.\n\nAnd on the other side there was a lot where everything seemed easy--but\nfor the fatal absence of those feelings which, now she had once known\nthem, it seemed nothing less than a fall and degradation to do without.\nWith a terrible prescience which a multitude of impressions during her\nstay at Transome Court had contributed to form, she saw herself in a\nsilken bondage that arrested all motive, and was nothing better than a\nwell-cushioned despair. To be restless amidst ease, to be languid among\nall appliances for pleasure, was a possibility that seemed to haunt the\nrooms of this house, and wander with her under the oaks and elms of the\npark. And Harold Transome's love, no longer a hovering fancy with which\nshe played, but become a serious fact, seemed to threaten her with a\nstifling oppression. The homage of a man may be delightful until he asks\nstraight for love, by which a woman renders homage. Since she and Felix\nhad kissed each other in the prison, she felt as if she had vowed\nherself away, as if memory lay on her lips like a seal of possession.\nYet what had happened that very evening had strengthened her liking for\nHarold, and her care for all that regarded him: it had increased her\nrepugnance to turning him out of anything he had expected to be his, or\nto snatching anything from him on the ground of an arbitrary claim. It\nhad even made her dread, as a coming pain, the task of saying anything\nto him that was not a promise of the utmost comfort under this\nnewly-disclosed trouble of his.\n\nIt was already near midnight, but with these thoughts succeeding and\nreturning in her mind like scenes through which she was living, Esther\nhad a more intense wakefulness than any she had known by day. All had\nbeen stillness hitherto, except the fitful wind outside. But her ears\nnow caught a sound within--slight, but sudden. She moved near her door,\nand heard the sweep of something on the matting outside. It came closer,\nand paused. Then it began again, and seemed to sweep away from her. Then\nit approached, and paused as it had done before. Esther listened,\nwondering. The same thing happened again and again, till she could bear\nit no longer. She opened the door, and in the dim light of the corridor,\nwhere the glass above seemed to make a glimmering sky, she saw Mrs.\nTransome's tall figure pacing slowly, with her cheek upon her hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n    The great question in life is the suffering we cause: and the\n    utmost ingenuity of metaphysics cannot justify the man who has\n    pierced the heart that loved him.\n\n                                                --BENJAMIN CONSTANT.\n\n\nWhen Denner had gone up to her mistress's room to dress her for dinner,\nshe had found her seated just as Harold had found her, only with eyelids\ndrooping and trembling over slowly-rolling tears--nay, with a face in\nwhich every sensitive feature, every muscle, seemed to be quivering with\na silent endurance of some agony.\n\nDenner went and stood by the chair a minute without speaking, only\nlaying her hand gently on Mrs. Transome's. At last she said\nbeseechingly, \"Pray, speak, madam. What has happened?\"\n\n\"The worst, Denner--the worst.\"\n\n\"You are ill. Let me undress you, and put you to bed.\"\n\n\"No, I am not ill. I am not going to die! I shall live--I shall live!\"\n\n\"What may I do?\"\n\n\"Go and say I shall not dine. Then you may come back, if you will.\"\n\nThe patient waiting-woman came back and sat by her mistress in\nmotionless silence, Mrs. Transome would not let her dress be touched,\nand waved away all proffers with a slight movement of her hand. Denner\ndared not even light a candle without being told. At last, when the\nevening was far gone, Mrs. Transome said:\n\n\"Go down, Denner, and find out where Harold is, and come back and tell\nme.\"\n\n\"Shall I ask him to come to you, madam?\"\n\n\"No; don't dare to do it, if you love me. Come back.\"\n\nDenner brought word that Mr. Harold was in his study, and that Miss Lyon\nwas with him. He had not dined, but had sent later to ask Miss Lyon to\ngo into his study.\n\n\"Light the candles and leave me.\"\n\n\"Mayn't I come again?\"\n\n\"No. It may be that my son will come to me.\"\n\n\"Mayn't I sleep on the little bed in your bedroom?\"\n\n\"No, good Denner; I am not ill. You can't help me.\"\n\n\"That's the hardest word of all, madam.\"\n\n\"The time will come--but not now. Kiss me. Now go.\"\n\nThe small quiet old woman obeyed, as she had always done. She shrank\nfrom seeming to claim an equal's share in her mistress's sorrow.\n\nFor two hours Mrs. Transome's mind hung on what was hardly a\nhope--hardly more than the listening for a bare possibility. She began\nto create the sounds that her anguish craved to hear--began to imagine a\nfootfall, and a hand upon the door. Then, checked by continual\ndisappointment, she tried to rouse a truer consciousness by rising from\nher seat and walking to her window, where she saw streaks of light\nmoving and disappearing on the grass, and heard the sound of bolts and\nclosing doors. She hurried away and threw herself into her seat again,\nand buried her head in the deafening down of the cushions. There was no\nsound of comfort to her.\n\nThen her heart cried out within her against the cruelty of this son.\nWhen he turned from her in the first moment, he had not had time to feel\nanything but the blow that had fallen on himself. But afterward--was it\npossible that he should not be touched with a son's pity--was it\npossible that he should not have been visited by some thought of the\nlong years through which she had suffered? The memory of those years\ncame back to her now with a protest against the cruelty that had all\nfallen on _her_. She started up with a new restlessness from this spirit\nof resistance. She was not penitent. She had borne too hard a\npunishment. Always the edge of calamity had fallen on _her_. Who had\nfelt for her? She was desolate. God had no pity, else her son would not\nhave been so hard. What dreary future was there after this dreary past?\nShe, too, looked out into the dim night; but the black boundary of trees\nand the long line of the river seemed only part of the loneliness and\nmonotony of her life.\n\nSuddenly she saw a light on the stone balustrades of the balcony that\nprojected in front of Esther's window, and the flash of a moving candle\nfalling on a shrub below. Esther was still awake and up. What had Harold\ntold her--what had passed between them? Harold was fond of this young\ncreature, who had been always sweet and reverential to her. There was\nmercy in her young heart; she might be a daughter who had no impulse to\npunish and to strike her whom fate had stricken. On the dim loneliness\nbefore her she seemed to see Esther's gentle look; it was possible still\nthat the misery of this night might be broken by some comfort. The proud\nwoman yearned for the caressing pity that must dwell in that young\nbosom. She opened her door gently, but when she had reached Esther's she\nhesitated. She had never yet in her life asked for compassion--had never\nthrown herself in faith on an unproffered love. And she might have gone\non pacing the corridor like an uneasy spirit without a goal, if Esther's\nthought, leaping toward her, had not saved her from the need to ask\nadmission.\n\nMrs. Transome was walking toward the door when it opened. As Esther saw\nthat image of restless misery, it blent itself by a rapid flash with all\nthat Harold had said in the evening. She divined that the son's new\ntrouble must be one with the mother's long sadness. But there was no\nwaiting. In an instant Mrs. Transome felt Esther's arm round her neck,\nand a voice saying softly--\n\n\"Oh, why didn't you call me before?\"\n\nThey turned hand and hand into the room, and sat down on a sofa at the\nfoot of the bed. The disordered gray hair--the haggard face--the\nreddened eyelids under which the tears seemed to be coming again with\npain, pierced Esther to the heart. A passionate desire to soothe this\nsuffering woman came over her. She clung round her again, and kissed her\npoor quivering lips and eyelids, and laid her young cheek against the\npale and haggard one. Words could not be quick or strong enough to utter\nher yearning. As Mrs. Transome felt that soft clinging, she said--\n\n\"God has some pity on me.\"\n\n\"Rest on my bed,\" said Esther. \"You are so tired. I will cover you up\nwarmly, and then you will sleep.\"\n\n\"No--tell me, dear--tell me what Harold said.\"\n\n\"That he has had some new trouble.\"\n\n\"He said nothing hard about me?\"\n\n\"No--nothing. He did not mention you.\"\n\n\"I have been an unhappy woman, dear.\"\n\n\"I feared it,\" said Esther, pressing her gently.\n\n\"Men are selfish. They are selfish and cruel. What they care for is\ntheir own pleasure and their own pride.\"\n\n\"Not all,\" said Esther, on whom these words fell with a painful jar.\n\n\"All I have ever loved,\" said Mrs. Transome. She paused a moment or two,\nand then said, \"For more than twenty years I have not had an hour's\nhappiness. Harold knows it, and yet he is hard to me.\"\n\n\"He will not be. To-morrow he will not be. I am sure he will be good,\"\nsaid Esther, pleadingly. \"Remember--he said to me his trouble was\nnew--he has not had time.\"\n\n\"It is too hard to bear, dear,\" Mrs. Transome said, a new sob rising as\nshe clung fast to Esther in return. \"I am old, and expect so little\nnow--a very little thing would seem great. Why should I be punished any\nmore?\"\n\nEsther found it difficult to speak. The dimly-suggested tragedy of this\nwoman's life, the dreary waste of years empty of sweet trust and\naffection, afflicted her even to horror. It seemed to have come as a\nlast vision to urge her toward the life where the draughts of joy sprang\nfrom the unchanging fountains of reverence and devout love.\n\nBut all the more she longed to still the pain of this heart that beat\nagainst hers.\n\n\"Do let me go to your own room with you, and let me undress you, and let\nme tend upon you,\" she said, with a woman's gentle instinct. \"It will be\na very great thing to me. I shall seem to have a mother again. Do let\nme.\"\n\nMrs. Transome yielded at last, and let Esther soothe her with a\ndaughter's tendance. She was undressed and went to bed; and at last\ndozed fitfully, with frequent starts. But Esther watched by her till the\nchills of morning came, and then she only wrapped more warmth around\nher, and slept fast in the chair till Denner's movement in the room\nroused her. She started out of a dream in which she was telling Felix\nwhat had happened to her that night.\n\nMrs. Transome was now in the sounder morning sleep which sometimes\ncomes after a long night of misery. Esther beckoned Denner into the\ndressing-room, and said:\n\n\"It is late, Mrs. Hickes. Do you think Mr. Harold is out of his room?\"\n\n\"Yes, a long while; he was out earlier than usual.\"\n\n\"Will you ask him to come up here? Say I begged you.\"\n\nWhen Harold entered Esther was leaning against the back of the empty\nchair where yesterday he had seen his mother sitting. He was in a state\nof wonder and suspense, and when Esther approached him and gave him her\nhand, he said, in a startled way--\n\n\"Good God! how ill you look! Have you been sitting up with my mother?\"\n\n\"Yes. She is asleep now,\" said Esther. They had merely pressed hands by\nway of greeting, and now stood apart looking at each other solemnly.\n\n\"Has she told you anything?\" said Harold.\n\n\"No, only that she is wretched. Oh, I think I would bear a great deal of\nunhappiness to save her from having any more.\"\n\nA painful thrill passed through Harold, and showed itself in his face\nwith that pale rapid flash which can never be painted. Esther pressed\nher hands together, and said, timidly, though it was from an urgent\nprompting--\n\n\"There is nothing in all this place--nothing since ever I came here--I\ncould care for so much as that you should sit down by her now, and that\nshe should see you when she wakes.\"\n\nThen with delicate instinct, she added, just laying her hand on his\nsleeve, \"I know you would have come. I know you meant it. But she is\nasleep now. Go gently before she wakes.\"\n\nHarold just laid his right hand for an instant on the back of Esther's\nas it rested on his sleeve, and then stepped softly to his mother's\nbedside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour afterward, when Harold had laid his mother's pillow afresh, and\nsat down again by her, she said--\n\n\"If that dear thing will marry you, Harold, it will make up to you for a\ngreat deal.\"\n\nBut before the day closed Harold knew that this was not to be. That\nyoung presence, which had flitted like a white new-winged dove over all\nthe saddening relics and new finery of Transome Court, could not find\nits home there. Harold heard from Esther's lips that she loved some one\nelse, and that she resigned all claim to the Transome estates. She\nwished to go back to her father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n    The maiden said, I wis the londe\n      Is very fair to see,\n    But my true-love that is in bonde\n      Is fairer still to me.\n\n\nOne April day, when the sun shone on the lingering raindrops, Lyddy was\ngone out, and Esther chose to sit in the kitchen, in the wicker-chair\nagainst the white table, between the fire and the window. The kettle was\nsinging, and the clock was ticking steadily toward four o'clock.\n\nShe was not reading, but stitching; and as her fingers moved nimbly,\nsomething played about her parted lips like a ray. Suddenly she laid\ndown her work, pressed her hands together on her knees, and bent forward\na little. The next moment there came a loud rap at the door. She started\nup and opened it, but kept herself hidden behind it.\n\n\"Mr. Lyon at home?\" said Felix, in his firm tones.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Esther from behind her screen; \"but Miss Lyon is, if\nyou'll please to walk in.\"\n\n\"Esther!\" exclaimed Felix, amazed.\n\nThey held each other by both hands, and looked into each other's faces\nwith delight.\n\n\"You are out of prison?\"\n\n\"Yes, till I do something bad again. But you?--how is it all?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is,\" said Esther, smiling brightly as she moved toward the\nwicker chair, and seated herself again, \"that everything is as usual: my\nfather is gone to see the sick; Lyddy is gone in deep despondency to buy\nthe grocery; and I am sitting here, with some vanity in me, needing to\nbe scolded.\"\n\nFelix had seated himself on a chair that happened to be near her, at the\ncorner of the table. He looked at her still with questioning eyes--he\ngrave, she mischievously smiling.\n\n\"Are you come back to live here then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are not going to be married to Harold Transome, or to be rich?\"\n\n\"No.\" Something made Esther take up her work again, and begin to stitch.\nThe smiles were dying into a tremor.\n\n\"Why?\" said Felix, in rather a low tone, leaning his elbow on the table,\nand resting his head on his hand while he looked at her.\n\n\"I did not wish to marry him, or to be rich.\"\n\n\"You have given it all up?\" said Felix, leaning forward a little, and\nspeaking in a still lower tone. Esther did not speak. They heard the\nkettle singing and the clock loudly ticking. There was no knowing how it\nwas: Esther's work fell, their eyes met; and the next instant their arms\nwere round each other's necks, and once more they kissed each other.\n\nWhen their hands fell again, their eyes were bright with tears. Felix\nlaid his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"Could you share the life of a poor man, then, Esther?\"\n\n\"If I thought well enough of him,\" she said, the smile coming again,\nwith the pretty saucy movement of her head.\n\n\"Have you considered well what it would be?--that it would be a very\nbare and simple life?\"\n\n\"Yes--without atta of rose.\"\n\nFelix suddenly removed his hand from her shoulder, rose from his chair,\nand walked a step or two; then he turned round and said, with deep\ngravity--\n\n\"And the people I shall live among, Esther? They have not just the same\nfollies and vices as the rich, but they have their own forms of folly\nand vice; and they have not what are called the refinements of the rich\nto make their faults more bearable. I don't say more bearable to me--I'm\nnot fond of those refinements; but you are.\"\n\nFelix paused an instant, and then added--\n\n\"It is very serious, Esther.\"\n\n\"I know it is serious,\" said Esther, looking up at him. \"Since I have\nbeen at Transome Court I have seen many things very seriously. If I had\nnot, I should not have left what I did leave. I made a deliberate\nchoice.\"\n\nFelix stood a moment or two, dwelling on her with a face where the\ngravity gathered tenderness.\n\n\"And these curls?\" he said, with a sort of relenting, seating himself\nagain, and putting his hand on them.\n\n\"They cost nothing--they are natural.\"\n\n\"You are such a delicate creature.\"\n\n\"I am very healthy. Poor women, I think, are healthier than the rich.\nBesides,\" Esther went on, with a mischievous meaning, \"I think of having\nsome wealth.\"\n\n\"How?\" said Felix, with an anxious start. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I think even of two pounds a week: one needn't live up to the splendor\nof all that, you know; we might live as simply as you liked: there would\nbe money to spare, and you could do wonders, and be obliged to work too,\nonly not if sickness came. And then I think of a little income for your\nmother, enough for her to live as she has been used to live; and a\nlittle income for my father, to save him from being dependent when he is\nno longer able to preach.\"\n\nEsther said all this in a playful tone, but she ended, with a grave look\nof appealing submission----\n\n\"I mean--if you approve. I wish to do what you think it will be right to\ndo.\"\n\nFelix put his hand on her shoulder again and reflected a little while,\nlooking on the hearth: then he said, lifting up his eyes, with a smile\nat her----\n\n\"Why, I shall be able to set up a great library, and lend the books to\nbe dog's-eared and marked with bread-crumbs.\"\n\nEsther said, laughing, \"You think you are to be everything. You don't\nknow how clever I am. I mean to go on teaching a great many things.\"\n\n\"Teaching me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said, with a little toss; \"I shall improve your French\naccent.\"\n\n\"You won't want me to wear a stock,\" said Felix, with a defiant shake of\nthe head.\n\n\"No; and you will not attribute stupid thoughts to me before I've\nuttered them.\"\n\nThey laughed merrily, each holding the other's arms, like girl and boy.\nThere was the ineffable sense of youth in common.\n\nThen Felix leaned forward, that their lips might meet again, and after\nthat his eyes roved tenderly over her face and curls.\n\n\"I'm a rough, severe fellow, Esther. Shall you never repent?--never be\ninwardly reproaching me that I was not a man who could have shared your\nwealth? Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure!\" said Esther, shaking her head; \"for then I should have\nhonored you less. I am weak--my husband must be greater and nobler than\nI am.\"\n\n\"Oh, I tell you what, though!\" said Felix, starting up, thrusting his\nhands into his pockets, and creasing his brow playfully, \"if you take me\nin that way I shall be forced to be a much better fellow than I ever\nthought of being.\"\n\n\"I call that retribution,\" said Esther, with a laugh as sweet as the\nmorning thrush.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n    Our finest hope is finest memory;\n    And those who love in age think youth is happy,\n    Because it has a life to fill with love.\n\n\nThe very next May, Felix and Esther were married. Every one in those\ndays was married at the parish church; but Mr. Lyon was not satisfied\nwithout an additional private solemnity, \"wherein there was no bondage\nto questionable forms, so that he might have a more enlarged utterance\nof joy and supplication.\"\n\nIt was a very simple wedding; but no wedding, even the gayest, ever\nraised so much interest and debate in Treby Magna. Even very great\npeople, like Sir Maximus and his family, went to the church to look at\nthis bride, who had renounced wealth, and chosen to be the wife of a man\nwho said he would always be poor.\n\nSome few shook their heads; could not quite believe it; and thought\nthere was \"more behind.\" But the majority of honest Trebians were\naffected somewhat in the same way as happy-looking Mr. Wace was, who\nobserved to his wife, as they walked from under the churchyard\nchestnuts, \"It's wonderful how things go through you--you don't know\nhow. I feel somehow as if I believed more in everything that's good.\"\n\nMrs. Holt, that day, said she felt herself to be receiving \"some\nreward,\" implying that justice certainly had much more in reserve.\nLittle Job Tudge had an entirely new suit, of which he fingered every\nseparate brass button in a way that threatened an arithmetical mania;\nand Mrs. Holt had out her best tea-trays and put down her carpet again,\nwith the satisfaction of thinking that there would no more be boys\ncoming in all weathers with dirty shoes.\n\nFor Felix and Esther did not take up their abode in Treby Magna; and\nafter a while Mr. Lyon left the town too, and joined them where they\ndwelt. On his resignation the church in Malthouse Yard chose a successor\nto him whose doctrine was rather higher.\n\nThere were other departures from Treby. Mr. Jermyn's establishment was\nbroken up, and he was understood to have gone to reside at a great\ndistance: some said \"abroad,\" that large home of ruined reputations. Mr.\nJohnson continued blonde and sufficiently prosperous till he got gray\nand rather more prosperous. Some persons who did not think highly of\nhim, held that his prosperity was a fact to be kept in the background,\nas being dangerous to the morals of the young; judging that it was not\naltogether creditable to the Divine Providence that anything but virtue\nshould be rewarded by a front and back drawing-room in Bedford Row.\n\nAs for Mr. Christian, he had no more profitable secrets at his disposal.\nBut he got his thousand pounds from Harold Transome.\n\nThe Transome family were absent some time from Transome Court. The place\nwas kept up and shown to visitors, but not by Denner, who was away with\nher mistress. After a while the family came back, and Mrs. Transome died\nthere. Sir Maximus was at her funeral, and throughout that neighborhood\nthere was silence about the past.\n\nUncle Lingon continued to watch over the shooting on the Manor and the\ncovers until that event occurred which he had predicted as a part of\nChurch reform sure to come. Little Treby had a new rector, but others\nwere sorry besides the old pointers.\n\nAs to all that wide parish of Treby Magna, it has since prospered as the\nrest of England has prospered. Doubtless there is more enlightenment\nnow. Whether the farmers are all public-spirited, the shopkeepers nobly\nindependent, the Sproxton men entirely sober and judicious, the\nDissenters quite without narrowness or asperity in religion and\npolitics, and the publicans all fit, like Gaius, to be the friends of an\napostle--these things I have not heard; not having correspondence in\nthose parts. Whether any presumption may be drawn from the fact that\nNorth Loamshire does not yet return a Radical candidate, I leave to the\nall-wise--I mean the newspapers.\n\nAs to the town in which Felix Holt now resides, I will keep that a\nsecret, lest he should be troubled by any visitor having the\ninsufferable motive of curiosity.\n\nI will only say that Esther has never repented. Felix, however, grumbles\na little that she has made his life too easy, and that, if it were not\nfor much walking, he should be a sleek dog.\n\nThere is a young Felix, who has a great deal more science than his\nfather, but not much more money.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTranscriber's notes:\n\n  P.  13.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1382,"split":"test"}
