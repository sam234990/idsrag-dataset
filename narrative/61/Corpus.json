Rabina despises her new husband because he falls short of her extreme religious beliefs, his love of dancing and penchant for drinking alcohol. She initially flees him but her father forces her back, and they live separately in the one house. Rabina gives birth to two sons. The first, George, is indisputably the son of the Laird, but it is strongly implied\u00a0\u2013 though never confirmed\u00a0\u2013 that her second son, Robert, was fathered by the Reverend Wringhim, Rabina\u2019s spiritual adviser and close confidante.\nGeorge, raised by the Laird, becomes a popular young man who enjoys sport and the company of his friends. Robert, educated by his mother and adoptive father Wringhim, is brought up to follow Wringhim\u2019s radical antinomian sect of Calvinism, which holds that only certain elect people are predestined to be saved by God. These chosen few will have a heavenly reward regardless of how their lives are lived.\nThe two brothers meet, as young men, in Edinburgh where Robert starts following George through the town, mocking and provoking him and disrupting his life. He appears to have the ability of appearing wherever George is. When on a hill-top, George sees a vision of his brother in the sky and turns to find him behind him, preparing to throw him off a cliff. Robert rejects any friendly or placatory advances from his brother.\nFinally, George is murdered by being stabbed in the back, apparently during a duel with one of his drinking acquaintances. The only witnesses to the murder were a prostitute and her despicable client, who claim that the culprit was Robert, aided by what appears to be the double of George\u2019s friend. Before Robert can be arrested, he disappears.\nThe second part of the novel consists of Robert's account of his life. It purports to be a document, part-handwritten and part-printed, which was found after his death. It recounts his childhood, under the influence of the Rev Wringhim, and goes on to explain how he becomes in thrall to an enigmatic companion who says his name is Gil-Martin. This stranger, who could be seen to be the Devil, appears after Wringhim has declared Robert to be a member of 'the elect' and so predestined to eternal salvation. Gil-Martin, who is able to transform his appearance at will, soon directs all of Robert\u2019s pre-existing tendencies and beliefs to evil purposes, convincing him that it is his mission to \u201ccut sinners off with the sword\u201d, and that murder can be the correct course of action. From Gil-Martin's boasting of the number of his adherents and size of his dominions, Robert falls into the delusion that he is Peter the Great of Russia, who visited England about that time.\nThe confession traces Robert's gradual decline into despair and madness, as his doubts about the righteousness of his cause are counteracted by Gil-Martin\u2019s increasing domination over his life. Finally, Robert loses control over his own identity and even loses track of time. During these lost weeks and months, it is suggested that Gil-Martin assumes Robert\u2019s appearance in order to commit further crimes. However, there are also suggestions in the text, that 'Gil-Martin' is a figment of Robert's imagination, and is simply an aspect of his own personality: as, for example when 'the sinner' writes, 'I feel as if I were the same person' (as Gil-Martin).\nRobert flees, but is pursued and tormented by devils and can find refuge only as a shepherd. Finally he hangs himself with a grass rope\u00a0\u2013 in which it is suggested that he is aided by devils.\nThe novel concludes with a return to the 'Editor's Narrative' which explains how the sinner's memoir was discovered in his grave. Hogg appears as himself in this section, expressing scorn of the project to open the grave.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a\nJustified Sinner, by James Hogg\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

That family was supposed to have been a branch of the\nancient family of Colquhoun, and it is certain that from it spring the\nCowans that spread towards the Border. I find that, in the year 1687,\nGeorge Colwan succeeded his uncle of the same name, in the lands of\nDalchastel and Balgrennan; and, this being all I can gather of the\nfamily from history, to tradition I must appeal for the remainder of\nthe motley adventures of that house. But, of the matter furnished by\nthe latter of these powerful monitors, I have no reason to complain: It\nhas been handed down to the world in unlimited abundance; and I am\ncertain that, in recording the hideous events which follow, I am only\nrelating to the greater part of the inhabitants of at least four\ncounties of Scotland matters of which they were before perfectly well\ninformed.\n\nThis George was a rich man, or supposed to be so, and was married, when\nconsiderably advanced in life, to the sole heiress and reputed daughter\nof a Baillie Orde, of Glasgow. This proved a conjunction anything but\nagreeable to the parties contracting. It is well known that the\nReformation principles had long before that time taken a powerful hold\nof the hearts and affections of the people of Scotland, although the\nfeeling was by no means general, or in equal degrees; and it so\nhappened that this married couple felt completely at variance on the\nsubject. Granting it to have been so, one would have thought that the\nlaird, owing to his retiring situation, would have been the one that\ninclined to the stern doctrines of the reformers; and that the young\nand gay dame from the city would have adhered to the free principles\ncherished by the court party, and indulged in rather to extremity, in\nopposition to their severe and carping contemporaries.\n\nThe contrary, however, happened to be the case. The laird was what his\ncountry neighbours called \"a droll, careless chap\", with a very limited\nproportion of the fear of God in his heart, and very nearly as little\nof the fear of man. The laird had not intentionally wronged or offended\neither of the parties, and perceived not the necessity of deprecating\ntheir vengeance. He had hitherto believed that he was living in most\ncordial terms with the greater part of the inhabitants of the earth,\nand with the powers above in particular: but woe be unto him if he was\nnot soon convinced of the fallacy of such damning security! for his\nlady was the most severe and gloomy of all bigots to the principles of\nthe Reformation. Hers were not the tenets of the great reformers, but\ntheirs mightily overstrained and deformed. Theirs was an unguent hard\nto be swallowed; but hers was that unguent embittered and overheated\nuntil nature could not longer bear it. She had imbibed her ideas from\nthe doctrines of one flaming predestinarian divine alone; and these\nwere so rigid that they became a stumbling block to many of his\nbrethren, and a mighty handle for the enemies of his party to turn the\nmachine of the state against them.\n\nThe wedding festivities at Dalcastle partook of all the gaiety, not of\nthat stern age, but of one previous to it. There was feasting, dancing,\npiping, and singing: the liquors were handed, around in great fulness,\nthe ale in large wooden bickers, and the brandy in capacious horns of\noxen. The laird gave full scope to his homely glee. He danced--he\nsnapped his fingers to the music--clapped his hands and shouted at the\nturn of the tune. He saluted every girl in the hall whose appearance\nwas anything tolerable, and requested of their sweethearts to take the\nsame freedom with his bride, by way of retaliation. But there she sat\nat the head of the hall in still and blooming beauty, absolutely\nrefusing to tread a single measure with any gentleman there. The only\nenjoyment in which she appeared to partake was in now and then stealing\na word of sweet conversation with her favourite pastor about divine\nthings; for he had accompanied her home after marrying her to her\nhusband, to see her fairly settled in her new dwelling. He addressed\nher several times by her new name, Mrs. Colwan; but she turned away her\nhead disgusted, and looked with pity and contempt towards the old\ninadvertent sinner, capering away in the height of his unregenerated\nmirth. The minister perceived the workings of her pious mind, and\nthenceforward addressed her by the courteous title of Lady Dalcastle,\nwhich sounded somewhat better, as not coupling her name with one of the\nwicked: and there is too great reason to believe that, for all the\nsolemn vows she had come under, and these were of no ordinary binding,\nparticularly on the laird's part, she at that time despised, if not\nabhorred him, in her heart.\n\nThe good parson again blessed her, and went away. She took leave of him\nwith tears in her eyes, entreating him often to visit her in that\nheathen land of the Amorite, the Hittite, and the Girgashite: to which\nhe assented, on many solemn and qualifying conditions--and then the\ncomely bride retired to her chamber to pray.\n\nIt was customary, in those days, for the bride's-man and maiden, and a\nfew select friends, to visit the new-married couple after they had\nretired to rest, and drink a cup to their healths, their happiness, and\na numerous posterity. But the laird delighted not in this: he wished to\nhave his jewel to himself; and, slipping away quietly from his jovial\nparty, he retired to his chamber to his beloved, and bolted the door.\nHe found her engaged with the writings of the Evangelists, and terribly\ndemure. The laird went up to caress her; but she turned away her head,\nand spoke of the follies of aged men, and something of the broad way\nthat leadeth to destruction. The laird did not thoroughly comprehend\nthis allusion; but being considerably flustered by drinking, and\ndisposed to take all in good part, he only remarked, as he took off his\nshoes and stockings, that, \"whether the way was broad or narrow, it was\ntime that they were in their bed.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Colwan, you won't go to bed to-night, at such an important\nperiod of your life, without first saying prayers for yourself and me.\"\n\nWhen she said this, the laird had his head down almost to the ground,\nloosing his shoe-buckle; but when he heard of prayers, on such a night,\nhe raised his face suddenly up, which was all over as flushed and red\nas a rose, and answered:\n\n\"Prayers, Mistress! Lord help your crazed head, is this a night for\nprayers?\"\n\nHe had better have held his peace. There was such a torrent of profound\ndivinity poured out upon him that the laird became ashamed, both of\nhimself and his new-made spouse, and wist not what to say: but the\nbrandy helped him out.\n\n\"It strikes me, my dear, that religious devotion would be somewhat out\nof place to-night,\" said he. \"Allowing that it is ever so beautiful,\nand ever so beneficial, were we to ride on the rigging of it at all\ntimes, would we not be constantly making a farce of it: It would be\nlike reading the Bible and the jestbook, verse about, and would render\nthe life of man a medley of absurdity and confusion.\"\n\nBut, against the cant of the bigot or the hypocrite, no reasoning can\naught avail. If you would argue until the end of life, the infallible\ncreature must alone be right. So it proved with the laird. One\nScripture text followed another, not in the least connected, and one\nsentence of the profound Mr. Wringhim's sermons after another, proving\nthe duty of family worship, till the laird lost patience, and tossing\nhimself into bed, said carelessly that he would leave that duty upon\nher shoulders for one night.\n\nThe meek mind of Lady Dalcastle was somewhat disarranged by this sudden\nevolution. She felt that she was left rather in an awkward situation.\nHowever, to show her unconscionable spouse that she was resolved to\nhold fast her integrity, she kneeled down and prayed in terms so potent\nthat she deemed she was sure of making an impression on him. She did\nso; for in a short time the laird began to utter a response so fervent\nthat she was utterly astounded, and fairly driven from the chain of her\norisons. He began, in truth, to sound a nasal bugle of no ordinary\ncalibre--the notes being little inferior to those of a military\ntrumpet. The lady tried to proceed, but every returning note from the\nbed burst on her ear with a louder twang, and a longer peal, till the\nconcord of sweet sounds became so truly pathetic that the meek spirit\nof the dame was quite overcome; and, after shedding a flood of tears,\nshe arose from her knees, and retired to the chimney-corner with her\nBible in her lap, there to spend the hours in holy meditation till such\ntime as the inebriated trumpeter should awaken to a sense of propriety.\n\nThe laird did not awake in any reasonable time; for, he being overcome\nwith fatigue and wassail, his sleep became sounder, and his Morphean\nmeasures more intense. These varied a little in their structure; but\nthe general run of the bars sounded something in this way:\n\"Hic-hoc-wheew!\" It was most profoundly ludicrous; and could not have\nmissed exciting risibility in anyone save a pious, a disappointed, and\nhumbled bride.\n\nThe good dame wept bitterly. She could not for her life go and awaken\nthe monster, and request him to make room for her: but she retired\nsomewhere, for the laird, on awaking next morning, found that he was\nstill lying alone. His sleep had been of the deepest and most genuine\nsort; and, all the time that it lasted, he had never once thought of\neither wives, children, or sweethearts, save in the way of dreaming\nabout them; but, as his spirit began again by slow degrees to verge\ntowards the boundaries of reason, it became lighter and more buoyant\nfrom the effects of deep repose, and his dreams partook of that\nbuoyancy, yea, to a degree hardly expressible. He dreamed of the reel,\nthe jig, the strathspey, and the corant; and the elasticity of his\nframe was such that he was bounding over the heads of maidens, and\nmaking his feet skimmer against the ceiling, enjoying, the while, the\nmost ecstatic emotions. These grew too fervent for the shackles of the\ndrowsy god to restrain. The nasal bugle ceased its prolonged sounds in\none moment, and a sort of hectic laugh took its place. \"Keep it\ngoing--play up, you devils!\" cried the laird, without changing his\nposition on the pillow. But this exertion to hold the fiddlers at their\nwork fairly awakened the delighted dreamer, and, though he could not\nrefrain from continuing, his laugh, beat length, by tracing out a\nregular chain of facts, came to be sensible of his real situation.\n\"Rabina, where are you? What's become of you, my dear?\" cried the\nlaird. But there was no voice nor anyone that answered or regarded. He\nflung open the curtains, thinking to find her still on her knees, as he\nhad seen her, but she was not there, either sleeping or waking.\n\"Rabina! Mrs. Colwan!\" shouted he, as loud as he could call, and then\nadded in the same breath, \"God save the king--I have lost my wife!\"\n\nHe sprung up and opened the casement: the day-light was beginning to\nstreak the east, for it was spring, and the nights were short, and the\nmornings very long. The laird half dressed himself in an instant, and\nstrode through every room in the house, opening the windows as he went,\nand scrutinizing every bed and every corner. He came into the hall\nwhere the wedding festival had been held; and as he opened the various\nwindowboards, loving couples flew off like hares surprised too late in\nthe morning among the early braird. \"Hoo-boo! Fie, be frightened!\"\ncried the laird. \"Fie, rin like fools, as if ye were caught in an\nill-turn!\" His bride was not among them; so he was obliged to betake\nhimself to further search. \"She will be praying in some corner, poor\nwoman,\" said he to himself. \"It is an unlucky thing this praying. But,\nfor my part, I fear I have behaved very ill; and I must endeavour to\nmake amends.\"\n\nThe laird continued his search, and at length found his beloved in the\nsame bed with her Glasgow cousin who had acted as bridesmaid. \"You sly\nand malevolent imp,\" said the laird; \"you have played me such a trick\nwhen I was fast asleep! I have not known a frolic so clever, and, at\nthe same time, so severe. Come along, you baggage you!\"\n\n\"Sir, I will let you know that I detest your principles and your person\nalike,\" said she. \"It shall never be said, Sir, that my person was at\nthe control of a heathenish man of Belial--a dangler among the\ndaughters of women--a promiscuous dancer--and a player of unlawful\ngames. Forgo your rudeness, Sir, I say, and depart away from my\npresence and that of my kinswoman.\"\n\n\"Come along, I say, my charming Rab. If you were the pink of all\npuritans, and the saint of all saints, you are my wife, and must do as\nI command you.\"\n\n\"Sir, I will sooner lay down my life than be subjected to your godless\nwill; therefore I say, desist, and begone with you.\"\n\nBut the laird regarded none of these testy sayings: he rolled her in a\nblanket, and bore her triumphantly away to his chamber, taking care to\nkeep a fold or two of the blanket always rather near to her mouth, in\ncase of any outrageous forthcoming of noise.\n\nThe next day at breakfast the bride was long in making her appearance.\nHer maid asked to see her; but George did not choose that anybody\nshould see her but himself. He paid her several visits, and always\nturned the key as he came out. At length breakfast was served; and\nduring the time of refreshment the laird tried to break several jokes;\nbut it was remarked that they wanted their accustomed brilliancy, and\nthat his nose was particularly red at the top.\n\nMatters, without all doubt, had been very bad between the new-married\ncouple; for in the course of the day the lady deserted her quarters,\nand returned to her father's house in Glasgow, after having been a\nnight on the road; stage-coaches and steam-boats having then no\nexistence in that quarter.\n\nThough Baillie Orde had acquiesced in his wife's asseveration regarding\nthe likeness of their only daughter to her father, he never loved or\nadmired her greatly; therefore this behaviour nothing astounded him. He\nquestioned her strictly as to the grievous offence committed against\nher, and could discover nothing that warranted a procedure so fraught\nwith disagreeable consequences. So, after mature deliberation, the\nbaillie addressed her as follows:\n\n\"Aye, aye, Raby! An' sae I find that Dalcastle has actually refused to\nsay prayers with you when you ordered him; an' has guidit you in a rude\nindelicate manner, outstepping the respect due to my daughter--as my\ndaughter. But, wi' regard to what is due to his own wife, of that he's\na better judge nor me. However, since he has behaved in that manner to\nMY DAUGHTER, I shall be revenged on him for aince; for I shall return\nthe obligation to ane nearer to him: that is, I shall take pennyworths\nof his wife--an' let him lick at that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Sir?\" said the astonished damsel.\n\n\"I mean to be revenged on that villain Dalcastle,\" said he, \"for what\nhe has done to my daughter. Come hither, Mrs. Colwan, you shall pay for\nthis.\"\n\nSo saying, the baillie began to inflict corporal punishment on the\nrunaway wife. His strokes were not indeed very deadly, but he made a\nmighty flourish in the infliction, pretending to be in a great rage\nonly at the Laird of Dalcastle. \"Villain that he is!\" exclaimed he, \"I\nshall teach him to behave in such a manner to a child of mine, be she\nas she may; since I cannot get at himself, I shall lounder her that is\nnearest to him in life. Take you that, and that, Mrs. Colwan, for your\nhusband's impertinence!\"\n\nThe poor afflicted woman wept and prayed, but the baillie would not\nabate aught of his severity. After fuming and beating her with many\nstripes, far drawn, and lightly laid down, he took her up to her\nchamber, five stories high, locked her in, and there he fed her on\nbread and water, all to be revenged on the presumptuous Laird of\nDalcastle; but ever and anon, as the baillie came down the stair from\ncarrying his daughter's meal, he said to himself: \"I shall make the\nsight of the laird the blithest she ever saw in her life.\"\n\nLady Dalcastle got plenty of time to read, and pray, and meditate; but\nshe was at a great loss for one to dispute with about religious tenets;\nfor she found that, without this advantage, about which there was a\nperfect rage at that time, the reading and learning of Scripture texts,\nand sentences of intricate doctrine, availed her naught; so she was\noften driven to sit at her casement and look out for the approach of\nthe heathenish Laird of Dalcastle.\n\nThat hero, after a considerable lapse of time, at length made his\nappearance. Matters were not hard to adjust; for his lady found that\nthere was no refuge for her in her father's house; and so, after some\nsighs and tears, she accompanied her husband home. For all that had\npassed, things went on no better. She WOULD convert the laird in spite\nof his teeth: the laird would not be converted. She WOULD have the\nlaird to say family prayers, both morning and evening: the laird would\nneither pray morning nor evening. He would not even sing psalms, and\nkneel beside her while she performed the exercise; neither would he\nconverse at all times, and in all places, about the sacred mysteries of\nreligion, although his lady took occasion to contradict flatly every\nassertion that he made, in order that she might spiritualize him by\ndrawing him into argument.\n\nThe laird kept his temper a long while, but at length his patience wore\nout; he cut her short in all her futile attempts at spiritualization,\nand mocked at her wire-drawn degrees of faith, hope, and repentance. He\nalso dared to doubt of the great standard doctrine of absolute\npredestination, which put the crown on the lady's Christian resentment.\nShe declared her helpmate to be a limb of Antichrist, and one with whom\nno regenerated person could associate. She therefore bespoke a separate\nestablishment, and, before the expiry of the first six months, the\narrangements of the separation were amicably adjusted. The upper, or\nthird, story of the old mansion-house was awarded to the lady for her\nresidence. She had a separate door, a separate stair, a separate\ngarden, and walks that in no instance intersected the laird's; so that\none would have thought the separation complete. They had each their own\nparties, selected from their own sort of people; and, though the laird\nnever once chafed himself about the lady's companies, it was not long\nbefore she began to intermeddle about some of his.\n\n\"Who is that fat bouncing dame that visits the laird so often, and\nalways by herself?\" said she to her maid Martha one day.\n\n\"Oh dear, mem, how can I ken? We're banished frae our acquaintances\nhere, as weel as frae the sweet gospel ordinances.\"\n\n\"Find me out who that jolly dame is, Martha. You, who hold communion\nwith the household of this ungodly man, can be at no loss to attain\nthis information. I observe that she always casts her eye up toward our\nwindows, both in coming and going; and I suspect that she seldom\ndeparts from the house emptyhanded.\"\n\nThat same evening Martha came with the information that this august\nvisitor was a Miss Logan, an old and intimate acquaintance of the\nlaird's, and a very worthy respectable lady, of good connections, whose\nparents had lost their patrimony in the civil wars.\n\n\"Ha! very well!\" said the lady; \"very well, Martha! But, nevertheless,\ngo thou and watch this respectable lady's motions and behaviour the\nnext time she comes to visit the laird--and the next after that. You\nwill not, I see, lack opportunities.\"\n\nMartha's information turned out of that nature that prayers were said\nin the uppermost story of Dalcastle house against the Canaanitish\nwoman, every night and every morning; and great discontent prevailed\nthere, even to anathemas and tears. Letter after letter was dispatched\nto Glasgow; and at length, to the lady's great consolation, the Rev.\nMr. Wringhim arrived safely and devoutly in her elevated sanctuary.\nMarvellous was the conversation between these gifted people. Wringhim\nhad held in his doctrines that there were eight different kinds of\nFAITH, all perfectly distinct in their operations and effects. But the\nlady, in her secluded state, had discovered another five, making twelve\n[sic] in all: the adjusting of the existence or fallacy of these five\nfaiths served for a most enlightened discussion of nearly seventeen\nhours; in the course of which the two got warm in their arguments,\nalways in proportion as they receded from nature, utility, and common\nsense. Wringhim at length got into unwonted fervour about some disputed\npoint between one of these faiths and TRUST: when the lady, fearing\nthat zeal was getting beyond its wonted barrier, broke in on his\nvehement asseverations with the following abrupt discomfiture: \"But,\nSir, as long as I remember, what is to be done with this case of open\nand avowed iniquity?\"\n\nThe minister was struck dumb. He leaned him back on his chair, stroked\nhis beard, hemmed--considered, and hemmed again, and then said, in an\naltered and softened tone: \"Why, that is a secondary consideration; you\nmean the case between your husband and Miss Logan?\"\n\n\"The same, Sir. I am scandalized at such intimacies going on under my\nnose. The sufferance of it is a great and crying evil.\"\n\n\"Evil, madam, may be either operative, or passive. To them it is an\nevil, but to us none. We have no more to do with the sins of the wicked\nand unconverted here than with those of an infidel Turk; for all\nearthly bonds and fellowships are absorbed and swallowed up in the holy\ncommunity of the Reformed Church. However, if it is your wish, I shall\ntake him to task, and reprimand and humble him in such a manner that he\nshall be ashamed of his doings, and renounce such deeds for ever, out\nof mere self-respect, though all unsanctified the heart, as well as the\ndeed, may be. To the wicked, all things are wicked; but to the just,\nall things are just and right.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is a sweet and comfortable saying, Mr. Wringhim! How\ndelightful to think that a justified person can do no wrong! Who would\nnot envy the liberty wherewith we are made free? Go to my husband, that\npoor unfortunate, blindfolded person, and open his eyes to his\ndegenerate and sinful state; for well are you fitted to the task.\"\n\n\"Yea, I will go in unto him, and confound him. I will lay the strong\nholds of sin and Satan as flat before my face as the dung that is\nspread out to fatten the land.\"\n\n\"Master, there's a gentleman at the fore-door wants a private word o'\nye.\"\n\n\"Tell him I'm engaged: I can't see any gentleman to-night. But I shall\nattend on him to-morrow as soon as he pleases.\"\n\n\"'He's coming straight in, Sir. Stop a wee bit, Sir, my master is\nengaged. He cannot see you at present, Sir.\"\n\n\"Stand aside, thou Moabite! My mission admits of no delay. I come to\nsave him from the jaws of destruction!\"\n\n\"An that be the case, Sir, it maks a wide difference; an', as the\ndanger may threaten us a', I fancy I may as weel let ye gang by as\nfight wi' ye, sin' ye seem sae intent on 't.--The man says he's comin'\nto save ye, an' canna stop, Sir. Here he is.\"\n\nThe laird was going to break out into a volley of wrath against Waters,\nhis servant; but, before he got a word pronounced, the Rev. Mr.\nWringhim had stepped inside the room, and Waters had retired, shutting\nthe door behind him.\n\nNo introduction could be more mal-a-propos: it was impossible; for at\nthat very moment the laird and Arabella Logan were both sitting on one\nseat, and both looking on one book, when the door opened. \"What is it,\nSir?\" said the laird fiercely.\n\n\"A message of the greatest importance, Sir,\" said the divine, striding\nunceremoniously up to the chimney, turning his back to the fire, and\nhis face to the culprits. \"I think you should know me, Sir?\" continued\nhe, looking displeasedly at the laird, with his face half turned round.\n\n\"I think I should,\" returned the laird. \"You are a Mr.\nHow's--tey--ca'--him, of Glasgow, who did me the worst turn ever I got\ndone to me in my life. You gentry are always ready to do a man such a\nturn. Pray, Sir, did you ever do a good job for anyone to\ncounterbalance that? For, if you have not, you ought to be--\"\n\n\"Hold, Sir, I say! None of your profanity before me. If I do evil to\nanyone on such occasions, it is because he will have it so; therefore,\nthe evil is not of my doing. I ask you, Sir, before God and this\nwitness, I ask you, have you kept solemnly and inviolate the vows which\nI laid upon you that day? Answer me!\"\n\n\"Has the partner whom you bound me to kept hers inviolate? Answer me\nthat, Sir! None can better do so than you, Mr. How's--tey--ca'--you.\"\n\n\"So, then, you confess your backslidings, and avow the profligacy of\nyour life. And this person here is, I suppose, the partner of your\niniquity--she whose beauty hath caused you to err! Stand up, both of\nyou, till I rebuke you, and show you what you are in the eyes of God\nand man.\"\n\n\"In the first place, stand you still there, till I tell you what you\nare in the eyes of God and man. You are, Sir, a presumptuous,\nself-conceited pedagogue, a stirrer up of strife and commotion in\nchurch, in state, in families, and communities. You are one, Sir, whose\nrighteousness consists in splitting the doctrines of Calvin into\nthousands of undistinguishable films, and in setting up a system of\njustifying-grace against all breaches of all laws, moral or divine. In\nshort, Sir, you are a mildew--a canker-worm in the bosom of the\nReformed Church, generating a disease of which she will never be\npurged, but by the shedding of blood. Go thou in peace, and do these\nabominations no more; but humble thyself, lest a worse reproof come\nupon thee.\"\n\nWringhim heard all this without flinching. He now and then twisted his\nmouth in disdain, treasuring up, meantime, his vengeance against the\ntwo aggressors; for he felt that he had them on the hip, and resolved\nto pour out his vengeance and indignation upon them. Sorry am I that\nthe shackles of modern decorum restrain me from penning that famous\nrebuke; fragments of which have been attributed to every divine of old\nnotoriety throughout Scotland. But I have it by heart; and a glorious\nmorsel it is to put into the hands of certain incendiaries. The\nmetaphors are so strong and so appalling that Miss Logan could only\nstand them a very short time; she was obliged to withdraw in confusion.\nThe laird stood his ground with much ado, though his face was often\ncrimsoned over with the hues of shame and anger. Several times he was\non the point of turning the officious sycophant to the door; but good\nmanners, and an inherent respect that he entertained for the clergy,\nas the immediate servants of the Supreme Being, restrained him.\n\nWringhim, perceiving these symptoms of resentment, took them for marks\nof shame and contrition, and pushed his reproaches farther than ever\ndivine ventured to do in a similar case. When he had finished, to\nprevent further discussion, he walked slowly and majestically out of\nthe apartment, making his robes to swing behind him in a most\nmagisterial manner; he being, without doubt, elated with his high\nconquest. He went to the upper story, and related to his metaphysical\nassociate his wonderful success; how he had driven the dame from the\nhouse in tears and deep confusion, and left the backsliding laird in\nsuch a quandary of shame and repentance that he could neither\narticulate a word nor lift up his countenance. The dame thanked him\nmost cordially, lauding his friendly zeal and powerful eloquence; and\nthen the two again set keenly to the splitting of hairs, and making\ndistinctions in religion where none existed.\n\nThey being both children of adoption, and secured from falling into\nsnares, or anyway under the power of the wicked one, it was their\ncustom, on each visit, to sit up a night in the same apartment, for the\nsake of sweet spiritual converse; but that time, in the course of the\nnight, they differed so materially on a small point somewhere between\njustification and final election that the minister, in the heat of his\nzeal, sprung from his seat, paced the floor, and maintained his point\nwith such ardour that Martha was alarmed, and, thinking they were going\nto fight, and that the minister would be a hard match for her mistress,\nshe put on some clothes, and twice left her bed and stood listening at\nthe back of the door, ready to burst in should need require it. Should\nanyone think this picture over-strained, I can assure him that it is\ntaken from nature and from truth; but I will not likewise aver that the\ntheologist was neither crazed nor inebriated. If the listener's words\nwere to be relied on, there was no love, no accommodating principle\nmanifested between the two, but a fiery burning zeal, relating to\npoints of such minor importance that a true Christian would blush to\nhear them mentioned, and the infidel and profane make a handle of them\nto turn our religion to scorn.\n\nGreat was the dame's exultation at the triumph of her beloved pastor\nover her sinful neighbours in the lower parts of the house; and she\nboasted of it to Martha in high-sounding terms. But it was of short\nduration; for, in five weeks after that, Arabella Logan came to reside\nwith the laird as his housekeeper, sitting at his table and carrying\nthe keys as mistress-substitute of the mansion. The lady's grief and\nindignation were now raised to a higher pitch than ever; and she set\nevery agent to work, with whom she had any power, to effect a\nseparation between these two suspected ones. Remonstrance was of no\navail: George laughed at them who tried such a course, and retained his\nhousekeeper, while the lady gave herself up to utter despair; for,\nthough she would not consort with her husband herself, she could not\nendure that any other should do so.\n\nBut, to countervail this grievous offence, our saintly and afflicted\ndame, in due time, was safely delivered of a fine boy whom the laird\nacknowledged as his son and heir, and had him christened by his own\nname, and nursed in his own premises. He gave the nurse permission to\ntake the boy to his mother's presence if ever she should desire to see\nhim; but, strange as it may appear, she never once desired to see him\nfrom the day that he was born. The boy grew up, and was a healthful and\nhappy child; and, in the course of another year, the lady presented him\nwith a brother. A brother he certainly was, in the eye of the law, and\nit is more than probable that he was his brother in reality. But the\nlaird thought otherwise; and, though he knew and acknowledged that he\nwas obliged to support and provide for him, he refused to acknowledge\nhim in other respects. He neither would countenance the banquet nor\ntake the baptismal vows on him in the child's name; of course, the poor\nboy had to live and remain an alien from the visible church for a year\nand a day; at which time, Mr. Wringhim out of pity and kindness, took\nthe lady herself as sponsor for the boy, and baptized him by the name\nof Robert Wringhim--that being the noted divine's own name.\n\nGeorge was brought up with his father, and educated partly at the\nparish school, and partly at home, by a tutor hired for the purpose. He\nwas a generous and kind-hearted youth; always ready to oblige, and\nhardly ever dissatisfied with anybody. Robert was brought up with Mr.\nWringhim, the laird paying a certain allowance for him yearly; and\nthere the boy was early inured to all the sternness and severity of his\npastor's arbitrary and unyielding creed. He was taught to pray twice\nevery day, and seven times on Sabbath days; but he was only to pray for\nthe elect, and, like Devil of old, doom all that were aliens from God\nto destruction. He had never, in that family into which he had been as\nit were adopted, heard aught but evil spoken of his reputed father and\nbrother; consequently he held them in utter abhorrence, and prayed\nagainst them every day, often \"that the old hoary sinner might be cut\noff in the full flush of his iniquity, and be carried quick into hell;\nand that the young stem of the corrupt trunk might also be taken from a\nworld that he disgraced, but that his sins might be pardoned, because\nhe knew no better.\"\n\nSuch were the tenets in which it would appear young Robert was bred. He\nwas an acute boy, an excellent learner, had ardent and ungovernable\npassions, and, withal, a sternness of demeanour from which other boys\nshrunk. He was the best grammarian, the best reader, writer, and\naccountant in the various classes that he attended, and was fond of\nwriting essays on controverted points of theology, for which he got\nprizes, and great praise from his guardian and mother. George was much\nbehind him in scholastic acquirements, but greatly his superior in\npersonal prowess, form, feature, and all that constitutes gentility in\nthe deportment and appearance. The laird had often manifested to Miss\nLogan an earnest wish that the two young men should never meet, or at\nall events that they should be as little conversant as possible; and\nMiss Logan, who was as much attached to George as if he had been her\nown son, took every precaution, while he was a boy, that he should\nnever meet with his brother; but, as they advanced towards manhood,\nthis became impracticable. The lady was removed from her apartments in\nher husband's house to Glasgow, to her great content; and all to\nprevent the young laird being tainted with the company of her and her\nsecond son; for the laird had felt the effects of the principles they\nprofessed, and dreaded them more than persecution, fire, and sword.\nDuring all the dreadful times that had overpast, though the laird had\nbeen a moderate man, he had still leaned to the side of kingly\nprerogative, and had escaped confiscation and fines, without ever\ntaking any active hand in suppressing the Covenanters. But, after\nexperiencing a specimen of their tenets and manner in his wife, from a\nsecret favourer of them and their doctrines, he grew alarmed at the\nprevalence of such stern and factious principles, now that there was no\ncheck or restraint upon them; and from that time he began to set\nhimself against them, joining with the Cavalier party of that day in\nall their proceedings.\n\nIt so happened that, under the influence of the Earls of Seafield and\nTullibardine, he was returned for a Member of Parliament in the famous\nsession that sat at Edinburgh when the Duke of Queensberry was\ncommissioner, and in which party spirit ran to such an extremity. The\nyoung laird went with his father to the court, and remained in town all\nthe time that the session lasted; and, as all interested people of both\nfactions flocked to the town at that period, so the important Mr.\nWringhim was there among the rest, during the greater part of the time,\nblowing the coal of revolutionary principles with all his might, in\nevery society to which he could obtain admission. He was a great\nfavourite with some of the west country gentlemen of that faction, by\nreason of his unbending impudence. No opposition could for a moment\ncause him either to blush, or retract one item that he had advanced.\nTherefore the Duke of Argyle and his friends made such use of him as\nsportsmen often do of terriers, to start the game, and make a great\nyelping noise to let them know whither the chase is proceeding. They\noften did this out of sport, in order to tease their opponent; for of\nall pesterers that ever fastened on man he was the most insufferable:\nknowing that his coat protected him from manual chastisement, he spared\nno acrimony, and delighted in the chagrin and anger of those with whom\nhe contended. But he was sometimes likewise of real use to the heads of\nthe Presbyterian faction, and therefore was admitted to their tables,\nand of course conceived himself a very great man.\n\nHis ward accompanied him; and, very shortly after their arrival in\nEdinburgh, Robert, for the first time, met with the young laird his\nbrother, in a match at tennis. The prowess and agility of the young\nsquire drew forth the loudest plaudits of approval from his associates,\nand his own exertion alone carried the game every time on the one side,\nand that so far as all I along to count three for their one. The hero's\nname soon ran round the circle, and when his brother Robert, who was an\nonlooker, learned who it was that was gaining so much applause, he came\nand stood close beside him all the time that the game lasted, always\nnow and then putting in a cutting remark by way of mockery.\n\nGeorge could not help perceiving him, not only on account of his\nimpertinent remarks, but he, moreover, stood so near him that he\nseveral times impeded him in his rapid evolutions, and of course got\nhimself shoved aside in no very ceremonious way. Instead of making him\nkeep his distance, these rude shocks and pushes, accompanied sometimes\nwith hasty curses, only made him cling the closer to this king of the\ngame. He seemed determined to maintain his right to his place as an\nonlooker, as well as any of those engaged in the game, and, if they had\ntried him at an argument, he would have carried his point; or perhaps\nhe wished to quarrel with this spark of his jealousy and aversion, and\ndraw the attention of the gay crowd to himself by these means; for,\nlike his guardian, he knew no other pleasure but what consisted in\nopposition. George took him for some impertinent student of divinity,\nrather set upon a joke than anything else. He perceived a lad with\nblack clothes, and a methodistical face, whose countenance and eye he\ndisliked exceedingly, several times in his way, and that was all the\nnotice he took of him the first time they two met. But the next day,\nand every succeeding one, the same devilish-looking youth attended him\nas constantly as his shadow; was always in his way as with intention to\nimpede him and ever and anon his deep and malignant eye met those of\nhis elder brother with a glance so fierce that it sometimes startled\nhim.\n\nThe very next time that George was engaged at tennis, he had not struck\nthe ball above twice till the same intrusive being was again in his\nway. The party played for considerable stakes that day, namely, a\ndinner and wine at the Black Bull tavern; and George, as the hero and\nhead of his party, was much interested in its honour; consequently the\nsight of this moody and hellish-looking student affected him in no very\npleasant manner. \"Pray Sir, be so good as keep without the range of the\nball,\" said he.\n\n\"Is there any law or enactment that can compel me to do so?\" said the\nother, biting his lip with scorn.\n\n\"If there is not, they are here that shall compel you,\" returned\nGeorge. \"So, friend, I rede you to be on your guard.\"\n\nAs he said this, a flush of anger glowed in his handsome face and\nflashed from his sparkling blue eye; but it was a stranger to both, and\nmomently took its departure. The black-coated youth set up his cap\nbefore, brought his heavy brows over his deep dark eyes, put his hands\nin the pockets of his black plush breeches, and stepped a little\nfarther into the semicircle, immediately on his brother's right hand,\nthan he had ever ventured to do before. There he set himself firm on\nhis legs, and, with a face as demure as death, seemed determined to\nkeep his ground. He pretended to be following the ball with his eyes;\nbut every moment they were glancing aside at George. One of the\ncompetitors chanced to say rashly, in the moment of exultation, \"That's\na d--d fine blow, George!\" On which the intruder took up the word, as\ncharacteristic of the competitors, and repeated it every stroke that\nwas given, making such a ludicrous use of it that several of the\nonlookers were compelled to laugh immoderately; but the players were\nterribly nettled at it, as he really contrived, by dint of sliding in\nsome canonical terms, to render the competitors and their game\nridiculous.\n\nBut matters at length came to a crisis that put them beyond sport.\nGeorge, in flying backward to gain the point at which the ball was\ngoing to light, came inadvertently so rudely in contact with this\nobstreperous interloper that he not only overthrew him, but also got a\ngrievous fall over his legs; and, as he arose, the other made a spurn\nat him with his foot, which, if it had hit to its aim, would\nundoubtedly have finished the course of the young laird of Dalcastle\nand Balgrennan. George, being irritated beyond measure, as may well be\nconceived, especially at the deadly stroke aimed at him, struck the\nassailant with his racket, rather slightly, but so that his mouth and\nnose gushed out blood; and, at the same time, he said, turning to his\ncronies: \"Does any of you know who the infernal puppy is?\"\n\n\"Do you know, Sir?\" said one of the onlookers, a stranger, \"the\ngentleman is your own brother, Sir--Mr. Robert Wringhim Colwan!\"\n\n\"No, not Colwan, Sir,\" said Robert, putting his hands in his pockets,\nand setting himself still farther forward than before, \"not a Colwan,\nSir; henceforth I disclaim the name.\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" repeated George. \"My mother's son you may be--but\nnot a Colwan! There you are right.\" Then, turning around to his\ninformer, he said: \"Mercy be about us, Sir! Is this the crazy\nminister's son from Glasgow?\"\n\nThis question was put in the irritation of the moment, but it was too\nrude, and far too out of place, and no one deigned any answer to it. He\nfelt the reproof, and felt it deeply; seeming anxious for some\nopportunity to make an acknowledgment, or some reparation.\n\nIn the meantime, young Wringhim was an object to all of the uttermost\ndisgust. The blood flowing from his mouth and nose he took no pains to\nstem, neither did he so much as wipe it away; so that it spread over\nall his cheeks, and breast, even off at his toes. In that state did he\ntake up his station in the middle of the competitors; and he did not\nnow keep his place, but ran about, impeding everyone who attempted to\nmake at the ball. They loaded him with execrations, but it availed\nnothing; he seemed courting persecution and buffetings, keeping\nsteadfastly to his old joke of damnation, and marring the game so\ncompletely that, in spite of every effort on the part of the players,\nhe forced them to stop their game and give it up. He was such a\nrueful-looking object, covered with blood, that none of them had the\nheart to kick him, although it appeared the only thing he wanted; and,\nas for George, he said not another word to him, either in anger or\nreproof.\n\nWhen the game was fairly given up, and the party were washing their\nhands in the stone fount, some of them besought Robert Wringhim to wash\nhimself; but he mocked at them, and said he was much better as he was.\nGeorge, at length, came forward abashedly towards him, and said: \"I\nhave been greatly to blame, Robert, and am very sorry for what I have\ndone. But, in the first instance, I erred through ignorance, not\nknowing you were my brother, which you certainly are; and, in the\nsecond, through a momentary irritation, for which I am ashamed. I pray\nyou, therefore, to pardon me, and give me your hand.\"\n\nAs he said this, he held out his hand towards his polluted brother; but\nthe froward predestinarian took not his from his breeches pocket, but\nlifting his foot, he gave his brother's hand a kick. \"I'll give you\nwhat will suit such a hand better than mine,\" said he, with a sneer.\nAnd then, turning lightly about, he added: \"Are there to be no more of\nthese d---d fine blows, gentlemen? For shame, to give up such a\nprofitable and edifying game!\"\n\n\"This is too bad,\" said George. \"But, since it is thus, I have the less\nto regret.\" And, having made this general remark, he took no more note\nof the uncouth aggressor. But the persecution of the latter terminated\nnot on the play-ground: he ranked up among them, bloody and disgusting\nas he was, and, keeping close by his brother's side, he marched along\nwith the party all the way to the Black Bull. Before they got there, a\ngreat number of boys and idle people had surrounded them, hooting and\nincommoding them exceedingly, so that they were glad to get into the\ninn; and the unaccountable monster actually tried to get in alongst\nwith them, to make one of the party at dinner. But the innkeeper and\nhis men, getting the hint, by force prevented him from entering,\nalthough he attempted it again and again, both by telling lies and\noffering a bribe. Finding he could not prevail, he set to exciting the\nmob at the door to acts of violence; in which he had like to have\nsucceeded. The landlord had no other shift, at last, but to send\nprivately for two officers, and have him carried to the guard-house;\nand the hilarity and joy of the party of young gentlemen, for the\nevening, was quite spoiled by the inauspicious termination of their\ngame.\n\nThe Rev. Robert Wringhim was now to send for, to release his beloved\nward. The messenger found him at table, with a number of the leaders of\nthe Whig faction, the Marquis of Annandale being in the chair; and, the\nprisoner's note being produced, Wringhim read it aloud, accompanying it\nwith some explanatory remarks. The circumstances of the case being thus\nmagnified and distorted, it excited the utmost abhorrence, both of the\ndeed and the perpetrators, among the assembled faction. They declaimed\nagainst the act as an unnatural attempt on the character, and even the\nlife, of an unfortunate brother, who had been expelled from his\nfather's house. And, as party spirit was the order of the day, an\nattempt was made to lay the burden of it to that account. In short, the\nyoung culprit got some of the best blood of the land to enter as his\nsecurities, and was set at liberty. But, when Wringhim perceived the\nplight that he was in, he took him, as he was, and presented him to his\nhonourable patrons. This raised the indignation against the young laird\nand his associates a thousand-fold, which actually roused the party to\ntemporary madness. They were, perhaps, a little excited by the wine and\nspirits they had swallowed; else a casual quarrel between two young\nmen, at tennis, could not have driven them to such extremes. But\ncertain it is that, from one at first arising to address the party on\nthe atrocity of the offence, both in a moral and political point of\nview, on a sudden there were six on their feet, at the same time,\nexpatiating on it; and, in a very short time thereafter, everyone in\nthe room was up talking with the utmost vociferation, all on the same\nsubject, and all taking the same side in the debate.\n\nIn the midst of this confusion, someone or other issued from the house,\nwhich was at the back of the Canongate, calling out: \"A plot, a plot!\nTreason, treason! Down with the bloody incendiaries at the Black Bull!\"\n\nThe concourse of people that were assembled in Edinburgh at that time\nwas prodigious; and, as they were all actuated by political motives,\nthey wanted only a ready-blown coal to set the mountain on fire. The\nevening being fine, and the streets thronged, the cry ran from mouth to\nmouth through the whole city. More than that, the mob that had of late\nbeen gathered to the door of the Black Bull had, by degrees, dispersed;\nbut, they being young men, and idle vagrants, they had only spread\nthemselves over the rest of the street to lounge in search of further\namusement: consequently, a word was sufficient to send them back to\ntheir late rendezvous, where they had previously witnessed something\nthey did not much approve of.\n\nThe master of the tavern was astonished at seeing the mob again\nassembling; and that with such hurry and noise. But, his inmates being\nall of the highest respectability, he judged himself sure of\nprotection, or at least of indemnity. He had two large parties in his\nhouse at the time; the largest of which was of the Revolutionist\nfaction. The other consisted of our young Tennis-players, and their\nassociates, who were all of the Jacobite order; or, at all events,\nleaned to the Episcopal side. The largest party were in a front room;\nand the attack of the mob fell first on their windows, though rather\nwith fear and caution. Jingle went one pane; then a loud hurrah; and\nthat again was followed by a number of voices, endeavouring to restrain\nthe indignation from venting itself in destroying the windows, and to\nturn it on the inmates. The Whigs, calling the landlord, inquired what\nthe assault meant: he cunningly answered that he suspected it was some\nof the youths of the Cavalier, or High-Church party, exciting the mob\nagainst them. The party consisted mostly of young gentlemen, by that\ntime in a key to engage in any row; and, at all events, to suffer\nnothing from the other party, against whom their passions were mightily\ninflamed.\n\nThe landlord, therefore, had no sooner given them the spirit-rousing\nintelligence than everyone, as by instinct, swore his own natural oath,\nand grasped his own natural weapon. A few of those of the highest rank\nwere armed with swords, which they boldly drew; those of the\nsubordinate orders immediately flew to such weapons as the room,\nkitchen, and scullery afforded--such as tongs, pokers, spits, racks,\nand shovels; and breathing vengeance on the prelatic party, the\nchildren of Antichrist and the heirs of d--n--t--n! the barterers of\nthe liberties of their country, and betrayers of the most sacred\ntrust--thus elevated, and thus armed, in the cause of right, justice,\nand liberty, our heroes rushed to the street, and attacked the mob with\nsuch violence that they broke the mass in a moment, and dispersed their\nthousands like chaff before the wind. The other party of young\nJacobites, who sat in a room farther from the front, and were those\nagainst whom the fury of the mob was meant to have been directed, knew\nnothing of this second uproar, till the noise of the sally made by the\nWhigs assailed their ears; being then informed that the mob had\nattacked the house on account of the treatment they themselves had\ngiven to a young gentleman of the adverse faction, and that another\njovial party had issued from the house in their defence, and was now\nengaged in an unequal combat, the sparks likewise flew, to the field to\nback their defenders with all their prowess, without troubling their\nheads about who they were.\n\nA mob is like a spring tide in an eastern storm, that retires only to\nreturn with more overwhelming fury. The crowd was taken by surprise\nwhen such a strong and well-armed party issued from the house with so\ngreat fury, laying all prostrate that came in their way. Those who were\nnext to the door, and were, of course, the first whom the imminent\ndanger assailed, rushed backwards among the crowd with their whole\nforce. The Black Bull standing in a small square half-way between the\nHigh Street and the Cowgate, and the entrance to it being by two\ncloses, into these the pressure outwards was simultaneous, and\nthousands were moved to an involuntary flight, they knew not why.\n\nBut the High Street of Edinburgh, which they soon reached, is a\ndangerous place in which to make an open attack upon a mob. And it\nappears that the entrances to the tavern had been somewhere near to the\nCross, on the south side of the street; for the crowd fled with great\nexpedition, both to the east and west, and the conquerors, separating\nthemselves as chance directed, pursued impetuously, wounding and\nmaiming as they flew. But it so chanced that, before either of the\nwings had followed the flying squadrons of their enemies for the space\nof a hundred yards each way, the devil an enemy they had to pursue! the\nmultitude had vanished like so many thousands of phantoms! What could\nour heroes do? Why, they faced about to return towards their citadel,\nthe Black Bull. But that feat was not so easily, nor so readily\naccomplished as they divined. The unnumbered alleys on each side of the\nstreet had swallowed up the multitude in a few seconds; but from these\nthey were busy reconnoitring; and  perceiving the deficiency in the\nnumber of their assailants, the rush from both sides of the street was\nas rapid, and as wonderful, as the disappearance of the crowd had been\na few minutes before. Each close vomited out its levies, and these\nbetter armed with missiles than when they sought it for a temporary\nretreat. Woe then to our two columns of victorious Whigs! The mob\nactually closed around them as they would have swallowed them up; and,\nin the meanwhile, shower after shower of the most abominable weapons of\noffence were rained in upon them. If the gentlemen were irritated\nbefore, this inflamed them still further; but their danger was now so\napparent they could not shut their eyes on it; therefore, both parties,\nas if actuated by the same spirit, made a desperate effort to join, and\nthe greater part effected it; but some were knocked down, and others\nwere separated from their friends, and blithe to become silent members\nof the mob.\n\nThe battle now raged immediately in front of the closes leading to the\nBlack Bull; the small body of Whig gentlemen was hardly bested, and it\nis likely would have been overcome and trampled down every man, had\nthey not been then and there joined by the young Cavaliers; who, fresh\nto arms, broke from the wynd, opened the head of the passage, laid\nabout them manfully, and thus kept up the spirits of the exasperated\nWhigs, who were the men in fact that wrought the most deray among the\npopulace.\n\nThe town-guard was now on the alert; and two companies of the\nCameronian Regiment, with the Hon. Captain Douglas, rushed down from\nthe Castle to the scene of action; but, for all the noise and hubbub\nthat these caused in the street, the combat had become so close and\ninveterate that numbers of both sides were taken prisoners fighting\nhand to hand, and could scarcely be separated when the guardsmen and\nsoldiers had them by the necks.\n\nGreat was the alarm and confusion that night in Edinburgh; for everyone\nconcluded that it was a party scuffle, and, the two parties being so\nequal in power, the most serious consequences were anticipated. The\nagitation was so prevailing that every party in town, great and small,\nwas broken up; and the lord-commissioner thought proper to go to the\nCouncil Chamber himself, even at that late hour, accompanied by the\nsheriffs of Edinburgh and Linlithgow, with sundry noblemen besides, in\norder to learn something of the origin of the affray.\n\nFor a long time the court was completely puzzled. Every gentleman\nbrought in exclaimed against the treatment he had received, in most\nbitter terms, blaming a mob set on him and his friends by the adverse\nparty, and matters looked extremely ill until at length they began to\nperceive that they were examining gentlemen of both parties, and that\nthey had been doing so from the beginning, almost alternately, so\nequally had the prisoners been taken from both parties. Finally, it\nturned out that a few gentlemen, two-thirds of whom were strenuous\nWhigs themselves, had joined in mauling the whole Whig population of\nEdinburgh. The investigation disclosed nothing the effect of which was\nnot ludicrous; and the Duke of Queensberry, whose aim was at that time\nto conciliate the two factions, tried all that he could to turn the\nwhole fracas into a joke--an unlucky frolic, where no ill was meant on\neither side, and which yet had been productive of a great deal.\n\nThe greater part of the people went home satisfied; but not so the Rev.\nRobert Wringhim. He did all that he could to inflame both judges and\npopulace against the young Cavaliers, especially against the young\nLaird of Dalcastle, whom he represented as an incendiary, set on by an\nunnatural parent to slander his mother, and make away with a hapless\nand only brother; and, in truth, that declaimer against all human merit\nhad that sort of powerful, homely, and bitter eloquence which seldom\nmissed affecting his hearers: the consequence at that time was that he\nmade the unfortunate affair between the two brothers appear in\nextremely bad colours, and the populace retired to their homes\nimpressed with no very favourable opinion of either the Laird of\nDalcastle or his son George, neither of whom were there present to\nspeak for themselves.\n\nAs for Wringhim himself, he went home to his lodgings, filled with gall\nand with spite against the young laird, whom he was made to believe the\naggressor, and that intentionally. But most of all he was filled with\nindignation against the father, whom he held in abhorrence at all\ntimes, and blamed solely for this unmannerly attack made on his\nfavourite ward, namesake, and adopted son; and for the public\nimputation of a crime to his own reverence in calling the lad his son,\nand thus charging him with a sin against which he was well known to\nhave levelled all the arrows of church censure with unsparing might.\n\nBut, filled as his heart was with some portion of these bad feelings,\nto which all flesh is subject, he kept, nevertheless, the fear of the\nLord always before his eyes so far as never to omit any of the external\nduties of religion, and farther than that man hath no power to pry. He\nlodged with the family of a Mr. Miller, whose lady was originally from\nGlasgow, and had been a hearer and, of course, a great admirer of Mr.\nWringhim. In that family he made public worship every evening; and that\nnight, in his petitions at a throne of grace, he prayed for so many\nvials of wrath to be poured on the head of some particular sinner that\nthe hearers trembled, and stopped their ears. But that he might not\nproceed with so violent a measure, amounting to excommunication,\nwithout due scripture warrant, he began the exercise of the evening by\nsinging the following verses, which it is a pity should ever have been\nadmitted into a Christian psalmody, being so adverse to all its mild\nand benevolent principles:\n\n\n  Set thou the wicked over him,\n  And upon his right hand\n  Give thou his greatest enemy,\n  Even Satan, leave to stand.\n\n  And, when by thee he shall be judged,\n  Let him remembered be;\n  And let his prayer be turned to sin\n  When he shall call on thee.\n\n  Few be his days; and in his room\n  His charge another take;\n  His children let be fatherless;\n  His wife a widow make:\n\n  Let God his father's wickedness\n  Still to remembrance call;\n  And never let his mother's sin\n  Be blotted out at all.\n\n  As he in cursing pleasure took\n  So let it to him fall;\n  As he delighted not to bless,\n  So bless him not at all.\n\n  As cursing he like clothes put on,\n  Into his bowels so,\n  Like water, and into his bones\n  Like oil, down let it go.\n\n\nYoung Wringhim only knew the full purport of this spiritual song; and\nwent to his bed better satisfied than ever that his father and brother\nwere castaways, reprobates, aliens from the Church and the true faith,\nand cursed in time and eternity.\n\nThe next day George and his companions met as usual--all who were not\nseriously wounded of them. But, as they strolled about the city, the\nrancorous eye and the finger of scorn was pointed against them. None of\nthem was at first aware of the reason; but it threw a damp over their\nspirits and enjoyments, which they could not master. They went to take\na forenoon game at their old play of tennis, not on a match, but by way\nof improving themselves; but they had not well taken their places till\nyoung Wringhim appeared in his old station, at his brother's right\nhand, with looks more demure and determined than ever. His lips were\nprimmed so close that his mouth was hardly discernible, and his dark\ndeep eye flashed gleams of holy indignation on the godless set, but\nparticularly on his brother. His presence acted as a mildew on all\nsocial intercourse or enjoyment; the game was marred, and ended ere\never it was well begun. There were whisperings apart--the party\nseparated, and, in order to shake off the blighting influence of this\ndogged persecutor, they entered sundry houses of their acquaintances,\nwith an understanding that they were to meet on the Links for a game at\ncricket.\n\nThey did so; and, stripping off part of their clothes, they began that\nviolent and spirited game. They had not played five minutes till\nWringhim was stalking in the midst of them, and totally impeding the\nplay. A cry arose from all corners of: \"Oh, this will never do. Kick\nhim out of the play-ground! Knock down the scoundrel; or bind him, and\nlet him lie in peace.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" cried George. \"It is evident he wants nothing else. Pray\ndo not humour him so much as to touch him with either foot or finger.\"\nThen, turning to a friend, he said in a whisper: \"Speak to him, Gordon;\nhe surely will not refuse to let us have the ground to ourselves, if\nyou request it of him.\"\n\nGordon went up to him, and requested of him, civilly, but ardently, \"to\nretire to a certain distance, else none of them could or would be\nanswerable, however sore he might be hurt.\"\n\nHe turned disdainfully on his heel, uttered a kind of pulpit hem! and\nthen added, \"I will take my chance of that; hurt me, any of you, at\nyour peril.\"\n\nThe young gentlemen smiled, through spite and disdain of the dogged\nanimal. Gordon followed him up, and tried to remonstrate with him; but\nhe let him know that \"it was his pleasure to be there at that time;\nand, unless he could demonstrate to him what superior right he and his\nparty had to that ground, in preference to him, and to the exclusion of\nall others, he was determined to assert his right, and the rights of\nhis fellow-citizens, by keeping possession of whatsoever part of that\ncommon field he chose.\"\n\n\"You are no gentleman, Sir,\" said Gordon.\n\n\"Are you one, Sir?\" said the other.\n\n\"Yes, Sir. I will let you know that I am, by G--!\"\n\n\"Then, thanks be to Him whose name you have profaned, I am none. If one\nof the party be a gentleman, I do hope in God am not!\"\n\nIt was now apparent to them all that he was courting obloquy and manual\nchastisement from their hands, if  by any means he could provoke them\nto the deed; and, apprehensive that he had some sinister and deep-laid\ndesign in hunting after such a singular favour, they wisely restrained\none another from inflicting the punishment that each of them yearned to\nbestow, personally, and which he so well deserved.\n\nBut the unpopularity of the younger George Colwan could no longer be\nconcealed from his associates. It was manifested wherever the populace\nwere assembled; and his young and intimate friend, Adam Gordon, was\nobliged to warn him of the circumstance that he might not be surprised\nat the gentlemen of their acquaintance withdrawing themselves from his\nsociety, as they could not be seen with him without being insulted.\nGeorge thanked him; and it was agreed between them that the former\nshould keep himself retired during the daytime while he remained in\nEdinburgh, and that at night they should meet together, along with such\nof their companions as were disengaged.\n\nGeorge found it every day more and more necessary to adhere to this\nsystem of seclusion; for it was not alone the hisses of the boys and\npopulace that pursued him--a fiend of more malignant aspect was ever at\nhis elbow, in the form of his brother. To whatever place of amusement\nhe betook himself, and however well he concealed his intentions of\ngoing there from all flesh living, there was his brother Wringhim also,\nand always within a few yards of him, generally about the same\ndistance, and ever and anon darting looks at him that chilled his very\nsoul. They were looks that cannot be described; but they were felt\npiercing to the bosom's deepest core. They affected even the onlookers\nin a very particular manner, for all whose eyes caught a glimpse of\nthese hideous glances followed them to the object towards which they\nwere darted: the gentlemanly and mild demeanour of that object\ngenerally calmed their startled apprehensions; for no one ever yet\nnoted the glances of the young man's eye, in the black coat, at the\nface of his brother, who did not at first manifest strong symptoms of\nalarm.\n\nGeorge became utterly confounded; not only at the import of this\npersecution, but how in the world it came to pass that this\nunaccountable being knew all his motions, and every intention of his\nheart, as it were intuitively. On consulting his own previous feelings\nand resolutions, he found that the circumstances of his going to such\nand such a place were often the most casual incidents in nature--the\ncaprice of a moment had carried him there, and yet he had never sat or\nstood many minutes till there was the selfsame being, always in the\nsame position with regard to himself, as regularly as the shadow is\ncast from the substance, or the ray of light from the opposing denser\nmedium.\n\nFor instance, he remembered one day of setting out with the intention\nof going to attend divine worship in the High Church, and when, within\na short space of its door, he was overtaken by young Kilpatrick of\nCloseburn, who was bound to the Grey-Friars to see his sweetheart, as\nhe said: \"and if you will go with me, Colwan,\" said he, \"I will let you\nsee her too, and then you will be just as far forward as I am.\"\n\nGeorge assented at once, and went; and, after taking his seat, he\nleaned his head forwards on the pew to repeat over to himself a short\nejaculatory prayer, as had always been his custom on entering the house\nof God. When he had done, he lifted his eye naturally towards that\npoint on his right hand where the fierce apparition of his brother had\nbeen wont to meet his view: there he was, in the same habit, form,\ndemeanour, and precise point of distance, as usual! George again laid\ndown his head, and his mind was so astounded that he had nearly fallen\ninto a swoon. He tried shortly after to muster up courage to look at\nthe speaker, at the congregation, and at Captain Kilpatrick's\nsweetheart in particular; but the fiendish glances of the young man in\nthe black clothes were too appalling to be withstood--his eye caught\nthem whether he was looking that way or not: at length his courage was\nfairly mastered, and he was obliged to look down during the remainder\nof the service.\n\nBy night or by day it was the same. In the gallery of the Parliament\nHouse, in the boxes of the play-house, in the church, in the assembly,\nin the streets, suburbs, and the fields; and every day, and every hour,\nfrom the first rencounter of the two, the attendance became more and\nmore constant, more inexplicable, and altogether more alarming and\ninsufferable, until at last George was fairly driven from society, and\nforced to spend his days in his and his father's lodgings with closed\ndoors. Even there, he was constantly harassed with the idea that, the\nnext time he lifted his eyes, he would to a certainty see that face,\nthe most repulsive to all his feelings of aught the earth contained.\nThe attendance of that brother was now become like the attendance of a\ndemon on some devoted being that had sold himself to destruction; his\napproaches as undiscerned, and his looks as fraught with hideous\nmalignity. It was seldom that he saw him either following him in the\nstreets, or entering any house or church after him; he only appeared in\nhis place, George wist not how, or whence; and, having sped so ill in\nhis first friendly approaches, he had never spoken to his equivocal\nattendant a second time.\n\nIt came at length into George's head, as he was pondering, by himself,\non the circumstances of this extraordinary attendance, that perhaps his\nbrother had relented, and, though of so sullen and unaccommodating a\ntemper that he would not acknowledge it, or beg a reconciliation, it\nmight be for that very purpose that he followed his steps night and day\nin that extraordinary manner. \"I cannot for my life see for what other\npurpose it can be,\" thought he. \"He never offers to attempt my life;\nnor dares he, if he had the inclination; therefore, although his manner\nis peculiarly repulsive to me, I shall not have my mind burdened with\nthe reflection that my own mother's son yearned for a reconciliation\nwith me and was repulsed by my haughty and insolent behaviour. The next\ntime he comes to my hand, I am resolved that I will accost him as one\nbrother ought to address another, whatever it may cost me; and, if I am\nstill flouted with disdain, then shall the blame rest with him.\"\n\nAfter this generous resolution, it was a good while before his\ngratuitous attendant appeared at his side again; and George began to\nthink that his visits were discontinued. The hope was a relief that\ncould not be calculated; but still George had a feeling that it was too\nsupreme to last. His enemy had been too pertinacious to abandon his\ndesign, whatever it was. He, however, began to indulge in a little more\nliberty, and for several days he enjoyed it with impunity.\n\nGeorge was, from infancy, of a stirring active disposition and could\nnot endure confinement; and, having been of late much restrained in his\nyouthful exercises by this singular persecutor, he grew uneasy under\nsuch restraint, and, one morning, chancing to awaken very early, he\narose to make an excursion to the top of Arthur's Seat, to breathe the\nbreeze of the dawning, and see the sun arise out of the eastern ocean.\nThe morning was calm and serene; and as he walked down the south back\nof the Canongate, towards the Palace, the haze was so close around him\nthat he could not see the houses on the opposite side of the way. As he\npassed the Lord-Commissioner's house, the guards were in attendance,\nwho cautioned him not to go by the Palace, as all the gates would be\nshut and guarded for an hour to come, on which he went by the back of\nSt. Anthony's gardens, and found his way into that little romantic\nglade adjoining to the saint's chapel and well. He was still involved\nin a blue haze, like a dense smoke, but yet in the midst of it the\nrespiration was the most refreshing and delicious. The grass and the\nflowers were loaden with dew; and, on taking off his hat to wipe his\nforehead, he perceived that the black glossy fur of which his chaperon\nwas wrought was all covered with a tissue of the most delicate\nsilver--a fairy web, composed of little spheres, so minute that no eye\ncould discern any of them; yet there they were shining in lovely\nmillions. Afraid of defacing so beautiful and so delicate a garnish, he\nreplaced his hat with the greatest caution, and went on his way light\nof heart.\n\nAs he approached the swire at the head of the dell--that little\ndelightful verge from which in one moment the eastern limits and shores\nof Lothian arise on the view--as he approached it, I say, and a little\nspace from the height, he beheld, to his astonishment, a bright halo in\nthe cloud of haze, that rose in a semicircle over his head like a pale\nrainbow. He was struck motionless at the view of the lovely vision; for\nit so chanced that he had never seen the same appearance before, though\ncommon at early morn. But he soon perceived the cause of the\nphenomenon, and that it proceeded from the rays of the sun from a pure\nunclouded morning sky striking upon this dense vapour which refracted\nthem. But, the better all the works of nature are understood, the more\nthey will be ever admired. That was a scene that would have entranced\nthe man of science with delight, but which the uninitiated and sordid\nman would have regarded less than the mole rearing up his hill in\nsilence and in darkness.\n\nGeorge did admire this halo of glory, which still grew wider, and less\ndefined, as he approached the surface, of the cloud. But, to his utter\namazement and supreme delight, he found, on reaching the top of\nArthur's Seat, that this sublunary rainbow, this terrestrial glory, was\nspread in its most vivid hues beneath his feet. Still he could not\nperceive the body of the sun, although the light behind him was\ndazzling; but the cloud of haze lying dense in that deep dell that\nseparates the hill from the rocks of Salisbury, and the dull shadow of\nthe hill mingling with that cloud made the dell a pit of darkness. On\nthat shadowy cloud was the lovely rainbow formed, spreading itself on a\nhorizontal plain, and having a slight and brilliant shade of all the\ncolours of the heavenly bow, but all of them paler and less defined.\nBut this terrestrial phenomenon of the early morn cannot be better\ndelineated than by the name given of it by the shepherd boys, \"The\nlittle wee ghost of the rainbow.\"\n\nSuch was the description of the morning, and the wild shades of the\nhill, that George gave to his father and Mr. Adam Gordon that same day\non which he had witnessed them; and it is necessary that the reader\nshould comprehend something of their nature to understand what follows.\n\nHe seated himself on the pinnacle of the rocky precipice, a little\nwithin the top of the hill to the westward, and, with a light and\nbuoyant heart, viewed the beauties of the morning, and inhaled its\nsalubrious breeze. \"Here,\" thought he, \"I can converse with nature\nwithout disturbance, and without being intruded on by any appalling or\nobnoxious visitor.\" The idea of his brother's dark and malevolent looks\ncoming at that moment across his mind, he turned his eyes instinctively\nto the right, to the point where that unwelcome guest was wont to make\nhis appearance. Gracious Heaven! What an apparition was there presented\nto his view! He saw, delineated in the cloud, the shoulders, arms, and\nfeatures of a human being of the most dreadful aspect. The face was the\nface of his brother, but dilated to twenty times the natural size. Its\ndark eyes gleamed on him through the mist, while every furrow of its\nhideous brow frowned deep as the ravines on the brow of the hill.\nGeorge started, and his hair stood up in bristles as he gazed on this\nhorrible monster. He saw every feature and every line of the face\ndistinctly as it gazed on him with an intensity that was hardly\nbrookable. Its eyes were fixed on him, in the same manner as those of\nsome carnivorous animal fixed on its prey; and yet there was fear and\ntrembling in these unearthly features, as plainly depicted as murderous\nmalice. The giant apparition seemed sometimes to be cowering down as in\nterror, so that nothing but his brow and eyes were seen; still these\nnever turned one moment from their object--again it rose imperceptively\nup, and began to approach with great caution; and, as it neared, the\ndimensions of its form lessened, still continuing, however, far above\nthe natural size.\n\nGeorge conceived it to be a spirit. He could conceive it to be nothing\nelse; and he took it for some horrid demon by which he was haunted,\nthat had assumed the features of his brother in every lineament, but,\nin taking on itself the human form, had miscalculated dreadfully on the\nsize, and presented itself thus to him in a blown-up, dilated frame of\nembodied air, exhaled from the caverns of death or the regions of\ndevouring fire. He was further confirmed in the belief that it was a\nmalignant spirit on perceiving that it approached him across the front\nof a precipice, where there was not footing for thing of mortal frame.\nStill, what with terror and astonishment, he continued riveted to the\nspot, till it approached, as he deemed, to within two yards of him; and\nthen, perceiving that it was setting itself to make a violent spring on\nhim, he started to his feet and fled distractedly in the opposite\ndirection, keeping his eye cast behind him lest he had been seized in\nthat dangerous place. But the very first bolt that he made in his\nflight he came in contact with a real body of flesh and blood, and that\nwith such violence that both went down among some scragged rocks, and\nGeorge rolled over the other. The being called out \"Murder\"; and,\nrising, fled precipitately. George then perceived that it was his\nbrother; and being confounded between the shadow and the substance, he\nknew not what he was doing or what he had done; and, there being only\none natural way of retreat from the brink of the rock, he likewise\narose and pursued the affrighted culprit with all his speed towards the\ntop of the hill. Wringhim was braying out, \"Murder! murder!\" at which\nGeorge, being disgusted, and his spirits all in a ferment from some\nhurried idea of intended harm, the moment he came up with the craven he\nseized him rudely by the shoulder, and clapped his hand on his mouth.\n\"Murder, you beast!\" said he; \"what do you mean by roaring out murder\nin that way? Who the devil is murdering you, or offering to murder you?\"\n\nWringhim forced his mouth from under his brother's hand, and roared\nwith redoubled energy: \"Eh! Egh! Murder! murder!\" etc. George had felt\nresolute to put down this shocking alarm, lest someone might hear it\nand fly to the spot, or draw inferences widely different from the\ntruth; and, perceiving the terror of this elect youth to be so great\nthat expostulation was vain, he seized him by the mouth and nose with\nhis left hand so strenuously that he sank his fingers into his cheeks.\nBut, the poltroon still attempting to bray out, George gave him such a\nstunning blow with his fist on the left temple that he crumbled, as it\nwere, to the ground, but more from the effects of terror than those of\nthe blow. His nose, however, again gushed out blood, a system of\ndefence which seemed as natural to him as that resorted to by the race\nof stinkards. He then raised himself on his knees and hams, and raising\nup his ghastly face, while the blood streamed over both ears, he\nbesought his life of his brother, in the most abject whining manner,\ngaping and blubbering most piteously.\n\n\"Tell me then, Sir,\" said George, resolved to make the most of the\nwretch's terror--\"tell me for what purpose it is that you haunt my\nsteps? Tell me plainly, and instantly, else I will throw you from the\nverge of that precipice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I will never do it again! I will never do it again! Spare my life,\ndear, good brother! Spare my life! Sure I never did you any hurt.\"\n\n\"Swear to me, then, by the God that made you, that you will never\nhenceforth follow after me to torment me with your hellish threatening\nlooks; swear that you will never again come into my presence without\nbeing invited. Will you take an oath to this effect?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! I will, I will!\"\n\n\"But this is not all: you must tell me for what purpose you sought me\nout here this morning?\"\n\n\"Oh, brother! For nothing but your good. I had nothing at heart but\nyour unspeakable profit, and great and endless good.\"\n\n\"So, then, you indeed knew that I was here?\"\n\n\"I was told so by a friend, but I did not believe him; a--a--at least I\ndid not know that it was true till I saw you.\"\n\n\"Tell me this one thing, then, Robert, and all shall be forgotten and\nforgiven. Who was that friend?\"\n\n\"You do not know him.\"\n\n\"How then does he know me?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"Was he here present with you to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was not far distant. He came to this hill with me.\"\n\n\"Where then is he now?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"Then, wretch, confess that the devil was that friend who told you I\nwas here, and who came here with you. None else could possibly know of\nmy being here.\"\n\n\"Ah! how little you know of him! Would you argue that there is neither\nman nor spirit endowed with so much foresight as to deduce natural\nconclusions from previous actions and incidents but the devil? Alas,\nbrother! But why should I wonder at such abandoned notions and\nprinciples? It was fore-ordained that you should cherish them, and that\nthey should be the ruin of your soul and body, before the world was\nframed. Be assured of this, however, that I had no aim of seeking you\nbut your good!\"\n\n\"Well, Robert, I will believe it. I am disposed to be hasty and\npassionate: it is a fault in my nature; but I never meant, or wished\nyou evil; and God is my witness that I would as soon stretch out my\nhand to my own life, or my father's, as to yours.\" At these words,\nWringhim uttered a hollow exulting laugh, put his hands in his pockets,\nand withdrew a space to his accustomed distance. George continued: \"And\nnow, once for all, I request that we may exchange forgiveness, and that\nwe may part and remain friends.\"\n\n\"Would such a thing be expedient, think you? Or consistent with the\nglory of God? I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I can think of nothing that would be more so. Is it not consistent\nwith every precept of the Gospel? Come, brother, say that our\nreconciliation is complete.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly! I tell you, brother, according to the flesh: it is\njust as complete as the lark's is with the adder, no more so, nor ever\ncan. Reconciled, forsooth! To what would I be reconciled?\"\n\nAs he said this, he strode indignantly away. From the moment that he\nheard his life was safe, he assumed his former insolence and revengeful\nlooks--and never were they more dreadful than on parting with his\nbrother that morning on the top of the hill. \"Well, go thy way,\" said\nGeorge; \"some would despise, but I pity thee. If thou art not a limb of\nSatan, I never saw one.\"\n\nThe sun had now dispelled the vapours; and, the morning being lovely\nbeyond description, George sat himself down on the top of the hill, and\npondered deeply on the unaccountable incident that had befallen to him\nthat morning. He could in no-wise comprehend it; but, taking it with\nother previous circumstances, he could not get quit of a conviction\nthat he was haunted by some evil genius in the shape of his brother, as\nwell as by that dark and mysterious wretch himself. In no other way\ncould he account for the apparition he saw that morning on the face of\nthe rock, nor for several sudden appearances of the same being, in\nplaces where there was no possibility of any foreknowledge that he\nhimself was to be there, and as little that the same being, if he were\nflesh and blood like other men, could always start up in the same\nposition with regard to him. He determined, therefore, on reaching\nhome, to relate all that had happened, from beginning to end, to his\nfather, asking his counsel and his assistance, although he knew full\nwell that his father was not the fittest man in the world to solve such\na problem. He was now involved in party politics, over head and ears;\nand, moreover, he could never hear the names of either of the Wringhims\nmentioned without getting into a quandary of disgust and anger; and all\nthat he would deign to say of them was, to call them by all the\nopprobrious names he could invent.\n\nIt turned out as the young man from the first suggested: old Dalcastle\nwould listen to nothing concerning them with any patience. George\ncomplained that his brother harassed him with his presence at all\ntimes, and in all places. Old Dal asked why he did not kick the dog out\nof his presence whenever he felt him disagreeable? George said he\nseemed to have some demon for a familiar. Dal answered that he did not\nwonder a bit at that, for the young spark was the third in a direct\nline who had all been children of adultery; and it was well known that\nall such were born half-deils themselves, and nothing was more likely\nthan that they should hold intercourse with their fellows. In the same\nstyle did he sympathize with all his son's late sufferings and\nperplexities.\n\nIn Mr. Adam Gordon, however, George found a friend who entered into all\nhis feelings, and had seen and known everything about the matter. He\ntried to convince him that at all events there could be nothing\nsupernatural in the circumstances; and that the vision he had seen on\nthe rock, among the thick mist, was the shadow of his brother\napproaching behind him. George could not swallow this, for he had seen\nhis own shadow on the cloud, and, instead of approaching to aught like\nhis own figure, he perceived nothing but a halo of glory round a point\nof the cloud that was whiter and purer than the rest. Gordon said, if\nhe would go with him to a mountain of his father's, which he named, in\nAberdeenshire, he would show him a giant spirit of the same dimensions,\nany morning at the rising of the sun, provided he shone on that spot.\nThis statement excited George's curiosity exceedingly; and, being\ndisgusted with some things about Edinburgh, and glad to get out of the\nway, he consented to go with Gordon to the Highlands for a space. The\nday was accordingly set for their departure, the old laird's assent\nobtained, and the two young sparks parted in a state of great\nimpatience for their excursion.\n\nOne of them found out another engagement, however, the instant after\nthis last was determined on. Young Wringhim went off the hill that\nmorning, and home to his upright guardian again without washing the\nblood from his face and neck; and there he told a most woeful story\nindeed: how he had gone out to take a morning's walk on the hill, where\nhe had encountered with his reprobate brother among the mist, who had\nknocked him down and very near murdered him; threatening dreadfully,\nand with horrid oaths, to throw him from the top of the cliff.\n\nThe wrath of the great divine was kindled beyond measure. He cursed the\naggressor in the name of the Most High; and bound himself, by an oath,\nto cause that wicked one's transgressions return upon his own head\nsevenfold. But, before he engaged further in the business of vengeance,\nhe kneeled with his adopted son, and committed the whole cause unto the\nLord, whom he addressed as one coming breathing burning coals of\njuniper, and casting his lightnings before him, to destroy and root out\nall who had moved hand or tongue against the children of the promise.\nThus did he arise confirmed, and go forth to certain conquest.\n\nWe cannot enter into the detail of the events that now occurred without\nforestalling a part of the narrative of one who knew all the\ncircumstances--was deeply interested in them, and whose relation is of\nhigher value than anything that can be retailed out of the stores of\ntradition and old registers; but, his narrative being different from\nthese, it was judged expedient to give the account as thus publicly\nhanded down to us. Suffice it that, before evening, George was\napprehended, and lodged in jail, on a criminal charge of an assault and\nbattery, to the shedding of blood, with the intent of committing\nfratricide. Then was the old laird in great consternation, and blamed\nhimself for treating the thing so lightly, which seemed to have been\ngone about, from the beginning, so systematically, and with an intent\nwhich the villains were now going to realize, namely, to get the young\nlaird disposed of; and then his brother, in spite of the old\ngentleman's teeth, would be laird himself.\n\nOld Dal now set his whole interest to work among the noblemen and\nlawyers of his party. His son's case looked exceedingly ill, owing to\nthe former assault before witnesses, and the unbecoming expressions\nmade use of by him on that occasion, as well as from the present\nassault, which George did not deny, and for which no moving cause or\nmotive could be made to appear.\n\nOn his first declaration before the sheriff, matters looked no better:\nbut then the sheriff was a Whig. It is well known how differently the\npeople of the present day, in Scotland, view the cases of their own\nparty-men and those of opposite political principles. But this day is\nnothing to that in such matters, although, God knows, they are still\nsometimes barefaced enough. It appeared, from all the witnesses in the\nfirst case, that the complainant was the first aggressor--that he\nrefused to stand out of the way, though apprised of his danger; and,\nwhen his brother came against him inadvertently, he had aimed a blow at\nhim with his foot, which, if it had taken effect, would have killed\nhim. But as to the story of the apparition in fair day-light--the\nflying from the face of it--the running foul of his brother pursuing\nhim, and knocking him down, why the judge smiled at the relation, and\nsaying: \"It was a very extraordinary story,\" he remanded George to\nprison, leaving the matter to the High Court of Justiciary.\n\nWhen the case came before that court, matters took a different turn.\nThe constant and sullen attendance of the one brother upon the other\nexcited suspicions; and these were in some manner confirmed when the\nguards at Queensberry House deported that the prisoner went by them on\nhis way to the hill that morning, about twenty minutes before the\ncomplainant, and, when the latter passed, he asked if such a young man\nhad passed before him, describing the prisoner's appearance to them;\nand that, on being answered in the affirmative, he mended his pace and\nfell a-running.\n\nThe Lord Justice, on hearing this, asked the prisoner if he had any\nsuspicions that his brother had a design on his life.\n\nHe answered that all along, from the time of their first unfortunate\nmeeting, his brother had dogged his steps so constantly, and so\nunaccountably, that he was convinced it was with some intent out of the\nordinary course of events; and that if, as his lordship supposed, it\nwas indeed his shadow that he had seen approaching him through the\nmist, then, from the cowering and cautious manner that it advanced,\nthere was no little doubt that his brother's design had been to push\nhim headlong from the cliff that morning.\n\nA conversation then took place between the judge and the Lord Advocate;\nand, in the meantime, a bustle was seen in the hall; on which the doors\nwere ordered to be guarded, and, behold, the precious Mr. R. Wringhim\nwas taken into custody, trying to make his escape out of court. Finally\nit turned out that George was honourably acquitted, and young Wringhim\nbound over to keep the peace, with heavy penalties and securities.\n\nThat was a day of high exultation to George and his youthful\nassociates, all of whom abhorred Wringhim; and, the evening being spent\nin great glee, it was agreed between Mr. Adam Gordon and George that\ntheir visit to the Highlands, though thus long delayed, was not to be\nabandoned; and though they had, through the machinations of an\nincendiary, lost the season of delight, they would still find plenty of\nsport in deer-shooting. Accordingly, the day was set a second time for\ntheir departure; and, on the day preceding that, all the party were\ninvited by George to dine with him once more at the sign of the Black\nBull of Norway. Everyone promised to attend, anticipating nothing but\nfestivity and joy. Alas, what short-sighted improvident creatures we\nare, all of us; and how often does the evening cup of joy lead to\nsorrow in the morning!\n\nThe day arrived--the party of young noblemen and gentlemen met, and\nwere as happy and jovial as men could be. George was never seen so\nbrilliant, or so full of spirits; and exulting to see so many gallant\nyoung chiefs and gentlemen about him, who all gloried in the same\nprinciples of loyalty (perhaps this word should have been written\ndisloyalty), he made speeches, gave toasts, and sung songs, all leaning\nslyly to the same side, until a very late hour. By that time he had\npushed the bottle so long and so freely that its fumes had taken\npossession of every brain to such a degree that they held Dame Reason\nrather at the staff's end, overbearing all her counsels and\nexpostulations; and it was imprudently proposed by a wild inebriated\nspark, and carried by a majority of voices, that the whole party should\nadjourn to a bagnio for the remainder of the night.\n\nThey did so; and it appears from what follows that the house, to which\nthey retired must have been somewhere on the opposite side of the\nstreet to the Black Bull Inn, a little farther to the eastward. They\nhad not been an hour in that house till some altercation chanced to\narise between George Colwan and a Mr. Drummond, the younger son of a\nnobleman of distinction. It was perfectly casual, and no one\nthenceforward, to this day, could ever tell what it was about, if it\nwas not about the misunderstanding of some word or term that the one\nhad uttered. However it was, some high words passed between them; these\nwere followed by threats, and, in less than two minutes from the\ncommencement of the quarrel, Drummond left the house in apparent\ndispleasure, hinting to the other that they two should settle that in a\nmore convenient place.\n\nThe company looked at one another, for all was over before any of them\nknew such a thing was begun. \"What the devil is the matter?\" cried one.\n\"What ails Drummond?\" cried another. \"Who has he quarrelled with?\"\nasked a third.\n\n\"Don't know.\"--\"Can't tell, on my life.\"--\"He has quarrelled with his\nwine, I suppose, and is going to send it a challenge.\"\n\nSuch were the questions, and such the answers that passed in the jovial\nparty, and the matter was no more thought of.\n\nBut in the course of a very short space, about the length which the\nideas of the company were the next day at great variance, a sharp rap\ncame to the door. It was opened by a female; but, there being a chain\ninside, she only saw one side of the person at the door. He appeared to\nbe a young gentleman, in appearance like him who had lately left the\nhouse, and asked, in a low whispering voice, \"if young Dalcastle was\nstill in the house?\" The woman did not know. \"If he is,\" added he,\n\"pray tell him to speak with me for a few minutes.\" The woman delivered\nthe message before all the party, among whom there were then sundry\ncourteous ladies of notable distinction, and George, on receiving it,\ninstantly rose from the side of one of them, and said, in the hearing\nof them all, \"I will bet a hundred merks that is Drummond.\"--\"Don't go\nto quarrel with him, George,\" said one.--\"Bring him in with you,\" said\nanother. George stepped out; the door was again bolted, the chain drawn\nacross, and the inadvertent party, left within, thought no more of the\ncircumstance till the morning, that the report had spread over the city\nthat a young gentleman had been slain, on a little washing-green at the\nside of the North Loch, and at the very bottom of the close where this\nthoughtless party had been assembled.\n\nSeveral of them, on first hearing the report, basted to the dead-room\nin the Guard-house, where the corpse had been deposited, and soon\ndiscovered the body to be that of their friend and late entertainer,\nGeorge Colwan. Great were the consternation and grief of all concerned,\nand, in particular, of his old father and Miss Logan; for George had\nalways been the sole hope and darling of both, and the news of the\nevent paralysed them so as to render them incapable of all thought or\nexertion. The spirit of the old laird was broken by the blow, and he\ndescended at once from a jolly, good-natured and active man to a mere\ndriveller, weeping over the body of his son, kissing his wound, his\nlips, and his cold brow alternately; denouncing vengeance on his\nmurderers, and lamenting that he himself had not met the cruel doom, so\nthat the hope of his race might have been preserved. In short, finding\nthat all further motive of action and object of concern or of love,\nhere below, were for ever removed from him, he abandoned himself to\ndespair, and threatened to go down to the grave with his son.\n\nBut, although he made no attempt to discover the murderers, the arm of\njustice was not idle; and, it being evident to all that the crime must\ninfallibly be brought home to young Drummond, some of his friends\nsought him out, and compelled him, sorely against his will, to retire\ninto concealment till the issue of the proof that should be led was\nmade known. At the same time, he denied all knowledge of the incident\nwith a resolution that astonished his intimate friends and relations,\nwho to a man suspected him guilty. His father was not in Scotland, for\nI think it was said to me that this young man was second son to a John,\nDuke of Melfort, who lived abroad with the royal family of the Stuarts;\nbut this young gentleman lived with the relations of his mother, one of\nwhom, an uncle, was a Lord of Session: these, having thoroughly\neffected his concealment, went away, and listened to the evidence; and\nthe examination of every new witness convinced them that their noble\nyoung relative was the slayer of his friend.\n\nAll the young gentlemen of the party were examined, save Drummond, who,\nwhen sent for, could not be found, which circumstance sorely confirmed\nthe suspicions against him in the minds of judges and jurors, friends\nand enemies; and there is little doubt that the care of his relations\nin concealing him injured his character and his cause. The young\ngentlemen of whom the party was composed varied considerably with\nrespect to the quarrel between him and the deceased. Some of them had\nneither heard nor noted it; others had, but not one of them could tell\nhow it began. Some of them had heard the threat uttered by Drummond on\nleaving the house, and one only had noted him lay his hand on his\nsword. Not one of them could swear that it was Drummond who came to the\ndoor and desired to speak with the deceased, but the general impression\non the minds of them all was to that effect; and one of the women swore\nthat she heard the voice distinctly at the door, and every word that\nvoice pronounced, and at the same time heard the deceased say that it\nwas Drummond's.\n\nOn the other hand, there were some evidences on Drummond's part, which\nLord Craigie, his uncle, had taken care to collect. He produced the\nsword which his nephew had worn that night, on which there was neither\nblood nor blemish; and, above all, he insisted on the evidence of a\nnumber of surgeons, who declared that both the wounds which the\ndeceased had received had been given behind. One of these was below the\nleft arm, and a slight one; the other was quite through the body, and\nboth evidently inflicted with the same weapon, a two-edged sword, of\nthe same dimensions as that worn by Drummond.\n\nUpon the whole, there was a division in the court, but a majority\ndecided it. Drummond was pronounced guilty of the murder; outlawed for\nnot appearing, and a high reward offered for his apprehension. It was\nwith the greatest difficulty that he escaped on board of a small\ntrading vessel, which landed him in Holland, and from thence, flying\ninto Germany, he entered into the service of the Emperor Charles VI.\nMany regretted that he was not taken, and made to suffer the penalty\ndue for such a crime, and the melancholy incident became a pulpit theme\nover a great part of Scotland, being held up as a proper warning to\nyouth to beware of such haunts of vice and depravity, the nurses of all\nthat is precipitate, immoral, and base, among mankind.\n\nAfter the funeral of this promising and excellent young man, his father\nnever more held up his head. Miss Logan, with all her art, could not\nget him to attend to any worldly thing, or to make any settlement\nwhatsoever of his affairs, save making her over a present of what\ndisposable funds he had about him. As to his estates, when they were\nmentioned to him, he wished them all in the bottom of the sea, and\nhimself along with them. But, whenever she mentioned the circumstance\nof Thomas Drummond having been the murderer of his son, he shook his\nhead, and once made the remark that \"It was all a mistake, a gross and\nfatal error; but that God, who had permitted such a flagrant deed,\nwould bring it to light in his own time and way.\" In a few weeks he\nfollowed his son to the grave, and the notorious Robert Wringhim took\npossession of his estates as the lawful son of the late laird, born in\nwedlock, and under his father's roof. The investiture was celebrated by\nprayer, singing of psalms, and religious disputation. The late guardian\nand adopted father, and the mother of the new laird, presided on the\ngrand occasion, making a conspicuous figure in all the work of the day;\nand, though the youth himself indulged rather more freely in the bottle\nthan he had ever been seen to do before, it was agreed by all present\nthat there had never been a festivity so sanctified within the great\nhall of Dalcastle. Then, after due thanks returned, they parted\nrejoicing in spirit; which thanks, by the by, consisted wholly in\ntelling the Almighty what he was; and informing, with very particular\nprecision, what they were who addressed him; for Wringhim's whole\nsystem of popular declamation consisted, it seems, in this--to denounce\nall men and women to destruction, and then hold out hopes to his\nadherents that they were the chosen few, included in the promises, and\nwho could never fall away. It would appear that this pharisaical\ndoctrine is a very delicious one, and the most grateful of all others\nto the worst characters.\n\nBut the ways of heaven are altogether inscrutable, and soar as far\nabove and beyond the works and the comprehensions of man as the sun,\nflaming in majesty, is above the tiny boy's evening rocket. It is the\ncontroller of Nature alone that can bring light out of darkness, and\norder out of confusion. Who is he that causeth the mole, from his\nsecret path of darkness, to throw up the gem, the gold, and the\nprecious ore? The same that from the mouths of babes and sucklings can\nextract the perfection of praise, and who can make the most abject of\nhis creatures instrumental in bringing the most hidden truths to light.\n\nMiss Logan had never lost the thought of her late master's prediction\nthat Heaven would bring to light the truth concerning the untimely\ndeath of his son. She perceived that some strange conviction, too\nhorrible for expression, preyed on his mind from the moment that the\nfatal news reached him to the last of his existence; and, in his last\nravings, he uttered some incoherent words about justification by faith\nalone and absolute and eternal predestination having been the ruin of\nhis house. These, to be sure, were the words of superannuation, and of\nthe last and severest kind of it; but, for all that, they sunk deep\ninto Miss Logan's soul, and at last she began to think with herself:\n\"Is it possible the Wringhims, and the sophisticating wretch who is in\nconjunction with them, the mother of my late beautiful and amiable\nyoung master, can have effected his destruction? If so, I will spend my\ndays, and my little patrimony, in endeavours to rake up and expose the\nunnatural deed.\"\n\nIn all her outgoings and incomings Mrs. Logan (as she was now styled)\nnever lost sight of this one object. Every new disappointment only\nwhetted her desire to fish up some particulars, concerning it; for she\nthought so long and so ardently upon it that by degrees it became\nsettled in her mind as a sealed truth. And, as woman is always most\njealous of her own sex in such matters, her suspicions were fixed on\nher greatest enemy, Mrs. Colwan, now the Lady Dowager of Dalcastle. All\nwas wrapt in a chaos of confusion and darkness; but at last, by dint of\na thousand sly and secret inquiries, Mrs. Logan found out where Lady\nDalcastle had been on the night that the murder happened, and likewise\nwhat company she had kept, as well as some of the comers and goers; and\nshe had hopes of having discovered a clue, which, if she could keep\nhold of the thread, would lead her through darkness to the light of\ntruth.\n\nReturning very late one evening from a convocation of family servants,\nwhich she had drawn together in order to fish something out of them,\nher maid having been in attendance on her all the evening, they found,\non going home, that the house had been broken and a number of valuable\narticles stolen therefrom. Mrs. Logan had grown quite heartless before\nthis stroke, having been altogether unsuccessful in her inquiries, and\nnow she began to entertain some resolutions of giving up the fruitless\nsearch.\n\nIn a few days thereafter, she received intelligence that her clothes\nand plate were mostly recovered, and that she for one was bound over to\nprosecute the depredator, provided the articles turned out to be hers,\nas libelled in the indictment, and as a king's evidence had given out.\nShe was likewise summoned, or requested, I know not which, being\nignorant of these matters, to go as far as the town of Peebles in\nTweedside, in order to survey these articles on such a day, and make\naffidavit to their identity before the Sheriff. She went accordingly;\nbut, on entering the town by the North Gate, she was accosted by a poor\ngirl in tattered apparel, who with great earnestness inquired if her\nname was not Mrs. Logan? On being answered in the affirmative, she said\nthat the unfortunate prisoner in the Tolbooth requested her, as she\nvalued all that was dear to her in life, to go and see her before she\nappeared in court at the hour of cause, as she (the prisoner) had\nsomething of the greatest moment to impart to her. Mrs. Logan's\ncuriosity was excited, and she followed the girl straight to the\nTolbooth, who by the way said to her that she would find in the\nprisoner a woman of superior mind, who had gone through all the\nvicissitudes of life. \"She has been very unfortunate, and I fear very\nwicked,\" added the poor thing, \"but she is my mother, and God knows,\nwith all her faults and failings, she has never been unkind to me. You,\nmadam, have it in your power to save her; but she has wronged you, and\ntherefore, if you will not do it for her sake, do it for mine, and the\nGod of the fatherless will reward you.\"\n\nMrs. Logan answered her with a cast of the head, and a hem! and only\nremarked, that \"the guilty must not always be suffered to escape, or\nwhat a world must we be doomed to live in!\"\n\nShe was admitted to the prison, and found a tall emaciated figure, who\nappeared to have once possessed a sort of masculine beauty in no\nordinary degree, but was now considerably advanced in years. She viewed\nMrs. Logan with a stern, steady gaze, as if reading her features as a\nmargin to her intellect; and when she addressed her it was not with\nthat humility, and agonized fervour, which are natural for one in such\ncircumstances to address to another who has the power of her life and\ndeath in her hands.\n\n\"I am deeply indebted to you for this timely visit, Mrs. Logan,\" said\nshe. \"It is not that I value life, or because I fear death, that I have\nsent for you so expressly. But the manner of the death that awaits me\nhas something peculiarly revolting in it to a female mind. Good God!\nwhen I think of being hung up, a spectacle to a gazing, gaping\nmultitude, with numbers of which I have had intimacies and connections,\nthat would render the moment of parting so hideous, that, believe me,\nit rends to flinders a soul born for another sphere than that in which\nit has moved, had not the vile selfishness of a lordly fiend ruined all\nmy prospects and all my hopes. Hear me then; for I do not ask your\npity: I only ask of you to look to yourself, and behave with womanly\nprudence; if you deny this day that these goods are yours, there is no\nother evidence whatever against my life, and it is safe for the\npresent. For, as for the word of the wretch who has betrayed me, it is\nof no avail; he has prevaricated so notoriously to save himself. If you\ndeny them, you shall have them all again to the value of a mite, and\nmore to the bargain. If you swear to the identity of them, the process\nwill, one way and another, cost you the half of what they are worth.\"\n\n\"And what security have I for that?\" said Mrs. Logan.\n\n\"You have none but my word,\" said the other proudly, \"and that never\nyet was violated. If you cannot take that, I know the worst you can do.\nBut I had forgot--I have a poor helpless child without, waiting and\nstarving about the prison door. Surely it was of her that I wished to\nspeak. This shameful death of mine will leave her in a deplorable\nstate.\"\n\n\"The girl seems to have candour and strong affections,\" said Mrs.\nLogan. \"I grievously mistake if such a child would not be a thousand\ntimes better without such a guardian and director.\"\n\n\"Then will you be so kind as to come to the Grass Market and see me put\ndown?\" said the prisoner. \"I thought a woman would estimate a woman's\nand a mother's feelings, when such a dreadful throw was at stake, at\nleast in part. But you are callous, and have never known any feelings\nbut those of subordination to your old unnatural master. Alas, I have\nno cause of offence! I have wronged you; and justice must take its\ncourse. Will you forgive me before we part?\"\n\nMrs. Logan hesitated, for her mind ran on something else. On which the\nother subjoined: \"No, you will not forgive me, I see. But you will pray\nto God to forgive me? I know you will do that.\"\n\nMrs. Logan heard not this jeer, but, looking at the prisoner with an\nabsent and stupid stare, she said: \"Did you know my late master?\"\n\n\"Ay, that I did, and never for any good,\" said she. \"I knew the old and\nthe young spark both, and was by when the latter was slain.\"\n\nThis careless sentence affected Mrs. Logan in a most peculiar manner. A\nshower of tears burst from her eyes ere it was done, and, when it was,\nshe appeared like one bereaved of her mind. She first turned one way\nand then another, as if looking for something she had dropped. She\nseemed to think she had lost her eyes, instead of her tears, and at\nlength, as by instinct, she tottered close up to the prisoner's face,\nand, looking wistfully and joyfully in it, said, with breathless\nearnestness: \"Pray, mistress, what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Arabella Calvert,\" said the other. \"Miss, mistress, or\nwidow, as you choose, for I have been all the three, and that not once\nnor twice only. Ay, and something beyond all these. But, as for you,\nyou have never been anything!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! and so you are Bell Calvert? Well, I thought so--I thought\nso,\" said Mrs. Logan; and, helping herself to a seat, she came and sat\ndown close by the prisoner's knee. \"So you are indeed Bell Calvert, so\ncalled once. Well, of all the world you are the woman whom I have\nlonged and travailed the most to see. But you were invisible; a being\nto be heard of, not seen.\"\n\n\"There have been days, madam,\" returned she, \"when I was to be seen,\nand when there were few to be seen like me. But since that time there\nhave indeed been days on which I was not to be seen. My crimes have\nbeen great, but my sufferings have been greater. So great that neither\nyou nor the world can ever either know or conceive them. I hope they\nwill be taken into account by the Most High. Mine have been crimes of\nutter desperation. But whom am I speaking to? You had better leave me\nto myself, mistress.\"\n\n\"Leave you to yourself? That I will be loth to do till you tell me\nwhere you were that night my young master was murdered.\"\n\n\"Where the devil would, I was! Will that suffice you? Ah, it was a vile\naction! A night to be remembered that was! Won't you be going? I want\nto trust my daughter with a commission.\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Calvert, you and I part not till you have divulged that\nmystery to me.\"\n\n\"You must accompany me to the other world, then, for you shall not have\nit in this.\"\n\n\"If you refuse to answer me, I can have you before a tribunal, where\nyou shall be sifted to the soul.\"\n\n\"Such miserable inanity! What care I for your threatenings of a\ntribunal? I who must soon stand before my last earthly one? What could\nthe word of such a culprit avail? Or, if it could, where is the judge\nthat could enforce it?\"\n\n\"Did you not say that there was some mode of accommodating matters on\nthat score?\"\n\n\"Yes, I prayed you to grant me my life, which is in your power. The\nsaving of it would not have cost you a plack, yet you refused to do it.\nThe taking of it will cost you a great deal, and yet to that purpose\nyou adhere. I can have no parley with such a spirit. I would not have\nmy life in a present from its motions, nor would I exchange courtesies\nwith its possessor.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mrs. Calvert, since ever we met, I have been so busy thinking\nabout who you might be that I know not what you have been proposing. I\nbelieve I meant to do what I could to save you. But, once for all, tell\nme everything that you know concerning that amiable young gentleman's\ndeath, and here is my hand there shall be nothing wanting that I can\neffect for you.\"\n\n\"No I despise all barter with such mean and selfish curiosity; and, as\nI believe that passion is stronger with you, than fear with me, we part\non equal terms. Do your worst; and my secret shall go to the gallows\nand the grave with me.\"\n\nMrs. Logan was now greatly confounded, and after proffering in vain to\nconcede everything she could ask in exchange, for the particulars\nrelating to the murder, she became the suppliant in her turn. But the\nunaccountable culprit, exulting in her advantage, laughed her to scorn;\nand finally, in a paroxysm of pride and impatience, called in the\njailor and had her expelled, ordering him in her hearing not to grant\nher admittance a second time, on any pretence.\n\nMrs. Logan was now hard put to it, and again driven almost to despair.\nShe might have succeeded in the attainment of that she thirsted for\nmost in life so easily had she known the character with which she had\nto deal. Had she known to have soothed her high and afflicted spirit:\nbut that opportunity was past, and the hour of examination at hand. She\nonce thought of going and claiming her articles, as she at first\nintended; but then, when she thought again of the Wringhims swaying it\nat Dalcastle, where she had been wont to hear them held in such\ncontempt, if not abhorrence, and perhaps of holding it by the most\ndiabolical means, she was withheld from marring the only chance that\nremained of having a glimpse into that mysterious affair.\n\nFinally, she resolved not to answer to her name in the court, rather\nthan to appear and assert a falsehood, which she might be called on to\ncertify by oath. She did so; and heard the Sheriff give orders to the\nofficers to make inquiry for Miss Logan from Edinburgh, at the various\nplaces of entertainment in town, and to expedite her arrival in court,\nas things of great value were in dependence. She also heard the man who\nhad turned king's evidence against the prisoner examined for the second\ntime, and sifted most cunningly. His answers gave anything but\nsatisfaction to the Sheriff, though Mrs. Logan believed them to be\nmainly truth. But there were a few questions and answers that struck\nher above all others.\n\n\"How long is it since Mrs. Calvert and you became acquainted?\"\n\n\"About a year and a half.\"\n\n\"State the precise time, if you please; the day, or night, according to\nyour remembrance.\"\n\n\"It was on the morning of the 28th of February, 1705.\"\n\n\"What time of the morning?\"\n\n\"Perhaps about one.\"\n\n\"So early as that? At what place did you meet then?\"\n\n\"It was at the foot of one of the north wynds of Edinburgh.\"\n\n\"Was it by appointment that you met?\"\n\n\"No, it was not.\"\n\n\"For what purpose was it then?\"\n\n\"For no purpose.\"\n\n\"How is it that you chance to remember the day and hour so minutely, if\nyou met that woman, whom you have accused, merely by chance, and for no\nmanner of purpose, as you must have met others that night, perhaps to\nthe amount of hundreds, in the same way?\"\n\n\"I have good cause to remember it, my lord.\"\n\n\"What was that cause?--No answer?--You don't choose to say what that\ncause was?\"\n\n\"I am not at liberty to tell.\"\n\nThe Sheriff then descended to other particulars, all of which tended to\nprove that the fellow was an accomplished villain, and that the\nprincipal share of the atrocities had been committed by him. Indeed the\nSheriff hinted that he suspected the only share Mrs. Calvert had in\nthem was in being too much in his company, and too true to him. The\ncase was remitted to the Court of Justiciary;  but Mrs. Logan had heard\nenough to convince her that the culprits first met at the very spot,\nand the very hour, on which George Colwan was slain; and she had no\ndoubt that they were incendiaries set on by his mother, to forward her\nown and her darling son's way to opulence. Mrs. Logan was wrong, as\nwill appear in the sequel; but her antipathy to Mrs. Colwan made her\nwatch the event with all care. She never quitted Peebles as long as\nBell Calvert remained there, and, when she was removed to Edinburgh,\nthe other followed. When the trial came on, Mrs. Logan and her maid\nwere again summoned as witnesses before the jury, and compelled by the\nprosecutor for the Crown to appear.\n\nThe maid was first called; and, when she came into the witness box, the\nanxious and hopeless looks of the prisoner were manifest to all. But\nthe girl, whose name, she said, was Bessy Gillies, answered in so\nflippant and fearless a way that the auditors were much amused. After a\nnumber of routine questions, the depute-advocate asked her if she was\nat home on the morning of the fifth of September last, when her\nmistress's house was robbed.\n\n\"Was I at hame, say ye? Na, faith-ye, lad! An' I had been at hame,\nthere had been mair to dee. I wad hae raised sic a yelloch!\"\n\n\"Where were you that morning?\"\n\n\"Where was I, say you? I was in the house where my mistress was,\nsitting dozing an' half sleeping in the kitchen. I thought aye she\nwould be setting out every minute, for twa hours.\"\n\n\"And, when you went home, what did you find?\"\n\n\"What found we? Be my sooth, we found a broken lock, an' toom kists.\"\n\n\"Relate some of the particulars, if you please.\"\n\n\"Sir, the thieves didna stand upon particulars: they were halesale\ndealers in a' our best wares.\"\n\n\"I mean, what passed between your mistress and you on the occasion?\"\n\n\"What passed, say ye? O, there wasna muckle: I was in a great passion,\nbut she was dung doitrified a wee. When she gaed to put the key i' the\ndoor, up it flew to the fer wa'. 'Bless ye, jaud, what's the meaning o'\nthis?' quo she. 'Ye hae left the door open, ye tawpie!' quo she. 'The\nne'er o' that I did,' quo I, 'or may my shakel bane never turn another\nkey.' When we got the candle lightit, a' the house was in a hoad-road.\n'Bessy, my woman,' quo she, 'we are baith ruined and undone creatures.'\n'The deil a bit,' quo I; 'that I deny positively.' H'mh! to speak o' a\nlass o' my age being ruined and undone! I never had muckle except what\nwas within a good jerkin, an' let the thief ruin me there wha can.\"\n\n\"Do you remember aught else that your mistress said on the occasion?\nDid you hear her blame any person?\"\n\n\"O, she made a gread deal o' grumphing an' groaning about the\nmisfortune, as she ca'd it, an' I think she said it was a part o' the\nruin, wrought by the Ringans, or some sic name. 'They'll hae't a'!\nThey'll hae't a'!' cried she, wringing her hands; 'a'! they'll hae' a',\nan' hell wi't, an' they'll get them baith.' 'Aweel, that's aye some\nsatisfaction,' quo I.\"\n\n\"Whom did she mean by the Ringans, do you know?\"\n\n\"I fancy they are some creatures that she has dreamed about, for I\nthink there canna be as ill folks living as she ca's them.\"\n\n\"Did you never hear say that the prisoner at the bar there, Mrs.\nCalvert, or Bell Calvert, was the robber of her house; or that she was\none of the Ringans?\"\n\n\"Never. Somebody tauld her lately that ane Bell Calvert robbed her\nhouse, but she disna believe it. Neither do I.\"\n\n\"What reasons have you for doubting it?\"\n\n\"Because it was nae woman's fingers that broke up the bolts an' the\nlocks that were torn open that night.\"\n\n\"Very pertinent, Bessy. Come then within the bar, and look, at these\narticles on the table. Did you ever see these silver spoons before?\"\n\n\"I hae seen some very like them, and whaever has seen siller spoons has\ndone the same.\"\n\n\"Can you swear you never saw them before?\"\n\n\"Na, na, I wadna swear to ony siller spoons that ever war made, unless\nI had put a private mark on them wi' my ain hand, an' that's what I\nnever did to ane.\"\n\n\"See, they are all marked with a C.\"\n\n\"Sae are a' the spoons in Argyle, an' the half o' them in Edinburgh I\nthink. A C is a very common letter, an' so are a' the names that begin\nwi't. Lay them by, lay them by, an' gie the poor woman her spoons\nagain. They are marked wi' her ain name, an' I hae little doubt they\nare hers, an' that she has seen better days.\"\n\n\"Ah, God bless her heart!\" sighed the prisoner; and that blessing was\nechoed in the breathings of many a feeling breast.\n\n\"Did you ever see this gown before, think you?\"\n\n\"I hae seen ane very like it.\"\n\n\"Could you not swear that gown was your mistress's once?\"\n\n\"No, unless I saw her hae't on, an' kend that she had paid for't. I am\nvery scrupulous about an oath. Like is an ill mark. Sae ill indeed that\nI wad hardly swear to anything.\"\n\n\"But you say that gown is very like one your mistress used to wear.\"\n\n\"I never said sic a thing. It is like one I hae seen her hae out airing\non the hay raip i' the back green. It is very like ane I hae seen Mrs.\nButler in the Grass Market wearing too: I rather think it is the same.\nBless you, sir, I wadna swear to my ain forefinger, if it had been as\nlang out o' my sight an', brought in an' laid on that table.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are not aware, girl, that this scrupulousness of yours is\nlikely to thwart the purposes of justice, and bereave your mistress of\nproperty to the amount of a thousand merks.\" (From the Judge.)\n\n\"I canna help that, my lord: that's her look-out. For my part, I am\nresolved to keep a clear conscience, till I be married, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Look over these things and see if there is any one article among them\nwhich you can fix on as the property of your mistress.\"\n\n\"No ane o' them, sir, no ane o' them. An oath is an awfu' thing,\nespecially when it is for life or death. Gie the poor woman her things\nagain, an' let my mistress pick up the next she finds: that's my\nadvice.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Logan came into the box, the prisoner groaned and laid down\nher head. But how she was astonished when she heard her deliver herself\nsomething to the following purport--That, whatever penalties she was\ndoomed to abide, she was determined she would not bear witness against\na woman's life, from a certain conviction that it could not be a woman\nwho broke her house. \"I have no doubt that I may find some of my own\nthings there,\" added she, \"but, if they were found in her possession,\nshe has been made a tool, or the dupe, of an infernal set, who shall be\nnameless here. I believe she did not rob me, and for that reason I will\nhave no hand in her condemnation.\"\n\nThe judge: \"This is the most singular perversion I have ever witnessed.\nMrs. Logan, I entertain strong suspicions that the prisoner, or her\nagents, have made some agreement with you on this matter to prevent the\ncourse of justice.\"\n\n\"So far from that, my lord, I went into the jail at Peebles to this\nwoman, whom I had never seen before, and proffered to withdraw my part\nin the prosecution, as well as my evidence, provided she would tell me\na few simple facts; but she spurned at my offer, and had me turned\ninsolently out of the prison, with orders to the jailor never to admit\nme again on any pretence.\"\n\nThe prisoner's counsel, taking hold of this evidence, addressed the\njury with great fluency; and, finally, the prosecution was withdrawn,\nand the prisoner dismissed from the bar, with a severe reprimand for\nher past conduct, and an exhortation to keep better company.\n\nIt was not many days till a caddy came with a large parcel to Mrs.\nLogan's house, which parcel he delivered into her hands, accompanied\nwith a sealed note, containing an inventory of the articles, and a\nrequest to know if the unfortunate Arabella Calvert would be admitted\nto converse with Mrs. Logan.\n\nNever was there a woman so much overjoyed as Mrs. Logan was at this\nmessage. She returned compliments. Would be most happy to see her; and\nno article of the parcel should be looked at, or touched, till her\narrival. It was not long till she made her appearance, dressed in\nsomewhat better style than she had yet seen her; delivered her over the\ngreater part of the stolen property, besides many things that either\nnever had belonged to Mrs. Logan or that she thought proper to deny in\norder that the other might retain them.\n\nThe tale that she told of her misfortunes was of the most distressing\nnature, and was enough to stir up all the tender, as well as abhorrent\nfeelings in the bosom of humanity. She had suffered every deprivation\nin fame, fortune, and person. She had been imprisoned; she had been\nscourged, and branded as an impostor; and all on account of her\nresolute and unmoving fidelity and truth to several of the very worst\nof men, every one of whom had abandoned her to utter destitution and\nshame. But this story we cannot enter on at present, as it would\nperhaps mar the thread of our story, as much as it did the anxious\nanticipations of Mrs. Logan, who sat pining and longing for the\nrelation that follows.\n\n\"Now I know, Mrs. Logan, that you are expecting a detail of the\ncircumstances relating to the death of Mr. George Colwan; and, in\ngratitude for your unbounded generosity and disinterestedness, I will\ntell you all that I know, although, for causes that will appear obvious\nto you, I had determined never in life to divulge one circumstance of\nit. I can tell you, however, that you will be disappointed, for it was\nnot the gentleman who was accused, found guilty, and would have\nsuffered the utmost penalty of the law had he not made his escape. It\nwas not he, I say, who slew your young master, nor had he any hand in\nit.\"\n\n\"I never thought he had. But, pray, how do you come to know this?\"\n\n\"You shall hear. I had been abandoned in York by an artful and\nconsummate fiend; and found guilty of being art and part concerned in\nthe most heinous atrocities, and, in his place, suffered what I yet\nshudder to think of I was banished the county, begged my way with my\npoor outcast child up to Edinburgh, and was there obliged, for the\nsecond time in my life, to betake myself to the most degrading of all\nmeans to support two wretched lives. I hired a dress, and betook me,\nshivering, to the High Street, too well aware that my form and\nappearance would soon draw me suitors enow at that throng and\nintemperate time of the Parliament. On my very first stepping out to\nthe street, a party of young gentlemen was passing. I heard by the\nnoise they made, and the tenor of their speech, that they were more\nthen mellow, and so I resolved to keep near them, in order, if\npossible, to make some of them my prey. But, just as one of them began\nto eye me, I was rudely thrust into a narrow close by one of the\nguardsmen. I had heard to what house the party was bound, for the men\nwere talking exceedingly loud, and making no secret of it: so I hasted\ndown the close, and round below to the one where their rendezvous was\nto be; but I was too late, they were all housed and the door bolted. I\nresolved to wait, thinking they could not all stay long; but I was\nperishing with famine, and was like to fall down. The moon shone as\nbright as day, and I perceived, by a sign at the bottom of the close,\nthat there was a small tavern of a certain description up two stairs\nthere. I went up and called, telling the mistress of the house my plan.\nShe approved of it mainly, and offered me her best apartment, provided\nI could get one of these noble mates to accompany me. She abused Lucky\nSudds, as she called her, at the inn where the party was, envying her\nhuge profits, no doubt, and giving me afterwards something to drink for\nwhich I really felt exceedingly grateful in my need. I stepped\ndownstairs in order to be on the alert. The moment that I reached the\nground, the door of Lucky Sudds' house opened and shut, and down came\nthe Honourable Thomas Drummond, with hasty and impassioned strides, his\nsword rattling at his heel. I accosted him in a soft and soothing tone.\nHe was taken with my address; for he instantly stood still and gazed\nintently at me, then at the place, and then at me again. I beckoned him\nto follow me, which he did without further ceremony, and we soon found\nourselves together in the best room of a house where everything was\nwretched. He still looked about him, and at me; but all this while he\nhad never spoken a word. At length, I asked if he would take any\nrefreshment? 'If you please,'  said he. I asked what he would have, but\nhe only answered, 'Whatever you choose, madam.' If he was taken with my\naddress, I was much more taken with his; for he was a complete\ngentleman, and a gentleman will ever act as one. At length, he began as\nfollows:\n\n\"'I am utterly at a loss to account for this adventure, madam. It seems\nto me like enchantment, and I can hardly believe my senses. An English\nlady, I judge, and one, who from her manner and address should belong\nto the first class of society, in such a place as this, is indeed\nmatter of wonder to me. At the foot of a close in Edinburgh! and at\nthis time of the night! Surely it must have been no common reverse of\nfortune that reduced you to this?' I wept, or pretended to do so; on\nwhich he added, 'Pray, madam, take heart. Tell me what has befallen\nyou; and if I can do anything for you, in restoring you to your country\nor your friends, you shall command my interest.'\n\n\"I had great need of a friend then, and I thought now was the time to\nsecure one. So I began and told him the moving tale I have told you.\nBut I soon perceived that I had kept by the naked truth too\nunvarnishedly, and thereby quite overshot my mark. When he learned that\nhe was sitting in a wretched corner of an irregular house, with a\nfelon, who had so lately been scourged and banished as a swindler and\nimpostor, his modest nature took the alarm, and he was shocked, instead\nof being moved with pity. His eye fixed on some of the casual stripes\non my arm, and from that moment he became restless and impatient to be\ngone. I tried some gentle arts to retain him, but in vain; so, after\npaying both the landlady and me for pleasures he had neither tasted nor\nasked, he took his leave.\n\n\"I showed him downstairs; and, just as he turned the corner of the next\nland, a man came rushing violently by him; exchanged looks with him,\nand came running up to me. He appeared in great agitation, and was\nquite out of breath; and, taking my hand in his, we ran upstairs\ntogether without speaking, and were instantly in the apartment I had\nleft, where a stoup of wine still stood untasted. 'Ah, this is\nfortunate!' said my new spark, and helped himself. In the meanwhile, as\nour apartment was a corner one, and looked both east and north, I ran\nto the eastern casement to look after Drummond. Now, note me well: I\nsaw him going eastward in his tartans and bonnet, and the gilded hilt\nof his claymore glittering in the moon; and, at the very same time, I\nsaw two men, the one in black, and the other likewise in tartans,\ncoming towards the steps from the opposite bank, by the foot of the\nloch; and I saw Drummond and they eyeing each other as they passed. I\nkept view of him till he vanished towards Leith Wynd, and by that time\nthe two strangers had come close up under our window. This is what I\nwish you to pay particular attention to. I had only lost sight of\nDrummond (who had given me his name and address) for the short space of\ntime that we took in running up one pair of short stairs; and during\nthat space he had halted a moment, for, when I got my eye on him again,\nhe had not crossed the mouth of the next entry, nor proceeded above ten\nor twelve paces, and, at the same time, I saw the two men coming down\nthe bank on the opposite side of the loch, at about three hundred\npaces' distance. Both he and they were distinctly in my view, and never\nwithin speech of each other, until he vanished into one of the wynds\nleading towards the bottom of the High Street, at which precise time\nthe two strangers came below my window; so that it was quite clear he\nneither could be one of them nor have any communication with them.\n\n\"Yet, mark me again; for, of all things I have ever seen, this was the\nmost singular. When I looked down at the two strangers, one of them was\nextremely like Drummond. So like was he that there was not one item in\ndress, form, feature, nor voice, by which I could distinguish the one\nfrom the other. I was certain it was not he, because I had seen the one\ngoing and the other approaching at the same time, and my impression at\nthe moment was that I looked upon some spirit, or demon, in his\nlikeness. I felt a chillness creep all round my heart, my knees\ntottered, and, withdrawing my head from the open casement that lay in\nthe dark shade, I said to the man who was with me, 'Good God, what is\nthis?'\n\n\"'What is it, my dear?' said he, as much alarmed as I was.\n\n\"'As I live, there stands an apparition!' said I.\n\n\"He was not so much afraid when he heard me say so, and, peeping\ncautiously out, he looked and listened awhile, and then, drawing back,\nhe said in a whisper, 'They are both living men, and one of them is he\nI passed at the corner.'\n\n\"'That he is not,' said I, emphatically. 'To that I will make oath.'\n\n\"He smiled and shook his head, and then added, 'I never then saw a man\nbefore, whom I could not know again, particularly if he was the very\nlast I had seen. But what matters it whether it be or not? As it is no\nconcern of ours, let us sit down and enjoy ourselves.'\n\n'But it does matter a very great deal with me, sir,' said I. 'Bless me,\nmy head is giddy--my breath quite gone, and I feel as if I were\nsurrounded with fiends. Who are you, sir?'\n\n'You shall know that ere we two part, my love,'  said he. 'I cannot\nconceive why the return of this young gentleman to the spot he so\nlately left should discompose you. I suppose he got a glance of you as\nhe passed, and has returned to look after you, and that is the whole\nsecret of the matter.'\n\n\"'If you will be so civil as to walk out and join him then, it will\noblige me hugely,' said I, 'for I never in my life experienced such\nboding apprehensions of evil company. I cannot conceive how you should\ncome up here without asking my permission. Will it please you to be\ngone, sir?' I was within an ace of prevailing. He took out his purse--I\nneed not say more--I was bribed to let him remain. Ah, had I kept my\nfrail resolution of dismissing him at that moment, what a world of\nshame and misery had been evited! But that, though uppermost still in\nmy mind, has nothing ado here.\n\n\"When I peeped over again, the two men were disputing in a whisper, the\none of them in violent agitation and terror, and the other upbraiding\nhim, and urging him on to some desperate act. At length I heard the\nyoung man in the Highland garb say indignantly, 'Hush, recreant! It is\nGod's work which you are commissioned to execute, and it must be done.\nBut, if you positively decline it, I will do it myself, and do you\nbeware of the consequences.'\n\n\"'Oh, I will, I will!' cried the other in black clothes, in a wretched\nbeseeching tone. 'You shall instruct me in this, as in all things else.'\n\n\"I thought all this while I was closely concealed from them, and\nwondered not a little when he in tartans gave me a sly nod, as much as\nto say, 'What do you think of this?' or, 'Take note of what you see,'\nor something to that effect; from which I perceived that, whatever he\nwas about, he did not wish it to be kept a secret. For all that, I was\nimpressed with a terror and anxiety that I could not overcome, but it\nonly made me mark every event with the more intense curiosity. The\nHighlander, whom I still could not help regarding as the evil genius of\nThomas Drummond, performed every action as with the quickness of\nthought. He concealed the youth in black in a narrow entry, a little to\nthe westward of my windows, and, as he was leading him across the\nmoonlight green by the shoulder, I perceived, for the first time, that\nboth of them were armed with rapiers. He pushed him without resistance\ninto the dark shaded close, made another signal to me, and hasted up\nthe close to Lucky Sudds' door. The city and the morning were so still\nthat I heard every word that was uttered, on putting my head out a\nlittle. He knocked at the door sharply, and, after waiting a\nconsiderable space, the bolt was drawn, and the door, as I conceived,\nedged up as far as the massy chain would let it. 'Is young Dalcastle\nstill in the house?' said he sharply.\n\n\"I did not hear the answer, but I heard him say, shortly after, 'If he\nis, pray tell him to speak with me for a few minutes.' He then withdrew\nfrom the door, and came slowly down the close, in a lingering manner,\nlooking oft behind him. Dalcastle came out; advanced a few steps after\nhim, and then stood still, as if hesitating whether or not he should\ncall out a friend to accompany him; and that instant the door behind\nhim was closed, chained, and the iron bolt drawn; on hearing of which,\nhe followed his adversary without further hesitation. As he passed\nbelow my window, I heard him say, 'I beseech you, Tom, let us do\nnothing in this matter rashly'; but I could not hear the answer of the\nother, who had turned the corner.\n\n\"I roused up my drowsy companion, who was leaning on the bed, and we\nboth looked together from the north window. We were in the shade, but\nthe moon shone full on the two young gentlemen. Young Dalcastle was\nvisibly the worse of liquor, and, his back being turned towards us, he\nsaid something to the other which I could not make out, although he\nspoke a considerable time, and, from his tones and gestures, appeared\nto be reasoning.\n\n\"When he had done, the tall young man in the tartans drew his sword,\nand, his face being straight to us, we heard him say distinctly, 'No\nmore words about it, George, if you please; but if you be a man, as I\ntake you to be, draw your sword, and let us settle it here.'\n\n\"Dalcastle drew his sword, without changing his attitude; but he spoke\nwith more warmth, for we heard his words, 'Think you that I fear you,\nTom? Be assured, Sir, I would not fear ten of the best of your name, at\neach other's backs: all that I want is to have friends with us to see\nfair play, for, if you close with me, you are a dead man.'\n\n\"The other stormed at these words. 'You are a braggart, Sir,' cried he,\n'a wretch--a blot on the cheek of nature--a blight on the Christian\nworld--a reprobate--I'll have your soul, Sir. You must play at tennis,\nand put down elect brethren in another world to-morrow.' As he said\nthis, he brandished his rapier, exciting Dalcastle to offence. He\ngained his point. The latter, who had previously drawn, advanced upon\nhis vapouring and licentious antagonist, and a fierce combat ensued. My\ncompanion was delighted beyond measure, and I could not keep him from\nexclaiming, loud enough to have been heard, 'That's grand! That's\nexcellent!' For me, my heart quaked like an aspen. Young Dalcastle\neither had a decided advantage over his adversary, or else the other\nthought proper to let him have it; for he shifted, and swore, and\nflitted from Dalcastle's thrusts like a shadow, uttering ofttimes a\nsarcastic laugh, that seemed to provoke the other beyond all bearing.\nAt one time, he would spring away to a great distance, then advance\nagain on young Dalcastle with the swiftness of lightning. But that\nyoung hero always stood his ground, and repelled the attack: he never\ngave way, although they fought nearly twice round the bleaching green,\nwhich you know is not a very small one. At length they fought close up\nto the mouth of the dark entry, where the fellow in black stood all\nthis while concealed, and then the combatant in tartans closed with his\nantagonist, or pretended to do so; but, the moment they began to\ngrapple, he wheeled about, turning Colwan's back towards the entry, and\nthen cried out, 'Ah, hell has it! My friend, my friend!'\n\n\"That moment the fellow in black rushed from his cover with his drawn\nrapier, and gave the brave young Dalcastle two deadly wounds in the\nback, as quick as arm could thrust, both of which I thought pierced\nthrough his body. He fell, and, rolling himself on his back, he\nperceived who it was that had slain him thus foully, and said, with a\ndying emphasis, which I never heard equalled, 'oh, dog of hell, it is\nyou who has done this!'\n\n\"He articulated some more, which I could not hear for other sounds;\nfor, the moment that the man in black inflicted the deadly wound, my\ncompanion called out, 'That's unfair, you rip! That's damnable! to\nstrike a brave fellow behind! One at a time, you cowards!' etc., to all\nwhich the unnatural fiend in the tartans answered with a loud exulting\nlaugh; and then, taking the poor paralysed murderer by the bow of the\narm, he hurried him in the dark entry once more, where I lost sight of\nthem for ever.\"\n\nBefore this time Mrs. Logan had risen up; and, when the narrator had\nfinished, she was standing with her arms stretched upwards at their\nfull length, and her visage turned down, on which were portrayed the\nlines of the most absolute horror. \"The dark suspicions of my late\nbenefactor have been just, and his last prediction is fulfilled,\" cried\nshe. \"The murderer of the accomplished George Colwan has been his own\nbrother, set on, there is little doubt, by her who bare them both, and\nher directing angel, the self-justified bigot. Aye, and yonder they\nsit, enjoying the luxuries so dearly purchased, with perfect impunity!\nIf the Almighty do not hurl them down, blasted with shame and\nconfusion, there is no hope of retribution in this life. And, by His\nmight, I will be the agent to accomplish it! Why did the man not pursue\nthe foul murderers? Why did he not raise the alarm, and call the watch?\"\n\n\"He? The wretch! He durst not move from the shelter he had obtained.\nNo, not for the soul of him. He was pursued for his life, at the moment\nwhen he first flew into my arms. But I did not know it;  no, I did not\nthen know him. May the curse of heaven, and the blight of hell, settle\non the detestable wretch! He pursue for the sake of justice! No; his\nefforts have all been for evil, but never for good. But I raised the\nalarm; miserable and degraded as I was, I pursued and raised the watch\nmyself. Have you not heard the name of Bell Calvert coupled with that\nhideous and mysterious affair?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. In secret often I have heard it. But how came it that you\ncould never be found? How came it that you never appeared in defence of\nthe Honourable Thomas Drummond; you, the only person who could have\njustified him?\"\n\n\"I could not, for I then fell under the power and guidance of a wretch\nwho durst not for the soul of him be brought forward in the affair.\nAnd, what was worse, his evidence would have overborne mine, for he\nwould have sworn that the man who called out and fought Colwan was the\nsame he met leaving my apartment, and there was an end of it. And,\nmoreover, it is well known that this same man--this wretch of whom I\nspeak, never mistook one man for another in his life, which makes the\nmystery of the likeness between this incendiary and Drummond the more\nextraordinary.\"\n\n\"If it was Drummond, after all that you have asserted, then are my\nsurmises still wrong.\"\n\n\"There is nothing of which I can be more certain than that it was not\nDrummond. We have nothing on earth but our senses to depend upon. If\nthese deceive us, what are we to do? I own I cannot account for it; nor\never shall be able to account for it as long as I live.\"\n\n\"Could you know the man in black, if you saw him again?\"\n\n\"I think I could, if I saw him walk or run: his gait was very\nparticular. He walked as if he had been flat-soled, and his legs made\nof steel, without any joints in his feet or ankles.\"\n\n\"The very same! The very same! The very same! Pray will you take a few\ndays' journey into the country with me, to look at such a man?\"\n\n\"You have preserved my life, and for you I will do anything. I will\naccompany you with pleasure: and I think I can say that I will know\nhim, for his form left an impression on my heart not soon to be\neffaced. But of this I am sure, that my unworthy companion will\nrecognize him, and that he will be able to swear to his identity every\nday as long as he lives.\"\n\n\"Where is he? Where is he? Oh! Mrs. Calvert, where is he?\"\n\n\"Where is he? He is the wretch whom you heard giving me up to the\ndeath; who, after experiencing every mark of affection that a poor\nruined being could confer, and after committing a thousand atrocities\nof which she was ignorant, became an informer to save his diabolical\nlife, and attempted to offer up mine as a sacrifice for all. We will go\nby ourselves first, and I will tell you if it is necessary to send any\nfarther.\"\n\nThe two dames, the very next morning, dressed themselves like country\ngoodwives, and, hiring two stout ponies furnished with pillions, they\ntook their journey westward, and the second evening after leaving\nEdinburgh they arrived at the village about two miles below Dalcastle,\nwhere they alighted. But Mrs. Logan, being anxious to have Mrs.\nCalvert's judgment, without either hint or preparation, took care not\nto mention that they were so near to the end of their journey. In\nconformity with this plan, she said, after they had sat a while:\n\"Heigh-ho, but I am weary! What, suppose we should rest a day here\nbefore we proceed farther on our journey?\"\n\nMrs. Calvert was leaning on the casement and looking out when her\ncompanion addressed these words to her, and by far too much engaged to\nreturn any answer, for her eyes were riveted on two young men who\napproached from the farther end of the village; and at length, turning\nround her head, she said, with the most intense interest, \"Proceed\nfarther on our journey, did you say? That we need not do; for, as I\nlive, here comes the very man!\"\n\nMrs. Logan ran to the window, and, behold, there was indeed Robert\nWringhim Colwan (now the Laird of Dalcastle) coming forward almost\nbelow their window, walking arm in arm with another young man; and, as\nthe two passed, the latter looked up and made a sly signal to the two\ndames, biting his lip, winking with his left eye, and nodding his head.\nMrs. Calvert was astonished at this recognizance, the young man's\nformer companion having made exactly such another signal on the night\nof the duel, by the light of the moon; and it struck her, moreover,\nthat she had somewhere seen this young man's face before. She looked\nafter him, and he winked over his shoulder to her; but she was\nprevented from returning his salute by her companion, who uttered a\nloud cry, between a groan and shriek, and fell down on the floor with a\nrumble like a wall that had suddenly been undermined. She had fainted\nquite away, and required all her companion's attention during the\nremainder of the evening, for she had scarcely ever well recovered out\nof one fit before she fell into another, and in the short intervals she\nraved like one distracted or in a dream. After falling into a sound\nsleep by night, she recovered her equanimity, and the two began to\nconverse seriously on what they had seen. Mrs. Calvert averred that the\nyoung man who passed next to the window was the very man who stabbed\nGeorge Colwan in the back, and she said she was willing to take her\noath on it at any time when required, and was certain, if the wretch\nRidsley saw him, that he would make oath to the same purport, for that\nhis walk was so peculiar no one of common discernment could mistake it.\n\nMrs. Logan was in great agitation, and said: \"It is what I have\nsuspected all along, and what I am sure my late master and benefactor\nwas persuaded of, and the horror of such an idea cut short his days.\nThat wretch, Mrs. Calvert, is the born brother of him he murdered, sons\nof the same mother they were, whether or not of the same father, the\nLord only knows. But, Oh, Mrs. Calvert, that is not the main thing that\nhas discomposed me, and shaken my nerves to pieces at this time. Who do\nyou think the young man was who walked in his company to-night?\"\n\n\"I cannot for my life recollect, but am convinced I have seen the same\nfine form and face before.\"\n\n\"And did not he seem to know us, Mrs. Calvert? You who are able to\nrecollect things as they happened, did he not seem to recollect us, and\nmake signs to that effect?\"\n\n\"He did, indeed, and apparently with great good humour.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs Calvert, hold me, else I shall fall into hysterics again! Who\nis he? Who is he? Tell me who you suppose he is, for I cannot say my\nown thought.\"\n\n\"On my life, I cannot remember.\"\n\n\"Did you note the appearance of the young gentleman you saw slain that\nnight? Do you recollect aught of the appearance of my young master,\nGeorge Colwan?\"\n\nMrs. Calvert sat silent, and stared the other mildly in the face. Their\nlooks encountered, and there was an unearthly amazement that gleamed\nfrom each, which, meeting together, caught real fire, and returned the\nflame to their heated imaginations, till the two associates became like\ntwo statues, with their hands spread, their eyes fixed, and their chops\nfallen down upon their bosoms. An old woman who kept the lodging-house,\nhaving been called in before when Mrs. Logan was faintish, chanced to\nenter at this crisis with some cordial; and, seeing the state of her\nlodgers, she caught the infection, and fell into the same rigid and\nstatue-like appearance. No scene more striking was ever exhibited; and\nif Mrs. Calvert had not resumed strength of mind to speak, and break\nthe spell, it is impossible to say how long it might have continued.\n\"It is he, I believe,\" said she, uttering the words as it were\ninwardly. \"It can be none other but he. But, no, it is impossible! I\nsaw him stabbed through and through the heart; I saw him roll backward\non the green in his own blood, utter his last words, and groan away his\nsoul. Yet, if it is not he, who can it be?\"\n\n\"It is he!\" cried Mrs. Logan, hysterically.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it is he!\" cried the landlady, in unison.\n\n\"It is who?\" said Mrs. Calvert. \"Whom do you mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know! I don't know! I was affrighted.\"\n\n\"Hold your peace then till you recover your senses, and tell me, if you\ncan, who that young gentleman is who keeps company with the new Laird\nof Dalcastle?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is he! It is he!\" screamed Mrs. Logan, wringing her hands.\n\n\"Oh, it is he! It is he!\" cried the landlady, wringing hers.\n\nMrs. Calvert turned the latter gently and civilly out of the apartment,\nobserving that there seemed to be some infection in the air of the\nroom, and she would be wise for herself to keep out of it.\n\nThe two dames had a restless and hideous night. Sleep came not to their\nrelief, for their conversation was wholly about the dead, who seemed to\nbe alive, and their minds were wandering and groping in a chaos of\nmystery. \"Did you attend to his corpse, and know that he positively\ndied and was buried?\" said Mrs. Calvert.\n\n\"Oh, yes, from the moment that his fair but mangled corpse was brought\nhome, I attended it till that when it was screwed in the coffin. I\nwashed the long stripes of blood from his lifeless form, on both sides\nof the body. I bathed the livid wound that passed through his generous\nand gentle heart. There was one through the flesh of his left side too,\nwhich had bled most outwardly of them all. I bathed them, and bandaged\nthem up with wax and perfumed ointment, but still the blood oozed\nthrough all, so that when he was laid in the coffin he was like one\nnewly murdered. My brave, my generous young master. He was always as a\nson to me, and no son was ever more kind or more respectful to a\nmother. But he was butchered--he was cut off from the earth ere he had\nwell reached to manhood--most barbarously and unfairly slain. And how\nis it, how can it be, that we again see him here, walking arm in arm\nwith his murderer?\"\n\n\"The thing cannot be, Mrs. Logan. It is a phantasy of our disturbed\nimaginations, therefore let us compose ourselves till we investigate\nthis matter farther.\"\n\n\"It cannot be in nature, that is quite clear,\" said Mrs. Logan. \"Yet\nhow it should be that I should think so--I who knew and nursed him from\nhis infancy--there lies the paradox. As you said once before, we have\nnothing but our senses to depend on, and, if you and I believe that we\nsee a person, why, we do see him. Whose word, or whose reasoning can\nconvince us against our own senses? We will disguise ourselves as poor\nwomen selling a few country wares, and we will go up to the Hall, and\nsee what is to see, and hear what we can hear, for this is a weighty\nbusiness in which we are engaged, namely, to turn the vengeance of the\nlaw upon an unnatural monster; and we will further learn, if we can,\nwho this is that accompanies him.\"\n\nMrs. Calvert acquiesced, and the two dames took their way to Dalcastle,\nwith baskets well furnished with trifles. They did not take the common\npath from the village, but went about, and approached the mansion by a\ndifferent way. But it seemed as if some overruling power ordered it\nthat they should miss no chance of attaining the information they\nwanted. For ere ever they came within half a mile of Dalcastle they\nperceived the two youths coming as to meet them, on the same path. The\nroad leading from Dalcastle towards the north-east, as all the country\nknows, goes along a dark bank of brush-wood called the Bogle-heuch. It\nwas by this track that the two women were going, and, when they\nperceived the two gentlemen meeting them, they turned back, and, the\nmoment they were out of their sight, they concealed themselves in a\nthicket close by the road. They did this because Mrs. Logan was\nterrified for being discovered, and because they wished to reconnoitre\nwithout being seen. Mrs. Calvert now charged her, whatever she saw, or\nwhatever she heard, to put on a resolution, and support it, for if she\nfainted there and was discovered, what was to become of her!\n\nThe two young men came on, in earnest and vehement conversation; but\nthe subject they were on was a terrible one, and hardly fit to be\nrepeated in the face of a Christian community. Wringhim was disputing\nthe boundlessness of the true Christian's freedom, and expressing\ndoubts that, chosen as he knew he was from all eternity, still it might\nbe possible for him to commit acts that would exclude him from the\nlimits of the covenant. The other argued, with mighty fluency, that the\nthing was utterly impossible, and altogether inconsistent with eternal\npredestination. The arguments of the latter prevailed, and the laird\nwas driven to sullen silence. But, to the women's utter surprise, as\nthe conquering disputant passed, he made a signal of recognizance\nthrough the brambles to them, as formerly, and, that he might expose\nhis associate fully, and in his true colours, he led him backwards\nand forwards by the women more than twenty times, making him to confess\nboth the crimes that he had done and those he had in contemplation. At\nlength he said to him: \"Assuredly I saw some strolling vagrant women on\nthis walk, my dear friend: I wish we could find them, for there is\nlittle doubt that they are concealed here in your woods.\"\n\n\"I wish we could find them,\" answered Wringhim. \"We would have fine\nsport maltreating and abusing them.\"\n\n\"That we should, that we should! Now tell me, Robert, if you found a\nmalevolent woman, the latent enemy of your prosperity, lurking in these\nwoods to betray you, what would you inflict on her?\"\n\n\"I would tear her to pieces with my dogs, and feed them with her flesh.\nOh, my dear friend, there is an old strumpet who lived with my\nunnatural father, whom I hold in such utter detestation that I stand\nconstantly in dread of her, and would sacrifice the half of my estate\nto shed her blood!\"\n\n\"What will you give me if I will put her in your power, and give you a\nfair and genuine excuse for making away with her; one for which you\nshall answer at the bar, here or hereafter?\"\n\n\"I should like to see the vile hag put down. She is in possession of\nthe family plate, that is mine by right, as well as a thousand valuable\nrelics, and great riches besides, all of which the old profligate\ngifted shamefully away. And it is said, besides all these, that she has\nsworn my destruction.\"\n\n\"She has, she has. But I see not how she can accomplish that, seeing\nthe deed was done so suddenly, and in the silence of the night.\"\n\n\"It was said there were some onlookers. But where shall we find that\ndisgraceful Miss Logan?\"\n\n\"I will show you her by and by. But will you then consent to the other\nmeritorious deed? Come, be a man, and throw away scruples.\"\n\n\"If you can convince me that the promise is binding I will.\"\n\n\"Then step this way, till I give you a piece of information.\"\n\nThey walked a little way out of hearing, but went not out of sight;\ntherefore, though the women were in a terrible quandary, they durst not\nstir, for they had some hopes that this extraordinary person was on a\nmission of the same sort with themselves, knew of them, and was going\nto make use of their testimony. Mrs. Logan was several times on the\npoint of falling into a swoon, so much did the appearance of the young\nman impress her, until her associate covered her face that she might\nlisten without embarrassment. But this latter dialogue roused different\nfeelings within them; namely, those arising from imminent personal\ndanger. They saw his waggish associate point out the place of their\nconcealment to Wringhim, who came towards them, out of curiosity to see\nwhat his friend meant by what he believed to be a joke, manifestly\nwithout crediting it in the least degree. When he came running away,\nthe other called after him: \"If she is too hard for you, call to me.\"\nAs he said this, he hasted out of sight, in the contrary direction,\napparently much delighted with the joke.\n\nWringhim came rushing through the thicket impetuously, to the very spot\nwhere Mrs. Logan lay squatted. She held the wrapping close about her\nhead, but he tore it off and discovered her. \"The curse of God be on\nthee!\" said he. \"What fiend has brought thee here, and for what purpose\nart thou come? But, whatever has brought thee, I have thee!\" and with\nthat he seized her by the throat. The two women, when they heard what\njeopardy they were in from such a wretch, had squatted among the\nunderwood at a small distance from each other, so that he had never\nobserved Mrs. Calvert; but, no sooner had he seized her benefactor,\nthan, like a wild cat, she sprung out of the thicket, and had both\nhands fixed at his throat, one of them twisted in his stock, in a\ntwinkling. She brought him back-over among the brushwood, and the two,\nfixing on him like two harpies, mastered him with ease. Then indeed was\nhe woefully beset. He deemed for a while that his friend was at his\nback, and, turning his bloodshot eyes towards the path, he attempted to\ncall; but there was no friend there, and the women cut short his cries\nby another twist of his stock. \"Now, gallant and rightful Laird of\nDalcastle,\" said Mrs. Logan, \"what hast thou to say for thyself? Lay\nthy account to dree the weird thou hast so well earned. Now shalt thou\nsuffer due penance for murdering thy brave and only brother.\"\n\n\"Thou liest, thou hag of the pit! I touched not my brother's life.\"\n\n\"I saw thee do it with these eyes that now look thee in the face; ay,\nwhen his back was to thee, too, and while he was hotly engaged with thy\nfriend,\" said Mrs. Calvert.\n\n\"I heard thee confess it again and again this same hour,\" said Mrs.\nLogan.\n\n\"Ay, and so did I,\" said her companion. \"Murder will out, though the\nAlmighty should lend hearing to the ears of the willow, and speech to\nthe seven tongues of the woodriff.\"\n\n\"You are liars and witches!\" said he, foaming with rage, \"and creatures\nfitted from the beginning for eternal destruction. I'll have your bones\nand your blood sacrificed on your cursed altars! O Gil-Martin!\nGil-Martin! Where art thou now? Here, here is the proper food for\nblessed vengeance! Hilloa!\"\n\nThere was no friend, no Gil-Martin there to hear or assist him: he was\nin the two women's mercy, but they used it with moderation. They\nmocked, they tormented, and they threatened him; but, finally, after\nputting him in great terror, they bound his hands behind his back, and\nhis feet fast with long straps of garters which they chanced to have in\ntheir baskets, to prevent him from pursuing them till they were out of\nhis reach. As they left him, which they did in the middle of the path,\nMrs. Calvert said: \"We could easily put an end to thy sinful life, but\nour hands shall be free of thy blood. Nevertheless thou art still in\nour power, and the vengeance of thy country shall overtake thee, thou\nmean and cowardly murderer, ay, and that more suddenly than thou art\naware!\"\n\nThe women posted to Edinburgh; and as they put themselves under the\nprotection of an English merchant, who was journeying thither with\ntwenty horses laden, and armed servants, so they had scarcely any\nconversation on the road. When they arrived at Mrs. Logan's house, then\nthey spoke of what they had seen and heard, and agreed that they had\nsufficient proof to condemn young Wringhim, who they thought richly\ndeserved the severest doom of the law.\n\n\"I never in my life saw any human being,\" said Mrs. Calvert, \"whom I\nthought so like a fiend. If a demon could inherit flesh and blood, that\nyouth is precisely such a being as I could conceive that demon to be.\nThe depth and the malignity of his eye is hideous. His breath is like\nthe airs from a charnel house, and his flesh seems fading from his\nbones, as if the worm that never dies were gnawing it away already.\"\n\n\"He was always repulsive, and every way repulsive,\" said the other,\n\"but he is now indeed altered greatly to the worse. While we were\nhand-fasting him, I felt his body to be feeble and emaciated; but yet I\nknow him to be so puffed up with spiritual pride that I believe he\nweens every one of his actions justified before God, and, instead of\nhaving stings of conscience for these, he takes great merit to himself\nin having effected them. Still my thoughts are less about him than the\nextraordinary being who accompanies him. He does everything with so\nmuch ease and indifference, so much velocity and effect, that all\nbespeak him an adept in wickedness. The likeness to my late hapless\nyoung master is so striking that I can hardly believe it to be a chance\nmodel; and I think he imitates him in everything, for some purpose or\nsome effect on his sinful associate. Do you know that he is so like in\nevery lineament, look, and gesture, that, against the clearest light of\nreason, I cannot in my mind separate the one from the other, and have a\ncertain indefinable expression on my mind that they are one and the\nsame being, or that the one was a prototype of the other.\"\n\n\"If there is an earthly crime,\" said Mrs. Calvert, \"for the due\npunishment of which the Almighty may be supposed to subvert the order\nof nature, it is fratricide. But tell me, dear friend, did you remark\nto what the subtile and hellish villain was endeavouring to prompt the\nassassin?\"\n\n\"No, I could not comprehend it. My senses were altogether so bewildered\nthat I thought they had combined to deceive me, and I gave them no\ncredit.\"\n\n\"Then hear me: I am almost certain he was using every persuasion to\ninduce him to make away with his mother; and I likewise conceive that I\nheard the incendiary give his consent!\"\n\n\"This is dreadful. Let us speak and think no more about it, till we see\nthe issue. In the meantime, let us do that which is our bounden\nduty--go and divulge all that we know relating to this foul murder.\"\n\nAccordingly the two women went to Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, the\nLord justice Clerk (who was, I think, either uncle or grandfather to\nyoung Drummond, who was outlawed and obliged to fly his country on\naccount of Colwan's death), and to that gentleman they related every\ncircumstance of what they had seen and heard. He examined Calvert very\nminutely, and seemed deeply interested in her evidence--said he knew\nshe was relating the truth, and, in testimony of it, brought a letter\nof young Drummond's from his desk, wherein that young gentleman, after\nprotesting his innocence in the most forcible terms, confessed having\nbeen with such a woman in such a house, after leaving the company of\nhis friends; and that, on going home, Sir Thomas's servant had let him\nin, in the dark, and from these circumstances he found it impossible to\nprove an alibi. He begged of his relative, if ever an opportunity\noffered, to do his endeavour to clear up that mystery, and remove the\nhorrid stigma from his name in his country, and among his kin, of\nhaving stabbed a friend behind his back.\n\nLord Craigie, therefore, directed the two women to the proper\nauthorities, and, after hearing their evidence there, it was judged\nproper to apprehend the present Laird of Dalcastle, and bring him to\nhis trial. But, before that, they sent the prisoner in the Tolbooth, he\nwho had seen the whole transaction along with Mrs. Calvert, to take a\nview of Wringhim privately; and, his discrimination being so well known\nas to be proverbial all over the land, they determined secretly to be\nruled by his report. They accordingly sent him on a pretended mission\nof legality to Dalcastle, with orders to see and speak with the\nproprietor, without giving him a hint what was wanted. On his return,\nthey examined him, and he told them that he found all things at the\nplace in utter confusion and dismay; that the lady of the place was\nmissing, and could not be found, dead or alive. On being asked if he\nhad ever seen the proprietor before, he looked astounded and unwilling\nto answer. But it came out that he had; and that he had once seen him\nkill a man on such a spot at such an hour.\n\nOfficers were then dispatched, without delay, to apprehend the monster,\nand bring him to justice. On these going to the mansion, and inquiring\nfor him, they were told he was at home; on which they stationed guards,\nand searched all the premises, but he was not to be found. It was in\nvain that they overturned beds, raised floors, and broke open closets:\nRobert Wringhim Colwan was lost once and for ever. His mother also was\nlost; and strong suspicions attached to some of the farmers and house\nservants to whom she was obnoxious, relating to her disappearance.\n\nThe Honourable Thomas Drummond became a distinguished officer in the\nAustrian service, and died in the memorable year for Scotland, 1715;\nand this is all with which history, justiciary records, and tradition,\nfurnish me relating to these matters.\n\nI have now the pleasure of presenting my readers with an original\ndocument of a most singular nature, and preserved for their perusal in\na still more singular manner. I offer no remarks on it, and make as few\nadditions to it, leaving everyone to judge for himself. We have heard\nmuch of the rage of fanaticism in former days, but nothing to this.\n\n\n\n\n  The Private Memoirs and\n  Confessions of a Sinner\n  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF\n\n\n\nPRIVATE MEMOIRS AND CONFESSIONS OF A SINNER\n\n\nMy life has been a life of trouble and turmoil; of change and\nvicissitude; of anger and exultation; of sorrow and of vengeance. My\nsorrows have all been for a slighted gospel, and my vengeance has been\nwreaked on its adversaries. Therefore, in the might of Heaven, I will\nsit down and write: I will let the wicked of this world know what I\nhave done in the faith of the promises, and justification by grace,\nthat they may read and tremble, and bless their gods of silver and gold\nthat the minister of Heaven was removed from their sphere before their\nblood was mingled with their sacrifices.\n\nI was born an outcast in the world, in which I was destined to act so\nconspicuous a part. My mother was a burning and a shining light, in the\ncommunity of Scottish worthies, and in the days of her virginity had\nsuffered much in the persecution of the saints. But it so pleased\nHeaven that, as a trial of her faith, she was married to one of the\nwicked; a man all over spotted with the leprosy of sin. As well might\nthey have conjoined fire and water together, in hopes that they would\nconsort and amalgamate, as purity and corruption: She fled from his\nembraces the first night after their marriage, and from that time forth\nhis iniquities so galled her upright heart that she quitted his society\naltogether, keeping her own apartments in the same house with him.\n\nI was the second son of this unhappy marriage, and, ere ever I was\nborn, my father according to the flesh disclaimed all relation or\nconnection with me, and all interest in me, save what the law compelled\nhim to take, which was to grant me a scanty maintenance; and had it not\nbeen for a faithful minister of the gospel, my mother's early\ninstructor, I should have remained an outcast from the church visible.\nHe took pity on me, admitting me not only into that, but into the bosom\nof his own household and ministry also, and to him am I indebted, under\nHeaven, for the high conceptions and glorious discernment between good\nand evil, right and wrong, which I attained even at an early age. It\nwas he who directed my studies aright, both in the learning of the\nancient fathers and the doctrines of the reformed church, and designed\nme for his assistant and successor in the holy office. I missed no\nopportunity of perfecting myself particularly in all the minute points\nof theology in which my reverend father and mother took great delight;\nbut at length I acquired so much skill that I astonished my teachers,\nand made them gaze at one another. I remember that it was the custom,\nin my patron's house, to ask questions of the Single Catechism round\nevery Sabbath night. He asked the first, my mother the second, and so\non, everyone saying the question asked and then asking the next. It\nfell to my mother to ask Effectual Calling at me. I said the answer\nwith propriety and emphasis. \"Now, madam,\" added I, \"my question to you\nis: What is Ineffectual Calling?\"\n\n\"Ineffectual Calling? There is no such thing, Robert,\" said she.\n\n\"But there is, madam,\" said I, and that answer proves how much you say\nthese fundamental precepts by rote, and without any consideration.\nIneffectual Calling is the outward call of the gospel without any\neffect on the hearts of unregenerated and impenitent sinners. Have not\nall these the same calls, warnings, doctrines, and reproofs, that we\nhave? And is not this ineffectual Calling? Has not Ardinferry the same?\nHas not Patrick M'Lure the same? Has not the Laird of Dalcastle and his\nreprobate heir the same? And will any tell me that this is not\nIneffectual Calling?\"\n\n\"What a wonderful boy he is!\" said my mother.\n\n\"I'm feared he turn out to be a conceited gowk,\" said old Barnet, the\nminister's man.\n\n\"No,\" said my pastor, and father (as I shall henceforth denominate\nhim). \"No, Barnet, he is a wonderful boy; and no marvel, for I have\nprayed for these talents to be bestowed on him from his infancy: and do\nyou think that Heaven would refuse a prayer so disinterested? No, it is\nimpossible. But my dread is, madam,\" continued he, turning to my\nmother, \"that he is yet in the bond of iniquity.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said my mother.\n\n\"I have struggled with the Almighty long and hard,\" continued he; \"but\nhave as yet no certain token of acceptance in his behalf, I have indeed\nfought a hard fight, but have been repulsed by him who hath seldom\nrefused my request; although I cited his own words against him, and\nendeavoured to hold him at his promise, he hath so many turnings in the\nsupremacy of his power, that I have been rejected. How dreadful is it\nto think of our darling being still without the pale of the covenant!\nBut I have vowed a vow, and in that there is hope.\"\n\nMy heart quaked with terror when I thought of being still living in a\nstate of reprobation, subjected to the awful issues of death, judgment,\nand eternal misery, by the slightest accident or casualty; and I set\nabout the duty of prayer myself with the utmost earnestness. I prayed\nthree times every day, and seven times on the Sabbath; but, the more\nfrequently and fervently that I prayed, I sinned still the more. About\nthis time, and for a long period afterwards, amounting to several\nyears, I lived in a hopeless and deplorable state of mind; for I said\nto myself, \"If my name is not written in the book of life from all\neternity, it is in vain for me to presume that either vows or prayers\nof mine, or those of all mankind combined, can ever procure its\ninsertion now.\" I had come under many vows, most solemnly taken, every\none of which I had broken; and I saw with the intensity of juvenile\ngrief that there was no hope for me. I went on sinning every hour, and\nall the while most strenuously warring against sin, and repenting of\nevery one transgression as soon after the commission of it as I got\nleisure to think. But, oh, what a wretched state this unregenerated\nstate is, in which every effort after righteousness only aggravates our\noffences! I found it vanity to contend; for, after communing with my\nheart, the conclusion was as follows: \"If I could repent me of all my\nsins, and shed tears of blood for them, still have I not a load of\noriginal transgression pressing on me that is enough to crush me to the\nlowest hell. I may be angry with my first parents for having sinned,\nbut how I shall repent me of their sin is beyond what I am able to\ncomprehend.\"\n\nStill, in those days of depravity and corruption, I had some of those\nprinciples implanted in my mind which were afterwards to spring up with\nsuch amazing fertility among the heroes of the faith and the promises.\nIn particular, I felt great indignation against all the wicked of this\nworld, and often wished for the means of ridding it of such a noxious\nburden. I liked John Barnet, my reverend father's serving-man,\nextremely ill; but, from a supposition that he might be one of the\njustified, I refrained from doing him any injury. He gave always his\nword against me, and when we were by ourselves, in the barn or the\nfields, he rated me with such severity for my faults that my heart\ncould brook it no longer. He discovered some notorious lies that I had\nframed, and taxed me with them in such a manner that I could in no wise\nget off. My cheek burnt, with offence, rather than shame; and he,\nthinking he had got the mastery of me, exulted over me most\nunmercifully, telling me I was a selfish and conceited blackguard, who\nmade great pretences towards religious devotion to cloak a disposition\ntainted with deceit, and that it would not much astonish him if I\nbrought myself to the gallows.\n\nI gathered some courage from his over-severity, and answered him as\nfollows: \"Who made thee a judge of the actions or dispositions of the\nAlmighty's creatures--thou who art a worm and no man in his sight? How\nit befits thee to deal out judgments and anathemas! Hath he not made\none vessel to honour, and another to dishonour, as in the case with\nmyself and thee? Hath he not builded his stories in the heavens, and\nlaid the foundations thereof in the earth, and how can a being like\nthee judge between good and evil, that are both subjected to the\nworkings of his hand; or of the opposing principles in the soul of man,\ncorrecting, modifying, and refining one another?\"\n\nI said this with that strong display of fervour for which I was\nremarkable at my years, and expected old Barnet to be utterly\nconfounded; but he only shook his head, and, with the most provoking\ngrin, said: \"There he goes! Sickan sublime and ridiculous sophistry I\nnever heard come out of another mouth but ane. There needs nae aiths to\nbe sworn afore the session wha is your father, young goodman. I ne'er,\nfor my part, saw a son sac like a dad, sin' my een first opened.\" With\nthat he went away, saying with an ill-natured wince: \"You made to\nhonour and me to dishonour! Dirty bow-kail thing that thou be'st!\"\n\n\"I will have the old rascal on the hip for this, if I live,\" thought I.\nSo I went and asked my mother if John was a righteous man. She could\nnot tell, but supposed he was, and therefore I got no encouragement\nfrom her. I went next to my reverend father, and inquired his opinion,\nexpecting as little from that quarter. He knew the elect as it were by\ninstinct, and could have told you of all those in his own, and some\nneighbouring parishes, who were born within the boundaries of the\ncovenant of promise, and who were not.\n\n\"I keep a good deal in company with your servant, old Barnet, father,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"You do, boy, you do, I see,\" said he.\n\n\"I wish I may not keep too much in his company,\" said I, \"not knowing\nwhat kind of society I am in. Is John a good man, father?\"\n\n\"Why, boy, he is but so so. A morally good man John is, but very little\nof the leaven of true righteousness, which is faith, within. I am\nafraid old Barnet, with all his stock of morality, will be a castaway.\"\n\nMy heart was greatly cheered by this remark; and I sighed very deeply,\nand hung my head to one side. The worthy father observed me, and\ninquired the cause, when I answered as follows: \"How dreadful the\nthought, that I have been going daily in company and fellowship with\none whose name is written on the red-letter side of the book of life;\nwhose body and soul have been, from all eternity, consigned over to\neverlasting destruction, and to whom the blood of the atonement can\nnever, never reach! Father, this is an awful thing, and beyond my\ncomprehension.\"\n\n\"While we are in the world, we must mix with the inhabitants thereof,\"\nsaid he; \"and the stains which adhere to us by reason of this mixture,\nwhich is unavoidable, shall all be washed away. It is our duty,\nhowever, to shun the society of wicked men as much as possible, lest we\npartake of their sins, and become sharers with them in punishment.\nJohn, however, is morally a good man, and may yet get a cast of grace.\"\n\n\"I always thought him a good man till to-day,\" said I, \"when he threw\nout some reflections on your character, so horrible that I quake to\nthink of the wickedness and malevolence of his heart. He was rating me\nvery impertinently for some supposed fault, which had no being save in\nhis own jealous brain, when I attempted to reason him out of his belief\nin the spirit of calm Christian argument. But how do you think he\nanswered me? He did so, sir, by twisting his mouth at me, and remarking\nthat such sublime and ridiculous sophistry never came out of another\nmouth but one (meaning yours) and that no oath before a kirk session\nwas necessary to prove who was my dad, for that he had never seen a son\nso like a father as I was like mine.\"\n\n\"He durst not for his soul's salvation, and for his daily bread, which\nhe values much more, say such a word, boy; therefore, take care what\nyou assert,\" said my reverend father.\n\n\"He said these very words, and will not deny them, sir,\" said I.\n\nMy reverend father turned about in great wrath and indignation, and\nwent away in search of John, but I kept out of the way, and listened at\na back window; for John was dressing the plot of ground behind the\nhouse; and I hope it was no sin in me that I did rejoice in the\ndialogue which took place, it being the victory of righteousness over\nerror.\n\n\"Well, John, this is a fine day for your delving work.\"\n\n\"Ay, it's a tolerable day, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you thankful in heart, John, for such temporal mercies as these?\"\n\n\"Aw doubt we're a' ower little thankfu', sir, baith for temporal an'\nspeeritual mercies; but it isna aye the maist thankfu' heart that maks\nthe greatest fraze wi' the tongue.\"\n\n\"I hope there is nothing personal under that remark, John?\"\n\n\"Gin the bannet fits ony body's head, they're unco welcome to it, sir,\nfor me.\"\n\n\"John, I do not approve of these innuendoes. You have an arch malicious\nmanner of vending your aphorisms, which the men of the world are too\napt to read the wrong way, for your dark hints are sure to have one\nvery bad meaning.\"\n\n\"Hout na, sir, it's only bad folks that think sac. They find ma bits o'\ngibes come hame to their hearts wi' a kind o' yerk, an' that gars them\nwince.\"\n\n\"That saying is ten times worse than the other, John; it is a manifest\ninsult: it is just telling me to my face that you think me a bad man.\"\n\n\"A body canna help his thoughts, sir.\"\n\n\"No, but a man's thoughts are generally formed from observation. Now I\nshould like to know, even from the mouth of a misbeliever, what part of\nmy conduct warrants such a conclusion.\"\n\n\"Nae particular pairt, sir; I draw a' my conclusions frae the haill o'\na man's character, an' I'm no that aften far wrong.\"\n\n\"Well, John, and what sort of general character do you suppose mine to\nbe?\"\n\n\"Yours is a Scripture character, sir, an' I'll prove it.\"\n\n\"I hope so, John. Well, which of the Scripture characters do you think\napproximates nearest to my own?\"\n\n\"Guess, sir, guess; I wish to lead a proof.\"\n\n\"Why, if it be an Old Testament character, I hope it is Melchizedek,\nfor at all events you cannot deny there is one point of resemblance: I,\nlike him, am a preacher of righteousness. If it be a New Testament\ncharacter, I suppose you mean the Apostle of the Gentiles, of whom I am\nan unworthy representative.\"\n\n\"Na, na, sir, better nor that still, an' fer closer is the resemblance.\nWhen ye bring me to the point, I maun speak. Ye are the just Pharisee,\nsir, that gaed up wi' the poor publican to pray in the Temple; an'\nye're acting the very same pairt at this time, an' saying i'  your\nheart, 'God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, an' in nae\nway like this poor misbelieving unregenerate sinner, John Barnet.'\"\n\n\"I hope I may say so indeed.\"\n\n\"There now! I tauld you how it was! But, d'ye hear, maister. Here\nstands the poor sinner, John Barnet, your beadle an' servantman, wha\nwadna change chances wi' you in the neist world, nor consciences in\nthis, for ten times a' that you possess--your justification by faith\nan' awthegither.\"\n\n\"You are extremely audacious and impertinent, John; but the language of\nreprobation cannot affect me: I came only to ask you one question,\nwhich I desire you to answer candidly. Did you ever say to anyone that\nI was the boy Robert's natural father?\"\n\n\"Hout na, sir! Ha-ha-ha! Aih, fie, na, sir! I durst-na say that for my\nlife. I doubt the black stool, an' the sack gown, or maybe the juggs\nwad hae been my portion had I said sic a thing as that. Hout, hout!\nFie, fie! Unco-like doings thae for a Melchizedek or a Saint Paul!\"\n\n\"John, you are a profane old man, and I desire that you will not\npresume to break your jests on me. Tell me, dare you say, or dare you\nthink, that I am the natural father of that boy?\"\n\n\"Ye canna hinder me to think whatever I like, sir, nor can I hinder\nmysel.\"\n\n\"But did you ever say to anyone that he resembled me, and fathered\nhimself well enough?\"\n\n\"I hae said mony a time that he resembled you, sir. Naebody can mistake\nthat.\"\n\n\"But, John, there are many natural reasons for such likenesses, besides\nthat of consanguinity. They depend much on the thoughts and affections\nof the mother; and it is probable that the mother of this boy, being\ndeserted by her worthless husband, having turned her thoughts on me, as\nlikely to be her protector, may have caused this striking resemblance.\"\n\n\"Ay, it may be, sir. I coudna say.\"\n\n\"I have known a lady, John, who was delivered of a blackamoor child,\nmerely from the circumstance of having got a start by the sudden\nentrance of her negro servant, and not being able to forget him for\nseveral hours.\"\n\n\"It may be, sir; but I ken this--an' I had been the laird, I wadna hae\nta'en that story in.\"\n\n\"So, then, John, you positively think, from a casual likeness, that\nthis boy is my son?\"\n\n\"Man's thoughts are vanity, sir; they come unasked, an' gang away\nwithout a dismissal, an' he canna' help them. I'm neither gaun to say\nthat I think he's your son, nor that I think he's no your son: sae ye\nneedna pose me nae mair about it.\"\n\n\"Hear then my determination, John. If you do not promise to me, in\nfaith and honour, that you never will say, or insinuate such a thing\nagain in your life, as that that boy is my natural son, I will take the\nkeys of the church from you, and dismiss you from my service.\"\n\nJohn pulled out the keys, and dashed them on the gravel at the reverend\nminister's feet. \"There are the keys o' your kirk, sir! I hae never had\nmuckle mense o' them sin' ye entered the door o't. I hae carried them\nthis three and thretty year, but they hae aye been like to burn a hole\ni' my pouch sin' ever they were turned for your admittance. Tak them\nagain, an' gie them to wha you will, and muckle gude may he get o'\nthem. Auld John may dee a beggar in a hay barn, or at the back of a\ndike, but he sall aye be master o' his ain thoughts an' gie them vent\nor no, as he likes.\"\n\nHe left the manse that day, and I rejoiced in the riddance; for I\ndisdained to be kept so much under by one who was in bond of iniquity,\nand of whom there seemed no hope, as he rejoiced in his frowardness,\nand refused to submit to that faithful teacher, his master.\n\nIt was about this time that my reverend father preached a sermon, one\nsentence of which affected me most disagreeably. It was to the purport\nthat every unrepented sin was productive of a new sin with each breath\nthat a man drew; and every one of these new sins added to the catalogue\nin the same manner. I was utterly confounded at the multitude of my\ntransgressions; for I was sensible that there were great numbers of\nsins of which I had never been able thoroughly to repent, and these\nmomentary ones, by moderate calculation, had, I saw, long ago, amounted\nto a hundred and fifty thousand in the minute, and I saw no end to the\nseries of repentances to which I had subjected myself. A life-time was\nnothing to enable me to accomplish the sum, and then being, for\nanything I was certain of, in my state of nature, and the grace of\nrepentance withheld from me--what was I to do, or what was to become of\nme? In the meantime, I went on sinning without measure; but I was still\nmore troubled about the multitude than the magnitude of my\ntransgressions, and the small minute ones puzzled me more than those\nthat were more heinous, as the latter had generally some good effects\nin the way of punishing wicked men, froward boys, and deceitful women;\nand I rejoiced, even then in my early youth, at being used as a scourge\nin the hand of the Lord; another Jehu, a Cyrus, or a Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nOn the whole, I remember that I got into great confusion relating to my\nsins and repentances, and knew neither where to begin nor how to\nproceed, and often had great fears that I was wholly without Christ,\nand that I would find God a consuming fire to me. I could not help\nrunning into new sins continually; but then I was mercifully dealt\nwith, for I was often made to repent of them most heartily, by reason\nof bodily chastisements received on these delinquencies being\ndiscovered. I was particularly prone to lying, and I cannot but admire\nthe mercy that has freely forgiven me all these juvenile sins. Now that\nI know them all to be blotted out, and that I am an accepted person, I\nmay the more freely confess them: the truth is, that one lie always\npaved the way for another, from hour to hour, from day to day, and from\nyear to year; so that I found myself constantly involved in a labyrinth\nof deceit, from which it was impossible to extricate myself. If I knew\na person to be a godly one, I could almost have kissed his feet; but,\nagainst the carnal portion of mankind, I set my face continually. I\nesteemed the true ministers of the gospel; but the prelatic party, and\nthe preachers up of good works I abhorred, and to this hour I account\nthem the worst and most heinous of all transgressors.\n\nThere was only one boy at Mr. Witch's class who kept always the upper\nhand of me in every part of education. I strove against him from year\nto year, but it was all in vain; for he was a very wicked boy, and I\nwas convinced he had dealings with the Devil. Indeed, it was believed\nall over the country that his mother was a witch; and I was at length\nconvinced, that it was no human ingenuity that beat me with so much\nease in the Latin, after I had often sat up a whole night with my\nreverend father, studying my lesson in all its bearings. I often read\nas well and sometimes better than he; but, the moment Mr. Wilson began\nto examine us, my opponent popped up above me. I determined (as I knew\nhim for a wicked person, and one of the Devil's handfasted children) to\nbe revenged on him, and to humble him by some means or other.\nAccordingly I lost no opportunity of setting the master against him,\nand succeeded several times in getting him severely beaten for faults\nof which he was innocent. I can hardly describe the joy that it gave to\nmy heart to see a wicked creature suffering, for, though he deserved it\nnot for one thing, he richly deserved it for others. This may be by\nsome people accounted a great sin in me; but I deny it, for I did it as\na duty, and what a man or boy does for the right will never be put into\nthe sum of his transgressions.\n\nThis boy, whose name was M'Gill, was, at all his leisure hours, engaged\nin drawing profane pictures of beasts, men, women, houses, and trees,\nand, in short, of all things that his eye encountered. These profane\nthings the master often smiled at, and admired; therefore I began\nprivately to try my hand likewise. I had scarcely tried above once to\ndraw the figure of a man, ere I conceived that I had hit the very\nfeatures of Mr. Wilson. They were so particular that they could not be\neasily mistaken, and I was so tickled and pleased with the droll\nlikeness that I had drawn that I laughed immoderately at it. I tried no\nother figure but this; and I tried it in every situation in which a man\nand a schoolmaster could be placed. I often wrought for hours together\nat this likeness, nor was it long before I made myself so much master\nof the outline that I could have drawn it in any situation whatever,\nalmost off hand. I then took M'Gill's account book of algebra home with\nme, and at my leisure put down a number of gross caricatures of Mr.\nWilson here and there, several of them in situations notoriously\nludicrous. I waited the discovery of this treasure with great\nimpatience; but the book, chancing to be one that M'Gill was not using,\nI saw it might be long enough before I enjoyed the consummation of my\ngrand scheme: therefore, with all the ingenuity I was master of, I\nbrought it before our dominie's eye. But never shall I forget the rage\nthat gleamed in the tyrant's phiz! I was actually terrified to look at\nhim, and trembled at his voice. M'Gill was called upon, and examined\nrelating to the obnoxious figures. He denied flatly that any of them\nwere of his doing. But the master inquiring at him whose they were, he\ncould not tell, but affirmed it to be some trick. Mr. Wilson at one\ntime began, as I thought, to hesitate; but the evidence was so strong\nagainst M'Gill that at length his solemn asseverations of innocence\nonly proved an aggravation of his crime. There was not one in the\nschool who had ever been known to draw a figure but himself, and on him\nfell the whole weight of the tyrant's vengeance. It was dreadful; and I\nwas once in hopes that he would not leave life in the culprit. He,\nhowever, left the school for several months, refusing to return to be\nsubjected to punishment for the faults of others, and I stood king of\nthe class.\n\nMatters, were at last made up between M'Gill's parents and the\nschoolmaster, but by that time I had got the start of him, and never in\nmy life did I exert myself so much as to keep the mastery. It was in\nvain; the powers of enchantment prevailed, and I was again turned down\nwith the tear in my eye. I could think of no amends but one, and, being\ndriven to desperation, I put it in practice. I told a lie of him. I\ncame boldly up to the master, and told him that M'Gill had in my\nhearing cursed him in a most shocking manner, and called him vile\nnames. He called M'Gill, and charged him with the crime, and the proud\nyoung coxcomb was so stunned at the atrocity of the charge that his\nface grew as red as crimson, and the words stuck in his throat as he\nfeebly denied it. His guilt was manifest, and he was again flogged most\nnobly and dismissed the school for ever in disgrace, as a most\nincorrigible vagabond.\n\nThis was a great victory gained, and I rejoiced and exulted exceedingly\nin it. It had, however, very nigh cost me my life; for not long\nthereafter I encountered M'Gill in the fields, on which he came up and\nchallenged me for a liar, daring me to fight him. I refused, and said\nthat I looked on him as quite below my notice; but he would not quit\nme, and finally told me that he should either lick me, or I should lick\nhim, as he had no other means of being revenged on such a scoundrel. I\ntried to intimidate him, but it would not do; and I believe I would\nhave given all that I had in the world to be quit of him. He at length\nwent so far as first to kick me, and then strike me on the face; and,\nbeing both older and stronger than he, I thought it scarcely became me\nto take such insults patiently. I was, nevertheless, well aware that\nthe devilish powers of his mother would finally prevail; and either the\ndread of this, or the inward consciousness of having wronged him,\ncertainly unnerved my arm, for I fought wretchedly, and was soon wholly\novercome. I was so sore defeated that I kneeled and was going to beg\nhis pardon; but another thought struck me momentarily, and I threw\nmyself on my face, and inwardly begged aid from heaven; at the same\ntime I felt as if assured that my prayer was heard, and would be\nanswered. While I was in this humble attitude, the villain kicked me\nwith his foot and cursed me; and I, being newly encouraged, arose and\nencountered him once more. We had not fought long at this second turn\nbefore I saw a man hastening towards us; on which I uttered a shout of\njoy, and laid on valiantly; but my very next look assured me that the\nman was old John Barnet, whom I had likewise wronged all that was in my\npower, and between these two wicked persons I expected anything but\njustice. My arm was again enfeebled, and that of my adversary\nprevailed. I was knocked down and mauled most grievously, and, while\nthe ruffian was kicking and cuffing me at his will and pleasure, up\ncame old John Barnet, breathless with running, and, at one blow with\nhis open hand, levelled my opponent with the earth. \"Tak ye that,\nmaister!\" said John, \"to learn ye better breeding. Hout awa, man! An ye\nwill fight, fight fair. Gude sauf us, ir ye a gentleman's brood, that\nye will kick an' cuff a lad when he's down?\"\n\nWhen I heard this kind and unexpected interference, I began once more\nto value myself on my courage, and, springing up, I made at my\nadversary; but John, without saying a word, bit his lip, and seizing me\nby the neck threw me down. M'Gill begged of him to stand and see fair\nplay, and suffer us to finish the battle; for, added he, \"he is a liar,\nand a scoundrel, and deserves ten times more than I can give him.\"\n\n\"I ken he's a' that ye say, an' mair, my man,\" quoth John. \"But am I\nsure that ye're no as bad, an' waur? It says nae muckle for ony o' ye\nto be tearing like tikes at one anither here.\"\n\nJohn cocked his cudgel and stood between us, threatening to knock the\none dead who first offered to lift his hand against the other; but,\nperceiving no disposition in any of us to separate, he drove me home\nbefore him like a bullock, and keeping close guard behind me, lest\nM'Gill had followed. I felt greatly indebted to John, yet I complained\nof his interference to my mother, and the old officious sinner got no\nthanks for his pains.\n\nAs I am writing only from recollection, so I remember of nothing\nfarther in these early days, in the least worthy of being recorded.\nThat I was a great, a transcendent sinner, I confess. But still I had\nhopes of forgiveness, because I never sinned from principle, but\naccident; and then I always tried to repent of these sins by the slump,\nfor individually it was impossible; and, though not always successful\nin my endeavours, I could not help that, the grace of repentance being\nwithheld from me, I regarded myself as in no degree accountable for the\nfailure. Moreover, there were many of the most deadly sins into which I\nnever fell, for I dreaded those mentioned in the Revelations as\nexcluding sins, so that I guarded against them continually. In\nparticular, I brought myself to despise, if not to abhor, the beauty of\nwomen, looking on it as the greatest snare to which mankind was\nsubjected, and though young men and maidens, and even old women (my\nmother among the rest), taxed me with being an unnatural wretch, I\ngloried in my acquisition; and, to this day, am thankful for having\nescaped the most dangerous of all snares.\n\nI kept myself also free of the sins of idolatry and misbelief, both of\na deadly nature; and, upon the whole, I think I had not then broken,\nthat is, absolutely broken, above four out of the ten commandments;\nbut, for all that, I had more sense than to regard either my good\nworks, or my evil deeds, as in the smallest degree influencing the\neternal decrees of God concerning me, either with regard to my\nacceptance or reprobation. I depended entirely on the bounty of free\ngrace, holding all the righteousness of man as filthy rags, and\nbelieving in the momentous and magnificent truth that, the more heavily\nloaden with transgressions, the more welcome was the believer at the\nthrone of grace. And I have reason to believe that it was this\ndependence and this belief that at last ensured my acceptance there.\n\nI come now to the most important period of my existence--the period\nthat has modelled my character, and influenced every action of my\nlife--without which, this detail of my actions would have been as a\ntale that hath been told--a monotonous farrago--an uninteresting\nharangue--in short, a thing of nothing. Whereas, lo! it must now be a\nrelation of great and terrible actions, done in the might, and by the\ncommission of heaven. Amen.\n\nLike the sinful king of Israel, I had been walking softly before the\nLord for a season. I had been humbled for my transgressions, and, as\nfar as I recollect, sorry on account of their numbers and heinousness.\nMy reverend father had been, moreover, examining me every day regarding\nthe state of my soul, and my answers sometimes appeared to give him\nsatisfaction, and sometimes not. As for my mother, she would harp on\nthe subject of my faith for ever; yet, though I knew her to be a\nChristian, I confess that I always despised her motley instructions,\nnor had I any great regard for her person. If this was a crime in me, I\nnever could help it. I confess it freely, and believe it was a judgment\nfrom heaven inflicted on her for some sin of former days, and that I\nhad no power to have acted otherwise towards her than I did.\n\nIn this frame of mind was I when my reverend father one morning arose\nfrom his seat, and, meeting me as I entered the room, he embraced me,\nand welcomed me into the community of the just upon earth. I was struck\nspeechless, and could make no answer save by looks of surprise. My\nmother also came to me, kissed, and wept over me; and, after showering\nunnumbered blessings on my head, she also welcomed me into the society\nof the just made perfect. Then each of them took me by a hand, and my\nreverend father explained to me how he had wrestled with God, as the\npatriarch of old had done, not for a night, but for days and years, and\nthat in bitterness and anguish of spirit, on my account; but, that he\nhad at last prevailed, and had now gained the long and earnestly\ndesired assurance of my acceptance with the Almighty, in and through\nthe merits and sufferings of his Son. That I was now a justified\nperson, adopted among the number of God's children--my name written in\nthe Lamb's book of life, and that no by-past transgression, nor any\nfuture act of my own, or of other men, could be instrumental in\naltering the decree. \"All the powers of darkness,\" added he, \"shall\nnever be able to pluck you again out of your Redeemer's hand. And now,\nmy son, be strong and steadfast in the truth. Set your face against\nsin, and sinful men, and resist even to blood, as many of the faithful\nof this land have done, and your reward shall be double. I am assured\nof your acceptance by the word and spirit of Him who cannot err, and\nyour sanctification and repentance unto life will follow in due course.\nRejoice and be thankful, for you are plucked as a brand out of the\nburning, and now your redemption is sealed and sure.\"\n\nI wept for joy to be thus assured of my freedom from all sin, and of\nthe impossibility of my ever again falling away from my new state. I\nbounded away into the fields and the woods, to pour out my spirit in\nprayer before the Almighty for his kindness to me: my whole frame\nseemed to be renewed; every nerve was buoyant with new life; I felt as\nif I could have flown in the air, or leaped over the tops of the trees.\nAn exaltation of spirit lifted me, as it were, far above the earth and\nthe sinful creatures crawling  on its surface; and I deemed myself as\nan eagle among the children of men, soaring on high, and looking down\nwith pity and contempt on the grovelling creatures below.\n\nAs I thus wended my way, I beheld a young man of a mysterious\nappearance coming towards me. I tried to shun him, being bent on my own\ncontemplations; but he cast himself in my way, so that I could not well\navoid him; and, more than that, I felt a sort of invisible power that\ndrew me towards him, something like the force of enchantment, which I\ncould not resist. As we approached each other, our eyes met and I can\nnever describe the strange sensations that thrilled through my whole\nframe at that impressive moment; a moment to me fraught with the most\ntremendous consequences; the beginning of a series of adventures which\nhas puzzled myself, and will puzzle the world when I am no more in it.\nThat time will now soon arrive, sooner than anyone can devise who knows\nnot the tumult of my thoughts and the labour of my spirit; and when it\nhath come and passed over, when my flesh and my bones are decayed, and\nmy soul has passed to its everlasting home, then shall the sons of men\nponder on the events of my life; wonder and tremble, and tremble and\nwonder how such things should be.\n\nThat strange youth and I approached each other in silence, and slowly,\nwith our eyes fixed on each other's eyes. We approached till not more\nthan a yard intervened between us, and then stood still and gazed,\nmeasuring each other from head to foot. What was my astonishment on\nperceiving that he was the same being as myself! The clothes were the\nsame to the smallest item. The form was the same; the apparent age; the\ncolour of the hair; the eyes; and, as far as recollection could serve\nme from viewing my own features in a glass, the features too were the\nvery same. I conceived at first that I saw a vision, and that my\nguardian angel had appeared to me at this important era of my life; but\nthis singular being read my thoughts in my looks, anticipating the very\nwords that I was going to utter.\n\n\"You think I am your brother,\" said he; \"or that I am your second self.\nI am indeed your brother, not according to the flesh, but in my belief\nof the same truths, and my assurance in the same mode of redemption,\nthan which I hold nothing so great or so glorious on earth.\"\n\n\"Then you are an associate well adapted to my present state,\" said I.\n\"For this time is a time of great rejoicing in spirit to me. I am on my\nway to return thanks to the Most High for my redemption from the bonds\nof sin and misery. If you will join with me heart and hand in youthful\nthanksgiving, then shall we two go and worship together; but, if not,\ngo your way, and I shall go mine.\"\n\n\"Ah, you little know with how much pleasure I will accompany you, and\njoin with you in your elevated devotions,\" said he fervently. \"Your\nstate is a state to be envied indeed; but I have been advised of it,\nand am come to be a humble disciple of yours; to be initiated into the\ntrue way of salvation by conversing with you, and perhaps of being\nassisted by your prayers.\"\n\nMy spiritual pride being greatly elevated by this address, I began to\nassume the preceptor, and questioned this extraordinary youth with\nregard to his religious principles, telling him plainly, if he was one\nwho expected acceptance with God at all, on account of good works, that\nI would hold no communion with him. He renounced these at once, with\nthe greatest vehemence, and declared his acquiescence in my faith. I\nasked if he believed in the eternal and irrevocable decrees of God,\nregarding the salvation and condemnation of all mankind? He answered\nthat he did so: aye, what would signify all things else that he\nbelieved, if he did not believe in that? We then went on to commune\nabout all our points of belief; and in everything that I suggested he\nacquiesced, and, as I thought that day, often carried them to extremes,\nso that I had a secret dread he was advancing blasphemies. He had such\na way with him, and paid such a deference to all my opinions, that I\nwas quite captivated, and, at the same time, I stood in a sort of awe\nof him, which I could not account for, and several times was seized\nwith an involuntary inclination to escape from his presence by making a\nsudden retreat. But he seemed constantly to anticipate my thoughts, and\nwas sure to divert my purpose by some turn in the conversation that\nparticularly interested me. He took care to dwell much on the theme of\nthe impossibility of those ever falling away who were once accepted and\nreceived into covenant with God, for he seemed to know that in that\nconfidence, and that trust, my whole hopes were centred.\n\nWe moved about from one place to another, until the day was wholly\nspent. My mind had all the while been kept in a state of agitation\nresembling the motion of a whirlpool, and, when we came to separate, I\nthen discovered that the purpose for which I had sought the fields had\nbeen neglected, and that I had been diverted from the worship of God by\nattending to the quibbles and dogmas of this singular and unaccountable\nbeing, who seemed to have more knowledge and information than all the\npersons I had ever known put together.\n\nWe parted with expressions of mutual regret, and when I left him I felt\na deliverance, but at the same time a certain consciousness that I was\nnot thus to get free of him, but that he was like to be an acquaintance\nthat was to stick to me for good or for evil. I was astonished at his\nacuteness and knowledge about everything; but, as for his likeness to\nme, that was quite unaccountable. He was the same person in every\nrespect, but yet he was not always so; for I observed several times,\nwhen we were speaking of certain divines and their tenets, that his\nface assumed something of the appearance of theirs; and it struck me\nthat, by setting his features to the mould of other people's, he\nentered at once into their conceptions and feelings. I had been greatly\nflattered, and greatly interested by his conversation; whether I had\nbeen the better for it or the worse, I could not tell. I had been\ndiverted from returning thanks to my gracious Maker for his great\nkindness to me, and came home as I went away, but not with the same\nbuoyancy and lightness of heart.  Well may I remember the day in which\nI was first received into the number, and made an heir to all the\nprivileges of the children of God, and on which I first met this\nmysterious associate, who from that day forth contrived to wind himself\ninto all my affairs, both spiritual and temporal, to this day on which\nI am writing the account of it. It was on the 25th day of March, 1704,\nwhen I had just entered the eighteenth year of my age. Whether it\nbehoves me to bless God for the events of that day, or to deplore them,\nhas been hid from my discernment, though I have inquired into it with\nfear and trembling; and I have now lost all hopes of ever discovering\nthe true import of these events until that day when my accounts are to\nmake up and reckon for in another world.\n\nWhen I came home, I went straight into the parlour, where my mother was\nsitting by herself. She started to her feet, and uttered a smothered\nscream. \"What ails you, Robert?\" cried she. \"My dear son, what is the\nmatter with you?\"\n\n\"Do you see anything the matter with me?\" said I. \"It appears that the\nailment is with yourself and either in your crazed head or your dim\neyes, for there is nothing the matter with me.\"\n\n\"Ah, Robert, you are ill!\" cried she. \"You are very ill, my dear boy;\nyou are quite changed; your very voice and manner are changed. Ah,\nJane, haste you up to the study, and tell Mr. Wringhim to come here on\nthe instant and speak to Robert.\"\n\n\"I beseech you, woman, to restrain yourself,\" said I. \"If you suffer\nyour frenzy to run away with your judgment in this manner, I will leave\nthe house. What do you mean? I tell you, there is nothing ails me: I\nnever was better.\"\n\nShe screamed, and ran between me and the door, to bar my retreat: in\nthe meantime my reverend father entered, and I have not forgot how he\ngazed, through his glasses, first at my mother, and then at me. I\nimagined that his eyes burnt like candles, and was afraid of him, which\nI suppose made my looks more unstable than they would otherwise have\nbeen.\n\n\"What is all this for?\" said he. \"Mistress! Robert! What is the matter\nhere?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, our boy!\" cried my mother; \"our dear boy, Mr. Wringhim! Look\nat him, and speak to him: he is either dying or translated, sir!\"\n\nHe looked at me with a countenance of great alarm; mumbling some\nsentences to himself, and then taking me by the arm, as if to feel my\npulse, he said, with a faltering voice: \"Something has indeed befallen\nyou, either in body or mind, boy, for you are transformed, since the\nmorning, that I could not have known you for the same person. Have you\nmet with any accident?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you seen anything out of the ordinary course of nature?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then, Satan, I fear, has been busy with you, tempting you in no\nordinary degree at this momentous crisis of your life?\"\n\nMy mind turned on my associate for the day, and the idea that he might\nbe an agent of the Devil had such an effect on me that I could make no\nanswer.\n\n\"I see how it is,\" said he; \"you are troubled in spirit, and I have no\ndoubt that the enemy of our salvation has been busy with you. Tell me\nthis, has he overcome you, or has he not?\"\n\n\"He has not, my dear father,\" said I. \"In the strength of the Lord, I\nhope I have withstood him. But indeed, if he has been busy with me, I\nknew it not. I have been conversant this day with one stranger only,\nwhom I took rather for an angel of light.\"\n\n\"It is one of the Devil's most profound wiles to appear like one,\" said\nmy mother.\n\n\"Woman, hold thy peace!\" said my reverend father. \"Thou pretendest to\nteach what thou knowest not. Tell me this, boy: did this stranger, with\nwhom you met, adhere to the religious principles in which I have\neducated you?\"\n\n\"Yes, to every one of them in their fullest latitude,\" said I.\n\n\"Then he was no agent of the Wicked One with whom you held converse,\"\nsaid he: \"for that is the doctrine that was made to overturn the\nprincipalities and powers, the might and dominion of the kingdom of\ndarkness. Let us pray.\"\n\nAfter spending about a quarter of an hour in solemn and sublime\nthanksgiving, this saintly man and minister of Christ Jesus, gave out\nthat the day following should be kept by the family as a day of solemn\nthanksgiving, and spent in prayer and praise, on account of the calling\nand election of one of its members; or rather for the election of that\nindividual being revealed on earth, as well as confirmed in Heaven.\n\nThe next day was with me a day of holy exultation. It was begun by my\nreverend father laying his hands upon my head and blessing me, and then\ndedicating me to the Lord in the most awful and impressive manner. It\nwas in no common way that he exercised this profound rite, for it was\ndone with all the zeal and enthusiasm of a devotee to the true cause,\nand a champion on the side he had espoused. He used these remarkable\nwords, which I have still treasured up in my heart: \"I give him unto\nThee only, to Thee wholly, and to Thee for ever. I dedicate him unto\nThee, soul, body, and spirit. Not as the wicked of this world, or the\nhirelings of a Church profanely called by Thy name, do I dedicate this\nThy servant to Thee: Not in words and form, learned by rote, and\ndictated by the limbs of Antichrist, but, Lord, I give him into Thy\nhand, as a captain putteth a sword into the hand of his sovereign,\nwherewith to lay waste his enemies. May he be a two-edged weapon in Thy\nhand and a spear coming out of Thy mouth, to destroy, and overcome, and\npass over; and may the enemies of Thy Church fall down before him, and\nbe as dung to fat the land!\"\n\nFrom the moment, I conceived it decreed, not that I should be a\nminister of the gospel, but a champion of it, to cut off the enemies of\nthe Lord from the face of the earth; and I rejoiced in the commission,\nfinding it more congenial to my nature to be cutting sinners off with\nthe sword than to be haranguing them from the pulpit, striving to\nproduce an effect which God, by his act of absolute predestination, had\nfor ever rendered impracticable. The more I pondered on these things\nthe more I saw of the folly and inconsistency of ministers in spending\ntheir lives striving and remonstrating with sinners in order to induce\nthem to do that which they had it not in their power to do. Seeing that\nGod had from all eternity decided the fate of every individual that was\nto be born of woman, how vain was it in man to endeavour to save those\nwhom their Maker had, by an unchangeable decree, doomed to destruction.\nI could not disbelieve the doctrine which the best of men had taught\nme, and towards which he made the whole of the Scriptures to bear, and\nyet it made the economy of the Christian world appear to me as an\nabsolute contradiction. How much more wise would it be, thought I, to\nbegin and cut sinners off with the sword! For till that is effected,\nthe saints can never inherit the earth in peace. Should I be honoured\nas an instrument to begin this great work of purification, I should\nrejoice in it. But, then, where had I the means, or under what\ndirection was I to begin? There was one thing clear, I was now the\nLord's and it behoved me to bestir myself in His service. Oh that I had\nan host at my command, then would I be as a devouring fire among the\nworkers of iniquity!\n\nFull of these great ideas, I hurried through the city, and sought again\nthe private path through the field and wood of Finnieston, in which my\nreverend preceptor had the privilege of walking for study, and to which\nhe had a key that was always at my command. Near one of the stiles, I\nperceived a young man sitting in a devout posture, reading a Bible. He\nrose, lifted his hat, and made an obeisance to me, which I returned and\nwalked on. I had not well crossed the stile till it struck me I knew\nthe face of the youth and that he was some intimate acquaintance, to\nwhom I ought to have spoken. I walked on, and returned, and walked on\nagain, trying to recollect who he was; but for my life I could not.\nThere was, however, a fascination in his look and manner that drew me\nback towards him in spite of myself, and I resolved to go to him, if it\nwere merely to speak and see who he was.\n\nI came up to him and addressed him, but he was so intent on his book\nthat, though I spoke, he lifted not his eyes. I looked on the book\nalso, and still it seemed a Bible, having columns, chapters, and\nverses; but it was in a language of which I was wholly ignorant, and\nall intersected with red lines and verses. A sensation resembling a\nstroke of electricity came over me, on first casting my eyes on that\nmysterious book, and I stood motionless. He looked up, smiled, closed\nhis book, and put it in his bosom. \"You seem strangely affected, dear\nsir, by looking at my book,\" said he mildly.\n\n\"In the name of God, what book is that?\" said I. \"Is it a Bible?\"\n\n\"It is my Bible, sir,\" said he, \"but I will cease reading it, for I am\nglad to see you. Pray, is not this a day for holy festivity with you?\"\n\nI stared in his face, but made no answer, for my senses were bewildered.\n\n\"Do you not know me?\" said he. \"You appear to be somehow at a loss. Had\nnot you and I some sweet communion and fellowship yesterday?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said I. \"But, surely, if you are the young\ngentleman with whom I spent the hours yesterday, you have the chameleon\nart of changing your appearance; I never could have recognized you.\"\n\n\"My countenance changes with my studies and sensations,\" said he. \"It\nis a natural peculiarity in me, over which I have not full control. If\nI contemplate a man's features seriously, mine own gradually assume the\nvery same appearance and character. And what is more, by contemplating\na face minutely, I not only attain the same likeness but, with the\nlikeness, I attain the very same ideas as well as the same mode of\narranging them, so that, you see, by looking at a person attentively, I\nby degrees assume his likeness, and by assuming his likeness I attain\nto the possession of his most secret thoughts. This, I say, is a\npeculiarity in my nature, a gift of the God that made me; but, whether\nor not given me for a blessing, He knows Himself, and so do I. At all\nevents, I have this privilege, I can never be mistaken of a character\nin whom I am interested.\"\n\n\"It is a rare qualification,\" replied I, \"and I would give worlds to\npossess it. Then, it appears that it is needless to dissemble with you,\nsince you can at any time extract our most secret thoughts from our\nbosoms. You already know my natural character?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"and it is that which attaches me to you. By assuming\nyour likeness yesterday, I became acquainted with your character, and\nwas no less astonished at the profundity and range of your thoughts\nthan at the heroic magnanimity with which these were combined. And now,\nin addition to these, you are dedicated to the great work of the Lord;\nfor which reasons I have resolved to attach myself as closely to you as\npossible, and to render you all the service of which my poor abilities\nare capable.\"\n\nI confess that I was greatly flattered by these compliments paid to my\nabilities by a youth of such superior qualifications; by one who, with\na modesty and affability rare at his age, combined a height of genius\nand knowledge almost above human comprehension. Nevertheless, I began\nto assume a certain superiority of demeanour towards him, as judging it\nincumbent on me to do so, in order to keep up his idea of my exalted\ncharacter. We conversed again till the day was near a close; and the\nthings that he strove most to inculcate on my mind were the\ninfallibility of the elect, and the preordination of all things that\ncome to pass. I pretended to controvert the first of these, for the\npurpose of showing him the extent of my argumentative powers, and said\nthat \"indubitably there were degrees of sinning which would induce the\nAlmighty to throw off the very elect.\" But behold my hitherto humble\nand modest companion took up the argument with such warmth that he put\nme not only to silence but to absolute shame.\n\n\"Why, sir,\" said he, \"by vending such an insinuation, you put discredit\non the great atonement, in which you trust. Is there not enough of\nmerit in the blood of Jesus to save thousands of worlds, if it was for\nthese worlds that he died? Now, when you know, as you do (and as every\none of the elect may know of himself) that this Saviour died for you,\nnamely and particularly, dare you say that there is not enough of merit\nin His great atonement to annihilate all your sins, let them be as\nheinous and atrocious as they may? And, moreover, do you not\nacknowledge that God hath pre-ordained and decreed whatsoever comes to\npass? Then, how is it that you should deem it in your power to eschew\none action of your life, whether good or evil? Depend on it, the advice\nof the great preacher is genuine: 'What thine hand findeth to do, do it\nwith all thy might, for none of us knows what a day may bring forth.'\nThat is, none of us knows what is pre-ordained, but whatever it is\npre-ordained we must do, and none of these things will be laid to our\ncharge.\"\n\nI could hardly believe that these sayings were genuine or orthodox; but\nI soon felt that, instead of being a humble disciple of mine, this new\nacquaintance was to be my guide and director, and all under the humble\nguise of one stooping at my feet to learn the right. He said that he\nsaw I was ordained to perform some great action for the cause of Jesus\nand His Church, and he earnestly coveted being a partaker with me; but\nhe besought of me never to think it possible for me to fall from the\ntruth, or the favour of Him who had chosen me, else that misbelief\nwould baulk every good work to which I set my face.\n\nThere was something so flattering in all this that I could not resist\nit. Still, when he took leave of me, I felt it as a great relief; and\nyet, before the morrow, I wearied and was impatient to see him again.\nWe carried on our fellowship from day to day, and all the while I knew\nnot who he was, and still my mother and reverend father kept insisting\nthat I was an altered youth, changed in my appearance, my manners, and\nmy whole conduct; yet something always prevented me from telling them\nmore about my new acquaintance than I had done on the first day we met.\nI rejoiced in him, was proud of him, and soon could not live without\nhim; yet, though resolved every day to disclose the whole story of my\nconnection with him, I had it not in my power. Something always\nprevented me, till at length I thought no more of it, but resolved to\nenjoy his fascinating company in private, and by all means to keep my\nown with him. The resolution was vain: I set a bold face to it, but my\npowers were inadequate to the task; my adherent, with all the suavity\nimaginable, was sure to carry his point. I sometimes fumed, and\nsometimes shed tears at being obliged to yield to proposals against\nwhich I had at first felt every reasoning power of my soul rise in\nopposition; but for all that he never faded in carrying conviction\nalong with him in effect, for he either forced me to acquiesce in his\nmeasures, and assent to the truth of his positions, or he put me so\ncompletely down that I had not a word left to advance against them.\n\nAfter weeks, and I may say months of intimacy, I observed, somewhat to\nmy amazement, that we had never once prayed together; and, more than\nthat, that he had constantly led my attentions away from that duty,\ncausing me to neglect it wholly. I thought this a bad mark of a man\nseemingly so much set on inculcating certain important points of\nreligion, and resolved next day to put him to the test, and request him\nto perform that sacred duty in name of us both. He objected boldly;\nsaying there were very few people indeed with whom he could join in\nprayer, and he made a point of never doing it, as he was sure they were\nto ask many things of which he disapproved, and that, if he were to\nofficiate himself, he was as certain to allude to many things that came\nnot within the range of their faith. He disapproved of prayer\naltogether in the manner it was generally gone about, he said. Man made\nit merely a selfish concern, and was constantly employed asking,\nasking, for everything. Whereas it became all God's creatures to be\ncontent with their lot, and only to kneel before him in order to thank\nhim for such benefits as he saw meet to bestow. In short, he argued\nwith such energy that before we parted I acquiesced, as usual, in his\nposition, and never mentioned prayer to him any more.\n\nHaving been so frequently seen in his company, several people happened\nto mention the circumstance to my mother and reverend father; but at\nthe same time had all described him differently. At length, they began\nto examine me with respect to the company I kept, as I absented myself\nfrom home day after day. I told them I kept company only with one young\ngentleman, whose whole manner of thinking on religious subjects I found\nso congenial with my own that I could not live out of his society. My\nmother began to lay down some of her old hackneyed rules of faith, but\nI turned from hearing her with disgust; for, after the energy of my new\nfriend's reasoning, hers appeared so tame I could not endure it. And I\nconfess with shame that my reverend preceptor's religious dissertations\nbegan, about this time, to lose their relish very much, and by degrees\nbecame exceedingly tiresome to my ear. They were so inferior, in\nstrength and sublimity, to the most common observations of my young\nfriend that in drawing a comparison the former appeared as nothing. He,\nhowever, examined me about many things relating to my companion, in all\nof which I satisfied him, save in one: I could neither tell him who my\nfriend was, what was his name, nor of whom he was descended; and I\nwondered at myself how I had never once adverted to such a thing for\nall the time we had been intimate.\n\nI inquired the next day what his name was; as I said I was often at a\nloss for it, when talking with him. He replied that there was no\noccasion for any one friend ever naming another, when their society was\nheld in private, as ours was; for his part he had never once named me\nsince we first met, and never intended to do so, unless by my own\nrequest. \"But if you cannot converse without naming me, you may call me\nGil for the present,\" added he, \"and if I think proper to take another\nname at any future period, it shall be with your approbation.\"\n\n\"Gil!\" said I. \"Have you no name but Gil? Or which of your names is it?\nYour Christian or surname?\"\n\n\"Oh, you must have a surname too, must you!\" replied he. \"Very well,\nyou may call me Gil-Martin. It is not my Christian name; but it is a\nname which may serve your turn.\"\n\n\"This is very strange!\" said I. \"Are you ashamed of your parents that\nyou refuse to give your real name?\"\n\n\"I have no parents save one, whom I do not acknowledge,\" said he\nproudly. \"Therefore, pray drop that subject, for it is a disagreeable\none. I am a being of a very peculiar temper, for, though I have\nservants and subjects more than I can number, yet, to gratify a certain\nwhim, I have left them, and retired to this city, and, for all the\nsociety it contains, you see I have attached myself only to you. This\nis a secret, and I tell you only in friendship, therefore pray let it\nremain one, and say not another word about the matter.\"\n\nI assented, and said no more concerning it; for it instantly struck me\nthat this was no other than the Czar Peter of Russia, having heard that\nhe had been travelling through Europe in disguise, and I cannot say\nthat I had not thenceforward great and mighty hopes of high preferment,\nas a defender and avenger of the oppressed Christian Church, under the\ninfluence of this great potentate. He had hinted as much already, as\nthat it was more honourable, and of more avail to put down the wicked\nwith the sword than try to reform them, and I thought myself quite\njustified in supposing that he intended me for some great employment,\nthat he had thus selected me for his companion out of all the rest in\nScotland, and even pretended to learn the great truths of religion from\nmy mouth. From that time I felt disposed to yield to such a great\nprince's suggestions without hesitation.\n\nNothing ever astonished me so much as the uncommon powers with which he\nseemed invested. In our walk one day, we met with a Mr. Blanchard, who\nwas reckoned a worthy, pious divine, but quite of the moral cast, who\njoined us; and we three walked on, and rested together in the fields.\nMy companion did not seem to like him, but, nevertheless, regarded him\nfrequently with deep attention, and there were several times, while he\nseemed contemplating him, and trying to find out his thoughts, that his\nface became so like Mr. Blanchard's that it was impossible to have\ndistinguished the one from the other. The antipathy between the two was\nmutual, and discovered itself quite palpably in a short time. When my\ncompanion the prince was gone, Mr. Blanchard asked me anent him, and I\ntold him that he was a stranger in the city, but a very uncommon and\ngreat personage. Mr. Blanchard's answer to me was as follows: \"I never\nsaw anybody I disliked so much in my life, Mr. Robert; and if it be\ntrue that he is a stranger here, which I doubt, believe me he is come\nfor no good.\"\n\n\"Do you not perceive what mighty powers of mind he is possessed of?\"\nsaid I, \"and also how clear and unhesitating he is on some of the most\ninteresting points of divinity?\"\n\n\"It is for his great mental faculties that I dread him,\" said he. \"It\nis incalculable what evil such a person as he may do, if so disposed.\nThere is a sublimity in his ideas, with which there is to me a mixture\nof terror; and, when he talks of religion, he does it as one that\nrather dreads its truths than reverences them. He, indeed, pretends\ngreat strictness of orthodoxy regarding some of the points of doctrine\nembraced by the reformed church; but you do not seem to perceive that\nboth you and he are carrying these points to a dangerous extremity.\nReligion is a sublime and glorious thing, the bonds of society on\nearth, and the connector of humanity with the Divine nature; but there\nis nothing so dangerous to man as the wresting of any of its\nprinciples, or forcing them beyond their due bounds: this is of all\nothers the readiest way to destruction. Neither is there anything so\neasily done. There is not an error into which a man can fall which he\nmay not press Scripture into his service as proof of the probity of,\nand though your boasted theologian shunned the full discussion of the\nsubject before me, while you pressed it, I can easily see that both you\nand he are carrying your ideas of absolute predestination, and its\nconcomitant appendages, to an extent that overthrows all religion and\nrevelation together; or, at least, jumbles them into a chaos, out of\nwhich human capacity can never select what is good. Believe me, Mr.\nRobert, the less you associate with that illustrious stranger the\nbetter, for it appears to me that your creed and his carries damnation\non the very front of it.\"\n\nI was rather stunned at this; but pretended to smile with disdain, and\nsaid it did not become youth to control age; and, as I knew our\nprinciples differed fundamentally, it behoved us to drop the subject.\nHe, however, would not drop it, but took both my principles and me\nfearfully to task, for Blanchard was an eloquent and powerful-minded\nold man; and, before we parted, I believe I promised to drop my new\nacquaintance, and was all but resolved to do it.\n\nAs well might I have laid my account with shunning the light of day. He\nwas constant to me as my shadow, and by degrees he acquired such an\nascendency over me that I never was happy out of his company, nor\ngreatly so in it. When I repeated to him all that Mr. Blanchard had\nsaid, his countenance kindled with indignation and rage; and then by\ndegrees his eyes sunk inward, his brow lowered, so that I was awed, and\nwithdrew my eyes from looking at him. A while afterwards as I was\naddressing him, I chanced to look him again in the face, and the sight\nof him made me start violently. He had made himself so like Mr.\nBlanchard that I actually believed I had been addressing that\ngentleman, and that I had done so in some absence of mind that I could\nnot account for. Instead of being amused at the quandary I was in, he\nseemed offended: indeed, he never was truly amused with anything. And\nhe then asked me sullenly, if I conceived such personages as he to have\nno other endowments than common mortals?\n\nI said I never conceived that princes or potentates had any greater\nshare of endowments than other men, and frequently not so much. He\nshook his head, and bade me think over the subject again; and there was\nan end of it. I certainly felt every day the more disposed to\nacknowledge such a superiority in him; and, from all that I could\ngather, I had now no doubt that he was Peter of Russia. Everything\ncombined to warrant the supposition, and, of course, I resolved to act\nin conformity with the discovery I had made.\n\nFor several days the subject of Mr. Blanchard's doubts and doctrines\nformed the theme of our discourse. My friend deprecated them most\ndevoutly; and then again he would deplore them, and lament the great\nevil that such a man might do among the human race. I joined with him\nin allowing the evil in its fullest latitude; and, at length, after he\nthought he had fully prepared my nature for such a trial of its powers\nand abilities, he proposed calmly that we two should make away with Mr.\nBlanchard. I was so shocked that my bosom became as it were a void, and\nthe beatings of my heart sounded loud and hollow in it; my breath cut,\nand my tongue and palate became dry and speechless. He mocked at my\ncowardice, and began a-reasoning on the matter with such powerful\neloquence that, before we parted, I felt fully convinced that it was my\nbounden duty to slay Mr. Blanchard; but my will was far, very far from\nconsenting to the deed.\n\nI spent the following night without sleep, or nearly so; and the next\nmorning, by the time the sun arose, I was again abroad, and in the\ncompany of my illustrious friend. The same subject was resumed, and\nagain he reasoned to the following purport: That supposing me placed at\nthe head of any army of Christian soldiers, all bent on putting down\nthe enemies of the Church, would I have any hesitation in destroying\nand rooting out these enemies? None, surely. Well then, when I saw and\nwas convinced that here was an individual who was doing more detriment\nto the Church of Christ on earth than tens of thousands of such\nwarriors were capable of doing, was it not my duty to cut him off, and\nsave the elect? \"He who would be a champion in the cause of Christ and\nHis Church, my brave young friend,\" added he, \"must begin early, and no\nman can calculate to what an illustrious eminence small beginnings may\nlead. If the man Blanchard is worthy, he is only changing his situation\nfor a better one; and, if unworthy, it is better that one fall than\nthat a thousand souls perish. Let us be up and doing in our vocations.\nFor me, my resolution is taken; I have but one great aim in this world,\nand I never for a moment lose sight of it.\"\n\nI was obliged to admit the force of his reasoning; for, though I cannot\nfrom memory repeat his words, his eloquence was of that overpowering\nnature that the subtilty of other men sunk before it; and there is also\nlittle doubt that the assurance I had that these words were spoken by a\ngreat potentate who could raise me to the highest eminence (provided\nthat I entered into his extensive and decisive measures) assisted\nmightily in dispelling my youthful scruples and qualms of conscience;\nand I thought moreover that, having such a powerful back friend to\nsupport me, I hardly needed to be afraid of the consequences. I\nconsented! But begged a little time to think of it. He said the less\none thought of a duty the better; and we parted.\n\nBut the most singular instance of this wonderful man's power over my\nmind was that he had as complete influence over me by night as by day.\nAll my dreams corresponded exactly with his suggestions; and, when he\nwas absent from me, still his arguments sunk deeper in my heart than\neven when he was present. I dreamed that night of a great triumph\nobtained, and, though the whole scene was but dimly and confusedly\ndefined in my vision, yet the overthrow and death of Mr. Blanchard was\nthe first step by which I attained the eminent station I occupied.\nThus, by dreaming of the event by night, and discoursing of it by day,\nit soon became so familiar to my mind that I almost conceived it as\ndone. It was resolved on: which was the first and greatest victory\ngained; for there was no difficulty in finding opportunities enow of\ncutting off a man who, every good day, was to be found walking by\nhimself in private grounds. I went and heard him preach for two days,\nand in fact I held his tenets scarcely short of blasphemy; they were\nsuch as I had never heard before, and his congregation, which was\nnumerous, were turning up their ears and drinking in his doctrines with\nthe utmost delight; for Oh they suited their carnal natures and\nself-sufficiency to a hair! He was actually holding it forth, as a\nfact, that \"it was every man's own blame if he was not saved!\" What\nhorrible misconstruction! And then he was alleging, and trying to prove\nfrom nature and reason, that no man ever was guilty of a sinful action\nwho might not have declined it had he so chosen! \"Wretched\ncontrovertist!\" thought I to myself an hundred times, \"shall not the\nsword of the Lord be moved from its place of peace for such\npresumptuous, absurd testimonies as these!\"\n\nWhen I began to tell the prince about these false doctrines, to my\nastonishment I found that he had been in the church himself, and had\nevery argument that the old divine had used verbatim; and he remarked\non them with great concern that these were not the tenets that\ncorresponded with his views in society, and that he had agents in every\ncity, and every land, exerting their powers to put them down. I asked,\nwith great simplicity: \"Are all your subjects Christians, prince?\"\n\n\"All my European subjects are, or deem themselves so,\" returned he;\n\"and they are the most faithful and true subjects I have.\"\n\nWho could doubt, after this, that he was the Czar of Russia? I have\nnevertheless had reasons to doubt of his identity since that period,\nand which of my conjectures is right I believe the God of Heaven only\nknows, for I do not. I shall go on to write such things as I remember,\nand, if anyone shall ever take the trouble to read over these\nconfessions, such a one will judge for himself. It will be observed\nthat, since ever I fell in with this extraordinary person, I have\nwritten about him only, and I must continue to do so to the end of this\nmemoir, as I have performed no great or interesting action in which he\nhad not a principal share.\n\nHe came to me one day and said: \"We must not linger thus in executing\nwhat we have resolved on. We have much before our hands to perform for\nthe benefit of mankind, both civil as well as religious. Let us do what\nwe have to do here, and then we must wend our way to other cities, and\nperhaps to other countries. Mr. Blanchard is to hold forth in the high\nchurch of Paisley on Sunday next, on some particularly great occasion:\nthis must be defeated; he must not go there. As he will be busy\narranging his discourses, we may expect him to be walking by himself in\nFinnieston Dell the greater part of Friday and Saturday. Let us go and\ncut him off. What is the life of a man more than the life of a lamb, or\nany guiltless animal? It is not half so much, especially when we\nconsider the immensity of the mischief this old fellow is working among\nour fellow-creatures. Can there be any doubt that it is the duty of one\nconsecrated to God to cut off such a mildew?\"\n\n\"I fear me, great sovereign,\" said I, \"that your ideas of retribution\nare too sanguine, and too arbitrary for the laws of this country. I\ndispute not that your motives are great and high; but have you debated\nthe consequences, and settled the result?\"\n\n\"I have,\" returned be, \"and hold myself amenable for the action to the\nlaws of God and of equity; as to the enactments of men, I despise them.\nFain would I see the weapon of the Lord of Hosts begin the work of\nvengeance that awaits it to do!\"\n\nI could not help thinking that I perceived a little derision of\ncountenance on his face as he said this, nevertheless I sunk dumb\nbefore such a man, aroused myself to the task, seeing he would not have\nit deferred. I approved of it in theory, but my spirit stood aloof from\nthe practice. I saw and was convinced that the elect of God would be\nhappier, and purer, were the wicked and unbelievers all cut off from\ntroubling and misleading them, but if it had not been the instigations\nof this illustrious stranger, I should never have presumed to begin so\ngreat a work myself. Yet, though he often aroused my zeal to the\nhighest pitch, still my heart at times shrunk from the shedding of\nlife-blood, and it was only at the earnest and unceasing instigations\nof my enlightened and voluntary patron that I at length put my hand to\nthe conclusive work. After I said all that I could say, and all had\nbeen overborne (I remember my actions and words as well as it had been\nyesterday), I turned round hesitatingly, and looked up to Heaven for\ndirection; but there was a dimness come over my eyes that I could not\nsee. The appearance was as if there had been a veil drawn over me, so\nnigh that I put up my hand to feel it; and then Gil-Martin (as this\ngreat sovereign was pleased to have himself called) frowned, and asked\nme what I was grasping at. I knew not what to say, but answered, with\nfear and shame: \"I have no weapons, not one; nor know I where any are\nto be found.\"\n\n\"The God whom thou servest will provide these,\" said he, \"if thou\nprovest worthy of the trust committed to thee.\"\n\nI looked again up into the cloudy veil that covered us and thought I\nbeheld golden weapons of every description let down in it, but all with\ntheir points towards me. I kneeled, and was going to stretch out my\nhand to take one, when my patron seized me, as I thought, by the\nclothes, and dragged me away with as much ease as I had been a lamb,\nsaying, with a joyful and elevated voice: \"Come, my friend, let us\ndepart: thou art dreaming--thou art dreaming. Rouse up all the energies\nof thy exalted mind, for thou art an highly favoured one; and doubt\nthou not that He whom thou servest, will be ever at thy right and left\nhand, to direct and assist thee.\"\n\nThese words, but particularly the vision I had seen, of the golden\nweapons descending out of Heaven, inflamed my zeal to that height that\nI was as one beside himself; which my parents perceived that night, and\nmade some motions towards confining me to my room. I joined in the\nfamily prayers, and then I afterwards sung a psalm and prayed by\nmyself; and I had good reasons for believing that that small oblation\nof praise and prayer was not turned to sin. But there are strange\nthings, and unaccountable agencies in nature: He only who dwells\nbetween the Cherubim can unriddle them, and to Him the honour must\nredound for ever. Amen.\n\nI felt greatly strengthened and encouraged that night, and the next\nmorning I ran to meet my companion, out of whose eye I had now no life.\nHe rejoiced at seeing me so forward in the great work of reformation by\nblood, and said many things to raise my hopes of future fame and glory;\nand then producing two pistols of pure beaten gold, he held them out\nand proffered me the choice of one, saying: \"See what thy master hath\nprovided thee!\" I took one of them eagerly, for I perceived at once\nthat they were two of the very weapons that were let down from Heaven\nin the cloudy veil, the dim tapestry of the firmament; and I said to\nmyself. \"Surely this is the will of the Lord.\"\n\nThe little splendid and enchanting piece was so perfect, so complete,\nand so ready for executing the will of the donor, that I now longed to\nuse it in his service. I loaded it with my own hand, as Gil-Martin did\nthe other, and we took our stations behind a bush of hawthorn and\nbramble on the verge of the wood, and almost close to the walk. My\npatron was so acute in all his calculations that he never mistook an\nevent. We had not taken our stand above a minute and a half till old\nMr. Blanchard appeared, coming slowly on the path. When we saw this, we\ncowered down and leaned each of us a knee upon the ground, pointing\nthe pistols through the bush, with an aim so steady that it was\nimpossible to miss our victim.\n\nHe came deliberately on, pausing at times so long that we dreaded he\nwas going to turn. Gil-Martin dreaded it, and I said I did, but wished\nin my heart that he might. He, however, came onward, and I will never\nforget the manner in which he came! No, I don't believe I ever can\nforget it, either in the narrow bounds of time or the ages of eternity!\nHe was a broadly, ill-shaped man, of a rude exterior, and a little bent\nwith age; his hands were clasped behind his back and below his coat,\nand he walked with a slow swinging air that was very peculiar. When he\npaused and looked abroad on nature, the act was highly impressive: he\nseemed conscious of being all alone, and conversant only with God and\nthe elements of his creation. Never was there such a picture of human\ninadvertency! a man approaching step by step to the one that was to\nhurl him out of one existence into another with as much ease and\nindifference as the ox goeth to the stall. Hideous vision, wilt thou\nnot be gone from my mental sight! if not, let me bear with thee as I\ncan!\n\nWhen he came straight opposite to the muzzles of our pieces, Gil-Martin\ncalled out \"Eh!\" with a short quick sound. The old man, without\nstarting, turned his face and breast towards us, and looked into the\nwood, but looked over our heads.\n\n\"Now!\" whispered my companion, and fired. But my hand refused the\noffice, for I was not at that moment sure about becoming an assassin in\nthe cause of Christ and His Church. I thought I heard a sweet voice\nbehind me, whispering to me to beware, and I was going to look round,\nwhen my companion exclaimed: \"Coward, we are ruined!\"\n\nI had no time for an alternative: Gil-Martin's ball had not taken\neffect, which was altogether wonderful, as the old man's breast was\nwithin a few yards of him. \"Hilloa!\" cried Blanchard, \"what is that\nfor, you dog!\" and with that he came forward to look over the bush. I\nhesitated, as I said, and attempted to look behind me; but there was no\ntime: the next step discovered two assassins lying in covert, waiting\nfor blood. \"Coward, we are ruined!\" cried my indignant friend; and that\nmoment my piece was discharged. The effect was as might have been\nexpected: the old man first stumbled to one side, and then fell on his\nback. We kept our places, and I perceived my companion's eyes gleaming\nwith an unnatural joy. The wounded man raised himself from the bank to\na sitting posture, and I beheld his eyes swimming; he however appeared\nsensible, for we heard him saying in a low and rattling voice: \"Alas,\nalas! whom have I offended, that they should have been driven to an act\nlike this! Come forth and shew yourselves, that I may either forgive\nyou before I die, or curse you in the name of the Lord.\" He then fell\na-groping with both hands on the ground, as if feeling for something he\nhad lost manifestly in the agonies of death; and, with a solemn and\ninterrupted prayer for forgiveness, he breathed his last.\n\nI had become rigid as a statue, whereas my associate appeared to be\nelevated above measure. \"Arise, thou faint-hearted one, and let us be\ngoing,\" said he. \"Thou hast done well for once; but wherefore hesitate\nin such a cause? This is but a small beginning of so great a work as\nthat of purging the Christian world. But the first victim is a worthy\none, and more of such lights must be extinguished immediately.\"\n\nWe touched not our victim, nor anything pertaining to him, for fear of\nstaining our hands with his blood; and the firing having brought three\nmen within view, who were hasting towards the spot, my undaunted\ncompanion took both the pistols, and went forward as with intent to\nmeet them, bidding me shift for myself. I ran off in a contrary\ndirection, till I came to the foot of the Pearman Sike, and then,\nrunning up the hollow of that, I appeared on the top of the bank as if\nI had been another man brought in view by hearing the shots in such a\nplace. I had a full view of a part of what passed, though not of all. I\nsaw my companion going straight to meet the men, apparently with a\npistol in every hand, waving in a careless manner. They seemed not\nquite clear of meeting with him, and so he went straight on, and passed\nbetween them. They looked after him, and came onwards; but, when they\ncame to the old man lying stretched in his blood, then they turned and\npursued my companion, though not so quickly as they might have done;\nand I understand that from the first they saw no more of him.\n\nGreat was the confusion that day in Glasgow. The most popular of all\ntheir preachers of morality was (what they called) murdered in cold\nblood, and a strict and extensive search was made for the assassin.\nNeither of the accomplices was found, however, that is certain, nor was\neither of them so much as suspected; but another man was apprehended\nunder circumstances that warranted suspicion. This was one of the\nthings that I witnessed in my life, which I never understood, and it\nsurely was one of my patron's most dexterous tricks, for I must still\nsay, what I have thought from the beginning, that like him there never\nwas a man created. The young man who was taken up was a preacher; and\nit was proved that he had purchased fire-arms in town, and gone out\nwith them that morning. But the far greatest mystery of the whole was\nthat two of the men, out of the three who met my companion, swore that\nthat unfortunate preacher was the man whom they met with a pistol in\neach hand, fresh from the death of the old divine. The poor fellow made\na confused speech himself, which there is not the least doubt was quite\ntrue; but it was laughed to scorn, and an expression of horror ran\nthrough both the hearers and jury. I heard the whole trial, and so did\nGil-Martin; but we left the journeyman preacher to his fate, and from\nthat time forth I have had no faith in the justice of criminal trials.\nIf once a man is prejudiced on one side, he will swear anything in\nsupport of such prejudice. I tried to expostulate with my mysterious\nfriend on the horrid injustice of suffering this young man to die for\nour act, but the prince exulted in it more than the other, and said the\nlatter was the most dangerous man of the two.\n\nThe alarm in and about Glasgow was prodigious. The country being\ndivided into two political parties, the court and the country party,\nthe former held meetings, issued proclamations, and offered rewards,\nascribing all to the violence of party spirit, and deprecating the\ninfernal measures of their opponents. I did not understand their\npolitical differences; but it was easy to see that the true Gospel\npreachers joined all on one side, and the upholders of pure morality\nand a blameless life on the other, so that this division proved a test\nto us, and it was forthwith resolved that we two should pick out some\nof the leading men of this unsaintly and heterodox cabal, and cut them\noff one by one, as occasion should suit.\n\nNow, the ice being broke, I felt considerable zeal in our great work,\nbut pretended much more; and we might soon have kidnapped them all\nthrough the ingenuity of my patron, had not our next attempt\nmiscarried, by some awkwardness or mistake of mine. The consequence was\nthat he was discovered fairly, and very nigh seized. I also was seen,\nand suspected so far that my reverend father, my mother, and myself\nwere examined privately. I denied all knowledge of the matter; and they\nheld it in such a ridiculous light, and their conviction of the\ncomplete groundlessness of the suspicion was so perfect, that their\ntestimony prevailed, and the affair was hushed. I was obliged, however,\nto walk circumspectly, and saw my companion the prince very seldom, who\nwas prowling about every day, quite unconcerned about his safety. He\nwas every day a new man, however, and needed not to be alarmed at any\ndanger; for such a facility had he in disguising himself that, if it\nhad not been for a password which we had between us, for the purposes\nof recognition, I never could have known him myself.\n\nIt so happened that my reverend father was called to Edinburgh about\nthis time, to assist with his counsel in settling the national affairs.\nAt my earnest request I was permitted to accompany him, at which both\nmy associate and I rejoiced, as we were now about to move in a new and\nextensive field. All this time I never knew where my illustrious friend\nresided. He never once invited me to call on him at his lodgings, nor\ndid he ever come to our house, which made me sometimes to suspect that,\nif any of our great efforts in the cause of true religion were\ndiscovered, he intended leaving me in the lurch. Consequently, when we\nmet in Edinburgh (for we travelled not in company), I proposed to go\nwith him to look for lodgings, telling him at the same time what a\nblessed religious family my reverend instructor and I were settled in.\nHe said he rejoiced at it, but he made a rule of never lodging in any\nparticular house, but took these daily, or hourly, as he found it\nconvenient, and that he never was at a loss in any circumstance.\n\n\"What a mighty trouble you put yourself to, great sovereign!\" said I,\n\"and all, it would appear, for the purpose of seeing and knowing more\nand more of the human race.\"\n\n\"I never go but where I have some great purpose to serve,\" returned he,\n\"either in the advancement of my own power and dominion or in thwarting\nmy enemies.\"\n\n\"With all due deference to your great comprehension, my illustrious\nfriend,\" said I, \"it strikes me that you can accomplish very little\neither the one way or the other here, in the humble and private\ncapacity you are pleased to occupy.\"\n\n\"It is your own innate modesty that prompts such a remark,\" said he.\n\"Do you think the gaining of you to my service is not an attainment\nworthy of being envied by the greatest potentate in Christendom? Before\nI had missed such a prize as the attainment of your services, I would\nhave travelled over one half of the habitable globe.\"--I bowed with\ngreat humility, but at the same time how could I but feel proud and\nhighly flattered? He continued: \"Believe me, my dear friend, for such a\nprize I account no effort too high. For a man who is not only dedicated\nto the King of Heaven in the most solemn manner, soul, body, and\nspirit, but also chosen of him from the beginning, justified,\nsanctified, and received into a communion that never shall be broken,\nand from which no act of his shall ever remove him--the possession of\nsuch a man, I tell you, is worth kingdoms; because, every deed that he\nperforms, he does it with perfect safety to himself and honour to\nme.\"--I bowed again, lifting my hat, and he went on.-- \"I am now going\nto put his courage in the cause he has espoused to a severe test--to a\ntrial at which common nature would revolt, but he who is dedicated to\nbe the sword of the Lord must raise himself above common humanity. You\nhave a father and a brother according to the flesh: what do you know of\nthem?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I know nothing good,\" said I. \"They are reprobates,\ncastaways, beings devoted to the Wicked One, and, like him, workers of\nevery species of iniquity with greediness.\"\n\n\"They must both fall!\" said he, with a sigh and melancholy look. \"It is\ndecreed in the councils above that they must both fall by your hand.\"\n\n\"The God of Heaven forbid it!\" said I. \"They are enemies to Christ and\nHis Church, that I know and believe; but they shall live and die in\ntheir iniquity for me, and reap their guerdon when their time cometh.\nThere my hand shall not strike.\"\n\n\"The feeling is natural, and amiable,\" said he. \"But you must think\nagain. Whether are the bonds of carnal nature or the bonds and vows of\nthe Lord strongest?\"\n\n\"I will not reason with you on this head, mighty potentate,\" said I,\n\"for whenever I do so it is but to be put down. I shall only, express\nmy determination not to take vengeance out of the Lord's hand in this\ninstance. It availeth not. These are men that have the mark of the\nbeast in their foreheads and right hands; they are lost beings\nthemselves, but have no influence over others. Let them perish in their\nsins; for they shall not be meddled with by me.\"\n\n\"How preposterously you talk, my dear friend!\" said he. \"These people\nare your greatest enemies; they would rejoice to see you annihilated.\nAnd, now that you have taken up the Lord's cause of being avenged on\nHis enemies, wherefore spare those that are your own as well as His?\nBesides, you ought to consider what great advantages would be derived\nto the cause of righteousness and truth were the estate and riches of\nthat opulent house in your possession, rather than in that of such as\noppose the truth and all manner of holiness.\"\n\nThis was a portion of the consequence of following my illustrious\nadviser's summary mode of procedure that had never entered into my\ncalculation. I disclaimed all idea of being influenced by it; however,\nI cannot but say that the desire of being enabled to do so much good,\nby the possession of these bad men's riches, made some impression on my\nheart, and I said I would consider of the matter. I did consider it,\nand that right seriously as well as frequently; and there was scarcely\nan hour in the day on which my resolves were not animated by my great\nfriend, till at length I began to have a longing desire to kill my\nbrother, in particular. Should any man ever read this scroll, he will\nwonder at this confession, and deem it savage and unnatural. So it\nappeared to me at first, but a constant thinking of an event changes\nevery one of its features. I have done all for the best, and as I was\nprompted, by one who knew right and wrong much better than I did. I had\na desire to slay him, it is true, and such a desire too as a thirsty\nman has to drink; but, at the same time, this longing desire was\nmingled with a certain terror, as if I had dreaded that the drink for\nwhich I longed was mixed with deadly poison. My mind was so much\nweakened, or rather softened about this time, that my faith began a\nlittle to give way, and I doubted most presumptuously of the least\ntangible of all Christian tenets, namely, of the infallibility of the\nelect. I hardly comprehended the great work I had begun, and doubted of\nmy own infallibility, or that of any created being. But I was brought\nover again by the unwearied diligence of my friend to repent of my\nbacksliding, and view once more the superiority of the Almighty's\ncounsels in its fullest latitude. Amen.\n\nI prayed very much in secret about this time, and that with great\nfervour of spirit, as well as humility; and my satisfaction at finding\nall my requests granted is not to be expressed.\n\nMy illustrious friend still continuing to sound in my ears the\nimperious duty to which I was called, of making away with my sinful\nrelations, and quoting many parallel actions out of the Scriptures, and\nthe writings of the holy fathers, of the pleasure the Lord took in such\nas executed his vengeance on the wicked, I was obliged to acquiesce in\nhis measures, though with certain limitations. It was not easy to\nanswer his arguments, and yet I was afraid that he soon perceived a\nleaning to his will on my part. \"If the acts of Jehu, in rooting out\nthe whole house of his master, were ordered and approved-of by the\nLord,\" said he, \"would it not have been more praiseworthy if one of\nAhab's own sons had stood up for the cause of the God of Israel, and\nrooted out the sinners and their idols out of the land?\"\n\n\"It would certainly,\" said I. \"To our duty to God all other duties must\nyield.\"\n\n\"Go thou then and do likewise,\" said he. \"Thou are called to a high\nvocation; to cleanse the sanctuary of thy God in this thy native land\nby the shedding of blood; go thou then like a ruling energy, a master\nspirit of desolation in the dwellings of the wicked, and high shall be\nyour reward both here and hereafter.\"\n\nMy heart now panted with eagerness to look my brother in the face. On\nwhich my companion, who was never out of the way, conducted me to a\nsmall square in the suburbs of the city, where there were a number of\nyoung noblemen and gentlemen playing at a vain, idle, and sinful game,\nat which there was much of the language of the accursed going on; and\namong these blasphemers he instantly pointed out my brother to me. I\nwas fired with indignation at seeing him in such company, and so\nemployed; and I placed myself close beside him to watch all his\nmotions, listen to his words, and draw inferences from what I saw and\nheard. In what a sink of sin was he wallowing! I resolved to take him\nto task, and, if he refused to be admonished, to inflict on him some\ncondign punishment; and, knowing that my illustrious friend and\ndirector was looking on, I resolved to show some spirit. Accordingly, I\nwaited until I heard him profane his Maker's name three times, and\nthen, my spiritual indignation being roused above all restraint, I went\nup and kicked him. Yes, I went boldly up and struck him with my foot,\nand meant to have given him a more severe blow than it was my fortune\nto inflict. It had, however, the effect of rousing up his corrupt\nnature to quarrelling and strife, instead of taking the chastisement of\nthe Lord in humility and meekness. He ran furiously against me in the\ncholer that is always inspired by the wicked one; but I overthrew him,\nby reason of impeding the natural and rapid progress of his unholy feet\nrunning to destruction. I also fell slightly; but his fall proved a\nsevere one, he arose in wrath, and struck me with the mall which he\nheld in his hand, until my blood flowed copiously; and from that moment\nI vowed his destruction in my heart. But I chanced to have no weapon at\nthat time, nor any means of inflicting due punishment on the caitiff,\nwhich would not have been returned double on my head by him and his\ngraceless associates. I mixed among them at the suggestion of my\nfriend, and, following them to their den of voluptuousness and sin, I\nstrove to be admitted among them, in hopes of finding some means of\naccomplishing my great purpose, while I found myself moved by the\nspirit within me so to do. But I was not only debarred, but, by the\nmachinations of my wicked brother and his associates, cast into prison.\n\nI was not sorry at being thus honoured to suffer in the cause of\nrighteousness, and at the hands of sinful men; and, as soon as I was\nalone, I betook myself to prayer, deprecating the long-suffering of God\ntowards such horrid sinners. My jailer came to me, and insulted me. He\nwas a rude unprincipled fellow, partaking of the loose and carnal\nmanners of the age; but I remembered of having read, in the Cloud of\nWitnesses, of such men formerly having been converted by the imprisoned\nsaints; so I set myself, with all my heart, to bring about this man's\nrepentance and reformation.\n\n\"Fat the deil are ye yoolling an' praying that gate for, man?\" said he,\ncoming angrily in. \"I thought the days o' praying prisoners had been a'\nower. We hath rowth o' them aince; an' they were the poorest an' the\nblackest bargains that ever poor jailers saw. Gie up your crooning, or\nI'll pit you to an in-by place, where ye sall get plenty o't.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said I, \"I am making my appeal at the bar where all human\nactions are seen and judged, and where you shall not be forgot, sinful\nas you are. Go in peace, and let me be.\"\n\n\"Hae ye naebody nearer-hand hame to mak your appeal to, man?\" said he.\n\"Because an ye hae-na, I dread you an' me may be unco weel acquaintit\nby an' by.\"\n\nI then opened up the mysteries of religion to him in a clear and\nperspicuous manner, but particularly the great doctrine of the election\nof grace; and then I added: \"Now, friend, you must tell me if you\npertain to this chosen number. It is in every man's power to ascertain\nthis, and it is every man's duty to do it.\"\n\n\"An' fat the better wad you be for the kenning o' this, man?\" said he.\n\n\"Because, if you are one of my brethren, I will take you into sweet\ncommunion and fellowship,\" returned I. \"But, if you belong to the\nunregenerate, I have a commission to slay you.\"\n\n\"The deil you hae, callant!\" said he, gaping and laughing. \"An', pray\nnow, fa was it, that gae you siccan a braw commission?\"\n\n\"My commission is sealed by the signet above,\" said I, \"and that I will\nlet you and all sinners know. I am dedicated to it by the most solemn\nvows and engagements. I am the sword of the Lord, and Famine and\nPestilence are my sisters. Woe then to the wicked of this land, for\nthey must fall down dead together, that the Church may be purified!\"\n\n\"Oo, foo, foo! I see how it is,\" said he. \"Yours is a very braw\ncommission, but you will have the small opportunity of carrying it\nthrough here. Take my advising, and write a bit of a letter to your\nfriends, and I will send it, for this is no place for such a great man.\nIf you cannot steady your hand to write, as I see you have been at your\ngreat work, a word of a mouth may do; for I do assure you this is not\nthe place at all, of any in the world, for your operations.\"\n\nThe man apparently thought I was deranged in my intellect. He could not\nswallow such great truths at the first morsel. So I took his advice,\nand sent a line to my reverend father, who was not long in coming, and\ngreat was the jailer's wonderment when he saw all the great Christian\nnoblemen of the land sign my bond of freedom.\n\nMy reverend father took this matter greatly to heart, and bestirred\nhimself in the good cause till the transgressors were ashamed to shew\ntheir faces. My illustrious companion was not idle: I wondered that he\ncame not to me in prison, nor at my release; but he was better\nemployed, in stirring up the just to the execution of God's decrees;\nand he succeeded so well that my brother and all his associates had\nnearly fallen victims to their wrath. But many were wounded, bruised,\nand imprisoned, and much commotion prevailed in the city. For my part,\nI was greatly strengthened in my resolution by the anathemas of my\nreverend father, who, privately (that is in a family capacity) in his\nprayers, gave up my father and brother, according to the flesh, to\nSatan, making it plain to all my senses of perception that they were\nbeing given up of God, to be devoured by fiends of men, at their will\nand pleasure, and that whosoever should slay them would do God good\nservice.\n\nThe next morning my illustrious friend met me at an early hour, and he\nwas greatly overjoyed at hearing my sentiments now chime so much in\nunison with his own. I said: \"I longed for the day and the hour that I\nmight look my brother in the face at Gilgal, and visit on him the\niniquity of his father and himself, for that I was now strengthened and\nprepared for the deed.\"\n\n\"I have been watching the steps and movements of the profligate one,\"\nsaid he, \"and, lo, I will take you straight to his presence. Let your\nheart be as the heart of the lion, and your arms strong as the shekels\nof brass, and swift to avenge as the bolt that descendeth from heaven,\nfor the blood of the just and the good hath long flowed in Scotland.\nBut already is the day of their avengement begun; the hero is at length\narisen who shall send all such as bear enmity to the true Church, or\ntrust in works of their own, to Tophet!\"\n\nThus encouraged, I followed my friend, who led me directly to the same\ncourt in which I had chastised the miscreant on the foregoing day; and,\nbehold, there was the same group again assembled. They eyed me with\nterror in their looks, as I walked among them and eyed them with looks\nof disapprobation and rebuke; and I saw that the very eye of a chosen\none lifted on these children of Belial was sufficient to dismay and put\nthem to flight. I walked aside to my friend, who stood at a distance\nlooking on, and he said to me: \"What thinkest thou now?\" and I answered\nin the words of the venal prophet, \"Lo, now, if I had a sword into mine\nhand I would even kill him.\"\n\n\"Wherefore lackest thou it?\" said he. \"Dost thou not see that they\ntremble at thy presence, knowing that the avenger of blood is among\nthem.\"\n\nMy heart was lifted up on hearing this, and again I strode into the\nmidst of them, and, eyeing them with threatening looks, they were so\nmuch confounded that they abandoned their sinful pastime, and fled\neveryone to his house!\n\nThis was a palpable victory gained over the wicked, and I thereby knew\nthat the hand of the Lord was with me. My companion also exulted, and\nsaid: \"Did not I tell thee? Behold thou dost not know one half of thy\nmight, or of the great things thou art destined to do. Come with me and\nI will show thee more than this, for these young men cannot subsist\nwithout the exercises of sin. I listened to their councils, and I know\nwhere they will meet again.\"\n\nAccordingly he led me a little farther to the south, and we walked\naside till by degrees we saw some people begin to assemble; and in a\nshort time we perceived the same group stripping off their clothes to\nmake them more expert in the practice of madness and folly. Their game\nwas begun before we approached, and so also were the oaths and cursing.\nI put my hands in my pockets, and walked with dignity and energy into\nthe midst of them. It was enough. Terror and astonishment seized them.\nA few of them cried out against me, but their voices were soon hushed\namid the murmurs of fear. One of them, in the name of the rest, then\ncame and besought of me to grant them liberty to amuse themselves; but\nI refused peremptorily, dared the whole multitude so much as to touch\nme with one of their fingers, and dismissed them in the name of the\nLord.\n\nAgain they all fled and dispersed at my eye, and I went home in\ntriumph, escorted by my friend, and some well-meaning young Christians,\nwho, however, had not learned to deport themselves with soberness and\nhumility. But my ascendancy over my enemies was great indeed; for\nwherever I appeared I was hailed with approbation, and, wherever my\nguilty brother made his appearance, he was hooted and held in derision,\ntill he was forced to hide his disgraceful head, and appear no more in\npublic.\n\nImmediately after this I was seized with a strange distemper, which\nneither my friends nor physicians could comprehend, and it confined me\nto my chamber for many days; but I knew, myself, that I was bewitched,\nand suspected my father's reputed concubine of the deed. I told my\nfears to my reverend protector, who hesitated concerning them, but I\nknew by his words and looks that he was conscious I was right. I\ngenerally conceived myself to be two people. When I lay in bed, I\ndeemed there were two of us in it; when I sat up I always beheld\nanother person, and always in the same position from the place where I\nsat or stood, which was about three paces off me towards my left side.\nIt mattered not how many or how few were present: this my second self\nwas sure to be present in his place, and this occasioned a confusion in\nall my words and ideas that utterly astounded my friends, who all\ndeclared that, instead of being deranged in my intellect, they had\nnever heard my conversation manifest so much energy or sublimity of\nconception; but, for all that, over the singular delusion that I was\ntwo persons my reasoning faculties had no power. The most perverse part\nof it was that I rarely conceived myself to be any of the two persons.\nI thought for the most part that my companion was one of them, and my\nbrother the other; and I found that, to be obliged to speak and answer\nin the character of another man, was a most awkward business at the\nlong run.\n\nWho can doubt, from this statement, that I was bewitched, and that my\nrelatives were at the ground of it? The constant and unnatural\npersuasion that I was my brother proved it to my own satisfaction, and\nmust, I think, do so to every unprejudiced person. This victory of the\nWicked One over me kept me confined in my chamber at Mr. Millar's house\nfor nearly a month, until the prayers of the faithful prevailed, and I\nwas restored. I knew it was a chastisement for my pride, because my\nheart was lifted up at my superiority over the enemies of the Church;\nnevertheless I determined to make short work with the aggressor, that\nthe righteous might not be subjected to the effect of his diabolical\narts again.\n\nI say I was confined a month. I beg he that readeth to take note of\nthis, that he may estimate how much the word, or even the oath, of a\nwicked man is to depend on. For a month I saw no one but such as came\ninto my room, and, for all that, it will be seen that there were plenty\nof the same set to attest upon oath that I saw my brother every day\nduring this period; that I persecuted him, with my presence day and\nnight, while all the time I never saw his face save in a delusive\ndream. I cannot comprehend what manoeuvres my illustrious friend was\nplaying off with them about this time; for he, having the art of\npersonating whom he chose, had peradventure deceived them, else many of\nthem had never all attested the same thing. I never saw any man so\nsteady in his friendships and attentions as he; but as he made a rule\nof never calling at private houses, for fear of some discovery being\nmade of his person, so I never saw him while my malady lasted; but, as\nsoon as I grew better, I knew I had nothing ado but to attend at some\nof our places of meeting to see him again. He was punctual, as usual,\nand I had not to wait.\n\nMy reception was precisely as I apprehended. There was no flaring, no\nflummery, nor bombastical pretensions, but a dignified return to my\nobeisance, and an immediate recurrence, in converse, to the important\nduties incumbent on us, in our stations, as reformers and purifiers of\nthe Church.\n\n\"I have marked out a number of most dangerous characters in this city,\"\nsaid he, \"all of whom must be cut off from cumbering the true vineyard\nbefore we leave this land. And, if you bestir not yourself in the work\nto which you are called, I must raise up others who shall have the\nhonour of it!\"\n\n\"I am, most illustrious prince, wholly at your service,\" said I. \"Show\nbut what ought to be done, and here is the heart to dare and the hand\nto execute. You pointed out my relations, according to the flesh, as\nbrands fitted to be thrown into the burning. I approve peremptorily of\nthe award; nay, I thirst to accomplish it; for I myself have suffered\nseverely from their diabolical arts. When once that trial of my\ndevotion to the faith is accomplished, then be your future operations\ndisclosed.\"\n\n\"You are free of your words and promises,\" said he.\n\n\"So will I be of my deeds in the service of my master, and that shalt\nthou see,\" said I. \"I lack not the spirit, nor the will, but I lack\nexperience woefully; and, because of that shortcoming, must bow to your\nsuggestions!\"\n\n\"Meet me here to-morrow betimes,\" said he, \"and perhaps you may hear of\nsome opportunity of displaying your zeal in the cause of righteousness.\"\n\nI met him as he desired me; and he addressed me with a hurried and\njoyful expression, telling me that my brother was astir, and that a few\nminutes ago he had seen him pass on his way to the mountain. \"The hill\nis wrapped in a cloud,\" added he, \"and never was there such an\nopportunity of executing divine justice on a guilty sinner. You may\ntrace him in the dew, and shall infallibly find him on the top of some\nprecipice; for it is only in secret that he dares show his debased head\nto the sun.\"\n\n\"I have no arms, else assuredly I would pursue him and discomfit him,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"Here is a small dagger,\" said he; \"I have nothing of weaponkind about\nme save that, but it is a potent one; and, should you require it, there\nis nothing more ready or sure.\"\n\n\"Will not you accompany me?\" said I. \"Sure you will?\"\n\n\"I will be with you, or near you,\" said he. \"Go you on before.\"\n\nI hurried away as he directed me, and imprudently asked some of\nQueensberry's guards if such and such a young man passed by them going\nout from the city. I was answered in the affirmative, and till then had\ndoubted of my friend's intelligence, it was so inconsistent with a\nprofligate's life to be so early astir. When I got the certain\nintelligence that my brother was before me, I fell a-running, scarcely\nknowing what I did; and, looking several times behind me, I perceived\nnothing of my zealous and arbitrary friend. The consequence of this was\nthat, by the time I reached St. Anthony's well, my resolution began to\ngive way. It was not my courage, for, now that I had once shed blood in\nthe cause of the true faith, I was exceedingly bold and ardent, but,\nwhenever I was left to myself, I was subject to sinful doubtings. These\nalways hankered on one point. I doubted if the elect were infallible,\nand if the Scripture promises to them were binding in all situations\nand relations. I confess this, and that it was a sinful and shameful\nweakness in me, but my nature was subject to it, and I could not eschew\nit. I never doubted that I was one of the elect myself; for, besides\nthe strong inward and spiritual conviction that I possessed, I had my\nkind father's assurance; and these had been revealed to him in that way\nand measure that they could not be doubted.\n\nIn this desponding state, I sat myself down on a stone, and bethought\nme of the rashness of my undertaking. I tried to ascertain, to my own\nsatisfaction, whether or not I really had been commissioned of God to\nperpetrate these crimes in His behalf, for, in the eyes and by the laws\nof men, they were great and crying transgressions. While I sat\npondering on these things, I was involved in a veil of white misty\nvapour, and, looking up to heaven, I was just about to ask direction\nfrom above, when I heard as it were a still small voice close by me,\nwhich uttered some words of derision and chiding. I looked intensely in\nthe direction whence it seemed to come, and perceived a lady robed in\nwhite, who hastened towards me. She regarded me with a severity of look\nand gesture that appalled me so much I could not address her; but she\nwaited not for that, but coming close to my side said, without\nstopping: \"Preposterous wretch! How dare you lift your eyes to Heaven\nwith such purposes in your heart? Escape homewards, and save your Soul,\nor farewell for ever!\"\n\nThese were all the words that she uttered, as far as I could ever\nrecollect, but my spirits were kept in such a tumult that morning that\nsomething might have escaped me. I followed her eagerly with my eyes,\nbut in a moment she glided over the rocks above the holy well, and\nvanished. I persuaded myself that I had seen a vision, and that the\nradiant being that had addressed me was one of the good angels, or\nguardian spirits, commissioned by the Almighty to watch over the steps\nof the just. My first impulse was to follow her advice, and make my\nescape home; for I thought to myself. \"How is this interested and\nmysterious foreigner a proper judge of the actions of a free Christian?\"\n\nThe thought was hardly framed, nor had I moved in a retrograde\ndirection six steps, when I saw my illustrious friend and great adviser\ndescending the ridge towards me with hasty and impassioned strides. My\nheart fainted within me; and, when he came up and addressed me, I\nlooked as one caught in a trespass. \"What hath detained thee, thou\ndesponding trifler?\" said he. \"Verily now shall the golden opportunity\nbe lost which may never be recalled. I have traced the reprobate to his\nsanctuary in the cloud, and lo he is perched on the pinnacle of a\nprecipice an hundred fathoms high. One ketch with thy foot, or toss\nwith thy finger, shall throw him from thy sight into the foldings of\nthe cloud, and he shall be no more seen till found at the bottom of the\ncliff dashed to pieces. Make haste, therefore, thou loiterer, if thou\nwouldst ever prosper and rise to eminence in the work of thy Lord and\nMaster.\"\n\n\"I go no farther in this work,\" said I, \"for I have seen a vision that\nhas reprimanded the deed!'\n\n\"A vision?\" said he. \"Was it that wench who descended from the hill?\"\n\n\"The being that spake to me, and warned me of my danger, was indeed in\nthe form of a lady,\" said I.\n\n\"She also approached me and said a few words,\" returned he, \"and I\nthought there was something mysterious in her manner. Pray, what did\nshe say? for the words of such a singular message, and from such a\nmessenger, ought to be attended to. If I understood her aright, she was\nchiding us for our misbelief and preposterous delay.\"\n\nI recited her words, but he answered that I had been in a state of\nsinful doubting at the time, and it was to these doubtings she had\nadverted. In short, this wonderful and clear-sighted stranger soon\nbanished all my doubts and despondency, making me utterly ashamed of\nthem, and again I set out with him in the pursuit of my brother. He\nshowed me the traces of his footsteps in the dew, and pointed out the\nspot where I should find him. \"You have nothing more to do than go\nsoftly down behind him,\" said he, \"which you can do to within an ell of\nhim, without being seen; then rush upon him, and throw him from his\nseat, where there is neither footing nor hold. I will go, meanwhile,\nand amuse his sight by some exhibition in the contrary direction, and\nhe shall neither know nor perceive who had done him this kind office:\nfor, exclusive of more weighty concerns, be assured of this that, the\nsooner he falls, the fewer crimes will he have to answer for, and his\nestate in the other world will be proportionally more tolerable than if\nhe spent a long unregenerate life steeped in iniquity to the loathing\nof the soul.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be more plain or more pertinent,\" said I. \"Therefore, I\nfly to perform that which is both a duty towards God and towards man!\"\n\n\"You shall yet rise to great honour and preferment,\" said he.\n\n\"I value it not, provided I do honour and justice to the cause of my\nmaster here,\" said I.\n\n\"You shall be lord of your father's riches and demesnes,\" added he.\n\n\"I disclaim and deride every selfish motive thereto relating,\" said I,\n\"further than as it enables me to do good.\"\n\n\"Aye, but that is a great and a heavenly consideration, that longing\nfor ability to do good,\" said he--and, as he said so, I could not help\nremarking a certain derisive exultation of expression which I could not\ncomprehend; and indeed I have noted this very often in my illustrious\nfriend, and sometimes mentioned it civilly to him, but he has never\nfailed to disclaim it. On this occasion I said nothing, but, concealing\nhis poniard in my clothes, I hasted up the mountain, determined to\nexecute my purpose before any misgivings should again visit me; and I\nnever had more ado than in keeping firm my resolution. I could not help\nmy thoughts, and there are certain trains and classes of thoughts that\nhave great power in enervating the mind. I thought of the awful thing\nof plunging a fellow creature from the top of a cliff into the dark and\nmisty void below--of his being dashed to pieces on the protruding\nrocks, and of hearing his shrieks as he descended the cloud, and beheld\nthe shagged points on which he was to alight. Then I thought of\nplunging a soul so abruptly into Hell, or, at the best, sending it to\nhover on the confines of that burning abyss--of its appearance at the\nbar of the Almighty to receive its sentence. And then I thought: \"Will\nthere not be a sentence pronounced against me there, by a jury of the\njust made perfect, and written down in the registers of Heaven?\"\n\nThese thoughts, I say, came upon me unasked, and, instead of being able\nto dispel them, they mustered upon the summit of my imagination in\nthicker and stronger array: and there was another that impressed me in\na very particular manner, though I have reason to believe not so\nstrongly as those above written. It was this: \"What if I should fail in\nmy first effort? Will the consequence not be that I am tumbled from the\ntop of the rock myself?\" and then all the feelings anticipated, with\nregard to both body and soul, must happen to me! This was a\nspinebreaking reflection; and yet, though the probability was rather on\nthat side, my zeal in the cause of godliness was such that it carried\nme on, maugre all danger and dismay.\n\nI soon came close upon my brother, sitting on the dizzy pinnacle, with\nhis eyes fixed steadfastly in the direction opposite to me. I descended\nthe little green ravine behind him with my feet foremost, and every now\nand then raised my head, and watched his motions. His posture continued\nthe same, until at last I came so near him I could have heard him\nbreathe if his face had been towards me. I laid my cap aside, and made\nme ready to spring upon him and push him over. I could not for my life\naccomplish it! I do not think it was that I durst not, I have always\nfelt my courage equal to anything in a good cause. But I had not the\nheart, or something that I ought to have had. In short, it was not done\nin time, as it easily might have been. These THOUGHTS are hard enemies\nwherewith to combat! And I was so grieved that I could not effect my\nrighteous purpose that I laid me down on my face and shed tears. Then,\nagain, I thought of what my great enlightened friend and patron would\nsay to me, and again my resolution rose indignant and indissoluble save\nby blood. I arose on my right knee and left foot, and had just begun to\nadvance the latter forward: the next step my great purpose had been\naccomplished, and the culprit had suffered the punishment due to his\ncrimes. But what moved him I knew not: in the critical moment he sprung\nto his feet, and, dashing himself furiously against me, he overthrew\nme, at the imminent peril of my life. I disencumbered myself by main\nforce and fled, but he overhied me, knocked me down, and threatened,\nwith dreadful oaths, to throw me from the cliff. After I was a little\nrecovered from the stunning blow, I aroused myself to the combat; and,\nthough I do not recollect the circumstances of that deadly scuffle very\nminutely, I know that I vanquished him so far as to force him to ask my\npardon, and crave a reconciliation. I spurned at both and left him to\nthe chastisements of his own wicked and corrupt heart.\n\nMy friend met me again on the hill and derided me in a haughty and\nstern manner for my imbecility and want of decision. I told him how\nnearly I had effected my purpose, and excused myself as well as I was\nable. On this, seeing me bleeding, he advised me to swear the peace\nagainst my brother, and have him punished in the meantime, he being the\nfirst aggressor. I promised compliance and we parted, for I was\nsomewhat ashamed of my failure, and was glad to be quit for the present\nof one of whom I stood so much in awe.\n\nWhen my reverend father beheld me bleeding a second time by the hand of\na brother, he was moved to the highest point of displeasure; and,\nrelying on his high interest and the justice of his cause, he brought\nthe matter at once before the courts. My brother and I were first\nexamined face to face. His declaration was a mere romance: mine was not\nthe truth; but as it was by the advice of my reverend father, and that\nof my illustrious friend, both of whom I knew to be sincere Christians\nand true believers, that I gave it, I conceived myself completely\njustified on that score. I said I had gone up into the mountain early\non the morning to pray, and had withdrawn myself, for entire privacy,\ninto a little sequestered dell--had laid aside my cap, and was in the\nact of kneeling when I was rudely attacked by my brother, knocked over,\nand nearly slain. They asked my brother if this was true. He\nacknowledged that it was; that I was bare-headed and in the act of\nkneeling when he ran foul of me without any intent of doing so. But the\njudge took him to task on the improbability of this, and put the\nprofligate sore out of countenance. The rest of his tale told still\nworse, insomuch that he was laughed at by all present, for the judge\nremarked to him that, granting it was true that he had at first run\nagainst me on an open mountain and overthrown me by accident, how was\nit that, after I had extricated myself and fled, that he had pursued,\novertaken, and knocked me down a second time? Would he pretend that all\nthat was likewise by chance? The culprit had nothing to say for himself\non this head, and I shall not forget my exultation and that of my\nreverend father when the sentence of the judge was delivered. It was\nthat my wicked brother should be thrown into prison and tried on a\ncriminal charge of assault and battery, with the intent of committing\nmurder. This was a just and righteous judge, and saw things in their\nproper bearings, that is, he could discern between a righteous and a\nwicked man, and then there could be no doubt as to which of the two\nwere acting right and which wrong.\n\nHad I not been sensible that a justified person could do nothing wrong,\nI should not have been at my ease concerning the statement I had been\ninduced to give on this occasion. I could easily perceive that, by\nrooting out the weeds from the garden of the Church, I heightened the\ngrowth of righteousness; but, as to the tardy way of giving false\nevidence on matters of such doubtful issue, I confess I saw no great\npropriety in it from the beginning. But I now only moved by the will\nand mandate of my illustrious friend. I had no peace or comfort when\nout of his Sight, nor have I ever been able to boast of much in his\npresence; so true is it that a Christian's life is one of suffering.\n\nMy time was now much occupied, along with my reverend preceptor, in\nmaking ready for the approaching trial, as the prosecutors. Our counsel\nassured us of a complete victory, and that banishment would be the\nmildest award of the law on the offender. Mark how different was the\nresult! From the shifts and ambiguities of a wicked Bench, who had a\nfellow-feeling of iniquity with the defenders, my suit was lost, the\ngraceless libertine was absolved, and I was incarcerated, and bound\nover to keep the peace, with heavy penalties, before I was set at\nliberty.\n\nI was exceedingly disgusted at this issue, and blamed the counsel of my\nfriend to his face. He expressed great grief, and expatiated on the\nwickedness of our judicatories, adding: \"I see I cannot depend on you\nfor quick and summary measures, but for your sake I shall be revenged\non that wicked judge, and that you shall see in a few days.\" The Lord\nJustice Clerk died that same week! But he died in his own house and his\nown bed, and by what means my friend effected it I do not know. He\nwould not tell me a single word of the matter, but the judge's sudden\ndeath made a great noise, and I made so many curious inquiries\nregarding the particulars of it that some suspicions were like to\nattach to our family of some unfair means used. For my part I know\nnothing, and rather think he died by the visitation of Heaven, and that\nmy friend had foreseen it, by symptoms, and soothed me by promises of\ncomplete revenge.\n\nIt was some days before he mentioned my brother's meditated death to me\nagain, and certainly he then found me exasperated against him\npersonally to the highest degree. But I told him that I could not now\nthink any more of it owing to the late judgment of the court, by which,\nif my brother were missing or found dead, I would not only forfeit my\nlife but my friends would be ruined by the penalties.\n\n\"I suppose you know and believe in the perfect safety of your soul,\"\nsaid he, \"and that that is a matter settled from the beginning of time,\nand now sealed and ratified both in Heaven and earth?\"\n\n\"I believe in it thoroughly and perfectly,\" said I; \"and, whenever I\nentertain doubts of it, I am sensible of sin and weakness.\"\n\n\"Very well, so then am I,\" said he. \"I think I can now divine, with all\nmanner of certainty, what will be the high and merited guerdon of your\nimmortal part. Hear me then further: I give you my solemn assurance,\nand bond of blood, that no human hand shall ever henceforth be able to\ninjure your life, or shed one drop of your precious blood; but it is on\nthe condition that you walk always by my directions.\"\n\n\"I will do so with cheerfulness,\" said I, \"for, without your\nenlightened counsel, I feel that I can do nothing. But, as to your\npower of protecting my life, you must excuse me for doubting of it.\nNay, were we in your proper dominions, you could not ensure that.\"\n\n\"In whatever dominion or land I am, my power accompanies me,\" said he,\n\"and it is only against human might and human weapon that I ensure your\nlife; on that will I keep an eye, and on that you may depend. I have\nnever broken word or promise with you. Do you credit me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said I, \"for I see you are in earnest. I believe, though I\ndo not comprehend you.\"\n\n\"Then why do you not at once challenge your brother to the field of\nhonour? Seeing you now act without danger, cannot you also act without\nfear?\"\n\n\"It is not fear,\" returned I, \"believe me. I hardly know what fear is.\nIt is a doubt that, on all these emergencies, constantly haunts my mind\nthat, in performing such and such actions, I may fall from my upright\nstate. This makes fratricide a fearful task!\"\n\n\"This is imbecility itself,\" said he. \"We have settled and agreed on\nthat point an hundred times. I would therefore advise that you\nchallenge your brother to single combat. I shall ensure your safety,\nand he cannot refuse giving you satisfaction.\"\n\n\"But then the penalties?\" said I.\n\n\"We will try to evade these,\" said he, \"and, supposing you should be\ncaught, if once you are Laird of Dalcastle and Balgrennan, what are the\npenalties to you?\"\n\n\"Might we not rather pop him off in private and quietness, as we did\nthe deistical divine?\" said I.\n\n\"The deed would be alike meritorious, either way,\" said he. \"But may we\nnot wait for years before we find an opportunity? My advice is to\nchallenge him, as privately as you will, and there cut him off.\"\n\n\"So be it then,\" said I. \"When the moon is at the full, I will send for\nhim forth to speak with one, and there will I smite him and slay him,\nand he shall trouble the righteous no more.\"\n\n\"Then this is the very night,\" said he, \"The moon is nigh to the full,\nand this night your brother and his sinful mates hold carousal; for\nthere is an intended journey to-morrow. The exulting profligate leaves\ntown, where we must remain till the time of my departure hence; and\nthen is he safe, and must live to dishonour God, and not only destroy\nhis own soul but those of many others. Alack, and woe is me! The sins\nthat he and his friends will commit this very night will cry to Heaven\nagainst us for our shameful delay! When shall our great work of\ncleansing the sanctuary be finished, if we proceed at this puny rate?\"\n\n\"I see the deed must be done, then,\" said I, \"and, since it is so, it\nshall be done. I will arm myself forthwith, and from the midst of his\nwine and debauchery you shall call him forth to me, and there will I\nsmite him with the edge of the sword, that our great work be not\nretarded.\"\n\n\"If thy execution were equal to thy intent, how great a man you soon\nmight be!\" said he. \"We shall make the attempt once more; and, if it\nfail again, why, I must use other means to bring about my high purposes\nrelating to mankind. Home and make ready. I will go and procure what\ninformation I can regarding their motions, and will meet you in\ndisguise twenty minutes hence, at the first turn of Hewie's Lane beyond\nthe loch.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to make ready,\" said I, \"for I do not choose to go\nhome. Bring me a sword, and we may consecrate it with prayer and vows,\nand, if I use it not to the bringing down of the wicked and profane,\nthen may the Lord do so to me, and more also!\"\n\nWe parted, and there was I left again to the multiplicity of my own\nthoughts for the space of twenty minutes, a thing my friend never\nfailed in subjecting me to, and these were worse to contend with than\nhosts of sinful men. I prayed inwardly that these deeds of mine might\nnever be brought to the knowledge of men who were incapable of\nappreciating the high motives that led to them; and then I sung part of\nthe 10th Psalm, likewise in spirit; but, for all these efforts, my\nsinful doubts returned, so that when my illustrious friend joined me,\nand proffered me the choice of two gilded rapiers, I declined accepting\nany of them, and began, in a very bold and energetic manner, to express\nmy doubts regarding the justification of all the deeds of perfect men.\nHe chided me severely and branded me with cowardice, a thing that my\nnature never was subject to; and then he branded me with falsehood and\nbreach of the most solemn engagements both to God and man.\n\nI was compelled to take the rapier, much against my inclination; but,\nfor all the arguments, threats, and promises that he could use, I would\nnot consent to send a challenge to my brother by his mouth. There was\none argument only that he made use of which had some weight with me,\nbut yet it would not preponderate. He told me my brother was gone to a\nnotorious and scandalous habitation of women, and that, if I left him\nto himself for ever so short a space longer, it might embitter his\nstate through ages to come. This was a trying concern to me; but I\nresisted it, and reverted to my doubts. On this he said that he had\nmeant to do me honour, but, since I put it out of his power, he would\ndo the deed, and take the responsibility on himself. \"I have with sore\ntravail procured a guardship of your life,\" added he. \"For my own, I\nhave not; but, be that as it will, I shall not be baffled in my\nattempts to benefit my friends without a trial. You will at all events\naccompany me, and see that I get justice?\"\n\n\"Certes, I will do thus much,\" said I, \"and woe be to him if his arm\nprevail against my friend and patron!\"\n\nHis lip curled with a smile of contempt, which I could hardly brook;\nand I began to be afraid that the eminence to which I had been destined\nby him was already fading from my view. And I thought what I should\nthen do to ingratiate myself again with him, for without his\ncountenance I had no life. \"I will be a man in act,\" thought I, \"but in\nsentiment I will not yield, and for this he must surely admire me the\nmore.\"\n\nAs we emerged from the shadowy lane into the fair moonshine, I started\nso that my whole frame underwent the most chilling vibrations of\nsurprise. I again thought I had been taken at unawares and was\nconversing with another person. My friend was equipped in the Highland\ngarb, and so completely translated into another being that, save by his\nspeech, all the senses of mankind could not have recognized him. I\nblessed myself, and asked whom it was his pleasure to personify\nto-night? He answered me carelessly that it was a spark whom he meant\nshould bear the blame of whatever might fall out to-night; and that was\nall that passed on the subject.\n\nWe proceeded by some stone steps at the foot of the North Loch, in hot\nargument all the way. I was afraid that our conversation might be\noverheard, for the night was calm and almost as light as day, and we\nsaw sundry people crossing us as we advanced. But the zeal of my friend\nwas so high that he disregarded all danger, and continued to argue\nfiercely and loudly on my delinquency, as he was pleased to call it. I\nstood on one argument alone, which was that \"I did not think the\nScripture promises to the elect, taken in their utmost latitude,\nwarranted the assurance that they could do no wrong; and that,\ntherefore, it behoved every man to look well to his steps.\"\n\nThere was no religious scruple that irritated my enlightened friend and\nmaster so much as this. He could not endure it. And, the sentiments of\nour great covenanted reformers being on his side, there is not a doubt\nthat I was wrong. He lost all patience on hearing what I advanced on\nthis matter, and, taking hold of me, he led me into a darksome booth in\na confined entry; and, after a friendly but cutting reproach, he bade\nme remain there in secret and watch the event. \"And, if I fall,\" said\nhe, \"you will not fail to avenge my death?\"\n\nI was so entirely overcome with vexation that I could make no answer,\non which he left me abruptly, a prey to despair; and I saw or heard no\nmore till he came down to the moonlight green followed by my brother.\nThey had quarrelled before they came within my hearing, for the first\nwords I heard were those of my brother, who was in a state of\nintoxication, and he was urging a reconciliation, as was his wont on\nsuch occasions. My friend spurned at the suggestion, and dared him to\nthe combat; and after a good deal of boastful altercation, which the\nturmoil of my spirits prevented me from remembering, my brother was\ncompelled to draw his sword and stand on the defensive. It was a\ndesperate and terrible engagement. I at first thought that the royal\nstranger and great champion of the faith would overcome his opponent\nwith ease, for I considered Heaven as on his side, and nothing but the\narm of sinful flesh against him. But I was deceived. The sinner stood\nfirm as a rock, while the assailant flitted about like a shadow, or\nrather like a spirit. I smiled inwardly, conceiving that these\nlightsome manoeuvres were all a sham to show off his art and mastership\nin the exercise, and that, whenever they came to close fairly, that\ninstant my brother would be overcome. Still I was deceived. My\nbrother's arm seemed invincible, so that the closer they fought the\nmore palpably did it prevail. They fought round the green to the very\nedge of the water, and so round till they came close up to the covert\nwhere I stood. There being no more room to shift ground, my brother\nthen forced him to come to close quarters, on which, the former still\nhaving the decided advantage, my friend quitted his sword and called\nout. I could resist no longer; so, springing from my concealment, I\nrushed between them with my sword drawn, and parted them as if they had\nbeen two schoolboys: then, turning to my brother, I addressed him as\nfollows: \"Wretch! miscreant! knowest thou what thou art attempting?\nWouldest thou lay thine hand on the Lord's anointed, or shed his\nprecious blood? Turn thee to me, that I may chastise thee for all thy\nwickedness, and not for the many injuries thou hast done to me!\" To it\nwe went, with full thirst of vengeance on every side. The duel was\nfierce; but the might of Heaven prevailed, and not my might. The\nungodly and reprobate young man fell covered with wounds, and with\ncurses and blasphemy in his mouth, while I escaped uninjured. Thereto\nhis power extended not.\n\nI will not deny that my own immediate impressions of this affair in\nsome degree differed from this statement. But this is precisely as my\nillustrious friend described it to be afterwards, and I can rely\nimplicitly on his information, as he was at that time a looker-on, and\nmy senses all in a state of agitation, and he could have no motive for\nsaying what was not the positive truth.\n\nNever till my brother was down did we perceive that there had been\nwitnesses to the whole business. Our ears were then astounded by rude\nchallenges of unfair play, which were quite appalling to me; but my\nfriend laughed at them and conducted me off in perfect safety. As to\nthe unfairness of the transaction, I can say thus much, that my royal\nfriend's sword was down ere ever mine was presented. But if it still be\naccounted unfair to take up a conqueror, and punish him in his own way,\nI answer: That if a man is sent on a positive mission by his master,\nand hath laid himself under vows to do his work, he ought not to be too\nnice in the means of accomplishing it; and, further, I appeal to holy\nwrit, wherein many instances are recorded of the pleasure the Lord\ntakes in the final extinction of the wicked and profane; and this\nposition I take to be unanswerable.\n\nI was greatly disturbed in my mind for many days, knowing that the\ntransaction had been witnessed, and sensible also of the perilous\nsituation I occupied, owing to the late judgment of the court against\nme. But on the contrary, I never saw my enlightened friend in such high\nspirits. He assured me there was no danger; and again repeated that he\nwarranted my life against the power of man. I thought proper, however,\nto remain in hiding for a week; but, as he said, to my utter amazement,\nthe blame fell on another, who was not only accused but pronounced\nguilty by the general voice, and outlawed for non-appearance! How could\nI doubt, after this, that the hand of Heaven was aiding and abetting\nme? The matter was beyond my comprehension; and, as for my friend, he\nnever explained anything that was past, but his activity and art were\nwithout a parallel.\n\nHe enjoyed our success mightily; and for his sake I enjoyed it\nsomewhat, but it was on account of his comfort only, for I could not\nfor my life perceive in what degree the Church was better or purer than\nbefore these deeds were done. He continued to flatter me with great\nthings, as to honours, fame and emolument; and, above all, with the\nblessing and protection of Him to whom my body and soul were dedicated.\nBut, after these high promises, I got no longer peace; for he began to\nurge the death of my father with such an unremitting earnestness that I\nfound I had nothing for it but to comply. I did so; and cannot express\nhis enthusiasm of approbation. So much did he hurry and press me in\nthis that I was forced to devise some of the most openly violent\nmeasures, having no alternative. Heaven spared me the deed, taking, in\nthat instance, the vengeance in its own hand; for, before my arm could\neffect the sanguine but meritorious act, the old man followed his son\nto the grave. My illustrious and zealous friend seemed to regret this\nsomewhat, but he comforted himself with the reflection, that still I\nhad the merit of it, having not only consented to it, but in fact\neffected it, for by doing the one action I had brought about both.\n\nNo sooner were the obsequies of the funeral over than my friend and I\nwent to Dalcastle, and took undisputed possession of the houses, lands\nand effects that had been my father's; but his plate, and vast\ntreasures of ready money, he had bestowed on a voluptuous and unworthy\ncreature, who had lived long with him as a mistress. Fain would I have\nsent her after her lover, and gave my friend some hints on the\noccasion; but he only shook his head, and said that we must lay all\nselfish and interested motives out of the question.\n\nFor a long time, when I awaked in the morning, I could not believe my\nsenses, that I was indeed the undisputed and sole proprietor of so much\nwealth and grandeur; and I felt so much gratified that I immediately\nset about doing all the good I was able, hoping to meet with all\napprobation and encouragement from my friend. I was mistaken. He\nchecked the very first impulses towards such a procedure, questioned my\nmotives, and uniformly made them out to be wrong. There was one morning\nthat a servant said to me there was a lady in the back chamber who\nwanted to speak with me, but he could not tell me who it was, for all\nthe old servants had left the mansion, every one on hearing of the\ndeath of the late laird, and those who had come knew none of the people\nin the neighbourhood. From several circumstances, I had suspicions of\nprivate confabulations with women, and refused to go to her, but bid\nthe servant inquire what she wanted. She would not tell, she could only\nstate the circumstances to me; so I, being sensible that a little\ndignity of manner became me in my elevated situation, returned for\nanswer that, if it was business that could not be transacted by my\nsteward, it must remain untransacted. The answer which the servant\nbrought back was of a threatening nature. She stated she must see me,\nand, if I refused her satisfaction there, she would compel it where I\nshould not evite her.\n\nMy friend and director appeared pleased with my dilemma, and rather\nadvised that I should hear what the woman had to say; on which I\nconsented, provided she would deliver her mission in his presence. She\ncame with manifest signs of anger and indignation, and began with a\nbold and direct charge against me of a shameful assault on one of her\ndaughters; of having used the basest of means in order to lead her\naside from the paths of rectitude; and, on the failure of these, of\nhaving resorted to the most unqualified measures.\n\nI denied the charge in all its bearings, assuring the dame that I had\nnever so much as seen either of her daughters to my knowledge, far less\nwronged them; on which she got into great wrath, and abused me to my\nface as an accomplished vagabond, hypocrite, and sensualist; and she\nwent so far as to tell me roundly that if I did not marry her daughter,\nshe would bring me to the gallows and that in a very short time.\n\n\"Marry your daughter, honest woman!\" said I, \"on the faith of a\nChristian, I never saw your daughter; and you may rest assured in this,\nthat I will neither marry you nor her. Do you consider how short a time\nI have been in this place? How much that time has been occupied? And\nhow there was even a possibility that I could have accomplished such\nvillainies?\"\n\n\"And how long does your Christian reverence suppose you have remained\nin this place since the late laird's death?\" said she.\n\n\"That is too well known to need recapitulation,\" said I. \"Only a very\nfew days, though I cannot at present specify the exact number; perhaps\nfrom thirty to forty, or so. But in all that time, certes, I have never\nseen either you or any of your two daughters that you talk of. You must\nbe quite sensible of that.\"\n\nMy friend shook his head three times during this short sentence, while\nthe woman held up her hands in amazement and disgust, exclaiming:\n\"There goes the self-righteous one! There goes the consecrated youth,\nwho cannot err! You, sir, know, and the world shall know, of the faith\nthat is in this most just, devout, and religious miscreant! Can you\ndeny that you have already been in this place four months and seven\ndays? Or that in that time you have been forbid my house twenty times?\nOr that you have persevered in your endeavours to effect the basest and\nmost ungenerous of purposes? Or that you have  attained them? Hypocrite\nand deceiver as you are! Yes, sir; I say, dare you deny that you have\nattained your vile, selfish, and degrading purposes towards a young,\ninnocent, and unsuspecting creature, and thereby ruined a poor widow's\nonly hope in this world? No, you cannot look in my face, and deny aught\nof this.\"\n\n\"The woman is raving mad!\" said I. \"You, illustrious sir, know that, in\nthe first instance, I have not yet been in this place one month.\" My\nfriend shook his head again, and answered me: \"You are wrong, my dear\nfriend; you are wrong. It is indeed the space of time that the lady\nhath stated, to a day, since you came here, and I came with you; and I\nam sorry that I know for certain that you have been frequently haunting\nher house, and have often had private correspondence with one of the\nyoung ladies, too. Of the nature of it I presume not to know.\"\n\n\"You are mocking me,\" said I. \"But as well may you try to reason me out\nof my existence as to convince me that I have been here even one month,\nor that any of those things you allege against me has the shadow of\ntruth or evidence to support it. I will swear to you, by the great God\nthat made me; and by--\"\n\n\"Hold, thou most abandoned profligate!\" cried she violently, \"and do\nnot add perjury to your other detestable crimes. Do not, for mercy's\nsake, any more profane that name whose attributes you have wrested and\ndisgraced. But tell me what reparation you propose offering to my\ninjured child.\"\n\n\"I again declare, before Heaven, woman, that, to the best of my\nknowledge and recollection, I never saw your daughter. I now think I\nhave some faint recollection of having seen your face, but where, or in\nwhat place, puzzles me quite.\"\n\n\"And, why?\" said she. \"Because for months and days you have been, in\nsuch a state of extreme inebriety, that your time has gone over like a\ndream that has been forgotten. I believe that, from the day you came\nfirst to my house, you have been in a state of utter delirium, and that\nprincipally from the fumes of wine and ardent spirits.\"\n\n\"It is a manifest falsehood!\" said I. \"I have never, since I entered on\nthe possession of Dalcastle, tasted wine or spirits, saving once a few\nevenings ago; and, I confess to my shame, that I was led too far; but I\nhave craved forgiveness and obtained it. I take my noble and\ndistinguished friend there for a witness to the truth of what I assert;\na man who has done more, and sacrificed more for the sake of genuine\nChristianity than any this world contains. Him you will believe.\"\n\n\"I hope you have attained forgiveness,\" said he, seriously. \"Indeed it\nwould be next to blasphemy to doubt it. But, of late, you have been\nvery much addicted to intemperance. I doubt if, from the first night\nyou tasted the delights of drunkenness, that you have ever again been\nin your right mind until Monday last. Doubtless you have been for a\ngood while most diligent in your addresses to this lady's daughter.\"\n\n\"This is unaccountable,\" said I. \"It is impossible that I can have been\ndoing a thing and not doing it at the same time. But indeed, honest\nwoman, there have several incidents occurred to me in the course of my\nlife which persuade me I have a second self; or that there is some\nother being who appears in my likeness.\"\n\nHere my friend interrupted me with a sneer, and a hint that I was\ntalking insanely; and then he added, turning to the lady: \"I know my\nfriend Mr. Colwan will do what is just and, right. Go and bring the\nyoung lady to him, that he may see her, and he will then recollect all\nhis former amours with her!'\n\n\"I humbly beg your pardon, sir,\" said I. \"But the mention of such a\nthing as amours with any woman existing, to me, is really so absurd, so\nfar from my principles, so from the purity of nature and frame to which\nI was born and consecrated, that I hold it as an insult, and regard it\nwith contempt.\"\n\nI would have said more in reprobation of such an idea, had not my\nservant entered, and said that a gentleman wanted to see me on\nbusiness. Being glad of an opportunity of getting quit of my lady\nvisitor, I ordered the servant to show him in; and forthwith a little\nlean gentleman, with a long aquiline nose, and a bald head, daubed all\nover with powder and pomatum, entered. I thought I recollected having\nseen him too, but could not remember his name, though he spoke to me\nwith the greatest familiarity; at least, that sort of familiarity that\nan official person generally assumes. He bustled about and about,\nspeaking to everyone, but declined listening for a single moment to\nany. The lady offered to withdraw, but he stopped her.\n\n\"No, no, Mrs. Keeler, you need not go; you need not go; you must not\ngo, madam. The business I came about concerns you--yes, that it does.\nBad business yon of Walker's? Eh? Could not help it--did all I could,\nMr. Wringhim. Done your business. Have it all cut and dry here, sir.\nNo, this is not it--Have it among them, though.--I'm at a little loss\nfor your name, sir (addressing my friend)--seen you very often,\nthough--exceedingly often--quite well acquainted with you.\"\n\n\"No, sir, you are not,\" said my friend, sternly. The intruder never\nregarded him; never so much as lifted his eyes from his bundle of law\npapers, among which he was bustling with great hurry and importance,\nbut went on:\n\n\"Impossible! Have seen a face very like it, then--what did you say your\nname was, sir?--very like it indeed. Is it not the young laird who was\nmurdered whom you resemble so much?\"\n\nHere Mrs. Keeler uttered a scream, which so much startled me that it\nseems I grew pale, and, on looking at my friend's face, there was\nsomething struck me so forcibly in the likeness between him and my late\nbrother that I had very nearly fainted. The woman exclaimed that it was\nmy brother's spirit that stood beside me.\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the attorney. \"At least, I hope not, else his\nsignature is not worth a pin. There is some balance due on yon\nbusiness, madam. Do you wish your account? because I have it here,\nready discharged, and it does not suit letting such things lie over.\nThis business of Mr. Colwan's will be a severe one on you,\nmadam--rather a severe one.\"\n\n\"What business of mine, if it be your will, sir,\" said I. \"For my part\nI never engaged you in business of any sort less or more.\" He never\nregarded me, but went on: \"You may appeal, though. Yes, yes, there are\nsuch things as appeals for the refractory. Here it is, gentlemen. Here\nthey are all together. Here is, in the first place, sir, your power of\nattorney, regularly warranted, sealed, and signed with your own hand.\"\n\n\"I declare solemnly that I never signed that document,\" said I.\n\n\"Aye, aye, the system of denial is not a bad one in general,\" said my\nattorney. \"But at present there is no occasion for it. You do not deny\nyour own hand?\"\n\n\"I deny everything connected with the business,\" cried I. \"I disclaim\nit in toto, and declare that I know no more about it than the child\nunborn.\"\n\n\"That is exceedingly good!\" exclaimed he. \"I like your pertinacity\nvastly! I have three of your letters, and three of your signatures;\nthat part is all settled, and I hope so is the whole affair; for here\nis the original grant to your father, which he has never thought proper\nto put in requisition. Simple gentleman! But here have I, Lawyer\nLinkum, in one hundredth part of the time that any other notary,\nwriter, attorney, or writer of the signet in Britain would have done\nit, procured the signature of His Majesty's commissioner, and thereby\nconfirmed the charter to you and your house, sir, for ever and\never--Begging your pardon, madam.\" The lady, as well as myself, tried\nseveral times to interrupt the loquacity of Linkum, but in vain: he\nonly raised his hand with a quick flourish, and went on:\n\n\"Here it is:\n\nJAMES, by the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,\nto his right trusty cousin, sendeth greeting: And whereas his right\nleal and trust-worthy cousin, George Colwan, of Dalcastle and\nBalgrennan, hath suffered great losses, and undergone much hardship, on\nbehalf of his Majesty's rights and titles; he therefore, for himself,\nand as prince and steward of Scotland, and by the consent of his right\ntrusty cousins and councillors hereby grants to the said George Colwan,\nhis heirs and assignees whatsomever, heritably and irrevocably, all and\nhaill the lands and others underwritten: To wit, All and haill, the\nfive merk land of Kipplerig; the five pound land of Easter Knockward,\nwith all the towers, fortalices, manor-places, houses, biggings, yards,\norchards, tofts, crofts, mills, woods, fishings, mosses, muirs,\nmeadows, commonties, pasturages, coals, coal-heughs, tennants,\ntenantries, services of free tenants, annexes, connexes, dependencies,\nparts, pendicles, and pertinents of the same whatsomever; to be\npeaceably brooked, joysed, set, used, and disposed of by him and his\naboves, as specified, heritably and irrevocably, in all time coming:\nAnd, in testimony thereof, his Majesty, for himself, and as prince\nsteward of Scotland, with the advice and consent of his foresaids,\nknowledge, proper motive, and kingly power, makes, erects, creates,\nunites, annexes, and incorporates, the whole lands above mentioned in a\nhaill and free barony, by all the rights, miethes, and marches thereof,\nold and divided, as the same lies, in length and breadth, in houses,\nbiggings, mills, multures, hawking, bunting, fishing; with court,\nplaint, herezeld, fock, fork, sack, sock, thole, thame, vert, wraik,\nwaith, wair, venison, outfang thief, infang thief, pit and gallows, and\nall and sundry other commodities. Given at our Court of Whitehall, &c.,\n&c. God save the King.\n\nCompositio 5 lib. 13.8.\n\nRegistrate 26th September 1687.\n\n\"See, madam, here are ten signatures of privy councillors of that year,\nand here are other ten of the present year, with His Grace the Duke of\nQueensberry at the head. All right. See here it is, sir--all\nright--done your work. So you see, madam, this gentleman is the true\nand sole heritor of all the land that your father possesses, with all\nthe rents thereof for the last twenty years, and upwards. Fine job for\nmy employers! Sorry on your account, madam--can't help it.\"\n\nI was again going to disclaim all interest or connection in the matter\nbut my friend stopped me; and the plaints and lamentations of the dame\nbecame so overpowering that they put an end to all further colloquy;\nbut Lawyer Linkum followed me, and stated his great outlay, and the\nimportant services he had rendered me, until I was obliged to subscribe\nan order to him for L100 on my banker.\n\nI was now glad to retire with my friend, and ask seriously for some\nexplanation of all this. It was in the highest degree unsatisfactory.\nHe confirmed all that had been stated to me; assuring me that I had not\nonly been assiduous in my endeavours to seduce a young lady of great\nbeauty, which it seemed I had effected, but that I had taken counsel,\nand got this supposed, old, false, and forged grant raked up and now\nsigned, to ruin the young lady's family quite, so as to throw her\nentirely on myself for protection, and be wholly at my will.\n\nThis was to me wholly incomprehensible. I could have freely made oath\nto the contrary of every particular. Yet the evidences were against me,\nand of a nature not to be denied. Here I must confess that, highly as I\ndisapproved of the love of women, and all intimacies and connections\nwith the sex, I felt a sort of indefinite pleasure, an ungracious\ndelight in having a beautiful woman solely at my disposal. But I\nthought of her spiritual good in the meantime. My friend spoke of my\nbackslidings with concern; requesting me to make sure of my\nforgiveness, and to forsake them; and then he added some words of sweet\ncomfort. But from this time forth I began to be sick at times of my\nexistence. I had heart-burnings, longings, and, yearnings that would\nnot be satisfied; and I seemed hardly to be an accountable creature;\nbeing thus in the habit of executing transactions of the utmost moment\nwithout being sensible that I did them. I was a being incomprehensible\nto myself. Either I had a second self, who transacted business in my\nlikeness, or else my body was at times possessed by a spirit over which\nit had no control, and of whose actions my own soul was wholly\nunconscious. This was an anomaly not to be accounted for by any\nphilosophy of mine, and I was many times, in contemplating it, excited\nto terrors and mental torments hardly describable. To be in a state of\nconsciousness and unconsciousness, at the same time, in the same body\nand same spirit, was impossible. I was under the greatest anxiety,\ndreading some change would take place momently in my nature; for of\ndates I could make nothing: one-half, or two-thirds of my time, seemed\nto me totally lost. I often, about this time, prayed with great\nfervour, and lamented my hopeless condition, especially in being liable\nto the commission of crimes which I was not sensible of and could not\neschew. And I confess, notwithstanding the promises on which I had been\ntaught to rely, I began to have secret terrors that the great enemy of\nman's salvation was exercising powers over me that might eventually\nlead to my ruin. These were but temporary and sinful fears, but they\nadded greatly to my unhappiness.\n\nThe worst thing of all was what hitherto I had never felt, and, as yet,\ndurst not confess to myself, that the presence of my illustrious and\ndevoted friend was becoming irksome to me. When I was by myself, I\nbreathed freer, and my step was lighter; but, when he approached, a\npang went to my heart, and, in his company, I moved and acted as if\nunder a load that I could hardly endure. What a state to be in! And yet\nto shake him off was impossible--we were incorporated\ntogether--identified with one another, as it were, and the power was\nnot in me to separate myself from him. I still knew nothing who he was,\nfurther than that he was a potentate of some foreign land, bent on\nestablishing some pure and genuine doctrines of Christianity, hitherto\nonly half understood, and less than half exercised. Of this I could\nhave no doubts after all that he had said, done and suffered in the\ncause. But, alongst with this, I was also certain that he was possessed\nof some supernatural power, of the source of which I was wholly\nignorant. That a man could be a Christian and at the same time a\npowerful necromancer, appeared inconsistent, and adverse to every\nprinciple taught in our Church and from this I was led to believe that\nhe inherited his powers from on high, for I could not doubt either of\nthe soundness of his principles or that he accomplished things\nimpossible to account for. Thus was I sojourning in the midst of a\nchaos of confusion. I looked back on my by-past life with pain, as one\nlooks back on a perilous journey, in which he has attained his end,\nwithout gaining any advantage either to himself or others; and I looked\nforward, as on a darksome waste, full of repulsive and terrific shapes,\npitfalls, and precipices, to which there was no definite bourn, and\nfrom which I turned with disgust. With my riches, my unhappiness was\nincreased tenfold; and here, with another great acquisition of\nproperty, for which I had pleaed, and which I had gained in a dream, my\nmiseries and difficulties were increasing. My principal feeling, about\nthis time, was an insatiable longing for something that I cannot\ndescribe or denominate properly, unless I say it was for utter oblivion\nthat I longed. I desired to sleep; but it was for a deeper and longer\nsleep than that in which the senses were nightly steeped. I longed to\nbe at rest and quiet, and close my eyes on the past and the future\nalike, as far as this frail life was concerned. But what had been\nformerly and finally settled in the councils above, I presumed not to\ncall in question.\n\nIn this state of irritation and misery was I dragging on an existence,\ndisgusted with all around me, and in particular with my mother, who,\nwith all her love and anxiety, had such an insufferable mode of\nmanifesting them that she had by this time rendered herself exceedingly\nobnoxious to me. The very sound of her voice at a distance went to my\nheart like an arrow, and made all my nerves to shrink; and, as for the\nbeautiful young lady for whom they told me I had been so much\nenamoured, I shunned all intercourse with her or hers, as I would have\ndone with the Devil. I read some of their letters and burnt them, but\nrefused to see either the young lady or her mother on any account.\n\nAbout this time it was that my worthy and reverend parent came with one\nof his elders to see my mother and myself. His presence always brought\njoy with it into our family, for my mother was uplifted, and I had so\nfew who cared for me, or for whom I cared, that I felt rather gratified\nat seeing him. My illustrious friend was also much more attached to him\nthan any other person (except myself) for their religious principles\ntallied in every point, and their conversation was interesting,\nserious, and sublime. Being anxious to entertain well and highly the\nman to whom I had been so much indebted, and knowing that, with all his\nintegrity and righteousness, he disdained not the good things of this\nlife, I brought from the late laird's well-stored cellars various\nfragrant and salubrious wines, and we drank, and became merry, and I\nfound that my miseries and overpowering calamities passed away over my\nhead like a shower that is driven by the wind. I became elevated and\nhappy, and welcomed my guests an hundred times; and then I joined them\nin religious conversation, with a zeal and enthusiasm which I had not\noften experienced, and which made all their hearts rejoice, so that I\nsaid to myself. \"Surely every gift of God is a blessing, and ought to\nbe used with liberality and thankfulness.\"\n\nThe next day I waked from a profound and feverish sleep, and called for\nsomething to drink. There was a servant answered whom I had never seen\nbefore, and he was clad in my servant's clothes and livery. I asked for\nAndrew Handyside, the servant who had waited at table the night before;\nbut the man answered with a stare and a smile:\n\n\"What do you mean, sirrah,\" said I. \"Pray what do you here? Or what are\nyou pleased to laugh at? I desire you to go about your business, and\nsend me up Handyside. I want him to bring me something to drink.\"\n\n\"Ye sanna want a drink, maister,\" said the fellow. \"Tak a hearty ane,\nand see if it will wauken ye up something, sae that ye dinna ca' for\nghaists through your sleep. Surely ye haena forgotten that Andrew\nHandyside has been in his grave these six months?\"\n\nThis was a stunning blow to me. I could not answer further, but sunk\nback on my pillow as if I had been a lump of lead, refusing to take a\ndrink or anything else at the fellow's hand, who seemed thus mocking me\nwith so grave a face. The man seemed sorry, and grieved at my being\noffended, but I ordered him away, and continued sullen and thoughtful.\nCould I have again been for a season in utter oblivion to myself, and\ntransacting business which I neither approved of nor had any connection\nwith! I tried to recollect something in which I might have been\nengaged, but nothing was portrayed on my mind subsequent to the parting\nwith my friends at a late hour the evening before. The evening before\nit certainly was: but, if so, how came it that Andrew Handyside, who\nserved at table that evening, should have been in his grave six months!\nThis was a circumstance somewhat equivocal; therefore, being afraid to\narise lest accusations of I know not what might come against me, I was\nobliged to call once more in order to come at what intelligence I\ncould. The same fellow appeared to receive my orders as before, and I\nset about examining him with regard to particulars. He told me his name\nwas Scrape; that I hired him myself; of whom I hired him; and at whose\nrecommendation. I smiled, and nodded so as to let the knave see I\nunderstood he was telling me a chain of falsehoods, but did not choose\nto begin with any violent asseverations to the contrary.\n\n\"And where is my noble friend and companion?\" said I. \"How has he been\nengaged in the interim?\"\n\n\"I dinna ken him, sir,\" said Scrape, \"but have heard it said that the\nstrange mysterious person that attended you, him that the maist part of\nfolks countit uncanny, had gane awa wi' a Mr. Ringan o' Glasko last\nyear, and had never returned.\"\n\nI thanked the Lord in my heart for this intelligence, hoping that the\nillustrious stranger had returned to his own land and people, and that\nI should thenceforth be rid of his controlling and appalling presence.\n\"And where is my mother?\" said, I. The man's breath cut short, and he\nlooked at me without returning any answer.--\"I ask you where my mother\nis?\" said I.\n\n\"God only knows, and not I, where she is,\" returned he. \"He knows where\nher soul is, and, as for her body, if you dinna ken something o' it, I\nsuppose nae man alive does.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you knave?\" said I. \"What dark hints are these you\nare throwing out? Tell me precisely and distinctly what you know of my\nmother?\"\n\n\"It is unco queer o' ye to forget, or pretend to forget everything that\ngate the day, sir,\" said he. \"I'm sure you heard enough about it\nyestreen; an' I can tell you there are some gayan ill-faurd stories\ngaun about that business. But, as the thing is to be tried afore the\ncircuit lords, it wad be far wrang to say either this or that to\ninfluence the public mind; it is best just to let justice tak its swee.\nI hae naething to say, sir. Ye hae been a good enough maister to me,\nand paid my wages regularly, but ye hae muckle need to be innocent, for\nthere are some heavy accusations rising against you.\"\n\n\"I fear no accusations of man,\" said I, \"as long as I can justify my\ncause in the sight of Heaven; and that I can do this I am well aware.\nGo you and bring me some wine and water, and some other clothes than\nthese gaudy and glaring ones.\"\n\nI took a cup of wine and water; put on my black clothes and walked out.\nFor all the perplexity that surrounded me, I felt my spirits\nconsiderably buoyant. It appeared that I was rid of the two greatest\nbars to my happiness, by what agency I knew not. My mother, it seemed,\nwas gone, who had become a grievous thorn in my side of late; and my\ngreat companion and counsellor, who tyrannized over every spontaneous\nmovement of my heart, had likewise taken himself off. This last was an\nunspeakable relief; for I found that for a long season I had only been\nable to act by the motions of his mysterious mind and spirit. I\ntherefore thanked God for my deliverance, and strode through my woods\nwith a daring and heroic step; with independence in my eye, and freedom\nswinging in my right hand.\n\nAt the extremity of the Colwan wood, I perceived a figure approaching\nme with slow and dignified motion. The moment that I beheld it, my\nwhole frame received a shock as if the ground on which I walked had\nsunk suddenly below me. Yet, at that moment, I knew not who it was; it\nwas the air and motion of someone that I dreaded, and from whom I would\ngladly have escaped; but this I even had not power to attempt. It came\nslowly onward, and I advanced as slowly to meet it; yet, when we came\nwithin speech, I still knew not who it was. It bore the figure, air,\nand features of my late brother, I thought, exactly; yet in all these\nthere were traits so forbidding, so mixed with an appearance of misery,\nchagrin and despair, that I still shrunk from the view, not knowing in\nwhose face I looked. But, when the being spoke, both my mental and\nbodily frame received another shock more terrible than the first, for\nit was the voice of the great personage I had so long denominated my\nfriend, of whom I had deemed myself for ever freed, and whose presence\nand counsels I now dreaded more than Hell. It was his voice, but so\naltered--I shall never forget it till my dying day. Nay, I can scarce\nconceive it possible that any earthly sounds could be so discordant, so\nrepulsive to every feeling of a human soul, as the tones of the voice\nthat grated on my ear at that moment. They were the sounds of the pit,\nwheezed through a grated cranny, or seemed so to my distempered\nimagination.\n\n\"So! Thou shudderest at my approach now, dost thou?\" said he. \"Is this\nall the gratitude that you deign for an attachment of which the annals\nof the world furnish no parallel? An attachment which has caused me to\nforego power and dominion, might, homage, conquest and adulation: all\nthat I might gain one highly valued and sanctified spirit to my great\nand true, principles of reformation among mankind. Wherein have I\noffended? What have I done for evil, or what have I not done for your\ngood; that you would thus shun my presence?\"\n\n\"Great and magnificent prince,\" said I humbly; \"let me request of you\nto abandon a poor worthless wight to his own wayward fortune, and\nreturn to the dominion of your people. I am unworthy of the sacrifices\nyou have made for my sake; and, after all your efforts, I do not feel\nthat you have rendered either more virtuous or more happy. For the sake\nof that which is estimable in human nature, depart from me to your own\nhome, before you render me a being either altogether above or below the\nrest of my fellow creatures. Let me plod on towards Heaven and\nhappiness in my own way, like those that have gone before me, and I\npromise to stick fast by the great principles which you have so\nstrenuously inculcated, on condition that you depart and leave me for\never.\"\n\n\"Sooner shall you make the mother abandon the child of her bosom; nay,\nsooner cause the shadow to relinquish the substance, than separate me\nfrom your side. Our beings are amalgamated, as it were, and consociated\nin one, and never shall I depart from this country until I can carry\nyou in triumph with me.\"\n\nI can in nowise describe the effect this appalling speech had on me. It\nwas like the announcement of death to one who had of late deemed\nhimself free, if not of something worse than death, and of longer\ncontinuance. There was I doomed to remain in misery, subjugated, soul\nand body, to one whose presence was become more intolerable to me than\naught on earth could compensate. And at that moment, when he beheld the\nanguish of my soul, he could not conceal that he enjoyed it. I was\ntroubled for an answer, for which he was waiting: it became incumbent\non me to say something after such a protestation of attachment; and, in\nsome degree to shake the validity of it, I asked, with great\nsimplicity, where he had been all this while?\n\n\"Your crimes and your extravagances forced me from your side for a\nseason,\" said he, \"but now that I hope the day of grace is returned, I\nam again drawn towards you by an affection that has neither bounds nor\ninterest; an affection for which I receive not even the poor return of\ngratitude, and which seems to have its radical sources in fascination.\nI have been far, far abroad, and have seen much, and transacted much,\nsince I last spoke with you. During that space, I grievously suspect\nthat you have been guilty of great crimes and misdemeanours, crimes\nthat would have sunk an unregenerated person to perdition; but as I\nknew it to be only a temporary falling off, a specimen of that liberty\nby which the chosen and elected ones are made free, I closed my eyes on\nthe wilful debasement of our principles, knowing that the\ntransgressions could never be accounted to your charge, and that in\ngood time you would come to your senses, and throw the whole weight of\nyour crimes on the shoulders that had voluntarily stooped to receive\nthe load.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" said I, \"as I and all the justified have a good\nright to do. But what crimes? What misdemeanours and transgressions do\nyou talk about? For my part, I am conscious of none, and am utterly\namazed at insinuations which I do not comprehend.\"\n\n\"You have certainly been left to yourself for a season,\" returned he,\n\"having gone on rather like a person in a delirium than a Christian in\nhis sober sense. You are accused of having made away with your mother\nprivately; as also of the death of a beautiful young lady, whose\naffections you had seduced.\"\n\n\"It is an intolerable and monstrous falsehood!\" cried I, interrupting,\nhim. \"I never laid a hand on a woman to take away her life, and have\neven shunned their society from my childhood. I know nothing of my\nmother's exit; nor of that young lady's whom you mention. Nothing\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"I hope it is so,\" said he. \"But it seems there are some strong\npresumptuous proofs against you, and I came to warn you this day that a\nprecognition is in progress, and that unless you are perfectly\nconvinced, not only of your innocence but of your ability to prove it,\nit will be the safest course for you to abscond, and let the trial go\non without you.\"\n\n\"Never shall it be said that I shrunk from such a trial as this,\" said\nI. \"It would give grounds for suspicions of guilt that never had\nexistence, even in thought. I will go and show myself in every public\nplace, that no slanderous tongue may wag against me. I have shed the\nblood of sinners, but of these deaths I am guiltless; therefore I will\nface every tribunal, and put all my accusers down.\"\n\n\"Asseveration will avail you but little,\" answered he, composedly. \"It\nis, however, justifiable in its place, although to me it signifies\nnothing, who know too well that you did commit both crimes, in your own\nperson, and with your own hands. Far be it from me to betray you;\nindeed, I would rather endeavour to palliate the offences; for, though\nadverse to nature, I can prove them not to be so to the cause of pure\nChristianity, by the mode of which we have approved of it, and which we\nwish to promulgate.\"\n\n\"If this that you tell me be true,\" said I, \"then is it as true that I\nhave two souls, which take possession of my bodily frame by turns, the\none being all unconscious of what the other performs; for as sure as I\nhave at this moment a spirit within me, fashioned and destined to\neternal felicity, as sure am I utterly ignorant of the crimes you now\nlay to my charge.\"\n\n\"Your supposition may be true in effect,\" said he. \"We are all\nsubjected to two distinct natures in the same person. I myself have\nsuffered grievously in that way. The spirit that now directs my\nenergies is not that with which I was endowed at my creation. It is\nchanged within me, and so is my whole nature. My former days were those\nof grandeur and felicity. But, would you believe it? I was not then a\nChristian. Now I am. I have been converted to its truths by passing\nthrough the fire, and, since my final conversion, my misery has been\nextreme. You complain that I have not been able to render you more\nhappy than you were. Alas! do you expect it in the difficult and\nexterminating career which you have begun? I, however, promise you\nthis--a portion of the only happiness which I enjoy, sublime in its\nmotions, and splendid in its attainments--I will place you on the right\nhand of my throne, and show you the grandeur of my domains, and the\nfelicity of my millions of true professors.\"\n\nI was once more humbled before this mighty potentate, and promised to\nbe ruled wholly by his directions, although at that moment my nature\nshrunk from the concessions, and my soul longed rather to be inclosed\nin the deeps of the sea, or involved once more in utter oblivion. I was\nlike Daniel in the den of lions, without his faith in Divine support,\nand wholly at their mercy. I felt as one round whose body a deadly\nsnake is twisted, which continues to hold him in its fangs, without\ninjuring him, further than in moving its scaly infernal folds with\nexulting delight, to let its victim feel to whose power he has\nsubjected himself; and thus did I for a space drag an existence from\nday to day, in utter weariness and helplessness; at one time\nworshipping with great fervour of spirit, and at other times so wholly\nleft to myself as to work all manner of vices and follies with\ngreediness. In these my enlightened friend never accompanied me, but I\nalways observed that he was the first to lead me to every one of them,\nand then leave me in the lurch. The next day, after these my fallings\noff, he never failed to reprove me gently, blaming me for my venial\ntransgressions; but then he had the art of reconciling all, by\nreverting to my justified and infallible state, which I found to prove\na delightful healing salve for every sore.\n\nBut, of all my troubles, this was the chief. I was every day and every\nhour assailed with accusations of deeds of which I was wholly ignorant;\nof acts of cruelty, injustice, defamation, and deceit; of pieces of\nbusiness which I could not be made to comprehend; with lawsuits,\ndetails, arrestments of judgment, and a thousand interminable quibbles\nfrom the mouth of my loquacious and conceited attorney. So miserable\nwas my life rendered by these continued attacks that I was often\nobliged to lock myself up for days together, never seeing any person\nsave my man Samuel Scrape, who was a very honest blunt fellow, a\nstaunch Cameronian, but withal very little conversant in religious\nmatters. He said he came from a place called Penpunt, which I thought a\nname so ludicrous that I called him by the name of his native village,\nan appellation of which he was very proud, and answered everything with\nmore civility and perspicuity when I denominated him Penpunt, than\nSamuel, his own Christian name. Of this peasant was I obliged to make a\ncompanion on sundry occasions, and strange indeed were the details\nwhich he gave me concerning myself, and the ideas of the country people\nconcerning me. I took down a few of these in writing, to put off the\ntime, and here leave them on record to show how the best and greatest\nactions are misconstrued among sinful and ignorant men:\n\n\"You say, Samuel, that I hired you myself--that I have been a good\nenough master to you, and have paid you your weekly wages punctually.\nNow, how is it that you say this, knowing, as you do, that I never\nhired you, and never paid you a sixpence of wages in the whole course\nof my life, excepting this last month?\"\n\n\"Ye may as weel say, master, that water's no water, or that, stanes are\nno stanes. But that's just your gate, an' it's a great pity, aye to do\na thing an profess the clean contrair. Weel then, since you havena paid\nme ony wages, an' I can prove day and date when I was hired, an' came\nhame to your service, will you be sae kind as to pay me now? That's the\nbest way o' curing a man o' the mortal disease o' leasing-making that I\nken o'.\"\n\n\"I should think that Penpunt and Cameronian principles would not admit\nof a man taking twice payment for the same article.\"\n\n\"In sic a case as this, sir, it disna hinge upon principles, but a\npiece o' good manners; an' I can tell you that, at sic a crisis, a\nCameronian is a gay-an weel-bred man. He's driven to this, and he maun\neither make a breach in his friend's good name, or in his purse; an'\noh, sir, whilk o' thae, think you, is the most precious? For instance,\nan a Galloway drover had comed to the town o' Penpunt, an' said to a\nCameronian (the folk's a' Cameronians there), 'Sir, I want to buy your\ncow,' 'Vera weel,' says the Cameronian, 'I just want to sell the cow,\nsae gie me twanty punds Scots, an' take her w' ye.' It's a bargain. The\ndrover takes away the cow, an' gies the Cameronian his twanty pund\nScots. But after that, he meets him again on the white sands, amang a'\nthe drovers an' dealers o' the land, an' the Gallowayman, he says to\nthe Cameronian, afore a' thae witnesses, 'Come, Master Whiggam, I hae\nnever paid you for yon bit useless cow that I bought. I'll pay her the\nday, but you maun mind the luck-penny; there's muckle need for 't'--or\nsomething to that purpose. The Cameronian then turns out to be a civil\nman, an' canna bide to make the man baith a feele an' liar at the same\ntime, afore a' his associates; an' therefore he pits his principles aff\nat the side, to be  kind o' sleepin' partner, as it war, an' brings up\nhis good breeding to stand at the counter: he pockets the money, gies\nthe Galloway drover time o' day, an' comes his way. An' wha's to blame?\nMan mind yoursel is the first commandment. A Cameronian's principles\nnever came atween him an' his purse, nor sanna in the present case;\nfor, as I canna bide to make you out a leear, I'll thank you for my\nwages.\"\n\n\"Well, you shall have them, Samuel, if you declare to me that I hired\nyou myself in this same person, and bargained with you with this same\ntongue and voice with which I speak to you just now.\"\n\n\"That I do declare, unless ye hae twa persons o' the same appearance,\nand twa tongues to the same voice. But, 'od saif us, sir, do you ken\nwhat the auld wives o' the clachan say about you?\"\n\n\"How should I, when no one repeats it to me?\"\n\n\"Oo, I trow  it's a' stuff--folk shouldna heed what's said by auld\ncrazy kimmers. But there are some o' them weel kend for witches, too;\nan' they say, 'Lord have a care o' us!' They say the deil's often seen\ngaun sidie for sidie w' ye, whiles in ae shape, an' whiles in another.\nAn' they say that he whiles takes your ain shape, or else enters into\nyou, and then you turn a deil yoursel.\"\n\nI was so astounded at this terrible idea that had gone abroad,\nregarding my fellowship with the Prince of Darkness, that I could make\nno answer to the fellow's information, but sat like one in a stupor;\nand if it had not been for my well-founded faith, and conviction that I\nwas a chosen and elected one before the world was made, I should at\nthat moment have given in to the popular belief, and fallen into the\nsin of despondency; but I was preserved from such a fatal error by an\ninward and unseen supporter. Still the insinuation was so like what I\nfelt myself that I was greatly awed and confounded.\n\nThe poor fellow observed this, and tried to do away the impression by\nsome further sage remarks of his own.\n\n\"Hout, dear sir, it is balderdash, there's nae doubt o't. It is the\ncrownhead o' absurdity to tak in the havers o' auld wives for gospel. I\ntold them that my master was a peeous man, an' a sensible man; an', for\npraying, that he could ding auld Macmillan himsel. 'Sae could the\ndeil,' they said, 'when he liket, either at preaching or praying, if\nthese war to answer his ain ends.' 'Na, na,' says I, 'but he's a strick\nbeliever in a' the truths o' Christianity, my master.' They said, sae\nwas Satan, for that he was the firmest believer in a' the truths of\nChristianity that was out o' Heaven; an' that, sin' the Revolution that\nthe Gospel had turned sae rife, he had been often driven to the shift\no' preaching it himsel, for the purpose o' getting some wrang tenets\nintroduced into it, and thereby turning it into blasphemy and ridicule.\"\n\nI confess, to my shame, that I was so overcome by this jumble of\nnonsense that a chillness came over me, and, in spite of all my efforts\nto shake off the impression it had made, I fell into a faint. Samuel\nsoon brought me to myself, and, after a deep draught of wine and water,\nI was greatly revived, and felt my spirit rise above the sphere of\nvulgar conceptions and the restrained views of unregenerate men. The\nshrewd but loquacious fellow, perceiving this, tried to make some\namends for the pain he had occasioned to me by the following story,\nwhich I noted down, and which was brought on by a conversation to the\nfollowing purport:\n\n\"Now, Penpunt, you may tell me all that passed between you and the\nwives of the clachan. I am better of that stomach qualm, with which I\nam sometimes seized, and shall be much amused by hearing the sentiments\nof noted witches regarding myself and my connections.\"\n\n\"Weel, you see, sir, I says to them, 'It will be lang afore the deil\nintermeddle wi' as serious a professor, and as fervent a prayer as my\nmaster, for, gin he gets the upper hand o' sickan men, wha's to be\nsafe?' An', what think ye they said, sir? There was ane Lucky Shaw set\nup her lang lantern chafts, an' answered me, an' a' the rest shanned\nand noddit in assent an' approbation: 'Ye silly, sauchless, Cameronian\ncuif!' quo she, 'is that a' that ye ken about the wiles and doings o'\nthe Prince o' the Air, that rules an' works in the bairns of\ndisobedience? Gin ever he observes a proud professor, wha has mae than\nordinary pretensions to a divine calling, and that reards and prays\ntill the very howlets learn his preambles, that's the man Auld Simmie\nfixes on to mak a dishclout o'. He canna get rest in Hell, if he sees a\nman, or a set of men o' this stamp, an, when he sets fairly to work, it\nis seldom that he disna bring them round till his ain measures by hook\nor by crook. Then, Oh! it is a grand prize for him, an' a proud Deil he\nis, when he gangs hame to his ain ha', wi' a batch o' the souls o' sic\nstrenuous professors on his back. Aye, I trow, auld Ingleby, the\nLiverpool packman, never came up Glasco street wi' prouder pomp when he\nhad ten horse-laids afore him o' Flanders lace, an' Hollin lawn, an'\nsilks an' satins frae the eastern Indians, than Satan wad strodge into\nHell with a packlaid o' the souls o' proud professors on his braid\nshoulders. Ha, ha, ha! I think I see how the auld thief wad be gaun\nthrough his gizened dominions, crying his wares, in derision, \"Wha will\nbuy a fresh, cauler divine, a bouzy bishop, a fasting zealot, or a\npiping priest?\" For a' their prayers an' their praises, their aumuses,\nan' their penances, their whinings, their howlings, their rantings, an'\ntheir ravings, here they come at last! Behold  the end! Here go the\nrare and precious wares! A fat professor for a bodle, an' a lean ane\nfor half a merk!' I declare I trembled at the auld hag's ravings, but\nthe lave o' the kimmers applauded the sayings as sacred truths. An'\nthen Lucky went on: 'There are many wolves in sheep's claithing, among\nus, my man; mony deils aneath the masks o' zealous professors, roaming\nabout in kirks and meetinghouses o' the land. It was but the year afore\nthe last that the people o' the town o' Auchtermuchty grew so rigidly\nrighteous that the meanest hind among them became a shining light in\nither towns an' parishes. There was naught to be heard, neither night\nnor day, but preaching, praying, argumentation, an' catechising in a'\nthe famous town o' Auchtermuchty. The young men wooed their sweethearts\nout o' the Song o' Solomon, an' the girls returned answers in strings\no' verses out o' the Psalms. At the lint-swinglings, they said\nquestions round; and read chapters, and sang hymns at bridals; auld and\nyoung prayed in their dreams, an' prophesied in their sleep, till the\ndeils in the farrest nooks o' Hell were alarmed, and moved to\ncommotion. Gin it hadna been an auld carl, Robin Ruthven, Auchtermuchty\nwad at that time hae been ruined and lost for ever. But Robin was a\ncunning man, an' had rather mae wits than his ain, for he had been in\nthe hands o' the fairies when he was young, an' a' kinds o' spirits\nwere visible to his een, an' their language as familiar to him as his\nain mother tongue. Robin was sitting on the side o' the West Lowmond,\nae still gloomy night in September, when he saw a bridal o' corbie\ncraws coming east the lift, just on the edge o' the gloaming. The\nmoment that Robin saw them, he kenned, by their movements, that they\nwere craws o' some ither warld than this; so he signed himself, and\ncrap into the middle o' his bourock. The corbie craws came a' an' sat\ndown round about him, an' they poukit their black sooty wings, an'\nspread them out to the breeze to cool; and Robin heard ae corbie\nspeaking, an' another answering him; and the tane said to the tither:\n\"Where will the ravens find a prey the night?\" \"On the lean crazy souls\no' Auchtermuchty,\" quo the tither. \"I fear they will be o'er weel\nwrappit up in the warm flannens o' faith, an clouted wi' the dirty duds\no' repentance, for us to mak a meal o',\" quo the first. \"Whaten vile\nsounds are these that I hear coming bumming up the hill?\" \"Oh, these\nare the hymns and praises o' the auld wives and creeshy louns o'\nAuchtermuchty, wha are gaun crooning their way to Heaven; an', gin it\nwarna for the shame o' being beat, we might let our great enemy tak\nthem. For sic a prize as he will hae! Heaven, forsooth! What shall we\nthink o' Heaven, if it is to be filled wi' vermin like thae, amang whom\nthere is mair poverty and pollution than I can name.\" \"No matter for\nthat,\" said the first, \"we cannot have our power set at defiance;\nthough we should put them on the thief's hole, we must catch them, and\ncatch them with their own bait, too. Come all to church to-morrow, and\nI'll let you hear how I'll gull the saints of Auchtermuchty. In the\nmeantime, there is a feast on the Sidlaw hills tonight, below the hill\nof Macbeth--Mount, Diabolus, and fly.\" Then, with loud croaking and\ncrowing, the bridal of corbies again scaled the dusky air, and left\nRobin Ruthven in the middle of his cairn.\n\n\"'The next day the congregation met in the kirk of Auchtermuchty, but\nthe minister made not his appearance. The elder ran out and in making\ninquiries; but they could learn nothing, save that the minister was\nmissing. They ordered the clerk to sing a part of the 119th Psalm,\nuntil they saw if the minister would cast up. The clerk did as he was\nordered, and, by the time he reached the 77th verse, a strange divine\nentered the church, by the western door, and advanced solemnly up to\nthe pulpit. The eyes of all the congregation were riveted on the\nsublime stranger, who was clothed in a robe of black sackcloth, that\nflowed all around him, and trailed far behind, and they weened him an\nangel, come to exhort them, in disguise. He read out his text from the\nProphecies of Ezekiel, which consisted of these singular words: \"I will\noverturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he\ncome, whose right it is, and I will give it him.\"\n\n\"'From these words he preached such a sermon as never was heard by\nhuman ears, at least never by ears of Auchtermuchty. It was a true,\nsterling, gospel sermon--it was striking, sublime, and awful in the\nextreme. He finally made out the IT, mentioned in the text, to mean,\nproperly and positively, the notable town of Auchtermuchty. He proved\nall the people in it, to their perfect satisfaction, to be in the gall\nof bitterness and bond of iniquity, and he assured them that God would\noverturn them, their principles, and professions; and that they should\nbe no more, until the Devil, the town's greatest enemy, came, and then\nit should be given unto him for a prey, for it was his right, and to\nhim it belonged, if there was not forthwith a radical change made in\nall their opinions and modes of worship.\n\n\"'The inhabitants of Auchtermuchty were electrified--they were charmed;\nthey were actually raving mad about the grand and sublime truths\ndelivered to them by this eloquent and impressive preacher of\nChristianity. \"He is a prophet of the Lord,\" said one, \"sent to warn\nus, as Jonah was sent to the Ninevites.\" \"Oh, he is an angel sent from\nHeaven, to instruct this great city,\" said another, \"for no man ever\nuttered truths so sublime before.\" The good people of Auchtermuchty\nwere in perfect raptures with the preacher, who had thus sent them to\nHell by the slump, tag-rag, and bobtail! Nothing in the world delights\na truly religious people so much as consigning them to eternal\ndamnation. They wandered after the preacher--they crowded together, and\nspoke of his sermon with admiration, and still, as they conversed, the\nwonder and the admiration increased; so that honest Robin Ruthven's\nwords would not be listened to. It was in vain that he told them he\nheard a raven speaking, and another raven answering him: the people\nlaughed him to scorn, and kicked him out of their assemblies, as a one\nwho spoke evil of dignities; and they called him a warlock, an' a daft\nbody, to think to mak language out o' the crouping o' craws.\n\n\"'The sublime preacher could not be heard of, although all the country\nwas sought for him, even to the minutest corner of St. Johnston and\nDundee; but as he had announced another sermon on the same text, on a\ncertain day, all the inhabitants of that populous country, far and\nnear, flocked to Auchtermuchty. Cupar, Newburgh, and Strathmiglo,\nturned out men, women and children. Perth and Dundee gave their\nthousands; and, from the East Nook of Fife to the foot of the Grampian\nhills, there was nothing but running and riding that morning to\nAuchtermuchty. The kirk would not hold the thousandth part of them. A\nsplendid tent was erected on the brae north of the town, and round that\nthe countless congregation assembled. When they were all waiting\nanxiously for the great preacher, behold, Robin Ruthven set up his head\nin the tent, and warned his countrymen to beware of the doctrines they\nwere about to hear, for he could prove, to their satisfaction, that\nthey were all false, and tended to their destruction!\n\n\"'The whole multitude raised a cry of indignation against Robin, and\ndragged him from the tent, the elders rebuking him, and the multitude\nthreatening to resort to stronger measures; and, though he told them a\nplain and unsophisticated tale of the black corbies, he was only\nderided. The great preacher appeared once more, and went through his\ntwo discourses with increased energy and approbation. All who heard him\nwere amazed, and many of them went into fits, writhing and foaming in a\nstate of the most horrid agitation. Robin Ruthven sat on the outskirts\nof the great assembly, listening with the rest, and perceived what\nthey, in the height of their enthusiasm, perceived not the ruinous\ntendency of the tenets so sublimely inculcated. Robin kenned the voice\nof his friend the corby-craw again, and was sure he could not be wrong:\nsae, when public worship was finished, a' the elders an' a' the gentry\nflocked about the great preacher, as he stood on the green brae in the\nsight of the hale congregation, an' a' war alike anxious to pay him\nsome mark o' respect. Robin Ruthven came in amang the thrang, to try to\neffect what he had promised; and, with the greatest readiness and\nsimplicity, just took baud o' the side o' the wide gown, and, in sight\nof a' present, held it aside as high as the preacher's knee, and,\nbehold, there was a pair o' cloven feet! The auld thief was fairly\ncatched in the very height o' his proud conquest, an' put down by an\nauld carl. He could feign nae mair, but, gnashing on Robin wi' his\nteeth, he dartit into the air like a fiery dragon, an' keust a reid\nrainbow o'er the taps o' the Lowmonds.\n\n\"'A' the auld wives an weavers o' Auchtermuchty fell down flat wi'\naffright, an' betook them to their prayers aince again, for they saw\nthe dreadfu' danger they had escapit, an' frae that day to this it is a\nhard matter to gar an Auchtermuchty man listen to a sermon at a', an' a\nharder ane still to gar him applaud ane, for he thinks aye that he sees\nthe cloven foot peeping out frae aneath ilka sentence.\n\n\"'Now, this is a true story, my man,' quo the auld wife, 'an', whenever\nyou are doubtfu' of a man, take auld Robin Ruthven's plan, an' look for\nthe cloven foot, for it's a thing that winna weel hide; an' it appears\nwhiles where ane wadna think o't. It will keek out frae aneath the\nparson's gown, the lawyer's wig, and the Cameronian's blue bannet; but\nstill there is a gouden rule whereby to detect it, an' that never,\nnever fails.' The auld witch didna gie me the rule, an' though I hae\nheard tell o't often an' often, shame fa' me an I ken what it is! But\nye will ken it well, an' it wad be nae the waur of a trial on some o'\nyour friends, maybe; for they say there's a certain gentleman seen\nwalking wi' you whiles, that, wherever he sets his foot, the grass\nwithers as gin it war scoudered wi' a het ern. His presence be about\nus! What's the matter wi' you, master. Are ye gaun to take the calm o'\nthe stamock again?\"\n\nThe truth is, that the clown's absurd story, with the still more\nridiculous application, made me sick at heart a second time. It was not\nbecause I thought my illustrious friend was the Devil, or that I took a\nfool's idle tale as a counterbalance to Divine revelation that had\nassured me of my justification in the sight of God before the existence\nof time. But, in short, it gave me a view of my own state, at which I\nshuddered, as indeed I now always did when the image of my devoted\nfriend and ruler presented itself to my mind. I often communed, with my\nheart on this, and wondered how a connection, that had the well-being\nof mankind solely in view, could be productive of fruits so bitter. I\nthen went to try my works by the Saviour's golden rule, as my servant\nhad put it into my head to do; and, behold, not one of them could stand\nthe test. I had shed blood on a ground on which I could not admit that\nany man had a right to shed mine; and I began to doubt the motives of\nmy adviser once more, not that they were intentionally bad, but that\nhis was some great mind led astray by enthusiasm or some overpowering\npassion.\n\nHe seemed to comprehend every one of these motions of my heart, for his\nmanner towards me altered every day. It first became anything but\nagreeable, then supercilious, and, finally, intolerable; so that I\nresolved to shake him off, cost what it would, even though I should be\nreduced to beg my bread in a foreign land. To do it at home was\nimpossible, as he held my life in his hands, to sell it whenever he had\na mind; and, besides, his ascendancy over me was as complete as that of\na huntsman over his dogs: I was even so weak as, the next time I met\nwith him, to look steadfastly at his foot, to see if it was not cloven\ninto two hoofs. It was the foot of a gentleman in every respect, so far\nas appearances went, but the form of his counsels was somewhat\nequivocal, and, if not double, they were amazingly crooked.\n\nBut, if I had taken my measures to abscond and fly from my native\nplace, in order to free myself of this tormenting, intolerant, and\nbloody reformer, he had likewise taken his to expel me, or throw me\ninto the hands of justice. It seems that, about this time, I was\nhaunted by some spies connected with my late father and brother, of\nwhom the mistress of the former was one. My brother's death had been\nwitnessed by two individuals; indeed, I always had an impression that\nit was witnessed by more than one, having some faint recollection of\nhearing voices and challenges close beside me; and this woman had\nsearched about until she found these people; but, as I shrewdly\nsuspected, not without the assistance of the only person in my\nsecret--my own warm and devoted friend. I say this, because I found\nthat he had them concealed in the neighbourhood, and then took me again\nand again where I was fully exposed to their view, without being aware.\nOne time in particular, on pretence of gratifying my revenge on that\nbase woman, he knew so well where she lay concealed that he led me to\nher, and left me to the mercy of two viragos who had very nigh taken my\nlife. My time of residence at Dalcastle was wearing to a crisis. I\ncould no longer live with my tyrant, who haunted me like my shadow;\nand, besides, it seems there were proofs of murder leading against me\nfrom all quarters. Of part of these I deemed myself quite free, but the\nworld deemed otherwise; and how the matter would have gone God only\nknows, for, the case never having undergone a judicial trial, I do not.\nIt perhaps, however, behoves me here to relate all that I know of it,\nand it is simply this:\n\nOn the first of June, 1712 (well may I remember the day), I was sitting\nlocked in my secret chamber, in a state of the utmost despondency,\nrevolving in my mind what I ought to do to be free of my persecutors,\nand wishing myself a worm, or a moth, that I might be crushed and at\nrest, when behold Samuel entered, with eyes like to start out of his\nhead, exclaiming: \"For God's sake, master, fly and hide yourself, for\nyour mother's found, an' as sure as you're a living soul, the blame is\ngaun to fa' on you!\"\n\n\"My mother found!\" said I. \"And, pray, where has she been all this\nwhile?\" In the meantime, I was terribly discomposed at the thoughts of\nher return.\n\n\"Been, sir! Been? Why, she has been where ye pat her, it seems--lying\nburied in the sands o' the linn. I can tell you, ye will see her a\nfrightsome figure, sic as I never wish to see again. An' the young lady\nis found too, sir: an' it is said the Devil--I beg pardon, sir, your\nfriend, I mean--it is said your friend has made the discovery, an' the\nfolk are away to raise officers, an' they will be here in an hour or\ntwo at the farthest, sir; an' sae you hae not a minute to lose, for\nthere's proof, sir, strong proof, an' sworn proof, that ye were last\nseen wi' them baith; sae, unless ye can gie a' the better an account o'\nbaith yoursel an' them either hide or flee for your bare life.\"\n\n\"I will neither hide nor fly,\" said I, \"for I am as guiltless of the\nblood of these women as the child unborn.\"\n\n\"The country disna think sae, master; an' I can assure you that, should\nevidence fail, you run a risk o' being torn limb frae limb. They are\nbringing the corpse here, to gar ye touch them baith afore witnesses,\nan' plenty o' witnesses there will be!\"\n\n\"They shall not bring them here,\" cried I, shocked beyond measure at\nthe experiment about to be made. \"Go, instantly and debar them from\nentering my gate with their bloated and mangled carcases!\"\n\n\"The body of your own mother, sir!\" said the fellow emphatically. I was\nin terrible agitation; and, being driven to my wits' end, I got up and\nstrode furiously round and round the room. Samuel wist not what to do,\nbut I saw by his staring he deemed me doubly guilty. A tap came to the\nchamber door: we both started like guilty creatures; and as for Samuel,\nhis hairs stood all on end with alarm, so that, when I motioned to him,\nhe could scarcely advance to open the door. He did so at length, and\nwho should enter but my illustrious friend, manifestly in the utmost\nstate of alarm. The moment that Samuel admitted him, the former made\nhis escape by the prince's side as he entered, seemingly in a state of\ndistraction. I was little better, when I saw this dreaded personage\nenter my chamber, which he had never before attempted; and, being\nunable to ask his errand, I suppose I stood and gazed on him like a\nstatue.\n\n\"I come with sad and tormenting tidings to you, my beloved and\nungrateful friend,\" said he, \"but, having only a minute left to save\nyour life, I have come to attempt it. There is a mob coming towards you\nwith two dead bodies, which will place you in circumstances\ndisagreeable enough: but that is not the worst, for of that you may be\nable to clear yourself. At this moment there is a party of officers,\nwith a justiciary warrant from Edinburgh, surrounding the house, and\nabout to begin the search of it for you. If you fall into their hands,\nyou are inevitably lost; for I have been making earnest inquiries, and\nfind that everything is in train for your ruin.\"\n\n\"Aye, and who has been the cause of all this?\" said I, with great\nbitterness. But he stopped me short, adding, \"There is no time for such\nreflections at present; I gave my word of honour, that your life should\nbe safe from the hand of man. So it shall, if the power remain with me\nto save it. I am come to redeem my pledge, and to save your life by the\nsacrifice of my own. Here--not one word of expostulation, change habits\nwith me, and you may then pass by the officers, and guards, and even\nthrough the approaching mob, with the most perfect temerity. There is a\nvirtue in this garb, and, instead of offering to detain you, they shall\npay you obeisance. Make haste, and leave this place for the present,\nflying where you best may, and, if I escape from these dangers that\nsurround me, I will endeavour to find you out, and bring you what\nintelligence I am able.\"\n\nI put on his green frock coat, buff belt, and a sort of a turban that\nhe always wore on his head, somewhat resembling a bishop's mitre: he\ndrew his hand thrice across my face, and I withdrew as he continued to\nurge me. My hall door and postern gate were both strongly guarded, and\nthere were sundry armed people within, searching the closets; but all\nof them made way for me, and lifted their caps as I passed by them.\nOnly one superior officer accosted me, asking if I had seen the\nculprit. I knew not what answer to make, but chanced to say, with great\ntruth and propriety: \"He is safe enough.\" The man beckoned with a\nsmile, as much as to say: \"Thank you, sir, that is quite sufficient,\"\nand I walked deliberately away.\n\nI had not well left the gate till, hearing a great noise coming from\nthe deep glen towards the east, I turned that way, deeming myself quite\nsecure in this my new disguise, to see what it was, and if matters were\nas had been described to me. There I met a great mob, sure enough,\ncoming with two dead bodies stretched on boards, and decently covered\nwith white sheets. I would fain have examined their appearance, had I\nnot perceived the apparent fury in the looks of the men, and judged\nfrom that how much more safe it was for me not to intermeddle in the\naffray. I cannot tell how it was, but I felt a strange and unwonted\ndelight in viewing this scene, and a certain pride of heart in being\nsupposed the perpetrator of the unnatural crimes laid to my charge.\nThis was a feeling quite new to me; and if there were virtues in the\nrobes of the illustrious foreigner, who had without all dispute\npreserved my life at this time: I say, if there was any inherent virtue\nin these robes of his, as he had suggested, this was one of their\neffects' that they turned my heart towards that which was evil,\nhorrible, and disgustful.\n\nI mixed with the mob to hear what they were saying. Every tongue was\nengaged in loading me with the most opprobrious epithets! One called me\na monster of nature; another an incarnate devil; and another a creature\nmade to be cursed in time and eternity. I retired from them and, winded\nmy way southwards, comforting myself with the assurance that so mankind\nhad used and persecuted the greatest fathers and apostles of the\nChristian Church, and that their vile opprobrium could not alter the\ncounsels of Heaven concerning me.\n\nOn going over that rising ground called Dorington Moor, I could not\nhelp turning round and taking a look of Dalcastle. I had little doubt\nthat it would be my last look, and nearly as little ambition that it\nshould not. I thought how high my hopes of happiness and advancement\nhad been on entering that mansion, and taking possession of its rich\nand extensive domains, and how miserably I had been disappointed. On\nthe contrary, I had experienced nothing but chagrin, disgust, and\nterror; and I now consoled myself with the hope that I should\nhenceforth shake myself free of the chains of my great tormentor, and\nfor that privilege was I willing to encounter any earthly distress. I\ncould not help perceiving that I was now on a path which was likely to\nlead me into a species of distress hitherto unknown, and hardly dreamed\nof by me, and that was total destitution. For all the riches I had been\npossessed of a few hours previous to this, I found that here I was\nturned out of my lordly possessions without a single merk, or the power\nof lifting and commanding the smallest sum, without being thereby\ndiscovered and seized. Had it been possible for me to have escaped in\nmy own clothes, I had a considerable sum secreted in these, but, by the\nsudden change, I was left without a coin for present necessity. But I\nhad hope in Heaven, knowing that the just man would not be left\ndestitute and that, though many troubles surrounded him, he would at\nlast be set free from them all. I was possessed of strong and brilliant\nparts, and a liberal education; and, though I had somehow unaccountably\nsuffered my theological qualifications to fall into desuetude, since my\nacquaintance with the ablest and most rigid of all theologians, I had\nnevertheless hopes that, by preaching up redemption by grace,\npreordination, and eternal purpose, I should yet be enabled to benefit\nmankind in some country, and rise to high distinction.\n\nThese were some of the thoughts by which I consoled myself as I posted\non my way southwards, avoiding the towns and villages, and falling into\nthe cross ways that led from each of the great roads passing east and\nwest to another. I lodged the first night in the house of a country\nweaver, into which I stepped at a late hour, quite overcome with hunger\nand fatigue, having travelled not less than thirty miles from my late\nhome. The man received me ungraciously, telling me of a gentleman's\nhouse at no great distance, and of an inn a little farther away; but I\nsaid I delighted more in the society of a man like him than that of any\ngentleman of the land, for my concerns were with the poor of this\nworld, it being easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle\nthan for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n\nThe weaver's wife, who sat with a child on her knee, and had not\nhitherto opened her mouth, hearing me speak in that serious and\nreligious style, stirred up the fire with her one hand; then, drawing a\nchair near it, she said: \"Come awa, honest lad, in by here; sin' it be\nsae that you belang to Him wha gies us a' that we hae, it is but right\nthat you should share a part. You are a stranger, it is true, but them\nthat winna entertain a stranger will never entertain an angel unawares.\"\n\nI never was apt to be taken with the simplicity of nature; in general I\ndespised it; but, owing to my circumstances at the time, I was deeply\naffected by the manner of this poor woman's welcome. The weaver\ncontinued in a churlish mood throughout the evening, apparently\ndissatisfied with what his wife had done in entertaining me, and spoke\nto her in a manner so crusty that I thought proper to rebuke him, for\nthe woman was comely in her person, and virtuous in her conversation;\nbut the weaver, her husband, was large of make, ill-favoured, and\npestilent; therefore did I take him severely to task for the tenor of\nhis conduct; but the man was froward, and answered me rudely with\nsneering and derision and, in the height of his caprice, he said to his\nwife: \"Whan focks are sae keen of a chance o' entertaining angels,\ngude-wife, it wad maybe be worth their while to tak tent what kind o'\nangels they are. It wadna wonder me vera muckle an ye had entertained\nyour friend the Deil the night, for aw thought aw fand a saur o' reek\nan' brimstane about him. He's nane o' the best o' angels, an focks\nwinna hae muckle credit by entertaining him.\"\n\nCertainly, in the assured state I was in, I had as little reason to be\nalarmed at mention being made of the Devil as any person on earth: of\nlate, however, I felt that the reverse was the case, and that any\nallusion to my great enemy moved me exceedingly. The weaver's speech\nhad such an effect on me that both he and his wife were alarmed at my\nlooks. The latter thought I was angry, and chided her husband gently\nfor his rudeness; but the weaver himself rather seemed to be confirmed\nin his opinion that I was the Devil, for he looked round like a\nstartled roe-buck, and immediately betook him to the family Bible.\n\nI know not whether it was on purpose to prove my identity or not, but I\nthink he was going to desire me either to read a certain portion of\nScripture that he had sought out, or to make family worship, had not\nthe conversation at that instant taken another turn; for the weaver,\nnot knowing how to address me, abruptly asked my name, as he was about\nto put the Bible into my hands. Never having considered myself in the\nlight of a male-factor, but rather as a champion in the cause of truth,\nand finding myself perfectly safe under my disguise, I had never once\nthought of the utility of changing my name, and, when the man asked me,\nI hesitated; but, being compelled to say something, I said my name was\nCowan. The man stared at me, and then at his wife, with a look that\nspoke a knowledge of something alarming or mysterious.\n\n\"Ha! Cowan?\" said he. \"That's most extraordinar! Not Colwan, I hope?\"\n\n\"No: Cowan is my sirname,\" said I. \"But why not Colwan, there being so\nlittle difference in the sound?\"\n\n\"I was feared ye might be that waratch that the Deil has taen the\npossession o', an' eggit him on to kill baith his father an' his\nmother, his only brother, an' his sweetheart,\" said he; \"an', to say\nthe truth, I'm no that sure about you yet, for I see you're gaun wi'\narms on ye.\"\n\n\"Not I, honest man,\" said I. \"I carry no arms; a man conscious of his\ninnocence and uprightness of heart needs not to carry arms in his\ndefence now.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, maister,\" said he; \"an' pray what div ye ca' this bit\nwindlestrae that's appearing here?\" With that he pointed to something\non the inside of the breast of my frock-coat. I looked at it, and there\ncertainly was the gilded haft of a poniard, the same weapon I had seen\nand handled before, and which I knew my illustrious companion carried\nabout with him; but till that moment I knew not that I was in\npossession of it. I drew it out: a more dangerous or insidious-looking\nweapon could not be conceived. The weaver and his wife were both\nfrightened, the latter in particular; and she being my friend, and I\ndependent on their hospitality for that night, I said: \"I declare I\nknew not that I carried this small rapier, which has been in my coat by\nchance, and not by any design of mine. But, lest you should think that\nI meditate any mischief to any under this roof I give it into your\nhands, requesting of you to lock it by till tomorrow, or when I shall\nnext want it.\"\n\nThe woman seemed rather glad to get hold of it; and taking it from me,\nshe went into a kind of pantry out of my sight, and locked the weapon\nup; and then the discourse went on.\n\n\"There cannot be such a thing in reality,\" said I, \"as the story you\nwere mentioning just now, of a man whose name resembles mine.\"\n\n\"It's likely that you ken a wee better about the story than I do,\nmaister,\" said he, \"suppose you do leave the L out of your name. An'\nyet I think sic a waratch, an' a murderer, wad hae taen a name wi' some\ngritter difference in the sound. But the story is just that true that\nthere were twa o' the Queen's officers here nae mair than an hour ago,\nin pursuit o' the vagabond, for they gat some intelligence that he had\nfled this gate; yet they said he had been last seen wi' black claes on,\nan' they supposed he was clad in black. His ain servant is wi' them,\nfor the purpose o' kennin the scoundrel, an' they're galloping through\nthe country like madmen. I hope in God they'll get him, an' rack his\nneck for him!\"\n\nI could not say Amen to the weaver's prayer, and therefore tried to\ncompose myself as well as I could, and made some religious comment on\nthe causes of the nation's depravity. But suspecting that my potent\nfriend had betrayed my flight and disguise, to save his life, I was\nvery uneasy, and gave myself up for lost. I said prayers in the family,\nwith the tenor of which the wife was delighted, but the weaver still\ndissatisfied; and, after a supper of the most homely fare, he tried to\nstart an argument with me, proving that everything for which I had\ninterceded in my prayer was irrelevant to man's present state. But I,\nbeing weary and distressed in mind, shunned the contest, and requested\na couch whereon to repose.\n\nI was conducted into the other end of the house, among looms, treadles,\npirns, and confusion without end; and there, in a sort of box, was I\nshut up for my night's repose, for the weaver, as he left me,\ncautiously turned the key of my apartment, and left me to shift for\nmyself among the looms, determined that I should escape from the house\nwith nothing. After he and his wife and children were crowded into\ntheir den, I heard the two mates contending furiously about me in\nsuppressed voices, the one maintaining the probability that I was the\nmurderer, and the other proving the impossibility of it. The husband,\nhowever, said as much as let me understand that he had locked me up on\npurpose to bring the military, or officers of justice, to seize me. I\nwas in the utmost perplexity, yet for all that, and the imminent danger\nI was in, I fell asleep, and a more troubled and tormenting sleep never\nenchained a mortal frame. I had such dreams that they will not bear\nrepetition, and early in the morning I awaked, feverish, and parched\nwith thirst.\n\nI went to call mine host, that he might let me out to the open air,\nbut, before doing so, I thought it necessary to put on some clothes. In\nattempting to do this, a circumstance arrested my attention (for which\nI could in nowise account, which to this day I cannot unriddle, nor\nshall I ever be able to comprehend it while I live): the frock and\nturban, which had furnished my disguise on the preceding day, were both\nremoved, and my own black coat and cocked hat laid down in their place.\nAt first I thought I was in a dream, and felt the weaver's beam, web,\nand treadle-strings with my hands, to convince myself that I was awake.\nI was certainly awake; and there was the door locked firm and fast as\nit was the evening before. I carried my own black coat to the small\nwindow and examined it. It was my own in verity; and the sums of money\nthat I had concealed in case of any emergency, remained untouched. I\ntrembled with astonishment; and on my return from the small window went\ndoiting in amongst the weaver's looms, till I entangled myself, and\ncould not get out again without working great deray amongst the coarse\nlinen threads that stood in warp from one end of the apartment unto the\nother. I had no knife whereby to cut the cords of this wicked man, and\ntherefore was obliged to call out lustily for assistance. The weaver\ncame half naked, unlocked the door, and, setting in his head and long\nneck, accosted me thus:\n\n\"What now, Mr. Satan? What for art ye roaring that gate? Are you fawn\ninna little hell, instead o' the big muckil ane? Deil be in your\nreistit trams! What for have ye abscondit yoursel into ma leddy's wab\nfor?\"\n\n\"Friend, I beg your pardon,\" said I. \"I wanted to be at the light, and\nhave somehow unfortunately involved myself in the intricacies of your\nweb, from which I cannot get clear without doing you a great injury.\nPray do lend your experienced hand to extricate me.\"\n\n\"May aw the pearls o' damnation light on your silly snout, an I dinna\nestricat ye weel enough! Ye ditit donnart, deil's burd that ye be! What\nmade ye gang howkin in there to be a poor man's ruin? Come out, ye vile\nrag-of-a-muffin, or I gar ye come out wi' mair shame and disgrace, an'\nfewer haill banes in your body.\"\n\nMy feet had slipped down through the double warpings of a web, and not\nbeing able to reach the ground with them (there being a small pit\nbelow) I rode upon a number of yielding threads, and, there being\nnothing else that I could reach, to extricate myself was impossible. I\nwas utterly powerless; and, besides, the yarn and cords hurt me very\nmuch. For all that, the destructive weaver seized a loom-spoke, and\nbegan a-beating me most unmercifully, while, entangled as I was, I\ncould do nothing but shout aloud for mercy, or assistance, whichever\nchanced to be within hearing. The latter at length made its appearance\nin the form of the weaver's wife, in the same state of dishabille with\nhimself, who instantly interfered, and that most strenuously, on my\nbehalf. Before her arrival, however, I had made a desperate effort to\nthrow myself out of the entanglement I was in; for the weaver continued\nrepeating his blows and cursing me so that I determined to get out of\nhis meshes at any risk. The effect made my case worse; for, my feet\nbeing wrapt among the nether threads, as I threw myself from my saddle\non the upper ones, my feet brought the others up through these, and I\nhung with my head down and my feet as firm as they had been in a vice.\nThe predicament of the web being thereby increased, the weaver's wrath\nwas doubled in proportion, and he laid on without mercy.\n\nAt this critical juncture the wife arrived, and without hesitation\nrushed before her offended lord, withholding his hand from injuring me\nfurther, although then it was uplifted along with the loom-spoke in\noverbearing ire. \"Dear Johnny! I think ye be gaen dementit this\nmorning. Be quiet, my dear, an' dinna begin a Boddel Brigg business in\nyour ain house. What for ir ye persecutin' a servant o' the Lord's that\ngate, an' pitting the life out o' him wi' his head down an' his heels\nup?\"\n\n\"Had ye said a servant o' the Deil's, Nans, ye wad hae been nearer the\nnail, for gin he binna the Auld Ane himsel, he's gayan sib till him.\nThere, didna I lock him in on purpose to bring the military on him; an'\nin the place o' that, hasna he keepit me in a sleep a' this while as\ndeep as death? An' here do I find him abscondit like a speeder i' the\nmids o' my leddy's wab, an' me dreamin' a' the night that I had the\nDeil i' my house, an' that he was clapper-clawin me ayont the loom.\nHave at you, ye brunstane thief!\" and, in spite of the good woman's\nstruggles, he lent me another severe blow.\n\n\"Now, Johnny Dods, my man! oh, Johnny Dods, think if that be like a\nChristian, and ane o' the heroes o' Boddel Brigg, to entertain a\nstranger, an' then bind him in a web wi' his head down, an' mell him to\ndeath! oh, Johnny Dods, think what you are about! Slack a pin, an' let\nthe good honest religious lad out.\"\n\nThe weaver was rather overcome, but still stood to his point that I was\nthe Deil, though in better temper; and, as he slackened the web to\nrelease me, he remarked, half laughing: \"Wha wad hae thought that John\nDods should hae escapit a' the snares an' dangers that circumfauldit\nhim, an' at last should hae weaved a net to catch the Deil.\"\n\nThe wife released me soon, and carefully whispered me, at the same\ntime, that it would be as well for me to dress and be going. I was not\nlong in obeying, and dressed myself in my black clothes, hardly knowing\nwhat I did, what to think, or whither to betake myself. I was sore hurt\nby the blows of the desperate ruffian; and, what was worse, my ankle\nwas so much strained that I could hardly set my foot to the ground. I\nwas obliged to apply to the weaver once more, to see if I could learn\nanything about my clothes, or how the change was effected. \"Sir,\" said\nI, \"how comes it that you have robbed me of my clothes, and put these\ndown in their place over night?\"\n\n\"Ha! thae claes? Me pit down the claes!\" said he, gaping with\nastonishment, and touching the clothes with the point of his\nforefinger. \"I never saw them afore, as I have death to meet wi', so\nhelp me God!\"\n\nHe strode into the work-house where I slept, to satisfy himself that my\nclothes were not there, and returned perfectly aghast with\nconsternation. \"The doors were baith fast lockit,\" said he. \"I could\nhae defied a rat either to hae gotten out or in. My dream has been\ntrue! My dream has been true! The Lord judge between thee and me; but\nin His name, I charge you to depart out o' this house; an', gin it be\nyour will, dinna tak the braidside o't w'ye, but gang quietly out at\nthe door wi' your face foremost. Wife, let naught o' this enchanter's\nremain i' the house, to be a curse, an' a snare to us; gang an' bring\nhim his gildit weapon, an' may the Lord protect a' his ain against its\nhellish an' deadly point!\"\n\nThe wife went to seek my poniard, trembling so excessively that she\ncould hardly walk, and, shortly after, we heard a feeble scream from\nthe pantry. The weapon had disappeared with the clothes, though under\ndouble lock and key; and, the terror of the good people having now\nreached a disgusting extremity, I thought proper to make a sudden\nretreat, followed by the weaver's anathemas.\n\nMy state both of body and mind was now truly deplorable. I was hungry,\nwounded, and lame, an outcast and a vagabond in society; my life sought\nafter with avidity, and all for doing that to which I was predestined\nby Him who fore-ordains whatever comes to pass. I knew not whither to\nbetake me. I had purposed going into England and there making some use\nof the classical education I had received, but my lameness rendered\nthis impracticable for the present. I was therefore obliged to turn my\nface towards Edinburgh, where I was little known--where concealment was\nmore practicable than by skulking in the country, and where I might\nturn my mind to something that was great and good. I had a little\nmoney, both Scotch and English, now in my possession, but not one\nfriend in the whole world on whom I could rely. One devoted friend, it\nis true, I had, but he was become my greatest terror. To escape from\nhim, I now felt that I would willingly travel to the farthest corners\nof the world, and be subjected to every deprivation; but after the\ncertainty of what had taken place last night, after I had travelled\nthirty miles by secret and by-ways, I saw not how escape from him was\npossible.\n\nMiserable, forlorn, and dreading every person that I saw, either behind\nor before me, I hasted on towards Edinburgh, taking all the by and\nunfrequented paths; and, the third night after I left the weaver's\nhouse, I reached the West Port, without meeting with anything\nremarkable. Being exceedingly fatigued and lame, I took lodgings in the\nfirst house I entered, and for these I was to pay two groats a week,\nand to board and sleep with a young man who wanted a companion to make\nhis rent easier. I liked this; having found from experience that the\ngreat personage who had attached himself to me, and was now become my\ngreatest terror among many surrounding evils, generally haunted me when\nI was alone keeping aloof from all other society.\n\nMy fellow lodger came home in the evening, and was glad at my coming.\nHis name was Linton, and I changed mine to Elliot. He was a flippant\nunstable being, one on whom nothing appeared a difficulty, in his own\nestimation, but who could effect very little after all. He was what is\ncalled by some a compositor, in the Queen's printing house, then\nconducted by a Mr. James Watson. In the course of our conversation that\nnight, I told him I was a first-rate classical scholar, and would\ngladly turn my attention to some business wherein my education might\navail me something; and that there was nothing would delight me so much\nas an engagement in the Queen's printing office. Linton made no\ndifficulty in bringing about that arrangement. His answer was: \"Oo, gud\nsir, you are the very man we want. Gud bless your breast and your\nbuttons, sir! Aye, that's neither here nor there. That's all very well.\nHa, ha, ha. A by-word in the house, sir. But, as I was saying, you are\nthe very man we want. You will get any money you like to ask, sir. Any\nmoney you like, sir. God bless your buttons!--That's settled--All\ndone--Settled, settled--I'll do it, I'll do it--No more about it; no\nmore about it. Settled, settled.\"\n\nThe next day I went with him to the office, and he presented me to Mr.\nWatson as the most wonderful genius and scholar ever known. His\nrecommendation had little sway with Mr. Watson, who only smiled at\nLinton's extravagances, as one does at the prattle of an infant. I\nsauntered about the printing office for the space of two or three\nhours, during which time Watson bustled about with green spectacles on\nhis nose, and took no heed of me. But, seeing that I still lingered, he\naddressed me at length, in a civil gentlemanly way, and inquired\nconcerning my views. I satisfied him with all my answers, in particular\nthose to his questions about the Latin and Greek languages; but when he\ncame to ask testimonials of my character and acquirements, and found\nthat I could produce none, he viewed me with a jealous eye, and said he\ndreaded I was some n'er-do-weel, run from my parents or guardians, and\nhe did not choose to employ any such. I said my parents were both dead;\nand that, being thereby deprived of the means of following out my\neducation, it behoved me to apply to some business in which my\neducation might be of some use to me. He said he would take me into the\noffice, and pay me according to the business I performed and the manner\nin which I deported myself; but he could take no man into Her Majesty's\nprinting office upon a regular engagement who could not produce the\nmost respectable references with regard to morals.\n\nI could not but despise the man in my heart who laid such a stress upon\nmorals, leaving grace out of the question; and viewed it as a\ndeplorable instance of human depravity and self-conceit; but, for all\nthat, I was obliged to accept of his terms, for I had an inward thirst\nand longing to distinguish myself in the great cause of religion, and I\nthought, if once I could print my own works, how I would astonish\nmankind, and confound their self-wisdom and their esteemed\nmorality--blow up the idea of any dependence on good works, and\nmorality, forsooth! And I weened that I might thus get me a name even\nhigher than if I had been made a general of the Czar Peter's troops\nagainst the infidels.\n\nI attended the office some hours every day, but got not much\nencouragement, though I was eager to learn everything, and could soon\nhave set types considerably well. It was here that I first conceived\nthe idea of writing this journal, and having it printed, and applied to\nMr. Watson to print it for me, telling him it was a religious parable\nsuch as the Pilgrim's Progress. He advised me to print it close, and\nmake it a pamphlet, and then, if it did not sell, it would not cost me\nmuch; but that religious pamphlets, especially if they had a shade of\nallegory in them, were the very rage of the day. I put my work to the\npress, and wrote early and late; and encouraging my companion to work\nat odd hours and on Sundays, before the press-work of the second sheet\nwas begun, we had the work all in types, corrected, and a clean copy\nthrown off for further revisal. The first sheet was wrought off; and I\nnever shall forget how my heart exulted when at the printing house this\nday I saw what numbers of my works were to go abroad among mankind, and\nI determined with myself that I would not put the Border name of\nElliot, which I had assumed, to the work.\n\n\n\nThus far have my History and Confessions been carried.\n\nI must now furnish my Christian readers with a key to the process,\nmanagement, and winding up of the whole matter; which I propose, by the\nassistance of God, to limit to a very few pages.\n\nChesters, July 27, 1712.--My hopes and prospects are a wreck. My\nprecious journal is lost! consigned to the flames! My enemy hath found\nme out, and there is no hope of peace or rest for me on this side the\ngrave.\n\nIn the beginning of last week, my fellow lodger came home, running in a\ngreat panic, and told me a story of the Devil having appeared twice in\nthe printing house, assisting the workmen at the printing of my book,\nand that some of them had been frightened out of their wits. That the\nstory was told to Mr. Watson, who till that time had never paid any\nattention to the treatise, but who, out of curiosity, began and read a\npart of it, and thereupon flew into a great rage, called my work a\nmedley of lies and blasphemy, and ordered the whole to be consigned to\nthe flames, blaming his foreman, and all connected with the press, for\nletting a work go so far that was enough to bring down the vengeance of\nHeaven on the concern.\n\nIf ever I shed tears through perfect bitterness of spirit it was at\nthat time, but I hope it was more for the ignorance and folly of my\ncountrymen than the overthrow of my own hopes. But my attention was\nsuddenly aroused to other matters, by Linton mentioning  that it was\nsaid by some in the office the Devil had inquired for me.\n\n\"Surely you are not such a fool,\" said I, \"as to believe that the Devil\nreally was in the printing office?\"\n\n\"Oo, Gud bless you, sir! Saw him myself, gave him a nod, and good-day.\nRather a gentlemanly personage--Green Circassian hunting coat and\nturban--Like a foreigner--Has the power of vanishing in one moment\nthough--Rather a suspicious circumstance that. Otherwise, his\nappearance not much against him.\"\n\nIf the former intelligence thrilled me with grief, this did so with\nterror. I perceived who the personage was that had visited the printing\nhouse in order to further the progress of my work; and, at the approach\nof every person to our lodgings, I from that instant trembled every\nbone, lest it should be my elevated and dreaded friend. I could not say\nI had ever received an office at his hand that was not friendly, yet\nthese offices had been of a strange tendency; and the horror with which\nI now regarded him was unaccountable to myself. It was beyond\ndescription, conception, or the soul of man to bear. I took my printed\nsheets, the only copy of my unfinished work existing; and, on pretence\nof going straight to Mr. Watson's office, decamped from my lodgings at\nPortsburgh a little before the fall of evening, and took the road\ntowards England.\n\nAs soon as I got clear of the city, I ran with a velocity I knew not\nbefore I had been capable of. I flew out the way towards Dalkeith so\nswiftly that I often lost sight of the ground, and I said to myself,\n\"Oh, that I had the wings of a dove, that I might fly to the farthest\ncorners of the earth, to hide me from those against whom I have no\npower to stand!\"\n\nI travelled all that night and the next morning, exerting myself beyond\nmy power; and about noon the following day I went into a yeoman's\nhouse, the name of which was Ellanshaws, and requested of the people a\ncouch of any sort to lie down on, for I was ill, and could not proceed\non my journey. They showed me to a stable-loft where there were two\nbeds, on one of which I laid me down; and, falling into a sound sleep,\nI did not awake till the evening, that other three men came from the\nfields to sleep in the same place, one of whom lay down beside me, at\nwhich I was exceedingly glad. They fell all sound asleep, and I was\nterribly alarmed at a conversation I overheard somewhere outside the\nstable. I could not make out a sentence, but trembled to think I knew\none of the voices at least, and, rather than not be mistaken, I would\nthat any man had run me through with a sword. I fell into a cold sweat,\nand once thought of instantly putting hand to my own life, as my only\nmeans of relief (may the rash and sinful thought be in mercy forgiven!)\nwhen I heard as it were two persons at the door, contending, as I\nthought, about their right and interest in me. That the one was\nforcibly preventing the admission of the other, I could hear\ndistinctly, and their language was mixed with something dreadful and\nmysterious. In an agony of terror, I awakened my snoring companion with\ngreat difficulty, and asked him, in a low whisper, who these were at\nthe door. The man lay silent and listening till fairly awake, and then\nasked if I heard anything. I said I had heard strange voices contending\nat the door.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, lad, it has been something neither good nor\ncanny,\" said he. \"It's no for naething that our horses are snorking\nthat gate.\"\n\nFor the first time, I remarked that the animals were snorting and\nrearing as if they wished to break through the house. The man called to\nthem by their names, and ordered them to be quiet; but they raged still\nthe more furiously. He then roused his drowsy companions, who were\nalike alarmed at the panic of the horses, all of them declaring that\nthey had never seen either Mause or Jolly start in their lives before.\nMy bed-fellow and another then ventured down the ladder, and I heard\none of them then saying: \"Lord be wi' us! What can be i' the house? The\nsweat's rinning off the poor beasts like water.\"\n\nThey agreed to sally out together, and if possible to reach the kitchen\nand bring a light. I was glad at this, but not so much so when I heard\nthe one man saying to the other, in a whisper: \"I wish that stranger\nman may be canny enough.\"\n\n\"God kens!\" said the other. \"It does nae look unco weel.\"\n\nThe lad in the other bed, hearing this, set up his head in manifest\naffright as the other two departed for the kitchen; and, I believed he\nwould have been glad to have been in their company. This lad was next\nthe ladder, at which I was extremely glad, for, had he not been there,\nthe world should not have induced me to wait the return of these two\nmen. They were not well gone before I heard another distinctly enter\nthe stable, and come towards the ladder. The lad who was sitting up in\nhis bed, intent on the watch, called out: \"Wha's that there? Walker, is\nthat you? Purdie, I say is it you?\"\n\nThe darkling intruder paused for a few moments, and then came towards\nthe foot of the ladder. The horses broke loose, and, snorting and\nneighing for terror, raged through the house. In all my life I never\nheard so frightful a commotion. The being that occasioned it all now\nbegan to mount the ladder towards our loft, on which the lad in the bed\nnext the ladder sprung from his couch, crying out: \"The L--d A--y\npreserve us! What can it be?\" With that he sped across the loft and by\nmy bed, praying lustily all the way; and, throwing himself from the\nother end of the loft into a manger, he darted, naked as he was,\nthrough among the furious horses, and, making the door that stood open,\nin a moment he vanished and left me in the lurch. Powerless with\nterror, and calling out fearfully, I tried to follow his example; but,\nnot knowing the situation of the places with regard to one another, I\nmissed the manger, and fell on the pavement in one of the stalls. I was\nboth stunned and lamed on the knee; but, terror prevailing, I got up\nand tried to escape. It was out of my power; for there were divisions\nand cross divisions in the house, and mad horses smashing everything\nbefore them, so that I knew not so much as on what side of the house\nthe door was. Two or three times was I knocked down by the animals, but\nall the while I never stinted crying out with all my power. At length,\nI was seized by the throat and hair of the head, and dragged away, I\nwist not whither. My voice was now laid, and all my powers, both mental\nand bodily, totally overcome; and I remember no more till I found\nmyself lying naked on the kitchen table of the farm-house, and\nsomething like a horse's rug thrown over me. The only hint that I got\nfrom the people of the house on coming to myself was that my absence\nwould be good company; and that they had got me in a woeful state, one\nwhich they did not choose to describe, or hear described.\n\nAs soon as day-light appeared, I was packed about my business, with the\nhisses and execrations of the yeoman's family, who viewed me as a being\nto be shunned, ascribing to me the visitations of that unholy night.\nAgain was I on my way southwards, as lonely, hopeless, and degraded a\nbeing as was to be found on life's weary round. As I limped out the\nway, I wept, thinking of what I might have been, and what I really had\nbecome: of my high and flourishing hopes when I set out as the avenger\nof God on the sinful children of men; of all that I had dared for the\nexaltation and progress of the truth; and it was with great difficulty\nthat my faith remained unshaken, yet was I preserved from that sin, and\ncomforted myself with the certainty that the believer's progress\nthrough life is one of warfare and suffering.\n\nMy case was indeed a pitiable one. I was lame, hungry, fatigued, and my\nresources on the very eve of being exhausted. Yet these were but\nsecondary miseries, and hardly worthy of a thought compared with those\nI suffered inwardly. I not only looked around me with terror at every\none that approached, but I was become a terror to myself, or, rather,\nmy body and soul were become terrors to each other; and, had it been\npossible, I felt as if they would have gone to war. I dared not look at\nmy face in a glass, for I shuddered at my own image and likeness. I\ndreaded the dawning, and trembled at the approach of night, nor was\nthere one thing in nature that afforded me the least delight.\n\nIn this deplorable state of body and mind, was I jogging on towards the\nTweed, by the side of the small river called Ellan, when, just at the\nnarrowest part of the glen, whom should I meet full in the face but the\nvery being in all the universe of God would the most gladly have\nshunned. I had no power to fly fro him, neither durst I, for the spirit\nwithin me, accuse him of falsehood and renounce his fellowship. I stood\nbefore him like a condemned criminal, staring him in the face, ready to\nbe winded, twisted, and tormented as he pleased. He regarded me with a\nsad and solemn look. How changed was now that majestic countenance to\none of haggard despair--changed in all save the extraordinary likeness\nto my late brother, a resemblance which misfortune and despair tended\nonly to heighten. There were no kind greetings passed between us at\nmeeting, like those which pass between the men of the world; he looked\non me with eyes that froze the currents of my blood, but spoke not till\nI assumed as much courage as to articulate: \"You here! I hope you have\nbrought me tidings of comfort?\"\n\n\"Tidings of despair!\" said he. \"But such tidings as the timid and the\nungrateful deserve, and have reason to expect. You are an outlaw, and a\nvagabond in your country, and a high reward is offered for your\napprehension. The enraged populace have burnt your house, and all that\nis within it; and the farmers on the land bless themselves at being rid\nof you. So fare it with everyone who puts his hand to the great work of\nman's restoration to freedom, and draweth back, contemning the light\nthat is within him! Your enormities caused me to leave you to yourself\nfor a season, and you see what the issue has been. You have given some\nevil ones power over you, who long to devour you, both soul and body,\nand it has required all my power and influence to save you. Had it not\nbeen for my hand, you had been torn in pieces last night; but for once\nI prevailed. We must leave this land forthwith, for here there is\nneither peace, safety, nor comfort for us. Do you now and here pledge\nyourself to one who has so often saved your life and has put his own at\nstake to do so? Do you pledge yourself that you will henceforth be\nguided by my counsel, and follow me whithersoever I choose to lead?\"\n\n\"I have always been swayed by your counsel,\" said I, \"and for your\nsake, principally, am I sorry that all our measures have proved\nabortive. But I hope still to be useful in my native isle, therefore\nlet me plead that your highness will abandon a poor despised and\noutcast wretch to his fate, and betake you to your realms, where your\npresence cannot but be greatly wanted.\"\n\n\"Would that I could do so!\" said he woefully. \"But to talk of that is\nto talk of an impossibility. I am wedded to you so closely that I feel\nas if I were the same person. Our essences are one, our bodies and\nspirits being united, so that I am drawn towards you as by magnetism,\nand, wherever you are, there must my presence be with you.\"\n\nPerceiving how this assurance affected me, he began to chide me most\nbitterly for my ingratitude; and then he assumed such looks that it was\nimpossible for me longer to bear them; therefore I staggered out of the\nway, begging and beseeching of him to give me up to my fate, and hardly\nknowing what I said; for it struck me that, with all his assumed\nappearance of misery and wretchedness, there were traits of exultation\nin his hideous countenance, manifesting a secret and inward joy at my\nutter despair.\n\nIt was long before I durst look over my shoulder, but, when I did so, I\nperceived this ruined and debased potentate coming slowly on the same\npath, and I prayed that the Lord would hide me in the bowels of the\nearth or depths of the sea. When I crossed the Tweed, I perceived him\nstill a little behind me; and, my despair being then at its height, I\ncursed the time I first met with such a tormentor; though on a little\nrecollection it occurred that it was at that blessed time when I was\nsolemnly dedicated to the Lord, and assured of my final election, and\nconfirmation, by an eternal decree never to be annulled. This being my\nsole and only comfort, I recalled my curse upon the time, and repented\nme o my rashness.\n\nAfter crossing the Tweed, I saw no more of my persecutor that day, and\nhad hopes that he had left me for a season; but, alas, what hope was\nthere of my relief after the declaration I had so lately heard! I took\nup my lodgings that night in a small miserable inn in the village of\nAncrum, of which the people seemed alike poor and ignorant. Before\ngoing to bed, I asked if it was customary with them to have family\nworship of evenings. The man answered that they were so hard set with\nthe world they often could not get time, but if I would be so kind as\nto officiate they would be much obliged to me. I accepted the\ninvitation, being afraid to go to rest lest the commotions of the\nforegoing night might be renewed, and continued the worship as long as\nin decency I could. The poor people thanked me, hoped my prayers would\nbe heard both on their account and my own, seemed much taken with my\nabilities, and wondered how a man of my powerful eloquence chanced to\nbe wandering about in a condition so forlorn. I said I was a poor\nstudent of theology, on my way to Oxford. They stared at one another\nwith expressions of wonder, disappointment, and fear. I afterwards came\nto learn that the term theology was by them quite misunderstood, and\nthat they had some crude conceptions that nothing was taught at Oxford\nbut the black arts, which ridiculous idea prevailed over all the south\nof Scotland. For the present I could not understand what the people\nmeant, and less so when the man asked me, with deep concern: \"If I was\nserious in my intentions of going to Oxford? He hoped not, and that I\nwould be better guided.\"\n\nI said my education wanted finishing; but he remarked that the Oxford\narts were a bad finish for a religious man's education. Finally, I\nrequested him to sleep with me, or in my room all the night, as I\nwanted some serious and religious conversation with him, and likewise\nto convince him that the study of the fine arts, though not absolutely\nnecessary, were not incompatible with the character of a Christian\ndivine. He shook his head, and wondered how I could call them fine\narts--hoped I did not mean to convince him by any ocular demonstration,\nand at length reluctantly condescended to sleep with me, and let the\nlass and wife sleep together for one night. I believe he would have\ndeclined it had it not been some hints from his wife, stating that it\nwas a good arrangement, by which I understood there were only two beds\nin the house, and that when I was preferred to the lass's bed, she had\none to shift for.\n\nThe landlord and I accordingly retired to our homely bed, and conversed\nfor some time about indifferent matters, till he fell sound asleep. Not\nso with me: I had that within which would not suffer me to close my\neyes; and, about the dead of night, I again heard the same noises and\ncontention begin outside the house as I had heard the night before; and\nagain I heard it was about a sovereign and peculiar right in me. At one\ntime the noise was on the top of the house, straight above our bed, as\nif the one party were breaking through the roof, and the other forcibly\npreventing it; at another it was at the door, and at a third time at\nthe window; but still mine host lay sound by my side, and did not\nwaken. I was seized with terrors indefinable, and prayed fervently, but\ndid not attempt rousing my sleeping companion until I saw if no better\ncould be done. The women, however, were alarmed, and, rushing into our\napartment, exclaimed that all the devils in hell were besieging the\nhouse. Then, indeed, the landlord awoke, and it was time for him, for\nthe tumult had increased to such a degree that it shook the house to\nits foundations, being louder and more furious than I could have\nconceived the heat of battle to be when the volleys of artillery are\nmixed with groans, shouts, and blasphemous cursing. It thundered and\nlightened; and there were screams, groans, laughter, and execrations,\nall intermingled.\n\nI lay trembling and bathed in a cold perspiration, but was soon obliged\nto bestir myself, the inmates attacking me one after the other.\n\n\"Oh, Tam Douglas! Tam Douglas! haste ye an' rise out frayont that\nincarnal devil!\" cried the wife. \"Ye are in ayont the auld ane himsel,\nfor our lass Tibbie saw his cloven cloots last night.\"\n\n\"Lord forbid!\" roared Tam Douglas, and darted over the bed like a\nflying fish. Then, hearing the unearthly tumult with which he was\nsurrounded, he turned to the side of the bed, and addressed me thus,\nwith long and fearful intervals:\n\n\"If ye be the Deil, rise up, an' depart in peace out o' this\nhouse--afore the bedstrae take kindling about ye, an' than it'll maybe\nbe the waur for ye. Get up--an' gang awa out amang your cronies, like a\ngood lad. There's nae body here wishes you ony ill. D'ye hear me?\"\n\n\"Friend,\" said I, \"no Christian would turn out a fellow creature on\nsuch a night as this and in the midst of such a commotion of the\nvillagers.\"\n\n\"Na, if ye be a mortal man,\" said he, \"which I rather think, from the\nuse you made of the holy book. Nane o' your practical jokes on\nstrangers an' honest foks. These are some o' your Oxford tricks, an'\nI'll thank you to be ower wi' them. Gracious heaven, they are brikkin\nthrough the house at a' the four corners at the same time!\"\n\nThe lass Tibby, seeing the innkeeper was not going to prevail with me\nto rise, flew towards the bed in desperation, and, seizing me by the\nwaist, soon landed me on the floor, saying: \"Be ye deil, be ye chiel,\nye's no lie there till baith the house an' us be swallowed up!\"\n\nHer master and mistress applauding the deed, I was obliged to attempt\ndressing myself, a task to which my powers were quite inadequate in the\nstate I was in, but I was readily assisted by every one of the three;\nand, as soon as they got my clothes thrust on in a loose way, they shut\ntheir eyes lest they should see what might drive them distracted, and\nthrust me out to the street, cursing me, and calling on the fiends to\ntake their prey and be gone.\n\nThe scene that ensued is neither to be described nor believed if it\nwere. I was momently surrounded by a number of hideous fiends, who\ngnashed on me with their teeth, and clenched their crimson paws in my\nface; and at the same instant I was seized by the collar of my coat\nbehind, by my dreaded and devoted friend, who pushed me on and, with\nhis gilded rapier waving and brandishing around me, defended me against\nall their united attacks. Horrible as my assailants were in appearance\n(and they all had monstrous shapes) I felt that I would rather have\nfallen into their hands than be thus led away captive by my defender at\nhis will and pleasure without having the right or power to say my life,\nor any part of my will, was my own. I could not even thank him for his\npotent guardianship, but hung down my head, and moved on I knew not\nwhither, like a criminal led to execution and still the infernal combat\ncontinued till about the dawning, at which time I looked up, and all\nthe fiends were expelled but one, who kept at a distance; and still my\npersecutor and defender pushed me by the neck before him.\n\nAt length he desired me to sit down and take some rest, with which I\ncomplied, for I had great need of it, and wanted the power to withstand\nwhat he desired. There, for a whole morning did he detain me,\ntormenting me with reflections on the past, and pointing out the\nhorrors of the future, until a thousand times I wished myself\nnon-existent. \"I have attached myself to your wayward fortune,\" said\nhe, \"and it has been my ruin as well as thine. Ungrateful as you are, I\ncannot give you up to be devoured; but this is a life that it is\nimpossible to brook longer. Since our hopes are blasted in this world,\nand all our schemes of grandeur overthrown; and since our everlasting\ndestiny is settled by a decree which no act of ours can invalidate, let\nus fall by our own hands, or by the hands of each other; die like\nheroes; and, throwing off this frame of dross and corruption, mingle\nwith the pure ethereal essence of existence, from which we derived our\nbeing.\"\n\nI shuddered at a view of the dreadful alternative, yet was obliged to\nconfess that in my present circumstances existence was not to be borne.\nIt was in vain that I reasoned on the sinfulness of the deed, and on\nits damning nature; he made me condemn myself out of my own mouth, by\nallowing the absolute nature of justifying grace and the impossibility\nof the elect ever falling from the faith, or the glorious end to which\nthey were called; and then he said, this granted, self-destruction was\nthe act of a hero, and none but a coward would shrink from it, to\nsuffer a hundred times more every day and night that passed over his\nhead.\n\nI said I was still contented to be that coward; and all that I begged\nof him was to leave me to my fortune for a season, and to the just\njudgement of my Creator; but he said his word and honour were engaged\non my behalf, and these, in such a case, were not to be violated. \"If\nyou will not pity yourself, have pity on me,\" added he. \"Turn your eyes\non me, and behold to what I am reduced.\"\n\nInvoluntarily did I turn at the request, and caught a half glance of\nhis features. May no eye destined to reflect the beauties of the New\nJerusalem inward upon the beatific soul behold such a sight as mine\nthen beheld! My immortal spirit, blood and bones, were all withered at\nthe blasting sight; and I arose and withdrew, with groanings which the\npangs of death shall never wring from me.\n\nNot daring to look behind me, I crept on my way, and that night reached\nthis hamlet on the Scottish border; and being grown reckless of danger,\nand hardened to scenes of horror, I took up my lodging with a poor\nhind, who is a widower, and who could only accommodate me with a bed of\nrushes at his fireside. At midnight I heard some strange sounds, too\nmuch resembling those to which I had of late been inured; but they kept\nat a distance, and I was soon persuaded that there was a power\nprotected that house superior to those that contended for or had the\nmastery over me. Overjoyed at finding such an asylum, I remained in the\nhumble cot. This is the third day I have lived under the roof, freed of\nmy hellish assailants, spending my time in prayer, and writing out this\nmy journal, which I have fashioned to stick in with my printed work,\nand to which I intend to add portions while I remain in this pilgrimage\nstate, which, I find too well, cannot be long.\n\nAugust 3, 1712.--This morning the hind has brought me word from\nRedesdale, whither he had been for coals, that a stranger gentleman had\nbeen traversing that country, making the most earnest inquiries after\nme, or one of the same appearance; and, from the description that he\nbrought of this stranger, I could easily perceive who it was. Rejoicing\nthat my tormentor has lost traces of me for once, I am making haste to\nleave my asylum, on pretence of following this stranger, but in reality\nto conceal myself still more completely from his search. Perhaps this\nmay be the last sentence ever I am destined to write. If so, farewell,\nChristian reader! May God grant to thee a happier destiny than has been\nallotted to me here on earth, and the same assurance of acceptance\nabove! Amen.\n\nAult-Righ, August 24, 1712.--Here am I, set down on the open moor to\nadd one sentence more to my woeful journal; and, then, farewell, all\nbeneath the sun!\n\nOn leaving the hind's cottage on the Border, I hasted to the\nnorth-west, because in that quarter I perceived the highest and wildest\nhills before me. As I crossed the mountains above Hawick, I exchanged\nclothes with a poor homely shepherd, whom I found lying on a hill-side,\nsinging to himself some woeful love ditty. He was glad of the change,\nand proud of his saintly apparel; and I was no less delighted with\nmine, by which I now supposed myself completely disguised; and I found\nmoreover that in this garb of a common shepherd I was made welcome in\nevery house. I slept the first night in a farm-house nigh to the church\nof Roberton, without hearing or seeing aught extraordinary; yet I\nobserved next morning that all the servants kept aloof from me, and\nregarded me with looks of aversion. The next night I came to this\nhouse, where the farmer engaged me as a shepherd; and, finding him a\nkind, worthy, and religious man, I accepted of his terms with great\ngladness. I had not, however, gone many times to the sheep, before all\nthe rest of the shepherds told my master that I knew nothing about\nherding, and begged of him to dismiss me. He perceived too well the\ntruth of their intelligence; but, being much taken with my learning and\nreligious conversation, he would not put me away, but set me to herd\nhis cattle.\n\nIt was lucky for me that before I came here a report had prevailed,\nperhaps for an age, that this farm-house was haunted at certain seasons\nby a ghost. I say it was lucky for me for I had not been in it many\ndays before the same appalling noises began to prevail around me about\nmidnight, often continuing till near the dawning. Still they kept\naloof, and without doors; for this gentleman's house, like the cottage\nI was in formerly, seemed to be a sanctuary from all demoniacal power.\nHe appears to be a good man and a just, and mocks at the idea of\nsupernatural agency, and he either does not hear these persecuting\nspirits or will not acknowledge it, though of late he appears much\nperturbed.\n\nThe consternation of the menials has been extreme. They ascribe all to\nthe ghost, and tell frightful stories of murders having been committed\nthere long ago. Of late, however, they are beginning to suspect that it\nis I that am haunted; and, as I have never given them any satisfactory\naccount of myself, they are whispering that I am a murderer, and\nhaunted by the spirits of those I have slain.\n\nAugust 30.--This day I have been informed that I am to be banished the\ndwelling-house by night, and to sleep in an outhouse by myself, to try\nif the family can get any rest when freed of my presence. I have\nperemptorily refused acquiescence, on which my master's brother struck\nme, and kicked me with his foot. My body being quite exhausted by\nsuffering, I am grown weak and feeble both in mind and bodily frame,\nand actually unable to resent any insult or injury. I am the child of\nearthly misery and despair, if ever there was one existent. My master\nis still my friend; but there are so many masters here, and everyone of\nthem alike harsh to me, that I wish myself in my grave every hour of\nthe day. If I am driven from the family sanctuary by night, I know I\nshall be torn in pieces before morning; and then who will deign or dare\nto gather up my mangled limbs, and give me honoured burial?\n\nMy last hour is arrived: I see my tormentor once more approaching me in\nthis wild. Oh, that the earth would swallow me up, or the hill fall and\ncover me! Farewell for ever!\n\nSeptember 7, 1712.--My devoted, princely, but sanguine friend has been\nwith me again and again. My time is expired and I find a relief beyond\nmeasure, for he has fully convinced me that no act of mine can mar the\neternal counsel, or in the smallest degree alter or extenuate one event\nwhich was decreed before the foundations of the world were laid. He\nsaid he had watched over me with the greatest anxiety, but, perceiving\nmy rooted aversion towards him, he had forborne troubling me with his\npresence. But now, seeing that I was certainly to be driven from my\nsanctuary that night, and that there would be a number of infernals\nwatching to make a prey of my body, he came to caution me not to\ndespair, for that he would protect me at all risks, if the power\nremained with him. He then repeated an ejaculatory prayer, which I was\nto pronounce, if in great extremity. I objected to the words as\nequivocal, and susceptible of being rendered in a meaning perfectly\ndreadful; but he reasoned against this, and all reasoning with him is\nto no purpose. He said he did not ask me to repeat the words unless\ngreatly straitened; and that I saw his strength and power giving way,\nand when perhaps nothing else could save me.\n\nThe dreaded hour of night arrived; and, as he said, I was expelled from\nthe family residence, and ordered to a byre, or cow-house, that stood\nparallel with  the dwelling-house behind, where, on a divot loft, my\nhumble bedstead stood, and the cattle grunted and puffed below me. How\nunlike the splendid halls of Dalcastle! And to what I am now reduced,\nlet the reflecting reader judge. Lord, thou knowest all that I have\ndone for Thy cause on earth! Why then art Thou laying Thy hand so sore\nupon me? Why hast Thou set me as a butt of Thy malice? But Thy will\nmust be done! Thou wilt repay me in a better world. Amen.\n\nSeptember 8.--My first night of trial in this place is overpast! Would\nthat it were the last that I should ever see in this detested world! If\nthe horrors of hell are equal to those I have suffered, eternity will\nbe of short duration there, for no created energy can support them for\none single month, or week. I have been buffeted as never living\ncreature was. My vitals have all been torn, and every faculty and\nfeeling of my soul racked, and tormented into callous insensibility. I\nwas even hung by the locks over a yawning chasm, to which I could\nperceive no bottom, and then--not till then, did I repeat the\ntremendous prayer!--I was instantly at liberty; and what I now am, the\nAlmighty knows! Amen.\n\nSeptember 18, 1712.--Still am I living, though liker to a vision than a\nhuman being; but this is my last day of mortal existence. Unable to\nresist any longer, I pledged myself to my devoted friend that on this\nday we should die together, and trust to the charity of the children of\nmen for a grave. I am solemnly pledged; and, though I dared to repent,\nI am aware he will not be gainsaid, for he is raging with despair at\nhis fallen and decayed majesty, and there is some miserable comfort in\nthe idea that my tormentor shall fall with me. Farewell, world, with\nall thy miseries; for comforts or enjoyments hast thou none! Farewell,\nwoman, whom I have despised and shunned; and man, whom I have hated;\nwhom, nevertheless, I desire to leave in charity! And thou, sun, bright\nemblem of a far brighter effulgence, I bid farewell to thee also! I do\nnot now take my last look of thee, for to thy glorious orb shall a poor\nsuicide's last earthly look be raised. But, ah! who is yon that I see\napproaching furiously, his stern face blackened with horrid despair! My\nhour is at hand. Almighty God, what is this that I am about to do! The\nhour of repentance is past, and now my fate is inevitable. Amen, for\never! I will now seal up my little book, and conceal it; and cursed be\nhe who trieth to alter or amend.\n\n\nEND OF THE MEMOIR\n\n\n\nWHAT can this work be? Sure, you will say, it must be an allegory; or\n(as the writer calls it) a religious PARABLE, showing the dreadful\ndanger of self-righteousness? I cannot tell. Attend to the sequel:\nwhich is a thing so extraordinary, so unprecedented, and so far out of\nthe common course of human events that, if there were not hundreds of\nliving witnesses to attest the truth of it, I would not bid any\nrational being believe it.\n\nIn the first place, take the following extract from an authentic\nletter, published in Blackwood's Magazine for August, 1823.\n\n\"On the top of a wild height called Cowan's-Croft, where the lands of\nthree proprietors meet all at one point, there has been for long and\nmany years the grave of a suicide marked out by a stone standing at the\nhead and another at the feet. Often have I stood musing over it myself,\nwhen a shepherd on one of the farms, of which it formed the extreme\nboundary, and thinking what could induce a young man, who had scarcely\nreached the prime of life, to brave his Maker, and rush into His\npresence by an act of his own erring hand, and one so unnatural and\npreposterous. But it never once occurred to me, as an object of\ncuriosity, to dig up the mouldering bones of the Culprit, which I\nconsidered as the most revolting of all objects. The thing was,\nhowever, done last month, and a discovery made of one of the greatest\nnatural phenomena that I have heard of in this country.\n\n\"The little traditionary history that remains of this unfortunate youth\nis altogether a singular one. He was not a native of the place, nor\nwould he ever tell from what place he came; but he was remarkable for a\ndeep, thoughtful, and sullen disposition. There was nothing against his\ncharacter that anybody knew of here, and he had been a considerable\ntime in the place. The last service he was in was with a Mr. Anderson,\nof Eltrive (Ault-Righ, the King's Burn), who died about 100 years ago,\nand who had hired him during the summer to herd a stock of young cattle\nin Eltrive Hope. It happened one day in the month of September that\nJames Anderson, his master's son, went with this young man to the Hope\nto divert himself. The herd had his dinner along with him, and about\none o'clock, when the boy proposed going home, the former pressed him\nvery hard to stay and take share of his dinner; but the boy refused for\nfear his parents might be alarmed about him, and said he would go home:\non which the herd said to him, 'Then, if ye winna stay with me, James,\nye may depend on't I'll cut my throat afore ye come back again.'\n\n\"I have heard it likewise reported, but only by one person, that there\nhad been some things stolen out of his master's house a good while\nbefore, and that the boy had discovered a silver knife and fork that\nwas a part of the stolen property, in the herd's possession that day,\nand that it was this discovery that drove him to despair.\n\n\"The boy did not return to the Hope that afternoon; and, before\nevening, a man coming in at the pass called The Hart Loup, with a drove\nof lambs, on the way for Edinburgh, perceived something like a man\nstanding in a strange frightful position at the side of one of\nEldinhope hay-ricks. The driver's attention was riveted on this strange\nuncouth figure, and, as the drove-road passed at no great distance from\nthe spot, he first called, but, receiving no answer, he went up to the\nspot, and behold it was the above-mentioned young man, who had hung\nhimself in the hay rope that was tying down the rick.\n\n\"This was accounted a great wonder; and everyone said, if the Devil had\nnot assisted him, it was impossible the thing could have been done;\nfor, in general, these ropes are so brittle, being made of green hay,\nthat they will scarcely bear to be bound over the rick. And, the more\nto horrify the good people of this neighbourhood, the driver said, when\nhe first came in view, he could almost give his oath that he saw two\npeople busily engaged at the hay-rick going round it and round it, and\nhe thought they were dressing it.\n\n\"If this asseveration approximated at all to truth, it makes this\nevident at least, that the unfortunate young man had hanged himself\nafter the man with the lambs came in view. He was, however, quite dead\nwhen he cut him down. He had fastened two of the old hay-ropes at the\nbottom of the rick on one side (indeed, they are all fastened so when\nfirst laid on) so that he had nothing to do but to loosen two of the\nends on the other side. These he had tied in a knot round his neck, and\nthen slackening his knees, and letting himself down gradually, till the\nhay-rope bore all his weight, he had contrived to put an end to his\nexistence in that way. Now the fact is, that, if you try all the ropes\nthat are thrown over all the out-field hay-ricks in Scotland, there is\nnot one among a thousand of them will hang a colley dog; so that the\nmanner of this wretch's death was rather a singular circumstance.\n\n\"Early next morning, Mr. Anderson's servants went reluctantly away,\nand, taking an old blanket with them for a winding sheet, they rolled\nup the body of the deceased, first in his own plaid, letting the\nhay-rope still remain about his neck, and then, rolling the old blanket\nover all, they bore the loathed remains away to the distance of three\nmiles or so, on spokes, to the top of Cowan's-Croft, at the very point\nwhere the Duke of Buccleuch's land, the Laird of Drummelzier's, and\nLord Napier's meet, and there they buried him, with all that he had on\nand about him, silver knife and fork and altogether. Thus far went\ntradition, and no one ever disputed one jot of the disgusting oral tale.\n\n\"A nephew of that Mr. Anderson's who was with the hapless youth that\nday he died says that, as far as he can gather from the relations of\nfriends that he remembers, and of that same uncle in particular, it is\none hundred and five years next month (that is September, 1823) since\nthat event happened; and I think it likely that this gentleman's\ninformation is correct. But sundry other people, much older than he,\nwhom I have consulted, pretend that it is six or seven years more. They\nsay they have heard that Mr. James Anderson was then a boy ten years of\nage; that he lived to an old age, upwards of fourscore, and it is two\nand forty years since he died. Whichever way it may be, it was about\nthat period some way: of that there is no doubt.\n\n\"It so happened that two young men, William Shiel and W. Sword, were\nout on an adjoining height this summer, casting peats, and it came into\ntheir heads to open this grave in the wilderness, and see if there were\nany of the bones of the suicide of former ages and centuries remaining.\nThey did so, but opened only one half of the grave, beginning at the\nhead and about the middle at the same time. It was not long till they\ncame upon the old blanket--I think, they said not much more than a foot\nfrom the surface. They tore that open, and there was the hay-rope lying\nstretched down alongst his breast, so fresh that they saw at first\nsight that it was made of risp, a sort of long sword-grass that grows\nabout marshes and the sides of lakes. One of the young men seized the\nrope and pulled by it, but the old enchantment of the Devil\nremained--it would not break; and so he pulled and pulled at it, till\nbehold the body came up into a sitting posture, with a broad blue\nbonnet on its head, and its plaid around it, all as fresh as that day\nit was laid in! I never heard of a preservation so wonderful, if it be\ntrue as was related to me, for still I have not had the curiosity to go\nand view the body myself. The features were all so plain that an\nacquaintance might easily have known him. One of the lads gripped the\nface of the corpse with his finger and thumb, and the cheeks felt quite\nsoft and fleshy, but the dimples remained and did not spring out again.\nHe had fine yellow hair, about nine inches long; but not a hair of it\ncould they pull out till they cut part of it off with a knife. They\nalso cut off some portions of his clothes, which were all quite fresh,\nand distributed them among their acquaintances, sending a portion to\nme, among the rest, to keep as natural curiosities. Several gentlemen\nhave in a manner forced me to give them fragments of these enchanted\ngarments: I have, however, retained a small portion for you, which I\nsend along with this, being a piece of his plaid, and another of his\nwaistcoat breast, which you will see are still as fresh as that day\nthey were laid in the grave.\n\n\"His broad blue bonnet was sent to Edinburgh several weeks ago, to the\ngreat regret of some gentlemen connected with the land, who wished to\nhave it for a keep-sake. For my part, fond as I am of blue bonnets, and\nbroad ones in particular, I declare I durst not have worn that one.\nThere was nothing of the silver knife and fork discovered, that I heard\nof, nor was it very likely it should; but it would appear he had been\nvery near run out of cash, which I daresay had been the cause of his\nutter despair; for, on searching his pockets, nothing was found but\nthree old Scotch halfpennies. These young men meeting with another\nshepherd afterwards, his curiosity was so much excited that they went\nand digged up the curious remains a second time, which was a pity, as\nit is likely that by these exposures to the air, and the impossibility\nof burying it up again as closely as it was before, the flesh will now\nfall to dust.\"\n\nThe letter from which the above is an extract, is signed JAMES HOGG,\nand dated from Altrive Lake, August 1st, 1823. It bears the stamp of\nauthenticity in every line; yet so often had I been hoaxed by the\ningenious fancies displayed in that Magazine, that when this relation\nmet my eye I did not believe it; but, from the moment that I perused\nit, I half formed the resolution of investigating these wonderful\nremains personally, if any such existed; for, in the immediate vicinity\nof the scene, as I supposed, I knew of more attractive metal than the\ndilapidated remains of mouldering suicides.\n\nAccordingly, having some business in Edinburgh in September last, and\nbeing obliged to wait a few days for the arrival of a friend from\nLondon, I took that opportunity to pay a visit to my townsman and\nfellow collegian, Mr. L--t of C--d, advocate. I mentioned to him Hogg's\nletter, asking him if the statement was founded at all on truth. His\nanswer was: \"I suppose so. For my part I never doubted the thing,\nhaving been told that there has been a deal of talking about it up in\nthe Forest for some time past. But God knows! Hogg has imposed as\ningenious lies on the public ere now.\"\n\nI said, if it was within reach, I should like exceedingly to visit both\nthe Shepherd and the Scotch mummy he had described. Mr. L--t assented\non the first proposal, saying he had no objections to take a ride that\nlength with me, and make the fellow produce his credentials. That we\nwould have a delightful jaunt through a romantic and now classical\ncountry, and some good sport into the bargain, provided he could\nprocure a horse for me, from his father-in-law, next day. He sent up to\na Mr. L--w to inquire, who returned for answer that there was an\nexcellent pony at my service, and that he himself would accompany us,\nbeing obliged to attend a great sheep-fair at Thirlestane; and that he\nwas certain the Shepherd would be there likewise.\n\nMr. L--t said that was the very man we wanted to make our party\ncomplete; and at an early hour next morning we started for the ewe-fair\nof Thirlestane, taking Blackwood's Magazine for August along with us.\nWe rode through the ancient royal burgh of Selkirk, halted and corned\nour horses at a romantic village, nigh to some deep linns on the\nEttrick, and reached the market ground at Thirlestane-green a little\nbefore mid-day. We soon found Hogg, standing near the foot of the\nmarket, as he called it, beside a great drove of paulies, a species of\nstock that I never heard of before. They were small sheep, striped on\nthe backs with red chalk. Mr. L--t introduced me to him as a great\nwool-stapler, come to raise the price of that article; but he eyed me\nwith distrust, and, turning his back on us, answered: \"I hae sell'd\nmine.\"\n\nI followed, and, shewing him the above-quoted letter, said I was\nexceedingly curious to have a look of these singular remains he had so\ningeniously described; but he only answered me with the remark that \"It\nwas a queer fancy for a wool-stapler to tak.\"\n\nHis two friends then requested him to accompany us to the spot, and to\ntake some of his shepherds with us to assist in raising the body; but\nhe spurned at the idea, saying: \"Od bless ye, lad! I hae ither matters\nto mind. I hae a' thae paulies to sell, an', a' yon Highland stotts\ndown on the green, every ane; an' then I hae ten scores o' yowes to buy\nafter, an', If I canna first sell my ain stock, I canna buy nae ither\nbody's. I hae mair ado than I can manage the day, foreby ganging to\nhouk up hunder-year-auld-banes.\"\n\nFinding that we could make nothing of him, we left him with his\npaulies, Highland stotts, grey jacket, and broad blue bonnet, to go in\nsearch of some other guide. L--w soon found one, for he seemed\nacquainted with every person in the fair. We got a fine old shepherd,\nnamed W--m B--e, a great original, and a very obliging and civil man,\nwho asked no conditions but that we should not speak of it, because he\ndid not wish it to come to his master's ears that he had been engaged\nin sic a profane thing. We promised strict secrecy; and accompanied by\nanother farmer, Mr. S--t, and old B--e, we proceeded to the grave,\nwhich B--e described as about a mile and a half distant from the market\nground.\n\nWe went into the shepherd's cot to get a drink of milk, when I read to\nour guide Mr. Hogg's description, asking him if he thought it correct.\nHe said there was hardly a bit o't correct, for the grave was not on\nthe hill of Cowan's-Croft nor yet on the point where three lairds'\nlands met, but on the top of a hill called the Faw-Law, where there was\nno land that was not the Duke of Buccleuch's within a quarter of a\nmile. He added that it was a wonder how the poet could be mistaken\nthere, who once herded the very ground where the grave is, and saw both\nhills from his own window. Mr. L--w testified great surprise at such a\nsingular blunder, as also how the body came not to be buried at the\nmeeting of three or four lairds' lands, which had always been customary\nin the south of Scotland. Our guide said he had always heard it\nreported that the Eltrive men, with Mr. David Anderson at their head,\nhad risen before day on the Monday morning, it having been on the\nSabbath day that the man put down himself; and that they set out with\nthe intention of burying him on Cowan's-Croft, where the three marches\nmet at a point. But, it having been an invariable rule to bury such\nlost sinners before the rising of the sun, these five men were\novertaken by day-light, as they passed the house of Berry-Knowe; and,\nby the time they reached the top of the Faw-Law, the sun was beginning\nto skair the east. On this they laid down the body, and digged a deep\ngrave with all expedition; but, when they had done, it was too short,\nand, the body being stiff, it would not go down; on which Mr. David\nAnderson, looking to the east and perceiving that the sun would be up\non them in a few minutes, set his foot on the suicide's brow, and\ntramped down his head into the grave with his iron-heeled shoe, until\nthe nose and skull crashed again, and at the same time uttered a\nterrible curse on the wretch who had disgraced the family and given\nthem all this trouble. This anecdote, our guide said, he had heard when\na boy, from the mouth of Robert Laidlaw, one of the five men who buried\nthe body.\n\nWe soon reached the spot, and I confess I felt a singular sensation\nwhen I saw the grey stone standing at the head, and another at the\nfeet, and the one half of the grave manifestly new-digged, and closed\nup again as had been described. I could still scarcely deem the thing\nto be a reality, for the ground did not appear to be wet, but a kind of\ndry rotten moss. On looking around, we found some fragments of clothes,\nsome teeth, and part of a pocket-book, which had not been returned into\nthe grave when the body had been last raised, for it had been twice\nraised before this, but only from the loins upward.\n\nTo work we fell with two spades, and soon cleared away the whole of the\ncovering. The part of the grave that had been opened before was filled\nwith mossy mortar, which impeded us exceedingly, and entirely prevented\na proper investigation of the fore parts of the body. I will describe\neverything as I saw it before our respectable witnesses, whose names I\nshall publish at large if permitted. A number of the bones came up\nseparately; for, with the constant flow of liquid stuff into the deep\ngrave, we could not see to preserve them in their places. At length\ngreat loads of coarse clothes, blanketing, plaiding, etc. appeared; we\ntried to lift these regularly up, and, on doing so, part of a skeleton\ncame up, but no flesh, save a little that was hanging in dark flitters\nabout the spine, but which had no consistence; it was merely the\nappearance of flesh without the substance. The head was wanting, and, I\nbeing very anxious to possess the skull, the search was renewed among\nthe mortar and rags. We first found a part of the scalp, with the long\nhair firm on it; which, on being cleaned, is neither black nor fair,\nbut a darkish dusk, the most common of any other colour. Soon\nafterwards we found the skull, but it was not complete. A spade had\ndamaged it, and one of the temple quarters was wanting. I am no\nphrenologist, not knowing one organ from another, but I thought the\nskull of that wretched man no study. If it was particular for anything,\nit was for a smooth, almost perfect rotundity, with only a little\nprotuberance above the vent of the ear.\n\nWhen we came to that part of the grave that had never been opened\nbefore, the appearance of everything was quite different. There the\nremains lay under a close vault of moss, and within a vacant space; and\nI suppose, by the digging in the former part of the grave, the part had\nbeen deepened, and drawn the moisture away from this part, for here all\nwas perfect. The breeches still suited the thigh, the stocking the leg,\nand the garters were wrapt as neatly and as firm below the knee as if\nthey had been newly tied. The shoes were all open in the seams, the\nhemp having decayed, but the soles, upper leathers and wooden heels,\nwhich were made of birch, were all as fresh as any of those we wore.\nThere was one thing I could not help remarking, that in the inside of\none of the shoes there was a layer of cow's dung, about one-eighth of\nan inch thick, and in the hollow of the sole fully one-fourth of an\ninch. It was firm, green, and fresh; and proved that he had been\nworking in a byre. His clothes were all of a singular ancient cut, and\nno less singular in their texture. Their durability certainly would\nhave been prodigious; for in thickness, coarseness, and strength, I\nnever saw any cloth in the smallest degree to equal them. His coat was\na frock coat, of a yellowish drab colour, with wide sleeves. It is\ntweeled, milled, and thicker than a carpet. I cut off two of the skirts\nand brought them with me. His vest was of striped serge, such as I have\noften seen worn by country people. It was lined and backed with white\nstuff. The breeches were a sort of striped plaiding, which I never saw\nworn, but which our guide assured us was very common in the country\nonce, though, from the old clothes which he had seen remaining of it,\nhe judged that it could not be less than 200 years since it was in\nfashion. His garters were of worsted, and striped with black or blue;\nhis stockings grey, and wanting the feet. I brought samples of all\nalong with me. I have likewise now got possession of the bonnet, which\npuzzles me most of all. It is not conformable with the rest of the\ndress. It is neither a broad bonnet nor a Border bonnet; for there is\nan open behind, for tying, which no genuine Border bonnet I am told\never had. It seems to have been a Highland bonnet, worn in a flat way,\nlike a scone on the crown, such as is sometimes still seen in the West\nof Scotland. All the limbs, from the loins to the toes, seemed perfect\nand entire, but they could not bear handling. Before we got them\nreturned again into the grave they were  shaken to pieces, except the\nthighs, which continued to retain a kind of flabby form.\n\nAll his clothes that were sewed with linen yarn were lying in separate\nportions, the thread having rotten; but such as were sewed with worsted\nremained perfectly firm and sound. Among such a confusion, we had hard\nwork to find out all his pockets, and our guide supposed that, after\nall, we did not find above the half of them. In his vest pocket was a\nlong clasp-knife, very sharp; the haft was thin, and the scales shone\nas if there had been silver inside. Mr. Sc--t took it with him, and\npresented it to his neighbour, Mr. R--n, of W--n L--e, who still has it\nin his possession. We found a comb, a gimblet, a vial, a small neat\nsquare board, a pair of plated knee-buckles, and several samples of\ncloth of different kinds, rolled neatly up within one another. At\nlength, while we were busy on the search, Mr. L--t picked up a leathern\ncase, which seemed to have been wrapped round and round by some ribbon,\nor cord, that had been rotten from it, for the swaddling marks still\nremained. Both L--w and B--e called out that \"it was the tobacco\nspleuchan, and a well-filled ane too\"; but, on opening it out, we\nfound, to our great astonishment, that it contained a printed pamphlet.\nWe were all curious to see what sort of a pamphlet such a person would\nread; what it could contain that he seemed to have had such a care\nabout. For the slough in which it was rolled was fine chamois leather;\nwhat colour it had been could not be known. But the pamphlet was\nwrapped so close together, and so damp, rotten, and yellow that it\nseemed one solid piece. We all concluded from some words that we could\nmake out that it was a religious tract, but that it would be impossible\nto make anything of it. Mr. L--w remarked marked that it was a great\npity if a few sentences could not be made out, for that it was a\nquestion what might be contained in that little book; and then he\nrequested Mr. L--t to give it to me, as he had so many things of\nliterature and law to attend to that he would never think more of it.\nHe replied that either of us were heartily welcome to it, for that he\nhad thought of returning it into the grave, if he could have made out\nbut a line or two, to have seen what was its tendency.\n\n\"Grave, man!\" exclaimed L--w, who speaks excellent strong broad Scotch.\n\"My truly, but ye grave weel! I wad esteem the contents o' that\nspleuchan as the most precious treasure. I'll tell you what it is, sir:\nI hae often wondered how it was that this man's corpse has been\nmiraculously preserved frae decay, a hunder times langer than any other\nbody's, or than ever a tanner's. But now I could wager a guinea it has\nbeen for the preservation o' that little book. And Lord kens what may\nbe in't! It will maybe reveal some mystery that mankind disna ken\nnaething about yet.\"\n\n\"If there be any mysteries in it,\" returned the other, \"it is not for\nyour handling, my dear friend, who are too much taken up about\nmysteries already.\" And with these words he presented the mysterious\npamphlet to me. With very little trouble, save that of a thorough\ndrying, I unrolled it all with ease, and found the very tract which I\nhave here ventured to lay before the public, part of it in small bad\nprint, and the remainder in manuscript. The title page is written and\nis as follows:\n\n  THE PRIVATE MEMOIRS\n  AND CONFESSIONS\n  OF A JUSTIFIED SINNER:\n\n  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF\n\n  Fideli certa merces.\n\nAnd, alongst the head, it is the same as given in the present edition\nof the work. I altered the title to A Self-justified Sinner, but my\nbooksellers did not approve of it; and, there being a curse pronounced\nby the writer on him that should dare to alter or amend, I have let it\nstand as it is. Should it be thought to attach discredit to any\nreceived principle of our Church, I am blameless. The printed part ends\nat page 201 and the rest is in a fine old hand, extremely small and\nclose. I have ordered the printer to procure a facsimile of it, to be\nbound in with the volume. [v. Frontispiece.]\n\nWith regard to the work itself, I dare not venture a judgment, for I do\nnot understand it. I believe no person, man or woman, will ever peruse\nit with the same attention that I have done, and yet I confess that I\ndo not comprehend the writer's drift. It is certainly impossible that\nthese scenes could ever have occurred that he describes as having\nhimself transacted. I think it may be possible that he had some hand in\nthe death of his brother, and yet I am disposed greatly to doubt it;\nand the numerous traditions, etc. which remain of that event may be\nattributable to the work having been printed and burnt, and of course\nthe story known to all the printers, with their families and gossips.\nThat the young Laird of Dalcastle came by a violent death, there\nremains no doubt; but that this wretch slew him, there is to me a good\ndeal. However, allowing this to have been the case, I account all the\nrest either dreaming or madness; or, as he says to Mr. Watson, a\nreligious parable, on purpose to illustrate something scarcely\ntangible, but to which he seems to have attached great weight. Were the\nrelation at all consistent with reason, it corresponds so minutely with\ntraditionary facts that it could scarcely have missed to have been\nreceived as authentic; but in this day, and with the present\ngeneration, it will not go down that a man should be daily tempted by\nthe Devil, in the semblance of a fellow-creature; and at length lured\nto self-destruction, in the hopes that this same fiend and tormentor\nwas to suffer and fall along with him. It was a bold theme for an\nallegory, and would have suited that age well had it been taken up by\none fully qualified for the task, which this writer was not. In short,\nwe must either conceive him not only the greatest fool, but the\ngreatest wretch, on whom was ever stamped the form of humanity; or,\nthat he was a religious maniac, who wrote and wrote about a deluded\ncreature, till he arrived at that height of madness that he believed\nhimself the very object whom he had been all along describing. And, in\norder to escape from an ideal tormentor, committed that act for which,\naccording to the tenets he embraced, there was no remission, and which\nconsigned his memory and his name to everlasting detestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Private Memoirs and Confessions of\na Justified Sinner, by James Hogg\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIVATE MEMOIRS OF JUSTIFIED SINNER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2276.txt or 2276.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/2\/7\/2276\/\n\nProduced by Andreas Philipp and Martin Adamson.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":61,"split":"train"}
