{"ori_id":"39fcd8f28d3cf91de459a71953a9ecaaea9f82b5","title":"Manalive","context":"Manalive\n This is a book in two parts. The first, \"The Enigma of Innocent Smith\", concerns the arrival of a new tenant at Beacon House, a London boarding establishment. Like Mary Poppins, this man (who is tentatively identified by lodger Arthur Inglewood as an ex-schoolmate named Innocent Smith) is accompanied by a great wind, and he breathes new life into the household with his games and antics. During his first day in residence the eccentric Smith creates the High Court of Beacon; arranges to elope with Mary Gray, paid companion to heiress Rosamund Hunt; inspires Inglewood to declare his love for Diana Duke, the landlady's niece; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist Michael Moon and Rosamund.\nHowever, when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news: Smith is wanted on charges of burglary, desertion of a spouse, polygamy, and attempted murder. The fact that Smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at Inglewood's friend Dr. Herbert Warner seems to confirm the worst. Before Smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum, Michael Moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the High Court of Beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press.\nThe second part, \"The Explanations of Innocent Smith\", follows the trial. The prosecution consists of Moses Gould, a merrily cynical Jew who lives at Beacon House and considers Smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel, and Dr. Cyrus Pym, an American criminal specialist called in by Dr. Warner; Michael Moon and Arthur Inglewood act for the defence. The evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against Smith. In every case, the defendant is revealed to be, as his first name states, innocent. He fires bullets near people to make them value life; the house he breaks into is his own; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife Mary, posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re-enact their courtship.\nSmith is, needless to say, acquitted on all charges.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Manalive, by G.

In a million holes\nand corners it refreshed a man like a flagon, and astonished him\nlike a blow.  In the inmost chambers of intricate and embowered\nhouses it woke like a domestic explosion, littering the floor with\nsome professor's papers till they seemed as precious as fugitive,\nor blowing out the candle by which a boy read \"Treasure Island\"\nand wrapping him in roaring dark.  But everywhere it bore drama into\nundramatic lives, and carried the trump of crisis across the world.\nMany a harassed mother in a mean backyard had looked at five\ndwarfish shirts on the clothes-line as at some small, sick tragedy;\nit was as if she had hanged her five children.  The wind came, and they\nwere full and kicking as if five fat imps had sprung into them; and far\ndown in her oppressed subconscious she half-remembered those coarse\ncomedies of her fathers when the elves still dwelt in the homes of men.\nMany an unnoticed girl in a dank walled garden had tossed herself\ninto the hammock with the same intolerant gesture with which she\nmight have tossed herself into the Thames; and that wind rent\nthe waving wall of woods and lifted the hammock like a balloon,\nand showed her shapes of quaint clouds far beyond, and pictures\nof bright villages far below, as if she rode heaven in a fairy boat.\nMany a dusty clerk or cleric, plodding a telescopic road of poplars,\nthought for the hundredth time that they were like the plumes\nof a hearse; when this invisible energy caught and swung and clashed\nthem round his head like a wreath or salutation of seraphic wings.\nThere was in it something more inspired and authoritative even\nthan the old wind of the proverb; for this was the good wind\nthat blows nobody harm.\n\nThe flying blast struck London just where it scales the northern heights,\nterrace above terrace, as precipitous as Edinburgh.  It was round\nabout this place that some poet, probably drunk, looked up astonished\nat all those streets gone skywards, and (thinking vaguely of glaciers\nand roped mountaineers) gave it the name of Swiss Cottage, which it has\nnever been able to shake off.  At some stage of those heights a terrace\nof tall gray houses, mostly empty and almost as desolate as the Grampians,\ncurved round at the western end, so that the last building, a boarding\nestablishment called \"Beacon House,\" offered abruptly to the sunset its high,\nnarrow and towering termination, like the prow of some deserted ship.\n\nThe ship, however, was not wholly deserted.  The proprietor\nof the boarding-house, a Mrs. Duke, was one of those helpless\npersons against whom fate wars in vain; she smiled vaguely both\nbefore and after all her calamities; she was too soft to be hurt.\nBut by the aid (or rather under the orders) of a strenuous niece\nshe always kept the remains of a clientele, mostly of young\nbut listless folks.  And there were actually five inmates\nstanding disconsolately about the garden when the great gale\nbroke at the base of the terminal tower behind them, as the sea\nbursts against the base of an outstanding cliff.\n\nAll day that hill of houses over London had been domed and sealed up with\ncold cloud.  Yet three men and two girls had at last found even the gray\nand chilly garden more tolerable than the black and cheerless interior.\nWhen the wind came it split the sky and shouldered the cloudland left\nand right, unbarring great clear furnaces of evening gold.  The burst of light\nreleased and the burst of air blowing seemed to come almost simultaneously;\nand the wind especially caught everything in a throttling violence.\nThe bright short grass lay all one way like brushed hair.\nEvery shrub in the garden tugged at its roots like a dog at the collar,\nand strained every leaping leaf after the hunting and exterminating element.\nNow and again a twig would snap and fly like a bolt from an arbalist.\nThe three men stood stiffly and aslant against the wind, as if leaning against\na wall.  The two ladies disappeared into the house; rather, to speak truly,\nthey were blown into the house.  Their two frocks, blue and white,\nlooked like two big broken flowers, driving and drifting upon the gale.\nNor is such a poetic fancy inappropriate, for there was something\noddly romantic about this inrush of air and light after a long,\nleaden and unlifting day.  Grass and garden trees seemed glittering\nwith something at once good and unnatural, like a fire from fairyland.\nIt seemed like a strange sunrise at the wrong end of the day.\n\nThe girl in white dived in quickly enough, for she wore\na white hat of the proportions of a parachute, which might\nhave wafted her away into the coloured clouds of evening.\nShe was their one splash of splendour, and irradiated wealth\nin that impecunious place (staying there temporarily with a\nfriend), an heiress in a small way, by name Rosamund Hunt,\nbrown-eyed, round-faced, but resolute and rather boisterous.\nOn top of her wealth she was good-humoured and rather good-looking;\nbut she had not married, perhaps because there was always\na crowd of men around her.  She was not fast (though some\nmight have called her vulgar), but she gave irresolute youths\nan impression of being at once popular and inaccessible.\nA man felt as if he had fallen in love with Cleopatra,\nor as if he were asking for a great actress at the stage door.\nIndeed, some theatrical spangles seemed to cling about Miss Hunt;\nshe played the guitar and the mandoline; she always wanted charades;\nand with that great rending of the sky by sun and storm,\nshe felt a girlish melodrama swell again within her.\nTo the crashing orchestration of the air the clouds rose\nlike the curtain of some long-expected pantomime.\n\nNor, oddly, was the girl in blue entirely unimpressed by this\napocalypse in a private garden; though she was one of most prosaic\nand practical creatures alive.  She was, indeed, no other than\nthe strenuous niece whose strength alone upheld that mansion of decay.\nBut as the gale swung and swelled the blue and white skirts till they\ntook on the monstrous contours of Victorian crinolines, a sunken memory\nstirred in her that was almost romance--a memory of a dusty volume\nof _Punch_ in an aunt's house in infancy:  pictures of crinoline hoops\nand croquet hoops and some pretty story, of which perhaps they were a part.\nThis half-perceptible fragrance in her thoughts faded almost instantly,\nand Diana Duke entered the house even more promptly than her companion.\nTall, slim, aquiline, and dark, she seemed made for such swiftness.\nIn body she was of the breed of those birds and beasts that are at once\nlong and alert, like greyhounds or herons or even like an innocent snake.\nThe whole house revolved on her as on a rod of steel.  It would\nbe wrong to say that she commanded; for her own efficiency was so\nimpatient that she obeyed herself before any one else obeyed her.\nBefore electricians could mend a bell or locksmiths open a door,\nbefore dentists could pluck a tooth or butlers draw a tight cork,\nit was done already with the silent violence of her slim hands.\nShe was light; but there was nothing leaping about her lightness.\nShe spurned the ground, and she meant to spurn it.  People talk\nof the pathos and failure of plain women; but it is a more terrible\nthing that a beautiful woman may succeed in everything but womanhood.\n\n\"It's enough to blow your head off,\" said the young woman in white,\ngoing to the looking-glass.\n\nThe young woman in blue made no reply, but put away her gardening gloves,\nand then went to the sideboard and began to spread out an afternoon\ncloth for tea.\n\n\"Enough to blow your head off, I say,\" said Miss Rosamund Hunt,\nwith the unruffled cheeriness of one whose songs and speeches\nhad always been safe for an encore.\n\n\"Only your hat, I think,\" said Diana Duke, \"but I dare say that is\nsometimes more important.\"\n\nRosamund's face showed for an instant the offence of a\nspoilt child, and then the humour of a very healthy person.\nShe broke into a laugh and said, \"Well, it would have to be a big\nwind to blow your head off.\"\n\nThere was another silence; and the sunset breaking more and more from\nthe sundering clouds, filled the room with soft fire and painted the dull\nwalls with ruby and gold.\n\n\"Somebody once told me,\" said Rosamund Hunt, \"that it's easier\nto keep one's head when one has lost one's heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't talk such rubbish,\" said Diana with savage sharpness.\n\nOutside, the garden was clad in a golden splendour;\nbut the wind was still stiffly blowing, and the three men\nwho stood their ground might also have considered the problem\nof hats and heads.  And, indeed, their position, touching hats,\nwas somewhat typical of them.  The tallest of the three abode\nthe blast in a high silk hat, which the wind seemed to charge\nas vainly as that other sullen tower, the house behind him.\nThe second man tried to hold on a stiff straw hat at all angles,\nand ultimately held it in his hand.  The third had no hat, and,\nby his attitude, seemed never to have had one in his life.\nPerhaps this wind was a kind of fairy wand to test men and women,\nfor there was much of the three men in this difference.\n\nThe man in the solid silk hat was the embodiment of silkiness and solidity.\nHe was a big, bland, bored and (as some said) boring man, with flat\nfair hair and handsome heavy features; a prosperous young doctor\nby the name of Warner.  But if his blondness and blandness seemed\nat first a little fatuous, it is certain that he was no fool.\nIf Rosamund Hunt was the only person there with much money,\nhe was the only person who had as yet found any kind of fame.\nHis treatise on \"The Probable Existence of Pain in the Lowest Organisms\"\nhad been universally hailed by the scientific world as at once solid\nand daring.  In short, he undoubtedly had brains; and perhaps it was\nnot his fault if they were the kind of brains that most men desire\nto analyze with a poker.\n\nThe young man who put his hat off and on was a scientific amateur in a\nsmall way, and worshipped the great Warner with a solemn freshness.\nIt was, in fact, at his invitation that the distinguished doctor\nwas present; for Warner lived in no such ramshackle lodging-house,\nbut in a professional palace in Harley Street.  This young\nman was really the youngest and best-looking of the three.\nBut he was one of those persons, both male and female,\nwho seem doomed to be good-looking and insignificant.\nBrown-haired, high-coloured, and shy, he seemed to lose\nthe delicacy of his features in a sort of blur of brown\nand red as he stood blushing and blinking against the wind.\nHe was one of those obvious unnoticeable people:\nevery one knew that he was Arthur Inglewood, unmarried, moral,\ndecidedly intelligent, living on a little money of his own,\nand hiding himself in the two hobbies of photography and cycling.\nEverybody knew him and forgot him; even as he stood there in the\nglare of golden sunset there was something about him indistinct,\nlike one of his own red-brown amateur photographs.\n\nThe third man had no hat; he was lean, in light, vaguely\nsporting clothes, and the large pipe in his mouth made him look\nall the leaner.  He had a long ironical face, blue-black hair,\nthe blue eyes of an Irishman, and the blue chin of an actor.\nAn Irishman he was, an actor he was not, except in the old\ndays of Miss Hunt's charades, being, as a matter of fact,\nan obscure and flippant journalist named Michael Moon.  He had\nonce been hazily supposed to be reading for the Bar;\nbut (as Warner would say with his rather elephantine wit)\nit was mostly at another kind of bar that his friends found him.\nMoon, however, did not drink, nor even frequently get drunk;\nhe simply was a gentleman who liked low company.\nThis was partly because company is quieter than society:\nand if he enjoyed talking to a barmaid (as apparently\nhe did), it was chiefly because the barmaid did the talking.\nMoreover he would often bring other talent to assist her.\nHe shared that strange trick of all men of his type, intellectual and\nwithout ambition--the trick of going about with his mental inferiors.\nThere was a small resilient Jew named Moses Gould in the same\nboarding-house, a man whose negro vitality and vulgarity amused\nMichael so much that he went round with him from bar to bar,\nlike the owner of a performing monkey.\n\nThe colossal clearance which the wind had made of that cloudy sky grew\nclearer and clearer; chamber within chamber seemed to open in heaven.\nOne felt one might at last find something lighter than light.\nIn the fullness of this silent effulgence all things collected their\ncolours again:  the gray trunks turned silver, and the drab gravel gold.\nOne bird fluttered like a loosened leaf from one tree to another,\nand his brown feathers were brushed with fire.\n\n\"Inglewood,\" said Michael Moon, with his blue eye on the bird,\n\"have you any friends?\"\n\nDr. Warner mistook the person addressed, and turning a broad\nbeaming face, said,--\n\n\"Oh yes, I go out a great deal.\"\n\nMichael Moon gave a tragic grin, and waited for his real informant,\nwho spoke a moment after in a voice curiously cool, fresh and young,\nas coming out of that brown and even dusty interior.\n\n\"Really,\" answered Inglewood, \"I'm afraid I've lost touch with\nmy old friends.  The greatest friend I ever had was at school,\na fellow named Smith.  It's odd you should mention it, because I\nwas thinking of him to-day, though I haven't seen him for seven\nor eight years.  He was on the science side with me at school--\na clever fellow though queer; and he went up to Oxford when I\nwent to Germany.  The fact is, it's rather a sad story.\nI often asked him to come and see me, and when I heard nothing I\nmade inquiries, you know.  I was shocked to learn that poor Smith\nhad gone off his head.  The accounts were a bit cloudy, of course,\nsome saying that he had recovered again; but they always say that.\nAbout a year ago I got a telegram from him myself.  The telegram,\nI'm sorry to say, put the matter beyond a doubt.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" assented Dr. Warner stolidly; \"insanity is generally incurable.\"\n\n\"So is sanity,\" said the Irishman, and studied him with a dreary eye.\n\n\"Symptoms?\" asked the doctor.  \"What was this telegram?\"\n\n\"It's a shame to joke about such things,\" said Inglewood, in his honest,\nembarrassed way; \"the telegram was Smith's illness, not Smith.  The actual\nwords were, `Man found alive with two legs.'\"\n\n\"Alive with two legs,\" repeated Michael, frowning.  \"Perhaps a version\nof alive and kicking?  I don't know much about people out of their senses;\nbut I suppose they ought to be kicking.\"\n\n\"And people in their senses?\" asked Warner, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, they ought to be kicked,\" said Michael with sudden heartiness.\n\n\"The message is clearly insane,\" continued the impenetrable Warner.\n\"The best test is a reference to the undeveloped normal type.\nEven a baby does not expect to find a man with three legs.\"\n\n\"Three legs,\" said Michael Moon, \"would be very convenient in this wind.\"\n\nA fresh eruption of the atmosphere had indeed almost thrown them\noff their balance and broken the blackened trees in the garden.\nBeyond, all sorts of accidental objects could be seen scouring\nthe wind-scoured sky--straws, sticks, rags, papers, and, in the distance,\na disappearing hat.  Its disappearance, however, was not final;\nafter an interval of minutes they saw it again, much larger and closer,\nlike a white panama, towering up into the heavens like a balloon,\nstaggering to and fro for an instant like a stricken kite,\nand then settling in the centre of their own lawn as falteringly\nas a fallen leaf.\n\n\"Somebody's lost a good hat,\" said Dr. Warner shortly.\n\nAlmost as he spoke, another object came over the garden wall,\nflying after the fluttering panama.  It was a big green umbrella.\nAfter that came hurtling a huge yellow Gladstone bag,\nand after that came a figure like a flying wheel of legs,\nas in the shield of the Isle of Man.\n\nBut though for a flash it seemed to have five or six legs,\nit alighted upon two, like the man in the queer telegram.\nIt took the form of a large light-haired man in gay green holiday clothes.\nHe had bright blonde hair that the wind brushed back like a German's,\na flushed eager face like a cherub's, and a prominent pointing nose,\na little like a dog's. His head, however, was by no means cherubic\nin the sense of being without a body.  On the contrary, on his vast\nshoulders and shape generally gigantesque, his head looked oddly\nand unnaturally small.  This gave rise to a scientific theory\n(which his conduct fully supported) that he was an idiot.\n\nInglewood had a politeness instinctive and yet awkward.\nHis life was full of arrested half gestures of assistance.\nAnd even this prodigy of a big man in green, leaping the wall\nlike a bright green grasshopper, did not paralyze that small\naltruism of his habits in such a matter as a lost hat.\nHe was stepping forward to recover the green gentleman's\nhead-gear, when he was struck rigid with a roar like a bull's.\n\n\"Unsportsmanlike!\" bellowed the big man.  \"Give it fair play,\ngive it fair play!\"  And he came after his own hat quickly\nbut cautiously, with burning eyes.  The hat had seemed at first\nto droop and dawdle as in ostentatious langour on the sunny lawn;\nbut the wind again freshening and rising, it went dancing down\nthe garden with the devilry of a ~pas de quatre~. The eccentric went\nbounding after it with kangaroo leaps and bursts of breathless speech,\nof which it was not always easy to pick up the thread:\n\"Fair play, fair play... sport of kings... chase their crowns...\nquite humane... tramontana... cardinals chase red hats... old\nEnglish hunting... started a hat in Bramber Combe... hat at bay...\nmangled hounds... Got him!\"\n\nAs the wind rose out of a roar into a shriek, he leapt into the sky\non his strong, fantastic legs, snatched at the vanishing hat,\nmissed it, and pitched sprawling face foremost on the grass.\nThe hat rose over him like a bird in triumph.  But its triumph\nwas premature; for the lunatic, flung forward on his hands,\nthrew up his boots behind, waved his two legs in the air\nlike symbolic ensigns (so that they actually thought again\nof the telegram), and actually caught the hat with his feet.\nA prolonged and piercing yell of wind split the welkin from end to end.\nThe eyes of all the men were blinded by the invisible blast,\nas by a strange, clear cataract of transparency rushing between\nthem and all objects about them.  But as the large man fell back\nin a sitting posture and solemnly crowned himself with the hat,\nMichael found, to his incredulous surprise, that he had been\nholding his breath, like a man watching a duel.\n\nWhile that tall wind was at the top of its sky-scraping energy,\nanother short cry was heard, beginning very querulous, but ending\nvery quick, swallowed in abrupt silence.  The shiny black cylinder\nof Dr. Warner's official hat sailed off his head in the long,\nsmooth parabola of an airship, and in almost cresting a garden\ntree was caught in the topmost branches.  Another hat was gone.\nThose in that garden felt themselves caught in an unaccustomed eddy\nof things happening; no one seemed to know what would blow away next.\nBefore they could speculate, the cheering and hallooing hat-hunter\nwas already halfway up the tree, swinging himself from fork to fork\nwith his strong, bent, grasshopper legs, and still giving forth\nhis gasping, mysterious comments.\n\n\"Tree of life... Ygdrasil... climb for centuries perhaps... owls nesting\nin the hat... remotest generations of owls... still usurpers... gone\nto heaven... man in the moon wears it... brigand... not yours... belongs\nto depressed medical man... in garden... give it up... give it up!\"\n\nThe tree swung and swept and thrashed to and fro in the thundering\nwind like a thistle, and flamed in the full sunshine like a bonfire.\nThe green, fantastic human figure, vivid against its autumn red and gold,\nwas already among its highest and craziest branches, which by bare luck did\nnot break with the weight of his big body.  He was up there among the last\ntossing leaves and the first twinkling stars of evening, still talking\nto himself cheerfully, reasoningly, half apologetically, in little gasps.\nHe might well be out of breath, for his whole preposterous raid had\ngone with one rush; he had bounded the wall once like a football,\nswept down the garden like a slide, and shot up the tree like a rocket.\nThe other three men seemed buried under incident piled on incident--\na wild world where one thing began before another thing left off.\nAll three had the first thought.  The tree had been there for the five years\nthey had known the boarding-house. Each one of them was active and strong.\nNo one of them had even thought of climbing it.  Beyond that,\nInglewood felt first the mere fact of colour.  The bright brisk leaves,\nthe bleak blue sky, the wild green arms and legs, reminded him irrationally\nof something glowing in his infancy, something akin to a gaudy man\non a golden tree; perhaps it was only painted monkey on a stick.\nOddly enough, Michael Moon, though more of a humourist, was touched on\na tenderer nerve, half remembered the old, young theatricals with Rosamund,\nand was amused to find himself almost quoting Shakespeare--\n\n        \"For valour.  Is not love a Hercules,\n         Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?\"\n\n\nEven the immovable man of science had a bright, bewildered sensation\nthat the Time Machine had given a great jerk, and gone forward\nwith rather rattling rapidity.\n\nHe was not, however, wholly prepared for what happened next.\nThe man in green, riding the frail topmost bough like a witch on a very risky\nbroomstick, reached up and rent the black hat from its airy nest of twigs.\nIt had been broken across a heavy bough in the first burst of its passage,\na tangle of branches in torn and scored and scratched it in every direction,\na clap of wind and foliage had flattened it like a concertina; nor can it\nbe said that the obliging gentleman with the sharp nose showed any adequate\ntenderness for its structure when he finally unhooked it from its place.\nWhen he had found it, however, his proceedings were by some counted singular.\nHe waved it with a loud whoop of triumph, and then immediately appeared\nto fall backwards off the tree, to which, however, he remained\nattached by his long strong legs, like a monkey swung by his tail.\nHanging thus head downwards above the unhelmed Warner, he gravely proceeded\nto drop the battered silk cylinder upon his brows.  \"Every man a king,\"\nexplained the inverted philosopher, \"every hat (consequently) a crown.\nBut this is a crown out of heaven.\"\n\nAnd he again attempted the coronation of Warner, who, however, moved away\nwith great abruptness from the hovering diadem; not seeming, strangely enough,\nto wish for his former decoration in its present state.\n\n\"Wrong, wrong!\" cried the obliging person hilariously.\n\"Always wear uniform, even if it's shabby uniform!\nRitualists may always be untidy.  Go to a dance with soot on\nyour shirt-front; but go with a shirt-front. Huntsman wears old coat,\nbut old pink coat.  Wear a topper, even if it's got no top.\nIt's the symbol that counts, old cock.  Take your hat,\nbecause it is your hat after all; its nap rubbed all off\nby the bark, dears, and its brim not the least bit curled;\nbut for old sakes' sake it is still, dears, the nobbiest tile\nin the world.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, with a wild comfortableness, he settled or smashed\nthe shapeless silk hat over the face of the disturbed physician,\nand fell on his feet among the other men, still talking,\nbeaming and breathless.\n\n\"Why don't they make more games out of wind?\" he asked in some excitement.\n\"Kites are all right, but why should it only be kites?  Why, I thought\nof three other games for a windy day while I was climbing that tree.\nHere's one of them:  you take a lot of pepper--\"\n\n\"I think,\" interposed Moon, with a sardonic mildness,\n\"that your games are already sufficiently interesting.\nAre you, may I ask, a professional acrobat on a tour,\nor a travelling advertisement of Sunny Jim?  How and why do you\ndisplay all this energy for clearing walls and climbing trees\nin our melancholy, but at least rational, suburbs?\"\n\nThe stranger, so far as so loud a person was capable of it,\nappeared to grow confidential.\n\n\"Well, it's a trick of my own,\" he confessed candidly.\n\"I do it by having two legs.\"\n\nArthur Inglewood, who had sunk into the background of this scene of folly,\nstarted and stared at the newcomer with his short-sighted eyes screwed up\nand his high colour slightly heightened.\n\n\"Why, I believe you're Smith,\" he cried with his fresh, almost boyish voice;\nand then after an instant's stare, \"and yet I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"I have a card, I think,\" said the unknown, with baffling solemnity--\"a card\nwith my real name, my titles, offices, and true purpose on this earth.\"\n\nHe drew out slowly from an upper waistcoat pocket a scarlet\ncard-case, and as slowly produced a very large card.\nEven in the instant of its production, they fancied it was\nof a queer shape, unlike the cards of ordinary gentlemen.\nBut it was there only for an instant; for as it passed from\nhis fingers to Arthur's, one or another slipped his hold.\nThe strident, tearing gale in that garden carried away\nthe stranger's card to join the wild waste paper of the universe;\nand that great western wind shook the whole house and passed.\n\n\n\n\n                         Chapter II\n\n                 The Luggage of an Optimist\n\n\nWe all remember the fairy tales of science in our infancy, which played\nwith the supposition that large animals could jump in the proportion\nof small ones.  If an elephant were as strong as a grasshopper, he could\n(I suppose) spring clean out of the Zoological Gardens and alight\ntrumpeting upon Primrose Hill.  If a whale could leap from the sea\nlike a trout, perhaps men might look up and see one soaring above\nYarmouth like the winged island of Laputa.  Such natural energy,\nthough sublime, might certainly be inconvenient, and much of this\ninconvenience attended the gaiety and good intentions of the man in green.\nHe was too large for everything, because he was lively as well as large.\nBy a fortunate physical provision, most very substantial creatures\nare also reposeful; and middle-class boarding-houses in the lesser\nparts of London are not built for a man as big as a bull and excitable\nas a kitten.\n\nWhen Inglewood followed the stranger into the boarding-house,\nhe found him talking earnestly (and in his own opinion privately)\nto the helpless Mrs. Duke.  That fat, faint lady could only\ngoggle up like a dying fish at the enormous new gentleman,\nwho politely offered himself as a lodger, with vast gestures\nof the wide white hat in one hand, and the yellow Gladstone bag\nin the other.  Fortunately, Mrs. Duke's more efficient niece\nand partner was there to complete the contract; for, indeed,\nall the people of the house had somehow collected in the room.\nThis fact, in truth, was typical of the whole episode.\nThe visitor created an atmosphere of comic crisis; and from\nthe time he came into the house to the time he left it, he somehow\ngot the company to gather and even follow (though in derision)\nas children gather and follow a Punch and Judy.  An hour ago,\nand for four years previously, these people had avoided\neach other, even when they had really liked each other.\nThey had slid in and out of dismal and deserted rooms in search\nof particular newspapers or private needlework.  Even now they\nall came casually, as with varying interests; but they all came.\nThere was the embarrassed Inglewood, still a sort of red shadow;\nthere was the unembarrassed Warner, a pallid but solid substance.\nThere was Michael Moon offering like a riddle the contrast\nof the horsy crudeness of his clothes and the sombre sagacity\nof his visage.  He was now joined by his yet more comic crony,\nMoses Gould.  Swaggering on short legs with a prosperous\npurple tie, he was the gayest of godless little dogs;\nbut like a dog also in this, that however he danced and\nwagged with delight, the two dark eyes on each side of his\nprotuberant nose glistened gloomily like black buttons.\nThere was Miss Rosamund Hunt, still with the fine white hat\nframing her square, good-looking face, and still with her native\nair of being dressed for some party that never came off.\nShe also, like Mr. Moon, had a new companion, new so far as this\nnarrative goes, but in reality an old friend and a protegee.\nThis was a slight young woman in dark gray, and in no way\nnotable but for a load of dull red hair, of which the shape\nsomehow gave her pale face that triangular, almost peaked,\nappearance which was given by the lowering headdress and deep rich\nruff of the Elizabethan beauties.  Her surname seemed to be Gray,\nand Miss Hunt called her Mary, in that indescribable tone\napplied to a dependent who has practically become a friend.\nShe wore a small silver cross on her very business-like\ngray clothes, and was the only member of the party who went\nto church.  Last, but the reverse of least, there was Diana Duke,\nstudying the newcomer with eyes of steel, and listening\ncarefully to every idiotic word he said.  As for Mrs. Duke,\nshe smiled up at him, but never dreamed of listening to him.\nShe had never really listened to any one in her life; which, some said,\nwas why she had survived.\n\nNevertheless, Mrs. Duke was pleased with her new guest's\nconcentration of courtesy upon herself; for no one ever spoke\nseriously to her any more than she listened seriously to any one.\nAnd she almost beamed as the stranger, with yet wider and almost\nwhirling gestures of explanation with his huge hat and bag,\napologized for having entered by the wall instead of the front door.\nHe was understood to put it down to an unfortunate family tradition\nof neatness and care of his clothes.\n\n\"My mother was rather strict about it, to tell the truth,\"\nhe said, lowering his voice, to Mrs. Duke.  \"She never liked\nme to lose my cap at school.  And when a man's been taught\nto be tidy and neat it sticks to him.\"\n\nMrs. Duke weakly gasped that she was sure he must have had a good mother;\nbut her niece seemed inclined to probe the matter further.\n\n\"You've got a funny idea of neatness,\" she said, \"if it's\njumping garden walls and clambering up garden trees.\nA man can't very well climb a tree tidily.\"\n\n\"He can clear a wall neatly,\" said Michael Moon; \"I saw him do it.\"\n\nSmith seemed to be regarding the girl with genuine astonishment.\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, \"I was tidying the tree.  You don't want\nlast year's hats there, do you, any more than last year's leaves?\nThe wind takes off the leaves, but it couldn't manage the hat; that wind,\nI suppose, has tidied whole forests to-day. Rum idea this is, that tidiness\nis a timid, quiet sort of thing; why, tidiness is a toil for giants.\nYou can't tidy anything without untidying yourself; just look at my trousers.\nDon't you know that?  Haven't you ever had a spring cleaning?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Duke, almost eagerly.  \"You will find\neverything of that sort quite nice.\"  For the first time she\nhad heard two words that she could understand.\n\nMiss Diana Duke seemed to be studying the stranger with a sort of spasm\nof calculation; then her black eyes snapped with decision, and she said\nthat he could have a particular bedroom on the top floor if he liked:\nand the silent and sensitive Inglewood, who had been on the rack through\nthese cross-purposes, eagerly offered to show him up to the room.\nSmith went up the stairs four at a time, and when he bumped his head\nagainst the ultimate ceiling, Inglewood had an odd sensation that the tall\nhouse was much shorter than it used to be.\n\nArthur Inglewood followed his old friend--or his new friend,\nfor he did not very clearly know which he was.  The face looked\nvery like his old schoolfellow's at one second and very unlike\nat another.  And when Inglewood broke through his native\npoliteness so far as to say suddenly, \"Is your name Smith?\"\nhe received only the unenlightening reply, \"Quite right;\nquite right.  Very good.  Excellent!\"  Which appeared to Inglewood,\non reflection, rather the speech of a new-born babe accepting\na name than of a grown-up man admitting one.\n\nDespite these doubts about identity, the hapless Inglewood\nwatched the other unpack, and stood about his bedroom in all\nthe impotent attitudes of the male friend.  Mr. Smith unpacked\nwith the same kind of whirling accuracy with which he climbed\na tree--throwing things out of his bag as if they were rubbish,\nyet managing to distribute quite a regular pattern all round\nhim on the floor.\n\nAs he did so he continued to talk in the same somewhat gasping manner\n(he had come upstairs four steps at a time, but even without this his style\nof speech was breathless and fragmentary), and his remarks were still\na string of more or less significant but often separate pictures.\n\n\"Like the day of judgement,\" he said, throwing a bottle\nso that it somehow settled, rocking on its right end.\n\"People say vast universe... infinity and astronomy;\nnot sure... I think things are too close together... packed up;\nfor travelling... stars too close, really... why, the sun's\na star, too close to be seen properly; the earth's a star,\ntoo close to be seen at all... too many pebbles on the beach;\nought all to be put in rings; too many blades of grass to study...\nfeathers on a bird make the brain reel; wait till the big bag\nis unpacked... may all be put in our right places then.\"\n\nHere he stopped, literally for breath--throwing a shirt to the other end\nof the room, and then a bottle of ink so that it fell quite neatly beyond it.\nInglewood looked round on this strange, half-symmetrical disorder with\nan increasing doubt.\n\nIn fact, the more one explored Mr. Smith's holiday luggage,\nthe less one could make anything of it.  One peculiarity of it\nwas that almost everything seemed to be there for the wrong reason;\nwhat is secondary with every one else was primary with him.\nHe would wrap up a pot or pan in brown paper; and the unthinking\nassistant would discover that the pot was valueless or even unnecessary,\nand that it was the brown paper that was truly precious.\nHe produced two or three boxes of cigars, and explained\nwith plain and perplexing sincerity that he was no smoker,\nbut that cigar-box wood was by far the best for fretwork.\nHe also exhibited about six small bottles of wine, white and red,\nand Inglewood, happening to note a Volnay which he knew to be excellent,\nsupposed at first that the stranger was an epicure in vintages.\nHe was therefore surprised to find that the next bottle was a vile sham\nclaret from the colonies, which even colonials (to do them justice)\ndo not drink.  It was only then that he observed that all six\nbottles had those bright metallic seals of various tints,\nand seemed to have been chosen solely because they have the three\nprimary and three secondary colours:  red, blue, and yellow;\ngreen, violet and orange.  There grew upon Inglewood an almost\ncreepy sense of the real childishness of this creature.\nFor Smith was really, so far as human psychology can be, innocent.\nHe had the sensualities of innocence:  he loved the stickiness of gum,\nand he cut white wood greedily as if he were cutting a cake.\nTo this man wine was not a doubtful thing to be defended or denounced;\nit was a quaintly coloured syrup, such as a child sees in a shop window.\nHe talked dominantly and rushed the social situation;\nbut he was not asserting himself, like a superman in a modern play.\nHe was simply forgetting himself, like a little boy at a party.\nHe had somehow made the giant stride from babyhood to manhood,\nand missed that crisis in youth when most of us grow old.\n\nAs he shunted his big bag, Arthur observed the initials\nI. S. printed on one side of it, and remembered that Smith had\nbeen called Innocent Smith at school, though whether as a formal\nChristian name or a moral description he could not remember.\nHe was just about to venture another question, when there was a knock\nat the door, and the short figure of Mr. Gould offered itself,\nwith the melancholy Moon, standing like his tall crooked shadow,\nbehind him.  They had drifted up the stairs after the other two\nmen with the wandering gregariousness of the male.\n\n\"Hope there's no intrusion,\" said the beaming Moses with a glow\nof good nature, but not the airiest tinge of apology.\n\n\"The truth is,\" said Michael Moon with comparative courtesy,\n\"we thought we might see if they had made you comfortable.\nMiss Duke is rather--\"\n\n\"I know,\" cried the stranger, looking up radiantly from his bag;\n\"magnificent, isn't she?  Go close to her--hear military music going by,\nlike Joan of Arc.\"\n\nInglewood stared and stared at the speaker like one who has\njust heard a wild fairy tale, which nevertheless contains\none small and forgotten fact.  For he remembered how he had\nhimself thought of Jeanne d'Arc years ago, when, hardly more\nthan a schoolboy, he had first come to the boarding-house. Long\nsince the pulverizing rationalism of his friend Dr. Warner had\ncrushed such youthful ignorances and disproportionate dreams.\nUnder the Warnerian scepticism and science of hopeless\nhuman types, Inglewood had long come to regard himself as\na timid, insufficient, and \"weak\" type, who would never marry;\nto regard Diana Duke as a materialistic maidservant;\nand to regard his first fancy for her as the small,\ndull farce of a collegian kissing his landlady's daughter.\nAnd yet the phrase about military music moved him queerly,\nas if he had heard those distant drums.\n\n\"She has to keep things pretty tight, as is only natural,\" said Moon,\nglancing round the rather dwarfish room, with its wedge of slanted ceiling,\nlike the conical hood of a dwarf.\n\n\"Rather a small box for you, sir,\" said the waggish Mr. Gould.\n\n\"Splendid room, though,\" answered Mr. Smith enthusiastically, with his\nhead inside his Gladstone bag.  \"I love these pointed sorts of rooms,\nlike Gothic.  By the way,\" he cried out, pointing in quite a startling way,\n\"where does that door lead to?\"\n\n\"To certain death, I should say,\" answered Michael Moon, staring up at\na dust-stained and disused trapdoor in the sloping roof of the attic.\n\"I don't think there's a loft there; and I don't know what else it\ncould lead to.\"  Long before he had finished his sentence the man\nwith the strong green legs had leapt at the door in the ceiling,\nswung himself somehow on to the ledge beneath it, wrenched it open after\na struggle, and clambered through it.  For a moment they saw the two\nsymbolic legs standing like a truncated statue; then they vanished.\nThrough the hole thus burst in the roof appeared the empty and lucid\nsky of evening, with one great many-coloured cloud sailing across\nit like a whole county upside down.\n\n\"Hullo, you fellows!\" came the far cry of Innocent Smith,\napparently from some remote pinnacle.  \"Come up here;\nand bring some of my things to eat and drink.  It's just the spot\nfor a picnic.\"\n\nWith a sudden impulse Michael snatched two of the small\nbottles of wine, one in each solid fist; and Arthur Inglewood,\nas if mesmerized, groped for a biscuit tin and a big jar of ginger.\nThe enormous hand of Innocent Smith appearing through the aperture,\nlike a giant's in a fairy tale, received these tributes and bore them\noff to the eyrie; then they both hoisted themselves out of the window.\nThey were both athletic, and even gymnastic; Inglewood through his\nconcern for hygiene, and Moon through his concern for sport, which was\nnot quite so idle and inactive as that of the average sportsman.\nAlso they both had a light-headed burst of celestial sensation when\nthe door was burst in the roof, as if a door had been burst in the sky,\nand they could climb out on to the very roof of the universe.\nThey were both men who had long been unconsciously imprisoned in\nthe commonplace, though one took it comically, and the other seriously.\nThey were both men, nevertheless, in whom sentiment had never died.\nBut Mr. Moses Gould had an equal contempt for their suicidal athletics\nand their subconscious transcendentalism, and he stood and laughed\nat the thing with the shameless rationality of another race.\n\nWhen the singular Smith, astride of a chimney-pot, learnt that Gould\nwas not following, his infantile officiousness and good nature\nforced him to dive back into the attic to comfort or persuade;\nand Inglewood and Moon were left alone on the long gray-green\nridge of the slate roof, with their feet against gutters and their\nbacks against chimney-pots, looking agnostically at each other.\nTheir first feeling was that they had come out into eternity,\nand that eternity was very like topsy-turvydom. One definition\noccurred to both of them--that he had come out into the light\nof that lucid and radiant ignorance in which all beliefs had begun.\nThe sky above them was full of mythology.  Heaven seemed deep\nenough to hold all the gods.  The round of the ether turned\nfrom green to yellow gradually like a great unripe fruit.\nAll around the sunken sun it was like a lemon; round all the east it\nwas a sort of golden green, more suggestive of a greengage; but the whole\nhad still the emptiness of daylight and none of the secrecy of dusk.\nTumbled here and there across this gold and pale green were\nshards and shattered masses of inky purple cloud, which seemed\nfalling towards the earth in every kind of colossal perspective.\nOne of them really had the character of some many-mitred,\nmany-bearded, many-winged Assyrian image, huge head downwards,\nhurled out of heaven--a sort of false Jehovah, who was perhaps Satan.\nAll the other clouds had preposterous pinnacled shapes, as if the god's\npalaces had been flung after him.\n\nAnd yet, while the empty heaven was full of silent catastrophe, the height\nof human buildings above which they sat held here and there a tiny trivial\nnoise that was the exact antithesis; and they heard some six streets below\na newsboy calling, and a bell bidding to chapel.  They could also hear\ntalk out of the garden below; and realized that the irrepressible Smith\nmust have followed Gould downstairs, for his eager and pleading accents\ncould be heard, followed by the half-humourous protests of Miss Duke\nand the full and very youthful laughter of Rosamund Hunt.  The air had\nthat cold kindness that comes after a storm.  Michael Moon drank it in with\nas serious a relish as he had drunk the little bottle of cheap claret,\nwhich he had emptied almost at a draught.  Inglewood went on eating ginger\nvery slowly and with a solemnity unfathomable as the sky above him.\nThere was still enough stir in the freshness of the atmosphere to make them\nalmost fancy they could smell the garden soil and the last roses of autumn.\nSuddenly there came from the darkening room a silvery ping and pong which\ntold them that Rosamund had brought out the long-neglected mandoline.\nAfter the first few notes there was more of the distant bell-like laughter.\n\n\"Inglewood,\" said Michael Moon, \"have you ever heard that I\nam a blackguard?\"\n\n\"I haven't heard it, and I don't believe it,\" answered Inglewood,\nafter an odd pause.  \"But I have heard you were--what they\ncall rather wild.\"\n\n\"If you have heard that I am wild, you can contradict the rumour,\"\nsaid Moon, with an extraordinary calm; \"I am tame.\nI am quite tame; I am about the tamest beast that crawls.\nI drink too much of the same kind of whisky at the same time\nevery night.  I even drink about the same amount too much.\nI go to the same number of public-houses. I meet the same damned\nwomen with mauve faces.  I hear the same number of dirty stories--\ngenerally the same dirty stories.  You may assure my friends,\nInglewood, that you see before you a person whom civilization\nhas thoroughly tamed.\"\n\nArthur Inglewood was staring with feelings that made him nearly\nfall off the roof, for indeed the Irishman's face, always sinister,\nwas now almost demoniacal.\n\n\"Christ confound it!\" cried out Moon, suddenly clutching the empty\nclaret bottle, \"this is about the thinnest and filthiest wine\nI ever uncorked, and it's the only drink I have really enjoyed\nfor nine years.  I was never wild until just ten minutes ago.\"\nAnd he sent the bottle whizzing, a wheel of glass, far away beyond\nthe garden into the road, where, in the profound evening silence,\nthey could even hear it break and part upon the stones.\n\n\"Moon,\" said Arthur Inglewood, rather huskily, \"you mustn't be\nso bitter about it.  Everyone has to take the world as he finds it;\nof course one often finds it a bit dull--\"\n\n\"That fellow doesn't,\" said Michael decisively; \"I mean that\nfellow Smith.  I have a fancy there's some method in his madness.\nIt looks as if he could turn into a sort of wonderland any minute by taking\none step out of the plain road.  Who would have thought of that trapdoor?\nWho would have thought that this cursed colonial claret could taste quite\nnice among the chimney-pots? Perhaps that is the real key of fairyland.\nPerhaps Nosey Gould's beastly little Empire Cigarettes ought only to\nbe smoked on stilts, or something of that sort.  Perhaps Mrs. Duke's\ncold leg of mutton would seem quite appetizing at the top of a tree.\nPerhaps even my damned, dirty, monotonous drizzle of Old Bill Whisky--\"\n\n\"Don't be so rough on yourself,\" said Inglewood, in serious distress.\n\"The dullness isn't your fault or the whisky's. Fellows who don't--\nfellows like me I mean--have just the same feeling that it's all rather\nflat and a failure.  But the world's made like that; it's all survival.\nSome people are made to get on, like Warner; and some people are\nmade to stick quiet, like me.  You can't help your temperament.\nI know you're much cleverer than I am; but you can't help having\nall the loose ways of a poor literary chap, and I can't help\nhaving all the doubts and helplessness of a small scientific chap,\nany more than a fish can help floating or a fern can help curling up.\nHumanity, as Warner said so well in that lecture, really consists\nof quite different tribes of animals all disguised as men.\"\n\nIn the dim garden below the buzz of talk was suddenly broken\nby Miss Hunt's musical instrument banging with the abruptness\nof artillery into a vulgar but spirited tune.\n\nRosamund's voice came up rich and strong in the words of some fatuous,\nfashionable coon song:-\n\n        \"Darkies sing a song on the old plantation,\n         Sing it as we sang it in days long since gone by.\"\n\n\nInglewood's brown eyes softened and saddened still more as he continued\nhis monologue of resignation to such a rollicking and romantic tune.\nBut the blue eyes of Michael Moon brightened and hardened with a light\nthat Inglewood did not understand.  Many centuries, and many villages\nand valleys, would have been happier if Inglewood or Inglewood's countrymen\nhad ever understood that light, or guessed at the first blink that it\nwas the battle star of Ireland.\n\n\"Nothing can ever alter it; it's in the wheels of the universe,\"\nwent on Inglewood, in a low voice:  \"some men are weak and some strong,\nand the only thing we can do is to know that we are weak.\nI have been in love lots of times, but I could not do anything,\nfor I remembered my own fickleness.  I have formed opinions, but I\nhaven't the cheek to push them, because I've so often changed them.\nThat's the upshot, old fellow.  We can't trust ourselves--\nand we can't help it.\"\n\nMichael had risen to his feet, and stood poised in a perilous position\nat the end of the roof, like some dark statue hung above its gable.\nBehind him, huge clouds of an almost impossible purple turned slowly\ntopsy-turvy in the silent anarchy of heaven.  Their gyration made\nthe dark figure seem yet dizzier.\n\n\"Let us...\" he said, and was suddenly silent.\n\n\"Let us what?\" asked Arthur Inglewood, rising equally quick though somewhat\nmore cautiously, for his friend seemed to find some difficulty in speech.\n\n\"Let us go and do some of these things we can't do,\" said Michael.\n\nAt the same moment there burst out of the trapdoor below them\nthe cockatoo hair and flushed face of Innocent Smith, calling to\nthem that they must come down as the \"concert\" was in full swing,\nand Mr. Moses Gould was about to recite \"Young Lochinvar.\"\n\nAs they dropped into Innocent's attic they nearly tumbled over its\nentertaining impedimenta again.  Inglewood, staring at the littered floor,\nthought instinctively of the littered floor of a nursery.\nHe was therefore the more moved, and even shocked, when his eye fell\non a large well-polished American revolver.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he cried, stepping back from the steely glitter as men step back\nfrom a serpent; \"are you afraid of burglars? or when and why do you deal\ndeath out of that machine gun?\"\n\n\"Oh, that!\" said Smith, throwing it a single glance; \"I deal life\nout of that,\" and he went bounding down the stairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Chapter III\n\n                    The Banner of Beacon\n\n\nAll next day at Beacon House there was a crazy sense that it was\neverybody's birthday.  It is the fashion to talk of institutions\nas cold and cramping things.  The truth is that when people are in\nexceptionally high spirits, really wild with freedom and invention,\nthey always must, and they always do, create institutions.\nWhen men are weary they fall into anarchy; but while they are gay\nand vigorous they invariably make rules.  This, which is true of all\nthe churches and republics of history, is also true of the most\ntrivial parlour game or the most unsophisticated meadow romp.\nWe are never free until some institution frees us; and liberty\ncannot exist till it is declared by authority.  Even the wild\nauthority of the harlequin Smith was still authority, because it\nproduced everywhere a crop of crazy regulations and conditions.\nHe filled every one with his own half-lunatic life; but it was not\nexpressed in destruction, but rather in a dizzy and toppling construction.\nEach person with a hobby found it turning into an institution.\nRosamund's songs seemed to coalesce into a kind of opera;\nMichael's jests and paragraphs into a magazine.  His pipe and her\nmandoline seemed between them to make a sort of smoking concert.\nThe bashful and bewildered Arthur Inglewood almost struggled against his\nown growing importance.  He felt as if, in spite of him, his photographs\nwere turning into a picture gallery, and his bicycle into a gymkhana.\nBut no one had any time to criticize these impromptu estates and offices,\nfor they followed each other in wild succession like the topics\nof a rambling talker.\n\nExistence with such a man was an obstacle race made out of\npleasant obstacles.  Out of any homely and trivial object he could drag\nreels of exaggeration, like a conjurer.  Nothing could be more shy\nand impersonal than poor Arthur's photography.  Yet the preposterous\nSmith was seen assisting him eagerly through sunny morning hours,\nand an indefensible sequence described as \"Moral Photography\"\nbegan to unroll about the boarding-house. It was only a version of the old\nphotographer's joke which produces the same figure twice on one plate,\nmaking a man play chess with himself, dine with himself, and so on.\nBut these plates were more hysterical and ambitious--as, \"Miss Hunt\nforgets Herself,\" showing that lady answering her own too\nrapturous recognition with a most appalling stare of ignorance;\nor \"Mr. Moon questions Himself,\" in which Mr. Moon appeared as one\ndriven to madness under his own legal cross-examination, which was\nconducted with a long forefinger and an air of ferocious waggery.\nOne highly successful trilogy--representing Inglewood recognizing\nInglewood, Inglewood prostrating himself before Inglewood,\nand Inglewood severely beating Inglewood with an umbrella--\nInnocent Smith wanted to have enlarged and put up in the hall,\nlike a sort of fresco, with the inscription,--\n\n        \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control--\n         These three alone will make a man a prig.\"\n\n                                                -- Tennyson.\n\n\nNothing, again, could be more prosaic and impenetrable than\nthe domestic energies of Miss Diana Duke.  But Innocent had somehow\nblundered on the discovery that her thrifty dressmaking went\nwith a considerable feminine care for dress--the one feminine thing\nthat had never failed her solitary self-respect. In consequence Smith\npestered her with a theory (which he really seemed to take seriously)\nthat ladies might combine economy with magnificence if they would draw\nlight chalk patterns on a plain dress and then dust them off again.\nHe set up \"Smith's Lightning Dressmaking Company,\" with two screens,\na cardboard placard, and box of bright soft crayons; and Miss Diana\nactually threw him an abandoned black overall or working dress on\nwhich to exercise the talents of a modiste.  He promptly produced\nfor her a garment aflame with red and gold sunflowers; she held\nit up an instant to her shoulders, and looked like an empress.\nAnd Arthur Inglewood, some hours afterwards cleaning his bicycle\n(with his usual air of being inextricably hidden in it), glanced up;\nand his hot face grew hotter, for Diana stood laughing for one\nflash in the doorway, and her dark robe was rich with the green\nand purple of great decorative peacocks, like a secret garden\nin the \"Arabian Nights.\"  A pang too swift to be named pain\nor pleasure went through his heart like an old-world rapier.\nHe remembered how pretty he thought her years ago, when he was\nready to fall in love with anybody; but it was like remembering\na worship of some Babylonian princess in some previous existence.\nAt his next glimpse of her (and he caught himself awaiting it)\nthe purple and green chalk was dusted off, and she went by quickly\nin her working clothes.\n\nAs for Mrs. Duke, none who knew that matron could conceive her as\nactively resisting this invasion that had turned her house upside down.\nBut among the most exact observers it was seriously believed that she\nliked it.  For she was one of those women who at bottom regard all\nmen as equally mad, wild animals of some utterly separate species.\nAnd it is doubtful if she really saw anything more eccentric or\ninexplicable in Smith's chimney-pot picnics or crimson sunflowers\nthan she had in the chemicals of Inglewood or the sardonic speeches\nof Moon.  Courtesy, on the other hand, is a thing that anybody\ncan understand, and Smith's manners were as courteous as they\nwere unconventional.  She said he was \"a real gentleman,\" by which she\nsimply meant a kind-hearted man, which is a very different thing.\nShe would sit at the head of the table with fat, folded hands and a fat,\nfolded smile for hours and hours, while every one else was talking at once.\nAt least, the only other exception was Rosamund's companion,\nMary Gray, whose silence was of a much more eager sort.  Though she\nnever spoke she always looked as if she might speak any minute.\nPerhaps this is the very definition of a companion.  Innocent Smith\nseemed to throw himself, as into other adventures, into the adventure\nof making her talk.  He never succeeded, yet he was never snubbed;\nif he achieved anything, it was only to draw attention to this quiet figure,\nand to turn her, by ever so little, from a modesty to a mystery.\nBut if she was a riddle, every one recognized that she was a fresh\nand unspoilt riddle, like the riddle of the sky and the woods in spring.\nIndeed, though she was rather older than the other two girls,\nshe had an early morning ardour, a fresh earnestness of youth,\nwhich Rosamund seemed to have lost in the mere spending of money,\nand Diana in the mere guarding of it.  Smith looked at her again and again.\nHer eyes and mouth were set in her face the wrong way--which was really\nthe right way.  She had the knack of saying everything with her face:\nher silence was a sort of steady applause.\n\nBut among the hilarious experiments of that holiday\n(which seemed more like a week's holiday than a day's)\none experiment towers supreme, not because it was any sillier\nor more successful than the others, but because out of this\nparticular folly flowed all of the odd events that were to follow.\nAll the other practical jokes exploded of themselves, and left vacancy;\nall the other fictions returned upon themselves, and were finished\nlike a song.  But the string of solid and startling events--\nwhich were to include a hansom cab, a detective, a pistol,\nand a marriage licence--were all made primarily possible\nby the joke about the High Court of Beacon.\n\nIt had originated, not with Innocent Smith, but with Michael Moon.  He was\nin a strange glow and pressure of spirits, and talked incessantly;\nyet he had never been more sarcastic, and even inhuman.\nHe used his old useless knowledge as a barrister to talk\nentertainingly of a tribunal that was a parody on the pompous\nanomalies of English law.  The High Court of Beacon, he declared,\nwas a splendid example of our free and sensible constitution.\nIt had been founded by King John in defiance of the Magna Carta,\nand now held absolute power over windmills, wine and spirit licences,\nladies traveling in Turkey, revision of sentences for dog-stealing\nand parricide, as well as anything whatever that happened in the town of\nMarket Bosworth.  The whole hundred and nine seneschals of the High Court\nof Beacon met once in every four centuries; but in the intervals\n(as Mr. Moon explained) the whole powers of the institution were vested\nin Mrs. Duke.  Tossed about among the rest of the company, however,\nthe High Court did not retain its historical and legal seriousness,\nbut was used somewhat unscrupulously in a riot of domestic detail.\nIf somebody spilt the Worcester Sauce on the tablecloth, he was quite\nsure it was a rite without which the sittings and findings of the Court\nwould be invalid; or if somebody wanted a window to remain shut,\nhe would suddenly remember that none but the third son of the lord\nof the manor of Penge had the right to open it.  They even went\nto the length of making arrests and conducting criminal inquiries.\nThe proposed trial of Moses Gould for patriotism was rather\nabove the heads of the company, especially of the criminal;\nbut the trial of Inglewood on a charge of photographic libel,\nand his triumphant acquittal upon a plea of insanity, were admitted\nto be in the best tradition of the Court.\n\nBut when Smith was in wild spirits he grew more and more serious, not more and\nmore flippant like Michael Moon.  This proposal of a private court of justice,\nwhich Moon had thrown off with the detachment of a political humourist,\nSmith really caught hold of with the eagerness of an abstract philosopher.\nIt was by far the best thing they could do, he declared, to claim sovereign\npowers even for the individual household.\n\n\"You believe in Home Rule for Ireland; I believe in Home Rule\nfor homes,\" he cried eagerly to Michael.  \"It would be better\nif every father COULD kill his son, as with the old Romans;\nit would be better, because nobody would be killed.\nLet's issue a Declaration of Independence from Beacon House.\nWe could grow enough greens in that garden to support us,\nand when the tax-collector comes let's tell him we're self-supporting,\nand play on him with the hose....  Well, perhaps, as you say,\nwe couldn't very well have a hose, as that comes from the main;\nbut we could sink a well in this chalk, and a lot could be\ndone with water-jugs....  Let this really be Beacon House.\nLet's light a bonfire of independence on the roof, and see house\nafter house answering it across the valley of the Thames!  Let us begin\nthe League of the Free Families!  Away with Local Government!  A fig\nfor Local Patriotism!  Let every house be a sovereign state as this is,\nand judge its own children by its own law, as we do by the Court\nof Beacon.  Let us cut the painter, and begin to be happy together,\nas if we were on a desert island.\"\n\n\"I know that desert island,\" said Michael Moon; \"it only\nexists in the `Swiss Family Robinson.'  A man feels a strange\ndesire for some sort of vegetable milk, and crash comes down\nsome unexpected cocoa-nut from some undiscovered monkey.\nA literary man feels inclined to pen a sonnet, and at once\nan officious porcupine rushes out of a thicket and shoots out\none of his quills.\"\n\n\"Don't you say a word against the `Swiss Family Robinson,'\"\ncried Innocent with great warmth.  \"It mayn't be\nexact science, but it's dead accurate philosophy.\nWhen you're really shipwrecked, you do really find what you want.\nWhen you're really on a desert island, you never find it a desert.\nIf we were really besieged in this garden, we'd find a hundred\nEnglish birds and English berries that we never knew were here.\nIf we were snowed up in this room, we'd be the better for reading\nscores of books in that bookcase that we don't even know are there;\nwe'd have talks with each other, good, terrible talks, that we shall\ngo to the grave without guessing; we'd find materials for everything--\nchristening, marriage, or funeral; yes, even for a coronation--\nif we didn't decide to be a republic.\"\n\n\"A coronation on `Swiss Family' lines, I suppose,\" said Michael, laughing.\n\"Oh, I know you would find everything in that atmosphere.  If we wanted\nsuch a simple thing, for instance, as a Coronation Canopy, we should\nwalk down beyond the geraniums and find the Canopy Tree in full bloom.\nIf we wanted such a trifle as a crown of gold, why, we should be\ndigging up dandelions, and we should find a gold mine under the lawn.\nAnd when we wanted oil for the ceremony, why I suppose a great storm\nwould wash everything on shore, and we should find there was a Whale\non the premises.\"\n\n\"And so there IS a whale on the premises for all you know,\"\nasseverated Smith, striking the table with passion.\n\"I bet you've never examined the premises!  I bet you've\nnever been round at the back as I was this morning--\nfor I found the very thing you say could only grow on a tree.\nThere's an old sort of square tent up against the dustbin;\nit's got three holes in the canvas, and a pole's broken,\nso it's not much good as a tent, but as a Canopy--\" And his\nvoice quite failed him to express its shining adequacy;\nthen he went on with controversial eagerness:  \"You see I\ntake every challenge as you make it.  I believe every blessed\nthing you say couldn't be here has been here all the time.\nYou say you want a whale washed up for oil.  Why, there's oil\nin that cruet-stand at your elbow; and I don't believe\nanybody has touched it or thought of it for years.\nAnd as for your gold crown, we're none of us wealthy here,\nbut we could collect enough ten-shilling bits from our own\npockets to string round a man's head for half an hour;\nor one of Miss Hunt's gold bangles is nearly big enough to--\"\n\nThe good-humoured Rosamund was almost choking with laughter.\n\"All is not gold that glitters,\" she said, \"and besides--\"\n\n\"What a mistake that is!\" cried Innocent Smith,\nleaping up in great excitement.  \"All is gold that glitters--\nespecially now we are a Sovereign State.  What's the good\nof a Sovereign State if you can't define a sovereign?\nWe can make anything a precious metal, as men could in the morning\nof the world.  They didn't choose gold because it was rare;\nyour scientists can tell you twenty sorts of slime much rarer.\nThey chose gold because it was bright--because it was\na hard thing to find, but pretty when you've found it.\nYou can't fight with golden swords or eat golden biscuits;\nyou can only look at it--and you can look at it out here.\"\n\nWith one of his incalculable motions he sprang back and burst open\nthe doors into the garden.  At the same time also, with one of his\ngestures that never seemed at the instant so unconventional as they were,\nhe stretched out his hand to Mary Gray, and led her out on to the lawn\nas if for a dance.\n\nThe French windows, thus flung open, let in an evening even lovelier than that\nof the day before.  The west was swimming with sanguine colours, and a sort\nof sleepy flame lay along the lawn.  The twisted shadows of the one or two\ngarden trees showed upon this sheen, not gray or black, as in common daylight,\nbut like arabesques written in vivid violet ink on some page of Eastern gold.\nThe sunset was one of those festive and yet mysterious conflagrations in\nwhich common things by their colours remind us of costly or curious things.\nThe slates upon the sloping roof burned like the plumes of a vast peacock,\nin every mysterious blend of blue and green.  The red-brown bricks of\nthe wall glowed with all the October tints of strong ruby and tawny wines.\nThe sun seemed to set each object alight with a different coloured flame,\nlike a man lighting fireworks; and even Innocent's hair, which was of a rather\ncolourless fairness, seemed to have a flame of pagan gold on it as he strode\nacross the lawn towards the one tall ridge of rockery.\n\n\"What would be the good of gold,\" he was saying, \"if it did not glitter?\nWhy should we care for a black sovereign any more than for a\nblack sun at noon?  A black button would do just as well.\nDon't you see that everything in this garden looks like a jewel?\nAnd will you kindly tell me what the deuce is the good of a jewel\nexcept that it looks like a jewel?  Leave off buying and selling,\nand start looking!  Open your eyes, and you'll wake up in\nthe New Jerusalem.\n\n        \"All is gold that glitters--\n           Tree and tower of brass;\n         Rolls the golden evening air\n           Down the golden grass.\n         Kick the cry to Jericho,\n           How yellow mud is sold;\n         All is gold that glitters,\n           For the glitter is the gold.\"\n\n\n\"And who wrote that?\" asked Rosamund, amused.\n\n\"No one will ever write it,\" answered Smith, and cleared the rockery\nwith a flying leap.\n\n\"Really,\" said Rosamund to Michael Moon, \"he ought to be sent to an asylum.\nDon't you think so?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" inquired Michael, rather sombrely; his long,\nswarthy head was dark against the sunset, and, either by accident or mood,\nhe had the look of something isolated and even hostile amid the social\nextravagance of the garden.\n\n\"I only said Mr. Smith ought to go to an asylum,\" repeated the lady.\n\nThe lean face seemed to grow longer and longer, for Moon was\nunmistakably sneering.  \"No,\" he said; \"I don't think it's\nat all necessary.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Rosamund quickly.  \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he is in one now,\" answered Michael Moon, in a quiet but ugly voice.\n\"Why, didn't you know?\"\n\n\"What?\" cried the girl, and there was a break in her voice;\nfor the Irishman's face and voice were really almost creepy.\nWith his dark figure and dark sayings in all that sunshine\nhe looked like the devil in paradise.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he continued, with a sort of harsh humility.\n\"Of course we don't talk about it much... but I thought we\nall really knew.\"\n\n\"Knew what?\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Moon, \"that Beacon House is a certain rather singular\nsort of house--a house with the tiles loose, shall we say?  Innocent Smith\nis only the doctor that visits us; hadn't you come when he called before?\nAs most of our maladies are melancholic, of course he has to be extra cheery.\nSanity, of course, seems a very bumptious eccentric thing to us.\nJumping over a wall, climbing a tree--that's his bedside manner.\"\n\n\"You daren't say such a thing!\" cried Rosamund in a rage.\n\"You daren't suggest that I--\"\n\n\"Not more than I am,\" said Michael soothingly; \"not more than the rest of us.\nHaven't you ever noticed that Miss Duke never sits still--a notorious sign?\nHaven't you ever observed that Inglewood is always washing his hands--\na known mark of mental disease?  I, of course, am a dipsomaniac.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" broke out his companion, not without agitation.\n\"I've heard you had some bad habits--\"\n\n\"All habits are bad habits,\" said Michael, with deadly calm.\n\"Madness does not come by breaking out, but by giving in; by settling down\nin some dirty, little, self-repeating circle of ideas; by being tamed.\nYOU went mad about money, because you're an heiress.\"\n\n\"It's a lie,\" cried Rosamund furiously.  \"I never was mean about money.\"\n\n\"You were worse,\" said Michael, in a low voice and yet violently.\n\"You thought that other people were.  You thought every man who came near\nyou must be a fortune-hunter; you would not let yourself go and be sane;\nand now you're mad and I'm mad, and serve us right.\"\n\n\"You brute!\" said Rosamund, quite white.  \"And is this true?\"\n\nWith the intellectual cruelty of which the Celt is capable\nwhen his abysses are in revolt, Michael was silent for\nsome seconds, and then stepped back with an ironical bow.\n\"Not literally true, of course,\" he said; \"only really true.\nAn allegory, shall we say? a social satire.\"\n\n\"And I hate and despise your satires,\" cried Rosamund Hunt,\nletting loose her whole forcible female personality like a cyclone,\nand speaking every word to wound.  \"I despise it as I despise\nyour rank tobacco, and your nasty, loungy ways, and your snarling,\nand your Radicalism, and your old clothes, and your potty\nlittle newspaper, and your rotten failure at everything.\nI don't care whether you call it snobbishness or not, I like\nlife and success, and jolly things to look at, and action.\nYou won't frighten me with Diogenes; I prefer Alexander.\"\n\n\"Victrix causa deae--\" said Michael gloomily; and this angered\nher more, as, not knowing what it meant, she imagined it\nto be witty.\n\n\"Oh, I dare say you know Greek,\" she said, with cheerful inaccuracy;\n\"you haven't done much with that either.\"  And she crossed the garden,\npursuing the vanished Innocent and Mary.\n\nIn doing so she passed Inglewood, who was returning to the house slowly,\nand with a thought-clouded brow.  He was one of those men who are\nquite clever, but quite the reverse of quick.  As he came back\nout of the sunset garden into the twilight parlour, Diana Duke\nslipped swiftly to her feet and began putting away the tea things.\nBut it was not before Inglewood had seen an instantaneous picture so unique\nthat he might well have snapshotted it with his everlasting camera.\nFor Diana had been sitting in front of her unfinished work with her chin\non her hand, looking straight out of the window in pure thoughtless thought.\n\n\"You are busy,\" said Arthur, oddly embarrassed with what he had seen,\nand wishing to ignore it.\n\n\"There's no time for dreaming in this world,\" answered the young lady\nwith her back to him.\n\n\"I have been thinking lately,\" said Inglewood in a low voice,\n\"that there's no time for waking up.\"\n\nShe did not reply, and he walked to the window and looked out on the garden.\n\n\"I don't smoke or drink, you know,\" he said irrelevantly,\n\"because I think they're drugs.  And yet I fancy all hobbies,\nlike my camera and bicycle, are drugs too.  Getting under a\nblack hood, getting into a dark room--getting into a hole anyhow.\nDrugging myself with speed, and sunshine, and fatigue, and fresh air.\nPedalling the machine so fast that I turn into a machine myself.\nThat's the matter with all of us.  We're too busy to wake up.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl solidly, \"what is there to wake up to?\"\n\n\"There must be!\" cried Inglewood, turning round in a singular\nexcitement--\"there must be something to wake up to!\nAll we do is preparations--your cleanliness, and my healthiness,\nand Warner's scientific appliances.  We're always preparing\nfor something--something that never comes off.  I ventilate\nthe house, and you sweep the house; but what is going to HAPPEN\nin the house?\"\n\nShe was looking at him quietly, but with very bright eyes,\nand seemed to be searching for some form of words which she\ncould not find.\n\nBefore she could speak the door burst open, and the boisterous Rosamund Hunt,\nin her flamboyant white hat, boa, and parasol, stood framed in the doorway.\nShe was in a breathing heat, and on her open face was an expression of\nthe most infantile astonishment.\n\n\"Well, here's a fine game!\" she said, panting.  \"What am I to do now,\nI wonder?  I've wired for Dr. Warner; that's all I can think of doing.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Diana, rather sharply, but moving\nforward like one used to be called upon for assistance.\n\n\"It's Mary,\" said the heiress, \"my companion Mary Gray:\nthat cracked friend of yours called Smith has proposed to her\nin the garden, after ten hours' acquaintance, and he wants\nto go off with her now for a special licence.\"\n\nArthur Inglewood walked to the open French windows and looked\nout on the garden, still golden with evening light.\nNothing moved there but a bird or two hopping and twittering;\nbut beyond the hedge and railings, in the road outside\nthe garden gate, a hansom cab was waiting, with the yellow\nGladstone bag on top of it.\n\n\n\n\n                         Chapter IV\n\n                    The Garden of the God\n\n\nDiana Duke seemed inexplicably irritated at the abrupt entrance\nand utterance of the other girl.\n\n\"Well,\" she said shortly, \"I suppose Miss Gray can decline him if she\ndoesn't want to marry him.\"\n\n\"But she DOES want to marry him!\" cried Rosamund in exasperation.\n\"She's a wild, wicked fool, and I won't be parted from her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Diana icily, \"but I really don't see what we can do.\"\n\n\"But the man's balmy, Diana,\" reasoned her friend angrily.\n\"I can't let my nice governess marry a man that's balmy!\nYou or somebody MUST stop it!--Mr. Inglewood, you're a man;\ngo and tell them they simply can't.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it seems to me they simply can,\" said Inglewood,\nwith a depressed air.  \"I have far less right of intervention\nthan Miss Duke, besides having, of course, far less moral\nforce than she.\"\n\n\"You haven't either of you got much,\" cried Rosamund,\nthe last stays of her formidable temper giving way;\n\"I think I'll go somewhere else for a little sense and pluck.\nI think I know some one who will help me more than you do,\nat any rate... he's a cantankerous beast, but he's a man,\nand has a mind, and knows it...\" And she flung out into the garden,\nwith cheeks aflame, and the parasol whirling like a Catherine wheel.\n\nShe found Michael Moon standing under the garden tree, looking over\nthe hedge; hunched like a bird of prey, with his large pipe hanging down\nhis long blue chin.  The very hardness of his expression pleased her,\nafter the nonsense of the new engagement and the shilly-shallying\nof her other friends.\n\n\"I am sorry I was cross, Mr. Moon,\" she said frankly.  \"I hated you\nfor being a cynic; but I've been well punished, for I want a cynic\njust now.  I've had my fill of sentiment--I'm fed up with it.\nThe world's gone mad, Mr. Moon--all except the cynics, I think.\nThat maniac Smith wants to marry my old friend Mary, and she--\nand she--doesn't seem to mind.\"\n\nSeeing his attentive face still undisturbedly smoking, she added smartly,\n\"I'm not joking; that's Mr. Smith's cab outside.  He swears he'll\ntake her off now to his aunt's, and go for a special licence.\nDo give me some practical advice, Mr. Moon.\"\n\nMr. Moon took his pipe out of his mouth, held it in his hand\nfor an instant reflectively, and then tossed it to the other side\nof the garden.  \"My practical advice to you is this,\" he said:\n\"Let him go for his special licence, and ask him to get another\none for you and me.\"\n\n\"Is that one of your jokes?\" asked the young lady.\n\"Do say what you really mean.\"\n\n\"I mean that Innocent Smith is a man of business,\"\nsaid Moon with ponderous precision--\"a plain, practical man:\na man of affairs; a man of facts and the daylight.\nHe has let down twenty ton of good building bricks suddenly\non my head, and I am glad to say they have woken me up.\nWe went to sleep a little while ago on this very lawn, in this\nvery sunlight.  We have had a little nap for five years or so,\nbut now we're going to be married, Rosamund, and I can't see\nwhy that cab...\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Rosamund stoutly, \"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"What a lie!\" cried Michael, advancing on her with brightening eyes.\n\"I'm all for lies in an ordinary way; but don't you see that to-night\nthey won't do?  We've wandered into a world of facts, old girl.\nThat grass growing, and that sun going down, and that cab at the door,\nare facts.  You used to torment and excuse yourself by saying I\nwas after your money, and didn't really love you.  But if I stood\nhere now and told you I didn't love you--you wouldn't believe me:\nfor truth is in this garden to-night.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Moon...\" said Rosamund, rather more faintly.\n\nHe kept two big blue magnetic eyes fixed on her face.\n\"Is my name Moon?\" he asked.  \"Is your name Hunt?  On my honour,\nthey sound to me as quaint and as distant as Red Indian names.\nIt's as if your name was `Swim' and my name was `Sunrise.' But our\nreal names are Husband and Wife, as they were when we fell asleep.\"\n\n\"It is no good,\" said Rosamund, with real tears in her eyes;\n\"one can never go back.\"\n\n\"I can go where I damn please,\" said Michael, \"and I can carry\nyou on my shoulder.\"\n\n\"But really, Michael, really, you must stop and think!\"\ncried the girl earnestly.  \"You could carry me off my feet, I dare say,\nsoul and body, but it may be bitter bad business for all that.\nThese things done in that romantic rush, like Mr. Smith's, they--\nthey do attract women, I don't deny it.  As you say, we're all\ntelling the truth to-night. They've attracted poor Mary, for one.\nThey attract me, Michael.  But the cold fact remains:\nimprudent marriages do lead to long unhappiness and disappointment--\nyou've got used to your drinks and things--I shan't be\npretty much longer--\"\n\n\"Imprudent marriages!\" roared Michael.  \"And pray where in earth\nor heaven are there any prudent marriages?  Might as well talk\nabout prudent suicides.  You and I have dawdled round each other\nlong enough, and are we any safer than Smith and Mary Gray,\nwho met last night?  You never know a husband till you marry him.\nUnhappy! of course you'll be unhappy.  Who the devil are you\nthat you shouldn't be unhappy, like the mother that bore you?\nDisappointed! of course we'll be disappointed.  I, for one,\ndon't expect till I die to be so good a man as I am at this minute--\na tower with all the trumpets shouting.\"\n\n\"You see all this,\" said Rosamund, with a grand sincerity in her solid face,\n\"and do you really want to marry me?\"\n\n\"My darling, what else is there to do?\" reasoned the Irishman.  \"What other\noccupation is there for an active man on this earth, except to\nmarry you?  What's the alternative to marriage, barring sleep?\nIt's not liberty, Rosamund.  Unless you marry God, as our nuns do in Ireland,\nyou must marry Man--that is Me.  The only third thing is to marry yourself--\nyourself, yourself, yourself--the only companion that is never satisfied--\nand never satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Michael,\" said Miss Hunt, in a very soft voice, \"if you won't talk so much,\nI'll marry you.\"\n\n\"It's no time for talking,\" cried Michael Moon; \"singing is the only thing.\nCan't you find that mandoline of yours, Rosamund?\"\n\n\"Go and fetch it for me,\" said Rosamund, with crisp and sharp authority.\n\nThe lounging Mr. Moon stood for one split second astonished;\nthen he shot away across the lawn, as if shod with the feathered\nshoes out of the Greek fairy tale.  He cleared three yards\nand fifteen daisies at a leap, out of mere bodily levity;\nbut when he came within a yard or two of the open parlour windows,\nhis flying feet fell in their old manner like lead;\nhe twisted round and came back slowly, whistling.  The events\nof that enchanted evening were not at an end.\n\nInside the dark sitting-room of which Moon had caught a glimpse a curious\nthing had happened, almost an instant after the intemperate exit\nof Rosamund.  It was something which, occurring in that obscure parlour,\nseemed to Arthur Inglewood like heaven and earth turning head over heels,\nthe sea being the ceiling and the stars the floor.  No words can express\nhow it astonished him, as it astonishes all simple men when it happens.\nYet the stiffest female stoicism seems separated from it only by a sheet of\npaper or a sheet of steel.  It indicates no surrender, far less any sympathy.\nThe most rigid and ruthless woman can begin to cry, just as the most\neffeminate man can grow a beard.  It is a separate sexual power,\nand proves nothing one way or the other about force of character.\nBut to young men ignorant of women, like Arthur Inglewood, to see Diana Duke\ncrying was like seeing a motor-car shedding tears of petrol.\n\nHe could never have given (even if his really manly modesty had permitted it)\nany vaguest vision of what he did when he saw that portent.  He acted\nas men do when a theatre catches fire--very differently from how they\nwould have conceived themselves as acting, whether for better or worse.\nHe had a faint memory of certain half-stifled explanations, that the heiress\nwas the one really paying guest, and she would go, and the bailiffs\n(in consequence) would come; but after that he knew nothing of his own\nconduct except by the protests it evoked.\n\n\"Leave me alone, Mr. Inglewood--leave me alone; that's not the way to help.\"\n\n\"But I can help you,\" said Arthur, with grinding certainty;\n\"I can, I can, I can...\"\n\n\"Why, you said,\" cried the girl, \"that you were much weaker than me.\"\n\n\"So I am weaker than you,\" said Arthur, in a voice that went\nvibrating through everything, \"but not just now.\"\n\n\"Let go my hands!\" cried Diana.  \"I won't be bullied.\"\n\nIn one element he was much stronger than she--the matter of humour.\nThis leapt up in him suddenly, and he laughed, saying:  \"Well, you are mean.\nYou know quite well you'll bully me all the rest of my life.\nYou might allow a man the one minute of his life when he's allowed to bully.\"\n\nIt was as extraordinary for him to laugh as for her to cry,\nand for the first time since her childhood Diana was entirely\noff her guard.\n\n\"Do you mean you want to marry me?\" she said.\n\n\"Why, there's a cab at the door!\" cried Inglewood, springing up\nwith an unconscious energy and bursting open the glass doors\nthat led into the garden.\n\nAs he led her out by the hand they realized somehow for the first time\nthat the house and garden were on a steep height over London.  And yet,\nthough they felt the place to be uplifted, they felt it also to be secret:\nit was like some round walled garden on the top of one of the\nturrets of heaven.\n\nInglewood looked around dreamily, his brown eyes devouring\nall sorts of details with a senseless delight.  He noticed for\nthe first time that the railings of the gate beyond the garden\nbushes were moulded like little spearheads and painted blue.\nHe noticed that one of the blue spears was loosened in its place,\nand hung sideways; and this almost made him laugh.  He thought it\nsomehow exquisitely harmless and funny that the railing should\nbe crooked; he thought he should like to know how it happened,\nwho did it, and how the man was getting on.\n\nWhen they were gone a few feet across that fiery grass they realized\nthat they were not alone.  Rosamund Hunt and the eccentric Mr. Moon,\nboth of whom they had last seen in the blackest temper of detachment,\nwere standing together on the lawn.  They were standing in quite\nan ordinary manner, and yet they looked somehow like people in a book.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Diana, \"what lovely air!\"\n\n\"I know,\" called out Rosamund, with a pleasure so positive\nthat it rang out like a complaint.  \"It's just like that horrid,\nbeastly fizzy stuff they gave me that made me feel happy.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't like anything but itself!\" answered Diana, breathing deeply.\n\"Why, it's all cold, and yet it feels like fire.\"\n\n\"Balmy is the word we use in Fleet Street,\"\nsaid Mr. Moon.  \"Balmy--especially on the crumpet.\"\nAnd he fanned himself quite unnecessarily with his straw hat.\nThey were all full of little leaps and pulsations of objectless\nand airy energy.  Diana stirred and stretched her long arms rigidly,\nas if crucified, in a sort of excruciating restfulness;\nMichael stood still for long intervals, with gathered muscles,\nthen spun round like a teetotum, and stood still again;\nRosamund did not trip, for women never trip, except when they\nfall on their noses, but she struck the ground with her foot\nas she moved, as if to some inaudible dance tune; and Inglewood,\nleaning quite quietly against a tree, had unconsciously\nclutched a branch and shaken it with a creative violence.\nThose giant gestures of Man, that made the high statues\nand the strokes of war, tossed and tormented all their limbs.\nSilently as they strolled and stood they were bursting like\nbatteries with an animal magnetism.\n\n\"And now,\" cried Moon quite suddenly, stretching out a hand on each side,\n\"let's dance round that bush!\"\n\n\"Why, what bush do you mean?\" asked Rosamund, looking round with a sort\nof radiant rudeness.\n\n\"The bush that isn't there,\" said Michael--\"the Mulberry Bush.\"\n\nThey had taken each other's hands, half laughing and quite ritually;\nand before they could disconnect again Michael spun them all round,\nlike a demon spinning the world for a top.  Diana felt, as the circle of\nthe horizon flew instantaneously around her, a far aerial sense of the ring\nof heights beyond London and corners where she had climbed as a child;\nshe seemed almost to hear the rooks cawing about the old pines on Highgate,\nor to see the glowworms gathering and kindling in the woods of Box Hill.\n\nThe circle broke--as all such perfect circles of levity must break--\nand sent its author, Michael, flying, as by centrifugal force, far away\nagainst the blue rails of the gate.  When reeling there he suddenly\nraised shout after shout of a new and quite dramatic character.\n\n\"Why, it's Warner!\" he shouted, waving his arms.  \"It's jolly old Warner--\nwith a new silk hat and the old silk moustache!\"\n\n\"Is that Dr. Warner?\" cried Rosamund, bounding forward in a\nburst of memory, amusement, and distress.  \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\nOh, do tell him it's all right!\"\n\n\"Let's take hands and tell him,\" said Michael Moon.  For indeed,\nwhile they were talking, another hansom cab had dashed up behind\nthe one already waiting, and Dr. Herbert Warner, leaving a companion\nin the cab, had carefully deposited himself on the pavement.\n\nNow, when you are an eminent physician and are wired for by\nan heiress to come to a case of dangerous mania, and when,\nas you come in through the garden to the house, the heiress\nand her landlady and two of the gentlemen boarders join hands\nand dance round you in a ring, calling out, \"It's all right! it's\nall right!\" you are apt to be flustered and even displeased.\nDr. Warner was a placid but hardly a placable person.\nThe two things are by no means the same; and even when Moon explained\nto him that he, Warner, with his high hat and tall, solid figure,\nwas just such a classic figure as OUGHT to be danced round\nby a ring of laughing maidens on some old golden Greek seashore--\neven then he seemed to miss the point of the general rejoicing.\n\n\"Inglewood!\" cried Dr. Warner, fixing his former disciple with a stare,\n\"are you mad?\"\n\nArthur flushed to the roots of his brown hair, but he answered,\neasily and quietly enough, \"Not now.  The truth is, Warner, I've just\nmade a rather important medical discovery--quite in your line.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the great doctor stiffly--\"what discovery?\"\n\n\"I've discovered that health really is catching, like disease,\"\nanswered Arthur.\n\n\"Yes; sanity has broken out, and is spreading,\" said Michael,\nperforming a ~pas seul~ with a thoughtful expression.\n\"Twenty thousand more cases taken to the hospitals;\nnurses employed night and day.\"\n\nDr. Warner studied Michael's grave face and lightly moving\nlegs with an unfathomed wonder.  \"And is THIS, may I ask,\"\nhe said, \"the sanity that is spreading?\"\n\n\"You must forgive me, Dr. Warner,\" cried Rosamund Hunt heartily.\n\"I know I've treated you badly; but indeed it was all a mistake.\nI was in a frightfully bad temper when I sent for you, but now\nit all seems like a dream--and and Mr. Smith is the sweetest,\nmost sensible, most delightful old thing that ever existed,\nand he may marry any one he likes--except me.\"\n\n\"I should suggest Mrs. Duke,\" said Michael.\n\nThe gravity of Dr. Warner's face increased.  He took a slip\nof pink paper from his waistcoat pocket, with his pale\nblue eyes quietly fixed on Rosamund's face all the time.\nHe spoke with a not inexcusable frigidity.\n\n\"Really, Miss Hunt,\" he said, \"you are not yet very reassuring.\nYou sent me this wire only half an hour ago:  `Come at once,\nif possible, with another doctor.  Man--Innocent Smith--gone mad\non premises, and doing dreadful things.  Do you know anything of him?'\nI went round at once to a distinguished colleague of mine, a doctor\nwho is also a private detective and an authority on criminal lunacy;\nhe has come round with me, and is waiting in the cab.  Now you calmly\ntell me that this criminal madman is a highly sweet and sane old thing,\nwith accompaniments that set me speculating on your own definition of sanity.\nI hardly comprehend the change.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can one explain a change in sun and moon and everybody's soul?\"\ncried Rosamund, in despair.  \"Must I confess we had got so morbid\nas to think him mad merely because he wanted to get married; and that we\ndidn't even know it was only because we wanted to get married ourselves?\nWe'll humiliate ourselves, if you like, doctor; we're happy enough.\"\n\n\"Where is Mr. Smith?\" asked Warner of Inglewood very sharply.\n\nArthur started; he had forgotten all about the central figure of their farce,\nwho had not been visible for an hour or more.\n\n\"I--I think he's on the other side of the house, by the dustbin,\" he said.\n\n\"He may be on the road to Russia,\" said Warner, \"but he must be found.\"\nAnd he strode away and disappeared round a corner of the house\nby the sunflowers.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Rosamund, \"he won't really interfere with Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"Interfere with the daisies!\" said Michael with a snort.\n\"A man can't be locked up for falling in love--at least\nI hope not.\"\n\n\"No; I think even a doctor couldn't make a disease out of him.\nHe'd throw off the doctor like the disease, don't you know?\nI believe it's a case of a sort of holy well.  I believe Innocent Smith\nis simply innocent, and that is why he is so extraordinary.\"\n\nIt was Rosamund who spoke, restlessly tracing circles in the grass\nwith the point of her white shoe.\n\n\"I think,\" said Inglewood, \"that Smith is not extraordinary at all.\nHe's comic just because he's so startlingly commonplace.\nDon't you know what it is to be all one family circle, with aunts\nand uncles, when a schoolboy comes home for the holidays?\nThat bag there on the cab is only a schoolboy's hamper.\nThis tree here in the garden is only the sort of tree that any\nschoolboy would have climbed.  Yes, that's the thing that has\nhaunted us all about him, the thing we could never fit a word to.\nWhether he is my old schoolfellow or no, at least he is all my\nold schoolfellows.  He is the endless bun-eating, ball-throwing\nanimal that we have all been.\"\n\n\"That is only you absurd boys,\" said Diana.  \"I don't believe\nany girl was ever so silly, and I'm sure no girl was ever\nso happy, except--\" and she stopped.\n\n\"I will tell you the truth about Innocent Smith,\" said Michael Moon in a\nlow voice.  \"Dr. Warner has gone to look for him in vain.  He is not there.\nHaven't you noticed that we never saw him since we found ourselves?\nHe was an astral baby born on all four of us; he was only our own\nyouth returned.  Long before poor old Warner had clambered out of his cab,\nthe thing we called Smith had dissolved into dew and light on this lawn.\nOnce or twice more, by the mercy of God, we may feel the thing,\nbut the man we shall never see.  In a spring garden before breakfast\nwe shall smell the smell called Smith.  In the snapping of brisk twigs\nin tiny fires we shall hear a noise named Smith.  Everything insatiable\nand innocent in the grasses that gobble up the earth like babies at a bun feast,\nin the white mornings that split the sky as a boy splits up white firwood,\nwe may feel for one instant the presence of an impetuous purity;\nbut his innocence was too close to the unconsciousness of inanimate things\nnot to melt back at a mere touch into the mild hedges and heavens; he--\"\n\nHe was interrupted from behind the house by a bang like that of a bomb.\nAlmost at the same instant the stranger in the cab sprang out of it,\nleaving it rocking upon the stones of the road.  He clutched the blue railings\nof the garden, and peered eagerly over them in the direction of the noise.\nHe was a small, loose, yet alert man, very thin, with a face that seemed\nmade out of fish bones, and a silk hat quite as rigid and resplendent\nas Warner's, but thrust back recklessly on the hinder part of his head.\n\n\"Murder!\" he shrieked, in a high and feminine but very penetrating voice.\n\"Stop that murderer there!\"\n\nEven as he shrieked a second shot shook the lower windows\nof the house, and with the noise of it Dr. Herbert Warner came\nflying round the corner like a leaping rabbit.  Yet before\nhe had reached the group a third discharge had deafened them,\nand they saw with their own eyes two spots of white sky drilled\nthrough the second of the unhappy Herbert's high hats.\nThe next moment the fugitive physician fell over a flowerpot,\nand came down on all fours, staring like a cow.  The hat with\nthe two shot-holes in it rolled upon the gravel path before him,\nand Innocent Smith came round the corner like a railway train.\nHe was looking twice his proper size--a giant clad in green,\nthe big revolver still smoking in his hand, his face sanguine\nand in shadow, his eyes blazing like all stars, and his yellow\nhair standing out all ways like Struwelpeter's.\n\nThough this startling scene hung but an instant in stillness,\nInglewood had time to feel once more what he had felt when\nhe saw the other lovers standing on the lawn--the sensation\nof a certain cut and coloured clearness that belongs rather\nto the things of art than to the things of experience.\nThe broken flowerpot with its red-hot geraniums, the green\nbulk of Smith and the black bulk of Warner, the blue-spiked\nrailings behind, clutched by the stranger's yellow vulture\nclaws and peered over by his long vulture neck, the silk hat\non the gravel, and the little cloudlet of smoke floating\nacross the garden as innocently as the puff of a cigarette--\nall these seemed unnaturally distinct and definite.\nThey existed, like symbols, in an ecstasy of separation.\nIndeed, every object grew more and more particular\nand precious because the whole picture was breaking up.\nThings look so bright just before they burst.\n\nLong before his fancies had begun, let alone ceased,\nArthur had stepped across and taken one of Smith's arms.\nSimultaneously the little stranger had run up the steps and taken\nthe other.  Smith went into peals of laughter, and surrendered\nhis pistol with perfect willingness.  Moon raised the doctor\nto his feet, and then went and leaned sullenly on the garden gate.\nThe girls were quiet and vigilant, as good women mostly\nare in instants of catastrophe, but their faces showed that,\nsomehow or other, a light had been dashed out of the sky.\nThe doctor himself, when he had risen, collected his hat and wits,\nand dusting himself down with an air of great disgust, turned to\nthem in brief apology.  He was very white with his recent panic,\nbut he spoke with perfect self-control.\n\n\"You will excuse us, ladies,\" he said; \"my friend and\nMr. Inglewood are both scientists in their several ways.\nI think we had better all take Mr. Smith indoors, and communicate\nwith you later.\"\n\nAnd under the guard of the three natural philosophers the disarmed Smith\nwas led tactfully into the house, still roaring with laughter.\n\nFrom time to time during the next twenty minutes his distant\nboom of mirth could again be heard through the half-open window;\nbut there came no echo of the quiet voices of the physicians.\nThe girls walked about the garden together, rubbing up each other's\nspirits as best they might; Michael Moon still hung heavily against\nthe gate.  Somewhere about the expiration of that time Dr. Warner\ncame out of the house with a face less pale but even more stern,\nand the little man with the fish-bone face advanced gravely in his rear.\nAnd if the face of Warner in the sunlight was that of a hanging judge,\nthe face of the little man behind was more like a death's head.\n\n\"Miss Hunt,\" said Dr. Herbert Warner, \"I only wish to offer you my warm\nthanks and admiration.  By your prompt courage and wisdom in sending\nfor us by wire this evening, you have enabled us to capture and put out\nof mischief one of the most cruel and terrible of the enemies of humanity--\na criminal whose plausibility and pitilessness have never been before\ncombined in flesh.\"\n\nRosamund looked across at him with a white, blank face and blinking eyes.\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked.  \"You can't mean Mr. Smith?\"\n\n\"He has gone by many other names,\" said the doctor gravely,\n\"and not one he did not leave to be cursed behind him.  That man,\nMiss Hunt, has left a track of blood and tears across the world.\nWhether he is mad as well as wicked, we are trying, in the interests\nof science, to discover.  In any case, we shall have to take him\nto a magistrate first, even if only on the road to a lunatic asylum.\nBut the lunatic asylum in which he is confined will have to be\nsealed with wall within wall, and ringed with guns like a fortress,\nor he will break out again to bring forth carnage and darkness\non the earth.\"\n\nRosamund looked at the two doctors, her face growing paler and paler.\nThen her eyes strayed to Michael, who was leaning on the gate;\nbut he continued to lean on it without moving, with his face turned\naway towards the darkening road.\n\n\n\n\n                          Chapter V\n\n               The Allegorical Practical Joker\n\n\nThe criminal specialist who had come with Dr. Warner was a somewhat\nmore urbane and even dapper figure than he had appeared when\nclutching the railings and craning his neck into the garden.\nHe even looked comparatively young when he took his hat off,\nhaving fair hair parted in the middle and carefully curled\non each side, and lively movements, especially of the hands.\nHe had a dandified monocle slung round his neck by a broad black ribbon,\nand a big bow tie, as if a big American moth had alighted on him.\nHis dress and gestures were bright enough for a boy's; it was only\nwhen you looked at the fish-bone face that you beheld something\nacrid and old.  His manners were excellent, though hardly English,\nand he had two half-conscious tricks by which people who only met\nhim once remembered him.  One was a trick of closing his eyes\nwhen he wished to be particularly polite; the other was one of\nlifting his joined thumb and forefinger in the air as if holding\na pinch of snuff, when he was hesitating or hovering over a word.\nBut those who were longer in his company tended to forget these\noddities in the stream of his quaint and solemn conversation\nand really singular views.\n\n\"Miss Hunt,\" said Dr. Warner, \"this is Dr. Cyrus Pym.\"\n\nDr. Cyrus Pym shut his eyes during the introduction, rather as if he were\n\"playing fair\" in some child's game, and gave a prompt little bow,\nwhich somehow suddenly revealed him as a citizen of the United States.\n\n\"Dr. Cyrus Pym,\" continued Warner (Dr. Pym shut his eyes again), \"is perhaps\nthe first criminological expert of America.  We are very fortunate to be able\nto consult with him in this extraordinary case--\"\n\n\"I can't make head or tail of anything,\" said Rosamund.  \"How can\npoor Mr. Smith be so dreadful as he is by your account?\"\n\n\"Or by your telegram,\" said Herbert Warner, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, you don't understand,\" cried the girl impatiently.\n\"Why, he's done us all more good than going to church.\"\n\n\"I think I can explain to the young lady,\" said Dr. Cyrus Pym.  \"This criminal\nor maniac Smith is a very genius of evil, and has a method of his own,\na method of the most daring ingenuity.  He is popular wherever he goes,\nfor he invades every house as an uproarious child.  People are\ngetting suspicious of all the respectable disguises for a scoundrel;\nso he always uses the disguise of--what shall I say--the Bohemian,\nthe blameless Bohemian.  He always carries people off their feet.\nPeople are used to the mask of conventional good conduct.\nHe goes in for eccentric good-nature. You expect a Don Juan to dress\nup as a solemn and solid Spanish merchant; but you're not prepared\nwhen he dresses up as Don Quixote.  You expect a humbug to behave like\nSir Charles Grandison; because (with all respect, Miss Hunt, for the deep,\ntear-moving tenderness of Samuel Richardson) Sir Charles Grandison\nso often behaved like a humbug.  But no real red-blooded citizen is quite\nready for a humbug that models himself not on Sir Charles Grandison\nbut on Sir Roger de Coverly.  Setting up to be a good man a little cracked\nis a new criminal incognito, Miss Hunt.  It's been a great notion,\nand uncommonly successful; but its success just makes it mighty cruel.\nI can forgive Dick Turpin if he impersonates Dr. Busby; I can't forgive\nhim when he impersonates Dr. Johnson.  The saint with a tile loose\nis a bit too sacred, I guess, to be parodied.\"\n\n\"But how do you know,\" cried Rosamund desperately, \"that Mr. Smith\nis a known criminal?\"\n\n\"I collated all the documents,\" said the American, \"when my friend Warner\nknocked me up on receipt of your cable.  It is my professional affair\nto know these facts, Miss Hunt; and there's no more doubt about them\nthan about the Bradshaw down at the depot.  This man has hitherto escaped\nthe law, through his admirable affectations of infancy or insanity.\nBut I myself, as a specialist, have privately authenticated notes\nof some eighteen or twenty crimes attempted or achieved in this manner.\nHe comes to houses as he has to this, and gets a grand popularity.\nHe makes things go.  They do go; when he's gone the things are gone.\nGone, Miss Hunt, gone, a man's life or a man's spoons, or more often a woman.\nI assure you I have all the memoranda.\"\n\n\"I have seen them,\" said Warner solidly, \"I can assure you\nthat all this is correct.\"\n\n\"The most unmanly aspect, according to my feelings,\" went on the American\ndoctor, \"is this perpetual deception of innocent women by a wild simulation\nof innocence.  From almost every house where this great imaginative devil\nhas been, he has taken some poor girl away with him; some say he's got\na hypnotic eye with his other queer features, and that they go like automata.\nWhat's become of all those poor girls nobody knows.  Murdered, I dare say;\nfor we've lots of instances, besides this one, of his turning his hand\nto murder, though none ever brought him under the law.  Anyhow, our most\nmodern methods of research can't find any trace of the wretched women.\nIt's when I think of them that I am really moved, Miss Hunt.  And I've\nreally nothing else to say just now except what Dr. Warner has said.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Warner, with a smile that seemed moulded in marble--\"that\nwe all have to thank you very much for that telegram.\"\n\nThe little Yankee scientist had been speaking with such evident\nsincerity that one forgot the tricks of his voice and manner--\nthe falling eyelids, the rising intonation, and the poised\nfinger and thumb--which were at other times a little comic.\nIt was not so much that he was cleverer than Warner;\nperhaps he was not so clever, though he was more celebrated.\nBut he had what Warner never had, a fresh and unaffected seriousness--\nthe great American virtue of simplicity.  Rosamund knitted\nher brows and looked gloomily toward the darkening house\nthat contained the dark prodigy.\n\nBroad daylight still endured; but it had already changed from gold to silver,\nand was changing from silver to gray.  The long plumy shadows of the one or\ntwo trees in the garden faded more and more upon a dead background of dusk.\nIn the sharpest and deepest shadow, which was the entrance to the house\nby the big French windows, Rosamund could watch a hurried consultation\nbetween Inglewood (who was still left in charge of the mysterious captive)\nand Diana, who had moved to his assistance from without.  After a few minutes\nand gestures they went inside, shutting the glass doors upon the garden;\nand the garden seemed to grow grayer still.\n\nThe American gentleman named Pym seemed to be turning and on the move\nin the same direction; but before he started he spoke to Rosamund with a\nflash of that guileless tact which redeemed much of his childish vanity,\nand with something of that spontaneous poetry which made it difficult,\npedantic as he was, to call him a pedant.\n\n\"I'm vurry sorry, Miss Hunt,\" he said; \"but Dr. Warner and I,\nas two quali-FIED practitioners, had better take Mr. Smith\naway in that cab, and the less said about it the better.\nDon't you agitate yourself, Miss Hunt.  You've just got to think\nthat we're taking away a monstrosity, something that oughtn't to be\nat all--something like one of those gods in your Britannic Museum,\nall wings, and beards, and legs, and eyes, and no shape.\nThat's what Smith is, and you shall soon be quit of him.\"\n\nHe had already taken a step towards the house, and Warner was about\nto follow him, when the glass doors were opened again and Diana Duke\ncame out with more than her usual quickness across the lawn.\nHer face was aquiver with worry and excitement, and her dark earnest\neyes fixed only on the other girl.\n\n\"Rosamund,\" she cried in despair, \"what shall I do with her?\"\n\n\"With her?\" cried Miss Hunt, with a violent jump.  \"O lord,\nhe isn't a woman too, is he?\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Dr. Pym soothingly, as if in common fairness.\n\"A woman? no, really, he is not so bad as that.\"\n\n\"I mean your friend Mary Gray,\" retorted Diana with equal tartness.\n\"What on earth am I to do with her?\"\n\n\"How can we tell her about Smith, you mean,\" answered Rosamund, her face\nat once clouded and softening.  \"Yes, it will be pretty painful.\"\n\n\"But I HAVE told her,\" exploded Diana, with more than her\ncongenital exasperation.  \"I have told her, and she doesn't seem to mind.\nShe still says she's going away with Smith in that cab.\"\n\n\"But it's impossible!\" ejaculated Rosamund.  \"Why, Mary is\nreally religious.  She--\"\n\nShe stopped in time to realize that Mary Gray was comparatively\nclose to her on the lawn.  Her quiet companion had come down very\nquietly into the garden, but dressed very decisively for travel.\nShe had a neat but very ancient blue tam-o'-shanter on her head,\nand was pulling some rather threadbare gray gloves on to her hands.\nYet the two tints fitted excellently with her heavy copper-coloured hair;\nthe more excellently for the touch of shabbiness:  for a woman's clothes\nnever suit her so well as when they seem to suit her by accident.\n\nBut in this case the woman had a quality yet more unique and attractive.\nIn such gray hours, when the sun is sunk and the skies are\nalready sad, it will often happen that one reflection at some\noccasional angle will cause to linger the last of the light.\nA scrap of window, a scrap of water, a scrap of looking-glass,\nwill be full of the fire that is lost to all the rest of the earth.\nThe quaint, almost triangular face of Mary Gray was like some\ntriangular piece of mirror that could still repeat the splendour\nof hours before.  Mary, though she was always graceful,\ncould never before have properly been called beautiful; and yet\nher happiness amid all that misery was so beautiful as to make\na man catch his breath.\n\n\"O Diana,\" cried Rosamund in a lower voice and altering her phrase;\n\"but how did you tell her?\"\n\n\"It is quite easy to tell her,\" answered Diana sombrely;\n\"it makes no impression at all.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I've kept everything waiting,\" said Mary Gray apologetically,\n\"and now we must really say good-bye. Innocent is taking me to his aunt's\nover at Hampstead, and I'm afraid she goes to bed early.\"\n\nHer words were quite casual and practical, but there was a sort\nof sleepy light in her eyes that was more baffling than darkness;\nshe was like one speaking absently with her eye on some\nvery distant object.\n\n\"Mary, Mary,\" cried Rosamund, almost breaking down, \"I'm so sorry about it,\nbut the thing can't be at all.  We--we have found out all about Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"All?\" repeated Mary, with a low and curious intonation;\n\"why, that must be awfully exciting.\"\n\nThere was no noise for an instant and no motion except that\nthe silent Michael Moon, leaning on the gate, lifted his head,\nas it might be to listen.  Then Rosamund remaining speechless,\nDr. Pym came to her rescue in a definite way.\n\n\"To begin with,\" he said, \"this man Smith is constantly attempting murder.\nThe Warden of Brakespeare College--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mary, with a vague but radiant smile.\n\"Innocent told me.\"\n\n\"I can't say what he told you,\" replied Pym quickly, \"but I'm very much\nafraid it wasn't true.  The plain truth is that the man's stained\nwith every known human crime.  I assure you I have all the documents.\nI have evidence of his committing burglary, signed by a most eminent\nEnglish curate.  I have--\"\n\n\"Oh, but there were two curates,\" cried Mary, with a certain gentle eagerness;\n\"that was what made it so much funnier.\"\n\nThe darkened glass doors of the house opened once more,\nand Inglewood appeared for an instant, making a sort of signal.\nThe American doctor bowed, the English doctor did not,\nbut they both set out stolidly towards the house.\nNo one else moved, not even Michael hanging on the gate;\nbut the back of his head and shoulders had still an indescribable\nindication that he was listening to every word.\n\n\"But don't you understand, Mary,\" cried Rosamund in despair; \"don't you\nknow that awful things have happened even before our very eyes.\nI should have thought you would have heard the revolver shots upstairs.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard the shots,\" said Mary almost brightly; \"but I was busy packing\njust then.  And Innocent had told me he was going to shoot at Dr. Warner;\nso it wasn't worth while to come down.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't understand what you mean,\" cried Rosamund Hunt,\nstamping, \"but you must and shall understand what I mean.\nI don't care how cruelly I put it, if only I can save you.\nI mean that your Innocent Smith is the most awfully wicked\nman in the world.  He has sent bullets at lots of other men\nand gone off in cabs with lots of other women.  And he seems\nto have killed the women too, for nobody can find them.\"\n\n\"He is really rather naughty sometimes,\" said Mary Gray,\nlaughing softly as she buttoned her old gray gloves.\n\n\"Oh, this is really mesmerism, or something,\" said Rosamund,\nand burst into tears.\n\nAt the same moment the two black-clad doctors appeared out\nof the house with their great green-clad captive between them.\nHe made no resistance, but was still laughing in a groggy\nand half-witted style.  Arthur Inglewood followed in the rear,\na dark and red study in the last shades of distress and shame.\nIn this black, funereal, and painfully realistic style the exit\nfrom Beacon House was made by a man whose entrance a day before\nhad been effected by the happy leaping of a wall and the hilarious\nclimbing of a tree.  No one moved of the groups in the garden\nexcept Mary Gray, who stepped forward quite naturally,\ncalling out, \"Are you ready, Innocent?  Our cab's been waiting\nsuch a long time.\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Dr. Warner firmly, \"I must insist on asking\nthis lady to stand aside.  We shall have trouble enough as it is,\nwith the three of us in a cab.\"\n\n\"But it IS our cab,\" persisted Mary.  \"Why, there's Innocent's yellow\nbag on the top of it.\"\n\n\"Stand aside,\" repeated Warner roughly.  \"And you, Mr. Moon,\nplease be so obliging as to move a moment.  Come, come! the sooner\nthis ugly business is over the better--and how can we open the gate\nif you will keep leaning on it?\"\n\nMichael Moon looked at his long lean forefinger, and seemed\nto consider and reconsider this argument.  \"Yes,\" he said at last;\n\"but how can I lean on this gate if you keep on opening it?\"\n\n\"Oh, get out of the way!\" cried Warner, almost good-humouredly.\n\"You can lean on the gate any time.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Moon reflectively.  \"Seldom the time and the place\nand the blue gate altogether; and it all depends whether you\ncome of an old country family.  My ancestors leaned on gates\nbefore any one had discovered how to open them.\"\n\n\"Michael!\" cried Arthur Inglewood in a kind of agony, \"are you going to get\nout of the way?\"\n\n\"Why, no; I think not,\" said Michael, after some meditation,\nand swung himself slowly round, so that he confronted the company,\nwhile still, in a lounging attitude, occupying the path.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he called out suddenly; \"what are you doing to Mr. Smith?\"\n\n\"Taking him away,\" answered Warner shortly, \"to be examined.\"\n\n\"Matriculation?\" asked Moon brightly.\n\n\"By a magistrate,\" said the other curtly.\n\n\"And what other magistrate,\" cried Michael, raising his voice,\n\"dares to try what befell on this free soil, save only the ancient\nand independent Dukes of Beacon?  What other court dares to try\none of our company, save only the High Court of Beacon?  Have you\nforgotten that only this afternoon we flew the flag of independence\nand severed ourselves from all the nations of the earth?\"\n\n\"Michael,\" cried Rosamund, wringing her hands, \"how can you stand\nthere talking nonsense?  Why, you saw the dreadful thing yourself.\nYou were there when he went mad.  It was you that helped the doctor\nup when he fell over the flower-pot.\"\n\n\"And the High Court of Beacon,\" replied Moon with hauteur,\n\"has special powers in all cases concerning lunatics,\nflower-pots, and doctors who fall down in gardens.\nIt's in our very first charter from Edward I:  `Si medicus\nquisquam in horto prostratus--'\"\n\n\"Out of the way!\" cried Warner with sudden fury, \"or we will force\nyou out of it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Michael Moon, with a cry of hilarious fierceness.\n\"Shall I die in defence of this sacred pale?  Will you paint\nthese blue railings red with my gore?\" and he laid hold of one\nof the blue spikes behind him.  As Inglewood had noticed earlier\nin the evening, the railing was loose and crooked at this place,\nand the painted iron staff and spearhead came away in Michael's\nhand as he shook it.\n\n\"See!\" he cried, brandishing this broken javelin in the air,\n\"the very lances round Beacon Tower leap from their places to defend it.\nAh, in such a place and hour it is a fine thing to die alone!\"\nAnd in a voice like a drum he rolled the noble lines of Ronsard--\n\n\"Ou pour l'honneur de Dieu, ou pour le droit de mon prince, Navre,\npoitrine ouverte, au bord de mon province.\"\n\n\n\"Sakes alive!\" said the American gentleman, almost in an awed tone.\nThen he added, \"Are there two maniacs here?\"\n\n\"No; there are five,\" thundered Moon.  \"Smith and I are the only\nsane people left.\"\n\n\"Michael!\" cried Rosamund; \"Michael, what does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means bosh!\" roared Michael, and slung his painted spear\nhurtling to the other end of the garden.  \"It means that doctors\nare bosh, and criminology is bosh, and Americans are bosh--\nmuch more bosh than our Court of Beacon.  It means, you fatheads,\nthat Innocent Smith is no more mad or bad than the bird\non that tree.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Moon,\" began Inglewood in his modest manner, \"these gentlemen--\"\n\n\"On the word of two doctors,\" exploded Moon again,\nwithout listening to anybody else, \"shut up in a private hell\non the word of two doctors!  And such doctors!  Oh, my hat!\nLook at 'em!--do just look at 'em!  Would you read a book,\nor buy a dog, or go to a hotel on the advice of twenty such?\nMy people came from Ireland, and were Catholics.  What would\nyou say if I called a man wicked on the word of two priests?\"\n\n\"But it isn't only their word, Michael,\" reasoned Rosamund;\n\"they've got evidence too.\"\n\n\"Have you looked at it?\" asked Moon.\n\n\"No,\" said Rosamund, with a sort of faint surprise; \"these gentlemen\nare in charge of it.\"\n\n\"And of everything else, it seems to me,\" said Michael.  \"Why, you\nhaven't even had the decency to consult Mrs. Duke.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's no use,\" said Diana in an undertone to Rosamund; \"Auntie can't\nsay `Bo!' to a goose.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" answered Michael, \"for with such a flock of geese\nto say it to, the horrid expletive might be constantly on her lips.\nFor my part, I simply refuse to let things be done in this light\nand airy style.  I appeal to Mrs. Duke--it's her house.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Duke?\" repeated Inglewood doubtfully.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Duke,\" said Michael firmly, \"commonly called the Iron Duke.\"\n\n\"If you ask Auntie,\" said Diana quietly, \"she'll only be for doing nothing\nat all.  Her only idea is to hush things up or to let things slide.\nThat just suits her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Michael Moon; \"and, as it happens, it just suits\nall of us.  You are impatient with your elders, Miss Duke;\nbut when you are as old yourself you will know what Napoleon knew--\nthat half one's letters answer themselves if you can only refrain\nfrom the fleshly appetite of answering them.\"\n\nHe was still lounging in the same absurd attitude, with his elbow\non the grate, but his voice had altered abruptly for the third time;\njust as it had changed from the mock heroic to the humanly indignant,\nit now changed to the airy incisiveness of a lawyer giving\ngood legal advice.\n\n\"It isn't only your aunt who wants to keep this quiet if\nshe can,\" he said; \"we all want to keep it quiet if we can.\nLook at the large facts--the big bones of the case.  I believe\nthose scientific gentlemen have made a highly scientific mistake.\nI believe Smith is as blameless as a buttercup.  I admit\nbuttercups don't often let off loaded pistols in private houses;\nI admit there is something demanding explanation.\nBut I am morally certain there's some blunder, or some joke,\nor some allegory, or some accident behind all this.\nWell, suppose I'm wrong.  We've disarmed him; we're five men\nto hold him; he may as well go to a lock-up later on as now.\nBut suppose there's even a chance of my being right.\nIs it anybody's interest here to wash this linen in public?\n\n\"Come, I'll take each of you in order.  Once take Smith outside that gate,\nand you take him into the front page of the evening papers.  I know;\nI've written the front page myself.  Miss Duke, do you or your aunt want\na sort of notice stuck up over your boarding-house--`Doctors shot here.'?\nNo, no--doctors are rubbish, as I said; but you don't want the rubbish\nshot here.  Arthur, suppose I am right, or suppose I am wrong.\nSmith has appeared as an old schoolfellow of yours.  Mark my words,\nif he's proved guilty, the Organs of Public Opinion will say you\nintroduced him.  If he's proved innocent, they will say you helped\nto collar him.  Rosamund, my dear, suppose I am right or wrong.\nIf he's proved guilty, they'll say you engaged your companion to him.\nIf he's proved innocent, they'll print that telegram.\nI know the Organs, damn them.\"\n\nHe stopped an instant; for this rapid rationalism left him more\nbreathless than had either his theatrical or his real denunciation.\nBut he was plainly in earnest, as well as positive and lucid;\nas was proved by his proceeding quickly the moment he had\nfound his breath.\n\n\"It is just the same,\" he cried, \"with our medical friends.\nYou will say that Dr. Warner has a grievance.  I agree.\nBut does he want specially to be snapshotted by all the\njournalists ~prostratus in horto~? It was no fault of his,\nbut the scene was not very dignified even for him.\nHe must have justice; but does he want to ask for justice,\nnot only on his knees, but on his hands and knees?\nDoes he want to enter the court of justice on all fours?\nDoctors are not allowed to advertise; and I'm sure no\ndoctor wants to advertise himself as looking like that.\nAnd even for our American guest the interest is the same.\nLet us suppose that he has conclusive documents.\nLet us assume that he has revelations really worth reading.\nWell, in a legal inquiry (or a medical inquiry, for that matter)\nten to one he won't be allowed to read them.  He'll be tripped\nup every two or three minutes with some tangle of old rules.\nA man can't tell the truth in public nowadays.  But he can\nstill tell it in private; he can tell it inside that house.\"\n\n\"It is quite true,\" said Dr. Cyrus Pym, who had listened throughout\nthe speech with a seriousness which only an American could have retained\nthrough such a scene.  \"It is true that I have been per-ceptibly less\nhampered in private inquiries.\"\n\n\"Dr. Pym!\" cried Warner in a sort of sudden anger.\n\"Dr. Pym! you aren't really going to admit--\"\n\n\"Smith may be mad,\" went on the melancholy Moon in a monologue\nthat seemed as heavy as a hatchet, \"but there was something\nafter all in what he said about Home Rule for every home.\nYes, there is something, when all's said and done, in the High Court\nof Beacon.  It is really true that human beings might often get\nsome sort of domestic justice where just now they can only get\nlegal injustice--oh, I am a lawyer too, and I know that as well.\nIt is true that there's too much official and indirect power.\nOften and often the thing a whole nation can't settle is just the thing\na family could settle.  Scores of young criminals have been fined\nand sent to jail when they ought to have been thrashed and sent to bed.\nScores of men, I am sure, have had a lifetime at Hanwell when they\nonly wanted a week at Brighton.  There IS something in Smith's\nnotion of domestic self-government; and I propose that we put it\ninto practice.  You have the prisoner; you have the documents.\nCome, we are a company of free, white, Christian people,\nsuch as might be besieged in a town or cast up on a desert island.\nLet us do this thing ourselves.  Let us go into that house there\nand sit down and find out with our own eyes and ears whether this\nthing is true or not; whether this Smith is a man or a monster.\nIf we can't do a little thing like that, what right have we to put\ncrosses on ballot papers?\"\n\nInglewood and Pym exchanged a glance; and Warner, who was no fool,\nsaw in that glance that Moon was gaining ground.  The motives that led\nArthur to think of surrender were indeed very different from those\nwhich affected Dr. Cyrus Pym.  All Arthur's instincts were on the side\nof privacy and polite settlement; he was very English and would often\nendure wrongs rather than right them by scenes and serious rhetoric.\nTo play at once the buffoon and the knight-errant, like his Irish friend,\nwould have been absolute torture to him; but even the semi-official\npart he had played that afternoon was very painful.  He was not likely\nto be reluctant if any one could convince him that his duty was to let\nsleeping dogs lie.\n\nOn the other hand, Cyrus Pym belonged to a country in which things are\npossible that seem crazy to the English.  Regulations and authorities exactly\nlike one of Innocent's pranks or one of Michael's satires really exist,\npropped by placid policemen and imposed on bustling business men.\nPym knew whole States which are vast and yet secret and fanciful;\neach is as big as a nation yet as private as a lost village, and as\nunexpected as an apple-pie bed.  States where no man may have a cigarette,\nStates where any man may have ten wives, very strict prohibition States,\nvery lax divorce States--all these large local vagaries had prepared\nCyrus Pym's mind for small local vagaries in a smaller country.\nInfinitely more remote from England than any Russian or Italian,\nutterly incapable of even conceiving what English conventions are,\nhe could not see the social impossibility of the Court of Beacon.  It is\nfirmly believed by those who shared the experiment, that to the very\nend Pym believed in that phantasmal court and supposed it to be\nsome Britannic institution.\n\nTowards the synod thus somewhat at a standstill there approached\nthrough the growing haze and gloaming a short dark figure with a walk\napparently founded on the imperfect repression of a negro breakdown.\nSomething at once in the familiarity and the incongruity of this\nbeing moved Michael to even heartier outbursts of a healthy\nand humane flippancy.\n\n\"Why, here's little Nosey Gould,\" he exclaimed.  \"Isn't the mere\nsight of him enough to banish all your morbid reflections?\"\n\n\"Really,\" replied Dr. Warner, \"I really fail to see how Mr. Gould\naffects the question; and I once more demand--\"\n\n\"Hello! what's the funeral, gents?\" inquired the newcomer with the air\nof an uproarious umpire.  \"Doctor demandin' something?  Always the way\nat a boarding-house, you know.  Always lots of demand.  No supply.\"\n\nAs delicately and impartially as he could, Michael restated his position,\nand indicated generally that Smith had been guilty of certain dangerous\nand dubious acts, and that there had even arisen an allegation that\nhe was insane.\n\n\"Well, of course he is,\" said Moses Gould equably; \"it don't\nneed old 'Olmes to see that.  The 'awk-like face of 'Olmes,\"\nhe added with abstract relish, \"showed a shide of disappointment,\nthe sleuth-like Gould 'avin' got there before 'im.\"\n\n\"If he is mad,\" began Inglewood.\n\n\"Well,\" said Moses, \"when a cove gets out on the tile the first night\nthere's generally a tile loose.\"\n\n\"You never objected before,\" said Diana Duke rather stiffly,\n\"and you're generally pretty free with your complaints.\"\n\n\"I don't compline of him,\" said Moses magnanimously, \"the poor chap's\n'armless enough; you might tie 'im up in the garden here and 'e'd\nmake noises at the burglars.\"\n\n\"Moses,\" said Moon with solemn fervour, \"you are the incarnation\nof Common Sense.  You think Mr. Innocent is mad.  Let me introduce you\nto the incarnation of Scientific Theory.  He also thinks Mr. Innocent\nis mad.--Doctor, this is my friend Mr. Gould.--Moses, this is the celebrated\nDr. Pym.\"  The celebrated Dr. Cyrus Pym closed his eyes and bowed.\nHe also murmured his national war-cry in a low voice, which sounded\nlike \"Pleased to meet you.\"\n\n\"Now you two people,\" said Michael cheerfully, \"who both think our poor\nfriend mad, shall jolly well go into that house over there and prove him mad.\nWhat could be more powerful than the combination of Scientific Theory\nwith Common Sense?  United you stand; divided you fall.  I will not be\nso uncivil as to suggest that Dr. Pym has no common sense; I confine myself\nto recording the chronological accident that he has not shown us any so far.\nI take the freedom of an old friend in staking my shirt that Moses has no\nscientific theory.  Yet against this strong coalition I am ready to appear,\narmed with nothing but an intuition--which is American for a guess.\"\n\n\"Distinguished by Mr. Gould's assistance,\" said Pym, opening his\neyes suddenly.  \"I gather that though he and I are identical\nin primary di-agnosis there is yet between us something that\ncannot be called a disagreement, something which we may perhaps\ncall a--\" He put the points of thumb and forefinger together,\nspreading the other fingers exquisitely in the air, and seemed\nto be waiting for somebody else to tell him what to say.\n\n\"Catchin' flies?\" inquired the affable Moses.\n\n\"A divergence,\" said Dr. Pym, with a refined sigh of relief; \"a divergence.\nGranted that the man in question is deranged, he would not necessarily\nbe all that science requires in a homicidal maniac--\"\n\n\"Has it occurred to you,\" observed Moon, who was leaning on the gate again,\nand did not turn round, \"that if he were a homicidal maniac he might have\nkilled us all here while we were talking.\"\n\nSomething exploded silently underneath all their minds,\nlike sealed dynamite in some forgotten cellars.  They all\nremembered for the first time for some hour or two that the monster\nof whom they were talking was standing quietly among them.\nThey had left him in the garden like a garden statue; there might\nhave been a dolphin coiling round his legs, or a fountain pouring out\nof his mouth, for all the notice they had taken of Innocent Smith.\nHe stood with his crest of blonde, blown hair thrust somewhat forward,\nhis fresh-coloured, rather short-sighted face looking patiently\ndownwards at nothing in particular, his huge shoulders humped,\nand his hands in his trousers pockets.  So far as they could guess\nhe had not moved at all.  His green coat might have been cut out\nof the green turf on which he stood.  In his shadow Pym had expounded\nand Rosamund expostulated, Michael had ranted and Moses had ragged.\nHe had remained like a thing graven; the god of the garden.\nA sparrow had perched on one of his heavy shoulders; and then,\nafter correcting its costume of feathers, had flown away.\n\n\"Why,\" cried Michael, with a shout of laughter, \"the Court of Beacon\nhas opened--and shut up again too.  You all know now I am right.\nYour buried common sense has told you what my buried common sense has\ntold me.  Smith might have fired off a hundred cannons instead of a pistol,\nand you would still know he was harmless as I know he is harmless.\nBack we all go to the house and clear a room for discussion.\nFor the High Court of Beacon, which has already arrived at its decision,\nis just about to begin its inquiry.\"\n\n\"Just a goin' to begin!\" cried little Mr. Moses in an extraordinary\nsort of disinterested excitement, like that of an animal during music\nor a thunderstorm.  \"Follow on to the 'Igh Court of Eggs and Bacon;\n'ave a kipper from the old firm!  'Is Lordship complimented\nMr. Gould on the 'igh professional delicacy 'e had shown,\nand which was worthy of the best traditions of the Saloon Bar--\nand three of Scotch hot, miss!  Oh, chase me, girls!\"\n\nThe girls betraying no temptation to chase him, he went away in a\nsort of waddling dance of pure excitement; and had made a circuit\nof the garden before he reappeared, breathless but still beaming.\nMoon had known his man when he realized that no people presented\nto Moses Gould could be quite serious, even if they were\nquite furious.  The glass doors stood open on the side nearest\nto Mr. Moses Gould; and as the feet of that festive idiot were\nevidently turned in the same direction, everybody else went\nthat way with the unanimity of some uproarious procession.\nOnly Diana Duke retained enough rigidity to say the thing that had\nbeen boiling at her fierce feminine lips for the last few hours.\nUnder the shadow of tragedy she had kept it back as unsympathetic.\n\"In that case,\" she said sharply, \"these cabs can be sent away.\"\n\n\"Well, Innocent must have his bag, you know,\" said Mary with a smile.\n\"I dare say the cabman would get it down for us.\"\n\n\"I'll get the bag,\" said Smith, speaking for the first time in hours;\nhis voice sounded remote and rude, like the voice of a statue.\n\nThose who had so long danced and disputed round his immobility\nwere left breathless by his precipitance.  With a run and spring\nhe was out of the garden into the street; with a spring and\none quivering kick he was actually on the roof of the cab.\nThe cabman happened to be standing by the horse's head, having just\nremoved its emptied nose-bag. Smith seemed for an instant to be\nrolling about on the cab's back in the embraces of his Gladstone bag.\nThe next instant, however, he had rolled, as if by a royal luck,\ninto the high seat behind, and with a shriek of piercing and\nappalling suddenness had sent the horse flying and scampering\ndown the street.\n\nHis evanescence was so violent and swift, that this time it\nwas all the other people who were turned into garden statues.\nMr. Moses Gould, however, being ill-adapted both physically and morally\nfor the purposes of permanent sculpture, came to life some time before\nthe rest, and, turning to Moon, remarked, like a man starting chattily\nwith a stranger on an omnibus, \"Tile loose, eh?  Cab loose anyhow.\"\nThere followed a fatal silence; and then Dr. Warner said, with a sneer\nlike a club of stone,--\n\n\"This is what comes of the Court of Beacon, Mr. Moon.  You have let\nloose a maniac on the whole metropolis.\"\n\nBeacon House stood, as has been said, at the end of a long crescent\nof continuous houses.  The little garden that shut it in ran out into\na sharp point like a green cape pushed out into the sea of two streets.\nSmith and his cab shot up one side of the triangle, and certainly\nmost of those standing inside of it never expected to see him again.\nAt the apex, however, he turned the horse sharply round and drove with equal\nviolence up the other side of the garden, visible to all those in the group.\nWith a common impulse the little crowd ran across the lawn as if to stop him,\nbut they soon had reason to duck and recoil.  Even as he vanished up\nstreet for the second time, he let the big yellow bag fly from his hand,\nso that it fell in the centre of the garden, scattering the company\nlike a bomb, and nearly damaging Dr. Warner's hat for the third time.\nLong before they had collected themselves, the cab had shot away with a\nshriek that went into a whisper.\n\n\"Well,\" said Michael Moon, with a queer note in his voice;\n\"you may as well all go inside anyhow.  We've got two relics\nof Mr. Smith at least; his fiancee and his trunk.\"\n\n\"Why do you want us to go inside?\" asked Arthur Inglewood,\nin whose red brow and rough brown hair botheration seemed\nto have reached its limit.\n\n\"I want the rest to go in,\" said Michael in a clear voice,\n\"because I want the whole of this garden in which to talk to you.\"\n\nThere was an atmosphere of irrational doubt; it was really getting colder,\nand a night wind had begun to wave the one or two trees in the twilight.\nDr. Warner, however, spoke in a voice devoid of indecision.\n\n\"I refuse to listen to any such proposal,\" he said; \"you have lost\nthis ruffian, and I must find him.\"\n\n\"I don't ask you to listen to any proposal,\" answered Moon quietly;\n\"I only ask you to listen.\"\n\nHe made a silencing movement with his hand, and immediately\nthe whistling noise that had been lost in the dark streets on one side\nof the house could be heard from quite a new quarter on the other side.\nThrough the night-maze of streets the noise increased with incredible\nrapidity, and the next moment the flying hoofs and flashing wheels had\nswept up to the blue-railed gate at which they had originally stood.\nMr. Smith got down from his perch with an air of absent-mindedness,\nand coming back into the garden stood in the same elephantine\nattitude as before.\n\n\"Get inside! get inside!\" cried Moon hilariously, with the air\nof one shooing a company of cats.  \"Come, come, be quick about it!\nDidn't I tell you I wanted to talk to Inglewood?\"\n\nHow they were all really driven into the house again it would\nhave been difficult afterwards to say.  They had reached the point\nof being exhausted with incongruities, as people at a farce\nare ill with laughing, and the brisk growth of the storm among\nthe trees seemed like a final gesture of things in general.\nInglewood lingered behind them, saying with a certain amicable\nexasperation, \"I say, do you really want to speak to me?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Michael, \"very much.\"\n\nNight had come as it generally does, quicker than the twilight had seemed\nto promise.  While the human eye still felt the sky as light gray, a very\nlarge and lustrous moon appearing abruptly above a bulk of roofs and trees,\nproved by contrast that the sky was already a very dark gray indeed.\nA drift of barren leaves across the lawn, a drift of riven clouds across\nthe sky, seemed to be lifted on the same strong and yet laborious wind.\n\n\"Arthur,\" said Michael, \"I began with an intuition; but now I am sure.\nYou and I are going to defend this friend of yours before the blessed Court\nof Beacon, and to clear him too--clear him of both crime and lunacy.\nJust listen to me while I preach to you for a bit.\"  They walked up\nand down the darkening garden together as Michael Moon went on.\n\n\"Can you,\" asked Michael, \"shut your eyes and see some of those queer old\nhieroglyphics they stuck up on white walls in the old hot countries.\nHow stiff they were in shape and yet how gaudy in colour.\nThink of some alphabet of arbitrary figures picked out in black and red,\nor white and green, with some old Semitic crowd of Nosey Gould's\nancestors staring at it, and try to think why the people put it\nup at all.\"\n\nInglewood's first instinct was to think that his perplexing friend\nhad really gone off his head at last; there seemed so reckless\na flight of irrelevancy from the tropic-pictured walls he was\nasked to imagine to the gray, wind-swept, and somewhat chilly\nsuburban garden in which he was actually kicking his heels.\nHow he could be more happy in one by imagining the other he could\nnot conceive.  Both (in themselves) were unpleasant.\n\n\"Why does everybody repeat riddles,\" went on Moon abruptly,\n\"even if they've forgotten the answers?  Riddles are easy to remember\nbecause they are hard to guess.  So were those stiff old symbols\nin black, red, or green easy to remember because they had been hard\nto guess.  Their colours were plain.  Their shapes were plain.\nEverything was plain except the meaning.\"\n\nInglewood was about to open his mouth in an amiable protest, but Moon\nwent on, plunging quicker and quicker up and down the garden and smoking\nfaster and faster.  \"Dances, too,\" he said; \"dances were not frivolous.\nDances were harder to understand than inscriptions and texts.\nThe old dances were stiff, ceremonial, highly coloured but silent.\nHave you noticed anything odd about Smith?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" cried Inglewood, left behind in a collapse of humour,\n\"have I noticed anything else?\"\n\n\"Have you noticed this about him,\" asked Moon, with unshaken persistency,\n\"that he has done so much and said so little?  When first he came he talked,\nbut in a gasping, irregular sort of way, as if he wasn't used to it.\nAll he really did was actions--painting red flowers on black gowns or throwing\nyellow bags on to the grass.  I tell you that big green figure is figurative--\nlike any green figure capering on some white Eastern wall.\"\n\n\"My dear Michael,\" cried Inglewood, in a rising irritation which increased\nwith the rising wind, \"you are getting absurdly fanciful.\"\n\n\"I think of what has just happened,\" said Michael steadily.\n\"The man has not spoken for hours; and yet he has been speaking\nall the time.  He fired three shots from a six-shooter and then\ngave it up to us, when he might have shot us dead in our boots.\nHow could he express his trust in us better than that?\nHe wanted to be tried by us.  How could he have shown it better\nthan by standing quite still and letting us discuss it?\nHe wanted to show that he stood there willingly,\nand could escape if he liked.  How could he have shown it\nbetter than by escaping in the cab and coming back again?\nInnocent Smith is not a madman--he is a ritualist.  He wants to\nexpress himself, not with his tongue, but with his arms and legs--\nwith my body I thee worship, as it says in the marriage service.\nI begin to understand the old plays and pageants.  I see why\nthe mutes at a funeral were mute.  I see why the mummers were mum.\nThey MEANT something; and Smith means something too.\nAll other jokes have to be noisy--like little Nosey Gould's jokes,\nfor instance.  The only silent jokes are the practical jokes.\nPoor Smith, properly considered, is an allegorical practical joker.\nWhat he has really done in this house has been as frantic\nas a war-dance, but as silent as a picture.\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean,\" said the other dubiously, \"that we have got to find out\nwhat all these crimes meant, as if they were so many coloured picture-puzzles.\nBut even supposing that they do mean something--why, Lord bless my soul!--\"\n\nTaking the turn of the garden quite naturally, he had lifted\nhis eyes to the moon, by this time risen big and luminous,\nand had seen a huge, half-human figure sitting on the garden wall.\nIt was outlined so sharply against the moon that for the first flash\nit was hard to be certain even that it was human:  the hunched\nshoulders and outstanding hair had rather the air of a colossal cat.\nIt resembled a cat also in the fact that when first startled it\nsprang up and ran with easy activity along the top of the wall.\nAs it ran, however, its heavy shoulders and small stooping head\nrather suggested a baboon.  The instant it came within reach\nof a tree it made an ape-like leap and was lost in the branches.\nThe gale, which by this time was shaking every shrub in the garden,\nmade the identification yet more difficult, since it melted\nthe moving limbs of the fugitive in the multitudinous moving\nlimbs of the tree.\n\n\"Who is there?\" shouted Arthur.  \"Who are you?  Are you Innocent?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" answered an obscure voice among the leaves.\n\"I cheated you once about a penknife.\"\n\nThe wind in the garden had gathered strength, and was throwing the tree\nbackwards and forwards with the man in the thick of it, just as it\nhad on the gay and golden afternoon when he had first arrived.\n\n\"But are you Smith?\" asked Inglewood as in an agony.\n\n\"Very nearly,\" said the voice out of the tossing tree.\n\n\"But you must have some real names,\" shrieked Inglewood in despair.\n\"You must call yourself something.\"\n\n\"Call myself something,\" thundered the obscure voice, shaking the tree\nso that all its ten thousand leaves seemed to be talking at once.\n\"I call myself Roland Oliver Isaiah Charlemagne Arthur Hildebrand\nHomer Danton Michaelangelo Shakespeare Brakespeare--\"\n\n\"But, manalive!\" began Inglewood in exasperation.\n\n\"That's right! that's right!\" came with a roar out of the rocking tree;\n\"that's my real name.\"  And he broke a branch, and one or two autumn\nleaves fluttered away across the moon.\n\n\n\n\n                           Part II\n\n             The Explanations of Innocent Smith\n\n\n\n\n                          Chapter I\n\n                      The Eye of Death;\n                    or, the Murder Charge\n\n\nThe dining-room of the Dukes had been set out for the Court\nof Beacon with a certain impromptu pomposity that seemed somehow\nto increase its cosiness.  The big room was, as it were,\ncut up into small rooms, with walls only waist high--the sort\nof separation that children make when they are playing at shops.\nThis had been done by Moses Gould and Michael Moon\n(the two most active members of this remarkable inquiry)\nwith the ordinary furniture of the place.  At one end of the long\nmahogany table was set the one enormous garden chair, which was\nsurmounted by the old torn tent or umbrella which Smith himself\nhad suggested as a coronation canopy.  Inside this erection\ncould be perceived the dumpy form of Mrs. Duke, with cushions\nand a form of countenance that already threatened slumber.\nAt the other end sat the accused Smith, in a kind of dock;\nfor he was carefully fenced in with a quadrilateral of light\nbedroom chairs, any of which he could have tossed out the window\nwith his big toe.  He had been provided with pens and paper,\nout of the latter of which he made paper boats, paper darts,\nand paper dolls contentedly throughout the whole proceedings.\nHe never spoke or even looked up, but seemed as unconscious\nas a child on the floor of an empty nursery.\n\nOn a row of chairs raised high on the top of a long settee sat\nthe three young ladies with their backs up against the window,\nand Mary Gray in the middle; it was something between a jury\nbox and the stall of the Queen of Beauty at a tournament.\nDown the centre of the long table Moon had built a low barrier\nout of eight bound volumes of \"Good Words\" to express the moral\nwall that divided the conflicting parties.  On the right side\nsat the two advocates of the prosecution, Dr. Pym and Mr. Gould;\nbehind a barricade of books and documents, chiefly (in the case\nof Dr. Pym) solid volumes of criminology.  On the other side,\nMoon and Inglewood, for the defence, were also fortified\nwith books and papers; but as these included several old yellow\nvolumes by Ouida and Wilkie Collins, the hand of Mr. Moon\nseemed to have been somewhat careless and comprehensive.\nAs for the victim and prosecutor, Dr. Warner, Moon wanted at first\nto have him kept entirely behind a high screen in the corner,\nurging the indelicacy of his appearance in court, but privately\nassuring him of an unofficial permission to peep over the top\nnow and then.  Dr. Warner, however, failed to rise to the chivalry\nof such a course, and after some little disturbance and discussion\nhe was accommodated with a seat on the right side of the table\nin a line with his legal advisers.\n\nIt was before this solidly-established tribunal that Dr. Cyrus Pym,\nafter passing a hand through the honey-coloured hair over each ear,\nrose to open the case.  His statement was clear and even restrained,\nand such flights of imagery as occurred in it only attracted attention\nby a certain indescribable abruptness, not uncommon in the flowers\nof American speech.\n\nHe planted the points of his ten frail fingers on the mahogany,\nclosed his eyes, and opened his mouth.  \"The time has gone by,\"\nhe said, \"when murder could be regarded as a moral and individual act,\nimportant perhaps to the murderer, perhaps to the murdered.\nScience has profoundly...\" here he paused, poising his compressed\nfinger and thumb in the air as if he were holding an elusive idea\nvery tight by its tail, then he screwed up his eyes and said\n\"modified,\" and let it go--\"has profoundly Modified our view of death.\nIn superstitious ages it was regarded as the termination of life,\ncatastrophic, and even tragic, and was often surrounded by solemnity.\nBrighter days, however, have dawned, and we now see death as universal\nand inevitable, as part of that great soul-stirring and heart-upholding\naverage which we call for convenience the order of nature.\nIn the same way we have come to consider murder SOCIALLY.\nRising above the mere private feelings of a man while being forcibly\ndeprived of life, we are privileged to behold murder as a mighty whole,\nto see the rich rotation of the cosmos, bringing, as it brings\nthe golden harvests and the golden-bearded harvesters, the return\nfor ever of the slayers and the slain.\"\n\nHe looked down, somewhat affected with his own eloquence, coughed slightly,\nputting up four of his pointed fingers with the excellent manners\nof Boston, and continued:  \"There is but one result of this happier\nand humaner outlook which concerns the wretched man before us.\nIt is that thoroughly elucidated by a Milwaukee doctor,\nour great secret-guessing Sonnenschein, in his great work,\n`The Destructive Type.'  We do not denounce Smith as a murderer,\nbut rather as a murderous man.  The type is such that its very life--\nI might say its very health--is in killing.  Some hold that it is\nnot properly an aberration, but a newer and even a higher creature.\nMy dear old friend Dr. Bulger, who kept ferrets--\" (here Moon\nsuddenly ejaculated a loud \"hurrah!\" but so instantaneously\nresumed his tragic expression that Mrs. Duke looked everywhere\nelse for the sound); Dr. Pym continued somewhat sternly--\"who,\nin the interests of knowledge, kept ferrets, felt that the creature's\nferocity is not utilitarian, but absolutely an end in itself.\nHowever this may be with ferrets, it is certainly so with the prisoner.\nIn his other iniquities you may find the cunning of the maniac;\nbut his acts of blood have almost the simplicity of sanity.\nBut it is the awful sanity of the sun and the elements--a cruel,\nan evil sanity.  As soon stay the iris-leapt cataracts of our virgin\nWest as stay the natural force that sends him forth to slay.\nNo environment, however scientific, could have softened him.\nPlace that man in the silver-silent purity of the palest cloister,\nand there will be some deed of violence done with the crozier or the alb.\nRear him in a happy nursery, amid our brave-browed Anglo-Saxon infancy,\nand he will find some way to strangle with the skipping-rope\nor brain with the brick.  Circumstances may be favourable,\ntraining may be admirable, hopes may be high, but the huge elemental\nhunger of Innocent Smith for blood will in its appointed season\nburst like a well-timed bomb.\"\n\nArthur Inglewood glanced curiously for an instant at the huge creature\nat the foot of the table, who was fitting a paper figure with a cocked hat,\nand then looked back at Dr. Pym, who was concluding in a quieter tone.\n\n\"It only remains for us,\" he said, \"to bring forward actual evidence\nof his previous attempts.  By an agreement already made with the Court\nand the leaders of the defence, we are permitted to put in evidence authentic\nletters from witnesses to these scenes, which the defence is free to examine.\nOut of several cases of such outrages we have decided to select one--\nthe clearest and most scandalous.  I will therefore, without further delay,\ncall on my junior, Mr. Gould, to read two letters--one from the Sub-Warden and\nthe other from the porter of Brakespeare College, in Cambridge University.\"\n\nGould jumped up with a jerk like a jack-in-the-box, an academic-looking\npaper in his hand and a fever of importance on his face.\nHe began in a loud, high, cockney voice that was as abrupt\nas a cock-crow:--\n\n\n\"Sir,--Hi am the Sub-Warden of Brikespeare College, Cambridge--\"\n\n\n\"Lord have mercy on us,\" muttered Moon, making a backward movement as men\ndo when a gun goes off.\n\n\n\"Hi am the Sub-Warden of Brikespeare College, Cambridge,\"\nproclaimed the uncompromising Moses, \"and I can endorse the description\nyou gave of the un'appy Smith.  It was not alone my unfortunate duty\nto rebuke many of the lesser violences of his undergraduate period,\nbut I was actually a witness to the last iniquity which terminated\nthat period.  Hi happened to passing under the house of my friend\nthe Warden of Brikespeare, which is semi-detached from the College\nand connected with it by two or three very ancient arches or props,\nlike bridges, across a small strip of water connected with the river.\nTo my grive astonishment I be'eld my eminent friend suspended in mid-air\nand clinging to one of these pieces of masonry, his appearance and\nattitude indicatin' that he suffered from the grivest apprehensions.\nAfter a short time I heard two very loud shots, and distinctly perceived\nthe unfortunate undergraduate Smith leaning far out of the Warden's\nwindow and aiming at the Warden repeatedly with a revolver.\nUpon seeing me, Smith burst into a loud laugh (in which\nimpertinence was mingled with insanity), and appeared to desist.\nI sent the college porter for a ladder, and he succeeded in detaching\nthe Warden from his painful position.  Smith was sent down.\nThe photograph I enclose is from the group of the University Rifle Club\nprizemen, and represents him as he was when at the College.--\nHi am, your obedient servant, Amos Boulter.\n\n\n\"The other letter,\" continued Gould in a glow of triumph, \"is from the porter,\nand won't take long to read.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir,--It is quite true that I am the porter of Brikespeare College,\nand that I 'elped the Warden down when the young man was shooting at him,\nas Mr. Boulter has said in his letter.  The young man who was shooting at\nhim was Mr. Smith, the same that is in the photograph Mr. Boulter sends.--\nYours respectfully, Samuel Barker.\"\n\n\nGould handed the two letters across to Moon, who examined them.\nBut for the vocal divergences in the matter of h's and a's,\nthe Sub-Warden's letter was exactly as Gould had rendered it;\nand both that and the porter's letter were plainly genuine.\nMoon handed them to Inglewood, who handed them back in silence\nto Moses Gould.\n\n\"So far as this first charge of continual attempted murder is concerned,\"\nsaid Dr. Pym, standing up for the last time, \"that is my case.\"\n\nMichael Moon rose for the defence with an air of depression which gave\nlittle hope at the outset to the sympathizers with the prisoner.\nHe did not, he said, propose to follow the doctor into the\nabstract questions.  \"I do not know enough to be an agnostic,\"\nhe said, rather wearily, \"and I can only master the known and admitted\nelements in such controversies.  As for science and religion,\nthe known and admitted facts are plain enough.  All that the parsons\nsay is unproved.  All that the doctors say is disproved.\nThat's the only difference between science and religion there's ever been,\nor will be.  Yet these new discoveries touch me, somehow,\" he said,\nlooking down sorrowfully at his boots.  \"They remind me of a dear\nold great-aunt of mine who used to enjoy them in her youth.\nIt brings tears to my eyes.  I can see the old bucket by the garden\nfence and the line of shimmering poplars behind--\"\n\n\"Hi! here, stop the 'bus a bit,\" cried Mr. Moses Gould, rising in a sort\nof perspiration.  \"We want to give the defence a fair run--like gents,\nyou know; but any gent would draw the line at shimmering poplars.\"\n\n\"Well, hang it all,\" said Moon, in an injured manner, \"if Dr. Pym\nmay have an old friend with ferrets, why mayn't I have an old\naunt with poplars?\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" said Mrs. Duke, bridling, with something almost\nlike a shaky authority, \"Mr. Moon may have what aunts he likes.\"\n\n\"Why, as to liking her,\" began Moon, \"I--but perhaps,\nas you say, she is scarcely the core of the question.\nI repeat that I do not mean to follow the abstract speculations.\nFor, indeed, my answer to Dr. Pym is simple and severely concrete.\nDr. Pym has only treated one side of the psychology of murder.\nIf it is true that there is a kind of man who has a natural\ntendency to murder, is it not equally true\"--here he lowered\nhis voice and spoke with a crushing quietude and earnestness--\"is\nit not equally true that there is a kind of man who has\na natural tendency to get murdered?  Is it not at least\na hypothesis holding the field that Dr. Warner is such a man?\nI do not speak without the book, any more than my learned friend.\nThe whole matter is expounded in Dr. Moonenschein's monumental work,\n`The Destructible Doctor,' with diagrams, showing the various ways\nin which such a person as Dr. Warner may be resolved into his elements.\nIn the light of these facts--\"\n\n\"Hi, stop the 'bus! stop the 'bus!\" cried Moses, jumping up and down and\ngesticulating in great excitement.  \"My principal's got something to say!\nMy principal wants to do a bit of talkin'.\"\n\nDr. Pym was indeed on his feet, looking pallid and rather vicious.\n\"I have strictly CON-fined myself,\" he said nasally,\n\"to books to which immediate reference can be made.\nI have Sonnenschein's `Destructive Type' here on the table,\nif the defence wish to see it.  Where is this wonderful work\non Destructability Mr. Moon is talking about?  Does it exist?\nCan he produce it?\"\n\n\"Produce it!\" cried the Irishman with a rich scorn.\n\"I'll produce it in a week if you'll pay for the ink and paper.\"\n\n\"Would it have much authority?\" asked Pym, sitting down.\n\n\"Oh, authority!\" said Moon lightly; \"that depends on a fellow's religion.\"\n\nDr. Pym jumped up again.  \"Our authority is based on masses\nof accurate detail,\" he said.  \"It deals with a region in which\nthings can be handled and tested.  My opponent will at least\nadmit that death is a fact of experience.\"\n\n\"Not of mine,\" said Moon mournfully, shaking his head.\n\"I've never experienced such a thing in all my life.\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said Dr. Pym, and sat down sharply amid a crackle of papers.\n\n\"So we see,\" resumed Moon, in the same melancholy voice, \"that a\nman like Dr. Warner is, in the mysterious workings of evolution,\ndoomed to such attacks.  My client's onslaught, even if it occurred,\nwas not unique.  I have in my hand letters from more than one acquaintance\nof Dr. Warner whom that remarkable man has affected in the same way.\nFollowing the example of my learned friends I will read only two of them.\nThe first is from an honest and laborious matron living off the Harrow Road.\n\n\n\"Mr. Moon, Sir,--Yes, I did throw a sorsepan at him.  Wot then?\nIt was all I had to throw, all the soft things being porned,\nand if your Docter Warner doesn't like having sorsepans thrown at him,\ndon't let him wear his hat in a respectable woman's parler, and tell\nhim to leave orf smiling or tell us the joke.--Yours respectfully,\n                                               Hannah Miles.\n\n\n\"The other letter is from a physician of some note in Dublin,\nwith whom Dr. Warner was once engaged in consultation.\nHe writes as follows:--\n\n\n\"Dear Sir,--The incident to which you refer is one which I regret,\nand which, moreover, I have never been able to explain.\nMy own branch of medicine is not mental; and I should be glad to have\nthe view of a mental specialist on my singular momentary and indeed\nalmost automatic action.  To say that I `pulled Dr. Warner's nose,'\nis, however, inaccurate in a respect that strikes me as important.\nThat I punched his nose I must cheerfully admit (I need not say with\nwhat regret); but pulling seems to me to imply a precision of objective\nwith which I cannot reproach myself.  In comparison with this, the act\nof punching was an outward, instantaneous, and even natural gesture.--\nBelieve me, yours faithfully, Burton Lestrange.\n\n\n\"I have numberless other letters,\" continued Moon, \"all bearing witness\nto this widespread feeling about my eminent friend; and I therefore think\nthat Dr. Pym should have admitted this side of the question in his survey.\nWe are in the presence, as Dr. Pym so truly says, of a natural force.\nAs soon stay the cataract of the London water-works as stay\nthe great tendency of Dr. Warner to be assassinated by somebody.\nPlace that man in a Quakers' meeting, among the most peaceful of Christians,\nand he will immediately be beaten to death with sticks of chocolate.\nPlace him among the angels of the New Jerusalem, and he will be stoned\nto death with precious stones.  Circumstances may be beautiful and wonderful,\nthe average may be heart-upholding, the harvester may be golden-bearded,\nthe doctor may be secret-guessing, the cataract may be iris-leapt,\nthe Anglo-Saxon infant may be brave-browed, but against and above\nall these prodigies the grand simple tendency of Dr. Warner to get\nmurdered will still pursue its way until it happily and triumphantly\nsucceeds at last.\"\n\nHe pronounced this peroration with an appearance of strong emotion.\nBut even stronger emotions were manifesting themselves on the other\nside of the table.  Dr. Warner had leaned his large body quite across\nthe little figure of Moses Gould and was talking in excited whispers\nto Dr. Pym.  That expert nodded a great many times and finally started\nto his feet with a sincere expression of sternness.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried indignantly, \"as my colleague has said,\nwe should be delighted to give any latitude to the defence--if there\nwere a defence.  But Mr. Moon seems to think he is there to make jokes--\nvery good jokes I dare say, but not at all adapted to assist his client.\nHe picks holes in science.  He picks holes in my client's social popularity.\nHe picks holes in my literary style, which doesn't seem to suit his high-toned\nEuropean taste.  But how does this picking of holes affect the issue?\nThis Smith has picked two holes in my client's hat, and with an inch better\naim would have picked two holes in his head.  All the jokes in the world\nwon't unpick those holes or be any use for the defence.\"\n\nInglewood looked down in some embarrassment, as if shaken by the evident\nfairness of this, but Moon still gazed at his opponent in a dreamy way.\n\"The defence?\" he said vaguely--\"oh, I haven't begun that yet.\"\n\n\"You certainly have not,\" said Pym warmly, amid a murmur of applause\nfrom his side, which the other side found it impossible to answer.\n\"Perhaps, if you have any defence, which has been doubtful from\nthe very beginning--\"\n\n\"While you're standing up,\" said Moon, in the same almost sleepy style,\n\"perhaps I might ask you a question.\"\n\n\"A question?  Certainly,\" said Pym stiffly.  \"It was distinctly\narranged between us that as we could not cross-examine\nthe witnesses, we might vicariously cross-examine each other.\nWe are in a position to invite all such inquiry.\"\n\n\"I think you said,\" observed Moon absently, \"that none of the prisoner's\nshots really hit the doctor.\"\n\n\"For the cause of science,\" cried the complacent Pym, \"fortunately not.\"\n\n\"Yet they were fired from a few feet away.\"\n\n\"Yes; about four feet.\"\n\n\"And no shots hit the Warden, though they were fired quite close\nto him too?\" asked Moon.\n\n\"That is so,\" said the witness gravely.\n\n\"I think,\" said Moon, suppressing a slight yawn, \"that your Sub-Warden\nmentioned that Smith was one of the University's record men for shooting.\"\n\n\"Why, as to that--\" began Pym, after an instant of stillness.\n\n\"A second question,\" continued Moon, comparatively curtly.\n\"You said there were other cases of the accused trying to kill people.\nWhy have you not got evidence of them?\"\n\nThe American planted the points of his fingers on the table again.\n\"In those cases,\" he said precisely, \"there was no evidence from outsiders,\nas in the Cambridge case, but only the evidence of the actual victims.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you get their evidence?\"\n\n\"In the case of the actual victims,\" said Pym, \"there was some difficulty\nand reluctance, and--\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" asked Moon, \"that none of the actual victims would\nappear against the prisoner?\"\n\n\"That would be exaggerative,\" began the other.\n\n\"A third question,\" said Moon, so sharply that every one jumped.\n\"You've got the evidence of the Sub-Warden who heard some shots;\nwhere's the evidence of the Warden himself who was shot at?\nThe Warden of Brakespeare lives, a prosperous gentleman.\"\n\n\"We did ask for a statement from him,\" said Pym a little nervously;\n\"but it was so eccentrically expressed that we suppressed it out\nof deference to an old gentleman whose past services to science\nhave been great.\"\n\nMoon leaned forward.  \"You mean, I suppose,\" he said, \"that his statement\nwas favourable to the prisoner.\"\n\n\"It might be understood so,\" replied the American doctor;\n\"but, really, it was difficult to understand at all.\nIn fact, we sent it back to him.\"\n\n\"You have no longer, then, any statement signed by the Warden of Brakespeare.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I only ask,\" said Michael quietly, \"because we have.\nTo conclude my case I will ask my junior, Mr. Inglewood,\nto read a statement of the true story--a statement attested\nas true by the signature of the Warden himself.\"\n\nArthur Inglewood rose with several papers in his hand, and though\nhe looked somewhat refined and self-effacing, as he always did,\nthe spectators were surprised to feel that his presence was,\nupon the whole, more efficient and sufficing than his leader's. He was,\nin truth, one of those modest men who cannot speak until they are told\nto speak; and then can speak well.  Moon was entirely the opposite.\nHis own impudences amused him in private, but they slightly\nembarrassed him in public; he felt a fool while he was speaking,\nwhereas Inglewood felt a fool only because he could not speak.\nThe moment he had anything to say he could speak;\nand the moment he could speak, speaking seemed quite natural.\nNothing in this universe seemed quite natural to Michael Moon.\n\n\"As my colleague has just explained,\" said Inglewood, \"there are\ntwo enigmas or inconsistencies on which we base the defence.\nThe first is a plain physical fact.  By the admission of everybody,\nby the very evidence adduced by the prosecution, it is clear\nthat the accused was celebrated as a specially good shot.\nYet on both the occasions complained of he shot from a distance of four\nor five feet, and shot at him four or five times, and never hit him once.\nThat is the first startling circumstance on which we base our argument.\nThe second, as my colleague has urged, is the curious fact that we cannot\nfind a single victim of these alleged outrages to speak for himself.\nSubordinates speak for him.  Porters climb up ladders to him.\nBut he himself is silent.  Ladies and gentlemen, I propose to explain\non the spot both the riddle of the shots and the riddle of the silence.\nI will first of all read the covering letter in which the true account\nof the Cambridge incident is contained, and then that document itself.\nWhen you have heard both, there will be no doubt about your decision.\nThe covering letter runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"Dear Sir,--The following is a very exact and even vivid account of the\nincident as it really happened at Brakespeare College.  We, the undersigned,\ndo not see any particular reason why we should refer it to any\nisolated authorship.  The truth is, it has been a composite production;\nand we have even had some difference of opinion about the adjectives.\nBut every word of it is true.--We are, yours faithfully,\n\n                                     \"Wilfred Emerson Eames,\n                  \"Warden of Brakespeare College, Cambridge.\n\n                                            \"Innocent Smith.\n\n\n\"The enclosed statement,\" continued Inglewood, \"runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"A celebrated English university backs so abruptly on the river,\nthat it has, so to speak, to be propped up and patched\nwith all sorts of bridges and semi-detached buildings.\nThe river splits itself into several small streams and canals,\nso that in one or two corners the place has almost the look\nof Venice.  It was so especially in the case with which we\nare concerned, in which a few flying buttresses or airy ribs of stone\nsprang across a strip of water to connect Brakespeare College\nwith the house of the Warden of Brakespeare.\n\n\"The country around these colleges is flat; but it does not\nseem flat when one is thus in the midst of the colleges.\nFor in these flat fens there are always wandering lakes and lingering\nrivers of water.  And these always change what might have been\na scheme of horizontal lines into a scheme of vertical lines.\nWherever there is water the height of high buildings is doubled,\nand a British brick house becomes a Babylonian tower.\nIn that shining unshaken surface the houses hang head\ndownwards exactly to their highest or lowest chimney.\nThe coral-coloured cloud seen in that abyss is as far\nbelow the world as its original appears above it.\nEvery scrap of water is not only a window but a skylight.\nEarth splits under men's feet into precipitous aerial perspectives,\ninto which a bird could as easily wing its way as--\"\n\nDr. Cyrus Pym rose in protest.  The documents he had put\nin evidence had been confined to cold affirmation of fact.\nThe defence, in a general way, had an indubitable right to put\ntheir case in their own way, but all this landscape gardening\nseemed to him (Dr. Cyrus Pym) to be not up to the business.\n\"Will the leader of the defence tell me,\" he asked, \"how it can\npossibly affect this case, that a cloud was cor'l-coloured,\nor that a bird could have winged itself anywhere?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Michael, lifting himself lazily;\n\"you see, you don't know yet what our defence is.\nTill you know that, don't you see, anything may be relevant.\nWhy, suppose,\" he said suddenly, as if an idea had struck him,\n\"suppose we wanted to prove the old Warden colour-blind.\nSuppose he was shot by a black man with white hair, when he\nthought he was being shot by a white man with yellow hair!\nTo ascertain if that cloud was really and truly coral-coloured\nmight be of the most massive importance.\"\n\nHe paused with a seriousness which was hardly generally shared,\nand continued with the same fluency:  \"Or suppose we wanted to\nmaintain that the Warden committed suicide--that he just got Smith\nto hold the pistol as Brutus's slave held the sword.  Why, it would\nmake all the difference whether the Warden could see himself plain\nin still water.  Still water has made hundreds of suicides:\none sees oneself so very--well, so very plain.\"\n\n\"Do you, perhaps,\" inquired Pym with austere irony, \"maintain that\nyour client was a bird of some sort--say, a flamingo?\"\n\n\"In the matter of his being a flamingo,\" said Moon with sudden severity,\n\"my client reserves his defence.\"\n\nNo one quite knowing what to make of this, Mr. Moon resumed his seat\nand Inglewood resumed the reading of his document:--\n\n\n\"There is something pleasing to a mystic in such a land of mirrors.\nFor a mystic is one who holds that two worlds are better than one.\nIn the highest sense, indeed, all thought is reflection.\n\n\"This is the real truth, in the saying that second thoughts are best.\nAnimals have no second thoughts; man alone is able to see his own\nthought double, as a drunkard sees a lamp-post; man alone is able\nto see his own thought upside down as one sees a house in a puddle.\nThis duplication of mentality, as in a mirror, is (we repeat)\nthe inmost thing of human philosophy.  There is a mystical, even a\nmonstrous truth, in the statement that two heads are better than one.\nBut they ought both to grow on the same body.\"\n\n\n\"I know it's a little transcendental at first,\" interposed Inglewood,\nbeaming round with a broad apology, \"but you see this document was written\nin collaboration by a don and a--\"\n\n\"Drunkard, eh?\" suggested Moses Gould, beginning to enjoy himself.\n\n\"I rather think,\" proceeded Inglewood with an unruffled\nand critical air, \"that this part was written by the don.\nI merely warn the Court that the statement, though indubitably accurate,\nbears here and there the trace of coming from two authors.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Dr. Pym, leaning back and sniffing,\n\"I cannot agree with them that two heads are better than one.\"\n\n\n\"The undersigned persons think it needless to touch on a kindred\nproblem so often discussed at committees for University Reform:\nthe question of whether dons see double because they are drunk,\nor get drunk because they see double.  It is enough for them\n(the undersigned persons) if they are able to pursue their own peculiar\nand profitable theme--which is puddles.  What (the undersigned\npersons ask themselves) is a puddle?  A puddle repeats infinity,\nand is full of light; nevertheless, if analyzed objectively,\na puddle is a piece of dirty water spread very thin on mud.\nThe two great historic universities of England have all this large\nand level and reflective brilliance.  Nevertheless, or, rather, on the\nother hand, they are puddles--puddles, puddles, puddles, puddles.\nThe undersigned persons ask you to excuse an emphasis inseparable\nfrom strong conviction.\"\n\n\nInglewood ignored a somewhat wild expression on the faces of some present,\nand continued with eminent cheerfulness:--\n\n\n\"Such were the thoughts that failed to cross the mind of\nthe undergraduate Smith as he picked his way among the stripes\nof canal and the glittering rainy gutters into which the water\nbroke up round the back of Brakespeare College.  Had these thoughts\ncrossed his mind he would have been much happier than he was.\nUnfortunately he did not know that his puzzles were puddles.\nHe did not know that the academic mind reflects infinity and is full\nof light by the simple process of being shallow and standing still.\nIn his case, therefore, there was something solemn, and even evil\nabout the infinity implied.  It was half-way through a starry\nnight of bewildering brilliancy; stars were both above and below.\nTo young Smith's sullen fancy the skies below seemed even hollower\nthan the skies above; he had a horrible idea that if he counted\nthe stars he would find one too many in the pool.\n\n\"In crossing the little paths and bridges he felt like one stepping\non the black and slender ribs of some cosmic Eiffel Tower.  For to him,\nand nearly all the educated youth of that epoch, the stars were cruel things.\nThough they glowed in the great dome every night, they were an enormous\nand ugly secret; they uncovered the nakedness of nature; they were a glimpse\nof the iron wheels and pulleys behind the scenes.  For the young men\nof that sad time thought that the god always comes from the machine.\nThey did not know that in reality the machine only comes from the god.\nIn short, they were all pessimists, and starlight was atrocious to them--\natrocious because it was true.  All their universe was black with white spots.\n\n\"Smith looked up with relief from the glittering pools below\nto the glittering skies and the great black bulk of the college.\nThe only light other than stars glowed through one peacock-green\ncurtain in the upper part of the building, marking where\nDr. Emerson Eames always worked till morning and received\nhis friends and favourite pupils at any hour of the night.\nIndeed, it was to his rooms that the melancholy Smith was bound.\nSmith had been at Dr. Eames's lecture for the first half of the morning,\nand at pistol practice and fencing in a saloon for the second half.\nHe had been sculling madly for the first half of the afternoon\nand thinking idly (and still more madly) for the second half.\nHe had gone to a supper where he was uproarious, and on to a debating\nclub where he was perfectly insufferable, and the melancholy\nSmith was melancholy still.  Then, as he was going home to his\ndiggings he remembered the eccentricity of his friend and master,\nthe Warden of Brakespeare, and resolved desperately to turn\nin to that gentleman's private house.\n\n\"Emerson Eames was an eccentric in many ways, but his throne\nin philosophy and metaphysics was of international eminence;\nthe university could hardly have afforded to lose him, and, moreover,\na don has only to continue any of his bad habits long enough\nto make them a part of the British Constitution.  The bad habits\nof Emerson Eames were to sit up all night and to be a student\nof Schopenhauer.  Personally, he was a lean, lounging sort of man,\nwith a blond pointed beard, not so very much older than his\npupil Smith in the matter of mere years, but older by centuries\nin the two essential respects of having a European reputation\nand a bald head.\n\n\"`I came, against the rules, at this unearthly hour,' said Smith, who was\nnothing to the eye except a very big man trying to make himself small,\n`because I am coming to the conclusion that existence is really too rotten.\nI know all the arguments of the thinkers that think otherwise--bishops,\nand agnostics, and those sort of people.  And knowing you were the greatest\nliving authority on the pessimist thinkers--'\n\n\"`All thinkers,' said Eames, `are pessimist thinkers.'\n\n\"After a patch of pause, not the first--for this depressing conversation\nhad gone on for some hours with alternations of cynicism and silence--\nthe Warden continued with his air of weary brilliancy:  `It's all a question\nof wrong calculation.  The moth flies into the candle because he doesn't\nhappen to know that the game is not worth the candle.  The wasp gets\ninto the jam in hearty and hopeful efforts to get the jam into him.\nIN the same way the vulgar people want to enjoy life just as they want\nto enjoy gin--because they are too stupid to see that they are paying too big\na price for it.  That they never find happiness--that they don't even know\nhow to look for it--is proved by the paralyzing clumsiness and ugliness\nof everything they do.  Their discordant colours are cries of pain.\nLook at the brick villas beyond the college on this side of the river.\nThere's one with spotted blinds; look at it! just go and look at it!'\n\n\"`Of course,' he went on dreamily, `one or two men see the sober\nfact a long way off--they go mad.  Do you notice that maniacs mostly\ntry either to destroy other things, or (if they are thoughtful)\nto destroy themselves?  The madman is the man behind the scenes,\nlike the man that wanders about the coulisse of a theater.\nHe has only opened the wrong door and come into the right place.\nHe sees things at the right angle.  But the common world--'\n\n\"`Oh, hang the common world!' said the sullen Smith, letting his fist\nfall on the table in an idle despair.\n\n\"`Let's give it a bad name first,' said the Professor calmly,\n`and then hang it.  A puppy with hydrophobia would probably struggle\nfor life while we killed it; but if we were kind we should kill it.\nSo an omniscient god would put us out of our pain.\nHe would strike us dead.'\n\n\"`Why doesn't he strike us dead?' asked the undergraduate abstractedly,\nplunging his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"`He is dead himself,' said the philosopher; `that is where\nhe is really enviable.'\n\n\"`To any one who thinks,' proceeded Eames, `the pleasures of life,\ntrivial and soon tasteless, are bribes to bring us into a torture chamber.\nWe all see that for any thinking man mere extinction is the... What\nare you doing?... Are you mad?... Put that thing down.'\n\n\"Dr. Eames had turned his tired but still talkative head over his shoulder,\nand had found himself looking into a small round black hole, rimmed by a\nsix-sided circlet of steel, with a sort of spike standing up on the top.\nIt fixed him like an iron eye.  Through those eternal instants during\nwhich the reason is stunned he did not even know what it was.\nThen he saw behind it the chambered barrel and cocked hammer of\na revolver, and behind that the flushed and rather heavy face of Smith,\napparently quite unchanged, or even more mild than before.\n\n\"`I'll help you out of your hole, old man,' said Smith,\nwith rough tenderness.  `I'll put the puppy out of his pain.'\n\n\"Emerson Eames retreated towards the window.  `Do you mean\nto kill me?' he cried.\n\n\"`It's not a thing I'd do for every one,' said Smith with emotion;\n`but you and I seem to have got so intimate to-night, somehow.\nI know all your troubles now, and the only cure, old chap.'\n\n\"`Put that thing down,' shouted the Warden.\n\n\"`It'll soon be over, you know,' said Smith with the air of a\nsympathetic dentist.  And as the Warden made a run for the window\nand balcony, his benefactor followed him with a firm step\nand a compassionate expression.\n\n\"Both men were perhaps surprised to see that the gray and white\nof early daybreak had already come.  One of them, however,\nhad emotions calculated to swallow up surprise.  Brakespeare College\nwas one of the few that retained real traces of Gothic ornament,\nand just beneath Dr. Eames's balcony there ran out what had perhaps\nbeen a flying buttress, still shapelessly shaped into gray beasts\nand devils, but blinded with mosses and washed out with rains.\nWith an ungainly and most courageous leap, Eames sprang out on this\nantique bridge, as the only possible mode of escape from the maniac.\nHe sat astride of it, still in his academic gown, dangling his\nlong thin legs, and considering further chances of flight.\nThe whitening daylight opened under as well as over him that\nimpression of vertical infinity already remarked about the little\nlakes round Brakespeare.  Looking down and seeing the spires\nand chimneys pendent in the pools, they felt alone in space.\nThey felt as if they were looking over the edge from the North Pole\nand seeing the South Pole below.\n\n\"`Hang the world, we said,' observed Smith, `and the world is hanged.\n\"He has hanged the world upon nothing,\" says the Bible.  Do you like being\nhanged upon nothing?  I'm going to be hanged upon something myself.\nI'm going to swing for you... Dear, tender old phrase,' he murmured;\n`never true till this moment.  I am going to swing for you.\nFor you, dear friend.  For your sake.  At your express desire.'\n\n\"`Help!' cried the Warden of Brakespeare College; `help!'\n\n\"`The puppy struggles,' said the undergraduate, with an eye of pity,\n`the poor puppy struggles.  How fortunate it is that I am wiser\nand kinder than he,' and he sighted his weapon so as exactly to cover\nthe upper part of Eames's bald head.\n\n\"`Smith,' said the philosopher with a sudden change to a sort\nof ghastly lucidity, `I shall go mad.'\n\n\"`And so look at things from the right angle,' observed Smith,\nsighing gently.  `Ah, but madness is only a palliative at best,\na drug.  The only cure is an operation--an operation that is\nalways successful:  death.'\n\n\"As he spoke the sun rose.  It seemed to put colour into everything,\nwith the rapidity of a lightning artist.  A fleet of little\nclouds sailing across the sky changed from pigeon-gray to pink.\nAll over the little academic town the tops of different buildings\ntook on different tints:  here the sun would pick out the green\nenameled on a pinnacle, there the scarlet tiles of a villa;\nhere the copper ornament on some artistic shop, and there\nthe sea-blue slates of some old and steep church roof.\nAll these coloured crests seemed to have something oddly\nindividual and significant about them, like crests of famous\nknights pointed out in a pageant or a battlefield:  they each\narrested the eye, especially the rolling eye of Emerson Eames\nas he looked round on the morning and accepted it as his last.\nThrough a narrow chink between a black timber tavern and a big\ngray college he could see a clock with gilt hands which the\nsunshine set on fire.  He stared at it as though hypnotized;\nand suddenly the clock began to strike, as if in personal reply.\nAs if at a signal, clock after clock took up the cry:\nall the churches awoke like chickens at cockcrow.\nThe birds were already noisy in the trees behind the college.\nThe sun rose, gathering glory that seemed too full for the deep\nskies to hold, and the shallow waters beneath them seemed golden\nand brimming and deep enough for the thirst of the gods.\nJust round the corner of the College, and visible from his crazy perch,\nwere the brightest specks on that bright landscape, the villa\nwith the spotted blinds which he had made his text that night.\nHe wondered for the first time what people lived in them.\n\n\"Suddenly he called out with mere querulous authority,\nas he might have called to a student to shut a door.\n\n\"`Let me come off this place,' he cried; `I can't bear it.'\n\n\"`I rather doubt if it will bear you,' said Smith critically;\n`but before you break your neck, or I blow out your brains,\nor let you back into this room (on which complex points I\nam undecided) I want the metaphysical point cleared up.\nDo I understand that you want to get back to life?'\n\n\"`I'd give anything to get back,' replied the unhappy professor.\n\n\"`Give anything!' cried Smith; `then, blast your impudence,\ngive us a song!'\n\n\"`What song do you mean?' demanded the exasperated Eames; `what song?'\n\n\"`A hymn, I think, would be most appropriate,' answered the other gravely.\n`I'll let you off if you'll repeat after me the words--\n\n        \"`I thank the goodness and the grace\n            That on my birth have smiled.\n          And perched me on this curious place,\n            A happy English child.'\n\n\n\"Dr. Emerson Eames having briefly complied, his persecutor abruptly\ntold him to hold his hands up in the air.  Vaguely connecting this\nproceeding with the usual conduct of brigands and bushrangers,\nMr. Eames held them up, very stiffly, but without marked surprise.\nA bird alighting on his stone seat took no more notice of him\nthan of a comic statue.\n\n\"`You are now engaged in public worship,' remarked Smith severely,\n`and before I have done with you, you shall thank God for the very ducks\non the pond.'\n\n\"The celebrated pessimist half articulately expressed his perfect\nreadiness to thank God for the ducks on the pond.\n\n\"`Not forgetting the drakes,' said Smith sternly.\n(Eames weakly conceded the drakes.) `Not forgetting anything, please.\nYou shall thank heaven for churches and chapels and villas\nand vulgar people and puddles and pots and pans and sticks\nand rags and bones and spotted blinds.'\n\n\"`All right, all right,' repeated the victim in despair;\n`sticks and rags and bones and blinds.'\n\n\"`Spotted blinds, I think we said,' remarked Smith with a\nrogueish ruthlessness, and wagging the pistol-barrel at him\nlike a long metallic finger.\n\n\"`Spotted blinds,' said Emerson Eames faintly.\n\n\"`You can't say fairer than that,' admitted the younger man,\n`and now I'll just tell you this to wind up with.\nIf you really were what you profess to be, I don't see that it\nwould matter to snail or seraph if you broke your impious stiff\nneck and dashed out all your drivelling devil-worshipping brains.\nBut in strict biographical fact you are a very nice fellow,\naddicted to talking putrid nonsense, and I love you like a brother.\nI shall therefore fire off all my cartridges round your head\nso as not to hit you (I am a good shot, you may be glad to hear),\nand then we will go in and have some breakfast.'\n\n\"He then let off two barrels in the air, which the Professor\nendured with singular firmness, and then said, `But don't fire\nthem all off.'\n\n\"`Why not' asked the other buoyantly.\n\n\"`Keep them,' asked his companion, `for the next man you meet\nwho talks as we were talking.'\n\n\"It was at this moment that Smith, looking down, perceived apoplectic\nterror upon the face of the Sub-Warden, and heard the refined shriek\nwith which he summoned the porter and the ladder.\n\n\"It took Dr. Eames some little time to disentangle himself from\nthe ladder, and some little time longer to disentangle himself\nfrom the Sub-Warden. But as soon as he could do so unobtrusively,\nhe rejoined his companion in the late extraordinary scene.\nHe was astonished to find the gigantic Smith heavily shaken,\nand sitting with his shaggy head on his hands.  When addressed,\nhe lifted a very pale face.\n\n\"`Why, what is the matter?' asked Eames, whose own nerves had by this\ntime twittered themselves quiet, like the morning birds.\n\n\"`I must ask your indulgence,' said Smith, rather brokenly.\n`I must ask you to realize that I have just had an escape from death.'\n\n\"`YOU have had an escape from death?' repeated the Professor\nin not unpardonable irritation.  `Well, of all the cheek--'\n\n\"`Oh, don't you understand, don't you understand?' cried the pale\nyoung man impatiently.  `I had to do it, Eames; I had to prove\nyou wrong or die.  When a man's young, he nearly always has\nsome one whom he thinks the top-water mark of the mind of man--\nsome one who knows all about it, if anybody knows.\n\n\"`Well, you were that to me; you spoke with authority,\nand not as the scribes.  Nobody could comfort me if YOU\nsaid there was no comfort.  If you really thought there was\nnothing anywhere, it was because you had been there to see.\nDon't you see that I HAD to prove you didn't really mean it?--\nor else drown myself in the canal.'\n\n\"`Well,' said Eames hesitatingly, `I think perhaps you confuse--'\n\n\"`Oh, don't tell me that!' cried Smith with the sudden clairvoyance\nof mental pain; `don't tell me I confuse enjoyment of existence\nwith the Will to Live!  That's German, and German is High Dutch,\nand High Dutch is Double Dutch.  The thing I saw shining in your eyes\nwhen you dangled on that bridge was enjoyment of life and not \"the\nWill to Live.\"  What you knew when you sat on that damned gargoyle\nwas that the world, when all is said and done, is a wonderful and\nbeautiful place; I know it, because I knew it at the same minute.\nI saw the gray clouds turn pink, and the little gilt clock in the crack\nbetween the houses.  It was THOSE things you hated leaving, not Life,\nwhatever that is.  Eames, we've been to the brink of death together;\nwon't you admit I'm right?'\n\n\"`Yes,' said Eames very slowly, `I think you are right.\nYou shall have a First!'\n\n\"`Right!' cried Smith, springing up reanimated.  `I've passed\nwith honours, and now let me go and see about being sent down.'\n\n\"`You needn't be sent down,' said Eames with the quiet confidence\nof twelve years of intrigue.  `Everything with us comes from\nthe man on top to the people just round him:  I am the man on top,\nand I shall tell the people round me the truth.'\n\n\"The massive Mr. Smith rose and went firmly to the window,\nbut he spoke with equal firmness.  `I must be sent down,' he said,\n`and the people must not be told the truth.'\n\n\"`And why not' asked the other.\n\n\"`Because I mean to follow your advice,' answered the massive youth,\n`I mean to keep the remaining shots for people in the shameful state\nyou and I were in last night--I wish we could even plead drunkenness.\nI mean to keep those bullets for pessimists--pills for pale people.\nAnd in this way I want to walk the world like a wonderful surprise--\nto float as idly as the thistledown, and come as silently as the sunrise;\nnot to be expected any more than the thunderbolt, not to be\nrecalled any more than the dying breeze.  I don't want people to\nanticipate me as a well-known practical joke.  I want both my gifts\nto come virgin and violent, the death and the life after death.\nI am going to hold a pistol to the head of the Modern Man.  But I\nshall not use it to kill him--only to bring him to life.\nI begin to see a new meaning in being the skeleton at the feast.'\n\n\"`You can scarcely be called a skeleton,' said Dr. Eames, smiling.\n\n\"`That comes of being so much at the feast,' answered the massive youth.\n`No skeleton can keep his figure if he is always dining out.\nBut that is not quite what I meant:  what I mean is that I caught\na kind of glimpse of the meaning of death and all that--the skull\nand cross-bones, the ~memento mori~. It isn't only meant to remind\nus of a future life, but to remind us of a present life too.\nWith our weak spirits we should grow old in eternity if we were not kept\nyoung by death.  Providence has to cut immortality into lengths for us,\nas nurses cut the bread and butter into fingers.'\n\n\"Then he added suddenly in a voice of unnatural actuality,\n`But I know something now, Eames.  I knew it when I saw\nthe clouds turn pink.'\n\n\"`What do you mean?' asked Eames.  `What did you know?'\n\n\"`I knew for the first time that murder is really wrong.'\n\n\"He gripped Dr. Eames's hand and groped his way somewhat unsteadily\nto the door.  Before he had vanished through it he had added,\n`It's very dangerous, though, when a man thinks for a split second\nthat he understands death.'\n\n\"Dr. Eames remained in repose and rumination some hours after his\nlate assailant had left.  Then he rose, took his hat and umbrella,\nand went for a brisk if rotatory walk.  Several times,\nhowever, he stood outside the villa with the spotted blinds,\nstudying them intently with his head slightly on one side.\nSome took him for a lunatic and some for an intending purchaser.\nHe is not yet sure that the two characters would be widely different.\n\n\"The above narrative has been constructed on a principle which is,\nin the opinion of the undersigned persons, new in the art of letters.\nEach of the two actors is described as he appeared to the other.\nBut the undersigned persons absolutely guarantee the exactitude\nof the story; and if their version of the thing be questioned, they,\nthe undersigned persons, would deucedly well like to know who does\nknow about it if they don't.\n\n\"The undersigned persons will now adjourn to `The Spotted Dog'\nfor beer.

Surely it is now plain that our client\ncarried his pistol about with the eccentric but innocent\npurpose of giving a wholesome scare to those whom he regarded\nas blasphemers.  In each case the scare was so wholesome\nthat the victim himself has dated from it as from a new birth.\nSmith, so far from being a madman, is rather a mad doctor--\nhe walks the world curing frenzies and not distributing them.\nThat is the answer to the two unanswerable questions which I\nput to the prosecutors.  That is why they dared not produce\na line by any one who had actually confronted the pistol.\nAll who had actually confronted the pistol confessed that they\nhad profited by it.  That was why Smith, though a good shot,\nnever hit anybody.  He never hit anybody because he was a good shot.\nHis mind was as clear of murder as his hands are of blood.\nThis, I say, is the only possible explanation of these facts\nand of all the other facts.  No one can possibly explain\nthe Warden's conduct except by believing the Warden's story.\nEven Dr. Pym, who is a very factory of ingenious theories,\ncould find no other theory to cover the case.\"\n\n\"There are promising per-spectives in hypnotism and dual personality,\"\nsaid Dr. Cyrus Pym dreamily; \"the science of criminology is in\nits infancy, and--\"\n\n\"Infancy!\" cried Moon, jerking his red pencil in the air with a gesture\nof enlightenment; \"why, that explains it!\"\n\n\"I repeat,\" proceeded Inglewood, \"that neither Dr. Pym nor any one else\ncan account on any other theory but ours for the Warden's signature,\nfor the shots missed and the witnesses missing.\"\n\nThe little Yankee had slipped to his feet with some return\nof a cock-fighting coolness.  \"The defence,\" he said,\n\"omits a coldly colossal fact.  They say we produce none of\nthe actual victims.  Wal, here is one victim--England's celebrated\nand stricken Warner.  I reckon he is pretty well produced.\nAnd they suggest that all the outrages were followed\nby reconciliation.  Wal, there's no flies on England's Warner;\nand he isn't reconciliated much.\"\n\n\"My learned friend,\" said Moon, getting elaborately to his feet,\n\"must remember that the science of shooting Dr. Warner is in its infancy.\nDr. Warner would strike the idlest eye as one specially difficult to startle\ninto any recognition of the glory of God.  We admit that our client,\nin this one instance, failed, and that the operation was not successful.\nBut I am empowered to offer, on behalf of my client, a proposal\nfor operating on Dr. Warner again, at his earliest convenience,\nand without further fees.\"\n\n\"'Ang it all, Michael,\" cried Gould, quite serious for the first time\nin his life, \"you might give us a bit of bally sense for a chinge.\"\n\n\"What was Dr. Warner talking about just before the first shot?\"\nasked Moon sharply.\n\n\"The creature,\" said Dr. Warner superciliously, \"asked me,\nwith characteristic rationality, whether it was my birthday.\"\n\n\"And you answered, with characteristic swank,\" cried Moon, shooting out\na long lean finger, as rigid and arresting as the pistol of Smith,\n\"that you didn't keep your birthday.\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" assented the doctor.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Moon, \"he asked you why not, and you said it was because you\ndidn't see that birth was anything to rejoice over.  Agreed?  Now is there\nany one who doubts that our tale is true?\"\n\nThere was a cold crash of stillness in the room; and Moon said, \"Pax populi\nvox Dei; it is the silence of the people that is the voice of God.  Or in\nDr. Pym's more civilized language, it is up to him to open the next charge.\nOn this we claim an acquittal.\"\n\n\nIt was about an hour later.  Dr. Cyrus Pym had remained for an unprecedented\ntime with his eyes closed and his thumb and finger in the air.\nIt almost seemed as if he had been \"struck so,\" as the nurses say;\nand in the deathly silence Michael Moon felt forced to relieve\nthe strain with some remark.  For the last half-hour or so the eminent\ncriminologist had been explaining that science took the same view\nof offences against property as it did of offences against life.\n\"Most murder,\" he had said, \"is a variation of homicidal mania,\nand in the same way most theft is a version of kleptomania.\nI cannot entertain any doubt that my learned friends opposite\nadequately con-ceive how this must involve a scheme of punishment\nmore tol'rant and humane than the cruel methods of ancient codes.\nThey will doubtless exhibit consciousness of a chasm so eminently yawning,\nso thought-arresting, so--\" It was here that he paused and indulged\nin the delicate gesture to which allusion has been made; and Michael\ncould bear it no longer.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said impatiently, \"we admit the chasm.\nThe old cruel codes accuse a man of theft and send him\nto prison for ten years.  The tolerant and humane ticket\naccuses him of nothing and sends him to prison for ever.\nWe pass the chasm.\"\n\nIt was characteristic of the eminent Pym, in one of his trances\nof verbal fastidiousness, that he went on, unconscious not only\nof his opponent's interruption, but even of his own pause.\n\n\"So stock-improving,\" continued Dr. Cyrus Pym, \"so fraught\nwith real high hopes of the future.  Science therefore\nregards thieves, in the abstract, just as it regards murderers.\nIt regards them not as sinners to be punished for an arbitrary period,\nbut as patients to be detained and cared for,\" (his first two digits\nclosed again as he hesitated)--\"in short, for the required period.\nBut there is something special in the case we investigate here.\nKleptomania commonly con-joins itself--\"\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" said Michael; \"I did not ask just now because,\nto tell the truth, I really thought Dr. Pym, though seemingly vertical,\nwas enjoying well-earned slumber, with a pinch in his fingers\nof scentless and delicate dust.  But now that things are moving\na little more, there is something I should really like to know.\nI have hung on Dr. Pym's lips, of course, with an interest that it\nwere weak to call rapture, but I have so far been unable to form\nany conjecture about what the accused, in the present instance,\nis supposed to have been and gone and done.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Moon will have patience,\" said Pym with dignity, \"he will find\nthat this was the very point to which my exposition was di-rected.\nKleptomania, I say, exhibits itself as a kind of physical attraction\nto certain defined materials; and it has been held (by no less a man\nthan Harris) that this is the ultimate explanation of the strict\nspecialism and vurry narrow professional outlook of most criminals.\nOne will have an irresistible physical impulsion towards pearl\nsleeve-links, while he passes over the most elegant and celebrated\ndiamond sleeve-links, placed about in the most conspicuous locations.\nAnother will impede his flight with no less than forty-seven buttoned boots,\nwhile elastic-sided boots leave him cold, and even sarcastic.\nThe specialism of the criminal, I repeat, is a mark rather of insanity\nthan of any brightness of business habits; but there is one kind\nof depredator to whom this principle is at first sight hard to apply.\nI allude to our fellow-citizen the housebreaker.\n\n\"It has been maintained by some of our boldest young\ntruth-seekers, that the eye of a burglar beyond the back-garden\nwall could hardly be caught and hypnotized by a fork\nthat is insulated in a locked box under the butler's bed.\nThey have thrown down the gauntlet to American science on this point.\nThey declare that diamond links are not left about in conspicuous\nlocations in the haunts of the lower classes, as they were\nin the great test experiment of Calypso College.  We hope this\nexperiment here will be an answer to that young ringing challenge,\nand will bring the burglar once more into line and union\nwith his fellow criminals.\"\n\nMoon, whose face had gone through every phase of black bewilderment\nfor five minutes past, suddenly lifted his hand and struck the table\nin explosive enlightenment.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" he cried; \"you mean that Smith is a burglar.\"\n\n\"I thought I made it quite ad'quately lucid,\" said Mr. Pym,\nfolding up his eyelids.  It was typical of this topsy-turvy private\ntrial that all the eloquent extras, all the rhetoric or digression\non either side, was exasperating and unintelligible to the other.\nMoon could not make head or tail of the solemnity of a new civilization.\nPym could not make head or tail of the gaiety of an old one.\n\n\"All the cases in which Smith has figured as an expropriator,\"\ncontinued the American doctor, \"are cases of burglary.\nPursuing the same course as in the previous case, we select\nthe indubitable instance from the rest, and we take the most\ncorrect cast-iron evidence.  I will now call on my colleague,\nMr. Gould, to read a letter we have received from the earnest,\nunspotted Canon of Durham, Canon Hawkins.\"\n\nMr. Moses Gould leapt up with his usual alacrity to read the letter from\nthe earnest and unspotted Hawkins.  Moses Gould could imitate a farmyard well,\nSir Henry Irving not so well, Marie Lloyd to a point of excellence, and the\nnew motor horns in a manner that put him upon the platform of great artists.\nBut his imitation of a Canon of Durham was not convincing; indeed, the sense\nof the letter was so much obscured by the extraordinary leaps and gasps of his\npronunciation that it is perhaps better to print it here as Moon read it when,\na little later, it was handed across the table.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir,--I can scarcely feel surprise that the incident\nyou mention, private as it was, should have filtered through\nour omnivorous journals to the mere populace; for the position\nI have since attained makes me, I conceive, a public character,\nand this was certainly the most extraordinary incident\nin a not uneventful and perhaps not an unimportant career.\nI am by no means without experience in scenes of civil tumult.\nI have faced many a political crisis in the old Primrose League\ndays at Herne Bay, and, before I broke with the wilder set,\nhave spent many a night at the Christian Social Union.  But this\nother experience was quite inconceivable.  I can only describe\nit as the letting loose of a place which it is not for me,\nas a clergyman, to mention.\n\n\"It occurred in the days when I was, for a short period,\na curate at Hoxton; and the other curate, then my colleague,\ninduced me to attend a meeting which he described, I must say\nprofanely described, as calculated to promote the kingdom\nof God.  I found, on the contrary, that it consisted entirely\nof men in corduroys and greasy clothes whose manners were coarse\nand their opinions extreme.\n\n\"Of my colleague in question I wish to speak with the fullest\nrespect and friendliness, and I will therefore say little.\nNo one can be more convinced than I of the evil of politics\nin the pulpit; and I never offer my congregation any advice\nabout voting except in cases in which I feel strongly that they\nare likely to make an erroneous selection.  But, while I do\nnot mean to touch at all upon political or social problems,\nI must say that for a clergyman to countenance, even in jest,\nsuch discredited nostrums of dissipated demagogues as Socialism\nor Radicalism partakes of the character of the betrayal\nof a sacred trust.  Far be it from me to say a word against\nthe Reverend Raymond Percy, the colleague in question.\nHe was brilliant, I suppose, and to some apparently fascinating;\nbut a clergyman who talks like a Socialist, wears his hair\nlike a pianist, and behaves like an intoxicated person,\nwill never rise in his profession, or even obtain the admiration\nof the good and wise.  Nor is it for me to utter my personal\njudgements of the appearance of the people in the hall.\nYet a glance round the room, revealing ranks of debased\nand envious faces--\"\n\n\"Adopting,\" said Moon explosively, for he was getting restive--\"adopting\nthe reverend gentleman's favourite figure of logic, may I say that\nwhile tortures would not tear from me a whisper about his intellect,\nhe is a blasted old jackass.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Dr. Pym; \"I protest.\"\n\n\"You must keep quiet, Michael,\" said Inglewood; \"they have a right\nto read their story.\"\n\n\"Chair!  Chair!  Chair!\" cried Gould, rolling about exuberantly in his own;\nand Pym glanced for a moment towards the canopy which covered all\nthe authority of the Court of Beacon.\n\n\"Oh, don't wake the old lady,\" said Moon, lowering his voice in a moody\ngood-humour. \"I apologize.  I won't interrupt again.\"\n\nBefore the little eddy of interruption was ended the reading\nof the clergyman's letter was already continuing.\n\n\"The proceedings opened with a speech from my colleague, of which I\nwill say nothing.  It was deplorable.  Many of the audience\nwere Irish, and showed the weakness of that impetuous people.\nWhen gathered together into gangs and conspiracies they seem\nto lose altogether that lovable good-nature and readiness to accept\nanything one tells them which distinguishes them as individuals.\"\n\n\nWith a slight start, Michael rose to his feet, bowed solemnly,\nand sat down again.\n\n\n\"These persons, if not silent, were at least applausive during the speech\nof Mr. Percy.  He descended to their level with witticisms about rent\nand a reserve of labour.  Confiscation, expropriation, arbitration, and such\nwords with which I cannot soil my lips, recurred constantly.  Some hours\nafterward the storm broke.  I had been addressing the meeting for some time,\npointing out the lack of thrift in the working classes, their insufficient\nattendance at evening service, their neglect of the Harvest Festival, and of\nmany other things that might materially help them to improve their lot.\nIt was, I think, about this time that an extraordinary interruption occurred.\nAn enormous, powerful man, partly concealed with white plaster,\narose in the middle of the hall, and offered (in a loud, roaring voice,\nlike a bull's) some observations which seemed to be in a foreign language.\nMr. Raymond Percy, my colleague, descended to his level by entering into\na duel of repartee, in which he appeared to be the victor.  The meeting\nbegan to behave more respectfully for a little; yet before I had said twelve\nsentences more the rush was made for the platform.  The enormous plasterer,\nin particular, plunged towards us, shaking the earth like an elephant;\nand I really do not know what would have happened if a man equally large,\nbut not quite so ill-dressed, had not jumped up also and held him away.\nThis other big man shouted a sort of speech to the mob as he was shoving\nthem back.  I don't know what he said, but, what with shouting and shoving\nand such horseplay, he got us out at a back door, while the wretched people\nwent roaring down another passage.\n\n\"Then follows the truly extraordinary part of my story.  When he had got\nus outside, in a mean backyard of blistered grass leading into a lane\nwith a very lonely-looking lamp-post, this giant addressed me as follows:\n`You're well out of that, sir; now you'd better come along with me.\nI want you to help me in an act of social justice, such as we've all\nbeen talking about.  Come along!'  And turning his big back abruptly,\nhe led us down the lean old lane with the one lean old lamp-post,\nwe scarcely knowing what to do but to follow him.  He had certainly\nhelped us in a most difficult situation, and, as a gentleman, I could\nnot treat such a benefactor with suspicion without grave grounds.\nSuch also was the view of my Socialistic colleague, who (with all\nhis dreadful talk of arbitration) is a gentleman also.  In fact,\nhe comes of the Staffordshire Percys, a branch of the old house\nand has the black hair and pale, clear-cut face of the whole family.\nI cannot but refer it to vanity that he should heighten his personal\nadvantages with black velvet or a red cross of considerable ostentation,\nand certainly--but I digress.\n\n\"A fog was coming up the street, and that last lost lamp-post\nfaded behind us in a way that certainly depressed the mind.\nThe large man in front of us looked larger and larger in the haze.\nHe did not turn round, but he said with his huge back to us,\n`All that talking's no good; we want a little practical Socialism.'\n\n\"`I quite agree,' said Percy; `but I always like to understand things\nin theory before I put them into practice.'\n\n\"`Oh, you just leave that to me,' said the practical Socialist,\nor whatever he was, with the most terrifying vagueness.\n`I have a way with me.  I'm a Permeator.'\n\n\"I could not imagine what he meant, but my companion laughed,\nso I was sufficiently reassured to continue the unaccountable journey\nfor the present.  It led us through most singular ways; out of the lane,\nwhere we were already rather cramped, into a paved passage,\nat the end of which we passed through a wooden gate left open.\nWe then found ourselves, in the increasing darkness and vapour,\ncrossing what appeared to be a beaten path across a kitchen garden.\nI called out to the enormous person going on in front, but he answered\nobscurely that it was a short cut.\n\n\"I was just repeating my very natural doubt to my clerical companion\nwhen I was brought up against a short ladder, apparently leading\nto a higher level of road.  My thoughtless colleague ran up it so\nquickly that I could not do otherwise than follow as best I could.\nThe path on which I then planted my feet was quite unprecedentedly narrow.\nI had never had to walk along a thoroughfare so exiguous.\nAlong one side of it grew what, in the dark and density of air,\nI first took to be some short, strong thicket of shrubs.  Then I saw\nthat they were not short shrubs; they were the tops of tall trees.\nI, an English gentleman and clergyman of the Church of England--I was\nwalking along the top of a garden wall like a tom cat.\n\n\"I am glad to say that I stopped within my first five steps,\nand let loose my just reprobation, balancing myself as best I\ncould all the time.\n\n\"`It's a right-of-way,' declared my indefensible informant.\n`It's closed to traffic once in a hundred years.'\n\n\"`Mr. Percy, Mr. Percy!'  I called out; `you are not going\non with this blackguard?'\n\n\"`Why, I think so,' answered my unhappy colleague flippantly.\n`I think you and I are bigger blackguards than he is,\nwhatever he is.'\n\n\"`I am a burglar,' explained the big creature quite calmly.\n`I am a member of the Fabian Society.  I take back the wealth stolen\nby the capitalist, not by sweeping civil war and revolution, but by reform\nfitted to the special occasion--here a little and there a little.\nDo you see that fifth house along the terrace with the flat roof?\nI'm permeating that one to-night.'\n\n\"`Whether this is a crime or a joke,' I cried, `I desire to be quit of it.'\n\n\"`The ladder is just behind you,' answered the creature\nwith horrible courtesy; `and, before you go, do let me give\nyou my card.'\n\n\"If I had had the presence of mind to show any proper spirit I\nshould have flung it away, though any adequate gesture of the kind\nwould have gravely affected my equilibrium upon the wall.\nAs it was, in the wildness of the moment, I put it in my\nwaistcoat pocket, and, picking my way back by wall and ladder,\nlanded in the respectable streets once more.  Not before, however,\nI had seen with my own eyes the two awful and lamentable facts--\nthat the burglar was climbing up a slanting roof towards\nthe chimneys, and that Raymond Percy (a priest of God and,\nwhat was worse, a gentleman) was crawling up after him.\nI have never seen either of them since that day.\n\n\"In consequence of this soul-searching experience I severed my\nconnection with the wild set.  I am far from saying that every\nmember of the Christian Social Union must necessarily be a burglar.\nI have no right to bring any such charge.  But it gave me a hint\nof what such courses may lead to in many cases; and I saw them no more.\n\n\"I have only to add that the photograph you enclose, taken by a\nMr. Inglewood, is undoubtedly that of the burglar in question.\nWhen I got home that night I looked at his card, and he was inscribed\nthere under the name of Innocent Smith.--Yours faithfully,\n                                     \"John Clement Hawkins.\"\n\n\nMoon merely went through the form of glancing at the paper.  He knew that\nthe prosecutors could not have invented so heavy a document; that Moses Gould\n(for one) could no more write like a canon than he could read like one.\nAfter handing it back he rose to open the defence on the burglary charge.\n\n\"We wish,\" said Michael, \"to give all reasonable facilities to\nthe prosecution; especially as it will save the time of the whole court.\nThe latter object I shall once again pursue by passing over all\nthose points of theory which are so dear to Dr. Pym.  I know how they\nare made.  Perjury is a variety of aphasia, leading a man to say\none thing instead of another.  Forgery is a kind of writer's cramp,\nforcing a man to write his uncle's name instead of his own.\nPiracy on the high seas is probably a form of sea-sickness. But it is\nunnecessary for us to inquire into the causes of a fact which we deny.\nInnocent Smith never did commit burglary at all.\n\n\"I should like to claim the power permitted by our previous arrangement,\nand ask the prosecution two or three questions.\"\n\nDr. Cyrus Pym closed his eyes to indicate a courteous assent.\n\n\"In the first place,\" continued Moon, \"have you the date of Canon Hawkins's\nlast glimpse of Smith and Percy climbing up the walls and roofs?\"\n\n\"Ho, yus!\" called out Gould smartly.  \"November thirteen, eighteen ninety-one.\"\n\n\"Have you,\" continued Moon, \"identified the houses in Hoxton up\nwhich they climbed?\"\n\n\"Must have been Ladysmith Terrace out of the highroad,\"\nanswered Gould with the same clockwork readiness.\n\n\"Well,\" said Michael, cocking an eyebrow at him, \"was there any burglary\nin that terrace that night?  Surely you could find that out.\"\n\n\"There may well have been,\" said the doctor primly, after a pause,\n\"an unsuccessful one that led to no legalities.\"\n\n\"Another question,\" proceeded Michael.  \"Canon Hawkins, in his\nblood-and-thunder boyish way, left off at the exciting moment.\nWhy don't you produce the evidence of the other clergyman,\nwho actually followed the burglar and presumably was present\nat the crime?\"\n\nDr. Pym rose and planted the points of his fingers on the table,\nas he did when he was specially confident of the clearness\nof his reply.\n\n\"We have entirely failed,\" he said, \"to track the other clergyman,\nwho seems to have melted into the ether after Canon Hawkins had\nseen him as-cending the gutters and the leads.  I am fully aware\nthat this may strike many as sing'lar; yet, upon reflection,\nI think it will appear pretty natural to a bright thinker.\nThis Mr. Raymond Percy is admittedly, by the canon's evidence,\na minister of eccentric ways.  His con-nection with England's proudest\nand fairest does not seemingly prevent a taste for the society\nof the real low-down. On the other hand, the prisoner Smith is,\nby general agreement, a man of irr'sistible fascination.\nI entertain no doubt that Smith led the Revered Percy into the crime\nand forced him to hide his head in the real crim'nal class.\nThat would fully account for his non-appearance, and the failure\nof all attempts to trace him.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, then, to trace him?\" asked Moon.\n\n\"Impossible,\" repeated the specialist, shutting his eyes.\n\n\"You are sure it's impossible?\"\n\n\"Oh dry up, Michael,\" cried Gould, irritably.  \"We'd 'ave found\n'im if we could, for you bet 'e saw the burglary.  Don't YOU\nstart looking for 'im. Look for your own 'ead in the dustbin.\nYou'll find that--after a bit,\" and his voice died away in grumbling.\n\n\"Arthur,\" directed Michael Moon, sitting down, \"kindly read\nMr. Raymond Percy's letter to the court.\"\n\n\"Wishing, as Mr. Moon has said, to shorten the proceedings as much\nas possible,\" began Inglewood, \"I will not read the first part\nof the letter sent to us.  It is only fair to the prosecution\nto admit the account given by the second clergyman fully ratifies,\nas far as facts are concerned, that given by the first clergyman.\nWe concede, then, the canon's story so far as it goes.\nThis must necessarily be valuable to the prosecutor and also convenient\nto the court.  I begin Mr. Percy's letter, then, at the point\nwhen all three men were standing on the garden wall:--\n\n\n\"As I watched Hawkins wavering on the wall, I made up my own mind\nnot to waver.  A cloud of wrath was on my brain, like the cloud\nof copper fog on the houses and gardens round.  My decision was\nviolent and simple; yet the thoughts that led up to it were so\ncomplicated and contradictory that I could not retrace them now.\nI knew Hawkins was a kind, innocent gentleman; and I would have\ngiven ten pounds for the pleasure of kicking him down the road.\nThat God should allow good people to be as bestially stupid as that--\nrose against me like a towering blasphemy.\n\n\"At Oxford, I fear, I had the artistic temperament rather badly;\nand artists love to be limited.  I liked the church as a pretty pattern;\ndiscipline was mere decoration.  I delighted in mere divisions of time;\nI liked eating fish on Friday.  But then I like fish; and the fast\nwas made for men who like meat.  Then I came to Hoxton and found men\nwho had fasted for five hundred years; men who had to gnaw fish because\nthey could not get meat--and fish-bones when they could not get fish.\nAs too many British officers treat the army as a review, so I had treated\nthe Church Militant as if it were the Church Pageant.  Hoxton cures that.\nThen I realized that for eighteen hundred years the Church Militant\nhad not been a pageant, but a riot--and a suppressed riot.\nThere, still living patiently in Hoxton, were the people to whom\nthe tremendous promises had been made.  In the face of that I had\nto become a revolutionary if I was to continue to be religious.\nIn Hoxton one cannot be a conservative without being also an atheist--\nand a pessimist.  Nobody but the devil could want to conserve Hoxton.\n\n\"On the top of all this comes Hawkins.  If he had cursed all the Hoxton men,\nexcommunicated them, and told them they were going to hell, I should\nhave rather admired him.  If he had ordered them all to be burned\nin the market-place, I should still have had that patience that all\ngood Christians have with the wrongs inflicted on other people.\nBut there is no priestcraft about Hawkins--nor any other kind of craft.\nHe is as perfectly incapable of being a priest as he is of being a carpenter\nor a cabman or a gardener or a plasterer.  He is a perfect gentleman;\nthat is his complaint.  He does not impose his creed, but simply his class.\nHe never said a word of religion in the whole of his damnable address.\nHe simply said all the things his brother, the major, would have said.\nA voice from heaven assures me that he has a brother, and that this\nbrother is a major.\n\n\"When this helpless aristocrat had praised cleanliness in the body\nand convention in the soul to people who could hardly keep body\nand soul together, the stampede against our platform began.\nI took part in his undeserved rescue, I followed his\nobscure deliverer, until (as I have said) we stood together\non the wall above the dim gardens, already clouding with fog.\nThen I looked at the curate and at the burglar, and decided, in a spasm\nof inspiration, that the burglar was the better man of the two.\nThe burglar seemed quite as kind and human as the curate was--\nand he was also brave and self-reliant, which the curate was not.\nI knew there was no virtue in the upper class, for I belong to\nit myself; I knew there was not so very much in the lower class,\nfor I had lived with it a long time.  Many old texts about\nthe despised and persecuted came back to my mind, and I thought\nthat the saints might well be hidden in the criminal class.\nAbout the time Hawkins let himself down the ladder I was crawling\nup a low, sloping, blue-slate roof after the large man, who went\nleaping in front of me like a gorilla.\n\n\"This upward scramble was short, and we soon found\nourselves tramping along a broad road of flat roofs,\nbroader than many big thoroughfares, with chimney-pots here\nand there that seemed in the haze as bulky as small forts.\nThe asphyxiation of the fog seemed to increase the somewhat\nswollen and morbid anger under which my brain and body laboured.\nThe sky and all those things that are commonly clear seemed\noverpowered by sinister spirits.  Tall spectres with turbans of vapour\nseemed to stand higher than the sun or moon, eclipsing both.\nI thought dimly of illustrations to the `Arabian Nights'\non brown paper with rich but sombre tints, showing genii\ngathering round the Seal of Solomon.  By the way, what was\nthe Seal of Solomon?  Nothing to do with sealing-wax really,\nI suppose; but my muddled fancy felt the thick clouds as being\nof that heavy and clinging substance, of strong opaque colour,\npoured out of boiling pots and stamped into monstrous emblems.\n\n\"The first effect of the tall turbaned vapours was that discoloured\nlook of pea-soup or coffee brown of which Londoners commonly speak.\nBut the scene grew subtler with familiarity.  We stood above the average\nof the housetops and saw something of that thing called smoke, which in\ngreat cities creates the strange thing called fog.  Beneath us rose\na forest of chimney-pots. And there stood in every chimney-pot, as if it\nwere a flower-pot, a brief shrub or a tall tree of coloured vapour.\nThe colours of the smoke were various; for some chimneys were from\nfiresides and some from factories, and some again from mere rubbish heaps.\nAnd yet, though the tints were all varied, they all seemed unnatural,\nlike fumes from a witch's pot.  It was as if the shameful and ugly\nshapes growing shapeless in the cauldron sent up each its separate\nspurt of steam, coloured according to the fish or flesh consumed.\nHere, aglow from underneath, were dark red clouds, such as might drift\nfrom dark jars of sacrificial blood; there the vapour was dark indigo gray,\nlike the long hair of witches steeped in the hell-broth. In another\nplace the smoke was of an awful opaque ivory yellow, such as might\nbe the disembodiment of one of their old, leprous waxen images.\nBut right across it ran a line of bright, sinister, sulphurous green,\nas clear and crooked as Arabic--\"\n\nMr. Moses Gould once more attempted the arrest of the 'bus.\nHe was understood to suggest that the reader should shorten\nthe proceedings by leaving out all the adjectives.  Mrs. Duke,\nwho had woken up, observed that she was sure it was all very nice,\nand the decision was duly noted down by Moses with a blue,\nand by Michael with a red pencil.  Inglewood then resumed\nthe reading of the document.\n\n\n\"Then I read the writing of the smoke.  Smoke was like the modern\ncity that makes it; it is not always dull or ugly, but it is always\nwicked and vain.\n\n\"Modern England was like a cloud of smoke; it could carry\nall colours, but it could leave nothing but a stain.  It was our\nweakness and not our strength that put a rich refuse in the sky.\nThese were the rivers of our vanity pouring into the void.\nWe had taken the sacred circle of the whirlwind, and looked down on it,\nand seen it as a whirlpool.  And then we had used it as a sink.\nIt was a good symbol of the mutiny in my own mind.\nOnly our worst things were going to heaven.  Only our criminals\ncould still ascend like angels.\n\n\"As my brain was blinded with such emotions, my guide stopped\nby one of the big chimney-pots that stood at the regular intervals\nlike lamp-posts along that uplifted and aerial highway.\nHe put his heavy hand upon it, and for the moment I thought he was\nmerely leaning on it, tired with his steep scramble along the terrace.\nSo far as I could guess from the abysses, full of fog on either side,\nand the veiled lights of red brown and old gold glowing through\nthem now and again, we were on the top of one of those long,\nconsecutive, and genteel rows of houses which are still to be\nfound lifting their heads above poorer districts, the remains\nof some rage of optimism in earlier speculative builders.\nProbably enough, they were entirely untenanted, or tenanted\nonly by such small clans of the poor as gather also in the old\nemptied palaces of Italy.  Indeed, some little time later,\nwhen the fog had lifted a little, I discovered that we\nwere walking round a semi-circle of crescent which fell away\nbelow us into one flat square or wide street below another,\nlike a giant stairway, in a manner not unknown in the eccentric\nbuilding of London, and looking like the last ledges of the land.\nBut a cloud sealed the giant stairway as yet.\n\n\"My speculations about the sullen skyscape, however, were interrupted\nby something as unexpected as the moon falling from the sky.\nInstead of my burglar lifting his hand from the chimney\nhe leaned on, he leaned on it a little more heavily, and the whole\nchimney-pot turned over like the opening top of an inkstand.\nI remembered the short ladder leaning against the low wall and felt\nsure he had arranged his criminal approach long before.\n\n\"The collapse of the big chimney-pot ought to have been the culmination\nof my chaotic feelings; but, to tell the truth, it produced a sudden sense\nof comedy and even of comfort.  I could not recall what connected this\nabrupt bit of housebreaking with some quaint but still kindly fancies.\nThen I remembered the delightful and uproarious scenes of roofs and chimneys\nin the harlequinades of my childhood, and was darkly and quite irrationally\ncomforted by a sense of unsubstantiality in the scene, as if the houses\nwere of lath and paint and pasteboard, and were only meant to be tumbled\nin and out of by policemen and pantaloons.  The law-breaking of my companion\nseemed not only seriously excusable, but even comically excusable.\nWho were all these pompous preposterous people with their footmen and their\nfoot-scrapers, their chimney-pots and their chimney-pot hats, that they\nshould prevent a poor clown from getting sausages if he wanted them?\nOne would suppose that property was a serious thing.  I had reached,\nas it were, a higher level of that mountainous and vapourous visions,\nthe heaven of a higher levity.\n\n\"My guide had jumped down into the dark cavity revealed by the displaced\nchimney-pot. He must have landed at a level considerably lower, for,\ntall as he was, nothing but his weirdly tousled head remained visible.\nSomething again far off, and yet familiar, pleased me about this way\nof invading the houses of men.  I thought of little chimney-sweeps,\nand `The Water Babies;' but I decided that it was not that.\nThen I remembered what it was that made me connect such topsy-turvy\ntrespass with ideas quite opposite to the idea of crime.\nChristmas Eve, of course, and Santa Claus coming down the chimney.\n\n\"Almost at the same instant the hairy head disappeared into the black hole;\nbut I heard a voice calling to me from below.  A second or two afterwards,\nthe hairy head reappeared; it was dark against the more fiery part of the fog,\nand nothing could be spelt of its expression, but its voice called on me\nto follow with that enthusiastic impatience proper only among old friends.\nI jumped into the gulf, and as blindly as Curtius, for I was still thinking\nof Santa Claus and the traditional virtue of such vertical entrance.\n\n\"In every well-appointed gentleman's house, I reflected, there was\nthe front door for the gentlemen, and the side door for the tradesmen;\nbut there was also the top door for the gods.  The chimney is,\nso to speak, the underground passage between earth and heaven.\nBy this starry tunnel Santa Claus manages--like the skylark--\nto be true to the kindred points of heaven and home.\nNay, owing to certain conventions, and a widely distributed lack\nof courage for climbing, this door was, perhaps, little used.\nBut Santa Claus's door was really the front door:\nit was the door fronting the universe.\n\n\"I thought this as I groped my way across the black garret, or loft below\nthe roof, and scrambled down the squat ladder that let us down into a yet\nlarger loft below.  Yet it was not till I was half-way down the ladder that I\nsuddenly stood still, and thought for an instant of retracing all my steps,\nas my companion had retraced them from the beginning of the garden wall.\nThe name of Santa Claus had suddenly brought me back to my senses.\nI remembered why Santa Clause came, and why he was welcome.\n\n\"I was brought up in the propertied classes, and with all\ntheir horror of offences against property.  I had heard all\nthe regular denunciations of robbery, both right and wrong;\nI had read the Ten Commandments in church a thousand times.\nAnd then and there, at the age of thirty-four, half-way\ndown a ladder in a dark room in the bodily act of burglar,\nI saw suddenly for the first time that theft, after all,\nis really wrong.\n\n\"It was too late to turn back, however, and I followed\nthe strangely soft footsteps of my huge companion across\nthe lower and larger loft, till he knelt down on a part\nof the bare flooring and, after a few fumbling efforts,\nlifted a sort of trapdoor.  This released a light from below,\nand we found ourselves looking down into a lamp-lit sitting room,\nof the sort that in large houses often leads out of a bedroom,\nand is an adjunct to it.  Light thus breaking from beneath\nour feet like a soundless explosion, showed that the trapdoor\njust lifted was clogged with dust and rust, and had doubtless\nbeen long disused until the advent of my enterprising friend.\nBut I did not look at this long, for the sight of the shining\nroom underneath us had an almost unnatural attractiveness.\nTo enter a modern interior at so strange an angle,\nby so forgotten a door, was an epoch in one's psychology.\nIt was like having found a fourth dimension.\n\n\"My companion dropped from the aperture into the room so suddenly\nand soundlessly, that I could do nothing but follow him;\nthough, for lack of practice in crime, I was by no means soundless.\nBefore the echo of my boots had died away, the big burglar\nhad gone quickly to the door, half opened it, and stood looking\ndown the staircase and listening.  Then, leaving the door\nstill half open, he came back into the middle of the room,\nand ran his roving blue eye round its furniture and ornament.\nThe room was comfortably lined with books in that rich and human\nway that makes the walls seem alive; it was a deep and full,\nbut slovenly, bookcase, of the sort that is constantly ransacked\nfor the purposes of reading in bed.  One of those stunted\nGerman stoves that look like red goblins stood in a corner,\nand a sideboard of walnut wood with closed doors in its lower part.\nThere were three windows, high but narrow.  After another glance round,\nmy housebreaker plucked the walnut doors open and rummaged inside.\nHe found nothing there, apparently, except an extremely\nhandsome cut-glass decanter, containing what looked like port.\nSomehow the sight of the thief returning with this ridiculous little\nluxury in his hand woke within me once more all the revelation\nand revulsion I had felt above.\n\n\"`Don't do it!'  I cried quite incoherently, `Santa Claus--'\n\n\"`Ah,' said the burglar, as he put the decanter on the table\nand stood looking at me, `you've thought about that, too.'\n\n\"`I can't express a millionth part of what I've thought of,' I cried,\n`but it's something like this... oh, can't you see it?  Why are children\nnot afraid of Santa Claus, though he comes like a thief in the night?\nHe is permitted secrecy, trespass, almost treachery--because there are\nmore toys where he has been.  What should we feel if there were less?\nDown what chimney from hell would come the goblin that should take\naway the children's balls and dolls while they slept?  Could a Greek\ntragedy be more gray and cruel than that daybreak and awakening?\nDog-stealer, horse-stealer, man-stealer--can you think of anything\nso base as a toy-stealer?'\n\n\"The burglar, as if absently, took a large revolver from his pocket and laid\nit on the table beside the decanter, but still kept his blue reflective eyes\nfixed on my face.\n\n\"`Man!' I said, `all stealing is toy-stealing. That's why\nit's really wrong.  The goods of the unhappy children of men\nshould be really respected because of their worthlessness.\nI know Naboth's vineyard is as painted as Noah's Ark.  I know\nNathan's ewe-lamb is really a woolly baa-lamb on a wooden stand.\nThat is why I could not take them away.  I did not mind so much,\nas long as I thought of men's things as their valuables;\nbut I dare not put a hand upon their vanities.'\n\n\"After a moment I added abruptly, `Only saints and sages ought to be robbed.\nThey may be stripped and pillaged; but not the poor little worldly people\nof the things that are their poor little pride.'\n\n\"He set out two wineglasses from the cupboard, filled them both,\nand lifted one of them with a salutation towards his lips.\n\n\"`Don't do it!'  I cried.  `It might be the last bottle of some rotten\nvintage or other.  The master of this house may be quite proud of it.\nDon't you see there's something sacred in the silliness of such things?'\n\n\"`It's not the last bottle,' answered my criminal calmly;\n`there's plenty more in the cellar.'\n\n\"`You know the house, then?'  I said.\n\n\"`Too well,' he answered, with a sadness so strange as to have\nsomething eerie about it.  `I am always trying to forget what I know--\nand to find what I don't know.'  He drained his glass.\n`Besides,' he added, `it will do him good.'\n\n\"`What will do him good?'\n\n\"`The wine I'm drinking,' said the strange person.\n\n\"`Does he drink too much, then?'  I inquired.\n\n\"`No,' he answered, `not unless I do.'\n\n\"`Do you mean,' I demanded, `that the owner of this house approves\nof all you do?'\n\n\"`God forbid,' he answered; `but he has to do the same.'\n\n\"The dead face of the fog looking in at all three windows\nunreasonable increased a sense of riddle, and even terror,\nabout this tall, narrow house we had entered out of the sky.\nI had once more the notion about the gigantic genii--\nI fancied that enormous Egyptian faces, of the dead reds\nand yellows of Egypt, were staring in at each window of our\nlittle lamp-lit room as at a lighted stage of marionettes.\nMy companion went on playing with the pistol in front of him,\nand talking with the same rather creepy confidentialness.\n\n\"`I am always trying to find him--to catch him unawares.\nI come in through skylights and trapdoors to find him;\nbut whenever I find him--he is doing what I am doing.'\n\n\"I sprang to my feet with a thrill of fear.  `There is some one coming,'\nI cried, and my cry had something of a shriek in it.  Not from\nthe stairs below, but along the passage from the inner bedchamber\n(which seemed somehow to make it more alarming), footsteps were\ncoming nearer.  I am quite unable to say what mystery, or monster,\nor double, I expected to see when the door was pushed open from within.\nI am only quite certain that I did not expect to see what I did see.\n\n\"Framed in the open doorway stood, with an air of great serenity,\na rather tall young woman, definitely though indefinably artistic--\nher dress the colour of spring and her hair of autumn leaves,\nwith a face which, though still comparatively young,\nconveyed experience as well as intelligence.  All she said was,\n`I didn't hear you come in.'\n\n\"`I came in another way,' said the Permeator, somewhat vaguely.\n`I'd left my latchkey at home.'\n\n\"I got to my feet in a mixture of politeness and mania.\n`I'm really very sorry,' I cried.  `I know my position is irregular.\nWould you be so obliging as to tell me whose house this is?'\n\n\"`Mine,' said the burglar, `May I present you to my wife?'\n\n\"I doubtfully, and somewhat slowly, resumed my seat;\nand I did not get out of it till nearly morning.  Mrs. Smith\n(such was the prosaic name of this far from prosaic household)\nlingered a little, talking slightly and pleasantly.\nShe left on my mind the impression of a certain odd mixture\nof shyness and sharpness; as if she knew the world well,\nbut was still a little harmlessly afraid of it.\nPerhaps the possession of so jumpy and incalculable a husband\nhad left her a little nervous.  Anyhow, when she had retired\nto the inner chamber once more, that extraordinary man poured\nforth his apologia and autobiography over the dwindling wine.\n\n\"He had been sent to Cambridge with a view to a mathematical\nand scientific, rather than a classical or literary, career.\nA starless nihilism was then the philosophy of the schools;\nand it bred in him a war between the members and the spirit,\nbut one in which the members were right.  While his brain\naccepted the black creed, his very body rebelled against it.\nAs he put it, his right hand taught him terrible things.\nAs the authorities of Cambridge University put it, unfortunately,\nit had taken the form of his right hand flourishing a loaded\nfirearm in the very face of a distinguished don, and driving\nhim to climb out of the window and cling to a waterspout.\nHe had done it solely because the poor don had professed\nin theory a preference for non-existence. For this\nvery unacademic type of argument he had been sent down.\nVomiting as he was with revulsion, from the pessimism that had\nquailed under his pistol, he made himself a kind of fanatic\nof the joy of life.  He cut across all the associations\nof serious-minded men.  He was gay, but by no means careless.\nHis practical jokes were more in earnest than verbal ones.\nThough not an optimist in the absurd sense of maintaining that\nlife is all beer and skittles, he did really seem to maintain\nthat beer and skittles are the most serious part of it.\n`What is more immortal,' he would cry, `than love and war?\nType of all desire and joy--beer.  Type of all battle\nand conquest--skittles.'\n\n\"There was something in him of what the old world called\nthe solemnity of revels--when they spoke of `solemnizing'\na mere masquerade or wedding banquet.  Nevertheless he was not\na mere pagan any more than he was a mere practical joker.\nHis eccentricities sprang from a static fact of faith,\nin itself mystical, and even childlike and Christian.\n\n\"`I don't deny,' he said, `that there should be priests to remind\nmen that they will one day die.  I only say that at certain\nstrange epochs it is necessary to have another kind of priests,\ncalled poets, actually to remind men that they are not dead yet.\nThe intellectuals among whom I moved were not even alive enough\nto fear death.  They hadn't enough blood in them to be cowards.\nUntil a pistol barrel was poked under their very noses they never\neven knew they had been born.  For ages looking up an eternal\nperspective it might be true that life is a learning to die.\nBut for these little white rats it was just as true that death\nwas their only chance of learning to live.'\n\n\"His creed of wonder was Christian by this absolute test; that he felt\nit continually slipping from himself as much as from others.\nHe had the same pistol for himself, as Brutus said of the dagger.\nHe continually ran preposterous risks of high precipice or headlong\nspeed to keep alive the mere conviction that he was alive.\nHe treasured up trivial and yet insane details that had once\nreminded him of the awful subconscious reality.  When the don\nhad hung on the stone gutter, the sight of his long dangling legs,\nvibrating in the void like wings, somehow awoke the naked satire\nof the old definition of man as a two-legged animal without feathers.\nThe wretched professor had been brought into peril by his head,\nwhich he had so elaborately cultivated, and only saved\nby his legs, which he had treated with coldness and neglect.\nSmith could think of no other way of announcing or recording this,\nexcept to send a telegram to an old friend (by this time a\ntotal stranger) to say that he had just seen a man with two legs;\nand that the man was alive.\n\n\"The uprush of his released optimism burst into stars like a rocket\nwhen he suddenly fell in love.  He happened to be shooting a high\nand very headlong weir in a canoe, by way of proving to himself\nthat he was alive; and he soon found himself involved in some doubt\nabout the continuance of the fact.  What was worse, he found he had\nequally jeopardized a harmless lady alone in a rowing-boat, and one\nwho had provoked death by no professions of philosophic negation.\nHe apologized in wild gasps through all his wild wet labours to bring\nher to the shore, and when he had done so at last, he seems to have\nproposed to her on the bank.  Anyhow, with the same impetuosity\nwith which he had nearly murdered her, he completely married her;\nand she was the lady in green to whom I had recently said `good-night.'\n\n\"They had settled down in these high narrow houses\nnear Highbury.  Perhaps, indeed, that is hardly the word.\nOne could strictly say that Smith was married, that he was very\nhappily married, that he not only did not care for any woman\nbut his wife, but did not seem to care for any place but his home;\nbut perhaps one could hardly say that he had settled down.\n`I am a very domestic fellow,' he explained with gravity,\n`and have often come in through a broken window rather than be\nlate for tea.'\n\n\"He lashed his soul with laughter to prevent it falling asleep.\nHe lost his wife a series of excellent servants by knocking at\nthe door as a total stranger, and asking if Mr. Smith lived there\nand what kind of a man he was.  The London general servant is not\nused to the master indulging in such transcendental ironies.\nAnd it was found impossible to explain to her that he did it in order\nto feel the same interest in his own affairs that he always felt\nin other people's.\n\n\"`I know there's a fellow called Smith,' he said in his rather\nweird way, `living in one of the tall houses in this terrace.\nI know he is really happy, and yet I can never catch him at it.'\n\n\"Sometimes he would, of a sudden, treat his wife with a kind of paralyzed\npoliteness, like a young stranger struck with love at first sight.\nSometimes he would extend this poetic fear to the very furniture;\nwould seem to apologize to the chair he sat on, and climb the staircase\nas cautiously as a cragsman, to renew in himself the sense of their skeleton\nof reality.  Every stair is a ladder and every stool a leg, he said.\nAnd at other times he would play the stranger exactly in the opposite sense,\nand would enter by another way, so as to feel like a thief and a robber.\nHe would break and violate his own home, as he had done with me that night.\nIt was near morning before I could tear myself from this queer confidence\nof the Man Who Would Not Die, and as I shook hands with him on the doorstep\nthe last load of fog was lifting, and rifts of daylight revealed the stairway\nof irregular street levels that looked like the end of the world.\n\n\"It will be enough for many to say that I had passed a night with a maniac.\nWhat other term, it will be said, could be applied to such a being?\nA man who reminds himself that he is married by pretending not to be married!\nA man who tries to covet his own goods instead of his neighbor's! On\nthis I have but one word to say, and I feel it of my honour to say it,\nthough no one understands.  I believe the maniac was one of those who\ndo not merely come, but are sent; sent like a great gale upon ships\nby Him who made His angels winds and His messengers a flaming fire.\nThis, at least, I know for certain.  Whether such men have laughed\nor wept, we have laughed at their laughter as much as at their weeping.\nWhether they cursed or blessed the world, they have never fitted it.\nIt is true that men have shrunk from the sting of a great satirist\nas if from the sting of an adder.  But it is equally true that men flee\nfrom the embrace of a great optimist as from the embrace of a bear.\nNothing brings down more curses than a real benediction.\nFor the goodness of good things, like the badness of bad things,\nis a prodigy past speech; it is to be pictured rather than spoken.\nWe shall have gone deeper than the deeps of heaven and grown older than\nthe oldest angels before we feel, even in its first faint vibrations,\nthe everlasting violence of that double passion with which God hates\nand loves the world.--I am, yours faithfully,\n                                            \"Raymond Percy.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, 'oly, 'oly, 'oly!\" said Mr. Moses Gould.\n\nThe instant he had spoken all the rest knew they had been\nin an almost religious state of submission and assent.\nSomething had bound them together; something in the sacred tradition\nof the last two words of the letter; something also in the touching\nand boyish embarrassment with which Inglewood had read them--\nfor he had all the thin-skinned reverence of the agnostic.\nMoses Gould was as good a fellow in his way as ever lived;\nfar kinder to his family than more refined men of pleasure,\nsimple and steadfast in his admiration, a thoroughly wholesome\nanimal and a thoroughly genuine character.  But wherever there\nis conflict, crises come in which any soul, personal or racial,\nunconsciously turns on the world the most hateful of its hundred faces.\nEnglish reverence, Irish mysticism, American idealism,\nlooked up and saw on the face of Moses a certain smile.\nIt was that smile of the Cynic Triumphant, which has been the tocsin\nfor many a cruel riot in Russian villages or mediaeval towns.\n\n\"Oh, 'oly, 'oly, 'oly!\" said Moses Gould.\n\nFinding that this was not well received, he explained further,\nexuberance deepening on his dark exuberant features.\n\n\"Always fun to see a bloke swallow a wasp when 'e's corfin' up a fly,\"\nhe said pleasantly.  \"Don't you see you've bunged up old Smith anyhow.\nIf this parson's tale's O.K.--why, Smith is 'ot.  'E's pretty 'ot.\nWe find him elopin' with Miss Gray (best respects!) in a cab.\nWell, what abart this Mrs. Smith the curate talks of, with her\nblarsted shyness--transmigogrified into a blighted sharpness?\nMiss Gray ain't been very sharp, but I reckon she'll be pretty shy.\"\n\n\"Don't be a brute,\" growled Michael Moon.\n\nNone could lift their eyes to look at Mary; but Inglewood sent a glance\nalong the table at Innocent Smith.  He was still bowed above his paper toys,\nand a wrinkle was on his forehead that might have been worry or shame.\nHe carefully plucked out one corner of a complicated paper and tucked it\nin elsewhere; then the wrinkle vanished and he looked relieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Chapter III\n\n                       The Round Road;\n                  or, the Desertion Charge\n\n\nPym rose with sincere embarrassment; for he was an American,\nand his respect for ladies was real, and not at all scientific.\n\n\"Ignoring,\" he said, \"the delicate and considerable knightly protests\nthat have been called forth by my colleague's native sense of oration,\nand apologizing to all for whom our wild search for truth seems unsuitable\nto the grand ruins of a feudal land, I still think my colleague's question\nby no means devoid of rel'vancy. The last charge against the accused was\none of burglary; the next charge on the paper is of bigamy and desertion.\nIt does without question appear that the defence, in aspiring to rebut\nthis last charge, have really admitted the next.  Either Innocent Smith\nis still under a charge of attempted burglary, or else that is exploded;\nbut he is pretty well fixed for attempted bigamy.  It all depends on\nwhat view we take of the alleged letter from Curate Percy.  Under these\nconditions I feel justified in claiming my right to questions.\nMay I ask how the defence got hold of the letter from Curate Percy?  Did it\ncome direct from the prisoner?\"\n\n\"We have had nothing direct from the prisoner,\" said Moon quietly.\n\"The few documents which the defence guarantees came to us\nfrom another quarter.\"\n\n\"From what quarter?\" asked Dr. Pym.\n\n\"If you insist,\" answered Moon, \"we had them from Miss Gray.\n\n\"Dr. Cyrus Pym quite forgot to close his eyes, and, instead,\nopened them very wide.\n\n\"Do you really mean to say,\" he said, \"that Miss Gray was in possession\nof this document testifying to a previous Mrs. Smith?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Inglewood, and sat down.\n\nThe doctor said something about infatuation in a low and painful voice,\nand then with visible difficulty continued his opening remarks.\n\n\"Unfortunately the tragic truth revealed by Curate Percy's narrative\nis only too crushingly confirmed by other and shocking documents\nin our own possession.  Of these the principal and most certain is\nthe testimony of Innocent Smith's gardener, who was present at the most\ndramatic and eye-opening of his many acts of marital infidelity.\nMr. Gould, the gardener, please.\"\n\nMr. Gould, with his tireless cheerfulness, arose to present the gardener.\nThat functionary explained that he had served Mr. and Mrs. Innocent Smith\nwhen they had a little house on the edge of Croydon.\nFrom the gardener's tale, with its many small allusions, Inglewood grew\ncertain he had seen the place.  It was one of those corners of town\nor country that one does not forget, for it looked like a frontier.\nThe garden hung very high above the lane, and its end was steep\nand sharp, like a fortress.  Beyond was a roll of real country,\nwith a white path sprawling across it, and the roots, boles, and branches\nof great gray trees writhing and twisting against the sky.\nBut as if to assert that the lane itself was suburban,\nwere sharply relieved against that gray and tossing upland\na lamp-post painted a peculiar yellow-green and a red pillar-box\nthat stood exactly at the corner.  Inglewood was sure of the place;\nhe had passed it twenty times in his constitutionals on the bicycle;\nhe had always dimly felt it was a place where something might occur.\nBut it gave him quite a shiver to feel that the face of his\nfrightful friend or enemy Smith might at any time have appeared\nover the garden bushes above.  The gardener's account,\nunlike the curate's, was quite free from decorative adjectives,\nhowever many he may have uttered privately when writing it.\nHe simply said that on a particular morning Mr. Smith came out\nand began to play about with a rake, as he often did.  Sometimes he\nwould tickle the nose of his eldest child (he had two children);\nsometimes he would hook the rake on to the branch of a tree,\nand hoist himself up with horrible gymnastic jerks, like those of\na giant frog in its final agony.  Never, apparently, did he think\nof putting the rake to any of its proper uses, and the gardener,\nin consequence, treated his actions with coldness and brevity.\nBut the gardener was certain that on one particular morning in October he\n(the gardener) had come round the corner of the house carrying\nthe hose, had seen Mr. Smith standing on the lawn in a striped\nred and white jacket (which might have been his smoking-jacket,\nbut was quite as like a part of his pyjamas), and had heard him then\nand there call out to his wife, who was looking out of the bedroom\nwindow on to the garden, these decisive and very loud expressions--\n\n\"I won't stay here any longer.  I've got another wife and much\nbetter children a long way from here.  My other wife's got redder\nhair than yours, and my other garden's got a much finer situation;\nand I'm going off to them.\"\n\nWith these words, apparently, he sent the rake flying far up into the sky,\nhigher than many could have shot an arrow, and caught it again.\nThen he cleared the hedge at a leap and alighted on his feet down\nin the lane below, and set off up the road without even a hat.\nMuch of the picture was doubtless supplied by Inglewood's accidental\nmemory of the place.  He could see with his mind's eye that big\nbare-headed figure with the ragged rake swaggering up the crooked\nwoodland road, and leaving lamp-post and pillar-box behind.\nBut the gardener, on his own account, was quite prepared to swear\nto the public confession of bigamy, to the temporary disappearance\nof the rake in the sky, and the final disappearance of the man up\nthe road.  Moreover, being a local man, he could swear that, beyond some\nlocal rumours that Smith had embarked on the south-eastern coast,\nnothing was known of him again.\n\nThis impression was somewhat curiously clinched by Michael Moon in the few\nbut clear phrases in which he opened the defence upon the third charge.\nSo far from denying that Smith had fled from Croydon and disappeared on\nthe Continent, he seemed prepared to prove all this on his own account.\n\"I hope you are not so insular,\" he said, \"that you will not respect\nthe word of a French innkeeper as much as that of an English gardener.\nBy Mr. Inglewood's favour we will hear the French innkeeper.\"\n\nBefore the company had decided the delicate point Inglewood was already\nreading the account in question.  It was in French.  It seemed to them\nto run something like this:--\n\n\n\"Sir,--Yes; I am Durobin of Durobin's Cafe on the sea-front at Gras,\nrather north of Dunquerque.  I am willing to write all I know\nof the stranger out of the sea.\n\n\"I have no sympathy with eccentrics or poets.  A man of sense\nlooks for beauty in things deliberately intended to be beautiful,\nsuch as a trim flower-bed or an ivory statuette.  One does not permit\nbeauty to pervade one's whole life, just as one does not pave\nall the roads with ivory or cover all the fields with geraniums.\nMy faith, but we should miss the onions!\n\n\"But whether I read things backwards through my memory, or whether there\nare indeed atmospheres of psychology which the eye of science cannot\nas yet pierce, it is the humiliating fact that on that particular evening\nI felt like a poet--like any little rascal of a poet who drinks absinthe\nin the mad Montmartre.\n\n\"Positively the sea itself looked like absinthe, green and bitter\nand poisonous.  I had never known it look so unfamiliar before.\nIn the sky was that early and stormy darkness that is so depressing to\nthe mind, and the wind blew shrilly round the little lonely coloured kiosk\nwhere they sell the newspapers, and along the sand-hills by the shore.\nThere I saw a fishing-boat with a brown sail standing in silently from\nthe sea.  It was already quite close, and out of it clambered a man\nof monstrous stature, who came wading to shore with the water not up\nto his knees, though it would have reached the hips of many men.\nHe leaned on a long rake or pole, which looked like a trident, and made him\nlook like a Triton.  Wet as he was, and with strips of seaweed clinging\nto him, he walked across to my cafe, and, sitting down at a table outside,\nasked for cherry brandy, a liqueur which I keep, but is seldom demanded.\nThen the monster, with great politeness, invited me to partake\nof a vermouth before my dinner, and we fell into conversation.\nHe had apparently crossed from Kent by a small boat got at a private\nbargain because of some odd fancy he had for passing promptly in an\neasterly direction, and not waiting for any of the official boats.\nHe was, he somewhat vaguely explained, looking for a house.  When I\nnaturally asked him where the house was, he answered that he did not know;\nit was on an island; it was somewhere to the east; or, as he expressed\nit with a hazy and yet impatient gesture, `over there.'\n\n\"I asked him how, if he did not know the place, he would know it when he\nsaw it.  Here he suddenly ceased to be hazy, and became alarmingly minute.\nHe gave a description of the house detailed enough for an auctioneer.\nI have forgotten nearly all the details except the last two, which were\nthat the lamp-post was painted green, and that there was a red pillar-box\nat the corner.\n\n\"`A red pillar-box!' I cried in astonishment.  `Why, the place must\nbe in England!'\n\n\"`I had forgotten,' he said, nodding heavily.  `That is the island's name.'\n\n\"`But, ~nom du nom~,' I cried testily, `you've just come\nfrom England, my boy.'\n\n\"`They SAID it was England,' said my imbecile, conspiratorially.\n`They said it was Kent.  But Kentish men are such liars one can't\nbelieve anything they say.'\n\n\"`Monsieur,' I said, `you must pardon me.  I am elderly,\nand the ~fumisteries~ of the young men are beyond me.\nI go by common sense, or, at the largest, by that extension\nof applied common sense called science.'\n\n\"`Science!' cried the stranger.  `There is only one good thing\nscience ever discovered--a good thing, good tidings of great joy--\nthat the world is round.'\n\n\"I told him with civility that his words conveyed no impression\nto my intelligence.  `I mean,' he said, `that going right round\nthe world is the shortest way to where you are already.'\n\n\"`Is it not even shorter,' I asked, `to stop where you are?'\n\n\"`No, no, no!' he cried emphatically.  `That way is long and very weary.\nAt the end of the world, at the back of the dawn, I shall find\nthe wife I really married and the house that is really mine.\nAnd that house will have a greener lamp-post and a redder pillar-box.\nDo you,' he asked with a sudden intensity, `do you never want to rush\nout of your house in order to find it?'\n\n\"`No, I think not,' I replied; `reason tells a man from\nthe first to adapt his desires to the probable supply of life.\nI remain here, content to fulfil the life of man.\nAll my interests are here, and most of my friends, and--'\n\n\"`And yet,' he cried, starting to his almost terrific height,\n`you made the French Revolution!'\n\n\"`Pardon me,' I said, `I am not quite so elderly.\nA relative perhaps.'\n\n\"`I mean your sort did!' exclaimed this personage.\n`Yes, your damned smug, settled, sensible sort made\nthe French Revolution.  Oh!  I know some say it was no good,\nand you're just back where you were before.  Why, blast it all,\nthat's just where we all want to be--back where we were before!\nThat is revolution--going right round!  Every revolution,\nlike a repentance, is a return.'\n\n\"He was so excited that I waited till he had taken his seat again,\nand then said something indifferent and soothing; but he struck\nthe tiny table with his colossal fist and went on.\n\n\"`I am going to have a revolution, not a French Revolution, but an\nEnglish Revolution.  God has given to each tribe its own type of mutiny.\nThe Frenchmen march against the citadel of the city together; the Englishman\nmarches to the outskirts of the city, and alone.  But I am going to turn\nthe world upside down, too.  I'm going to turn myself upside down.\nI'm going to walk upside down in the cursed upsidedownland of the Antipodes,\nwhere trees and men hang head downward in the sky.  But my revolution,\nlike yours, like the earth's, will end up in the holy, happy place--\nthe celestial, incredible place--the place where we were before.'\n\n\"With these remarks, which can scarcely be reconciled with reason,\nhe leapt from the seat and strode away into the twilight,\nswinging his pole and leaving behind him an excessive payment,\nwhich also pointed to some loss of mental balance.\nThis is all I know of the episode of the man landed from the\nfishing-boat, and I hope it may serve the interests of justice.--\nAccept, Sir, the assurances of the very high consideration,\nwith which I have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n                                            \"Jules Durobin.\"\n\n\n\"The next document in our dossier,\" continued Inglewood,\n\"comes from the town of Crazok, in the central plains of Russia,\nand runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"Sir,--My name is Paul Nickolaiovitch:  I am the stationmaster\nat the station near Crazok.  The great trains go by across\nthe plains taking people to China, but very few people get\ndown at the platform where I have to watch.  This makes my life\nrather lonely, and I am thrown back much upon the books I have.\nBut I cannot discuss these very much with my neighbours,\nfor enlightened ideas have not spread in this part of Russia\nso much as in other parts.  Many of the peasants round here\nhave never heard of Bernard Shaw.\n\n\"I am a Liberal, and do my best to spread Liberal ideas; but since\nthe failure of the revolution this has been even more difficult.\nThe revolutionists committed many acts contrary to the pure principles\nof humanitarianism, with which indeed, owing to the scarcity of books,\nthey were ill acquainted.  I did not approve of these cruel acts,\nthough provoked by the tyranny of the government; but now there\nis a tendency to reproach all Intelligents with the memory of them.\nThis is very unfortunate for Intelligents.\n\n\"It was when the railway strike was almost over, and a few trains\ncame through at long intervals, that I stood one day watching\na train that had come in.  Only one person got out of the train,\nfar away up at the other end of it, for it was a very long train.\nIt was evening, with a cold, greenish sky.  A little snow had fallen,\nbut not enough to whiten the plain, which stretched away a sort\nof sad purple in all directions, save where the flat tops\nof some distant tablelands caught the evening light like lakes.\nAs the solitary man came stamping along on the thin snow by the train\nhe grew larger and larger; I thought I had never seen so large a man.\nBut he looked even taller than he was, I think, because his\nshoulders were very big and his head comparatively little.\nFrom the big shoulders hung a tattered old jacket, striped dull\nred and dirty white, very thin for the winter, and one hand rested\non a huge pole such as peasants rake in weeds with to burn them.\n\n\"Before he had traversed the full length of the train he was entangled in one\nof those knots of rowdies that were the embers of the extinct revolution,\nthough they mostly disgraced themselves upon the government side.\nI was just moving to his assistance, when he whirled up his rake and laid\nout right and left with such energy that he came through them without scathe\nand strode right up to me, leaving them staggered and really astonished.\n\n\"Yet when he reached me, after so abrupt an assertion of his aim,\nhe could only say rather dubiously in French that he wanted a house.\n\n\"`There are not many houses to be had round here,' I answered\nin the same language, `the district has been very disturbed.\nA revolution, as you know, has recently been suppressed.\nAny further building--'\n\n\"`Oh! I don't mean that,' he cried; `I mean a real house--a live house.\nIt really is a live house, for it runs away from me.'\n\n\"`I am ashamed to say that something in his phrase or gesture\nmoved me profoundly.  We Russians are brought up in an atmosphere\nof folk-lore, and its unfortunate effects can still be seen\nin the bright colours of the children's dolls and of the ikons.\nFor an instant the idea of a house running away from a man gave\nme pleasure, for the enlightenment of man moves slowly.\n\n\"`Have you no other house of your own?'  I asked.\n\n\"`I have left it,' he said very sadly.  `It was not the house that grew dull,\nbut I that grew dull in it.  My wife was better than all women, and yet I\ncould not feel it.'\n\n\"`And so,' I said with sympathy, `you walked straight out of the front door,\nlike a masculine Nora.'\n\n\"`Nora?' he inquired politely, apparently supposing it to be a Russian word.\n\n\"`I mean Nora in \"The Doll's House,\"' I replied.\n\n\"At this he looked very much astonished, and I knew he was an Englishman;\nfor Englishmen always think that Russians study nothing but `ukases.'\n\n\"`\"The Doll's House\"?' he cried vehemently; `why, that is just where Ibsen\nwas so wrong!  Why, the whole aim of a house is to be a doll's house.\nDon't you remember, when you were a child, how those little windows\nWERE windows, while the big windows weren't. A child has a doll's house,\nand shrieks when a front door opens inwards.  A banker has a real house,\nyet how numerous are the bankers who fail to emit the faintest shriek\nwhen their real front doors open inwards.'\n\n\"Something from the folk-lore of my infancy still kept me foolishly silent;\nand before I could speak, the Englishman had leaned over and was saying\nin a sort of loud whisper, `I have found out how to make a big thing small.\nI have found out how to turn a house into a doll's house.  Get a long\nway off it:  God lets us turn all things into toys by his great gift\nof distance.  Once let me see my old brick house standing up quite\nlittle against the horizon, and I shall want to go back to it again.\nI shall see the funny little toy lamp-post painted green against the gate,\nand all the dear little people like dolls looking out of the window.\nFor the windows really open in my doll's house.'\n\n\"`But why?'  I asked, `should you wish to return to that particular\ndoll's house?  Having taken, like Nora, the bold step against convention,\nhaving made yourself in the conventional sense disreputable, having dared\nto be free, why should you not take advantage of your freedom?\nAs the greatest modern writers have pointed out, what you called your\nmarriage was only your mood.  You have a right to leave it all behind,\nlike the clippings of your hair or the parings of your nails.\nHaving once escaped, you have the world before you.  Though the words\nmay seem strange to you, you are free in Russia.'\n\n\"He sat with his dreamy eyes on the dark circles of the plains,\nwhere the only moving thing was the long and labouring trail of smoke\nout of the railway engine, violet in tint, volcanic in outline,\nthe one hot and heavy cloud of that cold clear evening of pale green.\n\n\"`Yes,' he said with a huge sigh, `I am free in Russia.  You are right.\nI could really walk into that town over there and have love all over again,\nand perhaps marry some beautiful woman and begin again, and nobody could\never find me.  Yes, you have certainly convinced me of something.'\n\n\"His tone was so queer and mystical that I felt impelled to ask\nhim what he meant, and of what exactly I had convinced him.\n\n\"`You have convinced me,' he said with the same dreamy eye,\n`why it is really wicked and dangerous for a man to run away\nfrom his wife.'\n\n\"`And why is it dangerous?'  I inquired.\n\n\"`Why, because nobody can find him,' answered this odd person,\n`and we all want to be found.'\n\n\"`The most original modern thinkers,' I remarked,\n`Ibsen, Gorki, Nietzsche, Shaw, would all rather say that what we\nwant most is to be lost:  to find ourselves in untrodden paths,\nand to do unprecedented things:  to break with the past and belong\nto the future.'\n\n\"He rose to his whole height somewhat sleepily, and looked round on\nwhat was, I confess, a somewhat desolate scene--the dark purple plains,\nthe neglected railroad, the few ragged knots of malcontents.\n`I shall not find the house here,' he said.  `It is still eastward--\nfurther and further eastward.'\n\n\"Then he turned upon me with something like fury, and struck the foot\nof his pole upon the frozen earth.\n\n\"`And if I do go back to my country,' he cried, `I may be locked up in a\nmadhouse before I reach my own house.  I have been a bit unconventional\nin my time!  Why, Nietzsche stood in a row of ramrods in the silly old\nPrussian army, and Shaw takes temperance beverages in the suburbs;\nbut the things I do are unprecedented things.  This round road I\nam treading is an untrodden path.  I do believe in breaking out;\nI am a revolutionist.  But don't you see that all these real leaps\nand destructions and escapes are only attempts to get back to Eden--\nto something we have had, to something we at least have heard of?\nDon't you see one only breaks the fence or shoots the moon in order\nto get HOME?'\n\n\"`No,' I answered after due reflection, `I don't think I should accept that.'\n\n\"`Ah,' he said with a sort of a sigh, `then you have explained a second\nthing to me.'\n\n\"`What do you mean?'  I asked; `what thing?'\n\n\"`Why your revolution has failed,' he said; and walking across quite\nsuddenly to the train he got into it just as it was steaming away at last.\nAnd as I saw the long snaky tail of it disappear along the darkening flats.\n\n\"I saw no more of him.  But though his views were adverse to the best\nadvanced thought, he struck me as an interesting person:  I should\nlike to find out if he has produced any literary works.--Yours, etc.,\n                                      \"Paul Nickolaiovitch.\"\n\n\nThere was something in this odd set of glimpses into foreign lives which kept\nthe absurd tribunal quieter than it had hitherto been, and it was again\nwithout interruption that Inglewood opened another paper upon his pile.\n\"The Court will be indulgent,\" he said, \"if the next note lacks the special\nceremonies of our letter-writing. It is ceremonious enough in its own way:--\n\n\n\"The Celestial Principles are permanent:  Greeting.--I am Wong-Hi,\nand I tend the temple of all the ancestors of my family in the forest\nof Fu.  The man that broke through the sky and came to me said that it\nmust be very dull, but I showed him the wrongness of his thought.\nI am indeed in one place, for my uncle took me to this\ntemple when I was a boy, and in this I shall doubtless die.\nBut if a man remain in one place he shall see that the place changes.\nThe pagoda of my temple stands up silently out of all the trees,\nlike a yellow pagoda above many green pagodas.  But the skies\nare sometimes blue like porcelain, and sometimes green like jade,\nand sometimes red like garnet.  But the night is always ebony\nand always returns, said the Emperor Ho.\n\n\"The sky-breaker came at evening very suddenly, for I had hardly\nseen any stirring in the tops of the green trees over which I look\nas over a sea, when I go to the top of the temple at morning.\nAnd yet when he came, it was as if an elephant had strayed\nfrom the armies of the great kings of India.  For palms snapped,\nand bamboos broke, and there came forth in the sunshine before\nthe temple one taller than the sons of men.\n\n\"Strips of red and white hung about him like ribbons of a carnival,\nand he carried a pole with a row of teeth on it like the teeth of a dragon.\nHis face was white and discomposed, after the fashion of the foreigners,\nso that they look like dead men filled with devils; and he spoke\nour speech brokenly.\n\n\"He said to me, `This is only a temple; I am trying to find a house.'\nAnd then he told me with indelicate haste that the lamp outside his house\nwas green, and that there was a red post at the corner of it.\n\n\"`I have not seen your house nor any houses,' I answered.\n`I dwell in this temple and serve the gods.'\n\n\"`Do you believe in the gods?' he asked with hunger in his eyes,\nlike the hunger of dogs.  And this seemed to me a strange question\nto ask, for what should a man do except what men have done?\n\n\"`My Lord,' I said, `it must be good for men to hold up their hands even\nif the skies are empty.  For if there are gods, they will be pleased,\nand if there are none, then there are none to be displeased.\nSometimes the skies are gold and sometimes porphyry and sometimes\nebony, but the trees and the temple stand still under it all.\nSo the great Confucius taught us that if we do always the same things\nwith our hands and our feet as do the wise beasts and birds, with our\nheads we may think many things:  yes, my Lord, and doubt many things.\nSo long as men offer rice at the right season, and kindle lanterns\nat the right hour, it matters little whether there be gods or no.\nFor these things are not to appease gods, but to appease men.'\n\n\"He came yet closer to me, so that he seemed enormous;\nyet his look was very gentle.\n\n\"`Break your temple,' he said, `and your gods will be freed.'\n\n\"And I, smiling at his simplicity, answered:  `And so, if there be no gods,\nI shall have nothing but a broken temple.'\n\n\"And at this, that giant from whom the light of reason was\nwithheld threw out his mighty arms and asked me to forgive him.\nAnd when I asked him for what he should be forgiven he answered:\n`For being right.'\n\n\"`Your idols and emperors are so old and wise and satisfying,'\nhe cried, `it is a shame that they should be wrong.\nWe are so vulgar and violent, we have done you so many iniquities--\nit is a shame we should be right after all.'\n\n\"And I, still enduring his harmlessness, asked him why he thought\nthat he and his people were right.\n\n\"And he answered:  `We are right because we are bound where\nmen should be bound, and free where men should be free.\nWe are right because we doubt and destroy laws and customs--\nbut we do not doubt our own right to destroy them.  For you live\nby customs, but we live by creeds.  Behold me!  In my country I\nam called Smip.  My country is abandoned, my name is defiled,\nbecause I pursue around the world what really belongs to me.\nYou are steadfast as the trees because you do not believe.\nI am as fickle as the tempest because I do believe.\nI do believe in my own house, which I shall find again.\nAnd at the last remaineth the green lantern and the red post.'\n\n\"I said to him:  `At the last remaineth only wisdom.'\n\n\"But even as I said the word he uttered a horrible shout,\nand rushing forward disappeared among the trees.\nI have not seen this man again nor any other man.\nThe virtues of the wise are of fine brass.\n                                                  \"Wong-Hi.\"\n\n\n\"The next letter I have to read,\" proceeded Arthur Inglewood, \"will probably\nmake clear the nature of our client's curious but innocent experiment.\nIt is dated from a mountain village in California, and runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"Sir,--A person answering to the rather extraordinary\ndescription required certainly went, some time ago,\nover the high pass of the Sierras on which I live and\nof which I am probably the sole stationary inhabitant.\nI keep a rudimentary tavern, rather ruder than a hut,\non the very top of this specially steep and threatening pass.\nMy name is Louis Hara, and the very name may puzzle you\nabout my nationality.  Well, it puzzles me a great deal.\nWhen one has been for fifteen years without society it is hard\nto have patriotism; and where there is not even a hamlet it\nis difficult to invent a nation.  My father was an Irishman of\nthe fiercest and most free-shooting of the old Californian kind.\nMy mother was a Spaniard, proud of descent from the old\nSpanish families round San Francisco, yet accused for all that\nof some admixture of Red Indian blood.  I was well educated\nand fond of music and books.  But, like many other hybrids,\nI was too good or too bad for the world; and after attempting\nmany things I was glad enough to get a sufficient though\na lonely living in this little cabaret in the mountains.\nIn my solitude I fell into many of the ways of a savage.\nLike an Eskimo, I was shapeless in winter; like a Red Indian, I wore\nin hot summers nothing but a pair of leather trousers, with a\ngreat straw hat as big as a parasol to defend me from the sun.\nI had a bowie knife at my belt and a long gun under my arm;\nand I dare say I produced a pretty wild impression on the few\npeaceable travellers that could climb up to my place.\nBut I promise you I never looked as mad as that man did.\nCompared with him I was Fifth Avenue.\n\n\"I dare say that living under the very top of the Sierras has an odd\neffect on the mind; one tends to think of those lonely rocks not as peaks\ncoming to a point, but rather as pillars holding up heaven itself.\nStraight cliffs sail up and away beyond the hope of the eagles;\ncliffs so tall that they seem to attract the stars and collect them as\nsea-crags collect a mere glitter of phosphorous.  These terraces and towers\nof rock do not, like smaller crests, seem to be the end of the world.\nRather they seem to be its awful beginning:  its huge foundations.\nWe could almost fancy the mountain branching out above us like a tree\nof stone, and carrying all those cosmic lights like a candelabrum.\nFor just as the peaks failed us, soaring impossibly far,\nso the stars crowded us (as it seemed), coming impossibly near.\nThe spheres burst about us more like thunderbolts hurled at the earth\nthan planets circling placidly about it.\n\n\"All this may have driven me mad;  I am not sure.  I know there is one\nangle of the road down the pass where the rock leans out a little,\nand on windy nights I seem to hear it clashing overhead with other rocks--\nyes, city against city and citadel against citadel, far up into the night.\nIt was on such an evening that the strange man struggled up the pass.\nBroadly speaking, only strange men did struggle up the pass.\nBut I had never seen one like this one before.\n\n\"He carried (I cannot conceive why) a long, dilapidated\ngarden rake, all bearded and bedraggled with grasses,\nso that it looked like the ensign of some old barbarian tribe.\nHis hair, which was as long and rank as the grass, hung down\nbelow his huge shoulders; and such clothes as clung about him\nwere rags and tongues of red and yellow, so that he had the air\nof being dressed like an Indian in feathers or autumn leaves.\nThe rake or pitchfork, or whatever it was, he used sometimes\nas an alpenstock, sometimes (I was told) as a weapon.\nI do not know why he should have used it as a weapon, for he had,\nand afterwards showed me, an excellent six-shooter in his pocket.\n`But THAT,' he said, `I use only for peaceful purposes.'\nI have no notion what he meant.\n\n\"He sat down on the rough bench outside my inn and drank some wine\nfrom the vineyards below, sighing with ecstasy over it like one\nwho had travelled long among alien, cruel things and found at last\nsomething that he knew.  Then he sat staring rather foolishly at\nthe rude lantern of lead and coloured glass that hangs over my door.\nIt is old, but of no value; my grandmother gave it to me long ago:\nshe was devout, and it happens that the glass is painted with a crude\npicture of Bethlehem and the Wise Men and the Star.  He seemed\nso mesmerized with the transparent glow of Our Lady's blue gown and\nthe big gold star behind, that he led me also to look at the thing,\nwhich I had not done for fourteen years.\n\n\"Then he slowly withdrew his eyes from this and looked out eastward\nwhere the road fell away below us.  The sunset sky was a vault\nof rich velvet, fading away into mauve and silver round the edges\nof the dark mountain amphitheatre; and between us and the ravine below\nrose up out of the deeps and went up into the heights the straight\nsolitary rock we call Green Finger.  Of a queer volcanic colour,\nand wrinkled all over with what looks undecipherable writing,\nit hung there like a Babylonian pillar or needle.\n\n\"The man silently stretched out his rake in that direction,\nand before he spoke I knew what he meant.  Beyond the great green\nrock in the purple sky hung a single star.\n\n\"`A star in the east,' he said in a strange hoarse voice like one of our\nancient eagles'. `The wise men followed the star and found the house.\nBut if I followed the star, should I find the house?'\n\n\"`It depends perhaps,' I said, smiling, `on whether you are a wise man.'\nI refrained from adding that he certainly didn't look it.\n\n\"`You may judge for yourself,' he answered.  `I am a man who left his own\nhouse because he could no longer bear to be away from it.'\n\n\"`It certainly sounds paradoxical,' I said.\n\n\"`I heard my wife and children talking and saw them moving\nabout the room,' he continued, `and all the time I knew\nthey were walking and talking in another house thousands\nof miles away, under the light of different skies, and beyond\nthe series of the seas.  I loved them with a devouring love,\nbecause they seemed not only distant but unattainable.\nNever did human creatures seem so dear and so desirable:\nbut I seemed like a cold ghost; therefore I cast off\ntheir dust from my feet for a testimony.  Nay, I did more.\nI spurned the world under my feet so that it swung full circle\nlike a treadmill.'\n\n\"`Do you really mean,' I cried, `that you have come right round the world?\nYour speech is English, yet you are coming from the west.'\n\n\"`My pilgrimage is not yet accomplished,' he replied sadly.\n`I have become a pilgrim to cure myself of being an exile.'\n\n\"Something in the word `pilgrim' awoke down in the roots\nof my ruinous experience memories of what my fathers had\nfelt about the world, and of something from whence I came.\nI looked again at the little pictured lantern at which I had\nnot looked for fourteen years.\n\n\"`My grandmother,' I said in a low tone, `would have said that we\nwere all in exile, and that no earthly house could cure the holy\nhome-sickness that forbids us rest.'\n\n\"He was silent a long while, and watched a single eagle drift\nout beyond the Green Finger into the darkening void.\n\n\"Then he said, `I think your grandmother was right,' and stood up\nleaning on his grassy pole.  `I think that must be the reason,'\nhe said--`the secret of this life of man, so ecstatic and so unappeased.\nBut I think there is more to be said.  I think God has given us\nthe love of special places, of a hearth and of a native land,\nfor a good reason.'\n\n\"`I dare say,' I said.  `What reason?'\n\n\"`Because otherwise,' he said, pointing his pole out at the sky and the abyss,\n`we might worship that.'\n\n\"`What do you mean?'  I demanded.\n\n\"`Eternity,' he said in his harsh voice, `the largest of the idols--\nthe mightiest of the rivals of God.'\n\n\"`You mean pantheism and infinity and all that,' I suggested.\n\n\"`I mean,' he said with increasing vehemence, `that if there be a house\nfor me in heaven it will either have a green lamp-post and a hedge,\nor something quite as positive and personal as a green lamp-post\nand a hedge.  I mean that God bade me love one spot and serve it,\nand do all things however wild in praise of it, so that this one spot\nmight be a witness against all the infinities and the sophistries,\nthat Paradise is somewhere and not anywhere, is something and not anything.\nAnd I would not be so very much surprised if the house in heaven had\na real green lamp-post after all.'\n\n\"With which he shouldered his pole and went striding down\nthe perilous paths below, and left me alone with the eagles.\nBut since he went a fever of homelessness will often shake me.\nI am troubled by rainy meadows and mud cabins that I have\nnever seen; and I wonder whether America will endure.--\nYours faithfully, Louis Hara.\"\n\n\nAfter a short silence Inglewood said:  \"And, finally, we desire\nto put in as evidence the following document:--\n\n\n\"This is to say that I am Ruth Davis, and have been housemaid to\nMrs. I. Smith at `The Laurels' in Croydon for the last six months.\nWhen I came the lady was alone, with two children; she was not a widow,\nbut her husband was away.  She was left with plenty of money and did not\nseem disturbed about him, though she often hoped he would be back soon.\nShe said he was rather eccentric and a little change did him good.\nOne evening last week I was bringing the tea-things out on to the lawn\nwhen I nearly dropped them.  The end of a long rake was suddenly stuck\nover the hedge, and planted like a jumping-pole; and over the hedge,\njust like a monkey on a stick, came a huge, horrible man, all hairy\nand ragged like Robinson Crusoe.  I screamed out, but my mistress didn't\neven get out of her chair, but smiled and said he wanted shaving.\nThen he sat down quite calmly at the garden table and took a cup\nof tea, and then I realized that this must be Mr. Smith himself.\nHe has stopped here ever since and does not really give much trouble,\nthough I sometimes fancy he is a little weak in his head.\n                                                \"Ruth Davis.\n\n\"P.S.--I forgot to say that he looked round at the garden and said,\nvery loud and strong:  `Oh, what a lovely place you've got;'\njust as if he'd never seen it before.\"\n\n\nThe room had been growing dark and drowsy; the afternoon sun sent one\nheavy shaft of powdered gold across it, which fell with an intangible\nsolemnity upon the empty seat of Mary Gray, for the younger women\nhad left the court before the more recent of the investigations.\nMrs. Duke was still asleep, and Innocent Smith, looking like a large\nhunchback in the twilight, was bending closer and closer to his paper toys.\nBut the five men really engaged in the controversy, and concerned not\nto convince the tribunal but to convince each other, still sat round\nthe table like the Committee of Public Safety.\n\nSuddenly Moses Gould banged one big scientific book on top of another,\ncocked his little legs up against the table, tipped his chair\nbackwards so far as to be in direct danger of falling over,\nemitted a startling and prolonged whistle like a steam engine,\nand asserted that it was all his eye.\n\nWhen asked by Moon what was all his eye, he banged down behind\nthe books again and answered with considerable excitement,\nthrowing his papers about.  \"All those fairy-tales you've\nbeen reading out,\" he said.  \"Oh! don't talk to me!\nI ain't littery and that, but I know fairy-tales when I hear 'em.\nI got a bit stumped in some of the philosophical bits\nand felt inclined to go out for a B. and S. But we're living\nin West 'Ampstead and not in 'Ell; and the long and the short\nof it is that some things 'appen and some things don't 'appen.\nThose are the things that don't 'appen.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said Moon gravely, \"that we quite clearly explained--\"\n\n\"Oh yes, old chap, you quite clearly explained,\" assented Mr. Gould\nwith extraordinary volubility.  \"You'd explain an elephant\noff the doorstep, you would.  I ain't a clever chap like you;\nbut I ain't a born natural, Michael Moon, and when there's\nan elephant on my doorstep I don't listen to no explanations.\n`It's got a trunk,' I says.--`My trunk,' you says:\n`I'm fond of travellin', and a change does me good.'--`But\nthe blasted thing's got tusks,' I says.--`Don't look a gift 'orse\nin the mouth,' you says, `but thank the goodness and the graice\nthat on your birth 'as smiled.'--`But it's nearly as big as\nthe 'ouse,' I says.--`That's the bloomin' perspective,' you says,\n`and the sacred magic of distance.'--`Why, the elephant's trumpetin'\nlike the Day of Judgement,' I says.--`That's your own conscience\na-talking to you, Moses Gould,' you says in a grive and\ntender voice.  Well, I 'ave got a conscience as much as you.\nI don't believe most of the things they tell you in church\non Sundays; and I don't believe these 'ere things any more\nbecause you goes on about 'em as if you was in church.\nI believe an elephant's a great big ugly dingerous beast--\nand I believe Smith's another.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" asked Inglewood, \"that you still doubt the evidence\nof exculpation we have brought forward?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do still doubt it,\" said Gould warmly.  \"It's all\na bit too far-fetched, and some of it a bit too far off.\n'Ow can we test all those tales?  'Ow can we drop in and buy\nthe `Pink 'Un' at the railway station at Kosky Wosky or whatever\nit was?  'Ow can we go and do a gargle at the saloon-bar on top\nof the Sierra Mountains?  But anybody can go and see Bunting's\nboarding-house at Worthing.\"\n\nMoon regarded him with an expression of real or assumed surprise.\n\n\"Any one,\" continued Gould, \"can call on Mr. Trip.\"\n\n\"It is a comforting thought,\" replied Michael with restraint;\n\"but why should any one call on Mr. Trip?\"\n\n\"For just exactly the sime reason,\" cried the excited Moses,\nhammering on the table with both hands, \"for just exactly the sime\nreason that he should communicate with Messrs.  'Anbury and Bootle\nof Paternoster Row and with Miss Gridley's 'igh class Academy\nat 'Endon, and with old Lady Bullingdon who lives at Penge.\"\n\n\"Again, to go at once to the moral roots of life,\" said Michael,\n\"why is it among the duties of man to communicate with old\nLady Bullingdon who lives at Penge?\"\n\n\"It ain't one of the duties of man,\" said Gould, \"nor one of his pleasures,\neither, I can tell you.  She takes the crumpet, does Lady Bullingdon\nat Penge.  But it's one of the duties of a prosecutor pursuin'\nthe innocent, blameless butterfly career of your friend Smith,\nand it's the sime with all the others I mentioned.\"\n\n\"But why do you bring in these people here?\" asked Inglewood.\n\n\"Why!  Because we've got proof enough to sink a steamboat,\"\nroared Moses; \"because I've got the papers in my very 'and;\nbecause your precious Innocent is a blackguard and 'ome smasher,\nand these are the 'omes he's smashed.  I don't set up for a 'oly man;\nbut I wouldn't 'ave all those poor girls on my conscience for something.\nAnd I think a chap that's capable of deserting and perhaps\nkilling 'em all is about capable of cracking a crib or shootin'\nan old schoolmaster--so I don't care much about the other yarns\none way or another.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Dr. Cyrus Pym with a refined cough,\n\"that we are approaching this matter rather irregularly.\nThis is really the fourth charge on the charge sheet,\nand perhaps I had better put it before you in an ordered\nand scientific manner.\"\n\nNothing but a faint groan from Michael broke the silence\nof the darkening room.\n\n\n\n\n                         Chapter IV\n\n                     The Wild Weddings;\n                   or, the Polygamy Charge\n\n\n\"A modern man,\" said Dr. Cyrus Pym, \"must, if he be thoughtful,\napproach the problem of marriage with some caution.\nMarriage is a stage--doubtless a suitable stage--in the long\nadvance of mankind towards a goal which we cannot as yet conceive;\nwhich we are not, perhaps, as yet fitted even to desire.\nWhat, gentlemen, is the ethical position of marriage?\nHave we outlived it?\"\n\n\"Outlived it?\" broke out Moon; \"why, nobody's ever survived it!\nLook at all the people married since Adam and Eve--and all\nas dead as mutton.\"\n\n\"This is no doubt an inter-pellation joc'lar in its character,\"\nsaid Dr. Pym frigidly.  \"I cannot tell what may be Mr. Moon's\nmatured and ethical view of marriage--\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" said Michael savagely, out of the gloom.  \"Marriage is a duel\nto the death, which no man of honour should decline.\"\n\n\"Michael,\" said Arthur Inglewood in a low voice, \"you MUST keep quiet.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moon,\" said Pym with exquisite good temper, \"probably regards\nthe institution in a more antiquated manner.  Probably he would make\nit stringent and uniform.  He would treat divorce in some great soul\nof steel--the divorce of a Julius Caesar or of a Salt Ring Robinson--\nexactly as he would treat some no-account tramp or labourer who\nscoots from his wife.  Science has views broader and more humane.\nJust as murder for the scientist is a thirst for absolute destruction,\njust as theft for the scientist is a hunger for monotonous acquisition,\nso polygamy for the scientist is an extreme development of the instinct\nfor variety.  A man thus afflicted is incapable of constancy.\nDoubtless there is a physical cause for this flitting from flower to flower--\nas there is, doubtless, for the intermittent groaning which appears\nto afflict Mr. Moon at the present moment.  Our own world-scorning\nWinterbottom has even dared to say, `For a certain rare and fine\nphysical type polygamy is but the realization of the variety of females,\nas comradeship is the realization of the variety of males.'\nIn any case, the type that tends to variety is recognized by all\nauthoritative inquirers.  Such a type, if the widower of a negress,\ndoes in many ascertained cases espouse ~en seconde noces~ an albino;\nsuch a type, when freed from the gigantic embraces of a female Patagonian,\nwill often evolve from its own imaginative instinct the consoling figure of\nan Eskimo.  To such a type there can be no doubt that the prisoner belongs.\nIf blind doom and unbearable temptation constitute any slight excuse\nfor a man, there is no doubt that he has these excuses.\n\n\"Earlier in the inquiry the defence showed real chivalric\nideality in admitting half of our story without further dispute.\nWe should like to acknowledge and imitate so eminently large-hearted\na style by conceding also that the story told by Curate Percy about\nthe canoe, the weir, and the young wife seems to be substantially true.\nApparently Smith did marry a young woman he had nearly run down in a boat;\nit only remains to be considered whether it would not have been\nkinder of him to have murdered her instead of marrying her.\nIn confirmation of this fact I can now con-cede to the defence\nan unquestionable record of such a marriage.\"\n\nSo saying, he handed across to Michael a cutting from the\n\"Maidenhead Gazette\" which distinctly recorded the marriage\nof the daughter of a \"coach,\" a tutor well known in the place,\nto Mr. Innocent Smith, late of Brakespeare College, Cambridge.\n\nWhen Dr. Pym resumed it was realized that his face had grown\nat once both tragic and triumphant.\n\n\"I pause upon this pre-liminary fact,\" he said seriously,\n\"because this fact alone would give us the victory,\nwere we aspiring after victory and not after truth.\nAs far as the personal and domestic problem holds us,\nthat problem is solved.  Dr. Warner and I entered this house at\nan instant of highly emotional diff'culty. England's Warner has\nentered many houses to save human kind from sickness; this time\nhe entered to save an innocent lady from a walking pestilence.\nSmith was just about to carry away a young girl from this house;\nhis cab and bag were at the very door.  He had told her she was\ngoing to await the marriage license at the house of his aunt.\nThat aunt,\" continued Cyrus Pym, his face darkening grandly--\"that\nvisionary aunt had been the dancing will-o'-the-wisp\nwho had led many a high-souled maiden to her doom.\nInto how many virginal ears has he whispered that holy word?\nWhen he said `aunt' there glowed about her all the merriment\nand high morality of the Anglo-Saxon home.  Kettles began to hum,\npussy cats to purr, in that very wild cab that was being\ndriven to destruction.\"\n\nInglewood looked up, to find, to his astonishment (as many another\ndenizen of the eastern hemisphere has found), that the American was\nnot only perfectly serious, but was really eloquent and affecting--\nwhen the difference of the hemispheres was adjusted.\n\n\"It is therefore atrociously evident that the man Smith has at\nleast represented himself to one innocent female of this house\nas an eligible bachelor, being, in fact, a married man.  I agree with\nmy colleague, Mr. Gould, that no other crime could approximate to this.\nAs to whether what our ancestors called purity has any ultimate ethical\nvalue indeed, science hesitates with a high, proud hesitation.\nBut what hesitation can there be about the baseness of a citizen\nwho ventures, by brutal experiments upon living females, to anticipate\nthe verdict of science on such a point?\n\n\"The woman mentioned by Curate Percy as living with Smith\nin Highbury may or may not be the same as the lady he married\nin Maidenhead.  If one short sweet spell of constancy and heart\nrepose interrupted the plunging torrent of his profligate life,\nwe will not deprive him of that long past possibility.\nAfter that conjectural date, alas, he seems to have plunged deeper\nand deeper into the shaking quagmires of infidelity and shame.\"\n\nDr. Pym closed his eyes, but the unfortunate fact that there was no more\nlight left this familiar signal without its full and proper moral effect.\nAfter a pause, which almost partook of the character of prayer, he continued.\n\n\"The first instance of the accused's repeated and irregular nuptials,\"\nhe exclaimed, \"comes from Lady Bullingdon, who expresses herself\nwith the high haughtiness which must be excused in those who look\nout upon all mankind from the turrets of a Norman and ancestral keep.\nThe communication she has sent to us runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"Lady Bullingdon recalls the painful incident to which reference\nis made, and has no desire to deal with it in detail.\nThe girl Polly Green was a perfectly adequate dressmaker,\nand lived in the village for about two years.  Her unattached\ncondition was bad for her as well as for the general morality\nof the village.  Lady Bullingdon, therefore, allowed it to be\nunderstood that she favoured the marriage of the young woman.\nThe villagers, naturally wishing to oblige Lady Bullingdon,\ncame forward in several cases; and all would have been well had it\nnot been for the deplorable eccentricity or depravity of the girl\nGreen herself.  Lady Bullingdon supposes that where there is\na village there must be a village idiot, and in her village,\nit seems, there was one of these wretched creatures.\nLady Bullingdon only saw him once, and she is quite aware\nthat it is really difficult to distinguish between actual\nidiots and the ordinary heavy type of the rural lower classes.\nShe noticed, however, the startling smallness of his head\nin comparison to the rest of his body; and, indeed, the fact\nof his having appeared upon election day wearing the rosette\nof both the two opposing parties appears to Lady Bullingdon\nto put the matter quite beyond doubt.  Lady Bullingdon was\nastounded to learn that this afflicted being had put himself\nforward as one of the suitors of the girl in question.\nLady Bullingdon's nephew interviewed the wretch upon the point,\ntelling him that he was a `donkey' to dream of such a thing,\nand actually received, along with an imbecile grin,\nthe answer that donkeys generally go after carrots.\nBut Lady Bullingdon was yet further amazed to find the unhappy\ngirl inclined to accept this monstrous proposal, though she\nwas actually asked in marriage by Garth, the undertaker, a man\nin a far superior position to her own.  Lady Bullingdon could not,\nof course, countenance such an arrangement for a moment,\nand the two unhappy persons escaped for a clandestine marriage.\nLady Bullingdon cannot exactly recall the man's name,\nbut thinks it was Smith.  He was always called in the village\nthe Innocent.  Later, Lady Bullingdon believes he murdered\nGreen in a mental outbreak.\"\n\n\n\"The next communication,\" proceeded Pym, \"is more conspicuous for brevity,\nbut I am of the opinion that it will adequately convey the upshot.\nIt is dated from the offices of Messrs.  Hanbury and Bootle, publishers,\nand is as follows:--\n\n\n\"Sir,--Yrs.  rcd.  and conts.  noted.  Rumour re typewriter possibly refers\nto a Miss Blake or similar name, left here nine years ago to marry an\norgan-grinder. Case was undoubtedly curious, and attracted police attention.\nGirl worked excellently till about Oct. 1907, when apparently went mad.\nRecord was written at the time, part of which I enclose.--\nYrs., etc., W. Trip.\n\n\n\"The fuller statement runs as follows:--\n\n\n\"On October 12 a letter was sent from this office to Messrs.\nBernard and Juke, bookbinders.  Opened by Mr. Juke, it was found\nto contain the following:  `Sir, our Mr. Trip will call at 3,\nas we wish to know whether it is really decided 00000073bb!!!!!xy.'\nTo this Mr. Juke, a person of a playful mind, returned the answer:\n`Sir, I am in a position to give it as my most decided opinion\nthat it is not really decided that 00000073bb!!!!!xy. Yrs., etc.,\n                                                  `J. Juke.'\n\n\n\"On receiving this extraordinary reply, our Mr. Trip asked for the original\nletter sent from him, and found that the typewriter had indeed substituted\nthese demented hieroglyphics for the sentences really dictated to her.\nOur Mr. Trip interviewed the girl, fearing that she was in an\nunbalanced state, and was not much reassured when she merely remarked\nthat she always went like that when she heard the barrel organ.\nBecoming yet more hysterical and extravagant, she made a series of most\nimprobable statements--as, that she was engaged to the barrel-organ man,\nthat he was in the habit of serenading her on that instrument,\nthat she was in the habit of playing back to him upon the typewriter\n(in the style of King Richard and Blondel), and that the organ man's\nmusical ear was so exquisite and his adoration of herself so ardent\nthat he could detect the note of the different letters on the machine,\nand was enraptured by them as by a melody.  To all these statements\nof course our Mr. Trip and the rest of us only paid that sort of assent\nthat is paid to persons who must as quickly as possible be put in the\ncharge of their relations.  But on our conducting the lady downstairs,\nher story received the most startling and even exasperating confirmation;\nfor the organ-grinder, an enormous man with a small head and manifestly\na fellow-lunatic, had pushed his barrel organ in at the office doors\nlike a battering-ram, and was boisterously demanding his alleged fiancee.\nWhen I myself came on the scene he was flinging his great, ape-like arms about\nand reciting a poem to her.  But we were used to lunatics coming and reciting\npoems in our office, and we were not quite prepared for what followed.\nThe actual verse he uttered began, I think,\n\n        `O vivid, inviolate head,\n         Ringed --'\n\nbut he never got any further.  Mr. Trip made a sharp\nmovement towards him, and the next moment the giant picked\nup the poor lady typewriter like a doll, sat her on top\nof the organ, ran it with a crash out of the office doors,\nand raced away down the street like a flying wheelbarrow.\nI put the police upon the matter; but no trace of the amazing\npair could be found.  I was sorry myself; for the lady was\nnot only pleasant but unusually cultivated for her position.\nAs I am leaving the service of Messrs.  Hanbury and Bootle, I put\nthese things in a record and leave it with them.\n                                     (Signed) Aubrey Clarke,\n                                        Publishers' Reader.\n\n\n\"And the last document,\" said Dr. Pym complacently, \"is from\none of those high-souled women who have in this age introduced\nyour English girlhood to hockey, the higher mathematics,\nand every form of ideality.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir (she writes),--I have no objection to telling you\nthe facts about the absurd incident you mention; though I would\nask you to communicate them with some caution, for such things,\nhowever entertaining in the abstract, are not always auxiliary\nto the success of a girls' school.  The truth is this:\nI wanted some one to deliver a lecture on a philological\nor historical question--a lecture which, while containing\nsolid educational matter, should be a little more popular and\nentertaining than usual, as it was the last lecture of the term.\nI remembered that a Mr. Smith of Cambridge had written somewhere\nor other an amusing essay about his own somewhat ubiquitous name--\nan essay which showed considerable knowledge of genealogy\nand topography.  I wrote to him, asking if he would come and\ngive us a bright address upon English surnames; and he did.\nIt was very bright, almost too bright.  To put the matter otherwise,\nby the time that he was halfway through it became apparent\nto the other mistresses and myself that the man was totally\nand entirely off his head.  He began rationally enough by dealing\nwith the two departments of place names and trade names, and he said\n(quite rightly, I dare say) that the loss of all significance\nin names was an instance of the deadening of civilization.\nBut then he went on calmly to maintain that every man who had\na place name ought to go to live in that place, and that every\nman who had a trade name ought instantly to adopt that trade;\nthat people named after colours should always dress in those colours,\nand that people named after trees or plants (such as Beech or Rose)\nought to surround and decorate themselves with these vegetables.\nIn a slight discussion that arose afterwards among the elder girls\nthe difficulties of the proposal were clearly, and even eagerly,\npointed out.  It was urged, for instance, by Miss Younghusband\nthat it was substantially impossible for her to play the part\nassigned to her; Miss Mann was in a similar dilemma, from which\nno modern views on the sexes could apparently extricate her;\nand some young ladies, whose surnames happened to be Low, Coward,\nand Craven, were quite enthusiastic against the idea.\nBut all this happened afterwards.  What happened at the crucial\nmoment was that the lecturer produced several horseshoes and a\nlarge iron hammer from his bag, announced his immediate intention\nof setting up a smithy in the neighbourhood, and called on every\none to rise in the same cause as for a heroic revolution.\nThe other mistresses and I attempted to stop the wretched man,\nbut I must confess that by an accident this very intercession\nproduced the worst explosion of his insanity.  He was waving\nthe hammer, and wildly demanding the names of everybody;\nand it so happened that Miss Brown, one of the younger teachers,\nwas wearing a brown dress--a reddish-brown dress that went quietly\nenough with the warmer colour of her hair, as well she knew.\nShe was a nice girl, and nice girls do know about those things.\nBut when our maniac discovered that we really had a Miss Brown\nwho WAS brown, his ~idee fixe~ blew up like a powder magazine,\nand there, in the presence of all the mistresses and girls,\nhe publicly proposed to the lady in the red-brown dress.\nYou can imagine the effect of such a scene at a girls' school.\nAt least, if you fail to imagine it, I certainly fail\nto describe it.\n\n\"Of course, the anarchy died down in a week or two, and I can\nthink of it now as a joke.  There was only one curious detail,\nwhich I will tell you, as you say your inquiry is vital; but I should\ndesire you to consider it a little more confidential than the rest.\nMiss Brown, who was an excellent girl in every way, did quite\nsuddenly and surreptitiously leave us only a day or two afterwards.\nI should never have thought that her head would be the one\nto be really turned by so absurd an excitement.--Believe me,\nyours faithfully, Ada Gridley.\n\n\n\"I think,\" said Pym, with a really convincing simplicity and seriousness,\n\"that these letters speak for themselves.\"\n\nMr. Moon rose for the last time in a darkness that gave no hint\nof whether his native gravity was mixed with his native irony.\n\n\"Throughout this inquiry,\" he said, \"but especially in this its\nclosing phase, the prosecution has perpetually relied upon one argument;\nI mean the fact that no one knows what has become of all the unhappy\nwomen apparently seduced by Smith.  There is no sort of proof\nthat they were murdered, but that implication is perpetually made\nwhen the question is asked as to how they died.  Now I am not\ninterested in how they died, or when they died, or whether they died.\nBut I am interested in another analogous question--that of how they\nwere born, and when they were born, and whether they were born.\nDo not misunderstand me.  I do not dispute the existence of\nthese women, or the veracity of those who have witnessed to them.\nI merely remark on the notable fact that only one of these victims,\nthe Maidenhead girl, is described as having any home or parents.\nAll the rest are boarders or birds of passage--a guest, a solitary\ndressmaker, a bachelor-girl doing typewriting.  Lady Bullingdon,\nlooking from her turrets, which she bought from the Whartons with\nthe old soap-boiler's money when she jumped at marrying an unsuccessful\ngentleman from Ulster--Lady Bullingdon, looking out from those turrets,\ndid really see an object which she describes as Green.  Mr. Trip,\nof Hanbury and Bootle, really did have a typewriter betrothed\nto Smith.  Miss Gridley, though idealistic, is absolutely honest.\nShe did house, feed, and teach a young woman whom Smith succeeded\nin decoying away.  We admit that all these women really lived.\nBut we still ask whether they were ever born?\"\n\n\"Oh, crikey!\" said Moses Gould, stifled with amusement.\n\n\"There could hardly,\" interposed Pym with a quiet smile,\n\"be a better instance of the neglect of true scientific process.\nThe scientist, when once convinced of the fact of vitality\nand consciousness, would infer from these the previous\nprocess of generation.\"\n\n\"If these gals,\" said Gould impatiently--\"if these gals were all alive\n(all alive O!) I'd chance a fiver they were all born.\"\n\n\"You'd lose your fiver,\" said Michael, speaking gravely out of the gloom.\n\"All those admirable ladies were alive.  They were more alive for having\ncome into contact with Smith.  They were all quite definitely alive,\nbut only one of them was ever born.\"\n\n\"Are you asking us to believe--\" began Dr. Pym.\n\n\"I am asking you a second question,\" said Moon sternly.  \"Can the court\nnow sitting throw any light on a truly singular circumstance?\nDr. Pym, in his interesting lecture on what are called, I believe,\nthe relations of the sexes, said that Smith was the slave\nof a lust for variety which would lead a man first to a negress\nand then to an albino, first to a Patagonian giantess and then\nto a tiny Eskimo.  But is there any evidence of such variety here?\nIs there any trace of a gigantic Patagonian in the story?\nWas the typewriter an Eskimo?  So picturesque a circumstance would not\nsurely have escaped remark.  Was Lady Bullingdon's dressmaker a negress?\nA voice in my bosom answers, `No!' Lady Bullingdon, I am sure,\nwould think a negress so conspicuous as to be almost Socialistic,\nand would feel something a little rakish even about an albino.\n\n\"But was there in Smith's taste any such variety as the learned\ndoctor describes?  So far as our slight materials go,\nthe very opposite seems to be the case.  We have only\none actual description of any of the prisoner's wives--\nthe short but highly poetic account by the aesthetic curate.\n`Her dress was the colour of spring, and her hair of autumn leaves.'\nAutumn leaves, of course, are of various colours, some of\nwhich would be rather startling in hair (green, for instance);\nbut I think such an expression would be most naturally used of\nthe shades from red-brown to red, especially as ladies with their\ncoppery-coloured hair do frequently wear light artistic greens.\nNow when we come to the next wife, we find the eccentric lover,\nwhen told he is a donkey, answering that donkeys always go\nafter carrots; a remark which Lady Bullingdon evidently\nregarded as pointless and part of the natural table-talk of a\nvillage idiot, but which has an obvious meaning if we suppose\nthat Polly's hair was red.  Passing to the next wife, the one\nhe took from the girls' school, we find Miss Gridley noticing\nthat the schoolgirl in question wore `a reddish-brown dress,\nthat went quietly enough with the warmer colour of her hair.'\nIn other words, the colour of the girl's hair was something redder\nthan red-brown. Lastly, the romantic organ-grinder declaimed\nin the office some poetry that only got as far as the words,--\n\n        `O vivid, inviolate head,\n         Ringed --'\n\nBut I think that a wide study of the worst modern poets\nwill enable us to guess that `ringed with a glory of red,'\nor `ringed with its passionate red,' was the line that rhymed\nto `head.' In this case once more, therefore, there is good\nreason to suppose that Smith fell in love with a girl with\nsome sort of auburn or darkish-red hair--rather,\" he said,\nlooking down at the table, \"rather like Miss Gray's hair.\"\n\nCyrus Pym was leaning forward with lowered eyelids,\nready with one of his more pedantic interpellations;\nbut Moses Gould suddenly struck his forefinger on his nose,\nwith an expression of extreme astonishment and intelligence\nin his brilliant eyes.\n\n\"Mr. Moon's contention at present,\" interposed Pym, \"is not,\neven if veracious, inconsistent with the lunatico-criminal view\nof I. Smith, which we have nailed to the mast.  Science has\nlong anticipated such a complication.  An incurable attraction\nto a particular type of physical woman is one of the commonest\nof criminal per-versities, and when not considered narrowly,\nbut in the light of induction and evolution--\"\n\n\"At this late stage,\" said Michael Moon very quietly, \"I may perhaps\nrelieve myself of a simple emotion that has been pressing me\nthroughout the proceedings, by saying that induction and evolution\nmay go and boil themselves.  The Missing Link and all that is\nwell enough for kids, but I'm talking about things we know here.\nAll we know of the Missing Link is that he is missing--and he won't\nbe missed either.  I know all about his human head and his horrid tail;\nthey belong to a very old game called `Heads I win, tails you lose.'\nIf you do find a fellow's bones, it proves he lived a long while ago;\nif you don't find his bones, it proves how long ago he lived.\nThat is the game you've been playing with this Smith affair.\nBecause Smith's head is small for his shoulders you call\nhim microcephalous; if it had been large, you'd have called it\nwater-on-the-brain. As long as poor old Smith's seraglio seemed\npretty various, variety was the sign of madness:  now, because it's\nturning out to be a bit monochrome--now monotony is the sign of madness.\nI suffer from all the disadvantages of being a grown-up person,\nand I'm jolly well going to get some of the advantages too;\nand with all politeness I propose not to be bullied with long words\ninstead of short reasons, or consider your business a triumphant\nprogress merely because you're always finding out that you were wrong.\nHaving relieved myself of these feelings, I have merely to add\nthat I regard Dr. Pym as an ornament to the world far more beautiful\nthan the Parthenon, or the monument on Bunker's Hill, and that I\npropose to resume and conclude my remarks on the many marriages\nof Mr. Innocent Smith.\n\n\"Besides this red hair, there is another unifying thread that\nruns through these scattered incidents.  There is something\nvery peculiar and suggestive about the names of these women.\nMr. Trip, you will remember, said he thought the typewriter's\nname was Blake, but could not remember exactly.\nI suggest that it might have been Black, and in that case we\nhave a curious series:  Miss Green in Lady Bullingdon's village;\nMiss Brown at the Hendon School; Miss Black at the publishers.\nA chord of colours, as it were, which ends up with Miss Gray\nat Beacon House, West Hampstead.\"\n\nAmid a dead silence Moon continued his exposition.\n\"What is the meaning of this queer coincidence about colours?\nPersonally I cannot doubt for a moment that these names are purely\narbitrary names, assumed as part of some general scheme or joke.\nI think it very probable that they were taken from a series of costumes--\nthat Polly Green only meant Polly (or Mary) when in green,\nand that Mary Gray only means Mary (or Polly) when in gray.\nThis would explain--\"\n\nCyrus Pym was standing up rigid and almost pallid.\n\"Do you actually mean to suggest--\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Michael; \"I do mean to suggest that.  Innocent Smith has had\nmany wooings, and many weddings for all I know; but he has had only one wife.\nShe was sitting on that chair an hour ago, and is now talking to Miss Duke\nin the garden.\n\n\"Yes, Innocent Smith has behaved here, as he has on hundreds of\nother occasions, upon a plain and perfectly blameless principle.\nIt is odd and extravagant in the modern world, but not more than any other\nprinciple plainly applied in the modern world would be.  His principle\ncan be quite simply stated:  he refuses to die while he is still alive.\nHe seeks to remind himself, by every electric shock to the intellect,\nthat he is still a man alive, walking on two legs about the world.\nFor this reason he fires bullets at his best friends; for this reason\nhe arranges ladders and collapsible chimneys to steal his own property;\nfor this reason he goes plodding around a whole planet to get back to his\nown home; and for this reason he has been in the habit of taking the woman\nwhom he loved with a permanent loyalty, and leaving her about (so to speak)\nat schools, boarding-houses, and places of business, so that he might\nrecover her again and again with a raid and a romantic elopement.\nHe seriously sought by a perpetual recapture of his bride to keep alive\nthe sense of her perpetual value, and the perils that should be run\nfor her sake.\n\n\"So far his motives are clear enough; but perhaps his convictions are\nnot quite so clear.  I think Innocent Smith has an idea at the bottom\nof all this.  I am by no means sure that I believe it myself, but I am\nquite sure that it is worth a man's uttering and defending.\n\n\"The idea that Smith is attacking is this.  Living in an entangled\ncivilization, we have come to think certain things wrong which are\nnot wrong at all.  We have come to think outbreak and exuberance,\nbanging and barging, rotting and wrecking, wrong.  In themselves they\nare not merely pardonable; they are unimpeachable.  There is nothing\nwicked about firing a pistol off even at a friend, so long as you do not\nmean to hit him and know you won't. It is no more wrong than throwing\na pebble at the sea--less, for you do occasionally hit the sea.\nThere is nothing wrong in bashing down a chimney-pot and breaking\nthrough a roof, so long as you are not injuring the life or property\nof other men.  It is no more wrong to choose to enter a house from\nthe top than to choose to open a packing-case from the bottom.\nThere is nothing wicked about walking round the world and coming back\nto your own house; it is no more wicked than walking round the garden\nand coming back to your own house.  And there is nothing wicked\nabout picking up your wife here, there, and everywhere, if, forsaking\nall others, you keep only to her so long as you both shall live.\nIt is as innocent as playing a game of hide-and-seek in the garden.\nYou associate such acts with blackguardism by a mere snobbish association,\nas you think there is something vaguely vile about going (or being\nseen going) into a pawnbroker's or a public-house. You think there\nis something squalid and commonplace about such a connection.\nYou are mistaken.\n\n\"This man's spiritual power has been precisely this,\nthat he has distinguished between custom and creed.\nHe has broken the conventions, but he has kept the commandments.\nIt is as if a man were found gambling wildly in a gambling hell,\nand you found that he only played for trouser buttons.\nIt is as if you found a man making a clandestine appointment\nwith a lady at a Covent Garden ball, and then you found it\nwas his grandmother.  Everything is ugly and discreditable,\nexcept the facts; everything is wrong about him, except that\nhe has done no wrong.\n\n\"It will then be asked, `Why does Innocent Smith continue far into\nhis middle age a farcical existence, that exposes him to so many\nfalse charges?'  To this I merely answer that he does it because he really\nis happy, because he really is hilarious, because he really is a man\nand alive.  He is so young that climbing garden trees and playing\nsilly practical jokes are still to him what they once were to us all.\nAnd if you ask me yet again why he alone among men should be fed\nwith such inexhaustible follies, I have a very simple answer to that,\nthough it is one that will not be approved.\n\n\"There is but one answer, and I am sorry if you don't like it.\nIf Innocent is happy, it is because he IS innocent.  If he can defy\nthe conventions, it is just because he can keep the commandments.\nIt is just because he does not want to kill but to excite to life\nthat a pistol is still as exciting to him as it is to a schoolboy.\nIt is just because he does not want to steal, because he does not covet\nhis neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all\nlong for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods.  It is just because\nhe does not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex;\nit is just because he loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons.\nIf he had really murdered a man, if he had really deserted a woman,\nhe would not be able to feel that a pistol or a love-letter was like a song--\nat least, not a comic song.\"\n\n\"Do not imagine, please, that any such attitude is easy\nto me or appeals in any particular way to my sympathies.\nI am an Irishman, and a certain sorrow is in my bones, bred either\nof the persecutions of my creed, or of my creed itself.\nSpeaking singly, I feel as if man was tied to tragedy,\nand there was no way out of the trap of old age and doubt.\nBut if there is a way out, then, by Christ and St. Patrick,\nthis is the way out.  If one could keep as happy as a child or a dog,\nit would be by being as innocent as a child, or as sinless as a dog.\nBarely and brutally to be good--that may be the road, and he may have\nfound it.  Well, well, well, I see a look of skepticism on the face\nof my old friend Moses.  Mr. Gould does not believe that being\nperfectly good in all respects would make a man merry.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gould, with an unusual and convincing gravity;\n\"I do not believe that being perfectly good in all respects\nwould make a man merry.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Michael quietly, \"will you tell me one thing?\nWhich of us has ever tried it?\"\n\nA silence ensued, rather like the silence of some long geological\nepoch which awaits the emergence of some unexpected type;\nfor there rose at last in the stillness a massive figure\nthat the other men had almost completely forgotten.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Dr. Warner cheerfully, \"I've been pretty\nwell entertained with all this pointless and incompetent tomfoolery\nfor a couple of days; but it seems to be wearing rather thin,\nand I'm engaged for a city dinner.  Among the hundred flowers\nof futility on both sides I was unable to detect any sort of reason\nwhy a lunatic should be allowed to shoot me in the back garden.\"\n\nHe had settled his silk hat on his head and gone out sailing placidly to\nthe garden gate, while the almost wailing voice of Pym still followed him:\n\"But really the bullet missed you by several feet.\"  And another voice added:\n\"The bullet missed him by several years.\"\n\nThere was a long and mainly unmeaning silence, and then\nMoon said suddenly, \"We have been sitting with a ghost.\nDr. Herbert Warner died years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Chapter V\n\n                   How the Great Wind Went\n                      from Beacon House\n\n\nMary was walking between Diana and Rosamund slowly up and down the garden;\nthey were silent, and the sun had set.  Such spaces of daylight as remained\nopen in the west were of a warm-tinted white, which can be compared\nto nothing but a cream cheese; and the lines of plumy cloud that ran\nacross them had a soft but vivid violet bloom, like a violet smoke.\nAll the rest of the scene swept and faded away into a dove-like gray,\nand seemed to melt and mount into Mary's dark-gray figure until she seemed\nclothed with the garden and the skies.  There was something in these last\nquiet colours that gave her a setting and a supremacy; and the twilight,\nwhich concealed Diana's statelier figure and Rosamund's braver array,\nexhibited and emphasized her, leaving her the lady of the garden, and alone.\n\nWhen they spoke at last it was evident that a conversation long\nfallen silent was being revived.\n\n\"But where is your husband taking you?\" asked Diana in her practical voice.\n\n\"To an aunt,\" said Mary; \"that's just the joke.  There really\nis an aunt, and we left the children with her when I arranged\nto be turned out of the other boarding-house down the road.\nWe never take more than a week of this kind of holiday,\nbut sometimes we take two of them together.\"\n\n\"Does the aunt mind much?\" asked Rosamund innocently.  \"Of course,\nI dare say it's very narrow-minded and--what's that other word?--\nyou know, what Goliath was--but I've known many aunts who would\nthink it--well, silly.\"\n\n\"Silly?\" cried Mary with great heartiness.  \"Oh, my Sunday hat!\nI should think it was silly!  But what do you expect?\nHe really is a good man, and it might have been snakes or something.\"\n\n\"Snakes?\" inquired Rosamund, with a slightly puzzled interest.\n\n\"Uncle Harry kept snakes, and said they loved him,\" replied Mary\nwith perfect simplicity.  \"Auntie let him have them in his pockets,\nbut not in the bedroom.\"\n\n\"And you--\" began Diana, knitting her dark brows a little.\n\n\"Oh, I do as auntie did,\" said Mary; \"as long as we're not away\nfrom the children more than a fortnight together I play the game.\nHe calls me `Manalive;' and you must write it all one word,\nor he's quite flustered.\"\n\n\"But if men want things like that,\" began Diana.\n\n\"Oh, what's the good of talking about men?\" cried Mary impatiently;\n\"why, one might as well be a lady novelist or some horrid thing.\nThere aren't any men.  There are no such people.  There's a man;\nand whoever he is he's quite different.\"\n\n\"So there is no safety,\" said Diana in a low voice.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" answered Mary, lightly enough;\n\"there's only two things generally true of them.\nAt certain curious times they're just fit to take care of us,\nand they're never fit to take care of themselves.\"\n\n\"There is a gale getting up,\" said Rosamund suddenly.\n\"Look at those trees over there, a long way off, and the\nclouds going quicker.\"\n\n\"I know what you're thinking about,\" said Mary; \"and don't\nyou be silly fools.  Don't you listen to the lady novelists.\nYou go down the king's highway; for God's truth, it is God's. Yes,\nmy dear Michael will often be extremely untidy.  Arthur Inglewood\nwill be worse--he'll be untidy.  But what else are all the trees\nand clouds for, you silly kittens?\"\n\n\"The clouds and trees are all waving about,\" said Rosamund.  \"There is\na storm coming, and it makes me feel quite excited, somehow.  Michael is\nreally rather like a storm:  he frightens me and makes me happy.\"\n\n\"Don't you be frightened,\" said Mary.  \"All over, these men\nhave one advantage; they are the sort that go out.\"\n\nA sudden thrust of wind through the trees drifted the dying leaves along\nthe path, and they could hear the far-off trees roaring faintly.\n\n\"I mean,\" said Mary, \"they are the kind that look outwards and get interested\nin the world.  It doesn't matter a bit whether it's arguing, or bicycling,\nor breaking down the ends of the earth as poor old Innocent does.  Stick to\nthe man who looks out of the window and tries to understand the world.\nKeep clear of the man who looks in at the window and tries to understand you.\nWhen poor old Adam had gone out gardening (Arthur will go out gardening),\nthe other sort came along and wormed himself in, nasty old snake.\"\n\n\"You agree with your aunt,\" said Rosamund, smiling:  \"no snakes\nin the bedroom.\"\n\n\"I didn't agree with my aunt very much,\" replied Mary simply,\n\"but I think she was right to let Uncle Harry collect dragons\nand griffins, so long as it got him out of the house.\"\n\nAlmost at the same moment lights sprang up inside the darkened house,\nturning the two glass doors into the garden into gates of beaten gold.\nThe golden gates were burst open, and the enormous Smith, who had\nsat like a clumsy statue for so many hours, came flying and turning\ncart-wheels down the lawn and shouting, \"Acquitted! acquitted!\"\nEchoing the cry, Michael scampered across the lawn to Rosamund and\nwildly swung her into a few steps of what was supposed to be a waltz.\nBut the company knew Innocent and Michael by this time,\nand their extravagances were gaily taken for granted; it was far\nmore extraordinary that Arthur Inglewood walked straight up to Diana\nand kissed her as if it had been his sister's birthday.  Even Dr. Pym,\nthough he refrained from dancing, looked on with real benevolence;\nfor indeed the whole of the absurd revelation had disturbed him\nless than the others; he half supposed that such irresponsible\ntribunals and insane discussions were part of the mediaeval mummeries\nof the Old Land.\n\nWhile the tempest tore the sky as with trumpets, window after window was\nlighted up in the house within; and before the company, broken with laughter\nand the buffeting of the wind, had groped their way to the house again,\nthey saw that the great apish figure of Innocent Smith had clambered\nout of his own attic window, and roaring again and again, \"Beacon House!\"\nwhirled round his head a huge log or trunk from the wood fire below,\nof which the river of crimson flame and purple smoke drove out on\nthe deafening air.\n\nHe was evident enough to have been seen from three counties;\nbut when the wind died down, and the party, at the top of\ntheir evening's merriment, looked again for Mary and for him,\nthey were not to be found.\n\n\n\n                           The End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Manalive, by G.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":251,"split":"train"}
