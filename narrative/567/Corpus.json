The Native Americans burned down houses and opened fire on the British settlers, killing several of them and wounding more. They took many of the survivors captive, including Mary Rowlandson and her three children. Mary and her youngest child are among the injured, while others of her family, including her brother-in-law, are killed. The Native Americans lead the captured survivors from their settlement into the wilderness. Rowlandson and her youngest, Sarah are allowed to stay together, but her two oldest, Joseph and Mary, are separated.\nAfter spending a night in a nearby town, the Native Americans with their captives head further into the wilderness. Being injured, the journey is difficult for Rowlandson and her daughter. They reach an Indian settlement called Wenimesset, where Rowlandson meets another captive named Robert Pepper who tries to help the new captives. After staying in Wenimesset for about a week, Rowlandson\u2019s injured daughter, Sarah, dies. Rowlandson is sold to another Indian who is related to King Philip by marriage. They bury Rowlandson\u2019s dead daughter, and she is allowed to visit her oldest daughter Mary who is also being held in Wenimesset, and her oldest son who is allowed to visit from a nearby Indian settlement. The Indians give Rowlandson a Bible in which she finds a great deal of hope.\nAfter attacking another town the Native Americans decide to head north, and Rowlandson is again separated from her family and \u201cfriends\u201d she has made. The Native Americans, along with Rowlandson, began to move quickly through the forest, as the British army was nearby. They come to the Baquaug River and cross it with the British soldiers close behind. However, the British are not able to cross, and Rowlandson and the Indians continue northwest. They reach the Connecticut River and plan on meeting King Philip, but English scouts are present so they must scatter and hide.\nRowlandson and the Indians soon cross the river and meet King Philip. At this settlement, Rowlandson sews for the Indians in return for food. Rowlandson wants to go to Albany in hopes of being sold for gunpowder, but the Indians take her northward and cross the river again. Rowlandson starts hoping she will be returned home, but now the Indians turn south continuing along the Connecticut River instead of heading east towards civilization. The Indians continue their attacks, and Thomas Read joins Rowlandson\u2019s group. Read tells Rowlandson that her husband is alive and well, which gives her hope and comfort. Rowlandson and her group finally start to move east.\nThey cross the Baquaug River again where they meet messengers telling Rowlandson she must go to Wachuset where the Indians will discuss her possibility of returning to freedom. Rowlandson eagerly heads toward Wachuset, but the journey wears her down and she is disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist from a previous Indian attack. She reaches Wachuset and speaks to King Philip, who guarantees she will be free in two weeks. The council asks how much her husband would pay for her ransom and they send a letter to Boston saying she will be freed for twenty pounds.\nAfter many more Indian attacks and victories, Rowlandson is allowed to travel back to Lancaster, then to Concord and finally to Boston. She is reunited with her husband after 11 long weeks. They stay with a friend in Concord for a while until Rowlandson\u2019s sister, son, and daughter are returned. Now back together, the family builds a house in Boston where they live until 1677.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Captivity and Restoration, by Mrs. Mary Rowlandson\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Especially\nto her dear children and relations. The second Addition [sic] Corrected\nand amended.

See now that I, even I am he, and there is no\ngod with me, I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal, neither is\nthere any can deliver out of my hand.\n\n\nOn the tenth of February 1675, came the Indians with great numbers upon\nLancaster: their first coming was about sunrising; hearing the noise\nof some guns, we looked out; several houses were burning, and the smoke\nascending to heaven. There were five persons taken in one house; the\nfather, and the mother and a sucking child, they knocked on the head;\nthe other two they took and carried away alive. There were two others,\nwho being out of their garrison upon some occasion were set upon;\none was knocked on the head, the other escaped; another there was who\nrunning along was shot and wounded, and fell down; he begged of them his\nlife, promising them money (as they told me) but they would not hearken\nto him but knocked him in head, and stripped him naked, and split open\nhis bowels. Another, seeing many of the Indians about his barn, ventured\nand went out, but was quickly shot down. There were three others\nbelonging to the same garrison who were killed; the Indians getting up\nupon the roof of the barn, had advantage to shoot down upon them over\ntheir fortification. Thus these murderous wretches went on, burning, and\ndestroying before them.\n\nAt length they came and beset our own house, and quickly it was the\ndolefulest day that ever mine eyes saw. The house stood upon the edge of\na hill; some of the Indians got behind the hill, others into the barn,\nand others behind anything that could shelter them; from all which\nplaces they shot against the house, so that the bullets seemed to fly\nlike hail; and quickly they wounded one man among us, then another,\nand then a third. About two hours (according to my observation, in that\namazing time) they had been about the house before they prevailed to\nfire it (which they did with flax and hemp, which they brought out of\nthe barn, and there being no defense about the house, only two flankers\nat two opposite corners and one of them not finished); they fired it\nonce and one ventured out and quenched it, but they quickly fired it\nagain, and that took. Now is the dreadful hour come, that I have often\nheard of (in time of war, as it was the case of others), but now mine\neyes see it. Some in our house were fighting for their lives, others\nwallowing in their blood, the house on fire over our heads, and the\nbloody heathen ready to knock us on the head, if we stirred out. Now\nmight we hear mothers and children crying out for themselves, and one\nanother, \"Lord, what shall we do?\" Then I took my children (and one of\nmy sisters', hers) to go forth and leave the house: but as soon as\nwe came to the door and appeared, the Indians shot so thick that the\nbullets rattled against the house, as if one had taken an handful of\nstones and threw them, so that we were fain to give back. We had six\nstout dogs belonging to our garrison, but none of them would stir,\nthough another time, if any Indian had come to the door, they were ready\nto fly upon him and tear him down. The Lord hereby would make us the\nmore acknowledge His hand, and to see that our help is always in Him.\nBut out we must go, the fire increasing, and coming along behind us,\nroaring, and the Indians gaping before us with their guns, spears,\nand hatchets to devour us. No sooner were we out of the house, but my\nbrother-in-law (being before wounded, in defending the house, in or near\nthe throat) fell down dead, whereat the Indians scornfully shouted, and\nhallowed, and were presently upon him, stripping off his clothes, the\nbullets flying thick, one went through my side, and the same (as would\nseem) through the bowels and hand of my dear child in my arms. One of my\nelder sisters' children, named William, had then his leg broken, which\nthe Indians perceiving, they knocked him on [his] head. Thus were we\nbutchered by those merciless heathen, standing amazed, with the blood\nrunning down to our heels. My eldest sister being yet in the house, and\nseeing those woeful sights, the infidels hauling mothers one way, and\nchildren another, and some wallowing in their blood: and her elder son\ntelling her that her son William was dead, and myself was wounded, she\nsaid, \"And Lord, let me die with them,\" which was no sooner said, but\nshe was struck with a bullet, and fell down dead over the threshold. I\nhope she is reaping the fruit of her good labors, being faithful to the\nservice of God in her place. In her younger years she lay under much\ntrouble upon spiritual accounts, till it pleased God to make that\nprecious scripture take hold of her heart, \"And he said unto me, my\nGrace is sufficient for thee\" (2 Corinthians 12.9). More than twenty\nyears after, I have heard her tell how sweet and comfortable that place\nwas to her. But to return: the Indians laid hold of us, pulling me one\nway, and the children another, and said, \"Come go along with us\"; I told\nthem they would kill me: they answered, if I were willing to go along\nwith them, they would not hurt me.\n\nOh the doleful sight that now was to behold at this house! \"Come, behold\nthe works of the Lord, what desolations he has made in the earth.\" Of\nthirty-seven persons who were in this one house, none escaped either\npresent death, or a bitter captivity, save only one, who might say as\nhe, \"And I only am escaped alone to tell the News\" (Job 1.15). There\nwere twelve killed, some shot, some stabbed with their spears, some\nknocked down with their hatchets. When we are in prosperity, Oh the\nlittle that we think of such dreadful sights, and to see our dear\nfriends, and relations lie bleeding out their heart-blood upon the\nground. There was one who was chopped into the head with a hatchet, and\nstripped naked, and yet was crawling up and down. It is a solemn sight\nto see so many Christians lying in their blood, some here, and some\nthere, like a company of sheep torn by wolves, all of them stripped\nnaked by a company of hell-hounds, roaring, singing, ranting, and\ninsulting, as if they would have torn our very hearts out; yet the Lord\nby His almighty power preserved a number of us from death, for there\nwere twenty-four of us taken alive and carried captive.\n\nI had often before this said that if the Indians should come, I should\nchoose rather to be killed by them than taken alive, but when it came\nto the trial my mind changed; their glittering weapons so daunted\nmy spirit, that I chose rather to go along with those (as I may say)\nravenous beasts, than that moment to end my days; and that I may the\nbetter declare what happened to me during that grievous captivity, I\nshall particularly speak of the several removes we had up and down the\nwilderness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST REMOVE\n\nNow away we must go with those barbarous creatures, with our bodies\nwounded and bleeding, and our hearts no less than our bodies. About a\nmile we went that night, up upon a hill within sight of the town, where\nthey intended to lodge. There was hard by a vacant house (deserted by\nthe English before, for fear of the Indians). I asked them whether I\nmight not lodge in the house that night, to which they answered, \"What,\nwill you love English men still?\" This was the dolefulest night that\never my eyes saw. Oh the roaring, and singing and dancing, and yelling\nof those black creatures in the night, which made the place a lively\nresemblance of hell. And as miserable was the waste that was there made\nof horses, cattle, sheep, swine, calves, lambs, roasting pigs, and fowl\n(which they had plundered in the town), some roasting, some lying and\nburning, and some boiling to feed our merciless enemies; who were joyful\nenough, though we were disconsolate. To add to the dolefulness of the\nformer day, and the dismalness of the present night, my thoughts ran\nupon my losses and sad bereaved condition. All was gone, my husband\ngone (at least separated from me, he being in the Bay; and to add to my\ngrief, the Indians told me they would kill him as he came homeward), my\nchildren gone, my relations and friends gone, our house and home and all\nour comforts--within door and without--all was gone (except my life),\nand I knew not but the next moment that might go too. There remained\nnothing to me but one poor wounded babe, and it seemed at present\nworse than death that it was in such a pitiful condition, bespeaking\ncompassion, and I had no refreshing for it, nor suitable things to\nrevive it. Little do many think what is the savageness and brutishness\nof this barbarous enemy, Ay, even those that seem to profess more than\nothers among them, when the English have fallen into their hands.\n\nThose seven that were killed at Lancaster the summer before upon a\nSabbath day, and the one that was afterward killed upon a weekday,\nwere slain and mangled in a barbarous manner, by one-eyed John, and\nMarlborough's Praying Indians, which Capt. Mosely brought to Boston, as\nthe Indians told me.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND REMOVE\n\nBut now, the next morning, I must turn my back upon the town, and travel\nwith them into the vast and desolate wilderness, I knew not whither.\nIt is not my tongue, or pen, can express the sorrows of my heart, and\nbitterness of my spirit that I had at this departure: but God was with\nme in a wonderful manner, carrying me along, and bearing up my spirit,\nthat it did not quite fail. One of the Indians carried my poor wounded\nbabe upon a horse; it went moaning all along, \"I shall die, I shall\ndie.\" I went on foot after it, with sorrow that cannot be expressed.\nAt length I took it off the horse, and carried it in my arms till my\nstrength failed, and I fell down with it. Then they set me upon a horse\nwith my wounded child in my lap, and there being no furniture upon the\nhorse's back, as we were going down a steep hill we both fell over\nthe horse's head, at which they, like inhumane creatures, laughed, and\nrejoiced to see it, though I thought we should there have ended our\ndays, as overcome with so many difficulties. But the Lord renewed my\nstrength still, and carried me along, that I might see more of His\npower; yea, so much that I could never have thought of, had I not\nexperienced it.\n\nAfter this it quickly began to snow, and when night came on, they\nstopped, and now down I must sit in the snow, by a little fire, and a\nfew boughs behind me, with my sick child in my lap; and calling much for\nwater, being now (through the wound) fallen into a violent fever. My own\nwound also growing so stiff that I could scarce sit down or rise up; yet\nso it must be, that I must sit all this cold winter night upon the cold\nsnowy ground, with my sick child in my arms, looking that every hour\nwould be the last of its life; and having no Christian friend near me,\neither to comfort or help me. Oh, I may see the wonderful power of God,\nthat my Spirit did not utterly sink under my affliction: still the Lord\nupheld me with His gracious and merciful spirit, and we were both alive\nto see the light of the next morning.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD REMOVE\n\nThe morning being come, they prepared to go on their way. One of the\nIndians got up upon a horse, and they set me up behind him, with my poor\nsick babe in my lap. A very wearisome and tedious day I had of it; what\nwith my own wound, and my child's being so exceeding sick, and in a\nlamentable condition with her wound. It may be easily judged what a\npoor feeble condition we were in, there being not the least crumb of\nrefreshing that came within either of our mouths from Wednesday night\nto Saturday night, except only a little cold water. This day in the\nafternoon, about an hour by sun, we came to the place where they\nintended, viz. an Indian town, called Wenimesset, northward of Quabaug.\nWhen we were come, Oh the number of pagans (now merciless enemies) that\nthere came about me, that I may say as David, \"I had fainted, unless I\nhad believed, etc\" (Psalm 27.13). The next day was the Sabbath. I then\nremembered how careless I had been of God's holy time; how many Sabbaths\nI had lost and misspent, and how evilly I had walked in God's sight;\nwhich lay so close unto my spirit, that it was easy for me to see how\nrighteous it was with God to cut off the thread of my life and cast me\nout of His presence forever. Yet the Lord still showed mercy to me, and\nupheld me; and as He wounded me with one hand, so he healed me with the\nother. This day there came to me one Robert Pepper (a man belonging\nto Roxbury) who was taken in Captain Beers's fight, and had been now a\nconsiderable time with the Indians; and up with them almost as far as\nAlbany, to see King Philip, as he told me, and was now very lately come\ninto these parts. Hearing, I say, that I was in this Indian town, he\nobtained leave to come and see me. He told me he himself was wounded in\nthe leg at Captain Beer's fight; and was not able some time to go, but\nas they carried him, and as he took oaken leaves and laid to his wound,\nand through the blessing of God he was able to travel again. Then I took\noaken leaves and laid to my side, and with the blessing of God it cured\nme also; yet before the cure was wrought, I may say, as it is in Psalm\n38.5-6 \"My wounds stink and are corrupt, I am troubled, I am bowed down\ngreatly, I go mourning all the day long.\" I sat much alone with a poor\nwounded child in my lap, which moaned night and day, having nothing\nto revive the body, or cheer the spirits of her, but instead of that,\nsometimes one Indian would come and tell me one hour that \"your master\nwill knock your child in the head,\" and then a second, and then a third,\n\"your master will quickly knock your child in the head.\"\n\nThis was the comfort I had from them, miserable comforters are ye all,\nas he said. Thus nine days I sat upon my knees, with my babe in my lap,\ntill my flesh was raw again; my child being even ready to depart this\nsorrowful world, they bade me carry it out to another wigwam (I suppose\nbecause they would not be troubled with such spectacles) whither I went\nwith a very heavy heart, and down I sat with the picture of death in my\nlap. About two hours in the night, my sweet babe like a lamb departed\nthis life on Feb. 18, 1675. It being about six years, and five months\nold. It was nine days from the first wounding, in this miserable\ncondition, without any refreshing of one nature or other, except a\nlittle cold water. I cannot but take notice how at another time I could\nnot bear to be in the room where any dead person was, but now the case\nis changed; I must and could lie down by my dead babe, side by side all\nthe night after. I have thought since of the wonderful goodness of\nGod to me in preserving me in the use of my reason and senses in that\ndistressed time, that I did not use wicked and violent means to end my\nown miserable life. In the morning, when they understood that my child\nwas dead they sent for me home to my master's wigwam (by my master in\nthis writing, must be understood Quinnapin, who was a Sagamore, and\nmarried King Philip's wife's sister; not that he first took me, but I\nwas sold to him by another Narragansett Indian, who took me when first I\ncame out of the garrison). I went to take up my dead child in my arms to\ncarry it with me, but they bid me let it alone; there was no resisting,\nbut go I must and leave it. When I had been at my master's wigwam, I\ntook the first opportunity I could get to go look after my dead child.\nWhen I came I asked them what they had done with it; then they told me\nit was upon the hill. Then they went and showed me where it was, where I\nsaw the ground was newly digged, and there they told me they had buried\nit. There I left that child in the wilderness, and must commit it, and\nmyself also in this wilderness condition, to Him who is above all. God\nhaving taken away this dear child, I went to see my daughter Mary, who\nwas at this same Indian town, at a wigwam not very far off, though we\nhad little liberty or opportunity to see one another. She was about\nten years old, and taken from the door at first by a Praying Ind. and\nafterward sold for a gun. When I came in sight, she would fall aweeping;\nat which they were provoked, and would not let me come near her, but\nbade me be gone; which was a heart-cutting word to me. I had one child\ndead, another in the wilderness, I knew not where, the third they\nwould not let me come near to: \"Me (as he said) have ye bereaved of my\nChildren, Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\nalso, all these things are against me.\" I could not sit still in this\ncondition, but kept walking from one place to another. And as I was\ngoing along, my heart was even overwhelmed with the thoughts of my\ncondition, and that I should have children, and a nation which I knew\nnot, ruled over them. Whereupon I earnestly entreated the Lord, that He\nwould consider my low estate, and show me a token for good, and if it\nwere His blessed will, some sign and hope of some relief. And indeed\nquickly the Lord answered, in some measure, my poor prayers; for as I\nwas going up and down mourning and lamenting my condition, my son came\nto me, and asked me how I did. I had not seen him before, since the\ndestruction of the town, and I knew not where he was, till I was\ninformed by himself, that he was amongst a smaller parcel of Indians,\nwhose place was about six miles off. With tears in his eyes, he asked\nme whether his sister Sarah was dead; and told me he had seen his\nsister Mary; and prayed me, that I would not be troubled in reference\nto himself. The occasion of his coming to see me at this time, was this:\nthere was, as I said, about six miles from us, a small plantation of\nIndians, where it seems he had been during his captivity; and at this\ntime, there were some forces of the Ind. gathered out of our company,\nand some also from them (among whom was my son's master) to go to\nassault and burn Medfield. In this time of the absence of his master,\nhis dame brought him to see me. I took this to be some gracious answer\nto my earnest and unfeigned desire. The next day, viz. to this, the\nIndians returned from Medfield, all the company, for those that belonged\nto the other small company, came through the town that now we were at.\nBut before they came to us, Oh! the outrageous roaring and hooping that\nthere was. They began their din about a mile before they came to us.\nBy their noise and hooping they signified how many they had destroyed\n(which was at that time twenty-three). Those that were with us at home\nwere gathered together as soon as they heard the hooping, and every time\nthat the other went over their number, these at home gave a shout, that\nthe very earth rung again. And thus they continued till those that had\nbeen upon the expedition were come up to the Sagamore's wigwam; and\nthen, Oh, the hideous insulting and triumphing that there was over some\nEnglishmen's scalps that they had taken (as their manner is) and brought\nwith them. I cannot but take notice of the wonderful mercy of God to\nme in those afflictions, in sending me a Bible. One of the Indians that\ncame from Medfield fight, had brought some plunder, came to me, and\nasked me, if I would have a Bible, he had got one in his basket. I was\nglad of it, and asked him, whether he thought the Indians would let\nme read? He answered, yes. So I took the Bible, and in that melancholy\ntime, it came into my mind to read first the 28th chapter of\nDeuteronomy, which I did, and when I had read it, my dark heart wrought\non this manner: that there was no mercy for me, that the blessings\nwere gone, and the curses come in their room, and that I had lost my\nopportunity. But the Lord helped me still to go on reading till I came\nto Chap. 30, the seven first verses, where I found, there was mercy\npromised again, if we would return to Him by repentance; and though\nwe were scattered from one end of the earth to the other, yet the Lord\nwould gather us together, and turn all those curses upon our enemies. I\ndo not desire to live to forget this Scripture, and what comfort it was\nto me.\n\nNow the Ind. began to talk of removing from this place, some one way,\nand some another. There were now besides myself nine English captives\nin this place (all of them children, except one woman). I got an\nopportunity to go and take my leave of them. They being to go one way,\nand I another, I asked them whether they were earnest with God for\ndeliverance. They told me they did as they were able, and it was some\ncomfort to me, that the Lord stirred up children to look to Him. The\nwoman, viz. goodwife Joslin, told me she should never see me again, and\nthat she could find in her heart to run away. I wished her not to run\naway by any means, for we were near thirty miles from any English town,\nand she very big with child, and had but one week to reckon, and another\nchild in her arms, two years old, and bad rivers there were to go over,\nand we were feeble, with our poor and coarse entertainment. I had my\nBible with me, I pulled it out, and asked her whether she would read. We\nopened the Bible and lighted on Psalm 27, in which Psalm we especially\ntook notice of that, ver. ult., \"Wait on the Lord, Be of good courage,\nand he shall strengthen thine Heart, wait I say on the Lord.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH REMOVE\n\nAnd now I must part with that little company I had. Here I parted from\nmy daughter Mary (whom I never saw again till I saw her in Dorchester,\nreturned from captivity), and from four little cousins and neighbors,\nsome of which I never saw afterward: the Lord only knows the end of\nthem. Amongst them also was that poor woman before mentioned, who came\nto a sad end, as some of the company told me in my travel: she having\nmuch grief upon her spirit about her miserable condition, being so near\nher time, she would be often asking the Indians to let her go home; they\nnot being willing to that, and yet vexed with her importunity, gathered\na great company together about her and stripped her naked, and set her\nin the midst of them, and when they had sung and danced about her (in\ntheir hellish manner) as long as they pleased they knocked her on head,\nand the child in her arms with her. When they had done that they made\na fire and put them both into it, and told the other children that were\nwith them that if they attempted to go home, they would serve them in\nlike manner. The children said she did not shed one tear, but prayed all\nthe while. But to return to my own journey, we traveled about half a day\nor little more, and came to a desolate place in the wilderness, where\nthere were no wigwams or inhabitants before; we came about the middle\nof the afternoon to this place, cold and wet, and snowy, and hungry, and\nweary, and no refreshing for man but the cold ground to sit on, and our\npoor Indian cheer.\n\nHeart-aching thoughts here I had about my poor children, who were\nscattered up and down among the wild beasts of the forest. My head was\nlight and dizzy (either through hunger or hard lodging, or trouble or\nall together), my knees feeble, my body raw by sitting double night\nand day, that I cannot express to man the affliction that lay upon my\nspirit, but the Lord helped me at that time to express it to Himself. I\nopened my Bible to read, and the Lord brought that precious Scripture to\nme. \"Thus saith the Lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes\nfrom tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, and they shall come again\nfrom the land of the enemy\" (Jeremiah 31.16). This was a sweet cordial\nto me when I was ready to faint; many and many a time have I sat down\nand wept sweetly over this Scripture. At this place we continued about\nfour days.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH REMOVE\n\nThe occasion (as I thought) of their moving at this time was the English\narmy, it being near and following them. For they went as if they had\ngone for their lives, for some considerable way, and then they made a\nstop, and chose some of their stoutest men, and sent them back to hold\nthe English army in play whilst the rest escaped. And then, like Jehu,\nthey marched on furiously, with their old and with their young: some\ncarried their old decrepit mothers, some carried one, and some another.\nFour of them carried a great Indian upon a bier; but going through\na thick wood with him, they were hindered, and could make no haste,\nwhereupon they took him upon their backs, and carried him, one at a\ntime, till they came to Banquaug river. Upon a Friday, a little after\nnoon, we came to this river. When all the company was come up, and were\ngathered together, I thought to count the number of them, but they were\nso many, and being somewhat in motion, it was beyond my skill. In\nthis travel, because of my wound, I was somewhat favored in my load; I\ncarried only my knitting work and two quarts of parched meal. Being very\nfaint I asked my mistress to give me one spoonful of the meal, but she\nwould not give me a taste. They quickly fell to cutting dry trees, to\nmake rafts to carry them over the river: and soon my turn came to go\nover. By the advantage of some brush which they had laid upon the raft\nto sit upon, I did not wet my foot (which many of themselves at the\nother end were mid-leg deep) which cannot but be acknowledged as a favor\nof God to my weakened body, it being a very cold time. I was not before\nacquainted with such kind of doings or dangers. \"When thou passeth\nthrough the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they\nshall not overflow thee\" (Isaiah 43.2). A certain number of us got over\nthe river that night, but it was the night after the Sabbath before all\nthe company was got over. On the Saturday they boiled an old horse's\nleg which they had got, and so we drank of the broth, as soon as they\nthought it was ready, and when it was almost all gone, they filled it up\nagain.\n\nThe first week of my being among them I hardly ate any thing; the second\nweek I found my stomach grow very faint for want of something; and yet\nit was very hard to get down their filthy trash; but the third week,\nthough I could think how formerly my stomach would turn against this\nor that, and I could starve and die before I could eat such things, yet\nthey were sweet and savory to my taste. I was at this time knitting a\npair of white cotton stockings for my mistress; and had not yet wrought\nupon a Sabbath day. When the Sabbath came they bade me go to work. I\ntold them it was the Sabbath day, and desired them to let me rest, and\ntold them I would do as much more tomorrow; to which they answered\nme they would break my face. And here I cannot but take notice of the\nstrange providence of God in preserving the heathen. They were many\nhundreds, old and young, some sick, and some lame; many had papooses at\ntheir backs. The greatest number at this time with us were squaws, and\nthey traveled with all they had, bag and baggage, and yet they got over\nthis river aforesaid; and on Monday they set their wigwams on fire, and\naway they went. On that very day came the English army after them to\nthis river, and saw the smoke of their wigwams, and yet this river put a\nstop to them. God did not give them courage or activity to go over after\nus. We were not ready for so great a mercy as victory and deliverance.\nIf we had been God would have found out a way for the English to have\npassed this river, as well as for the Indians with their squaws and\nchildren, and all their luggage. \"Oh that my people had hearkened to\nme, and Israel had walked in my ways, I should soon have subdued their\nenemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries\" (Psalm 81.13-14).\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH REMOVE\n\nOn Monday (as I said) they set their wigwams on fire and went away. It\nwas a cold morning, and before us there was a great brook with ice on\nit; some waded through it, up to the knees and higher, but others went\ntill they came to a beaver dam, and I amongst them, where through the\ngood providence of God, I did not wet my foot. I went along that day\nmourning and lamenting, leaving farther my own country, and traveling\ninto a vast and howling wilderness, and I understood something of Lot's\nwife's temptation, when she looked back. We came that day to a great\nswamp, by the side of which we took up our lodging that night. When I\ncame to the brow of the hill, that looked toward the swamp, I thought we\nhad been come to a great Indian town (though there were none but our own\ncompany). The Indians were as thick as the trees: it seemed as if there\nhad been a thousand hatchets going at once. If one looked before one\nthere was nothing but Indians, and behind one, nothing but Indians, and\nso on either hand, I myself in the midst, and no Christian soul near me,\nand yet how hath the Lord preserved me in safety? Oh the experience that\nI have had of the goodness of God, to me and mine!\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH REMOVE\n\nAfter a restless and hungry night there, we had a wearisome time of it\nthe next day. The swamp by which we lay was, as it were, a deep dungeon,\nand an exceeding high and steep hill before it. Before I got to the top\nof the hill, I thought my heart and legs, and all would have broken,\nand failed me. What, through faintness and soreness of body, it was\na grievous day of travel to me. As we went along, I saw a place where\nEnglish cattle had been. That was comfort to me, such as it was. Quickly\nafter that we came to an English path, which so took with me, that I\nthought I could have freely lyen down and died. That day, a little after\nnoon, we came to Squakeag, where the Indians quickly spread themselves\nover the deserted English fields, gleaning what they could find. Some\npicked up ears of wheat that were crickled down; some found ears of\nIndian corn; some found ground nuts, and others sheaves of wheat that\nwere frozen together in the shock, and went to threshing of them out.\nMyself got two ears of Indian corn, and whilst I did but turn my back,\none of them was stolen from me, which much troubled me. There came an\nIndian to them at that time with a basket of horse liver. I asked him to\ngive me a piece. \"What,\" says he, \"can you eat horse liver?\" I told him,\nI would try, if he would give a piece, which he did, and I laid it on\nthe coals to roast. But before it was half ready they got half of it\naway from me, so that I was fain to take the rest and eat it as it was,\nwith the blood about my mouth, and yet a savory bit it was to me:\n\"For to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.\" A solemn sight\nmethought it was, to see fields of wheat and Indian corn forsaken and\nspoiled and the remainders of them to be food for our merciless enemies.\nThat night we had a mess of wheat for our supper.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EIGHTH REMOVE\n\nOn the morrow morning we must go over the river, i.e. Connecticut, to\nmeet with King Philip. Two canoes full they had carried over; the next\nturn I myself was to go. But as my foot was upon the canoe to step in\nthere was a sudden outcry among them, and I must step back, and instead\nof going over the river, I must go four or five miles up the river\nfarther northward. Some of the Indians ran one way, and some another.\nThe cause of this rout was, as I thought, their espying some English\nscouts, who were thereabout. In this travel up the river about noon the\ncompany made a stop, and sat down; some to eat, and others to rest them.\nAs I sat amongst them, musing of things past, my son Joseph unexpectedly\ncame to me. We asked of each other's welfare, bemoaning our doleful\ncondition, and the change that had come upon us. We had husband and\nfather, and children, and sisters, and friends, and relations, and\nhouse, and home, and many comforts of this life: but now we may say, as\nJob, \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return:\nthe Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the\nLord.\" I asked him whether he would read. He told me he earnestly\ndesired it, I gave him my Bible, and he lighted upon that comfortable\nScripture \"I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord:\nthe Lord hath chastened me sore yet he hath not given me over to death\"\n(Psalm 118.17-18). \"Look here, mother,\" says he, \"did you read this?\"\nAnd here I may take occasion to mention one principal ground of my\nsetting forth these lines: even as the psalmist says, to declare\nthe works of the Lord, and His wonderful power in carrying us along,\npreserving us in the wilderness, while under the enemy's hand, and\nreturning of us in safety again. And His goodness in bringing to my\nhand so many comfortable and suitable scriptures in my distress. But to\nreturn, we traveled on till night; and in the morning, we must go over\nthe river to Philip's crew. When I was in the canoe I could not but be\namazed at the numerous crew of pagans that were on the bank on the other\nside. When I came ashore, they gathered all about me, I sitting alone in\nthe midst. I observed they asked one another questions, and laughed, and\nrejoiced over their gains and victories. Then my heart began to fail:\nand I fell aweeping, which was the first time to my remembrance, that\nI wept before them. Although I had met with so much affliction, and my\nheart was many times ready to break, yet could I not shed one tear in\ntheir sight; but rather had been all this while in a maze, and like one\nastonished. But now I may say as Psalm 137.1, \"By the Rivers of Babylon,\nthere we sate down: yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.\" There one\nof them asked me why I wept. I could hardly tell what to say: Yet I\nanswered, they would kill me. \"No,\" said he, \"none will hurt you.\" Then\ncame one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me, and\nanother gave me half a pint of peas; which was more worth than many\nbushels at another time. Then I went to see King Philip. He bade me\ncome in and sit down, and asked me whether I would smoke it (a usual\ncompliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners) but this no way suited\nme. For though I had formerly used tobacco, yet I had left it ever since\nI was first taken. It seems to be a bait the devil lays to make men\nlose their precious time. I remember with shame how formerly, when I\nhad taken two or three pipes, I was presently ready for another, such a\nbewitching thing it is. But I thank God, He has now given me power over\nit; surely there are many who may be better employed than to lie sucking\na stinking tobacco-pipe.\n\nNow the Indians gather their forces to go against Northampton. Over\nnight one went about yelling and hooting to give notice of the design.\nWhereupon they fell to boiling of ground nuts, and parching of corn (as\nmany as had it) for their provision; and in the morning away they went.\nDuring my abode in this place, Philip spake to me to make a shirt for\nhis boy, which I did, for which he gave me a shilling. I offered the\nmoney to my master, but he bade me keep it; and with it I bought a piece\nof horse flesh. Afterwards he asked me to make a cap for his boy, for\nwhich he invited me to dinner. I went, and he gave me a pancake, about\nas big as two fingers. It was made of parched wheat, beaten, and fried\nin bear's grease, but I thought I never tasted pleasanter meat in my\nlife. There was a squaw who spake to me to make a shirt for her sannup,\nfor which she gave me a piece of bear. Another asked me to knit a pair\nof stockings, for which she gave me a quart of peas. I boiled my peas\nand bear together, and invited my master and mistress to dinner; but the\nproud gossip, because I served them both in one dish, would eat nothing,\nexcept one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife. Hearing\nthat my son was come to this place, I went to see him, and found him\nlying flat upon the ground. I asked him how he could sleep so? He\nanswered me that he was not asleep, but at prayer; and lay so, that they\nmight not observe what he was doing. I pray God he may remember these\nthings now he is returned in safety. At this place (the sun now getting\nhigher) what with the beams and heat of the sun, and the smoke of the\nwigwams, I thought I should have been blind. I could scarce discern one\nwigwam from another. There was here one Mary Thurston of Medfield, who\nseeing how it was with me, lent me a hat to wear; but as soon as I was\ngone, the squaw (who owned that Mary Thurston) came running after me,\nand got it away again. Here was the squaw that gave me one spoonful\nof meal. I put it in my pocket to keep it safe. Yet notwithstanding,\nsomebody stole it, but put five Indian corns in the room of it; which\ncorns were the greatest provisions I had in my travel for one day.\n\nThe Indians returning from Northampton, brought with them some horses,\nand sheep, and other things which they had taken; I desired them that\nthey would carry me to Albany upon one of those horses, and sell me for\npowder: for so they had sometimes discoursed. I was utterly hopeless of\ngetting home on foot, the way that I came. I could hardly bear to think\nof the many weary steps I had taken, to come to this place.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NINTH REMOVE\n\nBut instead of going either to Albany or homeward, we must go five miles\nup the river, and then go over it. Here we abode a while. Here lived a\nsorry Indian, who spoke to me to make him a shirt. When I had done it,\nhe would pay me nothing. But he living by the riverside, where I often\nwent to fetch water, I would often be putting of him in mind, and\ncalling for my pay: At last he told me if I would make another shirt,\nfor a papoose not yet born, he would give me a knife, which he did when\nI had done it. I carried the knife in, and my master asked me to give\nit him, and I was not a little glad that I had anything that they would\naccept of, and be pleased with. When we were at this place, my master's\nmaid came home; she had been gone three weeks into the Narragansett\ncountry to fetch corn, where they had stored up some in the ground. She\nbrought home about a peck and half of corn. This was about the time that\ntheir great captain, Naananto, was killed in the Narragansett country.\nMy son being now about a mile from me, I asked liberty to go and\nsee him; they bade me go, and away I went; but quickly lost myself,\ntraveling over hills and through swamps, and could not find the way to\nhim. And I cannot but admire at the wonderful power and goodness of God\nto me, in that, though I was gone from home, and met with all sorts of\nIndians, and those I had no knowledge of, and there being no Christian\nsoul near me; yet not one of them offered the least imaginable\nmiscarriage to me. I turned homeward again, and met with my master. He\nshowed me the way to my son. When I came to him I found him not well:\nand withall he had a boil on his side, which much troubled him. We\nbemoaned one another a while, as the Lord helped us, and then I returned\nagain. When I was returned, I found myself as unsatisfied as I was\nbefore. I went up and down mourning and lamenting; and my spirit was\nready to sink with the thoughts of my poor children. My son was ill, and\nI could not but think of his mournful looks, and no Christian friend was\nnear him, to do any office of love for him, either for soul or body.\nAnd my poor girl, I knew not where she was, nor whether she was sick, or\nwell, or alive, or dead. I repaired under these thoughts to my Bible (my\ngreat comfort in that time) and that Scripture came to my hand, \"Cast\nthy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee\" (Psalm 55.22).\n\nBut I was fain to go and look after something to satisfy my hunger, and\ngoing among the wigwams, I went into one and there found a squaw who\nshowed herself very kind to me, and gave me a piece of bear. I put it\ninto my pocket, and came home, but could not find an opportunity to\nbroil it, for fear they would get it from me, and there it lay all that\nday and night in my stinking pocket. In the morning I went to the same\nsquaw, who had a kettle of ground nuts boiling. I asked her to let me\nboil my piece of bear in her kettle, which she did, and gave me some\nground nuts to eat with it: and I cannot but think how pleasant it\nwas to me. I have sometime seen bear baked very handsomely among the\nEnglish, and some like it, but the thought that it was bear made me\ntremble. But now that was savory to me that one would think was enough\nto turn the stomach of a brute creature.\n\nOne bitter cold day I could find no room to sit down before the fire.\nI went out, and could not tell what to do, but I went in to another\nwigwam, where they were also sitting round the fire, but the squaw laid\na skin for me, and bid me sit down, and gave me some ground nuts, and\nbade me come again; and told me they would buy me, if they were able,\nand yet these were strangers to me that I never saw before.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TENTH REMOVE\n\nThat day a small part of the company removed about three-quarters of a\nmile, intending further the next day. When they came to the place where\nthey intended to lodge, and had pitched their wigwams, being hungry, I\nwent again back to the place we were before at, to get something to eat,\nbeing encouraged by the squaw's kindness, who bade me come again. When I\nwas there, there came an Indian to look after me, who when he had found\nme, kicked me all along. I went home and found venison roasting that\nnight, but they would not give me one bit of it. Sometimes I met with\nfavor, and sometimes with nothing but frowns.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ELEVENTH REMOVE\n\nThe next day in the morning they took their travel, intending a day's\njourney up the river. I took my load at my back, and quickly we came to\nwade over the river; and passed over tiresome and wearisome hills. One\nhill was so steep that I was fain to creep up upon my knees, and to hold\nby the twigs and bushes to keep myself from falling backward. My head\nalso was so light that I usually reeled as I went; but I hope all these\nwearisome steps that I have taken, are but a forewarning to me of the\nheavenly rest: \"I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that\nthou in faithfulness hast afflicted me\" (Psalm 119.75).\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWELFTH REMOVE\n\nIt was upon a Sabbath-day-morning, that they prepared for their travel.\nThis morning I asked my master whether he would sell me to my husband.\nHe answered me \"Nux,\" which did much rejoice my spirit. My mistress,\nbefore we went, was gone to the burial of a papoose, and returning, she\nfound me sitting and reading in my Bible; she snatched it hastily out of\nmy hand, and threw it out of doors. I ran out and catched it up, and put\nit into my pocket, and never let her see it afterward. Then they packed\nup their things to be gone, and gave me my load. I complained it was\ntoo heavy, whereupon she gave me a slap in the face, and bade me go; I\nlifted up my heart to God, hoping the redemption was not far off; and\nthe rather because their insolency grew worse and worse.\n\nBut the thoughts of my going homeward (for so we bent our course) much\ncheered my spirit, and made my burden seem light, and almost nothing\nat all. But (to my amazement and great perplexity) the scale was soon\nturned; for when we had gone a little way, on a sudden my mistress gives\nout; she would go no further, but turn back again, and said I must go\nback again with her, and she called her sannup, and would have had him\ngone back also, but he would not, but said he would go on, and come\nto us again in three days. My spirit was, upon this, I confess, very\nimpatient, and almost outrageous. I thought I could as well have died as\nwent back; I cannot declare the trouble that I was in about it; but yet\nback again I must go. As soon as I had the opportunity, I took my Bible\nto read, and that quieting Scripture came to my hand, \"Be still, and\nknow that I am God\" (Psalm 46.10). Which stilled my spirit for the\npresent. But a sore time of trial, I concluded, I had to go through,\nmy master being gone, who seemed to me the best friend that I had of an\nIndian, both in cold and hunger, and quickly so it proved. Down I sat,\nwith my heart as full as it could hold, and yet so hungry that I could\nnot sit neither; but going out to see what I could find, and walking\namong the trees, I found six acorns, and two chestnuts, which were\nsome refreshment to me. Towards night I gathered some sticks for my own\ncomfort, that I might not lie a-cold; but when we came to lie down they\nbade me to go out, and lie somewhere else, for they had company (they\nsaid) come in more than their own. I told them, I could not tell where\nto go, they bade me go look; I told them, if I went to another wigwam\nthey would be angry, and send me home again. Then one of the company\ndrew his sword, and told me he would run me through if I did not go\npresently. Then was I fain to stoop to this rude fellow, and to go\nout in the night, I knew not whither. Mine eyes have seen that fellow\nafterwards walking up and down Boston, under the appearance of a Friend\nIndian, and several others of the like cut. I went to one wigwam, and\nthey told me they had no room. Then I went to another, and they said the\nsame; at last an old Indian bade me to come to him, and his squaw gave\nme some ground nuts; she gave me also something to lay under my head,\nand a good fire we had; and through the good providence of God, I had a\ncomfortable lodging that night. In the morning, another Indian bade me\ncome at night, and he would give me six ground nuts, which I did. We\nwere at this place and time about two miles from [the] Connecticut\nriver. We went in the morning to gather ground nuts, to the river, and\nwent back again that night. I went with a good load at my back (for they\nwhen they went, though but a little way, would carry all their trumpery\nwith them). I told them the skin was off my back, but I had no other\ncomforting answer from them than this: that it would be no matter if my\nhead were off too.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRTEENTH REMOVE\n\nInstead of going toward the Bay, which was that I desired, I must go\nwith them five or six miles down the river into a mighty thicket of\nbrush; where we abode almost a fortnight. Here one asked me to make a\nshirt for her papoose, for which she gave me a mess of broth, which\nwas thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree, and to make it the\nbetter, she had put into it about a handful of peas, and a few roasted\nground nuts. I had not seen my son a pretty while, and here was an\nIndian of whom I made inquiry after him, and asked him when he saw him.\nHe answered me that such a time his master roasted him, and that himself\ndid eat a piece of him, as big as his two fingers, and that he was very\ngood meat. But the Lord upheld my Spirit, under this discouragement; and\nI considered their horrible addictedness to lying, and that there is\nnot one of them that makes the least conscience of speaking of truth.\nIn this place, on a cold night, as I lay by the fire, I removed a stick\nthat kept the heat from me. A squaw moved it down again, at which I\nlooked up, and she threw a handful of ashes in mine eyes. I thought\nI should have been quite blinded, and have never seen more, but lying\ndown, the water run out of my eyes, and carried the dirt with it, that\nby the morning I recovered my sight again. Yet upon this, and the like\noccasions, I hope it is not too much to say with Job, \"Have pity upon\nme, O ye my Friends, for the Hand of the Lord has touched me.\" And\nhere I cannot but remember how many times sitting in their wigwams, and\nmusing on things past, I should suddenly leap up and run out, as if I\nhad been at home, forgetting where I was, and what my condition was;\nbut when I was without, and saw nothing but wilderness, and woods, and\na company of barbarous heathens, my mind quickly returned to me, which\nmade me think of that, spoken concerning Sampson, who said, \"I will go\nout and shake myself as at other times, but he wist not that the Lord\nwas departed from him.\" About this time I began to think that all my\nhopes of restoration would come to nothing. I thought of the English\narmy, and hoped for their coming, and being taken by them, but that\nfailed. I hoped to be carried to Albany, as the Indians had discoursed\nbefore, but that failed also. I thought of being sold to my husband, as\nmy master spake, but instead of that, my master himself was gone, and I\nleft behind, so that my spirit was now quite ready to sink. I asked them\nto let me go out and pick up some sticks, that I might get alone, and\npour out my heart unto the Lord. Then also I took my Bible to read, but\nI found no comfort here neither, which many times I was wont to find. So\neasy a thing it is with God to dry up the streams of Scripture comfort\nfrom us. Yet I can say, that in all my sorrows and afflictions, God did\nnot leave me to have my impatience work towards Himself, as if His ways\nwere unrighteous. But I knew that He laid upon me less than I deserved.\nAfterward, before this doleful time ended with me, I was turning the\nleaves of my Bible, and the Lord brought to me some Scriptures, which\ndid a little revive me, as that [in] Isaiah 55.8: \"For my thoughts are\nnot your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.\" And\nalso that [in] Psalm 37.5: \"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in\nhim; and he shall bring it to pass.\" About this time they came yelping\nfrom Hadley, where they had killed three Englishmen, and brought one\ncaptive with them, viz. Thomas Read. They all gathered about the poor\nman, asking him many questions. I desired also to go and see him; and\nwhen I came, he was crying bitterly, supposing they would quickly kill\nhim. Whereupon I asked one of them, whether they intended to kill him;\nhe answered me, they would not. He being a little cheered with that, I\nasked him about the welfare of my husband. He told me he saw him such\na time in the Bay, and he was well, but very melancholy. By which I\ncertainly understood (though I suspected it before) that whatsoever the\nIndians told me respecting him was vanity and lies. Some of them told\nme he was dead, and they had killed him; some said he was married again,\nand that the Governor wished him to marry; and told him he should\nhave his choice, and that all persuaded I was dead. So like were these\nbarbarous creatures to him who was a liar from the beginning.\n\nAs I was sitting once in the wigwam here, Philip's maid came in with the\nchild in her arms, and asked me to give her a piece of my apron, to make\na flap for it. I told her I would not. Then my mistress bade me give it,\nbut still I said no. The maid told me if I would not give her a piece,\nshe would tear a piece off it. I told her I would tear her coat then.\nWith that my mistress rises up, and take up a stick big enough to have\nkilled me, and struck at me with it. But I stepped out, and she struck\nthe stick into the mat of the wigwam. But while she was pulling of it\nout I ran to the maid and gave her all my apron, and so that storm went\nover.\n\nHearing that my son was come to this place, I went to see him, and\ntold him his father was well, but melancholy. He told me he was as much\ngrieved for his father as for himself. I wondered at his speech, for I\nthought I had enough upon my spirit in reference to myself, to make me\nmindless of my husband and everyone else; they being safe among their\nfriends. He told me also, that awhile before, his master (together with\nother Indians) were going to the French for powder; but by the way the\nMohawks met with them, and killed four of their company, which made the\nrest turn back again, for it might have been worse with him, had he\nbeen sold to the French, than it proved to be in his remaining with the\nIndians.\n\nI went to see an English youth in this place, one John Gilbert of\nSpringfield. I found him lying without doors, upon the ground. I asked\nhim how he did? He told me he was very sick of a flux, with eating\nso much blood. They had turned him out of the wigwam, and with him an\nIndian papoose, almost dead (whose parents had been killed), in a bitter\ncold day, without fire or clothes. The young man himself had nothing on\nbut his shirt and waistcoat. This sight was enough to melt a heart of\nflint. There they lay quivering in the cold, the youth round like a dog,\nthe papoose stretched out with his eyes and nose and mouth full of dirt,\nand yet alive, and groaning. I advised John to go and get to some fire.\nHe told me he could not stand, but I persuaded him still, lest he should\nlie there and die. And with much ado I got him to a fire, and went\nmyself home. As soon as I was got home his master's daughter came after\nme, to know what I had done with the Englishman. I told her I had got\nhim to a fire in such a place. Now had I need to pray Paul's Prayer\n\"That we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men\" (2\nThessalonians 3.2). For her satisfaction I went along with her, and\nbrought her to him; but before I got home again it was noised about that\nI was running away and getting the English youth, along with me; that as\nsoon as I came in they began to rant and domineer, asking me where I had\nbeen, and what I had been doing? and saying they would knock him on the\nhead. I told them I had been seeing the English youth, and that I would\nnot run away. They told me I lied, and taking up a hatchet, they came\nto me, and said they would knock me down if I stirred out again, and so\nconfined me to the wigwam. Now may I say with David, \"I am in a great\nstrait\" (2 Samuel 24.14). If I keep in, I must die with hunger, and if\nI go out, I must be knocked in head. This distressed condition held that\nday, and half the next. And then the Lord remembered me, whose mercies\nare great. Then came an Indian to me with a pair of stockings that were\ntoo big for him, and he would have me ravel them out, and knit them fit\nfor him. I showed myself willing, and bid him ask my mistress if I might\ngo along with him a little way; she said yes, I might, but I was not\na little refreshed with that news, that I had my liberty again. Then I\nwent along with him, and he gave me some roasted ground nuts, which did\nagain revive my feeble stomach.\n\nBeing got out of her sight, I had time and liberty again to look into\nmy Bible; which was my guide by day, and my pillow by night. Now that\ncomfortable Scripture presented itself to me, \"For a small moment have I\nforsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee\" (Isaiah 54.7).\nThus the Lord carried me along from one time to another, and made good\nto me this precious promise, and many others. Then my son came to see\nme, and I asked his master to let him stay awhile with me, that I might\ncomb his head, and look over him, for he was almost overcome with lice.\nHe told me, when I had done, that he was very hungry, but I had nothing\nto relieve him, but bid him go into the wigwams as he went along, and\nsee if he could get any thing among them. Which he did, and it seems\ntarried a little too long; for his master was angry with him, and beat\nhim, and then sold him. Then he came running to tell me he had a new\nmaster, and that he had given him some ground nuts already. Then I went\nalong with him to his new master who told me he loved him, and he should\nnot want. So his master carried him away, and I never saw him afterward,\ntill I saw him at Piscataqua in Portsmouth.\n\nThat night they bade me go out of the wigwam again. My mistress's\npapoose was sick, and it died that night, and there was one benefit in\nit--that there was more room. I went to a wigwam, and they bade me come\nin, and gave me a skin to lie upon, and a mess of venison and ground\nnuts, which was a choice dish among them. On the morrow they buried the\npapoose, and afterward, both morning and evening, there came a company\nto mourn and howl with her; though I confess I could not much condole\nwith them. Many sorrowful days I had in this place, often getting alone.\n\"Like a crane, or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourn as a dove,\nmine eyes ail with looking upward. Oh, Lord, I am oppressed; undertake\nfor me\" (Isaiah 38.14). I could tell the Lord, as Hezekiah, \"Remember\nnow O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth.\" Now\nhad I time to examine all my ways: my conscience did not accuse me of\nunrighteousness toward one or other; yet I saw how in my walk with God,\nI had been a careless creature. As David said, \"Against thee, thee only\nhave I sinned\": and I might say with the poor publican, \"God be merciful\nunto me a sinner.\" On the Sabbath days, I could look upon the sun and\nthink how people were going to the house of God, to have their souls\nrefreshed; and then home, and their bodies also; but I was destitute of\nboth; and might say as the poor prodigal, \"He would fain have filled his\nbelly with the husks that the swine did eat, and no man gave unto him\"\n(Luke 15.16). For I must say with him, \"Father, I have sinned against\nHeaven and in thy sight.\" I remembered how on the night before and after\nthe Sabbath, when my family was about me, and relations and neighbors\nwith us, we could pray and sing, and then refresh our bodies with the\ngood creatures of God; and then have a comfortable bed to lie down on;\nbut instead of all this, I had only a little swill for the body and\nthen, like a swine, must lie down on the ground. I cannot express to\nman the sorrow that lay upon my spirit; the Lord knows it. Yet that\ncomfortable Scripture would often come to mind, \"For a small moment have\nI forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTEENTH REMOVE\n\nNow must we pack up and be gone from this thicket, bending our course\ntoward the Baytowns; I having nothing to eat by the way this day, but\na few crumbs of cake, that an Indian gave my girl the same day we were\ntaken. She gave it me, and I put it in my pocket; there it lay, till it\nwas so moldy (for want of good baking) that one could not tell what it\nwas made of; it fell all to crumbs, and grew so dry and hard, that it\nwas like little flints; and this refreshed me many times, when I was\nready to faint. It was in my thoughts when I put it into my mouth, that\nif ever I returned, I would tell the world what a blessing the Lord gave\nto such mean food. As we went along they killed a deer, with a young\none in her, they gave me a piece of the fawn, and it was so young and\ntender, that one might eat the bones as well as the flesh, and yet I\nthought it very good. When night came on we sat down; it rained, but\nthey quickly got up a bark wigwam, where I lay dry that night. I looked\nout in the morning, and many of them had lain in the rain all night, I\nsaw by their reeking. Thus the Lord dealt mercifully with me many times,\nand I fared better than many of them. In the morning they took the blood\nof the deer, and put it into the paunch, and so boiled it. I could eat\nnothing of that, though they ate it sweetly. And yet they were so nice\nin other things, that when I had fetched water, and had put the dish\nI dipped the water with into the kettle of water which I brought, they\nwould say they would knock me down; for they said, it was a sluttish\ntrick.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTEENTH REMOVE\n\nWe went on our travel. I having got one handful of ground nuts, for my\nsupport that day, they gave me my load, and I went on cheerfully (with\nthe thoughts of going homeward), having my burden more on my back than\nmy spirit. We came to Banquang river again that day, near which we abode\na few days. Sometimes one of them would give me a pipe, another a\nlittle tobacco, another a little salt: which I would change for a little\nvictuals. I cannot but think what a wolvish appetite persons have in a\nstarving condition; for many times when they gave me that which was hot,\nI was so greedy, that I should burn my mouth, that it would trouble me\nhours after, and yet I should quickly do the same again. And after I was\nthoroughly hungry, I was never again satisfied. For though sometimes it\nfell out, that I got enough, and did eat till I could eat no more, yet\nI was as unsatisfied as I was when I began. And now could I see that\nScripture verified (there being many Scriptures which we do not take\nnotice of, or understand till we are afflicted) \"Thou shalt eat and not\nbe satisfied\" (Micah 6.14). Now might I see more than ever before, the\nmiseries that sin hath brought upon us. Many times I should be ready to\nrun against the heathen, but the Scripture would quiet me again, \"Shall\nthere be evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it?\" (Amos 3.6). The\nLord help me to make a right improvement of His word, and that I might\nlearn that great lesson: \"He hath showed thee (Oh Man) what is good, and\nwhat doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and love mercy,\nand walk humbly with thy God? Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed\nit\" (Micah 6.8-9).\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTEENTH REMOVAL\n\nWe began this remove with wading over Banquang river: the water was up\nto the knees, and the stream very swift, and so cold that I thought it\nwould have cut me in sunder. I was so weak and feeble, that I reeled\nas I went along, and thought there I must end my days at last, after\nmy bearing and getting through so many difficulties. The Indians stood\nlaughing to see me staggering along; but in my distress the Lord gave\nme experience of the truth, and goodness of that promise, \"When thou\npassest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers,\nthey shall not overflow thee\" (Isaiah 43.2). Then I sat down to put\non my stockings and shoes, with the tears running down mine eyes, and\nsorrowful thoughts in my heart, but I got up to go along with them.\nQuickly there came up to us an Indian, who informed them that I must go\nto Wachusett to my master, for there was a letter come from the council\nto the Sagamores, about redeeming the captives, and that there would be\nanother in fourteen days, and that I must be there ready. My heart was\nso heavy before that I could scarce speak or go in the path; and yet\nnow so light, that I could run. My strength seemed to come again, and\nrecruit my feeble knees, and aching heart. Yet it pleased them to go but\none mile that night, and there we stayed two days. In that time came\na company of Indians to us, near thirty, all on horseback. My heart\nskipped within me, thinking they had been Englishmen at the first sight\nof them, for they were dressed in English apparel, with hats, white\nneckcloths, and sashes about their waists; and ribbons upon their\nshoulders; but when they came near, there was a vast difference between\nthe lovely faces of Christians, and foul looks of those heathens, which\nmuch damped my spirit again.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTEENTH REMOVE\n\nA comfortable remove it was to me, because of my hopes. They gave me a\npack, and along we went cheerfully; but quickly my will proved more than\nmy strength; having little or no refreshing, my strength failed me, and\nmy spirits were almost quite gone. Now may I say with David \"I am poor\nand needy, and my heart is wounded within me. I am gone like the shadow\nwhen it declineth: I am tossed up and down like the locust; my knees\nare weak through fasting, and my flesh faileth of fatness\" (Psalm\n119.22-24). At night we came to an Indian town, and the Indians sat down\nby a wigwam discoursing, but I was almost spent, and could scarce speak.\nI laid down my load, and went into the wigwam, and there sat an Indian\nboiling of horses feet (they being wont to eat the flesh first, and when\nthe feet were old and dried, and they had nothing else, they would\ncut off the feet and use them). I asked him to give me a little of his\nbroth, or water they were boiling in; he took a dish, and gave me one\nspoonful of samp, and bid me take as much of the broth as I would. Then\nI put some of the hot water to the samp, and drank it up, and my spirit\ncame again. He gave me also a piece of the ruff or ridding of the small\nguts, and I broiled it on the coals; and now may I say with Jonathan,\n\"See, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted\na little of this honey\" (1 Samuel 14.29). Now is my spirit revived\nagain; though means be never so inconsiderable, yet if the Lord bestow\nHis blessing upon them, they shall refresh both soul and body.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EIGHTEENTH REMOVE\n\nWe took up our packs and along we went, but a wearisome day I had of it.\nAs we went along I saw an Englishman stripped naked, and lying dead\nupon the ground, but knew not who it was. Then we came to another Indian\ntown, where we stayed all night. In this town there were four English\nchildren, captives; and one of them my own sister's. I went to see how\nshe did, and she was well, considering her captive condition. I would\nhave tarried that night with her, but they that owned her would not\nsuffer it. Then I went into another wigwam, where they were boiling corn\nand beans, which was a lovely sight to see, but I could not get a taste\nthereof. Then I went to another wigwam, where there were two of the\nEnglish children; the squaw was boiling horses feet; then she cut me off\na little piece, and gave one of the English children a piece also. Being\nvery hungry I had quickly eat up mine, but the child could not bite\nit, it was so tough and sinewy, but lay sucking, gnawing, chewing and\nslabbering of it in the mouth and hand. Then I took it of the child, and\neat it myself, and savory it was to my taste. Then I may say as Job 6.7,\n\"The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.\"\nThus the Lord made that pleasant refreshing, which another time would\nhave been an abomination. Then I went home to my mistress's wigwam; and\nthey told me I disgraced my master with begging, and if I did so any\nmore, they would knock me in the head. I told them, they had as good\nknock me in head as starve me to death.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NINETEENTH REMOVE\n\nThey said, when we went out, that we must travel to Wachusett this day.\nBut a bitter weary day I had of it, traveling now three days together,\nwithout resting any day between. At last, after many weary steps, I\nsaw Wachusett hills, but many miles off. Then we came to a great swamp,\nthrough which we traveled, up to the knees in mud and water, which was\nheavy going to one tired before. Being almost spent, I thought I should\nhave sunk down at last, and never got out; but I may say, as in Psalm\n94.18, \"When my foot slipped, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.\" Going\nalong, having indeed my life, but little spirit, Philip, who was in the\ncompany, came up and took me by the hand, and said, two weeks more and\nyou shall be mistress again. I asked him, if he spake true? He answered,\n\"Yes, and quickly you shall come to your master again; who had been gone\nfrom us three weeks.\" After many weary steps we came to Wachusett, where\nhe was: and glad I was to see him. He asked me, when I washed me? I told\nhim not this month. Then he fetched me some water himself, and bid me\nwash, and gave me the glass to see how I looked; and bid his squaw give\nme something to eat. So she gave me a mess of beans and meat, and a\nlittle ground nut cake. I was wonderfully revived with this favor showed\nme: \"He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them\ncaptives\" (Psalm 106.46).\n\nMy master had three squaws, living sometimes with one, and sometimes\nwith another one, this old squaw, at whose wigwam I was, and with whom\nmy master had been those three weeks. Another was Wattimore [Weetamoo]\nwith whom I had lived and served all this while. A severe and proud dame\nshe was, bestowing every day in dressing herself neat as much time as\nany of the gentry of the land: powdering her hair, and painting her\nface, going with necklaces, with jewels in her ears, and bracelets upon\nher hands. When she had dressed herself, her work was to make girdles of\nwampum and beads. The third squaw was a younger one, by whom he had two\npapooses. By the time I was refreshed by the old squaw, with whom\nmy master was, Weetamoo's maid came to call me home, at which I fell\naweeping. Then the old squaw told me, to encourage me, that if I wanted\nvictuals, I should come to her, and that I should lie there in her\nwigwam. Then I went with the maid, and quickly came again and lodged\nthere. The squaw laid a mat under me, and a good rug over me; the first\ntime I had any such kindness showed me. I understood that Weetamoo\nthought that if she should let me go and serve with the old squaw, she\nwould be in danger to lose not only my service, but the redemption pay\nalso. And I was not a little glad to hear this; being by it raised in\nmy hopes, that in God's due time there would be an end of this sorrowful\nhour. Then came an Indian, and asked me to knit him three pair of\nstockings, for which I had a hat, and a silk handkerchief. Then another\nasked me to make her a shift, for which she gave me an apron.\n\nThen came Tom and Peter, with the second letter from the council, about\nthe captives. Though they were Indians, I got them by the hand, and\nburst out into tears. My heart was so full that I could not speak to\nthem; but recovering myself, I asked them how my husband did, and all\nmy friends and acquaintance? They said, \"They are all very well but\nmelancholy.\" They brought me two biscuits, and a pound of tobacco. The\ntobacco I quickly gave away. When it was all gone, one asked me to give\nhim a pipe of tobacco. I told him it was all gone. Then began he to rant\nand threaten. I told him when my husband came I would give him some.\nHang him rogue (says he) I will knock out his brains, if he comes here.\nAnd then again, in the same breath they would say that if there should\ncome an hundred without guns, they would do them no hurt. So unstable\nand like madmen they were. So that fearing the worst, I durst not send\nto my husband, though there were some thoughts of his coming to redeem\nand fetch me, not knowing what might follow. For there was little more\ntrust to them than to the master they served. When the letter was come,\nthe Sagamores met to consult about the captives, and called me to them\nto inquire how much my husband would give to redeem me. When I came I\nsat down among them, as I was wont to do, as their manner is. Then they\nbade me stand up, and said they were the General Court. They bid me\nspeak what I thought he would give. Now knowing that all we had was\ndestroyed by the Indians, I was in a great strait. I thought if I should\nspeak of but a little it would be slighted, and hinder the matter; if of\na great sum, I knew not where it would be procured. Yet at a venture I\nsaid \"Twenty pounds,\" yet desired them to take less. But they would not\nhear of that, but sent that message to Boston, that for twenty pounds I\nshould be redeemed. It was a Praying Indian that wrote their letter\nfor them. There was another Praying Indian, who told me, that he had\na brother, that would not eat horse; his conscience was so tender\nand scrupulous (though as large as hell, for the destruction of poor\nChristians). Then he said, he read that Scripture to him, \"There was a\nfamine in Samaria, and behold they besieged it, until an ass's head was\nsold for four-score pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of\ndove's dung for five pieces of silver\" (2 Kings 6.25). He expounded this\nplace to his brother, and showed him that it was lawful to eat that in a\nfamine which is not at another time. And now, says he, he will eat horse\nwith any Indian of them all. There was another Praying Indian, who when\nhe had done all the mischief that he could, betrayed his own father into\nthe English hands, thereby to purchase his own life. Another Praying\nIndian was at Sudbury fight, though, as he deserved, he was afterward\nhanged for it. There was another Praying Indian, so wicked and cruel,\nas to wear a string about his neck, strung with Christians' fingers.\nAnother Praying Indian, when they went to Sudbury fight, went with them,\nand his squaw also with him, with her papoose at her back. Before they\nwent to that fight they got a company together to pow-wow. The manner\nwas as followeth: there was one that kneeled upon a deerskin, with the\ncompany round him in a ring who kneeled, and striking upon the ground\nwith their hands, and with sticks, and muttering or humming with their\nmouths. Besides him who kneeled in the ring, there also stood one with\na gun in his hand. Then he on the deerskin made a speech, and all\nmanifested assent to it; and so they did many times together. Then they\nbade him with the gun go out of the ring, which he did. But when he was\nout, they called him in again; but he seemed to make a stand; then they\ncalled the more earnestly, till he returned again. Then they all sang.\nThen they gave him two guns, in either hand one. And so he on the\ndeerskin began again; and at the end of every sentence in his speaking,\nthey all assented, humming or muttering with their mouths, and striking\nupon the ground with their hands. Then they bade him with the two guns\ngo out of the ring again; which he did, a little way. Then they called\nhim in again, but he made a stand. So they called him with greater\nearnestness; but he stood reeling and wavering as if he knew not whither\nhe should stand or fall, or which way to go. Then they called him with\nexceeding great vehemency, all of them, one and another. After a little\nwhile he turned in, staggering as he went, with his arms stretched out,\nin either hand a gun. As soon as he came in they all sang and rejoiced\nexceedingly a while. And then he upon the deerskin, made another speech\nunto which they all assented in a rejoicing manner. And so they ended\ntheir business, and forthwith went to Sudbury fight. To my thinking they\nwent without any scruple, but that they should prosper, and gain the\nvictory. And they went out not so rejoicing, but they came home with as\ngreat a victory. For they said they had killed two captains and almost\nan hundred men. One Englishman they brought along with them: and he\nsaid, it was too true, for they had made sad work at Sudbury, as indeed\nit proved. Yet they came home without that rejoicing and triumphing over\ntheir victory which they were wont to show at other times; but rather\nlike dogs (as they say) which have lost their ears. Yet I could not\nperceive that it was for their own loss of men. They said they had not\nlost above five or six; and I missed none, except in one wigwam. When\nthey went, they acted as if the devil had told them that they should\ngain the victory; and now they acted as if the devil had told them they\nshould have a fall. Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so it\nproved, for quickly they began to fall, and so held on that summer, till\nthey came to utter ruin. They came home on a Sabbath day, and the Powaw\nthat kneeled upon the deer-skin came home (I may say, without abuse) as\nblack as the devil. When my master came home, he came to me and bid me\nmake a shirt for his papoose, of a holland-laced pillowbere. About that\ntime there came an Indian to me and bid me come to his wigwam at night,\nand he would give me some pork and ground nuts. Which I did, and as I\nwas eating, another Indian said to me, he seems to be your good friend,\nbut he killed two Englishmen at Sudbury, and there lie their clothes\nbehind you: I looked behind me, and there I saw bloody clothes, with\nbullet-holes in them. Yet the Lord suffered not this wretch to do me\nany hurt. Yea, instead of that, he many times refreshed me; five or six\ntimes did he and his squaw refresh my feeble carcass. If I went to their\nwigwam at any time, they would always give me something, and yet they\nwere strangers that I never saw before. Another squaw gave me a piece of\nfresh pork, and a little salt with it, and lent me her pan to fry it in;\nand I cannot but remember what a sweet, pleasant and delightful relish\nthat bit had to me, to this day. So little do we prize common mercies\nwhen we have them to the full.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TWENTIETH REMOVE\n\nIt was their usual manner to remove, when they had done any mischief,\nlest they should be found out; and so they did at this time. We went\nabout three or four miles, and there they built a great wigwam, big\nenough to hold an hundred Indians, which they did in preparation to a\ngreat day of dancing. They would say now amongst themselves, that the\ngovernor would be so angry for his loss at Sudbury, that he would send\nno more about the captives, which made me grieve and tremble. My sister\nbeing not far from the place where we now were, and hearing that I was\nhere, desired her master to let her come and see me, and he was willing\nto it, and would go with her; but she being ready before him, told him\nshe would go before, and was come within a mile or two of the place.\nThen he overtook her, and began to rant as if he had been mad, and made\nher go back again in the rain; so that I never saw her till I saw her\nin Charlestown. But the Lord requited many of their ill doings, for this\nIndian her master, was hanged afterward at Boston. The Indians now began\nto come from all quarters, against their merry dancing day. Among some\nof them came one goodwife Kettle. I told her my heart was so heavy that\nit was ready to break. \"So is mine too,\" said she, but yet said, \"I hope\nwe shall hear some good news shortly.\" I could hear how earnestly my\nsister desired to see me, and I as earnestly desired to see her; and yet\nneither of us could get an opportunity. My daughter was also now about a\nmile off, and I had not seen her in nine or ten weeks, as I had not seen\nmy sister since our first taking. I earnestly desired them to let me go\nand see them: yea, I entreated, begged, and persuaded them, but to let\nme see my daughter; and yet so hard-hearted were they, that they would\nnot suffer it. They made use of their tyrannical power whilst they\nhad it; but through the Lord's wonderful mercy, their time was now but\nshort.\n\nOn a Sabbath day, the sun being about an hour high in the afternoon,\ncame Mr. John Hoar (the council permitting him, and his own foreward\nspirit inclining him), together with the two forementioned Indians,\nTom and Peter, with their third letter from the council. When they came\nnear, I was abroad. Though I saw them not, they presently called me in,\nand bade me sit down and not stir. Then they catched up their guns, and\naway they ran, as if an enemy had been at hand, and the guns went off\napace. I manifested some great trouble, and they asked me what was the\nmatter? I told them I thought they had killed the Englishman (for they\nhad in the meantime informed me that an Englishman was come). They said,\nno. They shot over his horse and under and before his horse, and they\npushed him this way and that way, at their pleasure, showing what they\ncould do. Then they let them come to their wigwams. I begged of them to\nlet me see the Englishman, but they would not. But there was I fain\nto sit their pleasure. When they had talked their fill with him, they\nsuffered me to go to him. We asked each other of our welfare, and how\nmy husband did, and all my friends? He told me they were all well, and\nwould be glad to see me. Amongst other things which my husband sent me,\nthere came a pound of tobacco, which I sold for nine shillings in money;\nfor many of the Indians for want of tobacco, smoked hemlock, and ground\nivy. It was a great mistake in any, who thought I sent for tobacco; for\nthrough the favor of God, that desire was overcome. I now asked them\nwhether I should go home with Mr. Hoar? They answered no, one and\nanother of them, and it being night, we lay down with that answer. In\nthe morning Mr. Hoar invited the Sagamores to dinner; but when we went\nto get it ready we found that they had stolen the greatest part of the\nprovision Mr. Hoar had brought, out of his bags, in the night. And we\nmay see the wonderful power of God, in that one passage, in that when\nthere was such a great number of the Indians together, and so greedy of\na little good food, and no English there but Mr. Hoar and myself, that\nthere they did not knock us in the head, and take what we had, there\nbeing not only some provision, but also trading-cloth, a part of the\ntwenty pounds agreed upon. But instead of doing us any mischief, they\nseemed to be ashamed of the fact, and said, it were some matchit Indian\nthat did it. Oh, that we could believe that there is nothing too hard\nfor God! God showed His power over the heathen in this, as He did over\nthe hungry lions when Daniel was cast into the den. Mr. Hoar called\nthem betime to dinner, but they ate very little, they being so busy\nin dressing themselves, and getting ready for their dance, which was\ncarried on by eight of them, four men and four squaws. My master and\nmistress being two. He was dressed in his holland shirt, with great\nlaces sewed at the tail of it; he had his silver buttons, his white\nstockings, his garters were hung round with shillings, and he had\ngirdles of wampum upon his head and shoulders. She had a kersey coat,\nand covered with girdles of wampum from the loins upward. Her arms from\nher elbows to her hands were covered with bracelets; there were handfuls\nof necklaces about her neck, and several sorts of jewels in her ears.\nShe had fine red stockings, and white shoes, her hair powdered and face\npainted red, that was always before black. And all the dancers were\nafter the same manner. There were two others singing and knocking on a\nkettle for their music. They kept hopping up and down one after another,\nwith a kettle of water in the midst, standing warm upon some embers,\nto drink of when they were dry. They held on till it was almost night,\nthrowing out wampum to the standers by. At night I asked them again, if\nI should go home? They all as one said no, except my husband would come\nfor me. When we were lain down, my master went out of the wigwam, and\nby and by sent in an Indian called James the Printer, who told Mr. Hoar,\nthat my master would let me go home tomorrow, if he would let him have\none pint of liquors. Then Mr. Hoar called his own Indians, Tom and\nPeter, and bid them go and see whether he would promise it before them\nthree; and if he would, he should have it; which he did, and he had it.\nThen Philip smelling the business called me to him, and asked me what I\nwould give him, to tell me some good news, and speak a good word for\nme. I told him I could not tell what to give him. I would [give him]\nanything I had, and asked him what he would have? He said two coats\nand twenty shillings in money, and half a bushel of seed corn, and some\ntobacco. I thanked him for his love; but I knew the good news as well\nas the crafty fox. My master after he had had his drink, quickly came\nranting into the wigwam again, and called for Mr. Hoar, drinking to him,\nand saying, he was a good man, and then again he would say, \"hang him\nrogue.\" Being almost drunk, he would drink to him, and yet presently say\nhe should be hanged. Then he called for me. I trembled to hear him, yet\nI was fain to go to him, and he drank to me, showing no incivility. He\nwas the first Indian I saw drunk all the while that I was amongst them.\nAt last his squaw ran out, and he after her, round the wigwam, with\nhis money jingling at his knees. But she escaped him. But having an old\nsquaw he ran to her; and so through the Lord's mercy, we were no more\ntroubled that night. Yet I had not a comfortable night's rest; for I\nthink I can say, I did not sleep for three nights together. The night\nbefore the letter came from the council, I could not rest, I was so full\nof fears and troubles, God many times leaving us most in the dark, when\ndeliverance is nearest. Yea, at this time I could not rest night nor\nday. The next night I was overjoyed, Mr. Hoar being come, and that with\nsuch good tidings. The third night I was even swallowed up with the\nthoughts of things, viz. that ever I should go home again; and that I\nmust go, leaving my children behind me in the wilderness; so that sleep\nwas now almost departed from mine eyes.\n\nOn Tuesday morning they called their general court (as they call it) to\nconsult and determine, whether I should go home or no. And they all\nas one man did seemingly consent to it, that I should go home; except\nPhilip, who would not come among them.\n\nBut before I go any further, I would take leave to mention a few\nremarkable passages of providence, which I took special notice of in my\nafflicted time.\n\n1. Of the fair opportunity lost in the long march, a little after the\nfort fight, when our English army was so numerous, and in pursuit of the\nenemy, and so near as to take several and destroy them, and the enemy in\nsuch distress for food that our men might track them by their rooting\nin the earth for ground nuts, whilst they were flying for their lives.\nI say, that then our army should want provision, and be forced to leave\ntheir pursuit and return homeward; and the very next week the enemy came\nupon our town, like bears bereft of their whelps, or so many ravenous\nwolves, rending us and our lambs to death. But what shall I say? God\nseemed to leave his People to themselves, and order all things for His\nown holy ends. Shall there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not\ndone it? They are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph, therefore\nshall they go captive, with the first that go captive. It is the Lord's\ndoing, and it should be marvelous in our eyes.\n\n2. I cannot but remember how the Indians derided the slowness, and\ndullness of the English army, in its setting out. For after the\ndesolations at Lancaster and Medfield, as I went along with them, they\nasked me when I thought the English army would come after them? I told\nthem I could not tell. \"It may be they will come in May,\" said they.\nThus did they scoff at us, as if the English would be a quarter of a\nyear getting ready.\n\n3. Which also I have hinted before, when the English army with\nnew supplies were sent forth to pursue after the enemy, and they\nunderstanding it, fled before them till they came to Banquang river,\nwhere they forthwith went over safely; that that river should be\nimpassable to the English. I can but admire to see the wonderful\nprovidence of God in preserving the heathen for further affliction to\nour poor country. They could go in great numbers over, but the English\nmust stop. God had an over-ruling hand in all those things.\n\n4. It was thought, if their corn were cut down, they would starve and\ndie with hunger, and all their corn that could be found, was destroyed,\nand they driven from that little they had in store, into the woods in\nthe midst of winter; and yet how to admiration did the Lord preserve\nthem for His holy ends, and the destruction of many still amongst the\nEnglish! strangely did the Lord provide for them; that I did not see\n(all the time I was among them) one man, woman, or child, die with\nhunger.\n\nThough many times they would eat that, that a hog or a dog would hardly\ntouch; yet by that God strengthened them to be a scourge to His people.\n\nThe chief and commonest food was ground nuts. They eat also nuts and\nacorns, artichokes, lilly roots, ground beans, and several other weeds\nand roots, that I know not.\n\nThey would pick up old bones, and cut them to pieces at the joints, and\nif they were full of worms and maggots, they would scald them over the\nfire to make the vermine come out, and then boil them, and drink up the\nliquor, and then beat the great ends of them in a mortar, and so eat\nthem. They would eat horse's guts, and ears, and all sorts of wild birds\nwhich they could catch; also bear, venison, beaver, tortoise, frogs,\nsquirrels, dogs, skunks, rattlesnakes; yea, the very bark of trees;\nbesides all sorts of creatures, and provision which they plundered from\nthe English. I can but stand in admiration to see the wonderful power\nof God in providing for such a vast number of our enemies in the\nwilderness, where there was nothing to be seen, but from hand to mouth.\nMany times in a morning, the generality of them would eat up all they\nhad, and yet have some further supply against they wanted. It is said,\n\"Oh, that my People had hearkened to me, and Israel had walked in my\nways, I should soon have subdued their Enemies, and turned my hand\nagainst their Adversaries\" (Psalm 81.13-14). But now our perverse and\nevil carriages in the sight of the Lord, have so offended Him, that\ninstead of turning His hand against them, the Lord feeds and nourishes\nthem up to be a scourge to the whole land.\n\n5. Another thing that I would observe is the strange providence of God,\nin turning things about when the Indians was at the highest, and the\nEnglish at the lowest. I was with the enemy eleven weeks and five\ndays, and not one week passed without the fury of the enemy, and some\ndesolation by fire and sword upon one place or other. They mourned (with\ntheir black faces) for their own losses, yet triumphed and rejoiced in\ntheir inhumane, and many times devilish cruelty to the English. They\nwould boast much of their victories; saying that in two hours time they\nhad destroyed such a captain and his company at such a place; and boast\nhow many towns they had destroyed, and then scoff, and say they had done\nthem a good turn to send them to Heaven so soon. Again, they would say\nthis summer that they would knock all the rogues in the head, or drive\nthem into the sea, or make them fly the country; thinking surely,\nAgag-like, \"The bitterness of Death is past.\" Now the heathen begins to\nthink all is their own, and the poor Christians' hopes to fail (as\nto man) and now their eyes are more to God, and their hearts sigh\nheaven-ward; and to say in good earnest, \"Help Lord, or we perish.\"\nWhen the Lord had brought His people to this, that they saw no help in\nanything but Himself; then He takes the quarrel into His own hand; and\nthough they had made a pit, in their own imaginations, as deep as hell\nfor the Christians that summer, yet the Lord hurled themselves into it.\nAnd the Lord had not so many ways before to preserve them, but now He\nhath as many to destroy them.\n\nBut to return again to my going home, where we may see a remarkable\nchange of providence. At first they were all against it, except my\nhusband would come for me, but afterwards they assented to it, and\nseemed much to rejoice in it; some asked me to send them some bread,\nothers some tobacco, others shaking me by the hand, offering me a hood\nand scarfe to ride in; not one moving hand or tongue against it. Thus\nhath the Lord answered my poor desire, and the many earnest requests of\nothers put up unto God for me. In my travels an Indian came to me and\ntold me, if I were willing, he and his squaw would run away, and go home\nalong with me. I told him no: I was not willing to run away, but desired\nto wait God's time, that I might go home quietly, and without fear. And\nnow God hath granted me my desire. O the wonderful power of God that I\nhave seen, and the experience that I have had. I have been in the midst\nof those roaring lions, and savage bears, that feared neither God, nor\nman, nor the devil, by night and day, alone and in company, sleeping all\nsorts together, and yet not one of them ever offered me the least abuse\nof unchastity to me, in word or action. Though some are ready to say I\nspeak it for my own credit; but I speak it in the presence of God, and\nto His Glory. God's power is as great now, and as sufficient to save, as\nwhen He preserved Daniel in the lion's den; or the three children in the\nfiery furnace. I may well say as his Psalm 107.12 \"Oh give thanks unto\nthe Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.\" Let the\nredeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of\nthe enemy, especially that I should come away in the midst of so many\nhundreds of enemies quietly and peaceably, and not a dog moving his\ntongue. So I took my leave of them, and in coming along my heart melted\ninto tears, more than all the while I was with them, and I was almost\nswallowed up with the thoughts that ever I should go home again. About\nthe sun going down, Mr. Hoar, and myself, and the two Indians came\nto Lancaster, and a solemn sight it was to me. There had I lived many\ncomfortable years amongst my relations and neighbors, and now not one\nChristian to be seen, nor one house left standing. We went on to\na farmhouse that was yet standing, where we lay all night, and a\ncomfortable lodging we had, though nothing but straw to lie on. The\nLord preserved us in safety that night, and raised us up again in the\nmorning, and carried us along, that before noon, we came to Concord. Now\nwas I full of joy, and yet not without sorrow; joy to see such a lovely\nsight, so many Christians together, and some of them my neighbors. There\nI met with my brother, and my brother-in-law, who asked me, if I knew\nwhere his wife was? Poor heart! he had helped to bury her, and knew it\nnot. She being shot down by the house was partly burnt, so that\nthose who were at Boston at the desolation of the town, and came back\nafterward, and buried the dead, did not know her. Yet I was not without\nsorrow, to think how many were looking and longing, and my own children\namongst the rest, to enjoy that deliverance that I had now received,\nand I did not know whether ever I should see them again. Being recruited\nwith food and raiment we went to Boston that day, where I met with my\ndear husband, but the thoughts of our dear children, one being dead, and\nthe other we could not tell where, abated our comfort each to other. I\nwas not before so much hemmed in with the merciless and cruel heathen,\nbut now as much with pitiful, tender-hearted and compassionate\nChristians. In that poor, and distressed, and beggarly condition I was\nreceived in; I was kindly entertained in several houses. So much love I\nreceived from several (some of whom I knew, and others I knew not) that\nI am not capable to declare it. But the Lord knows them all by name.\nThe Lord reward them sevenfold into their bosoms of His spirituals,\nfor their temporals. The twenty pounds, the price of my redemption,\nwas raised by some Boston gentlemen, and Mrs. Usher, whose bounty and\nreligious charity, I would not forget to make mention of. Then Mr.\nThomas Shepard of Charlestown received us into his house, where we\ncontinued eleven weeks; and a father and mother they were to us. And\nmany more tender-hearted friends we met with in that place. We were now\nin the midst of love, yet not without much and frequent heaviness of\nheart for our poor children, and other relations, who were still in\naffliction. The week following, after my coming in, the governor and\ncouncil sent forth to the Indians again; and that not without success;\nfor they brought in my sister, and goodwife Kettle. Their not knowing\nwhere our children were was a sore trial to us still, and yet we were\nnot without secret hopes that we should see them again. That which was\ndead lay heavier upon my spirit, than those which were alive and amongst\nthe heathen: thinking how it suffered with its wounds, and I was no\nway able to relieve it; and how it was buried by the heathen in the\nwilderness from among all Christians. We were hurried up and down in our\nthoughts, sometime we should hear a report that they were gone this way,\nand sometimes that; and that they were come in, in this place or that.\nWe kept inquiring and listening to hear concerning them, but no certain\nnews as yet. About this time the council had ordered a day of public\nthanksgiving. Though I thought I had still cause of mourning, and being\nunsettled in our minds, we thought we would ride toward the eastward,\nto see if we could hear anything concerning our children. And as we were\nriding along (God is the wise disposer of all things) between Ipswich\nand Rowley we met with Mr. William Hubbard, who told us that our son\nJoseph was come in to Major Waldron's, and another with him, which was\nmy sister's son. I asked him how he knew it? He said the major himself\ntold him so. So along we went till we came to Newbury; and their\nminister being absent, they desired my husband to preach the\nthanksgiving for them; but he was not willing to stay there that night,\nbut would go over to Salisbury, to hear further, and come again in the\nmorning, which he did, and preached there that day. At night, when\nhe had done, one came and told him that his daughter was come in at\nProvidence. Here was mercy on both hands. Now hath God fulfilled that\nprecious Scripture which was such a comfort to me in my distressed\ncondition. When my heart was ready to sink into the earth (my children\nbeing gone, I could not tell whither) and my knees trembling under me,\nand I was walking through the valley of the shadow of death; then the\nLord brought, and now has fulfilled that reviving word unto me: \"Thus\nsaith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from\ntears, for thy Work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord, and they shall\ncome again from the Land of the Enemy.\" Now we were between them, the\none on the east, and the other on the west. Our son being nearest, we\nwent to him first, to Portsmouth, where we met with him, and with the\nMajor also, who told us he had done what he could, but could not redeem\nhim under seven pounds, which the good people thereabouts were pleased\nto pay. The Lord reward the major, and all the rest, though unknown\nto me, for their labor of Love. My sister's son was redeemed for four\npounds, which the council gave order for the payment of. Having now\nreceived one of our children, we hastened toward the other. Going back\nthrough Newbury my husband preached there on the Sabbath day; for which\nthey rewarded him many fold.\n\nOn Monday we came to Charlestown, where we heard that the governor of\nRhode Island had sent over for our daughter, to take care of her,\nbeing now within his jurisdiction; which should not pass without our\nacknowledgments. But she being nearer Rehoboth than Rhode Island, Mr.\nNewman went over, and took care of her and brought her to his own house.\nAnd the goodness of God was admirable to us in our low estate, in that\nHe raised up passionate friends on every side to us, when we had nothing\nto recompense any for their love. The Indians were now gone that way,\nthat it was apprehended dangerous to go to her. But the carts which\ncarried provision to the English army, being guarded, brought her with\nthem to Dorchester, where we received her safe. Blessed be the Lord for\nit, for great is His power, and He can do whatsoever seemeth Him good.\nHer coming in was after this manner: she was traveling one day with the\nIndians, with her basket at her back; the company of Indians were got\nbefore her, and gone out of sight, all except one squaw; she followed\nthe squaw till night, and then both of them lay down, having nothing\nover them but the heavens and under them but the earth. Thus she\ntraveled three days together, not knowing whither she was going; having\nnothing to eat or drink but water, and green hirtle-berries. At last\nthey came into Providence, where she was kindly entertained by several\nof that town. The Indians often said that I should never have her under\ntwenty pounds. But now the Lord hath brought her in upon free-cost, and\ngiven her to me the second time. The Lord make us a blessing indeed,\neach to others. Now have I seen that Scripture also fulfilled, \"If any\nof thine be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will\nthe Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee. And\nthe Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on\nthem which hate thee, which persecuted thee\" (Deuteronomy 30.4-7). Thus\nhath the Lord brought me and mine out of that horrible pit, and hath set\nus in the midst of tender-hearted and compassionate Christians. It is\nthe desire of my soul that we may walk worthy of the mercies received,\nand which we are receiving.\n\nOur family being now gathered together (those of us that were living),\nthe South Church in Boston hired an house for us. Then we removed from\nMr. Shepard's, those cordial friends, and went to Boston, where we\ncontinued about three-quarters of a year. Still the Lord went along with\nus, and provided graciously for us. I thought it somewhat strange to set\nup house-keeping with bare walls; but as Solomon says, \"Money answers\nall things\" and that we had through the benevolence of Christian\nfriends, some in this town, and some in that, and others; and some\nfrom England; that in a little time we might look, and see the house\nfurnished with love. The Lord hath been exceeding good to us in our\nlow estate, in that when we had neither house nor home, nor other\nnecessaries, the Lord so moved the hearts of these and those towards us,\nthat we wanted neither food, nor raiment for ourselves or ours: \"There\nis a Friend which sticketh closer than a Brother\" (Proverbs 18.24). And\nhow many such friends have we found, and now living amongst? And truly\nsuch a friend have we found him to be unto us, in whose house we lived,\nviz. Mr. James Whitcomb, a friend unto us near hand, and afar off.\n\nI can remember the time when I used to sleep quietly without workings\nin my thoughts, whole nights together, but now it is other ways with me.\nWhen all are fast about me, and no eye open, but His who ever waketh, my\nthoughts are upon things past, upon the awful dispensation of the\nLord towards us, upon His wonderful power and might, in carrying of us\nthrough so many difficulties, in returning us in safety, and suffering\nnone to hurt us. I remember in the night season, how the other day I was\nin the midst of thousands of enemies, and nothing but death before me.\nIt is then hard work to persuade myself, that ever I should be satisfied\nwith bread again. But now we are fed with the finest of the wheat, and,\nas I may say, with honey out of the rock. Instead of the husk, we have\nthe fatted calf. The thoughts of these things in the particulars of\nthem, and of the love and goodness of God towards us, make it true\nof me, what David said of himself, \"I watered my Couch with my tears\"\n(Psalm 6.6). Oh! the wonderful power of God that mine eyes have seen,\naffording matter enough for my thoughts to run in, that when others are\nsleeping mine eyes are weeping.\n\nI have seen the extreme vanity of this world: One hour I have been in\nhealth, and wealthy, wanting nothing. But the next hour in sickness and\nwounds, and death, having nothing but sorrow and affliction.\n\nBefore I knew what affliction meant, I was ready sometimes to wish for\nit. When I lived in prosperity, having the comforts of the world about\nme, my relations by me, my heart cheerful, and taking little care for\nanything, and yet seeing many, whom I preferred before myself, under\nmany trials and afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty, losses,\ncrosses, and cares of the world, I should be sometimes jealous least I\nshould have my portion in this life, and that Scripture would come to my\nmind, \"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son\nwhom he receiveth\" (Hebrews 12.6). But now I see the Lord had His\ntime to scourge and chasten me. The portion of some is to have their\nafflictions by drops, now one drop and then another; but the dregs of\nthe cup, the wine of astonishment, like a sweeping rain that leaveth no\nfood, did the Lord prepare to be my portion. Affliction I wanted, and\naffliction I had, full measure (I thought), pressed down and running\nover. Yet I see, when God calls a person to anything, and through never\nso many difficulties, yet He is fully able to carry them through and\nmake them see, and say they have been gainers thereby. And I hope I can\nsay in some measure, as David did, \"It is good for me that I have been\nafflicted.\" The Lord hath showed me the vanity of these outward things.\nThat they are the vanity of vanities, and vexation of spirit, that they\nare but a shadow, a blast, a bubble, and things of no continuance. That\nwe must rely on God Himself, and our whole dependance must be upon Him.\nIf trouble from smaller matters begin to arise in me, I have something\nat hand to check myself with, and say, why am I troubled? It was but\nthe other day that if I had had the world, I would have given it for\nmy freedom, or to have been a servant to a Christian. I have learned to\nlook beyond present and smaller troubles, and to be quieted under them.\nAs Moses said, \"Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord\" (Exodus\n14.13).\n\nFinis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Captivity and Restoration, by Mrs. Mary Rowlandson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAPTIVITY AND RESTORATION ***\n\n***** This file should be named 851.txt or 851.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/5\/851\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":567,"split":"train"}
