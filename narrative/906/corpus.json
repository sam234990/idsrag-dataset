During a summer retreat at Asquith resort, he runs into the Celebrity, who has taken the identity of another man for anonymity. The Celebrity meets Irene Trevor, the daughter of an Ohio state senator, and asks her to marry him. When a more desirable female, Marian Thorn, arrives at Asquith, the Celebrity leaves her without breaking off the engagement. That goes against the moral fiber of the Celebrity's stories. Both women know his true identity as a famous writer and are familiar with his published works.\nMr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke and his wife are wealthy and have made a summer retreat of their own named Mohair. The Celebrity leaves Asquith for Mohair to be with Marian Thorn, who is the niece of the Cookes. The slighted Irene Trevor confides in John Crocker that the Celebrity never broke up with her, and that could be used against him later.\nMr. Cooke throws a party and invites the people from Asquith to join them. John Crocker and Miss Trevor reluctantly go. It appears to John Crocker that Miss Thorn and the Celebrity are romantically involved and that he is jealous. Mr. Cooke buys a new yacht, the Maria (named after his wife), and he invites all his guests for a trip to Bear Island.\nAt Bear Island, a newspaper brought on board the yacht reveals in a story that Charles Wrexell Allan has embezzled $100,000 from the Miles Standish Bicycle Company. That is the same man the Celebrity is impersonating. When the Celebrity asks John Crocker and Miss Trevor to reveal his true identity, they decide to be mischievous and pretend not to know him by any name but Allan.\nAnother yacht enters Bear Island harbor and a man in an obvious disguise, Mr. Dunn, visits the island. The party believes Mr. Dunn is a detective. Mr. Trevor demands for the Celebrity to be turned over to authorities. The Celebrity is hidden in a cave for the night. The next day, Mr. Dunn is gone. Mr. Cooke insists on taking the Celebrity to Canada.\nA police tug boat catches up to the Maria and the Celebrity is hidden in the ballast area. Captain McMain, Chief of the Far Harbor Police, searches the boat but does not find the Celebrity. Mr. Cooke finds a cove to sleep in for the night. In the morning, while rowing passengers back to the Maria, the police return. John Crocker, the Celebrity, Miss Thorn, and Miss Trevor are left behind on shore.\nThe Celebrity asks Miss Thorn to marry him. She tells Miss Trevor about the proposal. She states that she is still engaged to the Celebrity. Now, John Crocker realizes that the girls where in on a plot to humiliate the Celebrity for going against his own doctrine from his stories. After being humiliated, he leaves the three and escapes into Canada. The police come back and pick up John, Miss Thorn, and Miss Trevor in the police tug that is towing the Maria. During the trip back, Captain McCann says he is still looking for the embezzler, Mr. Allen. Miss Thorn reveals to John Crocker that she has secretly admired him ever since they met. They realize they are going to become romantically involved in the future. When they reach shore, it is revealed that Mr. Dunn, the suspected detective turns out to be Mr. Allen.\nThe story is wrapped up with the marriage of John Crocker and Irene Thorn. They go to Europe and, at a party, a book the Celebrity wrote is brought up. It is signed by the author. After inspection, Crocker realizes the signature is a fraud. He realizes Mr. Allen is posing as the Celebrity and traveling through Europe on a book signing tour.\nLater, during their stay in Paris, the Crockers meet the Celebrity. He has a new girl, has no hard feeling about his summer stay at Asquith and Mohair, has traveled around the World and met Charles Wexell Allen in his travels. He reveals that Mr. Allen thanked him for inadvertently helping him in the embezzlement.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Celebrity, Complete, by Winston Churchill\n[Author is the American Winston Churchill not the British]\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

But I see I shall have to amend that, because he was not a\ncelebrity then, nor, indeed, did he achieve fame until some time after\nI had left New York for the West. In the old days, to my commonplace and\nunobserving mind, he gave no evidences of genius whatsoever. He never\nread me any of his manuscripts, which I can safely say he would have\ndone had he written any at that time, and therefore my lack of detection\nof his promise may in some degree be pardoned. But he had then none of\nthe oddities and mannerisms which I hold to be inseparable from genius,\nand which struck my attention in after days when I came in contact\nwith the Celebrity. Hence I am constrained to the belief that his\neccentricity must have arrived with his genius, and both after the age\nof twenty-five. Far be it from me to question the talents of one upon\nwhose head has been set the laurel of fame!\n\nWhen I knew him he was a young man without frills or foibles, with an\nexcellent head for business. He was starting in to practise law in\na downtown office with the intention of becoming a great corporation\nlawyer. He used to drop into my chambers once in a while to smoke, and\nwas first-rate company. When I gave a dinner there was generally a cover\nlaid for him. I liked the man for his own sake, and even had he promised\nto turn out a celebrity it would have had no weight with me. I look\nupon notoriety with the same indifference as on the buttons on a man's\nshirt-front, or the crest on his note-paper.\n\nWhen I went West, he fell out of my life. I probably should not have\ngiven him another thought had I not caught sight of his name, in old\ncapitals, on a daintily covered volume in a book-stand. I had little\ntime or inclination for reading fiction; my days were busy ones, and\nmy nights were spent with law books. But I bought the volume out of\ncuriosity, wondering the while whether he could have written it. I was\nsoon set at rest, for the dedication was to a young woman of whom I had\noften heard him speak. The volume was a collection of short stories.\nOn these I did not feel myself competent to sit in judgment, for my\npersonal taste in fiction, if I could be said to have had any, took\nanother turn. The stories dealt mainly with the affairs of aristocratic\nyoung men and aristocratic young women, and were differentiated to fit\nsituations only met with in that society which does not have to send\ndescriptions of its functions to the newspapers. The stories did not\nseem to me to touch life. They were plainly intended to have a bracing\nmoral effect, and perhaps had this result for the people at whom\nthey were aimed. They left with me the impression of a well-delivered\nstereopticon lecture, with characters about as life-like as the shadows\non the screen, and whisking on and off, at the mercy of the operator.\nTheir charm to me lay in the manner of the telling, the style, which I\nam forced to admit was delightful.\n\nBut the book I had bought was a success, a great success, if the\nnewspapers and the reports of the sales were to be trusted. I read the\ncriticisms out of curiosity more than any other prompting, and no two of\nthem were alike: they veered from extreme negative to extreme positive.\nI have to confess that it gratified me not a little to find the\nnegatives for the most part of my poor way of thinking. The positives,\non the other hand, declared the gifted young author to have found a\nmanner of treatment of social life entirely new. Other critics still\ninsisted it was social ridicule: but if this were so, the satire was too\ndelicate for ordinary detection.\n\nHowever, with the dainty volume my quondam friend sprang into fame. At\nthe same time he cast off the chrysalis of a commonplace existence. He\nat once became the hero of the young women of the country from Portland,\nMaine, to Portland, Oregon, many of whom wrote him letters and asked\nhim for his photograph. He was asked to tell what he really meant by\nthe vague endings of this or that story. And then I began to hear rumors\nthat his head was turning. These I discredited, of course. If true, I\nthought it but another proof of the undermining influence of feminine\nflattery, which few men, and fewer young men, can stand. But I watched\nhis career with interest.\n\nHe published other books, of a high moral tone and unapproachable\nprinciple, which I read carefully for some ray of human weakness,\nfor some stroke of nature untrammelled by the calling code of polite\nsociety. But in vain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIt was by a mere accident that I went West, some years ago, and settled\nin an active and thriving town near one of the Great Lakes. The air and\nbustle and smack of life about the place attracted me, and I rented an\noffice and continued to read law, from force of habit, I suppose. My\nexperience in the service of one of the most prominent of New York\nlawyers stood me in good stead, and gradually, in addition to a\nheterogeneous business of mines and lumber, I began to pick up a few\nclients. But in all probability I should be still pegging away at mines\nand lumber, and drawing up occasional leases and contracts, had it not\nbeen for Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke, of Philadelphia. Although it has\nbeen specifically written that promotion to a young man comes neither\nfrom the East nor the West, nor yet from the South, Mr. Cooke arrived\nfrom the East, and in the nick of time for me.\n\nI was indebted to Farrar for Mr. Cooke's acquaintance, and this\nobligation I have since in vain endeavored to repay. Farrar's profession\nwas forestry: a graduate of an eastern college, he had gone abroad to\nstudy, and had roughed it with the skilled woodsmen of the Black Forest.\nMr. Cooke, whom he represented, had large tracts of land in these parts,\nand Farrar likewise received an income from the state, whose legislature\nhad at last opened its eyes to the timber depredations and had begun to\nbuy up reserves. We had rooms in the same Elizabethan building at the\ncorner of Main and Superior streets, but it was more than a year\nbefore I got farther than a nod with him. Farrar's nod in itself was\na repulsion, and once you had seen it you mentally scored him from\nthe list of your possible friends. Besides this freezing exterior he\npossessed a cutting and cynical tongue, and had but little confidence in\nthe human race. These qualities did not tend to render him popular in a\nWestern town, if indeed they would have recommended him anywhere, and\nI confess to have thought him a surly enough fellow, being guided by\ngeneral opinion and superficial observation. Afterwards the town got to\nknow him, and if it did not precisely like him, it respected him, which\nperhaps is better. And he gained at least a few warm-friends, among whom\nI deem it an honor to be mentioned.\n\nFarrar's contempt for consequences finally brought him an unsought-for\nreputation. Admiration for him was born the day he pushed O'Meara out\nof his office and down a flight of stairs because he had undertaken to\nsuggest that which should be done with the timber in Jackson County. By\nthis summary proceeding Farrar lost the support of a faction, O'Meara\nbeing a power in the state and chairman of the forestry board besides.\nBut he got rid of interference from that day forth.\n\nOddly enough my friendship with Farrar was an indirect result of the\nincident I have just related. A few mornings after, I was seated in my\noffice trying to concentrate my mind on page twenty of volume ten of\nthe Records when I was surprised by O'Meara himself, accompanied by\ntwo gentlemen whom I remembered to have seen on various witness stands.\nO'Meara was handsomely dressed, and his necktie made but a faint\npretence of concealing the gorgeous diamond in his shirt-front. But his\nface wore an aggrieved air, and his left hand was neatly bound in black\nand tucked into his coat. He sank comfortably into my wicker chair,\nwhich creaked a protest, and produced two yellow-spotted cigars, chewing\nthe end of one with much apparent relish and pushing the other at me.\nHis two friends remained respectfully standing. I guessed at what was\ncoming, and braced myself by refusing the cigar,--not a great piece of\nself-denial, by the way. But a case meant much to me then, and I did\nseriously regret that O'Meara was not a possible client. At any rate, my\nsympathy with Farrar in the late episode put him out of the question.\n\nO'Meara cleared his throat and began gingerly to undo the handkerchief\non his hand. Then he brought his fist down on the table so that the ink\nstarted from the stand and his cheeks shook with the effort.\n\n\"I'll make him pay for this!\" he shouted, with an oath.\n\nThe other gentlemen nodded their approval, while I put the inkstand in a\nplace of safety.\n\n\"You're a pretty bright young man, Mr. Crocker,\" he went on, a look of\ncunning coming into his little eyes, \"but I guess you ain't had too many\ncases to object to a big one.\"\n\n\"Did you come here to tell me that?\" I asked.\n\nHe looked me over queerly, and evidently decided that I meant no\neffrontery.\n\n\"I came here to get your opinion,\" he said, holding up a swollen hand,\n\"but I want to tell you first that I ought to get ten thousand, not a\ncent less. That scoundrelly young upstart--\"\n\n\"If you want my opinion,\" I replied, trying to speak slowly, \"it is that\nMr. Farrar ought to get ten thousand dollars. And I think that would be\nonly a moderate reward.\"\n\nI did not feel equal to pushing him into the street, as Farrar had done,\nand I have now but a vague notion of what he said and how he got there.\nBut I remember that half an hour afterwards a man congratulated me\nopenly in the bank.\n\nThat night I found a new friend, although at the time I thought Farrar's\nvisit to me the accomplishment of a perfunctory courtesy to a man who\nhad refused to take a case against him. It was very characteristic of\nFarrar not to mention this until he rose to go. About half-past eight\nhe sauntered in upon me, placing his hat precisely on the rack, and we\ntalked until ten, which is to say that I talked and he commented. His\nobservations were apt, if a trifle caustic, and it is needless to add\nthat I found them entertaining. As he was leaving he held out his hand.\n\n\"I hear that O'Meara called on you to-day,\" he said diffidently.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, smiling, \"I was sorry not to have been able to take\nhis case.\"\n\nI sat up for an hour or more, trying to arrive at some conclusion\nabout Farrar, but at length I gave it up. His visit had in it something\nimpulsive which I could not reconcile with his manner. He surely owed\nme nothing for refusing a case against him, and must have known that my\nmotives for so doing were not personal. But if I did not understand\nhim, I liked him decidedly from that night forward, and I hoped that his\nadvances had sprung from some other motive than politeness. And indeed\nwe gradually drifted into a quasi-friendship. It became his habit, as\nhe went out in the morning, to drop into my room for a match, and I\nreturned the compliment by borrowing his coal oil when mine was out.\nAt such times we would sit, or more frequently stand, discussing the\naffairs of the town and of the nation, for politics was an easy and\nattractive subject to us both. It was only in a general way that we\ntouched upon each other's concerns, this being dangerous ground\nwith Farrar, who was ever ready to close up at anything resembling a\nconfidence. As for me, I hope I am not curious, but I own to having had\na curiosity about Farrar's Philadelphia patron, to whom Farrar made\nbut slight allusions. His very name--Farquhar Fenelon Cooke--had an odd\nsound which somehow betokened an odd man, and there was more than\none bit of gossip afloat in the town of which he was the subject,\nnotwithstanding the fact that he had never honored it with a visit. The\ngossip was the natural result of Mr. Cooke's large properties in the\nvicinity. It has never been my habit, however, to press a friend on such\nmatters, and I could easily understand and respect Farrar's reluctance\nto talk of one from whom he received an income.\n\nI had occasion, in the May of that year, to make a somewhat long\nbusiness trip to Chicago, and on my return, much to my surprise, I\nfound Farrar awaiting me in the railroad station. He smiled his wonted\nfraction by way of greeting, stopped to buy a newspaper, and finally\nleading me to his buggy, turned and drove out of town. I was completely\nmystified at such an unusual proceeding.\n\n\"What's this for?\" I asked.\n\n\"I shan't bother you long,\" he said; \"I simply wanted the chance to talk\nto you before you got to your office. I have a Philadelphia client, a\nMr. Cooke, of whom you may have heard me speak. Since you have been away\nthe railroad has brought suit against him. The row is about the lands\nwest of the Washita, on Copper Rise. It's the devil if he loses, for the\nground is worth the dollar bills to cover it. I telegraphed, and he got\nhere yesterday. He wants a lawyer, and I mentioned you.\"\n\nThere came over me then in a flash a comprehension of Farrar which I had\nfailed to grasp before. But I was quite overcome at his suggestion.\n\n\"Isn't it rather a big deal to risk me on?\" I said. \"Better go to\nChicago and get Parks. He's an expert in that sort of thing.\" I am\nafraid my expostulation was weak.\n\n\"I merely spoke of you,\" replied Farrar, coolly,--\"and he has gone\naround to your office. He knows about Parks, and if he wants him he'll\nprobably take him. It all depends upon how you strike Cooke whether you\nget the case or not. I have never told you about him,\" he added with\nsome hesitation; \"he's a trifle queer, but a good fellow at the bottom.\nI should hate to see him lose his land.\"\n\n\"How is the railroad mixed up in it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know much about law, but it would seem as if they had a pretty\nstrong case,\" he answered. He went on to tell me what he knew of the\nmatter in his clean, pithy sentences, often brutally cynical, as though\nhe had not a spark of interest in any of it. Mr. Cooke's claim to the\nland came from a maternal great-uncle, long since deceased, who had been\na settler in these regions. The railroad answered that they had bought\nthe land with other properties from the man, also deceased, to whom\nthe old gentleman was alleged to have sold it. Incidentally I learned\nsomething of Mr. Cooke's maternal ancestry.\n\nWe drove back to the office with some concern on my part at the prospect\nof so large a case. Sunning himself on the board steps, I saw for the\nfirst time Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke. He was dressed out in broad\ngaiters and bright tweeds, like an English tourist, and his face might\nhave belonged to Dagon, idol of the Philistines. A silver snaffle on a\nheavy leather watch guard which connected the pockets of his corduroy\nwaistcoat, together with a huge gold stirrup in his Ascot tie,\nsufficiently proclaimed his tastes. But I found myself continually\nreturning to the countenance, and I still think I could have modelled a\nbetter face out of putty. The mouth was rather small, thick-tipped, and\nput in at an odd angle; the brown eyes were large, and from their habit\nof looking up at one lent to the round face an incongruous solemnity.\nBut withal there was a perceptible acumen about the man which was\npuzzling in the extreme.\n\n\"How are you, old man?\" said he, hardly waiting for Farrar to introduce\nme. \"Well, I hope.\" It was pure cordiality, nothing more. He seemed to\nbubble over with it.\n\nI said I was well, and invited him inside.\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"I like the look of the town. We can talk business here.\"\n\nAnd talk business he did, straight and to the point, so fast and\nindistinctly that at times I could scarcely follow him. I answered his\nrapid questions briefly, and as best I knew how. He wanted to know\nwhat chance he had to win the suit, and I told him there might be other\nfactors involved beside those of which he had spoken. Plainly, also,\nthat the character of his great-uncle was in question, an intimation\nwhich he did not appear to resent. But that there was no denying the\nfact that the railroad had a strong thing of it, and a good lawyer into\nthe bargain.\n\n\"And don't you consider yourself a good lawyer?\" he cut in.\n\nI pointed out that the railroad lawyer was a man of twice my age,\nexperience, and reputation.\n\nWithout more ado, and before either Farrar or myself had time to resist,\nhe had hooked an arm into each of us, and we were all three marching\ndown the street in the direction of his hotel. If this was agony for\nme, I could see that it was keener agony for Farrar. And although Mr.\nFarquhar Fenelon Cooke had been in town but a scant twenty-four hours,\nit seemed as if he knew more of its inhabitants than both of us\nput together. Certain it is that he was less particular with his\nacquaintances. He hailed the most astonishing people with an easy air\nof freedom, now releasing my arm, now Farrar's, to salute. He always\nsaluted. He stopped to converse with a dozen men we had never seen, many\nof whom smelled strongly of the stable, and he invariably introduced\nFarrar as the forester of his estate, and me as his lawyer in the great\nquarrel with the railroad, until I began to wish I had never heard of\nBlackstone. And finally he steered us into the spacious bar of the Lake\nHouse.\n\nThe next morning the three of us were off early for a look at the\ncontested property. It was a twenty-mile drive, and the last eight miles\nwound down the boiling Washita, still high with the melting snows of\nthe pine lands. And even here the snows yet slept in the deeper hollows.\nunconscious of the budding green of the slopes. How heartily I wished\nMr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke back in Philadelphia! By his eternal accounts\nof his Germantown stables and of the blue ribbons of his hackneys he\nkilled all sense of pleasure of the scene, and set up an irritation that\nwas well-nigh unbearable. At length we crossed the river, climbed the\nfoot-hills, and paused on the ridge. Below us lay the quaint inn\nand scattered cottages of Asquith, and beyond them the limitless and\nfoam-flecked expanse of lake: and on our right, lifting from the shore\nby easy slopes for a mile at stretch, Farrar pointed out the timbered\nlands of Copper Rise, spread before us like a map. But the appreciation\nof beauty formed no part of Mr. Cooke's composition,--that is, beauty as\nFarrar and I knew it.\n\n\"If you win that case, old man,\" he cried, striking me a great whack\nbetween the shoulder-blades, \"charge any fee you like; I'll pay it! And\nI'll make such a country-place out of this as was never seen west of New\nYork state, and call it Mohair, after my old trotter. I'll put a palace\non that clearing, with the stables just over the knoll. They'll beat the\nGermantown stables a whole lap. And that strip of level,\" he continued,\npointing to a thinly timbered bit, \"will hold a mile track nicely.\"\n\nFarrar and I gasped: it was as if we had tumbled into the Washita.\n\n\"It will take money, Mr. Cooke,\" said Farrar, \"and you haven't won the\nsuit yet.\"\n\n\"Damn the money!\" said Mr. Cooke, and we knew he meant it.\n\nOver the episodes of that interminable morning it will, be better to\npass lightly. It was spent by Farrar and me in misery. It was spent by\nMr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke in an ecstasy of enjoyment, driving over and\nlaying out Mohair, and I must admit he evinced a surprising genius\nin his planning, although, according to Farrar, he broke every sacred\nprecept of landscape gardening again and again. He displayed the\nenthusiasm of a pioneer, and the energy of a Napoleon. And if he were\ntoo ignorant to accord to nature a word of praise, he had the grace\nand intelligence to compliment Farrar on the superb condition of the\nforests, and on the judgment shown in laying out the roads, which were\nso well chosen that even in this season they were well drained and dry.\nThat day, too, my views were materially broadened, and I received an\ninsight into the methods and possibilities of my friend's profession\nsufficient to instil a deeper respect both for it and for him. The\ncrowded spots had been skilfully thinned of the older trees to give the\nyounger ones a chance, and the harmony of the whole had been carefully\nworked out. Now we drove under dark pines and hemlocks, and then into\na lighter relief of birches and wild cherries, or a copse of young\nbeeches. And I learned that the estate had not only been paying the\ntaxes and its portion of Farrar's salary, but also a considerable amount\ninto Mr. Cooke's pocket the while it was being improved.\n\nMr. Cooke made his permanent quarters at the Lake House, and soon became\none of the best-known characters about town. He seemed to enjoy his\npopularity, and I am convinced that he would have been popular in\nspite of his now-famous quarrel with the railroad. His easy command\nof profanity, his generous use of money, his predilection for sporting\ncharacters, of whom he was king; his ready geniality and good-fellowship\nalike with the clerk of the Lake House or the Mayor, not to mention his\nown undeniable personality, all combined to make him a favorite. He had\nhis own especial table in the dining-room, called all the waiters by\ntheir first names, and they fought for the privilege of attending him.\nHe likewise called the barkeepers by their first names, and had his own\nparticular corner of the bar, where none dared intrude, and where he\ncould almost invariably be found when not in my office. From this corner\nhe dealt out cigars to the deserving, held stake moneys, decided all\nbets, and refereed all differences. His name appeared in the personal\ncolumn of one of the local papers on the average of twice a week, or\nin lieu thereof one of his choicest stories in the \"Notes about Town\"\ncolumn.\n\nThe case was to come up early in July, and I spent most of my time,\nto the detriment of other affairs, in preparing for it. I was greatly\nhampered in my work by my client, who filled my office with his\ntobacco-smoke and that of his friends, and he took it very much for\ngranted that he was going to win the suit. Fortune had always played\ninto his hands, he said, and I had no little difficulty in convincing\nhim that matters had passed from his hands into mine. In this I believe\nI was never entirely successful. I soon found, too, that he had no ideas\nwhatever on the value of discretion, and it was only by repeated threats\nof absolute failure that I prevented our secret tactics from becoming\nthe property of his sporting fraternity and of the town.\n\nThe more I worked on the case, the clearer it became to me that Mr.\nFarquhar Fenelon Cooke's great-uncle had been either a consummate\nscoundrel or a lunatic, and that our only hope of winning must be based\non proving him one or the other; it did not matter much which, for my\nexpectations at best were small. When I had at length settled to this\nconclusion I confided it as delicately as possible to my client, who was\nsitting at the time with his feet cocked up on the office table, reading\na pink newspaper.\n\n\"Which'll be the easier to prove?\" he asked, without looking up.\n\n\"It would be more charitable to prove he had been out of his mind,\" I\nreplied, \"and perhaps easier.\"\n\n\"Charity be damned,\" said this remarkable man. \"I'm after the property.\"\n\nSo I decided on insanity. I hunted up and subpoenaed white-haired\nwitnesses for miles around. Many of them shook their heads when they\nspoke of Mr. Cooke's great-uncle, and some knew more of his private\ntransactions than I could have wished, and I trembled lest my own\nwitnesses should be turned against me. I learned more of Mr. Cooke's\ngreat-uncle than I knew of Mr. Cooke himself, and to the credit of my\nclient be it said that none of his relative's traits were apparent in\nhim, with the possible exception of insanity; and that defect, if it\nexisted in the grand-nephew, took in him a milder and less criminal\nturn. The old rascal, indeed, had so cleverly worded his deed of sale\nas to obtain payment without transfer. It was a trifle easier to avoid\nbeing specific in that country in his day than it is now, and the\ndocument was, in my opinion, sufficiently vague to admit of a double\nmeaning. The original sale had been made to a man, now dead, whom the\nrailroad had bought out. The Copper Rise property was mentioned among\nthe other lands in the will in favor of Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke, and\nthe latter had gone ahead improving them and increasing their output in\nspite of the repeated threats of the railroad to bring suit. And it was\nnot until its present attorney had come in and investigated the title\nthat the railroad had resorted to the law. I mention here, by the way,\nthat my client was the sole heir.\n\nBut as the time of the sessions drew near, the outlook for me was\nanything but bright. It is true that my witnesses were quite willing\nto depose that his actions were queer and out of the common, but these\nwitnesses were for the most part venerable farmers and backwoodsmen:\nexpert testimony was deplorably lacking. In this extremity it was Mr.\nFarquhar Fenelon Cooke himself who came unwittingly to my rescue. He had\nbought a horse,--he could never be in a place long without one,--which\nwas chiefly remarkable, he said, for picking up his hind feet as well\nas his front ones. However he may have differed from the ordinary run\nof horses, he was shortly attacked by one of the thousand ills to which\nevery horse is subject. I will not pretend to say what it was. I found\nMr. Cooke one morning at his usual place in the Lake House bar holding\nforth with more than common vehemence and profanity on the subject of\nveterinary surgeons. He declared there was not a veterinary surgeon in\nthe whole town fit to hold a certificate, and his listeners nodded an\nextreme approval to this sentiment. A grizzled old fellow who kept a\nstock farm back in the country chanced to be there, and managed to get a\nword in on the subject during one of my client's rare pauses.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that's so. There ain't one of 'em now fit to travel\nwith young Doctor Vane, who was here some fifteen years gone by. He\nweren't no horse-doctor, but he could fix up a foundered horse in a\nnight as good as new. If your uncle was livin', he'd back me on that,\nMr. Cooke.\"\n\nHere was my chance. I took the old man aside, and two or three glasses\nof Old Crow launched him into reminiscence.\n\n\"Where is Doctor Vane now?\" I asked finally.\n\n\"Over to Minneapolis, sir, with more rich patients nor he can take care\nof. Wasn't my darter over there last month, and seen him? And demned if\nhe didn't pull up his carriage and talk to her. Here's luck to him.\"\n\nI might have heard much more of the stockraiser had I stayed, but I fear\nI left him somewhat abruptly in my haste to find Farrar. Only three days\nremained before the case was to come up. Farrar readily agreed to go to\nMinneapolis, and was off on the first train that afternoon. I would have\nasked Mr. Cooke to go had I dared trust him, such was my anxiety to have\nhim out of the way, if only for a time. I did not tell him about the\ndoctor. He sat up very late with me that night on the Lake House\nporch to give me a rubbing down, as he expressed it, as he might have\nadmonished some favorite jockey before a sweepstake. \"Take it easy, old\nman,\" he would say repeatedly, \"and don't give things the bit before\nyou're sure of their wind!\"\n\nDays passed, and not a word from Farrar. The case opened with Mr.\nCooke's friends on the front benches. The excitement it caused has\nrarely been equalled in that section, but I believe this was due less to\nits sensational features than to Mr. Cooke, who had an abnormal though\nunconscious talent for self-advertisement. It became manifest early that\nwe were losing. Our testimony, as I had feared, was not strong enough,\nalthough they said we were making a good fight of it. I was racked\nwith anxiety about Farrar; at last, when I had all but given up hope,\nI received a telegram from him dated at Detroit, saying he would arrive\nwith the doctor that evening. This was Friday, the fourth day of the\ntrial.\n\nThe doctor turned out to be a large man, well groomed and well fed, with\na twinkle in his eye. He had gone to Narragansett Pier for the summer,\nwhither Farrar had followed him. On being introduced, Mr. Cooke at once\ninvited him out to have a drink.\n\n\"Did you know my uncle?\" asked my client.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"I should say I did.\"\n\n\"Poor old duffer,\" said Mr. Cooke, with due solemnity; \"I understand he\nwas a maniac.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, while we listened with a breathless interest,\n\"he wasn't exactly a maniac, but I think I can safely say he was a\nlunatic.\"\n\n\"Then here's to insanity!\" said the irrepressible, his glass swung in\nmid-air, when a thought struck him, and he put it down again and looked\nhard at the doctor.\n\n\"Will you swear to it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I would swear to it before Saint Peter,\" said the doctor, fervently.\n\nHe swore to it before a jury, which was more to the point, and we won\nour case. It did not even go to the court of appeals; I suppose the\nrailroad thought it cheaper to drop it, since no right of way was\ninvolved. And the decision was scarcely announced before Mr. Farquhar\nFenelon Cooke had begun work on his new country place, Mohair.\n\nI have oftentimes been led to consider the relevancy of this chapter,\nand have finally decided to insert it. I concluded that the actual\nnarrative of how Mr. Cooke came to establish his country-place near\nAsquith would be interesting, and likewise throw some light on that\ngentleman's character. And I ask the reader's forbearance for the\nnecessary personal history involved. Had it not been for Mr. Cooke's\nfriendship for me I should not have written these pages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nEvents, are consequential or inconsequential irrespective of their size.\nThe wars of Troy were fought for a woman, and Charles VIII, of France,\nbumped his head against a stone doorway and died because he did not\nstoop low enough. And to descend from history down to my own poor\nchronicle, Mr. Cooke's railroad case, my first experience at the bar of\nany gravity or magnitude, had tied to it a string of consequences then\nfar beyond my guessing. The suit was my stepping-stone not only to\na larger and more remunerative practice, but also, I believe, to the\nposition of district attorney, which I attained shortly afterwards.\n\nMr. Cooke had laid out Mohair as ruthlessly as Napoleon planned the\nnew Paris; though not, I regret to say, with a like genius. Fortunately\nFarrar interposed and saved the grounds, but there was no guardian angel\nto do a like turn for the house. Mr. Langdon Willis, of Philadelphia,\nwas the architect who had nominal charge of the building. He had\nregularly submitted some dozen plans for Mr. Cooke's approval, which\nwere as regularly rejected. My client believed, in common with a great\nmany other people, that architects should be driven and not followed,\nand was plainly resolved to make this house the logical development of\nmany cherished ideas. It is not strange, therefore, that the edifice\nwas completed by a Chicago contractor who had less self-respect than Mr.\nWillis, the latter having abruptly refused to have his name tacked on to\nthe work.\n\nMohair was finished and ready for occupation in July, two years after\nthe suit. I drove out one day before Mr. Cooke's arrival to look it\nover. The grounds, where Farrar had had matters pretty much his own way,\nto my mind rivalled the best private parks in the East. The stables were\nfilled with a score or so of Mr. Cooke's best horses, brought hither\nin his private cars, and the trotters were exercising on the track.\nThe middle of June found Farrar and myself at the Asquith Inn. It was\nFarrar's custom to go to Asquith in the summer, being near the forest\nproperties in his charge; and since Asquith was but five miles from the\ncounty-seat it was convenient for me, and gave me the advantages of\nthe lake breezes and a comparative rest, which I should not have had\nin town. At that time Asquith was a small community of summer residents\nfrom Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, and other western cities, most of\nwhom owned cottages and the grounds around them. They were a quiet lot\nthat long association had made clannish; and they had a happy faculty,\nso rare in summer resorts, of discrimination between an amusement and a\nnuisance. Hence a great many diversions which are accounted pleasurable\nelsewhere are at Asquith set down at their true value. It was,\ntherefore, rather with resentment than otherwise that the approaching\narrival of Mr. Cooke and the guests he was likely to have at Mohair were\nlooked upon.\n\nI had not been long at Asquith before I discovered that Farrar was\nacting in a peculiar manner, though I was longer in finding out what the\nmatter was. I saw much less of him than in town. Once in a while in the\nevenings, after ten, he would run across me on the porch of the inn,\nor drift into my rooms. Even after three years of more or less\nintimacy between us, Farrar still wore his exterior of pessimism and\nindifference, the shell with which he chose to hide a naturally warm and\naffectionate disposition. In the dining-room we sat together at the end\nof a large table set aside for bachelors and small families of two\nor three, and it seemed as though we had all the humorists and\nstory-tellers in that place. And Farrar as a source of amusement proved\nequal to the best of them. He would wait until a story was well under\nway, and then annihilate the point of it with a cutting cynicism and set\nthe table in a roar of laughter. Among others who were seated here was\na Mr. Trevor, of Cincinnati, one of the pioneers of Asquith. Mr. Trevor\nwas a trifle bombastic, with a tendency towards gesticulation, an art\nwhich he had learned in no less a school than the Ohio State Senate. He\nwas a self-made man,--a fact which he took good care should not escape\none,--and had amassed his money, I believe, in the dry-goods business.\nHe always wore a long, shiny coat, a low, turned-down collar, and a\nblack tie, all of which united to give him the general appearance of a\nprofessional pallbearer.\n\nBut Mr. Trevor possessed a daughter who amply made up for his\nshortcomings. She was the only one who could meet Farrar on his own\nground, and rarely a meal passed that they did not have a tilt. They\nfilled up the holes of the conversation with running commentaries,\ngiving a dig at the luckless narrator and a side-slap at each other,\nuntil one would have given his oath they were sworn enemies. At least\nI, in the innocence of my heart, thought so until I was forcibly\nenlightened. I had taken rather a prejudice to Miss Trevor. I could find\nno better reason than her antagonism to Farrar. I was revolving this\nvery thing in my mind one day as I was paddling back to the inn after a\nlook at my client's new pier and boat-houses, when I descried Farrar's\ncatboat some distance out. The lake was glass, and the sail hung\nlifeless. It was near lunch-time, and charity prompted me to head for\nthe boat and give it a tow homeward. As I drew near, Farrar himself\nemerged from behind the sail and asked me, with a great show of\nnonchalance, what I wanted.\n\n\"To tow you back for lunch, of course,\" I answered, used to his ways.\n\nHe threw me a line, which I made fast to the stern, and then he\ndisappeared again. I thought this somewhat strange, but as the boat\nwas a light one, I towed it in and hitched it to the wharf, when, to my\ngreat astonishment, there disembarked not Farrar, but Miss Trevor. She\nleaped lightly ashore and was gone before I could catch my breath, while\nFarrar let down the sail and offered me a cigarette. I had learned a\nlesson in appearances.\n\nIt could not have been very long after this that I was looking over my\nbatch of New York papers, which arrived weekly, when my eye was arrested\nby a name. I read the paragraph, which announced the fact that my friend\nthe Celebrity was about to sail for Europe in search of \"color\" for his\nnext novel; this was already contracted for at a large price, and was\nto be of a more serious nature than any of his former work. An interview\nwas published in which the Celebrity had declared that a new novel was\nto appear in a short time. I do not know what impelled me, but I began\nat once to search through the other papers, and found almost identically\nthe same notice in all of them.\n\nBy one of those odd coincidents which sometimes start one to thinking,\nthe Celebrity was the subject of a lively discussion when I reached\nthe table that evening. I had my quota of information concerning his\nEuropean trip, but I did not commit myself when appealed to for an\nopinion. I had once known the man (which, however, I did not think it\nworth while to mention) and I did not feel justified in criticising him\nin public. Besides, what I knew of him was excellent, and entirely apart\nfrom the literary merit or demerit of his work. The others, however,\nwere within their right when they censured or praised him, and they\ndid both. Farrar, in particular, surprised me by the violence of his\nattacks, while Miss Trevor took up the Celebrity's defence with equal\nardor. Her motives were beyond me now. The Celebrity's works spoke\nfor themselves, she said, and she could not and would not believe such\ninjurious reports of one who wrote as he did.\n\nThe next day I went over to the county-seat, and got back to Asquith\nafter dark. I dined alone, and afterwards I was strolling up and down\none end of the long veranda when I caught sight of a lonely figure in a\ncorner, with chair tilted back and feet on the rail. A gleam of a cigar\nlighted up the face, and I saw that it was Farrar. I sat down beside\nhim, and we talked commonplaces for a while, Farrar's being almost\nmonosyllabic, while now and again feminine voices and feminine laughter\nreached our ears from the far end of the porch. They seemed to go\nthrough Farrar like a knife, and he smoked furiously, his lips tightly\ncompressed the while. I had a dozen conjectures, none of which I dared\nvoice. So I waited in patience.\n\n\"Crocker,\" said he, at length, \"there's a man here from Boston, Charles\nWrexell Allen; came this morning. You know Boston. Have you ever heard\nof him?\"\n\n\"Allen,\" I repeated, reflecting; \"no Charles Wrexell.\"\n\n\"It is Charles Wrexell, I think,\" said Farrar, as though the matter were\ntrivial. \"However, we can go into the register and make sure.\"\n\n\"What about him?\" I asked, not feeling inclined to stir.\n\nThe Celebrity\n\n\"Oh, nothing. An arrival is rather an occurrence, though. You can hear\nhim down there now,\" he added, tossing his head towards the other end of\nthe porch, \"with the women around him.\"\n\nIn fact, I did catch the deeper sound of a man's voice among the lighter\ntones, and the voice had a ring to it which was not wholly unfamiliar,\nalthough I could not place it.\n\nI threw Farrar a bait.\n\n\"He must make friends easily,\" I said.\n\n\"With the women?--yes,\" he replied, so scathingly that I was forced to\nlaugh in spite of myself.\n\n\"Let us go in and look at the register,\" I suggested. \"You may have his\nname wrong.\"\n\nWe went in accordingly. Sure enough, in bold, heavy characters, was the\nname Charles Wrexell Allen written out in full. That handwriting was one\nin a thousand. I made sure I had seen it before, and yet I did not know\nit; and the more I puzzled over it the more confused I became. I turned\nto Farrar.\n\n\"I have had a poor cigar passed off on me and deceive me for a while.\nThat is precisely the case here. I think I should recognize your man if\nI were to see him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Farrar, \"here's your chance.\"\n\nThe company outside were moving in. Two or three of the older ladies\ncame first, carrying their wraps; then a troop of girls, among whom\nwas Miss Trevor; and lastly, a man. Farrar and I had walked to the door\nwhile the women turned into the drawing-room, so that we were brought\nface to face with him, suddenly. At sight of me he halted abruptly, as\nthough he had struck the edge of a door, changed color, and held out\nhis hand, tentatively. Then he withdrew it again, for I made no sign of\nrecognition.\n\nIt was the Celebrity!\n\nI felt a shock of disgust as I passed out. Masquerading, it must be\nadmitted, is not pleasant to the taste; and the whole farce, as it\nflashed through my mind,--his advertised trip, his turning up here under\nan assumed name, had an ill savor. Perhaps some of the things they said\nof him might be true, after all.\n\n\"Who the devil is he?\" said Farrar, dropping for once his indifference;\n\"he looked as if he knew you.\"\n\nI evaded.\n\n\"He may have taken me for some one else,\" I answered with all the\ncoolness I could muster. \"I have never met any one of his name. His\nvoice and handwriting, however, are very much like those of a man I used\nto know.\"\n\nFarrar was very poor company that evening, and left me early. I went\nto my rooms and had taken down a volume of Carlyle, who can generally\ncommand my attention, when there came a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" I replied, with an instinctive sense of prophecy.\n\nThis was fulfilled at once by the appearance of the Celebrity. He\nwas attired--for the details of his dress forced themselves upon me\nvividly--in a rough-spun suit of knickerbockers, a colored-shirt having\na large and prominent gold stud, red and brown stockings of a diamond\npattern, and heavy walking-boots. And he entered with an air of\nassurance that was maddening.\n\n\"My dear Crocker,\" he exclaimed, \"you have no idea how delighted I am to\nsee you here!\"\n\nI rose, first placing a book-mark in Carlyle, and assured him that I was\nsurprised to see him here.\n\n\"Surprised to see me!\" he returned, far from being damped by my manner.\n\"In fact, I am a little surprised to see myself here.\"\n\nHe sank back on the window-seat and clasped his hands behind his head.\n\n\"But first let me thank you for respecting my incognito,\" he said.\n\nI tried hard to keep my temper, marvelling at the ready way he had\nchosen to turn my action.\n\n\"And now,\" he continued, \"I suppose you want to know why I came out\nhere.\" He easily supplied the lack of cordial solicitation on my part.\n\n\"Yes, I should like to know,\" I said.\n\nThus having aroused my curiosity, he took his time about appeasing it,\nafter the custom of his kind. He produced a gold cigarette case, offered\nme a cigarette, which I refused, took one himself and blew the smoke in\nrings toward the ceiling. Then, raising himself on his elbow, he drew\nhis features together in such a way as to lead me to believe he was\nabout to impart some valuable information.\n\n\"Crocker,\" said he, \"it's the very deuce to be famous, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is,\" I replied curtly, wondering what he was driving at;\n\"I have never tried it.\"\n\n\"An ordinary man, such as you, can't conceive of the torture a fellow in\nmy position is obliged to go through the year round, but especially in\nthe summer, when one wishes to go off on a rest. You know what I mean,\nof course.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I do not,\" I answered, in a vain endeavor to embarrass him.\n\n\"You're thicker than when I used to know you, then,\" he returned with\ncandor. \"To tell the truth, Crocker, I often wish I were back at the\nlaw, and had never written a line. I am paying the penalty of fame.\nWherever I go I am hounded to death by the people who have read my\nbooks, and they want to dine and wine me for the sake of showing me off\nat their houses. I am heartily sick and tired of it all; you would be if\nyou had to go through it. I could stand a winter, but the worst comes\nin the summer, when one meets the women who fire all sorts of\nsocio-psychological questions at one for solution, and who have\nsuggestions for stories.\" He shuddered.\n\n\"And what has all this to do with your coming here?\" I cut in,\nstrangling a smile.\n\nHe twisted his cigarette at an acute angle with his face, and looked at\nme out of the corner of his eye.\n\n\"I'll try to be a little plainer,\" he went on, sighing as one unused to\ndeal with people who require crosses on their t's. \"I've been worried\nalmost out of my mind with attention--nothing but attention the whole\ntime. I can't go on the street but what I'm stared at and pointed out,\nso I thought of a scheme to relieve it for a time. It was becoming\nunbearable. I determined to assume a name and go to some quiet little\nplace for the summer, West, if possible, where I was not likely to be\nrecognized, and have three months of rest.\"\n\nHe paused, but I offered no comment.\n\n\"Well, the more I thought of it, the better I liked the idea. I met a\nwestern man at the club and asked him about western resorts, quiet ones.\n'Have you heard of Asquith?' says he. 'No,' said I; 'describe it.' He\ndid, and it was just the place; quaint, restful, and retired. Of course\nI put him off the track, but I did not count on striking you. My man\nboxed up, and we were off in twenty-four hours, and here I am.\"\n\nNow all this was very fine, but not at all in keeping with the\nCelebrity's character as I had come to conceive it. The idea that\nadulation ever cloyed on him was ludicrous in itself. In fact I thought\nthe whole story fishy, and came very near to saying so.\n\n\"You won't tell anyone who I am, will you?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nHe even misinterpreted my silences.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I replied. \"It is no concern of mine. You might come\nhere as Emil Zola or Ralph Waldo Emerson and it would make no difference\nto me.\"\n\nHe looked at me dubiously, even suspiciously.\n\n\"That's a good chap,\" said he, and was gone, leaving me to reflect on\nthe ways of genius.\n\nAnd the longer I reflected, the more positive I became that there\nexisted a more potent reason for the Celebrity's disguise than ennui.\nAs actions speak louder than words, so does a man's character often give\nthe lie to his tongue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA Lion in an ass's skin is still a lion in spite of his disguise.\nConversely, the same might be said of an ass in a lion's skin. The\nCelebrity ran after women with the same readiness and helplessness that\na dog will chase chickens, or that a stream will run down hill. Women\ndiffer from chickens, however, in the fact that they find pleasure in\nbeing chased by a certain kind of a man. The Celebrity was this kind\nof a man. From the moment his valet deposited his luggage in his rooms,\nCharles Wrexell Allen became the social hero of Asquith. It is by\nstraws we are enabled to tell which way the wind is blowing, and I first\nnoticed his partiality for Miss Trevor from the absence of the lively\nconflicts she was wont to have with Farrar. These ceased entirely\nafter the Celebrity's arrival. It was the latter who now commanded the\nconversation at our table.\n\nI was truly sorry for Farrar, for I knew the man, the depth of his\nnature, and the scope of the shock. He carried it off altogether too\nwell, and both the studied lightness of his actions and the increased\ncarelessness of his manner made me fear that what before was feigned,\nmight turn to a real bitterness.\n\nFor Farrar's sake, if the Celebrity had been content with women in\ngeneral, all would have been well; but he was unable to generalize, in\none sense, and to particularize, in another. And it was plain that he\nwished to monopolize Miss Trevor, while still retaining a hold upon the\nothers. For my sake, had he been content with women alone, I should have\nhad no cause to complain. But it seemed that I had an attraction for\nhim, second only to women, which I could not account for. And I began\nto be cursed with a great deal of his company. Since he was absolutely\nimpervious to hints, and would not take no for an answer, I was\nhelpless. When he had no engagement he would thrust himself on me. He\nseemed to know by intuition--for I am very sure I never told him--what\nmy amusement was to be the mornings I did not go to the county-seat, and\nhe would invariably turn up, properly equipped, as I was making my way\nwith judge Short to the tennis court, or carrying my oars to the water.\nIt was in vain that I resorted to subterfuge: that I went to bed early\nintending to be away before the Celebrity's rising hour. I found he had\nno particular rising hour. No matter how early I came down, I would find\nhim on the veranda, smoking cigarettes, or otherwise his man would be\nthere with a message to say that his master would shortly join me if I\nwould kindly wait. And at last I began to realize in my harassed soul\nthat all elusion was futile, and to take such holidays as I could get,\nwhen he was off with a girl, in a spirit of thankfulness.\n\nMuch of this persecution I might have put up with, indeed, had I not\nheard, in one way or another, that he was doing me the honor of calling\nme his intimate. This I could not stand, and I soberly resolved to\nleave Asquith and go back to town, which I should indeed have done if\ndeliverance had not arrived from an unexpected quarter.\n\nOne morning I had been driven to the precarious refuge afforded by the\nsteps of the inn, after rejecting offers from the Celebrity to join\nhim in a variety of amusements. But even here I was not free from\ninterruption, for he was seated on a horse-block below me, playing with\na fox terrier. Judge Short had gone to town, and Farrar was off for a\nthree days' cruise up the lake. I was bitterly regretting I had not gone\nwith him when the distant notes of a coach horn reached my ear, and\nI descried a four-in-hand winding its way up the inn road from the\ndirection of Mohair.\n\n\"That must be your friend Cooke,\" remarked the Celebrity, looking up.\n\nThere could be no doubt of it. With little difficulty I recognized on\nthe box the familiar figure of my first important client, and beside him\nwas a lady whom I supposed to be Mrs. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke, although\nI had had no previous knowledge that such a person existed. The horses\nwere on a brisk trot, and Mr. Cooke seemed to be getting the best out\nof them for the benefit of the sprinkling of people on the inn porch.\nIndeed, I could not but admire the dexterous turn of the wrist which\nserved Mr. Cooke to swing his leaders into the circle and up the hill,\nwhile the liveried guard leaned far out in anticipation of a stumble.\nMr. Cooke hailed me with a beaming smile and a flourish of the whip as\nhe drew up and descended from the box.\n\n\"Maria,\" he exclaimed, giving me a hearty grip, \"this is the man that\nwon Mohair. My wife, Crocker.\"\n\nI was somewhat annoyed at this effusiveness before the Celebrity, but I\nlooked up and caught Mrs. Cooke's eye. It was the calm eye of a general.\n\n\"I am glad of the opportunity to thank you, Mr. Crocker,\" she said\nsimply. And I liked her from that moment.\n\nMr. Cooke at once began a tirade against the residents of Asquith for\npermitting a sandy and generally disgraceful condition of the roads.\nSo roundly did he vituperate the inn management in particular, and with\nsuch a loud flow of words, that I trembled lest he should be heard on\nthe veranda. The Celebrity stood by the block, in an amazement which\ngave me a wicked pleasure, and it was some minutes before I had the\nchance to introduce him.\n\nMr. Cooke's idea of an introduction, however, was no mere word-formula:\nit was fraught with a deeper and a bibulous meaning. He presented the\nCelebrity to his wife, and then invited both of us to go inside with him\nby one of those neat and cordial paraphrases in which he was skilled. I\npreferred to remain with Mrs. Cooke, and it was with a gleam of hope at\na possible deliverance from my late persecution that I watched the two\ndisappear together through the hall and into the smoking-room.\n\n\"How do you like Mohair?\" I asked Mrs. Cooke.\n\n\"Do you mean the house or the park?\" she laughed; and then, seeing my\nembarrassment, she went on: \"Oh, the house is just like everything else\nFenelon meddles with. Outside it's a mixture of all the styles, and\ninside a hash of all the nationalities from Siamese to Spanish. Fenelon\nhangs the Oriental tinsels he has collected on pieces of black baronial\noak, and the coat-of-arms he had designed by our Philadelphia jewellers\nis stamped on the dining-room chairs, and even worked into the fire\nscreens.\"\n\nThere was nothing paltry in her criticism of her husband, nothing she\nwould not have said to his face. She was a woman who made you feel this,\nfor sincerity was written all over her. I could not help wondering why\nshe gave Mr. Cooke line in the matter of household decoration, unless\nit was that he considered Mohair his own, private hobby, and that she\nhumored him. Mrs. Cooke was not without tact, and I have no doubt she\nperceived my reluctance to talk about her husband and respected it.\n\n\"We drove down to bring you back to luncheon,\" she said.\n\nI thanked her and accepted. She was curious to hear about Asquith and\nits people, and I told her all I knew.\n\n\"I should like to meet some of them,\" she explained, \"for we intend\nhaving a cotillon at Mohair,--a kind of house-warming, you know. A party\nof Mr. Cooke's friends is coming out for it in his car, and he thought\nsomething of inviting the people of Asquith up for a dance.\"\n\nI had my doubts concerning the wisdom of an entertainment, the success\nof which depended on the fusion of a party of Mr. Cooke's friends and\na company from Asquith. But I held my peace. She shot a question at me\nsuddenly:\n\n\"Who is this Mr. Allen?\"\n\n\"He registers from Boston, and only came a fortnight ago,\" I replied\nvaguely.\n\n\"He doesn't look quite right; as though he had been set down on the\nwrong planet, you know,\" said Mrs. Cooke, her finger on her temple.\n\"What is he like?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I answered, at first with uncertainty, then with inspiration,\n\"he would do splendidly to lead your cotillon, if you think of having\none.\"\n\n\"So you do not dance, Mr. Crocker?\"\n\nI was somewhat set back by her perspicuity.\n\n\"No, I do not,\" said I.\n\n\"I thought not,\" she said, laughing. It must have been my expression\nwhich prompted her next remark.\n\n\"I was not making fun of you,\" she said, more soberly; \"I do not like\nMr. Allen any better than you do, and I have only seen him once.\"\n\n\"But I have not said I did not like him,\" I objected.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Mrs. Cooke, quizzically.\n\nAt that moment, to my relief, I discerned the Celebrity and Mr. Cooke in\nthe hallway.\n\n\"Here they come, now,\" she went on. \"I do wish Fenelon would keep\nhis hands off the people he meets. I can feel he is going to make an\nintimate of that man. Mark my words, Mr. Crocker.\"\n\nI not only marked them, I prayed for their fulfilment.\n\nThere was that in Mr. Cooke which, for want of a better name, I will\ncall instinct. As he came down the steps, his arm linked in that of\nthe Celebrity, his attitude towards his wife was both apologetic and\ndefiant. He had at once the air of a child caught with a forbidden\ntoy, and that of a stripling of twenty-one who flaunts a cigar in his\nfather's face.\n\n\"Maria,\" he said, \"Mr. Allen has consented to come back with us for\nlunch.\"\n\nWe drove back to Mohair, Mr. Cooke and the Celebrity on the box, Mrs.\nCooke and I behind. Except to visit the boathouses I had not been to\nMohair since the day of its completion, and now the full beauty of the\napproach struck me for the first time. We swung by the lodge, the keeper\nholding open the iron gate as we passed, and into the wide driveway,\nhewn, as it were, out of the virgin forest. The sandy soil had been\nstrengthened by a deep road-bed of clay imported from the interior,\nwhich was spread in turn with a fine gravel, which crunched under the\nheavy wheels. From the lodge to the house, a full mile, branches had\nbeen pruned to let the sunshine sift through in splotches, but the wild\nnature of the place had been skilfully retained. We curved hither and\nthither under the giant trees until suddenly, as a whip straightens in\nthe snapping, one of the ancient tribes of the forest might have sent an\narrow down the leafy gallery into the open, and at the far end we caught\nsight of the palace framed in the vista. It was a triumph for Farrar,\nand I wished that the palace had been more worthy.\n\nThe Celebrity did not stint his praises of Mohair, coming up the drive,\nbut so lavish were his comments on the house that they won for him a\nlasting place in Mr. Cooke's affections, and encouraged my client to\npull up his horses in a favorable spot, and expand on the beauties of\nthe mansion.\n\n\"Taking it altogether,\" said he, complacently, \"it is rather a neat box,\nand I let myself loose on it. I had all these ideas I gathered knocking\nabout the world, and I gave them to Willis, of Philadelphia, to put\ntogether for me. But he's honest enough not to claim the house. Take,\nfor instance, that minaret business on the west; I picked that up from\na mosque in Algiers. The oriel just this side is whole cloth from Haddon\nHall, and the galleried porch next it from a Florentine villa. The\nconical capped tower I got from a French chateau, and some of the\nfeatures on the south from a Buddhist temple in Japan. Only a little\nblending and grouping was necessary, and Willis calls himself an\narchitect, and wasn't equal to it. Now,\" he added, \"get the effect. Did\nyou ever see another house like it?\"\n\n\"Magnificent!\" exclaimed the Celebrity.\n\n\"And then,\" my client continued, warming under this generous\nappreciation, \"there's something very smart about those colors. They're\nmy racing colors. Of course the granite's a little off, but it isn't\nprominent. Willis kicked hard when it came to painting the oriel yellow,\nbut an architect always takes it for granted he knows it all, and a--\"\n\n\"Fenelon,\" said Mrs. Cooke, \"luncheon is waiting.\"\n\nMrs. Cooke dominated at luncheon and retired, and it is certain that\nboth Mr. Cooke and the Celebrity breathed more freely when she had gone.\nIf her criticisms on the exterior of the house were just, those on the\ninterior were more so. Not only did I find the coat-of-arms set forth on\nthe chairs, fire-screens, and other prominent articles, but it was even\ncut into the swinging door of the butler's pantry. The motto I am afraid\nmy client never took the trouble to have translated, and I am inclined\nto think his jewellers put up a little joke on him when they chose it.\n\"Be Sober and Boast not.\"\n\nI observed that Mrs. Cooke, when she chose, could exert the subduing\neffect on her husband of a soft pedal on a piano; and during luncheon\nshe kept, the soft pedal on. And the Celebrity, being in some degree a\nkindred spirit, was also held in check. But his wife had no sooner left\nthe room when Mr. Cooke began on the subject uppermost in his mind. I\nhad suspected that his trip to Asquith that morning was for a purpose at\nwhich Mrs. Cooke had hinted. But she, with a woman's tact, had aimed to\naccomplish by degrees that which her husband would carry by storm.\n\n\"You've been at Asquith sometime, Crocker,\" Mr. Cooke began, \"long\nenough to know the people.\"\n\n\"I know some of them,\" I said guardedly. But the rush was not to be\nstemmed.\n\n\"How many do you think you can muster for that entertainment of mine?\nFifty? I ought to have fifty, at least. Suppose you pick out fifty, and\nsend me up the names. I want good lively ones, you understand, that will\nstir things up.\"\n\n\"I am afraid there are not fifty of that kind there,\" I replied.\n\nHis face fell, but brightened again instantly. He appealed to the\nCelebrity.\n\n\"How about it, old man?\" said he.\n\nThe Celebrity answered, with becoming modesty, that the Asquithians were\nbenighted. They had never had any one to show them how to enjoy life.\nBut there was hope for them.\n\n\"That's it,\" exclaimed my client, slapping his thigh, and turning\ntriumphantly to me, he continued, \"You're all right, Crocker, and know\nenough to win a damned big suit, but you're not the man to steer a\ndelicate thing of this kind.\"\n\nThis is how, to my infinite relief, the Celebrity came to engineer the\nmatter of the housewarming; and to him it was much more congenial. He\naccepted the task cheerfully, and went about it in such a manner as to\nleave no doubt in my mind as to its ultimate success. He was a master\nhand at just such problems, and this one had a double attraction. It\npleased him to be thought the arbiter of such a worthy cause, while he\nacquired a prominence at Asquith which satisfied in some part a craving\nwhich he found inseparable from incognito.\n\nHis tactics were worthy of a skilled diplomatist. Before we left Mohair\nthat day he had exacted as a condition that Mr. Cooke should not appear\nat the inn or in its vicinity until after the entertainment. To this my\nclient readily pledged himself with that absolute freedom from suspicion\nwhich formed one of the most admirable traits of his character. The\nCelebrity, being intuitively quick where women were concerned, had\nsurmised that Mrs. Cooke did not like him; but as her interests in\nthe affair of the cotillon coincided with those of Mr. Cooke, she was\navailable as a means to an end. The Celebrity deemed her, from a social\nstandpoint, decidedly the better part of the Mohair establishment, and\nhe contrived, by a system of manoeuvres I failed to grasp, to throw her\nforward while he kept Mr. Cooke in the background.\n\nHe had much to contend with; above all, an antecedent prejudice against\nthe Cookes, in reality a prejudice against the world, the flesh, and\nthe devil, natural to any quiet community, and of which Mohair and its\nappurtenances were taken as the outward and visible signs. Older people\ncame to Asquith for simplicity and rest, and the younger ones were\nbrought there for these things. Nearly all had sufficient wealth to\nseek, if they chose, gayety and ostentation at the eastern resorts. But\nAsquithians held gayety and ostentation at a discount, and maintained\nthere was gayety enough at home.\n\nIf any one were fitted to overcome this prejudice, it was Mrs. Cooke.\nHer tastes and manners were as simple as her gowns. The Celebrity, by\narts unknown, induced Mrs. Judge Short and two other ladies to call at\nMohair on a certain afternoon when Mr. Cooke was trying a trotter on the\ntrack. The three returned wondering and charmed with Mrs. Cooke; they\nwere sure she had had no hand in the furnishing of that atrocious house.\nTheir example was followed by others at a time when the master of Mohair\nwas superintending in person the docking of some two-year-olds, and\nequally invisible. These ladies likewise came back to sing Mrs. Cooke's\npraises. Mrs. Cooke returned the calls. She took tea on the inn veranda,\nand drove Mrs. Short around Mohair in her victoria. Mr. Cooke being seen\nonly on rare and fleeting occasions, there gradually got abroad a most\ncurious misconception of that gentleman's character, while over his\npersonality floated a mist of legend which the Celebrity took good\ncare not to dispel. Farrar, who despised nonsense, was ironical and\nnon-committal when appealed to, and certainly I betrayed none of\nmy client's attributes. Hence it came that Asquith, before the\nhouse-warming, knew as little about Farquhar Fenelon Cooke, the man, as\nthe nineteenth century knows about William Shakespeare, and was every\nwhit as curious. Like Shakespeare, Mr. Cooke was judged by his works,\nand from these he was generally conceded to be an illiterate and\nindifferent person of barbarous tastes and a mania for horses. He was\nfurther described as ungentlemanly by a brace of spinsters who had been\nwithin earshot on the veranda the morning he had abused the Asquith\nroads, but their evidence was not looked upon as damning. That Mr. Cooke\nwould appear at the cotillon never entered any one's head.\n\nThus it was, for a fortnight, Mr. Cooke maintained a most rigid\nseclusion. Would that he had discovered in the shroud of mystery the\ncloak of fame!\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME 2.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIt was small wonder, said the knowing at Asquith, that Mr. Charles\nWrexell Allen should be attracted by Irene Trevor. With the lake breezes\nof the north the red and the tan came into her cheeks, those boon\ncompanions of the open who are best won by the water-winds. Perhaps they\nbrought, too, the spring to the step and the light under the long lashes\nwhen she flashed a look across the table. Little by little it became\nplain that Miss Trevor was gaining ground with the Celebrity to the\nneglect of the other young women at Asquith, and when it was announced\nthat he was to lead the cotillon with her, the fact was regarded as\nsignificant. Even at Asquith such things were talked about. Mr. Allen\nbecame a topic and a matter of conjecture. He was, I believe, generally\nregarded as a good match; his unimpeachable man-servant argued worldly\npossessions, of which other indications were not lacking, while his\ncrest was cited as a material sign of family. Yet when Miss Brewster,\none of the brace of spinsters, who hailed from Brookline and purported\nto be an up-to-date edition of the Boston Blue Book, questioned the\nCelebrity on this vital point after the searching manner warranted\nby the gravity of the subject, he was unable to acquit himself\nsatisfactorily. When this conversation was repeated in detail within the\nhearing of the father of the young woman in question, and undoubtedly\nfor his benefit, Mr. Trevor threw shame to the winds and scandalized the\nMisses Brewster then and there by proclaiming his father to have been\na country storekeeper. In the eyes of Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke the\napotheosis of the Celebrity was complete. The people of Asquith were not\nonly willing to attend the house-warming, but had been worked up to the\npitch of eagerness. The Celebrity as a matter of course was master of\nceremonies. He originated the figures and arranged the couples, of which\nthere were twelve from Asquith and ten additional young women. These\nten were assigned to the ten young men whom Mr. Cooke expected in\nhis private car, and whose appearances, heights, and temperaments the\nCelebrity obtained from Mr. Cooke, carefully noted, and compared with\nthose of the young women. Be it said in passing that Mrs. Cooke\nhad nothing to do with any of it, but exhibited an almost criminal\nindifference. Mr. Cooke had even chosen the favors; charity forbids that\nI should say what they were.\n\nOwing to the frequent consultations which these preparations made\nnecessary the Celebrity was much in the company of my client, which\nhe came greatly to prefer to mine, and I therefore abandoned my\ndetermination to leave Asquith. I was settling down delightedly to\nmy old, easy, and unmolested existence when Farrar and I received\nan invitation, which amounted to a summons, to go to Mohair and make\nourselves generally useful. So we packed up and went. We made an odd\nparty before the arrival of the Ten, particularly when the Celebrity\ndropped in for lunch or dinner. He could not be induced to remain\npermanently at Mohair because Miss Trevor was at Asquith, but he\nappropriated a Hempstead cart from the Mohair stables and made the trip\nsometimes twice in a day. The fact that Mrs. Cooke treated him with\nunqualified disapproval did not dampen his spirits or lessen the\nfrequency of his visits, nor, indeed, did it seem to create any breach\nbetween husband and wife. Mr. Cooke took it for granted that his friends\nshould not please his wife, and Mrs. Cooke remarked to Farrar and\nme that her husband was old enough to know better, and too old to be\ntaught. She loved him devotedly and showed it in a hundred ways, but she\nwas absolutely incapable of dissimulation.\n\nThanks to Mrs. Cooke, our visit to Mohair was a pleasant one. We were\nable in many ways to help in the arrangements, especially Farrar, who\nhad charge of decorating the grounds. We saw but little of Mr. Cooke and\nthe Celebrity.\n\nThe arrival of the Ten was an event of importance, and occurred the\nday of the dance. I shall treat the Ten as a whole because they did not\nmaterially differ from one another in dress or habits or ambition or\ngeneral usefulness on this earth. It is true that Mr. Cooke had been\nable to make delicate distinctions between them for the aid of the\nCelebrity, but such distinctions were beyond me, and the power to make\nthem lay only in a long and careful study of the species which I could\nnot afford to give. Likewise the life of any one of the Ten was the life\nof all, and might be truthfully represented by a single year, since\neach year was exactly like the preceding. The ordinary year, as is\nwell-known, begins on the first of January. But theirs was not the\nordinary year, nor the Church year, nor the fiscal year. Theirs began in\nthe Fall with the New York Horse Show. And I am of the opinion, though\nopen to correction, that they dated from the first Horse Show instead\nof from the birth of Christ. It is certain that they were much better\nversed in the history of the Association than in that of the Union, in\nthe biography of Excelsior rather than that of Lincoln. The Dog Show was\nanother event to which they looked forward, when they migrated to New\nYork and put up at the country places of their friends. But why go\nfarther?\n\nThe Ten made themselves very much at home at Mohair. One of them told\nthe Celebrity he reminded him very much of a man he had met in New York\nand who had written a book, or something of that sort, which made the\nCelebrity wince. The afternoon was spent in one of the stable lofts,\nwhere Mr. Cooke had set up a mysterious L-shaped box, in one arm\nof which a badger was placed by a groom, while my client's Sarah, a\nterrier, was sent into the other arm to invite the badger out. His\nobjections exceeded the highest hopes; he dug his claws into the wood\nand devoted himself to Sarah's countenance with unremitting industry.\nThis occupation was found so absorbing that it was with difficulty the\nTen were induced to abandon it and dress for an early dinner, and only\ndid so after the second peremptory message from Mrs. Cooke.\n\n\"It's always this way,\" said Mr. Cooke, regretfully, as he watched\nSarah licking the accessible furrows in her face; \"I never started in on\nanything worth doing yet that Maria did not stop it.\"\n\nFarrar and I were not available for the dance, and after dinner we\nlooked about for a quiet spot in which to weather it, and where we\ncould be within reach if needed. Such a place as this was the Florentine\ngalleried porch, which ran along outside the upper windows of the\nball-room; these were flung open, for the night was warm. At one end\nof the room the musicians, imported from Minneapolis by Mr. Cooke, were\nstriking the first discordant notes of the tuning, while at the other\nthe Celebrity and my client, in scarlet hunting-coats, were gravely\ninstructing the Ten, likewise in scarlet hunting-coats, as to their\nconduct and functions. We were reviewing these interesting proceedings\nwhen Mrs. Cooke came hurrying towards us. She held a letter in her hand.\n\n\"You know,\" said she, \"that Mr. Cooke is forgetful, particularly when\nhis mind is occupied with important matters, as it has been for some\ntime. Here is a letter from my niece, Miss Thorn, which he has carried\nin his pocket since Monday. We expected her two weeks ago, and had given\nher up. But it seems she was to leave Philadelphia on Wednesday, and\nwill be at that forlorn little station of Asquith at half-past nine\nto-night. I want you two to go over and meet her.\"\n\nWe expressed our readiness, and in ten minutes were in the station\nwagon, rolling rapidly down the long drive, for it was then after nine.\nWe passed on the way the van of the guests from Asquith. As we reached\nthe lodge we heard the whistle, and we backed up against one side of the\nplatform as the train pulled up at the other.\n\nFarrar and I are not imaginative; we did not picture to ourselves any\nparticular type for the girl we were going to meet, we were simply doing\nour best to get to the station before the train. We jumped from the\nwagon and were watching the people file out of the car, and I noticed\nthat more than one paused to look back over their shoulders as they\nreached the door. Then came a maid with hand-bag and shawls, and after\nher a tall young lady. She stood for a moment holding her skirt above\nthe grimy steps, with something of the stately pose which Richter has\ngiven his Queen Louise on the stairway, and the light of the reflector\nfell full upon her. She looked around expectantly, and recognizing Mrs.\nCooke's maid, who had stepped forward to relieve hers of the shawls,\nMiss Thorn greeted her with a smile which greatly prepossessed us in her\nfavor.\n\n\"How do you do, Jennie?\" she said. \"Did any one else come?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Marian,\" replied Jennie, abashed but pleased,--\"these\ngentlemen.\"\n\nFarrar and I introduced ourselves, awkwardly enough, and we both tried\nto explain at once how it was that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Cooke was there\nto meet her. Of course we made an absolute failure of it. She scanned\nour faces with a puzzled expression for a while and then broke into a\nlaugh.\n\n\"I think I understand,\" she said; \"they are having the house-warming.\"\n\n\"She's first-rate at guessing,\" said Farrar to me as we fled\nprecipitately to see that the trunks were hoisted into the basket.\nNeither of us had much presence of mind as we climbed into the wagon,\nand, what was even stranger, could not account for the lack of it. Miss\nThorn was seated in the corner; in spite of the darkness I could see\nthat she was laughing at us still.\n\n\"I feel very badly that I should have taken you away from the dance,\" we\nheard her say.\n\n\"We don't dance,\" I answered clumsily, \"and we were glad to come.\"\n\n\"Yes, we were glad to come,\" Farrar chimed in.\n\nThen we relapsed into a discomfited silence, and wished we were anywhere\nelse. But Miss Thorn relieved the situation by laughing aloud, and with\nsuch a hearty enjoyment that instead of getting angry and more mortified\nwe began to laugh ourselves, and instantly felt better. After that we\ngot along famously. She had at once the air of good fellowship and\nthe dignity of a woman, and she seemed to understand Farrar and me\nperfectly. Not once did she take us over our heads, though she might\nhave done so with ease, and we knew this and were thankful. We began to\ntell her about Mohair and the cotillon, and of our point of observation\nfrom the Florentine galleried porch, and she insisted she would join us\nthere. By the time we reached the house we were thanking our stars she\nhad come. Mrs. Cooke came out under the port-cochere to welcome her.\n\n\"Unfortunately there is no one to dance with you, Marian,\" she said;\n\"but if I had not by chance gone through your uncle's pockets, there\nwould have been no one to meet you.\"\n\nI think I had never felt my deficiency in dancing until that moment. But\nMiss Thorn took her aunt's hand affectionately in hers.\n\n\"My dear Aunt Maria,\" said she, \"I would not dance to-night if there\nwere twenty to choose from. I should like nothing better than to look on\nwith these two. We are the best of friends already,\" she added, turning\ntowards us, \"are we not?\"\n\n\"We are indeed,\" we hastened to assure her.\n\nMrs. Cooke smiled.\n\n\"You should have been a man, Marian,\" she said as they went upstairs\ntogether.\n\nWe made our way to the galleried porch and sat down, there being a lull\nin the figures just then. We each took out a cigar and lighted a match;\nand then looked across at the other. We solemnly blew our matches out.\n\n\"Perhaps she doesn't like smoke,\" said Farrar, voicing the sentiment.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said I.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I wonder how she will get along with the Ten?\" I queried.\n\n\"Better than with us,\" he answered in his usual strain. \"They're\ntrained.\"\n\n\"Or with Allen?\" I added irresistibly.\n\n\"Women are all alike,\" said Farrar.\n\nAt this juncture Miss Thorn herself appeared at the end of the gallery,\nher shoulders wrapped in a gray cape trimmed with fur. She stood\nregarding us with some amusement as we rose to receive her.\n\n\"Light your cigars and be sensible,\" said she, \"or I shall go in.\"\n\nWe obeyed. The three of us turned to the window to watch the figure, the\nmusic of which was just beginning. Mr. Cooke, with the air of an English\nsquire at his own hunt ball, was strutting contentedly up and down one\nend of the room, now pausing to exchange a few hearty words with some\nPresbyterian matron from Asquith, now to congratulate Mr. Trevor on the\nappearance of his daughter. Lined against the opposite wall were the\nCelebrity and his ten red-coated followers, just rising for the figure.\nIt was very plain that Miss Trevor was radiantly happy; she was easily\nthe handsomest girl in the room, and I could not help philosophizing\nwhen I saw her looking up into the Celebrity's eyes upon the seeming\ninconsistency of nature, who has armed and warned woman against all but\nher most dangerous enemy.\n\nAnd then a curious thing happened. The Celebrity, as if moved by a\nsudden uncontrollable impulse, raised his eyes until they rested on the\nwindow in which we were. Although his dancing was perfect, he lost the\nstep without apparent cause, his expression changed, and for the moment\nhe seemed to be utterly confused. But only for the moment; in a trice\nhe had caught the time again and swept Miss Trevor rapidly down the room\nand out of sight. I looked instinctively at the girl beside me. She had\nthrown her head forward, and in the streaming light I saw that her lips\nwere parted in a smile.\n\nI resolved upon a stroke.\n\n\"Mr. Allen,\" I remarked, \"leads admirably.\"\n\n\"Mr. Allen!\" she exclaimed, turning on me.\n\n\"Yes, it is Mr. Allen who is leading,\" I repeated.\n\nAn expression of perplexity spread over her face, but she said nothing.\nMy curiosity was aroused to a high pitch, and questions were rising to\nmy lips which I repressed with difficulty. For Miss Thorn had displayed,\npurposely or not, a reticence which my short acquaintance with her\ncompelled me to respect; and, besides, I was bound by a promise not to\nbetray the Celebrity's secret. I was, however, convinced from what had\noccurred that she had met the Celebrity in the East, and perhaps known\nhim.\n\nHad she fallen in love with him, as was the common fate of all young\nwomen he met? I changed my opinion on this subject a dozen times. Now\nI was sure, as I looked at her, that she was far too sensible; again, a\ndoubt would cross my mind as the Celebrity himself would cross my view,\nthe girl on his arm reduced to adoration. I followed him narrowly when\nin sight. Miss Thorn was watching him, too, her eyes half closed, as\nthough in thought. But beyond the fact that he threw himself into the\ndance with a somewhat increased fervor, perhaps, his manner betokened\nno uneasiness, and not even by a glance did he betray any disturbing\ninfluence from above.\n\nThus we stood silently until the figure was finished, when Miss Thorn\nseated herself in one of the wicker chairs behind us.\n\n\"Doesn't it make you wish to dance?\" said Farrar to her. \"It is hard\nluck you should be doomed to spend the evening with two such useless\nfellows as we are.\"\n\nShe did not catch his remark at first, as was natural in a person\npreoccupied. Then she bit her lips to repress a smile.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Farrar,\" she said with force, \"I have never in my\nlife wished to dance as little as I do now.\"\n\nBut a voice interrupted her, and the scarlet coat of the Celebrity was\nthrust into the light between us. Farrar excused himself abruptly and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Never wished to dance less!\" cried the Celebrity. \"Upon my word,\nMiss Thorn, that's too bad. I came up to ask you to reconsider your\ndetermination, as one of the girls from Asquith is leaving, and there is\nan extra man.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said Miss Thorn, quietly, \"but I prefer to remain\nhere.\"\n\nMy surmise, then, was correct. She had evidently met the Celebrity,\nand there was that in his manner of addressing her, without any formal\ngreeting, which seemed to point to a close acquaintance.\n\n\"You know Mr. Allen, then, Miss Thorn?\" said I.\n\n\"What can you mean?\" she exclaimed, wheeling on me; \"this is not Mr.\nAllen.\"\n\n\"Hang you, Crocker,\" the Celebrity put in impatiently; \"Miss Thorn knows\nwho I am as well as you do.\"\n\n\"I confess it is a little puzzling,\" said she; \"perhaps it is because I\nam tired from travelling, and my brain refuses to work. But why in the\nname of all that is strange do you call him Mr. Allen?\"\n\nThe Celebrity threw himself into the chair beside her and asked\npermission to light a cigarette.\n\n\"I am going to ask you the favor of respecting my incognito, Miss Thorn,\nas Crocker has done,\" he said. \"Crocker knew me in the East, too. I had\nnot counted upon finding him at Asquith.\"\n\nMiss Thorn straightened herself and made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"An incognito!\" she cried. \"But you have taken another man's name. And\nyou already had his face and figure!\"\n\nI jumped.\n\n\"That is so,\" he calmly returned; \"the name was ready to hand, and so I\ntook it. I don't imagine it will make any difference to him. It's only a\nwhim of mine, and with me there's no accounting for a whim. I make it\na point to gratify every one that strikes me. I confess to being\neccentric, you know.\"\n\n\"You must get an enormous amount of gratification out of this,\" she said\ndryly. \"What if the other man should happen along?\"\n\n\"Scarcely at Asquith.\"\n\n\"I have known stranger things to occur,\" said she.\n\nThe Celebrity smiled and smoked.\n\n\"I'll wager, now,\" he went on, \"that you little thought to find me\nhere incognito. But it is delicious, I assure you, to lead once more a\ncommonplace and unmolested existence.\"\n\n\"Delightful,\" said Miss Thorn.\n\n\"People never consider an author apart from his work, you know, and\nI confess I had a desire to find out how I would get along. And there\ncomes a time when a man wishes he had never written a book, and a\nlonging to be sought after for his own sake and to be judged on his own\nmerits. And then it is a great relief to feel that one is not at the\nbeck and call of any one and every one wherever one goes, and to know\nthat one is free to choose one's own companions and do as one wishes.\"\n\n\"The sentiment is good,\" Miss Thorn agreed, \"very good. But doesn't it\nseem a little odd, Mr. Crocker,\" she continued, appealing to me, \"that\na man should take the pains to advertise a trip to Europe in order to\ngratify a whim of this sort?\"\n\n\"It is indeed incomprehensible to me,\" I replied, with a kind of grim\npleasure, \"but you must remember that I have always led a commonplace\nexistence.\"\n\nAlthough the Celebrity was almost impervious to sarcasm, he was now\nbeginning to exhibit visible signs of uneasiness, the consciousness\ndawning upon him that his eccentricity was not receiving the ovation it\nmerited. It was with a palpable relief that he heard the first warning\nnotes of the figure.\n\n\"Am I to understand that you wish me to do my part in concealing your\nidentity?\" asked Miss Thorn, cutting him short as he was expressing\npleasure at her arrival.\n\n\"If you will be so kind,\" he answered, and departed with a bow. There\nwas a mischievous mirth in her eye as she took her place in the window.\nBelow in the ball-room sat Miss Trevor surrounded by men, and I saw her\nface lighting at the Celebrity's approach.\n\n\"Who is that beautiful girl he is dancing with?\" said Miss Thorn.\n\nI told her.\n\n\"Have you read his books?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\n\"Some of them.\"\n\n\"So have I.\"\n\nThe Celebrity was not mentioned again that evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAs an endeavor to unite Mohair and Asquith the cotillon had proved a\ndismal failure. They were as the clay and the brass. The next morning\nAsquith was split into factions and rent by civil strife, and the porch\nof the inn was covered by little knots of women, all trying to talk at\nonce; their faces told an ominous tale. Not a man was to be seen. The\nMinneapolis, St. Paul, and Chicago papers, all of which had previously\ncontained elaborate illustrated accounts of Mr. Cooke's palatial park\nand residence, came out that morning bristling with headlines about\nthe ball, incidentally holding up the residents of a quiet and retiring\nlittle community in a light that scandalized them beyond measure. And\nMr. Charles Wrexell Allen, treasurer of the widely known Miles Standish\nBicycle Company, was said to have led the cotillon in a manner that left\nnothing to be desired.\n\nSo it was this gentleman whom the Celebrity was personating! A queer\nwhim indeed.\n\nAfter that, I doubt if the court of Charles the Second was regarded\nby the Puritans with a greater abhorrence than was Mohair by the\ngood ladies of Asquith. Mr. Cooke and his ten friends were branded as\nprofligates whose very scarlet coats bore witness that they were of the\ndevil. Mr. Cooke himself, who particularly savored of brimstone, would\nmuch better have remained behind the arras, for he was denounced with\nsuch energy and bitterness that those who might have attempted his\ndefence were silent, and their very silence told against them. Mr. Cooke\nhad indeed outdone himself in hospitality. He had posted punch-bowls in\nevery available corner, and so industriously did he devote himself to\nthe duties of host, as he conceived them, that as many as four of the\npatriarchs of Asquith and pillars of the church had returned home more\nor less insensible, while others were quite incoherent. The odds being\noverwhelming, the master of Mohair had at length fallen a victim to his\nown good cheer. He took post with Judge Short at the foot of the\nstair, where, in spite of the protests of the Celebrity and of other\nwell-disposed persons, the two favored the parting guests with an\noccasional impromptu song and waved genial good-byes to the ladies. And,\nwhen Mrs. Short attempted to walk by with her head in the air, as though\nthe judge were in an adjoining county, he so far forgot his judicial\ndignity as to chuck her under the chin, an act which was applauded with\nmuch boyish delight by Mr. Cooke, and a remark which it is just as well\nnot to repeat. The judge desired to spend the night at Mohair, but was\nafterwards taken home by main force, and the next day his meals were\nbrought up to him. It is small wonder that Mrs. Short was looked upon as\nthe head of the outraged party. The Ten were only spoken of in whispers.\nThree of them had been unable to come to time when the last figure was\ncalled, whereupon their partners were whisked off the scene without\nso much as being allowed to pay their respects to the hostess. Besides\nthese offences, there were other minor barbarisms too numerous to\nmention.\n\nAlthough Mrs. Short's party was all-powerful at Asquith, there were some\nwho, for various reasons, refused to agree in the condemnation of Mr.\nCooke. Judge Short and the other gentlemen in his position were, of\ncourse, restricted, but Mr. Trevor came out boldly in the face of severe\ncriticism and declared that his daughter should accept any invitation\nfrom Mrs. Cooke that she chose, and paid but little attention to the\ncoolness resulting therefrom. He was fast getting a reputation for\noddity. And the Celebrity tried to conciliate both parties, and\nsucceeded, though none but he could have done it. At first he was eyed\nwith suspicion and disgust as he drove off to Mohair in his Hempstead\ncart, and was called many hard names. But he had a way about him which\nwon them in the end.\n\nA few days later I ran over to Mohair and found my client with the\ncolored Sunday supplement of a Chicago newspaper spread out before him,\neyeing the page with something akin to childish delight. I discovered\nthat it was a picture of his own hunt ball, and as a bit of color it was\nmarvellous, the scarlet coats being very much in evidence.\n\n\"There, old man!\" he exclaimed. \"What do you think of that? Something of\na sendoff, eh?\" And he pointed to a rather stout and important gentleman\nin the foreground. \"That's me!\" he said proudly, \"and they wouldn't do\nthat for Farquhar Fenelon Cooke in Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"A prophet is without honor in his own country,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I don't set up for a prophet,\" said Mr. Cooke, \"but I did predict that\nI would start a ripple here, didn't I?\"\n\nI did not deny this.\n\n\"How do I stand over there?\" he inquired, designating Asquith by a twist\nof the head. \"I hear they're acting all over the road; that they think\nI'm the very devil.\"\n\n\"Well, your stock has dropped some, I admit,\" I answered. \"They didn't\ntake kindly to your getting the judge drunk, you know.\"\n\n\"They oughtn't to complain about that,\" said my client; \"and besides, he\nwasn't drunk enough to amount to anything.\"\n\n\"However that may be,\" said I, \"you have the credit for leading him\nastray. But there is a split in your favor.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to know that,\" he said, brightening; \"then I won't have to\nimport any more.\"\n\n\"Any more what?\" I asked.\n\n\"People from the East to keep things moving, of course. What I have\nhere and those left me at the inn ought to be enough to run through the\nsummer with. Don't you think so?\"\n\nI thought so, and was moving off when he called me back.\n\n\"Is the judge locked up, old man?\" he demanded.\n\n\"He's under rather close surveillance,\" I replied, smiling.\n\n\"Crocker;\" he said confidentially, \"see if you can't smuggle him over\nhere some day soon. The judge always holds good cards, and plays a\nnumber one hand.\"\n\nI promised, and escaped. On the veranda I came upon Miss Thorn\nsurrounded by some of her uncle's guests. I imagine that she was bored,\nfor she looked it.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" she called out, \"you're just the man I have been wishing\nto see.\"\n\nThe others naturally took this for a dismissal, and she was not long in\ncoming to her point when we were alone.\n\n\"What is it you know about this queer but gifted genius who is here so\nmysteriously?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" I confessed. \"I knew him before he thought of\nbecoming a genius.\"\n\n\"Retrogression is always painful,\" she said; \"but tell me something\nabout him then.\"\n\nI told her all I knew, being that narrated in these pages. \"Now,\" said\nI, \"if you will pardon a curiosity on my part, from what you said the\nother evening I inferred that he closely resembles the man whose name it\npleased him to assume. And that man, I learn from the newspapers, is Mr.\nCharles Wrexell Allen of the 'Miles Standish Bicycle Company.'\"\n\nMiss Thorn made a comic gesture of despair.\n\n\"Why he chose Mr. Allen's name,\" she said, \"is absolutely beyond my\nguessing. Unless there is some purpose behind the choice, which I do not\nfor an instant believe, it was a foolish thing to do, and one very apt\nto lead to difficulties. I can understand the rest. He has a reputation\nfor eccentricity which he feels he must keep up, and this notion of\nassuming a name evidently appealed to him as an inspiration.\"\n\n\"But why did he come out here?\" I asked. \"Can you tell me that?\"\n\nMiss Thorn flushed slightly, and ignored the question.\n\n\"I met the 'Celebrity,' as you call him,\" she said, \"for the first time\nlast winter, and I saw him frequently during the season. Of course I had\nheard not a little about him and his peculiarities. His name seems to\nhave gone the length and breadth of the land. And, like most girls, I\nhad read his books and confess I enjoyed them. It is not too much to\nsay,\" she added archly, \"that I made a sort of archangel out of the\nauthor.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" said I.\n\n\"But that did not last,\" she continued hastily. \"I see I have got beside\nmy story. I saw a great deal of him in New York. He came to call, and I\nbelieve I danced with him once or twice. And then my aunt, Mrs. Rivers,\nbought a place near Epsom, in Massachusetts, and had a house party there\nin May. And the Celebrity was invited.\"\n\nI smiled.\n\n\"Oh, I assure you it was a mere chance,\" said Miss Thorn. \"I mention\nthis that I may tell you the astonishing part of it all. Epsom is one of\nthose smoky manufacturing towns one sees in New England, and the 'Miles\nStandish' bicycle is made there. The day after we all arrived at my\naunt's a man came up the drive on a wheel whom I greeted in a friendly\nway and got a decidedly uncertain bow in return.\n\n\"I thought it rather a strange shift from a marked cordiality, and spoke\nof the circumstance to my aunt, who was highly amused. 'Why, my dear,'\nsaid she, 'that was Mr. Allen, of the bicycle company. I was nearly\ndeceived myself.'\"\n\n\"And is the resemblance so close as that?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So close! Believe me, they are as like as two ices from a mould. Of\ncourse, when they are together one can distinguish the Celebrity from\nthe bicycle man. The Celebrity's chin is a little more square, and his\nnose straighter, and there are other little differences. I believe\nMr. Allen has a slight scar on his forehead. But the likeness was\nremarkable, nevertheless, and it grew to be a standing joke with\nus. They actually dressed ludicrously alike. The Celebrity became so\nsensitive about it that he went back to New York before the party broke\nup. We grew to be quite fond of the bicycle man.\"\n\nShe paused and shifted her chair, which had rocked close to mine.\n\n\"And can you account for his coming to Asquith?\" I asked innocently.\n\nShe was plainly embarrassed.\n\n\"I suppose I might account for it, Mr. Crocker,\" she replied. Then she\nadded, with something of an impulse, \"After all, it is foolish of me not\nto tell you. You probably know the Celebrity well enough to have learned\nthat he takes idiotic fancies to young women.\"\n\n\"Not always idiotic,\" I protested.\n\n\"You mean that the young women are not always idiotic, I suppose. No,\nnot always, but nearly always. I imagine he got the idea of coming to\nAsquith,\" she went on with a change of manner, \"because I chanced to\nmention that I was coming out here on a visit.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I remarked, and there words failed me.\n\nHer mouth was twitching with merriment.\n\n\"I am afraid you will have to solve the rest of it for yourself, Mr.\nCrocker,\" said she; \"that is all of my contribution. My uncle tells me\nyou are the best lawyer in the country, and I am surprised that you are\nso slow in getting at motives.\"\n\nAnd I did attempt to solve it on my way back to Asquith. The conclusion\nI settled to, everything weighed, was this: that the Celebrity had\nbecome infatuated with Miss Thorn (I was far from blaming him for that)\nand had followed her first to Epsom and now to Asquith. And he had\nchosen to come West incognito partly through the conceit which he\nadmitted and gloried in, and partly because he believed his prominence\nsufficient to obtain for him an unpleasant notoriety if he continued\nlong enough to track the same young lady about the country. Hence he had\ntaken the trouble to advertise a trip abroad to account for his absence.\nUndoubtedly his previous conquests had been made more easily, for my\nsecond talk with Miss Thorn had put my mind at rest as to her having\nfallen a victim to his fascinations. Her arrival at Mohair being\ndelayed, the Celebrity had come nearly a month too soon, and in the\ninterval that tendency of which he was the dupe still led him by the\nnose; he must needs make violent love to the most attractive girl on the\nground,--Miss Trevor. Now that one still more attractive had arrived\nI was curious to see how he would steer between the two, for I made no\ndoubt that matters had progressed rather far with Miss Trevor. And in\nthis I was not mistaken.\n\nBut his choice of the name of Charles Wrexell Allen bothered me\nconsiderably. I finally decided that he had taken it because convenient,\nand because he believed Asquith to be more remote from the East than the\nSandwich Islands.\n\nReaching the inn grounds, I climbed the hillside to a favorite haunt of\nmine, a huge boulder having a sloping back covered with soft turf. Hence\nI could watch indifferently both lake and sky. Presently, however, I was\naroused by voices at the foot of the rock, and peering over the edge I\ndiscovered a kind of sewing-circle gathered there. The foliage hid me\ncompletely. I perceived the Celebrity perched upon the low branch of\nan apple-tree, and Miss Trevor below him, with two other girls, doing\nfancy-work. I shall not attempt to defend the morality of my action,\nbut I could not get away without discovery, and the knowledge that I had\nheard a part of their conversation might prove disquieting to them.\n\nThe Celebrity had just published a book, under the title of 'The\nSybarites', which was being everywhere discussed; and Asquith, where\nsummer reading was general, came in for its share of the debate. Why\nit was called The Sybarites I have never discovered. I did not read the\nbook because I was sick and tired of the author and his nonsense, but I\nimbibed, in spite of myself, something of the story and its moral from\nhearing it talked about. The Celebrity himself had listened to arguments\non the subject with great serenity, and was nothing loth to give his\nopinion when appealed to. I realized at once that 'The Sybarites' was\nthe present topic.\n\n\"Yes, it is rather an uncommon book,\" he was saying languidly, \"but\nthere is no use writing a story unless it is uncommon.\"\n\n\"Dear, how I should like to meet the author!\" exclaimed a voice. \"He\nmust be a charming man, and so young, too! I believe you said you knew\nhim, Mr. Allen.\"\n\n\"An old acquaintance,\" he answered, \"and I am always reminding him that\nhis work is overestimated.\"\n\n\"How can you say he is overestimated!\" said a voice.\n\n\"You men are all jealous of him,\" said another.\n\n\"Is he handsome? I have heard he is.\"\n\n\"He would scarcely be called so,\" said the Celebrity, doubtfully.\n\n\"He is, girls,\" Miss Trevor interposed; \"I have seen his photograph.\"\n\n\"What does he look like, Irene?\" they chorused. \"Men are no judges.\"\n\n\"He is tall, and dark, and broad-shouldered,\" Miss Trevor enumerated,\nas though counting her stitches, \"and he has a very firm chin, and a\nstraight nose, and--\"\n\n\"Perfect!\" they cried. \"I had an idea he was just like that. I should go\nwild about him. Does he talk as well as he writes, Mr. Allen?\"\n\n\"That is admitting that he writes well.\"\n\n\"Admitting?\" they shouted scornfully, \"and don't you admit it?\"\n\n\"Some people like his writing, I have to confess,\" said the Celebrity,\nwith becoming calmness; \"certainly his personality could not sell an\nedition of thirty thousand in a month. I think 'The Sybarites' the best\nof his works.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Mr. Allen, I am disgusted with you,\" said the second\nvoice; \"I have not found a man yet who would speak a good word for him.\nBut I did not think it of you.\"\n\nA woman's tongue, like a firearm, is a dangerous weapon, and often\nstrikes where it is least expected. I saw with a wicked delight that the\nshot had told, for the Celebrity blushed to the roots of his hair, while\nMiss Trevor dropped three or four stitches.\n\n\"I do not see how you can expect men to like 'The Sybarites',\" she said,\nwith some heat; \"very few men realize or care to realize what a small\nchance the average woman has. I know marriage isn't a necessary goal,\nbut most women, as well as most men, look forward to it at some time of\nlife, and, as a rule, a woman is forced to take her choice of the two or\nthree men that offer themselves, no matter what they are. I admire a man\nwho takes up the cudgels for women, as he has done.\"\n\n\"Of course we admire him,\" they cried, as soon as Miss Trevor had\nstopped for breath.\n\n\"And can you expect a man to like a book which admits that women are the\nmore constant?\" she went on.\n\n\"Why, Irene, you are quite rabid on the subject,\" said the second voice;\n\"I did not say I expected it. I only said I had hoped to find Mr. Allen,\nat least, broad enough to agree with the book.\"\n\n\"Doesn't Mr. Allen remind you a little of Desmond?\" asked the first\nvoice, evidently anxious to avoid trouble.\n\n\"Do you know whom he took for Desmond, Mr. Allen? I have an idea it was\nhimself.\"\n\nMr. Allen, had now recovered some of his composure.\n\n\"If so, it was done unconsciously,\" he said. \"I suppose an author must\nput his best thoughts in the mouth of his hero.\"\n\n\"But it is like him?\" she insisted.\n\n\"Yes, he holds the same views.\"\n\n\"Which you do not agree with.\"\n\n\"I have not said I did not agree with them,\" he replied, taking up his\nown defence; \"the point is not that men are more inconstant than\nwomen, but that women have more excuse for inconstancy. If I remember\ncorrectly, Desmond, in a letter to Rosamond, says: 'Inconstancy in a\nwoman, because of the present social conditions, is often pardonable. In\na man, nothing is more despicable.' I think that is so. I believe that\na man should stick by the woman to whom he has given his word as closely\nas he sticks by his friends.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the aggressive second voice, \"that is all very well. But\nhow about the woman to whom he has not given his word? Unfortunately,\nthe present social conditions allow a man to go pretty far without a\ndefinite statement.\"\n\nAt this I could not refrain from looking at Miss Trevor. She was bending\nover her knitting and had broken her thread.\n\n\"It is presumption for a man to speak without some foundation,\" said the\nCelebrity, \"and wrong unless he is sure of himself.\"\n\n\n\"But you must admit,\" the second voice continued, \"that a man has\nno right to amuse himself with a woman, and give her every reason to\nbelieve he is going to marry her save the only manly and substantial\none. And yet that is something which happens every day. What do you\nthink of a man who deserts a woman under those conditions?\"\n\n\"He is a detestable dog, of course,\" declared the Celebrity.\n\nAnd the cock in the inn yard was silent.\n\n\"I should love to be able to quote from a book at will,\" said the\nquieting voice, for the sake of putting an end to an argument which bid\nfair to become disagreeable. \"How do you manage to do it?\"\n\n\"It was simply a passage that stuck in my mind,\" he answered modestly;\n\"when I read a book I pick them up just as a roller picks up a sod here\nand there as it moves over the lawn.\"\n\n\"I should think you might write, Mr. Allen, you have such an original\nway of putting things!\"\n\n\"I have thought of it,\" returned the Celebrity, \"and I may, some fine\nday.\"\n\nWherewith he thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered off with\nequanimity undisturbed, apparently unaware of the impression he had left\nbehind him. And the Fifth Reader story popped into my head of good King\nWilliam (or King Frederick, I forgot which), who had a royal fancy for\nlaying aside the gayeties of the court and straying incognito among his\nplainer subjects, but whose princely origin was invariably detected in\nspite of any disguise his Majesty could invent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nI experienced a great surprise a few mornings afterwards. I had risen\nquite early, and found the Celebrity's man superintending the hoisting\nof luggage on top of a van.\n\n\"Is your master leaving?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's off to Mohair now, sir,\" said the valet, with a salute.\n\nAt that instant the Celebrity himself appeared.\n\n\"Yes, old chap, I'm off to Mohair,\" he explained. \"There's more sport in\na day up there than you get here in a season. Beastly slow place, this,\nunless one is a deacon or a doctor of divinity. Why don't you come up,\nCrocker? Cooke would like nothing better; he has told me so a dozen\ntimes.\"\n\n\"He is very good,\" I replied. I could not resist the temptation to add,\n\"I had an idea Asquith rather suited your purposes just now.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" he said, jumping at the other half of my\nmeaning.\n\n\"Oh, nothing. But you told me when you came here, if I am not mistaken,\nthat you chose Asquith because of those very qualities for which you now\ncondemn it.\"\n\n\"Magna est vis consuetudinis,\" he laughed; \"I thought I could stand the\nlife, but I can't. I am tired of their sects and synods and sermons. By\nthe way,\" said he pulling at my sleeve, \"what a deuced pretty girl that\nMiss Thorn is! Isn't she? Rollins, where's the cart? Well, good-bye,\nCrocker; see you soon.\"\n\nHe drove rapidly off as the clock struck six, and an uneasy glance he\ngave the upper windows did not escape me. When Farrar appeared, I told\nhim what had happened.\n\n\"Good riddance,\" he replied sententiously.\n\nWe sat in silence until the bell rang, looking at the morning sun on the\nlake. I was a little anxious to learn the state of Farrar's feelings in\nregard to Miss Trevor, and how this new twist in affairs had affected\nthem. But I might as well have expected one of King Louis's carp\nto whisper secrets of the old regime. The young lady came to the\nbreakfast-table looking so fresh and in such high spirits that I made\nsure she had not heard of the Celebrity's ignoble escape. As the meal\nproceeded it was easy to mark that her eye now and again fell across his\nempty chair, and glanced inquiringly towards the door. I made up my mind\nthat I would not be the bearer of evil news, and so did Farrar, so we\nkept up a vapid small-talk with Mr. Trevor on the condition of trade\nin the West. Miss Trevor, however, in some way came to suspect that\nwe could account for that vacant seat. At last she fixed her eye\ninquiringly on me, and I trembled.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" she began, and paused. Then she added with a fair\nunconcern, \"do you happen to know where Mr. Allen is this morning?\"\n\n\"He has gone over to Mohair, I believe,\" I replied weakly.\n\n\"To Mohair!\" she exclaimed, putting down her cup; \"why, he promised to\ngo canoeing at ten.\n\n\"Probably he will be back by then,\" I ventured, not finding it in my\nheart to tell her the cruel truth. But I kept my eyes on my plate. They\nsay a lie has short legs. Mine had, for my black friend, Simpson, was at\nthat instant taking off the fruit, and overheard my remark.\n\n\"Mr. Allen done gone for good,\" he put in, \"done give me five dollars\nlast night. Why, sah,\" he added, scratching his head, \"you was on de\npoch dis mornin' when his trunks was took away!\"\n\nIt was certainly no time to quibble then.\n\n\"His trunks!\" Miss Trevor exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, he has left us and gone to Mohair,\" I said, \"bag and baggage. That\nis the flat truth of it.\"\n\nI suppose there is some general rule for calculating beforehand how a\nyoung woman is going to act when news of this sort is broken. I had no\nnotion of what Miss Trevor would do. I believe Farrar thought she would\nfaint, for he laid his napkin on the table. She did nothing of the kind,\nbut said simply:\n\n\"How unreliable men are!\"\n\nI fell to guessing what her feelings were; for the life of me I could\nnot tell from her face. I was sorry for Miss Trevor in spite of the fact\nthat she had neglected to ask my advice before falling in love with the\nCelebrity. I asked her to go canoeing with me. She refused kindly but\nvery firmly.\n\nIt is needless to say that the Celebrity did not come back to the inn,\nand as far as I could see the desertion was designed, cold-blooded,\nand complete. Miss Trevor remained out of sight during the day of his\ndeparture, and at dinner we noticed traces of a storm about her,--a\nstorm which had come and gone. There was an involuntary hush as she\nentered the dining-room, for Asquith had been buzzing that afternoon\nover the episode. And I admired the manner in which she bore her\ninspection. Already rumors of the cause of Mr. Allen's departure were in\nactive circulation, and I was astonished to learn that he had been seen\nthat day seated upon Indian rock with Miss Thorn herself. This piece of\nnews gave me a feeling of insecurity about people, and about women\nin particular, that I had never before experienced. After holding the\nCelebrity up to such unmeasured ridicule as she had done, ridicule not\nwithout a seasoning of contempt, it was difficult to believe Miss Thorn\nso inconsistent as to go alone with him to Indian rock; and she was\nnot ignorant of Miss Trevor's experience. But the fact was attested by\ntrustworthy persons.\n\nI have often wondered what prompted me to ask Miss Trevor again to go\ncanoeing. To do myself justice, it was no wish of mine to meddle with or\npry into her affairs. Neither did I flatter myself that my poor company\nwould be any consolation for that she had lost. I shall not try to\nanalyze my motive. Suffice it to record that she accepted this second\ninvitation, and I did my best to amuse her by relating a few of my\nexperiences at the bar, and I told that memorable story of Farrar\nthrowing O'Meara into the street. We were getting along famously, when\nwe descried another canoe passing us at some distance, and we both\nrecognized the Celebrity at the paddle by the flannel jacket of his\ncollege boat club. And Miss Thorn sat in the bow!\n\n\"Do you know anything about that man, Miss Trevor?\" I asked abruptly.\n\nShe grew scarlet, but replied:\n\n\"I know that he is a fraud.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"I can't say that I do; that is, nothing but what he has told me.\"\n\n\"If you will forgive my curiosity,\" I said, \"what has he told you?\"\n\n\"He says he is the author of The Sybarites,\" she answered, her lip\ncurling, \"but of course I do not believe that, now.\"\n\n\"But that happens to be true,\" I said, smiling.\n\nShe clapped her hands.\n\n\"I promised him I wouldn't tell,\" she cried, \"but the minute I get back\nto the inn I shall publish it.\"\n\n\"No, don't do that just yet,\" said I.\n\n\"Why not? Of course I shall.\"\n\nI had no definite reason, only a vague hope that we should get some\nbetter sort of enjoyment out of the disclosure before the summer was\nover.\n\n\"You see,\" I said, \"he is always getting into scrapes; he is that kind\nof a man. And it is my humble opinion that he has put his head into a\nnoose this time, for sure. Mr. Allen, of the 'Miles Standish Bicycle\nCompany,' whose name he has borrowed for the occasion, is enough like\nhim in appearance to be his twin brother.\"\n\n\"He has borrowed another man's name!\" she exclaimed; \"why, that's\nstealing!\"\n\n\"No, merely kleptomania,\" I replied; \"he wouldn't be the other man if he\ncould. But it has struck me that the real Mr. Allen might turn up here,\nor some friend of his, and stir things a bit. My advice to you is to\nkeep quiet, and we may have a comedy worth seeing.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she remarked, after she had got over a little of her\nastonishment, \"it would be great fun to tell, but I won't if you say\nso.\"\n\nI came to have a real liking for Miss Trevor. Farrar used to smile when\nI spoke of this, and I never could induce him to go out with us in the\ncanoe, which we did frequently,--in fact, every day I was at Asquith,\nexcept of course Sundays. And we grew to understand each other\nvery well. She looked upon me in the same light as did my other\nfriends,--that of a counsellor-at-law,--and I fell unconsciously into\nthe role of her adviser, in which capacity I was the recipient of many\nconfidences I would have got in no other way. That is, in no other way\nsave one, and in that I had no desire to go, even had it been possible.\nMiss Trevor was only nineteen, and in her eyes I was at least sixty.\n\n\"See here, Miss Trevor,\" I said to her one day after we had become more\nor less intimate, \"of course it's none of my business, but you didn't\nfeel very badly after the Celebrity went away, did you?\"\n\nHer reply was frank and rather staggering.\n\n\"Yes, I did. I was engaged to him, you know.\"\n\n\"Engaged to him! I had no idea he ever got that far,\" I exclaimed.\n\nMiss Trevor laughed merrily.\n\n\"It was my fault,\" she said; \"I pinned him down, and he had to propose.\nThere was no way out of it. I don't mind telling you.\"\n\nI did not know whether to be flattered or aggrieved by this avowal.\n\n\"You know,\" she went on, her tone half apologetic, \"the day after he\ncame he told me who he was, and I wanted to stop the people we passed\nand inform them of the lion I was walking with. And I was quite carried\naway by the honor of his attentions: any girl would have been, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" I assented.\n\n\"And I had heard and read so much of him, and I doted on his stories,\nand all that. His heroes are divine, you must admit. And, Mr. Crocker,\"\nshe concluded with a charming naivety, \"I just made up my mind I would\nhave him.\"\n\n\"Woman proposes, and man disposes,\" I laughed. \"He escaped in spite of\nyou.\"\n\nShe looked at me queerly.\n\n\"Only a jest,\" I said hurriedly; \"your escape is the one to be thankful\nfor. You might have married him, like the young woman in The Sybarites.\nYou remember, do you not, that the hero of that book sacrifices himself\nfor the lady who adores him, but whom he has ceased to adore?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" she laughed; \"I believe I know that book by heart.\"\n\n\"Think of the countless girls he must have relieved of their affections\nbefore their eyes were opened,\" I continued with mock gravity. \"Think of\nthe charred trail he has left behind him. A man of that sort ought to be\nput under heavy bonds not to break any more hearts. But a kleptomaniac\nisn't responsible, you understand. And it isn't worth while to bear any\nmalice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't bear any malice now,\" she said. \"I did at first, naturally.\nBut it all seems very ridiculous now I have had time to think it over. I\nbelieve, Mr. Crocker, that I never really cared for him.\"\n\n\"Simply an idol shattered this time,\" I suggested, \"and not a heart\nbroken.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said she.\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said I, much pleased that she had taken such a\nsensible view. \"But you are engaged to him.\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"You have broken the engagement, then?\"\n\n\"No, I--haven't,\" she said.\n\n\"Then he has broken it?\"\n\nShe did not appear to resent this catechism.\n\n\"That's the strange part of it,\" said Miss Trevor, \"he hasn't even\nthought it necessary.\"\n\n\"It is clear, then, that you are still engaged to him,\" said I, smiling\nat her blank face.\n\n\"I suppose I am,\" she cried. \"Isn't it awful? What shall I do, Mr.\nCrocker? You are so sensible, and have had so much experience.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I remarked grimly.\n\n\"Oh, you know what I mean: not that kind of experience, of course. But\nbreach of promise cases and that sort of thing. I have a photograph of\nhim with something written over it.\"\n\n\"Something compromising?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes, you would probably call it so,\" she answered, reddening. \"But\nthere is no need of my repeating it. And then I have a lot of other\nthings. If I write to break off the engagement I shall lose dignity, and\nit will appear as though I had regrets. I don't wish him to think that,\nof all things. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do nothing,\" I said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just that. Do not break the engagement, and keep the photograph and\nother articles for evidence. If he makes any overtures, don't consider\nthem for an instant. And I think, Miss Trevor, you will succeed sooner\nor later in making him very uncomfortable. Were he any one else I\nshouldn't advise such a course, but you won't lose any dignity and\nself-respect by it, as no one will be likely to hear of it. He can't\nbe taken seriously, and plainly he has never taken any one else so. He\nhasn't even gone to the trouble to notify you that he does not intend\nmarrying you.\"\n\nI saw from her expression that my suggestion was favorably entertained.\n\n\"What a joke it would be!\" she cried delightedly.\n\n\"And a decided act of charity,\" I added, \"to the next young woman on his\nlist.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe humor of my proposition appealed more strongly to Miss Trevor than\nI had looked for, and from that time forward she became her old self\nagain; for, even after she had conquered her love for the Celebrity, the\nmortification of having been jilted by him remained. Now she had come to\nlook upon the matter in its true proportions, and her anticipation of a\npossible chance of teaching him a lesson was a pleasure to behold. Our\ntable in the dining-room became again the abode of scintillating wit and\ncaustic repartee, Farrar bracing up to his old standard, and the demand\nfor seats in the vicinity rose to an animated competition. Mr. Charles\nWrexell Allen's chair was finally awarded to a nephew of Judge Short,\nwho could turn a story to perfection.\n\nSo life at the inn settled down again to what it had been before the\nCelebrity came to disturb it.\n\nI had my own reasons for staying away from Mohair. More than once as I\ndrove over to the county-seat in my buggy I had met the Celebrity on a\ntall tandem cart, with one of Mr. Cooke's high-steppers in the lead, and\nMiss Thorn in the low seat. I had forgotten to mention that my friend\nwas something of a whip. At such times I would bow very civilly and pass\non; not without a twinge, I confess. And as the result of one of these\nmeetings I had to retrace several miles of my road for a brief I had\nforgotten. After that I took another road, several miles longer, for the\nsight of Miss Thorn with him seriously disturbed my peace of mind. But\nat length the day came, as I had feared, when circumstances forced me\nto go to my client's place. One morning Miss Trevor and I were about\nstepping into the canoe for our customary excursion when one of Mr.\nCooke's footmen arrived with a note for each of us. They were from Mrs.\nCooke, and requested the pleasure of our company that day for luncheon.\n\"If you were I, would you go?\" Miss Trevor asked doubtfully.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied.\n\n\"But the consequences may be unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Don't let them,\" I said. \"Of what use is tact to a woman if not for\njust such occasions?\"\n\nMy invitation had this characteristic note tacked on the end of it\n\n\"DEAR CROCKER: Where are you? Where is the judge? F. F. C.\"\n\nI corralled the judge, and we started off across the fields, in no very\nmild state of fear of that gentleman's wife, whose vigilance was seldom\nrelaxed. And thus we came by a circuitous route to Mohair, the\njudge occupied by his own guilty thoughts, and I by others not less\ndisturbing. My client welcomed the judge with that warmth of manner\nwhich grappled so many of his friends to his heart, and they disappeared\ntogether into the Ethiopian card-room, which was filled with the\nassegais and exclamation point shields Mr. Cooke had had made at the\nSawmill at Beaverton.\n\nI learned from one of the lords-in-waiting loafing about the hall that\nMrs. Cooke was out on the golf links, chaperoning some of the Asquith\nyoung women whose mothers had not seen fit to ostracize Mohair. Mr.\nCooke's ten friends were with them. But this discreet and dignified\nservant could not reveal the whereabouts of Miss Thorn and of Mr. Allen,\nboth of whom I was decidedly anxious to avoid. I was much disgusted,\ntherefore, to come upon the Celebrity in the smoking-room, writing\nrapidly, with, sheets of manuscript piled beside him. And he was quite\ngood-natured over my intrusion.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"don't go. It's only a short story I promised for a\nChristmas number. They offered me fifteen cents a word and promised to\nput my name on the cover in red, so I couldn't very well refuse. It's no\ninspiration, though, I tell you that.\" He rose and pressed a bell behind\nhim and ordered whiskeys and ginger ales, as if he were in a hotel. \"Sit\ndown, Crocker,\" he said, waving me to a morocco chair. \"Why don't you\ncome over to see us oftener?\"\n\n\"I've been quite busy,\" I said.\n\nThis remark seemed to please him immensely.\n\n\"What a sly old chap you are,\" said he; \"really, I shall have to go back\nto the inn and watch you.\"\n\n\"What the deuce do you mean?\" I demanded.\n\nHe looked me over in well-bred astonishment and replied:\n\n\"Hang me, Crocker, if I can make you out. You seem to know the world\npretty well, and yet when a fellow twits you on a little flirtation you\nact as though you were going to black his eyes.\"\n\n\"A little flirtation!\" I repeated, aghast.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he said, smiling, \"we won't quarrel over a definition. Call\nit anything you like.\"\n\n\"Don't you think this a little uncalled for?\" I asked, beginning to lose\nmy temper.\n\n\"Bless you, no. Not among friends: not among such friends as we are.\"\n\n\"I didn't know we were such devilish good friends,\" I retorted warmly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, we are, devilish good friends,\" he answered with assurance;\n\"known each other from boyhood, and all that. And I say, old chap,\" he\nadded, \"you needn't be jealous of me, you know. I got out of that long\nago. And I'm after something else now.\"\n\nFor a space I was speechless. Then the ludicrous side of the matter\nstruck me, and I laughed in spite of myself. Better, after all, to deal\nwith a fool according to his folly. The Celebrity glanced at the door\nand drew his chair closer to mine.\n\n\"Crocker,\" he said confidentially, \"I'm glad you came here to-day. There\nis a thing or two I wished to consult you about.\"\n\n\"Professional?\" I asked, trying to head him off.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"amateur,--beastly amateur. A bungle, if I ever made\none. The truth is, I executed rather a faux pas over there at Asquith.\nTell me,\" said he, diving desperately at the root of it, \"how does Miss\nTrevor feel about my getting out? I meant to let her down easier; 'pon\nmy word, I did.\"\n\nThis is a way rascals have of judging other men by themselves.\n\n\"Well;\" said I, \"it was rather a blow, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he assented.\n\n\"And all the more unexpected,\" I went on, \"from a man who has written\nreams on constancy.\"\n\nI flatter myself that this nearly struck home, for he was plainly\nannoyed.\n\n\"Oh, bother that!\" said he. \"How many gowns believe in their own\nsermons? How many lawyers believe in their own arguments?\"\n\n\"Unhappily, not as many as might.\"\n\n\"I don't object to telling you, old chap,\" he continued, \"that I went\nin a little deeper than I intended. A good deal deeper, in fact. Miss\nTrevor is a deuced fine girl, and all that; but absolutely impossible. I\nforgot myself, and I confess I was pretty close to caught.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" I said gravely.\n\n\"That's the point of it. I don't know that I'm out of the woods yet. I\nwanted to see you and find out how she was acting.\"\n\nMy first impulse was to keep him in hot water. Fortunately I thought\ntwice.\n\n\"I don't know anything about Miss Trevor's feelings--\" I began.\n\n\"Naturally not--\" he interrupted, with a smile.\n\n\"But I have a notion that, if she ever fancied you, she doesn't care a\nstraw for you to-day.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she now,\" he replied somewhat regretfully. Here was one of the\nknots in his character I never could untie.\n\n\"Understand, that is simply my guess,\" I said. \"You must have discovered\nthat it is never possible to be sure of a woman's feelings.\"\n\n\"Found that out long ago,\" he replied with conviction, and added: \"Then\nyou think I need not anticipate any trouble from her?\"\n\n\"I have told you what I think,\" I answered; \"you know better than I what\nthe situation is.\"\n\nHe still lingered.\n\n\"Does she appear to be in,--ah,--in good spirits?\"\n\nI had work to keep my face straight.\n\n\"Capital,\" I said; \"I never saw her happier.\"\n\nThis seemed to satisfy him.\n\n\"Downcast at first, happy now,\" he remarked thoughtfully. \"Yes, she got\nover it. I'm much obliged to you, Crocker.\"\n\nI left him to finish his short story and walked out across the circle of\nsmooth lawn towards the golf links. And there I met Mrs. Cooke and her\nniece coming in together. The warm red of her costume became Miss Thorn\nwonderfully, and set off the glossy black of her hair. And her skin was\nglowing from the exercise. An involuntary feeling of admiration for this\ntall, athletic young woman swept over me, and I halted in my steps for\nno other reason, I believe, than that I might look upon her the longer.\n\nWhat man, I thought resentfully, would not travel a thousand miles to be\nnear her?\n\n\"It is Mr. Crocker,\" said Mrs. Cooke; \"I had given up all hope of ever\nseeing you again. Why have you been such a stranger?\"\n\n\"As if you didn't know, Aunt Maria,\" Miss Thorn put in gayly.\n\n\"Oh yes, I know,\" returned her aunt, \"and I have not been foolish enough\nto invite the bar without the magnet. And yet, Mr. Crocker,\" she went\non playfully, \"I had imagined that you were the one man in a hundred who\ndid not need an inducement.\"\n\nMiss Thorn began digging up the turf with her lofter: it was a painful\nmoment for me.\n\n\"You might at least have tried me, Mrs. Cooke,\" I said.\n\nMiss Thorn looked up quickly from the ground, her eyes searchingly upon\nmy face. And Mrs. Cooke seemed surprised.\n\n\"We are glad you came, at any rate,\" she answered.\n\nAnd at luncheon my seat was next to Miss Thorn's, while the Celebrity\nwas placed at the right of Miss Trevor. I observed that his face went\nblank from time to time at some quip of hers: even a dull woman may be\nsharp under such circumstances, and Miss Trevor had wits to spare. And\nI marked that she never allowed her talk with him to drift into deep\nwater; when there was danger of this she would draw the entire table\ninto their conversation by some adroit remark, or create a laugh at his\nexpense. As for me, I held a discreet if uncomfortable silence, save for\nthe few words which passed between Miss Thorn and me. Once or twice I\ncaught her covert glance on me. But I felt, and strongly, that there\ncould be no friendship between us now, and I did not care to dissimulate\nmerely for the sake of appearances. Besides, I was not a little put out\nover the senseless piece of gossip which had gone abroad concerning me.\n\nIt had been arranged as part of the day's programme that Mr. Cooke was\nto drive those who wished to go over the Rise in his new brake. But the\ntable was not graced by our host's presence, Mrs. Cooke apologizing for\nhim, explaining that he had disappeared quite mysteriously. It turned\nout that he and the judge had been served with luncheon in the Ethiopian\ncard-room, and neither threats nor fair words could draw him away.\nThe judge had not held such cards for years, and it was in vain that\nI talked to him of consequences. The Ten decided to remain and watch a\ngame which was pronounced little short of phenomenal, and my client gave\norders for the smaller brake and requested the Celebrity to drive.\nAnd this he was nothing loth to do. For the edification as well as the\nassurance of the party Mr. Allen explained, while we were waiting under\nthe porte cochere, how he had driven the Windsor coach down Piccadilly\nat the height of the season, with a certain member of Parliament and\nnoted whip on the box seat.\n\nAnd, to do him justice, he could drive. He won the instant respect of\nMr. Cooke's coachman by his manner of taking up the lines, and clinched\nit when he dropped a careless remark concerning the off wheeler. And\nafter the critical inspection of the horses which is proper he climbed\nup on the box. There was much hesitation among the ladies as to who\nshould take the seat of honor: Mrs. Cooke declining, it was pressed upon\nMiss Thorn. But she, somewhat to my surprise, declined also, and it was\nfinally filled by a young woman from Asquith.\n\nAs we drove off I found myself alone with Mrs. Cooke's niece on the seat\nbehind.\n\nThe day was cool and snappy for August, and the Rise all green with a\nlavish nature. Now we, plunged into a deep shade with the boughs lacing\neach other overhead, and crossed dainty, rustic bridges over the cold\ntrout-streams, the boards giving back the clatter of our horses' feet:\nor anon we shot into a clearing, with a colored glimpse of the lake and\nits curving shore far below us. I had always loved that piece of country\nsince the first look I had of it from the Asquith road, and the sight\nof it rarely failed to set my blood a-tingle with pleasure. But to-day\nI scarcely saw it. I wondered what whim had impelled Miss Thorn to get\ninto this seat. She paid but little attention to me during the first\npart of the drive, though a mere look in my direction seemed to afford\nher amusement. And at last, half way up the Rise, where the road takes\nto an embankment, I got a decided jar.\n\n\"Mr. Allen,\" she cried to the Celebrity, \"you must stop here. Do you\nremember how long we tarried over this bit on Friday?\"\n\nHe tightened the lines and threw a meaning glance backward.\n\nI was tempted to say:\n\n\"You and Mr. Allen should know these roads rather well, Miss Thorn.\"\n\n\"Every inch of them,\" she replied.\n\nWe must have gone a mile farther when she turned upon me.\n\n\"It is your duty to be entertaining, Mr. Crocker. What in the world are\nyou thinking of, with your brow all puckered up, forbidding as an owl?\"\n\n\"I was thinking how some people change,\" I answered, with a readiness\nwhich surprised me.\n\n\"Strange,\" she said, \"I had the same thing in mind. I hear decidedly\nqueer tales of you; canoeing every day that business does not prevent,\nand whole evenings spent at the dark end of a veranda.\"\n\n\"What rubbish!\" I exclaimed, not knowing whether to be angered or\namused.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" she said, with mock sternness, \"answer the charge. Guilty\nor not guilty?\"\n\n\"First let me make a counter-charge,\" said I; \"you have given me the\nright. Not long ago a certain young lady came to Mohair and found there\na young author of note with whom she had had some previous acquaintance.\nShe did not hesitate to intimate her views on the character of this\nCelebrity, and her views were not favorable.\"\n\nI paused. There was some satisfaction in seeing Miss Thorn biting her\nlip.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Not at all favorable, mind you,\" I went on. \"And the young lady's\ngeneral appearance was such as to lead one to suppose her the sincerest\nof persons. Now I am at a loss to account for a discrepancy between her\nwords and her actions.\"\n\nWhile I talked Miss Thorn's face had been gradually turning from mine\nuntil now I saw only the dainty knot at the back of her head. Her\nshoulders were quivering with laughter. But presently her face came back\nall gravity, save a suspicious gleam of mirth in the eyes.\n\n\"It does seem inconsistent, Mr. Crocker; I grant you that. No doubt it\nis so. But let me ask you something: did you ever yet know a woman who\nwas not inconsistent?\"\n\nI did not realize I had been side-tracked until I came to think over\nthis conversation afterwards.\n\n\"I am not sure,\" I replied. \"Perhaps I merely hoped that one such\nexisted.\"\n\nShe dropped her eyes.\n\n\"Then don't be surprised at my failing,\" said she. \"No doubt I\ncriticised the Celebrity severely. I cannot recall what I said. But it\nis upon the better side of a character that we must learn to look.\nDid it ever strike you that the Celebrity had some exceedingly fine\nqualities?\"\n\n\"No, it did not,\" I answered positively.\n\n\"Nevertheless, he has,\" she went on, in all apparent seriousness. \"He\ndrives almost as well as Uncle Farquhar, dances well, and is a capital\npaddle.\"\n\n\"You were speaking of qualities, not accomplishments,\" I said. A\nhorrible suspicion that she was having a little fun at my expense\ncrossed my mind.\n\n\"Very good, then. You must admit that he is generous to a fault, amiable;\nand persevering, else he would never have attained the position he\nenjoys. And his affection for you, Mr. Crocker, is really touching,\nconsidering how little he gets in return.\"\n\n\"Come, Miss Thorn,\" I said severely, \"this is ridiculous. I don't\nlike him, and never shall. I liked him once, before he took to writing\ndrivel. But he must have been made over since then. And what is more,\nwith all respect to your opinion, I don't believe he likes me.\"\n\nMiss Thorn straightened up with dignity and said:\n\n\"You do him an injustice. But perhaps you will learn to appreciate him\nbefore he leaves Mohair.\"\n\n\"That is not likely,\" I replied--not at all pleasantly, I fear. And\nagain I thought I observed in her the same desire to laugh she had\nbefore exhibited.\n\nAnd all the way back her talk was of nothing except the Celebrity. I\ntried every method short of absolute rudeness to change the subject,\nand went from silence to taciturnity and back again to silence.\nShe discussed his books and his mannerisms, even the growth of his\npopularity. She repeated anecdotes of him from Naples to St. Petersburg,\nfrom Tokio to Cape Town. And when we finally stopped under the porte\ncochere I had scarcely the civility left to say good-bye.\n\nI held out my hand to help her to the ground, but she paused on the\nsecond step.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" she observed archly, \"I believe you once told me you had\nnot known many girls in your life.\"\n\n\"True,\" I said; \"why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I wished to be sure of it,\" she replied.\n\nAnd jumping down without my assistance, she laughed and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME 3.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThat evening I lighted a cigar and went down to sit on the outermost\npile of the Asquith dock to commune with myself. To say that I was\ndisappointed in Miss Thorn would be to set a mild value on my feelings.\nI was angry, even aggressive, over her defence of the Celebrity. I had\ngone over to Mohair that day with a hope that some good reason was at\nthe bottom of her tolerance for him, and had come back without any hope.\nShe not only tolerated him, but, wonderful to be said, plainly liked\nhim. Had she not praised him, and defended him, and become indignant\nwhen I spoke my mind about him? And I would have taken my oath, two\nweeks before, that nothing short of hypnotic influence could have\nchanged her. By her own confession she had come to Asquith with her eyes\nopened, and, what was more, seen another girl wrecked on the same reef.\n\nFarrar followed me out presently, and I had an impulse to submit the\nproblem as it stood to him. But it was a long story, and I did not\nbelieve that if he were in my boots he would have consulted me. Again,\nI sometimes thought Farrar yearned for confidences, though it was\nimpossible for him to confide. And he wore an inviting air to-night.\nThen, as everybody knows, there is that about twilight and an\nafter-dinner cigar which leads to communication. They are excellent\nsolvents. My friend seated himself on the pile next to mine, and said,\n\n\"It strikes me you have been behaving rather queer lately, Crocker.\"\n\nThis was clearly an invitation from Farrar, and I melted.\n\n\"I admit,\" said I, \"that I am a good deal perplexed over the\ncontradictions of the human mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that all?\" he replied dryly. \"I supposed it was worse.\nNarrower, I mean. Didn't know you ever bothered yourself with abstract\nphilosophy.\"\n\n\"See here, Farrar,\" said I, \"what is your opinion of Miss Thorn?\"\n\nHe stopped kicking his feet against the pile and looked up.\n\n\"Miss Thorn?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Thorn,\" I repeated with emphasis. I knew he had in mind that\nabominable twaddle about the canoe excursions.\n\n\"Why, to tell the truth,\" said he, \"I never had any opinion of Miss\nThorn.\"\n\n\"You mean you never formed any, I suppose,\" I returned with some\ntartness.\n\n\"Yes, that is it. How darned precise you are getting, Crocker! One would\nthink you were going to write a rhetoric. What put Miss Thorn into your\nhead?\"\n\n\"I have been coaching beside her this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Farrar.\n\n\"Do you remember the night she came,\" I asked, \"and we sat with her on\nthe Florentine porch, and Charles Wrexell recognized her and came up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied with awakened interest, \"and I meant to ask you about\nthat.\"\n\n\"Miss Thorn had met him in the East. And I gathered from what she told\nme that he has followed her out here.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder,\" said Farrar. \"Don't much blame him, do you? Is that\nwhat troubles you?\" he asked, in surprise.\n\n\"Not precisely,\" I answered vaguely; \"but from what she has said then\nand since, she made it pretty clear that she hadn't any use for him; saw\nthrough him, you know.\"\n\n\"Pity her if she didn't. But what did she say?\"\n\nI repeated the conversations I had had with Miss Thorn, without\nrevealing Mr. Allen's identity with the celebrated author.\n\n\"That is rather severe,\" he assented.\n\n\"He decamped for Mohair, as you know, and since that time she has gone\nback on every word of it. She is with him morning and evening, and, to\ncrown all, stood up for him through thick and thin to-day, and praised\nhim. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\"What I should have expected in a woman,\" said he, nonchalantly.\n\n\"They aren't all alike,\" I retorted.\n\nHe shook out his pipe, and getting down from his high seat laid his hand\non my knee.\n\n\"I thought so once, old fellow,\" he whispered, and went off down the\ndock.\n\nThis was the nearest Farrar ever came to a confidence.\n\nI have now to chronicle a curious friendship which had its beginning\nat this time. The friendships of the other sex are quickly made, and\nsometimes as quickly dissolved. This one interested me more than I care\nto own. The next morning Judge Short, looking somewhat dejected after\nthe overnight conference he had had with his wife, was innocently and\nsomewhat ostentatiously engaged in tossing quoits with me in front of\nthe inn, when Miss Thorn drove up in a basket cart. She gave me a bow\nwhich proved that she bore no ill-will for that which I had said about\nher hero. Then Miss Trevor appeared, and away they went together. This\nwas the commencement. Soon the acquaintance became an intimacy, and\ntheir lives a series of visits to each other. Although this new state\nof affairs did not seem to decrease the number of Miss Thorn's\n'tete-a-tetes' with the Celebrity, it put a stop to the canoe\nexpeditions I had been in the habit of taking with Miss Trevor, which I\nthought just as well under the circumstances. More than once Miss Thorn\npartook of the inn fare at our table, and when this happened I would\nmake my escape before the coffee. For such was the nature of my feelings\nregarding the Celebrity that I could not bring myself into cordial\nrelations with one who professed to admire him. I realize how ridiculous\nsuch a sentiment must appear, but it existed nevertheless, and most\nstrongly.\n\nI tried hard to throw Miss Thorn out of my thoughts, and very\nnearly succeeded. I took to spending more and more of my time at the\ncounty-seat, where I remained for days at a stretch, inventing business\nwhen there was none. And in the meanwhile I lost all respect for myself\nas a sensible man, and cursed the day the Celebrity came into the state.\nIt seemed strange that this acquaintance of my early days should have\ncome back into my life, transformed, to make it more or less miserable.\nThe county-seat being several miles inland, and lying in the midst of\nhills, could get intolerably hot in September. At last I was driven out\nin spite of myself, and I arrived at Asquith cross and dusty. As Simpson\nwas brushing me off, Miss Trevor came up the path looking cool and\npretty in a summer gown, and her face expressed sympathy. I have never\ndenied that sympathy was a good thing.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Crocker,\" she cried, \"I am so glad you are back again! We have\nmissed you dreadfully. And you look tired, poor man, quite worn out. It\nis a shame you have to go over to that hot place to work.\"\n\nI agreed with her.\n\n\"And I never have any one to take me canoeing any more.\"\n\n\"Let's go now,\" I suggested, \"before dinner.\"\n\nSo we went. It was a keen pleasure to be on the lake again after the\nsultry court-rooms and offices, and the wind and exercise quickly\nbrought back my appetite and spirits. I paddled hither and thither,\nstopping now and then to lie under the pines at the mouth of some\nstream, while Miss Trevor talked. She was almost a child in her\neagerness to amuse me with the happenings since my departure. This was\nalways her manner with me, in curious contrast to her habit of fencing\nand playing with words when in company. Presently she burst out:\n\n\"Mr. Crocker, why is it that you avoid Miss Thorn? I was talking of you\nto her only to-day, and she says you go miles out of your way to get out\nof speaking to her; that you seemed to like her quite well at first. She\ncouldn't understand the change.\"\n\n\"Did she say that?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Indeed, she did; and I have noticed it, too. I saw you leave before\ncoffee more than once when she was here. I don't believe you know what a\nfine girl she is.\"\n\n\"Why, then, does she accept and return the attentions of the Celebrity?\"\nI inquired, with a touch of acidity. \"She knows what he is as well, if\nnot better, than you or I. I own I can't understand it,\" I said, the\nsubject getting ahead of me. \"I believe she is in love with him.\"\n\nMiss Trevor began to laugh; quietly at first, and, as her merriment\nincreased, heartily.\n\n\"Shouldn't we be getting back?\" I asked, looking at my watch. \"It lacks\nbut half an hour of dinner.\"\n\n\"Please don't be angry, Mr. Crocker,\" she pleaded. \"I really couldn't\nhelp laughing.\"\n\n\"I was unaware I had said anything funny, Miss Trevor,\" I replied.\n\n\"Of course you didn't,\" she said more soberly; \"that is, you didn't\nintend to. But the very notion of Miss Thorn in love with the Celebrity\nis funny.\"\n\n\"Evidence is stronger than argument,\" said I. \"And now she has even\nconvicted herself.\"\n\nI started to paddle homeward, rather furiously, and my companion said\nnothing until we came in sight of the inn. As the canoe glided into the\nsmooth surface behind the breakwater, she broke the silence.\n\n\"I heard you went fishing the other day,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the judge told me about a big bass you hooked, and how you played\nhim longer than was necessary for the mere fun of the thing.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will find in the feeling that prompted you to do that a\nclue to the character of our sex.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nMr. Cooke had had a sloop yacht built at Far Harbor, the completion\nof which had been delayed, and which was but just delivered. She was,\npainted white, with brass fittings, and under her stern, in big,\nblack letters, was the word Maria, intended as a surprise and delicate\nconjugal compliment to Mrs. Cooke. The Maria had a cabin, which was\nfinished in hard wood and yellow plush, and accommodations for keeping\nthings cold. This last Mr. Cooke had insisted upon.\n\nThe skipper Mr. Cooke had hired at Far Harbor was a God-fearing man with\na luke warm interest in his new billet and employer, and had only been\nprevailed upon to take charge of the yacht for the month after the offer\nof an emolument equal to half a year's sea pay of an ensign in the navy.\nHis son and helper was to receive a sum proportionally exorbitant.\nThis worthy man sighted Mohair on a Sunday morning, and at nine\no'clock dropped his anchor with a salute which caused Mr. Cooke to\nsay unpleasant things in his sleep. After making things ship-shape and\nhoisting the jack, both father and son rowed ashore to the little church\nat Asquith.\n\nNow the butler at Mohair was a servant who had learned, from long\nexperience, to anticipate every wish and whim of his master, and from\nthe moment he descried the white sails of the yacht out of the windows\nof the butler's pantry his duty was clear as daylight. Such was the\ncomprehension and despatch with which he gave his commands that the\ncaptain returned from divine worship to find the Maria in profane hands,\nher immaculate deck littered with straw and sawdust, and covered to the\ncoamings with bottles and cases. This decided the captain, he packed\nhis kit in high dudgeon, and took the first train back to Far Harbor,\nleaving the yacht to her fate.\n\nThis sudden and inconsiderate departure was a severe blow to Mr. Cooke'\nwho was so constituted that he cared but little about anything until\nthere was danger of not getting it. My client had planned a trip to Bear\nIsland for the following Tuesday, which was to last a week, the party to\nbring tents with them and rough it, with the Maria as headquarters. It\nwas out of the question to send to Far Harbor for another skipper, if,\nindeed, one could be found at that late period. And as luck would have\nit, six of Mr. Cooke's ten guests had left but a day or so since, and\namong them had been the only yacht-owner. None of the four that remained\ncould do more than haul aft and belay a sheet. But the Celebrity, who\nchanced along as Mr. Cooke was ruefully gazing at the graceful lines of\nthe Maria from the wharf and cursing the fate that kept him ashore with\na stiff wind blowing, proposed a way out of the difficulty. He, the\nCelebrity, would gladly sail the Maria over to Bear Island provided\nanother man could be found to relieve him occasionally at the wheel, and\nthe like. He had noticed that Farrar was a capable hand in a boat, and\nsuggested that he be sent for.\n\nThis suggestion Mr. Cooke thought so well of that he hurried over to\nAsquith to consult Farrar at once, and incidentally to consult me.\nWe can hardly be blamed for receiving his overtures with a moderate\nenthusiasm. In fact, we were of one mind not to go when the subject was\nfirst broached. But my client had a persuasive way about him that was\nirresistible, and the mere mention of the favors he had conferred\nupon both of us at different periods of our lives was sufficient. We\nconsented.\n\nThus it came to pass that Tuesday morning found the party assembled on\nthe wharf at Mohair, the Four and the Celebrity, as well as Mr. Cooke,\nhaving produced yachting suits from their inexhaustible wardrobes.\nMr. Trevor and his daughter, Mrs. Cooke and Miss Thorn, and Farrar\nand myself completed the party. We were to adhere strictly to primeval\nprinciples: the ladies were not permitted a maid, while the Celebrity\nwas forced to leave his manservant, and Mr. Cooke his chef. I had,\nhowever, thrust into my pocket the Minneapolis papers, which had been\nhanded me by the clerk on their arrival at the inn, which happened just\nas I was leaving. 'Quod bene notandum!'\n\nThereby hangs a tale!\n\nFor the northern lakes the day was rather dead: a little wind lay in the\nsoutheast, scarcely enough to break the water, with the sky an intense\nblue. But the Maria was hardly cast and under way before it became\npainfully apparent that the Celebrity was much better fitted to lead\na cotillon than to sail a boat. He gave his orders, nevertheless, in\na firm, seamanlike fashion, though with no great pertinence, and thus\nmanaged to establish the confidence of Mr. Cooke. Farrar, after setting\nthings to rights, joined Mrs. Cooke and me over the cabin.\n\n\"How about hoisting the spinnaker, mate?\" the Celebrity shouted after\nhim.\n\nFarrar did not deign to answer: his eye was on the wind. And the boom,\nwhich had been acting uneasily, finally decided to gybe, and swept\nmajestically over, carrying two of the Four in front of it, and all but\ndropped them into the water.\n\n\"A common occurrence in a light breeze,\" we heard the Celebrity reassure\nMr. Cooke and Miss Thorn.\n\n\"The Maria has vindicated her sex,\" remarked Farrar.\n\nWe laughed.\n\n\"Why don't you sail, Mr. Farrar?\" asked Mrs. Cooke.\n\n\"He can't do any harm in this breeze,\" Farrar replied; \"it isn't strong\nenough to get anywhere with.\"\n\nHe was right. The boom gybed twenty times that morning, and the\nCelebrity offered an equal number of apologies. Mr. Cooke and the Four\nvanished, and from the uproarious laughter which arose from the cabin\ntransoms I judged they were telling stories. While Miss Thorn spent the\ntime profitably in learning how to conn a yacht. At one, when we had\nluncheon, Mohair was still in the distance. At two it began to cloud\nover, the wind fell flat, and an ominous black bank came up from the\nsouth. Without more ado, Farrar, calling on me to give him a hand, eased\ndown the halliards and began to close reef the mainsail.\n\n\"Hold on,\" said the Celebrity, \"who told you to do that?\"\n\n\"I am very sure you didn't,\" Farrar returned, as he hauled out a reef\nearing.\n\nHere a few drops of rain on the deck warned the ladies to retire to the\ncabin.\n\n\"Take the helm until I get my mackintosh, will you, Farrar?\" said the\nCelebrity, \"and be careful what you do.\"\n\nFarrar took the helm and hauled in the sheet, while the Celebrity, Mr.\nCooke, and the guests donned their rain-clothes. The water ahead was\nnow like blue velvet, and the rain pelting. The Maria was heeling to the\nsquall by the time the Celebrity appeared at the cabin door, enveloped\nin an ample waterproof, a rubber cover on his yachting cap. A fool\ndespises a danger he has never experienced, and our author, with a\nremark about a spanking breeze, made a motion to take the wheel. But\nFarrar, the flannel of his shirt clinging to the muscular outline of\nhis shoulders, gave him a push which sent him sprawling against the lee\nrefrigerator. Well Miss Thorn was not there to see.\n\n\"You will have to answer for this,\" he cried, as he scrambled to his\nfeet and clutched the weather wash-board with one hand, while he shook\nthe other in Farrar's face.\n\n\"Crocker,\" said Farrar to me, coolly, \"keep that idiot out of the way\nfor a while, or we'll all be drowned. Tie him up, if necessary.\"\n\nI was relieved from this somewhat unpleasant task. Mr. Cooke, with his\nback to the rain, sat an amused witness to the mutiny, as blissfully\nignorant as the Celebrity of the character of a lake squall.\n\n\"I appeal to you, as the owner of this yacht, Mr. Cooke,\" the Celebrity\nshouted, \"whether, as the person delegated by you to take charge of it,\nI am to suffer indignity and insult. I have sailed larger yachts than\nthis time and again on the coast, at--\" here he swallowed a portion of a\nwave and was mercifully prevented from being specific.\n\nBut Mr. Cooke was looking a trifle bewildered. It was hardly possible\nfor him to cling to the refrigerator, much less quell a mutiny. One who\nhas sailed the lakes well knows how rapidly they can be lashed to fury\nby a storm, and the wind was now spinning the tops of the waves into a\nblinding spray. Although the Maria proved a stiff boat and a seaworthy,\nshe was not altogether without motion; and the set expression on\nFarrar's face would have told me, had I not known it, that our situation\nat that moment was no joke. Repeatedly, as she was held up to it, a\nprecocious roller would sweep from bow to stern, until we without coats\nwere wet and shivering.\n\nThe close and crowded cabin of a small yacht is not an attractive\nplace in rough weather; and one by one the Four emerged and distributed\nthemselves about the deck, wherever they could obtain a hold. Some\nof them began to act peculiarly. Upon Mr. Cooke's unwillingness or\ninability to interfere in his behalf, the Celebrity had assumed an\naggrieved demeanor, but soon the motion of the Maria became more and\nmore pronounced, and the difficulty of maintaining his decorum likewise\nincreased. The ruddy color left his face, which grew pale with effort.\nI will do him the justice to say that the effort was heroic: he whistled\npopular airs, and snatches of the grand opera; he relieved Mr. Cooke of\nhis glasses (of which Mr. Cooke had neglected to relieve himself), and\nscanned the sea line busily. But the inevitable deferred is frequently\nmore violent than the inevitable taken gracefully, and the confusion\nwhich at length overtook the Celebrity was utter as his humiliation was\ncomplete. We laid him beside Mr. Cooke in the cockpit.\n\nThe rain presently ceased, and the wind hauled, as is often the case,\nto the northwest, which began to clear, while Bear Island rose from the\nnorthern horizon. Both Farrar and I were surprised to see Miss Trevor\ncome out; she hooked back the cabin doors and surveyed the prostrate\nforms with amusement.\n\nWe asked her about those inside.\n\n\"Mrs. Cooke has really been very ill,\" she said, \"and Miss Thorn is\ndoing all she can for her. My father and I were more fortunate. But you\nwill both catch your deaths,\" she exclaimed, noticing our condition.\n\"Tell me where I can find your coats.\"\n\nI suppose it is natural for a man to enjoy being looked after in this\nway; it was certainly a new sensation to Farrar and myself. We assured\nher we were drying out and did not need the coats, but nevertheless she\nwent back into the cabin and found them.\n\n\"Miss Thorn says you should both be whipped,\" she remarked.\n\nWhen we had put on our coats Miss Trevor sat down and began to talk.\n\n\"I once heard of a man,\" she began complacently, \"a man that was\nburied alive, and who contrived to dig himself up and then read his own\nepitaph. It did not please him, but he was wise and amended his life. I\nhave often thought how much it might help some people if they could read\ntheir own epitaphs.\"\n\nFarrar was very quick at this sort of thing; and now that the steering\nhad become easier was only too glad to join her in worrying the\nCelebrity. But he, if he were conscious, gave no sign of it.\n\n\"They ought to be buried so that they could not dig themselves up,\" he\nsaid. \"The epitaphs would only strengthen their belief that they had\nlived in an unappreciative age.\"\n\n\"One I happen to have in mind, however, lives in an appreciative age.\nMost appreciative.\"\n\n\"And women are often epitaph-makers.\"\n\n\"You are hard on the sex, Mr. Farrar,\" she answered, \"but perhaps\njustly so. And yet there are some women I know of who would not write an\nepitaph to his taste.\"\n\nFarrar looked at her curiously.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said.\n\n\"Do not imagine I am touchy on the subject,\" she replied quickly; \"some\nof us are fortunate enough to have had our eyes opened.\"\n\nI thought the Celebrity stirred uneasily.\n\n\"Have you read The Sybarites?\" she asked.\n\nFarrar was puzzled.\n\n\"No,\" said he sententiously, \"and I don't want to.\"\n\n\"I know the average man thinks it a disgrace to have read it. And you\nmay not believe me when I say that it is a strong story of its kind,\nwith a strong moral. There are men who might read that book and be a\ngreat deal better for it. And, if they took the moral to heart, it would\nprove every bit as effectual as their own epitaphs.\"\n\nHe was not quite sure of her drift, but he perceived that she was still\nmaking fun of Mr. Allen.\n\n\"And the moral?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"the best I can do is to give you a synopsis of the\nstory, and then you can judge of its fitness. The hero is called Victor\nDesmond. He is a young man of a sterling though undeveloped character,\nwho has been hampered by an indulgent parent with a large fortune.\nDesmond is a butterfly, and sips life after the approved manner of his\nkind,--now from Bohemian glass, now from vessels of gold and silver. He\nchats with stage lights in their dressing-rooms, and attends a ball in\nthe Bowery or a supper at Sherry's with a ready versatility. The book,\napart from its intention, really gives the middle classes an excellent\nidea of what is called 'high-life.'\n\n\"It is some time before Desmond discovers that he possesses the gift of\nParis,--a deliberation proving his lack of conceit,--that wherever he\ngoes he unwittingly breaks a heart, and sometimes two or three. This\ndiscovery is naturally so painful that he comes home to his chambers and\nthrows himself on a lounge before his fire in a fit of self-deprecation,\nand reflects on a misspent and foolish life. This, mind you, is where\nhis character starts to develop. And he makes a heroic resolve, not to\ncut off his nose or to grow a beard, nor get married, but henceforth\nto live a life of usefulness and seclusion, which was certainly\nconsiderate. And furthermore, if by any accident he ever again involved\nthe affections of another girl he would marry her, be she as ugly as sin\nor as poor as poverty. Then the heroine comes in. Her name is Rosamond,\nwhich sounds well and may be euphoniously coupled with Desmond; and,\nwith the single exception of a boarding-school girl, she is the only\nyoung woman he ever thought of twice. In order to save her and himself\nhe goes away, but the temptation to write to her overpowers him, and\nof course she answers his letter. This brings on a correspondence.\nHis letters take the form of confessions, and are the fruits of much\nphilosophical reflection. 'Inconstancy in woman,' he says, because of\nthe present social conditions, is often pardonable. In a man, nothing\nis more despicable.' This is his cardinal principle, and he sticks to\nit nobly. For, though he tires of Rosamond, who is quite attractive,\nhowever, he marries her and lives a life of self-denial. There are men\nwho might take that story to heart.\"\n\nI was amused that she should give the passage quoted by the Celebrity\nhimself. Her double meaning was, naturally, lost on Farrar, but he\nenjoyed the thing hugely, nevertheless, as more or less applicable to\nMr. Allen. I made sure that gentleman was sensible of what was being\nsaid, though he scarcely moved a muscle. And Miss Trevor, with a\nmirthful glance at me that was not without a tinge of triumph, jumped\nlightly to the deck and went in to see the invalids.\n\nWe were now working up into the lee of the island, whose tall pines\nstood clean and black against the red glow of the evening sky. Mr. Cooke\nbegan to give evidences of life, and finally got up and overhauled one\nof the ice-chests for a restorative. Farrar put into the little cove,\nwhere we dropped anchor, and soon had the chief sufferers ashore; and\na delicate supper, in the preparation of which Miss Thorn showed her\nability as a cook, soon restored them. For my part, I much preferred\nMiss Thorn's dishes to those of the Mohair chef, and so did Farrar. And\nthe Four, surprising as it may seem, made themselves generally useful\nabout the camp in pitching the tents under Farrar's supervision. But the\nCelebrity remained apart and silent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOur first, night in the Bear Island camp passed without incident, and we\nall slept profoundly, tired out by the labors of the day before. After\nbreakfast, the Four set out to explore, with trout-rods and shot-guns.\nBear Island is, with the exception of the cove into which we had put, as\nnearly round as an island can be, and perhaps three miles in diameter.\nIt has two clear brooks which, owing to the comparative inaccessibility\nof the place, still contain trout and grayling, though there are few\nspots where a fly can be cast on account of the dense underbrush. The\nwoods contain partridge, or ruffed grouse, and other game in smaller\nquantities. I believe my client entertained some notion of establishing\na preserve here.\n\nThe insults which had been heaped upon the Celebrity on the yacht seemed\nto have raised rather than lowered him in Miss Thorn's esteem, for these\ntwo ensconced themselves among the pines above the camp with an edition\nde luxe of one of his works which she had brought along. They were soon\nabsorbed in one of those famous short stories of his with the ending\nleft open to discussion. Mr. Cooke was indisposed. He had not yet\nrecovered from the shaking up his system had sustained, and he took to\na canvas easy chair he had brought with him and placed a decanter of\nScotch and a tumbler of ice at his side. The efficacy of this remedy\nwas assured. And he demanded the bunch of newspapers he spied protruding\nfrom my pocket.\n\nThe rest of us were engaged in various occupations: Mr. Trevor relating\nexperiences of steamboat days on the Ohio to Mrs. Cooke; Miss Trevor\nburied in a serial in the Century; and Farrar and I taking an\ninventory of fishing-tackle, when we were startled by a loud and profane\nejaculation. Mr. Cooke had hastily put down his glass and was staring at\nthe newspaper before him with eyes as large as after-dinner coffee-cups.\n\n\"Come here,\" he shouted over at us. \"Come here, Crocker,\" he repeated,\nseeing we were slow to move. \"For God's sake, come here!\"\n\nIn obedience to this emphatic summons I crossed the stream and drew near\nto Mr. Cooke, who was busily pouring out another glass of whiskey to\ntide him over this strange excitement. But, as Mr. Cooke was easily\nexcited and on such occasions always drank whiskey to quiet his nerves,\nI thought nothing of it. He was sitting bolt upright and held out the\npaper to me with a shaking hand, while he pointed to some headlines on\nthe first page. And this is what I read:\n\n            TREASURER TAKES A TRIP.\n\n       CHARLES WREXELL ALLEN, OF THE MILES STANDISH\n      BICYCLE COMPANY, GETS OFF WITH 100,000 DOLLARS.\n\n             DETECTIVES BAFFLED.\n\n        THE ABSCONDER A BACK BAY SOCIAL LEADER.\n\nHalf way down the column was a picture of Mr. Allen, a cut made from a\nphotograph, and, allowing for the crudities of newspaper reproduction,\nit was a striking likeness of the Celebrity. Underneath was a short\ndescription. Mr. Allen was five feet eleven (the Celebrity's height),\nhad a straight nose, square chin, dark hair and eyes, broad shoulders,\nwas dressed elaborately; in brief, tallied in every particular with the\nCelebrity with the exception of the slight scar which Allen was thought\nto have on his forehead.\n\nThe situation and all its ludicrous possibilities came over me with a\njump. It was too good to be true. Had Mr. Charles Wrexell Allen arrived\nat Asquith and created a sensation with the man who stole his name I\nshould have been amply satisfied. But that Mr. Allen had been obliging\nenough to abscond with a large sum of money was beyond dreaming!\n\nI glanced at the rest of it: a history of the well-established company\nfollowed, with all that Mr. Allen had done for it. The picture, by the\nway, had been obtained from the St. Paul agent of the bicycle. After\ndoing due credit to the treasurer's abilities as a hustler there\nfollowed a summary of his character, hitherto without reproach; but his\ntastes were expensive ones. Mr. Allen's tendency to extravagance had\nbeen noticed by the members of the Miles Standish Company, and some of\nthe older directors had on occasions remonstrated with him. But he had\nbeen too valuable a man to let go, and it seems as treasurer he was\ntrusted implicitly. He was said to have more clothes than any man in\nBoston.\n\nI am used to thinking quickly, and by the time I had read this I had an\nidea.\n\n\"What in hell do you make of that, Crocker?\" cried my client, eyeing me\nclosely and repeating the question again and again, as was his wont when\nagitated.\n\n\"It is certainly plain enough,\" I replied, \"but I should like to talk to\nyou before you decide to hand him over to the authorities.\"\n\nI thought I knew Mr. Cooke, and I was not mistaken.\n\n\"Authorities!\" he roared. \"Damn the authorities! There's my yacht, and\nthere's the Canadian border.\" And he pointed to the north.\n\nThe others were pressing around us by this time, and had caught the\nsignificant words which Mr. Cooke had uttered. I imagine that if my\nclient had stopped to think twice, which of course is a preposterous\ncondition, he would have confided his discovery only to Farrar and\nto me. It was now out of the question to keep it from the rest of the\nparty, and Mr. Trevor got the headlines over my shoulder. I handed him\nthe sheet.\n\n\"Read it, Mr. Trevor,\" said Mrs. Cooke.\n\nMr. Trevor, in a somewhat unsteady voice, read the headlines and\nbegan the column, and they followed breathless with astonishment and\nagitation. Once or twice the senator paused to frown upon the Celebrity\nwith a terrible sternness, thus directing all other eyes to him. His\ndemeanor was a study in itself. It may be surmised, from what I have\nsaid of him, that there was a strain of the actor in his composition;\nand I am prepared to make an affidavit that, secure in the knowledge\nthat he had witnesses present to attest his identity, he hugely enjoyed\nthe sensation he was creating. That he looked forward with a profound\npleasure to the stir which the disclosure that he was the author of The\nSybarites would make. His face wore a beatific smile.\n\nAs Mr. Trevor continued, his voice became firmer and his manner more\nmajestic. It was a task distinctly to his taste, and one might have\nthought he was reading the sentence of a Hastings. I was standing next\nto his daughter. The look of astonishment, perhaps of horror, which I\nhad seen on her face when her father first began to read had now faded\ninto something akin to wickedness. Did she wink? I can't say, never\nbefore having had a young woman wink at me. But the next moment her\nvinaigrette was rolling down the bank towards the brook, and I was after\nit. I heard her close behind me. She must have read my intentions by a\nkind of mental telepathy.\n\n\"Are you going to do it?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered. \"To miss such a chance would be a downright\nsin.\"\n\nThere was a little awe in her laugh.\n\n\"Miss Thorn is the only obstacle,\" I added, \"and Mr. Cooke is our hope.\nI think he will go by me.\"\n\n\"Don't let Miss Thorn worry you,\" she said as we climbed back.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I demanded. But she only shook her head. We were\nat the top again, and Mr. Trevor was reading an appended despatch from\nBuffalo, stating that Mr. Allen had been recognized there, in the latter\npart of June, walking up and down the platform of the station, in a\nsmoking-jacket, and that he had climbed on the Chicago limited as\nit pulled out. This may have caused the Celebrity to feel a trifle\nuncomfortable.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Mr. Trevor, as he put down the paper. \"Mr. Cooke, do you\nhappen to have any handcuffs on the Maria?\"\n\nBut my client was pouring out a stiff helping from the decanter, which\nhe still held in his hand. Then he approached the Celebrity.\n\n\"Don't let it worry you, old man,\" said he, with intense earnestness.\n\"Don't let it worry you. You're my guest, and I'll see you safe out of\nit, or bust.\"\n\n\"Fenelon,\" said Mrs. Cooke, gravely, \"do you realize what you are\nsaying?\"\n\n\"You're a clever one, Allen,\" my client continued, and he backed away\nthe better to look him over; \"you had nerve to stay as long as you did.\"\n\nThe Celebrity laughed confidently.\n\n\"Cooke,\" he replied, \"I appreciate your generosity,--I really do. I know\nno offence is meant. The mistake is, in fact, most pardonable.\"\n\nIn Mr. Cooke amazement and admiration were clamoring for utterance.\n\n\"Damn me,\" he sputtered, \"if you're not the coolest embezzler I ever\nsaw.\"\n\nThe Celebrity laughed again. Then he surveyed the circle.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"this is certainly a most amazing coincidence;\none which, I assure you, surprises me no less than it does you. You have\nno doubt remarked that I have my peculiarities. We all have.\n\n\"I flatter thyself I am not entirely unknown. And the annoyances imposed\nupon me by a certain fame I have achieved had become such that some\nmonths ago I began to crave the pleasures of the life of a private\nman. I determined to go to some sequestered resort where my face was\nunfamiliar. The possibility of being recognized at Asquith did not occur\nto me. Fortunately I was. And a singular chance led me to take the name\nof the man who has committed this crime, and who has the misfortune to\nresemble me. I suppose that now,\" he added impressively, \"I shall have\nto tell you who I am.\"\n\nHe paused until these words should have gained their full effect. Then\nhe held up the edition de luxe from which he and Miss Thorn had been\nreading.\n\n\"You may have heard, Mrs. Cooke,\" said he, addressing himself to our\nhostess, \"you may perhaps have heard of the author of this book.\"\n\nMrs. Cooke was a calm woman, and she read the name on the cover.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I have. And you claim to be he?\"\n\n\"Ask my friend Crocker here,\" he answered carelessly, no doubt exulting\nthat the scene was going off so dramatically. \"I should indeed be in a\ntight box,\" he went on, \"if there were not friends of mine here to help\nme out.\"\n\nThey turned to me.\n\n\"I am afraid I cannot,\" I said with what soberness I could.\n\n\"What!\" says he with a start. \"What! you deny me?\"\n\nMiss Trevor had her tongue in her cheek. I bowed.\n\n\"I am powerless to speak, Mr. Allen,\" I replied.\n\nDuring this colloquy my client stood between us, looking from one to the\nother. I well knew that his way of thinking would be with my testimony,\nand that the gilt name on the edition de luxe had done little towards\nconvincing him of Mr. Allen's innocence. To his mind there was nothing\nhorrible or incongruous in the idea that a well-known author should be\na defaulter. It was perfectly possible. He shoved the glass of Scotch\ntowards the Celebrity, with a smile.\n\n\"Take this, old man,\" he kindly insisted, \"and you'll feel better.\nWhat's the use of bucking when you're saddled with a thing like that?\"\nAnd he pointed to the paper. \"Besides, they haven't caught you yet, by a\ndamned sight.\"\n\nThe Celebrity waved aside the proffered tumbler.\n\n\"This is an infamous charge, and you know it, Crocker,\" he cried. \"If\nyou don't, you ought to, as a lawyer. This isn't any time to have fun\nwith a fellow.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" I said, \"I have charged you with nothing whatever.\"\n\nHe turned his back on me in complete disgust. And he came face to face\nwith Miss Trevor.\n\n\"Miss Trevor, too, knows something of me,\" he said.\n\n\"You forget, Mr. Allen,\" she answered sweetly, \"you forget that I have\ngiven you my promise not to reveal what I know.\"\n\nThe Celebrity chafed, for this was as damaging a statement as could well\nbe uttered against him. But Miss Thorn was his trump card, and she now\ncame forward.\n\n\"This is ridiculous, Mr. Crocker, simply ridiculous,\" said she.\n\n\"I agree with you most heartily, Miss Thorn,\" I replied.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Miss Thorn, and she drew her lips together, \"pure\nnonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense or not, Marian,\" Mr. Cooke interposed, \"we are wasting\nvaluable time. The police are already on the scent, I'll bet my hat.\"\n\n\"Fenelon!\" Mrs. Cooke remonstrated.\n\n\"And do you mean to say in soberness, Uncle Fenelon, that you believe\nthe author of The Sybarites to be a defaulter?\" said Miss Thorn.\n\n\"It is indeed hard to believe Mr. Allen a criminal,\" Mr. Trevor broke in\nfor the first time. \"I think it only right that he should be allowed\nto clear himself before he is put to further inconvenience, and perhaps\ninjustice, by any action we may take in the matter.\"\n\nMr. Cooke sniffed suspiciously at the word \"action.\"\n\n\"What action do you mean?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Trevor, with some hesitation, \"before we take any\nsteps, that is, notify the police.\"\n\n\"Notify the police!\" cried my client, his face red with a generous\nanger. \"I have never yet turned a guest over to the police,\" he said\nproudly, \"and won't, not if I know it. I'm not that kind.\"\n\nWho shall criticise Mr. Cooke's code of morality?\n\n\"Fenelon,\" said his wife, \"you must remember you have never yet\nentertained a guest of a larcenous character. No embezzlers up to the\npresent. Marian,\" she continued, turning to Miss Thorn, \"you spoke as\nif you might, be able to throw some light upon this matter. Do you know\nwhether this gentleman is Charles Wrexell Allen, or whether he is the\nauthor? In short, do you know who he is?\"\n\nThe Celebrity lighted a cigarette. Miss Thorn said indignantly, \"Upon my\nword, Aunt Maria, I thought that you, at least, would know better than\nto credit this silly accusation. He has been a guest at your house, and\nI am astonished that you should doubt his word.\"\n\nMrs. Cooke looked at her niece perplexedly.\n\n\"You must remember, Marian,\" she said gently, \"that I know nothing about\nhim, where he came from, or who he is. Nor does any one at Asquith,\nexcept perhaps Miss Trevor, by her own confession. And you do not seem\ninclined to tell what you know, if indeed you know anything.\"\n\nUpon this Miss Thorn became more indignant still, and Mrs. Cooke went on\n\"Gentlemen, as a rule, do not assume names, especially other people's.\nThey are usually proud of their own. Mr. Allen appears among us, from\nthe clouds, as it were, and in due time we learn from a newspaper that\nhe has committed a defalcation. And, furthermore, the paper contains a\nportrait and an accurate description which put the thing beyond doubt. I\nask you, is it reasonable for him to state coolly after all this that he\nis another man? That he is a well-known author? It's an absurdity. I was\nnot born yesterday, my dear.\"\n\n\"It is most reasonable under the circumstances,\" replied Miss Thorn,\nwarmly. \"Extraordinary? Of course it's extraordinary. And too long to\nexplain to a prejudiced audience, who can't be expected to comprehend\nthe character of a genius, to understand the yearning of a famous man\nfor a little quiet.\"\n\nMrs. Cooke looked grave.\n\n\"Marian, you forget yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, I am tired of it, Aunt Maria,\" cried Miss Thorn; \"if he takes my\nadvice, he will refuse to discuss it farther.\"\n\nShe did not seem to be aware that she had put forth no argument\nwhatever, save a woman's argument. And I was intensely surprised that\nher indignation should have got the better of her in this way, having\nalways supposed her clear-headed in the extreme. A few words from her,\nsuch as I supposed she would have spoken, had set the Celebrity right\nwith all except Mr. Cooke. To me it was a clear proof that the Celebrity\nhad turned her head, and her mind with it.\n\nThe silence was broken by an uncontrollable burst of laughter from Miss\nTrevor. She was quickly frowned down by her father, who reminded her\nthat this was not a comedy.\n\n\"And, Mr. Allen,\" he said, \"if you have anything to say, or any evidence\nto bring forward, now is the time to do it.\"\n\nHe appeared to forget that I was the district attorney.\n\nThe Celebrity had seated himself on the trunk of a tree, and was blowing\nout the smoke in clouds. He was inclined to take Miss Thorn's advice,\nfor he made a gesture of weariness with his cigarette, in the use of\nwhich he was singularly eloquent.\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Trevor,\" said he, \"why I should sit before you as a\ntribunal? Why I should take the trouble to clear myself of a senseless\ncharge? My respect for you inclines me to the belief that you are\nlaboring under a momentary excitement; for when you reflect that I am a\nprominent, not to say famous, author, you will realize how absurd it is\nthat I should be an embezzler, and why I decline to lower myself by an\nexplanation.\"\n\nMr. Trevor picked up the paper and struck it.\n\n\"Do you refuse to say anything in the face of such evidence as that?\" he\ncried.\n\n\"It is not a matter for refusal, Mr. Trevor. It is simply that I cannot\nadmit the possibility of having committed the crime.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the senator, his black necktie working out of place\nas his anger got the better of him, \"I am to believe, then, because you\nclaim to be the author of a few society novels, that you are infallible?\nLet me tell you that the President of the United States himself is\nliable to impeachment, and bound to disprove any charge he may be\naccused of. What in Halifax do I care for your divine-right-of-authors\ntheory? I'll continue to think you guilty until you are shown to be\ninnocent.\"\n\nSuddenly the full significance of the Celebrity's tactics struck Mr.\nCooke, and he reached out and caught hold of Mr. Trevor's coattails.\n\"Hold on, old man,\" said he; \"Allen isn't going to be ass enough to own\nup to it. Don't you see we'd all be jugged and fined for assisting a\ncriminal over the border? It's out of consideration for us.\"\n\nMr. Trevor looked sternly over his shoulder at Mr. Cooke.\n\n\"Do you mean to say, sir, seriously,\" he asked, \"that, for the sake of\na misplaced friendship for this man, and a misplaced sense of honor,\nyou are bound to shield a guest, though a criminal? That you intend to\nassist him to escape from justice? I insist, for my own protection and\nthat of my daughter, as well as for that of the others present that,\nsince he refuses to speak, we must presume him guilty and turn him\nover.\"\n\nMr. Trevor turned to Mrs. Cooke, as if relying on her support.\n\n\"Fenelon,\" said she, \"I have never sought to influence your actions when\nyour friends were concerned, and I shall not begin now. All I ask of you\nis to consider the consequences of your intention.\"\n\nThese words from Mrs. Cooke had much more weight with my client than Mr.\nTrevor's blustering demands.\n\n\"Maria, my dear,\" he said, with a deferential urbanity, \"Mr. Allen is my\nguest, and a gentleman. When a gentleman gives his word that he is not a\ncriminal, it is sufficient.\"\n\nThe force of this, for some reason, did not overwhelm his wife; and her\nlip curled a little, half in contempt, half in risibility.\n\n\"Pshaw, Fenelon,\" said she, \"what a fraud you are. Why is it you wish to\nget Mr. Allen over the border, then?\" A question which might well have\nstaggered a worthier intellect.\n\n\"Why, my dear,\" answered my client, \"I wish to save Mr. Allen the\ninconvenience, not to say the humiliation, of being brought East in\ncustody and strapped with a pair of handcuffs. Let him take a shooting\ntrip to the great Northwest until the real criminal is caught.\"\n\n\"Well, Fenelon,\" replied Mrs. Cooke, unable to repress a smile, \"one\nmight as well try to argue with a turn-stile or a weather-vane. I wash\nmy hands of it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trevor, who was both a self-made man and a Western politician,\nwas far from being satisfied. He turned to me with a sweep of the arm he\nhad doubtless learned in the Ohio State Senate.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" he cried, \"are you, as attorney of this district, going\nto aid and abet in the escape of a fugitive from justice?\"\n\n\"Mr. Trevor,\" said I, \"I will take the course in this matter which seems\nfit to me, and without advice from any one.\"\n\nHe wheeled on Farrar, repeated the question, and got a like answer.\n\nBrought to bay for a time, he glared savagely around him while groping\nfor further arguments.\n\nBut at this point the Four appeared on the scene, much the worse for\nthickets, and clamoring for luncheon. They had five small fish between\nthem which they wanted Miss Thorn to cook.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Four received Mr. Cooke's plan for the Celebrity's escape to Canada\nwith enthusiastic acclamation, and as the one thing lacking to make the\nBear Island trip a complete success. The Celebrity was hailed with the\nreverence due to the man who puts up the ring-money in a prize-fight. He\nwas accorded, too, a certain amount of respect as a defaulter, which the\nFour would have denied him as an author, for I am inclined to the belief\nthat the discovery of his literary profession would have lowered him\nrather than otherwise in their eyes. My client was naturally anxious to\nget under way at once for the Canadian border, but was overruled in\nthis by his henchmen, who demanded something to eat. We sat down to an\nimpromptu meal, which was an odd affair indeed. Mrs. Cooke maintained\nher usual serenity, but said little, while Miss Trevor and I had many a\nmirthful encounter at the thought of the turn matters had taken.\n\nAt the other end of the cloth were Mr. Cooke and the Four, in wonderful\nspirits and unimpaired appetite, and in their midst sat the Celebrity,\nlikewise in wonderful spirits. His behavior now and again elicited a\nloud grunt of disapproval from Mr. Trevor, who was plying his knife and\nfork in a manner emblematic of his state of mind. Mr. Allen was laughing\nand joking airily with Mr. Cooke and the guests, denying, but not\nresenting, their accusations with all the sang froid of a hardened\ncriminal. He did not care particularly to go to Canada, he said. Why\nshould he, when he was innocent? But, if Mr. Cooke insisted, he would\nenjoy seeing that part of the lake and the Canadian side.\n\nAfterwards I perceived Miss Thorn down by the brookside, washing dishes.\nHer sleeves were drawn back to the elbow, and a dainty white apron\ncovered her blue skirt, while the wind from the lake had disentangled\nerrant wisps of her hair. I stood on the brink above, secure, as I\nthought, from observation, when she chanced to look up and spied me.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" she called, \"would you like to make yourself useful?\"\n\nI was decidedly embarrassed. Her manner was as frank and unconstrained\nas though I had not been shunning her for weeks past.\n\n\"If such a thing is possible,\" I replied.\n\n\"Do you know a dish-cloth when you see one?\"\n\nI was doubtful. But I procured the cloth from Miss Trevor and returned.\nThere was an air about Miss Thorn that was new to me.\n\n\"What an uncompromising man you are, Mr. Crocker,\" she said to me. \"Once\na person is unfortunate enough to come under the ban of your disapproval\nyou have nothing whatever to do with them. Now it seems that I have\ngiven you offence in some way. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"You magnify my importance,\" I said.\n\n\"No temporizing, Mr. Crocker,\" she went on, as though she meant to be\nobeyed; \"sit down there, and let's have it out. I like you too well to\nquarrel with you.\"\n\nThere was no resisting such a command, and I threw myself on the pebbles\nat her feet.\n\n\"I thought we were going to be great friends,\" she said. \"You and Mr.\nFarrar were so kind to me on the night of my arrival, and we had such\nfun watching the dance together.\"\n\n\"I confess I thought so, too. But you expressed opinions then that\nI shared. You have since changed your mind, for some unaccountable\nreason.\"\n\nShe paused in her polishing, a shining dish in her hand, and looked down\nat me with something between a laugh and a frown.\n\n\"I suppose you have never regretted speaking hastily,\" she said.\n\n\"Many a time,\" I returned, warming; \"but if I ever thought a judgment\nmeasured and distilled, it was your judgment of the Celebrity.\"\n\n\"Does the study of law eliminate humanity?\" she asked, with a mock\ncurtsey. \"The deliberate sentences are sometimes the unjust ones, and\nmen who are hung by weighed wisdom are often the innocent.\"\n\n\"That is all very well in cases of doubt. But here you have the\nevidences of wrong-doing directly before you.\"\n\nThree dishes were taken up, dried, and put down before she answered me.\nI threw pebbles into the brook, and wished I had held my tongue.\n\n\"What evidence?\" inquired she. \"Well,\" said I, \"I must finish, I\nsuppose. I had a notion you knew of what I inferred. First, let me\nsay that I have no desire to prejudice you against a person whom you\nadmire.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nSomething in her tone made me look up.\n\n\"Very good, then,\" I answered. \"I, for one, can have no use for a man\nwho devotes himself to a girl long enough to win her affections, and\nthen deserts her with as little compunction as a dog does a rat it has\nshaken. And that is how your Celebrity treated Miss Trevor.\"\n\n\"But Miss Trevor has recovered, I believe,\" said Miss Thorn.\n\nI began to feel a deep, but helpless, insecurity.\n\n\"Happily, yes,\" I assented.\n\n\"Thanks to an excellent physician.\"\n\nA smile twitched the corners of her mouth, as though she enjoyed my\ndiscomfiture. I remarked for the fiftieth time how strong her face was,\nwith its generous lines and clearly moulded features. And a suspicion\nentered my soul.\n\n\"At any rate,\" I said, with a laugh, \"the Celebrity has got himself into\nno end of a predicament now. He may go back to New York in custody.\"\n\n\"I thought you incapable of resentment, Mr. Crocker. How mean of you to\ndeny him!\"\n\n\"It can do no harm,\" I answered; \"a little lesson in the dangers of\nincognito may be salutary. I wish it were a little lesson in the dangers\nof something else.\"\n\nThe color mounted to her face as she resumed her occupation.\n\n\"I am afraid you are a very wicked man,\" she said.\n\nBefore I could reply there came a scuffling sound from the bank above\nus, and the snapping of branches and twigs. It was Mr. Cooke. His\ndescent, the personal conduction of which he lost half-way down, was\nirregular and spasmodic, and a rude concussion at the bottom knocked off\na choice bit of profanity which was balanced on the tip of his tongue.\n\n\"Tobogganing is a little out of season,\" said his niece, laughing\nheartily.\n\nMr. Cooke brushed himself off, picked up the glasses which he had\ndropped in his flight and pushed them into my hands. Then he pointed\nlakeward with bulging eyes.\n\n\"Crocker, old man,\" he said in a loud whisper, \"they tell me that is an\nAsquith cat-boat.\"\n\nI followed his finger and saw for the first time a sail-boat headed for\nthe island, then about two miles off shore. I raised the glasses.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"the Scimitar.\"\n\n\"That's what Farrar said,\" cried he.\n\n\"And what about it?\" I asked.\n\n\"What about it?\" he ejaculated. \"Why, it's a detective come for Allen.\nI knew sure as hell if they got as far as Asquith they wouldn't stop\nthere. And that's the fastest sail-boat he could hire there, isn't it?\"\n\nI replied that it was. He seized me by the shoulder and began dragging\nme up the bank.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I cried, shaking myself loose.\n\n\"We've got to get on the Maria and run for it,\" he panted. \"There is no\ntime to be lost.\"\n\nHe had reached the top of the bank and was running towards the group\nat the tents. And he actually infused me with some of his red-hot\nenthusiasm, for I hastened after him.\n\n\"But you can't begin to get the Maria out before they will be in here,\"\nI shouted.\n\nHe stopped short, gazed at the approaching boat, and then at me.\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said I, \"they will be here in ten minutes.\"\n\nThe Celebrity stood in the midst of the excited Four. His hair was\nparted precisely, and he had induced a monocle to remain in his eye long\nenough to examine the Scimitar, his nose at the critical elevation. This\nunruffled exterior made a deep impression on the Four. Was the Celebrity\nnot undergoing the crucial test of a true sport? He was an example alike\nto criminals and philosophers.\n\nMr. Cooke hurried into the group, which divided respectfully for him,\nand grasped the Celebrity by the hand.\n\n\"Something else has got to be done, old man,\" he said, in a voice which\nshook with emotion; \"they'll be on us before we can get the Maria out.\"\n\nFarrar, who was nailing a rustic bench near by, straightened up at this,\nhis lip curling with a desire to laugh.\n\nThe Celebrity laid his hand on my client's shoulder.\n\n\"Cooke,\" said he, \"I'm deeply grateful for all the trouble you wish to\ntake, and for the solicitude you have shown. But let things be. I'll\ncome out of it all right.\"\n\n\"Never,\" cried Cooke, looking proudly around the Four as some Highland\nchief might have surveyed a faithful clan. \"I'd a damned sight rather go\nto jail myself.\"\n\n\"A damned sight,\" echoed the Four in unison.\n\n\"I insist, Cooke,\" said the Celebrity, taking out his eyeglass and\ntapping Mr. Cooke's purple necktie, \"I insist that you drop this\nbusiness. I repeat my thanks to you and these gentlemen for the\nfriendship they have shown, but say again that I am as innocent of this\ncrime as a baby.\"\n\nMr. Cooke paid no attention to this speech. His face became radiant.\n\n\"Didn't any of you fellows strike a cave, or a hollow tree, or something\nof that sort, knocking around this morning?\"\n\nOne man slapped his knee.\n\n\"The very place,\" he cried. \"I fell into it,\" and he showed a rent in\nhis trousers corroboratively. \"It's big enough to hold twenty of Allen,\nand the detective doesn't live that could find it.\"\n\n\"Hustle him off, quick,\" said Mr. Cooke.\n\nThe mandate was obeyed as literally as though Robin Hood himself had\ngiven it. The Celebrity disappeared into the forest, carried rather than\nurged towards his destined place of confinement.\n\nThe commotion had brought Mr. Trevor to the spot. He caught sight of\nthe Celebrity's back between the trees, then he looked at the cat-boat\nentering the cove, a man in the stern preparing to pull in the tender.\n\nHe intercepted Mr. Cooke on his way to the beach.\n\n\"What have you done with Mr. Allen?\" he asked, in a menacing voice.\n\n\"Good God,\" said Mr. Cooke, whose contempt for Mr. Trevor was now\ninfinite, \"you talk as if I were the governor of the state. What the\ndevil could I do with him?\"\n\n\"I will have no evasion,\" replied Mr. Trevor, taking an imposing posture\nin front of him. \"You are trying to defeat the ends of justice by\nassisting a dangerous criminal to escape. I have warned you, sir, and\nwarn you again of the consequences of your meditated crime, and I give\nyou my word I will do all in my power to frustrate it.\"\n\nMr. Cooke dug his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets. Here was a\ncomplication he had not looked for. The Scimitar lay at anchor with her\nsail down, and two men were coming ashore in the tender. Mr. Cooke's\nattitude being that of a man who reconsiders a rash resolve, Mr. Trevor\nwas emboldened to say in a moderated tone:\n\n\"You were carried away by your generosity, Mr. Cooke. I was sure when\nyou took time to think you would see it in another light.\"\n\nMr. Cooke started off for the place where the boat had grounded. I did\nnot catch his reply, and probably should not have written it here if I\nhad. The senator looked as if he had been sand-bagged.\n\nThe two men jumped out of the boat and hauled it up. Mr. Cooke waved an\neasy salute to one, whom I recognized as the big boatman from Asquith,\nfamiliarly known as Captain Jay. He owned the Scimitar and several\nsmaller boats. The captain went through the pantomime of an introduction\nbetween Mr. Cooke and the other, whom my client shook warmly by the\nhand, and presently all three came towards us.\n\nMr. Cooke led them to a bar he had improvised by the brook. A pool\nserved the office of refrigerator, and Mr. Cooke had devised an\ningenious but complicated arrangement of strings and labels which\nenabled him to extract any bottle or set of bottles without having to\nbare his arm and pull out the lot. Farrar and I responded to the call he\nhad given, and went down to assist in the entertainment. My client, with\nhis back to us, was busy manipulating the strings.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"let me make you acquainted with Mr. Drew. You all\nknow the captain.\"\n\nHad I not suspected Mr. Drew's profession, I think I should not have\nremarked that he gave each of us a keen look as he raised his head. He\nhad reddish-brown hair, and a pair of bushy red whiskers, each of which\ntapered to a long point. He was broad in the shoulders, and the clothes\nhe wore rather enhanced this breadth. His suit was gray and almost new,\nthe trousers perceptibly bagging at the knee, and he had a felt hat,\na necktie of the white and flowery pattern, and square-toed \"Congress\"\nboots. In short, he was a decidedly ordinary looking person; you would\nmeet a hundred like him in the streets of Far Harbor and Beaverton. He\nmight have been a prosperous business man in either of those towns,--a\ncomfortable lumber merchant or mine owner. And he had chosen just the\nget-up I should have picked for detective work in that region. He had\na pleasant eye and a very fetching and hearty manner. But his long\nwhiskers troubled me especially. I kept wondering if they were real.\n\n\"The captain is sailing Mr. Drew over to Far Harbor,\" explained Mr.\nCooke, \"and they have put in here for the night.\"\n\nMr. Drew was plainly not an amateur, for he volunteered nothing further\nthan this. The necessary bottles having been produced, Mr. Cooke held up\nhis glass and turned to the stranger.\n\n\"Welcome to our party, old man,\" said he.\n\nMr. Drew drained his glass and complimented Mr. Cooke on the brand,--a\nsure key to my client's heart. Whereupon he seated himself between Mr.\nDrew and the captain and began a discourse on the subject of his own\ncellar, on which he talked for nearly an hour. His only pauses were for\nthe worthy purpose of filling the detective's or the captain's glass,\nand these he watched with a hospitable solicitude. The captain had\nthe advantage, three to one, and I made no doubt his employer bitterly\nregretted not having a boatman whose principles were more strict. At the\nend of the hour Captain Jay, who by nature was inclined to be taciturn\nand crabbed, waxed loquacious and even jovial. He sang us the songs he\nhad learned in the winter lumber-camps, which Mr. Cooke never failed\nto encore to the echo. My client vowed he had not spent a pleasanter\nafternoon for years. He plied the captain with cigars, and explained to\nhim the mystery of the strings and labels; and the captain experimented\nuntil he had broken some of the bottles.\n\nMr. Cooke was not a person who made any great distinction between the\nthree degrees, acquaintance, friendship, and intimacy. When a stranger\npleased him, he went from one to the other with such comparative ease\nthat a hardhearted man, and no other, could have resented his advances.\nMr. Drew was anything but a hard-hearted man, and he did not object to\nmy client's familiarity. Mr. Cooke made no secret of his admiration\nfor Mr. Drew, and there were just two things about him that Mr. Cooke\nadmired and wondered at, above all else,--the bushy red whiskers. But it\nappeared that these were the only things that Mr. Drew was really touchy\nabout. I noticed that the detective, without being impolite, did his\nbest to discourage these remarks; but my client knew no such word as\ndiscouragement. He was continually saying: \"I think I'll grow some like\nthat, old man,\" or \"Have those cut,\" and the like,--a kind of humor\nin which the captain took an incredible delight. And finally, when a\ncertain pitch of good feeling had been arrived at, Mr. Cooke reached out\nand playfully grabbed hold of the one near him. The detective drew back.\n\"Mr. Cooke,\" said he, with dignity, \"I'll have to ask you to let my\nwhiskers alone.\"\n\n\"Certainly, old man,\" replied my client, anything but abashed. \"You'll\npardon me, but they seemed too good to be true. I congratulate you on\nthem.\"\n\nI was amused as well as alarmed at this piece of boldness, but the\nincident passed off without any disagreeable results, except, perhaps,\na slight nervousness noticeable in the detective; and this soon\ndisappeared. As the sun grew low, the Celebrity's conductors straggled\nin with fishing-rods and told of an afternoon's sport, and we left the\ncaptain peacefully but sonorously slumbering on the bank.\n\n\"Crocker,\" said my client to me, afterwards, \"they didn't feel like the\nreal, home-grown article. But aren't they damned handsome?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nAfter supper, Captain Jay was rowed out and put to bed in his own bunk\non the Scimitar. Then we heaped together a huge pile of the driftwood\non the beach and raised a blazing beacon, the red light of which I doubt\nnot could be seen from the mainland. The men made prongs from the soft\nwood, while Miss Thorn produced from the stores some large tins of\nmarshmallows.\n\nThe memory of that evening lingers with me yet. The fire colored\neverything. The waves dashed in ruby foam at our feet, and even the\ntall, frowning pines at our backs were softened; the sting was gone out\nof the keen night wind from the north. I found a place beside the gray\ncape I had seen for the first time the night of the cotillon. I\nno longer felt any great dislike for Miss Thorn, let it be known.\nResentment was easier when the distance between Mohair and Asquith\nseparated us,--impossible on a yachting excursion. But why should I be\njustifying myself?\n\nMr. Cooke and the Four, in addition to other accomplishments, possessed\nexcellent voices, and Mr. Drew sang a bass which added much to the\nmelody. One of the Four played a banjo. It is only justice to Mr. Drew\nto say that he seemed less like a detective than any man I have ever\nmet. He told a good story and was quick at repartee, and after a while\nthe music, by tacit consent, was abandoned for the sake of hearing him\ntalk. He related how he had worked up the lake, point by point, from\nBeaverton to Asquith, and lightened his narrative with snappy accounts\nof the different boatmen he had run across and of the different\npredicaments into which he had fallen. His sketches were so vivid that\nMr. Cooke forgot to wink at me after a while and sat spellbound, while I\nmarvelled at the imaginative faculty he displayed. He had us in roars of\nlaughter. His stories were far from incredible, and he looked less like\na liar than a detective. He showed, too, an accurate and astonishing\nknowledge of the lake which could hardly have been acquired in any other\nway than the long-shore trip he had described. Not once did he hint of a\nspecial purpose which had brought him to the island, and it was growing\nlate. The fire died down upon the stones, and the thought of the\nCelebrity, alone in a dark cave in the middle of the island, began to\nprey upon me. I was not designed for a practical joker, and I take it\nthat pity is a part of every self-respecting man's composition. In the\ncool of the night season the ludicrous side of the matter did not appeal\nto me quite as strongly as in the glare of day. A joke should never be\npushed to cruelty. It was in vain that I argued I had no direct hand in\nthe concealing of him; I felt my responsibility quite as heavy upon me.\nPerhaps bears still remained in these woods. And if a bear should devour\nthe author of The Sybarites, would the world ever forgive me? Could I\never repay the debt to the young women of these United States? To speak\ntruth, I expected every moment to see him appear. Why, in the name of\nall his works, did he stay there? Nothing worse could befall him than\nto go to Far Harbor with Drew, where our words concerning his identity\nwould be taken. And what an advertisement this would be for the great\nauthor. The Sybarites, now selling by thousands, would increase its\nsales to ten thousands. Ah, there was the rub. The clue to his remaining\nin the cave was this very kink in the Celebrity's character. There\nwas nothing Bohemian in that character; it yearned after the eminently\nrespectable. Its very eccentricities were within the limits of good\nform. The Celebrity shunned the biscuits and beer of the literary clubs,\nand his books were bound for the boudoir. To have it proclaimed in the\nsensational journals that the hands of this choice being had been locked\nfor grand larceny was a thought too horrible to entertain. His very\nmanservant would have cried aloud against it. Better a hundred nights in\na cave than one such experience!\n\nMiss Trevor's behavior that evening was so unrestful as to lead me to\nbelieve that she, too, was going through qualms of sympathy for the\nvictim. As we were breaking up for the evening she pulled my sleeve.\n\n\"Don't you think we have carried our joke a little too far, Mr.\nCrocker?\" she whispered uneasily. \"I can't bear to think of him in that\nterrible place.\"\n\n\"It will do him a world of good,\" I replied, assuming a gayety I did not\nfeel. It is not pleasant to reflect that some day one's own folly might\nplace one in alike situation. And the night was dismally cool and windy,\nnow that the fire had gone out. Miss Trevor began to philosophize.\n\n\"Such practical pleasantries as this,\" she said, \"are like infernal\nmachines: they often blow up the people that start them. And they are\nnext to impossible to steer.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is just as well not to assume we are the instruments of\nProvidence,\" I said.\n\nHere we ran into Miss Thorn, who was carrying a lantern.\n\n\"I have been searching everywhere for you two mischief-makers,\" said\nshe. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Heaven only knows how this\nlittle experiment will end. Here is Aunt Maria, usually serene, on the\nverge of hysterics: she says he shouldn't stay in that damp cave another\nminute. Here is your father, Irene, organizing relief parties and\nwalking the floor of his tent like a madman. And here is Uncle Fenelon\ninsane over the idea of getting the poor, innocent man into Canada. And\nhere is a detective saddled upon us, perhaps for days, and Uncle Fenelon\nhas gotten his boatman drunk. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\"\nshe repeated.\n\nMiss Trevor laughed, in spite of the gravity of these things, and so did\nI.\n\n\"Oh, come, Marian,\" said she, \"it isn't as bad as all that. And you talk\nas if you hadn't anything to be reproached for. Your own defence of the\nCelebrity wasn't as strong as it might have been.\"\n\nBy the light of the lantern I saw Miss Thorn cast one meaning look at\nMiss Trevor.\n\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" asked Miss Thorn, addressing me.\n\"Think of that unhappy man, without a bed, without blankets, without\neven a tooth-brush.\"\n\n\"He hasn't been wholly off my mind,\" I answered truthfully. \"But there\nisn't anything we can do to-night, with that beastly detective to notice\nit.\"\n\n\"Then you must go very early to-morrow morning, before the detective\ngets up.\"\n\nI couldn't help smiling at the notion of getting up before a detective.\n\n\"I am only too willing,\" I said.\n\n\"It must be by four o'clock,\" Miss Thorn went on energetically, \"and we\nmust have a guide we can trust. Arrange it with one of Uncle Fenelon's\nfriends.\"\n\n\"We?\" I repeated.\n\n\"You certainly don't imagine that I am going to be left behind?\" said\nMiss Thorn.\n\nI made haste to invite for the expedition one of the Four, who was quite\nwilling to go; and we got together all the bodily comforts we could\nthink of and put them in a hamper, the Fraction not forgetting to add a\nfew bottles from Mr. Cooke's immersed bar.\n\nLong after the camp had gone to bed, I lay on the pine-needles above the\nbrook, shielded from the wind by a break in the slope, and thought of\nthe strange happenings of that day. Presently the waning moon climbed\nreluctantly from the waters, and the stream became mottled, black\nand white, the trees tall blurs. The lake rose and fell with a mighty\nrhythm, and the little brook hurried madly over the stones to join it.\nOne thought chased another from my brain.\n\nAt such times, when one's consciousness of outer things is dormant, an\nearthquake might continue for some minutes without one realizing it. I\ndid not observe, though I might have seen from where I lay, the flap of\none of the tents drawn back and two figures emerge. They came and stood\non the bank above, under the tree which sheltered me. And I experienced\na curious phenomenon. I heard, and understood, and remembered the first\npart of the conversation which passed between them, and did not know it.\n\n\"I am sorry to disturb you,\" said one.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the other, whose tone, I thought afterwards,\nbetokened surprise, and no great cheerfulness.\n\n\"But I have had no other opportunity to speak with you.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other, rather uneasily.\n\nSuddenly my senses were alert, and I knew that Mr. Trevor had pulled\nthe detective out of bed. The senator had no doubt anticipated an easier\ntime, and he now began feeling for an opening. More than once he cleared\nhis throat to commence, while Mr. Drew pulled his scant clothing closer\nabout him, his whiskers playing in the breeze.\n\n\"In Cincinnati, Mr. Drew,\" said Mr. Trevor, at length, \"I am a known, if\nnot an influential, citizen; and I have served my state for three terms\nin its Senate.\"\n\n\"I have visited your city, Mr. Trevor,\" answered Mr. Drew, his teeth\nchattering audibly, \"and I know you by reputation.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" Mr. Trevor continued, with a flourish which appeared\nabsolutely grotesque in his attenuated costume, \"it must be clear to you\nthat I cannot give my consent to a flagrant attempt by an unscrupulous\nperson to violate the laws of this country.\"\n\n\"Your feelings are to be respected, sir.\"\n\nMr. Trevor cleared his throat again. \"Discretion is always to be\nobserved, Mr. Drew. And I, who have been in the public service, know the\nfull value of it.\"\n\nMr. Trevor leaned forward, at the same time glancing anxiously up at the\ntree, for fear, perhaps, that Mr. Cooke might be concealed therein. He\nsaid in a stage whisper:\n\n\"A criminal is concealed on this island.\"\n\nDrew started perceptibly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Trevor, with a glance of triumph at having produced an\nimpression on a detective, \"I thought it my duty to inform you. He has\nbeen hidden by the followers of the unscrupulous person I referred to,\nin a cave, I believe. I repeat, sir, as a man of unimpeachable standing,\nI considered it my duty to tell you.\"\n\n\"You have my sincere thanks, Mr. Trevor,\" said Drew, holding out his\nhand, \"and I shall act on the suggestion.\"\n\nMr. Trevor clasped the hand of the detective, and they returned quietly\nto their respective tents. And in course of time I followed them,\nwondering how this incident might affect our morning's expedition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMy first thought on rising was to look for the detective. The touch\nof the coming day was on the lake, and I made out the two boats dimly,\nriding on the dead swell and tugging idly at their chains. The detective\nhad been assigned to a tent which was occupied by Mr. Cooke and the\nFour, and they were sleeping soundly at my entrance. But Drew's blankets\nwere empty. I hurried to the beach, but the Scimitar's boat was still\ndrawn up there near the Maria's tender, proving that he was still on the\nisland.\n\nOutside of the ladies' tent I came upon Miss Thorn, stowing a large\nbasket. I told her that we had taken that precaution the night before.\n\n\"What did you put in?\" she demanded.\n\nI enumerated the articles as best I could. And when I had finished, she\nsaid,\n\n\"And I am filling this with the things you have forgotten.\"\n\nI lost no time in telling her what I had overheard the night before, and\nthat the detective was gone from his tent. She stopped her packing and\nlooked at me in concern.\n\n\"He is probably watching us,\" she said. \"Do you think we had better go?\"\n\nI thought it could do no harm. \"If we are followed,\" said I, \"all we\nhave to do is to turn back.\"\n\nMiss Trevor came out as I spoke, and our conductor appeared, bending\nunder the hamper. I shouldered some blankets and the basket, and we\nstarted. We followed a rough path, evidently cut by a camping party in\nsome past season, but now overgrown. The Fraction marched ahead, and I\nformed the rear guard. Several times it seemed to me as though someone\nwere pushing after us, and more than once we halted. I put down the\nbasket and went back to reconnoitre. Once I believed I saw a figure\nflitting in the gray light, but I set it down to my imagination.\n\nFinally we reached a brook, sneaking along beneath the underbrush as\nthough fearing to show itself, and we followed its course. Branches\nlashed our faces and brambles tore our clothes. And then, as the\nsunlight was filtering through and turning the brook from blue to\ncrystal, we came upon the Celebrity. He was seated in a little open\nspace on the bank, apparently careless of capture. He did not even rise\nat our approach. His face showed the effect of a sleepless night, and\nwore an expression inimical to all mankind. The conductor threw his\nbundle on the bank and laid his hand on the Celebrity's shoulder.\n\n\"Halloa, old man!\" said he, cheerily. \"You must have had a hard night of\nit. But we couldn't make you any sooner, because that hawk of an officer\nhad his eye on us.\"\n\nThe Celebrity shook himself free. And in place of the gratitude for\nwhich the Fraction had looked, and which he had every reason to expect,\nhe got something different.\n\n\"This outrage has gone far enough,\" said the Celebrity, with a terrible\ncalmness. The Fraction was a man of the world.\n\n\"Come, come, old chap!\" he said soothingly, \"don't cut up. We'll make\nthings a little more homelike here.\" And he pulled a bottle from the\ndepths of the hamper. \"This will brace you up.\"\n\nHe picked up the hamper and disappeared into the place of retention,\nwhile the Celebrity threw the bottle into the brush. And just then (may\nI be forgiven if I am imaginative!) I heard a human laugh come from that\ndirection. In the casting of that bottle the Celebrity had given vent to\nsome of the feelings he had been collecting overnight, and it must have\ncarried about thirty yards. I dived after it like a retriever puppy\nfor a stone; but the bottle was gone! Perhaps I could say more, but it\ndoesn't do to believe in yourself too thoroughly when you get up early.\nI had nothing to say when I returned.\n\n\"You here, Crocker?\" said the author, fixing his eye on me. \"Deuced kind\nof you to get up so early and carry a basket so far for me.\"\n\n\"It has been a real pleasure, I assure you,\" I protested. And it had.\nThere was a silent space while the two young ladies regarded him,\nsoftened by his haggard and dishevelled aspect, and perplexed by his\nattitude. Nothing, I believe, appeals to a woman so much as this very\nlack of bodily care. And the rogue knew it!\n\n\"How long is this little game of yours to continue,--this bull-baiting?\"\nhe inquired. \"How long am I to be made a butt of for the amusement of a\nlot of imbeciles?\"\n\nMiss Thorn crossed over and seated herself on the ground beside him.\n\"You must be sensible,\" she said, in a tone that she might have used to\na spoiled child. \"I know it is difficult after the night you have had.\nBut you have always been willing to listen to reason.\"\n\nA pang of something went through me when I saw them together. \"Reason,\"\nsaid the Celebrity, raising his head. \"Reason, yes. But where is the\nreason in all this? Because a man who happens to be my double commits a\ncrime, is it right that I, whose reputation is without a mark, should be\nmade to suffer? And why have I been made a fool of by two people whom I\nhad every cause to suppose my friends?\"\n\n\"You will have to ask them,\" replied Miss Thorn, with a glance at us.\n\"They are mischief-makers, I'll admit; but they are not malicious. See\nwhat they have done this morning! And how could they have foreseen that\na detective was on his way to the island?\"\n\n\"Crocker might have known it,\" said he, melting. \"He's so cursed smart!\"\n\n\"And think,\" Miss Thorn continued, quick to follow up an advantage,\n\"think what would have happened if they hadn't denied you. This horrid\nman would have gone off with you to Asquith or somewhere else, with\nhandcuffs on your wrists; for it isn't a detective's place to take\nevidence, Mr. Crocker says. Perhaps we should all have had to go to\nEpsom! And I couldn't bear to see you in handcuffs, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we had better leave them alone?\" I said to Miss Trevor.\n\nShe smiled and shook her head.\n\n\"You are blind as a bat, Mr. Crocker,\" she said.\n\nThe Celebrity had weighed Miss Thorn's words and was listening passively\nnow while she talked. There may be talents which she did not possess; I\nwill not pretend to say. But I know there are many professions she might\nhave chosen had she not been a woman. She would have made a name for\nherself at the bar; as a public speaker she would have excelled. And had\nI not been so long accustomed to picking holes in arguments I am sure I\nshould not have perceived the fallacies of this she was making for the\nbenefit of the Celebrity. He surely did not. It is strange how a man\ncan turn under such influence from one feeling to another. The Celebrity\nlost his resentment; apprehension took its place. He became more and\nmore nervous; questioned me from time to time on the law; wished to know\nwhether he would be called upon for testimony at Allen's trial; whether\nthere was any penalty attached to the taking of another man's name;\nprecisely what Drew would do with him if captured; and the tail of his\neye was on the thicket as he made this inquiry. It may be surmised\nthat I took an exquisite delight in quenching this new-born thirst for\nknowledge. And finally we all went into the cave.\n\nMiss Thorn unpacked the things we had brought, while I surveyed the\ncavern. It was in the solid rock, some ten feet high and irregular in\nshape, and perfectly dry. It was a marvel to me how cosy she made it.\nOne of the Maria's lanterns was placed in a niche, and the Celebrity's\nsilver toilet-set laid out on a ledge of the rock, which answered\nperfectly for a dressing-table. Miss Thorn had not forgotten a small\nmirror. And as a last office, set a dainty breakfast on a linen napkin\non the rock, heating the coffee in a chafing-dish.\n\n\"There!\" she exclaimed, surveying her labors, \"I hope you will be more\ncomfortable.\"\n\nHe had already taken the precaution to brush his hair and pull himself\ntogether. His thanks, such as they were, he gave to Miss Thorn. It is\ntrue that she had done more than any one else.\n\n\"Good-bye, old boy!\" said the Fraction. \"We'll come back when we get the\nchance, and don't let that hundred thousand keep you awake.\"\n\nThe Fraction and I covered up the mouth of the cave with brush. He\nbecame confidential.\n\n\"Lucky dog, Allen!\" he said. \"They'll never get him away from Cooke. And\nhe can have any girl he wants for the asking. By George! I believe Miss\nThorn will elope with him if he ever reaches Canada.\"\n\nI only mention this as a sample of the Fraction's point of view. I\nconfess the remark annoyed me at the time.\n\nMiss Thorn lingered in the cave for a minute after Miss Trevor came out.\nThen we retraced our way down the brook, which was dancing now in the\nsunlight. Miss Trevor stopped now and then to rest, in reality to laugh.\nI do not know what the Fraction thought of such heartless conduct. He\nand I were constantly on the alert for Mr. Drew, but we sighted the camp\nwithout having encountered him. It was half-past six, and we had trusted\nto slip in unnoticed by any one. But, as we emerged from the trees, the\nbustling scene which greeted our eyes filled us with astonishment. Two\nof the tents were down, and the third in a collapsed condition, while\nconfusion reigned supreme. And in the midst of it all stood Mr. Cooke,\nan animated central figure pedestalled on a stump, giving emphatic\ndirections in a voice of authority. He spied us from his elevated\nposition before we had crossed the brook.\n\n\"Here they come, Maria,\" he shouted.\n\nWe climbed to the top of the slope, and were there confronted by Mrs.\nCooke and Mr. Trevor, with Mr. Cooke close behind them.\n\n\"Where the devil is Allen?\" my client demanded excitedly of the\nFraction.\n\n\"Allen?\" repeated that gentleman, \"why, we made him comfortable and left\nhim, of course. We had sense enough not to bring him here to be pulled.\"\n\n\"But, you damfool,\" cried Mr. Cooke, slightly forgetting himself, \"Drew\nhas escaped.\"\n\n\"Escaped?\"\n\n\"Yes, escaped,\" said Mr. Cooke, as though our conductor were personally\nresponsible; \"he got away this morning. Before we know it, we'll have\nthe whole police force of Far Harbor out here to jug the lot of us.\"\n\nThe Fraction, being deficient for the moment in language proper to\nexpress his appreciation of this new development, simply volunteered to\nreturn for the Celebrity, and left in a great hurry.\n\n\"Irene,\" said Mr. Trevor, \"can it be possible that you have stolen away\nfor the express purpose of visiting this criminal?\"\n\n\"If he is a criminal, father, it is no reason that he should starve.\"\n\n\"It is no reason,\" cried her father, hotly, \"why a young girl who has\nbeen brought up as you have, should throw every lady-like instinct to\nthe winds. There are men enough in this camp to keep him from starving.\nI will not have my daughter's name connected with that of a defaulter.\nIrene, you have set the seal of disgrace upon a name which I have\nlabored for a lifetime to make one of the proudest in the land. And it\nwas my fond hope that I possessed a daughter who--\"\n\nDuring this speech my anger had been steadily rising. But it was Mrs.\nCooke who interrupted him.\n\n\"Mr. Trevor,\" said she, \"perhaps you are not aware that while you are\ninsulting your daughter, you are also insulting my niece. It may be well\nfor you to know that Miss Trevor still has my respect as a woman and\nmy admiration as a lady. And, since she has been so misjudged by her\nfather, she has my deepest sympathy. But I wish to beg of you, if you\nhave anything of this nature to say to her, you will take her feelings\ninto consideration as well as ours.\"\n\nMiss Trevor gave her one expressive look of gratitude. The senator was\neffectually silenced. He had come, by some inexplicable inference, to\nbelieve that Mrs. Cooke, while subservient to the despotic will of her\nhusband, had been miraculously saved from depravity, and had set her\nface against this last monumental act of outlawry.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME 4.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nI am convinced that Mr. Cooke possessed at least some of the qualities\nof a great general. In certain campaigns of past centuries, and even of\nthis, it has been hero-worship that impelled the rank and file rather\nthan any high sympathy with the cause they were striving for. And so\nit was with us that morning. Our commander was everywhere at once,\nencouraging us to work, and holding over us in impressive language the\nawful alternative of capture. For he had the art, in a high degree,\nof inoculating his followers with the spirit which animated him; and\nshortly, to my great surprise, I found myself working as though my life\ndepended on it. I certainly did not care very much whether the Celebrity\nwas captured or not, and yet, with the prospect of getting him over the\nborder, I had not thought of breakfast. Farrar had a natural inclination\nfor work of this sort, but even he was infused somewhat with the\ncontagious haste and enthusiasm which filled the air; and together we\nfolded the tents with astonishing despatch and rowed them out to the\nMaria, Mr. Cooke having gone to his knees in the water to shove the boat\noff.\n\n\"What are we doing this for?\" said Farrar to me, as we hoisted the sail.\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"I have just been asking myself that question,\" I replied.\n\n\"You are a nice district attorney, Crocker,\" he said. \"You have made\na most proper and equitable decision in giving your consent to Allen's\nescape. Doesn't your conscience smart?\"\n\n\"Not unbearably. I'll tell you what, Farrar,\" said I, \"the truth is,\nthat this fellow never embezzled so much as a ten-cent piece. He isn't\nguilty: he isn't the man.\"\n\n\"Isn't the man?\" repeated Farrar.\n\n\"No,\" I answered; \"it's a long tale, and no time to tell it now. But he\nis really, as he claims to be, the author of all those detestable books\nwe have been hearing so much of.\"\n\n\"The deuce he is!\" exclaimed Farrar, dropping the stopper he was tying.\n\"Did he write The Sybarites?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he wrote The Sybarites, and all the rest of that trash.\"\n\n\"He's the fellow that maintains a man ought to marry a girl after he has\nbecome engaged to her.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said, smiling at his way of putting it.\n\n\"Preaches constancy to all men, but doesn't object to stealing.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"You're badly mixed,\" I explained. \"I told you he never stole anything.\nHe was only ass enough to take the man's name who is the living image of\nhim. And the other man took the bonds.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" said he, \"tell me something improbable while you are\nabout it.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" I replied, repressing my mirth; \"true as the tale of\nTimothy. I knew him when he was a mere boy. But I don't give you that as\na proof, for he might have become all things to all men since. Ask Miss\nTrevor; or Miss Thorn; she knows the other man, the bicycle man, and has\nseen them both together.\"\n\n\"Where, in India? Was one standing on the ground looking at his double\ngo to heaven? Or was it at one of those drawing-room shows where a\nmedium holds conversation with your soul, while your body sleeps on the\nlounge? By George, Crocker, I thought you were a sensible man.\"\n\nNo wonder I got angry. But I might have come at some proper estimation\nof Farrar's incredulity by that time.\n\n\"I suppose you wouldn't take a lady's word,\" I growled.\n\n\"Not for that,\" he said, busy again with the sail stops; \"nor St.\nChrysostom's, were he to come here and vouch for it. It is too damned\nimprobable.\"\n\n\"Stranger things than that have happened,\" I retorted, fuming.\n\n\"Not to any of us,\" he said. Presently he added, chuckling: \"He'd better\nnot get into the clutches of that man Drew.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I demanded. Farrar was exasperating at times.\n\n\"Drew will wind those handcuffs on him like tourniquets,\" he laughed.\n\nThere seemed to be something behind this remark, but before I could\ninquire into it we were interrupted by Mr. Cooke, who was standing on\nthe beach, swearing and gesticulating for the boat.\n\n\"I trust,\" said Farrar, as we rowed ashore, \"that this blind excitement\nwill continue, and that we shall have the extreme pleasure of setting\ndown our friend in Her Majesty's dominions with a yachting-suit and a\nham sandwich.\"\n\nWe sat down to a hasty breakfast, in the middle of which the Celebrity\narrived. His appearance was unexceptionable, but his heavy jaw was set\nin a manner which should have warned Mr. Cooke not to trifle with him.\n\n\"Sit down, old man, and take a bite before we start for Canada,\" said my\nclient.\n\nThe Celebrity walked up to him.\n\n\"Mr. Cooke,\" he began in a menacing tone, \"it is high time this nonsense\nwas ended. I am tired of being made a buffoon of for your party. For\nyour gratification I have spent a sleepless night in those cold, damp\nwoods; and I warn you that practical joking can be carried too far. I\nwill not go to Canada, and I insist that you sail me back to Asquith.\"\n\nMr. Cooke winked significantly in our direction and tapped his head.\n\n\"I don't wonder you're a little upset, old man,\" he said, humoringly\npatting him; \"but sit down for a bite of something, and you'll see\nthings differently.\"\n\n\"I've had my breakfast,\" he said, taking out a cigarette.\n\nThen Mr. Trevor got up.\n\n\"He demands, sir, to be delivered over to the authorities,\" said he,\n\"and you have no right to refuse him. I protest strongly.\"\n\n\"And you can protest all you damn please,\" retorted my client; \"this\nisn't the Ohio State Senate. Do you know where I would put you, Mr.\nTrevor? Do you know where you ought to be? In a hencoop, sir, if I\nhad one here. In a hen-coop. What would you do if a man who had gone a\nlittle out of his mind asked you for a gun to shoot himself with? Give\nit him, I suppose. But I put Mr. Allen ashore in Canada, with the funds\nto get off with, and then my duty's done.\"\n\nThis speech, as Mr. Cooke had no doubt confidently hoped, threw the\nsenator into a frenzy of wrath.\n\n\"The day will come, sir,\" he shouted, shaking his fist at my client,\n\"the day will come when you will rue this bitterly.\"\n\n\"Don't get off any of your oratorical frills on me,\" replied Mr. Cooke,\ncontemptuously; \"you ought to be tied and muzzled.\"\n\nMr. Trevor was white with anger.\n\n\"I, for one, will not go to Canada,\" he cried.\n\n\"You'll stay here and starve, then,\" said Mr. Cooke; \"damned little I\ncare.\"\n\nMr. Trevor turned to Farrar, who was biting his lip.\n\n\"Mr. Farrar, I know you to be a rising young man of sound principles,\nand Mr. Crocker likewise. You are the only ones who can sail. Have you\nreflected that you are about to ruin your careers?\"\n\n\"We are prepared to take the chances, I think,\" said Farrar.\n\nMr. Cooke looked us over, proudly and gratefully, as much as to say that\nwhile he lived we should not lack the necessities of life.\n\nAt nine we embarked, the Celebrity and Mr. Trevor for the same reason\nthat the animals took to the ark,--because they had to. There was a\nspanking breeze in the west-northwest, and a clear sky, a day of days\nfor a sail. Mr. Cooke produced a map, which Farrar and I consulted, and\nwithout much trouble we hit upon a quiet place to land on the Canadian\nside. Our course was north-northwest, and therefore the wind enabled us\nto hold it without much trouble. Bear Island is situated some eighteen\nmiles from shore, and about equidistant between Asquith and Far Harbor,\nwhich latter we had to pass on our way northward.\n\nAlthough a brisk sea was on, the wind had been steady from that quarter\nall night, and the motion was uniform. The Maria was an excellent\nsea-boat. There was no indication, therefore, of the return of that\nmalady which had been so prevalent on the passage to Bear Island. Mr.\nCooke had never felt better, and looked every inch a sea-captain in his\nnatty yachting-suit. He had acquired a tan on the island; and, as is\neminently proper on a boat, he affected nautical manners and nautical\nways. But his vernacular savored so hopelessly of the track and stall\nthat he had been able to acquire no mastery over the art of marine\ninvective. And he possessed not so much as one maritime oath. As soon as\nwe had swung clear of the cove he made for the weather stays, where\nhe assumed a posture not unlike that in the famous picture of Farragut\nascending Mobile Bay. His leather case was swung over his shoulder, and\nwith his glasses he swept the lake in search of the Scimitar and other\nvessels of a like unamiable character.\n\nAlthough my client could have told you, offhand, Jackstraw's last mile\nin a bicycle sulky, his notion of the Scimitar's speed was as vague\nas his knowledge of seamanship. And when I informed him that in all\nprobability she had already passed the light on Far Harbor reef, some\nnine miles this side of the Far Harbor police station, he went into\nan inordinate state of excitement. Mr. Cooke was, indeed, that day the\nembodiment of an unselfish if misdirected zeal. He was following the\ndictates of both heart and conscience in his endeavor to rescue his\nguest from the law; and true zeal is invariably contagious. What but\nsuch could have commanded the unremitting labors of that morning? Farrar\nhimself had done three men's work before breakfast, and it was, in great\npart, owing to him that we were now leaving the island behind us. He was\nsailing the Maria that day as she will never be sailed again: her lee\ngunwale awash, and a wake like a surveyor's line behind her. More than\nonce I called to mind his facetious observation about Mr. Drew, and\nwondered if he knew more than he had said about the detective.\n\nOnce in the open, the Maria showed but small consideration for her\npassengers, for she went through the seas rather than over them. And Mr.\nCooke, manfully keeping his station on the weather bow, likewise went\nthrough the seas. No argument could induce him to leave the post he had\nthus heroically chosen, which was one of honor rather than utility, for\nthe lake was as vacant of sails as the day that Father Marquette (or\nsome one else) first beheld it. Under such circumstances ease must be\nconsidered as only a relative term; and the accommodations of the Maria\nafforded but two comfortable spots,--the cabin, and the lea aft of the\ncabin bulkhead. This being the case, the somewhat peculiar internal\nrelations of the party decided its grouping.\n\nI know of no worse place than a small yacht, or than a large one for\nthat matter, for uncongenial people. The Four betook themselves to the\ncabin, which was fortunately large, and made life bearable with a game\nof cards; while Mrs. Cooke, whose adaptability and sense I had come\ngreatly to, admire, contented herself with a corner and a book. The\nungrateful cause of the expedition himself occupied another corner. I\ncaught sight of him through the cabin skylight, and the silver pencil he\nwas holding over his note-book showed unmistakable marks of teeth.\n\nOutside, Mr. Trevor, his face wearing an immutable expression of\ndefiance for the wickedness surrounding him, had placed his daughter for\nsafe-keeping between himself and the only other reliable character on\nboard,--the refrigerator. But Miss Thorn appeared in a blue mackintosh\nand a pair of heavy yachting-boots, courting rather than avoiding a\ndrenching. Even a mackintosh is becoming to some women. All morning she\nsat behind Mr. Cooke, on the rise of the cabin, her back against the\nmast and her hair flying in the wind, and I, for one, was not sorry the\nCelebrity had given us this excuse for a sail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAbout half-past eleven Mr. Cooke's vigilance was rewarded by a glimpse\nof the lighthouse on Far Harbor reef, and almost simultaneously he\npicked up, to the westward, the ragged outline of the house-tops and\nspires of the town itself. But as we neared the reef the harbor appeared\nas quiet as a Sunday morning: a few Mackinaws were sailing hither\nand thither, and the Far Harbor and Beaverton boat was coming out. My\nclient, in view of the peaceful aspect affairs had assumed, presently\nconsented to relinquish his post, and handed the glasses over to me with\nan injunction to be watchful.\n\nI promised. And Mr. Cooke, feeling his way aft with more discretion than\ngrace, finally descended into the cabin, where he was noisily received.\nAnd I was left with Miss Thorn. While my client had been there in front\nof us, his lively conversation and naive if profane remarks kept us in\ncontinual laughter. When with him it was utterly impossible to see\nany other than the ludicrous side of this madcap adventure, albeit he\nhimself was so keenly in earnest as to its performance. It was with\nmisgiving that I saw him disappear into the hatchway, and my impulse\nwas to follow him. Our spirits, like those in a thermometer, are never\nstationary: mine were continually being sent up or down. The night\nbefore, when I had sat with Miss Thorn beside the fire, they went up;\nthis morning her anxious solicitude for the Celebrity had sent them\ndown again. She both puzzled and vexed me. I could not desert my post as\nlookout, and I remained in somewhat awkward suspense as to what she was\ngoing to say, gazing at distant objects through the glasses. Her remark,\nwhen it came, took me by surprise.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" she said seriously, \"that Uncle Fenelon's principles are\nnot all that they should be. His morality is something like his tobacco,\nwhich doesn't injure him particularly, but is dangerous to others.\"\n\nI was more than willing to meet her on the neutral ground of Uncle\nFenelon.\n\n\"Do you think his principles contagious?\" I asked.\n\n\"They have not met with the opposition they deserve,\" she replied.\n\"Uncle Fenelon's ideas of life are not those of other men,--yours, for\ninstance. And his affairs, mental and material, are, happily for\nhim, such that he can generally carry out his notions with small\ninconvenience. He is no doubt convinced that he is acting generously in\nattempting to rescue the Celebrity from a term in prison; what he does\nnot realize is that he is acting ungenerously to other guests who have\ninfinitely more at stake.\"\n\n\"But our friend from Ohio has done his best to impress this upon him,\"\nI replied, failing to perceive her drift; \"and if his words are wasted,\nsurely the thing is hopeless.\"\n\n\"I am not joking,\" said she. \"I was not thinking of Mr. Trevor, but of\nyou. I like you, Mr. Crocker. You may not believe it, but I do.\" For the\nlife of me I could think of no fitting reply to this declaration. Why\nwas that abominable word \"like\" ever put into the English language?\n\"Yes, I like you,\" she continued meditatively, \"in the face of the fact\nthat you persist in disliking me.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. You mustn't think me so stupid as all that. It is a\nmortifying truth that I like you, and that you have no use for me.\"\n\nI have never known how to take a jest from a woman. I suppose I should\nhave laughed this off. Instead, I made a fool of myself.\n\n\"I shall be as frank with you,\" I said, \"and declare that I like you,\nthough I should be much happier if I didn't.\"\n\nShe blushed at this, if I am not mistaken. Perhaps it was unlooked for.\n\n\"At any rate,\" she went on, \"I should deem it my duty to warn you of the\nconsequences of this joke of yours. They may not be all that you have\nanticipated. The consequences for you, I mean, which you do not seem to\nhave taken into account.\"\n\n\"Consequences for me!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"I fear that you will think what I am going to say uncalled for, and\nthat I am meddling with something that does not concern me. But it seems\nto me that you are undervaluing the thing you have worked so hard\nto attain. They say that you have ability, that you have acquired a\npractice and a position which at your age give the highest promise for\nthe future. That you are to be counsel for the railroad. In short, that\nyou are the coming man in this section of the state. I have found this\nout,\" said she, cutting short my objections, \"in spite of the short time\nI have been here.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, reddening in my turn.\n\n\"Suppose that the Celebrity is captured,\" she continued, thrusting\nher hands into the pockets of her mackintosh. \"It appears that he is\nshadowed, and it is not unreasonable to expect that we shall be chased\nbefore the day is over. Then we shall be caught red-handed in an attempt\nto get a criminal over the border. Please wait until I have finished,\"\nshe said, holding up her hand at an interruption I was about to make.\n\"You and I know he is not a criminal; but he might as well be as far as\nyou are concerned. As district attorney you are doubtless known to the\nlocal authorities. If the Celebrity is arrested after a long pursuit,\nit will avail you nothing to affirm that you knew all along he was the\nnoted writer. You will pardon me if I say that they will not believe you\nthen. He will be taken East for identification. And if I know anything\nabout politics, and especially the state of affairs in local politics\nwith which you are concerned, the incident and the interval following\nit will be fatal to your chances with the railroad,--to your chances in\ngeneral. You perceive, Mr. Crocker, how impossible it is to play with\nfire without being burned.\"\n\nI did perceive. At the time the amazing thoroughness with which she had\ngone into the subject of my own unimportant affairs, the astuteness and\nknowledge of the world she had shown, and the clearness with which she\nhad put the situation, did not strike me. Nothing struck me but the\nalarming sense of my own stupidity, which was as keen as I have\never felt it. What man in a public position, however humble, has not\npolitical enemies? The image of O'Meara was wafted suddenly before me,\ndisagreeably near, and his face wore the smile of victory. All of Mr.\nCooke's money could not save me. My spirits sank as the immediate future\nunfolded itself, and I even read the article in O'Meara's organ, the\nNorthern Lights, which was to be instrumental in divesting me of my\npublic trust and fair fame generally. Yes, if the Celebrity was caught\non the other side of Far Harbor, all would be up with John Crocker! But\nit would never do to let Miss Thorn discover my discomfiture.\n\n\"There is something in what you say,\" I replied, with what bravado I\ncould muster.\n\n\"A little, I think,\" she returned, smiling; \"now, what I wish you to do\nis to make Uncle Fenelon put into Far Harbor. If he refuses, you can go\nin in spite of him, since you and Mr. Farrar are the only ones who can\nsail. You have the situation in your own hands.\"\n\nThere was certainly wisdom in this, also. But the die was cast now, and\npride alone was sufficient to hold me to the course I had rashly begun\nupon. Pride! What an awkward thing it is, and more difficult for most of\nus to swallow than a sponge.\n\n\"I thank you for this interest in my welfare, Miss Thorn,\" I began.\n\n\"No fine speeches, please, sir,\" she cut in, \"but do as I advise.\"\n\n\"I fear I cannot.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that? The thing is simplicity itself.\"\n\n\"I should lose my self-respect as a practical joker. And besides,\" I\nsaid maliciously, \"I started out to have some fun with the Celebrity,\nand I want to have it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she replied, rather coolly, \"of course you can do as you\nchoose.\"\n\nWe were passing within a hundred yards of the lighthouse, set\ncheerlessly on the bald and sandy tip of the point. An icy silence\nsat between us, and such a silence is invariably insinuating. This one\nsuggested a horrible thought. What if Miss Thorn had warned me in\norder to save the Celebrity from humiliation? I thrust it aside, but it\nreturned again and grinned. Had she not practised insincerity before?\nAnd any one with half an eye could see that she was in love with the\nCelebrity; even the Fraction had remarked it. What more natural than,\nwith her cleverness, she had hit upon this means of terminating the\nauthor's troubles by working upon my fears?\n\nHuman weakness often proves too much for those of us who have the very\nbest intentions. Up to now the refrigerator and Mr. Trevor had kept\nthe strictest and most jealous of vigils over Irene. But at length the\nsenator succumbed to the drowsiness which never failed to attack him\nat this hour, and he forgot the disrepute of his surroundings in a\nrespectable sleep. Whereupon his daughter joined us on the forecastle.\n\n\"I knew that would happen to papa if I only waited long enough,\" she\nsaid. \"Oh, he thinks you're dreadful, Mr. Crocker. He says that nowadays\nyoung men haven't any principle. I mustn't be seen talking to you.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to convince Mr. Crocker that his stand in the matter\nis not only immoral, but suicidal,\" said Miss Thorn. \"Perhaps,\" she\nadded meaningly, \"he will listen to you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" answered Miss Trevor.\n\n\"Miss Thorn has been good enough to point out,\" I explained, \"that the\npolitical machine in this section, which has the honor to detest me,\nwill seize upon the pretext of the Celebrity's capture to ruin me. They\nwill take the will for the deed.\"\n\n\"Of course they will do just that,\" cried Miss Trevor. \"How bright of\nyou to think of it, Marian!\"\n\nMiss Thorn stood up.\n\n\"I leave you to persuade him,\" said she; \"I have no doubt you will be\nable to do it.\"\n\nWith that she left us, quite suddenly. Abruptly, I thought. And her\nmanner seemed to impress Miss Trevor.\n\n\"I wonder what is the matter with Marian,\" said she, and leaned over the\nskylight. \"Why, she has gone down to talk with the Celebrity.\"\n\n\"Isn't that rather natural?\" I asked with asperity.\n\nShe turned to me with an amused expression.\n\n\"Her conduct seems to worry you vastly, Mr. Crocker. I noticed that you\nwere quite upset this morning in the cave. Why was it?\"\n\n\"You must have imagined it,\" I said stiffly.\n\n\"I should like to know,\" she said, with the air of one trying to solve\na knotty problem, \"I should like to know how many men are as blind as\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are quite beyond me, Miss Trevor,\" I answered; \"may I request you\nto put that remark in other words?\"\n\n\"I protest that you are a most unsatisfactory person,\" she went on, not\nheeding my annoyance. \"Most abnormally modest people are. If I were to\nstick you with this hat-pin, for instance, you would accept the matter\nas a positive insult.\"\n\n\"I certainly should,\" I said, laughing; \"and, besides, it would be\npainful.\"\n\n\"There you are,\" said she, exultingly; \"I knew it. But I flatter myself\nthere are men who would go into an ecstasy of delight if I ran a hat-pin\ninto them. I am merely taking this as an illustration of my point.\"\n\n\"It is a very fine point,\" said I. \"But some people take pleasure in\nodd things. I can easily conceive of a man gallant enough to suffer the\nagony for the sake of pleasing a pretty girl.\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" she pouted; \"you have missed it entirely. You are\nhopelessly blind on that side, and numb. Perhaps you didn't know that\nyou have had a hat-pin sticking in you for some time.\"\n\nI began feeling myself, nervously.\n\n\"For more than a month,\" she cried, \"and to think that you have never\nfelt it.\" My action was too much for her gravity, and she fell back\nagainst the skylight in a fit of merriment, which threatened to wake her\nfather. And I hoped it would.\n\n\"It pleases you to speak in parables this morning,\" I said.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" she began again, when she had regained her speech, \"shall\nI tell you of a great misfortune which might happen to a girl?\"\n\n\"I should be pleased to hear it,\" I replied courteously.\n\n\"That misfortune, then, would be to fall in love with you.\"\n\n\"Happily that is not within the limits of probability,\" I answered,\nbeginning to be a little amused. \"But why?\"\n\n\"Lightning often strikes where it is least expected,\" she replied\narchly. \"Listen. If a young woman were unlucky enough to lose her heart\nto you, she might do everything but tell you, and you would never know\nit. I scarcely believe you would know it if she did tell you.\"\n\nI must have jumped unconsciously.\n\n\"Oh, you needn't think I am in love with you.\"\n\n\"Not for a minute,\" I made haste to say.\n\nShe pointed towards the timber-covered hills beyond the shore.\n\n\"Do you see that stream which comes foaming down the notch into the lake\nin front of us?\" she asked. \"Let us suppose that you lived in a cabin\nbeside that brook; and that once in a while, when you went out to draw\nyour water, you saw a nugget of--gold washing along with the pebbles\non the bed. How many days do you think you would be in coming to the\nconclusion that there was a pocket of gold somewhere above you, and in\nstarting in search of it?\"\n\n\"Not long, surely.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are not lacking in perception there. But if I were to tell you\nthat I knew of the existence of such a mine, from various proofs I have\nhad, and that the mine was in the possession of a certain person who was\nquite willing to share it with you on application, you would not believe\nme.\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Trevor, with a nod of finality, \"I was actually about\nto make such a disclosure. But I see it would be useless.\"\n\nI confess she aroused my curiosity. No coaxing, however, would induce\nher to interpret.\n\n\"No,\" she insisted strangely, \"if you cannot put two and two together, I\nfear I cannot help you. And no one I ever heard of has come to any good\nby meddling.\"\n\nMiss Trevor folded her hands across her lap. She wore that air which\nI am led to believe is common to all women who have something of\nimportance to disclose; or at least what they consider is of importance.\nThere was an element of pity, too, in her expression. For she had given\nme my chance, and my wits had been found wanting.\n\nDo not let it be surmised that I attach any great value to such banter\nas she had been indulging in. At the same time, however, I had an\nuneasy feeling that I had missed something which might have been to\nmy advantage. It was in vain that I whipped my dull senses; but one\nconclusion was indicated by all this inference, and I don't care even to\nmention that: it was preposterous.\n\nThen Miss Trevor shifted to a very serious mood. She honestly did her\nbest to persuade me to relinquish our enterprise, to go to Mr. Cooke and\nconfess the whole thing.\n\n\"I wish we had washed our hands of this Celebrity from the first,\" she\nsaid, with a sigh. \"How dreadful if you lose your position on account of\nthis foolishness!\"\n\n\"But I shan't,\" I answered reassuringly; \"we are getting near the border\nnow, and no sign of trouble. And besides,\" I added, \"I think Miss Thorn\ntried to frighten me. And she very nearly succeeded. It was prettily\ndone.\"\n\n\"Of course she tried to frighten you. I wish she had succeeded.\"\n\n\"But her object was transparent.\"\n\n\"Her object!\" she exclaimed. \"Her object was to save you.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" I replied; \"it was to save the Celebrity.\"\n\nMiss Trevor rose and grasped one of the sail rings to keep her balance.\nShe looked at me pityingly.\n\n\"Do you really believe that?\"\n\n\"Firmly.\"\n\n\"Then you are hopeless, Mr. Crocker, totally hopeless. I give you up.\"\nAnd she went back to her seat beside the refrigerator.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\"Crocker, old man, Crocker, what the devil does that mean?\"\n\nI turned with a start to perceive a bare head thrust above the cabin\nroof, the scant hair flying, and two large, brown eyes staring into mine\nfull of alarm and reproach. A plump finger was pointing to where the\nsandy reef lay far astern of us.\n\nThe Mackinaws were flecked far and wide over the lake, and a dirty\nsmudge on the blue showed where the Far Harbor and Beaverton boat had\ngone over the horizon. But there, over the point and dangerously close\nto the land, hung another smudge, gradually pushing its way like a\nwrithing, black serpent, lakewards. Thus I was rudely jerked back to\nface the problem with which we had left the island that morning.\n\nI snatched the neglected glasses from the deck and hurried aft to join\nmy client on the overhang, but a pipe was all they revealed above the\nbleak hillocks of sand. My client turned to me with a face that was\nwhite under the tan.\n\n\"Crocker,\" he cried, in a tragic voice, \"it's a blessed police boat, or\nI never picked a winner.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I said; \"other boats smoke beside police boats. The lake is\nfull of tugs.\"\n\nI was a little nettled at having been scared for a molehill.\n\n\"But I know it, sure as hell,\" he insisted.\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and won't for an hour. What's a pipe and a\ntrail of smoke?\"\n\nHe laid a hand on my shoulder, and I felt it tremble.\n\n\"Why do you suppose I came out?\" he demanded solemnly.\n\n\"You were probably losing,\" I said.\n\n\"I was winning.\"\n\n\"Then you got tired of winning.\"\n\nBut he held up a thumb within a few inches of my face, and with it a\nring I had often noticed, a huge opal which he customarily wore on the\ninside of his hand.\n\n\"She's dead,\" said Mr. Cooke, sadly.\n\n\"Dead?\" I repeated, perplexed.\n\n\"Yes, she's dead as the day I lost the two thousand at Sheepshead. She's\nnever gone back on me yet. And unless I can make some little arrangement\nwith those fellows,\" he added, tossing his head at the smoke, \"you and I\nwill put up to-night in some barn of a jail. I've never been in jail but\nonce,\" said Mr. Cooke, \"and it isn't so damned pleasant, I assure\nyou.\" I saw that he believed every word of it; in fact, that it was\nhis religion. I might as well have tried to argue the Sultan out of\nMohammedanism.\n\nThe pipe belonged to a tug, that was certain. Farrar said so after a\nlook over his shoulder, disdaining glasses, and he knew the lake better\nthan many who made their living by it. It was then that I made note of a\ncurious anomaly in the betting character; for thus far Mr. Cooke, like a\ngreat many of his friends, was a skeptic. He never ceased to hope until\nthe stake had found its way into the other man's pocket. And it was for\nhope that he now applied to Farrar. But even Farrar did not attempt to\naccount for the tug's appearance that near the land.\n\n\"She's in some detestable hurry to get up this way, that's flat,\" he\nsaid; \"where she is, the channel out of the harbor is not forty feet\nwide.\"\n\nBy this time the rest of the party were gathered behind us on the high\nside of the boat, in different stages of excitement, scrutinizing the\nsmoke. Mr. Cooke had the glasses glued to his eyes again, his feet\nbraced apart, and every line of his body bespeaking the tension of\nhis mind. I imagined him standing thus, the stump of his cigar tightly\nclutched between his teeth, following the fortunes of some favorite on\nthe far side of the Belmont track.\n\nWe waited without comment while the smoke crept by degrees towards the\nlittle white spindle on the tip of the point, now and again catching\na gleam of the sun's rays from off the glass of the lantern. And\npresently, against the white lather of the lake, I thought I caught\nsight of a black nose pushed out beyond the land. Another moment, and\nthe tug itself was bobbing in the open. Barely had she reached the deep\nwater beyond the sands when her length began to shorten, and the dense\ncloud of smoke that rose made it plain that she was firing. At the sight\nI reflected that I had been a fool indeed. A scant few miles of water\nlay between us and her, and if they really meant business back there,\nand they gave every sign of it, we had about an hour and a half to get\nrid of the Celebrity. The Maria was a good boat, but she had not been\nbuilt to try conclusions with a Far Harbor tug.\n\nMy client, in spite of the ominous condition of his opal, was not slow\nto make his intentions exceedingly clear. For Mr. Cooke was first and\nlast, and always, a gentleman. After that you might call him anything\nyou pleased. Meditatively he screwed up his glasses and buckled\nthem into the case, and then he descended to the cockpit. It was the\nCelebrity he singled out of the party.\n\n\"Allen,\" said he, when he stood before him, \"I want to impress on you\nthat my word's gold. I've stuck to you thus far, and I'll be damned now\nif I throw you over, like they did Jonah.\"\n\nMr. Cooke spoke with a fine dignity that in itself was impressive, and\nwhen he had finished he looked about him until his eye rested on Mr.\nTrevor, as though opposition were to come from that quarter. And the\nsenator gave every sign of another eruption. But the Celebrity, either\nfrom lack of appreciation of my client's loyalty, or because of the\nnervousness which was beginning to show itself in his demeanor, despite\nan effort to hide it, returned no answer. He turned on his heel and\nresumed his seat in the cabin. Mr. Cooke was visibly affected.\n\n\"I'd sooner lose my whip hand than go back on him now,\" he declared.\n\nThen Vesuvius began to rumble.\n\n\"Mr. Cooke,\" said the senator, \"may I suggest something which seems\npertinent to me, though it does not appear to have occurred to you?\"\n\nHis tone was the calm one that the heroes used in the Celebrity's novels\nwhen they were about to drop on and annihilate wicked men.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" my client replied briskly, bringing himself up on his\nway back to the overhang.\n\n\"You have announced your intention of 'standing by' Mr. Allen, as you\nexpress it. Have you reflected that there are some others who deserve to\nbe consulted and considered beside Mr. Allen and yourself?\"\n\nMr. Cooke was puzzled at this change of front, and unused, moreover, to\nthat veiled irony of parliamentary expression.\n\n\"Talk English, my friend,\" said he.\n\n\"In plain words, sir, Mr. Allen is a criminal who ought to be locked\nup; he is a menace to society. You, who have a reputation, I am given to\nunderstand, for driving four horses, have nothing to lose by a scandal,\nwhile I have worked all my life for the little I have achieved, and\nhave a daughter to think about. I will neither stand by Mr. Allen nor by\nyou.\"\n\nMr. Cooke was ready with a retort when the true significance of this\nstruck him. Things were a trifle different now. The tables had turned\nsince leaving the island, and the senator held it in his power to ruin\nour one remaining chance of escape. Strangely enough, he missed the\ncause of Mr. Cooke's hesitation.\n\n\"Look here, old man,\" said my client, biting off another cigar, \"I'm a\nfirst-rate fellow when you get to know me, and I'd do the same for you\nas I'm doing for Allen.\"\n\n\"I daresay, sir, I daresay,\" said the other, a trifle mollified; \"I\ndon't claim that you're not acting as you think right.\"\n\n\"I see it,\" said Mr. Cooke, with admirable humility; \"I see it. I was\nwrong to haul you into this, Trevor. And the only thing to consider now\nis, how to get you out of it.\"\n\nHere he appeared for a moment to be wrapped in deep thought, and checked\nwith his cigar an attempt to interrupt him.\n\n\"However you put it, old man,\" he said at last, \"we're all in a pretty\nbad hole.\"\n\n\"All!\" cried Mr. Trevor, indignantly.\n\n\"Yes, all,\" asserted Mr. Cooke, with composure. \"There are the police,\nand here is Allen as good as run down. If they find him when they get\nabroad, you don't suppose they'll swallow anything you have to say about\ntrying to deliver him over. No, sir, you'll be bagged and fined along\nwith the rest of us. And I'd be damned sorry to see it, if I do say it;\nand I blame myself freely for it, old man. Now you take my advice and\nkeep your mouth shut, and I'll take care of you. I've got a place for\nAllen.\"\n\nDuring this somewhat remarkable speech Mr. Trevor, as it were, blew hot\nand cold by turns. Although its delivery was inconsiderate, its logic\nwas undeniable, and the senator sat down again on the locker, and was\nsilent. But I marked that off and on his fingers would open and shut\nconvulsively.\n\nTime alone would disclose what was to happen to us; in the interval\nthere was nothing to do but wait. We had reached the stage where anxiety\nbegins to take the place of excitement, and we shifted restlessly from\nspot to spot and looked at the tug. She was ploughing along after us,\nand to such good purpose that presently I began to catch the white of\nthe seas along her bows, and the bright red with which her pipe was\ntipped. Farrar alone seemed to take but slight interest in her. More\nthan once I glanced at him as he stood under me, but his eye was on the\nshuddering leach of the sail. Then I leaned over.\n\n\"What do you think of it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I told you this morning Drew would have handcuffs on him before night,\"\nhe replied, without raising his head.\n\n\"Hang your joking, Farrar; I know more than you about it.\"\n\n\"Then what's the use of asking me?\"\n\n\"Don't you see that I'm ruined if we're caught?\" I demanded, a little\nwarmly.\n\n\"No, I don't see it,\" he replied. \"You don't suppose I think you fool\nenough to risk this comedy if the man were guilty, do you? I don't\nbelieve all that rubbish about his being the criminal's double, either.\nThat's something the girls got up for your benefit.\"\n\nI ignored this piece of brutality.\n\n\"But I'm ruined anyway.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nI explained shortly what I thought our friend, O'Meara, would do under\nthe circumstances. An inference sufficed Farrar.\n\n\"Why didn't you say something about this before?\" he asked gravely. \"I\nwould have put into Far Harbor.\"\n\n\"Because I didn't think of it,\" I confessed.\n\nFarrar pulled down the corners of his mouth with trying not to smile.\n\n\"Miss Thorn is a woman of brains,\" he remarked gently; \"I respect her.\"\n\nI wondered by what mysterious train of reasoning he had arrived at this\nconclusion. He said nothing for a while, but toyed with the spokes of\nthe wheel, keeping the wind in the sail with undue nicety.\n\n\"I can't make them out,\" he said, all at once.\n\n\"Then you believe they're after us?\"\n\n\"I changed the course a point or two, just to try them.\"\n\n\"And--\"\n\n\"And they changed theirs.\"\n\n\"Who could have informed?\"\n\n\"Drew, of course,\" I said; \"who else?\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Drew doesn't know anything about Allen,\" said he; \"and, besides, he's\nno more of a detective than I am.\"\n\n\"But Drew was told there was a criminal on the island.\"\n\n\"Who told him?\"\n\nI repeated the conversation between Drew and Mr. Trevor which I had\noverheard. Farrar whistled.\n\n\"But you did not speak of that this morning,\" said he.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, feeling anything but comfortable. At times when he was\nfacetious as he had been this morning I was wont to lose sight of the\nfact that with Farrar the manner was not the man, and to forget the\nwarmth of his friendship. I was again to be reminded of this.\n\n\"Well, Crocker,\" he said briefly, \"I would willingly give up this year's\nstate contract to have known it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIt was, accurately as I can remember, half after noon when Mr. Cooke\nfirst caught the smoke over the point, for the sun was very high: at two\nour fate had been decided. I have already tried to describe a part of\nwhat took place in that hour and a half, although even now I cannot get\nit all straight in my mind. Races, when a great deal is at stake,\nare more or less chaotic: a close four miles in a college eight is\na succession of blurs with lucid but irrelevant intervals. The weary\nmonths of hard work are forgotten, and you are quite as apt to think\nof your first velocipede, or of the pie that is awaiting you in the\nboathouse, as of victory and defeat. And a yacht race, with a pair of\nrivals on your beam, is very much the same.\n\nAs I sat with my feet dangling over the washboard, I reflected, once or\ntwice, that we were engaged in a race. All I had to do was to twist my\nhead in order to make sure of it. I also reflected, I believe, that I\nwas in the position of a man who has bet all he owns, with large odds\non losing either way. But on the whole I was occupied with more trivial\nmatters a letter I had forgotten to write about a month's rent, a client\nwhose summer address I had mislaid. The sun was burning my neck behind\nwhen a whistle aroused me to the realization that the tug was no longer\na toy boat dancing in the distance, but a stern fact but two miles away.\nThere could be no mistake now, for I saw the white steam of the signal\nagainst the smoke.\n\nI slid down and went into the cabin. The Celebrity was in the corner by\nthe companionway, with his head on the cushions and a book in his hand.\nAnd forward, under the low deck beams beyond the skylight, I beheld the\ncrouching figure of my client. He had stripped off his coat and was busy\nat some task on the floor.\n\n\"They're whistling for us to stop,\" I said to him.\n\n\"How near are they, old man?\" he asked, without looking up. The\nperspiration was streaming down his face, and he held a brace and bit in\nhis hand. Under him was the trap-door which gave access to the ballast\nbelow, and through this he had bored a neat hole. The yellow chips were\nstill on his clothes.\n\n\"They're not two miles away,\" I answered. \"But what in mystery are you\ndoing there?\"\n\nBut he only laid a finger beside his nose and bestowed a wink in my\ndirection. Then he took some ashes from his cigar, wetted his finger,\nand thus ingeniously removed all appearance of newness from the hole\nhe had made, carefully cleaning up the chips and putting them in his\npocket. Finally he concealed the brace and bit and opened the trap,\ndisclosing the rough stones of the ballast. I watched him in amazement\nas he tore a mattress from an adjoining bunk and forced it through the\nopening, spreading it fore and aft over the stones.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, regaining his feet and surveying the whole with\nundisguised satisfaction, \"he'll be as safe there as in my new family\nvault.\"\n\n\"But,\" I began, a light dawning upon me.\n\n\"Allen, old man,\" said Mr. Cooke, \"come here.\"\n\nThe Celebrity laid down his book and looked up: my client was putting on\nhis coat.\n\n\"Come here, old man,\" he repeated.\n\nAnd he actually came. But he stopped when he caught sight of the open\ntrap and of the mattress beneath it.\n\n\"How will that suit you?\" asked Mr. Cooke, smiling broadly as he wiped\nhis face with an embroidered handkerchief.\n\nThe Celebrity looked at the mattress, then at me, and lastly at Mr.\nCooke. His face was a study:\n\n\"And--And you think I am going to get in there?\" he said, his voice\nshaking.\n\nMy client fell back a step.\n\n\"Why not?\" he demanded. \"It's about your size, comfortable, and all the\nair you want\" (here Mr. Cooke stuck his finger through the bit hole).\n\"Damn me, if I were in your fix, I wouldn't stop at a kennel.\"\n\n\"Then you're cursed badly mistaken,\" said the Celebrity, going back to\nhis corner; \"I'm tired of being made an ass of for you and your party.\"\n\n\"An ass!\" exclaimed my client, in proper indignation.\n\n\"Yes, an ass,\" said the Celebrity. And he resumed his book.\n\nIt would seem that a student of human nature, such as every successful\nwriter should be, might by this time have arrived at some conception of\nmy client's character, simple as it was, and have learned to overlook\nthe slight peculiarity in his mode of expressing himself. But here the\nCelebrity fell short, if my client's emotions were not pitched in the\nsame key as those of other people, who shall say that his heart was not\nas large or his sympathies as wide as many another philanthropist?\n\nBut Mr. Cooke was an optimist, and as such disposed to look at the best\nside of his friends and ignore the worst; if, indeed, he perceived their\nfaults at all. It was plain to me, even now, that he did not comprehend\nthe Celebrity's attitude. That his guest should reject the one hope of\nescape left him was, according to Mr. Cooke, only to be accounted for by\na loss of mental balance. Nevertheless, his disappointment was keen. He\nlet down the door and slowly led the way out of the cabin. The whistle\nsounded shrilly in our ears.\n\nMr. Cooke sat down and drew a wallet from his pocket. He began to count\nthe bills, and, as if by common consent, the Four followed suit. It\nwas a task which occupied some minutes, and when completed my client\nproduced a morocco note-book and a pencil. He glanced interrogatively at\nthe man nearest him.\n\n\"Three hundred and fifty.\"\n\nMr. Cooke put it down. It was entirely a matter of course. What else\nwas there to be done? And when he had gone the round of his followers he\nturned to Farrar and me.\n\n\"How much are you fellows equal to?\" he asked.\n\nI believe he did it because he felt we should resent being left out: and\nso we should have. Mr. Cooke's instincts were delicate.\n\nWe told him. Then he paused, his pencil in the air, and his eyes\ndoubtfully fixed on the senator. For all this time Mr. Trevor had\nbeen fidgeting in his seat; but now he opened his long coat, button by\nbutton, and thrust his hand inside the flap. Oh, Falstaff!\n\n\"Father, father!\" exclaimed Miss Trevor. But her tongue was in her\ncheek.\n\nI have heard it stated that if a thoroughly righteous man were cast\naway with ninety and nine ruffians, each of the ruffians would gain\none-one-hundredth in virtue, whilst the righteous man would sink to\ntheir new level. I am not able to say how much better Mr. Cooke's party\nwas for Mr. Trevor's company, but the senator seemed to realize that\nsomething serious had happened to him, for his voice was not altogether\nsteady as he pronounced the amount of his contribution.\n\n\"Trevor,\" cried Mr. Cooke, with great fervor, \"I take it all back.\nYou're a true, public-spirited old sport.\"\n\nBut the senator had not yet reached that extreme of degradation where it\nis pleasurable to be congratulated on wickedness.\n\nMy client added up the figures and rubbed his hands. I regret to\nsay that the aggregate would have bought up three small police\norganizations, body and soul.\n\n\"Pull up, Farrar, old man,\" he shouted.\n\nFarrar released the wheel and threw the Maria into the wind. With the\nsail cracking and the big boom dodging over our heads, we watched the\ntug as she drew nearer and nearer, until we could hear the loud beating\nof her engines. On one side some men were making ready to lower a boat,\nand then a conspicuous figure in blue stood out by the davits. Then came\nthe faint tinkle of a bell, and the H Sinclair, of Far Harbor, glided up\nand thrashed the water scarce a biscuit-throw away.\n\n\"Hello, there!\" the man in uniform called out. It was Captain McCann,\nchief of the Far Harbor police.\n\nMr. Cooke waved his cigar politely.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Cooke's yacht, the Maria?\n\n\"The same,\" said Mr. Cooke.\n\n\"I'm fearing I'll have to come aboard you, Mr. Cooke.\"\n\n\"All right, old man, glad to have you,\" said my client.\n\nThis brought a smile to McCann's face as he got into his boat. We were\nall standing in the cockpit, save the Celebrity, who was just inside of\nthe cabin door. I had time to note that he was pale, and no more: I must\nhave been pale myself. A few strokes brought the chief to the Maria's\nstern.\n\n\"It's not me that likes to interfere with a gent's pleasure party, but\nbusiness is business,\" said he, as he climbed aboard.\n\nMy client's hospitality was oriental.\n\n\"Make yourself at home, old man,\" he said, a box of his largest and\nblackest cigars in his hand. And these he advanced towards McCann before\nthe knot was tied in the painter.\n\nThen a wave of self-reproach swept over me. Was it possible that I, like\nMr. Trevor, had been deprived of all the morals I had ever possessed?\nCould it be that the district attorney was looking calmly on while Mr.\nCooke wilfully corrupted the Far Harbor chief-of-police? As agonizing a\nminute as I ever had in my life was that which it took McCann to survey\nthose cigars. His broad features became broader still, as a huge, red\nhand was reached out. I saw it close lingeringly over the box, and then\nMr. Cooke had struck a match. The chief stepped over the washboard onto\nthe handsome turkey-red cushions on the seats, and thus he came face to\nface with me.\n\n\"Holy fathers!\" he exclaimed. \"Is it you who are here, Mr. Crocker?\" And\nhe pulled off his cap.\n\n\"No other, McCann,\" said I, with what I believe was a most pitiful\nattempt at braggadocio.\n\nMcCann began to puff at his cigar. Clouds of smoke came out of his face\nand floated down the wind. He was so visibly embarrassed that I gained a\nlittle courage.\n\n\"And what brings you here?\" I demanded.\n\nHe scrutinized me in perplexity.\n\n\"I think you're guessing, sir.\"\n\n\"Never a guess, McCann. You'll have to explain yourself.\"\n\nMcCann had once had a wholesome respect for me. But it looked now as if\nthe bottom was dropping out of it.\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Crocker,\" he said, \"what would you be doing in such company\nas I'm hunting for? Can it be that ye're helping to lift a criminal over\nthe border?\"\n\n\"McCann,\" I asked sternly, \"what have you had on the tug?\"\n\nForce of habit proved too much for the man. He went back to the\napologetic.\n\n\"Never a drop, Mr. Crocker. Upon me soul!\"\n\nThis reminded Mr. Cooke of something (be it recorded) that he had for\nonce forgotten. He lifted up the top of the refrigerator. The chief's\neye followed him. But I was not going to permit this.\n\n\"Now, McCann,\" I commenced again, \"if you will state your business here,\nif you have any, I shall be obliged. You are delaying Mr. Cooke.\"\n\nThe chief was seized with a nervous tremor. I think we were a pair in\nthat, only I managed to keep mine, under. When it came to the point,\nand any bribing was to be done, I had hit upon a course. Self-respect\ndemanded a dignity on my part. With a painful indecision McCann pulled\na paper from his pocket which I saw was a warrant. And he dropped his\ncigar. Mr. Cooke was quick to give him another.\n\n\"Ye come from Bear Island, Mr. Crocker?\" he inquired.\n\nI replied in the affirmative.\n\n\"I hope it's news I'm telling you,\" he said soberly; \"I'm hoping it's\nnews when I say that I'm here for Mr. Charles Wrexell Allen,--that's the\ngentleman's name. He's after taking a hundred thousand dollars away from\nBoston.\" Then he turned to Mr. Cooke. \"The gentleman was aboard your\nboat, sir, when you left that country place of yours,--what d'ye call\nit?--Mohair? Thank you, sir.\" And he wiped the water from his brow. \"And\nthey're telling me he was on Bear Island with ye? Sure, sir, and I can't\nsee why a gentleman of your standing would be wanting to get him over\nthe border. But I must do my duty. Begging your pardon, Mr. Crocker,\" he\nadded, with a bow to me.\n\n\"Certainly, McCann,\" I said.\n\nFor a space there was only the bumping and straining of the yacht and\nthe swish of the water against her sides. Then the chief spoke again.\n\n\"It will be saving you both trouble and inconvenience, Mr. Crocker, if\nyou give him up, sir.\"\n\nWhat did the man mean? Why in the name of the law didn't he make a\nmove? I was conscious that my client was fumbling in his clothes for the\nwallet; that he had muttered an invitation for the chief to go inside.\nMcCann smoked uneasily.\n\n\"I don't want to search the boat, sir.\"\n\nAt these words we all turned with one accord towards the cabin. I felt\nFarrar gripping my arm tightly from behind.\n\nThe Celebrity had disappeared!\n\nIt was Mr. Cooke who spoke.\n\n\"Search the boat!\" he said, something between a laugh and a cry.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the chief repeated firmly. \"It's sorry I am to do it, with\nMr. Crocker here, too.\"\n\nI have always maintained that nature had endowed my client with rare\ngifts; and the ease with which he now assumed a part thus unexpectedly\nthrust upon him, as well as the assurance with which he carried it out,\ngoes far to prove it.\n\n\"If there's anything in your line aboard, chief,\" he said blandly, \"help\nyourself!\"\n\nSome of us laughed. I thought things a little too close to be funny.\nSince the Celebrity had lost his nerve and betaken himself to the place\nof concealment Mr. Cooke had prepared for him, the whole composition of\nthe affair was changed. Before, if McCann had arrested the ostensible\nMr. Allen, my word, added to fifty dollars from my client, would\nprobably have been sufficient. Should he be found now, no district\nattorney on the face of the earth could induce the chief to believe that\nhe was any other than the real criminal; nor would any bribe be large\nenough to compensate McCann for the consequences of losing so important\na prisoner. There was nothing now but to carry it off with a high hand.\nMcCann got up.\n\n\"Be your lave, Mr. Crocker,\" he said.\n\n\"Never you mind me, McCann,\" I replied, \"but you do what is right.\"\n\nWith that he began his search. It might have been ludicrous if I had\nhad any desire to laugh, for the chief wore the gingerly air of a man\nlooking for a rattlesnake which has to be got somehow. And my client\nassisted at the inspection with all the graces of a dancing-master.\nMcCann poked into the forward lockers where we kept the\nstores,--dropping the iron lid within an inch of his toe,--and the\nclothing-lockers and the sail-lockers. He reached under the bunks, and\ndrew out his hand again quickly, as though he expected to be bitten.\nAnd at last he stood by the trap with the hole in it, under which the\nCelebrity lay prostrate. I could hear my own breathing. But Mr. Cooke\nhad his wits about him still, and at this critical juncture he gave\nMcCann a thump on the back which nearly carried him off his feet.\n\n\"They say the mast is hollow, old man,\" he suggested.\n\n\"Be jabers, Mr. Cooke,\" said McCann, \"and I'm beginning to think it is!\n\n\"He took off his cap and scratched his head.\n\n\"Well, McCann, I hope you're contented,\" I said.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" said he, \"and it's that thankful I am for you that the\ngent ain't here. But with him cutting high finks up at Mr. Cooke's\nhouse with a valet, and him coming on the yacht with yese, and the whole\ncountry in that state about him, begorra,\" said McCann, \"and it's domned\nstrange! Maybe it's swimmin' in the water he is!\"\n\nThe whole party had followed the search, and at this speech of the\nchief's our nervous tension became suddenly relaxed. Most of us sat down\nto laugh.\n\n\"I'm asking no questions, Mr. Crocker, ye'll take notice,\" he remarked,\nhis voice full of reproachful meaning.\n\n\"McCann,\" said I, \"you come outside. I want to speak to you.\"\n\nHe followed me out.\n\n\"Now,\" I went on, \"you know me pretty well\" (he nodded doubtfully), \"and\nif I give you my word that Charles Wrexell Allen is not on this yacht,\nand never has been, is that sufficient?\"\n\n\"Is it the truth you're saying, sir?\"\n\nI assured him that it was.\n\n\"Then where is he, Mr. Crocker?\"\n\n\"God only knows!\" I replied, with fervor. \"I don't, McCann.\"\n\nThe chief was satisfied. He went back into the cabin, and Mr. Cooke, in\nthe exuberance of his joy, produced champagne. McCann had heard of my\nclient and of his luxurious country place, and moreover it was the first\ntime he had ever been on a yellow-plush yacht. He tarried. He drank Mr.\nCooke's health and looked around him in wonder and awe, and his remarks\nwere worthy of record. These sayings and the thought of the author of\nThe Sybarites stifling below with his mouth to an auger-hole kept us in\na continual state of merriment. And at last our visitor rose to go.\n\nAs he was stepping over the side, Mr. Cooke laid hold of a brass button\nand pressed a handful of the black cigars upon him.\n\n\"My regards to the detective, old man,\" said he.\n\nMcCann stared.\n\n\"My regards to Drew,\" my client insisted.\n\n\"Oh!\" said McCann, his face lighting up, \"him with the whiskers, what\ncame from Bear Island in a cat-boat. Sure, he wasn't no detective, sir.\"\n\n\"What was he? A police commissioner?\"\n\n\"Mr. Cooke,\" said McCann, disdainfully, as he got into his boat, \"he\nwasn't nothing but a prospector doing the lake for one of them summer\nhotel companies.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nWhen the biography of the Celebrity is written, and I have no doubt\nit will be some day, may his biographer kindly draw a veil over that\ninstant in his life when he was tenderly and obsequiously raised by Mr.\nCooke from the trap in the floor of the Maria's cabin.\n\nIt is sometimes the case that a good fright will heal a feud. And\nwhereas, before the arrival of the H. Sinclair, there had been much\ndissension and many quarrels concerning the disposal of the quasi\nCharles Wrexell Allen, when the tug steamed away to the southwards but\none opinion remained,--that, like Jonah, he must be got rid of. And\nno one concurred more heartily in this than the Celebrity himself. He\nstrolled about and smoked apathetically, with the manner of one who was\nbored beyond description, whilst the discussion was going on between\nFarrar, Mr. Cooke, and myself as to the best place to land him. When\nconsiderately asked by my client whether he had any choice in the\nmatter, he replied, somewhat facetiously, that he could not think of\nmaking a suggestion to one who had shown such superlative skill in its\nprevious management.\n\nMr. Trevor, too, experienced a change of sentiment in Mr. Cooke's favor.\nIt is not too much to say that the senator's scare had been of such\nthoroughness that he was willing to agree to almost anything. He had\ncome so near to being relieved of that most precious possession, his\nrespectability, that the reason in Mr. Cooke's course now appealed to\nhim very strongly. Thus he became a tacit assenter in wrong-doing,\nfor circumstances thrust this, once in a while, upon the best of our\ncitizens.\n\nThe afternoon wore cool; nay, cold is a better word. The wind brought\nwith it a suggestion of the pine-clad wastes of the northwestern\nwilderness whence it came, and that sure harbinger of autumn, the\nblue haze, settled around the hills, and benumbed the rays of the sun\nlingering over the crests. Farrar and I, as navigators, were glad to get\ninto our overcoats, while the others assembled in the little cabin and\nlighted the gasoline stove which stood in the corner. Outside we had our\npipes for consolation, and the sunset beauty of the lake.\n\nBy six we were well over the line, and consulting our chart, we selected\na cove behind a headland on our left, which seemed the best we could do\nfor an anchorage, although it was shallow and full of rocks. As we were\nchanging our course to run in, Mr. Cooke appeared, bundled up in his\nreefer. He was in the best of spirits, and was good enough to concur\nwith our plans.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" asked Farrar, \"what do you propose to do with Allen?\"\n\nBut our client only chuckled.\n\n\"Wait and see, old man,\" he said; \"I've got that all fixed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Farrar remarked, when he had gone in again, \"he has steered it\ndeuced well so far. I think we can trust him.\"\n\nIt was dark when we dropped anchor, a very tired party indeed; and as\nthe Maria could not accommodate us all with sleeping quarters, Mr. Cooke\ndecided that the ladies should have the cabin, since the night was cold.\nAnd so it might have been, had not Miss Thorn flatly refused to sleep\nthere. The cabin was stuffy, she said, and so she carried her point.\nLeaving Farrar and one of Mr. Cooke's friends to take care of the yacht,\nthe rest of us went ashore, built a roaring fire and raised a tent, and\nproceeded to make ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would\nallow. The sense of relief over the danger passed produced a kind of\nlightheartedness amongst us, and the topics broached at supper would\nnot have been inappropriate at a friendly dinner party. As we were\nseparating for the night Miss Thorn said to me:\n\n\"I am so happy for your sake, Mr. Crocker, that he was not discovered.\"\n\nFor my sake! Could she really have meant it, after all? I went to sleep\nthinking of that sentence, beside my client beneath the trees. And it\nwas first in my thoughts when I awoke.\n\nAs we dipped our faces in the brook the next morning my client laughed\nsoftly to himself between the gasps, and I knew that he had in mind the\nlast consummate touch to his successful enterprise. And the revelation\ncame when the party were assembled at breakfast. Mr. Cooke stood up, and\ndrawing from his pocket a small and mysterious paper parcel he forthwith\ndelivered himself in the tone and manner which had so endeared him to\nthe familiars of the Lake House bar.\n\n\"I'm not much for words, as you all know,\" said he, with becoming\nmodesty, \"and I don't set up to be an orator. I am just what you see\nhere,--a damned plain man. And there's only one virtue that I lay any\nclaim to,--no one can say that I ever went back on a friend. I want to\nthank all of you (looking at the senator) for what you have done for\nme and Allen. It's not for us to talk about that hundred thousand\ndollars.--My private opinion is (he seemed to have no scruples about\nmaking it public) that Allen is insane. No, old man, don't interrupt me;\nbut you haven't acted just right, and that's a fact. And I won't feel\nsquare with myself until I put him where I found him, in safety. I am\nsorry to say, my friends,\" he added, with emotion, \"that Mr. Allen is\nabout to leave us.\"\n\nHe paused for breath, palpably satisfied with so much of it, and with\nthe effect on his audience.\n\n\"Now,\" continued he, \"we start this morning for a place which is only\nfour miles or so from the town of Saville, and I shall then request my\nesteemed legal adviser, Mr. Crocker, to proceed to the town and buy a\nready-made suit of clothes for Mr. Allen, a slouch hat, a cheap necktie,\nand a stout pair of farmer's boots. And I have here,\" he said, holding\nup the package, \"I have here the rest of it. My friends, you heard the\nchief tell me that Drew was doing the lake for a summer hotel syndicate.\nBut if Drew wasn't a detective you can throw me into the lake! He wasn't\nexactly Pinkerton, and I flatter myself that we were too many for\nhim,\" said Mr. Cooke, with deserved pride; \"and he went away in such\na devilish hurry that he forgot his hand-bag with some of his extra\nthings.\"\n\nThen my client opened the package, and held up on a string before our\nastonished eyes a wig, a pair of moustaches, and two bushy red whiskers.\n\nAnd this was Mr. Cooke's scheme! Did it electrify his hearers? Perhaps.\nEven the senator was so choked with laughter that he was forced to cast\nloose one of the buttons which held on his turn-down collar, and Farrar\nretired into the woods. But the gravity of Mr. Cooke's countenance\nremained serene.\n\n\"Old man,\" he said to the Celebrity, \"you'll have to learn the price of\npotatoes now. Here are Mr. Drew's duplicates; try 'em on.\"\n\nThis the Celebrity politely but firmly refused to do.\n\n\"Cooke,\" said he, \"it has never been my lot to visit so kind and\nconsiderate a host, or to know a man who pursued his duty with so little\nthought and care of his own peril. I wish to thank you, and to apologize\nfor any hasty expressions I may have dropped by mistake, and I would\nit were possible to convince you that I am neither a maniac nor an\nembezzler. But, if it's just the same to you, I believe I can get along\nwithout the disguise you mentioned, and so save Mr. Crocker his pains.\nIn short, if you will set me down at Saville, I am willing to take my\nchances of reaching the Canadian Pacific from that point without fear of\ndetection.\"\n\nThe Celebrity's speech produced a good impression on all save Mr. Cooke,\nwho appeared a trifle water-logged. He had dealt successfully with Mr.\nAllen when that gentleman had been in defiant moods, or in moods of\nugly sarcasm. But this good-natured, turn-you-down-easy note puzzled my\nclient not a little. Was this cherished scheme a whim or a joke to\nbe lightly cast aside? Mr. Cooke thought not. The determination which\ndistinguished him still sat in his eye as he bustled about giving orders\nfor the breaking of camp. This refractory criminal must be saved from\nhimself, cost what it might, and responsibility again rested heavy on my\nclient's mind as I rowed him out to the Maria.\n\n\"Crocker,\" he said, \"if Allen is scooped in spite of us, you have got to\ngo East and make him out an idiot.\"\n\nHe seemed to think that I had a talent for this particular defence. I\nreplied that I would do my best.\n\n\"It won't be difficult,\" he went on; \"not near as tough as that case you\nwon for me. You can bring in all the bosh about his claiming to be an\nauthor, you know. And I'll stand expenses.\"\n\nThis was downright generous of Mr. Cooke. We have all, no doubt, drawn\nour line between what is right and what is wrong, but I have often\nwondered how many of us with the world's indorsement across our backs\ntrespass as little on the other side of the line as he.\n\nAfter Farrar and the Four got aboard it fell to my lot to row the rest\nof the party to the yacht. And this was no slight task that morning. The\ntender was small, holding but two beside the man at the oars, and owing\nto the rocks and shallow water of which I have spoken, the Maria lay\nconsiderably over a quarter of a mile out. Hence each trip occupied some\ntime. Mr. Cooke I had transferred with a load of canvas and the tent\npoles, and next I returned for Mrs. Cooke and Mr. Trevor, whom I\ndeposited safely. Then I landed again, helped in Miss Trevor and Miss\nThorn, leaving the Celebrity for the last, and was pulling for the yacht\nwhen a cry from the tender's stern arrested me.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker, they are sailing away without us!\"\n\nI turned in my seat. The Maria's mainsail was up, and the jib was being\nhoisted, and her head was rapidly falling off to the wind. Farrar was\ncasting. In the stern, waving a handkerchief, I recognized Mrs. Cooke,\nand beside her a figure in black, gesticulating frantically, a vision of\ncoat-tails flapping in the breeze. Then the yacht heeled on her course\nand forged lakewards.\n\n\"Row, Mr. Crocker, row! they are leaving us!\" cried Miss Trevor, in\nalarm.\n\nI hastened to reassure her.\n\n\"Farrar is probably trying something,\" I said. \"They will be turning\npresently.\"\n\nThis is just what they did not do. Once out of the inlet, they went\nabout and headed northward, up the coast, and we remained watching them\nuntil Mr. Trevor became a mere oscillating black speck against the sail.\n\n\"What can it mean?\" asked Miss Thorn.\n\nI had not so much as an idea.\n\n\"They certainly won't desert us, at any rate,\" I said. \"We had better go\nashore again and wait.\"\n\nThe Celebrity was seated on the beach, and he was whittling. Now\nwhittling is an occupation which speaks of a contented frame of mind,\nand the Maria's departure did not seem to have annoyed or disturbed him.\n\n\"Castaways,\" says he, gayly, \"castaways on a foreign shore. Two\ndelightful young ladies, a bright young lawyer, a fugitive from justice,\nno chaperon, and nothing to eat. And what a situation for a short story,\nif only an author were permitted to make use of his own experiences!\"\n\n\"Only you don't know how it will end,\" Miss Thorn put in.\n\nThe Celebrity glanced up at her.\n\n\"I have a guess,\" said he, with a smile.\n\n\"Is it true,\" Miss Trevor asked, \"that a story must contain the element\nof love in order to find favor with the public?\"\n\n\"That generally recommends it, especially to your sex, Miss Trevor,\" he\nreplied jocosely.\n\nMiss Trevor appeared interested.\n\n\"And tell me,\" she went on, \"isn't it sometimes the case that you\nstart out intent on one ending, and that your artistic sense of what is\nfitting demands another?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, Irene,\" said Miss Thorn. She was skipping flat pebbles\nover the water, and doing it capitally, too.\n\nI thought the Celebrity rather resented the question.\n\n\"That sometimes happens, of course,\" said he, carelessly. He produced\nhis inevitable gold cigarette case and held it out to me. \"Be sociable\nfor once, and have one,\" he said.\n\nI accepted.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he continued, lighting me a match, \"it beats me why you\nand Miss Trevor put this thing up on me. You have enjoyed it, naturally,\nand if you wanted to make me out a donkey you succeeded rather well. I\nused to think that Crocker was a pretty good friend of mine when I went\nto his dinners in New York. And I once had every reason to believe,\" he\nadded, \"that Miss Trevor and I were on excellent terms.\"\n\nWas this audacity or stupidity? Undoubtedly both.\n\n\"So we were,\" answered Miss Trevor, \"and I should be very sorry to\nthink, Mr. Allen,\" she said meaningly, \"that our relations had in any\nway changed.\"\n\nIt was the Celebrity's turn to flush.\n\n\"At any rate,\" he remarked in his most offhand manner, \"I am much\nobliged to you both. On sober reflection I have come to believe that you\ndid the very best thing for my reputation.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nHe had scarcely uttered these words before the reason for the Maria's\nabrupt departure became apparent. The anchorage of the yacht had been at\na spot whence nearly the whole south of the lake towards Far Harbor was\nopen, whilst a high tongue of land hid that part from us on the shore.\nAs he spoke, there shot before our eyes a steaming tug-boat, and a\nsecond look was not needed to assure me that she was the \"H. Sinclair,\nof Far Harbor.\" They had perceived her from the yacht an hour since, and\nit was clear that my client, prompt to act as to think, had decided at\nonce to put out and lead her a blind chase, so giving the Celebrity a\nchance to make good his escape.\n\nThe surprise and apprehension created amongst us by her sudden\nappearance was such that none of us, for a space, spoke or moved. She\nwas about a mile off shore, but it was even whether the chief would\ndecide that his quarry had been left behind in the inlet and turn in,\nor whether he would push ahead after the yacht. He gave us an abominable\nfive minutes of uncertainty. For when he came opposite the cove he\nslowed up, apparently weighing his chances. It was fortunate that we\nwere hidden from his glasses by a copse of pines. The Sinclair increased\nher speed and pushed northward after the Maria. I turned to the\nCelebrity.\n\n\"If you wish to escape, now is your chance,\" I said.\n\nFor contrariness he was more than I have ever had to deal with. Now he\ncrossed his knees and laughed.\n\n\"It strikes me you had better escape, Crocker,\" said he. \"You have more\nto run for.\"\n\nI looked across at Miss Thorn. She had told him, then, of my\npredicament. And she did not meet my eye. He began to whittle again, and\nremarked:\n\n\"It is only seventeen miles or so across these hills to Far Harbor, old\nchap, and you can get a train there for Asquith.\"\n\n\"Just as you choose,\" said I, shortly.\n\nWith that I started off to gain the top of the promontory in order to\nwatch the chase. I knew that this could not last as long as that of the\nday before. In less than three hours we might expect the Maria and the\ntug in the cove. And, to be frank, the indisposition of the Celebrity to\nrun troubled me. Had he come to the conclusion that it was just as\nwell to submit to what seemed the inevitable and so enjoy the spice of\nrevenge over me? My thoughts gave zest to my actions, and I was climbing\nthe steep, pine-clad slope with rapidity when I heard Miss Trevor below\nme calling out to wait for her. At the point of our ascent the ridge\nof the tongue must have been four hundred feet above the level of the\nwater, and from this place of vantage we could easily make out the Maria\nin the distance, and note from time to time the gain of the Sinclair.\n\n\"It wasn't fair of me, I know, to leave Marian,\" said Miss Trevor,\napologetically, \"but I simply couldn't resist the temptation to come up\nhere.\"\n\n\"I hardly think she will bear you much ill will,\" I answered dryly; \"you\ndid the kindest thing possible. Who knows but what they are considering\nthe advisability of an elopement!\"\n\nWe passed a most enjoyable morning up there, all things taken into\naccount, for the day was too perfect for worries. We even laughed at our\nhunger, which became keen about noon, as is always the case when one\nhas nothing to eat; so we set out to explore the ridge for blackberries.\nThese were so plentiful that I gathered a hatful for our friends below,\nand then I lingered for a last look at the boats. I could make out but\none. Was it the yacht? No; for there was a trace of smoke over it. And\nyet I was sure of a mast. I put my hand over my eyes.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Miss Trevor, anxiously.\n\n\"The tug has the Maria in tow,\" I said, \"and they are coming this way.\"\n\nWe scrambled down, sobered by this discovery and thinking of little\nelse. And breaking through the bushes we came upon Miss Thorn and the\nCelebrity. To me, preoccupied with the knowledge that the tug would soon\nbe upon us, there seemed nothing strange in the attitude of these two,\nbut Miss Trevor remarked something out of the common at once. How keenly\na woman scents a situation.\n\nThe Celebrity was standing with his back to Miss Thorn, at the edge of\nthe water. His chin was in the air, and to a casual observer he looked\nto be minutely interested in a flock of gulls passing over us. And Miss\nThorn? She was enthroned upon a heap of drift-wood, and when I caught\nsight of her face I forgot the very existence of the police captain. Her\nlips were parted in a smile.\n\n\"You are just in time, Irene,\" she said calmly; \"Mr. Allen has asked me\nto be his wife.\"\n\nI stood, with the hatful of berries in my hand, like a stiff wax figure\nin a museum. The expected had come at last; and how little do we expect\nthe expected when it comes! I was aware that both the young women were\nlooking at me, and that both were quietly laughing. And I must have cut\na ridiculous figure indeed, though I have since been informed on good\nauthority that this was not so. Much I cared then what happened. Then\ncame Miss Trevor's reply, and it seemed to shake the very foundations of\nmy wits.\n\n\"But, Marian,\" said she, \"you can't have him. He is engaged to me. And\nif it's quite the same to you, I want him myself. It isn't often, you\nknow, that one has the opportunity to marry a Celebrity.\"\n\nThe Celebrity turned around: an expression of extraordinary intelligence\nshot across his face, and I knew then that the hole in the well-nigh\ninvulnerable armor of his conceit had been found at last. And Miss\nThorn, of all people, had discovered it.\n\n\"Engaged to you?\" she cried, \"I can't believe it. He would be untrue to\neverything he has written.\"\n\n\"My word should be sufficient,\" said Miss Trevor, stiffly. (May I\nbe hung if they hadn't acted it all out before.) \"If you should wish\nproofs, however, I have several notes from him which are at your\nservice, and an inscribed photograph. No, Marian,\" she added, shaking\nher head, \"I really cannot give him up.\"\n\nMiss Thorn rose and confronted him, and her dignity was inspiring. \"Is\nthis so?\" she demanded; \"is it true that you are engaged to marry Miss\nTrevor?\"\n\nThe Bone of Contention was badly troubled. He had undoubtedly known what\nit was to have two women quarrelling over his hand at the same time, but\nI am willing to bet that the sensation of having them come together in\nhis presence was new to him.\n\n\"I did not think--\" he began. \"I was not aware that Miss Trevor looked\nupon the matter in that light, and you know--\"\n\n\"What disgusting equivocation,\" Miss Trevor interrupted. \"He asked\nme point blank to marry him, and of course I consented. He has never\nmentioned to me that he wished to break the engagement, and I wouldn't\nhave broken it.\"\n\nI felt like a newsboy in a gallery,--I wanted to cheer. And the\nCelebrity kicked the stones and things.\n\n\"Who would have thought,\" she persisted, \"that the author of The\nSybarites, the man who chose Desmond for a hero, could play thus idly\nwith the heart of woman? The man who wrote these beautiful lines:\n'Inconstancy in a woman, because of the present social conditions, is\nsometimes pardonable. In a man, nothing is more despicable.' And how\npoetic a justice it is that he has to marry me, and is thus forced to\nlead the life of self-denial he has conceived for his hero. Mr. Crocker,\nwill you be my attorney if he should offer any objections?\"\n\nThe humor of this proved too much for the three of us, and Miss Trevor\nherself went into peals of laughter. Would that the Celebrity could have\nseen his own face. I doubt if even he could have described it. But I\nwished for his sake that the earth might have kindly opened and taken\nhim in.\n\n\"Marian,\" said Miss Trevor, \"I am going to be very generous. I\nrelinquish the prize to you, and to you only. And I flatter myself there\nare not many girls in this world who would do it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Irene,\" Miss Thorn replied gravely, \"much as I want him, I\ncould not think of depriving you.\"\n\nWell, there is a limit to all endurance, and the Celebrity had reached\nhis.\n\n\"Crocker,\" he said, \"how far is it to the Canadian Pacific?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"I think I had best be starting,\" said he.\n\nAnd a moment later he had disappeared into the woods.\n\nWe stood gazing in the direction he had taken, until the sound of his\nprogress had died away. The shock of it all had considerably muddled\nmy brain, and when at last I had adjusted my thoughts to the new\nconditions, a sensation of relief, of happiness, of joy (call it what\nyou will), came upon me, and I could scarce restrain an impulse to toss\nmy hat in the air. He was gone at last! But that was not the reason. I\nwas safe from O'Meara and calumny. Nor was this all. And I did not dare\nto look at Miss Thorn. The knowledge that she had planned and carried\nout with dignity and success such a campaign filled me with awe. That I\nhad misjudged her made me despise myself. Then I became aware that she\nwas speaking to me, and I turned.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker, do you think there is any danger that he will lose his\nway?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Thorn,\" I replied; \"he has only to get to the top of that\nridge and strike the road for Saville, as I told him.\"\n\nWe were silent again until Miss Trevor remarked:\n\n\"Well, he deserved every bit of it.\"\n\n\"And more, Irene,\" said Miss Thorn, laughing; \"he deserved to marry\nyou.\"\n\n\"I think he won't come West again for a very long time,\" said I.\n\nMiss Trevor regarded me wickedly, and I knew what was coming.\n\n\"I hope you are convinced, now, Mr. Crocker, that our sex is not as\nblack as you painted it: that Miss Thorn knew what she was about, and\nthat she is not the inconsistent and variable creature you took her to\nbe.\"\n\nI felt the blood rush to my face, and Miss Thorn, too, became scarlet.\nShe went up to the mischievous Irene and grasping her arms from behind,\nbent them until she cried for mercy.\n\n\"How strong you are, Marian! It is an outrage to hurt me so. I haven't\nsaid anything.\" But she was incorrigible, and when she had twisted free\nshe began again:\n\n\"I took it upon myself to speak a few parables to Mr. Crocker the other\nday. You know, Marian, that he is one of these level-headed old fogies\nwho think women ought to be kept in a menagerie, behind bars, to be\ninspected on Saturday afternoons. Now, I appeal to you if it wouldn't be\ndisastrous to fall in love with a man of such ideas. And just to let\nyou know what a literal old law-brief he is, when I said he had had a\nhat-pin sticking in him for several weeks, he nearly jumped overboard,\nand began to feel himself all over. Did you know that he actually\nbelieved you were doing your best to get married to the Celebrity?\"\n(Here she dodged Miss Thorn again.) \"Oh, yes, he confided in me. He used\nto worry himself ill over that. I'll tell you what he said to me only--\"\n\nBut fortunately at this juncture Miss Trevor was captured again, and\nMiss Thorn put her hand over her mouth. Heaven only knows what she would\nhave said!\n\nThe two boats did not arrive until nearly four o'clock, owing to some\ntrouble to the tug's propeller. Not knowing what excuse my client might\nhave given for leaving some of his party ashore, I thought it best to\ngo out to meet them. Seated on the cabin roof of the Maria I beheld Mr.\nCooke and McCann in conversation, each with a black cigar too big for\nhim.\n\n\"Hello, Crocker, old man,\" shouted my client, \"did you think I was never\ncoming back? I've had lots of sport out of this hayseed captain\" (and\nhe poked that official playfully), \"but I didn't get any grub. So we'll\nhave to go to Far Harbor.\"\n\nI caught the hint. Mr. Cooke had given out that he had started for\nSaville to restock the larder.\n\n\"No,\" he continued, \"Brass Buttons didn't let me get to Saville. You\nsee, when he got back to town last night they told him he had been\nbuncoed out of the biggest thing for years, and they got it into his\nhead that I was child enough to run a ferry for criminals. They told him\nhe wasn't the sleuth he thought he was, so he came back. They'll have\nthe laugh on him now, for sure.\"\n\nMcCann listened with admirable good-nature, gravely pulling at his\ncigar, and eyeing Mr. Cooke with a friendly air of admiration.\n\n\"Mr. Crocker,\" he said, with melancholy humor, \"it's leery I am with the\nwhole shooting-match. Mr. Cooke here is a gentleman, every inch of him,\nand so be you, Mr. Crocker. But I'm just after taking a look at the\nhole in the bottom of the boat. 'Ye have yer bunks in queer places, Mr.\nCooke,' says I. It's not for me to be doubting a gentleman's word, sir,\nbut I'm thinking me man is over the hills and far away, and that's true\nfor ye.\"\n\nMr. Cooke winked expressively.\n\n\"McCann, you've been jerked,\" said he. \"Have another bottle!\"\n\nThe Sinclair towed us to Far Harbor for a consideration, the wind being\nstrong again from the south, and McCann was induced by the affable owner\nto remain on the yellow-plush yacht. I cornered him before we had gone a\ngreat distance.\n\n\"McCann,\" said I, \"what made you come back to-day?\"\n\n\"Faith, Mr. Crocker, I don't care if I am telling you. I always had a\nliking for you, sir, and bechune you and me it was that divil O'Meara\nwhat made all the trouble. I wasn't taking his money, not me; the saints\nforbid! But glory be to God, if he didn't raise a rumpus whin I\ncome back without Allen! It was sure he was that the gent left that\nplace,--what are ye calling it?--Mohair, in the Maria, and we telegraphs\nover to Asquith. He swore I'd lose me job if I didn't fetch him to-day.\nMr. Crocker, sir, it's the lumber business I'll be startin' next week,\"\nsaid McCann.\n\n\"Don't let that worry you, McCann,\" I answered. \"I will see that you\ndon't lose your place, and I give you my word again that Charles Wrexell\nAllen has never been aboard this yacht, or at Mohair to my knowledge.\nWhat is more, I will prove it to-morrow to your satisfaction.\"\n\nMcCann's faith was touching.\n\n\"Ye're not to say another word, sir,\" he said, and he stuck out his big\nhand, which I grasped warmly.\n\nMy affection for McCann still remains a strong one.\n\nAfter my talk with McCann I was sitting on the forecastle propped\nagainst the bitts of the Maria's anchor-chain, and looking at the\nswirling foam cast up by the tug's propeller. There were many things I\nwished to turn over in my mind just then, but I had not long been in a\nstate of reverie when I became conscious that Miss Thorn was standing\nbeside me. I got to my feet.\n\n\"I have been wondering how long you would remain in that trance, Mr.\nCrocker,\" she said. \"Is it too much to ask what you were thinking of?\"\n\nNow it so chanced that I was thinking of her at that moment. It would\nnever have done to say this, so I stammered. And Miss Thorn was a young\nwoman of tact.\n\n\"I should not have put that to so literal a man as you,\" she declared.\n\"I fear that you are incapable of crossing swords. And then,\" she added,\nwith a slight hesitation that puzzled me, \"I did not come up here to ask\nyou that,--I came to get your opinion.\"\n\n\"My opinion?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Not your legal opinion,\" she replied, smiling, \"but your opinion as\na citizen, as an individual, if you have one. To be frank, I want your\nopinion of me. Do you happen to have such a thing?\"\n\nI had. But I was in no condition to give it.\n\n\"Do you think me a very wicked girl?\" she asked, coloring. \"You once\nthought me inconsistent, I believe, but I am not that. Have I done wrong\nin leading the Celebrity to the point where you saw him this morning?\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" I cried fervently; \"but you might have spared me a\ngreat deal had you let me into the secret.\"\n\n\"Spared you a great deal,\" said Miss Thorn. \"I--I don't quite\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Well--\" I began, and there I stayed. All the words in the dictionary\nseemed to slip out of my grasp, and I foundered. I realized I had said\nsomething which even in my wildest moments I had not dared to think of.\nMy secret was out before I knew I possessed it. Bad enough had I told it\nto Farrar in an unguarded second. But to her! I was blindly seeking some\nway of escape when she said softly:\n\n\"Did you really care?\"\n\nI am man enough, I hope, when there is need to be. And it matters not\nwhat I felt then, but the words came back to me.\n\n\"Marian,\" I said, \"I cared more than you will ever learn.\"\n\nBut it seems that she had known all the time, almost since that night I\nhad met her at the train. And how? I shall not pretend to answer, that\nbeing quite beyond me. I am very sure of one thing, however, which is\nthat I never told a soul, man or woman, or even hinted at it. How was it\npossible when I didn't know myself?\n\nThe light in the west was gone as we were pulled into Far Harbor, and\nthe lamps of the little town twinkled brighter than I had ever seen them\nbefore. I think they must have been reflected in our faces, since Miss\nTrevor, when she came forward to look for us, saw something there and\nopenly congratulated us. And this most embarrassing young woman demanded\npresently:\n\n\"How did it happen, Marian? Did you propose to him?\"\n\nI was about to protest indignantly, but Marian laid her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Tell it not in Asquith,\" said she. \"Irene, I won't have him teased any\nmore.\"\n\nWe were drawing up to the dock, and for the first time I saw that a\ncrowd was gathered there. The report of this chase had gone abroad. Some\nbegan calling out to McCann when we came within distance, among others\nthe editor of the Northern Lights, and beside him I perceived with\namusement the generous lines: of the person of Mr. O'Meara himself. I\nhurried back to give Farrar a hand with the ropes, and it was O'Meara\nwho caught the one I flung ashore and wound it around a pile. The people\npressed around, peering at our party on the Maria, and I heard McCann\nexhorting them to make way. And just then, as he was about to cross\nthe plank, they parted for some one from behind. A breathless messenger\nhalted at the edge of the wharf. He held out a telegram.\n\nMcCann seized it and dived into the cabin, followed closely by my client\nand those of us who could push after. He tore open the envelope, his eye\nran over the lines, and then he began to slap his thigh and turn around\nin a circle, like a man dazed.\n\n\"Whiskey!\" shouted Mr. Cooke. \"Get him a glass of Scotch!\"\n\nBut McCann held up his hand.\n\n\"Holy Saint Patrick!\" he said, in a husky voice, \"it's upset I am,\nbottom upwards. Will ye listen to this?\"\n\n   \"'Drew is your man. Reddish hair and long side whiskers, gray\n   clothes. Pretends to represent summer hotel syndicate. Allen at\n   Asquith unknown and harmless.\n\n   \"' (Signed.)  Everhardt.\"'\n\n\"Sew me up,\" said Mr. Cooke; \"if that don't beat hell!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nIn this world of lies the good and the bad are so closely intermingled\nthat frequently one is the means of obtaining the other. Therefore,\nI wish very freely to express my obligations to the Celebrity for any\nshare he may have had in contributing to the greatest happiness of my\nlife.\n\nMarian and I were married the very next month, October, at my client's\npalatial residence of Mohair. This was at Mr. Cooke's earnest wish: and\nsince Marian was Mrs. Cooke's own niece, and an orphan, there seemed no\ngood reason why my client should not be humored in the matter. As for\nMarian and me, we did not much care whether we were married at Mohair\nor the City of Mexico. Mrs. Cooke, I think, had a secret preference for\nGermantown.\n\nMr. Cooke quite over-reached himself in that wedding. \"The knot was\ntied,\" as the papers expressed it, \"under a huge bell of yellow roses.\"\nThe paper also named the figure which the flowers and the collation and\nother things cost Mr. Cooke. A natural reticence forbids me to repeat\nit. But, lest my client should think that I undervalue his kindness, I\nwill say that we had the grandest wedding ever seen in that part of the\nworld. McCann was there, and Mr. Cooke saw to it that he had a punchbowl\nall to himself in which to drink our healths: Judge Short was there,\nstill followed by the conjugal eye: and Senator Trevor, who remained\nover, in a new long black coat to kiss the bride. Mr. Cooke chartered\ntwo cars to carry guests from the East, besides those who came as\nordinary citizens. Miss Trevor was of the party, and Farrar, of course,\nwas best man. Would that I had the flow of words possessed by the\nreporter of the Chicago Sunday newspaper!\n\nBut there is one thing I must mention before Mrs. Crocker and I leave\nfor New York, in a shower of rice, on Mr. Cooke's own private car, and\nthat is my client's gift. In addition to the check he gave Marian,\nhe presented us with a huge, 'repousse' silver urn he had had made to\norder, and he expressed a desire that the design upon it should remind\nus of him forever and ever. I think it will. Mercury is duly set forth\nin a gorgeous equipage, driving four horses around the world at a\nfurious pace; and the artist, by special instructions, had docked their\ntails.\n\nFrom New York, Mrs. Crocker and I went abroad. And it so chanced, in\nDecember, that we were staying a few days at a country-place in Sussex,\nand the subject of The Sybarites was broached at a dinner-party. The\nbook was then having its sale in England.\n\n\"Crocker,\" said our host, \"do you happen to have met the author of that\nbook? He's an American.\"\n\nI looked across the table at my wife, and we both laughed.\n\n\"I happen to know him intimately,\" I replied.\n\n\"Do you, now?\" said the Englishman; \"what a very entertaining chap he\nis, is he not? I had him down in October, and, by Jove, we were laughing\nthe blessed time. He was telling us how he wrote his novels, and he\nsaid, 'pon my soul he did, that he had a secretary or something of that\nsort to whom he told the plot, and the secretary elaborated, you know,\nand wrote the draft. And he said, 'pon my honor, that sometimes the\nclark wrote the plot and all,--the whole blessed thing,--and that he\nnever saw the book except to sign his name to it.\"\n\n\"You say he was here in October?\" asked Marian, when the laugh had\nsubsided.\n\n\"I have the date,\" answered our host, \"for he left me an autograph copy\nof The Sybarites when he went away.\" And after dinner he showed us the\nbook, with evident pride. Inscribed on the fly-leaf was the name of the\nauthor, October 10th. But a glance sufficed to convince both of us that\nthe Celebrity had never written it.\n\n\"John,\" said Marian to me, a suspicion of the truth crossing her mind,\n\"John, can it be the bicycle man?\"\n\n\"Yes, it can be,\" I said; \"it is.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Marian, \"he's been doing a little more for our friend than\nwe did.\"\n\nNor was this the last we heard of that meteoric trip through England,\nwhich the alleged author of The Sybarites had indulged in. He did not\ngo up to London; not he. It was given out that he was travelling for his\nhealth, that he did not wish to be lionized; and there were friends of\nthe author in the metropolis who had never heard of his secretary, and\nwho were at a loss to understand his conduct. They felt slighted. One of\nthese told me that the Celebrity had been to a Lincolnshire estate where\nhe had created a decided sensation by his riding to hounds, something\nthe Celebrity had never been known to do. And before we crossed the\nChannel, Marian saw another autograph copy of the famous novel.\n\nOne day, some months afterwards, we were sitting in our little salon in\na Paris hotel when a card was sent up, which Marian took.\n\n\"John,\" she cried, \"it's the Celebrity.\"\n\nIt was the Celebrity, in the flesh, faultlessly groomed and clothed,\nwith frock coat, gloves, and stick. He looked the picture of ruddy,\nmanly health and strength, and we saw at once that he bore no ill-will\nfor the past. He congratulated us warmly, and it was my turn to offer\nhim a cigarette. He was nothing loath to reminisce on the subject of his\nexperiences in the wilds of the northern lakes, or even to laugh over\nthem. He asked affectionately after his friend Cooke. Time had softened\nhis feelings, and we learned that he had another girl, who was in Paris\njust then, and invited us on the spot to dine with her at \"Joseph's.\"\nLet me say, in passing, that as usual she did credit to the Celebrity's\nexceptional taste.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I have something to tell you two.\"\n\nHe asked for another cigarette, and I laid the box beside him.\n\n\"I suppose you reached Saville all right,\" I said, anticipating.\n\n\"Seven at night,\" said he, \"and so hungry that I ate what they call\nmarble cake for supper, and a great many other things out of little side\ndishes, and nearly died of indigestion afterward. Then I took a train\nup to the main line. An express came along. 'Why not go West?' I asked\nmyself, and I jumped aboard. It was another whim--you know I am subject\nto them. When I got to Victoria I wired for money and sailed to Japan;\nand then I went on to India and through the Suez, taking things easy.\nI fell in with some people I knew who were going where the spirit moved\nthem, and I went along.\n\n\"Algiers, for one place, and whom do you think I saw there, in the lobby\nof a hotel?\"\n\n\"Charles Wrexell Allen,\" cried Marian and I together.\n\nThe Celebrity looked surprised. \"How did you know?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Go on with your story,\" said Marian; \"what did he do?\"\n\n\"What did he do?\" said the Celebrity; \"why, the blackguard stepped up\nand shook me by the hand, and asked after my health, and wanted to know\nwhether I were married yet. He was so beastly familiar that I took out\nmy glass, and I got him into a cafe for fear some one would see me with\nhim. 'My dear fellow,' said he, 'you did me the turn of my life.--How\ncan I ever repay you?' 'Hang your impudence,' said I, but I wanted to\nhear what he had to say. 'Don't lose your temper, old chap,' he laughed;\n'you took a few liberties with my name, and there was no good reason\nwhy I shouldn't take some with yours. Was there? When I think of it,\nthe thing was most decidedly convenient; it was the hand of Providence.'\n'You took liberties with my name,' I cried. With that he coolly called\nto the waiter to fill our glasses. 'Now,' said he, 'I've got a story for\nyou. Do you remember the cotillon, or whatever it was, that Cooke gave?\nWell, that was all in the Chicago papers, and the \"Miles Standish\" agent\nthere saw it, and he knew pretty well that I wasn't West. So he sent me\nthe papers, just for fun. You may imagine my surprise when I read that I\nhad been leading a dance out at Mohair, or some such barbarous place in\nthe northwest. I looked it up on the map (Asquith, I mean), and then I\nbegan to think. I wondered who in the devil it might be who had taken\nmy name and occupation, and all that. You see, I had just relieved the\ncompany of a little money, and it hit me like a clap of thunder one day\nthat the idiot was you. But I couldn't be sure. And as long as I had to\nget out very soon anyway, I concluded to go to Mohair and make certain,\nand then pile things off on you if you happened to be the man.'\"\n\nAt this point Marian and I were seized with laughter, in which the\nCelebrity himself joined. Presently he continued:\n\n\"'So I went,' said Allen. 'I provided myself with two disguises, as\na careful man should, but by the time I reached that outlandish hole,\nAsquith, the little thing I was mixed up in burst prematurely, and\nthe papers were full of it that morning. The whole place was out\nwith sticks, so to speak, hunting for you. They told me the published\ndescription hit you to a dot, all except the scar, and they quarrelled\nabout that. I posed as the promoter of resort syndicates, and I hired\nthe Scimitar and sailed over to Bear Island; and I didn't have a bad\ntime that afternoon, only Cooke insisted on making remarks about my\nwhiskers, and I was in mortal fear lest he might accidentally pull one\noff. He came cursed near it. By the way, he's the very deuce of a man,\nisn't he? I knew he took me for a detective, so I played the part. And\nin the night that ass of a state senator nearly gave me pneumonia by\ngetting me out in the air to tell me they had hid you in a cave. So I\nsat up all night, and followed the relief party in the morning, and you\nnearly disfigured me for life when you threw that bottle into the woods.\nThen I went back to camp, and left so fast that I forgot my extra pair\nof red whiskers. I had two of each disguise, you know, so I didn't miss\nthem.\n\n\"'I guess,' Mr. Allen went on, gleefully, 'that I got off about as\ncleanly as any criminal ever did, thanks to you. If we'd fixed the thing\nup between us it couldn't have been any neater, could it? Because I went\nstraight to Far Harbor and got you into a peck of trouble, right\naway, and then slipped quietly into Canada, and put on the outfit of a\ntravelling salesman. And right here another bright idea struck me. Why\nnot carry the thing farther? I knew that you had advertised a trip to\nEurope (why, the Lord only knows), so I went East and sailed for England\non the Canadian Line. And let me thank you for a little sport I had in\na quiet way as the author of The Sybarites. I think I astonished some of\nyour friends, old boy.'\"\n\nThe Celebrity lighted another cigarette.\n\n\"So if it hadn't been for me,\" he said, \"the 'Miles Standish Bicycle\nCompany' wouldn't have gone to the wall. Can they sentence me for\nassisting Allen to get away, Crocker? If they can, I believe I shall\nstay over here.\"\n\n\"I think you are safe,\" said I. \"But didn't Allen tell you any more?\"\n\n\"No. A man he used to know came into the cafe, and Allen got out of the\nback door. And I never saw him again.\"\n\n\"I believe I can tell you a little more,\" said Marian.\n\n       ......................\n\nThe Celebrity is still writing books of a high moral tone and\nunapproachable principle, and his popularity is undiminished. I have not\nheard, however, that he has given way to any more whims.\n\n\n\n\n\n     PG EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A man's character often give the lie to his tongue\n     A lie has short legs\n     Appearance of a professional pallbearer\n     Architects should be driven and not followed\n     Consequential or inconsequential irrespective of their size\n     Deal with a fool according to his folly\n     Impervious to hints, and would not take no for an answer\n     Old enough to know better, and too old to be taught\n     That abominable word \"like\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Celebrity, Complete, by Winston Churchill\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CELEBRITY, COMPLETE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5387.txt or 5387.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/5\/3\/8\/5387\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":906,"split":"train"}
