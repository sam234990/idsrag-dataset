This set-up supplies the opportunity for a criminal gang master-minded by Madame Dauvray's maid, with their eyes on the widow's jewellery collection, to engineer an introduction for one of their number, Adele Tac\u0102\u0160 (\"Rossignol\") whose taunts of disbelief goad the old lady into allowing a seance to be held which, unsuspected by either Celia or her patron, will be the cover for murder and robbery. The crux of the plot is that Celia, as medium, will be made their innocent victim, on whom suspicion is to be planted. By her professed scepticism, Adele manoeuvres the girl into consenting to be bound hand and foot and secured to a pillar during the performance, such that she is incapable of escaping or preventing Madame Dauvray's being strangled by an intruder in the course of the seance; and is thereafter abducted to Geneva, still trussed, gagged and helpless, with various clues being left behind to incriminate her as accomplice in the murder. Inspector Hanaud of the Paris S\u0102\u0165ret\u0102\u0160 (in several of his novels, Mason's equivalent of Christie's Poirot) unravels the conspiracy and rescues Celia when on the brink of being drugged and dumped into Lake Geneva.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of At the Villa Rose, by A.

He pretended to take the waters in the morning, he\nwent for a ride in his motor-car in the afternoon, he dined at the\nCercle in the evening, and spent an hour or two afterwards in the\nbaccarat-rooms at the Villa des Fleurs. An enviable, smooth life\nwithout a doubt, and it is certain that his acquaintances envied him.\nAt the same time, however, they laughed at him and, alas with some\njustice; for he was an exaggerated person. He was to be construed in\nthe comparative. Everything in his life was a trifle overdone, from the\nfastidious arrangement of his neckties to the feminine nicety of his\nlittle dinner-parties. In age Mr. Ricardo was approaching the fifties;\nin condition he was a widower--a state greatly to his liking, for he\navoided at once the irksomeness of marriage and the reproaches justly\nlevelled at the bachelor; finally, he was rich, having amassed a\nfortune in Mincing Lane, which he had invested in profitable securities.\n\nTen years of ease, however, had not altogether obliterated in him the\nbusiness look. Though he lounged from January to December, he lounged\nwith the air of a financier taking a holiday; and when he visited, as\nhe frequently did, the studio of a painter, a stranger would have\nhesitated to decide whether he had been drawn thither by a love of art\nor by the possibility of an investment. His \"acquaintances\" have been\nmentioned, and the word is suitable. For while he mingled in many\ncircles, he stood aloof from all. He affected the company of artists,\nby whom he was regarded as one ambitious to become a connoisseur; and\namongst the younger business men, who had never dealt with him, he\nearned the disrespect reserved for the dilettante. If he had a grief,\nit was that he had discovered no great man who in return for practical\nfavours would engrave his memory in brass. He was a Maecenas without a\nHorace, an Earl of Southampton without a Shakespeare. In a word,\nAix-les-Bains in the season was the very place for him; and never for a\nmoment did it occur to him that he was here to be dipped in agitations,\nand hurried from excitement to excitement. The beauty of the little\ntown, the crowd of well-dressed and agreeable people, the rose-coloured\nlife of the place, all made their appeal to him. But it was the Villa\ndes Fleurs which brought him to Aix. Not that he played for anything\nmore than an occasional louis; nor, on the other hand, was he merely a\ncold looker-on. He had a bank-note or two in his pocket on most\nevenings at the service of the victims of the tables. But the pleasure\nto his curious and dilettante mind lay in the spectacle of the battle\nwhich was waged night after night between raw nature and good manners.\nIt was extraordinary to him how constantly manners prevailed. There\nwere, however, exceptions.\n\nFor instance. On the first evening of this particular visit he found\nthe rooms hot, and sauntered out into the little semicircular garden at\nthe back. He sat there for half an hour under a flawless sky of stars\nwatching the people come and go in the light of the electric lamps, and\nappreciating the gowns and jewels of the women with the eye of a\nconnoisseur; and then into this starlit quiet there came suddenly a\nflash of vivid life. A girl in a soft, clinging frock of white satin\ndarted swiftly from the rooms and flung herself nervously upon a bench.\nShe could not, to Ricardo's thinking, be more than twenty years of age.\nShe was certainly quite young. The supple slenderness of her figure\nproved it, and he had moreover caught a glimpse, as she rushed out, of\na fresh and very pretty face; but he had lost sight of it now. For the\ngirl wore a big black satin hat with a broad brim, from which a couple\nof white ostrich feathers curved over at the back, and in the shadow of\nthat hat her face was masked. All that he could see was a pair of long\ndiamond eardrops, which sparkled and trembled as she moved her\nhead--and that she did constantly. Now she stared moodily at the\nground; now she flung herself back; then she twisted nervously to the\nright, and then a moment afterwards to the left; and then again she\nstared in front of her, swinging a satin slipper backwards and forwards\nagainst the pavement with the petulance of a child. All her movements\nwere spasmodic; she was on the verge of hysteria. Ricardo was expecting\nher to burst into tears, when she sprang up and as swiftly as she had\ncome she hurried back into the rooms. \"Summer lightning,\" thought Mr.\nRicardo.\n\nNear to him a woman sneered, and a man said, pityingly: \"She was\npretty, that little one. It is regrettable that she has lost.\"\n\nA few minutes afterwards Ricardo finished his cigar and strolled back\ninto the rooms, making his way to the big table just on the right hand\nof the entrance, where the play as a rule runs high. It was clearly\nrunning high to-night. For so deep a crowd thronged about the table that\nRicardo could only by standing on tiptoe see the faces of the players.\nOf the banker he could not catch a glimpse. But though the crowd\nremained, its units were constantly changing, and it was not long\nbefore Ricardo found himself standing in the front rank of the\nspectators, just behind the players seated in the chairs. The oval\ngreen table was spread out beneath him littered with bank-notes.\nRicardo turned his eyes to the left, and saw seated at the middle of\nthe table the man who was holding the bank. Ricardo recognised him with\na start of surprise. He was a young Englishman, Harry Wethermill, who,\nafter a brilliant career at Oxford and at Munich, had so turned his\nscientific genius to account that he had made a fortune for himself at\nthe age of twenty-eight.\n\nHe sat at the table with the indifferent look of the habitual player\nupon his cleanly chiselled face. But it was plain that his good fortune\nstayed at his elbow to-night, for opposite to him the croupier was\narranging with extraordinary deftness piles of bank-notes in the order\nof their value. The bank was winning heavily. Even as Ricardo looked\nWethermill turned up \"a natural,\" and the croupier swept in the stakes\nfrom either side.\n\n\"Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Le jeu est fait?\" the croupier cried, all\nin a breath, and repeated the words. Wethermill waited with his hand\nupon the wooden frame in which the cards were stacked. He glanced round\nthe table while the stakes were being laid upon the cloth, and suddenly\nhis face flashed from languor into interest. Almost opposite to him a\nsmall, white-gloved hand holding a five-louis note was thrust forward\nbetween the shoulders of two men seated at the table. Wethermill leaned\nforward and shook his head with a smile. With a gesture he refused the\nstake. But he was too late. The fingers of the hand had opened, the\nnote fluttered down on to the cloth, the money was staked.\n\nAt once he leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"Il y a une suite,\" he said quietly. He relinquished the bank rather\nthan play against that five-louis note. The stakes were taken up by\ntheir owners.\n\nThe croupier began to count Wethermill's winnings, and Ricardo, curious\nto know whose small, delicately gloved hand it was which had brought\nthe game to so abrupt a termination, leaned forward. He recognised the\nyoung girl in the white satin dress and the big black hat whose nerves\nhad got the better of her a few minutes since in the garden. He saw her\nnow clearly, and thought her of an entrancing loveliness. She was\nmoderately tall, fair of skin, with a fresh colouring upon her cheeks\nwhich she owed to nothing but her youth. Her hair was of a light brown\nwith a sheen upon it, her forehead broad, her eyes dark and wonderfully\nclear. But there was something more than her beauty to attract him. He\nhad a strong belief that somewhere, some while ago, he had already seen\nher. And this belief grew and haunted him. He was still vaguely\npuzzling his brains to fix the place when the croupier finished his\nreckoning.\n\n\"There are two thousand louis in the bank,\" he cried. \"Who will take on\nthe bank for two thousand louis?\"\n\nNo one, however, was willing. A fresh bank was put up for sale, and\nWethermill, still sitting in the dealer's chair, bought it. He spoke at\nonce to an attendant, and the man slipped round the table, and, forcing\nhis way through the crowd, carried a message to the girl in the black\nhat. She looked towards Wethermill and smiled; and the smile made her\nface a miracle of tenderness. Then she disappeared, and in a few\nmoments Ricardo saw a way open in the throng behind the banker, and she\nappeared again only a yard or two away, just behind Wethermill. He\nturned, and taking her hand into his, shook it chidingly.\n\n\"I couldn't let you play against me, Celia,\" he said, in English; \"my\nluck's too good to-night. So you shall be my partner instead. I'll put\nin the capital and we'll share the winnings.\"\n\nThe girl's face flushed rosily. Her hand still lay clasped in his. She\nmade no effort to withdraw it.\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Why not?\" said he. \"See!\" and loosening her fingers he took from them\nthe five-louis note and tossed it over to the croupier to be added to\nhis bank. \"Now you can't help yourself. We're partners.\"\n\nThe girl laughed, and the company at the table smiled, half in\nsympathy, half with amusement. A chair was brought for her, and she sat\ndown behind Wethermill, her lips parted, her face joyous with\nexcitement. But all at once Wethermill's luck deserted him. He renewed\nhis bank three times, and had lost the greater part of his winnings\nwhen he had dealt the cards through. He took a fourth bank, and rose\nfrom that, too, a loser.\n\n\"That's enough, Celia,\" he said. \"Let us go out into the garden; it\nwill be cooler there.\"\n\n\"I have taken your good luck away,\" said the girl remorsefully.\nWethermill put his arm through hers.\n\n\"You'll have to take yourself away before you can do that,\" he\nanswered, and the couple walked together out of Ricardo's hearing.\n\nRicardo was left to wonder about Celia. She was just one of those\nproblems which made Aix-les-Bains so unfailingly attractive to him. She\ndwelt in some street of Bohemia; so much was clear. The frankness of\nher pleasure, of her excitement, and even of her distress proved it.\nShe passed from one to the other while you could deal a pack of cards.\nShe was at no pains to wear a mask. Moreover, she was a young girl of\nnineteen or twenty, running about those rooms alone, as unembarrassed\nas if she had been at home. There was the free use, too, of Christian\nnames. Certainly she dwelt in Bohemia. But it seemed to Ricardo that\nshe could pass in any company and yet not be overpassed. She would look\na little more picturesque than most girls of her age, and she was\ncertainly a good deal more soignee than many, and she had the\nFrenchwoman's knack of putting on her clothes. But those would be all\nthe differences, leaving out the frankness. Ricardo wondered in what\nstreet of Bohemia she dwelt. He wondered still more when he saw her\nagain half an hour afterwards at the entrance to the Villa des Fleurs.\nShe came down the long hall with Harry Wethermill at her side. The\ncouple were walking slowly, and talking as they walked with so complete\nan absorption in each other that they were unaware of their\nsurroundings. At the bottom of the steps a stout woman of fifty-five\nover-jewelled, and over-dressed and raddled with paint, watched their\napproach with a smile of good-humoured amusement. When they came near\nenough to hear she said in French:\n\n\"Well, Celie, are you ready to go home?\"\n\nThe girl looked up with a start.\n\n\"Of course, madame,\" she said, with a certain submissiveness which\nsurprised Ricardo. \"I hope I have not kept you waiting.\"\n\nShe ran to the cloak-room, and came back again with her cloak.\n\n\"Good-bye, Harry,\" she said, dwelling upon his name and looking out\nupon him with soft and smiling eyes.\n\n\"I shall see you to-morrow evening,\" he said, holding her hand. Again\nshe let it stay within his keeping, but she frowned, and a sudden\ngravity settled like a cloud upon her face. She turned to the elder\nwoman with a sort of appeal.\n\n\"No, I do not think we shall be here, to-morrow, shall we, madame?\" she\nsaid reluctantly.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said madame briskly. \"You have not forgotten what we\nhave planned? No, we shall not be here to-morrow; but the night\nafter--yes.\"\n\nCelia turned back again to Wethermill.\n\n\"Yes, we have plans for to-morrow,\" she said, with a very wistful note\nof regret in her voice; and seeing that madame was already at the door,\nshe bent forward and said timidly, \"But the night after I shall want\nyou.\"\n\n\"I shall thank you for wanting me,\" Wethermill rejoined; and the girl\ntore her hand away and ran up the steps.\n\nHarry Wethermill returned to the rooms. Mr. Ricardo did not follow him.\nHe was too busy with the little problem which had been presented to him\nthat night. What could that girl, he asked himself, have in common with\nthe raddled woman she addressed so respectfully? Indeed, there had been\na note of more than respect in her voice. There had been something of\naffection. Again Mr. Ricardo found himself wondering in what street in\nBohemia Celia dwelt--and as he walked up to the hotel there came yet\nother questions to amuse him.\n\n\"Why,\" he asked, \"could neither Celia nor madame come to the Villa des\nFleurs to-morrow night? What are the plans they have made? And what was\nit in those plans which had brought the sudden gravity and reluctance\ninto Celia's face?\"\n\nRicardo had reason to remember those questions during the next few\ndays, though he only idled with them now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA CRY FOR HELP\n\n\nIt was on a Monday evening that Ricardo saw Harry Wethermill and the\ngirl Celia together. On the Tuesday he saw Wethermill in the rooms\nalone and had some talk with him.\n\nWethermill was not playing that night, and about ten o'clock the two\nmen left the Villa des Fleurs together.\n\n\"Which way do you go?\" asked Wethermill.\n\n\"Up the hill to the Hotel Majestic,\" said Ricardo.\n\n\"We go together, then. I, too, am staying there,\" said the young man,\nand they climbed the steep streets together. Ricardo was dying to put\nsome questions about Wethermill's young friend of the night before, but\ndiscretion kept him reluctantly silent. They chatted for a few moments\nin the hall upon indifferent topics and so separated for the night. Mr.\nRicardo, however, was to learn something more of Celia the next\nmorning; for while he was fixing his tie before the mirror Wethermill\nburst into his dressing-room. Mr. Ricardo forgot his curiosity in the\nsurge of his indignation. Such an invasion was an unprecedented outrage\nupon the gentle tenor of his life. The business of the morning toilette\nwas sacred. To interrupt it carried a subtle suggestion of anarchy.\nWhere was his valet? Where was Charles, who should have guarded the\ndoor like the custodian of a chapel?\n\n\"I cannot speak to you for at least another half-hour,\" said Mr.\nRicardo, sternly.\n\nBut Harry Wethermill was out of breath and shaking with agitation.\n\n\"I can't wait,\" he cried, with a passionate appeal. \"I have got to see\nyou. You must help me, Mr. Ricardo--you must, indeed!\"\n\nRicardo spun round upon his heel. At first he had thought that the help\nwanted was the help usually wanted at Aix-les-Bains. A glance at\nWethermills face, however, and the ringing note of anguish in his\nvoice, told him that the thought was wrong. Mr. Ricardo slipped out of\nhis affectations as out of a loose coat. \"What has happened?\" he asked\nquietly.\n\n\"Something terrible.\" With shaking fingers Wethermill held out a\nnewspaper. \"Read it,\" he said.\n\nIt was a special edition of a local newspaper, Le Journal de Savoie,\nand it bore the date of that morning.\n\n\"They are crying it in the streets,\" said Wethermill. \"Read!\"\n\nA short paragraph was printed in large black letters on the first page,\nand leaped to the eyes.\n\n\"Late last night,\" it ran, \"an appalling murder was committed at the\nVilla Rose, on the road to Lac Bourget. Mme. Camille Dauvray, an\nelderly, rich woman who was well known at Aix, and had occupied the\nvilla every summer for the last few years, was discovered on the floor\nof her salon, fully dressed and brutally strangled, while upstairs, her\nmaid, Helene Vauquier, was found in bed, chloroformed, with her hands\ntied securely behind her back. At the time of going to press she had\nnot recovered consciousness, but the doctor, Emile Peytin, is in\nattendance upon her, and it is hoped that she will be able shortly to\nthrow some light on this dastardly affair. The police are properly\nreticent as to the details of the crime, but the following statement\nmay be accepted without hesitation:\n\n\"The murder was discovered at twelve o'clock at night by the\nsergent-de-ville Perrichet, to whose intelligence more than a word of\npraise is due, and it is obvious from the absence of all marks upon the\ndoor and windows that the murderer was admitted from within the villa.\nMeanwhile Mme. Dauvray's motor-car has disappeared, and with it a young\nEnglishwoman who came to Aix with her as her companion. The motive of\nthe crime leaps to the eyes. Mme. Dauvray was famous in Aix for her\njewels, which she wore with too little prudence. The condition of the\nhouse shows that a careful search was made for them, and they have\ndisappeared. It is anticipated that a description of the young\nEnglishwoman, with a reward for her apprehension, will be issued\nimmediately. And it is not too much to hope that the citizens of Aix,\nand indeed of France, will be cleared of all participation in so cruel\nand sinister a crime.\"\n\nRicardo read through the paragraph with a growing consternation, and\nlaid the paper upon his dressing-table.\n\n\"It is infamous,\" cried Wethermill passionately.\n\n\"The young Englishwoman is, I suppose, your friend Miss Celia?\" said\nRicardo slowly.\n\nWethermill started forward.\n\n\"You know her, then?\" he cried in amazement.\n\n\"No; but I saw her with you in the rooms. I heard you call her by that\nname.\"\n\n\"You saw us together?\" exclaimed Wethermill. \"Then you can understand\nhow infamous the suggestion is.\"\n\nBut Ricardo had seen the girl half an hour before he had seen her with\nHarry Wethermill. He could not but vividly remember the picture of her\nas she flung herself on to the bench in the garden in a moment of\nhysteria, and petulantly kicked a satin slipper backwards and forwards\nagainst the stones. She was young, she was pretty, she had a charm of\nfreshness, but--but--strive against it as he would, this picture in the\nrecollection began more and more to wear a sinister aspect. He\nremembered some words spoken by a stranger. \"She is pretty, that little\none. It is regrettable that she has lost.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo arranged his tie with even a greater deliberation than he\nusually employed.\n\n\"And Mme. Dauvray?\" he asked. \"She was the stout woman with whom your\nyoung friend went away?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wethermill.\n\nRicardo turned round from the mirror.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Hanaud is at Aix. He is the cleverest of the French detectives. You\nknow him. He dined with you once.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Ricardo's practice to collect celebrities round his\ndinner-table, and at one such gathering Hanaud and Wethermill had been\npresent together.\n\n\"You wish me to approach him?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\n\"It is a delicate position,\" said Ricardo. \"Here is a man in charge of\na case of murder, and we are quietly to go to him--\"\n\nTo his relief Wethermill interrupted him.\n\n\"No, no,\" he cried; \"he is not in charge of the case. He is on his\nholiday. I read of his arrival two days ago in the newspaper. It was\nstated that he came for rest. What I want is that he should take charge\nof the case.\"\n\nThe superb confidence of Wethermill shook Mr. Ricardo for a moment, but\nhis recollections were too clear.\n\n\"You are going out of your way to launch the acutest of French\ndetectives in search of this girl. Are you wise, Wethermill?\"\n\nWethermill sprang up from his chair in desperation.\n\n\"You, too, think her guilty! You have seen her. You think her\nguilty--like this detestable newspaper, like the police.\"\n\n\"Like the police?\" asked Ricardo sharply.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry Wethermill sullenly. \"As soon as I saw that rag I ran\ndown to the villa. The police are in possession. They would not let me\ninto the garden. But I talked with one of them. They, too, think that\nshe let in the murderers.\"\n\nRicardo took a turn across the room. Then he came to a stop in front of\nWethermill.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said solemnly. \"I saw this girl half an hour before\nI saw you. She rushed out into the garden. She flung herself on to a\nbench. She could not sit still. She was hysterical. You know what that\nmeans. She had been losing. That's point number one.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo ticked it off upon his finger.\n\n\"She ran back into the rooms. You asked her to share the winnings of\nyour bank. She consented eagerly. And you lost. That's point number\ntwo. A little later, as she was going away, you asked her whether she\nwould be in the rooms the next night--yesterday night--the night when\nthe murder was committed. Her face clouded over. She hesitated. She\nbecame more than grave. There was a distinct impression as though she\nshrank from the contemplation of what it was proposed she should do on\nthe next night. And then she answered you, 'No, we have other plans.'\nThat's number three.\" And Mr. Ricardo ticked off his third point.\n\n\"Now,\" he asked, \"do you still ask me to launch Hanaud upon the case?\"\n\n\"Yes, and at once,\" cried Wethermill.\n\nRicardo called for his hat and his stick.\n\n\"You know where Hanaud is staying?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wethermill, and he led Ricardo to an unpretentious\nlittle hotel in the centre of the town. Ricardo sent in his name, and\nthe two visitors were immediately shown into a small sitting-room,\nwhere M. Hanaud was enjoying his morning chocolate. He was stout and\nbroad-shouldered, with a full and almost heavy face. In his morning\nsuit at his breakfast-table he looked like a prosperous comedian.\n\nHe came forward with a smile of welcome, extending both his hands to\nMr. Ricardo.\n\n\"Ah, my good friend,\" he said, \"it is pleasant to see you. And Mr.\nWethermill,\" he exclaimed, holding a hand out to the young inventor.\n\n\"You remember me, then?\" said Wethermill gladly.\n\n\"It is my profession to remember people,\" said Hanaud, with a laugh.\n\"You were at that amusing dinner-party of Mr. Ricardo's in Grosvenor\nSquare.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Wethermill, \"I have come to ask your help.\"\n\nThe note of appeal in his voice was loud. M. Hanaud drew up a chair by\nthe window and motioned to Wethermill to take it. He pointed to\nanother, with a bow of invitation to Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"Let me hear,\" he said gravely.\n\n\"It is the murder of Mme. Dauvray,\" said Wethermill.\n\nHanaud started.\n\n\"And in what way, monsieur,\" he asked, \"are you interested in the\nmurder of Mme. Dauvray?\"\n\n\"Her companion,\" said Wethermill, \"the young English girl--she is a\ngreat friend of mine.\"\n\nHanaud's face grew stern. Then came a sparkle of anger in his eyes.\n\n\"And what do you wish me to do, monsieur?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"You are upon your holiday, M. Hanaud. I wish you--no, I implore you,\"\nWethermill cried, his voice ringing with passion, \"to take up this\ncase, to discover the truth, to find out what has become of Celia.\"\n\nHanaud leaned back in his chair with his hands upon the arms. He did\nnot take his eyes from Harry Wethermill, but the anger died out of them.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"I do not know what your procedure is in England.\nBut in France a detective does not take up a case or leave it alone\naccording to his pleasure. We are only servants. This affair is in the\nhands of M. Fleuriot, the Juge d'instruction of Aix.\"\n\n\"But if you offered him your help it would be welcomed,\" cried\nWethermill. \"And to me that would mean so much. There would be no\nbungling. There would be no waste of time. Of that one would be sure.\"\n\nHanaud shook his head gently. His eyes were softened now by a look of\npity. Suddenly he stretched out a forefinger.\n\n\"You have, perhaps, a photograph of the young lady in that card-case in\nyour breast-pocket.\"\n\nWethermill flushed red, and, drawing out the card-case, handed the\nportrait to Hanaud. Hanaud looked at it carefully for a few moments.\n\n\"It was taken lately, here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes; for me,\" replied Wethermill quietly.\n\n\"And it is a good likeness?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"How long have you known this Mlle. Celie?\" he asked.\n\nWethermill looked at Hanaud with a certain defiance.\n\n\"For a fortnight.\"\n\nHanaud raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"You met her here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In the rooms, I suppose? Not at the house of one of your friends?\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Wethermill quietly. \"A friend of mine who had met\nher in Paris introduced me to her at my request.\"\n\nHanaud handed back the portrait and drew forward his chair nearer to\nWethermill. His face had grown friendly. He spoke with a tone of\nrespect.\n\n\"Monsieur, I know something of you. Our friend, Mr. Ricardo, told me\nyour history; I asked him for it when I saw you at his dinner. You are\nof those about whom one does ask questions, and I know that you are not\na romantic boy, but who shall say that he is safe from the appeal of\nbeauty? I have seen women, monsieur, for whose purity of soul I would\nmyself have stood security, condemned for complicity in brutal crimes\non evidence that could not be gainsaid; and I have known them turn\nfoul-mouthed, and hideous to look upon, the moment after their just\nsentence has been pronounced.\"\n\n\"No doubt, monsieur,\" said Wethermill, with perfect quietude. \"But\nCelia Harland is not one of those women.\"\n\n\"I do not now say that she is,\" said Hanaud. \"But the Juge\nd'instruction here has already sent to me to ask for my assistance, and\nI refused. I replied that I was just a good bourgeois enjoying his\nholiday. Still it is difficult quite to forget one's profession. It was\nthe Commissaire of Police who came to me, and naturally I talked with\nhim for a little while. The case is dark, monsieur, I warn you.\"\n\n\"How dark?\" asked Harry Wethermill.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" said Hanaud, drawing his chair still closer to the\nyoung man. \"Understand this in the first place. There was an accomplice\nwithin the villa. Some one let the murderers in. There is no sign of an\nentrance being forced; no lock was picked, there is no mark of a thumb\non any panel, no sign of a bolt being forced. There was an accomplice\nwithin the house. We start from that.\"\n\nWethermill nodded his head sullenly. Ricardo drew his chair up towards\nthe others. But Hanaud was not at that moment interested in Ricardo.\n\n\"Well, then, let us see who there are in Mme. Dauvray's household. The\nlist is not a long one. It was Mme. Dauvray's habit to take her\nluncheon and her dinner at the restaurants, and her maid was all that\nshe required to get ready her 'petit dejeuner' in the morning and her\n'sirop' at night. Let us take the members of the household one by one.\nThere is first the chauffeur, Henri Servettaz. He was not at the villa\nlast night. He came back to it early this morning.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Ricardo, in a significant exclamation. Wethermill did not\nstir. He sat still as a stone, with a face deadly white and eyes\nburning upon Hanaud's face.\n\n\"But wait,\" said Hanaud, holding up a warning hand to Ricardo.\n\"Servettaz was in Chambery, where his parents live. He travelled to\nChambery by the two o'clock train yesterday. He was with them in the\nafternoon. He went with them to a cafe in the evening. Moreover, early\nthis morning the maid, Helene Vauquier, was able to speak a few words\nin answer to a question. She said Servettaz was in Chambery. She gave\nhis address. A telephone message was sent to the police in that town,\nand Servettaz was found in bed. I do not say that it is impossible that\nServettaz was concerned in the crime. That we shall see. But it is\nquite clear, I think, that it was not he who opened the house to the\nmurderers, for he was at Chambery in the evening, and the murder was\nalready discovered here by midnight. Moreover--it is a small point--he\nlives, not in the house, but over the garage in a corner of the garden.\nThen besides the chauffeur there was a charwoman, a woman of Aix, who\ncame each morning at seven and left in the evening at seven or eight.\nSometimes she would stay later if the maid was alone in the house, for\nthe maid is nervous. But she left last night before nine--there is\nevidence of that--and the murder did not take place until afterwards.\nThat is also a fact, not a conjecture. We can leave the charwoman, who\nfor the rest has the best of characters, out of our calculations. There\nremain then, the maid, Helene Vauquier, and\"--he shrugged his\nshoulders--\"Mlle. Celie.\"\n\nHanaud reached out for the matches and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"Let us take first the maid, Helene Vauquier. Forty years old, a\nNormandy peasant woman--they are not bad people, the Normandy peasants,\nmonsieur--avaricious, no doubt, but on the whole honest and most\nrespectable. We know something of Helene Vauquier, monsieur. See!\" and\nhe took up a sheet of paper from the table. The paper was folded\nlengthwise, written upon only on the inside. \"I have some details here.\nOur police system is, I think, a little more complete than yours in\nEngland. Helene Vauquier has served Mme. Dauvray for seven years. She\nhas been the confidential friend rather than the maid. And mark this,\nM. Wethermill! During those seven years how many opportunities has she\nhad of conniving at last night's crime? She was found chloroformed and\nbound. There is no doubt that she was chloroformed. Upon that point Dr.\nPeytin is quite, quite certain. He saw her before she recovered\nconsciousness. She was violently sick on awakening. She sank again into\nunconsciousness. She is only now in a natural sleep. Besides those\npeople, there is Mlle. Celie. Of her, monsieur, nothing is known. You\nyourself know nothing of her. She comes suddenly to Aix as the\ncompanion of Mme. Dauvray--a young and pretty English girl. How did she\nbecome the companion of Mme. Dauvray?\"\n\nWethermill stirred uneasily in his seat. His face flushed. To Mr.\nRicardo that had been from the beginning the most interesting problem\nof the case. Was he to have the answer now?\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Wethermill, with some hesitation, and then it\nseemed that he was at once ashamed of his hesitation. His accent\ngathered strength, and in a low but ringing voice, he added: \"But I say\nthis. You have told me, M. Hanaud, of women who looked innocent and\nwere guilty. But you know also of women and girls who can live\nuntainted and unspoilt amidst surroundings which are suspicious.\"\n\nHanaud listened, but he neither agreed nor denied. He took up a second\nslip of paper.\n\n\"I shall tell you something now of Mme. Dauvray,\" he said. \"We will not\ntake up her early history. It might not be edifying and, poor woman,\nshe is dead. Let us not go back beyond her marriage seventeen years ago\nto a wealthy manufacturer of Nancy, whom she had met in Paris. Seven\nyears ago M. Dauvray died, leaving his widow a very rich woman. She had\na passion for jewellery, which she was now able to gratify. She\ncollected jewels. A famous necklace, a well-known stone--she was not,\nas you say, happy till she got it. She had a fortune in precious\nstones--oh, but a large fortune! By the ostentation of her jewels she\nparaded her wealth here, at Monte Carlo, in Paris. Besides that, she\nwas kind-hearted and most impressionable. Finally, she was, like so\nmany of her class, superstitious to the degree of folly.\"\n\nSuddenly Mr. Ricardo started in his chair. Superstitious! The word was\na sudden light upon his darkness. Now he knew what had perplexed him\nduring the last two days. Clearly--too clearly--he remembered where he\nhad seen Celia Harland, and when. A picture rose before his eyes, and\nit seemed to strengthen like a film in a developing-dish as Hanaud\ncontinued:\n\n\"Very well! take Mme. Dauvray as we find her--rich, ostentatious,\neasily taken by a new face, generous, and foolishly superstitious--and\nyou have in her a living provocation to every rogue. By a hundred\ninstances she proclaimed herself a dupe. She threw down a challenge to\nevery criminal to come and rob her. For seven years Helene Vauquier\nstands at her elbow and protects her from serious trouble. Suddenly\nthere is added to her--your young friend, and she is robbed and\nmurdered. And, follow this, M. Wethermill, our thieves are, I think,\nmore brutal to their victims than is the case with you.\"\n\nWethermill shut his eyes in a spasm of pain and the pallor of his face\nincreased.\n\n\"Suppose that Celia were one of the victims?\" he cried in a stifled\nvoice.\n\nHanaud glanced at him with a look of commiseration.\n\n\"That perhaps we shall see,\" he said. \"But what I meant was this. A\nstranger like Mlle. Celie might be the accomplice in such a crime as\nthe crime of the Villa Rose, meaning only robbery. A stranger might\nonly have discovered too late that murder would be added to the theft.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in strong, clear colours, Ricardo's picture stood out before\nhis eyes. He was startled by hearing Wethermill say, in a firm voice:\n\n\"My friend Ricardo has something to add to what you have said.\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed Ricardo. How in the world could Wethermill know of that\nclear picture in his mind?\n\n\"Yes. You saw Celia Harland on the evening before the murder.\"\n\nRicardo stared at his friend. It seemed to him that Harry Wethermill\nhad gone out of his mind. Here he was corroborating the suspicions of\nthe police by facts--damning and incontrovertible facts.\n\n\"On the night before the murder,\" continued Wethermill quietly, \"Celia\nHarland lost money at the baccarat-table. Ricardo saw her in the garden\nbehind the rooms, and she was hysterical. Later on that same night he\nsaw her again with me, and he heard what she said. I asked her to come\nto the rooms on the next evening--yesterday, the night of the\ncrime--and her face changed, and she said, 'No, we have other plans for\nto-morrow. But the night after I shall want you.'\"\n\nHanaud sprang up from his chair.\n\n\"And YOU tell me these two things!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wethermill. \"You were kind enough to say to me I was not a\nromantic boy. I am not. I can face facts.\"\n\nHanaud stared at his companion for a few moments. Then, with a\nremarkable air of consideration, he bowed.\n\n\"You have won, monsieur,\" he said. \"I will take up this case. But,\" and\nhis face grew stern and he brought his fist down upon the table with a\nbang, \"I shall follow it to the end now, be the consequences bitter as\ndeath to you.\"\n\n\"That is what I wish, monsieur,\" said Wethermill.\n\nHanaud locked up the slips of paper in his lettercase. Then he went out\nof the room and returned in a few minutes.\n\n\"We will begin at the beginning,\" he said briskly. \"I have telephoned\nto the Depot. Perrichet, the sergent-de-ville who discovered the crime,\nwill be here at once. We will walk down to the villa with him, and on\nthe way he shall tell us exactly what he discovered and how he\ndiscovered it. At the villa we shall find Monsieur Fleuriot, the Juge\nd'instruction, who has already begun his examination, and the\nCommissaire of Police. In company with them we will inspect the villa.\nExcept for the removal of Mme. Dauvray's body from the salon to her\nbedroom and the opening of the windows, the house remains exactly as it\nwas.\"\n\n\"We may come with you?\" cried Harry Wethermill eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, on one condition--that you ask no questions, and answer none\nunless I put them to you. Listen, watch, examine--but no interruptions!\"\n\nHanaud's manner had altogether changed. It was now authoritative and\nalert. He turned to Ricardo.\n\n\"You will swear to what you saw in the garden and to the words you\nheard?\" he asked. \"They are important.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ricardo.\n\nBut he kept silence about that clear picture in his mind which to him\nseemed no less important, no less suggestive.\n\nThe Assembly Hall at Leamington, a crowded audience chiefly of ladies,\na platform at one end on which a black cabinet stood. A man, erect and\nwith something of the soldier in his bearing, led forward a girl,\npretty and fair-haired, who wore a black velvet dress with a long,\nsweeping train. She moved like one in a dream. Some half-dozen people\nfrom the audience climbed on to the platform, tied the girl's hands\nwith tape behind her back, and sealed the tape. She was led to the\ncabinet, and in full view of the audience fastened to a bench. Then the\ndoor of the cabinet was closed, the people upon the platform descended\ninto the body of the hall, and the lights were turned very low. The\naudience sat in suspense, and then abruptly in the silence and the\ndarkness there came the rattle of a tambourine from the empty platform.\nRappings and knockings seemed to flicker round the panels of the hall,\nand in the place where the door of the cabinet should be there appeared\na splash of misty whiteness. The whiteness shaped itself dimly into the\nfigure of a woman, a face dark and Eastern became visible, and a deep\nvoice spoke in a chant of the Nile and Antony. Then the vision faded,\nthe tambourines and cymbals rattled again. The lights were turned up,\nthe door of the cabinet thrown open, and the girl in the black velvet\ndress was seen fastened upon the bench within.\n\nIt was a spiritualistic performance at which Julius Ricardo had been\npresent two years ago. The young, fair-haired girl in black velvet, the\nmedium, was Celia Harland.\n\nThat was the picture which was in Ricardo's mind, and Hanaud's\ndescription of Mme. Dauvray made a terrible commentary upon it. \"Easily\ntaken by a new face, generous, and foolishly superstitious, a living\nprovocation to every rogue.\" Those were the words, and here was a\nbeautiful girl of twenty versed in those very tricks of imposture which\nwould make Mme. Dauvray her natural prey!\n\nRicardo looked at Wethermill, doubtful whether he should tell what he\nknew of Celia Harland or not. But before he had decided a knock came\nupon the door.\n\n\"Here is Perrichet,\" said Hanaud, taking up his hat. \"We will go down\nto the Villa Rose.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPERRICHET'S STORY\n\n\nPerrichet was a young, thick-set man, with a red, fair face, and a\nmoustache and hair so pale in colour that they were almost silver. He\ncame into the room with an air of importance.\n\n\"Aha!\" said Hanaud, with a malicious smile. \"You went to bed late last\nnight, my friend. Yet you were up early enough to read the newspaper.\nWell, I am to have the honour of being associated with you in this\ncase.\"\n\nPerrichet twirled his cap awkwardly and blushed.\n\n\"Monsieur is pleased to laugh at me,\" he said. \"But it was not I who\ncalled myself intelligent. Though indeed I would like to be so, for the\ngood God knows I do not look it.\"\n\nHanaud clapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Then congratulate yourself! It is a great advantage to be intelligent\nand not to look it. We shall get on famously. Come!\"\n\nThe four men descended the stairs, and as they walked towards the villa\nPerrichet related, concisely and clearly, his experience of the night.\n\n\"I passed the gate of the villa about half-past nine,\" he said. \"The\ngate was closed. Above the wall and bushes of the garden I saw a bright\nlight in the room upon the first floor which faces the road at the\nsouth-western comer of the villa. The lower windows I could not see.\nMore than an hour afterwards I came back, and as I passed the villa\nagain I noticed that there was now no light in the room upon the first\nfloor, but that the gate was open. I thereupon went into the garden,\nand, pulling the gate, let it swing to and latch. But it occurred to me\nas I did so that there might be visitors at the villa who had not yet\nleft, and for whom the gate had been set open. I accordingly followed\nthe drive which winds round to the front door. The front door is not on\nthe side of the villa which faces the road, but at the back. When I\ncame to the open space where the carriages turn, I saw that the house\nwas in complete darkness. There were wooden latticed doors to the long\nwindows on the ground floor, and these were closed. I tried one to make\ncertain, and found the fastenings secure. The other windows upon that\nfloor were shuttered. No light gleamed anywhere. I then left the\ngarden, closing the gate behind me. I heard a clock strike the hour a\nfew minutes afterwards, so that I can be sure of the time. It was now\neleven o'clock. I came round a third time an hour after, and to my\nastonishment I found the gate once more open. I had left it closed and\nthe house shut up and dark. Now it stood open! I looked up to the\nwindows and I saw that in a room on the second floor, close beneath the\nroof, a light was burning brightly. That room had been dark an hour\nbefore. I stood and watched the light for a few minutes, thinking that\nI should see it suddenly go out. But it did not: it burned quite\nsteadily. This light and the gate opened and reopened aroused my\nsuspicions. I went again into the garden, but this time with greater\ncaution. It was a clear night, and, although there was no moon, I could\nsee without the aid of my lantern. I stole quietly along the drive.\nWhen I came round to the front door, I noticed immediately that the\nshutters of one of the ground-floor windows were swung back, and that\nthe inside glass window which descended to the ground stood open. The\nsight gave me a shock. Within the house those shutters had been opened.\nI felt the blood turn to ice in my veins and a chill crept along my\nspine. I thought of that solitary light burning steadily under the\nroof. I was convinced that something terrible had happened.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Quite so,\" said Hanaud. \"Go on, my friend.\"\n\n\"The interior of the room gaped black,\" Perrichet resumed. \"I crept up\nto the window at the side of the wall and flashed my lantern into the\nroom. The window, however, was in a recess which opened into the room\nthrough an arch, and at each side of the arch curtains were draped. The\ncurtains were not closed, but between them I could see nothing but a\nstrip of the room. I stepped carefully in, taking heed not to walk on\nthe patch of grass before the window. The light of my lantern showed me\na chair overturned upon the floor, and to my right, below the middle\none of the three windows in the right-hand side wall, a woman lying\nhuddled upon the floor. It was Mme. Dauvray. She was dressed. There was\na little mud upon her shoes, as though she had walked after the rain\nhad ceased. Monsieur will remember that two heavy showers fell last\nevening between six and eight.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hanaud, nodding his approval.\n\n\"She was quite dead. Her face was terribly swollen and black, and a\npiece of thin strong cord was knotted so tightly about her neck and had\nsunk so deeply into her flesh that at first I did not see it. For Mme.\nDauvray was stout.\"\n\n\"Then what did you do?\" asked Hanaud.\n\n\"I went to the telephone which was in the hall and rang up the police.\nThen I crept upstairs very cautiously, trying the doors. I came upon no\none until I reached the room under the roof where the light was\nburning; there I found Helene Vauquier, the maid, snoring in bed in a\nterrible fashion.\"\n\nThe four men turned a bend in the road. A few paces away a knot of\npeople stood before a gate which a sergent-de-ville guarded.\n\n\"But here we are at the villa,\" said Hanaud.\n\nThey all looked up and, from a window at the corner upon the first\nfloor a man looked out and drew in his head.\n\n\"That is M. Besnard, the Commissaire of our police in Aix,\" said\nPerrichet.\n\n\"And the window from which he looked,\" said Hanaud, \"must be the window\nof that room in which you saw the bright light at half-past nine on\nyour first round?\"\n\n\"Yes, m'sieur,\" said Perrichet; \"that is the window.\"\n\nThey stopped at the gate. Perrichet spoke to the sergent-de-ville, who\nat once held the gate open. The party passed into the garden of the\nvilla.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAT THE VILLA\n\n\nThe drive curved between trees and high bushes towards the back of the\nhouse, and as the party advanced along it a small, trim, soldier-like\nman, with a pointed beard, came to meet them. It was the man who had\nlooked out from the window, Louis Besnard, the Commissaire of Police.\n\n\"You are coming, then, to help us, M. Hanaud!\" he cried, extending his\nhands. \"You will find no jealousy here; no spirit amongst us of\nanything but good will; no desire except one to carry out your\nsuggestions. All we wish is that the murderers should be discovered.\nMon Dieu, what a crime! And so young a girl to be involved in it! But\nwhat will you?\"\n\n\"So you have already made your mind up on that point!\" said Hanaud\nsharply.\n\nThe Commissaire shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Examine the villa and then judge for yourself whether any other\nexplanation is conceivable,\" he said; and turning, he waved his hand\ntowards the house. Then he cried, \"Ah!\" and drew himself into an\nattitude of attention. A tall, thin man of about forty-five years,\ndressed in a frock coat and a high silk hat, had just come round an\nangle of the drive and was moving slowly towards them. He wore the\nsoft, curling brown beard of one who has never used a razor on his\nchin, and had a narrow face with eyes of a very light grey, and a round\nbulging forehead.\n\n\"This is the Juge d'Instruction?\" asked Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes; M. Fleuriot,\" replied Louis Besnard in a whisper.\n\nM. Fleuriot was occupied with his own thoughts, and it was not until\nBesnard stepped forward noisily on the gravel that he became aware of\nthe group in the garden.\n\n\"This is M. Hanaud, of the Surete in Paris,\" said Louis Besnard.\n\nM. Fleuriot bowed with cordiality.\n\n\"You are very welcome, M. Hanaud. You will find that nothing at the\nvilla has been disturbed. The moment the message arrived over the\ntelephone that you were willing to assist us I gave instructions that\nall should be left as we found it. I trust that you, with your\nexperience, will see a way where our eyes find none.\"\n\nHanaud bowed in reply.\n\n\"I shall do my best, M. Fleuriot. I can say no more,\" he said.\n\n\"But who are these gentlemen?\" asked Fleuriot, waking, it seemed, now\nfor the first time to the presence of Harry Wethermill and Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"They are both friends of mine,\" replied Hanaud. \"If you do not object\nI think their assistance may be useful. Mr. Wethermill, for instance,\nwas acquainted with Celia Harland.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the judge; and his face took on suddenly a keen and eager\nlook. \"You can tell me about her perhaps?\"\n\n\"All that I know I will tell readily,\" said Harry Wethermill.\n\nInto the light eyes of M. Fleuriot there came a cold, bright gleam. He\ntook a step forward. His face seemed to narrow to a greater sharpness.\nIn a moment, to Mr. Ricardo's thought, he ceased to be the judge; he\ndropped from his high office; he dwindled into a fanatic.\n\n\"She is a Jewess, this Celia Harland?\" he cried.\n\n\"No, M. Fleuriot, she is not,\" replied Wethermill. \"I do not speak in\ndisparagement of that race, for I count many friends amongst its\nmembers. But Celia Harland is not one of them.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Fleuriot; and there was something of disappointment,\nsomething, too, of incredulity, in his voice. \"Well, you will come and\nreport to me when you have made your investigation.\" And he passed on\nwithout another question or remark.\n\nThe group of men watched him go, and it was not until he was out of\nearshot that Besnard turned with a deprecating gesture to Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes, yes, he is a good judge, M. Hanaud--quick, discriminating,\nsympathetic; but he has that bee in his bonnet, like so many others.\nEverywhere he must see l'affaire Dreyfus. He cannot get it out of his\nhead. No matter how insignificant a woman is murdered, she must have\nletters in her possession which would convict Dreyfus. But you know!\nThere are thousands like that--good, kindly, just people in the\nordinary ways of life, but behind every crime they see the Jew.\"\n\nHanaud nodded his head.\n\n\"I know; and in a Juge d'Instruction it is very embarrassing. Let us\nwalk on.\"\n\nHalf-way between the gate and the villa a second carriage-road struck\noff to the left, and at the entrance to it stood a young, stout man in\nblack leggings.\n\n\"The chauffeur?\" asked Hanaud. \"I will speak to him.\"\n\nThe Commissaire called the chauffeur forward.\n\n\"Servettaz,\" he said, \"you will answer any questions which monsieur may\nput to you.\"\n\n\"Certainly, M. le Commissaire,\" said the chauffeur. His manner was\nserious, but he answered readily. There was no sign of fear upon his\nface.\n\n\"How long have you been with Mme. Dauvray?\" Hanaud asked.\n\n\"Four months, monsieur. I drove her to Aix from Paris.\"\n\n\"And since your parents live at Chambery you wished to seize the\nopportunity of spending a day with them while you were so near?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"When did you ask for permission?\"\n\n\"On Saturday, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Did you ask particularly that you should have yesterday, the Tuesday?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I asked only for a day whenever it should be convenient\nto madame.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Hanaud. \"Now, when did Mme. Dauvray tell you that you\nmight have Tuesday?\"\n\nServettaz hesitated. His face became troubled. When he spoke, he spoke\nreluctantly.\n\n\"It was not Mme. Dauvray, monsieur, who told me that I might go on\nTuesday,\" he said.\n\n\"Not Mme. Dauvray! Who was it, then?\" Hanaud asked sharply.\n\nServettaz glanced from one to another of the grave faces which\nconfronted him.\n\n\"It was Mlle. Celie,\" he said, \"who told me.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Hanaud, slowly. \"It was Mlle. Celie. When did she tell you?\"\n\n\"On Monday morning, monsieur. I was cleaning the car. She came to the\ngarage with some flowers in her hand which she had been cutting in the\ngarden, and she said: 'I was right, Alphonse. Madame has a kind heart.\nYou can go to-morrow by the train which leaves Aix at 1.52 and arrives\nat Chambery at nine minutes after two.'\"\n\nHanaud started.\n\n\"'I was right, Alphonse.' Were those her words? And 'Madame has a kind\nheart.' Come, come, what is all this?\" He lifted a warning finger and\nsaid gravely, \"Be very careful, Servettaz.\"\n\n\"Those were her words, monsieur.\"\n\n\"'I was right, Alphonse. Madame has a kind heart'?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Then Mlle. Celie had spoken to you before about this visit of yours to\nChambery,\" said Hanaud, with his eyes fixed steadily upon the\nchauffeur's face. The distress upon Servettaz's face increased.\nSuddenly Hanaud's voice rang sharply. \"You hesitate. Begin at the\nbeginning. Speak the truth, Servettaz!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I am speaking the truth,\" said the chauffeur. \"It is true I\nhesitate ... I have heard this morning what people are saying ... I do\nnot know what to think. Mlle. Celie was always kind and thoughtful for\nme ... But it is true\"--and with a kind of desperation he went\non--\"yes, it is true that it was Mlle. Celie who first suggested to me\nthat I should ask for a day to go to Chambery.\"\n\n\"When did she suggest it?\"\n\n\"On the Saturday.\"\n\nTo Mr. Ricardo the words were startling. He glanced with pity towards\nWethermill. Wethermill, however, had made up his mind for good and all.\nHe stood with a dogged look upon his face, his chin thrust forward, his\neyes upon the chauffeur. Besnard, the Commissaire, had made up his\nmind, too. He merely shrugged his shoulders. Hanaud stepped forward and\nlaid his hand gently on the chauffeur's arm.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" he said, \"let us hear exactly how this happened!\"\n\n\"Mlle. Celie,\" said Servettaz, with genuine compunction in his voice,\n\"came to the garage on Saturday morning and ordered the car for the\nafternoon. She stayed and talked to me for a little while, as she often\ndid. She said that she had been told that my parents lived at Chambery,\nand since I was so near I ought to ask for a holiday. For it would not\nbe kind if I did not go and see them.\"\n\n\"That was all?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" And the detective resumed at once his brisk voice and\nalert manner. He seemed to dismiss Servettaz's admission from his mind.\nRicardo had the impression of a man tying up an important document\nwhich for the moment he has done with, and putting it away ticketed in\nsome pigeon-hole in his desk. \"Let us see the garage!\"\n\nThey followed the road between the bushes until a turn showed them the\ngarage with its doors open.\n\n\"The doors were found unlocked?\"\n\n\"Just as you see them.\"\n\nHanaud nodded. He spoke again to Servettaz. \"What did you do with the\nkey on Tuesday?\"\n\n\"I gave it to Helene Vauquier, monsieur, after I had locked up the\ngarage. And she hung it on a nail in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hanaud. \"So any one could easily, have found it last\nnight?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur--if one knew where to look for it.\"\n\nAt the back of the garage a row of petrol-tins stood against the brick\nwall.\n\n\"Was any petrol taken?\" asked Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; there was very little petrol in the car when I went\naway. More was taken, but it was taken from the middle tins--these.\"\nAnd he touched the tins.\n\n\"I see,\" said Hanaud, and he raised his eyebrows thoughtfully. The\nCommissaire moved with impatience.\n\n\"From the middle or from the end--what does it matter?\" he exclaimed.\n\"The petrol was taken.\"\n\nHanaud, however, did not dismiss the point so lightly.\n\n\"But it is very possible that it does matter,\" he said gently. \"For\nexample, if Servettaz had had no reason to examine his tins it might\nhave been some while before he found out that the petrol had been\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said Servettaz. \"I might even have forgotten that I had\nnot used it myself.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Hanaud, and he turned to Besnard. \"I think\nthat may be important. I do not know,\" he said.\n\n\"But since the car is gone,\" cried Besnard, \"how could the chauffeur\nnot look immediately at his tins?\"\n\nThe question had occurred to Ricardo, and he wondered in what way\nHanaud meant to answer it. Hanaud, however, did not mean to answer it.\nHe took little notice of it at all. He put it aside with a superb\nindifference to the opinion which his companions might form of him.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he said, carelessly. \"Since the car is gone, as you say,\nthat is so.\" And he turned again to Servettaz.\n\n\"It was a powerful car?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sixty horse-power,\" said Servettaz.\n\nHanaud turned to the Commissaire.\n\n\"You have the number and description, I suppose? It will be as well to\nadvertise for it. It may have been seen; it must be somewhere.\"\n\nThe Commissaire replied that the description had already been printed,\nand Hanaud, with a nod of approval, examined the ground. In front of\nthe garage there was a small stone courtyard, but on its surface there\nwas no trace of a footstep.\n\n\"Yet the gravel was wet,\" he said, shaking his head. \"The man who\nfetched that car fetched it carefully.\"\n\nHe turned and walked back with his eyes upon the ground. Then he ran to\nthe grass border between the gravel and the bushes.\n\n\"Look!\" he said to Wethermill; \"a foot has pressed the blades of grass\ndown here, but very lightly--yes, and there again. Some one ran along\nthe border here on his toes. Yes, he was very careful.\"\n\nThey turned again into the main drive, and, following it for a few\nyards, came suddenly upon a space in front of the villa. It was a small\ntoy pleasure-house, looking on to a green lawn gay with flower-beds. It\nwas built of yellow stone, and was almost square in shape. A couple of\nornate pillars flanked the door, and a gable roof, topped by a gilt\nvane, surmounted it. To Ricardo it seemed impossible that so sordid and\nsinister a tragedy had taken place within its walls during the last\ntwelve hours. It glistened so gaudily in the blaze of sunlight. Here\nand there the green outer shutters were closed; here and there the\nwindows stood open to let in the air and light. Upon each side of the\ndoor there was a window lighting the hall, which was large; beyond\nthose windows again, on each side, there were glass doors opening to\nthe ground and protected by the ordinary green latticed shutters of\nwood, which now stood hooked back against the wall. These glass doors\nopened into rooms oblong in shape, which ran through towards the back\nof the house, and were lighted in addition by side windows. The room\nupon the extreme left, as the party faced the villa, was the\ndining-room, with the kitchen at the back; the room on the right was\nthe salon in which the murder had been committed. In front of the glass\ndoor to this room a strip of what had once been grass stretched to the\ngravel drive. But the grass had been worn away by constant use, and the\nblack mould showed through. This strip was about three yards wide, and\nas they approached they saw, even at a distance, that since the rain of\nlast night it had been trampled down.\n\n\"We will go round the house first,\" said Hanaud, and he turned along\nthe side of the villa and walked in the direction of the road. There\nwere four windows just above his head, of which three lighted the\nsalon, and the fourth a small writing-room behind it. Under these\nwindows there was no disturbance of the ground, and a careful\ninvestigation showed conclusively that the only entrance used had been\nthe glass doors of the salon facing the drive. To that spot, then, they\nreturned. There were three sets of footmarks upon the soil. One set ran\nin a distinct curve from the drive to the side of the door, and did not\ncross the others.\n\n\"Those,\" said Hanaud, \"are the footsteps of my intelligent friend,\nPerrichet, who was careful not to disturb the ground.\"\n\nPerrichet beamed all over his rosy face, and Besnard nodded at him with\ncondescending approval.\n\n\"But I wish, M. le Commissaire\"--and Hanaud pointed to a blur of\nmarks--\"that your other officers had been as intelligent. Look! These\nrun from the glass door to the drive, and, for all the use they are to\nus, a harrow might have been dragged across them.\"\n\nBesnard drew himself up.\n\n\"Not one of my officers has entered the room by way of this door. The\nstrictest orders were given and obeyed. The ground, as you see it, is\nthe ground as it was at twelve o'clock last night.\"\n\nHanaud's face grew thoughtful.\n\n\"Is that so?\" he said, and he stooped to examine the second set of\nmarks. They were at the righthand side of the door. \"A woman and a\nman,\" he said. \"But they are mere hints rather than prints. One might\nalmost think--\" He rose up without finishing his sentence, and he\nturned to the third set and a look of satisfaction gleamed upon his\nface. \"Ah! here is something more interesting,\" he said.\n\nThere were just three impressions; and, whereas the blurred marks were\nat the side, these three pointed straight from the middle of the glass\ndoors to the drive. They were quite clearly defined, and all three were\nthe impressions made by a woman's small, arched, high-heeled shoe. The\nposition of the marks was at first sight a little peculiar. There was\none a good yard from the window, the impression of the right foot, and\nthe pressure of the sole of the shoe was more marked than that of the\nheel. The second, the impression of the left foot, was not quite so far\nfrom the first as the first was from the window, and here again the\nheel was the more lightly defined. But there was this difference--the\nmark of the toe, which was pointed in the first instance, was, in this,\nbroader and a trifle blurred. Close beside it the right foot was again\nvisible; only now the narrow heel was more clearly defined than the\nball of the foot. It had, indeed, sunk half an inch into the soft\nground. There were no further imprints. Indeed, these two were not\nmerely close together, they were close to the gravel of the drive and\non the very border of the grass.\n\nHanaud looked at the marks thoughtfully. Then he turned to the\nCommissaire.\n\n\"Are there any shoes in the house which fit those marks?\"\n\n\"Yes. We have tried the shoes of all the women--Celie Harland, the\nmaid, and even Mme. Dauvray. The only ones which fit at all are those\ntaken from Celie Harland's bedroom.\"\n\nHe called to an officer standing in the drive, and a pair of grey suede\nshoes were brought to him from the hall.\n\n\"See, M. Hanaud, it is a pretty little foot which made those clear\nimpressions,\" he said, with a smile; \"a foot arched and slender. Mme.\nDauvray's foot is short and square, the maid's broad and flat. Neither\nMme. Dauvray nor Helene Vauquier could have worn these shoes. They were\nlying, one here, one there, upon the floor of Celie Harland's room, as\nthough she had kicked them off in a hurry. They are almost new, you\nsee. They have been worn once, perhaps, no more, and they fit with\nabsolute precision into those footmarks, except just at the toe of that\nsecond one.\"\n\nHanaud took the shoes and, kneeling down, placed them one after the\nother over the impressions. To Ricardo it was extraordinary how exactly\nthey covered up the marks and filled the indentations.\n\n\"I should say,\" said the Commissaire, \"that Celie Harland went away\nwearing a new pair of shoes made on the very same last as those.\"\n\nAs those she had left carelessly lying on the floor of her room for the\nfirst person to notice, thought Ricardo! It seemed as if the girl had\ngone out of her way to make the weight of evidence against her as heavy\nas possible. Yet, after all, it was just through inattention to the\nsmall details, so insignificant at the red moment of crime, so terribly\ninstructive the next day, that guilt was generally brought home.\n\nHanaud rose to his feet and handed the shoes back to the officer.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"so it seems. The shoemaker can help us here. I see the\nshoes were made in Aix.\"\n\nBesnard looked at the name stamped in gold letters upon the lining of\nthe shoes.\n\n\"I will have inquiries made,\" he said.\n\nHanaud nodded, took a measure from his pocket and measured the ground\nbetween the window and the first footstep, and between the first\nfootstep and the other two.\n\n\"How tall is Mlle. Celie?\" he asked, and he addressed the question to\nWethermill. It struck Ricardo as one of the strangest details in all\nthis strange affair that the detective should ask with confidence for\ninformation which might help to bring Celia Harland to the guillotine\nfrom the man who had staked his happiness upon her innocence.\n\n\"About five feet seven,\" he answered.\n\nHanaud replaced his measure in his pocket. He turned with a grave face\nto Wethermill.\n\n\"I warned you fairly, didn't I?\" he said.\n\nWethermill's white face twitched.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I am not afraid.\" But there was more of anxiety in his\nvoice than there had been before.\n\nHanaud pointed solemnly to the ground.\n\n\"Read the story those footprints write in the mould there. A young and\nactive girl of about Mlle. Celie's height, and wearing a new pair of\nMlle. Celie's shoes, springs from that room where the murder was\ncommitted, where the body of the murdered woman lies. She is running.\nShe is wearing a long gown. At the second step the hem of the gown\ncatches beneath the point of her shoe. She stumbles. To save herself\nfrom falling she brings up the other foot sharply and stamps the heel\ndown into the ground. She recovers her balance. She steps on to the\ndrive. It is true the gravel here is hard and takes no mark, but you\nwill see that some of the mould which has clung to her shoes has\ndropped off. She mounts into the motor-car with the man and the other\nwoman and drives off--some time between eleven and twelve.\"\n\n\"Between eleven and twelve? Is that sure?\" asked Besnard.\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Hanaud. \"The gate is open at eleven, and Perrichet\ncloses it. It is open again at twelve. Therefore the murderers had not\ngone before eleven. No; the gate was open for them to go, but they had\nnot gone. Else why should the gate again be open at midnight?\"\n\nBesnard nodded in assent, and suddenly Perrichet started forward, with\nhis eyes full of horror.\n\n\"Then, when I first closed the gate,\" he cried, \"and came into the\ngarden and up to the house they were here--in that room? Oh, my God!\"\nHe stared at the window, with his mouth open.\n\n\"I am afraid, my friend, that is so,\" said Hanaud gravely.\n\n\"But I knocked upon the wooden door, I tried the bolts; and they were\nwithin--in the darkness within, holding their breath not three yards\nfrom me.\"\n\nHe stood transfixed.\n\n\"That we shall see,\" said Hanaud.\n\nHe stepped in Perrichet's footsteps to the sill of the room. He\nexamined the green wooden doors which opened outwards, and the glass\ndoors which opened inwards, taking a magnifying-glass from his pocket.\nHe called Besnard to his side.\n\n\"See!\" he said, pointing to the woodwork.\n\n\"Finger-marks!\" asked Besnard eagerly.\n\n\"Yes; of hands in gloves,\" returned Hanaud. \"We shall learn nothing\nfrom these marks except that the assassins knew their trade.\"\n\nThen he stooped down to the sill, where some traces of steps were\nvisible. He rose with a gesture of resignation.\n\n\"Rubber shoes,\" he said, and so stepped into the room, followed by\nWethermill and the others. They found themselves in a small recess\nwhich was panelled with wood painted white, and here and there\ndelicately carved into festoons of flowers. The recess ended in an\narch, supported by two slender pillars, and on the inner side of the\narch thick curtains of pink silk were hung. These were drawn back\ncarelessly, and through the opening between them the party looked down\nthe length of the room beyond. They passed within.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIN THE SALON\n\n\nJulius Ricardo pushed aside the curtains with a thrill of excitement.\nHe found himself standing within a small oblong room which was\nprettily, even daintily, furnished. On his left, close by the recess,\nwas a small fireplace with the ashes of a burnt-out fire in the grate.\nBeyond the grate a long settee covered in pink damask, with a crumpled\ncushion at each end, stood a foot or two away from the wall, and beyond\nthe settee the door of the room opened into the hall. At the end a long\nmirror was let into the panelling, and a writing-table stood by the\nmirror. On the right were the three windows, and between the two\nnearest to Mr. Ricardo was the switch of the electric light. A\nchandelier hung from the ceiling, an electric lamp stood upon the\nwriting-table, a couple of electric candles on the mantel-shelf. A\nround satinwood table stood under the windows, with three chairs about\nit, of which one was overturned, one was placed with its back to the\nelectric switch, and the third on the opposite side facing it.\n\nRicardo could hardly believe that he stood actually upon the spot\nwhere, within twelve hours, a cruel and sinister tragedy had taken\nplace. There was so little disorder. The three windows on his right\nshowed him the blue sunlit sky and a glimpse of flowers and trees;\nbehind him the glass doors stood open to the lawn, where birds piped\ncheerfully and the trees murmured of summer. But he saw Hanaud stepping\nquickly from place to place, with an extraordinary lightness of step\nfor so big a man, obviously engrossed, obviously reading here and there\nsome detail, some custom of the inhabitants of that room.\n\nRicardo leaned with careful artistry against the wall.\n\n\"Now, what has this room to say to me?\" he asked importantly. Nobody\npaid the slightest attention to his question, and it was just as well.\nFor the room had very little information to give him. He ran his eye\nover the white Louis Seize furniture, the white panels of the wall, the\npolished floor, the pink curtains. Even the delicate tracery of the\nceiling did not escape his scrutiny. Yet he saw nothing likely to help\nhim but an overturned chair and a couple of crushed cushions on a\nsettee. It was very annoying, all the more annoying because M. Hanaud\nwas so uncommonly busy. Hanaud looked carefully at the long settee and\nthe crumpled cushions, and he took out his measure and measured the\ndistance between the cushion at one end and the cushion at the other.\nHe examined the table, he measured the distance between the chairs. He\ncame to the fireplace and raked in the ashes of the burnt-out fire. But\nRicardo noticed a singular thing. In the midst of his search Hanaud's\neyes were always straying back to the settee, and always with a look of\nextreme perplexity, as if he read there something, definitely\nsomething, but something which he could not explain. Finally he went\nback to it; he drew it farther away from the wall, and suddenly with a\nlittle cry he stooped and went down on his knees. When he rose he was\nholding some torn fragments of paper in his hand. He went over to the\nwriting-table and opened the blotting-book. Where it fell open there\nwere some sheets of note-paper, and one particular sheet of which half\nhad been torn off. He compared the pieces which he held with that torn\nsheet, and seemed satisfied.\n\nThere was a rack for note-paper upon the table, and from it he took a\nstiff card.\n\n\"Get me some gum or paste, and quickly,\" he said. His voice had become\nbrusque, the politeness had gone from his address. He carried the card\nand the fragments of paper to the round table. There he sat down and,\nwith infinite patience, gummed the fragments on to the card, fitting\nthem together like the pieces of a Chinese puzzle.\n\nThe others over his shoulders could see spaced words, written in\npencil, taking shape as a sentence upon the card. Hanaud turned\nabruptly in his seat toward Wethermill.\n\n\"You have, no doubt, a letter written by Mlle. Celie?\"\n\nWethermill took his letter-case from his pocket and a letter out of the\ncase. He hesitated for a moment as he glanced over what was written.\nThe four sheets were covered. He folded back the letter, so that only\nthe two inner sheets were visible, and handed it to Hanaud. Hanaud\ncompared it with the handwriting upon the card.\n\n\"Look!\" he said at length, and the three men gathered behind him. On\nthe card the gummed fragments of paper revealed a sentence:\n\n\"Je ne sais pas.\"\n\n\"'I do not know,'\" said Ricardo; \"now this is very important.\"\n\nBeside the card Celia's letter to Wethermill was laid.\n\n\"What do you think?\" asked Hanaud.\n\nBesnard, the Commissaire of Police, bent over Hanaud's shoulder.\n\n\"There are strong resemblances,\" he said guardedly.\n\nRicardo was on the look-out for deep mysteries. Resemblances were not\nenough for him; they were inadequate to the artistic needs of the\nsituation.\n\n\"Both were written by the same hand,\" he said definitely; \"only in the\nsentence written upon the card the handwriting is carefully disguised.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Commissaire, bending forward again. \"Here is an idea!\nYes, yes, there are strong differences.\"\n\nRicardo looked triumphant.\n\n\"Yes, there are differences,\" said Hanaud. \"Look how long the up stroke\nof the 'p' is, how it wavers! See how suddenly this 's' straggles off,\nas though some emotion made the hand shake. Yet this,\" and touching\nWethermill's letter he smiled ruefully, \"this is where the emotion\nshould have affected the pen.\" He looked up at Wethermill's face and\nthen said quietly:\n\n\"You have given us no opinion, monsieur. Yet your opinion should be the\nmost valuable of all. Were these two papers written by the same hand?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Wethermill.\n\n\"And I, too,\" cried Hanaud, in a sudden exasperation, \"je ne sais pas.\nI do not know. It may be her hand carelessly counterfeited. It may be\nher hand disguised. It may be simply that she wrote in a hurry with her\ngloves on.\"\n\n\"It may have been written some time ago,\" said Mr. Ricardo, encouraged\nby his success to another suggestion.\n\n\"No; that is the one thing it could not have been,\" said Hanaud. \"Look\nround the room. Was there ever a room better tended? Find me a little\npile of dust in any one corner if you can! It is all as clean as a\nplate. Every morning, except this one morning, this room has been swept\nand polished. The paper was written and torn up yesterday.\"\n\nHe enclosed the card in an envelope as he spoke, and placed it in his\npocket. Then he rose and crossed again to the settee. He stood at the\nside of it, with his hands clutching the lapels of his coat and his\nface gravely troubled. After a few moments of silence for himself, of\nsuspense for all the others who watched him, he stooped suddenly.\nSlowly, and with extraordinary care, he pushed his hands under the\nhead-cushion and lifted it up gently, so that the indentations of its\nsurface might not be disarranged. He carried it over to the light of\nthe open window. The cushion was covered with silk, and as he held it\nto the sunlight all could see a small brown stain.\n\nHanaud took his magnifying-glass from his pocket and bent his head over\nthe cushion. But at that moment, careful though he had been, the down\nswelled up within the cushion, the folds and indentations disappeared,\nthe silk covering was stretched smooth.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Besnard tragically. \"What have you done?\"\n\nHanaud's face flushed. He had been guilty of a clumsiness--even he.\n\nMr. Ricardo took up the tale.\n\n\"Yes,\" he exclaimed, \"what have you done?\"\n\nHanaud looked at Ricardo in amazement at his audacity.\n\n\"Well, what have I done?\" he asked. \"Come! tell me!\"\n\n\"You have destroyed a clue,\" replied Ricardo impressively.\n\nThe deepest dejection at once overspread Hanaud's burly face.\n\n\"Don't say that, M. Ricardo, I beseech you!\" he implored. \"A clue! and\nI have destroyed it! But what kind of a clue? And how have I destroyed\nit? And to what mystery would it be a clue if I hadn't destroyed it?\nAnd what will become of me when I go back to Paris, and say in the Rue\nde Jerusalem, 'Let me sweep the cellars, my good friends, for M.\nRicardo knows that I destroyed a clue. Faithfully he promised me that\nhe would not open his mouth, but I destroyed a clue, and his\nperspicacity forced him into speech.'\"\n\nIt was the turn of M. Ricardo to grow red.\n\nHanaud turned with a smile to Besnard.\n\n\"It does not really matter whether the creases in this cushion remain,\"\nhe said, \"we have all seen them.\" And he replaced the glass in his\npocket.\n\nHe carried that cushion back and replaced it. Then he took the other,\nwhich lay at the foot of the settee, and carried it in its turn to the\nwindow. This was indented too, and ridged up, and just at the marks the\nnap of the silk was worn, and there was a slit where it had been cut.\nThe perplexity upon Hanaud's face greatly increased. He stood with the\ncushion in his hands, no longer looking at it, but looking out through\nthe doors at the footsteps so clearly defined--the foot-steps of a girl\nwho had run from this room and sprung into a motor-car and driven away.\nHe shook his head, and, carrying back the cushion, laid it carefully\ndown. Then he stood erect, gazed about the room as though even yet he\nmight force its secrets out from its silence, and cried, with a sudden\nviolence:\n\n\"There is something here, gentlemen, which I do not understand.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo heard some one beside him draw a deep breath, and turned.\nWethermill stood at his elbow. A faint colour had come back to his\ncheeks, his eyes were fixed intently upon Hanaud's face.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he asked; and Hanaud replied brusquely:\n\n\"It's not my business to hold opinions, monsieur; my business is to\nmake sure.\"\n\nThere was one point, and only one, of which he had made every one in\nthat room sure. He had started confident. Here was a sordid crime,\neasily understood. But in that room he had read something which had\ntroubled him, which had raised the sordid crime on to some higher and\nperplexing level.\n\n\"Then M. Fleuriot after all might be right?\" asked the Commissaire\ntimidly.\n\nHanaud stared at him for a second, then smiled.\n\n\"L'affaire Dreyfus?\" he cried. \"Oh la, la, la! No, but there is\nsomething else.\"\n\nWhat was that something? Ricardo asked himself. He looked once more\nabout the room. He did not find his answer, but he caught sight of an\nornament upon the wall which drove the question from his mind. The\nornament, if so it could be called, was a painted tambourine with a\nbunch of bright ribbons tied to the rim; and it was hung upon the wall\nbetween the settee and the fireplace at about the height of a man's\nhead. Of course it might be no more than it seemed to be--a rather\ngaudy and vulgar toy, such as a woman like Mme. Dauvray would be very\nlikely to choose in order to dress her walls. But it swept Ricardo's\nthoughts back of a sudden to the concert-hall at Leamington and the\napparatus of a spiritualistic show. After all, he reflected\ntriumphantly, Hanaud had not noticed everything, and as he made the\nreflection Hanaud's voice broke in to corroborate him.\n\n\"We have seen everything here; let us go upstairs,\" he said. \"We will\nfirst visit the room of Mlle. Celie. Then we will question the maid,\nHelene Vauquier.\"\n\nThe four men, followed by Perrichet, passed out by the door into the\nhall and mounted the stairs. Celia's room was in the southwest angle of\nthe villa, a bright and airy room, of which one window overlooked the\nroad, and two others, between which stood the dressing-table, the\ngarden. Behind the room a door led into a little white-tiled bathroom.\nSome towels were tumbled upon the floor beside the bath. In the bedroom\na dark-grey frock of tussore and a petticoat were flung carelessly on\nthe bed; a big grey hat of Ottoman silk was lying upon a chest of\ndrawers in the recess of a window; and upon a chair a little pile of\nfine linen and a pair of grey silk stockings, which matched in shade\nthe grey suede shoes, were tossed in a heap.\n\n\"It was here that you saw the light at half-past nine?\" Hanaud said,\nturning to Perrichet.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Perrichet.\n\n\"We may assume, then, that Mlle. Celie was changing her dress at that\ntime.\"\n\nBesnard was looking about him, opening a drawer here, a wardrobe there.\n\n\"Mlle. Celie,\" he said, with a laugh, \"was a particular young lady, and\nfond of her fine clothes, if one may judge from the room and the order\nof the cupboards. She must have changed her dress last night in an\nunusual hurry.\"\n\nThere was about the whole room a certain daintiness, almost, it seemed\nto Mr. Ricardo, a fragrance, as though the girl had impressed something\nof her own delicate self upon it. Wethermill stood upon the threshold\nwatching with a sullen face the violation of this chamber by the\nofficers of the police.\n\nNo such feelings, however, troubled Hanaud. He went over to the\ndressing-room and opened a few small leather cases which held Celia's\nornaments. In one or two of them a trinket was visible; others were\nempty. One of these latter Hanaud held open in his hand, and for so\nlong that Besnard moved impatiently.\n\n\"You see it is empty, monsieur,\" he said, and suddenly Wethermill moved\nforward into the room.\n\n\"Yes, I see that,\" said Hanaud dryly.\n\nIt was a case made to hold a couple of long ear-drops--those diamond\near-drops, doubtless, which Mr. Ricardo had seen twinkling in the\ngarden.\n\n\"Will monsieur let me see?\" asked Wethermill, and he took the case in\nhis hands. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Mlle. Celie's ear-drops,\" and he handed the\ncase back with a thoughtful air.\n\nIt was the first time he had taken a definite part in the\ninvestigation. To Ricardo the reason was clear. Harry Wethermill had\nhimself given those ear-drops to Celia. Hanaud replaced the case and\nturned round.\n\n\"There is nothing more for us to see here,\" he said. \"I suppose that no\none has been allowed to enter the room?\" And he opened the door.\n\n\"No one except Helene Vauquier,\" replied the Commissaire.\n\nRicardo felt indignant at so obvious a piece of carelessness. Even\nWethermill looked surprised. Hanaud merely shut the door again.\n\n\"Oho, the maid!\" he said. \"Then she has recovered!\"\n\n\"She is still weak,\" said the Commissaire. \"But I thought it was\nnecessary that we should obtain at once a description of what Celie\nHarland wore when she left the house. I spoke to M. Fleuriot about it,\nand he gave me permission to bring Helene Vauquier here, who alone\ncould tell us. I brought her here myself just before you came. She\nlooked through the girl's wardrobe to see what was missing.\"\n\n\"Was she alone in the room?\"\n\n\"Not for a moment,\" said M. Besnard haughtily. \"Really, monsieur, we\nare not so ignorant of how an affair of this kind should be conducted.\nI was in the room myself the whole time, with my eye upon her.\"\n\n\"That was just before I came,\" said Hanaud. He crossed carelessly to\nthe open window which overlooked the road and, leaning out of it,\nlooked up the road to the corner round which he and his friends had\ncome, precisely as the Commissaire had done. Then he turned back into\nthe room.\n\n\"Which was the last cupboard or drawer that Helene Vauquier touched?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"This one.\"\n\nBesnard stooped and pulled open the bottom drawer of a chest which\nstood in the embrasure of the window. A light-coloured dress was lying\nat the bottom.\n\n\"I told her to be quick,\" said Besnard, \"since I had seen that you were\ncoming. She lifted this dress out and said that nothing was missing\nthere. So I took her back to her room and left her with the nurse.\"\n\nHanaud lifted the light dress from the drawer, shook it out in front of\nthe window, twirled it round, snatched up a corner of it and held it to\nhis eyes, and then, folding it quickly, replaced it in the drawer.\n\n\"Now show me the first drawer she touched.\" And this time he lifted out\na petticoat, and, taking it to the window, examined it with a greater\ncare. When he had finished with it he handed it to Ricardo to put away,\nand stood for a moment or two thoughtful and absorbed. Ricardo in his\nturn examined the petticoat. But he could see nothing unusual. It was\nan attractive petticoat, dainty with frills and lace, but it was hardly\na thing to grow thoughtful over. He looked up in perplexity and saw\nthat Hanaud was watching his investigations with a smile of amusement.\n\n\"When M. Ricardo has put that away,\" he said, \"we will hear what Helene\nVauquier has to tell us.\"\n\nHe passed out of the door last, and, locking it, placed the key in his\npocket.\n\n\"Helene Vauquier's room is, I think, upstairs,\" he said. And he moved\ntowards the staircase.\n\nBut as he did so a man in plain clothes, who had been waiting upon the\nlanding, stepped forward. He carried in his hand a piece of thin,\nstrong whipcord.\n\n\"Ah, Durette!\" cried Besnard. \"Monsieur Hanaud, I sent Durette this\nmorning round the shops of Aix with the cord which was found knotted\nround Mme. Dauvray's neck.\"\n\nHanaud advanced quickly to the man.\n\n\"Well! Did you discover anything?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Durette. \"At the shop of M. Corval, in the Rue du\nCasino, a young lady in a dark-grey frock and hat bought some cord of\nthis kind at a few minutes after nine last night. It was just as the\nshop was being closed. I showed Corval the photograph of Celie Harland\nwhich M. le Commissaire gave me out of Mme. Dauvray's room, and he\nidentified it as the portrait of the girl who had bought the cord.\"\n\nComplete silence followed upon Durette's words. The whole party stood\nlike men stupefied. No one looked towards Wethermill; even Hanaud\naverted his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, that is very important,\" he said awkwardly. He turned away and,\nfollowed by the others, went up the stairs to the bedroom of Helene\nVauquier.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHELENE VAUQUIER'S EVIDENCE\n\n\nA nurse opened the door. Within the room Helene Vauquier was leaning\nback in a chair. She looked ill, and her face was very white. On the\nappearance of Hanaud, the Commissaire, and the others, however, she\nrose to her feet. Ricardo recognised the justice of Hanaud's\ndescription. She stood before them a hard-featured, tall woman of\nthirty-five or forty, in a neat black stuff dress, strong with the\nstrength of a peasant, respectable, reliable. She looked what she had\nbeen, the confidential maid of an elderly woman. On her face there was\nnow an aspect of eager appeal.\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\" she began, \"let me go from here--anywhere--into prison\nif you like. But to stay here--where in years past we were so\nhappy--and with madame lying in the room below. No, it is\ninsupportable.\"\n\nShe sank into her chair, and Hanaud came over to her side.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said, in a soothing voice. \"I can understand your\nfeelings, my poor woman. We will not keep you here. You have, perhaps,\nfriends in Aix with whom you could stay?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, monsieur!\" Helene cried gratefully. \"Oh, but I thank you! That\nI should have to sleep here to-night! Oh, how the fear of that has\nfrightened me!\"\n\n\"You need have had no such fear. After all, we are not the visitors of\nlast night,\" said Hanaud, drawing a chair close to her and patting her\nhand sympathetically. \"Now, I want you to tell these gentlemen and\nmyself all that you know of this dreadful business. Take your time,\nmademoiselle! We are human.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, I know nothing,\" she cried. \"I was told that I might go\nto bed as soon as I had dressed Mlle. Celie for the seance.\"\n\n\"Seance!\" cried Ricardo, startled into speech. The picture of the\nAssembly Hall at Leamington was again before his mind. But Hanaud\nturned towards him, and, though Hanaud's face retained its benevolent\nexpression, there was a glitter in his eyes which sent the blood into\nRicardo's face.\n\n\"Did you speak again, M. Ricardo?\" the detective asked. \"No? I thought\nit was not possible.\" He turned back to Helene Vauquier. \"So Mlle.\nCelie practised seances. That is very strange. We will hear about them.\nWho knows what thread may lead us to the truth?\"\n\nHelene Vauquier shook her head.\n\n\"Monsieur, it is not right that you should seek the truth from me. For,\nconsider this! I cannot speak with justice of Mlle. Celie. No, I\ncannot! I did not like her. I was jealous--yes, jealous. Monsieur, you\nwant the truth--I hated her!\" And the woman's face flushed and she\nclenched her hand upon the arm of her chair. \"Yes, I hated her. How\ncould I help it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Hanaud gently. \"Why could you not help it?\"\n\nHelene Vauquier leaned back again, her strength exhausted, and smiled\nlanguidly.\n\n\"I will tell you. But remember it is a woman speaking to you, and\nthings which you will count silly and trivial mean very much to her.\nThere was one night last June--only last June! To think of it! So\nlittle while ago there was no Mlle. Celie--\" and, as Hanaud raised his\nhand, she said hurriedly, \"Yes, yes; I will control myself. But to\nthink of Mme. Dauvray now!\"\n\nAnd thereupon she blurted out her story and explained to Mr. Ricardo\nthe question which had so perplexed him: how a girl of so much\ndistinction as Celia Harland came to be living with a woman of so\ncommon a type as Mme. Dauvray.\n\n\"Well, one night in June,\" said Helene Vauquier, \"madame went with a\nparty to supper at the Abbaye Restaurant in Montmartre. And she brought\nhome for the first time Mlle. Celie. But you should have seen her! She\nhad on a little plaid skirt and a coat which was falling to pieces, and\nshe was starving--yes, starving. Madame told me the story that night as\nI undressed her. Mlle. Celie was there dancing amidst the tables for a\nsupper with any one who would be kind enough to dance with her.\"\n\nThe scorn of her voice rang through the room. She was the rigid,\nrespectable peasant woman, speaking out her contempt. And Wethermill\nmust needs listen to it. Ricardo dared not glance at him.\n\n\"But hardly any one would dance with her in her rags, and no one would\ngive her supper except madame. Madame did. Madame listened to her story\nof hunger and distress. Madame believed it, and brought her home.\nMadame was so kind, so careless in her kindness. And now she lies\nmurdered for a reward!\" An hysterical sob checked the woman's\nutterances, her face began to work, her hands to twitch.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said Hanaud gently, \"calm yourself, mademoiselle.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier paused for a moment or two to recover her composure. \"I\nbeg your pardon, monsieur, but I have been so long with madame--oh, the\npoor woman! Yes, yes, I will calm myself. Well, madame brought her\nhome, and in a week there was nothing too good for Mlle. Celie. Madame\nwas like a child. Always she was being deceived and imposed upon. Never\nshe learnt prudence. But no one so quickly made her way to madame's\nheart as Mlle. Celie. Mademoiselle must live with her. Mademoiselle\nmust be dressed by the first modistes. Mademoiselle must have lace\npetticoats and the softest linen, long white gloves, and pretty ribbons\nfor her hair, and hats from Caroline Reboux at twelve hundred francs.\nAnd madame's maid must attend upon her and deck her out in all these\ndainty things. Bah!\"\n\nVauquier was sitting erect in her chair, violent, almost rancorous with\nanger. She looked round upon the company and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"I told you not to come to me!\" she said, \"I cannot speak impartially,\nor even gently of mademoiselle. Consider! For years I had been more\nthan madame's maid--her friend; yes, so she was kind enough to call me.\nShe talked to me about everything, consulted me about everything, took\nme with her everywhere. Then she brings home, at two o'clock in the\nmorning, a young girl with a fresh, pretty face, from a Montmartre\nrestaurant, and in a week I am nothing at all--oh, but nothing--and\nmademoiselle is queen.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is quite natural,\" said Hanaud sympathetically. \"You would not\nhave been human, mademoiselle, if you had not felt some anger. But tell\nus frankly about these seances. How did they begin?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" Vauquier answered, \"it was not difficult to begin them.\nMme. Dauvray had a passion for fortune-tellers and rogues of that kind.\nAny one with a pack of cards and some nonsense about a dangerous woman\nwith black hair or a man with a limp--Monsieur knows the stories they\nstring together in dimly lighted rooms to deceive the credulous--any\none could make a harvest out of madame's superstitions. But monsieur\nknows the type.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do,\" said Hanaud, with a laugh.\n\n\"Well, after mademoiselle had been with us three weeks, she said to me\none morning when I was dressing her hair that it was a pity madame was\nalways running round the fortune-tellers, that she herself could do\nsomething much more striking and impressive, and that if only I would\nhelp her we could rescue madame from their clutches. Sir, I did not\nthink what power I was putting into Mlle. Celie's hands, or assuredly I\nwould have refused. And I did not wish to quarrel with Mlle. Celie; so\nfor once I consented, and, having once consented, I could never\nafterwards refuse, for, if I had, mademoiselle would have made some\nfine excuse about the psychic influence not being en rapport, and\nmeanwhile would have had me sent away. While if I had confessed the\ntruth to madame, she would have been so angry that I had been a party\nto tricking her that again I would have lost my place. And so the\nseances went on.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hanaud. \"I understand that your position was very\ndifficult. We shall not, I think,\" and he turned to the Commissaire\nconfidently for corroboration of his words, \"be disposed to blame you.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Commissaire. \"After all, life is not so easy.\"\n\n\"Thus, then, the seances began,\" said Hanaud, leaning forward with a\nkeen interest. \"This is a strange and curious story you are telling me,\nMlle. Vauquier. Now, how were they conducted? How did you assist? What\ndid Mlle. Celie do? Rap on the tables in the dark and rattle\ntambourines like that one with the knot of ribbons which hangs upon the\nwall of the salon?\"\n\nThere was a gentle and inviting irony in Hanaud's tone. M. Ricardo was\ndisappointed. Hanaud had after all not overlooked the tambourine.\nWithout Ricardo's reason to notice it, he had none the less observed it\nand borne it in his memory.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, the tambourines and the rapping on the table!\" cried\nHelene. \"That was nothing--oh, but nothing at all. Mademoiselle Celie\nwould make spirits appear and speak!\"\n\n\"Really! And she was never caught out! But Mlle. Celie must have been a\nremarkably clever girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, she was of an address which was surprising. Sometimes madame and I\nwere alone. Sometimes there were others, whom madame in her pride had\ninvited. For she was very proud, monsieur, that her companion could\nintroduce her to the spirits of dead people. But never was Mlle. Celie\ncaught out. She told me that for many years, even when quite a child,\nshe had travelled through England giving these exhibitions.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said Hanaud, and he turned to Wethermill. \"Did you know that?\"\nhe asked in English.\n\n\"I did not,\" he said. \"I do not now.\"\n\nHanaud shook his head.\n\n\"To me this story does not seem invented,\" he replied. And then he\nspoke again in French to Helene Vauquier. \"Well, continue,\nmademoiselle! Assume that the company is assembled for our seance.\"\n\n\"Then Mlle. Celie, dressed in a long gown of black velvet, which set\noff her white arms and shoulders well--oh, mademoiselle did not forget\nthose little trifles,\" Helene Vauquier interrupted her story, with a\nreturn of her bitterness, to interpolate--\"mademoiselle would sail into\nthe room with her velvet train flowing behind her, and perhaps for a\nlittle while she would say there was a force working against her, and\nshe would sit silent in a chair while madame gaped at her with open\neyes. At last mademoiselle would say that the powers were favourable\nand the spirits would manifest themselves to-night. Then she would be\nplaced in a cabinet, perhaps with a string tied across the door\noutside--you will understand it was my business to see after the\nstring--and the lights would be turned down, or perhaps out altogether.\nOr at other times we would sit holding hands round a table, Mlle. Celie\nbetween Mme. Dauvray and myself. But in that case the lights would be\nturned out first, and it would be really my hand which held Mme.\nDauvray's. And whether it was the cabinet or the chairs, in a moment\nmademoiselle would be creeping silently about the room in a little pair\nof soft-soled slippers without heels, which she wore so that she might\nnot be heard, and tambourines would rattle as you say, and fingers\ntouch the forehead and the neck, and strange voices would sound from\ncorners of the room, and dim apparitions would appear--the spirits of\ngreat ladies of the past, who would talk with Mme. Dauvray. Such ladies\nas Mme. de Castiglione, Marie Antoinette, Mme. de Medici--I do not\nremember all the names, and very likely I do not pronounce them\nproperly. Then the voices would cease and the lights be turned up, and\nMlle. Celie would be found in a trance just in the same place and\nattitude as she had been when the lights were turned out. Imagine,\nmessieurs, the effect of such seances upon a woman like Mme. Dauvray.\nShe was made for them. She believed in them implicitly. The words of\nthe great ladies from the past--she would remember and repeat them, and\nbe very proud that such great ladies had come back to the world merely\nto tell her--Mme. Dauvray--about their lives. She would have had\nseances all day, but Mlle. Celie pleaded that she was left exhausted at\nthe end of them. But Mlle. Celie was of an address! For instance--it\nwill seem very absurd and ridiculous to you, gentlemen, but you must\nremember what Mme. Dauvray was--for instance, madame was particularly\nanxious to speak with the spirit of Mme. de Montespan. Yes, yes! She\nhad read all the memoirs about that lady. Very likely Mlle. Celie had\nput the notion into Mme. Dauvray's head, for madame was not a scholar.\nBut she was dying to hear that famous woman's voice and to catch a dim\nglimpse of her face. Well, she was never gratified. Always she hoped.\nAlways Mlle. Celie tantalised her with the hope. But she would not\ngratify it. She would not spoil her fine affairs by making these treats\ntoo common. And she acquired--how should she not?--a power over Mme.\nDauvray which was unassailable. The fortune-tellers had no more to say\nto Mme. Dauvray. She did nothing but felicitate herself upon the happy\nchance which had sent her Mlle. Celie. And now she lies in her room\nmurdered!\"\n\nOnce more Helene's voice broke upon the words. But Hanaud poured her\nout a glass of water and held it to her lips. Helene drank it eagerly.\n\n\"There, that is better, is it not?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Helene Vauquier, recovering herself. \"Sometimes,\ntoo,\" she resumed, \"messages from the spirits would flutter down in\nwriting on the table.\"\n\n\"In writing?\" exclaimed Hanaud quickly.\n\n\"Yes; answers to questions. Mlle. Celie had them ready. Oh, but she was\nof an address altogether surprising.\n\n\"I see,\" said Hanaud slowly; and he added, \"But sometimes, I suppose,\nthe questions were questions which Mlle. Celie could not answer?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Helene Vauquier admitted, \"when visitors were present.\nWhen Mme. Dauvray was alone--well, she was an ignorant woman, and any\nanswer would serve. But it was not so when there were visitors whom\nMlle. Celie did not know, or only knew slightly. These visitors might\nbe putting questions to test her, of which they knew the answers, while\nMlle. Celie did not.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Hanaud. \"What happened then?\"\n\nAll who were listening understood to what point he was leading Helene\nVauquier. All waited intently for her answer.\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"It was all one to Mlle. Celie.\"\n\n\"She was prepared with an escape from the difficulty?\"\n\n\"Perfectly prepared.\"\n\nHanaud looked puzzled.\n\n\"I can think of no way out of it except the one,\" and he looked round\nto the Commissaire and to Ricardo as though he would inquire of them\nhow many ways they had discovered. \"I can think of no escape except\nthat a message in writing should flutter down from the spirit appealed\nto saying frankly,\" and Hanaud shrugged his shoulders, \"'I do not\nknow.'\"\n\n\"Oh no no, monsieur,\" replied Helene Vauquier in pity for Hanaud's\nmisconception, \"I see that you are not in the habit of attending\nseances. It would never do for a spirit to admit that it did not know.\nAt once its authority would be gone, and with it Mlle. Celie's as well.\nBut on the other hand, for inscrutable reasons the spirit might not be\nallowed to answer.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Hanaud, meekly accepting the correction. \"The\nspirit might reply that it was forbidden to answer, but never that it\ndid not know.\"\n\n\"No, never that,\" said Helene. So it seemed that Hanaud must look\nelsewhere for the explanation of that sentence. \"I do not know,\" Helene\ncontinued: \"Oh, Mlle. Celie--it was not easy to baffle her, I can tell\nyou. She carried a lace scarf which she could drape about her head, and\nin a moment she would be, in the dim light, an old, old woman, with a\nvoice so altered that no one could know it. Indeed, you said rightly,\nmonsieur--she was clever.\"\n\nTo all who listened Helene Vauquier's story carried its conviction.\nMme. Dauvray rose vividly before their minds as a living woman. Celie's\ntrickeries were so glibly described that they could hardly have been\ninvented, and certainly not by this poor peasant-woman whose lips so\nbravely struggled with Medici, and Montespan, and the names of the\nother great ladies. How, indeed, should she know of them at all? She\ncould never have had the inspiration to concoct the most convincing\nitem of her story--the queer craze of Mme. Dauvray for an interview\nwith Mme. de Montespan. These details were assuredly the truth.\n\nRicardo, indeed, knew them to be true. Had he not himself seen the girl\nin her black velvet dress shut up in a cabinet, and a great lady of the\npast dimly appear in the darkness? Moreover, Helene Vauquier's jealousy\nwas so natural and inevitable a thing. Her confession of it\ncorroborated all her story.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Hanaud, \"we come to last night. There was a seance\nheld in the salon last night.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" said Vauquier, shaking her head; \"there was no seance\nlast night.\"\n\n\"But already you have said--\" interrupted the Commissaire; and Hanaud\nheld up his hand.\n\n\"Let her speak, my friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur shall hear,\" said Vauquier.\n\nIt appeared that at five o'clock in the afternoon Mme. Dauvray and\nMlle. Celie prepared to leave the house on foot. It was their custom to\nwalk down at this hour to the Villa des Fleurs, pass an hour or so\nthere, dine in a restaurant, and return to the Rooms to spend the\nevening. On this occasion, however, Mme. Dauvray informed Helene that\nthey should be back early and bring with them a friend who was\ninterested in, but entirely sceptical of, spiritualistic\nmanifestations. \"But we shall convince her to-night, Celie,\" she said\nconfidently; and the two women then went out. Shortly before eight\nHelene closed the shutters both of the upstair and the downstair\nwindows and of the glass doors into the garden, and returned to the\nkitchen, which was at the back of the house--that is, on the side\nfacing the road. There had been a fall of rain at seven which had\nlasted for the greater part of the hour, and soon after she had shut\nthe windows the rain fell again in a heavy shower, and Helene, knowing\nthat madame felt the chill, lighted a small fire in the salon. The\nshower lasted until nearly nine, when it ceased altogether and the\nnight cleared up.\n\nIt was close upon half-past nine when the bell rang from the salon.\nVauquier was sure of the hour, for the charwoman called her attention\nto the clock.\n\n\"I found Mme. Dauvray, Mlle. Celie, and another woman in the salon,\"\ncontinued Helene Vauquier.\n\n\"Madame had let them in with her latchkey.\"\n\n\"Ah, the other woman!\" cried Besnard. \"Had you seen her before?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What was she like?\"\n\n\"She was sallow, with black hair and bright eyes like beads. She was\nshort and about forty-five years old, though it is difficult to judge\nof these things. I noticed her hands, for she was taking her gloves\noff, and they seemed to me to be unusually muscular for a woman.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Louis Besnard. \"That is important.\"\n\n\"Mme. Dauvray was, as she always was before a seance, in a feverish\nflutter. 'You will help Mlle. Celie to dress, Helene, and be very\nquick,' she said; and with an extraordinary longing she added, 'Perhaps\nwe shall see her to-night.' Her, you understand, was Mme. de Montespan.\"\nAnd she turned to the stranger and said, \"You will believe, Adele,\nafter to-night.\"\n\n\"Adele!\" said the Commissaire wisely. \"Then Adele was the strange\nwoman's name?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Hanaud dryly.\n\nHelene Vauquier reflected.\n\n\"I think Adele was the name,\" she said in a more doubtful tone. \"It\nsounded like Adele.\"\n\nThe irrepressible Mr. Ricardo was impelled to intervene.\n\n\"What Monsieur Hanaud means,\" he explained, with the pleasant air of a\nman happy to illuminate the dark intelligence of a child, \"is that\nAdele was probably a pseudonym.\"\n\nHanaud turned to him with a savage grin.\n\n\"Now that is sure to help her!\" he cried. \"A pseudonym! Helene Vauquier\nis sure to understand that simple and elementary word. How bright this\nM. Ricardo is! Where shall we find a new pin more bright? I ask you,\"\nand he spread out his hands in a despairing admiration.\n\nMr. Ricardo flushed red, but he answered never a word. He must endure\ngibes and humiliations like a schoolboy in a class. His one constant\nfear was lest he should be turned out of the room. The Commissaire\ndiverted wrath from him however.\n\n\"What he means by pseudonym,\" he said to Helene Vauquier, explaining\nMr. Ricardo to her as Mr. Ricardo had presumed to explain Hanaud, \"is a\nfalse name. Adele may have been, nay, probably was, a false name\nadopted by this strange woman.\"\n\n\"Adele, I think, was the name used,\" replied Helene, the doubt in her\nvoice diminishing as she searched her memory. \"I am almost sure.\"\n\n\"Well, we will call her Adele,\" said Hanaud impatiently. \"What does it\nmatter? Go on, Mademoiselle Vauquier.\"\n\n\"The lady sat upright and squarely upon the edge of a chair, with a\nsort of defiance, as though she was determined nothing should convince\nher, and she laughed incredulously.\"\n\nHere, again, all who heard were able vividly to conjure up the\nscene--the defiant sceptic sitting squarely on the edge of her chair,\nremoving her gloves from her muscular hands; the excited Mme. Dauvray,\nso absorbed in the determination to convince; and Mlle. Celie running\nfrom the room to put on the black gown which would not be visible in\nthe dim light.\n\n\"Whilst I took off mademoiselle's dress,\" Vauquier continued, \"she\nsaid: 'When I have gone down to the salon you can go to bed, Helene.\nMme. Adele'--yes, it was Adele--'will be fetched by a friend in a\nmotorcar, and I can let her out and fasten the door again. So if you\nhear the car you will know that it has come for her.'\"\n\n\"Oh, she said that!\" said Hanaud quickly.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\nHanaud looked gloomily towards Wethermill. Then he exchanged a sharp\nglance with the Commissaire, and moved his shoulders in an almost\nimperceptible shrug. But Mr. Ricardo saw it, and construed it into one\nword. He imagined a jury uttering the word \"Guilty.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier saw the movement too.\n\n\"Do not condemn her too quickly, monsieur,\" she, said, with an impulse\nof remorse. \"And not upon my words. For, as I say, I--hated her.\"\n\nHanaud nodded reassuringly, and she resumed:\n\n\"I was surprised, and I asked mademoiselle what she would do without\nher confederate. But she laughed, and said there would be no\ndifficulty. That is partly why I think there was no seance held last\nnight. Monsieur, there was a note in her voice that evening which I did\nnot as yet understand. Mademoiselle then took her bath while I laid out\nher black dress and the slippers with the soft, noiseless soles. And\nnow I tell you why I am sure there was no seance last night--why Mlle.\nCelie never meant there should be one.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us hear that,\" said Hanaud curiously, and leaning forward\nwith his hands upon his knees.\n\n\"You have here, monsieur, a description of how mademoiselle was dressed\nwhen she went away.\" Helene Vauquier picked up a sheet of paper from\nthe table at her side. \"I wrote it out at the request of M. le\nCommissaire.\" She handed the paper to Hanaud, who glanced through it as\nshe continued. \"Well, except for the white lace coat, monsieur, I\ndressed Mlle. Celie just in that way. She would have none of her plain\nblack robe. No, Mlle. Celie must wear her fine new evening frock of\npale reseda-green chiffon over soft clinging satin, which set off her\nfair beauty so prettily. It left her white arms and shoulders bare, and\nit had a long train, and it rustled as she moved. And with that she\nmust put on her pale green silk stockings, her new little satin\nslippers to match, with the large paste buckles--and a sash of green\nsatin looped through another glittering buckle at the side of the\nwaist, with long ends loosely knotted together at the knee. I must tie\nher fair hair with a silver ribbon, and pin upon her curls a large hat\nof reseda green with a golden-brown ostrich feather drooping behind. I\nwarned mademoiselle that there was a tiny fire burning in the salon.\nEven with the fire-screen in front of it there would still be a little\nlight upon the floor, and the glittering buckles on her feet would\nbetray her, even if the rustle of her dress did not. But she said she\nwould kick her slippers off. Ah, gentlemen, it is, after all, not so\nthat one dresses for a seance,\" she cried, shaking her head. \"But it is\njust so--is it not?--that one dresses to go to meet a lover.\"\n\nThe suggestion startled every one who heard it. It fairly took Mr.\nRicardo's breath away. Wethermill stepped forward with a cry of revolt.\nThe Commissaire exclaimed, admiringly, \"But here is an idea!\" Even\nHanaud sat back in his chair, though his expression lost nothing of its\nimpassivity, and his eyes never moved from Helene Vauquier's face.\n\n\"Listen!\" she continued, \"I will tell you what I think. It was my habit\nto put out some sirop and lemonade and some little cakes in the\ndining-room, which, as you know, is at the other side of the house\nacross the hall. I think it possible, messieurs, that while Mlle. Celie\nwas changing her dress Mme. Dauvray and the stranger, Adele, went into\nthe dining-room. I know that Mlle. Celie, as soon as she was dressed,\nran downstairs to the salon. Well, then, suppose Mlle. Celie had a\nlover waiting with whom she meant to run away. She hurries through the\nempty salon, opens the glass doors, and is gone, leaving the doors\nopen. And the thief, an accomplice of Adele, finds the doors open and\nhides himself in the salon until Mme. Dauvray returns from the\ndining-room. You see, that leaves Mlle. Celie innocent.\"\n\nVauquier leaned forward eagerly, her white face flushing. There was a\nmoment's silence, and then Hanaud said:\n\n\"That is all very well, Mlle. Vauquier. But it does not account for the\nlace coat in which the girl went away. She must have returned to her\nroom to fetch that after you had gone to bed.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier leaned back with an air of disappointment.\n\n\"That is true. I had forgotten the coat. I did not like Mlle. Celie,\nbut I am not wicked--\"\n\n\"Nor for the fact that the sirop and the lemonade had not been touched\nin the dining-room,\" said the Commissaire, interrupting her.\n\nAgain the disappointment overspread Vauquier's face.\n\n\"Is that so?\" she asked. \"I did not know--I have been kept a prisoner\nhere.\"\n\nThe Commissaire cut her short with a cry of satisfaction.\n\n\"Listen! listen!\" he exclaimed excitedly. \"Here is a theory which\naccounts for all, which combines Vauquier's idea with ours, and\nVauquier's idea is, I think, very just, up to a point. Suppose, M.\nHanaud, that the girl was going to meet her lover, but the lover is the\nmurderer. Then all becomes clear. She does not run away to him; she\nopens the door for him and lets him in.\"\n\nBoth Hanaud and Ricardo stole a glance at Wethermill. How did he take\nthe theory? Wethermill was leaning against the wall, his eyes closed,\nhis face white and contorted with a spasm of pain. But he had the air\nof a man silently enduring an outrage rather than struck down by the\nconviction that the woman he loved was worthless.\n\n\"It is not for me to say, monsieur,\" Helene Vauquier continued. \"I only\ntell you what I know. I am a woman, and it would be very difficult for\na girl who was eagerly expecting her lover so to act that another woman\nwould not know it. However uncultivated and ignorant the other woman\nwas, that at all events she would know. The knowledge would spread to\nher of itself, without a word. Consider, gentlemen!\" And suddenly\nHelene Vauquier smiled. \"A young girl tingling with excitement from\nhead to foot, eager that her beauty just at this moment should be more\nfresh, more sweet than ever it was, careful that her dress should set\nit exquisitely off. Imagine it! Her lips ready for the kiss! Oh, how\nshould another woman not know? I saw Mlle. Celie, her cheeks rosy, her\neyes bright. Never had she looked so lovely. The pale-green hat upon\nher fair head heavy with its curls! From head to foot she looked\nherself over, and then she sighed--she sighed with pleasure because she\nlooked so pretty. That was Mlle. Celie last night, monsieur. She\ngathered up her train, took her long white gloves in the other hand,\nand ran down the stairs, her heels clicking on the wood, her buckles\nglittering. At the bottom she turned and said to me:\n\n\"'Remember, Helene, you can go to bed.' That was it monsieur.\"\n\nAnd now violently the rancour of Helene Vauquier's feelings burst out\nonce more.\n\n\"For her the fine clothes, the pleasure, and the happiness. For me--I\ncould go to bed!\"\n\nHanaud looked again at the description which Helene Vauquier had\nwritten out, and read it through carefully. Then he asked a question,\nof which Ricardo did not quite see the drift.\n\n\"So,\" he said, \"when this morning you suggested to Monsieur the\nCommissaire that it would be advisable for you to go through Mlle.\nCelie's wardrobe, you found that nothing more had been taken away\nexcept the white lace coat?\"\n\n\"That is so.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now, after Mlle. Celie had gone down the stairs--\"\n\n\"I put the lights out in her room and, as she had ordered me to do, I\nwent to bed. The next thing that I remember--but no! It terrifies me\ntoo much to think of it.\"\n\nHelene shuddered and covered her face spasmodically with her hands.\nHanaud drew her hands gently down.\n\n\"Courage! You are safe now, mademoiselle. Calm yourself!\"\n\nShe lay back with her eyes closed.\n\n\"Yes, yes; it is true. I am safe now. But oh! I feel I shall never dare\nto sleep again!\" And the tears swam in her eyes. \"I woke up with a\nfeeling of being suffocated. Mon Dieu! There was the light burning in\nthe room, and a woman, the strange woman with the strong hands, was\nholding me down by the shoulders, while a man with his cap drawn over\nhis eyes and a little black moustache pressed over my lips a pad from\nwhich a horribly sweet and sickly taste filled my mouth. Oh, I was\nterrified! I could not scream. I struggled. The woman told me roughly\nto keep quiet. But I could not. I must struggle. And then with a\nbrutality unheard of she dragged me up on to my knees while the man\nkept the pad right over my mouth. The man, with the arm which was free,\nheld me close to him, and she bound my hands with a cord behind me.\nLook!\"\n\nShe held out her wrists. They were terribly bruised. Red and angry\nlines showed where the cord had cut deeply into her flesh.\n\n\"Then they flung me down again upon my back, and the next thing I\nremember is the doctor standing over me and this kind nurse supporting\nme.\"\n\nShe sank back exhausted in her chair and wiped her forehead with her\nhandkerchief. The sweat stood upon it in beads.\n\n\"Thank you, mademoiselle,\" said Hanaud gravely. \"This has been a trying\nordeal for you. I understand that. But we are coming to the end. I want\nyou to read this description of Mlle. Celie through again to make sure\nthat nothing is omitted.\" He gave the paper into the maid's hands. \"It\nwill be advertised, so it is important that it should be complete. See\nthat you have left out nothing.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier bent her head over the paper.\n\n\"No,\" said Helene at last. \"I do not think I have omitted anything.\"\nAnd she handed the paper back.\n\n\"I asked you,\" Hanaud continued suavely, \"because I understand that\nMlle. Celie usually wore a pair of diamond ear-drops, and they are not\nmentioned here.\"\n\nA faint colour came into the maid's face.\n\n\"That is true, monsieur. I had forgotten. It is quite true.\"\n\n\"Any one might forget,\" said Hanaud, with a reassuring smile. \"But you\nwill remember now. Think! think! Did Mlle. Celie wear them last night?\"\nHe leaned forward, waiting for her reply. Wethermill too, made a\nmovement. Both men evidently thought the point of great importance. The\nmaid looked at Hanaud for a few moments without speaking.\n\n\"It is not from me, mademoiselle, that you will get the answer,\" said\nHanaud quietly.\n\n\"No, monsieur. I was thinking,\" said the maid, her face flushing at the\nrebuke.\n\n\"Did she wear them when she went down the stairs last night?\" he\ninsisted.\n\n\"I think she wore them,\" she said doubtfully. \"Ye-es--yes,\" and the\nwords came now firm and clear. \"I remember well. Mlle. Celie had taken\nthem off before her bath, and they lay on the dressing-table. She put\nthem into her ears while I dressed her hair and arranged the bow of\nribbon in it.\"\n\n\"Then we will add the earrings to your description,\" said Hanaud, as he\nrose from his chair with the paper in his hand, \"and for the moment we\nneed not trouble you any more about Mademoiselle Celie.\" He folded the\npaper up, slipped it into his letter-case, and put it away in his\npocket. \"Let us consider that poor Madame Dauvray! Did she keep much\nmoney in the house?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; very little. She was well known in Aix and her cheques\nwere everywhere accepted without question. It was a high pleasure to\nserve madame, her credit was so good,\" said Helene Vauquier, raising\nher head as though she herself had a share in the pride of that good\ncredit.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Hanaud agreed. \"There are many fine households where the\nbanking account is overdrawn, and it cannot be pleasant for the\nservants.\"\n\n\"They are put to so many shifts to hide it from the servants of their\nneighbours,\" said Helene. \"Besides,\" and she made a little grimace of\ncontempt, \"a fine household and an overdrawn banking account--it is\nlike a ragged petticoat under a satin dress. That was never the case\nwith Madame Dauvray.\"\n\n\"So that she was under no necessity to have ready money always in her\npocket,\" said Hanaud. \"I understand that. But at times perhaps she won\nat the Villa des Fleurs?\"\n\nHelene Vauquier shook her head.\n\n\"She loved the Villa des Fleurs, but she never played for high sums and\noften never played at all. If she won a few louis, she was as delighted\nwith her gains and as afraid to lose them again at the tables as if she\nwere of the poorest, and she stopped at once. No, monsieur; twenty or\nthirty louis--there was never more than that in the house.\"\n\n\"Then it was certainly for her famous collection of jewellery that\nMadame Dauvray was murdered?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Now, where did she keep her jewellery?\"\n\n\"In a safe in her bedroom, monsieur. Every night she took off what she\nhad been wearing and locked it up with the rest. She was never too\ntired for that.\"\n\n\"And what did she do with the keys?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell you. Certainly she locked her rings and necklaces\naway whilst I undressed her. And she laid the keys upon the\ndressing-table or the mantel-shelf--anywhere. But in the morning the\nkeys were no longer where she had left them. She had put them secretly\naway.\"\n\nHanaud turned to another point.\n\n\"I suppose that Mademoiselle Celie knew of the safe and that the jewels\nwere kept there?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! Mademoiselle indeed was often in Madame Dauvray's room when\nshe was dressing or undressing. She must often have seen madame take\nthem out and lock them up again. But then, monsieur, so did I.\"\n\nHanaud nodded to her with a friendly smile.\n\n\"Thank you once more, mademoiselle,\" he said. \"The torture is over. But\nof course Monsieur Fleuriot will require your presence.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier looked anxiously towards him.\n\n\"But meanwhile I can go from this villa, monsieur?\" she pleaded, with a\ntrembling voice.\n\n\"Certainly; you shall go to your friends at once.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, thank you!\" she cried, and suddenly she gave way. The\ntears began to flow from her eyes. She buried her face in her hands and\nsobbed. \"It is foolish of me, but what would you?\" She jerked out the\nwords between her sobs. \"It has been too terrible.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Hanaud soothingly. \"The nurse will put a few things\ntogether for you in a bag. You will not leave Aix, of course, and I\nwill send some one with you to your friends.\"\n\nThe maid started violently.\n\n\"Oh, not a sergent-de-ville, monsieur, I beg of you. I should be\ndisgraced.\"\n\n\"No. It shall be a man in plain clothes, to see that you are not\nhindered by reporters on the way.\"\n\nHanaud turned towards the door. On the dressing-table a cord was lying.\nHe took it up and spoke to the nurse.\n\n\"Was this the cord with which Helene Vauquier's hands were tied?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" she replied.\n\nHanaud handed it to the Commissaire.\n\n\"It will be necessary to keep that,\" he said.\n\nIt was a thin piece of strong whipcord. It was the same kind of cord as\nthat which had been found tied round Mme. Dauvray's throat. Hanaud\nopened the door and turned back to the nurse.\n\n\"We will send for a cab for Mlle. Vauquier. You will drive with her to\nher door. I think after that she will need no further help. Pack up a\nfew things and bring them down. Mlle. Vauquier can follow, no doubt,\nnow without assistance.\" And, with a friendly nod, he left the room.\n\nRicardo had been wondering, through the examination, in what light\nHanaud considered Helene Vauquier. He was sympathetic, but the sympathy\nmight merely have been assumed to deceive. His questions betrayed in no\nparticular the colour of his mind. Now, however, he made himself clear.\nHe informed the nurse, in the plainest possible way, that she was no\nlonger to act as jailer. She was to bring Vauquier's things down; but\nVauquier could follow by herself. Evidently Helene Vauquier was cleared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA STARTLING DISCOVERY\n\n\nHarry Wethermill, however, was not so easily satisfied.\n\n\"Surely, monsieur, it would be well to know whither she is going,\" he\nsaid, \"and to make sure that when she has gone there she will stay\nthere--until we want her again?\"\n\nHanaud looked at the young man pityingly.\n\n\"I can understand, monsieur, that you hold strong views about Helene\nVauquier. You are human, like the rest of us. And what she has said to\nus just now would not make you more friendly. But--but--\" and he\npreferred to shrug his shoulders rather than to finish in words his\nsentence. \"However,\" he said, \"we shall take care to know where Helene\nVauquier is staying. Indeed, if she is at all implicated in this affair\nwe shall learn more if we leave her free than if we keep her under lock\nand key. You see that if we leave her quite free, but watch her very,\nvery carefully, so as to awaken no suspicion, she may be emboldened to\ndo something rash--or the others may.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo approved of Hanaud's reasoning.\n\n\"That is quite true,\" he said. \"She might write a letter.\"\n\n\"Yes, or receive one,\" added Hanaud, \"which would be still more\nsatisfactory for us--supposing, of course, that she has anything to do\nwith this affair\"; and again he shrugged his shoulders. He turned\ntowards the Commissaire.\n\n\"You have a discreet officer whom you can trust?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly. A dozen.\"\n\n\"I want only one.\"\n\n\"And here he is,\" said the Commissaire.\n\nThey were descending the stairs. On the landing of the first floor\nDurette, the man who had discovered where the cord was bought, was\nstill waiting. Hanaud took Durette by the sleeve in the familiar way\nwhich he so commonly used and led him to the top of the stairs, where\nthe two men stood for a few moments apart. It was plain that Hanaud was\ngiving, Durette receiving, definite instructions. Durette descended the\nstairs; Hanaud came back to the others.\n\n\"I have told him to fetch a cab,\" he said, \"and convey Helene Vauquier\nto her friends.\" Then he looked at Ricardo, and from Ricardo to the\nCommissaire, while he rubbed his hand backwards and forwards across his\nshaven chin.\n\n\"I tell you,\" he said, \"I find this sinister little drama very\ninteresting to me. The sordid, miserable struggle for mastery in this\nhousehold of Mme. Dauvray--eh? Yes, very interesting. Just as much\npatience, just as much effort, just as much planning for this small end\nas a general uses to defeat an army--and, at the last, nothing gained.\nWhat else is politics? Yes, very interesting.\"\n\nHis eyes rested upon Wethermill's face for a moment, but they gave the\nyoung man no hope. He took a key from his pocket.\n\n\"We need not keep this room locked,\" he said. \"We know all that there\nis to be known.\" And he inserted the key into the lock of Celia's room\nand turned it.\n\n\"But is that wise, monsieur?\" said Besnard.\n\nHanaud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked.\n\n\"The case is in your hands,\" said the Commissaire. To Ricardo the\nproceedings seemed singularly irregular. But if the Commissaire was\ncontent, it was not for him to object.\n\n\"And where is my excellent friend Perrichet?\" asked Hanaud; and leaning\nover the balustrade he called him up from the hall.\n\n\"We will now,\" said Hanaud, \"have a glance into this poor murdered\nwoman's room.\"\n\nThe room was opposite to Celia's. Besnard produced the key and unlocked\nthe door. Hanaud took off his hat upon the threshold and then passed\ninto the room with his companions. Upon the bed, outlined under a\nsheet, lay the rigid form of Mme. Dauvray. Hanaud stepped gently to the\nbedside and reverently uncovered the face. For a moment all could see\nit--livid, swollen, unhuman.\n\n\"A brutal business,\" he said in a low voice, and when he turned again\nto his companions his face was white and sickly. He replaced the sheet\nand gazed about the room.\n\nIt was decorated and furnished in the same style as the salon\ndownstairs, yet the contrast between the two rooms was remarkable.\n\nDownstairs, in the salon, only a chair had been overturned. Here there\nwas every sign of violence and disorder. An empty safe stood open in\none corner; the rugs upon the polished floor had been tossed aside;\nevery drawer had been torn open, every wardrobe burst; the very bed had\nbeen moved from its position.\n\n\"It was in this safe that Madame Dauvray hid her jewels each night,\"\nsaid the Commissaire as Hanaud gazed about the room.\n\n\"Oh, was it so?\" Hanaud asked slowly. It seemed to Ricardo that he read\nsomething in the aspect of this room too, which troubled his mind and\nincreased his perplexity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Besnard confidently. \"Every night Mme. Dauvray locked her\njewels away in this safe. Vauquier told us so this morning. Every night\nshe was never too tired for that. Besides, here\"--and putting his hand\ninto the safe he drew out a paper--\"here is the list of Mme. Dauvray's\njewellery.\"\n\nPlainly, however, Hanaud was not satisfied. He took the list and\nglanced through the items. But his thoughts were not concerned with it.\n\n\"If that is so,\" he said slowly, \"Mme. Dauvray kept her jewels in this\nsafe, why has every drawer been ransacked, why was the bed moved?\nPerrichet, lock the door--quietly--from the inside. That is right. Now\nlean your back against it.\"\n\nHanaud waited until he saw Perrichet's broad back against the door.\nThen he went down upon his knees, and, tossing the rugs here and there,\nexamined with the minutest care the inlaid floor. By the side of the\nbed a Persian mat of blue silk was spread. This in its turn he moved\nquickly aside. He bent his eyes to the ground, lay prone, moved this\nway and that to catch the light upon the floor, then with a spring he\nrose upon his knees. He lifted his finger to his lips. In a dead\nsilence he drew a pen-knife quickly from his pocket and opened it. He\nbent down again and inserted the blade between the cracks of the\nblocks. The three men in the room watched him with an intense\nexcitement. A block of wood rose from the floor, he pulled it out, laid\nit noiselessly down, and inserted his hand into the opening.\n\nWethermill at Ricardo's elbow uttered a stifled cry. \"Hush!\" whispered\nHanaud angrily. He drew out his hand again. It was holding a green\nleather jewel-case. He opened it, and a diamond necklace flashed its\nthousand colours in their faces. He thrust in his hand again and again\nand again, and each time that he withdrew it, it held a jewel-case.\nBefore the astonished eyes of his companions he opened them. Ropes of\npearls, collars of diamonds, necklaces of emeralds, rings of\npigeon-blood rubies, bracelets of gold studded with opals--Mme.\nDauvray's various jewellery was disclosed.\n\n\"But that is astounding,\" said Besnard, in an awe-struck voice.\n\n\"Then she was never robbed after all?\" cried Ricardo.\n\nHanaud rose to his feet.\n\n\"What a piece of irony!\" he whispered. \"The poor woman is murdered for\nher jewels, the room's turned upside down, and nothing is found. For\nall the while they lay safe in this cache. Nothing is taken except what\nshe wore. Let us see what she wore.\"\n\n\"Only a few rings, Helene Vauquier thought,\" said Besnard. \"But she was\nnot sure.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Hanaud. \"Well, let us make sure!\" and, taking the list from\nthe safe, he compared it with the jewellery in the cases on the floor,\nticking off the items one by one. When he had finished he knelt down\nagain, and, thrusting his hand into the hole, felt carefully about.\n\n\"There is a pearl necklace missing,\" he said. \"A valuable necklace,\nfrom the description in the list and some rings. She must have been\nwearing them;\" and he sat back upon his heels. \"We will send the\nintelligent Perrichet for a bag,\" he said, \"and we will counsel the\nintelligent Perrichet not to breathe a word to any living soul of what\nhe has seen in this room. Then we will seal up in the bag the jewels,\nand we will hand it over to M. le Commissaire, who will convey it with\nthe greatest secrecy out of this villa. For the list--I will keep it,\"\nand he placed it carefully in his pocket-book.\n\nHe unlocked the door and went out himself on to the landing. He looked\ndown the stairs and up the stairs; then he beckoned Perrichet to him.\n\n\"Go!\" he whispered. \"Be quick, and when you come back hide the bag\ncarefully under your coat.\"\n\nPerrichet went down the stairs with pride written upon his face. Was he\nnot assisting the great M. Hanaud from the Surete in Paris? Hanaud\nreturned into Mme. Dauvray's room and closed the door. He looked into\nthe eyes of his companions.\n\n\"Can't you see the scene?\" he asked with a queer smile of excitement.\nHe had forgotten Wethermill; he had forgotten even the dead woman\nshrouded beneath the sheet. He was absorbed. His eyes were bright, his\nwhole face vivid with life. Ricardo saw the real man at this\nmoment--and feared for the happiness of Harry Wethermill. For nothing\nwould Hanaud now turn aside until he had reached the truth and set his\nhands upon the quarry. Of that Ricardo felt sure. He was trying now to\nmake his companions visualise just what he saw and understood.\n\n\"Can't you see it? The old woman locking up her jewels in this safe\nevery night before the eyes of her maid or her companion, and then, as\nsoon as she was alone, taking them stealthily out of the safe and\nhiding them in this secret place. But I tell you--this is human. Yes,\nit is interesting just because it is so human. Then picture to\nyourselves last night, the murderers opening this safe and finding\nnothing--oh, but nothing!--and ransacking the room in deadly haste,\nkicking up the rugs, forcing open the drawers, and always finding\nnothing--nothing--nothing. Think of their rage, their stupefaction, and\nfinally their fear! They must go, and with one pearl necklace, when\nthey had hoped to reap a great fortune. Oh, but this is\ninteresting--yes, I tell you--I, who have seen many strange\nthings--this is interesting.\"\n\nPerrichet returned with a canvas bag, into which Hanaud placed the\njewel-cases. He sealed the bag in the presence of the four men and\nhanded it to Besnard. He replaced the block of wood in the floor,\ncovered it over again with the rug, and rose to his feet.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said, in a low voice, and with a gravity which impressed\nthem all. \"There is something in this house which I do not understand.\nI have told you so. I tell you something more now. I am afraid--I am\nafraid.\" And the word startled his hearers like a thunderclap, though\nit was breathed no louder than a whisper, \"Yes, my friends,\" he\nrepeated, nodding his head, \"terribly afraid.\" And upon the others fell\na discomfort, an awe, as though something sinister and dangerous were\npresent in the room and close to them. So vivid was the feeling,\ninstinctively they drew nearer together. \"Now, I warn you solemnly.\nThere must be no whisper that these jewels have been discovered; no\nnewspaper must publish a hint of it; no one must suspect that here in\nthis room we have found them. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the Commissaire.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"To be sure, monsieur,\" said Perrichet.\n\nAs for Harry Wethermill, he made no reply. His burning eyes were fixed\nupon Hanaud's face, and that was all. Hanaud, for his part, asked for\nno reply from him. Indeed, he did not look towards Harry Wethermill's\nface at all. Ricardo understood. Hanaud did not mean to be deterred by\nthe suffering written there.\n\nHe went down again into the little gay salon lit with flowers and\nAugust sunlight, and stood beside the couch gazing at it with troubled\neyes. And, as he gazed, he closed his eyes and shivered. He shivered\nlike a man who has taken a sudden chill. Nothing in all this morning's\ninvestigations, not even the rigid body beneath the sheet, nor the\nstrange discovery of the jewels, had so impressed Ricardo. For there he\nhad been confronted with facts, definite and complete; here was a\nsuggestion of unknown horrors, a hint, not a fact, compelling the\nimagination to dark conjecture. Hanaud shivered. That he had no idea\nwhy Hanaud shivered made the action still more significant, still more\nalarming. And it was not Ricardo alone who was moved by it. A voice of\ndespair rang through the room. The voice was Harry Wethermill's, and\nhis face was ashy white.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" he cried, \"I do not know what makes you shudder; but I am\nremembering a few words you used this morning.\"\n\nHanaud turned upon his heel. His face was drawn and grey and his eyes\nblazed.\n\n\"My friend, I also am remembering those words,\" he said. Thus the two\nmen stood confronting one another, eye to eye, with awe and fear in\nboth their faces.\n\nRicardo was wondering to what words they both referred, when the sound\nof wheels broke in upon the silence. The effect upon Hanaud was\nmagical. He thrust his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"Helene Vauquier's cab,\" he said lightly. He drew out his\ncigarette-case and lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Let us see that poor woman safely off. It is a closed cab I hope.\"\n\nIt was a closed landau. It drove past the open door of the salon to the\nfront door of the house. In Hanaud's wake they all went out into the\nhall. The nurse came down alone carrying Helene Vauquier's bag. She\nplaced it in the cab and waited in the doorway.\n\n\"Perhaps Helene Vauquier has fainted,\" she said anxiously: \"she does\nnot come.\" And she moved towards the stairs.\n\nHanaud took a singularly swift step forward and stopped her.\n\n\"Why should you think that?\" he asked, with a queer smile upon his\nface, and as he spoke a door closed gently upstairs. \"See,\" he\ncontinued, \"you are wrong: she is coming.\"\n\nRicardo was puzzled. It had seemed to him that the door which had\nclosed so gently was nearer than Helene Vauquier's door. It seemed to\nhim that the door was upon the first, not the second landing. But\nHanaud had noticed nothing strange; so it could not be. He greeted\nHelene Vauquier with a smile as she came down the stairs.\n\n\"You are better, mademoiselle,\" he said politely. \"One can see that.\nThere is more colour in your cheeks. A day or two, and you will be\nyourself again.\"\n\nHe held the door open while she got into the cab. The nurse took her\nseat beside her; Durette mounted on the box. The cab turned and went\ndown the drive.\n\n\"Goodbye, mademoiselle,\" cried Hanaud, and he watched until the high\nshrubs hid the cab from his eyes. Then he behaved in an extraordinary\nway. He turned and sprang like lightning up the stairs. His agility\namazed Ricardo. The others followed upon his heels. He flung himself at\nCelia's door and opened it He burst into the room, stood for a second,\nthen ran to the window. He hid behind the curtain, looking out. With\nhis hand he waved to his companions to keep back. The sound of wheels\ncreaking and rasping rose to their ears. The cab had just come out into\nthe road. Durette upon the box turned and looked towards the house.\nJust for a moment Hanaud leaned from the window, as Besnard, the\nCommissaire, had done, and, like Besnard again, he waved his hand. Then\nhe came back into the room and saw, standing in front of him, with his\nmouth open and his eyes starting out of his head, Perrichet--the\nintelligent Perrichet.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" cried Perrichet, \"something has been taken from this room.\"\n\nHanaud looked round the room and shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"But yes, monsieur,\" Perrichet insisted. \"Oh, but yes. See! Upon this\ndressing-table there was a small pot of cold cream. It stood here,\nwhere my finger is, when we were in this room an hour ago. Now it is\ngone.\"\n\nHanaud burst into a laugh.\n\n\"My friend Perrichet,\" he said ironically, \"I will tell you the\nnewspaper did not do you justice. You are more intelligent. The truth,\nmy excellent friend, lies at the bottom of a well; but you would find\nit at the bottom of a pot of cold cream. Now let us go. For in this\nhouse, gentlemen, we have nothing more to do.\"\n\nHe passed out of the room. Perrichet stood aside, his face crimson, his\nattitude one of shame. He had been rebuked by the great M. Hanaud, and\njustly rebuked. He knew it now. He had wished to display his\nintelligence--yes, at all costs he must show how intelligent he was.\nAnd he had shown himself a fool. He should have kept silence about that\npot of cream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP\n\n\nHanaud walked away from the Villa Rose in the company of Wethermill and\nRicardo.\n\n\"We will go and lunch,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes; come to my hotel,\" said Harry Wethermill. But Hanaud shook his\nhead.\n\n\"No; come with me to the Villa des Fleurs,\" he replied. \"We may learn\nsomething there; and in a case like this every minute is of importance.\nWe have to be quick.\"\n\n\"I may come too?\" cried Mr. Ricardo eagerly.\n\n\"By all means,\" replied Hanaud, with a smile of extreme courtesy.\n\"Nothing could be more delicious than monsieur's suggestions\"; and with\nthat remark he walked on silently.\n\nMr. Ricardo was in a little doubt as to the exact significance of the\nwords. But he was too excited to dwell long upon them. Distressed\nthough he sought to be at his friend's grief, he could not but assume\nan air of importance. All the artist in him rose joyfully to the\noccasion. He looked upon himself from the outside. He fancied without\nthe slightest justification that people were pointing him out. \"That\nman has been present at the investigation at the Villa Rose,\" he seemed\nto hear people say. \"What strange things he could tell us if he would!\"\n\nAnd suddenly, Mr. Ricardo began to reflect. What, after all, could he\nhave told them?\n\nAnd that question he turned over in his mind while he ate his luncheon.\nHanaud wrote a letter between the courses. They were sitting at a\ncorner table, and Hanaud was in the corner with his back to the wall.\nHe moved his plate, too, over the letter as he wrote it. It would have\nbeen impossible for either of his guests to see what he had written,\neven if they had wished. Ricardo, indeed, did wish. He rather resented\nthe secrecy with which the detective, under a show of openness,\nshrouded his thoughts and acts. Hanaud sent the waiter out to fetch an\nofficer in plain clothes, who was in attendance at the door, and he\nhanded the letter to this man. Then he turned with an apology to his\nguests.\n\n\"It is necessary that we should find out,\" he explained, \"as soon as\npossible, the whole record of Mlle. Celie.\"\n\nHe lighted a cigar, and over the coffee he put a question to Ricardo.\n\n\"Now tell me what you make of the case. What M. Wethermill thinks--that\nis clear, is it not? Helene Vauquier is the guilty one. But you, M.\nRicardo? What is your opinion?\"\n\nRicardo took from his pocket-book a sheet of paper and from his pocket\na pencil. He was intensely flattered by the request of Hanaud, and he\nproposed to do himself justice. \"I will make a note here of what I\nthink the salient features of the mystery\"; and he proceeded to\ntabulate the points in the following way:\n\n(1) Celia Harland made her entrance into Mme. Dauvray's household under\nvery doubtful circumstances.\n\n(2) By methods still more doubtful she acquired an extraordinary\nascendency over Mme. Dauvray's mind.\n\n(3) If proof were needed how complete that ascendency was, a glance at\nCelia Harland's wardrobe would suffice; for she wore the most expensive\nclothes.\n\n(4) It was Celia Harland who arranged that Servettaz, the chauffeur,\nshould be absent at Chambery on the Tuesday night--the night of the\nmurder.\n\n(5) It was Celia Harland who bought the cord with which Mme. Dauvray\nwas strangled and Helene Vauquier bound.\n\n(6) The footsteps outside the salon show that Celia Harland ran from\nthe salon to the motor-car.\n\n(7) Celia Harland pretended that there should be a seance on the\nTuesday, but she dressed as though she had in view an appointment with\na lover, instead of a spiritualistic seance.\n\n(8) Celia Harland has disappeared.\n\nThese eight points are strongly suggestive of Celia Harland's\ncomplicity in the murder. But I have no clue which will enable me to\nanswer the following questions:\n\n(a) Who was the man who took part in the crime? (b) Who was the woman\nwho came to the villa on the evening of the murder with Mme. Dauvray\nand Celia Harland?\n\n(c) What actually happened in the salon? How was the murder committed?\n\n(d) Is Helene Vauquier's story true?\n\n(e) What did the torn-up scrap of writing mean? (Probably spirit\nwriting in Celia Harland's hand.)\n\n(f) Why has one cushion on the settee a small, fresh, brown stain,\nwhich is probably blood? Why is the other cushion torn?\n\nMr. Ricardo had a momentary thought of putting down yet another\nquestion. He was inclined to ask whether or no a pot of cold cream had\ndisappeared from Celia Harland's bedroom; but he remembered that Hanaud\nhad set no store upon that incident, and he refrained. Moreover, he had\ncome to the end of his sheet of paper. He handed it across the table to\nHanaud and leaned back in his chair, watching the detective with all\nthe eagerness of a young author submitting his first effort to a critic.\n\nHanaud read it through slowly. At the end he nodded his head in\napproval.\n\n\"Now we will see what M. Wethermill has to say,\" he said, and he\nstretched out the paper towards Harry Wethermill, who throughout the\nluncheon had not said a word.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Ricardo.\n\nBut Harry Wethermill already held the written sheet in his hand. He\nsmiled rather wistfully at his friend.\n\n\"It is best that I should know just what you both think,\" he said, and\nin his turn he began to read the paper through. He read the first eight\npoints, and then beat with his fist upon the table.\n\n\"No no,\" he cried; \"it is not possible! I don't blame you, Ricardo.\nThese are facts, and, as I said, I can face facts. But there will be an\nexplanation--if only we can discover it.\"\n\nHe buried his face for a moment in his hands. Then he took up the paper\nagain.\n\n\"As for the rest, Helene Vauquier lied,\" he cried violently, and he\ntossed the paper to Hanaud. \"What do you make of it?\"\n\nHanaud smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"Did you ever go for a voyage on a ship?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes; why?\"\n\n\"Because every day at noon three officers take an observation to\ndetermine the ship's position--the captain, the first officer, and the\nsecond officer. Each writes his observation down, and the captain takes\nthe three observations and compares them. If the first or second\nofficer is out in his reckoning, the captain tells him so, but he does\nnot show his own. For at times, no doubt, he is wrong too. So,\ngentlemen, I criticise your observations, but I do not show you mine.\"\n\nHe took up Ricardo's paper and read it through again.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said pleasantly. \"But the two questions which are most\nimportant, which alone can lead us to the truth--how do they come to be\nomitted from your list, Mr. Ricardo?\"\n\nHanaud put the question with his most serious air. But Ricardo was none\nthe less sensible of the raillery behind the solemn manner. He flushed\nand made no answer.\n\n\"Still,\" continued Hanaud, \"here are undoubtedly some questions. Let us\nconsider them! Who was the man who took a part in the crime? Ah, if we\nonly knew that, what a lot of trouble we should save ourselves! Who was\nthe woman? What a good thing it would be to know that too! How clearly,\nafter all, Mr. Ricardo puts his finger on the important points! What\ndid actually happen in the salon?\" And as he quoted that question the\nraillery died out of his voice. He leaned his elbows on the table and\nbent forward.\n\n\"What did actually happen in that little pretty room, just twelve hours\nago?\" he repeated. \"When no sunlight blazed upon the lawn, and all the\nbirds were still, and all the windows shuttered and the world dark,\nwhat happened? What dreadful things happened? We have not much to go\nupon. Let us formulate what we know. We start with this. The murder was\nnot the work of a moment. It was planned with great care and cunning,\nand carried out to the letter of the plan. There must be no noise, no\nviolence. On each side of the Villa Rose there are other villas; a few\nyards away the road runs past. A scream, a cry, the noise of a\nstruggle--these sounds, or any one of them, might be fatal to success.\nThus the crime was planned; and there WAS no scream, there WAS no\nstruggle. Not a chair was broken, and only a chair upset. Yes, there\nwere brains behind that murder. We know that. But what do we know of\nthe plan? How far can we build it up? Let us see. First, there was an\naccomplice in the house--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Harry Wethermill.\n\nHanaud took no notice of the interruption.\n\n\"Secondly the woman came to the house with Mme. Dauvray and Mlle. Celie\nbetween nine and half-past nine. Thirdly, the man came afterwards, but\nbefore eleven, set open the gate, and was admitted into the salon,\nunperceived by Mme. Dauvray. That also we can safely assume. But what\nhappened in the salon? Ah! There is the question.\" Then he shrugged his\nshoulders and said with the note of raillery once more in his voice:\n\n\"But why should we trouble our heads to puzzle out this mystery, since\nM. Ricardo knows?\"\n\n\"I?\" cried Ricardo in amazement.\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied Hanaud calmly. \"For I look at another of your\nquestions. 'WHAT DID THE TORN-UP SCRAP OF WRITING MEAN?' and you add:\n'Probably spirit-writing.' Then there was a seance held last night in\nthe little salon! Is that so?\"\n\nHarry Wethermill started. Mr. Ricardo was at a loss.\n\n\"I had not followed my suggestion to its conclusion,\" he admitted\nhumbly.\n\n\"No,\" said Hanaud. \"But I ask myself in sober earnest, 'Was there a\nseance held in the salon last night?' Did the tambourine rattle in the\ndarkness on the wall?\"\n\n\"But if Helene Vauquier's story is all untrue?\" cried Wethermill, again\nin exasperation.\n\n\"Patience, my friend. Her story was not all untrue. I say there were\nbrains behind this crime; yes, but brains, even the cleverest, would\nnot have invented this queer, strange story of the seances and of Mme.\nde Montespan. That is truth. But yet, if there were a seance held, if\nthe scrap of paper were spirit-writing in answer to some awkward\nquestion, why--and here I come to my first question, which M. Ricardo\nhas omitted--why did Mlle. Celie dress herself with so much elegance\nlast night? What Vauquier said is true. Her dress was not suited to a\nseance. A light-coloured, rustling frock, which would be visible in a\ndim light, or even in the dark, which would certainly be heard at every\nmovement she made, however lightly she stepped, and a big hat--no no! I\ntell you, gentlemen, we shall not get to the bottom of this mystery\nuntil we know why Mlle. Celie dressed herself as she did last night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ricardo admitted. \"I overlooked that point.\" \"Did she--\" Hanaud\nbroke off and bowed to Wethermill with a grace and a respect which\ncondoned his words. \"You must bear with me, my young friend, while I\nconsider all these points. Did she expect to join that night a lover--a\nman with the brains to devise this crime? But if so--and here I come to\nthe second question omitted from M. Ricardo's list--why, on the patch\nof grass outside the door of the salon, were the footsteps of the man\nand woman so carefully erased, and the footsteps of Mlle. Celie--those\nlittle footsteps so easily identified--left for all the world to see\nand recognise?\"\n\nRicardo felt like a child in the presence of his schoolmaster. He was\nconvicted of presumption. He had set down his questions with the belief\nthat they covered the ground. And here were two of the utmost\nimportance, not forgotten, but never even thought of.\n\n\"Did she go, before the murder, to join a lover? Or after it? At some\ntime, you will remember, according to Vauquier's story, she must have\nrun upstairs to fetch her coat. Was the murder committed during the\ninterval when she was upstairs? Was the salon dark when she came down\nagain? Did she run through it quickly, eagerly, noticing nothing amiss?\nAnd, indeed, how should she notice anything if the salon were dark, and\nMme. Dauvray's body lay under the windows at the side?\"\n\nRicardo leaned forward eagerly.\n\n\"That must be the truth,\" he cried; and Wethermill's voice broke\nhastily in:\n\n\"It is not the truth and I will tell you why. Celia Harland was to have\nmarried me this week.\"\n\nThere was so much pain and misery in his voice that Ricardo was moved\nas he had seldom been. Wethermill buried his face in his hands. Hanaud\nshook his head and gazed across the table at Ricardo with an expression\nwhich the latter was at no loss to understand. Lovers were\nimpracticable people. But he--Hanaud--he knew the world. Women had\nfooled men before to-day.\n\nWethermill snatched his hands away from before his face.\n\n\"We talk theories,\" he cried desperately, \"of what may have happened at\nthe villa. But we are not by one inch nearer to the man and woman who\ncommitted the crime. It is for them we have to search.\"\n\n\"Yes; but except by asking ourselves questions, how shall we find them,\nM. Wethermill?\" said Hanaud. \"Take the man! We know nothing of him. He\nhas left no trace. Look at this town of Aix, where people come and go\nlike a crowd about the baccarat-table! He may be at Marseilles to-day.\nHe may be in this very room where we are taking our luncheon. How shall\nwe find him?\"\n\nWethermill nodded his head in a despairing assent.\n\n\"I know. But it is so hard to sit still and do nothing,\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, but we are not sitting still,\" said Hanaud; and Wethermill looked\nup with a sudden interest. \"All the time that we have been lunching\nhere the intelligent Perrichet has been making inquiries. Mme. Dauvray\nand Mlle. Celie left the Villa Rose at five, and returned on foot soon\nafter nine with the strange woman. And there I see Perrichet himself\nwaiting to be summoned.\"\n\nHanaud beckoned towards the sergent-de-ville.\n\n\"Perrichet will make an excellent detective,\" he said; \"for he looks\nmore bovine and foolish in plain clothes than he does in uniform.\"\n\nPerrichet advanced in his mufti to the table.\n\n\"Speak, my friend,\" said Hanaud.\n\n\"I went to the shop of M. Corval. Mlle. Celie was quite alone when she\nbought the cord. But a few minutes later, in the Rue du Casino, she and\nMme. Dauvray were seen together, walking slowly in the direction of the\nvilla. No other woman was with them.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said Hanaud quietly, and with a gesture he dismissed\nPerrichet.\n\n\"You see, we shall find out nothing--nothing,\" said Wethermill, with a\ngroan.\n\n\"We must not yet lose heart, for we know a little more about the woman\nthan we do about the man,\" said Hanaud consolingly.\n\n\"True,\" exclaimed Ricardo. \"We have Helene Vauquier's description of\nher. We must advertise it.\"\n\nHanaud smiled.\n\n\"But that is a fine suggestion,\" he cried. \"We must think over that,\"\nand he clapped his hand to his forehead with a gesture of\nself-reproach. \"Why did not such a fine idea occur to me, fool that I\nam! However, we will call the head waiter.\"\n\nThe head waiter was sent for and appeared before them.\n\n\"You knew Mme. Dauvray?\" Hanaud asked.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur--oh, the poor woman! And he flung up his hands.\n\n\"And you knew her young companion?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, monsieur. They generally had their meals here. See, at that\nlittle table over there! I kept it for them. But monsieur knows\nwell\"--and the waiter looked towards Harry Wethermill--\"for monsieur\nwas often with them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hanaud. \"Did Mme. Dauvray dine at that little table last\nnight?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. She was not here last night.\"\n\n\"Nor Mlle. Celie?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur! I do not think they were in the Villa des Fleurs at all.\"\n\n\"We know they were not,\" exclaimed Ricardo. \"Wethermill and I were in\nthe rooms and we did not see them.\"\n\n\"But perhaps you left early,\" objected Hanaud.\n\n\"No,\" said Ricardo. \"It was just ten o'clock when we reached the\nMajestic.\"\n\n\"You reached your hotel at ten,\" Hanaud repeated. \"Did you walk\nstraight from here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you left here about a quarter to ten. And we know that Mme.\nDauvray was back at the villa soon after nine. Yes--they could not have\nbeen here last night,\" Hanaud agreed, and sat for a moment silent. Then\nhe turned to the head waiter.\n\n\"Have you noticed any woman with Mme. Dauvray and her companion lately?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Think! A woman, for instance, with red hair.\"\n\nHarry Wethermill started forward. Mr. Ricardo stared at Hanaud in\namazement. The waiter reflected.\n\n\"No, monsieur. I have seen no woman with red hair.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Hanaud, and the waiter moved away.\n\n\"A woman with red hair!\" cried Wethermill. \"But Helene Vauquier\ndescribed her. She was sallow; her eyes, her hair, were dark.\"\n\nHanaud turned with a smile to Harry Wethermill.\n\n\"Did Helene Vauquier, then, speak the truth?\" he asked. \"No; the woman\nwho was in the salon last night, who returned home with Mme. Dauvray\nand Mlle. Celie, was not a woman with black hair and bright black eyes.\nLook!\" And, fetching his pocket-book from his pocket, he unfolded a\nsheet of paper and showed them, lying upon its white surface a long red\nhair.\n\n\"I picked that up on the table--the round satinwood table in the salon.\nIt was easy not to see it, but I did see it. Now, that is not Mlle.\nCelie's hair, which is fair; nor Mme. Dauvray's, which is dyed brown;\nnor Helene Vauquier's, which is black; nor the charwoman's, which, as I\nhave taken the trouble to find out, is grey. It is therefore from the\nhead of our unknown woman. And I will tell you more. This woman with\nthe red hair--she is in Geneva.\"\n\nA startled exclamation burst from Ricardo. Harry Wethermill sat slowly\ndown. For the first time that day there had come some colour into his\ncheeks, a sparkle into his eye.\n\n\"But that is wonderful!\" he cried. \"How did you find that out?\"\n\nHanaud leaned back in his chair and took a pull at his cigar. He was\nobviously pleased with Wethermill's admiration.\n\n\"Yes, how did you find it out?\" Ricardo repeated.\n\nHanaud smiled.\n\n\"As to that,\" he said, \"remember I am the captain of the ship, and I do\nnot show you my observation.\" Ricardo was disappointed. Harry\nWethermill, however, started to his feet.\n\n\"We must search Geneva, then,\" he cried. \"It is there that we should\nbe, not here drinking our coffee at the Villa des Fleurs.\"\n\nHanaud raised his hand.\n\n\"The search is not being overlooked. But Geneva is a big city. It is\nnot easy to search Geneva and find, when we know nothing about the\nwoman for whom we are searching, except that her hair is red, and that\nprobably a young girl last night was with her. It is rather here, I\nthink--in Aix--that we must keep our eyes wide open.\"\n\n\"Here!\" cried Wethermill in exasperation. He stared at Hanaud as though\nhe were mad.\n\n\"Yes, here; at the post office--at the telephone exchange. Suppose that\nthe man is in Aix, as he may well be; some time he will wish to send a\nletter, or a telegram, or a message over the telephone. That, I tell\nyou, is our chance. But here is news for us.\"\n\nHanaud pointed to a messenger who was walking towards them. The man\nhanded Hanaud an envelope.\n\n\"From M. le Commissaire,\" he said; and he saluted and retired. \"From M.\nle Commissaire?\" cried Ricardo excitedly.\n\nBut before Hanaud could open the envelope Harry Wethermill laid a hand\nupon his sleeve.\n\n\"Before we pass to something new, M. Hanaud,\" he said, \"I should be\nvery glad if you would tell me what made you shiver in the salon this\nmorning. It has distressed me ever since. What was it that those two\ncushions had to tell you?\"\n\nThere was a note of anguish in his voice difficult to resist. But\nHanaud resisted it. He shook his head.\n\n\"Again,\" he said gravely, \"I am to remind you that I am captain of the\nship and do not show my observation.\"\n\nHe tore open the envelope and sprang up from his seat.\n\n\"Mme. Dauvray's motor-car has been found,\" he cried. \"Let us go!\"\n\nHanaud called for the bill and paid it. The three men left the Villa\ndes Fleurs together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMME. DAUVRAY'S MOTOR-CAR\n\n\nThey got into a cab outside the door. Perrichet mounted the box, and\nthe cab was driven along the upward-winding road past the Hotel\nBernascon. A hundred yards beyond the hotel the cab stopped opposite to\na villa. A hedge separated the garden of the villa from the road, and\nabove the hedge rose a board with the words \"To Let\" upon it. At the\ngate a gendarme was standing, and just within the gate Ricardo saw\nLouis Besnard, the Commissaire, and Servettaz, Mme. Dauvray's chauffeur.\n\n\"It is here,\" said Besnard, as the party descended from the cab, \"in\nthe coach-house of this empty villa.\"\n\n\"Here?\" cried Ricardo in amazement.\n\nThe discovery upset all his theories. He had expected to hear that it\nhad been found fifty leagues away; but here, within a couple of miles\nof the Villa Rose itself--the idea seemed absurd! Why take it away at\nall--unless it was taken away as a blind? That supposition found its\nway into Ricardo's mind, and gathered strength as he thought upon it;\nfor Hanaud had seemed to lean to the belief that one of the murderers\nmight be still in Aix. Indeed, a glance at him showed that he was not\ndiscomposed by their discovery.\n\n\"When was it found?\" Hanaud asked.\n\n\"This morning. A gardener comes to the villa on two days a week to keep\nthe grounds in order. Fortunately Wednesday is one of his days.\nFortunately, too, there was rain yesterday evening. He noticed the\ntracks of the wheels which you can see on the gravel, and since the\nvilla is empty he was surprised. He found the coach-house door forced\nand the motor-car inside it. When he went to his luncheon he brought\nthe news of his discovery to the depot.\"\n\nThe party followed the Commissaire along the drive to the coach-house.\n\n\"We will have the car brought out,\" said Hanaud to Servettaz.\n\nIt was a big and powerful machine with a limousine body, luxuriously\nfitted and cushioned in the shade of light grey. The outside panels of\nthe car were painted a dark grey. The car had hardly been brought out\ninto the sunlight before a cry of stupefaction burst from the lips of\nPerrichet.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried, in utter abasement. \"I shall never forgive\nmyself--never, never!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Hanaud asked, turning sharply as he spoke.\n\nPerrichet was standing with his round eyes staring and his mouth agape.\n\n\"Because, monsieur, I saw that car--at four o'clock this morning--at\nthe corner of the road--not fifty yards from the Villa Rose.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Ricardo.\n\n\"You saw it!\" exclaimed Wethermill.\n\nUpon their faces was reflected now the stupefaction of Perrichet.\n\n\"But you must have made a mistake,\" said the Commissaire.\n\n\"No, no, monsieur,\" Perrichet insisted. \"It was that car. It was that\nnumber. It was just after daylight. I was standing outside the gate of\nthe villa on duty where M. le Commissaire had placed me. The car\nappeared at the corner and slackened speed. It seemed to me that it was\ngoing to turn into the road and come down past me. But instead the\ndriver, as if he were now sure of his way, put the car at its top speed\nand went on into Aix.\"\n\n\"Was any one inside the car?\" asked Hanaud.\n\n\"No, monsieur; it was empty.\"\n\n\"But you saw the driver!\" exclaimed Wethermill.\n\n\"Yes; what was he like?\" cried the Commissaire.\n\nPerrichet shook his head mournfully.\n\n\"He wore a talc mask over the upper part of his face, and had a little\nblack moustache, and was dressed in a heavy great-coat of blue with a\nwhite collar.\"\n\n\"That is my coat, monsieur,\" said Servettaz, and as he spoke he lifted\nit up from the chauffeur's seat. \"It is Mme. Dauvray's livery.\"\n\nHarry Wethermill groaned aloud.\n\n\"We have lost him. He was within our grasp--he, the murderer!--and he\nwas allowed to go!\"\n\nPerrichet's grief was pitiable.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he pleaded, \"a car slackens its speed and goes on again--it\nis not so unusual a thing. I did not know the number of Mme. Dauvray's\ncar. I did not even know that it had disappeared\"; and suddenly tears\nof mortification filled his eyes. \"But why do I make these excuses?\" he\ncried. \"It is better, M. Hanaud, that I go back to my uniform and stand\nat the street corner. I am as foolish as I look.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my friend,\" said Hanaud, clapping the disconsolate man upon\nthe shoulder. \"You remembered the car and its number. That is\nsomething--and perhaps a great deal,\" he added gravely. \"As for the\ntalc mask and the black moustache, that is not much to help us, it is\ntrue.\" He looked at Ricardo's crestfallen face and smiled. \"We might\narrest our good friend M. Ricardo upon that evidence, but no one else\nthat I know.\"\n\nHanaud laughed immoderately at his joke. He alone seemed to feel no\ndisappointment at Perrichet's oversight. Ricardo was a little touchy on\nthe subject of his personal appearance, and bridled visibly. Hanaud\nturned towards Servettaz.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you know how much petrol was taken from the garage?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me, by the amount which has been used, how far that car\nwas driven last night?\" Hanaud asked.\n\nServettaz examined the tank.\n\n\"A long way, monsieur. From a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty\nkilometres, I should say.\"\n\n\"Yes, just about that distance, I should say,\" cried Hanaud.\n\nHis eyes brightened, and a smile, a rather fierce smile, came to his\nlips. He opened the door, and examined with a minute scrutiny the floor\nof the carriage, and as he looked, the smile faded from his face.\nPerplexity returned to it. He took the cushions, looked them over and\nshook them out.\n\n\"I see no sign--\" he began, and then he uttered a little shrill cry of\nsatisfaction. From the crack of the door by the hinge he picked off a\ntiny piece of pale green stuff, which he spread out upon the back of\nhis hand.\n\n\"Tell me, what is this?\" he said to Ricardo.\n\n\"It is a green fabric,\" said Ricardo very wisely.\n\n\"It is green chiffon,\" said Hanaud. \"And the frock in which Mlle. Celie\nwent away was of green chiffon over satin. Yes, Mlle. Celie travelled\nin this car.\"\n\nHe hurried to the driver's seat. Upon the floor there was some dark\nmould. Hanaud cleaned it off with his knife and held some of it in the\npalm of his hand. He turned to Servettaz.\n\n\"You drove the car on Tuesday morning before you went to Chambery?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Where did you take up Mme. Dauvray and Mlle. Celie?\"\n\n\"At the front door of the Villa Rose.\"\n\n\"Did you get down from the seat at all?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; not after I left the garage.\"\n\nHanaud returned to his companions.\n\n\"See!\" And he opened his hand. \"This is black soil--moist from last\nnight's rain--soil like the soil in front of Mme. Dauvray's salon.\nLook, here is even a blade or two of the grass\"; and he turned the\nmould over in the palm of his hand. Then he took an empty envelope from\nhis pocket and poured the soil into it and gummed the flap down. He\nstood and frowned at the motor-car.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"how I am puzzled! There was a man last night at the\nVilla Rose. There were a man's blurred footmarks in the mould before\nthe glass door. That man drove madame's car for a hundred and fifty\nkilometres, and he leaves the mould which clung to his boots upon the\nfloor of his seat. Mlle. Celie and another woman drove away inside the\ncar. Mlle. Celie leaves a fragment of the chiffon tunic of her frock\nwhich caught in the hinge. But Mlle. Celie made much clearer\nimpressions in the mould than the man. Yet on the floor of the carriage\nthere is no trace of her shoes. Again I say there is something here\nwhich I do not understand.\" And he spread out his hands with an\nimpulsive gesture of despair.\n\n\"It looks as if they had been careful and he careless,\" said Mr.\nRicardo, with the air of a man solving a very difficult problem.\n\n\"What a mind!\" cried Hanaud, now clasping his hands together in\nadmiration. \"How quick and how profound!\"\n\nThere was at times something elephantinely elfish in M. Hanaud's\ndemeanour, which left Mr. Ricardo at a loss. But he had come to notice\nthat these undignified manifestations usually took place when Hanaud\nhad reached a definite opinion upon some point which had perplexed him.\n\n\"Yet there is perhaps, another explanation,\" Hanaud continued. \"For\nobserve, M. Ricardo. We have other evidence to show that the careless\none was Mlle. Celie. It was she who left her footsteps so plainly\nvisible upon the grass, not the man. However, we will go back to M.\nWethermill's room at the Hotel Majestic and talk this matter over. We\nknow something now. Yes, we know--what do we know, monsieur?\" he asked,\nsuddenly turning with a smile to Ricardo, and, as Ricardo paused:\n\"Think it over while we walk down to M. Wethermill's apartment in the\nHotel Majestic.\"\n\n\"We know that the murderer has escaped,\" replied Ricardo hotly.\n\n\"The murderer is not now the most important object of our search. He is\nvery likely at Marseilles by now. We shall lay our hands on him, never\nfear,\" replied Hanaud, with a superb gesture of disdain. \"But it was\nthoughtful of you to remind me of him. I might so easily have clean\nforgotten him, and then indeed my reputation would have suffered an\neclipse.\" He made a low, ironical bow to Ricardo and walked quickly\ndown the road.\n\n\"For a cumbersome man he is extraordinarily active,\" said Mr. Ricardo\nto Harry Wethermill, trying to laugh, without much success. \"A heavy,\nclever, middle-aged man, liable to become a little gutter-boy at a\nmoment's notice.\"\n\nThus he described the great detective, and the description is quoted.\nFor it was Ricardo's best effort in the whole of this business.\n\nThe three men went straight to Harry Wethermill's apartment, which\nconsisted of a sitting-room and a bedroom on the first floor. A balcony\nran along outside. Hanaud stepped out on to it, looked about him, and\nreturned.\n\n\"It is as well to know that we cannot be overheard,\" he said.\n\nHarry Wethermill meanwhile had thrown himself into a chair. The mask he\nhad worn had slipped from its fastenings for a moment. There was a look\nof infinite suffering upon his face. It was the face of a man tortured\nby misery to the snapping-point.\n\nHanaud, on the other hand, was particularly alert. The discovery of the\nmotor-car had raised his spirits. He sat at the table.\n\n\"I will tell you what we have learnt,\" he said, \"and it is of\nimportance. The three of them--the man, the woman with the red hair,\nand Mlle. Celie--all drove yesterday night to Geneva. That is only one\nthing we have learnt.\"\n\n\"Then you still cling to Geneva?\" said Ricardo.\n\n\"More than ever,\" said Hanaud.\n\nHe turned in his chair towards Wethermill.\n\n\"Ah, my poor friend!\" he said, when he saw the young man's distress.\n\nHarry Wethermill sprang up with a gesture as though to sweep the need\nof sympathy away.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\" he asked.\n\n\"You have a road map, perhaps?\" said Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wethermill, \"mine is here. There it is\"; and crossing the\nroom he brought it from a sidetable and placed it in front of Hanaud.\n\nHanaud took a pencil from his pocket.\n\n\"One hundred and fifty kilometres was about the distance which the car\nhad travelled. Measure the distances here, and you will see that Geneva\nis the likely place. It is a good city to hide in. Moreover the car\nappears at the corner at daylight. How does it appear there? What road\nis it which comes out at that corner? The road from Geneva. I am not\nsorry that it is Geneva, for the Chef de la Surete is a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"And what else do we know?\" asked Ricardo.\n\n\"This,\" said Hanaud. He paused impressively. \"Bring up your chair to\nthe table, M. Wethermill, and consider whether I am right or wrong\";\nand he waited until Harry Wethermill had obeyed. Then he laughed in a\nfriendly way at himself.\n\n\"I cannot help it,\" he said; \"I have an eye for dramatic effects. I\nmust prepare for them when I know they are coming. And one, I tell you,\nis coming now.\"\n\nHe shook his finger at his companions. Ricardo shifted and shuffled in\nhis chair. Harry Wethermill kept his eyes fixed on Hanaud's face, but\nhe was quiet, as he had been throughout the long inquiry.\n\nHanaud lit a cigarette and took his time.\n\n\"What I think is this. The man who drove the car into Geneva drove it\nback, because--he meant to leave it again in the garage of the Villa\nRose.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Ricardo, flinging himself back. The theory so\ncalmly enunciated took his breath away.\n\n\"Would he have dared?\" asked Harry Wethermill.\n\nHanaud leaned across and tapped his fingers on the table to emphasise\nhis answer.\n\n\"All through this crime there are two things visible--brains and\ndaring; clever brains and extraordinary daring. Would he have dared? He\ndared to be at the corner close to the Villa Rose at daylight. Why else\nshould he have returned except to put back the car? Consider! The\npetrol is taken from tins which Servettaz might never have touched for\na fortnight, and by that time he might, as he said, have forgotten\nwhether he had not used them himself. I had this possibility in my mind\nwhen I put the questions to Servettaz about the petrol which the\nCommissaire thought so stupid. The utmost care is taken that there\nshall be no mould left on the floor of the carriage. The scrap of\nchiffon was torn off, no doubt, when the women finally left the car,\nand therefore not noticed, or that, too, would have been removed. That\nthe exterior of the car was dirty betrayed nothing, for Servettaz had\nleft it uncleaned.\"\n\nHanaud leaned back and, step by step, related the journey of the car.\n\n\"The man leaves the gate open; he drives into Geneva the two women, who\nare careful that their shoes shall leave no marks upon the floor. At\nGeneva they get out. The man returns. If he can only leave the car in\nthe garage he covers all traces of the course he and his friends have\ntaken. No one would suspect that the car had ever left the garage. At\nthe corner of the road, just as he is turning down to the villa, he\nsees a sergent-de-ville at the gate. He knows that the murder is\ndiscovered. He puts on full speed and goes straight out of the town.\nWhat is he to do? He is driving a car for which the police in an hour\nor two, if not now already, will be surely watching. He is driving it\nin broad daylight. He must get rid of it, and at once, before people\nare about to see it, and to see him in it. Imagine his feelings! It is\nalmost enough to make one pity him. Here he is in a car which convicts\nhim as a murderer, and he has nowhere to leave it. He drives through\nAix. Then on the outskirts of the town he finds an empty villa. He\ndrives in at the gate, forces the door of the coach-house, and leaves\nhis car there. Now, observe! It is no longer any use for him to pretend\nthat he and his friends did not disappear in that car. The murder is\nalready discovered, and with the murder the disappearance of the car.\nSo he no longer troubles his head about it. He does not remove the\ntraces of mould from the place where his feet rested, which otherwise,\nno doubt, he would have done. It no longer matters. He has to run to\nearth now before he is seen. That is all his business. And so the state\nof the car is explained. It was a bold step to bring that car\nback--yes, a bold and desperate step. But a clever one. For, if it had\nsucceeded, we should have known nothing of their movements--oh, but\nnothing--nothing. Ah! I tell you this is no ordinary blundering affair.\nThey are clever people who devised this crime--clever, and of an\naudacity which is surprising.\"\n\nThen Hanaud lit another cigarette.\n\nMr. Ricardo, on the other hand, could hardly continue to smoke for\nexcitement.\n\n\"I cannot understand your calmness,\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"No?\" said Hanaud. \"Yet it is so obvious. You are the amateur, I am the\nprofessional--that is all.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch and rose to his feet.\n\n\"I must go\" he said and as he turned towards the door a cry sprang from\nMr. Ricardo's lips \"It is true. I am the amateur. Yet I have knowledge,\nMonsieur Hanaud which the professional would do well to obtain.\"\n\nHanaud turned a guarded face towards Ricardo. There was no longer any\nraillery in his manner. He spoke slowly, coldly.\n\n\"Let me have it then!\"\n\n\"I have driven in my motor-car from Geneva to Aix,\" Ricardo cried\nexcitedly. \"A bridge crosses a ravine high up amongst the mountains. At\nthe bridge there is a Custom House. There--at the Pont de la\nCaille--your car is stopped. It is searched. You must sign your name in\na book. And there is no way round. You would find sure and certain\nproof whether or no Madame Dauvray's car travelled last night to\nGeneva. Not so many travellers pass along that road at night. You would\nfind certain proof too of how many people were in the car. For they\nsearch carefully at the Pont de la Caille.\"\n\nA dark flush overspread Hanaud's face. Ricardo was in the seventh\nHeaven. He had at last contributed something to the history of this\ncrime. He had repaired an omission. He had supplied knowledge to the\nomniscient. Wethermill looked up drearily like one who has lost heart.\n\n\"Yes, you must not neglect that clue,\" he said.\n\nHanaud replied testily:\n\n\"It is not a clue. M. Ricardo tells that he travelled from Geneva into\nFrance and that his car was searched. Well, we know already that the\nofficers are particular at the Custom Houses of France. But travelling\nfrom France into Switzerland is a very different affair. In\nSwitzerland, hardly a glance, hardly a word.\" That was true. M. Ricardo\ncrestfallen recognized the truth. But his spirits rose again at once.\n\"But the car came back from Geneva into France!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, but when the car came back, the man was alone in it,\" Hanaud\nanswered. \"I have more important things to attend to. For instance I\nmust know whether by any chance they have caught our man at\nMarseilles.\" He laid his hand on Wethermill's shoulder. \"And you, my\nfriend, I should counsel you to get some sleep. We may need all our\nstrength to-morrow. I hope so.\" He was speaking very bravely. \"Yes, I\nhope so.\"\n\nWethermill nodded.\n\n\"I shall try,\" he said.\n\n\"That's better,\" said Hanaud cheerfully. \"You will both stay here this\nevening; for if I have news, I can then ring you up.\"\n\nBoth men agreed, and Hanaud went away. He left Mr. Ricardo profoundly\ndisturbed. \"That man will take advice from no one,\" he declared. \"His\nvanity is colossal. It is true they are not particular at the Swiss\nFrontier. Still the car would have to stop there. At the Custom House\nthey would know something. Hanaud ought to make inquiries.\" But neither\nRicardo nor Harry Wethermill heard a word more from Hanaud that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNEWS FROM GENEVA\n\n\nThe next morning, however, before Mr. Ricardo was out of his bed, M.\nHanaud was announced. He came stepping gaily into the room, more\nelephantinely elfish than ever.\n\n\"Send your valet away,\" he said. And as soon as they were alone he\nproduced a newspaper, which he flourished in Mr. Ricardo's face and\nthen dropped into his hands.\n\nRicardo saw staring him in the face a full description of Celia\nHarland, of her appearance and her dress, of everything except her\nname, coupled with an intimation that a reward of four thousand francs\nwould be paid to any one who could give information leading to the\ndiscovery of her whereabouts to Mr. Ricardo, the Hotel Majestic,\nAix-les-Bains!\n\nMr. Ricardo sat up in his bed with a sense of outrage.\n\n\"You have done this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why have you done it?\" Mr. Ricardo cried.\n\nHanaud advanced to the bed mysteriously on the tips of his toes.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he said, in his most confidential tones. \"Only it\nmust remain a secret between you and me. I did it--because I have a\nsense of humour.\"\n\n\"I hate publicity,\" said Mr. Ricardo acidly.\n\n\"On the other hand you have four thousand francs,\" protested the\ndetective. \"Besides, what else should I do? If I name myself, the very\npeople we are seeking to catch--who, you may be sure, will be the first\nto read this advertisement--will know that I, the great, the\nincomparable Hanaud, am after them; and I do not want them to know\nthat. Besides\"--and he spoke now in a gentle and most serious\nvoice--\"why should we make life more difficult for Mlle. Celie by\ntelling the world that the police want her? It will be time enough for\nthat when she appears before the Juge d'Instruction.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo grumbled inarticulately, and read through the advertisement\nagain.\n\n\"Besides, your description is incomplete,\" he said. \"There is no\nmention of the diamond earrings which Celia Harland was wearing when\nshe went away.\"\n\n\"Ah! so you noticed that!\" exclaimed Hanaud. \"A little more experience\nand I should be looking very closely to my laurels. But as for the\nearrings--I will tell you. Mlle. Celie was not wearing them when she\nwent away from the Villa Rose.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" stammered Ricardo, \"the case upon the dressing-room table\nwas empty.\"\n\n\"Still, she was not wearing them, I know,\" said Hanaud decisively.\n\n\"How do you know?\" cried Ricardo, gazing at Hanaud with awe in his\neyes. \"How could you know?\"\n\n\"Because\"--and Hanaud struck a majestic attitude, like a king in a\nplay--\"because I am the captain of the ship.\"\n\nUpon that Mr. Ricardo suffered a return of his ill-humour.\n\n\"I do not like to be trifled with,\" he remarked, with as much dignity\nas his ruffled hair and the bed-clothes allowed him. He looked sternly\nat the newspaper, turning it over, and then he uttered a cry of\nsurprise.\n\n\"But this is yesterday's paper!\" he said.\n\n\"Yesterday evening's paper,\" Hanaud corrected.\n\n\"Printed at Geneva!\"\n\n\"Printed, and published and sold at Geneva,\" said Hanaud.\n\n\"When did you send the advertisement in, then?\"\n\n\"I wrote a letter while we were taking our luncheon,\" Hanaud explained.\n\"The letter was to Besnard, asking him to telegraph the advertisement\nat once.\"\n\n\"But you never said a word about it to us,\" Ricardo grumbled.\n\n\"No. And was I not wise?\" said Hanaud, with complacency. \"For you would\nhave forbidden me to use your name.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't go so far as that,\" said Ricardo reluctantly. His\nindignation was rapidly evaporating. For there was growing up in his\nmind a pleasant perception that the advertisement placed him in the\nlimelight.\n\nHe rose from his bed.\n\n\"You will make yourself comfortable in the sitting-room while I have my\nbath.\"\n\n\"I will, indeed,\" replied Hanaud cheerily. \"I have already ordered my\nmorning chocolate. I have hopes that you may have a telegram very soon.\nThis paper was cried last night through the streets of Geneva.\"\n\nRicardo dressed for once in a way with some approach to ordinary\ncelerity, and joined Hanaud.\n\n\"Has nothing come?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. This chocolate is very good; it is better than that which I get in\nmy hotel.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Ricardo, who was fairly twittering with\nexcitement. \"You sit there talking about chocolate while my cup shakes\nin my fingers.\"\n\n\"Again I must remind you that you are the amateur, I the professional,\nmy friend.\"\n\nAs the morning drew on, however, Hanaud's professional quietude\ndeserted him. He began to start at the sound of footsteps in the\ncorridor, to glance every other moment from the window, to eat his\ncigarettes rather than to smoke them. At eleven o'clock Ricardo's valet\nbrought a telegram into the room. Ricardo seized it.\n\n\"Calmly, my friend,\" said Hanaud.\n\nWith trembling fingers Ricardo tore it open. He jumped in his chair.\nSpeechless, he handed the telegram to Hanaud. It had been sent from\nGeneva, and it ran thus:\n\n\"Expect me soon after three.--MARTHE GOBIN.\"\n\nHanaud nodded his head.\n\n\"I told you I had hopes.\" All his levity had gone in an instant from\nhis manner. He spoke very quietly.\n\n\"I had better send for Wethermill?\" asked Ricardo.\n\nHanaud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"As you like. But why raise hopes in that poor man's breast which an\nhour or two may dash for ever to the ground? Consider! Marthe Gobin has\nsomething to tell us. Think over those eight points of evidence which\nyou drew up yesterday in the Villa des Fleurs, and say whether what she\nhas to tell us is more likely to prove Mlle. Celie's innocence than her\nguilt. Think well, for I will be guided by you, M. Ricardo,\" said\nHanaud solemnly. \"If you think it better that your friend should live\nin torture until Marthe Gobin comes, and then perhaps suffer worse\ntorture from the news she brings, be it so. You shall decide. If, on\nthe other hand, you think it will be best to leave M. Wethermill in\npeace until we know her story, be it so. You shall decide.\"\n\nRicardo moved uneasily. The solemnity of Hanaud's manner impressed him.\nHe had no wish to take the responsibility of the decision upon himself.\nBut Hanaud sat with his eyes strangely fixed upon Ricardo, waiting for\nhis answer.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ricardo, at length, \"good news will be none the worse for\nwaiting a few hours. Bad news will be a little the better.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hanaud; \"so I thought you would decide.\" He took up a\nContinental Bradshaw from a bookshelf in the room. \"From Geneva she\nwill come through Culoz. Let us see!\" He turned over the pages. \"There\nis a train from Culoz which reaches Aix at seven minutes past three. It\nis by that train she will come. You have a motor-car?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well. Will you pick me up in it at three at my hotel? We will\ndrive down to the station and see the arrivals by that train. It may\nhelp us to get some idea of the person with whom we have to deal. That\nis always an advantage. Now I will leave you, for I have much to do.\nBut I will look in upon M. Wethermill as I go down and tell him that\nthere is as yet no news.\"\n\nHe took up his hat and stick, and stood for a moment staring out of the\nwindow. Then he roused himself from his reverie with a start.\n\n\"You look out upon Mont Revard, I see. I think M. Wethermill's view\nover the garden and the town is the better one,\" he said, and went out\nof the room.\n\nAt three o'clock Ricardo called in his car, which was an open car of\nhigh power, at Hanaud's hotel, and the two men went to the station.\nThey waited outside the exit while the passengers gave up their\ntickets. Amongst them a middle-aged, short woman, of a plethoric\ntendency, attracted their notice. She was neatly but shabbily dressed\nin black; her gloves were darned, and she was obviously in a hurry. As\nshe came out she asked a commissionaire:\n\n\"How far is it to the Hotel Majestic?\"\n\nThe man told her the hotel was at the very top of the town, and the way\nwas steep.\n\n\"But madame can go up in the omnibus of the hotel,\" he suggested.\n\nMadame, however, was in too much of a hurry. The omnibus would have to\nwait for luggage. She hailed a closed cab and drove off inside it.\n\n\"Now, if we go back in the car, we shall be all ready for her when she\narrives,\" said Hanaud.\n\nThey passed the cab, indeed, a few yards up the steep hill which leads\nfrom the station. The cab was moving at a walk.\n\n\"She looks honest,\" said Hanaud, with a sigh of relief. \"She is some\ngood bourgeoise anxious to earn four thousand francs.\"\n\nThey reached the hotel in a few minutes.\n\n\"We may need your car again the moment Marthe Gobin has gone,\" said\nHanaud.\n\n\"It shall wait here,\" said Ricardo.\n\n\"No,\" said Hanaud; \"let it wait in the little street at the back of my\nhotel. It will not be so noticeable there. You have petrol for a long\njourney?\"\n\nRicardo gave the order quietly to his chauffeur, and followed Hanaud\ninto the hotel. Through a glass window they could see Wethermill\nsmoking a cigar over his coffee.\n\n\"He looks as if he had not slept,\" said Ricardo.\n\nHanaud nodded sympathetically, and beckoned Ricardo past the window.\n\n\"But we are nearing the end. These two days have been for him days of\ngreat trouble; one can see that very clearly. And he has done nothing\nto embarrass us. Men in distress are apt to be a nuisance. I am\ngrateful to M. Wethermill. But we are nearing the end. Who knows?\nWithin an hour or two we may have news for him.\"\n\nHe spoke with great feeling, and the two men ascended the stairs to\nRicardo's rooms. For the second time that day Hanaud's professional\ncalm deserted him. The window overlooked the main entrance to the\nhotel. Hanaud arranged the room, and, even while he arranged it, ran\nevery other second and leaned from the window to watch for the coming\nof the cab.\n\n\"Put the bank-notes upon the table,\" he said hurriedly. \"They will\npersuade her to tell us all that she has to tell. Yes, that will do.\nShe is not in sight yet? No.\"\n\n\"She could not be. It is a long way from the station,\" said Ricardo,\n\"and the whole distance is uphill.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true,\" Hanaud replied. \"We will not embarrass her by\nsitting round the table like a tribunal. You will sit in that\narm-chair.\"\n\nRicardo took his seat, crossed his knees, and joined the tips of his\nfingers.\n\n\"So! not too judicial!\" said Hanaud; \"I will sit here at the table.\nWhatever you do, do not frighten her.\" Hanaud sat down in the chair\nwhich he had placed for himself. \"Marthe Gobin shall sit opposite, with\nthe light upon her face. So!\" And, springing up, he arranged a chair\nfor her. \"Whatever you do, do not frighten her,\" he repeated. \"I am\nnervous. So much depends upon this interview.\" And in a second he was\nback at the window.\n\nRicardo did not move. He arranged in his mind the interrogatory which\nwas to take place. He was to conduct it. He was the master of the\nsituation. All the limelight was to be his. Startling facts would come\nto light elicited by his deft questions. Hanaud need not fear. He would\nnot frighten her. He would be gentle, he would be cunning. Softly and\ndelicately he would turn this good woman inside out, like a glove.\nEvery artistic fibre in his body vibrated to the dramatic situation.\n\nSuddenly Hanaud leaned out of the window.\n\n\"It comes! it comes!\" he said in a quick, feverish whisper. \"I can see\nthe cab between the shrubs of the drive.\"\n\n\"Let it come!\" said Mr. Ricardo superbly.\n\nEven as he sat he could hear the grating of wheels upon the drive. He\nsaw Hanaud lean farther from the window and stamp impatiently upon the\nfloor.\n\n\"There it is at the door,\" he said; and for a few seconds he spoke no\nmore. He stood looking downwards, craning his head, with his back\ntowards Ricardo.\n\nThen, with a wild and startled cry, he staggered back into the room.\nHis face was white as wax, his eyes full of horror, his mouth open.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" exclaimed Ricardo, springing to his feet.\n\n\"They are lifting her out! She doesn't move! They are lifting her out!\"\n\nFor a moment he stared into Ricardo's face--paralysed by fear. Then he\nsprang down the stairs. Ricardo followed him.\n\nThere was confusion in the corridor. Men were running, voices were\ncrying questions. As they passed the window they saw Wethermill start\nup, aroused from his lethargy. They knew the truth before they reached\nthe entrance of the hotel. A cab had driven up to the door from the\nstation; in the cab was an unknown woman stabbed to the heart.\n\n\"She should have come by the omnibus,\" Hanaud repeated and repeated\nstupidly. For the moment he was off his balance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE UNOPENED LETTER\n\n\nThe hall of the hotel had been cleared of people. At the entrance from\nthe corridor a porter barred the way.\n\n\"No one can pass,\" said he.\n\n\"I think that I can,\" said Hanaud, and he produced his card. \"From the\nSurete at Paris.\"\n\nHe was allowed to enter, with Ricardo at his heels. On the ground lay\nMarthe Gobin; the manager of the hotel stood at her side; a doctor was\non his knees. Hanaud gave his card to the manager.\n\n\"You have sent word to the police?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the manager.\n\n\"And the wound?\" asked Hanaud, kneeling on the ground beside the\ndoctor. It was a very small wound, round and neat and clean, and there\nwas very little blood. \"It was made by a bullet,\" said Hanaud--\"some\ntiny bullet from an air-pistol.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the doctor.\n\n\"No knife made it,\" Hanaud asserted.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the doctor. \"Look!\" and he took up from the floor\nby his knee the weapon which had caused Marthe Gobin's death. It was\nnothing but an ordinary skewer with a ring at one end and a sharp point\nat the other, and a piece of common white firewood for a handle. The\nwood had been split, the ring inserted and spliced in position with\nstrong twine. It was a rough enough weapon, but an effective one. The\nproof of its effectiveness lay stretched upon the floor beside them.\n\nHanaud gave it to the manager of the hotel.\n\n\"You must be very careful of this, and give it as it is to the police.\"\n\nThen he bent once more over Marthe Gobin.\n\n\"Did she suffer?\" he asked in a low voice.\n\n\"No; death must have been instantaneous,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" said Hanaud, as he rose again to his feet.\n\nIn the doorway the driver of the cab was standing.\n\n\"What has he to say?\" Hanaud asked.\n\nThe man stepped forward instantly. He was an old, red-faced, stout man,\nwith a shiny white tall hat, like a thousand drivers of cabs.\n\n\"What have I to say, monsieur?\" he grumbled in a husky voice. \"I take\nup the poor woman at the station and I drive her where she bids me, and\nI find her dead, and my day is lost. Who will pay my fare, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Hanaud. \"There it is,\" and he handed the man a\nfive-franc piece. \"Now, answer me! Do you tell me that this woman was\nmurdered in your cab and that you knew nothing about it?\"\n\n\"But what should I know? I take her up at the station, and all the way\nup the hill her head is every moment out of the window, crying,\n'Faster, faster!' Oh, the good woman was in a hurry! But for me I take\nno notice. The more she shouts, the less I hear; I bury my head between\nmy shoulders, and I look ahead of me and I take no notice. One cannot\nexpect cab-horses to run up these hills; it is not reasonable.\"\n\n\"So you went at a walk,\" said Hanaud. He beckoned to Ricardo, and\nsaid to the manager: \"M. Besnard will, no doubt, be here in a few\nminutes, and he will send for the Juge d'Instruction. There is\nnothing that we can do.\"\n\nHe went back to Ricardo's sitting-room and flung himself into a chair.\nHe had been calm enough downstairs in the presence of the doctor and\nthe body of the victim. Now, with only Ricardo for a witness, he gave\nway to distress.\n\n\"It is terrible,\" he said. \"The poor woman! It was I who brought her to\nAix. It was through my carelessness. But who would have thought--?\" He\nsnatched his hands from his face and stood up. \"I should have thought,\"\nhe said solemnly. \"Extraordinary daring--that was one of the qualities\nof my criminal. I knew it, and I disregarded it. Now we have a second\ncrime.\"\n\n\"The skewer may lead you to the criminal,\" said Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"The skewer!\" cried Hanaud. \"How will that help us? A knife,\nyes--perhaps. But a skewer!\"\n\n\"At the shops--there will not be so many in Aix at which you can buy\nskewers--they may remember to whom they sold one within the last day or\nso.\"\n\n\"How do we know it was bought in the last day or so?\" cried Hanaud\nscornfully. \"We have not to do with a man who walks into a shop and\nbuys a single skewer to commit a murder with, and so hands himself over\nto the police. How often must I say it!\"\n\nThe violence of his contempt nettled Ricardo.\n\n\"If the murderer did not buy it, how did he obtain it?\" he asked\nobstinately.\n\n\"Oh, my friend, could he not have stolen it? From this or from any\nhotel in Aix? Would the loss of a skewer be noticed, do you think? How\nmany people in Aix to-day have had rognons a la brochette for their\nluncheon! Besides, it is not merely the death of this poor woman which\ntroubles me. We have lost the evidence which she was going to bring to\nus. She had something to tell us about Celie Harland which now we shall\nnever hear. We have to begin all over again, and I tell you we have not\nthe time to begin all over again. No, we have not the time. Time will\nbe lost, and we have no time to lose.\" He buried his face again in his\nhands and groaned aloud. His grief was so violent and so sincere that\nRicardo, shocked as he was by the murder of Marthe Gobin, set himself\nto console him.\n\n\"But you could not have foreseen that at three o'clock in the afternoon\nat Aix--\"\n\nHanaud brushed the excuse aside.\n\n\"It is no extenuation. I OUGHT to have foreseen. Oh, but I will have no\npity now,\" he cried, and as he ended the words abruptly his face\nchanged. He lifted a trembling forefinger and pointed. There came a\nsudden look of life into his dull and despairing eyes.\n\nHe was pointing to a side-table on which were piled Mr. Ricardo's\nletters.\n\n\"You have not opened them this morning?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. You came while I was still in bed. I have not thought of them till\nnow.\"\n\nHanaud crossed to the table, and, looking down at the letters, uttered\na cry.\n\n\"There's one, the big envelope,\" he said, his voice shaking like his\nhand. \"It has a Swiss stamp.\"\n\nHe swallowed to moisten his throat. Ricardo sprang across the room and\ntore open the envelope. There was a long letter enclosed in a\nhandwriting unknown to him. He read aloud the first lines of the letter:\n\n\"I write what I saw and post it to-night, so that no one may be before\nme with the news. I will come over to-morrow for the money.\"\n\nA low exclamation from Hanaud interrupted the words.\n\n\"The signature! Quick!\"\n\nRicardo turned to the end of the letter.\n\n\"Marthe Gobin.\"\n\n\"She speaks, then! After all she speaks!\" Hanaud whispered in a voice\nof awe. He ran to the door of the room, opened it suddenly, and,\nshutting it again, locked it. \"Quick! We cannot bring that poor woman\nback to life; but we may still--\" He did not finish his sentence. He\ntook the letter unceremoniously from Ricardo's hand and seated himself\nat the table. Over his shoulder Mr. Ricardo, too, read Marthe Gobin's\nletter.\n\nIt was just the sort of letter, which in Ricardo's view, Marthe Gobin\nwould have written--a long, straggling letter which never kept to the\npoint, which exasperated them one moment by its folly and fired them to\nexcitement the next.\n\nIt was dated from a small suburb of Geneva, on the western side of the\nlake, and it ran as follows:\n\n\"The suburb is but a street close to the lake-side, and a tram runs\ninto the city. It is quite respectable, you understand, monsieur, with\na hotel at the end of it, and really some very good houses. But I do\nnot wish to deceive you about the social position of myself or my\nhusband. Our house is on the wrong side of the street--definitely--yes.\nIt is a small house, and we do not see the water from any of the\nwindows because of the better houses opposite. M. Gobin, my husband,\nwho was a clerk in one of the great banks in Geneva, broke down in\nhealth in the spring, and for the last three months has been compelled\nto keep indoors. Of course, money has not been plentiful, and I could\nnot afford a nurse. Consequently I myself have been compelled to nurse\nhim. Monsieur, if you were a woman, you would know what men are when\nthey are ill--how fretful, how difficult. There is not much distraction\nfor the woman who nurses them. So, as I am in the house most of the\nday, I find what amusement I can in watching the doings of my\nneighbours. You will not blame me.\n\n\"A month ago the house almost directly opposite to us was taken\nfurnished for the summer by a Mme. Rossignol. She is a widow, but\nduring the last fortnight a young gentleman has come several times in\nthe afternoon to see her, and it is said in the street that he is going\nto marry her. But I cannot believe it myself. Monsieur is a young man\nof perhaps thirty, with smooth, black hair. He wears a moustache, a\nlittle black moustache, and is altogether captivating. Mme. Rossignol\nis five or six years older, I should think--a tall woman, with red hair\nand a bold sort of coarse beauty. I was not attracted by her. She\nseemed not quite of the same world as that charming monsieur who was\nsaid to be going to marry her. No; I was not attracted by Adele\nRossignol.\"\n\nAnd when he had come to that point Hanaud looked up with a start.\n\n\"So the name was Adele,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ricardo. \"Helene Vauquier spoke the truth.\"\n\nHanaud nodded with a queer smile upon his lips.\n\n\"Yes, there she spoke the truth. I thought she did.\"\n\n\"But she said Adele's hair was black,\" interposed Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"Yes, there she didn't,\" said Hanaud drily, and his eyes dropped again\nto the paper.\n\n\"I knew her name was Adele, for often I have heard her servant calling\nher so, and without any 'Madame' in front of the name. That is strange,\nis it not, to hear an elderly servant-woman calling after her mistress,\n'Adele,' just simple 'Adele'? It was that which made me think monsieur\nand madame were not of the same world. But I do not believe that they\nare going to be married. I have an instinct about it. Of course, one\nnever knows with what extraordinary women the nicest men will fall in\nlove. So that after all these two may get married. But if they do, I do\nnot think they will be happy.\n\n\"Besides the old woman there was another servant, a man, Hippolyte, who\nserved in the house and drove the carriage when it was wanted--a\nrespectable man. He always touched his hat when Mme. Rossignol came out\nof the house. He slept in the house at night, although the stable was\nat the end of the street. I thought he was probably the son of Jeanne,\nthe servant-woman. He was young, and his hair was plastered down upon\nhis forehead, and he was altogether satisfied with himself and a great\nfavorite amongst the servants in the street. The carriage and the horse\nwere hired from Geneva. That is the household of Mme. Rossignol.\"\n\nSo far, Mr. Ricardo read in silence. Then he broke out again.\n\n\"But we have them! The red-haired woman called Adele; the man with the\nlittle black moustache. It was he who drove the motor-car!\"\n\nHanaud held up his hand to check the flow of words, and both read on\nagain:\n\n\"At three o'clock on Tuesday afternoon madame was driven away in the\ncarriage, and I did not see it return all that evening. Of course, it\nmay have returned to the stables by another road. But it was not\nunusual for the carriage to take her into Geneva and wait a long time.\nI went to bed at eleven, but in the night M. Gobin was restless, and I\nrose to get him some medicine. We slept in the front of the house,\nmonsieur, and while I was searching for the matches upon the table in\nthe middle of the room I heard the sound of carriage wheels in the\nsilent street. I went to the window, and, raising a corner of the\ncurtains, looked out. M. Gobin called to me fretfully from the bed to\nknow why I did not light the candle and get him what he wanted. I have\nalready told you how fretful sick men can be, always complaining if\njust for a minute one distracts oneself by looking out of the window.\nBut there! One can do nothing to please them. Yet how right I was to\nraise the blind and look out of the window! For if I had obeyed my\nhusband I might have lost four thousand francs. And four thousand\nfrancs are not to be sneezed at by a poor woman whose husband lies in\nbed.\n\n\"I saw the carriage stop at Mme. Rossignol's house. Almost at once the\nhouse door was opened by the old servant, although the hall of the\nhouse and all the windows in the front were dark. That was the first\nthing that surprised me. For when madame came home late and the house\nwas dark, she used to let herself in with a latchkey. Now, in the dark\nhouse, in the early morning, a servant was watching for them. It was\nstrange.\n\n\"As soon as the door of the house was opened the door of the carriage\nopened too, and a young lady stepped quickly out on to the pavement.\nThe train of her dress caught in the door, and she turned round,\nstooped, freed it with her hand, and held it up off the ground. The\nnight was clear, and there was a lamp in the street close by the door\nof Mme. Rossignol's house. As she turned I saw her face under the big\ngreen hat. It was very pretty and young, and the hair was fair. She\nwore a white coat, but it was open in front and showed her evening\nfrock of pale green. When she lifted her skirt I saw the buckles\nsparkling on her satin shoes. It was the young lady for whom you are\nadvertising, I am sure. She remained standing just for a moment without\nmoving, while Mme. Rossignol got out. I was surprised to see a young\nlady of such distinction in Mme. Rossignol's company. Then, still\nholding her skirt up, she ran very lightly and quickly across the\npavement into the dark house. I thought, monsieur, that she was very\nanxious not to be seen. So when I saw your advertisement I was certain\nthat this was the young lady for whom you are searching.\n\n\"I waited for a few moments and saw the carriage drive off towards the\nstable at the end of the street. But no light went up in any of the\nrooms in front of the house. And M. Gobin was so fretful that I dropped\nthe corner of the blind, lit the candle, and gave him his cooling\ndrink. His watch was on the table at the bedside, and I saw that it was\nfive minutes to three. I will send you a telegram to-morrow, as soon as\nI am sure at what hour I can leave my husband. Accept, monsieur, I beg\nyou, my most distinguished salutations.\n\n\"MARTHE GOBIN.\"\n\nHanaud leant back with an extraordinary look of perplexity upon his\nface. But to Ricardo the whole story was now clear. Here was an\nindependent witness, without the jealousy or rancours of Helene\nVauquier. Nothing could be more damning than her statement; it\ncorroborated those footmarks upon the soil in front of the glass door\nof the salon. There was nothing to be done except to set about\narresting Mlle. Celie at once.\n\n\"The facts work with your theory, M. Hanaud. The young man with the\nblack moustache did not return to the house at Geneva. For somewhere\nupon the road close to Geneva he met the carriage. He was driving back\nthe car to Aix--\" And then another thought struck him: \"But no!\" he\ncried. \"We are altogether wrong. See! They did not reach home until\nfive minutes to three.\"\n\nFive minutes to three! But this demolished the whole of Hanaud's theory\nabout the motor-car. The murderers had left the villa between eleven\nand twelve, probably before half-past eleven. The car was a machine of\nsixty horse-power, and the roads were certain to be clear. Yet the\ntravellers only reached their home at three. Moreover, the car was back\nin Aix at four. It was evident they did not travel by the car.\n\n\"Geneva time is an hour later than French time,\" said Hanaud shortly.\nIt seemed as if the corroboration of this letter disappointed him. \"A\nquarter to three in Mme. Gobin's house would be a quarter to two by our\nwatches here.\"\n\nHanaud folded up the letter, and rose to his feet.\n\n\"We will go now, and we will take this letter with us.\" Hanaud looked\nabout the room, and picked up a glove lying upon a table. \"I left this\nbehind me,\" he said, putting it into his pocket. \"By the way, where is\nthe telegram from Marthe Gobin?\"\n\n\"You put it in your letter-case.\"\n\n\"Oh, did I?\"\n\nHanaud took out his letter-case and found the telegram within it. His\nface lightened.\n\n\"Good!\" he said emphatically. \"For, since we have this telegram, there\nmust have been another message sent from Adele Rossignol to Aix saying\nthat Marthe Gobin, that busybody, that inquisitive neighbour, who had\nno doubt seen M. Ricardo's advertisement, was on her way hither. Oh it\nwill not be put as crudely as that, but that is what the message will\nmean. We shall have him.\" And suddenly his face grew very stern. \"I\nMUST catch him, for Marthe Gobin's death I cannot forgive. A poor woman\nmeaning no harm, and murdered like a sheep under our noses. No, that I\ncannot forgive.\"\n\nRicardo wondered whether it was the actual murder of Marthe Gobin or\nthe fact that he had been beaten and outwitted which Hanaud could not\nforgive. But discretion kept him silent.\n\n\"Let us go,\" said Hanaud. \"By the lift, if you please; it will save\ntime.\"\n\nThey descended into the hall close by the main door. The body of Marthe\nGobin had been removed to the mortuary of the town. The life of the\nhotel had resumed its course.\n\n\"M. Besnard has gone, I suppose?\" Hanaud asked of the porter; and,\nreceiving an assent, he walked quickly out of the front door.\n\n\"But there is a shorter way,\" said Ricardo, running after him: \"across\nthe garden at the back and down the steps.\"\n\n\"It will make no difference now,\" said Hanaud.\n\nThey hurried along the drive and down the road which circled round the\nhotel and dipped to the town.\n\nBehind Hanaud's hotel Ricardo's car was waiting.\n\n\"We must go first to Besnard's office. The poor man will be at his\nwits' end to know who was Mme. Gobin and what brought her to Aix.\nBesides, I wish to send a message over the telephone.\"\n\nHanaud descended and spent a quarter of an hour with the Commissaire.\nAs he came out he looked at his watch.\n\n\"We shall be in time, I think,\" he said. He climbed into the car. \"The\nmurder of Marthe Gobin on her way from the station will put our friends\nat their ease. It will be published, no doubt, in the evening papers,\nand those good people over there in Geneva will read it with amusement.\nThey do not know that Marthe Gobin wrote a letter yesterday night.\nCome, let us go!\"\n\n\"Where to?\" asked Ricardo.\n\n\"Where to?\" exclaimed Hanaud. \"Why, of course, to Geneva.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE ALUMINIUM FLASK\n\n\n\"I have telephoned to Lemerre, the Chef de la Surete at Geneva,\" said\nHanaud, as the car sped out of Aix along the road to Annecy. \"He will\nhave the house watched. We shall be in time. They will do nothing until\ndark.\"\n\nBut though he spoke confidently there was a note of anxiety in his\nvoice, and he sat forward in the car, as though he were already\nstraining his eyes to see Geneva.\n\nRicardo was a trifle disappointed. They were on the great journey to\nGeneva. They were going to arrest Mlle. Celie and her accomplices. And\nHanaud had not come disguised. Hanaud, in Ricardo's eyes, was hardly\nliving up to the dramatic expedition on which they had set out. It\nseemed to him that there was something incorrect in the great detective\ncoming out on the chase without a false beard.\n\n\"But, my dear friend, why shouldn't I?\" pleaded Hanaud. \"We are going\nto dine together at the Restaurant du Nord, over the lake, until it\ngrows dark. It is not pleasant to eat one's soup in a false beard. Have\nyou tried it? Besides, everybody stares so, seeing perfectly well that\nit is false. Now, I do not want to-night that people should know me for\na detective; so I do not go disguised.\"\n\n\"Humorist!\" said Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"There! you have found me out!\" cried Hanaud, in mock alarm. \"Besides,\nI told you this morning that that is precisely what I am.\"\n\nBeyond Annecy, they came to the bridge over the ravine. At the far end\nof it, the car stopped. A question, a hurried glance into the body of\nthe car, and the officers of the Customs stood aside.\n\n\"You see how perfunctory it is,\" said Hanaud and with a jerk the car\nmoved on. The jerk threw Hanaud against Mr. Ricardo. Something hard in\nthe detective's pocket knocked against his companion.\n\n\"You have got them?\" he whispered.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The handcuffs.\"\n\nAnother disappointment awaited Ricardo. A detective without a false\nbeard was bad enough, but that was nothing to a detective without\nhandcuffs. The paraphernalia of justice were sadly lacking. However,\nHanaud consoled Mr. Ricardo by showing him the hard thing; it was\nalmost as thrilling as the handcuffs, for it was a loaded revolver.\n\n\"There will be danger, then?\" said Ricardo, with a tremor of\nexcitement. \"I should have brought mine.\"\n\n\"There would have been danger, my friend,\" Hanaud objected gravely, \"if\nyou had brought yours.\"\n\nThey reached Geneva as the dusk was falling, and drove straight to the\nrestaurant by the side of the lake and mounted to the balcony on the\nfirst floor. A small, stout man sat at a table alone in a corner of the\nbalcony. He rose and held out his hands.\n\n\"My friend, M. Lemerre, the Chef de la Surete of Geneva,\" said Hanaud,\npresenting the little man to his companion.\n\nThere were as yet only two couples dining in the restaurant, and Hanaud\nspoke so that neither could overhear him. He sat down at the table.\n\n\"What news?\" he asked.\n\n\"None,\" said Lemerre. \"No one has come out of the house, no one has\ngone in.\"\n\n\"And if anything happens while we dine?\"\n\n\"We shall know,\" said Lemerre. \"Look, there is a man loitering under\nthe trees there. He will strike a match to light his pipe.\"\n\nThe hurried conversation was ended.\n\n\"Good,\" said Hanaud. \"We will dine, then, and be gay.\"\n\nHe called to the waiter and ordered dinner. It was after seven when\nthey sat down to dinner, and they dined while the dusk deepened. In the\nstreet below the lights flashed out, throwing a sheen on the foliage of\nthe trees at the water's side. Upon the dark lake the reflections of\nlamps rippled and shook. A boat in which musicians sang to music,\npassed by with a cool splash of oars. The green and red lights of the\nlaunches glided backwards and forwards. Hanaud alone of the party on\nthe balcony tried to keep the conversation upon a light and general\nlevel. But it was plain that even he was overdoing his gaiety. There\nwere moments when a sudden contraction of the muscles would clench his\nhands and give a spasmodic jerk to his shoulders. He was waiting\nuneasily, uncomfortably, until darkness should come.\n\n\"Eat,\" he cried--\"eat, my friends,\" playing with his own barely tasted\nfood.\n\nAnd then, at a sentence from Lemerre, his knife and fork clattered on\nhis plate, and he sat with a face suddenly grown white.\n\nFor Lemerre said, as though it was no more than a matter of ordinary\ncomment:\n\n\"So Mme. Dauvray's jewels were, after all, never stolen?\"\n\nHanaud started.\n\n\"You know that? How did you know it?\"\n\n\"It was in this evening's paper. I bought one on the way here. They\nwere found under the floor of the bedroom.\"\n\nAnd even as he spoke a newsboy's voice rang out in the street below\nthem. Lemerre was alarmed by the look upon his friend's face.\n\n\"Does it matter, Hanaud?\" he asked, with some solicitude.\n\n\"It matters--\" and Hanaud rose up abruptly.\n\nThe boy's voice sounded louder in the street below. The words became\ndistinct to all upon that balcony.\n\n\"The Aix murder! Discovery of the jewels!\"\n\n\"We must go,\" Hanaud whispered hoarsely. \"Here are life and death in\nthe balance, as I believe, and there\"--he pointed down to the little\ngroup gathering about the newsboy under the trees--\"there is the\ncommand which way to tip the scales.\"\n\n\"It was not I who sent it,\" said Ricardo eagerly.\n\nHe had no precise idea what Hanaud meant by his words; but he realised\nthat the sooner he exculpated himself from the charge the better.\n\n\"Of course it was not you. I know that very well,\" said Hanaud. He\ncalled for the bill. \"When is that paper published?\"\n\n\"At seven,\" said Lemerre.\n\n\"They have been crying it in the streets of Geneva, then, for more than\nhalf an hour.\"\n\nHe sat drumming impatiently upon the table until the bill should be\nbrought.\n\n\"By Heaven, that's clever!\" he muttered savagely. \"There's a man who\ngets ahead of me at every turn. See, Lemerre, I take every care, every\nprecaution, that no message shall be sent. I let it be known, I take\ncareful pains to let it be known, that no message can be sent without\ndetection following, and here's the message sent by the one channel I\nnever thought to guard against and stop. Look!\"\n\nThe murder at the Villa Rose and the mystery which hid its perpetration\nhad aroused interest. This new development had quickened it. From the\nbalcony Hanaud could see the groups thickening about the boy and the\nwhite sheets of the newspapers in the hands of passers-by.\n\n\"Every one in Geneva or near Geneva will know of this message by now.\"\n\n\"Who could have told?\" asked Ricardo blankly, and Hanaud laughed in his\nface, but laughed without any merriment.\n\n\"At last!\" he cried, as the waiter brought the bill, and just as he had\npaid it the light of a match flared up under the trees.\n\n\"The signal!\" said Lemerre.\n\n\"Not too quickly,\" whispered Hanaud.\n\nWith as much unconcern as each could counterfeit, the three men\ndescended the stairs and crossed the road. Under the trees a fourth man\njoined them--he who had lighted his pipe.\n\n\"The coachman, Hippolyte,\" he whispered, \"bought an evening paper at\nthe front door of the house from a boy who came down the street\nshouting the news. The coachman ran back into the house.\"\n\n\"When was this?\" asked Lemerre.\n\nThe man pointed to a lad who leaned against the balustrade above the\nlake, hot and panting for breath.\n\n\"He came on his bicycle. He has just arrived.\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Lemerre.\n\nSix yards from where they stood a couple of steps led down from the\nembankment on to a wooden landing-stage, where boats were moored.\nLemerre, followed by the others, walked briskly down on to the\nlanding-stage. An electric launch was waiting. It had an awning and was\nof the usual type which one hires at Geneva. There were two sergeants\nin plain clothes on board, and a third man, whom Ricardo recognised.\n\n\"That is the man who found out in whose shop the cord was bought,\" he\nsaid to Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes, it is Durette. He has been here since yesterday.\"\n\nLemerre and the three who followed him stepped into it, and it backed\naway from the stage and, turning, sped swiftly outwards from Geneva.\nThe gay lights of the shops and the restaurants were left behind, the\ncool darkness enveloped them; a light breeze blew over the lake, a\ntrail of white and tumbled water lengthened out behind and overhead, in\na sky of deepest blue, the bright stars shone like gold.\n\n\"If only we are in time!\" said Hanaud, catching his breath.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Lemerre; and in both their voices there was a strange\nnote of gravity.\n\nLemerre gave a signal after a while, and the boat turned to the shore\nand reduced its speed. They had passed the big villas. On the bank the\ngardens of houses--narrow, long gardens of a street of small\nhouses--reached down to the lake, and to almost each garden there was a\nrickety landing-stage of wood projecting into the lake. Again Lemerre\ngave a signal, and the boat's speed was so much reduced that not a\nsound of its coming could be heard. It moved over the water like a\nshadow, with not so much as a curl of white at its bows.\n\nLemerre touched Hanaud on the shoulder and pointed to a house in a row\nof houses. All the windows except two upon the second floor and one\nupon the ground floor were in absolute darkness, and over those upper\ntwo the wooden shutters were closed. But in the shutters there were\ndiamond-shaped holes, and from these holes two yellow beams of light,\nlike glowing eyes upon the watch, streamed out and melted in the air.\n\n\"You are sure that the front of the house is guarded?\" asked Hanaud\nanxiously.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lemerre.\n\nRicardo shivered with excitement. The launch slid noiselessly into the\nbank and lay hidden under its shadow. Hanaud turned to his associates\nwith his finger to his lips. Something gleamed darkly in his hand. It\nwas the barrel of his revolver. Cautiously the men disembarked and\ncrept up the bank. First came Lemerre, then Hanaud; Ricardo followed\nhim, and the fourth man, who had struck the match under the trees,\nbrought up the rear. The other three officers remained in the boat.\n\nStooping under the shadow of the side wall of the garden, the invaders\nstole towards the house. When a bush rustled or a tree whispered in the\nlight wind, Ricardo's heart jumped to his throat. Once Lemerre stopped,\nas though his ears heard a sound which warned him of danger. Then\ncautiously he crept on again. The garden was a ragged place of unmown\nlawn and straggling bushes. Behind each one Mr. Ricardo seemed to feel\nan enemy. Never had he been in so strait a predicament. He, the\ncultured host of Grosvenor Square, was creeping along under a wall with\nContinental policemen; he was going to raid a sinister house by the\nLake of Geneva. It was thrilling. Fear and excitement gripped him in\nturn and let him go, but always he was sustained by the pride of the\nman doing an out-of-the-way thing. \"If only my friends could see me\nnow!\" The ancient vanity was loud in his bosom. Poor fellows, they were\nupon yachts in the Solent or on grouse-moors in Scotland, or on\ngolf-links at North Berwick. He alone of them all was tracking\nmalefactors to their doom by Leman's Lake.\n\nFrom these agreeable reflections Ricardo was shaken. Lemerre stopped.\nThe raiders had reached the angle made by the side wall of the garden\nand the house. A whisper was exchanged, and the party turned and moved\nalong the house wall towards the lighted window on the ground floor. As\nLemerre reached it he stooped. Then slowly his forehead and his eyes\nrose above the sill and glanced this way and that into the room. Mr.\nRicardo could see his eyes gleaming as the light from the window caught\nthem. His face rose completely over the sill. He stared into the room\nwithout care or apprehension, and then dropped again out of the reach\nof the light. He turned to Hanaud.\n\n\"The room is empty,\" he whispered.\n\nHanaud turned to Ricardo.\n\n\"Pass under the sill, or the light from the window will throw your\nshadow upon the lawn.\"\n\nThe party came to the back door of the house. Lemerre tried the handle\nof the door, and to his surprise it yielded. They crept into the\npassage. The last man closed the door noiselessly, locked it, and\nremoved the key. A panel of light shone upon the wall a few paces\nahead. The door of the lighted room was open. As Ricardo stepped\nsilently past it, he looked in. It was a parlour meanly furnished.\nHanaud touched him on the arm and pointed to the table.\n\nRicardo had seen the objects at which Hanaud pointed often enough\nwithout uneasiness; but now, in this silent house of crime, they had\nthe most sinister and appalling aspect. There was a tiny phial half\nfull of a dark-brown liquid, beside it a little leather case lay open,\nand across the case, ready for use or waiting to be filled, was a\nbright morphia needle. Ricardo felt the cold creep along his spine, and\nshivered.\n\n\"Come,\" whispered Hanaud.\n\nThey reached the foot of a flight of stairs, and cautiously mounted it.\nThey came out in a passage which ran along the side of the house from\nthe back to the front. It was unlighted, but they were now on the level\nof the street, and a fan-shaped glass window over the front door\nadmitted a pale light. There was a street lamp near to the door,\nRicardo remembered. For by the light of it Marthe Gobin had seen Celia\nHarland run so nimbly into this house.\n\nFor a moment the men in the passage held their breath. Some one strode\nheavily by on the pavement outside--to Mr. Ricardo's ear a most\ncompanionable sound. Then a clock upon a church struck the half-hour\nmusically, distantly. It was half-past eight. And a second afterwards a\ntiny bright light shone. Hanaud was directing the light of a pocket\nelectric torch to the next flight of stairs.\n\nHere the steps were carpeted, and once more the men crept up. One after\nanother they came out upon the next landing. It ran, like those below\nit, along the side of the house from the back to the front, and the\ndoors were all upon their left hand. From beneath the door nearest to\nthem a yellow line of light streamed out.\n\nThey stood in the darkness listening. But not a sound came from behind\nthe door. Was this room empty, too? In each one's mind was the fear\nthat the birds had flown. Lemerre carefully took the handle of the door\nand turned it. Very slowly and cautiously he opened the door. A strong\nlight beat out through the widening gap upon his face. And then, though\nhis feet did not move, his shoulders and his face drew back. The action\nwas significant enough. This room, at all events, was not empty. But of\nwhat Lemerre saw in the room his face gave no hint. He opened the door\nwider, and now Hanaud saw. Ricardo, trembling with excitement, watched\nhim. But again there was no expression of surprise, consternation, or\ndelight. He stood stolidly and watched. Then he turned to Ricardo,\nplaced a finger on his lips, and made room. Ricardo crept on tiptoe to\nhis side. And now he too could look in. He saw a brightly lit bedroom\nwith a made bed. On his left were the shuttered windows overlooking the\nlake. On his right in the partition wall a door stood open. Through the\ndoor he could see a dark, windowless closet, with a small bed from\nwhich the bedclothes hung and trailed upon the floor, as though some\none had been but now roughly dragged from it. On a table, close by the\ndoor, lay a big green hat with a brown ostrich feather, and a white\ncloak. But the amazing spectacle which kept him riveted was just in\nfront of him. An old hag of a woman was sitting in a chair with her\nback towards them. She was mending with a big needle the holes in an\nold sack, and while she bent over her work she crooned to herself some\nFrench song. Every now and then she raised her eyes, for in front of\nher, under her charge, Mlle. Celie, the girl of whom Hanaud was in\nsearch, lay helpless upon a sofa. The train of her delicate green frock\nswept the floor. She was dressed as Helene Vauquier had described. Her\ngloved hands were tightly bound behind her back, her feet were crossed\nso that she could not have stood, and her ankles were cruelly strapped\ntogether. Over her face and eyes a piece of coarse sacking was\nstretched like a mask, and the ends were roughly sewn together at the\nback of her head. She lay so still that, but for the labouring of her\nbosom and a tremor which now and again shook her limbs, the watchers\nwould have thought her dead. She made no struggle of resistance; she\nlay quiet and still. Once she writhed, but it was with the uneasiness\nof one in pain, and the moment she stirred the old woman's hand went\nout to a bright aluminium flask which stood on a little table at her\nside.\n\n\"Keep quiet, little one!\" she ordered in a careless, chiding voice, and\nshe rapped with the flask peremptorily upon the table. Immediately, as\nthough the tapping had some strange message of terror for the girl's\near, she stiffened her whole body and lay rigid.\n\n\"I am not ready for you yet, little fool,\" said the old woman, and she\nbent again to her work.\n\nRicardo's brain whirled. Here was the girl whom they had come to\narrest, who had sprung from the salon with so much activity of youth\nacross the stretch of grass, who had run so quickly and lightly across\nthe pavement into this very house, so that she should not be seen. And\nnow she was lying in her fine and delicate attire a captive, at the\nmercy of the very people who were her accomplices.\n\nSuddenly a scream rang out in the garden--a shrill, loud scream, close\nbeneath the windows. The old woman sprang to her feet. The girl on the\nsofa raised her head. The old woman took a step towards the window, and\nthen she swiftly turned towards the door. She saw the men upon the\nthreshold. She uttered a bellow of rage. There is no other word to\ndescribe the sound. It was not a human cry; it was the bellow of an\nangry animal. She reached out her hand towards the flask, but before\nshe could grasp it Hanaud seized her. She burst into a torrent of foul\noaths. Hanaud flung her across to Lemerre's officer, who dragged her\nfrom the room.\n\n\"Quick!\" said Hanaud, pointing to the girl, who was now struggling\nhelplessly upon the sofa. \"Mlle. Celie!\"\n\nRicardo cut the stitches of the sacking. Hanaud unstrapped her hands\nand feet. They helped her to sit up. She shook her hands in the air as\nthough they tortured her, and then, in a piteous, whimpering voice,\nlike a child's, she babbled incoherently and whispered prayers.\nSuddenly the prayers ceased. She sat stiff, with eyes fixed and\nstaring. She was watching Lemerre, and she was watching him fascinated\nwith terror. He was holding in his hand the large, bright aluminium\nflask. He poured a little of the contents very carefully on to a piece\nof the sack; and then with an exclamation of anger he turned towards\nHanaud. But Hanaud was supporting Celia; and so, as Lemerre turned\nabruptly towards him with the flask in his hand, he turned abruptly\ntowards Celia too. She wrenched herself from Hanaud's arms, she shrank\nviolently away. Her white face flushed scarlet and grew white again.\nShe screamed loudly, terribly; and after the scream she uttered a\nstrange, weak sigh, and so fell sideways in a swoon. Hanaud caught her\nas she fell. A light broke over his face.\n\n\"Now I understand!\" he cried. \"Good God! That's horrible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIN THE HOUSE AT GENEVA\n\n\nIt was well, Mr. Ricardo thought, that some one understood. For\nhimself, he frankly admitted that he did not. Indeed, in his view the\nfirst principles of reasoning seemed to be set at naught. It was\nobvious from the solicitude with which Celia Harland was surrounded\nthat every one except himself was convinced of her innocence. Yet it\nwas equally obvious that any one who bore in mind the eight points he\nhad tabulated against her must be convinced of her guilt. Yet again, if\nshe were guilty, how did it happen that she had been so mishandled by\nher accomplices? He was not allowed, however, to reflect upon these\nremarkable problems. He had too busy a time of it. At one moment he was\nrunning to fetch water wherewith to bathe Celia's forehead. At another,\nwhen he had returned with the water, he was distracted by the\nappearance of Durette, the inspector from Aix, in the doorway.\n\n\"We have them both,\" he said--\"Hippolyte and the woman. They were\nhiding in the garden.\"\n\n\"So I thought,\" said Hanaud, \"when I saw the door open downstairs, and\nthe morphia-needle on the table.\"\n\nLemerre turned to one of the officers.\n\n\"Let them be taken with old Jeanne in cabs to the depot.\"\n\nAnd when the man had gone upon his errand Lemerre spoke to Hanaud.\n\n\"You will stay here to-night to arrange for their transfer to Aix?\"\n\n\"I will leave Durette behind,\" said Hanaud. \"I am needed at Aix. We\nwill make a formal application for the prisoners.\" He was kneeling by\nCelia's side and awkwardly dabbing her forehead with a wet\nhandkerchief. He raised a warning hand. Celia Harland moved and opened\nher eyes. She sat up on the sofa, shivering, and looked with dazed and\nwondering eyes from one to another of the strangers who surrounded her.\nShe searched in vain for a familiar face.\n\n\"You are amongst good friends, Mlle. Celie,\" said Hanaud with great\ngentleness.\n\n\"Oh, I wonder! I wonder!\" she cried piteously.\n\n\"Be very sure of it,\" he said heartily, and she clung to the sleeve of\nhis coat with desperate hands.\n\n\"I suppose you ARE friends,\" she said; \"else why--?\" and she moved her\nnumbed limbs to make certain that she was free. She looked about the\nroom. Her eyes fell upon the sack and widened with terror.\n\n\"They came to me a little while ago in that cupboard there--Adele and\nthe old woman Jeanne. They made me get up. They told me they were going\nto take me away. They brought my clothes and dressed me in everything I\nwore when I came, so that no single trace of me might be left behind.\nThen they tied me.\" She tore off her gloves and showed them her\nlacerated wrists. \"I think they meant to kill me--horribly.\" And she\ncaught her breath and whimpered like a child. Her spirit was broken.\n\n\"My poor girl, all that is over,\" said Hanaud. And he stood up.\n\nBut at the first movement he made she cried incisively, \"No,\" and\ntightened the clutch of her fingers upon his sleeve.\n\n\"But, mademoiselle, you are safe,\" he said, with a smile. She stared at\nhim stupidly. It seemed the words had no meaning for her. She would not\nlet him go. It was only the feel of his coat within the clutch of her\nfingers which gave her any comfort.\n\n\"I want to be sure that I am safe,\" she said, with a wan little smile.\n\n\"Tell me, mademoiselle, what have you had to eat and drink during the\nlast two days?\"\n\n\"Is it two days?\" she asked. \"I was in the dark there. I did not know.\nA little bread, a little water.\"\n\n\"That's what is wrong,\" said Hanaud. \"Come, let us go from here!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" Celia cried eagerly. She rose to her feet, and tottered.\nHanaud put his arm about her. \"You are very kind,\" she said in a low\nvoice, and again doubt looked out from her face and disappeared. \"I am\nsure that I can trust you.\"\n\nRicardo fetched her cloak and slipped it on her shoulders. Then he\nbrought her hat, and she pinned it on. She turned to Hanaud;\nunconsciously familiar words rose to her lips.\n\n\"Is it straight?\" she asked. And Hanaud laughed outright, and in a\nmoment Celia smiled herself.\n\nSupported by Hanaud she stumbled down the stairs to the garden. As they\npassed the open door of the lighted parlour at the back of the house\nHanaud turned back to Lemerre and pointed silently to the\nmorphia-needle and the phial. Lemerre nodded his head, and going into\nthe room took them away. They went out again into the garden. Celia\nHarland threw back her head to the stars and drew in a deep breath of\nthe cool night air.\n\n\"I did not think,\" she said in a low voice, \"to see the stars again.\"\n\nThey walked slowly down the length of the garden, and Hanaud lifted her\ninto the launch. She turned and caught his coat.\n\n\"You must come too,\" she said stubbornly.\n\nHanaud sprang in beside her.\n\n\"For to-night,\" he said gaily, \"I am your papa!\"\n\nRicardo and the others followed, and the launch moved out over the lake\nunder the stars. The bow was turned towards Geneva, the water tumbled\nbehind them like white fire, the night breeze blew fresh upon their\nfaces. They disembarked at the landing-stage, and then Lemerre bowed to\nCelia and took his leave. Hanaud led Celia up on to the balcony of the\nrestaurant and ordered supper. There were people still dining at the\ntables.\n\nOne party indeed sitting late over their coffee Ricardo recognised with\na kind of shock. They had taken their places, the very places in which\nthey now sat, before he and Hanaud and Lemerre had left the restaurant\nupon their expedition of rescue. Into that short interval of time so\nmuch that was eventful had been crowded.\n\nHanaud leaned across the table to Celia and said in a low voice:\n\n\"Mademoiselle, if I may suggest it, it would be as well if you put on\nyour gloves; otherwise they may notice your wrists.\"\n\nCelia followed his advice. She ate some food and drank a glass of\nchampagne. A little colour returned to her cheeks.\n\n\"You are very kind to me, you and monsieur your friend,\" she said, with\na smile towards Ricardo. \"But for you--\" and her voice shook.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Hanaud--\"all that is over; we will not speak of it.\"\n\nCelia looked out across the road on to the trees, of which the dark\nfoliage was brightened and made pale by the lights of the restaurant.\nOut on the water some one was singing.\n\n\"It seems impossible to me,\" she said in a low voice, \"that I am here,\nin the open air, and free.\"\n\nHanaud looked at his watch.\n\n\"Mlle. Celie, it is past ten o'clock. M. Ricardo's car is waiting there\nunder the trees. I want you to drive back to Aix. I have taken rooms\nfor you at an hotel, and there will be a nurse from the hospital to\nlook after you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur,\" she said; \"you have thought of everything. But I\nshall not need a nurse.\"\n\n\"But you will have a nurse,\" said Hanaud firmly. \"You feel stronger\nnow--yes, but when you lay your head upon your pillow, mademoiselle, it\nwill be a comfort to you to know that you have her within call. And in\na day or two,\" he added gently, \"you will perhaps be able to tell us\nwhat happened on Tuesday night at the Villa Rose?\"\n\nCelia covered her face with her hands for a few moments. Then she drew\nthem away and said simply:\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I will tell you.\"\n\nHanaud bowed to her with a genuine deference.\n\n\"Thank you, mademoiselle,\" he said, and in his voice there was a strong\nring of sympathy.\n\nThey went downstairs and entered Ricardo's motor car.\n\n\"I want to send a telephone message,\" said Hanaud, \"if you will wait\nhere.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Celia decisively, and she again laid hold of his coat, with\na pretty imperiousness, as though he belonged to her.\n\n\"But I must,\" said Hanaud with a laugh.\n\n\"Then I will come too,\" said Celia, and she opened the door and set a\nfoot upon the step.\n\n\"You will not, mademoiselle,\" said Hanaud, with a laugh. \"Will you take\nyour foot back into that car? That is better. Now you will sit with\nyour friend, M. Ricardo, whom, by the way, I have not yet introduced to\nyou. He is a very good friend of yours, mademoiselle, and will in the\nfuture be a still better one.\"\n\nRicardo felt his conscience rather heavy within him, for he had come\nout to Geneva with the fixed intention of arresting her as a most\ndangerous criminal. Even now he could not understand how she could be\ninnocent of a share in Mme. Dauvray's murder. But Hanaud evidently\nthought she was. And since Hanaud thought so, why, it was better to say\nnothing if one was sensitive to gibes. So Ricardo sat and talked with\nher while Hanaud ran back into the restaurant. It mattered very little,\nhowever, what he said, for Celia's eyes were fixed upon the doorway\nthrough which Hanaud had disappeared. And when he came back she was\nquick to turn the handle of the door.\n\n\"Now, mademoiselle, we will wrap you up in M. Ricardo's spare\nmotor-coat and cover your knees with a rug and put you between us, and\nthen you can go to sleep.\"\n\nThe car sped through the streets of Geneva. Celia Harland, with a\nlittle sigh of relief, nestled down between the two men.\n\n\"If I knew you better,\" she said to Hanaud, \"I should tell you--what,\nof course, I do not tell you now--that I feel as if I had a big\nNewfoundland dog with me.\"\n\n\"Mlle. Celie,\" said Hanaud, and his voice told her that he was moved,\n\"that is a very pretty thing which you have said to me.\"\n\nThe lights of the city fell away behind them. Now only a glow in the\nsky spoke of Geneva; now even that was gone and with a smooth\ncontinuous purr the car raced through the cool darkness. The great head\nlamps threw a bright circle of light before them and the road slipped\naway beneath the wheels like a running tide. Celia fell asleep. Even\nwhen the car stopped at the Pont de La Caille she did not waken. The\ndoor was opened, a search for contraband was made, the book was signed,\nstill she did not wake. The car sped on.\n\n\"You see, coming into France is a different affair,\" said Hanaud.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ricardo.\n\n\"Still, I will own it, you caught me napping yesterday.\n\n\"I did?\" exclaimed Ricardo joyfully.\n\n\"You did,\" returned Hanaud. \"I had never heard of the Pont de La\nCaille. But you will not mention it? You will not ruin me?\"\n\n\"I will not,\" answered M. Ricardo, superb in his magnanimity. \"You are\na good detective.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you! thank you!\" cried Hanaud in a voice which shook--surely\nwith emotion. He wrung Ricardo's hand. He wiped an imaginary tear from\nhis eye.\n\nAnd still Celia slept. M. Ricardo looked at her. He said to Hanaud in a\nwhisper:\n\n\"Yet I do not understand. The car, though no serious search was made,\nmust still have stopped at the Pont de La Caille on the Swiss side. Why\ndid she not cry for help then? One cry and she was safe. A movement\neven was enough. Do you understand?\"\n\nHanaud nodded his head.\n\n\"I think so,\" he answered, with a very gentle look at Celia. \"Yes, I\nthink so.\"\n\nWhen Celia was aroused she found that the car had stopped before the\ndoor of an hotel, and that a woman in the dress of a nurse was standing\nin the doorway.\n\n\"You can trust Marie,\" said Hanaud. And Celia turned as she stood upon\nthe ground and gave her hands to the two men.\n\n\"Thank you! Thank you both!\" she said in a trembling voice. She looked\nat Hanaud and nodded her head. \"You understand why I thank you so very\nmuch?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hanaud. \"But, mademoiselle\"--and he bent over the car and\nspoke to her quietly, holding her hand--\"there is ALWAYS a big\nNewfoundland dog in the worst of troubles--if only you will look for\nhim. I tell you so--I, who belong to the Surete in Paris. Do not lose\nheart!\" And in his mind he added: \"God forgive me for the lie.\" He\nshook her hand and let it go; and gathering up her skirt she went into\nthe hall of the hotel.\n\nHanaud watched her as she went. She was to him a lonely and pathetic\ncreature, in spite of the nurse who bore her company.\n\n\"You must be a good friend to that young girl, M. Ricardo,\" he said.\n\"Let us drive to your hotel.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ricardo. And as they went the curiosity which all the way\nfrom Geneva had been smouldering within him burst into flame.\n\n\"Will you explain to me one thing?\" he asked. \"When the scream came\nfrom the garden you were not surprised. Indeed, you said that when you\nsaw the open door and the morphia-needle on the table of the little\nroom downstairs you thought Adele and the man Hippolyte were hiding in\nthe garden.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did think so.\"\n\n\"Why? And why did the publication that the jewels had been discovered\nso alarm you?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Hanaud. \"Did not you understand that? Yet it is surely clear\nand obvious, if you once grant that the girl was innocent, was a\nwitness of the crime, and was now in the hands of the criminals. Grant\nme those premisses, M. Ricardo, for a moment, and you will see that we\nhad just one chance of finding the girl alive in Geneva. From the first\nI was sure of that. What was the one chance? Why, this! She might be\nkept alive on the chance that she could be forced to tell what, by the\nway, she did not know, namely, the place where Mme. Dauvray's valuable\njewels were secreted. Now, follow this. We, the police, find the jewels\nand take charge of them. Let that news reach the house in Geneva, and\non the same night Mlle. Celie loses her life, and not--very pleasantly.\nThey have no further use for her. She is merely a danger to them. So I\ntake my precautions--never mind for the moment what they were. I take\ncare that if the murderer is in Aix and gets wind of our discovery he\nshall not be able to communicate his news.\"\n\n\"The Post Office would have stopped letters or telegrams,\" said\nRicardo. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Hanaud. \"No, I took my precautions, which\nwere of quite a different kind, before I knew the house in Geneva or\nthe name of Rossignol. But one way of communication I did not think of.\nI did not think of the possibility that the news might be sent to a\nnewspaper, which of course would publish it and cry it through the\nstreets of Geneva. The moment I heard the news I knew we must hurry.\nThe garden of the house ran down to the lake. A means of disposing of\nMlle. Celie was close at hand. And the night had fallen. As it was, we\narrived just in time, and no earlier than just in time. The paper had\nbeen bought, the message had reached the house, Mlle. Celie was no\nlonger of any use, and every hour she stayed in that house was of\ncourse an hour of danger to her captors.\"\n\n\"What were they going to do?\" asked Ricardo.\n\nHanaud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It is not pretty--what they were going to do. We reach the garden in\nour launch. At that moment Hippolyte and Adele, who is most likely\nHippolyte's wife, are in the lighted parlour on the basement floor.\nAdele is preparing her morphia-needle. Hippolyte is going to get ready\nthe rowing-boat which was tied at the end of the landing-stage. Quietly\nas we came into the bank, they heard or saw us. They ran out and hid in\nthe garden, having no time to lock the garden door, or perhaps not\ndaring to lock it lest the sound of the key should reach our ears. We\nfind that door upon the latch, the door of the room open; on the table\nlies the morphia-needle. Upstairs lies Mlle. Celie--she is helpless,\nshe cannot see what they are meaning to do.\"\n\n\"But she could cry out,\" exclaimed Ricardo. \"She did not even do that!\"\n\n\"No, my friend, she could not cry out,\" replied Hanaud very seriously.\n\"I know why. She could not. No living man or woman could. Rest assured\nof that!\"\n\nRicardo was mystified; but since the captain of the ship would not show\nhis observation, he knew it would be in vain to press him.\n\n\"Well, while Adele was preparing her morphia-needle and Hippolyte was\nabout to prepare the boat, Jeanne upstairs was making her preparation\ntoo. She was mending a sack. Did you see Mlle. Celie's eyes and face\nwhen first she saw that sack? Ah! she understood! They meant to give\nher a dose of morphia, and, as soon as she became unconscious, they\nwere going perhaps to take some terrible precaution--\" Hanaud paused\nfor a second. \"I only say perhaps as to that. But certainly they were\ngoing to sew her up in that sack, row her well out across the lake, fix\na weight to her feet, and drop her quietly overboard. She was to wear\neverything which she had brought with her to the house. Mlle. Celie\nwould have disappeared for ever, and left not even a ripple upon the\nwater to trace her by!\"\n\nRicardo clenched his hands.\n\n\"But that's horrible!\" he cried; and as he uttered the words the car\nswerved into the drive and stopped before the door of the Hotel\nMajestic.\n\nRicardo sprang out. A feeling of remorse seized hold of him. All\nthrough that evening he had not given one thought to Harry Wethermill,\nso utterly had the excitement of each moment engrossed his mind.\n\n\"He will be glad to know!\" cried Ricardo. \"To-night, at all events, he\nshall sleep. I ought to have telegraphed to him from Geneva that we and\nMiss Celia were coming back.\" He ran up the steps into the hotel.\n\n\"I took care that he should know,\" said Hanaud, as he followed in\nRicardo's steps.\n\n\"Then the message could not have reached him, else he would have been\nexpecting us,\" replied Ricardo, as he hurried into the office, where a\nclerk sat at his books.\n\n\"Is Mr. Wethermill in?\" he asked.\n\nThe clerk eyed him strangely.\n\n\"Mr. Wethermill was arrested this evening,\" he said.\n\nRicardo stepped back.\n\n\"Arrested! When?\"\n\n\"At twenty-five minutes past ten,\" replied the clerk shortly.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Hanaud quietly. \"That was my telephone message.\"\n\nRicardo stared in stupefaction at his companion.\n\n\"Arrested!\" he cried. \"Arrested! But what for?\"\n\n\"For the murders of Marthe Gobin and Mme. Dauvray,\" said Hanaud.\n\"Good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMR. RICARDO IS BEWILDERED\n\n\nRicardo passed a most tempestuous night. He was tossed amongst dark\nproblems. Now it was Harry Wethermill who beset him. He repeated and\nrepeated the name, trying to grasp the new and sinister suggestion\nwhich, if Hanaud were right, its sound must henceforth bear. Of course\nHanaud might be wrong. Only, if he were wrong, how had he come to\nsuspect Harry Wethermill? What had first directed his thoughts to that\nseemingly heart-broken man? And when? Certain recollections became\nvivid in Mr. Ricardo's mind--the luncheon at the Villa Rose, for\ninstance. Hanaud had been so insistent that the woman with the red hair\nwas to be found in Geneva, had so clearly laid it down that a message,\na telegram, a letter from Aix to Geneva, would enable him to lay his\nhands upon the murderer in Aix. He was isolating the house in Geneva\neven so early in the history of his investigations, even so soon he\nsuspected Harry Wethermill. Brains and audacity--yes, these two\nqualities he had stipulated in the criminal. Ricardo now for the first\ntime understood the trend of all Hanaud's talk at that luncheon. He was\nputting Harry Wethermill upon his guard, he was immobilising him, he\nwas fettering him in precautions; with a subtle skill he was forcing\nhim to isolate himself. And he was doing it deliberately to save the\nlife of Celia Harland in Geneva. Once Ricardo lifted himself up with\nthe hair stirring on his scalp. He himself had been with Wethermill in\nthe baccarat-rooms on the very night of the murder. They had walked\ntogether up the hill to the hotel. It could not be that Harry\nWethermill was guilty. And yet, he suddenly remembered, they had\ntogether left the rooms at an early hour. It was only ten o'clock when\nthey had separated in the hall, when they had gone, each to his own\nroom. There would have been time for Wethermill to reach the Villa Rose\nand do his dreadful work upon that night before twelve, if all had been\narranged beforehand, if all went as it had been arranged. And as he\nthought upon the careful planning of that crime, and remembered\nWethermill's easy chatter as they had strolled from table to table in\nthe Villa des Fleurs, Ricardo shuddered. Though he encouraged a taste\nfor the bizarre, it was with an effort. He was naturally of an orderly\nmind, and to touch the eerie or inhuman caused him a physical\ndiscomfort. So now he marvelled in a great uneasiness at the calm\nplacidity with which Wethermill had talked, his arm in his, while the\nload of so dark a crime to be committed within the hour lay upon his\nmind. Each minute he must have been thinking, with a swift spasm of the\nheart, \"Should such a precaution fail--should such or such an\nunforeseen thing intervene,\" yet there had been never a sign of\ndisturbance, never a hint of any disquietude.\n\nThen Ricardo's thoughts turned as he tossed upon his bed to Celia\nHarland, a tragic and a lonely figure. He recalled the look of\ntenderness upon her face when her eyes had met Harry Wethermill's\nacross the baccarat-table in the Villa des Fleurs. He gained some\ninsight into the reason why she had clung so desperately to Hanaud's\ncoat-sleeve yesterday. Not merely had he saved her life. She was lying\nwith all her world of trust and illusion broken about her, and Hanaud\nhad raised her up. She had found some one whom she trusted--the big\nNewfoundland dog, as she expressed it. Mr. Ricardo was still thinking\nof Celia Harland when the morning came. He fell asleep, and awoke to\nfind Hanaud by his bed.\n\n\"You will be wanted to-day,\" said Hanaud.\n\nRicardo got up and walked down from the hotel with the detective. The\nfront door faces the hillside of Mont Revard, and on this side Mr.\nRicardo's rooms looked out. The drive from the front door curves round\nthe end of the long building and joins the road, which then winds down\ntowards the town past the garden at the back of the hotel. Down this\nroad the two men walked, while the supporting wall of the garden upon\ntheir right hand grew higher and higher above their heads. They came to\na steep flight of steps which makes a short cut from the hotel to the\nroad, and at the steps Hanaud stopped.\n\n\"Do you see?\" he said. \"On the opposite side there are no houses; there\nis only a wall. Behind the wall there are climbing gardens and the\nground falls steeply to the turn of the road below. There's a flight of\nsteps leading down which corresponds with the flight of steps from the\ngarden. Very often there's a SERJENT-DE-VILLE stationed on the top of\nthe steps. But there was not one there yesterday afternoon at three.\nBehind us is the supporting wall of the hotel garden. Well, look about\nyou. We cannot be seen from the hotel. There's not a soul in\nsight--yes, there's some one coming up the hill, but we have been\nstanding here quite long enough for you to stab me and get back to your\ncoffee on the verandah of the hotel.\"\n\nRicardo started back.\n\n\"Marthe Gobin!\" he cried. \"It was here, then?\"\n\nHanaud nodded.\n\n\"When we returned from the station in your motor-car and went up to\nyour rooms we passed Harry Wethermill sitting upon the verandah over\nthe garden drinking his coffee. He had the news then that Marthe Gobin\nwas on her way.\"\n\n\"But you had isolated the house in Geneva. How could he have the news?\"\nexclaimed Ricardo, whose brain was whirling.\n\n\"I had isolated the house from him, in the sense that he dared not\ncommunicate with his accomplices. That is what you have to remember. He\ncould not even let them know that they must not communicate with him.\nSo he received a telegram. It was carefully worded. No doubt he had\narranged the wording of any message with the care which was used in all\nthe preparations. It ran like this\"--and Hanaud took a scrap of paper\nfrom his pocket and read out from it a copy of the telegram: \"'Agent\narrives Aix 3.7 to negotiate purchase of your patent.' The telegram was\nhanded in at Geneva station at 12.45, five minutes after the train had\nleft which carried Marthe Gobin to Aix. And more, it was handed in by a\nman strongly resembling Hippolyte Tace--that we know.\"\n\n\"That was madness,\" said Ricardo.\n\n\"But what else could they do over there in Geneva? They did not know\nthat Harry Wethermill was suspected. Harry Wethermill had no idea of it\nhimself. But, even if they had known, they must take the risk. Put\nyourself into their place for a moment. They had seen my advertisement\nabout Celie Harland in the Geneva paper. Marthe Gobin, that busybody\nwho was always watching her neighbours, was no doubt watched herself.\nThey see her leave the house, an unusual proceeding for her with her\nhusband ill, as her own letter tells us. Hippolyte follows her to the\nstation, sees her take her ticket to Aix and mount into the train. He\nmust guess at once that she saw Celie Harland enter their house, that\nshe is travelling to Aix with the information of her whereabouts. At\nall costs she must be prevented from giving that information. At all\nrisks, therefore, the warning telegram must be sent to Harry\nWethermill.\"\n\nRicardo recognised the force of the argument.\n\n\"If only you had heard of the telegram yesterday in time!\" he cried.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" Hanaud agreed. \"But it was only sent off at a quarter to\none. It was delivered to Wethermill and a copy was sent to the\nPrefecture, but the telegram was delivered first.\"\n\n\"When was it delivered to Wethermill?\" asked Ricardo.\n\n\"At three. We had already left for the station. Wethermill was sitting\non the verandah. The telegram was brought to him there. It was brought\nby a waiter in the hotel who remembers the incident very well.\nWethermill has seven minutes and the time it will take for Marthe Gobin\nto drive from the station to the Majestic. What does he do? He runs up\nfirst to your rooms, very likely not yet knowing what he must do. He\nruns up to verify his telegram.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\" cried Ricardo. \"How can you be? You were at the\nstation with me. What makes you sure?\"\n\nHanaud produced a brown kid glove from his pocket.\n\n\"This.\"\n\n\"That is your glove; you told me so yesterday.\"\n\n\"I told you so,\" replied Hanaud calmly; \"but it is not my glove. It is\nWethermill's; there are his initials stamped upon the lining--see? I\npicked up that glove in your room, after we had returned from the\nstation. It was not there before. He went to your rooms. No doubt he\nsearched for a telegram. Fortunately he did not examine your letters,\nor Marthe Gobin would never have spoken to us as she did after she was\ndead.\"\n\n\"Then what did he do?\" asked Ricardo eagerly; and, though Hanaud had\nbeen with him at the entrance to the station all this while, he asked\nthe question in absolute confidence that the true answer would be given\nto him.\n\n\"He returned to the verandah wondering what he should do. He saw us\ncome back from the station in the motor-car and go up to your room. We\nwere alone. Marthe Gobin, then, was following. There was his chance.\nMarthe Gobin must not reach us, must not tell her news to us. He ran\ndown the garden steps to the gate. No one could see him from the hotel.\nVery likely he hid behind the trees, whence he could watch the road. A\ncab comes up the hill; there's a woman in it--not quite the kind of\nwoman who stays at your hotel, M. Ricardo. Yet she must be going to\nyour hotel, for the road ends. The driver is nodding on his box,\nrefusing to pay any heed to his fare lest again she should bid him\nhurry. His horse is moving at a walk. Wethermill puts his head in at\nthe window and asks if she has come to see M. Ricardo. Anxious for her\nfour thousand francs, she answers 'Yes.' Perhaps he steps into the cab,\nperhaps as he walks by the side he strikes, and strikes hard and\nstrikes surely. Long before the cab reaches the hotel he is back again\non the verandah.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ricardo, \"it's the daring of which you spoke which made the\ncrime possible--the same daring which made him seek your help. That was\nunexampled.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Hanaud. \"There's an historic crime in your own country,\nmonsieur. Cries for help were heard in a by-street of a town. When\npeople ran to answer them, a man was found kneeling by a corpse. It was\nthe kneeling man who cried for help, but it was also the kneeling man\nwho did the murder. I remembered that when I first began to suspect\nHarry Wethermill.\"\n\nRicardo turned eagerly.\n\n\"And when--when did you first begin to suspect Harry Wethermill?\"\n\nHanaud smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"That you shall know in good time. I am the captain of the ship.\" His\nvoice took on a deeper note. \"But I prepare you. Listen! Daring and\nbrains, those were the property of Harry Wethermill--yes. But it is not\nhe who is the chief actor in the crime. Of that I am sure. He was no\nmore than one of the instruments.\"\n\n\"One of the instruments? Used, then, by whom?\" asked Ricardo.\n\n\"By my Normandy peasant-woman, M. Ricardo,\" said Hanaud. \"Yes, there's\nthe dominating figure--cruel, masterful, relentless--that strange\nwoman, Helene Vauquier. You are surprised? You will see! It is not the\nman of intellect and daring; it's my peasant-woman who is at the bottom\nof it all.\"\n\n\"But she's free!\" exclaimed Ricardo. \"You let her go free!\"\n\n\"Free!\" repeated Ricardo. \"She was driven straight from the Villa Rose\nto the depot. She has been kept AU SECRET ever since.\"\n\nRicardo stared in amazement.\n\n\"Already you knew of her guilt?\"\n\n\"Already she had lied to me in her description of Adele Rossignol. Do\nyou remember what she said--a black-haired woman with beady eyes; and I\nonly five minutes before had picked up from the table--this.\"\n\nHe opened his pocket-book, and took from an envelope a long strand of\nred hair.\n\n\"But it was not only because she lied that I had her taken to the\ndepot. A pot of cold cream had disappeared from the room of Mlle. Celie.\"\n\n\"Then Perrichet after all was right.\"\n\n\"Perrichet after all was quite wrong--not to hold his tongue. For in\nthat pot of cold cream, as I was sure, were hidden those valuable\ndiamond earrings which Mlle. Celie habitually wore.\"\n\nThe two men had reached the square in front of the Etablissement des\nBains. Ricardo dropped on to a bench and wiped his forehead.\n\n\"But I am in a maze,\" he cried. \"My head turns round. I don't know\nwhere I am.\"\n\nHanaud stood in front of Ricardo, smiling. He was not displeased with\nhis companion's bewilderment; it was all so much of tribute to himself.\n\n\"I am the captain of the ship,\" he said.\n\nHis smile irritated Ricardo, who spoke impatiently.\n\n\"I should be very glad,\" he said, \"if you would tell me how you\ndiscovered all these things. And what it was that the little salon on\nthe first morning had to tell to you? And why Celia Harland ran from\nthe glass doors across the grass to the motor-car and again from the\ncarriage into the house on the lake? Why she did not resist yesterday\nevening? Why she did not cry for help? How much of Helene Vauquier's\nevidence was true and how much false? For what reason Wethermill\nconcerned himself in this affair? Oh! and a thousand things which I\ndon't understand.\"\n\n\"Ah, the cushions, and the scrap of paper, and the aluminium flask,\"\nsaid Hanaud; and the triumph faded from his face. He spoke now to\nRicardo with a genuine friendliness. \"You must not be angry with me if\nI keep you in the dark for a little while. I, too, Mr. Ricardo, have\nartistic inclinations. I will not spoil the remarkable story which I\nthink Mlle. Celie will be ready to tell us. Afterwards I will willingly\nexplain to you what I read in the evidences of the room, and what so\ngreatly puzzled me then. But it is not the puzzle or its solution,\" he\nsaid modestly, \"which is most interesting here. Consider the people.\nMme. Dauvray, the old, rich, ignorant woman, with her superstitions and\nher generosity, her desire to converse with Mme. de Montespan and the\ngreat ladies of the past, and her love of a young, fresh face about\nher; Helene Vauquier, the maid with her six years of confidential\nservice, who finds herself suddenly supplanted and made to tend and\ndress in dainty frocks the girl who has supplanted her; the young girl\nherself, that poor child, with her love of fine clothes, the Bohemian\nwho, brought up amidst trickeries and practising them as a profession,\nlooking upon them and upon misery and starvation and despair as the\ncommonplaces of life, keeps a simplicity and a delicacy and a freshness\nwhich would have withered in a day had she been brought up otherwise;\nHarry Wethermill, the courted and successful man of genius.\n\n\"Just imagine if you can what his feelings must have been, when in Mme.\nDauvray's bedroom, with the woman he had uselessly murdered lying rigid\nbeneath the sheet, he saw me raise the block of wood from the inlaid\nfloor and take out one by one those jewel cases for which less than\ntwelve hours before he had been ransacking that very room. But what he\nmust have felt! And to give no sign! Oh, these people are the\ninteresting problems in this story. Let us hear what happened on that\nterrible night. The puzzle--that can wait.\" In Mr. Ricardo's view\nHanaud was proved right. The extraordinary and appalling story which\nwas gradually unrolled of what had happened on that night of Tuesday in\nthe Villa Rose exceeded in its grim interest all the mystery of the\npuzzle. But it was not told at once.\n\nThe trouble at first with Mlle. Celie was a fear of sleep. She dared\nnot sleep--even with a light in the room and a nurse at her bedside.\nWhen her eyes were actually closing she would force herself desperately\nback into the living world. For when she slept she dreamed through\nagain that dark and dreadful night of Tuesday and the two days which\nfollowed it, until at some moment endurance snapped and she woke up\nscreaming. But youth, a good constitution, and a healthy appetite had\ntheir way with her in the end.\n\nShe told her share of the story--she told what happened. There was\napparently one terrible scene when she was confronted with Harry\nWethermill in the office of Monsieur Fleuriot, the Juge d'instruction,\nand on her knees, with the tears streaming down her face, besought him\nto confess the truth. For a long while he held out. And then there came\na strange and human turn to the affair. Adele Rossignol--or, to give\nher real name, Adele Tace, the wife of Hippolyte--had conceived a\nveritable passion for Harry Wethermill. He was of a not uncommon type,\ncold and callous in himself, yet with the power to provoke passion in\nwomen. And Adele Tace, as the story was told of how Harry Wethermill\nhad paid his court to Celia Harland, was seized with a vindictive\njealousy. Hanaud was not surprised. He knew the woman-criminal of his\ncountry--brutal, passionate, treacherous. The anonymous letters in a\nwoman's handwriting which descend upon the Rue de Jerusalem, and betray\nthe men who have committed thefts, had left him no illusions upon that\nfigure in the history of crime. Adele Rossignol ran forward to confess,\nso that Harry Wethermill might suffer to the last possible point of\nsuffering. Then at last Wethermill gave in and, broken down by the\nceaseless interrogations of the magistrate, confessed in his turn too.\nThe one, and the only one, who stood firmly throughout and denied the\ncrime was Helene Vauquier. Her thin lips were kept contemptuously\nclosed, whatever the others might admit. With a white, hard face,\nquietly and respectfully she faced the magistrate week after week. She\nwas the perfect picture of a servant who knew her place. And nothing\nwas wrung from her. But without her help the story became complete. And\nRicardo was at pains to write it out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nCELIA'S STORY\n\n\nThe story begins with the explanation of that circumstance which had\ngreatly puzzled Mr. Ricardo--Celia's entry into the household of Mme.\nDauvray.\n\nCelia's father was a Captain Harland, of a marching regiment, who had\nlittle beyond good looks and excellent manners wherewith to support his\nposition. He was extravagant in his tastes, and of an easy mind in the\npresence of embarrassments. To his other disadvantages he added that of\nfalling in love with a pretty girl no better off than himself. They\nmarried, and Celia was born. For nine years they managed, through the\nwife's constant devotion, to struggle along and to give their daughter\nan education. Then, however, Celia's mother broke down under the strain\nand died. Captain Harland, a couple of years later, went out of the\nservice with discredit, passed through the bankruptcy court, and turned\nshowman. His line was thought-reading; he enlisted the services of his\ndaughter, taught her the tricks of his trade, and became \"The Great\nFortinbras\" of the music-halls. Captain Harland would move amongst the\naudience, asking the spectators in a whisper to think of a number or of\nan article in their pockets, after the usual fashion, while the child,\nin her short frock, with her long fair hair tied back with a ribbon,\nwould stand blind-folded upon the platform and reel off the answers\nwith astonishing rapidity. She was singularly quick, singularly\nreceptive.\n\nThe undoubted cleverness of the performance, and the beauty of the\nchild, brought to them a temporary prosperity. The Great Fortinbras\nrose from the music-halls to the assembly rooms of provincial towns.\nThe performance became genteel, and ladies flocked to the matinees.\n\nThe Great Fortinbras dropped his pseudonym and became once more Captain\nHarland.\n\nAs Celia grew up, he tried a yet higher flight--he became a\nspiritualist, with Celia for his medium. The thought-reading\nentertainments became thrilling seances, and the beautiful child, now\ngrown into a beautiful girl of seventeen, created a greater sensation\nas a medium in a trance than she had done as a lightning thought-reader.\n\n\"I saw no harm in it,\" Celia explained to M. Fleuriot, without any\nattempt at extenuation. \"I never understood that we might be doing any\nhurt to any one. People were interested. They were to find us out if\nthey could, and they tried to and they couldn't. I looked upon it quite\nsimply in that way. It was just my profession. I accepted it without\nany question. I was not troubled about it until I came to Aix.\"\n\nA startling exposure, however, at Cambridge discredited the craze for\nspiritualism, and Captain Harland's fortunes declined. He crossed with\nhis daughter to France and made a disastrous tour in that country,\nwasted the last of his resources in the Casino at Dieppe, and died in\nthat town, leaving Celia just enough money to bury him and to pay her\nthird-class fare to Paris.\n\nThere she lived honestly but miserably. The slimness of her figure and\na grace of movement which was particularly hers obtained her at last a\nsituation as a mannequin in the show-rooms of a modiste. She took a\nroom on the top floor of a house in the Rue St. Honore and settled down\nto a hard and penurious life.\n\n\"I was not happy or contented--no,\" said Celia frankly and decisively.\n\"The long hours in the close rooms gave me headaches and made me\nnervous. I had not the temperament. And I was very lonely--my life had\nbeen so different. I had had fresh air, good clothes, and freedom. Now\nall was changed. I used to cry myself to sleep up in my little room,\nwondering whether I would ever have friends. You see, I was quite\nyoung--only eighteen--and I wanted to live.\"\n\nA change came in a few months, but a disastrous change. The modiste\nfailed. Celia was thrown out of work, and could get nothing to do.\nGradually she pawned what clothes she could spare; and then there came\na morning when she had a single five-franc piece in the world and owed\na month's rent for her room. She kept the five-franc piece all day and\nwent hungry, seeking for work. In the evening she went to a provision\nshop to buy food, and the man behind the counter took the five-franc\npiece. He looked at it, rung it on the counter, and, with a laugh, bent\nit easily in half.\n\n\"See here, my little one,\" he said, tossing the coin back to her, \"one\ndoes not buy good food with lead.\"\n\nCelia dragged herself out of the shop in despair. She was starving. She\ndared not go back to her room. The thought of the concierge at the\nbottom of the stairs, insistent for the rent, frightened her. She stood\non the pavement and burst into tears. A few people stopped and watched\nher curiously, and went on again. Finally a sergent-de-ville told her\nto go away.\n\nThe girl moved on with the tears running down her cheeks. She was\ndesperate, she was lonely.\n\n\"I thought of throwing myself into the Seine,\" said Celia simply, in\ntelling her story to the Juge d'Instruction. \"Indeed, I went to the\nriver. But the water looked so cold, so terrible, and I was young. I\nwanted so much to live. And then--the night came, and the lights made\nthe city bright, and I was very tired and--and--\"\n\nAnd, in a word, the young girl went up to Montmartre in desperation, as\nquickly as her tired legs would carry her. She walked once or twice\ntimidly past the restaurants, and, finally, entered one of them, hoping\nthat some one would take pity on her and give her some supper. She\nstood just within the door of the supper-room. People pushed past\nher--men in evening dress, women in bright frocks and jewels. No one\nnoticed her. She had shrunk into a corner, rather hoping not to be\nnoticed, now that she had come. But the novelty of her surroundings\nwore off. She knew that for want of food she was almost fainting. There\nwere two girls engaged by the management to dance amongst the tables\nwhile people had supper--one dressed as a page in blue satin, and the\nother as a Spanish dancer. Both girls were kind. They spoke to Celia\nbetween their dances. They let her waltz with them. Still no one\nnoticed her. She had no jewels, no fine clothes, no CHIC--the three\nindispensable things. She had only youth and a pretty face.\n\n\"But,\" said Celia, \"without jewels and fine clothes and CHIC these go\nfor nothing in Paris. At last, however, Mme. Dauvray came in with a\nparty of friends from a theatre, and saw how unhappy I was, and gave me\nsome supper. She asked me about myself, and I told her. She was very\nkind, and took me home with her, and I cried all the way in the\ncarriage. She kept me a few days, and then she told me that I was to\nlive with her, for often she was lonely too, and that if I would she\nwould some day find me a nice, comfortable husband and give me a\nmarriage portion. So all my troubles seemed to be at an end,\" said\nCelia, with a smile.\n\nWithin a fortnight Mme. Dauvray confided to Celia that there was a new\nfortune-teller come to Paris, who, by looking into a crystal, could\ntell the most wonderful things about the future. The old woman's eyes\nkindled as she spoke. She took Celia to the fortune-teller's rooms next\nday, and the girl quickly understood the ruling passion of the woman\nwho had befriended her. It took very little time then for Celia to\nnotice how easily Mme. Dauvray was duped, how perpetually she was\nrobbed. Celia turned the problem over in her mind.\n\n\"Madame had been very good to me. She was kind and simple,\" said Celia,\nwith a very genuine affection in her voice. \"The people whom we knew\nlaughed at her, and were ungenerous. But there are many women whom the\nworld respects who are worse than ever was poor Mme. Dauvray. I was\nvery fond of her, so I proposed to her that we should hold a seance,\nand I would bring people from the spirit world I knew that I could\namuse her with something much more clever and more interesting than the\nfortune-tellers. And at the same time I could save her from being\nplundered. That was all I thought about.\"\n\nThat was all she thought about, yes. She left Helene Vauquier out of\nher calculations, and she did not foresee the effect of her seances\nupon Mme. Dauvray. Celia had no suspicions of Helene Vauquier. She\nwould have laughed if any one had told her that this respectable and\nrespectful middle-aged woman, who was so attentive, so neat, so\ngrateful for any kindness, was really nursing a rancorous hatred\nagainst her. Celia had sprung from Montmartre suddenly; therefore\nHelene Vauquier despised her. Celia had taken her place in Mme.\nDauvray's confidence, had deposed her unwittingly, had turned the\nconfidential friend into a mere servant; therefore Helene Vauquier\nhated her. And her hatred reached out beyond the girl, and embraced the\nold, superstitious, foolish woman, whom a young and pretty face could\nso easily beguile. Helene Vauquier despised them both, hated them both,\nand yet must nurse her rancour in silence and futility. Then came the\nseances, and at once, to add fuel to her hatred, she found herself\nstripped of those gifts and commissions which she had exacted from the\nherd of common tricksters who had been wont to make their harvest out\nof Mme. Dauvray. Helene Vauquier was avaricious and greedy, like so\nmany of her class. Her hatred of Celia, her contempt for Mme. Dauvray,\ngrew into a very delirium. But it was a delirium she had the cunning to\nconceal. She lived at white heat, but to all the world she had lost\nnothing of her calm.\n\nCelia did not foresee the hatred she was arousing; nor, on the other\nhand, did she foresee the overwhelming effect of these spiritualistic\nseances on Mme. Dauvray. Celia had never been brought quite close to\nthe credulous before.\n\n\"There had always been the row of footlights,\" she said. \"I was on the\nplatform; the audience was in the hall; or, if it was at a house, my\nfather made the arrangements. I only came in at the last moment, played\nmy part, and went away. It was never brought home to me that some\namongst these people really and truly believed. I did not think about\nit. Now, however, when I saw Mme. Dauvray so feverish, so excited, so\nfirmly convinced that great ladies from the spirit world came and spoke\nto her, I became terrified. I had aroused a passion which I had not\nsuspected. I tried to stop the seances, but I was not allowed. I had\naroused a passion which I could not control. I was afraid that Mme.\nDauvray's whole life--it seems absurd to those who did not know her,\nbut those who did will understand--yes, her whole life and happiness\nwould be spoilt if she discovered that what she believed in was all a\ntrick.\"\n\nShe spoke with a simplicity and a remorse which it was difficult to\ndisbelieve. M. Fleuriot, the judge, now at last convinced that the\nDreyfus affair was for nothing in the history of this crime, listened\nto her with sympathy.\n\n\"That is your explanation, mademoiselle,\" he said gently. \"But I must\ntell you that we have another.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur?\" Celia asked.\n\n\"Given by Helene Vauquier,\" said Fleuriot.\n\nEven after these days Celia could not hear that woman's name without a\nshudder of fear and a flinching of her whole body. Her face grew white,\nher lips dry.\n\n\"I know, monsieur, that Helene Vauquier is not my friend,\" she said. \"I\nwas taught that very cruelly.\"\n\n\"Listen, mademoiselle, to what she says,\" said the judge, and he read\nout to Celia an extract or two from Hanaud's report of his first\ninterview with Helene Vauquier in her bedroom at the Villa Rose.\n\n\"You hear what she says. 'Mme. Dauvray would have had seances all day,\nbut Mlle. Celie pleaded that she was left exhausted at the end of them.\nBut Mlle. Celie was of an address.' And again, speaking of Mme.\nDauvray's queer craze that the spirit of Mme. de Montespan should be\ncalled up, Helene Vauquier says: 'She was never gratified. Always she\nhoped. Always Mlle. Celie tantalised her with the hope. She would not\nspoil her fine affairs by making these treats too common.' Thus she\nattributes your reluctance to multiply your experiments to a desire to\nmake the most profit possible out of your wares, like a good business\nwoman.\"\n\n\"It is not true, monsieur,\" cried Celia earnestly. \"I tried to stop the\nseances because now for the first time I recognised that I had been\nplaying with a dangerous thing. It was a revelation to me. I did not\nknow what to do. Mme. Dauvray would promise me everything, give me\neverything, if only I would consent when I refused. I was terribly\nfrightened of what would happen. I did not want power over people. I\nknew it was not good for her that she should suffer so much excitement.\nNo, I did not know what to do. And so we all moved to Aix.\"\n\nAnd there she met Harry Wethermill on the second day after her arrival,\nand proceeded straightway for the first time to fall in love. To Celia\nit seemed that at last that had happened for which she had so longed.\nShe began really to live as she understood life at this time. The day,\nuntil she met Harry Wethermill, was one flash of joyous expectation;\nthe hours when they were together a time of contentment which thrilled\nwith some chance meeting of the hands into an exquisite happiness. Mme.\nDauvray understood quickly what was the matter, and laughed at her\naffectionately.\n\n\"Celie, my dear,\" she said, \"your friend, M. Wethermill--'Arry, is it\nnot? See, I pronounce your tongue--will not be as comfortable as the\nnice, fat, bourgeois gentleman I meant to find for you. But, since you\nare young, naturally you want storms. And there will be storms, Celie,\"\nshe concluded, with a laugh.\n\nCelia blushed.\n\n\"I suppose there will,\" she said regretfully. There were, indeed,\nmoments when she was frightened of Harry Wethermill, but frightened\nwith a delicious thrill of knowledge that he was only stern because he\ncared so much.\n\nBut in a day or two there began to intrude upon her happiness a\nstinging dissatisfaction with her past life. At times she fell into\nmelancholy, comparing her career with that of the man who loved her. At\ntimes she came near to an extreme irritation with Helene Vauquier. Her\nlover was in her thoughts. As she put it herself:\n\n\"I wanted always to look my best, and always to be very good.\"\n\nGood in the essentials of life, that is to be understood. She had lived\nin a lax world. She was not particularly troubled by the character of\nher associates; she was untouched by them; she liked her fling at the\nbaccarat-tables. These were details, and did not distress her. Love had\nnot turned her into a Puritan. But certain recollections plagued her\nsoul. The visit to the restaurant at Montmartre, for instance, and the\nseances. Of these, indeed, she thought to have made an end. There were\nthe baccarat-rooms, the beauty of the town and the neighbourhood to\ndistract Mme. Dauvray. Celia kept her thoughts away from seances. There\nwas no seance as yet held in the Villa Rose. And there would have been\nnone but for Helene Vauquier.\n\nOne evening, however, as Harry Wethermill walked down from the Cercle\nto the Villa des Fleurs, a woman's voice spoke to him from behind.\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\nHe turned and saw Mme. Dauvray's maid. He stopped under a street lamp,\nand said:\n\n\"Well, what can I do for you?\"\n\nThe woman hesitated.\n\n\"I hope monsieur will pardon me,\" she said humbly. \"I am committing a\ngreat impertinence. But I think monsieur is not very kind to Mlle.\nCelie.\"\n\nWethermill stared at her.\n\n\"What on earth do you mean?\" he asked angrily.\n\nHelene Vauquier looked him quietly in the face.\n\n\"It is plain, monsieur, that Mlle. Celie loves monsieur. Monsieur has\nled her on to love him. But it is also plain to a woman with quick eyes\nthat monsieur himself cares no more for mademoiselle than for the\nbutton on his coat. It is not very kind to spoil the happiness of a\nyoung and pretty girl, monsieur.\"\n\nNothing could have been more respectful than the manner in which these\nwords were uttered. Wethermill was taken in by it. He protested\nearnestly, fearing lest the maid should become an enemy.\n\n\"Helene, it is not true that I am playing with Mlle. Celie. Why should\nI not care for her?\"\n\nHelene Vauquier shrugged her shoulders. The question needed no answer.\n\n\"Why should I seek her so often if I did not care?\"\n\nAnd to this question Helene Vauquier smiled--a quiet, slow,\nconfidential smile.\n\n\"What does monsieur want of Mme. Dauvray?\" she asked. And the question\nwas her answer.\n\nWethermill stood silent. Then he said abruptly:\n\n\"Nothing, of course; nothing.\" And he walked away.\n\nBut the smile remained on Helene Vauquier's face. What did they all\nwant of Mme. Dauvray? She knew very well. It was what she herself\nwanted--with other things. It was money--always money. Wethermill was\nnot the first to seek the good graces of Mme. Dauvray through her\npretty companion. Helene Vauquier went home. She was not discontented\nwith her conversation. Wethermill had paused long enough before he\ndenied the suggestion of her words. She approached him a few days later\na second time and more openly. She was shopping in the Rue du Casino\nwhen he passed her. He stopped of his own accord and spoke to her.\nHelene Vauquier kept a grave and respectful face. But there was a pulse\nof joy at her heart. He was coming to her hand.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"you do not go the right way.\" And again her\nstrange smile illuminated her face. \"Mlle. Celie sets a guard about\nMme. Dauvray. She will not give to people the opportunity to find\nmadame generous.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Wethermill slowly. \"Is that so?\" And he turned and walked by\nHelene Vauquier's side.\n\n\"Never speak of Mme. Dauvray's wealth, monsieur, if you would keep the\nfavour of Mlle. Celie. She is young, but she knows her world.\"\n\n\"I have not spoken of money to her,\" replied Wethermill; and then he\nburst out laughing. \"But why should you think that I--I, of all\nmen--want money?\" he asked.\n\nAnd Helene answered him again enigmatically.\n\n\"If I am wrong, monsieur, I am sorry, but you can help me too,\" she\nsaid, in her submissive voice. And she passed on, leaving Wethermill\nrooted to the ground.\n\nIt was a bargain she proposed--the impertinence of it! It was a bargain\nshe proposed--the value of it! In that shape ran Harry Wethermill's\nthoughts. He was in desperate straits, though to the world's eye he was\na man of wealth. A gambler, with no inexpensive tastes, he had been\nalways in need of money. The rights in his patent he had mortgaged long\nago. He was not an idler; he was no sham foisted as a great man on an\nignorant public. He had really some touch of genius, and he cultivated\nit assiduously. But the harder he worked, the greater was his need of\ngaiety and extravagance. Gifted with good looks and a charm of manner,\nhe was popular alike in the great world and the world of Bohemia. He\nkept and wanted to keep a foot in each. That he was in desperate\nstraits now, probably Helene Vauquier alone in Aix had recognised. She\nhad drawn her inference from one simple fact. Wethermill asked her at a\nlater time when they were better acquainted how she had guessed his\nneed.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she replied, \"you were in Aix without a valet, and it\nseemed to me that you were of that class of men who would never move\nwithout a valet so long as there was money to pay his wages. That was\nmy first thought. Then when I saw you pursue your friendship with Mlle.\nCelie--you, who so clearly to my eyes did not love her--I felt sure.\"\n\nOn the next occasion that the two met, it was again Harry Wethermill\nwho sought Helene Vauquier. He talked for a minute or two upon\nindifferent subjects, and then he said quickly:\n\n\"I suppose Mme. Dauvray is very rich?\"\n\n\"She has a great fortune in jewels,\" said Helene Vauquier.\n\nWethermill started. He was agitated that evening, the woman saw. His\nhands shook, his face twitched. Clearly he was hard put to it. For he\nseldom betrayed himself. She thought it time to strike.\n\n\"Jewels which she keeps in the safe in her bedroom,\" she added.\n\n\"Then why don't you--?\" he began, and stopped.\n\n\"I said that I too needed help,\" replied Helene, without a ruffle of\nher composure.\n\nIt was nine o'clock at night. Helene Vauquier had come down to the\nCasino with a wrap for Mme. Dauvray. The two people were walking down\nthe little street of which the Casino blocks the end. And it happened\nthat an attendant at the Casino, named Alphonse Ruel, passed them,\nrecognised them both, and--smiled to himself with some amusement. What\nwas Wethermill doing in company with Mme. Dauvray's maid? Ruel had no\ndoubt. Ruel had seen Wethermill often enough these recent days with\nMme. Dauvray's pretty companion. Ruel had all a Frenchman's sympathy\nwith lovers. He wished them well, those two young and attractive\npeople, and hoped that the maid would help their plans.\n\nBut as he passed he caught a sentence spoken suddenly by Wethermill.\n\n\"Well, it is true; I must have money.\" And the agitated voice and words\nremained fixed in his memory. He heard, too, a warning \"Hush!\" from the\nmaid. Then they passed out of his hearing. But he turned and saw that\nWethermill was talking volubly. What Harry Wethermill was saying he was\nsaying in a foolish burst of confidence.\n\n\"You have guessed it, Helene--you alone.\" He had mortgaged his patent\ntwice over--once in France, once in England--and the second time had\nbeen a month ago. He had received a large sum down, which went to pay\nhis pressing creditors. He had hoped to pay the sum back from a new\ninvention.\n\n\"But Helene, I tell you,\" he said, \"I have a conscience.\" And when she\nsmiled he explained. \"Oh, not what the priests would call a conscience;\nthat I know. But none the less I have a conscience--a conscience about\nthe things which really matter, at all events to me. There is a flaw in\nthat new invention. It can be improved; I know that. But as yet I do\nnot see how, and--I cannot help it--I must get it right; I cannot let\nit go imperfect when I know that it's imperfect, when I know that it\ncan be improved, when I am sure that I shall sooner or later hit upon\nthe needed improvement. That is what I mean when I say I have a\nconscience.\"\n\nHelena Vauquier smiled indulgently. Men were queer fish. Things which\nwere really of no account troubled and perplexed them and gave them\nsleepless nights. But it was not for her to object, since it was one of\nthese queer anomalies which was giving her her chance.\n\n\"And the people are finding out that you have sold your rights twice\nover,\" she said sympathetically. \"That is a pity, monsieur.\"\n\n\"They know,\" he answered; \"those in England know.\"\n\n\"And they are very angry?\"\n\n\"They threaten me,\" said Wethermill. \"They give me a month to restore\nthe money. Otherwise there will be disgrace, imprisonment, penal\nservitude.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier walked calmly on. No sign of the intense joy which she\nfelt was visible in her face, and only a trace of it in her voice.\n\n\"Monsieur will, perhaps, meet me to-morrow in Geneva,\" she said. And she\nnamed a small cafe in a back street. \"I can get a holiday for the\nafternoon.\" And as they were near to the villa and the lights, she\nwalked on ahead.\n\nWethermill loitered behind. He had tried his luck at the tables and had\nfailed. And--and--he must have the money.\n\nHe travelled, accordingly, the next day to Geneva, and was there\npresented to Adele Tace and Hippolyte.\n\n\"They are trusted friends of mine,\" said Helene Vauquier to Wethermill,\nwho was not inspired to confidence by the sight of the young man with\nthe big ears and the plastered hair. As a matter of fact, she had never\nmet them before they came this year to Aix.\n\nThe Tace family, which consisted of Adele and her husband and Jeanne,\nher mother, were practised criminals. They had taken the house in\nGeneva deliberately in order to carry out some robberies from the great\nvillas on the lake-side. But they had not been fortunate; and a\ndescription of Mme. Dauvray's jewellery in the woman's column of a\nGeneva newspaper had drawn Adele Tace over to Aix. She had set about\nthe task of seducing Mme. Dauvray's maid, and found a master, not an\ninstrument.\n\nIn the small cafe on that afternoon of July Helene Vauquier instructed\nher accomplices, quietly and methodically, as though what she proposed\nwas the most ordinary stroke of business. Once or twice subsequently\nWethermill, who was the only safe go-between, went to the house in\nGeneva, altering his hair and wearing a moustache, to complete the\narrangements. He maintained firmly at his trial that at none of these\nmeetings was there any talk of murder.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said the judge, with a savage sarcasm. \"In decent\nconversation there is always a reticence. Something is left to be\nunderstood.\"\n\nAnd it is difficult to understand how murder could not have been an\nessential part of their plan, since---But let us see what happened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE FIRST MOVE\n\n\nOn the Friday before the crime was committed Mme. Dauvray and Celia\ndined at the Villa des Fleurs. While they were drinking their coffee\nHarry Wethermill joined them. He stayed with them until Mme. Dauvray\nwas ready to move, and then all three walked into the baccarat rooms\ntogether. But there, in the throng of people, they were separated.\n\nHarry Wethermill was looking carefully after Celia, as a good lover\nshould. He had, it seemed, no eyes for any one else; and it was not\nuntil a minute or two had passed that the girl herself noticed that\nMme. Dauvray was not with them.\n\n\"We will find her easily,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Celia.\n\n\"There is, after all, no hurry,\" said Wethermill, with a laugh; \"and\nperhaps she was not unwilling to leave us together.\"\n\nCelia dimpled to a smile.\n\n\"Mme. Dauvray is kind to me,\" she said, with a very pretty timidity.\n\n\"And yet more kind to me,\" said Wethermill in a low voice which brought\nthe blood into Celia's cheeks.\n\nBut even while he spoke he soon caught sight of Mme. Dauvray standing\nby one of the tables; and near to her was Adele Tace. Adele had not yet\nmade Mme. Dauvray's acquaintance; that was evident. She was apparently\nunaware of her; but she was gradually edging towards her. Wethermill\nsmiled, and Celia caught the smile.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, and her head began to turn in the direction of\nMme. Dauvray.\n\n\"Why, I like your frock--that's all,\" said Wethermill at once; and\nCelia's eyes went down to it.\n\n\"Do you?\" she said, with a pleased smile. It was a dress of dark blue\nwhich suited her well. \"I am glad. I think it is pretty.\" And they\npassed on.\n\nWethermill stayed by the girl's side throughout the evening. Once again\nhe saw Mme. Dauvray and Adele Tace. But now they were together; now\nthey were talking. The first step had been taken. Adele Tace had\nscraped acquaintance with Mme. Dauvray. Celia saw them almost at the\nsame moment.\n\n\"Oh, there is Mme. Dauvray,\" she cried, taking a step towards her.\n\nWethermill detained the girl.\n\n\"She seems quite happy,\" he said; and, indeed, Mme. Dauvray was talking\nvolubly and with the utmost interest, the jewels sparkling about her\nneck. She raised her head, saw Celia, nodded to her affectionately, and\nthen pointed her out to her companion. Adele Tace looked the girl over\nwith interest and smiled contentedly. There was nothing to be feared\nfrom her. Her youth, her very daintiness, seemed to offer her as the\neasiest of victims.\n\n\"You see Mme. Dauvray does not want you,\" said Harry Wethermill. \"Let\nus go and play CHEMIN-DE-FER\"; and they did, moving off into one of the\nfurther rooms.\n\nIt was not until another hour had passed that Celia rose and went in\nsearch of Mme. Dauvray. She found her still talking earnestly to Adele\nTace. Mme. Dauvray got up at once.\n\n\"Are you ready to go, dear?\" she asked, and she turned to Adele Tace.\n\"This is Celie, Mme. Rossignol,\" she said, and she spoke with a marked\nsignificance and a note of actual exultation in her voice.\n\nCelia, however, was not unused to this tone. Mme. Dauvray was proud of\nher companion, and had a habit of showing her off, to the girl's\ndiscomfort. The three women spoke a few words, and then Mme. Dauvray\nand Celia left the rooms and walked to the entrance-doors. But as they\nwalked Celia became alarmed.\n\nShe was by nature extraordinarily sensitive to impressions. It was to\nthat quick receptivity that the success of \"The Great Fortinbras\" had\nbeen chiefly due. She had a gift of rapid comprehension. It was not\nthat she argued, or deducted, or inferred. But she felt. To take a\nmetaphor from the work of the man she loved, she was a natural\nreceiver. So now, although no word was spoken, she was aware that Mme.\nDauvray was greatly excited--greatly disturbed; and she dreaded the\nreason of that excitement and disturbance.\n\nWhile they were driving home in the motor-car she said apprehensively:\n\n\"You met a friend then, to-night, madame?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mme. Dauvray; \"I made a friend. I had not met Mme. Rossignol\nbefore. A bracelet of hers came undone, and I helped her to fasten it.\nWe talked afterwards. She lives in Geneva.\"\n\nMme. Dauvray was silent for a moment or two. Then she turned\nimpulsively and spoke in a voice of appeal.\n\n\"Celie, we talked of things\"; and the girl moved impatiently. She\nunderstood very well what were the things of which Mme. Dauvray and her\nnew friend had talked. \"And she laughed. ... I could not bear it.\"\n\nCelia was silent, and Mme. Dauvray went on in a voice of awe:\n\n\"I told her of the wonderful things which happened when I sat with\nHelene in the dark--how the room filled with strange sounds, how\nghostly fingers touched my forehead and my eyes. She laughed--Adele\nRossignol laughed, Celie. I told her of the spirits with whom we held\nconverse. She would not believe. Do you remember the evening, Celie,\nwhen Mme. de Castiglione came back an old, old woman, and told us how,\nwhen she had grown old and had lost her beauty and was very lonely, she\nwould no longer live in the great house which was so full of torturing\nmemories, but took a small APPARTEMENT near by, where no one knew her;\nand how she used to walk out late at night, and watch, with her eyes\nfull of tears, the dark windows which had been once so bright with\nlight? Adele Rossignol would not believe. I told her that I had found\nthe story afterwards in a volume of memoirs. Adele Rossignol laughed\nand said no doubt you had read that volume yourself before the seance.\"\n\nCelia stirred guiltily.\n\n\"She had no faith in you, Celie. It made me angry, dear. She said that\nyou invented your own tests. She sneered at them. A string across a\ncupboard! A child, she said, could manage that; much more, then, a\nclever young lady. Oh, she admitted that you were clever! Indeed, she\nurged that you were far too clever to submit to the tests of some one\nyou did not know. I replied that you would. I was right, Celie, was I\nnot?\"\n\nAnd again the appeal sounded rather piteously in Mme. Dauvray's voice.\n\n\"Tests!\" said Celia, with a contemptuous laugh. And, in truth, she was\nnot afraid of them. Mme. Dauvray's voice at once took courage.\n\n\"There!\" she cried triumphantly. \"I was sure. I told her so. Celie, I\narranged with her that next Tuesday--\"\n\nAnd Celia interrupted quickly.\n\n\"No! Oh, no!\"\n\nAgain there was silence; and then Mme. Dauvray said gently, but very\nseriously:\n\n\"Celie, you are not kind.\"\n\nCelia was moved by the reproach.\n\n\"Oh, madame!\" she cried eagerly. \"Please don't think that. How could I\nbe anything else to you who are so kind to me?\"\n\n\"Then prove it, Celie. On Tuesday I have asked Mme. Rossignol to come;\nand--\" The old woman's voice became tremulous with excitement. \"And\nperhaps--who knows?--perhaps SHE will appear to us.\"\n\nCelia had no doubt who \"she\" was. She was Mme. de Montespan.\n\n\"Oh, no, madame!\" she stammered. \"Here, at Aix, we are not in the\nspirit for such things.\"\n\nAnd then, in a voice of dread, Mme. Dauvray asked: \"Is it true, then,\nwhat Adele said?\"\n\nAnd Celia started violently. Mme. Dauvray doubted.\n\n\"I believe it would break my heart, my dear, if I were to think that;\nif I were to know that you had tricked me,\" she said, with a trembling\nvoice.\n\nCelia covered her face with her hands. It would be true. She had\nno doubt of it. Mme. Dauvray would never forgive herself--would never\nforgive Celia. Her infatuation had grown so to engross her that the\nrest of her life would surely be embittered. It was not merely a\npassion--it was a creed as well. Celia shrank from the renewal of these\nseances. Every fibre in her was in revolt. They were so unworthy--so\nunworthy of Harry Wethermill, and of herself as she now herself wished\nto be. But she had to pay now; the moment for payment had come.\n\n\"Celie,\" said Mme. Dauvray, \"it isn't true! Surely it isn't true?\"\n\nCelia drew her hands away from her face.\n\n\"Let Mme. Rossignol come on Tuesday!\" she cried, and the old woman\ncaught the girl's hand and pressed it with affection.\n\n\"Oh, thank you! thank you!\" she cried. \"Adele Rossignol laughs\nto-night; we shall convince her on Tuesday, Celie! Celie, I am so\nglad!\" And her voice sank into a solemn whisper, pathetically\nludicrous. \"It is not right that she should laugh! To bring people back\nthrough the gates of the spirit-world--that is wonderful.\"\n\nTo Celia the sound of the jargon learnt from her own lips, used by\nherself so thoughtlessly in past times, was odious. \"For the last\ntime,\" she pleaded to herself. All her life was going to change; though\nno word had yet been spoken by Harry Wethermill, she was sure of it.\nJust for this one last time, then, so that she might leave Mme. Dauvray\nthe colours of her belief, she would hold a seance at the Villa Rose.\n\nMme. Dauvray told the news to Helene Vauquier when they reached the\nvilla.\n\n\"You will be present, Helene,\" she cried excitedly. \"It will be\nTuesday. There will be the three of us.\"\n\n\"Certainly, if madame wishes,\" said Helene submissively. She looked\nround the room. \"Mlle. Celie can be placed on a chair in that recess\nand the curtains drawn, whilst we--madame and madame's friend and\nI--can sit round this table under the side windows.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Celia, \"that will do very well.\"\n\nIt was Madame Dauvray's habit when she was particularly pleased with\nCelia to dismiss her maid quickly, and to send her to brush the girl's\nhair at night; and in a little while on this night Helene went to\nCelia's room. While she brushed Celia's hair she told her that\nServettaz's parents lived at Chambery, and that he would like to see\nthem.\n\n\"But the poor man is afraid to ask for a day,\" she said. \"He has been\nso short a time with madame.\"\n\n\"Of course madame will give him a holiday if he asks,\" replied Celia\nwith a smile. \"I will speak to her myself to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It would be kind of mademoiselle,\" said Helene Vauquier. \"But\nperhaps--\" She stopped.\n\n\"Well,\" said Celia.\n\n\"Perhaps mademoiselle would do better still to speak to Servattaz\nhimself and encourage him to ask with his own lips. Madame has her\nmoods, is it not so? She does not always like it to be forgotten that\nshe is the mistress.\"\n\nOn the next day accordingly Celia did speak to Servettaz, and Servettaz\nasked for his holiday.\n\n\"But of course,\" Mme. Dauvray at once replied. \"We must decide upon a\nday.\"\n\nIt was then that Helene Vauquier ventured humbly upon a suggestion.\n\n\"Since madame has a friend coming here on Tuesday, perhaps that would\nbe the best day for him to go. Madame would not be likely to take a\nlong drive that afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Mme. Dauvray. \"We shall all three dine together\nearly in Aix and return here.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell him he may go to-morrow,\" said Celia.\n\nFor this conversation took place on the Monday, and in the evening Mme.\nDauvray and Celia went as usual to the Villa des Fleurs and dined there.\n\n\"I was in a bad mind,\" said Celia, when asked by the Juge d'Instruction\nto explain that attack of nerves in the garden which Ricardo had\nwitnessed. \"I hated more and more the thought of the seance which was\nto take place on the morrow. I felt that I was disloyal to Harry. My\nnerves were all tingling. I was not nice that night at all,\" she added\nquaintly. \"But at dinner I determined that if I met Harry after dinner,\nas I was sure to do, I would tell him the whole truth about myself.\nHowever, when I did meet him I was frightened. I knew how stern he\ncould suddenly look. I dreaded what he would think. I was too afraid\nthat I should lose him. No, I could not speak; I had not the courage.\nThat made me still more angry with myself, and so I--I quarrelled at\nonce with Harry. He was surprised; but it was natural, wasn't it? What\nelse should one do under such circumstances, except quarrel with the\nman one loved? Yes, I really quarrelled with him, and said things which\nI thought and hoped would hurt. Then I ran away from him lest I should\nbreak down and cry. I went to the tables and lost at once all the money\nI had except one note of five louis. But that did not console me. And I\nran out into the garden, very unhappy. There I behaved like a child,\nand Mr. Ricardo saw me. But it was not the little money I had lost\nwhich troubled me; no, it was the thought of what a coward I was.\nAfterwards Harry and I made it up, and I thought, like the little fool\nI was, that he wanted to ask me to marry him. But I would not let him\nthat night. Oh! I wanted him to ask me--I was longing for him to ask\nme--but not that night. Somehow I felt that the seance and the tricks\nmust be all over and done with before I could listen or answer.\"\n\nThe quiet and simple confession touched the magistrate who listened to\nit with profound pity. He shaded his eyes with his hand. The girl's\nsense of her unworthiness, the love she had given so unstintingly to\nHarry Wethermill, the deep pride she had felt in the delusion that he\nloved her too, had in it an irony too bitter. But he was aroused to\nanger against the man.\n\n\"Go on, mademoiselle,\" he said. But in spite of himself his voice\ntrembled.\n\n\"So I arranged with him that we should meet on Wednesday, as Mr.\nRicardo heard.\"\n\n\"You told him that you would 'want him' on Wednesday,\" said the Judge\nquoting Mr. Ricardo's words.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Celia. \"I meant that the last word of all these\ndeceptions would have been spoken. I should be free to hear what he had\nto say to me. You see, monsieur, I was so sure that I knew what it was\nhe had to say to me--\" and her voice broke upon the words. She\nrecovered herself with an effort. \"Then I went home with Mme. Dauvray.\"\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, however, there came a letter from Adele\nTace, of which no trace was afterwards discovered. The letter invited\nMme. Dauvray and Celia to come out to Annecy and dine with her at an\nhotel there. They could then return together to Aix. The proposal\nfitted well with Mme. Dauvray's inclinations. She was in a feverish\nmood of excitement.\n\n\"Yes, it will be better that we dine quietly together in a place where\nthere is no noise and no crowd, and where no one knows us,\" she said;\nand she looked up the time-table. \"There is a train back which reaches\nAix at nine o'clock,\" she said, \"so we need not spoil Servettaz'\nholiday.\"\n\n\"His parents will be expecting him,\" Helene Vauquier added.\n\nAccordingly Servettaz left for Chambery by the 1.50 train from Aix; and\nlater on in the afternoon Mme. Dauvray and Celia went by train to\nAnnecy. In the one woman's mind was the queer longing that \"she\" should\nappear and speak to-night; in the girl's there was a wish passionate as\na cry. \"This shall be the last time,\" she said to herself again and\nagain--\"the very last.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Helene Vauquier, it must be held, burnt carefully Adele\nTaces letter. She was left in the Villa Rose with the charwoman to keep\nher company. The charwoman bore testimony that Helene Vauquier\ncertainly did burn a letter in the kitchen-stove, and that after she\nhad burned it she sat for a long time rocking herself in a chair, with\na smile of great pleasure upon her face, and now and then moistening\nher lips with her tongue. But Helene Vauquier kept her mouth sealed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE AFTERNOON OF TUESDAY\n\n\nMme. Dauvray and Celia found Adele Rossignol, to give Adele Tace the\nname which she assumed, waiting for them impatiently in the garden of\nan hotel at Annecy, on the Promenade du Paquier. She was a tall, lithe\nwoman, and she was dressed, by the purse and wish of Helene Vauquier,\nin a robe and a long coat of sapphire velvet, which toned down the\ncoarseness of her good looks and lent something of elegance to her\nfigure.\n\n\"So it is mademoiselle,\" Adele began, with a smile of raillery, \"who is\nso remarkably clever.\"\n\n\"Clever?\" answered Celia, looking straight at Adele, as though through\nher she saw mysteries beyond. She took up her part at once. Since for\nthe last time it had got to be played, there must be no fault in the\nplaying. For her own sake, for the sake of Mme. Dauvray's happiness,\nshe must carry it off to-night with success. The suspicions of Adele\nRossignol must obtain no verification. She spoke in a quiet and most\nserious voice. \"Under spirit-control no one is clever. One does the\nbidding of the spirit which controls.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Adele in a malicious tone. \"I only hope you will see\nto it, mademoiselle, that some amusing spirits control you this evening\nand appear before us.\"\n\n\"I am only the living gate by which the spirit forms pass from the\nrealm of mind into the world of matter,\" Celia replied.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Adele comfortably. \"Now let us be sensible and dine.\nWe can amuse ourselves with mademoiselle's rigmaroles afterwards.\"\n\nMme. Dauvray was indignant. Celia, for her part, felt humiliated and\nsmall. They sat down to their dinner in the garden, but the rain began\nto fall and drove them indoors. There were a few people dining at the\nsame hour, but none near enough to overhear them. Alike in the garden\nand the dining-room, Adele Tace kept up the same note of ridicule and\ndisbelief. She had been carefully tutored for her work. She was able to\ncite the stock cases of exposure--\"LES FRERES Davenport,\" as she called\nthem, Eusapia Palladino and Dr. Slade. She knew the precautions which\nhad been taken to prevent trickery and where those precautions had\nfailed. Her whole conversation was carefully planned to one end, and to\none end alone. She wished to produce in the minds of her companions so\ncomplete an impression of her scepticism that it would seem the most\nnatural thing in the world to both of them that she should insist upon\nsubjecting Celia to the severest tests. The rain ceased, and they took\ntheir coffee on the terrace of the hotel. Mme. Dauvray had been really\npained by the conversation of Adele Tace. She had all the missionary\nzeal of a fanatic.\n\n\"I do hope, Adele, that we shall make you believe. But we shall. Oh, I\nam confident we shall.\" And her voice was feverish.\n\nAdele dropped for the moment her tone of raillery.\n\n\"I am not unwilling to believe,\" she said, \"but I cannot. I am\ninterested--yes. You see how much I have studied the subject. But I\ncannot believe. I have heard stories of how these manifestations are\nproduced--stories which make me laugh. I cannot help it. The tricks are\nso easy. A young girl wearing a black frock which does not rustle--it\nis always a black frock, is it not, because a black frock cannot be\nseen in the dark?--carrying a scarf or veil, with which she can make\nany sort of headdress if only she is a little clever, and shod in a\npair of felt-soled slippers, is shut up in a cabinet or placed behind a\nscreen, and the lights are turned down or out--\" Adele broke off with a\ncomic shrug of the shoulders. \"Bah! It ought not to deceive a child.\"\n\nCelia sat with a face which WOULD grow red. She did not look, but none\nthe less she was aware that Mme. Dauvray was gazing at her with a\nperplexed frown and some return of her suspicion showing in her eyes.\nAdele Tace was not content to leave the subject there.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said, with a smile, \"Mlle. Celie dresses in that way for\na seance?\"\n\n\"Madame shall see to-night,\" Celia stammered, and Camille Dauvray rather\nsternly repeated her words.\n\n\"Yes, Adele shall see to-night. I myself will decide what you shall\nwear, Celie.\"\n\nAdele Tace casually suggested the kind of dress which she would prefer.\n\n\"Something light in colour with a train, something which will hiss and\nwhisper if mademoiselle moves about the room--yes, and I think one of\nmademoiselle's big hats,\" she said. \"We will have mademoiselle as\nmodern as possible, so that, when the great ladies of the past appear\nin the coiffure of their day, we may be sure it is not Mlle. Celie who\nrepresents them.\"\n\n\"I will speak to Helene,\" said Mme. Dauvray, and Adele Tace was content.\n\nThere was a particular new dress of which she knew, and it was very\ndesirable that Mlle. Celie should wear it to-night. For one thing, if\nCelia wore it, it would help the theory that she had put it on because\nshe expected that night a lover; for another, with that dress there\nwent a pair of satin slippers which had just come home from a shoemaker\nat Aix, and which would leave upon soft mould precisely the same\nimprints as the grey suede shoes which the girl was wearing now.\n\nCelia was not greatly disconcerted by Mme. Rossignol's precautions. She\nwould have to be a little more careful, and Mme. de Montespan would be\na little longer in responding to the call of Mme. Dauvray than most of\nthe other dead ladies of the past had been. But that was all. She was,\nhowever, really troubled in another way. All through dinner, at every\nword of the conversation, she had felt her reluctance towards this\nseance swelling into a positive disgust. More than once she had felt\ndriven by some uncontrollable power to rise up at the table and cry out\nto Adele:\n\n\"You are right! It IS trickery. There is no truth in it.\"\n\nBut she had mastered herself. For opposite to her sat her patroness,\nher good friend, the woman who had saved her. The flush upon Mme.\nDauvray's cheeks and the agitation of her manner warned Celia how much\nhung upon the success of this last seance. How much for both of them!\n\nAnd in the fullness of that knowledge a great fear assailed her. She\nbegan to be afraid, so strong was her reluctance, that she would not\nbring her heart into the task. \"Suppose I failed to-night because I\ncould not force myself to wish not to fail!\" she thought, and she\nsteeled herself against the thought. To-night she must not fail. For\napart altogether from Mme. Dauvray's happiness, her own, it seemed, was\nat stake too.\n\n\"It must be from my lips that Harry learns what I have been,\" she said\nto herself, and with the resolve she strengthened herself.\n\n\"I will wear what you please,\" she said, with a smile. \"I only wish\nMme. Rossignol to be satisfied.\"\n\n\"And I shall be,\" said Adele, \"if--\" She leaned forward in anxiety. She\nhad come to the real necessity of Helene Vauquier's plan. \"If we\nabandon as quite laughable the cupboard door and the string across it;\nif, in a word, mademoiselle consents that we tie her hand and foot and\nfasten her securely in a chair. Such restraints are usual in the\nexperiments of which I have read. Was there not a medium called Mlle.\nCook who was secured in this way, and then remarkable things, which I\ncould not believe, were supposed to have happened?\"\n\n\"Certainly I permit it,\" said Celia, with indifference; and Mme.\nDauvray cried enthusiastically:\n\n\"Ah, you shall believe to-night in those wonderful things!\"\n\nAdele Tace leaned back. She drew a breath. It was a breath of relief.\n\n\"Then we will buy the cord in Aix,\" she said.\n\n\"We have some, no doubt, in the house,\" said Mme. Dauvray.\n\nAdele shook her head and smiled.\n\n\"My dear madame, you are dealing with a sceptic. I should not be\ncontent.\"\n\nCelia shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Let us satisfy Mme. Rossignol,\" she said.\n\nCelia, indeed, was not alarmed by this last precaution. For her it was\na test less difficult than the light-coloured rustling robe. She had\nappeared upon so many platforms, had experienced too often the bungling\nefforts of spectators called up from the audience, to be in any fear.\nThere were very few knots from which her small hands and supple fingers\nhad not learnt long since to extricate themselves. She was aware how\nmuch in all these matters the personal equation counted. Men who might,\nperhaps, have been able to tie knots from which she could not get free\nwere always too uncomfortable and self-conscious, or too afraid of\nhurting her white arms and wrists, to do it. Women, on the other hand,\nwho had no compunctions of that kind, did not know how.\n\nIt was now nearly eight o'clock; the rain still held off.\n\n\"We must go,\" said Mme. Dauvray, who for the last half-hour had been\ncontinually looking at her watch.\n\nThey drove to the station and took the train. Once more the rain came\ndown, but it had stopped again before the train steamed into Aix at\nnine o'clock.\n\n\"We will take a cab,\" said Mme. Dauvray: \"it will save time.\"\n\n\"It will do us good to walk, madame,\" pleaded Adele. The train was\nfull. Adele passed quickly out from the lights of the station in the\nthrong of passengers and waited in the dark square for the others to\njoin her. \"It is barely nine. A friend has promised to call at the\nVilla Rose for me after eleven and drive me back in a motor-car to\nGeneva, so we have plenty of time.\"\n\nThey walked accordingly up the hill, Mme. Dauvray slowly, since she was\nstout, and Celia keeping pace with her. Thus it seemed natural that\nAdele Tace should walk ahead, though a passer-by would not have thought\nshe was of their company. At the corner of the Rue du Casino Adele\nwaited for them and said quickly:\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you can get some cord, I think, at the shop there,\" and\nshe pointed to the shop of M. Corval. \"Madame and I will go slowly on;\nyou, who are the youngest, will easily catch us up.\" Celia went into\nthe shop, bought the cord, and caught Mme. Dauvray up before she\nreached the villa.\n\n\"Where is Mme. Rossignol?\" she asked.\n\n\"She went on,\" said Camille Dauvray. \"She walks faster than I do.\"\n\nThey passed no one whom they knew, although they did pass one who\nrecognised them, as Perrichet had discovered. They came upon Adele,\nwaiting for them at the corner of the road, where it turns down toward\nthe villa.\n\n\"It is near here--the Villa Rose?\" she asked.\n\n\"A minute more and we are there.\"\n\nThey turned in at the drive, closed the gate behind them, and walked up\nto the villa.\n\nThe windows and the glass doors were closed, the latticed shutters\nfastened. A light burned in the hall.\n\n\"Helene is expecting us,\" said Mme. Dauvray, for as they approached she\nsaw the front door open to admit them, and Helene Vauquier in the\ndoorway. The three women went straight into the little salon, which was\nready with the lights up and a small fire burning. Celia noticed the\nfire with a trifle of dismay. She moved a fire-screen in front of it.\n\n\"I can understand why you do that, mademoiselle,\" said Adele Rossignol,\nwith a satirical smile. But Mme. Dauvray came to the girl's help.\n\n\"She is right, Adele. Light is the great barrier between us and the\nspirit-world,\" she said solemnly.\n\nMeanwhile, in the hall Helene Vauquier locked and bolted the front\ndoor. Then she stood motionless, with a smile upon her face and a heart\nbeating high. All through that afternoon she had been afraid that some\naccident at the last moment would spoil her plan, that Adele Tace had\nnot learned her lesson, that Celie would take fright, that she would\nnot return. Now all those fears were over. She had her victims safe\nwithin the villa. The charwoman had been sent home. She had them to\nherself. She was still standing in the hall when Mme. Dauvray called\naloud impatiently:\n\n\"Helene! Helene!\"\n\nAnd when she entered the salon there was still, as Celia was able to\nrecall, some trace of her smile lingering upon her face.\n\nAdele Rossignol had removed her hat and was taking off her gloves. Mme.\nDauvray was speaking impatiently to Celia.\n\n\"We will arrange the room, dear, while Helene helps you to dress. It\nwill be quite easy. We shall use the recess.\"\n\nAnd Celia, as she ran up the stairs, heard Mme. Dauvray discussing with\nher maid what frock she should wear. She was hot, and she took a\nhurried bath. When she came from her bathroom she saw with dismay that\nit was her new pale-green evening gown which had been laid out. It was\nthe last which she would have chosen. But she dared not refuse it. She\nmust still any suspicion. She must succeed. She gave herself into\nHelene's hands. Celia remembered afterwards one or two points which\npassed barely heeded at the time. Once while Helene was dressing her\nhair she looked up at the maid in the mirror and noticed a strange and\nrather horrible grin upon her face, which disappeared the moment their\neyes met. Then again, Helene was extraordinarily slow and\nextraordinarily fastidious that evening. Nothing satisfied her, neither\nthe hang of the girl's skirt, the folds of her sash, nor the\narrangement of her hair.\n\n\"Come, Helene, be quick,\" said Celia. \"You know how madame hates to be\nkept waiting at these times. You might be dressing me to go to meet my\nlover,\" she added, with a blush and a smile at her own pretty\nreflection in the glass; and a queer look came upon Helene Vauquier's\nface. For it was at creating just this very impression that she aimed.\n\n\"Very well, mademoiselle,\" said Helene. And even as she spoke Mme.\nDauvray's voice rang shrill and irritable up the stairs.\n\n\"Celie! Celie!\"\n\n\"Quick, Helene,\" said Celia. For she herself was now anxious to have\nthe seance over and done with.\n\nBut Helene did not hurry. The more irritable Mme. Dauvray became, the\nmore impatient with Mlle. Celie, the less would Mlle. Celie dare to\nrefuse the tests Adele wished to impose upon her. But that was not all.\nShe took a subtle and ironic pleasure to-night in decking out her\nvictim's natural loveliness. Her face, her slender throat, her white\nshoulders, should look their prettiest, her grace of limb and figure\nshould be more alluring than ever before. The same words, indeed, were\nrunning through both women's minds.\n\n\"For the last time,\" said Celia to herself, thinking of these horrible\nseances, of which to-night should see the end.\n\n\"For the last time,\" said Helene Vauquier too. For the last time she\nlaced the girl's dress. There would be no more patient and careful\nservice for Mlle. Celie after to-night. But she should have it and to\nspare to-night. She should be conscious that her beauty had never made\nso strong an appeal; that she was never so fit for life as at the\nmoment when the end had come. One thing Helene regretted. She would\nhave liked Celia--Celia, smiling at herself in the glass--to know\nsuddenly what was in store for her! She saw in imagination the colour\ndie from the cheeks, the eyes stare wide with terror.\n\n\"Celie! Celie!\"\n\nAgain the impatient voice rang up the stairs, as Helene pinned the\ngirl's hat upon her fair head. Celie sprang up, took a quick step or\ntwo towards the door, and stopped in dismay. The swish of her long\nsatin train must betray her. She caught up the dress and tried again.\nEven so, the rustle of it was heard.\n\n\"I shall have to be very careful. You will help me, Helene?\"\n\n\"Of course, mademoiselle. I will sit underneath the switch of the light\nin the salon. If madame, your visitor, makes the experiment too\ndifficult, I will find a way to help you,\" said Helene Vauquier, and as\nshe spoke she handed Celia a long pair of white gloves.\n\n\"I shall not want them,\" said Celia.\n\n\"Mme. Dauvray ordered me to give them to you,\" replied Helene.\n\nCelia took them hurriedly, picked up a white scarf of tulle, and ran\ndown the stairs. Helene Vauquier listened at the door and heard\nmadame's voice in feverish anger.\n\n\"We have been waiting for you, Celie. You have been an age.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier laughed softly to herself, took out Celia's white frock\nfrom the wardrobe, turned off the lights, and followed her down to the\nhall. She placed the cloak just outside the door of the salon. Then she\ncarefully turned out all the lights in the hall and in the kitchen and\nwent into the salon. The rest of the house was in darkness. This room\nwas brightly lit; and it had been made ready.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE SEANCE\n\n\nHelene Vauquier locked the door of the salon upon the inside and placed\nthe key upon the mantel-shelf, as she had always done whenever a seance\nhad been held. The curtains had been loosened at the sides of the\narched recess in front of the glass doors, ready to be drawn across.\nInside the recess, against one of the pillars which supported the arch,\na high stool without a back, taken from the hall, had been placed, and\nthe back legs of the stool had been lashed with cord firmly to the\npillar, so that it could not be moved. The round table had been put in\nposition, with three chairs about it. Mme. Dauvray waited impatiently.\nCelia stood apparently unconcerned, apparently lost to all that was\ngoing on. Her eyes saw no one. Adele looked up at Celia, and laughed\nmaliciously.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I see, is in the very mood to produce the most wonderful\nphenomena. But it will be better, I think, madame,\" she said, turning\nto Mme. Dauvray, \"that Mlle. Celie should put on those gloves which I\nsee she has thrown on to a chair. It will be a little more difficult\nfor mademoiselle to loosen these cords, should she wish to do so.\"\n\nThe argument silenced Celia. If she refused this condition now she\nwould excite Mme. Dauvray to a terrible suspicion. She drew on her\ngloves ruefully and slowly, smoothed them over her elbows, and buttoned\nthem. To free her hands with her fingers and wrists already hampered in\ngloves would not be so easy a task. But there was no escape. Adele\nRossignol was watching her with a satiric smile. Mme. Dauvray was\nurging her to be quick. Obeying a second order the girl raised her\nskirt and extended a slim foot in a pale-green silk stocking and a\nsatin slipper to match. Adele was content. Celia was wearing the shoes\nshe was meant to wear. They were made upon the very same last as those\nwhich Celia had just kicked off upstairs. An almost imperceptible nod\nfrom Helene Vauquier, moreover, assured her.\n\nShe took up a length of the thin cord.\n\n\"Now, how are we to begin?\" she said awkwardly. \"I think I will ask\nyou, mademoiselle, to put your hands behind you.\"\n\nCelia turned her back and crossed her wrists. She stood in her satin\nfrock, with her white arms and shoulders bare, her slender throat\nsupporting her small head with its heavy curls, her big hat--a picture\nof young grace and beauty. She would have had an easy task that night\nhad there been men instead of women to put her to the test. But the\nwomen were intent upon their own ends: Mme. Dauvray eager for her\nseance, Adele Tace and Helene Vauquier for the climax of their plot.\n\nCelia clenched her hands to make the muscles of her wrists rigid to\nresist the pressure of the cord. Adele quietly unclasped them and\nplaced them palm to palm. And at once Celia became uneasy. It was not\nmerely the action, significant though it was of Adele's alertness to\nthwart her, which troubled Celia. But she was extraordinarily receptive\nof impressions, extraordinarily quick to feel, from a touch, some dim\nsensation of the thought of the one who touched her. So now the touch\nof Adele's swift, strong, nervous hands caused her a queer, vague shock\nof discomfort. It was no more than that at the moment, but it was quite\ndefinite as that.\n\n\"Keep your hands so, please, mademoiselle,\" said Adele; \"your fingers\nloose.\"\n\nAnd the next moment Celia winced and had to bite her lip to prevent a\ncry. The thin cord was wound twice about her wrists, drawn cruelly\ntight and then cunningly knotted. For one second Celia was thankful for\nher gloves; the next, more than ever she regretted that she wore them.\nIt would have been difficult enough for her to free her hands now, even\nwithout them. And upon that a worse thing befell her.\n\n\"I beg mademoiselle's pardon if I hurt her,\" said Adele.\n\nAnd she tied the girl's thumbs and little fingers. To slacken the knots\nshe must have the use of her fingers, even though her gloves made them\nfumble. Now she had lost the use of them altogether. She began to feel\nthat she was in master-hands. She was sure of it the next instant. For\nAdele stood up, and, passing a cord round the upper part of her arms,\ndrew her elbows back. To bring any strength to help her in wriggling\nher hands free she must be able to raise her elbows. With them trussed\nin the small of her back she was robbed entirely of her strength. And\nall the time her strange uneasiness grew. She made a movement of\nrevolt, and at once the cord was loosened.\n\n\"Mlle. Celie objects to my tests,\" said Adele, with a laugh, to Mme.\nDauvray. \"And I do not wonder.\"\n\nCelia saw upon the old woman's foolish and excited face a look of\nveritable consternation.\n\n\"Are you afraid, Celie?\" she asked.\n\nThere was anger, there was menace in the voice, but above all these\nthere was fear--fear that her illusions were to tumble about her. Celia\nheard that note and was quelled by it. This folly of belief, these\nseances, were the one touch of colour in Mme. Dauvray's life. And it\nwas just that instinctive need of colour which had made her so easy to\ndelude. How strong the need is, how seductive the proposal to supply\nit, Celia knew well. She knew it from the experience of her life when\nthe Great Fortinbras was at the climax of his fortunes. She had\ntravelled much amongst monotonous, drab towns without character or\namusements. She had kept her eyes open. She had seen that it was from\nthe denizens of the dull streets in these towns that the quack\nreligions won their recruits. Mme. Dauvray's life had been a\nfeatureless sort of affair until these experiments had come to colour\nit. Madame Dauvray must at any rate preserve the memory of that colour.\n\n\"No,\" she said boldly; \"I am not afraid,\" and after that she moved no\nmore.\n\nHer elbows were drawn firmly back and tightly bound. She was sure she\ncould not free them. She glanced in despair at Helene Vauquier, and\nthen some glimmer of hope sprang up. For Helene Vauquier gave her a\nlook, a smile of reassurance. It was as if she said, \"I will come to\nyour help.\" Then, to make security still more sure, Adele turned the\ngirl about as unceremoniously as if she had been a doll, and, passing a\ncord at the back of her arms, drew both ends round in front and knotted\nthem at her waist.\n\n\"Now, Celie,\" said Adele, with a vibration in her voice which Celia had\nnot remarked before.\n\nExcitement was gaining upon her, as upon Mme. Dauvray. Her face was\nflushed and shiny, her manner peremptory and quick. Celia's uneasiness\ngrew into fear. She could have used the words which Hanaud spoke the\nnext day in that very room--\"There is something here which I do not\nunderstand.\" The touch of Adele Tace's hands communicated something to\nher--something which filled her with a vague alarm. She could not have\nformulated it if she would; she dared not if she could. She had but to\nstand and submit.\n\n\"Now,\" said Adele.\n\nShe took the girl by the shoulders and set her in a clear space in the\nmiddle of the room, her back to the recess, her face to the mirror,\nwhere all could see her.\n\n\"Now, Celie\"--she had dropped the \"Mlle.\" and the ironic suavity of her\nmanner--\"try to free yourself.\"\n\nFor a moment the girl's shoulders worked, her hands fluttered. But they\nremained helplessly bound.\n\n\"Ah, you will be content, Adele, to-night,\" cried Mme. Dauvray eagerly.\n\nBut even in the midst of her eagerness--so thoroughly had she been\nprepared--there lingered a flavour of doubt, of suspicion. In Celia's\nmind there was still the one desperate resolve.\n\n\"I must succeed to-night,\" she said to herself--\"I must!\"\n\nAdele Rossignol kneeled on the floor behind her. She gathered in\ncarefully the girl's frock. Then she picked up the long train, wound it\ntightly round her limbs, pinioning and swathing them in the folds of\nsatin, and secured the folds with a cord about the knees.\n\nShe stood up again.\n\n\"Can you walk, Celie?\" she asked. \"Try!\"\n\nWith Helene Vauquier to support her if she fell, Celia took a tiny\nshuffling step forward, feeling supremely ridiculous. No one, however,\nof her audience was inclined to laugh. To Mme. Dauvray the whole\nbusiness was as serious as the most solemn ceremonial. Adele was intent\nupon making her knots secure. Helene Vauquier was the well-bred servant\nwho knew her place. It was not for her to laugh at her young mistress,\nin however ludicrous a situation she might be.\n\n\"Now,\" said Adele, \"we will tie mademoiselle's ankles, and then we\nshall be ready for Mme. de Montespan.\"\n\nThe raillery in her voice had a note of savagery in it now. Celia's\nvague terror grew. She had a feeling that a beast was waking in the\nwoman, and with it came a growing premonition of failure. Vainly she\ncried to herself, \"I must not fail to-night.\" But she felt\ninstinctively that there was a stronger personality than her own in\nthat room, taming her, condemning her to failure, influencing the\nothers.\n\nShe was placed in a chair. Adele passed a cord round her ankles, and\nthe mere touch of it quickened Celia to a spasm of revolt. Her last\nlittle remnant of liberty was being taken from her. She raised herself,\nor rather would have raised herself. But Helene with gentle hands held\nher in the chair, and whispered under her breath:\n\n\"Have no fear! Madame is watching.\"\n\nAdele looked fiercely up into the girl's face.\n\n\"Keep still, HEIN, LA PETITE!\" she cried. And the epithet--\"little\none\"--was a light to Celia. Till now, upon these occasions, with her\nblack ceremonial dress, her air of aloofness, her vague eyes, and the\ndignity of her carriage, she had already produced some part of their\neffect before the seance had begun. She had been wont to sail into the\nroom, distant, mystical. She had her audience already expectant of\nmysteries, prepared for marvels. Her work was already half done. But\nnow of all that help she was deprived. She was no longer a person\naloof, a prophetess, a seer of visions; she was simply a\nsmartly-dressed girl of to-day, trussed up in a ridiculous and painful\nposition--that was all. The dignity was gone. And the more she realised\nthat, the more she was hindered from influencing her audience, the less\nable she was to concentrate her mind upon them, to will them to favour\nher. Mme. Dauvray's suspicions, she was sure, were still awake. She\ncould not quell them. There was a stronger personality than hers at\nwork in the room. The cord bit through her thin stockings into her\nankles. She dared not complain. It was savagely tied. She made no\nremonstrance. And then Helene Vauquier raised her up from the chair and\nlifted her easily off the ground. For a moment she held her so. If\nCelia had felt ridiculous before, she knew that she was ten times more\nso now. She could see herself as she hung in Helene Vauquier's arms,\nwith her delicate frock ludicrously swathed and swaddled about her\nlegs. But, again, of those who watched her no one smiled.\n\n\"We have had no such tests as these,\" Mme. Dauvray explained, half in\nfear, half in hope.\n\nAdele Rossignol looked the girl over and nodded her head with\nsatisfaction. She had no animosity towards Celia; she had really no\nfeeling of any kind for her or against her. Fortunately she was unaware\nat this time that Harry Wethermill had been paying his court to her or\nit would have gone worse with Mlle. Celie before the night was out.\nMlle. Celie was just a pawn in a very dangerous game which she happened\nto be playing, and she had succeeded in engineering her pawn into the\ndesired condition of helplessness. She was content.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" she said, with a smile, \"you wish me to believe. You\nhave now your opportunity.\"\n\nOpportunity! And she was helpless. She knew very well that she could\nnever free herself from these cords without Helene's help. She would\nfail, miserably and shamefully fail.\n\n\"It was madame who wished you to believe,\" she stammered.\n\nAnd Adele Rossignol laughed suddenly--a short, loud, harsh laugh, which\njarred upon the quiet of the room. It turned Celia's vague alarm into a\ndefinite terror. Some magnetic current brought her grave messages of\nfear. The air about her seemed to tingle with strange menaces. She\nlooked at Adele. Did they emanate from her? And her terror answered her\n\"Yes.\" She made her mistake in that. The strong personality in the room\nwas not Adele Rossignol, but Helene Vauquier, who held her like a child\nin her arms. But she was definitely aware of danger, and too late aware\nof it. She struggled vainly. From her head to her feet she was\npowerless. She cried out hysterically to her patron:\n\n\"Madame! Madame! There is something--a presence here--some one who\nmeans harm! I know it!\"\n\nAnd upon the old woman's face there came a look, not of alarm, but of\nextraordinary relief. The genuine, heartfelt cry restored her\nconfidence in Celia.\n\n\"Some one--who means harm!\" she whispered, trembling with excitement.\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle is already under control,\" said Helene, using the\njargon which she had learnt from Celia's lips.\n\nAdele Rossignol grinned.\n\n\"Yes, LA PETITE is under control,\" she repeated, with a sneer; and all\nthe elegance of her velvet gown was unable to hide her any longer from\nCelia's knowledge. Her grin had betrayed her. She was of the dregs. But\nHelene Vauquier whispered:\n\n\"Keep still, mademoiselle. I shall help you.\"\n\nVauquier carried the girl into the recess and placed her upon the\nstool. With a long cord Adele bound her by the arms and the waist to\nthe pillar, and her ankles she fastened to the rung of the stool, so\nthat they could not touch the ground.\n\n\"Thus we shall be sure that when we hear rapping it will be the\nspirits, and not the heels, which rap,\" she said. \"Yes, I am contented\nnow.\" And she added, with a smile, \"Celie may even have her scarf,\"\nand, picking up a white scarf of tulle which Celia had brought down\nwith her, she placed it carelessly round her shoulders.\n\n\"Wait!\" Helene Vauquier whispered in Celia's ear.\n\nTo the cord about Celia's waist Adele was fastening a longer line.\n\n\"I shall keep my foot on the other end of this,\" she said, \"when the\nlights are out, and I shall know then if our little one frees herself.\"\n\nThe three women went out of the recess. And the next moment the heavy\nsilk curtains swung across the opening, leaving Celia in darkness.\nQuickly and noiselessly the poor girl began to twist and work her\nhands. But she only bruised her wrists. This was to be the last of the\nseances. But it must succeed! So much of Mme. Dauvray's happiness, so\nmuch of her own, hung upon its success. Let her fail to-night, she\nwould be surely turned from the door. The story of her trickery and her\nexposure would run through Aix. And she had not told Harry! It would\nreach his ears from others. He would never forgive her. To face the\nold, difficult life of poverty and perhaps starvation again, and again\nalone, would be hard enough; but to face it with Harry Wethermill's\ncontempt added to its burdens--as the poor girl believed she surely\nwould have to do--no, that would be impossible! Not this time would she\nturn away from the Seine, because it was so terrible and cold. If she\nhad had the courage to tell him yesterday, he would have forgiven,\nsurely he would! The tears gathered in her eyes and rolled down her\ncheeks. What would become of her now? She was in pain besides. The\ncords about her arms and ankles tortured her. And she feared--yes,\ndesperately she feared the effect of the exposure upon Mme. Dauvray.\nShe had been treated as a daughter; now she was in return to rob Mme.\nDauvray of the belief which had become the passion of her life.\n\n\"Let us take our seats at the table,\" she heard Mme. Dauvray say.\n\"Helene, you are by the switch of the electric light. Will you turn it\noff?\" And upon that Helene whispered, yet so that the whisper reached\nto Celia and awakened hope:\n\n\"Wait! I will see what she is doing.\"\n\nThe curtains opened, and Helene Vauquier slipped to the girl's side.\n\nCelia checked her tears. She smiled imploringly, gratefully.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" asked Helene, in a voice so low that the movement of\nher mouth rather than the words made the question clear.\n\nCelia raised her head to answer. And then a thing incomprehensible to\nher happened. As she opened her lips Helene Vauquier swiftly forced a\nhandkerchief in between the girl's teeth, and lifting the scarf from\nher shoulders wound it tightly twice across her mouth, binding her\nlips, and made it fast under the brim of her hat behind her head. Celia\ntried to scream; she could not utter a sound. She stared at Helene with\nincredulous, horror-stricken eyes. Helene nodded at her with a cruel\ngrin of satisfaction, and Celia realised, though she did not\nunderstand, something of the rancour and the hatred which seethed\nagainst her in the heart of the woman whom she had supplanted. Helene\nVauquier meant to expose her to-night; Celia had not a doubt of it.\nThat was her explanation of Helene Vauquier's treachery; and believing\nthat error, she believed yet another--that she had reached the terrible\nclimax of her troubles. She was only at the beginning of them.\n\n\"Helene!\" cried Mme. Dauvray sharply. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe maid instantly slid back into the room.\n\n\"Mademoiselle has not moved,\" she said.\n\nCelia heard the women settle in their chairs about the table.\n\n\"Is madame ready?\" asked Helene; and then there was the sound of the\nsnap of a switch. In the salon darkness had come.\n\nIf only she had not been wearing her gloves, Celia thought, she might\npossibly have just been able to free her fingers and her supple hands\nfrom their bonds. But as it was she was helpless. She could only sit\nand wait until the audience in the salon grew tired of waiting and came\nto her. She closed her eyes, pondering if by any chance she could\nexcuse her failure. But her heart sank within her as she thought of\nMme. Rossignol's raillery. No, it was all over for her. ...\n\nShe opened her eyes, and she wondered. It seemed to her that there was\nmore light in the recess than there had been when she closed them. Very\nlikely her eyes were growing used to the darkness. Yet--yet--she ought\nnot to be able to distinguish quite so clearly the white pillar\nopposite to her. She looked towards the glass doors and understood. The\nwooden shutters outside the doors were not quite closed. They had been\ncarelessly left unbolted. A chink from lintel to floor let in a grey\nthread of light. Celia heard the women whispering in the salon, and\nturned her head to catch the words.\n\n\"Do you hear any sound?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Was that a hand which touched me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We must wait.\"\n\nAnd so silence came again, and suddenly there was quite a rush of light\ninto the recess. Celia was startled. She turned her head back again\ntowards the window. The wooden door had swung a little more open. There\nwas a wider chink to let the twilight of that starlit darkness through.\nAnd as she looked, the chink slowly broadened and broadened, the door\nswung slowly back on hinges which were strangely silent. Celia stared\nat the widening panel of grey light with a vague terror. It was strange\nthat she could hear no whisper of wind in the garden. Why, oh, why was\nthat latticed door opening so noiselessly? Almost she believed that the\nspirits after all... And suddenly the recess darkened again, and Celia\nsat with her heart leaping and shivering in her breast. There was\nsomething black against the glass doors--a man. He had appeared as\nsilently, as suddenly, as any apparition. He stood blocking out the\nlight, pressing his face against the glass, peering into the room. For\na moment the shock of horror stunned her. Then she tore frantically at\nthe cords. All thought of failure, of exposure, of dismissal had fled\nfrom her. The three poor women--that was her thought--were sitting\nunwarned, unsuspecting, defenceless in the pitch-blackness of the\nsalon. A few feet away a man, a thief, was peering in. They were\nwaiting for strange things to happen in the darkness. Strange and\nterrible things would happen unless she could free herself, unless she\ncould warn them. And she could not. Her struggles were mere efforts to\nstruggle, futile, a shiver from head to foot, and noiseless as a\nshiver. Adele Rossignol had done her work well and thoroughly. Celia's\narms, her waist, her ankles were pinioned; only the bandage over her\nmouth seemed to be loosening. Then upon horror, horror was added. The\nman touched the glass doors, and they swung silently inwards. They,\ntoo, had been carelessly left unbolted. The man stepped without a sound\nover the sill into the room. And, as he stepped, fear for herself drove\nout for the moment from Celia's thoughts fear for the three women in\nthe black room. If only he did not see her! She pressed herself against\nthe pillar. He might overlook her, perhaps! His eyes would not be so\naccustomed to the darkness of the recess as hers. He might pass her\nunnoticed--if only he did not touch some fold of her dress.\n\nAnd then, in the midst of her terror, she experienced so great a\nrevulsion from despair to joy that a faintness came upon her, and she\nalmost swooned. She saw who the intruder was. For when he stepped into\nthe recess he turned towards her, and the dim light struck upon him and\nshowed her the contour of his face. It was her lover, Harry Wethermill.\nWhy he had come at this hour, and in this strange way, she did not\nconsider. Now she must attract his eyes, now her fear was lest he\nshould not see her.\n\nBut he came at once straight towards her. He stood in front of her,\nlooking into her eyes. But he uttered no cry. He made no movement of\nsurprise. Celia did not understand it. His face was in the shadow now\nand she could not see it. Of course, he was stunned, amazed.\nBut--but--he stood almost as if he had expected to find her there and\njust in that helpless attitude. It was absurd, of course, but he seemed\nto look upon her helplessness as nothing out of the ordinary way. And\nhe raised no hand to set her free. A chill struck through her. But the\nnext moment he did raise his hand and the blood flowed again, at her\nheart. Of course, she was in the darkness. He had not seen her plight.\nEven now he was only beginning to be aware of it. For his hand touched\nthe bandage over her mouth--tentatively. He felt for the knot under the\nbroad brim of her hat at the back of her head. He found it. In a moment\nshe would be free. She kept her head quite still, and then--why was he\nso long? she asked herself. Oh, it was not possible! But her heart\nseemed to stop, and she knew that it was not only possible--it was\ntrue: he was tightening the scarf, not loosening it. The folds bound\nher lips more surely. She felt the ends drawn close at the back of her\nhead. In a frenzy she tried to shake her head free. But he held her\nface firmly and finished his work. He was wearing gloves, she noticed\nwith horror, just as thieves do. Then his hands slid down her trembling\narms and tested the cord about her wrists. There was something horribly\ndeliberate about his movements. Celia, even at that moment, even with\nhim, had the sensation which had possessed her in the salon. It was the\npersonal equation on which she was used to rely. But neither Adele nor\nthis--this STRANGER was considering her as even a human being. She was\na pawn in their game, and they used her, careless of her terror, her\nbeauty, her pain. Then he freed from her waist the long cord which ran\nbeneath the curtain to Adele Rossignol's foot. Celia's first thought\nwas one of relief. He would jerk the cord unwittingly. They would come\ninto the recess and see him. And then the real truth flashed in upon\nher blindingly. He had jerked the cord, but he had jerked it\ndeliberately. He was already winding it up in a coil as it slid\nnoiselessly across the polished floor beneath the curtains towards him.\nHe had given a signal to Adele Rossignol. All that woman's scepticism\nand precaution against trickery had been a mere blind, under cover of\nwhich she had been able to pack the girl away securely without arousing\nher suspicions. Helene Vauquier was in the plot, too. The scarf at\nCelia's mouth was proof of that. As if to add proof to proof, she heard\nAdele Rossignol speak in answer to the signal.\n\n\"Are we all ready? Have you got Mme. Dauvray's left hand, Helene?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" answered the maid.\n\n\"And I have her right hand. Now give me yours, and thus we are in a\ncircle about the table.\"\n\nCelia, in her mind, could see them sitting about the round table in the\ndarkness, Mme. Dauvray between the two women, securely held by them.\nAnd she herself could not utter a cry--could not move a muscle to help\nher.\n\nWethermill crept back on noiseless feet to the window, closed the\nwooden doors, and slid the bolts into their sockets. Yes, Helene\nVauquier was in the plot. The bolts and the hinges would not have\nworked so smoothly but for her. Darkness again filled the recess\ninstead of the grey twilight. But in a moment a faint breath of wind\nplayed upon Celia's forehead, and she knew that the man had parted the\ncurtains and slipped into the room. Celia let her head fall towards her\nshoulder. She was sick and faint with terror. Her lover was in this\nplot--the lover in whom she had felt so much pride, for whose sake she\nhad taken herself so bitterly to task. He was the associate of Adele\nRossignol, of Helene Vauquier. He had used her, Celia, as an instrument\nfor his crime. All their hours together at the Villa des Fleurs--here\nto-night was their culmination. The blood buzzed in her ears and\nhammered in the veins of her temples. In front of her eyes the darkness\nwhirled, flecked with fire. She would have fallen, but she could not\nfall. Then, in the silence, a tambourine jangled. There was to be a\nseance to-night, then, and the seance had begun. In a dreadful suspense\nshe heard Mme. Dauvray speak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nHELENE EXPLAINS\n\n\nAnd what she heard made her blood run cold.\n\nMme. Dauvray spoke in a hushed, awestruck voice.\n\n\"There is a presence in the room.\"\n\nIt was horrible to Celia that the poor woman was speaking the jargon\nwhich she herself had taught to her.\n\n\"I will speak to it,\" said Mme. Dauvray, and raising her voice a\nlittle, she asked: \"Who are you that come to us from the spirit-world?\"\n\nNo answer came, but all the while Celia knew that Wethermill was\nstealing noiselessly across the floor towards that voice which spoke\nthis professional patter with so simple a solemnity.\n\n\"Answer!\" she said. And the next moment she uttered a little shrill\ncry--a cry of enthusiasm. \"Fingers touch my forehead--now they touch my\ncheek--now they touch my throat!\"\n\nAnd upon that the voice ceased. But a dry, choking sound was heard, and\na horrible scuffling and tapping of feet upon the polished floor, a\nsound most dreadful. They were murdering her--murdering an old, kind\nwoman silently and methodically in the darkness. The girl strained and\ntwisted against the pillar furiously, like an animal in a trap. But the\ncoils of rope held her; the scarf suffocated her. The scuffling became\na spasmodic sound, with intervals between, and then ceased altogether.\nA voice spoke--a man's voice--Wethermill's. But Celia would never have\nrecognised it--it had so shrill and fearful an intonation.\n\n\"That's horrible,\" he said, and his voice suddenly rose to a scream.\n\n\"Hush!\" Helene Vauquier whispered sharply. \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"She fell against me--her whole weight. Oh!\"\n\n\"You are afraid of her!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" And in the darkness Wethermill's voice came querulously\nbetween long breaths. \"Yes, NOW I am afraid of her!\"\n\nHelene Vauquier replied again contemptuously. She spoke aloud and quite\nindifferently. Nothing of any importance whatever, one would have\ngathered, had occurred.\n\n\"I will turn on the light,\" she said. And through the chinks in the\ncurtain the bright light shone. Celia heard a loud rattle upon the\ntable, and then fainter sounds of the same kind. And as a kind of\nhorrible accompaniment there ran the laboured breathing of the man,\nwhich broke now and then with a sobbing sound. They were stripping Mme.\nDauvray of her pearl necklace, her bracelets, and her rings. Celia had\na sudden importunate vision of the old woman's fat, podgy hands loaded\nwith brilliants. A jingle of keys followed.\n\n\"That's all,\" Helene Vauquier said. She might have just turned out the\npocket of an old dress.\n\nThere was the sound of something heavy and inert falling with a dull\ncrash upon the floor. A woman laughed, and again it was Helene Vauquier.\n\n\"Which is the key of the safe?\" asked Adele.\n\nAnd Helene Vauquier replied:--\n\n\"That one.\"\n\nCelia heard some one drop heavily into a chair. It was Wethermill, and\nhe buried his face in his hands. Helene went over to him and laid her\nhand upon his shoulder and shook him.\n\n\"Do you go and get her jewels out of the safe,\" she said, and she spoke\nwith a rough friendliness.\n\n\"You promised you would blindfold the girl,\" he cried hoarsely.\n\nHelene Vauquier laughed.\n\n\"Did I?\" she said. \"Well, what does it matter?\"\n\n\"There would have been no need to--\" And his voice broke off shudderingly.\n\n\"Wouldn't there? And what of us--Adele and me? She knows certainly that\nwe are here. Come, go and get the jewels. The key of the door's on the\nmantelshelf. While you are away we two will arrange the pretty baby in\nthere.\"\n\nShe pointed to the recess; her voice rang with contempt. Wethermill\nstaggered across the room like a drunkard, and picked up the key in\ntrembling fingers. Celia heard it turn in the lock, and the door bang.\nWethermill had gone upstairs.\n\nCelia leaned back, her heart fainting within her. Arrange! It was her\nturn now. She was to be \"arranged.\" She had no doubt what sinister\nmeaning that innocent word concealed. The dry, choking sound, the\nhorrid scuffling of feet upon the floor, were in her ears. And it had\ntaken so long--so terribly long!\n\nShe heard the door open again and shut again. Then steps approached the\nrecess. The curtains were flung back, and the two women stood in front\nof her--the tall Adele Rossignol with her red hair and her coarse good\nlooks and her sapphire dress, and the hard-featured, sallow maid. The\nmaid was carrying Celia's white coat. They did not mean to murder her,\nthen. They meant to take her away, and even then a spark of hope lit up\nin the girl's bosom. For even with her illusions crushed she still\nclung to life with all the passion of her young soul.\n\nThe two women stood and looked at her; and then Adele Rossignol burst\nout laughing. Vauquier approached the girl, and Celia had a moment's\nhope that she meant to free her altogether, but she only loosed the\ncords which fixed her to the pillar and the high stool.\n\n\"Mademoiselle will pardon me for laughing,\" said Adele Rossignol\npolitely; \"but it was mademoiselle who invited me to try my hand. And\nreally, for so smart a young lady, mademoiselle looks too ridiculous.\"\n\nShe lifted the girl up and carried her back writhing and struggling\ninto the salon. The whole of the pretty room was within view, but in\nthe embrasure of a window something lay dreadfully still and quiet.\nCelia held her head averted. But it was there, and, though it was\nthere, all the while the women joked and laughed, Adele Rossignol\nfeverishly, Helene Vauquier with a real glee most horrible to see.\n\n\"I beg mademoiselle not to listen to what Adele is saying,\" exclaimed\nHelene. And she began to ape in a mincing, extravagant fashion the\nmanner of a saleswoman in a shop. \"Mademoiselle has never looked so\nravishing. This style is the last word of fashion. It is what there is\nof most CHIC. Of course, mademoiselle understands that the costume is\nnot intended for playing the piano. Nor, indeed, for the ballroom. It\nleaps to one's eyes that dancing would be difficult. Nor is it intended\nfor much conversation. It is a costume for a mood of quiet reflection.\nBut I assure mademoiselle that for pretty young ladies who are the\nfavourites of rich old women it is the style most recommended by the\ncriminal classes.\"\n\nAll the woman's bitter rancour against Celia, hidden for months beneath\na mask of humility, burst out and ran riot now. She went to Adele\nRossignol's help, and they flung the girl face downwards upon the sofa.\nHer face struck the cushion at one end, her feet the cushion at the\nother. The breath was struck out of her body. She lay with her bosom\nheaving.\n\nHelene Vauquier watched her for a moment with a grin, paying herself\nnow for her respectful speeches and attendance.\n\n\"Yes, lie quietly and reflect, little fool!\" she said savagely. \"Were\nyou wise to come here and interfere with Helene Vauquier? Hadn't you\nbetter have stayed and danced in your rags at Montmartre? Are the smart\nfrocks and the pretty hats and the good dinners worth the price? Ask\nyourself these questions, my dainty little friend!\"\n\nShe drew up a chair to Celia's side, and sat down upon it comfortably.\n\n\"I will tell you what we are going to do with you, Mlle. Celie. Adele\nRossignol and that kind gentleman, M. Wethermill, are going to take you\naway with them. You will be glad to go, won't you, dearie? For you love\nM. Wethermill, don't you? Oh, they won't keep you long enough for you\nto get tired of them. Do not fear! But you will not come back, Mile.\nCelie. No; you have seen too much to-night. And every one will think\nthat Mlle. Celie helped to murder and rob her benefactress. They are\ncertain to suspect some one, so why not you, pretty one?\"\n\nCelia made no movement. She lay trying to believe that no crime had\nbeen committed, that that lifeless body did not lie against the wall.\nAnd then she heard in the room above a bed wheeled roughly from its\nplace.\n\nThe two women heard it too, and looked at one another.\n\n\"He should look in the safe,\" said Vauquier. \"Go and see what he is\ndoing.\"\n\nAnd Adele Rossignol ran from the room.\n\nAs soon as she was gone Vauquier followed to the door, listened, closed\nit gently, and came back. She stooped down.\n\n\"Mlle. Celie,\" she said, in a smooth, silky voice, which terrified the\ngirl more than her harsh tones, \"there is just one little thing wrong\nin your appearance, one tiny little piece of bad taste, if mademoiselle\nwill pardon a poor servant the expression. I did not mention it before\nAdele Rossignol; she is so severe in her criticism, is she not? But\nsince we are alone, I will presume to point out to mademoiselle that\nthose diamond eardrops which I see peeping out under the scarf are a\nlittle ostentatious in her present predicament. They are a provocation\nto thieves. Will mademoiselle permit me to remove them?\"\n\nShe caught her by the neck and lifted her up. She pushed the lace scarf\nup at the side of Celia's head. Celia began to struggle furiously,\nconvulsively. She kicked and writhed, and a little tearing sound was\nheard. One of her shoe-buckles had caught in the thin silk covering of\nthe cushion and slit it. Helene Vauquier let her fall. She felt\ncomposedly in her pocket, and drew from it an aluminium flask--the same\nflask which Lemerre was afterward to snatch up in the bedroom in\nGeneva. Celia stared at her in dread. She saw the flask flashing in the\nlight. She shrank from it. She wondered what new horror was to grip\nher. Helene unscrewed the top and laughed pleasantly.\n\n\"Mlle. Celie is under control,\" she said. \"We shall have to teach her\nthat it is not polite in young ladies to kick.\" She pressed Celia down\nwith a hand upon her back, and her voice changed. \"Lie still,\" she\ncommanded savagely. \"Do you hear? Do you know what this is, Mlle.\nCelie?\" And she held the flask towards the girl's face. \"This is\nvitriol, my pretty one. Move, and I'll spoil these smooth white\nshoulders for you. How would you like that?\"\n\nCelia shuddered from head to foot, and, burying her face in the\ncushion, lay trembling. She would have begged for death upon her knees\nrather than suffer this horror. She felt Vauquier's fingers lingering\nwith a dreadful caressing touch upon her shoulders and about her\nthroat. She was within an ace of the torture, the disfigurement, and\nshe knew it. She could not pray for mercy. She could only lie quite\nstill, as she was bidden, trying to control the shuddering of her limbs\nand body.\n\n\"It would be a good lesson for Mlle. Celie,\" Helene continued slowly.\n\"I think that if Mlle. Celie will forgive the liberty I ought to\ninflict it. One little tilt of the flask and the satin of these pretty\nshoulders--\"\n\nShe broke off suddenly and listened. Some sound heard outside had given\nCelia a respite, perhaps more than a respite. Helene set the flask down\nupon the table. Her avarice had got the better of her hatred. She\nroughly plucked the earrings out of the girl's ears. She hid them\nquickly in the bosom of her dress with her eye upon the door. She did\nnot see a drop of blood gather on the lobe of Celia's ear and fall into\nthe cushion on which her face was pressed. She had hardly hidden them\naway before the door opened and Adele Rossignol burst into the room.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Vauquier.\n\n\"The safe's empty. We have searched the room. We have found nothing,\"\nshe cried.\n\n\"Everything is in the safe,\" Helene insisted.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe two women ran out of the room and up the stairs. Celia, lying on\nthe settee, heard all the quiet of the house change to noise and\nconfusion. It was as though a tornado raged in the room overhead.\nFurniture was tossed about and over the room, feet stamped and ran,\nlocks were smashed in with heavy blows. For many minutes the storm\nraged. Then it ceased, and she heard the accomplices clattering down\nthe stairs without a thought of the noise they made. They burst into\nthe room. Harry Wethermill was laughing hysterically, like a man off\nhis head. He had been wearing a long dark overcoat when he entered the\nhouse; now he carried the coat over his arm. He was in a dinner-jacket,\nand his black clothes were dusty and disordered.\n\n\"It's all for nothing!\" he screamed rather than cried. \"Nothing but the\none necklace and a handful of rings!\"\n\nIn a frenzy he actually stooped over the dead woman and questioned her.\n\n\"Tell us--where did you hide them?\" he cried.\n\n\"The girl will know,\" said Helene.\n\nWethermill rose up and looked wildly at Celia.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said.\n\nHe had no scruple, no pity any longer for the girl. There was no gain\nfrom the crime unless she spoke. He would have placed his head in the\nguillotine for nothing. He ran to the writing-table, tore off half a\nsheet of paper, and brought it over with a pencil to the sofa. He gave\nthem to Vauquier to hold, and drawing out the sofa from the wall\nslipped in behind. He lifted up Celia with Rossignol's help, and made\nher sit in the middle of the sofa with her feet upon the ground. He\nunbound her wrists and fingers, and Vauquier placed the writing-pad and\nthe paper on the girl's knees. Her arms were still pinioned above the\nelbows; she could not raise her hands high enough to snatch the scarf\nfrom her lips. But with the pad held up to her she could write.\n\n\"Where did she keep her jewels! Quick! Take the pencil and write,\" said\nWethermill, holding her left wrist.\n\nVauquier thrust the pencil into her right hand, and awkwardly and\nslowly her gloved fingers moved across the page.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she wrote; and, with an oath, Wethermill snatched the\npaper up, tore it into pieces, and threw it down.\n\n\"You have got to know,\" he said, his face purple with passion, and he\nflung out his arm as though he would dash his fist into her face. But\nas he stood with his arm poised there came a singular change upon his\nface.\n\n\"Did you hear anything?\" he asked in a whisper.\n\nAll listened, and all heard in the quiet of the night a faint click,\nand after an interval they heard it again, and after another but\nshorter interval yet once more.\n\n\"That's the gate,\" said Wethermill in a whisper of fear, and a pulse of\nhope stirred within Celia.\n\nHe seized her wrists, crushed them together behind her, and swiftly\nfastened them once more. Adele Rossignol sat down upon the floor, took\nthe girl's feet upon her lap, and quietly wrenched off her shoes.\n\n\"The light,\" cried Wethermill in an agonised voice, and Helena Vauquier\nflew across the room and turned it off.\n\nAll three stood holding their breath, straining their ears in the dark\nroom. On the hard gravel of the drive outside footsteps became faintly\naudible, and grew louder and came near. Adele whispered to Vauquier:\n\n\"Has the girl a lover?\"\n\nAnd Helene Vauquier, even at that moment, laughed quietly.\n\nAll Celia's heart and youth rose in revolt against her extremity. If\nshe could only free her lips! The footsteps came round the corner of\nthe house, they sounded on the drive outside the very window of this\nroom. One cry, and she would be saved. She tossed back her head and\ntried to force the handkerchief out from between her teeth. But\nWethermill's hand covered her mouth and held it closed. The footsteps\nstopped, a light shone for a moment outside. The very handle of the\ndoor was tried. Within a few yards help was there--help and life. Just\na frail latticed wooden door stood between her and them. She tried to\nrise to her feet. Adele Rossignol held her legs firmly. She was\npowerless. She sat with one desperate hope that, whoever it was who was\nin the garden, he would break in. Were it even another murderer, he\nmight have more pity than the callous brutes who held her now; he could\nhave no less. But the footsteps moved away. It was the withdrawal of\nall hope. Celia heard Wethermill behind her draw a long breath of\nrelief. That seemed to Celia almost the cruellest part of the whole\ntragedy. They waited in the darkness until the faint click of the gate\nwas heard once more. Then the light was turned up again.\n\n\"We must go,\" said Wethermill. All the three of them were shaken. They\nstood looking at one another, white and trembling. They spoke in\nwhispers. To get out of the room, to have done with the business--that\nhad suddenly become their chief necessity.\n\nAdele picked up the necklace and the rings from the satin-wood table\nand put them into a pocket-bag which was slung at her waist.\n\n\"Hippolyte shall turn these things into money,\" she said. \"He shall set\nabout it to-morrow. We shall have to keep the girl now--until she tells\nus where the rest is hidden.\"\n\n\"Yes, keep her,\" said Helene. \"We will come over to Geneva in a few\ndays, as soon as we can. We will persuade her to tell.\" She glanced\ndarkly at the girl. Celia shivered.\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said Wethermill. \"But don't harm her. She will tell\nof her own will. You will see. The delay won't hurt now. We can't come\nback and search for a little while.\"\n\nHe was speaking in a quick, agitated voice. And Adele agreed. The\ndesire to be gone had killed even their fury at the loss of their\nprize. Some time they would come back, but they would not search\nnow--they were too unnerved.\n\n\"Helene,\" said Wethermill, \"get to bed. I'll come up with the\nchloroform and put you to sleep.\"\n\nHelene Vauquier hurried upstairs. It was part of her plan that she\nshould be left alone in the villa chloroformed. Thus only could\nsuspicion be averted from herself. She did not shrink from the\ncompletion of the plan now. She went, the strange woman, without a\ntremor to her ordeal. Wethermill took the length of rope which had\nfixed Celia to the pillar.\n\n\"I'll follow,\" he said, and as he turned he stumbled over the body of\nMme. Dauvray. With a shrill cry he kicked it out of his way and crept\nup the stairs. Adele Rossignol quickly set the room in order. She\nremoved the stool from its position in the recess, and carried it to\nits place in the hall. She put Celia's shoes upon her feet, loosening\nthe cord from her ankles. Then she looked about the floor and picked up\nhere and there a scrap of cord. In the silence the clock upon the\nmantelshelf chimed the quarter past eleven. She screwed the stopper on\nthe flask of vitriol very carefully, and put the flask away in her\npocket. She went into the kitchen and fetched the key of the garage.\nShe put her hat on her head. She even picked up and drew on her gloves,\nafraid lest she should leave them behind; and then Wethermill came down\nagain. Adele looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"It is all done,\" he said, with a nod of the head. \"I will bring the\ncar down to the door. Then I'll drive you to Geneva and come back with\nthe car here.\"\n\nHe cautiously opened the latticed door of the window, listened for a\nmoment, and ran silently down the drive. Adele closed the door again,\nbut she did not bolt it. She came back into the room; she looked at\nCelia, as she lay back upon the settee, with a long glance of\nindecision. And then, to Celia's surprise--for she had given up all\nhope--the indecision in her eyes became pity. She suddenly ran across\nthe room and knelt down before Celia. With quick and feverish hands she\nuntied the cord which fastened the train of her skirt about her knees.\n\nAt first Celia shrank away, fearing some new cruelty. But Adele's voice\ncame to her ears, speaking--and speaking with remorse.\n\n\"I can't endure it!\" she whispered. \"You are so young--too young to be\nkilled.\"\n\nThe tears were rolling down Celia's cheeks. Her face was pitiful and\nbeseeching.\n\n\"Don't look at me like that, for God's sake, child!\" Adele went on, and\nshe chafed the girl's ankles for a moment.\n\n\"Can you stand?\" she asked.\n\nCelia nodded her head gratefully. After all, then, she was not to die.\nIt seemed to her hardly possible. But before she could rise a subdued\nwhirr of machinery penetrated into the room, and the motor-car came\nslowly to the front of the villa.\n\n\"Keep still!\" said Adele hurriedly, and she placed herself in front of\nCelia.\n\nWethermill opened the wooden door, while Celia's heart raced in her\nbosom.\n\n\"I will go down and open the gate,\" he whispered. \"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWethermill disappeared; and this time he left the door open. Adele\nhelped Celia to her feet. For a moment she tottered; then she stood\nfirm.\n\n\"Now run!\" whispered Adele. \"Run, child, for your life!\"\n\nCelia did not stop to think whither she should run, or how she should\nescape from Wethermill's search. She could not ask that her lips and\nher hands might be freed. She had but a few seconds. She had one\nthought--to hide herself in the darkness of the garden. Celia fled\nacross the room, sprang wildly over the sill, ran, tripped over her\nskirt, steadied herself, and was swung off the ground by the arms of\nHarry Wethermill.\n\n\"There we are,\" he said, with his shrill, wavering laugh. \"I opened the\ngate before.\" And suddenly Celia hung inert in his arms.\n\nThe light went out in the salon. Adele Rossignol, carrying Celia's\ncloak, stepped out at the side of the window.\n\n\"She has fainted,\" said Wethermill. \"Wipe the mould off her shoes and\noff yours too--carefully. I don't want them to think this car has been\nout of the garage at all.\"\n\nAdele stooped and obeyed. Wethermill opened the door of the car and\nflung Celia into a seat. Adele followed and took her seat opposite the\ngirl. Wethermill stepped carefully again on to the grass, and with the\ntoe of his shoe scraped up and ploughed the impressions which he and\nAdele Rossignol had made on the ground, leaving those which Celia had\nmade. He came back to the window.\n\n\"She has left her footmarks clear enough,\" he whispered. \"There will be\nno doubt in the morning that she went of her own free will.\"\n\nThen he took the chauffeur's seat, and the car glided silently down the\ndrive and out by the gate. As soon as it was on the road it stopped. In\nan instant Adele Rossignol's head was out of the window.\n\n\"What is it?\" she exclaimed in fear.\n\nWethermill pointed to the roof. He had left the light burning in Helene\nVauquier's room.\n\n\"We can't go back now,\" said Adele in a frantic whisper. \"No; it is\nover. I daren't go back.\" And Wethermill jammed down the lever. The car\nsprang forward, and humming steadily over the white road devoured the\nmiles. But they had made their one mistake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE GENEVA ROAD\n\n\nThe car had nearly reached Annecy before Celia woke to consciousness.\nAnd even then she was dazed. She was only aware that she was in the\nmotor-car and travelling at a great speed. She lay back, drinking in\nthe fresh air. Then she moved, and with the movement came to her\nrecollection and the sense of pain. Her arms and wrists were still\nbound behind her, and the cords hurt her like hot wires. Her mouth,\nhowever, and her feet were free. She started forward, and Adele\nRossignol spoke sternly from the seat opposite.\n\n\"Keep still. I am holding the flask in my hand. If you scream, if you\nmake a movement to escape, I shall fling the vitriol in your face,\" she\nsaid.\n\nCelia shrank back, shivering.\n\n\"I won't! I won't!\" she whispered piteously. Her spirit was broken by\nthe horrors of the night's adventure. She lay back and cried quietly in\nthe darkness of the carriage. The car dashed through Annecy. It seemed\nincredible to Celia that less than six hours ago she had been dining\nwith Mme. Dauvray and the woman opposite, who was now her jailer. Mme.\nDauvray lay dead in the little salon, and she herself--she dared not\nthink what lay in front of her. She was to be persuaded--that was the\nword--to tell what she did not know. Meanwhile her name would be\nexecrated through Aix as the murderess of the woman who had saved her.\nThen suddenly the car stopped. There were lights outside. Celia heard\nvoices. A man was speaking to Wethermill. She started and saw Adele\nTace's arm flash upwards. She sank back in terror; and the car rolled\non into the darkness. Adele Tace drew a breath of relief. The one point\nof danger had been passed. They had crossed the Pont de la Caille, they\nwere in Switzerland.\n\nSome long while afterwards the car slackened its speed. By the side of\nit Celia heard the sound of wheels and of the hooves of a horse. A\nsingle-horsed closed landau had been caught up as it jogged along the\nroad. The motor-car stopped; close by the side of it the driver of the\nlandau reined in his horse. Wethermill jumped down from the chauffeur's\nseat, opened the door of the landau, and then put his head in at the\nwindow of the car.\n\n\"Are you ready? Be quick!\"\n\nAdele turned to Celia.\n\n\"Not a word, remember!\"\n\nWethermill flung open the door of the car. Adele took the girl's feet\nand drew them down to the step of the car. Then she pushed her out.\nWethermill caught her in his arms and carried her to the landau. Celia\ndared not cry out. Her hands were helpless, her face at the mercy of\nthat grim flask. Just ahead of them the lights of Geneva were visible,\nand from the lights a silver radiance overspread a patch of sky.\nWethermill placed her in the landau; Adele sprang in behind her and\nclosed the door. The transfer had taken no more than a few seconds. The\nlandau jogged into Geneva; the motor turned and sped back over the\nfifty miles of empty road to Aix.\n\nAs the motor-car rolled away, courage returned for a moment to Celia.\nThe man--the murderer--had gone. She was alone with Adele Rossignol in\na carriage moving no faster than an ordinary trot. Her ankles were\nfree, the gag had been taken from her lips. If only she could free her\nhands and choose a moment when Adele was off her guard she might open\nthe door and spring out on to the road. She saw Adele draw down the\nblinds of the carriage, and very carefully, very secretly, Celia began\nto work her hands behind her. She was an adept; no movement was\nvisible, but, on the other hand, no success was obtained. The knots had\nbeen too cunningly tied. And then Mme. Rossignol touched a button at\nher side in the leather of the carriage.\n\nThe touch turned on a tiny lamp in the roof of the carriage, and she\nraised a warning hand to Celia.\n\n\"Now keep very quiet.\"\n\nRight through the empty streets of Geneva the landau was quietly\ndriven. Adele had peeped from time to time under the blind. There were\nfew people in the streets. Once or twice a sergent-de-ville was seen\nunder the light of a lamp. Celia dared not cry out. Over against her,\npersistently watching her, Adele Rossignol sat with the open flask\nclenched in her hand, and from the vitriol Celia shrank with an\noverwhelming terror. The carriage drove out from the town along the\nwestern edge of the lake.\n\n\"Now listen,\" said Adele. \"As soon as the landau stops the door of the\nhouse opposite to which it stops will open. I shall open the carriage\ndoor myself and you will get out. You must stand close by the carriage\ndoor until I have got out. I shall hold this flask ready in my hand. As\nsoon as I am out you will run across the pavement into the house. You\nwon't speak or scream.\"\n\nAdele Rossignol turned out the lamp and ten minutes later the carriage\npassed down the little street and attracted Mme. Gobin's notice. Marthe\nGobin had lit no light in her room. Adele Rossignol peered out of the\ncarriage. She saw the houses in darkness. She could not see the\nbusybody's face watching the landau from a dark window. She cut the\ncords which fastened the girl's hands. The carriage stopped. She opened\nthe door. Celia sprang out on to the pavement. She sprang so quickly\nthat Adele Rossignol caught and held the train of her dress. But it was\nthe fear of the vitriol which had made her spring so nimbly. It was\nthat, too, which made her run so lightly and quickly into the house.\nThe old woman who acted as servant, Jeanne Tace, received her. Celia\noffered no resistance. The fear of vitriol had made her supple as a\nglove. Jeanne hurried her down the stairs into the little parlour at\nthe back of the house, where supper was laid, and pushed her into a\nchair. Celia let her arms fall forward on the table. She had no hope\nnow. She was friendless and alone in a den of murderers, who meant\nfirst to torture, then to kill her. She would be held up to execration\nas a murderess. No one would know how she had died or what she had\nsuffered. She was in pain, and her throat burned. She buried her face\nin her arms and sobbed. All her body shook with her sobbing. Jeanne\nRossignol took no notice. She treated Celie just as the others had\ndone. Celia was LA PETITE, against whom she had no animosity, by whom\nshe was not to be touched to any tenderness. LA PETITE had\nunconsciously played her useful part in their crime. But her use was\nended now, and they would deal with her accordingly. She removed the\ngirl's hat and cloak and tossed them aside.\n\n\"Now stay quiet until we are ready for you,\" she said. And Celia,\nlifting her head, said in a whisper:\n\n\"Water!\"\n\nThe old woman poured some from a jug and held the glass to Celia's lips.\n\n\"Thank you,\" whispered Celia gratefully, and Adele came into the room.\nShe told the story of the night to Jeanne, and afterwards to Hippolyte\nwhen he joined them.\n\n\"And nothing gained!\" cried the older woman furiously. \"And we have\nhardly a five-franc piece in the house.\"\n\n\"Yes, something,\" said Adele. \"A necklace--a good one--some good rings,\nand bracelets. And we shall find out where the rest is hid--from her.\"\nAnd she nodded at Celia.\n\nThe three people ate their supper, and, while they ate it, discussed\nCelia's fate. She was lying with her head bowed upon her arms at the\nsame table, within a foot of them. But they made no more of her\npresence than if she had been an old shoe. Only once did one of them\nspeak to her.\n\n\"Stop your whimpering,\" said Hippolyte roughly. \"We can hardly hear\nourselves talk.\"\n\nHe was for finishing with the business altogether to-night.\n\n\"It's a mistake,\" he said. \"There's been a bungle, and the sooner we\nare rid of it the better. There's a boat at the bottom of the garden.\"\n\nCelia listened and shuddered. He would have no more compunction over\ndrowning her than he would have had over drowning a blind kitten.\n\n\"It's cursed luck,\" he said. \"But we have got the necklace--that's\nsomething. That's our share, do you see? The young spark can look for\nthe rest.\"\n\nBut Helene Vauquier's wish prevailed. She was the leader. They would\nkeep the girl until she came to Geneva.\n\nThey took her upstairs into the big bedroom overlooking the lake. Adele\nopened the door of the closet, where a truckle-bed stood, and thrust\nthe girl in.\n\n\"This is my room,\" she said warningly, pointing to the bedroom. \"Take\ncare I hear no noise. You might shout yourself hoarse, my pretty one;\nno one else would hear you. But I should, and afterwards--we should no\nlonger be able to call you 'my pretty one,' eh?\"\n\nAnd with a horrible playfulness she pinched the girl's cheek.\n\nThen with old Jeanne's help she stripped Celia and told her to get into\nbed.\n\n\"I'll give her something to keep her quiet,\" said Adele, and she\nfetched her morphia-needle and injected a dose into Celia's arm.\n\nThen they took her clothes away and left her in the darkness. She heard\nthe key turn in the lock, and a moment after the sound of the bedstead\nbeing drawn across the doorway. But she heard no more, for almost\nimmediately she fell asleep.\n\nShe was awakened some time the next day by the door opening. Old Jeanne\nTace brought her in a jug of water and a roll of bread, and locked her\nup again. And a long time afterwards she brought her another supply.\nYet another day had gone, but in that dark cupboard Celia had no means\nof judging time. In the afternoon the newspaper came out with the\nannouncement that Mme. Dauvray's jewellery had been discovered under\nthe boards. Hippolyte brought in the newspaper, and, cursing their\nstupidity, they sat down to decide upon Celia's fate. That, however,\nwas soon arranged. They would dress her in everything which she wore\nwhen she came, so that no trace of her might be discovered. They would\ngive her another dose of morphia, sew her up in a sack as soon as she\nwas unconscious, row her far out on to the lake, and sink her with a\nweight attached. They dragged her out from the cupboard, always with\nthe threat of that bright aluminium flask before her eyes. She fell\nupon her knees, imploring their pity with the tears running down her\ncheeks; but they sewed the strip of sacking over her face so that she\nshould see nothing of their preparations. They flung her on the sofa,\nsecured her as Hanaud had found her, and, leaving her in the old\nwoman's charge, sent down Adele for her needle and Hippolyte to get\nready the boat. As Hippolyte opened the door he saw the launch of the\nChef de la Surete glide along the bank.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nHANAUD EXPLAINS\n\n\nThis is the story as Mr. Ricardo wrote it out from the statement of\nCelia herself and the confession of Adele Rossignol. Obscurities which\nhad puzzled him were made clear. But he was still unaware how Hanaud\nhad worked out the solution.\n\n\"You promised me that you would explain,\" he said, when they were both\ntogether after the trial was over at Aix. The two men had just finished\nluncheon at the Cercle and were sitting over their coffee. Hanaud\nlighted a cigar.\n\n\"There were difficulties, of course,\" he said; \"the crime was so\ncarefully planned. The little details, such as the footprints, the\nabsence of any mud from the girl's shoes in the carriage of the\nmotor-car, the dinner at Annecy, the purchase of the cord, the want of\nany sign of a struggle in the little salon, were all carefully thought\nout. Had not one little accident happened, and one little mistake been\nmade in consequence, I doubt if we should have laid our hands upon one\nof the gang. We might have suspected Wethermill; we should hardly have\nsecured him, and we should very likely never have known of the Tace\nfamily. That mistake was, as you no doubt are fully aware--\"\n\n\"The failure of Wethermill to discover Mme. Dauvray's jewels,\" said\nRicardo at once.\n\n\"No, my friend,\" answered Hanaud. \"That made them keep Mlle. Celie\nalive. It enabled us to save her when we had discovered the whereabouts\nof the gang. It did not help us very much to lay our hands upon them.\nNo; the little accident which happened was the entrance of our friend\nPerrichet into the garden while the murderers were still in the room.\nImagine that scene, M. Ricardo. The rage of the murderers at their\ninability to discover the plunder for which they had risked their\nnecks, the old woman crumpled up on the floor against the wall, the\ngirl writing laboriously with fettered arms 'I do not know' under\nthreats of torture, and then in the stillness of the night the clear,\ntiny click of the gate and the measured, relentless footsteps. No\nwonder they were terrified in that dark room. What would be their one\nthought? Why, to get away--to come back perhaps later, when Mlle. Celie\nshould have told them what, by the way, she did not know, but in any\ncase to get away now. So they made their little mistake, and in their\nhurry they left the light burning in the room of Helene Vauquier, and\nthe murder was discovered seven hours too soon for them.\"\n\n\"Seven hours!\" said Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"Yes. The household did not rise early. It was not until seven that the\ncharwoman came. It was she who was meant to discover the crime. By that\ntime the motor-car would have been back three hours ago in its garage.\nServettaz, the chauffeur, would have returned from Chambery some time\nin the morning, he would have cleaned the car, he would have noticed\nthat there was very little petrol in the tank, as there had been when\nhe had left it on the day before. He would not have noticed that some\nof his many tins which had been full yesterday were empty to-day. We\nshould not have discovered that about four in the morning the car was\nclose to the Villa Rose and that it had travelled, between midnight and\nfive in the morning, a hundred and fifty kilometres.\"\n\n\"But you had already guessed 'Geneva,'\" said Ricardo. \"At luncheon,\nbefore the news came that the car was found, you had guessed it.\"\n\n\"It was a shot,\" said Hanaud. \"The absence of the car helped me to make\nit. It is a large city and not very far away, a likely place for people\nwith the police at their heels to run to earth in. But if the car had\nbeen discovered in the garage I should not have made that shot. Even\nthen I had no particular conviction about Geneva. I really wished to\nsee how Wethermill would take it. He was wonderful.\"\n\n\"He sprang up.\"\n\n\"He betrayed nothing but surprise. You showed no less surprise than he\ndid, my good friend. What I was looking for was one glance of fear. I\ndid not get it.\"\n\n\"Yet you suspected him--even then you spoke of brains and audacity. You\ntold him enough to hinder him from communicating with the red-haired\nwoman in Geneva. You isolated him. Yes, you suspected him.\"\n\n\"Let us take the case from the beginning. When you first came to me, as\nI told you, the Commissaire had already been with me. There was an\ninteresting piece of evidence already in his possession. Adolphe\nRuel--who saw Wethermill and Vauquier together close by the Casino and\noverheard that cry of Wethermill's, 'It is true: I must have\nmoney!'--had already been with his story to the Commissaire. I knew it\nwhen Harry Wethermill came into the room to ask me to take up the case.\nThat was a bold stroke, my friend. The chances were a hundred to one\nthat I should not interrupt my holiday to take up a case because of\nyour little dinner-party in London. Indeed, I should not have\ninterrupted it had I not known Adolphe Ruel's story. As it was I could\nnot resist. Wethermill's very audacity charmed me. Oh yes, I felt that\nI must pit myself against him. So few criminals have spirit, M.\nRicardo. It is deplorable how few. But Wethermill! See in what a fine\nposition he would have been if only I had refused. He himself had been\nthe first to call upon the first detective in France. And his argument!\nHe loved Mlle. Celie. Therefore she must be innocent! How he stuck to\nit! People would have said, 'Love is blind,' and all the more they\nwould have suspected Mile. Celie. Yes, but they love the blind lover.\nTherefore all the more would it have been impossible for them to\nbelieve Harry Wethermill had any share in that grim crime.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo drew his chair closer in to the table.\n\n\"I will confess to you,\" he said, \"that I thought Mlle. Celie was an\naccomplice.\"\n\n\"It is not surprising,\" said Hanaud. \"Some one within the house was an\naccomplice--we start with that fact. The house had not been broken\ninto. There was Mlle. Celie's record as Helene Vauquier gave it to us,\nand a record obviously true. There was the fact that she had got rid of\nServettaz. There was the maid upstairs very ill from the chloroform.\nWhat more likely than that Mlle. Celie had arranged a seance, and then\nwhen the lights were out had admitted the murderer through that\nconvenient glass door?\"\n\n\"There were, besides, the definite imprints of her shoes,\" said Mr.\nRicardo.\n\n\"Yes, but that is precisely where I began to feel sure that she was\ninnocent,\" replied Hanaud dryly. \"All the other footmarks had been so\ncarefully scored and ploughed up that nothing could be made of them.\nYet those little ones remained so definite, so easily identified, and I\nbegan to wonder why these, too, had not been cut up and stamped over.\nThe murderers had taken, you see, an excess of precaution to throw the\npresumption of guilt upon Mlle. Celie rather than upon Vauquier.\nHowever, there the footsteps were. Mlle. Celie had sprung from the room\nas I described to Wethermill. But I was puzzled. Then in the room I\nfound the torn-up sheet of notepaper with the words, 'Je ne sais pas,'\nin mademoiselle's handwriting. The words might have been\nspirit-writing, they might have meant anything. I put them away in my\nmind. But in the room the settee puzzled me. And again I was\ntroubled--greatly troubled.\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw that.\"\n\n\"And not you alone,\" said Hanaud, with a smile. \"Do you remember that\nloud cry Wethermill gave when we returned to the room and once more I\nstood before the settee? Oh, he turned it off very well. I had said\nthat our criminals in France were not very gentle with their victims,\nand he pretended that it was in fear of what Mlle. Celie might be\nsuffering which had torn that cry from his heart. But it was not so. He\nwas afraid--deadly afraid--not for Mlle. Celie, but for himself. He was\nafraid that I had understood what these cushions had to tell me.\"\n\n\"What did they tell you?\" asked Ricardo.\n\n\"You know now,\" said Hanaud. \"They were two cushions, both indented,\nand indented in different ways. The one at the head was irregularly\nindented--something shaped had pressed upon it. It might have been a\nface--it might not; and there was a little brown stain which was fresh\nand which was blood. The second cushion had two separate impressions,\nand between them the cushion was forced up in a thin ridge; and these\nimpressions were more definite. I measured the distance between the two\ncushions, and I found this: that supposing--and it was a large\nsupposition--the cushions had not been moved since those impressions\nwere made, a girl of Mlle. Celie's height lying stretched out upon the\nsofa would have her face pressing down upon one cushion and her feet\nand insteps upon the other. Now, the impressions upon the second\ncushion and the thin ridge between them were just the impressions which\nmight have been made by a pair of shoes held close together. But that\nwould not be a natural attitude for any one, and the mark upon the head\ncushion was very deep. Supposing that my conjectures were true, then a\nwoman would only lie like that because she was helpless, because she\nhad been flung there, because she could not lift herself--because, in a\nword, her hands were tied behind her back and her feet fastened\ntogether. Well, then, follow this train of reasoning, my friend!\nSuppose my conjectures--and we had nothing but conjectures to build\nupon--were true, the woman flung upon the sofa could not be Helene\nVauquier, for she would have said so; she could have had no reason for\nconcealment. But it must be Mlle. Celie. There was the slit in the one\ncushion and the stain on the other which, of course, I had not\naccounted for. There was still, too, the puzzle of the footsteps\noutside the glass doors. If Mlle. Celie had been bound upon the sofa,\nhow came she to run with her limbs free from the house? There was a\nquestion--a question not easy to answer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Ricardo.\n\n\"Yes; but there was also another question. Suppose that Mlle. Celie\nwas, after all, the victim, not the accomplice; suppose she had been\nflung tied upon the sofa; suppose that somehow the imprint of her shoes\nupon the ground had been made, and that she had afterwards been carried\naway, so that the maid might be cleared of all complicity--in that case\nit became intelligible why the other footprints were scored out and\nhers left. The presumption of guilt would fall upon her. There would be\nproof that she ran hurriedly from the room and sprang into a motor-car\nof her own free will. But, again, if that theory were true, then Helene\nVauquier was the accomplice and not Mlle. Celie.\"\n\n\"I follow that.\"\n\n\"Then I found an interesting piece of evidence with regard to the\nstrange woman who came: I picked up a long red hair--a very important\npiece of evidence about which I thought it best to say nothing at all.\nIt was not Mlle. Celie's hair, which is fair; nor Vauquier's, which is\nblack; nor Mme. Dauvray's, which is dyed brown; nor the charwoman's,\nwhich is grey. It was, therefore, the visitor's. Well, we went upstairs\nto Mile. Celie's room.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Ricardo eagerly. \"We are coming to the pot of cream.\"\n\n\"In that room we learnt that Helene Vauquier, at her own request, had\nalready paid it a visit. It is true the Commissaire said that he had\nkept his eye on her the whole time. But none the less from the window\nhe saw me coming down the road, and that he could not have done, as I\nmade sure, unless he had turned his back upon Vauquier and leaned out\nof the window. Now at the time I had an open mind about Vauquier. On\nthe whole I was inclined to think she had no share in the affair. But\neither she or Mlle. Celie had, and perhaps both. But one of them--yes.\nThat was sure. Therefore I asked what drawers she touched after the\nCommissaire had leaned out of the window. For if she had any motive in\nwishing to visit the room she would have satisfied it when the\nCommissaire's back was turned. He pointed to a drawer, and I took out a\ndress and shook it, thinking that she may have wished to hide\nsomething. But nothing fell out. On the other hand, however, I saw some\nquite fresh grease-marks, made by fingers, and the marks were wet. I\nbegan to ask myself how it was that Helene Vauquier, who had just been\nhelped to dress by the nurse, had grease upon her fingers. Then I\nlooked at a drawer which she had examined first of all. There were no\ngrease-marks on the clothes she had turned over before the Commissaire\nleaned out of the window. Therefore it followed that during the few\nseconds when he was watching me she had touched grease. I looked about\nthe room, and there on the dressing-table close by the chest of drawers\nwas a pot of cold cream. That was the grease Helene Vauquier had\ntouched. And why--if not to hide some small thing in it which, firstly,\nshe dared not keep in her own room; which, secondly, she wished to hide\nin the room of Mlle. Celie; and which, thirdly, she had not had an\nopportunity to hide before? Now bear those three conditions in mind,\nand tell me what the small thing was.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo nodded his head.\n\n\"I know now,\" he said. \"You told me. The earrings of Mlle. Celie. But I\nshould not have guessed it at the time.\"\n\n\"Nor could I--at the time,\" said Hanaud. \"I kept my open mind about\nHelene Vauquier; but I locked the door and took the key. Then we went\nand heard Vauquier's story. The story was clever, because so much of it\nwas obviously, indisputably true. The account of the seances, of Mme.\nDauvray's superstitions, her desire for an interview with Mme. de\nMontespan--such details are not invented. It was interesting, too, to\nknow that there had been a seance planned for that night! The method of\nthe murder began to be clear. So far she spoke the truth. But then she\nlied. Yes, she lied, and it was a bad lie, my friend. She told us that\nthe strange woman Adele had black hair. Now I carried in my pocket-book\nproof that that woman's hair was red. Why did she lie, except to make\nimpossible the identification of that strange visitor? That was the\nfirst false step taken by Helene Vauquier.\n\n\"Now let us take the second. I thought nothing of her rancour against\nMlle. Celie. To me it was all very natural. She--the hard peasant woman\nno longer young, who had been for years the confidential servant of\nMme. Dauvray, and no doubt had taken her levy from the impostors who\npreyed upon her credulous mistress--certainly she would hate this young\nand pretty outcast whom she has to wait upon, whose hair she has to\ndress. Vauquier--she would hate her. But if by any chance she were in\nthe plot--and the lie seemed to show she was--then the seances showed\nme new possibilities. For Helene used to help Mlle. Celie. Suppose that\nthe seance had taken place, that this sceptical visitor with the red\nhair professed herself dissatisfied with Vauquier's method of testing\nthe medium, had suggested another way, Mlle. Celie could not object,\nand there she would be neatly and securely packed up beyond the power\nof offering any resistance, before she could have a suspicion that\nthings were wrong. It would be an easy little comedy to play. And if\nthat were true--why, there were my sofa cushions partly explained.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see!\" cried Ricardo, with enthusiasm. \"You are wonderful.\"\n\nHanaud was not displeased with his companion's enthusiasm.\n\n\"But wait a moment. We have only conjectures so far, and one fact that\nHelene Vauquier lied about the colour of the strange woman's hair. Now\nwe get another fact. Mlle. Celie was wearing buckles on her shoes. And\nthere is my slit in the sofa cushions. For when she is flung on to the\nsofa, what will she do? She will kick, she will struggle. Of course it\nis conjecture. I do not as yet hold pigheadedly to it. I am not yet\nsure that Mlle. Celie is innocent. I am willing at any moment to admit\nthat the facts contradict my theory. But, on the contrary, each fact\nthat I discover helps it to take shape.\n\n\"Now I come to Helene Vauquier's second mistake. On the evening when\nyou saw Mlle. Celie in the garden behind the baccarat-rooms you noticed\nthat she wore no jewellery except a pair of diamond eardrops. In the\nphotograph of her which Wethermill showed me, again she was wearing\nthem. Is it not, therefore, probable that she usually wore them? When I\nexamined her room I found the case for those earrings--the case was\nempty. It was natural, then, to infer that she was wearing them when\nshe came down to the seance.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I read a description--a carefully written description--of the\nmissing girl, made by Helene Vauquier after an examination of the\ngirl's wardrobe. There is no mention of the earrings. So I asked\nher--'Was she not wearing them?' Helene Vauquier was taken by surprise.\nHow should I know anything of Mlle. Celie's earrings? She hesitated.\nShe did not quite know what answer to make. Now, why? Since she herself\ndressed Mile. Celie, and remembers so very well all she wore, why does\nshe hesitate? Well, there is a reason. She does not know how much I\nknow about those diamond eardrops. She is not sure whether we have not\ndipped into that pot of cold cream and found them. Yet without knowing\nshe cannot answer. So now we come back to our pot of cold cream.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" cried Mr. Ricardo. \"They were there.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Hanaud. \"Let us see how it works out. Remember the\nconditions. Vauquier has some small thing which she must hide, and\nwhich she wishes to hide in Mlle. Celie's room. For she admitted that\nit was her suggestion that she should look through mademoiselle's\nwardrobe. For what reason does she choose the girl's room, except that\nif the thing were discovered that would be the natural place for it? It\nis, then, something belonging to Mlle. Celie. There was a second\ncondition we laid down. It was something Vauquier had not been able to\nhide before. It came, then, into her possession last night. Why could\nshe not hide it last night? Because she was not alone. There were the\nman and the woman, her accomplices. It was something, then, which she\nwas concerned in hiding from them. It is not rash to guess, then, that\nit was some piece of the plunder of which the other two would have\nclaimed their share--and a piece of plunder belonging to Mlle. Celie.\nWell, she has nothing but the diamond eardrops. Suppose Vauquier is\nleft alone to guard Mlle. Celie while the other two ransack Mme.\nDauvray's room. She sees her chance. The girl cannot stir hand or foot\nto save herself. Vauquier tears the eardrops in a hurry from her\nears--and there I have my drop of blood just where I should expect it\nto be. But now follow this! Vauquier hides the earrings in her pocket.\nShe goes to bed in order to be chloroformed. She knows that it is very\npossible that her room will be searched before she regains\nconsciousness, or before she is well enough to move. There is only one\nplace to hide them in, only one place where they will be safe. In bed\nwith her. But in the morning she must get rid of them, and a nurse is\nwith her. Hence the excuse to go to Mlle. Celie's room. If the eardrops\nare found in the pot of cold cream, it would only be thought that Mlle.\nCelie had herself hidden them there for safety. Again it is conjecture,\nand I wish to make sure. So I tell Vauquier she can go away, and I\nleave her unwatched. I have her driven to the depot instead of to her\nfriends, and searched. Upon her is found the pot of cream, and in the\ncream Mlle. Celie's eardrops. She has slipped into Mlle. Celie's room,\nas, if my theory was correct, she would be sure to do, and put the pot\nof cream into her pocket. So I am now fairly sure that she is concerned\nin the murder.\n\n\"We then went to Mme. Dauvray's room and discovered her brilliants and\nher ornaments. At once the meaning of that agitated piece of\nhand-writing of Mlle. Celie's becomes clear. She is asked where the\njewels are hidden. She cannot answer, for her mouth, of course, is\nstopped. She has to write. Thus my conjectures get more and more\nsupport. And, mind this, one of the two women is guilty--Celie or\nVauquier. My discoveries all fit in with the theory of Celie's\ninnocence. But there remain the footprints, for which I found no\nexplanation.\n\n\"You will remember I made you all promise silence as to the finding of\nMme. Dauvray's jewellery. For I thought, if they have taken the girl\naway so that suspicion may fall on her and not on Vauquier, they mean\nto dispose of her. But they may keep her so long as they have a chance\nof finding out from her Mme. Dauvray's hiding-place. It was a small\nchance but our only one. The moment the discovery of the jewellery was\npublished the girl's fate was sealed, were my theory true.\n\n\"Then came our advertisement and Mme. Gobin's written testimony. There\nwas one small point of interest which I will take first: her statement\nthat Adele was the Christian name of the woman with the red hair, that\nthe old woman who was the servant in that house in the suburb of Geneva\ncalled her Adele, just simply Adele. That interested me, for Helene\nVauquier had called her Adele too when she was describing to us the\nunknown visitor. 'Adele' was what Mme. Dauvray called her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ricardo. \"Helene Vauquier made a slip there. She should\nhave given her a false name.\"\n\nHanaud nodded.\n\n\"It is the one slip she made in the whole of the business. Nor did she\nrecover herself very cleverly. For when the Commissaire pounced upon\nthe name, she at once modified her words. She only thought now that the\nname was Adele, or something like it. But when I went on to suggest\nthat the name in any case would be a false one, at once she went back\nupon her modifications. And now she was sure that Adele was the name\nused. I remembered her hesitation when I read Marthe Gobin's letter.\nThey helped to confirm me in my theory that she was in the plot; and\nthey made me very sure that it was an Adele for whom we had to look. So\nfar well. But other statements in the letter puzzled me. For instance,\n'She ran lightly and quickly across the pavement into the house, as\nthough she were afraid to be seen.' Those were the words, and the woman\nwas obviously honest. What became of my theory then? The girl was free\nto run, free to stoop and pick up the train of her gown in her hand,\nfree to shout for help in the open street if she wanted help. No; that\nI could not explain until that afternoon, when I saw Mlle. Celie's\nterror-stricken eyes fixed upon that flask, as Lemerre poured a little\nout and burnt a hole in the sack. Then I understood well enough. The\nfear of vitriol!\" Hanaud gave an uneasy shudder. \"And it is enough to\nmake any one afraid! That I can tell you. No wonder she lay still as a\nmouse upon the sofa in the bedroom. No wonder she ran quickly into the\nhouse. Well, there you have the explanation. I had only my theory to\nwork upon even after Mme. Gobin's evidence. But as it happened it was\nthe right one. Meanwhile, of course, I made my inquiries into\nWethermill's circumstances. My good friends in England helped me. They\nwere precarious. He owed money in Aix, money at his hotel. We knew from\nthe motor-car that the man we were searching for had returned to Aix.\nThings began to look black for Wethermill. Then you gave me a little\npiece of information.\"\n\n\"I!\" exclaimed Ricardo, with a start.\n\n\"Yes. You told me that you walked up to the hotel with Harry Wethermill\non the night of the murder and separated just before ten. A glance into\nhis rooms which I had--you will remember that when we had discovered\nthe motor-car I suggested that we should go to Harry Wethermill's rooms\nand talk it over--that glance enabled me to see that he could very\neasily have got out of his room on to the verandah below and escaped\nfrom the hotel by the garden quite unseen. For you will remember that\nwhereas your rooms look out to the front and on to the slope of Mont\nRevard, Wethermill's look out over the garden and the town of Aix. In a\nquarter of an hour or twenty minutes he could have reached the Villa\nRose. He could have been in the salon before half-past ten, and that is\njust the hour which suited me perfectly. And, as he got out unnoticed,\nso he could return. So he did return! My friend, there are some\ninteresting marks upon the window-sill of Wethermill's room and upon\nthe pillar just beneath it. Take a look, M. Ricardo, when you return to\nyour hotel. But that was not all. We talked of Geneva in Mr.\nWethermill's room, and of the distance between Geneva and Aix. Do you\nremember that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ricardo.\n\n\"Do you remember too that I asked him for a road-book?\"\n\n\"Yes; to make sure of the distance. I do.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it was not to make sure of the distance that I asked for the\nroad-book, my friend. I asked in order to find out whether Harry\nWethermill had a road-book at all which gave a plan of the roads\nbetween here and Geneva. And he had. He handed it to me at once and\nquite naturally. I hope that I took it calmly, but I was not at all\ncalm inside. For it was a new road-book, which, by the way, he bought a\nweek before, and I was asking myself all the while--now what was I\nasking myself, M. Ricardo?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ricardo, with a smile. \"I am growing wary. I will not tell\nyou what you were asking yourself, M. Hanaud. For even were I right you\nwould make out that I was wrong, and leap upon me with injuries and\ngibes. No, you shall drink your coffee and tell me of your own accord.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Hanaud, laughing, \"I will tell you. I was asking myself:\n'Why does a man who owns no motor-car, who hires no motor-car, go out\ninto Aix and buy an automobilist's road-map? With what object?' And I\nfound it an interesting question. M. Harry Wethermill was not the man\nto go upon a walking tour, eh? Oh, I was obtaining evidence. But then\ncame an overwhelming thing--the murder of Marthe Gobin. We know now how\nhe did it. He walked beside the cab, put his head in at the window,\nasked, 'Have you come in answer to the advertisement?' and stabbed her\nstraight to the heart through her dress. The dress and the weapon which\nhe used would save him from being stained with her blood. He was in\nyour room that morning, when we were at the station. As I told you, he\nleft his glove behind. He was searching for a telegram in answer to\nyour advertisement. Or he came to sound you. He had already received\nhis telegram from Hippolyte. He was like a fox in a cage, snapping at\nevery one, twisting vainly this way and that way, risking everything\nand every one to save his precious neck. Marthe Gobin was in the way.\nShe is killed. Mlle. Celie is a danger. So Mile. Celie must be\nsuppressed. And off goes a telegram to the Geneva paper, handed in by a\nwaiter from the cafe at the station of Chambery before five o'clock.\nWethermill went to Chambery that afternoon when we went to Geneva. Once\nwe could get him on the run, once we could so harry and bustle him that\nhe must take risks--why, we had him. And that afternoon he had to take\nthem.\"\n\n\"So that even before Marthe Gobin was killed you were sure that\nWethermill was the murderer?\"\n\nHanaud's face clouded over.\n\n\"You put your finger on a sore place, M. Ricardo. I was sure, but I\nstill wanted evidence to convict. I left him free, hoping for that\nevidence. I left him free, hoping that he would commit himself. He did,\nbut--well, let us talk of some one else. What of Mlle. Celie?\"\n\nRicardo drew a letter from his pocket.\n\n\"I have a sister in London, a widow,\" he said. \"She is kind. I, too,\nhave been thinking of what will become of Mlle. Celie. I wrote to my\nsister, and here is her reply. Mlle. Celie will be very welcome.\"\n\nHanaud stretched out his hand and shook Ricardo's warmly.\n\n\"She will not, I think, be for very long a burden. She is young. She\nwill recover from this shock. She is very pretty, very gentle. If--if\nno one comes forward whom she loves and who loves her--I--yes, I\nmyself, who was her papa for one night, will be her husband forever.\"\n\nHe laughed inordinately at his own joke; it was a habit of M. Hanaud's.\nThen he said gravely:\n\n\"But I am glad, M. Ricardo, for Mlle. Celie's sake that I came to your\namusing dinner-party in London.\"\n\nMr. Ricardo was silent for a moment. Then he asked:\n\n\"And what will happen to the condemned?\"\n\n\"To the women? Imprisonment for life.\"\n\n\"And to the man?\"\n\nHanaud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Perhaps the guillotine. Perhaps New Caledonia. How can I say? I am not\nthe President of the Republic.\"\n\n\n\n\nEND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of At the Villa Rose, by A. E. W.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1013,"split":"train"}
