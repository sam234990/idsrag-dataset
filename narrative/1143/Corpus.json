{"ori_id":"194fd3c13f34b5a640280e7f43e59dbed66c215c","title":"Thor (film)","context":"Thor (film)\n In 965 AD, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey, to prevent them from conquering the nine realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.\nIn the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\nThor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.\nLoki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifr\u00f6st\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\nIn a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n<html>\n<head><title>Thor Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Thor script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Thor script, Thor movie script, Thor film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

billion stars.\n          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING\n          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling\n          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.\n\n<b>          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1\n<\/b>\n          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set\n          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves\n          down the street and heads out of town.\n\n<b>          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2\n<\/b>\n          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels\n          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a\n          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point\n          at the sky.\n          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She\n          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the\n          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from\n          spare parts of other devices.\n\n<b>                         JANE\n<\/b>          Hurry!\n          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.\n          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as\n          well, rubbing his head.\n\n<b>          JANE (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Oh-- watch your head.\n\n<b>                         SELVIG\n<\/b>          Thanks.

Jane passes it to\n          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large\n          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the\n          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.\n\n<b>          JANE (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Not until you see it!\n\n<b>                         SELVIG\n<\/b>          (re: the gloves)\n          I recognize those.

A long beat while\n          they scan the skies. Nothing.

It's a\n          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in\n          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.\n          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.\n\n<b>                         THOR\n<\/b>          Come on!
