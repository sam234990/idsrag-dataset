The flurry of activity to cover up their considerable misdeeds is interrupted by the report that a suspicious person has arrived two weeks previously from Saint Petersburg and is staying at the inn. That person, however, is not an inspector; it is Khlestakov, a foppish civil servant with a wild imagination.\nHaving learned that Khlestakov has been charging his considerable hotel bill to the Crown, the Mayor and his crooked cronies are immediately certain that this upper class twit is the dreaded inspector. For quite some time, however, Khlestakov does not even realize that he has been mistaken for someone else. Meanwhile, he enjoys the officials' terrified deference and moves in as a guest in the Mayor's house. He also demands and receives massive \"loans\" from the Mayor and all of his associates. He also flirts outrageously with the Mayor's wife and daughter.\nSick and tired of the Mayor's ludicrous demands for bribes, the village's Jewish and Old Believer merchants arrive, begging Khlestakov to have him dismissed from his post. Stunned at the Mayor's rapacious corruption, Khlestakov states that he deserves to be exiled in chains to Siberia. Then, however, he pockets still more \"loans\" from the merchants, promising to comply with their request.\nTerrified that he is now undone, the Mayor pleads with Khlestakov not to have him arrested, only to learn that the latter has become engaged to his daughter. At which point Khlestakov announces that he is returning to St. Petersburg, having been persuaded by his valet Osip that it is too dangerous to continue the charade any longer.\nAfter Khlestakov and Osip depart on a coach driven by the village's fastest horses, the Mayor's friends all arrive to congratulate him. Certain that he now has the upper hand, he summons the merchants, boasting of his daughter's engagement and vowing to squeeze them for every kopeck they are worth. However, the Postmaster suddenly arrives carrying an intercepted letter which reveals Khlestakov's true identity\u00e2\u0080\u0094and his mocking opinion of them all.\nThe Mayor, after years of bamboozling banter Governors and shaking down criminals of every description, is enraged to have been thus humiliated. He screams at his cronies, stating that they, not himself, are to blame. While they continue arguing, a message arrives from the real Government Inspector, who is demanding to see the Mayor immediately.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Inspector-General, by Nicolay Gogol\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

To place a purely\nliterary valuation upon it and call it the greatest of Russian comedies\nwould not convey the significance of its position either in Russian\nliterature or in Russian life itself. There is no other single work in\nthe modern literature of any language that carries with it the wealth of\nassociations which the Inspector-General does to the educated Russian.\nThe Germans have their Faust; but Faust is a tragedy with a cosmic\nphilosophic theme. In England it takes nearly all that is implied in the\ncomprehensive name of Shakespeare to give the same sense of bigness that\na Russian gets from the mention of the Revizor.\n\nThat is not to say that the Russian is so defective in the critical\nfaculty as to balance the combined creative output of the greatest\nEnglish dramatist against Gogol's one comedy, or even to attribute to\nit the literary value of any of Shakespeare's better plays. What the\nRussian's appreciation indicates is the pregnant role that literature\nplays in the life of intellectual Russia. Here literature is not a\nluxury, not a diversion. It is bone of the bone, flesh of the flesh, not\nonly of the intelligentsia, but also of a growing number of the common\npeople, intimately woven into their everyday existence, part and parcel\nof their thoughts, their aspirations, their social, political and\neconomic life. It expresses their collective wrongs and sorrows, their\ncollective hopes and strivings. Not only does it serve to lead the\nmovements of the masses, but it is an integral component element of\nthose movements. In a word, Russian literature is completely bound up\nwith the life of Russian society, and its vitality is but the measure of\nthe spiritual vitality of that society.\n\nThis unique character of Russian literature may be said to have had its\nbeginning with the Inspector-General. Before Gogol most Russian writers,\nwith few exceptions, were but weak imitators of foreign models.\nThe drama fashioned itself chiefly upon French patterns. The\nInspector-General and later Gogol's novel, Dead Souls, established that\ntradition in Russian letters which was followed by all the great writers\nfrom Dostoyevsky down to Gorky.\n\nAs with one blow, Gogol shattered the notions of the theatre-going\npublic of his day of what a comedy should be. The ordinary idea of a\nplay at that time in Russia seems to have been a little like our\nown tired business man's. And the shock the Revizor gave those early\nnineteenth-century Russian audiences is not unlike the shocks we\nourselves get when once in a while a theatrical manager is courageous\nenough to produce a bold modern European play. Only the intensity of\nthe shock was much greater. For Gogol dared not only bid defiance to the\naccepted method; he dared to introduce a subject-matter that under the\nguise of humor audaciously attacked the very foundation of the state,\nnamely, the officialdom of the Russian bureaucracy. That is why the\nRevizor marks such a revolution in the world of Russian letters. In form\nit was realistic, in substance it was vital. It showed up the rottenness\nand corruption of the instruments through which the Russian government\nfunctioned. It held up to ridicule, directly, all the officials of\na typical Russian municipality, and, indirectly, pointed to the same\nsystem of graft and corruption among the very highest servants of the\ncrown.\n\nWhat wonder that the Inspector-General became a sort of comedy-epic in\nthe land of the Czars, the land where each petty town-governor is almost\nan absolute despot, regulating his persecutions and extortions according\nto the sage saying of the town-governor in the play, \"That's the way God\nmade the world, and the Voltairean free-thinkers can talk against it\nall they like, it won't do any good.\" Every subordinate in the town\nadministration, all the way down the line to the policemen, follow--not\nalways so scrupulously--the law laid down by the same authority, \"Graft\nno higher than your rank.\" As in city and town, so in village and\nhamlet. It is the tragedy of Russian life, which has its roots in that\nmore comprehensive tragedy, Russian despotism, the despotism that gives\nthe sharp edge to official corruption. For there is no possible redress\nfrom it except in violent revolutions.\n\nThat is the prime reason why the Inspector-General, a mere comedy, has\nsuch a hold on the Russian people and occupies so important a place\nin Russian literature. And that is why a Russian critic says, \"Russia\npossesses only one comedy, the Inspector-General.\"\n\nThe second reason is the brilliancy and originality with which this\nnational theme was executed. Gogol was above all else the artist. He was\nnot a radical, nor even a liberal. He was strictly conservative. While\nhating the bureaucracy, yet he never found fault with the system\nitself or with the autocracy. Like most born artists, he was strongly\nindividualistic in temperament, and his satire and ridicule were aimed\nnot at causes, but at effects. Let but the individuals act morally, and\nthe system, which Gogol never questioned, would work beautifully. This\nconception caused Gogol to concentrate his best efforts upon delineation\nof character. It was the characters that were to be revealed, their\nactions to be held up to scorn and ridicule, not the conditions which\ncreated the characters and made them act as they did. If any lesson at\nall was to be drawn from the play it was not a sociological lesson, but\na moral one. The individual who sees himself mirrored in it may be moved\nto self-purgation; society has nothing to learn from it.\n\nYet the play lives because of the social message it carries. The\ncreation proved greater than the creator. The author of the Revizor was\na poor critic of his own work. The Russian people rejected his\nestimate and put their own upon it. They knew their officials and they\nentertained no illusions concerning their regeneration so long as the\nsystem that bred them continued to live. Nevertheless, as a keen satire\nand a striking exposition of the workings of the hated system itself,\nthey hailed the Revizor with delight. And as such it has remained graven\nin Russia's conscience to this day.\n\nIt must be said that \"Gogol himself grew with the writing of the\nRevizor.\" Always a careful craftsman, scarcely ever satisfied with the\nfirst version of a story or a play, continually changing and rewriting,\nhe seems to have bestowed special attention on perfecting this comedy.\nThe subject, like that of Dead Souls, was suggested to him by the poet\nPushkin, and was based on a true incident. Pushkin at once recognized\nGogol's genius and looked upon the young author as the rising star\nof Russian literature. Their acquaintance soon ripened into intimate\nfriendship, and Pushkin missed no opportunity to encourage and stimulate\nhim in his writings and help him with all the power of his great\ninfluence. Gogol began to work on the play at the close of 1834, when he\nwas twenty-five years old. It was first produced in St. Petersburg,\nin 1836. Despite the many elaborations it had undergone before Gogol\npermitted it to be put on the stage, he still did not feel satisfied,\nand he began to work on it again in 1838. It was not brought down to its\npresent final form until 1842.\n\nThus the Revizor occupied the mind of the author over a period of\neight years, and resulted in a product which from the point of view of\ncharacterization and dramatic technique is almost flawless. Yet far\nmore important is the fact that the play marked an epoch in Gogol's own\nliterary development. When he began on it, his ambitions did not rise\nabove making it a comedy of pure fun, but, gradually, in the course of\nhis working on it, the possibilities of the subject unfolded themselves\nand influenced his entire subsequent career. His art broadened and\ndeepened and grew more serious. If Pushkin's remark, that \"behind his\nlaughter you feel the sad tears,\" is true of some of Gogol's former\nproductions, it is still truer of the Revizor and his later works.\n\nA new life had begun for him, he tells us himself, when he was no longer\n\"moved by childish notions, but by lofty ideas full of truth.\" \"It was\nPushkin,\" he writes, \"who made me look at the thing seriously. I saw\nthat in my writings I laughed vainly, for nothing, myself not knowing\nwhy. If I was to laugh, then I had better laugh over things that are\nreally to be laughed at. In the Inspector-General I resolved to gather\ntogether all the bad in Russia I then knew into one heap, all the\ninjustice that was practised in those places and in those human\nrelations in which more than in anything justice is demanded of men, and\nto have one big laugh over it all. But that, as is well known, produced\nan outburst of excitement. Through my laughter, which never before came\nto me with such force, the reader sensed profound sorrow. I myself\nfelt that my laughter was no longer the same as it had been, that in my\nwritings I could no longer be the same as in the past, and that the need\nto divert myself with innocent, careless scenes had ended along with my\nyoung years.\"\n\nWith the strict censorship that existed in the reign of Czar Nicholas I,\nit required powerful influence to obtain permission for the production\nof the comedy. This Gogol received through the instrumentality of\nhis friend, Zhukovsky, who succeeded in gaining the Czar's personal\nintercession. Nicholas himself was present at the first production in\nApril, 1836, and laughed and applauded, and is said to have remarked,\n\"Everybody gets it, and I most of all.\"\n\nNaturally official Russia did not relish this innovation in dramatic\nart, and indignation ran high among them and their supporters. Bulgarin\nled the attack. Everything that is usually said against a new departure\nin literature or art was said against the Revizor. It was not original.\nIt was improbable, impossible, coarse, vulgar; lacked plot. It turned\non a stale anecdote that everybody knew. It was a rank farce. The\ncharacters were mere caricatures. \"What sort of a town was it that did\nnot hold a single honest soul?\"\n\nGogol's sensitive nature shrank before the tempest that burst upon him,\nand he fled from his enemies all the way out of Russia. \"Do what you\nplease about presenting the play in Moscow,\" he writes to Shchepkin four\ndays after its first production in St. Petersburg. \"I am not going to\nbother about it. I am sick of the play and all the fussing over it. It\nproduced a great noisy effect. All are against me... they abuse me and\ngo to see it. No tickets can be obtained for the fourth performance.\"\n\nBut the best literary talent of Russia, with Pushkin and Bielinsky, the\ngreatest critic Russia has produced, at the head, ranged itself on his\nside.\n\nNicolay Vasilyevich Gogol was born in Sorochintzy, government of\nPoltava, in 1809. His father was a Little Russian, or Ukrainian,\nlandowner, who exhibited considerable talent as a playwright and actor.\nGogol was educated at home until the age of ten, then went to Niezhin,\nwhere he entered the gymnasium in 1821. Here he edited a students'\nmanuscript magazine called the Star, and later founded a students'\ntheatre, for which he was both manager and actor. It achieved such\nsuccess that it was patronized by the general public.\n\nIn 1829 Gogol went to St. Petersburg, where he thought of becoming\nan actor, but he finally gave up the idea and took a position as a\nsubordinate government clerk. His real literary career began in 1830\nwith the publication of a series of stories of Little Russian country\nlife called Nights on a Farm near Dikanka. In 1831 he became acquainted\nwith Pushkin and Zhukovsky, who introduced the \"shy Khokhol\" (nickname\nfor \"Little Russian\"), as he was called, to the house of Madame O.\nA. Smirnov, the centre of \"an intimate circle of literary men and the\nflower of intellectual society.\" The same year he obtained a position as\ninstructor of history at the Patriotic Institute, and in 1834 was made\nprofessor of history at the University of St. Petersburg. Though his\nlectures were marked by originality and vivid presentation, he seems on\nthe whole not to have been successful as a professor, and he resigned in\n1835.\n\nDuring this period he kept up his literary activity uninterruptedly, and\nin 1835 published his collection of stories, Mirgorod, containing\nHow Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich, Taras Bulba, and\nothers. This collection firmly established his position as a leading\nauthor. At the same time he was at work on several plays. The Vladimir\nCross, which was to deal with the higher St. Petersburg functionaries\nin the same way as the Revizor with the lesser town officials, was never\nconcluded, as Gogol realized the impossibility of placing them on the\nRussian stage. A few strong scenes were published. The comedy Marriage,\nfinished in 1835, still finds a place in the Russian theatrical\nrepertoire. The Gamblers, his only other complete comedy, belongs to a\nlater period.\n\nAfter a stay abroad, chiefly in Italy, lasting with some interruptions\nfor seven years (1836-1841), he returned to his native country, bringing\nwith him the first part of his greatest work, Dead Souls. The novel,\npublished the following year, produced a profound impression and made\nGogol's literary reputation supreme. Pushkin, who did not live to see\nits publication, on hearing the first chapters read, exclaimed, \"God,\nhow sad our Russia is!\" And Alexander Hertzen characterized it as\n\"a wonderful book, a bitter, but not hopeless rebuke of contemporary\nRussia.\" Aksakov went so far as to call it the Russian national epic,\nand Gogol the Russian Homer.\n\nUnfortunately the novel remained incomplete. Gogol began to suffer\nfrom a nervous illness which induced extreme hypochondria. He became\nexcessively religious, fell under the influence of pietists and a\nfanatical priest, sank more and more into mysticism, and went on a\npilgrimage to Jerusalem to worship at the Holy Sepulchre. In this\nstate of mind he came to consider all literature, including his own, as\npernicious and sinful.\n\nAfter burning the manuscript of the second part of Dead Souls, he began\nto rewrite it, had it completed and ready for the press by 1851, but\nkept the copy and burned it again a few days before his death (1852), so\nthat it is extant only in parts.\n\nTHOMAS SELTZER.\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\n\n\n     ANTON ANTONOVICH SKVOZNIK-DMUKHANOVSKY, the\n     Governor.\n     ANNA ANDREYEVNA, his wife.\n     MARYA ANTONOVNA, his daughter.\n     LUKA LUKICH KHLOPOV, the Inspector of Schools.\n     His Wife.\n     AMMOS FIODOROVICH LIAPKIN-TIAPKIN, the Judge.\n     ARTEMY FILIPPOVICH ZEMLIANIKA, the Superintendent of\n     Charities.\n     IVAN KUZMICH SHPEKIN, the Postmaster.\n     PIOTR IVANOVICH DOBCHINSKY. }\n     PIOTR IVANOVICH BOBCHINSKY. } Country Squires.\n     IVAN ALEKSANDROVICH KHLESTAKOV, an official from St.\n     Petersburg.\n     OSIP, his servant.\n     CHRISTIAN IVANOVICH H\u00c3\u009cBNER, the district Doctor.\n\n     FIODR ANDREYEVICH LULIUKOV. } ex-officials,\n                                  }esteemed\n     IVAN LAZAREVICH RASTAKOVSKY. }personages\n     STEPAN IVANOVICH KOROBKIN. }of the town.\n     STEPAN ILYICH UKHOVERTOV, the Police Captain.\n     SVISTUNOV.   }\n     PUGOVITZYN.  }Police Sergeants.\n     DERZHIMORDA. }\n     ABDULIN, a Merchant.\n     FEVRONYA PETROVA POSHLIOPKINA, the Locksmith's wife.\n     The Widow of a non-commissioned Officer.\n     MISHKA, the Governor's Servant.\n     Servant at the Inn.\n     Guests, Merchants, Citizens, and Petitioners.\n\n\nCHARACTERS AND COSTUMES\n\n\n\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR ACTORS\n\n\nTHE GOVERNOR.--A man grown old in the service, by no means a fool in his\nown way. Though he takes bribes, he carries himself with dignity. He is\nof a rather serious turn and even given somewhat to ratiocination. He\nspeaks in a voice neither too loud nor too low and says neither too much\nnor too little. Every word of his counts. He has the typical hard stern\nfeatures of the official who has worked his way up from the lowest rank\nin the arduous government service. Coarse in his inclinations, he passes\nrapidly from fear to joy, from servility to arrogance. He is dressed in\nuniform with frogs and wears Hessian boots with spurs. His hair with a\nsprinkling of gray is close-cropped.\n\nANNA ANDREYEVNA.--A provincial coquette, still this side of middle age,\neducated on novels and albums and on fussing with household affairs and\nservants. She is highly inquisitive and has streaks of vanity. Sometimes\nshe gets the upper hand over her husband, and he gives in simply because\nat the moment he cannot find the right thing to say. Her ascendency,\nhowever, is confined to mere trifles and takes the form of lecturing and\ntwitting. She changes her dress four times in the course of the play.\n\nKHLESTAKOV.--A skinny young man of about twenty-three, rather stupid,\nbeing, as they say, \"without a czar in his head,\" one of those persons\ncalled an \"empty vessel\" in the government offices. He speaks and acts\nwithout stopping to think and utterly lacks the power of concentration.\nThe words burst from his mouth unexpectedly. The more naivet\u00c3\u00a9\nand ingenousness the actor puts into the character the better will he\nsustain the role. Khlestakov is dressed in the latest fashion.\n\nOSIP.--A typical middle-aged servant, grave in his address, with eyes\nalways a bit lowered. He is argumentative and loves to read sermons\ndirected at his master. His voice is usually monotonous. To his master\nhis tone is blunt and sharp, with even a touch of rudeness. He is the\ncleverer of the two and grasps a situation more quickly. But he does not\nlike to talk. He is a silent, uncommunicative rascal. He wears a shabby\ngray or blue coat.\n\nBOBCHINSKY AND DOBCHINSKY.--Short little fellows, strikingly like\neach other. Both have small paunches, and talk rapidly, with emphatic\ngestures of their hands, features and bodies. Dobchinsky is slightly\nthe taller and more subdued in manner. Bobchinsky is freer, easier and\nlivelier. They are both exceedingly inquisitive.\n\nLIAPKIN-TIAPKIN.--He has read four or five books and so is a bit of\na freethinker. He is always seeing a hidden meaning in things and\ntherefore puts weight into every word he utters. The actor should\npreserve an expression of importance throughout. He speaks in a bass\nvoice, with a prolonged rattle and wheeze in his throat, like an\nold-fashioned clock, which buzzes before it strikes.\n\nZEMLIANIKA.--Very fat, slow and awkward; but for all that a sly, cunning\nscoundrel. He is very obliging and officious.\n\nSHPEKIN.--Guileless to the point of simplemindedness. The other\ncharacters require no special explanation, as their originals can be met\nalmost anywhere.\n\nThe actors should pay especial attention to the last scene. The last\nword uttered must strike all at once, suddenly, like an electric shock.\nThe whole group should change its position at the same instant. The\nladies must all burst into a simultaneous cry of astonishment, as if\nwith one throat. The neglect of these directions may ruin the whole\neffect.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE INSPECTOR-GENERAL\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\nA Room in the Governor's House.\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\nAnton Antonovich, the Governor, Artemy Filippovich, the Superintendent\nof Charities, Luka Lukich, the Inspector of Schools, Ammos Fiodorovich,\nthe Judge, Stepan Ilyich, Christian Ivanovich, the Doctor, and two\nPolice Sergeants.\n\nGOVERNOR. I have called you together, gentlemen, to tell you an\nunpleasant piece of news. An Inspector-General is coming.\n\nAMMOS FIOD. What, an Inspector-General?\n\nARTEMY FIL. What, an Inspector-General?\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, an Inspector from St. Petersburg, incognito. And with\nsecret instructions, too.\n\nAMMOS. A pretty how-do-you-do!\n\nARTEMY. As if we hadn't enough trouble without an Inspector!\n\nLUKA LUKICH. Good Lord! With secret instructions!\n\nGOVERNOR. I had a sort of presentiment of it. Last night I kept dreaming\nof two rats--regular monsters! Upon my word, I never saw the likes of\nthem--black and supernaturally big. They came in, sniffed, and then went\naway.--Here's a letter I'll read to you--from Andrey Ivanovich. You\nknow him, Artemy Filippovich. Listen to what he writes: \"My dear\nfriend, godfather and benefactor--[He mumbles, glancing rapidly down the\npage.]--and to let you know\"--Ah, that's it--\"I hasten to let you know,\namong other things, that an official has arrived here with instructions\nto inspect the whole government, and your district especially. [Raises\nhis finger significantly.] I have learned of his being here from highly\ntrustworthy sources, though he pretends to be a private person. So, as\nyou have your little peccadilloes, you know, like everybody else--you\nare a sensible man, and you don't let the good things that come your\nway slip by--\" [Stopping] H'm, that's his junk--\"I advise you to take\nprecautions, as he may arrive any hour, if he hasn't already, and is not\nstaying somewhere incognito.--Yesterday--\" The rest are family matters.\n\"Sister Anna Krillovna is here visiting us with her husband. Ivan\nKrillovich has grown very fat and is always playing the fiddle\"--et\ncetera, et cetera. So there you have the situation we are confronted\nwith, gentlemen.\n\nAMMOS. An extraordinary situation, most extraordinary! Something behind\nit, I am sure.\n\nLUKA. But why, Anton Antonovich? What for? Why should we have an\nInspector?\n\nGOVERNOR. It's fate, I suppose. [Sighs.] Till now, thank goodness, they\nhave been nosing about in other towns. Now our turn has come.\n\nAMMOS. My opinion is, Anton Antonovich, that the cause is a deep one\nand rather political in character. It means this, that Russia--yes--that\nRussia intends to go to war, and the Government has secretly\ncommissioned an official to find out if there is any treasonable\nactivity anywhere.\n\nGOVERNOR. The wise man has hit on the very thing. Treason in this little\ncountry town! As if it were on the frontier! Why, you might gallop three\nyears away from here and reach nowhere.\n\nAMMOS. No, you don't catch on--you don't--The Government is shrewd. It\nmakes no difference that our town is so remote. The Government is on the\nlook-out all the same--\n\nGOVERNOR [cutting him short]. On the look-out, or not on the look-out,\nanyhow, gentlemen, I have given you warning. I have made some\narrangements for myself, and I advise you to do the same. You\nespecially, Artemy Filippovich. This official, no doubt, will want first\nof all to inspect your department. So you had better see to it that\neverything is in order, that the night-caps are clean, and the patients\ndon't go about as they usually do, looking as grimy as blacksmiths.\n\nARTEMY. Oh, that's a small matter. We can get night-caps easily enough.\n\nGOVERNOR. And over each bed you might hang up a placard stating in Latin\nor some other language--that's your end of it, Christian Ivanovich--the\nname of the disease, when the patient fell ill, the day of the week\nand the month. And I don't like your invalids to be smoking such strong\ntobacco. It makes you sneeze when you come in. It would be better, too,\nif there weren't so many of them. If there are a large number, it\nwill instantly be ascribed to bad supervision or incompetent medical\ntreatment.\n\nARTEMY. Oh, as to treatment, Christian Ivanovich and I have worked out\nour own system. Our rule is: the nearer to nature the better. We use\nno expensive medicines. A man is a simple affair. If he dies, he'd die\nanyway. If he gets well, he'd get well anyway. Besides, the doctor would\nhave a hard time making the patients understand him. He doesn't know a\nword of Russian.\n\nThe Doctor gives forth a sound intermediate between M and A.\n\nGOVERNOR. And you, Ammos Fiodorovich, had better look to the courthouse.\nThe attendants have turned the entrance hall where the petitioners\nusually wait into a poultry yard, and the geese and goslings go poking\ntheir beaks between people's legs. Of course, setting up housekeeping is\ncommendable, and there is no reason why a porter shouldn't do it. Only,\nyou see, the courthouse is not exactly the place for it. I had meant to\ntell you so before, but somehow it escaped my memory.\n\nAMMOS. Well, I'll have them all taken into the kitchen to-day. Will you\ncome and dine with me?\n\nGOVERNOR. Then, too, it isn't right to have the courtroom littered up\nwith all sorts of rubbish--to have a hunting-crop lying right among the\npapers on your desk. You're fond of sport, I know, still it's better to\nhave the crop removed for the present. When the Inspector is gone, you\nmay put it back again. As for your assessor, he's an educated man, to\nbe sure, but he reeks of spirits, as if he had just emerged from a\ndistillery. That's not right either. I had meant to tell you so long\nago, but something or other drove the thing out of my mind. If his\nodor is really a congenital defect, as he says, then there are ways of\nremedying it. You might advise him to eat onion or garlic, or something\nof the sort. Christian Ivanovich can help him out with some of his\nnostrums.\n\nThe Doctor makes the same sound as before.\n\nAMMOS. No, there's no cure for it. He says his nurse struck him when he\nwas a child, and ever since he has smelt of vodka.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, I just wanted to call your attention to it. As regards\nthe internal administration and what Andrey Ivanovich in his letter\ncalls \"little peccadilloes,\" I have nothing to say. Why, of course,\nthere isn't a man living who hasn't some sins to answer for. That's the\nway God made the world, and the Voltairean freethinkers can talk against\nit all they like, it won't do any good.\n\nAMMOS. What do you mean by sins? Anton Antonovich? There are sins and\nsins. I tell everyone plainly that I take bribes. I make no bones about\nit. But what kind of bribes? White greyhound puppies. That's quite a\ndifferent matter.\n\nGOVERNOR. H'm. Bribes are bribes, whether puppies or anything else.\n\nAMMOS. Oh, no, Anton Antonovich. But if one has a fur overcoat worth\nfive hundred rubles, and one's wife a shawl--\n\nGOVERNOR. [testily]. And supposing greyhound puppies are the only bribes\nyou take? You're an atheist, you never go to church, while I at least am\na firm believer and go to church every Sunday. You--oh, I know you. When\nyou begin to talk about the Creation it makes my flesh creep.\n\nAMMOS. Well, it's a conclusion I've reasoned out with my own brain.\n\nGOVERNOR. Too much brain is sometimes worse than none at all.--However,\nI merely mentioned the courthouse. I dare say nobody will ever look at\nit. It's an enviable place. God Almighty Himself seems to watch over it.\nBut you, Luka Lukich, as inspector of schools, ought to have an eye on\nthe teachers. They are very learned gentlemen, no doubt, with a college\neducation, but they have funny habits--inseparable from the profession,\nI know. One of them, for instance, the man with the fat face--I forget\nhis name--is sure, the moment he takes his chair, to screw up his face\nlike this. [Imitates him.] And then he has a trick of sticking his hand\nunder his necktie and smoothing down his beard. It doesn't matter, of\ncourse, if he makes a face at the pupils; perhaps it's even necessary.\nI'm no judge of that. But you yourself will admit that if he does it to\na visitor, it may turn out very badly. The Inspector, or anyone else,\nmight take it as meant for himself, and then the deuce knows what might\ncome of it.\n\nLUKA. But what can I do? I have told him about it time and again. Only\nthe other day when the marshal of the nobility came into the class-room,\nhe made such a face at him as I had never in my life seen before. I\ndare say it was with the best intentions; But I get reprimanded for\npermitting radical ideas to be instilled in the minds of the young.\n\nGOVERNOR. And then I must call your attention to the history teacher. He\nhas a lot of learning in his head and a store of facts. That's evident.\nBut he lectures with such ardor that he quite forgets himself. Once\nI listened to him. As long as he was talking about the Assyrians\nand Babylonians, it was not so bad. But when he reached Alexander of\nMacedon, I can't describe what came over him. Upon my word, I thought a\nfire had broken out. He jumped down from the platform, picked up a chair\nand dashed it to the floor. Alexander of Macedon was a hero, it is true.\nBut that's no reason for breaking chairs. The state must bear the cost.\n\nLUKA. Yes, he is a hot one. I have spoken to him about it several times.\nHe only says: \"As you please, but in the cause of learning I will even\nsacrifice my life.\"\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, it's a mysterious law of fate. Your clever man is either\na drunkard, or he makes such grimaces that you feel like running away.\n\nLUKA. Ah, Heaven save us from being in the educational department! One's\nafraid of everything. Everybody meddles and wants to show that he is as\nclever as you.\n\nGOVERNOR. Oh, that's nothing. But this cursed incognito! All of a sudden\nhe'll look in: \"Ah, so you're here, my dear fellows! And who's the judge\nhere?\" says he. \"Liapkin-Tiapkin.\" \"Bring Liapkin-Tiapkin here.--And who\nis the Superintendent of Charities?\" \"Zemlianika.\"--\"Bring Zemlianika\nhere!\"--That's what's bad.\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\nEnter Ivan Kuzmich, the Postmaster.\n\nPOSTMASTER. Tell me, gentlemen, who's coming? What chinovnik?\n\nGOVERNOR. What, haven't you heard?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Bobchinsky told me. He was at the postoffice just now.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, what do you think of it?\n\nPOSTMASTER. What do I think of it? Why, there'll be a war with the\nTurks.\n\nAMMOS. Exactly. Just what I thought.\n\nGOVERNOR [sarcastically]. Yes, you've both hit in the air precisely.\n\nPOSTMASTER. It's war with the Turks for sure, all fomented by the\nFrench.\n\nGOVERNOR. Nonsense! War with the Turks indeed. It's we who are going to\nget it, not the Turks. You may count on that. Here's a letter to prove\nit.\n\nPOSTMASTER. In that case, then, we won't go to war with the Turks.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, how do you feel about it, Ivan Kuzmich?\n\nPOSTMASTER. How do I feel? How do YOU feel about it, Anton Antonovich?\n\nGOVERNOR. I? Well, I'm not afraid, but I just feel a little--you\nknow--The merchants and townspeople bother me. I seem to be unpopular\nwith them. But the Lord knows if I've taken from some I've done it\nwithout a trace of ill-feeling. I even suspect--[Takes him by the\narm and walks aside with him.]--I even suspect that I may have been\ndenounced. Or why would they send an Inspector to us? Look here, Ivan\nKuzmich, don't you think you could--ahem!--just open a little every\nletter that passes through your office and read it--for the common\nbenefit of us all, you know--to see if it contains any kind of\ninformation against me, or is only ordinary correspondence. If it is all\nright, you can seal it up again, or simply deliver the letter opened.\n\nPOSTMASTER. Oh, I know. You needn't teach me that. I do it not so much\nas a precaution as out of curiosity. I just itch to know what's doing in\nthe world. And it's very interesting reading, I tell you. Some letters\nare fascinating--parts of them written grand--more edifying than the\nMoscow Gazette.\n\nGOVERNOR. Tell me, then, have you read anything about any official from\nSt. Petersburg?\n\nPOSTMASTER. No, nothing about a St. Petersburg official, but plenty\nabout Kostroma and Saratov ones. A pity you don't read the letters.\nThere are some very fine passages in them. For instance, not long ago a\nlieutenant writes to a friend describing a ball very wittily.--Splendid!\n\"Dear friend,\" he says, \"I live in the regions of the Empyrean, lots of\ngirls, bands playing, flags flying.\" He's put a lot of feeling into his\ndescription, a whole lot. I've kept the letter on purpose. Would you\nlike to read it?\n\nGOVERNOR. No, this is no time for such things. But please, Ivan Kuzmich,\ndo me the favor, if ever you chance upon a complaint or denunciation,\ndon't hesitate a moment, hold it back.\n\nPOSTMASTER. I will, with the greatest pleasure.\n\nAMMOS. You had better be careful. You may get yourself into trouble.\n\nPOSTMASTER. Goodness me!\n\nGOVERNOR. Never mind, never mind. Of course, it would be different if\nyou published it broadcast. But it's a private affair, just between us.\n\nAMMOS. Yes, it's a bad business--I really came here to make you a\npresent of a puppy, sister to the dog you know about. I suppose you have\nheard that Cheptovich and Varkhovinsky have started a suit. So now I\nlive in clover. I hunt hares first on the one's estate, then on the\nother's.\n\nGOVERNOR. I don't care about your hares now, my good friend. That cursed\nincognito is on my brain. Any moment the door may open and in walk--\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n\nEnter Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky, out of breath.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. What an extraordinary occurrence!\n\nDOBCHINSKY. An unexpected piece of news!\n\nALL. What is it? What is it?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Something quite unforeseen. We were about to enter the inn--\n\nBOBCHINSKY [interrupting]. Yes, Piotr Ivanovich and I were entering the\ninn--\n\nDOBCHINSKY [interrupting]. Please, Piotr Ivanovich, let me tell.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. No, please, let me--let me. You can't. You haven't got the\nstyle for it.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Oh, but you'll get mixed up and won't remember everything.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Yes, I will, upon my word, I will. PLEASE don't interrupt!\nDo let me tell the news--don't interrupt! Pray, oblige me, gentlemen,\nand tell Dobchinsky not to interrupt.\n\nGOVERNOR. Speak, for Heaven's sake! What is it? My heart is in my mouth!\nSit down, gentlemen, take seats. Piotr Ivanovich, here's a chair for\nyou. [All seat themselves around Bobchinsky and Dobchinsky.] Well, now,\nwhat is it? What is it?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Permit me, permit me. I'll tell it all just as it happened.\nAs soon as I had the pleasure of taking leave of you after you were good\nenough to be bothered with the letter which you had received, sir, I ran\nout--now, please don't keep interrupting, Dobchinsky. I know all about\nit, all, I tell you.--So I ran out to see Korobkin. But not finding\nKorobkin at home, I went off to Rastakovsky, and not seeing him, I went\nto Ivan Kuzmich to tell him of the news you'd got. Going on from there I\nmet Dobchinsky--\n\nDOBCHINSKY [interjecting]. At the stall where they sell pies--\n\nBOBCHINSKY. At the stall where they sell pies. Well, I met Dobchinsky\nand I said to him: \"Have you heard the news that came to Anton\nAntonovich in a letter which is absolutely reliable?\" But Piotr\nIvanovich had already heard of it from your housekeeper, Avdotya, who, I\ndon't know why, had been sent to Filipp Antonovich Pachechuyev--\n\nDOBCHINSKY [interrupting]. To get a little keg for French brandy.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Yes, to get a little keg for French brandy. So then I went\nwith Dobchinsky to Pachechuyev's.--Will you stop, Piotr Ivanovich?\nPlease don't interrupt.--So off we went to Pachechuyev's, and on the\nway Dobchinsky said: \"Let's go to the inn,\" he said. \"I haven't eaten a\nthing since morning. My stomach is growling.\" Yes, sir, his stomach was\ngrowling. \"They've just got in a supply of fresh salmon at the inn,\" he\nsaid. \"Let's take a bite.\" We had hardly entered the inn when we saw a\nyoung man--\n\nDOBCHINSKY [Interrupting]. Of rather good appearance and dressed in\nordinary citizen's clothes.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Yes, of rather good appearance and dressed in citizen's\nclothes--walking up and down the room. There was something out of the\nusual about his face, you know, something deep--and a manner about\nhim--and here [raises his hand to his forehead and turns it around\nseveral times] full, full of everything. I had a sort of feeling, and I\nsaid to Dobchinsky, \"Something's up. This is no ordinary matter.\"\nYes, and Dobchinsky beckoned to the landlord, Vlas, the innkeeper,\nyou know,--three weeks ago his wife presented him with a baby--a\nbouncer--he'll grow up just like his father and keep a tavern.--Well,\nwe beckoned to Vlas, and Dobchinsky asked him on the quiet, \"Who,\" he\nasked, \"is that young man?\" \"That young man,\" Vlas replied, \"that young\nman\"--Oh, don't interrupt, Piotr Ivanovich, please don't interrupt. You\ncan't tell the story. Upon my word, you can't. You lisp and one tooth in\nyour mouth makes you whistle. I know what I'm saying. \"That young man,\"\nhe said, \"is an official.\"--Yes, sir.--\"On his way from St. Petersburg.\nAnd his name,\" he said, \"is Ivan Aleksandrovich Khlestakov, and he's\ngoing,\" he said \"to the government of Saratov,\" he said. \"And he acts\nso queerly. It's the second week he's been here and he's never left the\nhouse; and he won't pay a penny, takes everything on account.\" When\nVlas told me that, a light dawned on me from above, and I said to Piotr\nIvanovich, \"Hey!\"--\n\nDOBCHINSKY. No, Piotr Ivanovich, I said \"HEY!\"\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Well first YOU said it, then I did. \"Hey!\" said both of us,\n\"And why does he stick here if he's going to Saratov?\"--Yes, sir, that's\nhe, the official.\n\nGOVERNOR. Who? What official?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Why, the official who you were notified was coming, the\nInspector.\n\nGOVERNOR [terrified]. Great God! What's that you're saying. It can't be\nhe.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. It is, though. Why, he doesn't pay his bills and he doesn't\nleave. Who else can it be? And his postchaise is ordered for Saratov.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. It's he, it's he, it's he--why, he's so alert, he\nscrutinized everything. He saw that Dobchinsky and I were eating\nsalmon--chiefly on account of Dobchinsky's stomach--and he looked at our\nplates so hard that I was frightened to death.\n\nGOVERNOR. The Lord have mercy on us sinners! In what room is he staying?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Room number 5 near the stairway.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. In the same room that the officers quarreled in when they\npassed through here last year.\n\nGOVERNOR. How long has he been here?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Two weeks. He came on St. Vasili's day.\n\nGOVERNOR. Two weeks! [Aside.] Holy Fathers and saints preserve me! In\nthose two weeks I have flogged the wife of a non-commissioned officer,\nthe prisoners were not given their rations, the streets are dirty as a\npothouse--a scandal, a disgrace! [Clutches his head with both hands.]\n\nARTEMY. What do you think, Anton Antonovich, hadn't we better go in\nstate to the inn?\n\nAMMOS. No, no. First send the chief magistrate, then the clergy, then\nthe merchants. That's what it says in the book. The Acts of John the\nFreemason.\n\nGOVERNOR. No, no, leave it to me. I have been in difficult situations\nbefore now. They have passed off all right, and I was even rewarded\nwith thanks. Maybe the Lord will help us out this time, too. [Turns to\nBobchinsky.] You say he's a young man?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Yes, about twenty-three or four at the most.\n\nGOVERNOR. So much the better. It's easier to pump things out of a young\nman. It's tough if you've got a hardened old devil to deal with. But a\nyoung man is all on the surface. You, gentlemen, had better see to your\nend of things while I go unofficially, by myself, or with Dobchinsky\nhere, as though for a walk, to see that the visitors that come to town\nare properly accommodated. Here, Svistunov. [To one of the Sergeants.]\n\nSVISTUNOV. Sir.\n\nGOVERNOR. Go instantly to the Police Captain--or, no, I'll want you.\nTell somebody to send him here as quickly as possibly and then come\nback.\n\nSvistunov hurries off.\n\nARTEMY. Let's go, let's go, Ammos Fiodorovich. We may really get into\ntrouble.\n\nAMMOS. What have you got to be afraid of? Put clean nightcaps on the\npatients and the thing's done.\n\nARTEMY. Nightcaps! Nonsense! The patients were ordered to have oatmeal\nsoup. Instead of that there's such a smell of cabbage in all the\ncorridors that you've got to hold your nose.\n\nAMMOS. Well, my mind's at ease. Who's going to visit the court?\nSupposing he does look at the papers, he'll wish he had left them alone.\nI have been on the bench fifteen years, and when I take a look into a\nreport, I despair. King Solomon in all his wisdom could not tell what is\ntrue and what is not true in it.\n\nThe Judge, the Superintendent of Charities, the School Inspector, and\nPostmaster go out and bump up against the Sergeant in the doorway as the\nlatter returns.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n\nThe Governor, Bobchinsky, Dobchinsky, and Sergeant Svistunov.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, is the cab ready?\n\nSVISTUNOV. Yes, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR. Go out on the street--or, no, stop--go and bring--why, where\nare the others? Why are you alone? Didn't I give orders for Prokhorov to\nbe here? Where is Prokhorov?\n\nSVISTUNOV. Prokhorov is in somebody's house and can't go on duty just\nnow.\n\nGOVERNOR. Why so?\n\nSVISTUNOV. Well, they brought him back this morning dead drunk. They\npoured two buckets of water over him, but he hasn't sobered up yet.\n\nGOVERNOR [clutching his head with both hands]. For Heaven's sake! Go\nout on duty quick--or, no, run up to my room, do you hear? And fetch my\nsword and my new hat. Now, Piotr Ivanovich, [to Dobchinsky] come.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. And me--me, too. Let me come, too, Anton Antonovich.\n\nGOVERNOR. No, no, Bobchinsky, it won't do. Besides there is not enough\nroom in the cab.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Oh, that doesn't matter. I'll follow the cab on foot--on\nfoot. I just want to peep through a crack--so--to see that manner of\nhis--how he acts.\n\nGOVERNOR [turning to the Sergeant and taking his sword]. Be off and get\nthe policemen together. Let them each take a--there, see how scratched\nmy sword is. It's that dog of a merchant, Abdulin. He sees the\nGovernor's sword is old and doesn't provide a new one. Oh, the sharpers!\nI'll bet they've got their petitions against me ready in their coat-tail\npockets.--Let each take a street in his hand--I don't mean a street--a\nbroom--and sweep the street leading to the inn, and sweep it clean,\nand--do you hear? And see here, I know you, I know your tricks. You\ninsinuate yourselves into the inn and walk off with silver spoons in\nyour boots. Just you look out. I keep my ears pricked. What have you\nbeen up to with the merchant, Chorniayev, eh? He gave you two yards of\ncloth for your uniform and you stole the whole piece. Take care. You're\nonly a Sergeant. Don't graft higher than your rank. Off with you.\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\nEnter the Police Captain.\n\nGOVERNOR. Hello, Stepan Ilyich, where the dickens have you been keeping\nyourself? What do you mean by acting that way?\n\nCAPTAIN. Why, I was just outside the gate.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, listen, Stepan Ilyich. An official has come from St.\nPetersburg. What have you done about it?\n\nCAPTAIN. What you told me to. I sent Sergeant Pugovichyn with policemen\nto clean the street.\n\nGOVERNOR. Where is Derzhimorda?\n\nCAPTAIN. He has gone off on the fire engine.\n\nGOVERNOR. And Prokhorov is drunk?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes.\n\nGOVERNOR. How could you allow him to get drunk?\n\nCAPTAIN. God knows. Yesterday there was a fight outside the town. He\nwent to restore order and was brought back drunk.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, then, this is what you are to do.--Sergeant\nPugovichyn--he is tall. So he is to stand on duty on the bridge for\nappearance' sake. Then the old fence near the bootmaker's must be pulled\ndown at once and a post stuck up with a whisp of straw so as to look\nlike grading. The more debris there is the more it will show the\ngovernor's activity.--Good God, though, I forgot that about forty\ncart-loads of rubbish have been dumped against that fence. What a vile,\nfilthy town this is! A monument, or even only a fence, is erected, and\ninstantly they bring a lot of dirt together, from the devil knows where,\nand dump it there. [Heaves a sigh.] And if the functionary that has come\nhere asks any of the officials whether they are satisfied, they are to\nsay, \"Perfectly satisfied, your Honor\"; and if anybody is not satisfied,\nI'll give him something to be dissatisfied about afterwards.--Ah, I'm\na sinner, a terrible sinner. [Takes the hat-box, instead of his hat.]\nHeaven only grant that I may soon get this matter over and done with;\nthen I'll donate a candle such as has never been offered before. I'll\nlevy a hundred pounds of wax from every damned merchant. Oh my, oh my!\nCome, let's go, Piotr Ivanovich. [Tries to put the hat-box on his head\ninstead of his hat.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Anton Antonovich, that's the hat-box, not your hat.\n\nGOVERNOR [throwing the box down]. If it's the hat-box, it's the hat-box,\nthe deuce take it!--And if he asks why the church at the hospital for\nwhich the money was appropriated five years ago has not been built,\ndon't let them forget to say that the building was begun but was\ndestroyed by fire. I sent in a report about it, you know. Some blamed\nfool might forget and let out that the building was never even begun.\nAnd tell Derzhimorda not to be so free with his fists. Guilty\nor innocent, he makes them all see stars in the cause of public\norder.--Come on, come on, Dobchinsky. [Goes out and returns.] And don't\nlet the soldiers appear on the streets with nothing on. That rotten\ngarrison wear their coats directly over their undershirts.\n\nAll go out.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\nAnna Andreyevna and Marya Antonovna rush in on the stage.\n\nANNA. Where are they? Where are they? Oh, my God! [opening the door.]\nHusband! Antosha! Anton! [hurriedly, to Marya.] It's all your fault.\nDawdling! Dawdling!--\"I want a pin--I want a scarf.\" [Runs to the window\nand calls.] Anton, where are you going? Where are you going? What! He\nhas come? The Inspector? He has a moustache? What kind of a moustache?\n\nGOVERNOR [from without]. Wait, dear. Later.\n\nANNA. Wait? I don't want to wait. The idea, wait! I only want one word.\nIs he a colonel or what? Eh? [Disgusted.] There, he's gone! You'll pay\nfor it! It's all your fault--you, with your \"Mamma, dear, wait a moment,\nI'll just pin my scarf. I'll come directly.\" Yes, directly! Now we have\nmissed the news. It's all your confounded coquettishness. You heard the\nPostmaster was here and so you must prink and prim yourself in front of\nthe mirror--look on this side and that side and all around. You imagine\nhe's smitten with you. But I can tell you he makes a face at you the\nmoment you turn your back.\n\nMARYA. It can't be helped, mamma. We'll know everything in a couple of\nhours anyway.\n\nANNA. In a couple of hours! Thank you! A nice answer. Why don't you\nsay, in a month. We'll know still more in a month. [She leans out of the\nwindow.] Here, Avdotya! I say! Have you heard whether anybody has come,\nAvdotya?--No, you goose, you didn't--He waved his hands? Well, what of\nit? Let him wave his hands. But you should have asked him anyhow.\nYou couldn't find out, of course, with your head full of nonsense and\nlovers. Eh, what? They left in a hurry? Well, you should have run after\nthe carriage. Off with you, off with you at once, do you hear? Run and\nask everybody where they are. Be sure and find out who the newcomer\nis and what he is like, do you hear? Peep through a crack and find\neverything out--what sort of eyes he has, whether they are black or\nblue, and be back here instantly, this minute, do you hear? Quick,\nquick, quick!\n\nShe keeps on calling and they both stand at the window until the curtain\ndrops.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nA small room in the inn, bed, table, travelling bag, empty bottle,\nboots, clothes brush, etc.\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\nOSIP [lying on his master's bed]. The devil take it! I'm so hungry.\nThere's a racket in my belly, as if a whole regiment were blowing\ntrumpets. We'll never reach home. I'd like to know what we are going to\ndo. Two months already since we left St. Pete. He's gone through all his\ncash, the precious buck, so now he sticks here with his tail between his\nlegs and takes it easy. We'd have had enough and more than enough to pay\nfor the fare, but no he must exhibit himself in every town. [Imitates\nhim.] \"Osip, get me the best room to be had and order the best dinner\nthey serve. I can't stand bad food. I must have the best.\" It would be\nall right for a somebody, but for a common copying clerk! Goes and gets\nacquainted with the other travellers, plays cards, and plays himself\nout of his last penny. Oh, I'm sick of this life. It's better in our\nvillage, really. There isn't so much going on, but then there is less to\nbother about. You get yourself a wife and lie on the stove all the time\nand eat pie. Of course, if you wanted to tell the truth, there's no\ndenying it that there's nothing like living in St. Pete. All you want is\nmoney. And then you can live smart and classy--theeadres, dogs to dance\nfor you, everything, and everybody talks so genteel, pretty near like\nin high society. If you go to the Schukin bazaar, the shopkeepers cry,\n\"Gentlemen,\" at you. You sit with the officials in the ferry boat. If\nyou want company, you go into a shop. A sport there will tell you about\nlife in the barracks and explain the meaning of every star in the sky,\nso that you see them all as if you held them in your hand. Then an old\nofficer's wife will gossip, or a pretty chambermaid will dart a look\nat you--ta, ta, ta! [Smirks and wags his head.] And what deucedly civil\nmanners they have, too. You never hear no impolite language. They always\nsay \"Mister\" to you. If you are tired of walking, why you take a cab\nand sit in it like a lord. And if you don't feel like paying, then you\ndon't. Every house has an open-work gate and you can slip through\nand the devil himself won't catch you. There's one bad thing, though;\nsometimes you get first class eats and sometimes you're so starved you\nnearly drop--like now. It's all his fault. What can you do with him? His\ndad sends him money to keep him going, but the devil a lot it does. He\ngoes off on a spree, rides in cabs, gets me to buy a theeadre ticket for\nhim every day, and in a week look at him--sends me to the old clo'es man\nto sell his new dress coat. Sometimes he gets rid of everything down to\nhis last shirt and is left with nothing except his coat and overcoat.\nUpon my word, it's the truth. And such fine cloth, too. English, you\nknow. One dress coat costs him a hundred and fifty rubles and he sells\nit to the old clo'es man for twenty. No use saying nothing about his\npants. They go for a song. And why? Because he doesn't tend to his\nbusiness. Instead of sticking to his job, he gads about on the Prospect\nand plays cards. Ah, if the old gentleman only knew it! He wouldn't care\nthat you are an official. He'd lift up your little shirtie and would lay\nit on so that you'd go about rubbing yourself for a week. If you have\na job, stick to it. Here's the innkeeper says he won't let you have\nanything to eat unless you pay your back bills. Well, and suppose we\ndon't pay. [Sighing.] Oh, good God! If only I could get cabbage soup. I\nthink I could eat up the whole world now. There's a knock at the door. I\nsuppose it's him. [Rises from the bed hastily.]\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\nOsip and Khlestakov.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Here! [Hands him his cap and cane.] What, been warming the\nbed again!\n\nOSIP. Why should I have been warming the bed? Have I never seen a bed\nbefore?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You're lying. The bed's all tumbled up.\n\nOSIP. What do I want a bed for? Don't I know what a bed is like? I have\nlegs and can use them to stand on. I don't need your bed.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [walking up and down the room]. Go see if there isn't some\ntobacco in the pouch.\n\nOSIP. What tobacco? You emptied it out four days ago.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [pacing the room and twisting his lips. Finally he says in a\nloud resolute voice]. Listen--a--Osip.\n\nOSIP. Yes, sir?\n\nKHLESTAKOV [In a voice just as loud, but not quite so resolute]. Go down\nthere.\n\nOSIP. Where?\n\nKHLESTAKOV [in a voice not at all resolute, nor loud, but almost in\nentreaty]. Down to the restaurant--tell them--to send up dinner.\n\nOSIP. No, I won't.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How dare you, you fool!\n\nOSIP. It won't do any good, anyhow. The landlord said he won't let you\nhave anything more to eat.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How dare he! What nonsense is this?\n\nOSIP. He'll go to the Governor, too, he says. It's two weeks now since\nyou've paid him, he says. You and your master are cheats, he says, and\nyour master is a blackleg besides, he says. We know the breed. We've\nseen swindlers like him before.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. And you're delighted, I suppose, to repeat all this to me,\nyou donkey.\n\nOSIP. \"Every Tom, Dick and Harry comes and lives here,\" he says, \"and\nruns up debts so that you can't even put him out. I'm not going to fool\nabout it,\" he says, \"I'm going straight to the Governor and have him\narrested and put in jail.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That'll do now, you fool. Go down at once and tell him to\nhave dinner sent up. The coarse brute! The idea!\n\nOSIP. Hadn't I better call the landlord here?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What do I want the landlord for? Go and tell him yourself.\n\nOSIP. But really, master--\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well, go, the deuce take you. Call the landlord.\n\nOsip goes out.\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n\nKHLESTAKOV [alone]. I am so ravenously hungry. I took a little stroll\nthinking I could walk off my appetite. But, hang it, it clings. If I\nhadn't dissipated so in Penza I'd have had enough money to get home\nwith. The infantry captain did me up all right. Wonderful the way the\nscoundrel cut the cards! It didn't take more than a quarter of an hour\nfor him to clean me out of my last penny. And yet I would give\nanything to have another set-to with him. Only I never will have the\nchance.--What a rotten town this is! You can't get anything on credit in\nthe grocery shops here. It's deucedly mean, it is. [He whistles, first\nan air from Robert le Diable, then a popular song, then a blend of the\ntwo.] No one's coming.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n\nKhlestakov, Osip, and a Servant.\n\nSERVANT. The landlord sent me up to ask what you want.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Ah, how do you do, brother! How are you? How are you?\n\nSERVANT. All right, thank you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. And how are you getting on in the inn? Is business good?\n\nSERVANT. Yes, business is all right, thank you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Many guests?\n\nSERVANT. Plenty.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. See here, good friend. They haven't sent me dinner yet.\nPlease hurry them up! See that I get it as soon as possible. I have some\nbusiness to attend to immediately after dinner.\n\nSERVANT. The landlord said he won't let you have anything any more. He\nwas all for going to the Governor to-day and making a complaint against\nyou.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What's there to complain about? Judge for yourself, friend.\nWhy, I've got to eat. If I go on like this I'll turn into a skeleton.\nI'm hungry, I'm not joking.\n\nSERVANT. Yes, sir, that's what he said. \"I won't let him have no\ndinner,\" he said, \"till he pays for what he has already had.\" That was\nhis answer.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Try to persuade him.\n\nSERVANT. But what shall I tell him?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Explain that it's a serious matter, I've got to eat. As for\nthe money, of course--He thinks that because a muzhik like him can go\nwithout food a whole day others can too. The idea!\n\nSERVANT. Well, all right. I'll tell him.\n\nThe Servant and Osip go out.\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\nKhlestakov alone.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. A bad business if he refuses to let me have anything. I'm\nso hungry. I've never been so hungry in my life. Shall I try to raise\nsomething on my clothes? Shall I sell my trousers? No, I'd rather starve\nthan come home without a St. Petersburg suit. It's a shame Joachim\nwouldn't let me have a carriage on hire. It would have been great to\nride home in a carriage, drive up under the porte-cochere of one of the\nneighbors with lamps lighted and Osip behind in livery. Imagine the stir\nit would have created. \"Who is it? What's that?\" Then my footman walks\nin [draws himself up and imitates] and an-nounces: \"Ivan Aleksandrovich\nKhlestakov of St. Petersburg. Will you receive him?\" Those country\nlubbers don't even know what it means to \"receive.\" If any lout of\na country squire pays them a visit, he stalks straight into the\ndrawing-room like a bear. Then you step up to one of their pretty girls\nand say: \"Dee-lighted, madam.\" [Rubs his hands and bows.] Phew! [Spits.]\nI feel positively sick, I'm so hungry.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\nKhlestakov, Osip, and later the Servant.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well?\n\nOSIP. They're bringing dinner.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [claps his hands and wriggles in his chair]. Dinner, dinner,\ndinner!\n\nSERVANT [with plates and napkin]. This is the last time the landlord\nwill let you have dinner.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. The landlord, the landlord! I spit on your landlord. What\nhave you got there?\n\nSERVANT. Soup and roast beef.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What! Only two courses?\n\nSERVANT. That's all.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Nonsense! I won't take it. What does he mean by that? Ask\nhim. It's not enough.\n\nSERVANT. The landlord says it's too much.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why is there no sauce?\n\nSERVANT. There is none.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why not? I saw them preparing a whole lot when I passed\nthrough the kitchen. And in the dining-room this morning two short\nlittle men were eating salmon and lots of other things.\n\nSERVANT. Well, you see, there is some and there isn't.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why \"isn't\"?\n\nSERVANT. Because there isn't any.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What, no salmon, no fish, no cutlets?\n\nSERVANT. Only for the better kind of folk.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You're a fool.\n\nSERVANT. Yes, sir.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You measly suckling pig. Why can they eat and I not? Why the\ndevil can't I eat, too? Am I not a guest the same as they?\n\nSERVANT. No, not the same. That's plain.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How so?\n\nSERVANT. That's easy. THEY pay, that's it.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm not going to argue with you, simpleton! [Ladles out\nthe soup and begins to eat.] What, you call that soup? Simply hot water\npoured into a cup. No taste to it at all. It only stinks. I don't want\nit. Bring me some other soup.\n\nSERVANT. All right. I'll take it away. The boss said if you didn't want\nit, you needn't take it.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [putting his hand over the dishes]. Well, well, leave it\nalone, you fool. You may be used to treat other people this way, but\nI'm not that sort. I advise you not to try it on me. My God! What soup!\n[Goes on eating.] I don't think anybody in the world tasted such soup.\nFeathers floating on the top instead of butter. [Cuts the piece of\nchicken in the soup.] Oh, oh, oh! What a bird!--Give me the roast beef.\nThere's a little soup left, Osip. Take it. [Cuts the meat.] What sort of\nroast beef is this? This isn't roast beef.\n\nSERVANT. What else is it?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. The devil knows, but it isn't roast beef. It's roast iron,\nnot roast beef. [Eats.] Scoundrels! Crooks! The stuff they give you to\neat! It makes your jaws ache to chew one piece of it. [Picks his teeth\nwith his fingers.] Villains! It's as tough as the bark of a tree. I\ncan't pull it out no matter how hard I try. Such meat is enough to ruin\none's teeth. Crooks! [Wipes his mouth with the napkin.] Is there nothing\nelse?\n\nSERVANT. No.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Scoundrels! Blackguards! They might have given some decent\npastry, or something, the lazy good-for-nothings! Fleecing their guests!\nThat's all they're good for.\n\n[The Servant takes the dishes and carries them out accompanied by Osip.]\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\n\n\nKhlestakov alone.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. It's just as if I had eaten nothing at all, upon my word. It\nhas only whetted my appetite. If I only had some change to send to the\nmarket and buy some bread.\n\nOSIP [entering]. The Governor has come, I don't know what for. He's\ninquiring about you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [in alarm]. There now! That inn-keeper has gone and made a\ncomplaint against me. Suppose he really claps me into jail? Well! If he\ndoes it in a gentlemanly way, I may--No, no, I won't. The officers and\nthe people are all out on the street and I set the fashion for them and\nthe merchant's daughter and I flirted. No, I won't. And pray, who is he?\nHow dare he, actually? What does he take me for? A tradesman? I'll tell\nhim straight out, \"How dare you? How--\"\n\n[The door knob turns and Khlestakov goes pale and shrinks back.]\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII\n\n\nKhlestakov, the Governor, and Dobchinsky.\n\nThe Governor advances a few steps and stops. They stare at each other a\nfew moments wide-eyed and frightened.\n\nGOVERNOR [recovering himself a little and saluting military fashion]. I\nhave come to present my compliments, sir.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [bows]. How do you do, sir?\n\nGOVERNOR. Excuse my intruding.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Pray don't mention it.\n\nGOVERNOR. It's my duty as chief magistrate of this town to see that\nvisitors and persons of rank should suffer no inconveniences.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [a little halting at first, but toward the end in a\nloud, firm voice]. Well--what was--to be--done? It's not--my fault.\nI'm--really going to pay. They will send me money from home. [Bobchinsky\npeeps in at the door.] He's most to blame. He gives me beef as hard as a\nboard and the soup--the devil knows what he put into it. I ought to have\npitched it out of the window. He starves me the whole day. His tea is so\npeculiar--it smells of fish, not tea. So why should I--The idea!\n\nGOVERNOR [scared]. Excuse me! I assure you, it's not my fault. I always\nhave good beef in the market here. The Kholmogory merchants bring it,\nand they are sober, well-behaved people. I'm sure I don't know where he\ngets his bad meat from. But if anything is wrong, may I suggest that you\nallow me to take you to another place?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, I thank you. I don't care to leave. I know what\nthe other place is--the jail. What right have you, I should like\nto know--how dare you?--Why, I'm in the government service at St.\nPetersburg. [Puts on a bold front.] I--I--I--\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. My God, how angry he is. He has found out everything.\nThose damned merchants have told him everything.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [with bravado]. I won't go even if you come here with your\nwhole force. I'll go straight to the minister. [Bangs his fist on the\ntable.] What do you mean? What do you mean?\n\nGOVERNOR [drawing himself up stiffly and shaking all over]. Have pity\non me. Don't ruin me. I have a wife and little children. Don't bring\nmisfortune on a man.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, I won't go. What's that got to do with me? Must I go\nto jail because you have a wife and little children? Great! [Bobchinsky\nlooks in at the door and disappears in terror.] No, much obliged to you.\nI will not go.\n\nGOVERNOR [trembling]. It was my inexperience. I swear to you, it was\nnothing but my inexperience and insufficient means. Judge for yourself.\nThe salary I get is not enough for tea and sugar. And if I have taken\nbribes, they were mere trifles--something for the table, or a coat or\ntwo. As for the officer's widow to whom they say I gave a beating, she's\nin business now, and it's a slander, it's a slander that I beat her.\nThose scoundrels here invented the lie. They are ready to murder me.\nThat's the kind of people they are.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well. I've nothing to do with them. [Reflecting.] I\ndon't see, though, why you should talk to me about your scoundrels or\nofficer's widow. An officer's widow is quite a different matter.--But\ndon't you dare to beat me. You can't do it to me--no, sir, you can't.\nThe idea! Look at him! I'll pay, I'll pay the money. Just now I'm out of\ncash. That's why I stay here--because I haven't a single kopek.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. Oh, he's a shrewd one. So that's what he's aiming\nat? He's raised such a cloud of dust you can't tell what direction he's\ngoing. Who can guess what he wants? One doesn't know where to begin. But\nI will try. Come what may, I'll try--hit or miss. [Aloud.] H'm, if you\nreally are in want of money, I'm ready to serve you. It is my duty to\nassist strangers in town.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Lend me some, lend me some. Then I'll settle up immediately\nwith the landlord. I only want two hundred rubles. Even less would do.\n\nGOVERNOR. There's just two hundred rubles. [Giving him the money.] Don't\nbother to count it.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [taking it]. Very much obliged to you. I'll send it back to\nyou as soon as I get home. I just suddenly found myself without--H'm--I\nsee you are a gentleman. Now it's all different.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. Well, thank the Lord, he's taken the money. Now I\nsuppose things will move along smoothly. I slipped four hundred instead\nof two into his hand.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Ho, Osip! [Osip enters.] Tell the servant to come. [To the\nGovernor and Dobchinsky.] Please be seated. [To Dobchinsky.] Please take\na seat, I beg of you.\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't trouble. We can stand.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. But, please, please be seated. I now see perfectly how\nopen-hearted and generous you are. I confess I thought you had come to\nput me in--[To Dobchinsky.] Do take a chair.\n\nThe Governor and Dobchinsky sit down. Bobchinsky looks in at the door\nand listens.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. I must be bolder. He wants us to pretend he is\nincognito. Very well, we will talk nonsense, too. We'll pretend we\nhaven't the least idea who he is. [Aloud.] I was going about in the\nperformance of my duty with Piotr Ivanovich Dobchinsky here--he's a\nlanded proprietor here--and we came to the inn to see whether the guests\nare properly accommodated--because I'm not like other governors, who\ndon't care about anything. No, apart from my duty, out of pure Christian\nphilanthropy, I wish every mortal to be decently treated. And as if\nto reward me for my pains, chance has afforded me this pleasant\nacquaintance.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I, too, am delighted. Without your aid, I confess, I should\nhave had to stay here a long time. I didn't know how in the world to pay\nmy bill.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. Oh, yes, fib on.--Didn't know how to pay his bill! May\nI ask where your Honor is going?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm going to my own village in the Government of Saratov.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside, with an ironical expression on his face]. The\nGovernment of Saratov! H'm, h'm! And doesn't even blush! One must be\non the qui vive with this fellow. [Aloud.] You have undertaken a great\ntask. They say travelling is disagreeable because of the delay in\ngetting horses but, on the other hand, it is a diversion. You are\ntravelling for your own amusement, I suppose?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, my father wants me. He's angry because so far I haven't\nmade headway in the St. Petersburg service. He thinks they stick the\nVladimir in your buttonhole the minute you get there. I'd like him to\nknock about in the government offices for a while.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. How he fabricates! Dragging in his old father, too.\n[Aloud.] And may I ask whether you are going there to stay for long?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I really don't know. You see, my father is stubborn and\nstupid--an old dotard as hard as a block of wood. I'll tell him straight\nout, \"Do what you will, I can't live away from St. Petersburg.\" Really,\nwhy should I waste my life among peasants? Our times make different\ndemands on us. My soul craves enlightenment.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. He can spin yarns all right. Lie after lie and never\ntrips. And such an ugly insignificant-looking creature, too. Why, it\nseems to me I could crush him with my finger nails. But wait, I'll make\nyou talk. I'll make you tell me things. [Aloud.] You were quite right\nin your observation, that one can do nothing in a dreary out-of-the-way\nplace. Take this town, for instance. You lie awake nights, you work hard\nfor your country, you don't spare yourself, and the reward? You don't\nknow when it's coming. [He looks round the room.] This room seems rather\ndamp.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, it's a dirty room. And the bugs! I've never experienced\nanything like them. They bite like dogs.\n\nGOVERNOR. You don't say! An illustrious guest like you to be subjected\nto such annoyance at the hands of--whom? Of vile bugs which should never\nhave been born. And I dare say, it's dark here, too.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, very gloomy. The landlord has introduced the custom of\nnot providing candles. Sometimes I want to do something--read a bit, or,\nif the fancy strikes me, write something.--I can't. It's a dark room,\nyes, very dark.\n\nGOVERNOR. I wonder if I might be bold enough to ask you--but, no, I'm\nunworthy.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What is it?\n\nGOVERNOR. No, no, I'm unworthy. I'm unworthy.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. But what is it?\n\nGOVERNOR. If I might be bold enough--I have a fine room for you at\nhome, light and cosy. But no, I feel it is too great an honor. Don't\nbe offended. Upon my word, I made the offer out of the simplicity of my\nheart.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. On the contrary, I accept your invitation with pleasure.\nI should feel much more comfortable in a private house than in this\ndisreputable tavern.\n\nGOVERNOR. I'm only too delighted. How glad my wife will be. It's my\ncharacter, you know. I've always been hospitable from my very childhood,\nespecially when my guest is a distinguished person. Don't think I say\nthis out of flattery. No, I haven't that vice. I only speak from the\nfullness of my heart.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm greatly obliged to you. I myself hate double-faced\npeople. I like your candor and kind-heartedness exceedingly. And I am\nfree to say, I ask for nothing else than devotion and esteem--esteem and\ndevotion.\n\n\n\nSCENE IX\n\n\nThe above and the Servant, accompanied by Osip. Bobchinsky peeps in at\nthe door.\n\nSERVANT. Did your Honor wish anything?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, let me have the bill.\n\nSERVANT. I gave you the second one a little while ago.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, I can't remember your stupid accounts. Tell me what the\nwhole comes to.\n\nSERVANT. You were pleased to order dinner the first day. The second day\nyou only took salmon. And then you took everything on credit.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Fool! [Starts to count it all up now.] How much is it\naltogether?\n\nGOVERNOR. Please don't trouble yourself. He can wait. [To the Servant.]\nGet out of here. The money will be sent to you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, that's so, of course. [He puts the money in his\npocket.]\n\nThe Servant goes out. Bobchinsky peeps in at the door.\n\n\n\nSCENE X\n\n\nThe Governor, Khlestakov and Dobchinsky.\n\nGOVERNOR. Would you care to inspect a few institutions in our town\nnow--the philanthropic institutions, for instance, and others?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. But what is there to see?\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, you'll see how they're run--the order in which we keep\nthem.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, with the greatest pleasure. I'm ready.\n\nBobchinsky puts his head in at the door.\n\nGOVERNOR. And then, if you wish, we can go from there and inspect the\ndistrict school and see our method of education.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, yes, if you please.\n\nGOVERNOR. Afterwards, if you should like to visit our town jails and\nprisons, you will see how our criminals are kept.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, yes, but why go to prison? We had better go to see the\nphilanthropic institutions.\n\nGOVERNOR. As you please. Do you wish to ride in your own carriage, or\nwith me in the cab?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'd rather take the cab with you.\n\nGOVERNOR [to Dobchinsky]. Now there'll be no room for you, Piotr\nIvanovich.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. It doesn't matter. I'll walk.\n\nGOVERNOR [aside, to Dobchinsky]. Listen. Run as fast as you can and take\ntwo notes, one to Zemlianika at the hospital, the other to my wife. [To\nKhlestakov.] May I take the liberty of asking you to permit me to write\na line to my wife to tell her to make ready to receive our honored\nguest?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why go to so much trouble? However, there is the ink. I\ndon't know whether there is any paper. Would the bill do?\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, that'll do. [Writes, talking to himself at the\nsame time.] We'll see how things will go after lunch and several\nstout-bellied bottles. We have some Russian Madeira, not much to look\nat, but it will knock an elephant off its legs. If I only knew what he\nis and how much I have to be [on] my guard.\n\nHe finishes writing and gives the notes to Dobchinsky. As the latter\nwalks across the stage, the door suddenly falls in, and Bobchinsky\ntumbles in with it to the floor. All exclaim in surprise. Bobchinsky\nrises.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Have you hurt yourself?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Oh, it's nothing--nothing at all--only a little bruise on my\nnose. I'll run in to Dr. H\u00c3\u00bcbner's. He has a sort of plaster. It'll\nsoon pass away.\n\nGOVERNOR [making an angry gesture at Bobchinsky. To Khlestakov]. Oh,\nit's nothing. Now, if you please, sir, we'll go. I'll tell your servant\nto carry your luggage over. [Calls Osip.] Here, my good fellow, take all\nyour master's things to my house, the Governor's. Anyone will tell you\nwhere it is. By your leave, sir. [Makes way for Khlestakov and follows\nhim; then turns and says reprovingly to Bobchinsky.] Couldn't you find\nsome other place to fall in? Sprawling out here like a lobster!\n\nGoes out. After him Bobchinsky. Curtain falls.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nSCENE: The same as in Act I.\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\nAnna Andreyevna and Marya Antonovna standing at the window in the same\npositions as at the end of Act I.\n\nANNA. There now! We've been waiting a whole hour. All on account of your\nsilly prinking. You were completely dressed, but no, you have to keep\non dawdling.--Provoking! Not a soul to be seen, as though on purpose, as\nthough the whole world were dead.\n\nMARYA. Now really, mamma, we shall know all about it in a minute or two.\nAvdotya must come back soon. [Looks out of the window and exclaims.] Oh,\nmamma, someone is coming--there down the street!\n\nANNA. Where? Just your imagination again!--Why, yes, someone is coming.\nI wonder who it is. A short man in a frock coat. Who can it be? Eh? The\nsuspense is awful! Who can it be, I wonder.\n\nMARYA. Dobchinsky, mamma.\n\nANNA. Dobchinsky! Your imagination again! It's not Dobchinsky at all.\n[Waves her handkerchief.] Ho, you! Come here! Quick!\n\nMARYA. It is Dobchinsky, mamma.\n\nANNA. Of course, you've got to contradict. I tell you, it's not\nDobchinsky.\n\nMARYA. Well, well, mamma? Isn't it Dobchinsky?\n\nANNA. Yes, it is, I see now. Why do you argue about it? [Calls through\nthe window.] Hurry up, quick! You're so slow. Well, where are they?\nWhat? Speak from where you are. It's all the same. What? He is very\nstrict? Eh? And how about my husband? [Moves away a little from the\nwindow, exasperated.] He is so stupid. He won't say a word until he is\nin the room.\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\nEnter Dobchinsky.\n\nANNA. Now tell me, aren't you ashamed? You were the only one I relied\non to act decently. They all ran away and you after them, and till now\nI haven't been able to find out a thing. Aren't you ashamed? I stood\ngodmother to your Vanichka and Lizanko, and this is the way you treat\nme.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Godmother, upon my word, I ran so fast to pay my respects to\nyou that I'm all out of breath. How do you do, Marya Antonovna?\n\nMARYA. Good afternoon, Piotr Ivanovich.\n\nANNA. Well, tell me all about it. What is happening at the inn?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I have a note for you from Anton Antonovich.\n\nANNA. But who is he? A general?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. No, not a general, but every bit as good as a general, I\ntell you. Such culture! Such dignified manners!\n\nANNA. Ah! So he is the same as the one my husband got a letter about.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Exactly. It was Piotr Ivanovich and I who first discovered\nhim.\n\nANNA. Tell me, tell me all about it.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. It's all right now, thank the Lord. At first he received\nAnton Antonovich rather roughly. He was angry and said the inn was not\nrun properly, and he wouldn't come to the Governor's house and he didn't\nwant to go to jail on account of him. But then when he found out\nthat Anton Antonovich was not to blame and they got to talking more\nintimately, he changed right away, and, thank Heaven, everything went\nwell. They've gone now to inspect the philanthropic institutions. I\nconfess that Anton Antonovich had already begun to suspect that a secret\ndenunciation had been lodged against him. I myself was trembling a\nlittle, too.\n\nANNA. What have you to be afraid of? You're not an official.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Well, you see, when a Grand Mogul speaks, you feel afraid.\n\nANNA. That's all rubbish. Tell me, what is he like personally? Is he\nyoung or old?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Young--a young man of about twenty-three. But he talks as\nif he were older. \"If you will allow me,\" he says, \"I will go there\nand there.\" [Waves his hands.] He does it all with such distinction. \"I\nlike,\" he says, \"to read and write, but I am prevented because my room\nis rather dark.\"\n\nANNA. And what sort of a looking man is he, dark or fair?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Neither. I should say rather chestnut. And his eyes dart\nabout like little animals. They make you nervous.\n\nANNA. Let me see what my husband writes. [Reads.] \"I hasten to let you\nknow, dear, that my position was extremely uncomfortable, but relying\non the mercy of God, two pickles extra and a half portion of caviar, one\nruble and twenty-five kopeks.\" [Stops.] I don't understand. What have\npickles and caviar got to do with it?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Oh, Anton Antonovich hurriedly wrote on a piece of scrap\npaper. There's a kind of bill on it.\n\nANNA. Oh, yes, I see. [Goes on reading.] \"But relying on the mercy\nof God, I believe all will turn out well in the end. Get a room ready\nquickly for the distinguished guest--the one with the gold wall paper.\nDon't bother to get any extras for dinner because we'll have something\nat the hospital with Artemy Filippovich. Order a little more wine, and\ntell Abdulin to send the best, or I'll wreck his whole cellar. I kiss\nyour hand, my dearest, and remain yours, Anton Skvoznik-Dmukhanovsky.\"\nOh my! I must hurry. Hello, who's there? Mishka?\n\nDOBCHINSKY [Runs to the door and calls.] Mishka! Mishka! Mishka! [Mishka\nenters.]\n\nANNA. Listen! Run over to Abdulin--wait, I'll give you a note. [She\nsits down at the table and writes, talking all the while.] Give this to\nSidor, the coachman, and tell him to take it to Abdulin and bring back\nthe wine. And get to work at once and make the gold room ready for\na guest. Do it nicely. Put a bed in it, a wash basin and pitcher and\neverything else.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Well, I'm going now, Anna Andreyevna, to see how he does the\ninspecting.\n\nANNA. Go on, I'm not keeping you.\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n\nAnna Andreyevna and Marya Antonovna.\n\nANNA. Now, Mashenka, we must attend to our toilet. He's a metropolitan\nswell and God forbid that he should make fun of us. You put on your blue\ndress with the little flounces. It's the most becoming.\n\nMARYA. The idea, mamma! The blue dress! I can't bear it.\nLiapkin-Tiapkin's wife wears blue and so does Zemlianika's daughter. I'd\nrather wear my flowered dress.\n\nANNA. Your flowered dress! Of course, just to be contrary. You'll look\nlots better in blue because I'm going to wear my dun-colored dress. I\nlove dun-color.\n\nMARYA. Oh, mamma, it isn't a bit becoming to you.\n\nANNA. What, dun-color isn't becoming to me?\n\nMARYA. No, not a bit. I'm positive it isn't. One's eyes must be quite\ndark to go with dun-color.\n\nANNA. That's nice! And aren't my eyes dark? They are as dark as can be.\nWhat nonsense you talk! How can they be anything but dark when I always\ndraw the queen of clubs.\n\nMARYA. Why, mamma, you are more like the queen of hearts.\n\nANNA. Nonsense! Perfect nonsense! I never was a queen of hearts. [She\ngoes out hurriedly with Marya and speaks behind the scenes.] The ideas\nshe gets into her head! Queen of hearts! Heavens! What do you think of\nthat?\n\nAs they go out, a door opens through which Mishka sweeps dirt on to the\nstage. Osip enters from another door with a valise on his head.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n\nMishka and Osip.\n\nOSIP. Where is this to go?\n\nMISHKA. In here, in here.\n\nOSIP. Wait, let me fetch breath first. Lord! What a wretched life! On an\nempty stomach any load seems heavy.\n\nMISHKA. Say, uncle, will the general be here soon?\n\nOSIP. What general?\n\nMISHKA. Your master.\n\nOSIP. My master? What sort of a general is he?\n\nMISHKA. Isn't he a general?\n\nOSIP. Yes, he's a general, only the other way round.\n\nMISHKA. Is that higher or lower than a real general?\n\nOSIP. Higher.\n\nMISHKA. Gee whiz! That's why they are raising such a racket about him\nhere.\n\nOSIP. Look here, young man, I see you're a smart fellow. Get me\nsomething to eat, won't you?\n\nMISHKA. There isn't anything ready yet for the likes of you. You won't\neat plain food. When your master takes his meal, they'll let you have\nthe same as he gets.\n\nOSIP. But have you got any plain stuff?\n\nMISHKA. We have cabbage soup, porridge and pie.\n\nOSIP. That's all right. We'll eat cabbage soup, porridge and pie, we'll\neat everything. Come, help me with the valise. Is there another way to\ngo out there?\n\nMISHKA. Yes.\n\nThey both carry the valise into the next room.\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\nThe Sergeants open both folding doors. Khlestakov enters followed by\nthe Governor, then the Superintendent of Charities, the Inspector of\nSchools, Dobchinsky and Bobchinsky with a plaster on his nose. The\nGovernor points to a piece of paper lying on the floor, and the\nSergeants rush to pick it up, pushing each other in their haste.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Excellent institutions. I like the way you show strangers\neverything in your town. In other towns they didn't show me a thing.\n\nGOVERNOR. In other towns, I venture to observe, the authorities and\nofficials look out for themselves more. Here, I may say, we have no\nother thought than to win the Government's esteem through good order,\nvigilance, and efficiency.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. The lunch was excellent. I've positively overeaten. Do you\nset such a fine table every day?\n\nGOVERNOR. In honor of so agreeable a guest we do.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I like to eat well. That's what a man lives for--to pluck\nthe flowers of pleasure. What was that fish called?\n\nARTEMY [running up to him]. Labardan.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. It was delicious. Where was it we had our lunch? In the\nhospital, wasn't it?\n\nARTEMY. Precisely, in the hospital.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, yes, I remember. There were beds there. The patients\nmust have gotten well. There don't seem to have been many of them.\n\nARTEMY. About ten are left. The rest recovered. The place is so well\nrun, there is such perfect order. It may seem incredible to you, but\never since I've taken over the management, they all recover like flies.\nNo sooner does a patient enter the hospital than he feels better. And\nwe obtain this result not so much by medicaments as by honesty and\norderliness.\n\nGOVERNOR. In this connection may I venture to call your attention to\nwhat a brain-racking job the office of Governor is. There are so many\nmatters he has to give his mind to just in connection with keeping the\ntown clean and repairs and alterations. In a word, it is enough to\nupset the most competent person. But, thank God, all goes well. Another\ngovernor, of course, would look out for his own advantage. But believe\nme, even nights in bed I keep thinking: \"Oh, God, how could I manage\nthings in such a way that the government would observe my devotion to\nduty and be satisfied?\" Whether the government will reward me or not,\nthat of course, lies with them. At least I'll have a clear conscience.\nWhen the whole town is in order, the streets swept clean, the prisoners\nwell kept, and few drunkards--what more do I want? Upon my word, I don't\neven crave honors. Honors, of course, are alluring; but as against the\nhappiness which comes from doing one's duty, they are nothing but dross\nand vanity.\n\nARTEMY [aside]. Oh, the do-nothing, the scoundrel! How he holds forth! I\nwish the Lord had blessed me with such a gift!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That's so. I admit I sometimes like to philosophize, too.\nSometimes it's prose, and sometimes it comes out poetry.\n\nBOBCHINSKY [to Dobchinsky]. How true, how true it all is, Piotr\nIvanovich. His remarks are great. It's evident that he is an educated\nman.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Would you tell me, please, if you have any amusements here,\nany circles where one could have a game of cards?\n\nGOVERNOR [aside]. Ahem! I know what you are aiming at, my boy.\n[Aloud.] God forbid! Why, no one here has even heard of such a thing as\ncard-playing circles. I myself have never touched a card. I don't know\nhow to play. I can never look at cards with indifference, and if I\nhappen to see a king of diamonds or some such thing, I am so disgusted\nI have to spit out. Once I made a house of cards for the children, and\nthen I dreamt of those confounded things the whole night. Heavens! How\ncan people waste their precious time over cards!\n\nLUKA LUKICH [aside]. But he faroed me out of a hundred rubles yesterday,\nthe rascal.\n\nGOVERNOR. I'd rather employ my time for the benefit of the state.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, well, that's rather going too far. It all depends upon\nthe point of view. If, for instance, you pass when you have to treble\nstakes, then of course--No, don't say that a game of cards isn't very\ntempting sometimes.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\nThe above, Anna Andreyevna and Marya Antonovna.\n\nGOVERNOR. Permit me to introduce my family, my wife and daughter.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [bowing]. I am happy, madam, to have the pleasure of meeting\nyou.\n\nANNA. Our pleasure in meeting so distinguished a person is still\ngreater.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [showing off]. Excuse me, madam, on the contrary, my pleasure\nis the greater.\n\nANNA. Impossible. You condescend to say it to compliment me. Won't you\nplease sit down?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Just to stand near you is bliss. But if you insist, I will\nsit down. I am so, so happy to be at your side at last.\n\nANNA. I beg your pardon, but I dare not take all the nice things you\nsay to myself. I suppose you must have found travelling very unpleasant\nafter living in the capital.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Extremely unpleasant. I am accustomed, comprenez-vous, to\nlife in the fashionable world, and suddenly to find myself on the road,\nin dirty inns with dark rooms and rude people--I confess that if it\nwere not for this chance which--[giving Anna a look and showing off]\ncompensated me for everything--\n\nANNA. It must really have been extremely unpleasant for you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. At this moment, however, I find it exceedingly pleasant,\nmadam.\n\nANNA. Oh, I cannot believe it. You do me much honor. I don't deserve it.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why don't you deserve it? You do deserve it, madam.\n\nANNA. I live in a village.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well, after all, a village too has something. It has its\nhills and brooks. Of course it's not to be compared with St. Petersburg.\nAh, St. Petersburg! What a life, to be sure! Maybe you think I am only\na copying clerk. No, I am on a friendly footing with the chief of our\ndepartment. He slaps me on the back. \"Come, brother,\" he says, \"and have\ndinner with me.\" I just drop in the office for a couple of minutes to\nsay this is to be done so, and that is to be done that way. There's a\nrat of a clerk there for copying letters who does nothing but scribble\nall the time--tr, tr--They even wanted to make me a college assessor,\nbut I think to myself, \"What do I want it for?\" And the doorkeeper flies\nafter me on the stairs with the shoe brush. \"Allow me to shine your\nboots for you, Ivan Aleksandrovich,\" he says. [To the Governor.] Why are\nyou standing, gentleman? Please sit down.\n\n          {GOVERNOR. Our rank is such that we can very\n Together { well stand.         {ARTEMY. We don't mind standing.\n          {LUKA. Please don't trouble.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Please sit down without the rank. [The Governor and the rest\nsit down.] I don't like ceremony. On the contrary, I always like to slip\nby unobserved. But it's impossible to conceal oneself, impossible. I\nno sooner show myself in a place than they say, \"There goes Ivan\nAleksandrovich!\" Once I was even taken for the commander-in-chief.\nThe soldiers rushed out of the guard-house and saluted. Afterwards an\nofficer, an intimate acquaintance of mine, said to me: \"Why, old chap,\nwe completely mistook you for the commander-in-chief.\"\n\nANNA. Well, I declare!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I know pretty actresses. I've written a number of\nvaudevilles, you know. I frequently meet literary men. I am on an\nintimate footing with Pushkin. I often say to him: \"Well, Pushkin, old\nboy, how goes it?\" \"So, so, partner,\" he'd reply, \"as usual.\" He's a\ngreat original.\n\nANNA. So you write too? How thrilling it must be to be an author! You\nwrite for the papers also, I suppose?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, for the papers, too. I am the author of a lot of\nworks--The Marriage of Figaro, Robert le Diable, Norma. I don't even\nremember all the names. I did it just by chance. I hadn't meant to\nwrite, but a theatrical manager said, \"Won't you please write something\nfor me?\" I thought to myself: \"All right, why not?\" So I did it all in\none evening, surprised everybody. I am extraordinarily light of thought.\nAll that has appeared under the name of Baron Brambeus was written by\nme, and the The Frigate of Hope and The Moscow Telegraph.\n\nANNA. What! So you are Brambeus?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why, yes. And I revise and whip all their articles into\nshape. Smirdin gives me forty thousand for it.\n\nANNA. I suppose, then, that Yury Miroslavsky is yours too.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, it's mine.\n\nANNA. I guessed at once.\n\nMARYA. But, mamma, it says that it's by Zagoskin.\n\nANNA. There! I knew you'd be contradicting even here.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes, it's so. That was by Zagoskin. But there is another\nYury Miroslavsky which was written by me.\n\nANNA. That's right. I read yours. It's charming.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I admit I live by literature. I have the first house in\nSt. Petersburg. It is well known as the house of Ivan Aleksandrovich.\n[Addressing the company in general.] If any of you should come to St.\nPetersburg, do please call to see me. I give balls, too, you know.\n\nANNA. I can guess the taste and magnificence of those balls.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Immense! For instance, watermelon will be served costing\nseven hundred rubles. The soup comes in the tureen straight from Paris\nby steamer. When the lid is raised, the aroma of the steam is like\nnothing else in the world. And we have formed a circle for playing\nwhist--the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French, the English and the\nGerman Ambassadors and myself. We play so hard we kill ourselves over\nthe cards. There's nothing like it. After it's over I'm so tired I\nrun home up the stairs to the fourth floor and tell the cook, \"Here,\nMarushka, take my coat\"--What am I talking about?--I forgot that I live\non the first floor. One flight up costs me--My foyer before I rise\nin the morning is an interesting spectacle indeed--counts and princes\njostling each other and humming like bees. All you hear is buzz, buzz,\nbuzz. Sometimes the Minister--[The Governor and the rest rise in awe\nfrom their chairs.] Even my mail comes addressed \"Your Excellency.\" And\nonce I even had charge of a department. A strange thing happened. The\nhead of the department went off, disappeared, no one knew where. Of\ncourse there was a lot of talk about how the place would be filled,\nwho would fill it, and all that sort of thing. There were ever so many\ngenerals hungry for the position, and they tried, but they couldn't cope\nwith it. It's too hard. Just on the surface it looks easy enough; but\nwhen you come to examine it closely, it's the devil of a job. When they\nsaw they couldn't manage, they came to me. In an instant the\nstreets were packed full with couriers, nothing but couriers and\ncouriers--thirty-five thousand of them, imagine! Pray, picture the\nsituation to yourself! \"Ivan Aleksandrovich, do come and take the\ndirectorship of the department.\" I admit I was a little embarrassed.\nI came out in my dressing-gown. I wanted to decline, but I thought it\nmight reach the Czar's ears, and, besides, my official record--\"Very\nwell, gentlemen,\" I said, \"I'll accept the position, I'll accept. So be\nit. But mind,\" I said, \"na-na-na, LOOK SHARP is the word with me, LOOK\nSHARP!\" And so it was. When I went through the offices of my department,\nit was a regular earthquake, Everyone trembled and shook like a leaf.\n[The Governor and the rest tremble with fright. Khlestakov works himself\nup more and more as he speaks.] Oh, I don't like to joke. I got all of\nthem thoroughly scared, I tell you. Even the Imperial Council is afraid\nof me. And really, that's the sort I am. I don't spare anybody. I tell\nthem all, \"I know myself, I know myself.\" I am everywhere, everywhere. I\ngo to Court daily. Tomorrow they are going to make me a field-marsh--\n\nHe slips and almost falls, but is respectfully held up by the officials.\n\nGOVERNOR [walks up to him trembling from top to toe and speaking with a\ngreat effort]. Your Ex-ex-ex- KHLESTAKOV [curtly]. What is it?\n\nGOVERNOR. Your Ex-ex-ex- KHLESTAKOV [as before]. I can't make out a\nthing, it's all nonsense.\n\nGOVERNOR. Your Ex-ex--Your 'lency--Your Excellency, wouldn't you like to\nrest a bit? Here's a room and everything you may need.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Nonsense--rest! However, I'm ready for a rest. Your lunch\nwas fine, gentlemen. I am satisfied, I am satisfied. [Declaiming.]\nLabardan! Labardan!\n\nHe goes into the next room followed by the Governor.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\n\n\nThe same without Khlestakov and the Governor.\n\nBOBCHINSKY [to Dobchinsky]. There's a man for you, Piotr Ivanovich.\nThat's what I call a man. I've never in my life been in the presence of\nso important a personage. I almost died of fright. What do you think is\nhis rank, Piotr Ivanovich?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I think he's almost a general.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. And I think a general isn't worth the sole of his boots. But\nif he is a general, then he must be the generalissimo himself. Did you\nhear how he bullies the Imperial Council? Come, let's hurry off to\nAmmos Fiodorovich and Korobkin and tell them about it. Good-by, Anna\nAndreyevna.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Good afternoon, godmother.\n\nBoth go out.\n\nARTEMY. It makes your heart sink and you don't know why. We haven't\neven our uniforms on. Suppose after he wakes up from his nap he goes and\nsends a report about us to St. Petersburg. [He goes out sunk in thought,\nwith the School Inspector, both saying.] Good-by, madam.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII\n\n\nAnna Andreyevna and Marya Antonovna.\n\nANNA. Oh, how charming he is!\n\nMARYA. A perfect dear!\n\nANNA. Such refined manners. You can recognize the big city article at\nonce. How he carries himself, and all that sort of thing! Exquisite! I'm\njust crazy for young men like him. I am in ecstasies--beside myself. He\nliked me very much though. I noticed he kept looking at me all the time.\n\nMARYA. Oh, mamma, he looked at me.\n\nANNA. No more nonsense please. It's out of place now.\n\nMARYA. But really, mamma, he did look at me.\n\nANNA. There you go! For God's sake, don't argue. You mustn't. That's\nenough. What would he be looking at you for? Please tell me, why would\nhe be looking at you?\n\nMARYA. It's true, mamma. He kept looking at me. He looked at me when he\nbegan to speak about literature and he looked at me afterwards, when he\ntold about how he played whist with the ambassadors.\n\nANNA. Well, maybe he looked at you once or twice and might have said to\nhimself, \"Oh, well, I'll give her a look.\"\n\n\n\nSCENE IX\n\n\nThe same and the Governor.\n\nGOVERNOR. Sh-sh!\n\nANNA. What is it?\n\nGOVERNOR. I wish I hadn't given him so much to drink. Suppose even half\nof what he said is true? [Sunk in thought.] How can it not be true? A\nman in his cups is always on the surface. What's in his heart is on his\ntongue. Of course he fibbed a little. No talking is possible without\nsome lying. He plays cards with the ministers and he visits the Court.\nUpon my word the more you think the less you know what's going on in\nyour head. I'm as dizzy as if I were standing in a belfry, or if I were\ngoing to be hanged, the devil take it!\n\nANNA. And I didn't feel the least bit afraid. I simply saw a high-toned,\ncultured man of the world, and his rank and titles didn't make me feel a\nbit queer.\n\nGOVERNOR. Oh, well, you women. To say women and enough's said.\nEverything is froth and bubble to you. All of a sudden you blab out\nwords that don't make the least sense. The worst you'd get would be a\nflogging; but it means ruination to the husband.--Say, my dear, you are\nas familiar with him as if he were another Bobchinsky.\n\nANNA. Leave that to us. Don't bother about that. [Glancing at Marya.] We\nknow a thing or two in that line.\n\nGOVERNOR [to himself]. Oh, what's the good of talking to you! Confound\nit all! I can't get over my fright yet. [Opens the door and calls.]\nMishka, tell the sergeants, Svistunov and Derzhimorda, to come here.\nThey are near the gate. [After a pause of silence.] The world has turned\ninto a queer place. If at least the people were visible so you could see\nthem; but they are such a skinny, thin race. How in the world could\nyou tell what he is? After all you can tell a military man; but when he\nwears a frock-coat, it's like a fly with clipped wings. He kept it up\na long time in the inn, got off a lot of allegories and ambiguities so\nthat you couldn't make out head or tail. Now he's shown himself up at\nlast.--Spouted even more than necessary. It's evident that he's a young\nman.\n\n\n\nSCENE X\n\n\nThe same and Osip. All rush to meet Osip, beckoning to him.\n\nANNA. Come here, my good man.\n\nGOVERNOR. Hush! Tell me, tell me, is he asleep?\n\nOSIP. No, not yet. He's stretching himself a little.\n\nANNA. What's your name?\n\nOSIP. Osip, madam.\n\nGOVERNOR [to his wife and daughter]. That'll do, that'll do. [To Osip.]\nWell, friend, did they give you a good meal?\n\nOSIP. Yes, sir, very good. Thank you kindly.\n\nANNA. Your master has lots of counts and princes visiting him, hasn't\nhe?\n\nOSIP [aside]. What shall I say? Seeing as they've given me such good\nfeed now, I s'pose they'll do even better later. [Aloud.] Yes, counts do\nvisit him.\n\nMARYA. Osip, darling, isn't your master just grand?\n\nANNA. Osip, please tell me, how is he--\n\nGOVERNOR. Do stop now. You just interfere with your silly talk. Well,\nfriend, how--\n\nANNA. What is your master's rank?\n\nOSIP. The usual rank.\n\nGOVERNOR. For God's sake, your stupid questions keep a person from\ngetting down to business. Tell me, friend, what sort of a man is your\nmaster? Is he strict? Does he rag and bully a fellow--you know what I\nmean--does he or doesn't he?\n\nOSIP. Yes, he likes things to be just so. He insists on things being\njust so.\n\nGOVERNOR. I like your face. You must be a fine man, friend. What--?\n\nANNA. Listen, Osip, does your master wear uniform in St. Petersburg?\n\nGOVERNOR. Enough of your tattle now, really. This is a serious matter, a\nmatter of life and death. (To Osip.) Yes, friend, I like you very much.\nIt's rather chilly now and when a man's travelling an extra glass of tea\nor so is rather welcome. So here's a couple of rubles for some tea.\n\nOSIP [taking the money.] Thank you, much obliged to you, sir. God grant\nyou health and long life. You've helped a poor man.\n\nGOVERNOR. That's all right. I'm glad to do it. Now, friend--\n\nANNA. Listen, Osip, what kind of eyes does your master like most?\n\nMARYA. Osip, darling, what a dear nose your master has!\n\nGOVERNOR. Stop now, let me speak. [To Osip.] Tell me, what does your\nmaster care for most? I mean, when he travels what does he like?\n\nOSIP. As for sights, he likes whatever happens to come along. But what\nhe likes most of all is to be received well and entertained well.\n\nGOVERNOR. Entertained well?\n\nOSIP. Yes, for instance, I'm nothing but a serf and yet he sees to it\nthat I should be treated well, too. S'help me God! Say we'd stop at\nsome place and he'd ask, \"Well, Osip, have they treated you well?\" \"No,\nbadly, your Excellency.\" \"Ah,\" he'd say, \"Osip, he's not a good host.\nRemind me when we get home.\" \"Oh, well,\" thinks I to myself [with a wave\nof his hand]. \"I am a simple person. God be with them.\"\n\nGOVERNOR. Very good. You talk sense. I've given you something for tea.\nHere's something for buns, too.\n\nOSIP. You are too kind, your Excellency. [Puts the money in his pocket.]\nI'll sure drink your health, sir.\n\nANNA. Come to me, Osip, and I'll give you some, too.\n\nMARYA. Osip, darling, kiss your master for me.\n\nKhlestakov is heard to give a short cough in the next room.\n\nGOVERNOR. Hush! [Rises on tip-toe. The rest of the conversation in the\nscene is carried on in an undertone.] Don't make a noise, for heaven's\nsake! Go, it's enough.\n\nANNA. Come, Mashenka, I'll tell you something I noticed about our guest\nthat I can't tell you unless we are alone together. [They go out.]\n\nGOVERNOR. Let them talk away. If you went and listened to them, you'd\nwant to stop up your ears. [To Osip.] Well, friend--\n\n\n\nSCENE XI\n\n\nThe same, Derzhimorda and Svistunov.\n\nGOVERNOR. Sh--sh! Bandy-legged bears--thumping their boots on the floor!\nBump, bump as if a thousand pounds were being unloaded from a wagon.\nWhere in the devil have you been knocking about?\n\nDERZHIMORDA. I had your order--\n\nGOVERNOR. Hush! [Puts his hand over Derzhimorda's mouth.] Like a bull\nbellowing. [Mocking him.] \"I had your order--\" Makes a noise like an\nempty barrel. [To Osip.] Go, friend, and get everything ready for your\nmaster. And you two, you stand on the steps and don't you dare budge\nfrom the spot. And don't let any strangers enter the house, especially\nthe merchants. If you let a single one in, I'll--The instant you see\nanybody with a petition, or even without a petition and he looks as if\nhe wanted to present a petition against me, take him by the scruff of\nthe neck, give him a good kick, [shows with his foot] and throw him out.\nDo you hear? Hush--hush!\n\nHe goes out on tiptoe, preceded by the Sergeants.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nSCENE: Same as in Act III.\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\nEnter cautiously, almost on tiptoe, Ammos Fiodorovich, Artemy\nFilippovich, the Postmaster, Luka Lukich, Dobchinsky and Bobchinsky in\nfull dress-uniform.\n\nAMMOS. For God's sake, gentlemen, quick, form your line, and let's have\nmore order. Why, man alive, he goes to Court and rages at the Imperial\nCouncil. Draw up in military line, strictly in military line. You, Piotr\nIvanovich, take your place there, and you, Piotr Ivanovich, stand here.\n[Both the Piotr Ivanoviches run on tiptoe to the places indicated.]\n\nARTEMY. Do as you please, Ammos Fiodorovich, I think we ought to try.\n\nAMMOS. Try what?\n\nARTEMY. It's clear what.\n\nAMMOS. Grease?\n\nARTEMY. Exactly, grease.\n\nAMMOS. It's risky, the deuce take it. He'll fly into a rage at us. He's\na government official, you know. Perhaps it should be given to him in\nthe form of a gift from the nobility for some sort of memorial?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Or, perhaps, tell him some money has been sent here by post\nand we don't know for whom?\n\nARTEMY. You had better look out that he doesn't send you by post a good\nlong ways off. Look here, things of such a nature are not done this way\nin a well-ordered state. What's the use of a whole regiment here? We\nmust present ourselves to him one at a time, and do--what ought to be\ndone, you know--so that eyes do not see and ears do not hear. That's\nthe way things are done in a well-ordered society. You begin it, Ammos\nFiodorovich, you be the first.\n\nAMMOS. You had better go first. The distinguished guest has eaten in\nyour institution.\n\nARTEMY. Then Luka Lukich, as the enlightener of youth, should go first.\n\nLUKA. I can't, I can't, gentlemen. I confess I am so educated that the\nmoment an official a single degree higher than myself speaks to me, my\nheart stands still and I get as tongue-tied as though my tongue were\ncaught in the mud. No, gentlemen, excuse me. Please let me off.\n\nARTEMY. It's you who have got to do it, Ammos Fiodorovich. There's no\none else. Why, every word you utter seems to be issuing from Cicero's\nmouth.\n\nAMMOS. What are you talking about! Cicero! The idea! Just because a man\nsometimes waxes enthusiastic over house dogs or hunting hounds.\n\nALL [pressing him]. No, not over dogs, but the Tower of Babel, too.\nDon't forsake us, Ammos Fiodorovich, help us. Be our Saviour!\n\nAMMOS. Let go of me, gentlemen.\n\nFootsteps and coughing are heard in Khlestakov's room. All hurry to\nthe door, crowding and jostling in their struggle to get out. Some are\nuncomfortably squeezed, and half-suppressed cries are heard.\n\nBOBCHINSKY'S VOICE. Oh, Piotr Ivanovich, you stepped on my foot.\n\nARTEMY. Look out, gentlemen, look out. Give me a chance to atone for my\nsins. You are squeezing me to death.\n\nExclamations of \"Oh! Oh!\" Finally they all push through the door, and\nthe stage is left empty.\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\nEnter Khlestakov, looking sleepy.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [alone]. I seem to have had a fine snooze. Where did they get\nthose mattresses and feather beds from? I even perspired. After the meal\nyesterday they must have slipped something into me that knocked me out.\nI still feel a pounding in my head. I see I can have a good time here.\nI like hospitality, and I must say I like it all the more if people\nentertain me out of a pure heart and not from interested motives. The\nGovernor's daughter is not a bad one at all, and the mother is also a\nwoman you can still--I don't know, but I do like this sort of life.\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n\nKhlestakov and the Judge.\n\nJUDGE [comes in and stops. Talking to himself]. Oh, God, bring me safely\nout of this! How my knees are knocking together! [Drawing himself up\nand holding the sword in his hand. Aloud.] I have the honor to\npresent myself--Judge of the District Court here, College Assessor\nLiapkin-Tiapkin.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Please be seated. So you are the Judge here?\n\nJUDGE. I was elected by the nobility in 1816 and I have served ever\nsince.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Does it pay to be a judge?\n\nJUDGE. After serving three terms I was decorated with the Vladimir of\nthe third class with the approval of the government. [Aside.] I have the\nmoney in my hand and my hand is on fire.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I like the Vladimir. Anna of the third class is not so nice.\n\nJUDGE [slightly extending his balled fist. Aside]. Good God! I don't\nknow where I'm sitting. I feel as though I were on burning coals.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What have you got in your hand there?\n\nAMMOS [getting all mixed up and dropping the bills on the floor].\nNothing.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How so, nothing? I see money has dropped out of it.\n\nAMMOS [shaking all over]. Oh no, oh no, not at all! [Aside.] Oh, Lord!\nNow I'm under arrest and they've brought a wagon to take me.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, it IS money. [Picking it up.]\n\nAMMOS [aside]. It's all over with me. I'm lost! I'm lost!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I tell you what--lend it to me.\n\nAMMOS [eagerly]. Why, of course, of course--with the greatest pleasure.\n[Aside.] Bolder! Bolder! Holy Virgin, stand by me!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I've run out of cash on the road, what with one thing and\nanother, you know. I'll let you have it back as soon as I get to the\nvillage.\n\nAMMOS. Please don't mention it! It is a great honor to have you take it.\nI'll try to deserve it--by putting forth the best of my feeble powers,\nby my zeal and ardor for the government. [Rises from the chair and draws\nhimself up straight with his hands hanging at his sides.] I will not\nventure to disturb you longer with my presence. You don't care to give\nany orders?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What orders?\n\nJUDGE. I mean, would you like to give orders for the district court\nhere?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What for? I have nothing to do with the court now. No,\nnothing. Thank you very much.\n\nAMMOS [bowing and leaving. Aside.]. Now the town is ours.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. The Judge is a fine fellow.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n\nKhlestakov and the Postmaster.\n\nPOSTMASTER [in uniform, sword in hand. Drawing himself up]. I have the\nhonor to present myself--Postmaster, Court Councilor Shpekin.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm glad to meet you. I like pleasant company very much.\nTake a seat. Do you live here all the time?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Yes, sir. Quite so.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I like this little town. Of course, there aren't many\npeople. It's not very lively. But what of it? It isn't the capital.\nIsn't that so--it isn't the capital?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Quite so, quite so.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. It's only in the capital that you find bon-ton and not a lot\nof provincial lubbers. What is your opinion? Isn't that so?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Quite so. [Aside.] He isn't a bit proud. He inquires about\neverything.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. And yet you'll admit that one can live happily in a little\ntown.\n\nPOSTMASTER. Quite so.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. In my opinion what you want is this--you want people to\nrespect you and to love you sincerely. Isn't that so?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Exactly.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm glad you agree with me. Of course, they call me queer.\nBut that's the kind of character I am. [Looking him in the face and\ntalking to himself.] I think I'll ask this postmaster for a loan.\n[Aloud.] A strange accident happened to me and I ran out of cash on the\nroad. Can you lend me three hundred rubles?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Of course. I shall esteem it a piece of great good fortune.\nI am ready to serve you with all my heart.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Thank you very much. I must say, I hate like the devil to\ndeny myself on the road. And why should I? Isn't that so?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Quite so. [Rises, draws himself up, with his sword in his\nhand.] I'll not venture to disturb you any more. Would you care to make\nany remarks about the post office administration?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, nothing.\n\nThe Postmaster bows and goes out.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [lighting a cigar]. It seems to me the Postmaster is a fine\nfellow, too. He's certainly obliging. I like people like that.\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\nKhlestakov and Luka Lukich, who is practically pushed in on the stage.\nA voice behind him is heard saying nearly aloud, \"Don't be\nchickenhearted.\"\n\nLUKA [drawing himself up, trembling, with his hand on his sword]. I\nhave the honor to present myself--School Inspector, Titular Councilor\nKhlopov.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I'm glad to see you. Take a seat, take a seat. Will you have\na cigar? [Offers him a cigar.]\n\nLUKA [to himself, hesitating]. There now! That's something I hadn't\nanticipated. To take or not to take?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Take it, take it. It's a pretty good cigar. Of course not\nwhat you get in St. Petersburg. There I used to smoke twenty-five cent\ncigars. You feel like kissing yourself after having smoked one of them.\nHere, light it. [Hands him a candle.]\n\nLuka Lukich tries to light the cigar shaking all over.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Not that end, the other.\n\nLUKA [drops the cigar from fright, spits and shakes his hands. Aside].\nConfound it! My damned timidity has ruined me!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I see you are not a lover of cigars. I confess smoking is my\nweakness--smoking and the fair sex. Not for the life of me can I remain\nindifferent to the fair sex. How about you? Which do you like more,\nbrunettes or blondes?\n\nLuka Lukich remains silent, at a complete loss what to say.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Tell me frankly, brunettes or blondes?\n\nLUKA. I don't dare to know.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, no, don't evade. I'm bound to know your taste.\n\nLUKA. I venture to report to you--[Aside.] I don't know what I'm saying.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Ah, you don't want to say. I suppose some little brunette or\nother has cast a spell over you. Confess, she has, hasn't she?\n\nLuka Lukich remains silent.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Ah, you're blushing. You see. Why don't you speak?\n\nLUKA. I'm scared, your Hon--High--Ex--[Aside.] Done for! My confounded\ntongue has undone me!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You're scared? There IS something awe-inspiring in my eyes,\nisn't there? At least I know not a single woman can resist them. Isn't\nthat so?\n\nLUKA. Exactly.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. A strange thing happened to me on the road. I ran entirely\nout of cash. Can you lend me three hundred rubles?\n\nLUKA [clutching his pockets. Aside]. A fine business if I haven't got\nthe money! I have! I have! [Takes out the bills and gives them to him,\ntrembling.]\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Thank you very much.\n\nLUKA [drawing himself up, with his hand on his sword]. I will not\nventure to disturb you with my presence any longer.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good-by.\n\nLUKA [dashes out almost at a run, saying aside.] Well, thank the Lord!\nMaybe he won't inspect the schools.\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\nKhlestakov and Artemy Filippovich.\n\nARTEMY [enters and draws himself up, his hand on his sword]. I have the\nhonor to present myself--Superintendent of Charities, Court Councilor\nZemlianika.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Howdeedo? Please sit down.\n\nARTEMY. I had the honor of receiving you and personally conducting you\nthrough the philanthropic institutions committed to my care.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes, I remember. You treated me to a dandy lunch.\n\nARTEMY. I am glad to do all I can in behalf of my country.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I admit, my weakness is a good cuisine.--Tell me, please,\nwon't you--it seems to me you were a little shorter yesterday, weren't\nyou?\n\nARTEMY. Quite possible. [After a pause.] I may say I spare myself no\npains and perform the duties of my office with the utmost zeal. [Draws\nhis chair closer and speaks in a lowered tone.] There's the postmaster,\nfor example, he does absolutely nothing. Everything is in a fearful\nstate of neglect. The mail is held up. Investigate for yourself, if you\nplease, and you will see. The Judge, too, the man who was here just now,\ndoes nothing but hunt hares, and he keeps his dogs in the court\nrooms, and his conduct, if I must confess--and for the benefit of the\nfatherland, I must confess, though he is my relative and friend--his\nconduct is in the highest degree reprehensible. There is a squire here\nby the name of Dobchinsky, whom you were pleased to see. Well, the\nmoment Dobchinsky leaves the house, the Judge is there with Dobchinsky's\nwife. I can swear to it. You just take a look at the children. Not one\nof them resembles Dobchinsky. All of them, even the little girl, are the\nvery image of the Judge.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You don't say so. I never imagined it.\n\nARTEMY. Then take the School Inspector here. I don't know how the\ngovernment could have entrusted him with such an office. He's worse than\na Jacobin freethinker, and he instils such pernicious ideas into the\nminds of the young that I can hardly describe it. Hadn't I better put it\nall down on paper, if you so order?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Very well, why not? I should like it very much. I like to\nkill the weary hours reading something amusing, you know. What is your\nname? I keep forgetting.\n\nARTEMY. Zemlianika.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes, Zemlianika. Tell me, Mr. Zemlianika, have you any\nchildren?\n\nARTEMY. Of course. Five. Two are already grown up.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You don't say! Grown up! And how are they--how are\nthey--a--a?\n\nARTEMY. You mean that you deign to ask what their names are?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, yes, what are their names?\n\nARTEMY. Nikolay, Ivan, Yelizaveta, Marya and Perepetuya.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good.\n\nARTEMY. I don't venture to disturb you any longer with my presence\nand rob you of your time dedicated to the performance of your sacred\nduties---[Bows and makes to go.]\n\nKHLESTAKOV [escorting him]. Not at all. What you told me is all very\nfunny. Call again, please. I like that sort of thing very much. [Turns\nback and reopens the door, calling.] I say, there! What is your----I\nkeep forgetting. What is your first name and your patronymic?\n\nARTEMY. Artemy Filippovich.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Do me a favor, Artemy Filippovich. A curious accident\nhappened to me on the road. I've run entirely out of cash. Have you four\nhundred rubles to lend me?\n\nARTEMY. I have.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That comes in pat. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\n\n\nKhlestakov, Bobchinsky, and Dobchinsky.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. I have the honor to present myself--a resident of this town,\nPiotr, son of Ivan Bobchinsky.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I am Piotr, son of Ivan Dobchinsky, a squire.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes, I've met you before. I believe you fell? How's your\nnose?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. It's all right. Please don't trouble. It's dried up, dried\nup completely.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That's nice. I'm glad it's dried up. [Suddenly and\nabruptly.] Have you any money?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Money? How's that--money?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. A thousand rubles to lend me.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Not so much as that, honest to God I haven't. Have you,\nPiotr Ivanovich?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I haven't got it with me, because my money--I beg to inform\nyou--is deposited in the State Savings Bank.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well, if you haven't a thousand, then a hundred.\n\nBOBCHINSKY [fumbling in his pockets]. Have you a hundred rubles, Piotr\nIvanovich? All I have is forty.\n\nDOBCHINSKY [examining his pocket-book]. I have only twenty-five.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Look harder, Piotr Ivanovich. I know you have a hole in your\npocket, and the money must have dropped down into it somehow.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. No, honestly, there isn't any in the hole either.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Well, never mind. I merely mentioned the matter. Sixty-five\nwill do. [Takes the money.]\n\nDOBCHINSKY. May I venture to ask a favor of you concerning a very\ndelicate matter?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What is it?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. It's a matter of an extremely delicate nature. My oldest\nson--I beg to inform you--was born before I was married.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Indeed?\n\nDOBCHINSKY. That is, only in a sort of way. He is really my son, just\nas if he had been born in wedlock. I made up everything afterwards,\nset everything right, as it should be, with the bonds of matrimony,\nyou know. Now, I venture to inform you, I should like to have him\naltogether--that is, I should like him to be altogether my legitimate\nson and be called Dobchinsky the same as I.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That's all right. Let him be called Dobchinsky. That's\npossible.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I shouldn't have troubled you; but it's a pity, he is such\na talented youngster. He gives the greatest promise. He can recite\ndifferent poems by heart; and whenever he gets hold of a penknife,\nhe makes little carriages as skilfully as a conjurer. Here's Piotr\nIvanovich. He knows. Am I not right?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Yes, the lad is very talented.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. All right, all right. I'll try to do it for you. I'll speak\nto--I hope--it'll be done, it'll all be done. Yes, yes. [Turning to\nBobchinsky.] Have you anything you'd like to say to me?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Why, of course. I have a most humble request to make.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What is it?\n\nBOBCHINSKY. I beg your Highness or your Excellency most worshipfully,\nwhen you get back to St. Petersburg, please tell all the high personages\nthere, the senators and the admirals, that Piotr Ivanovich Bobchinsky\nlives in this town. Say this: \"Piotr Ivanovich lives there.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Very well.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. And if you should happen to speak to the Czar, then tell\nhim, too: \"Your Majesty,\" tell him, \"Your Majesty, Piotr Ivanovich\nBobchinsky lives in this town.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Very well.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Pardon me for having troubled you with my presence.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Not at all, not at all. It was my pleasure. [Sees them to\nthe door.]\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII\n\n\nKHLESTAKOV [alone]. My, there are a lot of officials here. They seem to\nbe taking me for a government functionary. To be sure, I threw dust in\ntheir eyes yesterday. What a bunch of fools! I'll write all about it to\nTriapichkin in St. Petersburg. He'll write them up in the papers. Let\nhim give them a nice walloping.--Ho, Osip, give me paper and ink.\n\nOSIP [looking in at the door]. D'rectly.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Anybody gets caught in Triapichkin's tongue had better look\nout. For the sake of a witticism he wouldn't spare his own father. They\nare good people though, these officials. It's a nice trait of theirs to\nlend me money. I'll just see how much it all mounts up to. Here's\nthree hundred from the Judge and three hundred from the Postmaster--six\nhundred, seven hundred, eight hundred--What a greasy bill!--Eight\nhundred, nine hundred.--Oho! Rolls up to more than a thousand! Now, if I\nget you, captain, now! We'll see who'll do whom!\n\n\n\nSCENE IX\n\n\nKhlestakov and Osip entering with paper and ink.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Now, you simpleton, you see how they receive and treat me.\n[Begins to write.]\n\nOSIP. Yes, thank God! But do you know what, Ivan Aleksandrovich?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What?\n\nOSIP. Leave this place. Upon my word, it's time.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [writing]. What nonsense! Why?\n\nOSIP. Just so. God be with them. You've had a good time here for two\ndays. It's enough. What's the use of having anything more to do with\nthem? Spit on them. You don't know what may happen. Somebody else may\nturn up. Upon my word, Ivan Aleksandrovich. And the horses here are\nfine. We'll gallop away like a breeze.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [writing]. No, I'd like to stay a little longer. Let's go\ntomorrow.\n\nOSIP. Why tomorrow? Let's go now, Ivan Aleksandrovich, now, 'pon my\nword. To be sure, it's a great honor and all that. But really we'd\nbetter go as quick as we can. You see, they've taken you for somebody\nelse, honest. And your dad will be angry because you dilly-dallied so\nlong. We'd gallop off so smartly. They'd give us first-class horses\nhere.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [writing]. All right. But first take this letter to the\npostoffice, and, if you like, order post horses at the same time. Tell\nthe postilions that they should drive like couriers and sing songs, and\nI'll give them a ruble each. [Continues to write.] I wager Triapichkin\nwill die laughing.\n\nOSIP. I'll send the letter off by the man here. I'd rather be packing in\nthe meanwhile so as to lose no time.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. All right. Bring me a candle.\n\nOSIP [outside the door, where he is heard speaking]. Say, partner, go to\nthe post office and mail a letter, and tell the postmaster to frank it.\nAnd have a coach sent round at once, the very best courier coach; and\ntell them the master doesn't pay fare. He travels at the expense of the\ngovernment. And make them hurry, or else the master will be angry. Wait,\nthe letter isn't ready yet.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I wonder where he lives now, on Pochtamtskaya or Grokhovaya\nStreet. He likes to move often, too, to get out of paying rent. I'll\nmake a guess and send it to Pochtamtskaya Street. [Folds the letter and\naddresses it.]\n\nOsip brings the candle. Khlestakov seals the letter with sealing wax. At\nthat moment Derzhimorda's voice is heard saying: \"Where are you going,\nwhiskers? You've been told that nobody is allowed to come in.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV [giving the letter to Osip]. There, have it mailed.\n\nMERCHANT'S VOICE. Let us in, brother. You have no right to keep us out.\nWe have come on business.\n\nDERZHIMORDA'S VOICE. Get out of here, get out of here! He doesn't\nreceive anybody. He's asleep.\n\nThe disturbance outside grows louder.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What's the matter there, Osip? See what the noise is about.\n\nOSIP [looking through the window]. There are some merchants there\nwho want to come in, and the sergeant won't let them. They are waving\npapers. I suppose they want to see you.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [going to the window]. What is it, friends?\n\nMERCHANT'S VOICE. We appeal for your protection. Give orders, your\nLordship, that our petitions be received.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Let them in, let them in. Osip, tell them to come in.\n\nOsip goes out.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [takes the petitions through the window, unfolds one of them\nand reads]. \"To his most honorable, illustrious financial Excellency,\nfrom the merchant Abdulin....\" The devil knows what this is! There's no\nsuch title.\n\n\n\nSCENE X\n\n\nKhlestakov and Merchants, with a basket of wine and sugar loaves.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What is it, friends?\n\nMERCHANTS. We beseech your favor.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What do you want?\n\nMERCHANTS. Don't ruin us, your Worship. We suffer insult and wrong\nwholly without cause.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. From whom?\n\nA MERCHANT. Why, from our governor here. Such a governor there never was\nyet in the world, your Worship. No words can describe the injuries he\ninflicts upon us. He has taken the bread out of our mouths by quartering\nsoldiers on us, so that you might as well put your neck in a noose.\nHe doesn't treat you as you deserve. He catches hold of your beard\nand says, \"Oh, you Tartar!\" Upon my word, if we had shown him any\ndisrespect, but we obey all the laws and regulations. We don't mind\ngiving him what his wife and daughter need for their clothes, but\nno, that's not enough. So help me God! He comes to our shop and takes\nwhatever his eyes fall on. He sees a piece of cloth and says, \"Oh, my\nfriends, that's a fine piece of goods. Take it to my house.\" So we take\nit to his house. It will be almost forty yards.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Is it possible? My, what a swindler!\n\nMERCHANTS. So help us God! No one remembers a governor like him. When\nyou see him coming you hide everything in the shop. It isn't only that\nhe wants a few delicacies and fineries. He takes every bit of trash,\ntoo--prunes that have been in the barrel seven years and that even the\nboy in my shop would not eat, and he grabs a fist full. His name day is\nSt. Anthony's, and you'd think there's nothing else left in the world to\nbring him and that he doesn't want any more. But no, you must give him\nmore. He says St. Onufry's is also his name day. What's to be done? You\nhave to take things to him on St. Onufry's day, too.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why, he's a plain robber.\n\nMERCHANTS. Yes, indeed! And try to contradict him, and he'll fill your\nhouse with a whole regiment of soldiers. And if you say anything, he\norders the doors closed. \"I won't inflict corporal punishment on you,\"\nhe says, \"or put you in the rack. That's forbidden by law,\" he says.\n\"But I'll make you swallow salt herring, my good man.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What a swindler! For such things a man can be sent to\nSiberia.\n\nMERCHANTS. It doesn't matter where you are pleased to send him. Only the\nfarthest away from here the better. Father, don't scorn to accept our\nbread and salt. We pay our respects to you with sugar and a basket of\nwine.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, no. Don't think of it. I don't take bribes. Oh, if, for\nexample, you would offer me a loan of three hundred rubles, that's quite\ndifferent. I am willing to take a loan.\n\nMERCHANTS. If you please, father. [They take out money.] But what is\nthree hundred? Better take five hundred. Only help us.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Very well. About a loan I won't say a word. I'll take it.\n\nMERCHANTS [proffering him the money on a silver tray]. Do please take\nthe tray, too.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Very well. I can take the tray, too.\n\nMERCHANTS [bowing]. Then take the sugar at the same time.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, no. I take no bribes.\n\nOSIP. Why don't you take the sugar, your Highness? Take it. Everything\nwill come in handy on the road. Give here the sugar and that case. Give\nthem here. It'll all be of use. What have you got there--a string?\nGive it here. A string will be handy on the road, too, if the coach or\nsomething else should break--for tying it up.\n\nMERCHANTS. Do us this great favor, your illustrious Highness. Why, if\nyou don't help us in our appeal to you, then we simply don't know how we\nare to exist. We might as well put our necks in a noose.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Positively, positively. I shall exert my efforts in your\nbehalf.\n\n[The Merchants leave. A woman's voice is heard saying:]\n\n\"Don't you dare not to let me in. I'll make a complaint against you to\nhim himself. Don't push me that way. It hurts.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Who is there? [Goes to the window.] What is it, mother?\n\n[Two women's voices are heard:] \"We beseech your grace, father. Give\norders, your Lordship, for us to be heard.\"\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Let her in.\n\n\n\nSCENE XI\n\n\nKhlestakov, the Locksmith's Wife, and the non-commissioned Officer's\nWidow.\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE [kneeling]. I beseech your grace.\n\nWIDOW. I beseech your grace.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Who are you?\n\nWIDOW. Ivanova, widow of a non-commissioned officer.\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE. Fevronya Petrova Poshliopkina, the wife of a locksmith, a\nburgess of this town. My father--\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Stop! One at a time. What do you want?\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE. I beg for your grace. I beseech your aid against the\ngovernor. May God send all evil upon him. May neither he nor his\nchildren nor his uncles nor his aunts ever prosper in any of their\nundertakings.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What's the matter?\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE. He ordered my husband to shave his forehead as a soldier,\nand our turn hadn't come, and it is against the law, my husband being a\nmarried man.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How could he do it, then?\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE. He did it, he did it, the blackguard! May God smite him\nboth in this world and the next. If he has an aunt, may all harm descend\nupon her. And if his father is living, may the rascal perish, may he\nchoke to death. Such a cheat! The son of the tailor should have been\nlevied. And he is a drunkard, too. But his parents gave the governor a\nrich present, so he fastened on the son of the tradeswoman, Panteleyeva.\nAnd Panteleyeva also sent his wife three pieces of linen. So then he\ncomes to me. \"What do you want your husband for?\" he says. \"He isn't\nany good to you any more.\" It's for me to know whether he is any good\nor not. That's my business. The old cheat! \"He's a thief,\" he says.\n\"Although he hasn't stolen anything, that doesn't matter. He is going to\nsteal. And he'll be recruited next year anyway.\" How can I do without\na husband? I am not a strong woman. The skunk! May none of his kith and\nkin ever see the light of God. And if he has a mother-in-law, may she,\ntoo,--\n\nKHLESTAKOV. All right, all right. Well, and you?\n\n[Addressing the Widow and leading the Locksmith's Wife to the door.]\n\nLOCK.'S WIFE [leaving]. Don't forget, father. Be kind and gracious to\nme.\n\nWIDOW. I have come to complain against the Governor, father.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What is it? What for? Be brief.\n\nWIDOW. He flogged me, father.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. How so?\n\nWIDOW. By mistake, my father. Our women got into a squabble in the\nmarket, and when the police came, it was all over, and they took me and\nreported me--I couldn't sit down for two days.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. But what's to be done now?\n\nWIDOW. There's nothing to be done, of course. But if you please, order\nhim to pay a fine for the mistake. I can't undo my luck. But the money\nwould be very useful to me now.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. All right, all right. Go now, go. I'll see to it. [Hands\nwith petitions are thrust through the window.] Who else is out there?\n[Goes to the window.] No, no. I don't want to, I don't want to. [Leaves\nthe window.] I'm sick of it, the devil take it! Don't let them in, Osip.\n\nOSIP [calling through the window]. Go away, go away! He has no time.\nCome tomorrow.\n\nThe door opens and a figure appears in a shag cloak, with unshaven\nbeard, swollen lip, and a bandage over his cheek. Behind him appear a\nwhole line of others.\n\nOSIP. Go away, go away! What are you crowding in here for?\n\nHe puts his hands against the stomach of the first one, and goes out\nthrough the door, pushing him and banging the door behind.\n\n\n\nSCENE XII\n\n\nKhlestakov and Marya Antonovna.\n\nMARYA. Oh!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What frightened you so, mademoiselle?\n\nMARYA. I wasn't frightened.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [showing off]. Please, miss. It's a great pleasure to me\nthat you took me for a man who--May I venture to ask you where you were\ngoing?\n\nMARYA. I really wasn't going anywhere.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. But why weren't you going anywhere?\n\nMARYA. I was wondering whether mamma was here.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No. I'd like to know why you weren't going anywhere.\n\nMARYA. I should have been in your way. You were occupied with important\nmatters.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [showing off]. Your eyes are better than important matters.\nYou cannot possibly disturb me. No, indeed, by no means. On the\ncontrary, you afford me great pleasure.\n\nMARYA. You speak like a man from the capital.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. For such a beautiful lady as you. May I give myself the\npleasure of offering you a chair? But no, you should have, not a chair,\nbut a throne.\n\nMARYA. I really don't know--I really must go [She sits down.]\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What a beautiful scarf that is.\n\nMARYA. You are making fun of me. You're only ridiculing the provincials.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, mademoiselle, how I long to be your scarf, so that I\nmight embrace your lily neck.\n\nMARYA. I haven't the least idea what you are talking\nabout--scarf!--Peculiar weather today, isn't it?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Your lips, mademoiselle, are better than any weather.\n\nMARYA. You are just saying that--I should like to ask you--I'd rather\nyou would write some verses in my album for a souvenir. You must know\nvery many.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Anything you desire, mademoiselle. Ask! What verses will you\nhave?\n\nMARYA. Any at all. Pretty, new verses.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, what are verses! I know a lot of them.\n\nMARYA. Well, tell me. What verses will you write for me?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What's the use? I know them anyway.\n\nMARYA. I love them so.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I have lots of them--of every sort. If you like, for\nexample, I'll give you this: \"Oh, thou, mortal man, who in thy anguish\nmurmurest against God--\" and others. I can't remember them now. Besides,\nit's all bosh. I'd rather offer you my love instead, which ever since\nyour first glance--[Moves his chair nearer.]\n\nMARYA. Love? I don't understand love. I never knew what love is. [Moves\nher chair away.]\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Why do you move your chair away? It is better for us to sit\nnear each other.\n\nMARYA [moving away]. Why near? It's all the same if it's far away.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [moving nearer]. Why far? It's all the same if it's near.\n\nMARYA [moving away]. But what for?\n\nKHLESTAKOV [moving nearer]. It only seems near to you. Imagine it's far.\nHow happy I would be, mademoiselle, if I could clasp you in my embrace.\n\nMARYA [looking through the window]. What is that? It looked as if\nsomething had flown by. Was it a magpie or some other bird?\n\nKHLESTAKOV [kisses her shoulder and looks through the window]. It's a\nmagpie.\n\nMARYA [rises indignantly]. No, that's too much--Such rudeness, such\nimpertinence.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [holding her back]. Forgive me, mademoiselle. I did it only\nout of love--only out of love, nothing else.\n\nMARYA. You take me for a silly provincial wench. [Struggles to go away.]\n\nKHLESTAKOV [still holding her back]. It's out of love, really--out of\nlove. It was just a little fun. Marya Antonovna, don't be angry. I'm\nready to beg your forgiveness on my knees. [Falls on his knees.] Forgive\nme, do forgive me! You see, I am on my knees.\n\n\n\nSCENE XIII\n\n\nThe same and Anna Andreyevna.\n\nANNA [seeing Khlestakov on his knees]. Oh, what a situation!\n\nKHLESTAKOV [rising]. Oh, the devil!\n\nANNA [to Marya]. What does this mean? What does this behavior mean?\n\nMARYA. I, mother--\n\nANNA. Go away from here. Do you hear? And don't you dare to show your\nface to me. [Marya goes out in tears.] Excuse me. I must say I'm greatly\nastonished.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [aside]. She's very appetizing, too. She's not bad-looking,\neither. [Flings himself on his knees.] Madam, you see I am burning with\nlove.\n\nANNA. What! You on your knees? Please get up, please get up. This floor\nisn't very clean.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, I must be on my knees before you. I must. Pronounce the\nverdict. Is it life or death?\n\nANNA. But please--I don't quite understand the significance of your\nwords. If I am not mistaken, you are making a proposal for my daughter.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, I am in love with you. My life hangs by a thread. If you\ndon't crown my steadfast love, then I am not fit to exist in this world.\nWith a burning flame in my bosom, I pray for your hand.\n\nANNA. But please remember I am in a certain way--married.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. That's nothing. Love knows no distinction. It was Karamzin\nwho said: \"The laws condemn.\" We will fly in the shadow of a brook. Your\nhand! I pray for your hand!\n\n\n\nSCENE XIV\n\n\nThe same and Marya Antonovna.\n\nMARYA [running in suddenly]. Mamma, papa says you should--[seeing\nKhlestakov on his knees, exclaims:] Oh, what a situation!\n\nANNA. Well, what do you want? Why did you come in here? What for? What\nsort of flightiness is this? Breaks in like a cat leaping out of smoke.\nWell, what have you found so wonderful? What's gotten into your head\nagain? Really, she behaves like a child of three. She doesn't act a bit\nlike a girl of eighteen, not a bit. I don't know when you'll get more\nsense into your head, when you'll behave like a decent, well-bred girl,\nwhen you'll know what good manners are and a proper demeanor.\n\nMARYA [through her tears]. Mamma, I really didn't know--\n\nANNA. There's always a breeze blowing through your head. You act like\nLiapkin-Tiapkin's daughter. Why should you imitate them? You shouldn't\nimitate them. You have other examples to follow. You have your mother\nbefore you. She's the example to follow.\n\nKHLESTAKOV [seizing Marya's hand]. Anna Andreyevna, don't oppose our\nhappiness. Give your blessing to our constant love.\n\nANNA [in surprise]. So it's in her you are--\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Decide--life or death?\n\nANNA. Well, there, you fool, you see? Our guest is pleased to go down on\nhis knees for such trash as you. You, running in suddenly as if you\nwere out of your mind. Really, it would be just what you deserve, if I\nrefused. You are not worthy of such happiness.\n\nMARYA. I won't do it again, mamma, really I won't.\n\n\n\nSCENE XV\n\n\nThe same and the Governor in precipitate haste.\n\nGOVERNOR. Your Excellency, don't ruin me, don't ruin me.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. What's the matter?\n\nGOVERNOR. The merchants have complained to your Excellency. I assure you\non my honor that not one half of what they said is so. They themselves\nare cheats. They give short measure and short weight. The officer's\nwidow lied to you when she said I flogged her. She lied, upon my word,\nshe lied. She flogged herself.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. The devil take the officer's widow. What do I care about the\nofficer's widow.\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't believe them, don't believe them. They are rank liars; a\nmere child wouldn't believe them. They are known all over town as liars.\nAnd as for cheating, I venture to inform you that there are no swindlers\nlike them in the whole of creation.\n\nANNA. Do you know what honor Ivan Aleksandrovich is bestowing upon us?\nHe is asking for our daughter's hand.\n\nGOVERNOR. What are you talking about? Mother has lost her wits. Please\ndo not be angry, your Excellency. She has a touch of insanity. Her\nmother was like that, too.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, I am really asking for your daughter's hand. I am in\nlove with her.\n\nGOVERNOR. I cannot believe it, your Excellency.\n\nANNA. But when you are told!\n\nKHLESTAKOV. I am not joking. I could go crazy, I am so in love.\n\nGOVERNOR. I daren't believe it. I am unworthy of such an honor.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. If you don't consent to give me your daughter Marya\nAntonovna's hand, then I am ready to do the devil knows what.\n\nGOVERNOR. I cannot believe it. You deign to joke, your Excellency.\n\nANNA. My, what a blockhead! Really! When you are told over and over\nagain!\n\nGOVERNOR. I can't believe it.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Give her to me, give her to me! I am a desperate man and\nI may do anything. If I shoot myself, you will have a law-suit on your\nhands.\n\nGOVERNOR. Oh, my God! I am not guilty either in thought or in action.\nPlease do not be angry. Be pleased to act as your mercy wills. Really,\nmy head is in such a state I don't know what is happening. I have turned\ninto a worse fool than I've ever been in my life.\n\nANNA. Well, give your blessing.\n\nKhlestakov goes up to Marya Antonovna.\n\nGOVERNOR. May God bless you, but I am not guilty. [Khlestakov kisses\nMarya. The Governor looks at them.] What the devil! It's really so.\n[Rubs his eyes.] They are kissing. Oh, heavens! They are kissing.\nActually to be our son-in-law! [Cries out, jumping with glee.] Ho,\nAnton! Ho, Anton! Ho, Governor! So that's the turn events have taken!\n\n\n\nSCENE XVI\n\n\nThe same and Osip.\n\nOSIP. The horses are ready.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh! All right. I'll come presently.\n\nGOVERNOR. What's that? Are you leaving?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, I'm going.\n\nGOVERNOR. Then when--that is--I thought you were pleased to hint at a\nwedding.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh--for one minute only--for one day--to my uncle, a rich\nold man. I'll be back tomorrow.\n\nGOVERNOR. We would not venture, of course, to hold you back, and we hope\nfor your safe return.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Of course, of course, I'll come back at once. Good-by, my\ndear--no, I simply can't express my feelings. Good-by, my heart. [Kisses\nMarya's hand.]\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't you need something for the road? It seems to me you were\npleased to be short of cash.\n\nKHLESTAKOV, Oh, no, what for? [After a little thought.] However, if you\nlike.\n\nGOVERNOR. How much will you have?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. You gave me two hundred then, that is, not two hundred, but\nfour hundred--I don't want to take advantage of your mistake--you might\nlet me have the same now so that it should be an even eight hundred.\n\nGOVERNOR. Very well. [Takes the money out of his pocket-book.] The notes\nhappen to be brand-new, too, as though on purpose.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Oh, yes. [Takes the bills and looks at them.] That's good.\nThey say new money means good luck.\n\nGOVERNOR. Quite right.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good-by, Anton Antonovich. I am very much obliged to you for\nyour hospitality. I admit with all my heart that I have never got such\na good reception anywhere. Good-by, Anna Andreyevna. Good-by, my\nsweet-heart, Marya Antonovna.\n\nAll go out.\n\nBehind the Scenes.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good-by, angel of my soul, Marya Antonovna.\n\nGOVERNOR. What's that? You are going in a plain mail-coach?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Yes, I'm used to it. I get a headache from a carriage with\nsprings.\n\nPOSTILION. Ho!\n\nGOVERNOR. Take a rug for the seat at least. If you say so, I'll tell\nthem to bring a rug.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. No, what for? It's not necessary. However, let them bring a\nrug if you please.\n\nGOVERNOR. Ho, Avdotya. Go to the store-room and bring the very best rug\nfrom there, the Persian rug with the blue ground. Quick!\n\nPOSTILION. Ho!\n\nGOVERNOR. When do you say we are to expect you back?\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Tomorrow, or the day after.\n\nOSIP. Is this the rug? Give it here. Put it there. Now put some hay on\nthis side.\n\nPOSTILION. Ho!\n\nOSIP. Here, on this side. More. All right. That will be fine. [Beats the\nrug down with his hand.] Now take the seat, your Excellency.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good-by, Anton Antonovich.\n\nGOVERNOR. Good-by, your Excellency.\n\nANNA } MARYA} Good-by, Ivan Aleksandrovich.\n\nKHLESTAKOV. Good-by, mother.\n\nPOSTILION. Get up, my boys!\n\nThe bell rings and the curtain drops.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n\nSCENE: Same as in Act IV.\n\n\n\nSCENE I\n\n\nGovernor, Anna Andreyevna, and Marya Antonovna.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, Anna Andreyevna, eh? Did you ever imagine such a thing?\nSuch a rich prize? I'll be--. Well, confess frankly, it never occurred\nto you even in your dreams, did it? From just a simple governor's wife\nsuddenly--whew!--I'll be hanged!--to marry into the family of such a big\ngun.\n\nANNA. Not at all. I knew it long ago. It seems wonderful to you because\nyou are so plain. You never saw decent people.\n\nGOVERNOR. I'm a decent person myself, mother. But, really, think, Anna\nAndreyevna, what gay birds we have turned into now, you and I. Eh, Anna\nAndreyevna? High fliers, by Jove! Wait now, I'll give those fellows who\nwere so eager to present their petitions and denunciations a peppering.\nHo, who's there? [Enter a Sergeant.] Is it you, Ivan Karpovich? Call\nthose merchants here, brother, won't you? I'll give it to them, the\nscoundrels! To make such complaints against me! The damned pack of Jews!\nWait, my dear fellows. I used to dose you down to your ears. Now I'll\ndose you down to your beards. Make a list of all who came to protest\nagainst me, especially the mean petty scribblers who cooked the\npetitions up for them, and announce to all that they should know what\nhonor the Heavens have bestowed upon the Governor, namely this: that he\nis marrying his daughter, not to a plain ordinary man, but to one the\nlike of whom has never yet been in the world, who can do everything,\neverything, everything, everything! Proclaim it to all so that everybody\nshould know. Shout it aloud to the whole world. Ring the bell, the devil\ntake it! It is a triumph, and we will make it a triumph. [The Sergeant\ngoes out.] So that's the way, Anna Andreyevna, eh? What shall we do now?\nWhere shall we live? Here or in St. Pete?\n\nANNA. In St. Petersburg, of course. How could we remain here?\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, if St. Pete, then St. Pete. But it would be good here,\ntoo. I suppose the governorship could then go to the devil, eh, Anna\nAndreyevna?\n\nANNA. Of course. What's a governorship?\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't you think, Anna Andreyevna, I can rise to a high rank\nnow, he being hand in glove with all the ministers, and visiting the\ncourt? In time I can be promoted to a generalship. What do you think,\nAnna Andreyevna? Can I become a general?\n\nANNA. I should say so. Of course you can.\n\nGOVERNOR. Ah, the devil take it, it's nice to be a general. They hang a\nribbon across your shoulders. What ribbon is better, the red St. Anne or\nthe blue St. Andrew?\n\nANNA. The blue St. Andrew, of course.\n\nGOVERNOR. What! My, you're aiming high. The red one is good, too. Why\ndoes one want to be a general? Because when you go travelling, there are\nalways couriers and aides on ahead with \"Horses\"! And at the stations\nthey refuse to give the horses to others. They all wait, all those\ncouncilors, captains, governors, and you don't take the slightest\nnotice of them. You dine somewhere with the governor-general. And the\ntown-governor--I'll keep him waiting at the door. Ha, ha, ha! [He bursts\ninto a roar of laughter, shaking all over.] That's what's so alluring,\nconfound it!\n\nANNA. You always like such coarse things. You must remember that our\nlife will have to be completely changed, that your acquaintances will\nnot be a dog-lover of a judge, with whom you go hunting hares, or a\nZemlianika. On the contrary, your acquaintances will be people of the\nmost refined type, counts, and society aristocrats. Only really I am\nafraid of you. You sometimes use words that one never hears in good\nsociety.\n\nGOVERNOR. What of it? A word doesn't hurt.\n\nANNA. It's all right when you are a town-governor, but there the life is\nentirely different.\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, they say there are two kinds of fish there, the sea-eel\nand the smelt, and before you start to eat them, the saliva flows in\nyour mouth.\n\nANNA. That's all he thinks about--fish. I shall insist upon our house\nbeing the first in the capital and my room having so much amber in it\nthat when you come in you have to shut your eyes. [She shuts her eyes\nand sniffs.] Oh, how good!\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n\nThe same and the Merchants.\n\nGOVERNOR. Ah, how do you do, my fine fellows?\n\nMERCHANTS [bowing]. We wish you health, father.\n\nGOVERNOR. Well, my dearly beloved friends, how are you? How are your\ngoods selling? So you complained against me, did you, you tea tanks, you\nscurvy hucksters? Complain, against me? You crooks, you pirates, you.\nDid you gain a lot by it, eh? Aha, you thought you'd land me in prison?\nMay seven devils and one she-devil take you! Do you know that--\n\nANNA. Good heavens, Antosha, what words you use!\n\nGOVERNOR [irritated]. Oh, it isn't a matter of words now. Do you know\nthat the very official to whom you complained is going to marry my\ndaughter? Well, what do you say to that? Now I'll make you smart. You\ncheat the people, you make a contract with the government, and you\ndo the government out of a hundred thousand, supplying it with rotten\ncloth; and when you give fifteen yards away gratis, you expect a reward\nbesides. If they knew, they would send you to--And you strut about\nsticking out your paunches with a great air of importance: \"I'm a\nmerchant, don't touch me.\" \"We,\" you say, \"are as good as the nobility.\"\nYes, the nobility, you monkey-faces. The nobleman is educated. If he\ngets flogged in school, it is for a purpose, to learn something useful.\nAnd you--start out in life learning trickery. Your master beats you for\nnot being able to cheat. When you are still little boys and don't know\nthe Lord's Prayer, you already give short measure and short weight. And\nwhen your bellies swell and your pockets fill up, then you assume an air\nof importance. Whew! What marvels! Because you guzzle sixteen samovars\nfull a day, that's why you put on an air of importance. I spit on your\nheads and on your importance.\n\nMERCHANTS [bowing]. We are guilty, Anton Antonovich.\n\nGOVERNOR. Complaining, eh? And who helped you with that grafting when\nyou built a bridge and charged twenty thousand for wood when there\nwasn't even a hundred rubles' worth used? I did. You goat beards. Have\nyou forgotten? If I had informed on you, I could have despatched you to\nSiberia. What do you say to that?\n\nA MERCHANT. I'm guilty before God, Anton Antonovich. The evil spirit\ntempted me. We will never complain against you again. Ask whatever\nsatisfaction you want, only don't be angry.\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't be angry! Now you are crawling at my feet. Why? Because\nI am on top now. But if the balance dipped the least bit your way, then\nyou would trample me in the very dirt--you scoundrels! And you would\ncrush me under a beam besides.\n\nMERCHANTS [prostrating themselves]. Don't ruin us, Anton Antonovich.\n\nGOVERNOR. Don't ruin us! Now you say, don't ruin us! And what did you\nsay before? I could give you--[shrugging his shoulders and throwing up\nhis hands.] Well, God forgive you. Enough. I don't harbor malice for\nlong. Only look out now. Be on your guard. My daughter is going to\nmarry, not an ordinary nobleman. Let your congratulations be--you\nunderstand? Don't try to get away with a dried sturgeon or a loaf of\nsugar. Well, leave now, in God's name.\n\nMerchants leave.\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\n\nThe same, Ammos Fiodorovich, Artemy Filippovich, then Rastakovsky.\n\nAMMOS [in the doorway]. Are we to believe the report, Anton Antonovich?\nA most extraordinary piece of good fortune has befallen you, hasn't it?\n\nARTEMY. I have the honor to congratulate you on your unusual good\nfortune. I was glad from the bottom of my heart when I heard it. [Kisses\nAnna's hand.] Anna Andreyevna! [Kissing Marya's hand.] Marya Antonovna!\n\nRastakovsky enters.\n\nRASTAKOVSKY. I congratulate you, Anton Antonovich. May God give you\nand the new couple long life and may He grant you numerous\nprogeny--grand-children and great-grand-children. Anna Andreyevna!\n[Kissing her hand.] Marya Antonovna! [Kissing her hand.]\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\n\nThe same, Korobkin and his Wife, Liuliukov.\n\nKOROBKIN. I have the honor to congratulate you, Anton Antonovich, and\nyou, Anna Andreyevna [kissing her hand] and you Marya Antonovna [kissing\nher hand].\n\nKOROBKIN'S WIFE. I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart, Anna\nAndreyevna, on your new stroke of good fortune.\n\nLIULIUKOV. I have the honor to congratulate you, Anna Andreyevna.\n[Kisses her hand and turns to the audience, smacks his lips, putting on\na bold front.] Marya Antonovna, I have the honor to congratulate you.\n[Kisses her hand and turns to the audience in the same way.]\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\nA number of Guests enter. They kiss Anna's hand saying: \"Anna\nAndreyevna,\" then Marya's hand, saying \"Marya Antonovna.\"\n\nBobchinsky and Dobchinsky enter jostling each other.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. I have the honor to congratulate you.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Anton Antonovich, I have the honor to congratulate you.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. On the happy event.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Anna Andreyevna!\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Anna Andreyevna!\n\nThey bend over her hand at the same time and bump foreheads.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. Marya Antonovna! [Kisses her hand.] I have the honor to\ncongratulate you. You will enjoy the greatest happiness. You will wear\ngarments of gold and eat the most delicate soups, and you will pass your\ntime most entertainingly.\n\nBOBCHINSKY [breaking in]. God give you all sorts of riches and of money\nand a wee tiny little son, like this. [Shows the size with his hands.]\nSo that he can sit on the palm of your hand. The little fellow will be\ncrying all the time, \"Wow, wow, wow.\"\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\nMore Guests enter and kiss the ladies' hands, among them Luka Lukich and\nhis wife.\n\nLUKA LUKICH. I have the honor.\n\nLUKA'S WIFE [running ahead]. Congratulate you, Anna Andreyevna.\n[They kiss.] Really, I was so glad to hear of it. They tell me, \"Anna\nAndreyevna has betrothed her daughter.\" \"Oh, my God,\" I think to myself.\nIt made me so glad that I said to my husband, \"Listen, Lukanchik,\nthat's a great piece of fortune for Anna Andreyevna.\" \"Well,\" think I\nto myself, \"thank God!\" And I say to him, \"I'm so delighted that I'm\nconsumed with impatience to tell it to Anna Andreyevna herself.\" \"Oh,\nmy God,\" think I to myself, \"it's just as Anna Andreyevna expected. She\nalways did expect a good match for her daughter. And now what luck! It\nhappened just exactly as she wanted it to happen.\" Really, it made me so\nglad that I couldn't say a word. I cried and cried. I simply screamed,\nso that Luka Lukich said to me, \"What are you crying so for, Nastenka?\"\n\"Lukanchik,\" I said, \"I don't know myself. The tears just keep flowing\nlike a stream.\"\n\nGOVERNOR. Please sit down, ladies and gentlemen. Ho, Mishka, bring some\nmore chairs in.\n\nThe Guests seat themselves.\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\n\n\nThe same, the Police Captain and Sergeants.\n\nCAPTAIN. I have the honor to congratulate you, your Honor, and to wish\nyou long years of prosperity.\n\nGOVERNOR. Thank you, thank you! Please sit down, gentlemen.\n\nThe Guests seat themselves.\n\nAMMOS. But please tell us, Anton Antonovich, how did it all come about,\nand how did it all--ahem!--go?\n\nGOVERNOR. It went in a most extraordinary way. He condescended to make\nthe proposal in his own person.\n\nANNA. In the most respectful and most delicate manner. He spoke\nbeautifully. He said: \"Anna Andreyevna, I have only a feeling of respect\nfor your worth.\" And such a handsome, cultured man! His manners so\ngenteel! \"Believe me, Anna Andreyevna,\" he says, \"life is not worth a\npenny to me. It is only because I respect your rare qualities.\"\n\nMARYA. Oh, mamma, it was to me he said that.\n\nANNA. Shut up! You don't know anything. And don't meddle in other\npeople's affairs. \"Anna Andreyevna,\" he says, \"I am enraptured.\" That\nwas the flattering way he poured out his soul. And when I was going to\nsay, \"We cannot possibly hope for such an honor,\" he suddenly went\ndown on his knees, and so aristocratically! \"Anna Andreyevna,\" he says,\n\"don't make me the most miserable of men. Consent to respond to my\nfeelings, or else I'll put an end to my life.\"\n\nMARYA. Really, mamma, it was to me he said that.\n\nANNA. Yes, of course--to you, too. I don't deny it.\n\nGOVERNOR. He even frightened us. He said he would put a bullet through\nhis brains. \"I'll shoot myself, I'll shoot myself,\" he said.\n\nMANY GUESTS. Well, for the Lord's sake!\n\nAMMOS. How remarkable!\n\nLUKA. It must have been fate that so ordained.\n\nARTEMY. Not fate, my dear friend. Fate is a turkey-hen. It was the\nGovernor's services that brought him this piece of fortune. [Aside.]\nGood luck always does crawl into the mouths of swine like him.\n\nAMMOS. If you like, Anton Antonovich, I'll sell you the dog we were\nbargaining about.\n\nGOVERNOR. I don't care about dogs now.\n\nAMMOS. Well, if you don't want it, then we'll agree on some other dog.\n\nKOROBKIN'S WIFE. Oh, Anna Andreyevna, how happy I am over your good\nfortune. You can't imagine how happy I am.\n\nKOROBKIN. But where, may I ask, is the distinguished guest now? I heard\nhe had gone away for some reason or other.\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, he's gone off for a day on a highly important matter.\n\nANNA. To his uncle--to ask his blessing.\n\nGOVERNOR. To ask his blessing. But tomorrow--[He sneezes, and all burst\ninto one exclamation of well-wishes.] Thank you very much. But tomorrow\nhe'll be back. [He sneezes, and is congratulated again. Above the other\nvoices are heard those of the following.]\n\n{CAPTAIN. I wish you health, your Honor.\n\n{BOBCHINSKY. A hundred years and a sack of ducats.\n\n{DOBCHINSKY. May God increase it to a thousand.\n\n{ARTEMY. May you go to hell!\n\n{KOROBKIN'S WIFE. The devil take you!\n\nGOVERNOR. I'm very much obliged to you. I wish you the same.\n\nANNA. We intend to live in St. Petersburg now. I must say, the\natmosphere here is too village-like. I must say, it's extremely\nunpleasant. My husband, too--he'll be made a general there.\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, confound it, gentlemen, I admit I should very much like\nto be a general.\n\nLUKA. May God grant that you get a generalship.\n\nRASTAKOVSKY. From man it is impossible, but from God everything is\npossible.\n\nAMMOS. High merits, high honors.\n\nARTEMY. Reward according to service.\n\nAMMOS [aside]. The things he'll do when he becomes a general. A\ngeneralship suits him as a saddle suits a cow. It's a far cry to his\ngeneralship. There are better men than you, and they haven't been made\ngenerals yet.\n\nARTEMY [aside]. The devil take it--he's aiming for a generalship.\nWell, maybe he will become a general after all. He's got the air of\nimportance, the devil take him! [Addressing the Governor.] Don't forget\nus then, Anton Antonovich.\n\nAMMOS. And if anything happens--for instance, some difficulty in our\naffairs--don't refuse us your protection.\n\nKOROBKIN. Next year I am going to take my son to the capital to put him\nin government service. So do me the kindness to give me your protection.\nBe a father to the orphan.\n\nGOVERNOR. I am ready for my part--ready to exert my efforts on your\nbehalf.\n\nANNA. Antosha, you are always ready with your promises. In the first\nplace, you won't have time to think of such things. And how can you--how\nis it possible for you, to burden yourself with such promises?\n\nGOVERNOR. Why not, my dear? It's possible occasionally.\n\nANNA. Of course it's possible. But you can't give protection to every\nsmall potato.\n\nKOROBKIN'S WIFE. Do you hear the way she speaks of us?\n\nGUEST. She's always been that way. I know her. Seat her at table and\nshe'll put her feet on it.\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII\n\n\nThe same and the Postmaster, who rushes in with an unsealed letter in\nhis hand.\n\nPOSTMASTER. A most astonishing thing, ladies and gentlemen! The official\nwhom we took to be an inspector-general is not an inspector-general.\n\nALL. How so? Not an inspector-general?\n\nPOSTMASTER. No, not a bit of it. I found it out from the letter.\n\nGOVERNOR. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What\nletter?\n\nPOSTMASTER. His own letter. They bring a letter to the postoffice, I\nglance at the address and I see Pochtamtskaya Street. I was struck dumb.\n\"Well,\" I think to myself, \"I suppose he found something wrong in the\npostoffice department and is informing the government.\" So I unsealed\nit.\n\nGOVERNOR. How could you?\n\nPOSTMASTER. I don't know myself. A supernatural power moved me. I had\nalready summoned a courier to send it off by express; but I was overcome\nby a greater curiosity than I have ever felt in my life. \"I can't,\nI can't,\" I hear a voice telling me. \"I can't.\" But it pulled me and\npulled me. In one ear I heard, \"Don't open the letter. You will die\nlike a chicken,\" and in the other it was just as if the devil were\nwhispering, \"Open it, open it.\" And when I cracked the sealing wax, I\nfelt as if I were on fire; and when I opened the letter, I froze, upon\nmy word, I froze. And my hands trembled, and everything whirled around\nme.\n\nGOVERNOR. But how did you dare to open it? The letter of so powerful a\npersonage?\n\nPOSTMASTER. But that's just the point--he's neither powerful nor a\npersonage.\n\nGOVERNOR. Then what is he in your opinion?\n\nPOSTMASTER. He's neither one thing nor another. The devil knows what he\nis.\n\nGOVERNOR [furiously]. How neither one thing nor another? How do you\ndare to call him neither one thing nor another? And the devil knows what\nbesides? I'll put you under arrest.\n\nPOSTMASTER. Who--you?\n\nGOVERNOR. Yes, I.\n\nPOSTMASTER. You haven't the power.\n\nGOVERNOR. Do you know that he's going to marry my daughter? That I\nmyself am going to be a high official and will have the power to exile\nto Siberia?\n\nPOSTMASTER. Oh, Anton Antonovich, Siberia! Siberia is far away. I'd\nrather read the letter to you. Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to read\nthe letter.\n\nALL. Do read it.\n\nPOSTMASTER [reads]. \"I hasten to inform you, my dear friend, what\nwonderful things have happened to me. On the way here an infantry\ncaptain did me out of my last penny, so that the innkeeper here\nwanted to send me to jail, when suddenly, thanks to my St. Petersburg\nappearance and dress, the whole town took me for a governor-general. Now\nI am staying at the governor's home. I am having a grand time and I am\nflirting desperately with his wife and daughter. I only haven't decided\nwhom to begin with. I think with the mother first, because she seems\nready to accept all terms. You remember how hard up we were taking our\nmeals wherever we could without paying for them, and how once the pastry\ncook grabbed me by the collar for having charged pies that I ate to the\nking of England? Now it is quite different. They lend me all the money\nI want. They are an awful lot of originals. You would split your sides\nlaughing at them. I know you write for the papers. Put them in your\nliterature. In the first place the Governor is as stupid as an old\nhorse--\"\n\nGOVERNOR. Impossible! That can't be in the letter.\n\nPOSTMASTER [showing the letter]. Read for yourself.\n\nGOVERNOR [reads]. \"As an old horse.\" Impossible! You put it in yourself.\n\nPOSTMASTER. How could I?\n\nARTEMY. Go on reading.\n\nLUKA. Go on reading.\n\nPOSTMASTER [continuing to read]. \"The Governor is as stupid as an old\nhorse--\"\n\nGOVERNOR. Oh, the devil! He's got to read it again. As if it weren't\nthere anyway.\n\nPOSTMASTER [continuing to read]. H'm, h'm--\"an old horse. The Postmaster\nis a good man, too.\" [Stops reading.] Well, here he's saying something\nimproper about me, too.\n\nGOVERNOR. Go on--read the rest.\n\nPOSTMASTER. What for?\n\nGOVERNOR. The deuce take it! Once we have begun to read it, we must read\nit all.\n\nARTEMY. If you will allow me, I will read it. [Puts on his eye-glasses\nand reads.] \"The Postmaster is just like the porter Mikheyev in our\noffice, and the scoundrel must drink just as hard.\"\n\nPOSTMASTER [to the audience]. A bad boy! He ought to be given a licking.\nThat's all.\n\nARTEMY [continues to read]. \"The Superintendent of Char-i-i--\"\n[Stammers.]\n\nKOROBKIN. Why did you stop?\n\nARTEMY. The handwriting isn't clear. Besides, it's evident that he's a\nblackguard.\n\nKOROBKIN. Give it to me. I believe my eyesight is better.\n\nARTEMY [refusing to give up the letter]. No. This part can be omitted.\nAfter that it's legible.\n\nKOROBKIN. Let me have it please. I'll see for myself.\n\nARTEMY. I can read it myself. I tell you that after this part it's all\nlegible.\n\nPOSTMASTER. No, read it all. Everything so far could be read.\n\nALL. Give him the letter, Artemy Filippovich, give it to him. [To\nKorobkin.] You read it.\n\nARTEMY. Very well. [Gives up the letter.] Here it is. [Covers a part of\nit with his finger.] Read from here on. [All press him.]\n\nPOSTMASTER. Read it all, nonsense, read it all.\n\nKOROBKIN [reading]. \"The Superintendent of Charities, Zemlianika, is a\nregular pig in a cap.\"\n\nARTEMY [to the audience]. Not a bit witty. A pig in a cap! Have you ever\nseen a pig wear a cap?\n\nKOROBKIN [continues reading]. \"The School Inspector reeks of onions.\"\n\nLUKA [to the audience]. Upon my word, I never put an onion to my mouth.\n\nAMMOS [aside]. Thank God, there's nothing about me in it.\n\nKOROBKIN [continues reading]. \"The Judge--\"\n\nAMMOS. There! [Aloud.] Ladies and gentlemen, I think the letter is far\ntoo long. To the devil with it! Why should we go on reading such trash?\n\nLUKA. No.\n\nPOSTMASTER. No, go on.\n\nARTEMY. Go on reading.\n\nKOROBKIN. \"The Judge, Liapkin-Tiapkin, is extremely mauvais ton.\" [He\nstops.] That must be a French word.\n\nAMMOS. The devil knows what it means. It wouldn't be so bad if all it\nmeans is \"cheat.\" But it may mean something worse.\n\nKOROBKIN [continues reading]. \"However, the people are hospitable\nand kindhearted. Farewell, my dear Triapichkin. I want to follow your\nexample and take up literature. It's tiresome to live this way, old boy.\nOne wants food for the mind, after all. I see I must engage in something\nlofty. Address me: Village of Podkatilovka in the Government of\nSaratov.\" [Turns the letter and reads the address.] \"Mr. Ivan\nVasilyevich Triapichkin, St. Petersburg, Pochtamtskaya Street, House\nNumber 97, Courtyard, third floor, right.\"\n\nA LADY. What an unexpected rebuke!\n\nGOVERNOR. He has cut my throat and cut it for good. I'm done for,\ncompletely done for. I see nothing. All I see are pigs' snouts instead\nof faces, and nothing more. Catch him, catch him! [Waves his hand.]\n\nPOSTMASTER. Catch him! How? As if on purpose, I told the overseer to\ngive him the best coach and three. The devil prompted me to give the\norder.\n\nKOROBKIN'S WIFE. Here's a pretty mess.\n\nAMMOS. Confound it, he borrowed three hundred rubles from me.\n\nARTEMY. He borrowed three hundred from me, too.\n\nPOSTMASTER [sighing]. And from me, too.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. And sixty-five from me and Piotr Ivanovich.\n\nAMMOS [throwing up his hands in perplexity]. How's that, gentlemen?\nReally, how could we have been so off our guard?\n\nGOVERNOR [beating his forehead]. How could I, how could I, old fool?\nI've grown childish, stupid mule. I have been in the service thirty\nyears. Not one merchant, not one contractor has been able to impose on\nme. I have over-reached one swindler after another. I have caught crooks\nand sharpers that were ready to rob the whole world. I have fooled three\ngovernor-generals. As for governor-generals, [with a wave of his hand]\nit is not even worth talking about them.\n\nANNA. But how is it possible, Antosha? He's engaged to Mashenka.\n\nGOVERNOR [in a rage]. Engaged! Rats! Fiddlesticks! So much for your\nengagement! Thrusts her engagement at me now! [In a frenzy.] Here, look\nat me! Look at me, the whole world, the whole of Christendom. See what\na fool the governor was made of. Out upon him, the fool, the old\nscoundrel! [Shakes his fist at himself.] Oh, you fat-nose! To take an\nicicle, a rag for a personage of rank! Now his coach bells are jingling\nall along the road. He is publishing the story to the whole world. Not\nonly will you be made a laughing-stock of, but some scribbler, some\nink-splasher will put you into a comedy. There's the horrid sting. He\nwon't spare either rank or station. And everybody will grin and clap his\nhands. What are you laughing at? You are laughing at yourself, oh you!\n[Stamps his feet.] I would give it to all those ink-splashers! You\nscribblers, damned liberals, devil's brood! I would tie you all up in a\nbundle, I would grind you into meal, and give it to the devil. [Shakes\nhis fist and stamps his heel on the floor. After a brief silence.] I\ncan't come to myself. It's really true, whom the gods want to\npunish they first make mad. In what did that nincompoop resemble an\ninspector-general? In nothing, not even half the little finger of an\ninspector-general. And all of a sudden everybody is going about saying,\n\"Inspector-general, inspector-general.\" Who was the first to say it?\nTell me.\n\nARTEMY [throwing up his hands]. I couldn't tell how it happened if I had\nto die for it. It is just as if a mist had clouded our brains. The devil\nhas confounded us.\n\nAMMOS. Who was the first to say it? These two here, this noble pair.\n[Pointing to Dobchinsky and Bobchinsky.]\n\nBOBCHINSKY. So help me God, not I. I didn't even think of it.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. I didn't say a thing, not a thing.\n\nARTEMY. Of course you did.\n\nLUKA. Certainly. You came running here from the inn like madmen. \"He's\ncome, he's come. He doesn't pay.\" Found a rare bird!\n\nGOVERNOR. Of course it was you. Town gossips, damned liars!\n\nARTEMY. The devil take you with your inspector-general and your tattle.\n\nGOVERNOR. You run about the city, bother everybody, confounded\nchatterboxes. You spread gossip, you short-tailed magpies, you!\n\nAMMOS. Damned bunglers!\n\nLUKA. Simpletons.\n\nARTEMY. Pot-bellied mushrooms!\n\nAll crowd around them.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. Upon my word, it wasn't I. It was Piotr Ivanovich.\n\nDOBCHINSKY. No, Piotr Ivanovich, you were the first.\n\nBOBCHINSKY. No, no. You were the first.\n\n\n\n\nLAST SCENE\n\n\nThe same and a Gendarme.\n\nGENDARME. An official from St. Petersburg sent by imperial order has\narrived, and wants to see you all at once. He is stopping at the inn.\n\nAll are struck as by a thunderbolt. A cry of amazement bursts from the\nladies simultaneously. The whole group suddenly shifts positions and\nremains standing as if petrified.\n\n\n\n\nSILENT SCENE\n\n\nThe Governor stands in the center rigid as a post, with outstretched\nhands and head thrown backward. On his right are his wife and daughter\nstraining toward him. Back of them the Postmaster, turned toward the\naudience, metamorphosed into a question mark. Next to him, at the edge\nof the group, three lady guests leaning on each other, with a most\nsatirical expression on their faces directed straight at the Governor's\nfamily. To the left of the Governor is Zemlianika, his head to one side\nas if listening. Behind him is the Judge with outspread hands almost\ncrouching on the ground and pursing his lips as if to whistle or say:\n\"A nice pickle we're in!\" Next to him is Korobkin, turned toward the\naudience, with eyes screwed up and making a venomous gesture at the\nGovernor. Next to him, at the edge of the group, are Dobchinsky and\nBobchinsky, gesticulating at each other, open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\nThe other guests remain standing stiff. The whole group retain the same\nposition of rigidity for almost a minute and a half. The curtain falls.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Inspector-General, by Nicolay Gogol\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3735-8.txt or 3735-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/7\/3\/3735\/\n\nProduced by Judy Boss\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":569,"split":"train"}
