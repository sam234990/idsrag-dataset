{"ori_id":"3b6b07116f23ac811a4d20acca3ed758c557795c","title":"Highlander: Endgame","context":"Highlander: Endgame\n In A.D. 1555, Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) returns to his former home in Glenfinnan, Scotland, to save his mother from his former friend and village priest Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne). Kell executes Connor's mother for witchcraft. Connor kills both Kell and Kell's adopted father, Father Rainey, and sets Glenfinnan ablaze. Jacob Kell is reborn as an Immortal, and vows vengeance against Connor for Rainey's death. He spends the next four centuries killing people Connor cares about. Kell amasses great power by ignoring the rules of The Game; he recruits several lesser Immortals as disciples, who overpower other Immortals so Kell can take their heads. By the turn of the century, Kell has 661 Immortal kills (compared to 262 for Connor MacLeod, and 174 for Duncan MacLeod).\nTen years before the present-day events of the film, Kell orchestrates the death of Connor's adopted daughter Rachel Ellenstein. Heartbroken, Connor departs for The Sanctuary, where Immortals are under surveillance by a subgroup of Watchers to prevent The Prize from being won.\nA decade later, Kell and his disciples attack the Sanctuary, and Connor is believed to have been beheaded along with the other Immortals there. Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), compelled by a vision he has of the slaughter, begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Mathew Hale, the watcher supervising the sanctuary, looks on at the carnage, and decides that they will now turn to \"volunteers\" to refill their test-subjects' numbers. Duncan goes to see Methos, who tells him about the Sanctuary. Duncan cannot believe that Connor would even go to such a place. He later leaves London for New York, where he goes to Connor's loft, which was destroyed in the explosion that killed Rachel. Sensing an Immortal, he turns to see Kate (Lisa Barbuscia), his wife from 200 years before. Then Kell's posse arrives, and fights Duncan (disregarding the rule of one-on-one combat). The fighting stops when Kell arrives, but Carlos shoots Duncan, who falls on a spike, killing him. Kell is furious with Carlos, and beheads him: as the quickening begins, a van drives up to where Duncan fell, and takes him away.\nLater on, Duncan wakes up, only to realize that he has been taken by Watchers who want to keep him in the Sanctuary so that he does not win the Prize. He is later saved with the help of Methos and Joe. He discovers Connor was spared by Kell, so as to allow the evil Immortal to make Connor's life even more miserable. Kell wants to kill Duncan in order to torture Connor, and given the number of Quickenings he has received, this seems quite likely to occur. Additionally, Connor is too guilt-ridden by the deaths of all his loved ones to stand up to Kell by himself. Duncan later confronts Kate (now using the alias \"Faith\") at a fashion shoot, and asks her why she is with Kell. She tells him how much she hates the fact that she will never have children or grow old and die, and believes that Kell understands her pain. Duncan must earn her forgiveness, or face her as an embittered part of Kell's faction. Later on in his hotel room, Kate arrives after having a chat with Kell, and the two make love. Though it would appear that she has forgiven him, it is not the case, and she tells Duncan that she will never forgive him; Duncan tells her that it is never too late for redemption, and that he will wait, even if it takes years or centuries.\nUltimately, Kell executes his group in a mock Last Supper to gain their powers, including possibly Faith, and Connor convinces Duncan that Connor must allow himself to be beheaded in order for Duncan to have enough power to rival Kell. After an emotional good-bye, Duncan follows Connor's advice, and beheads his beloved clansman.\nSoon after, Duncan and Kell engage in a final battle. At first, Kell easily overpowers Duncan, even when MacLeod attempts a supposedly-unbeatable sword move that Connor taught him. Just before Duncan's impending death at the hands of Kell, Connor's spirit helps give Duncan the strength to continue. Duncan then kills Kell by jumping over him and decapitating him as he turns around. Duncan absorbs all of Kell's massive power. He then goes to Glen Coe, Scotland to bury Connor next to Connor's first wife Heather.\n<html>\n<head><title>Highlander: Endgame Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Highlander: Endgame script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Highlander: Endgame script, Highlander: Endgame movie script, Highlander: Endgame film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">EXECUTIONER \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(softly)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Caiolin nods.  He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS.  CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING...\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE.

He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire.  Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... \n<\/p><p><P ID=\"act\">Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs.  Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward.  Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own.  Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand.  The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... \n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">. . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings.  Kase crouches blustering over Rainey.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">KASE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Father...

Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"right\">DISSOLVE TO:\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb.

Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet.  And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others.  IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand.

He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently.

Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been\nspared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home.\nPausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing\n<b>AN INNER DOOR\n<\/b>deliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform.\nHe pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages.\nFinally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"act\">TRANSITION TO:\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile.

Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times.  Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier.  A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CONNOR\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've improved greatly.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n<P ID=\"dia\">You really think so?\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n<P ID=\"dia\">No. I'm just being gracious.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. <\/p><p><p ID=\"speaker\">CONNOR (cont'd)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Duncan lunges again.

It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. \n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CONNOR (cont'd) \n<P ID=\"dia\">Survival. Learn it.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(whirls around)\n<P ID=\"dia\">You mind?!\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Connor clucks his tongue.\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">CONNOR (cont'd)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Allow me.\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He squares Duncan\u0091s shoulders and steps back.
