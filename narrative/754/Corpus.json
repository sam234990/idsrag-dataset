When old jealousies against a kinsman spark intrigues against the young ing\u00e9nue, the best marriage prospects withdraw. The young woman follows her mother's recommendation and accepts the overtures of a middling suitor, the Prince de Cl\u00e8ves. After the wedding, she meets the dashing Duke de Nemours. The two fall in love, yet do nothing to pursue their affections, limiting their contact to an occasional visit in the now-Princess of Cl\u00e8ves's salon. The duke becomes enmeshed in a scandal at court that leads the Princess to believe he has been unfaithful in his affections. A letter from a spurned mistress to her paramour is discovered in the dressing room at one of the estates\u2014a letter actually written to the Princess' uncle, the Vidame de Chartres, who has also become entangled in a relationship with the Queen. He begs the Duke de Nemours to claim ownership of the letter, which ends up in the Princess' possession. The duke has to produce documents from the Vidame to convince the Princess that his heart has been true. Eventually, the Prince de Cl\u00e8ves discerns that his wife is in love with another man. She confesses as much. He relentlessly quizzes her\u2014indeed tricks her\u2014until she reveals the man's identity. After he sends a servant to spy on the Duke de Nemours, the Prince de Cl\u00e8ves believes that his wife has been unfaithful in more than just her emotions. He becomes ill and dies (either of his illness or of a broken heart). On his deathbed, he blames the Duke de Nemours for his suffering and begs the Princess not to marry him. Now free to pursue her passions, the Princess is torn between her duty and her love. The duke pursues her more openly, but she rejects him, choosing instead to enter a convent for part of each year. After several years, the duke's love for her does finally fade, and she, still relatively young, passes away in obscurity.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Princess of Cleves, by Madame de Lafayette\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

This Prince was amorous\nand handsome, and though his passion for Diana of Poitiers Duchess of\nValentinois, was of above twenty years standing, it was not the less\nviolent, nor did he give less distinguishing proofs of it.\n\nAs he was happily turned to excel in bodily exercises, he took a\nparticular delight in them, such as hunting, tennis, running at the\nring, and the like diversions.  Madam de Valentinois gave spirit to all\nentertainments of this sort, and appeared at them with grace and beauty\nequal to that of her grand-daughter, Madam de la Marke, who was then\nunmarried; the Queen's presence seemed to authorise hers.\n\nThe Queen was handsome, though not young; she loved grandeur,\nmagnificence and pleasure; she was married to the King while he was\nDuke of Orleans, during the life of his elder brother the Dauphin, a\nprince whose great qualities promised in him a worthy successor of his\nfather Francis the First.\n\nThe Queen's ambitious temper made her taste the sweets of reigning, and\nshe seemed to bear with perfect ease the King's passion for the Duchess\nof Valentinois, nor did she express the least jealousy of it; but she\nwas so skilful a dissembler, that it was hard to judge of her real\nsentiments, and policy obliged her to keep the duchess about her\nperson, that she might draw the King to her at the same time.  This\nPrince took great delight in the conversation of women, even of such as\nhe had no passion for; for he was every day at the Queen's court, when\nshe held her assembly, which was a concourse of all that was beautiful\nand excellent in either sex.\n\nNever were finer women or more accomplished men seen in any Court, and\nNature seemed to have taken pleasure in lavishing her greatest graces\non the greatest persons.  The Princess Elizabeth, since Queen of Spain,\nbegan now to manifest an uncommon wit, and to display those beauties,\nwhich proved afterwards so fatal to her.  Mary Stuart, Queen of\nScotland, who had just married the Dauphin, and was called the\nQueen-Dauphin, had all the perfections of mind and body; she had been\neducated in the Court of France, and had imbibed all the politeness of\nit; she was by nature so well formed to shine in everything that was\npolite, that notwithstanding her youth, none surpassed her in the most\nrefined accomplishments.  The Queen, her mother-in-law, and the King's\nsister, were also extreme lovers of music, plays and poetry; for the\ntaste which Francis the First had for the Belles Lettres was not yet\nextinguished in France; and as his son was addicted to exercises, no\nkind of pleasure was wanting at Court. But what rendered this Court so\nsplendid, was the presence of so many great Princes, and persons of the\nhighest quality and merit: those I shall name, in their different\ncharacters, were the admiration and ornament of their age.\n\nThe King of Navarre drew to himself the respect of all the world both\nby the greatness of his birth, and by the dignity that appeared in his\nperson; he was remarkable for his skill and courage in war.  The Duke\nof Guise had also given proofs of extraordinary valour, and had, been\nso successful, that there was not a general who did not look upon him\nwith envy; to his valour he added a most exquisite genius and\nunderstanding, grandeur of mind, and a capacity equally turned for\nmilitary or civil affairs.  His brother, the Cardinal of Loraine, was a\nman of boundless ambition, and of extraordinary wit and eloquence, and\nhad besides acquired a vast variety of learning, which enabled him to\nmake himself very considerable by defending the Catholic religion,\nwhich began to be attacked at that time.  The Chevalier de Guise,\nafterwards called Grand Prior, was a prince beloved by all the world,\nof a comely person, full of wit and address, and distinguished through\nall Europe for his valour.  The Prince of Conde, though little indebted\nto Nature in his person, had a noble soul, and the liveliness of his\nwit made him amiable even in the eyes of the finest women.  The Duke of\nNevers, distinguished by the high employments he had possessed, and by\nthe glory he had gained in war, though in an advanced age, was yet the\ndelight of the Court: he had three sons very accomplished; the second,\ncalled the Prince of Cleves, was worthy to support the honour of his\nhouse; he was brave and generous, and showed a prudence above his\nyears.  The Viscount de Chartres, descended of the illustrious family\nof Vendome, whose name the Princes of the blood have thought it no\ndishonour to wear, was equally distinguished for gallantry; he was\ngenteel, of a fine mien, valiant, generous, and all these qualities he\npossessed in a very uncommon degree; in short, if anyone could be\ncompared to the Duke de Nemours, it was he.  The Duke de Nemours was a\nmasterpiece of Nature; the beauty of his person, inimitable as it was,\nwas his least perfection; what placed him above other men, was a\ncertain agreeableness in his discourse, his actions, his looks, which\nwas observable in none beside himself: he had in his behaviour a gaiety\nthat was equally pleasing to men and women; in his exercises he was\nvery expert; and in dress he had a peculiar manner, which was followed\nby all the world, but could never be imitated: in fine, such was the\nair of his whole person, that it was impossible to fix one's eye on\nanything else, wherever he was.  There was not a lady at Court, whose\nvanity would not have been gratified by his address; few of those whom\nhe addressed, could boast of having resisted him; and even those for\nwhom he expressed no passion, could not forbear expressing one for him:\nhis natural gaiety and disposition to gallantry was so great, that he\ncould not refuse some part of his cares and attention to those who made\nit their endeavour to please him; and accordingly he had several\nmistresses, but it was hard to guess which of them was in possession of\nhis heart: he made frequent visits to the Queen-Dauphin; the beauty of\nthis princess, the sweetness of her temper, the care she took to oblige\neverybody, and the particular esteem she expressed for the Duke de\nNemours, gave ground to believe that he had raised his views even to\nher.  Messieurs de Guise, whose niece she was, had so far increased\ntheir authority and reputation by this match, that their ambition\nprompted them to aspire at an equality with the Princes of the blood,\nand to share in power with the Constable Montmorency.  The King\nentrusted the Constable with the chief share in the administration of\nthe Government, and treated the Duke of Guise and the Mareschal de St.\nAndre as his favourites; but whether favour or business admitted men to\nhis presence, they could not preserve that privilege without the\ngood-liking of the Duchess of Valentinois; for though she was no longer\nin possession of either of youth or beauty, she yet reigned so\nabsolutely in his heart, that his person and state seemed entirely at\nher disposal.\n\nThe King had such an affection for the Constable, that he was no sooner\npossessed of the Government, but he recalled him from the banishment he\nhad been sent into by Francis the First: thus was the Court divided\nbetween Messieurs de Guise, and the Constable, who was supported by the\nPrinces of the blood, and both parties made it their care to gain the\nDuchess of Valentinois.  The Duke d'Aumale, the Duke of Guise's\nbrother, had married one of her daughters, and the Constable aspired to\nthe fame alliance; he was not contented with having married his eldest\nson with Madam Diana, the King's daughter by a Piemontese lady, who\nturned nun as soon as she was brought to bed.  This marriage had met\nwith a great many obstacles from the promises which Monsieur\nMontmorency had made to Madam de Piennes, one of the maids of honour to\nthe Queen; and though the King had surmounted them with extreme\npatience and goodness, the Constable did not think himself sufficiently\nestablished, unless he secured Madam de Valentinois in his interest,\nand separated her from Messieurs de Guise, whose greatness began to\ngive her uneasiness.  The Duchess had obstructed as much as she could\nthe marriage of the Dauphin with the Queen of Scotland; the beauty and\nforward wit of that young Queen, and the credit which her marriage gave\nto Messieurs de Guise, were insupportable to her; she in particular\nhated the Cardinal of Loraine, who had spoken to her with severity, and\neven with contempt; she was sensible he took the party of the Queen, so\nthat the Constable found her very well disposed to unite her interests\nwith his and to enter into alliance with him, by marrying her\ngranddaughter Madam de la Marke with Monsieur d'Anville, his second\nson, who succeeded him in his employment under the reign of Charles the\nNinth.  The Constable did not expect to find the same disinclination to\nmarriage in his second son which he had found in his eldest, but he\nproved mistaken. The Duke d'Anville was desperately in love with the\nDauphin-Queen, and how little hope soever he might have of succeeding\nin his passion, he could not prevail with himself to enter into an\nengagement that would divide his cares.  The Mareschal de St. Andre was\nthe only person in the Court that had not listed in either party: he\nwas a particular favourite, and the King had a personal affection for\nhim; he had taken a liking to him ever since he was Dauphin, and\ncreated him a Mareschal of France at an age in which others rarely\nobtain the least dignities.  His favour with the King gave him a lustre\nwhich he supported by his merit and the agreeableness of his person, by\na splendour in his table and furniture, and by the most profuse\nmagnificence that ever was known in a private person, the King's\nliberality enabling him to bear such an expense.  This Prince was\nbounteous even to prodigality to those he favoured, and though he had\nnot all the great qualities, he had very many; particularly he took\ndelight and had great skill in military affairs; he was also\nsuccessful, and excepting the Battle of St. Quintin, his reign had been\na continued series of victory; he won in person the Battle of Renti,\nPiemont was conquered, the English were driven out of France, and the\nEmperor Charles V found his good fortune decline before the walls of\nMets, which he besieged in vain with all the forces of the Empire, and\nof Spain: but the disgrace received at St. Quintin lessened the hopes\nwe had of extending our conquests, and as fortune seemed to divide\nherself between two Kings, they both found themselves insensibly\ndisposed to peace.\n\nThe Duchess Dowager of Loraine had made some overtures about the time\nof the Dauphin's marriage, since which a secret negotiation had been\nconstantly carried on; in fine, Coran in Artois was the place appointed\nfor the treaty; the Cardinal of Loraine, the Constable Montmorency, and\nthe Mareschal de St. Andre were plenipotentaries for the King; the Duke\nof Alva, and the Prince of Orange for Philip the II, and the Duke and\nDuchess of Loraine were mediators.  The principal articles were the\nmarriage of the Princess Elizabeth of France with Don Carlos the\nInfanta of Spain, and that of his majesty's sister with the Duke of\nSavoy.\n\nThe King, during the Treaty, continued on the frontiers, where he\nreceived the news of the death of Queen Mary of England; his Majesty\ndispatched forthwith the Count de Randan to Queen Elizabeth, to\ncongratulate her on her accession to the Crown, and they received him\nwith great distinction; for her affairs were so precarious at that\ntime, that nothing could be more advantageous to her, than to see her\ntitle acknowledged by the King.  The Count found she had a thorough\nknowledge of the interests of the French Court, and of the characters\nof those who composed it; but in particular, she had a great idea of\nthe Duke of Nemours: she spoke to him so often, and with so much\nernestness concerning him, that the Ambassador upon his return declared\nto the King, that there was nothing which the Duke of Nemours might not\nexpect from that Princess, and that he made no question she might even\nbe brought to marry him.  The King communicated it to the Duke the same\nevening, and caused the Count de Randan to relate to him all the\nconversations he had had with Queen Elizabeth, and in conclusion\nadvised him to push his fortune: the Duke of Nemours imagined at first\nthat the King was not in earnest, but when he found to the contrary,\n\"If, by your advice, Sir,\" said he, \"I engage in this chimerical\nundertaking for your Majesty's service, I must entreat your Majesty to\nkeep the affair secret, till the success of it shall justify me to the\npublic; I would not be thought guilty of the intolerable vanity, to\nthink that a Queen, who has never seen me, would marry me for love.\"\nThe King promised to let nobody into the design but the Constable,\nsecrecy being necessary, he knew, to the success of it.  The Count de\nRandan advised the Duke to go to England under pretence of travelling;\nbut the Duke disapproving this proposal, sent Mr. Lignerol, a sprightly\nyoung gentleman, his favourite, to sound the Queen's inclinations, and\nto endeavour to make some steps towards advancing that affair: in the\nmeantime, he paid a visit to the Duke of Savoy, who was then at\nBrussels with the King of Spain.  The death of Queen Mary brought great\nobstructions to the Treaty; the Congress broke up at the end of\nNovember, and the King returned to Paris.\n\nThere appeared at this time a lady at Court, who drew the eyes of the\nwhole world; and one may imagine she was a perfect beauty, to gain\nadmiration in a place where there were so many fine women; she was of\nthe same family with the Viscount of Chartres, and one of the greatest\nheiresses of France, her father died young, and left her to the\nguardianship of Madam de Chartres his wife, whose wealth, virtue, and\nmerit were uncommon.  After the loss of her husband she retired from\nCourt, and lived many years in the country; during this retreat, her\nchief care was bestowed in the education of her daughter; but she did\nnot make it her business to cultivate her wit and beauty only, she took\ncare also to inculcate virtue into her tender mind, and to make it\namiable to her.  The generality of mothers imagine, that it is\nsufficient to forbear talking of gallantries before young people, to\nprevent their engaging in them; but Madam de Chartres was of a\ndifferent opinion, she often entertained her daughter with descriptions\nof love; she showed her what there was agreeable in it, that she might\nthe more easily persuade her wherein it was dangerous; she related to\nher the insincerity, the faithlessness, and want of candour in men, and\nthe domestic misfortunes that flow from engagements with them; on the\nother hand she made her sensible, what tranquillity attends the life of\na virtuous woman, and what lustre modesty gives to a person who\npossesses birth and beauty; at the same time she informed her, how\ndifficult it was to preserve this virtue, except by an extreme distrust\nof one's self, and by a constant attachment to the only thing which\nconstitutes a woman's happiness, to love and to be loved by her husband.\n\nThis heiress was, at that time, one of the greatest matches in France,\nand though she was very young several marriages had been proposed to\nher mother; but Madam de Chartres being ambitious, hardly thought\nanything worthy of her daughter, and when she was sixteen years of age\nshe brought her to Court.  The Viscount of Chartres, who went to meet\nher, was with reason surprised at the beauty of the young lady; her\nfine hair and lovely complexion gave her a lustre that was peculiar to\nherself; all her features were regular, and her whole person was full\nof grace.\n\nThe day after her arrival, she went to choose some jewels at a famous\nItalian's; this man came from Florence with the Queen, and had acquired\nsuch immense riches by his trade, that his house seemed rather fit for\na Prince than a merchant; while she was there, the Prince of Cleves\ncame in, and was so touched with her beauty, that he could not\ndissemble his surprise, nor could Mademoiselle de Chartres forbear\nblushing upon observing the astonishment he was in; nevertheless, she\nrecollected herself, without taking any further notice of him than she\nwas obliged to do in civility to a person of his seeming rank; the\nPrince of Cleves viewed her with admiration, and could not comprehend\nwho that fine lady was, whom he did not know.  He found by her air, and\nher retinue, that she was of the first quality; by her youth he should\nhave taken her to be a maid, but not seeing her mother, and hearing the\nItalian call her madam, he did not know what to think; and all the\nwhile he kept his eyes fixed upon her, he found that his behaviour\nembarrassed her, unlike to most young ladies, who always behold with\npleasure the effect of their beauty; he found too, that he had made her\nimpatient to be going, and in truth she went away immediately: the\nPrince of Cleves was not uneasy at himself on having lost the view of\nher, in hopes of being informed who she was; but when he found she was\nnot known, he was under the utmost surprise; her beauty, and the modest\nair he had observed in her actions, affected him so, that from that\nmoment he entertained a passion for her.  In the evening he waited on\nhis Majesty's sister.\n\nThis Princess was in great consideration by reason of her interest with\nthe King her brother; and her authority was so great, that the King, on\nconcluding the peace, consented to restore Piemont, in order to marry\nher with the Duke of Savoy. Though she had always had a disposition to\nmarry, yet would she never accept of anything beneath a sovereign, and\nfor this reason she refused the King of Navarre, when he was Duke of\nVendome, and always had a liking for the Duke of Savoy; which\ninclination for him she had preserved ever since she saw him at Nice,\nat the interview between Francis I, and Pope Paul III.  As she had a\ngreat deal of wit, and a fine taste of polite learning, men of\ningenuity were always about her, and at certain times the whole Court\nresorted to her apartments.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves went there according to his custom; he was so\ntouched with the wit and beauty of Mademoiselle de Chartres, that he\ncould talk of nothing else; he related his adventure aloud, and was\nnever tired with the praises of this lady, whom he had seen, but did\nnot know; Madame told him, that there was nobody like her he described,\nand that if there were, she would be known by the whole world.  Madam\nde Dampiere, one of the Princess's ladies of honour, and a friend of\nMadam de Chartres, overhearing the conversation, came up to her\nHighness, and whispered her in the ear, that it was certainly\nMademoiselle de Chartres whom the Prince had seen.  Madame, returning\nto her discourse with the Prince, told him, if he would give her his\ncompany again the next morning, he should see the beauty he was so much\ntouched with.  Accordingly Mademoiselle de Chartres came the next day\nto Court, and was received by both Queens in the most obliging manner\nthat can be imagined, and with such admiration by everybody else, that\nnothing was to be heard at Court but her praises, which she received\nwith so agreeable a modesty, that she seemed not to have heard them, or\nat least not to be moved with them.  She afterwards went to wait upon\nMadame; that Princess, after having commended her beauty, informed her\nof the surprise she had given the Prince of Cleves; the Prince came in\nimmediately after; \"Come hither,\" said she to him, \"see, if I have not\nkept my word with you, and if at the same time that I show you\nMademoiselle de Chartres, I don't show you the lady you are in search\nof.  You ought to thank me, at least, for having acquainted her how\nmuch you are her admirer.\"\n\nThe Prince of Cleves was overjoyed to find that the lady he admired was\nof quality equal to her beauty; he addressed her, and entreated her to\nremember that he was her first lover, and had conceived the highest\nhonour and respect for her, before he knew her.\n\nThe Chevalier de Guise, and the Prince, who were two bosom friends,\ntook their leave of Madame together.  They were no sooner gone but they\nbegan to launch out into the praises of Mademoiselle de Chartres,\nwithout bounds; they were sensible at length that they had run into\nexcess in her commendation, and so both gave over for that time; but\nthey were obliged the next day to renew the subject, for this new-risen\nbeauty long continued to supply discourse to the whole Court; the Queen\nherself was lavish in her praise, and showed her particular marks of\nfavour; the Queen-Dauphin made her one of her favourites, and begged\nher mother to bring her often to her Court; the Princesses, the King's\ndaughters, made her a party in all their diversions; in short, she had\nthe love and admiration of the whole Court, except that of the Duchess\nof Valentinois: not that this young beauty gave her umbrage; long\nexperience convinced her she had nothing to fear on the part of the\nKing, and she had to great a hatred for the Viscount of Chartres, whom\nshe had endeavoured to bring into her interest by marrying him with one\nof her daughters, and who had joined himself to the Queen's party, that\nshe could not have the least favourable thought of a person who bore\nhis name, and was a great object of his friendship.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves became passionately in love with Mademoiselle de\nChartres, and ardently wished to marry her, but he was afraid the\nhaughtiness of her mother would not stoop to match her with one who was\nnot the head of his family: nevertheless his birth was illustrious, and\nhis elder brother, the Count d'En, had just married a lady so nearly\nrelated to the Royal family, that this apprehension was rather the\neffect of his love, than grounded on any substantial reason.  He had a\ngreat number of rivals; the most formidable among them, for his birth,\nhis merit, and the lustre which Royal favour cast upon his house, was\nthe Chevalier de Guise; this gentleman fell in love with Mademoiselle\nde Chartres the first day he saw her, and he discovered the Prince of\nCleves's passion as the Prince of Cleves discovered his.  Though they\nwere intimate friends, their having the same pretentions gradually\ncreated a coolness between them, and their friendship grew into an\nindifference, without their being able to come to an explanation on the\nmatter.  The Prince of Cleves's good fortune in having seen\nMademoiselle de Chartres first seemed to be a happy presage, and gave\nhim some advantage over his rivals, but he foresaw great obstructions\non the part of the Duke of Nevers his father: the Duke was strictly\nattached to the Duchess of Valentinois, and the Viscount de Chartres\nwas her enemy, which was a sufficient reason to hinder the Duke from\nconsenting to the marriage of his son, with a niece of the Viscount's.\n\nMadam de Chartres, who had taken so much care to inspire virtue into\nher daughter, did not fail to continue the same care in a place where\nit was so necessary, and where there were so many dangerous examples.\nAmbition and gallantry were the soul of the Court, and employed both\nsexes equally; there were so many different interests and so many\ncabals, and the ladies had so great a share in them, that love was\nalways mixed with business, and business with love: nobody was easy, or\nindifferent; their business was to raise themselves, to be agreeable,\nto serve or disserve; and intrigue and pleasure took up their whole\ntime. The care of the ladies was to recommend themselves either to the\nQueen, the Dauphin-Queen, or the Queen of Navarre, or to Madame, or the\nDuchess of Valentinois.  Inclination, reasons of decorum, resemblance\nof temper made their applications different; those who found the bloom\nworn off, and who professed an austerity of virtue, were attached to\nthe Queen; the younger sort, who loved pleasure and gallantry, made\ntheir Court to the Queen-Dauphin; the Queen of Navarre too had her\nfavourites, she was young, and had great power with the King her\nhusband, who was in the interest of the Constable, and by that means\nincreased his authority; Madame was still very beautiful, and drew many\nladies into her party.  And as for the Duchess of Valentinois, she\ncould command as many as she would condescend to smile upon; but very\nfew women were agreeable to her, and excepting some with whom she lived\nin confidence and familiarity, and whose humour was agreeable to her\nown, she admitted none but on days when she gratified her vanity in\nhaving a Court in the same manner the Queen had.\n\nAll these different cabals were full of emulation and envy towards one\nanother; the ladies, who composed them, had their jealousies also among\nthemselves, either as to favour or lovers: the interests of ambition\nwere often blended with concerns of less importance, but which did not\naffect less sensibly; so that in this Court there was a sort of tumult\nwithout disorder, which made it very agreeable, but at the same time\nvery dangerous for a young lady.  Madam de Chartres perceived the\ndanger, and was careful to guard her daughter from it; she entreated\nher, not as a mother, but as her friend, to impart to her all the\ngallantry she should meet withal, promising her in return to assist her\nin forming her conduct right, as to things in which young people are\noftentimes embarrassed.\n\nThe Chevalier de Guise was so open and unguarded with respect to his\npassion for Mademoiselle de Chartres, that nobody was ignorant of it:\nnevertheless he saw nothing but impossibilities in what he desired; he\nwas sensible that he was not a proper match for Mademoiselle de\nChartres, by reason of the narrowness of his fortune, which was not\nsufficient to support his dignity; and he was sensible besides, that\nhis brothers would not approve of his marrying, the marriages of\nyounger brothers being looked upon as what tends to the lessening great\nfamilies; the Cardinal of Loraine soon convinced him, that he was not\nmistaken; he condemned his attachment to Mademoiselle de Chartres with\nwarmth, but did not inform him of his true reasons for so doing; the\nCardinal, it seems, had a hatred to the Viscount, which was not known\nat that time, but afterwards discovered itself; he would rather have\nconsented to any other alliance for his brother than to that of the\nViscount; and he declared his aversion to it in so public a manner,\nthat Madam de Chartres was sensibly disgusted at it.  She took a world\nof pains to show that the Cardinal of Loraine had nothing to fear, and\nthat she herself had no thoughts of this marriage; the Viscount\nobserved the same conduct, and resented that of the Cardinal more than\nMadam de Chartres did, being better apprised of the cause of it.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves had not given less public proofs of his love, than\nthe Chevalier de Guise had done, which made the Duke of Nevers very\nuneasy; however he thought that he needed only to speak to his son, to\nmake him change his conduct; but he was very much surprised to find him\nin a settled design of marrying Mademoiselle de Chartres, and flew out\ninto such excesses of passion on that subject, that the occasion of it\nwas soon known to the whole Court, and among others to Madam de\nChartres: she never imagined that the Duke of Nevers would not think\nher daughter a very advantageous match for his son, nor was she a\nlittle astonished to find that the houses both of Cleves and Guise\navoided her alliance, instead of courting it.  Her resentment on this\naccount put her upon finding out a match for her daughter, which would\nraise her above those that imagined themselves above her; after having\nlooked about, she fixed upon the Prince Dauphin, son of the Duke de\nMontpensier, one of the most considerable persons then at Court.  As\nMadam de Chartres abounded in wit, and was assisted by the Viscount,\nwho was in great consideration, and as her daughter herself was a very\nconsiderable match, she managed the matter with so much dexterity and\nsuccess, that Monsieur de Montpensier appeared to desire the marriage,\nand there was no appearance of any difficulties in it.\n\nThe Viscount, knowing the power the Dauphin-Queen had over Monsieur\nd'Anville, thought it not amiss to employ the interest of that Princess\nto engage him to serve Mademoiselle de Chartres, both with the King and\nthe Prince de Montpensier, whose intimate friend he was: he spoke to\nthe Dauphin-Queen about it, and she entered with joy into an affair\nwhich concerned the promotion of a lady for whom she had a great\naffection; she expressed as much to the Viscount, and assured him, that\nthough she knew she should do what was disagreeable to the Cardinal of\nLoraine her uncle, she would pass over that consideration with\npleasure, because she had reasons of complaint against him, since he\nevery day more and more espoused the interest of the Queen against hers.\n\nPersons of gallantry are always glad of an opportunity of speaking to\nthose who love them.  No sooner was the Viscount gone, but the\nQueen-Dauphin sent Chatelart to Monsieur d'Anville, to desire him from\nher to be at Court that evening.  Chatelart was his favourite, and\nacquainted with his passion for this Princess, and therefore received\nher commands with great pleasure and respect.  He was a gentleman of a\ngood family in Dauphiny; but his wit and merit distinguished him more\nthan his birth: he was well received at Court.  He was graceful in his\nperson, perfect at all sorts of exercises; he sung agreeably, he wrote\nverses, and was of so amorous and gallant a temper, as endeared him to\nMonsieur d'Anville in such a degree, that he made him the confidant of\nhis amours between the Queen-Dauphin and him; this confidence gave him\naccess to that Princess, and it was owing to the frequent opportunities\nhe had of seeing her, that he commenced that unhappy passion which\ndeprived him of his reason, and at last cost him his life.\n\nMonsieur d'Anville did not fail to be at Court in the evening; he\nthought himself very happy, that the Queen-Dauphin had made choice of\nhim to manage an affair she had at heart, and he promised to obey her\ncommands with the greatest exactness.  But the Duchess of Valentinois\nbeing warned of the design in view, had traversed it with so much care,\nand prepossessed the King so much against it, that when Monsieur\nd'Anville came to speak to his Majesty about it, he plainly showed he\ndid not approve of it, and commanded him to signify as much to the\nPrince de Montpensier.  One may easily judge what the sentiments of\nMadam de Chartres were, upon the breaking off of an affair which she\nhad set her mind so much upon, and the ill success of which gave such\nan advantage to her enemies, and was so great a prejudice to her\ndaughter.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin declared to Mademoiselle de Chartres, in a very\nfriendly manner, the uneasiness she was in for not having been able to\nserve her:  \"You see, Madam,\" said she to her, \"that my interest is\nsmall; I am upon so ill terms with the Queen and the Duchess of\nValentinois, that it is no wonder if they or their dependents still\nsucceed in disappointing my desires; nevertheless, I have constantly\nused my endeavours to please them.  Indeed, they hate me not for my own\nsake, but for my mother's; she formerly gave them some jealousy and\nuneasiness; the King was in love with her before he was in love with\nthe Duchess; and in the first years of his marriage, when he had no\nissue, he appeared almost resolved to be divorced from the Queen, in\norder to make room for my mother, though at the same time he had some\naffection for the Duchess.  Madam de Valentinois being jealous of a\nlady whom he had formerly loved, and whose wit and beauty were capable\nof lessening her interest, joined herself to the Constable, who was no\nmore desirous than herself that the King should marry a sister of the\nDuke of Guise; they possessed the deceased King with their sentiments;\nand though he mortally hated the Duchess of Valentinois, and loved the\nQueen, he joined his endeavours with theirs to prevent the divorce; but\nin order to take from the King all thoughts of marrying the Queen my\nmother, they struck up a marriage between her and the King of Scotland,\nwho had had for his first wife the King's sister, and they did this\nbecause it was the easiest to be brought to a conclusion, though they\nfailed in their engagements to the King of England, who was very\ndesirous of marrying her; and that failure wanted but little of\noccasioning a rupture between the two Crowns: for Henry the Eighth was\ninconsolable, when he found himself disappointed in his expectations of\nmarrying my mother; and whatever other Princess of France was proposed\nto him, he always said, nothing could make him amends for her he had\nbeen deprived of.  It is certainly true, that my mother was a perfect\nbeauty; and what is very remarkable, is, that being the widow of the\nDuke of Longueville, three Kings should court her in marriage.  Her ill\nfortune gave her to the least of them, and placed her in a kingdom\nwhere she meets with nothing but trouble. They say I resemble her, but\nI fear I shall resemble her only in her unhappy destiny; and whatever\nfortune may seem to promise me at present, I can never think I shall\nenjoy it.\"\n\nMademoiselle de Chartres answered the Queen, that these melancholy\npresages were so ill-grounded, that they would not disturb her long,\nand that she ought not to doubt but her good fortune would accomplish\nwhatever it promised.\n\nNo one now entertained any further thoughts of Mademoiselle de\nChartres, either fearing to incur the King's displeasure, or despairing\nto succeed with a lady, who aspired to an alliance with a Prince of the\nblood.  The Prince of Cleves alone was not disheartened at either of\nthese considerations; the death of the Duke of Nevers his father, which\nhappened at that time, set him at entire liberty to follow his\ninclination, and no sooner was the time of mourning expired, but he\nwholly applied himself to the gaining of Mademoiselle de Chartres.  It\nwas lucky for him that he addressed her at a time when what had\nhappened had discouraged the approaches of others.  What allayed his\njoy was his fear of not being the most agreeable to her, and he would\nhave preferred the happiness of pleasing to the certainty of marrying\nher without being beloved.\n\nThe Chevalier de Guise had given him some jealousy, but as it was\nrather grounded on the merit of that Prince than on any action of\nMademoiselle de Chartres, he made it his whole endeavour to discover,\nif he was so happy as to have his addresses admitted and approved: he\nhad no opportunity of seeing her but at Court or public assemblies, so\nthat it was very difficult for him to get a private conversation with\nher; at last he found means to do it, and informed her of his intention\nand of his love, with all the respect imaginable.  He urged her to\nacquaint him what the sentiments were which she had for him, assuring\nher, that those which he had for her were of such a nature as would\nrender him eternally miserable, if she resigned herself wholly up to\nthe will of her mother.\n\nAs Mademoiselle de Chartres had a noble and generous heart, she was\nsincerely touched with gratitude for the Prince of Cleves's behaviour;\nthis gratitude gave a certain sweetness to her words and answers,\nsufficient to furnish hopes to a man so desperately enamoured as the\nPrince was, so that he flattered himself in some measure that he should\nsucceed in what he so much wished for.\n\nShe gave her mother an account of this conversation; and Madam de\nChartres told her, that the Prince of Cleves had so many good\nqualities, and discovered a discretion so much above his years, that if\nher inclination led her to marry him, she would consent to it with\npleasure.  Mademoiselle de Chartres made answer, that she observed in\nhim the same good qualities; that she should have less reluctance in\nmarrying him than any other man, but that she had no particular\naffection to his person.\n\nThe next day the Prince caused his thoughts to be communicated to Madam\nde Chartres, who gave her consent to what was proposed to her; nor had\nshe the least distrust but that in the Prince of Cleves she provided\nher daughter a husband capable of securing her affections.  The\narticles were concluded; the King was acquainted with it, and the\nmarriage made public.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves found himself happy, but yet not entirely\ncontented: he saw with a great deal of regret, that the sentiments of\nMademoiselle de Chartres did not exceed those of esteem and respect,\nand he could not flatter himself that she concealed more obliging\nthoughts of him, since the situation they were in permitted her to\ndiscover them without the least violence done to modesty.  It was not\nlong before he expostulated with her on this subject:  \"Is it\npossible,\" says he, \"that I should not be happy in marrying you? and\nyet it is certain, I am not. You only show me a sort of civility which\nis far from giving me satisfaction; you express none of those pretty\ninquietudes, the concern, and impatience, which are the soul of love;\nyou are no further affected with my passion, than you would be with one\nwhich flowed only from the advantage of your fortune, and not from the\nbeauty of your person.\"  \"It is unjust in you to complain,\" replied the\nPrincess, \"I don't know what you can desire of me more; I think decency\nwill not allow me to go further than I do.\"  \"It's true,\" replied he,\n\"you show some appearances I should be satisfied with, were there\nanything beyond; but instead of being restrained by decency, it is that\nonly which makes you act as you do; I am not in your heart and\ninclinations, and my presence neither gives you pain nor pleasure.\"\n\"You can't doubt,\" replied she, \"but it is a sensible pleasure to me to\nsee you, and when I do see you, I blush so often, that you can't doubt,\nbut the seeing you gives me pain also.\"  \"Your blushes, Madam,\" replied\nhe, \"cannot deceive me; they are signs of modesty, but do not prove the\nheart to be affected, and I shall conclude nothing more from hence than\nwhat I ought.\"\n\nMademoiselle de Chartres did not know what to answer; these\ndistinctions were above her comprehension.  The Prince of Cleves\nplainly saw she was far from having that tenderness of affection for\nhim, which was requisite to his happiness; it was manifest she could\nnot feel a passion which she did not understand.\n\nThe Chevalier de Guise returned from a journey a few days before the\nmarriage.  He saw so many insuperable difficulties in his design of\nmarrying Mademoiselle de Chartres, that he gave over all hopes of\nsucceeding in it; and yet he was extremely afflicted to see her become\nthe wife of another: his grief however did not extinguish his passion;\nand his love was as great as ever. Mademoiselle de Chartres was not\nignorant of it; and he made her sensible at his return, that she was\nthe cause of that deep melancholy which appeared in his countenance.\nHe had so much merit and so much agreeableness, that it was almost\nimpossible to make him unhappy without pitying him, nor could she\nforbear pitying him; but her pity did not lead to love.  She acquainted\nher mother with the uneasiness which the Chevalier's passion gave her.\n\nMadam de Chartres admired the honour of her daughter, and she admired\nit with reason, for never was anyone more naturally sincere; but she\nwas surprised, at the same time, at the insensibility of her heart, and\nthe more so, when she found that the Prince of Cleves had not been able\nto affect her any more than others: for this reason, she took great\npains to endear her husband to her, and to make her sensible how much\nshe owed to the affection he had for her before he knew her, and to the\ntenderness he since expressed for her, by preferring her to all other\nmatches, at a time when no one else durst entertain the least thoughts\nof her.\n\nThe marriage was solemnised at the Louvre; and in the evening the King\nand the two Queens, with the whole Court, supped at Madam de Chartres's\nhouse, where they were entertained with the utmost magnificence.  The\nChevalier de Guise durst not distinguish himself by being absent from\nthe ceremony, but he was so little master of himself that it was easy\nto observe his concern.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves did not find that Mademoiselle de Chartres had\nchanged her mind by changing her name; his quality of a husband\nentitled him to the largest privileges, but gave him no greater share\nin the affections of his wife: hence it was, that though he was her\nhusband, he did not cease to be her lover, because he had always\nsomething to wish beyond what he possessed; and though she lived\nperfectly easy with him, yet he was not perfectly happy.  He preserved\nfor her a passion full of violence and inquietude, but without\njealousy, which had no share in his griefs.  Never was husband less\ninclined to it, and never was wife farther from giving the least\noccasion for it.  She was nevertheless constantly in view of the Court;\nshe frequented the Courts of the two Queens, and of Madame: all the\npeople of gallantry saw her both there and at her brother-in-law the\nDuke of Never's, whose house was open to the whole world; but she had\nan air which inspired so great respect, and had in it something so\ndistant from gallantry, that the Mareschal de St. Andre, a bold man and\nsupported by the King's favour, became her lover without daring to let\nher know it any otherwise than by his cares and assiduities.  A great\nmany others were in the same condition: and Madam de Chartres had added\nto her daughter's discretion so exact a conduct with regard to\neverything of decorum, that everybody was satisfied she was not to be\ncome at.\n\nThe Duchess of Loraine, while she was employed in negotiating the\npeace, had applied herself to settle the marriage of the Duke her son:\na marriage was agreed upon between him and Madam Claude of France, the\nKing's second daughter; and the month of February was appointed for the\nnuptials.\n\nIn the meantime the Duke of Nemours continued at Brussels, his thoughts\nbeing wholly employed on his design in England; he was continually\nsending or receiving couriers from thence; his hopes increased every\nday, and at last Lignerolly sent him word that it was time to finish by\nhis presence what was so well begun; he received this news with all the\njoy a young ambitious man is capable of, who sees himself advanced to a\nthrone merely by the force of his personal merit; his mind insensibly\naccustomed itself to the grandeur of a Royal State; and whereas he had\nat first rejected this undertaking as an impracticable thing, the\ndifficulties of it were now worn out of his imagination, and he no\nlonger saw anything to obstruct his way.\n\nHe sent away in haste to Paris to give the necessary orders for\nproviding a magnificent equipage, that he might make his appearance in\nEngland with a splendour suitable to the design he was to conduct; and\nsoon after he followed himself, to assist at the marriage of the Duke\nof Loraine.\n\nHe arrived the evening before the espousals, and that very evening\nwaited on the King to give him an account of his affair, and to receive\nhis orders and advice how to govern himself in it. Afterwards he waited\non the Queens; but the Princess of Cleves was not there, so that she\ndid not see him, nor so much as know of his arrival.  She had heard\neverybody speak of this celebrated Prince, as of the handsomest and\nmost agreeable man at Court; and the Queen-Dauphin had described him in\nsuch a manner, and spoke of him to her so often, that she had raised in\nher a curiosity and even impatience to see him.\n\nThe Princess employed the day of the wedding in dressing herself, that\nshe might appear with the greater advantage at the ball and royal\nbanquet that were to be at the Louvre.  When she came, everyone admired\nboth her beauty and her dress.  The ball began, and while she was\ndancing with the Duke of Guise, a noise was heard at the door of the\nhall, as if way was making for some person of uncommon distinction.\nShe had finished her dance, and as she was casting her eyes round to\nsingle out some other person, the King desired her to take him who came\nin last; she turned about, and viewing him as he was passing over the\nseats to come to the place where they danced, she immediately concluded\nhe was the Duke of Nemours.  The Duke's person was turned in so\ndelicate a manner, that it was impossible not to express surprise at\nthe first sight of him, particularly that evening, when the care he had\ntaken to adorn himself added much to the fine air of his carriage.  It\nwas as impossible to behold the Princess of Cleves without equal\nadmiration.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours was struck with such surprise at her beauty, that\nwhen they approached and paid their respects to each other, he could\nnot forbear showing some tokens of his admiration.  When they begun to\ndance, a soft murmur of praises ran through the whole company.  The\nKing and the two Queens, remembering that the Duke and Princess had\nnever seen one another before, found something very particular in\nseeing them dance together without knowing each other; they called\nthem, as soon as they had ended their dance, without giving them time\nto speak to anybody, and asked them if they had not a desire to know\neach other, and if they were not at some loss about it.  \"As for me,\nMadam,\" said the Duke to the Queen, \"I am under no uncertainty in this\nmatter; but as the Princess of Cleves has not the same reasons to lead\nher to guess who I am, as I have to direct me to know her, I should be\nglad if your Majesty would be pleased to let her know my name.\"  \"I\nbelieve,\" said the Queen-Dauphin, \"that she knows your name as well as\nyou know hers.\"  \"I assure you, Madam,\" replied the Princess a little\nembarrassed, \"that I am not so good a guesser as you imagine.\"  \"Yes,\nyou guess very well,\" answered the Queen-Dauphin; \"and your\nunwillingness to acknowledge that you know the Duke of Nemours, without\nhaving seen him before, carries in it something very obliging to him.\"\nThe Queen interrupted them, that the ball might go on; and the Duke de\nNemours took out the Queen-Dauphin.  This Princess was a perfect\nbeauty, and such she appeared in the eyes of the Duke de Nemours,\nbefore he went to Flanders; but all this evening he could admire\nnothing but Madam de Cleves.\n\nThe Chevalier de Guise, whose idol she still was, sat at her feet, and\nwhat had passed filled him with the utmost grief; he looked upon it as\nominous for him, that fortune had destined the Duke of Nemours to be in\nlove with the Princess of Cleves.  And whether there appeared in\nreality any concern in the Princess's face, or whether the Chevalier's\njealousy only led him to suspect it, he believed that she was touched\nwith the sight of the Duke, and could not forbear telling her, that\nMonsieur de Nemours was very happy to commence an acquaintance with her\nby an incident which had something very gallant and extraordinary in it.\n\nMadam de Cleves returned home with her thoughts full of what had passed\nat the ball; and though it was very late, she went into her mother's\nroom to give her a relation of it; in doing which she praised the Duke\nof Nemours with a certain air, that gave Madam de Chartres the same\nsuspicion the Chevalier de Guise had entertained before.\n\nThe day following the ceremony of the Duke of Loraine's marriage was\nperformed; and there the Princess of Cleves observed so inimitable a\ngrace, and so fine a mien in the Duke of Nemours, that she was yet more\nsurprised.\n\nShe afterwards saw him at the Court of the Queen-Dauphin; she saw him\nplay at tennis with the King; she saw him run the ring; she heard him\ndiscourse; still she found he far excelled everybody else, and drew the\nattention of the company to him wherever he was; in short, the\ngracefulness of his person, and the agreeableness of his wit soon made\na considerable impression on her heart.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours had an inclination no less violent for her; and\nhence flowed all that gaiety and sweetness of behaviour, which the\nfirst desires of pleasing ordinarily inspire a man with: hence he\nbecame more amiable than ever he was before; so that by often seeing\none another, and by seeing in each other whatever was most accomplished\nat Court, it could not be but that they must mutually receive the\ngreatest pleasure from such a commerce.\n\nThe Duchess of Valentinois made one in all parties of pleasure; and the\nKing was still as passionately fond of her as in the beginning of his\nlove.  The Princess of Cleves being at those years, wherein people\nthink a woman is incapable of inciting love after the age of\ntwenty-five, beheld with the utmost astonishment the King's passion for\nthe Duchess, who was a grandmother, and had lately married her\ngranddaughter: she often spoke on this subject to Madam de Chartres.\n\"Is it possible, Madam,\" said she, \"that the King should still continue\nto love?  How could he take a fancy to one, who was so much older than\nhimself, who had been his father's mistress, and who, as I have heard,\nis still such to many others?\"  \"'Tis certain,\" answered Madam de\nChartres,\" it was neither the merit nor the fidelity of the Duchess of\nValentinois, which gave birth to the King's passion, or preserved it;\nand this is what he can't be justified in; for if this lady had had\nbeauty and youth suitable to her birth; and the merit of having had no\nother lover; if she had been exactly true and faithful to the King; if\nshe had loved him with respect only to his person, without the\ninterested views of greatness and fortune, and without using her power\nbut for honourable purposes and for his Majesty's interest; in this\ncase it must be confessed, one could have hardly forbore praising his\npassion for her.  If I was not afraid,\" continued Madam de Chartres,\n\"that you would say the same thing of me which is said of most women of\nmy years, that they love to recount the history of their own times, I\nwould inform you how the King's passion for this Duchess began, and of\nseveral particulars of the Court of the late King, which have a great\nrelation to things that are acted at present.\"  \"Far from blaming you,\"\nreplied the Princess of Cleves, \"for repeating the histories of past\ntimes, I lament, Madam, that you have not instructed me in those of the\npresent, nor informed me as to the different interests and parties of\nthe Court.  I am so entirely ignorant of them, that I thought a few\ndays ago, the Constable was very well with the Queen.\"  \"You was\nextremely mistaken,\" answered Madam de Chartres, \"the Queen hates the\nConstable, and if ever she has power, he'll be but too sensible of it;\nshe knows, he has often told the King, that of all his children none\nresembled him but his natural ones.\"  \"I should never have suspected\nthis hatred,\" said the Princess of Cleves, \"after having seen her\nassiduity in writing to the Constable during his imprisonment, the joy\nshe expressed at his return, and how she always calls him Compere, as\nwell as the King.\"  \"If you judge from appearances in a Court,\" replied\nMadam de Chartres, \"you will often be deceived; truth and appearances\nseldom go together.\n\n\"But to return to the Duchess of Valentinois, you know her name is\nDiana de Poitiers; her family is very illustrious, she is descended\nfrom the ancient Dukes of Aquitaine, her grandmother was a natural\ndaughter of Lewis the XI, and in short she possesses everything that is\ngreat in respect of birth.  St. Valier, her father, had the unhappiness\nto be involved in the affair of the Constable of Bourbon, which you\nhave heard of; he was condemned to lose his head, and accordingly was\nconducted to the scaffold: his daughter, viz., the Duchess, who was\nextremely beautiful, and who had already charmed the late King, managed\nso well, I don't know by what means, that she obtained her father's\nlife; the pardon was brought him at the moment he was expecting the\nfatal blow; but the pardon availed little, for fear had seized him so\ndeeply, that it bereft him of his senses, and he died a few days after.\nHis daughter appeared at Court as the King's mistress; but the Italian\nexpedition, and the imprisonment of the present Prince, were\ninterruptions to his love affair. When the late King returned from\nSpain, and Madam the Regent went to meet him at Bayonne, she brought\nall her maids of honour with her, among whom was Mademoiselle de\nPisselen, who was since Duchess d'Etampes; the King fell in love with\nher, though she was inferior in birth, wit and beauty to the Duchess of\nValentinois, and had no advantage above her but that of being very\nyoung.  I have heard her say several times, that she was born the same\nday Diana de Poitiers was married, but she spoke this in the malice of\nher heart, and not as what she knew to be true; for I am much mistaken,\nif the Duchess of Valentinois did not marry Monsieur de Breze, at the\nsame time that the King fell in love with Madam d'Etampes.  Never was a\ngreater hatred than that between these two ladies; the Duchess could\nnot pardon Madam d'Etampes for having taken from her the title of the\nKing's mistress; and Madam d'Etampes was violently jealous of the\nDuchess, because the King still kept correspondence with her.  That\nPrince was by no means constant to his mistresses; there was always one\namong them that had the title and honours of mistress, but the ladies\nof the small band, as they were styled, shared his favour by turns.\nThe loss of the Dauphin, his son, who died at Tournon, and was thought\nto be poisoned, extremely afflicted him; he had not the same affection\nand tenderness for his second son, the present King; he imagined he did\nnot see in him spirit and vivacity enough, and complained of it one day\nto the Duchess of Valentinois, who told him she would endeavour to\nraise a passion in him for her, in order to make him more sprightly and\nagreeable.  She succeeded in it, as you see, and this passion is now of\nabove twenty years' duration, without being changed either by time or\nincidents.\n\n\"The late King at first opposed it; and whether he had still love\nenough left for the Duchess of Valentinois to be jealous, or whether he\nwas urged on by the Duchess d'Etampes, who was in despair upon seeing\nthe Dauphin so much attached to her enemy, it is certain he beheld this\npassion with an indignation and resentment, that showed itself every\nday by something or other. The Dauphin neither valued his anger or his\nhatred, nor could anything oblige him either to abate or conceal his\nflame, so that the King was forced to accustom himself to bear it with\npatience. This opposition of his to his father's will, withdrew his\naffections from him more and more, and transferred them to his third\nson, the Duke of Orleans, who was a Prince of a fine person full of\nfire and ambition, and of a youthful heat which wanted to be moderated;\nhowever, he would have made a very great Prince, had he arrived to a\nmore ripened age.\n\n\"The rank of eldest, which the Dauphin held, and the King's favour\nwhich the Duke of Orleans was possessed of, created between them a sort\nof emulation, that grew by degrees to hatred. This emulation began from\ntheir infancy, and was still kept up in its height.  When the Emperor\npassed through France, he gave the preference entirely to the Duke of\nOrleans, which the Dauphin resented so bitterly, that while the Emperor\nwas at Chantilli, he endeavoured to prevail with the Constable to\narrest him without waiting for the King's orders, but the Constable\nrefused to do it: however, the King afterwards blamed him for not\nfollowing his son's advice, and when he banished him the Court, that\nwas one of the principal reasons for it.\n\n\"The discord between the two brothers put Madam d'Etampes upon the\nthought of strengthening herself with the Duke of Orleans, in order to\nsupport her power with the King against the Duchess of Valentinois;\naccordingly she succeeded in it, and that young Prince, though he felt\nno emotions of love for her, entered no less into her interest, than\nthe Dauphin was in that of Madam de Valentinois.  Hence rose two\nfactions at Court, of such a nature as you may imagine, but the\nintrigues of them were not confined to the quarrels of women.\n\n\"The Emperor, who continued to have a great friendship for the Duke of\nOrleans, had offered several times to make over to him the Duchy of\nMilan.  In the propositions which were since made for the peace, he\ngave hopes of assigning him the seventeen provinces, with his daughter\nin marriage.  The Dauphin neither approved of the peace or the\nmarriage, and in order to defeat both he made use of the Constable, for\nwhom he always had an affection, to remonstrate to the King of what\nimportance it was not to give his successor a brother so powerful as\nthe Duke of Orleans would be with the alliance of the Emperor and those\ncountries; the Constable came the more easily into the Dauphin's\nsentiments, as they were opposite to those of Madam d'Etampes, who was\nhis declared enemy, and who vehemently wished for the promotion of the\nDuke of Orleans.\n\n\"The Dauphin commanded at that time the King's Army in Champaign, and\nhad reduced that of the Emperor to such extremities, that it must have\nentirely perished, had not the Duchess d'Etampes, for fear too great\nsuccesses should make us refuse peace, and the Emperor's alliance in\nfavour of the Duke of Orleans, secretly advised the enemy to surprise\nEspemai and Cheteau-Thieni, in which places were great magazines of\nprovisions; they succeeded in the attempt, and by that means saved\ntheir whole army.\n\n\"This Duchess did not long enjoy the success of her treason.  A little\nafter the Duke of Orleans died at Farmontiers of a kind of contagious\ndistemper: he was in love with one of the finest women of the Court,\nand was beloved by her.  I will not mention her name, because she has\nsince lived with so much discretion, and has so carefully concealed the\npassion she had for that Prince, that one ought to be tender of her\nreputation.  It happened she received the news of her husband's death\nat the same time as she heard of the Duke's, so that she had that\npretext to enable her to conceal her real sorrow, without being at the\ntrouble of putting any constraint upon herself.\n\n\"The King did not long survive the Prince his son; he died two years\nafter; he recommended to the Dauphin to make use of the Cardinal de\nTournon and the Admiral d'Annebault, but said nothing at all of the\nConstable, who was then in banishment at Chantilli. Nevertheless the\nfirst thing the King his son did was to recall him, and make him his\nPrime Minister.\n\n\"Madam d'Etampes was discarded, and received all the ill treatment she\ncould possibly expect from an enemy so very powerful; the Duchess of\nValentinois amply revenged herself both of that lady, and all those who\nhad disobliged her; she seemed to reign more absolute in the King's\nheart than she did even when he was Dauphin.  During the twelve years'\nreign of this Prince she has been absolute in everything; she disposes\nof all governments and offices of trust and power; she has disgraced\nthe Cardinal de Tournon, the Chancellor, and Villeroy; those who have\nendeavoured to open the King's mind with respect to her conduct, have\nbeen undone in the attempt; the Count de Taix, great Master of the\nOrdnance, who had no kindness for her, could not forbear speaking of\nher gallantries, and particularly of that with the Count de Brissac, of\nwhom the King was already very jealous.  Nevertheless she contrived\nthings so well, that the Count de Taix was disgraced, and his\nemployment taken from him; and what is almost incredible, she procured\nit to be given to the Count de Brissac, and afterwards made him a\nMareschal of France.  Notwithstanding, the King's jealousy increased to\nsuch a height, that lie could no longer suffer him to continue at\nCourt: this passion of jealousy, which is fierce and violent in other\nmen, is gentle and moderate in him through the great respect he has for\nhis mistress, and therefore he did not go about to remove his rival,\nbut under the pretext of giving him the Government of Piemont.  He has\nlived there several years; last winter he returned to Paris, under\npretence of demanding troops and other necessaries for the Army he\ncommands; the desire of seeing the Duchess of Valentinois again, and\nthe fear of being forgotten by her, was perhaps the principal motive of\nthis journey.  The King received him very coldly; Messieurs de Guise,\nwho have no kindness for him, but dare not show it on account of the\nDuchess, made use of Monsieur the Viscount, her declared enemy, to\nprevent his obtaining what he came to demand.  It was no difficult\nmatter to do him hurt. The King hated him, and was uneasy at his\npresence, so that he was obliged to return to Piemont without any\nbenefit from his journey, except perhaps that of rekindling in the\nheart of the Duchess the flame which absence began to extinguish. The\nKing has had a great many other subjects of jealousy, but either he has\nnot been informed of them, or has not dared to complain of them.\n\n\"I don't know, daughter,\" added Madam de Chartres, \"if I have not\nalready told you more of these things, than you desired to know.\"  \"I\nam far, Madam, from complaining of that,\" replied the Princess of\nCleves, \"and if it was not for fear of being importunate, I should yet\ndesire to be informed of several circumstances I am ignorant of.\"\n\nThe Duke de Nemours' passion for Madam de Cleves was at first so\nviolent, that he had no relish left for any of the ladies he paid his\naddresses to before, and with whom he kept a correspondence during his\nabsence; he even lost all remembrance of his engagements with them, and\nnot only made it his business to find out excuses to break with them,\nbut had not the patience to hear their complaints, or make any answer\nto the reproaches they laid upon him.  The Queen-Dauphin herself, for\nwhom his regards had been very tender, could no longer preserve a place\nin that heart which was now devoted to the Princess of Cleves.  His\nimpatience of making a tour to England began to abate, and he showed no\nearnestness in hastening his equipage.  He frequently went to the\nQueen-Dauphin's Court, because the Princess of Cleves was often there,\nand he was very easy in leaving people in the opinion they had of his\npassion for that Queen; he put so great a value on Madam de Cleves,\nthat he resolved to be rather wanting in giving proofs of his love,\nthan to hazard its being publicly known; he did not so much as speak of\nit to the Viscount de Chartres, who was his intimate friend, and from\nwhom he concealed nothing; the truth is, he conducted this affair with\nso much discretion, that nobody suspected he was in love with Madam de\nCleves, except the Chevalier de Guise; and she would scarcely have\nperceived it herself, if the inclination she had for him had not led\nher into a particular attention to all his actions, but which she was\nconvinced of it.\n\nShe no longer continued to have the same disposition to communicate to\nher mother what she thought concerning the Duke de Nemours, as she had\nto talk to her about her other lovers; though she had no settled design\nof concealing it from her, yet she did not speak of it.  Madam de\nChartres, however, plainly perceived the Duke's attachment to her\ndaughter, as well as her daughter's inclination for him; the knowledge\nof this could not but sensibly afflict her, nor could she be ignorant\nof the danger this young lady was in, in being beloved by, and loving\nso accomplished a person as the Duke de Nemours: she was entirely\nconfirmed in the suspicion she had of this business, by an incident\nwhich fell out a few days after.\n\nThe Mareschal de St. Andre, who took all opportunities to show his\nmagnificence, desired the King, under pretence of showing him his house\nwhich was just finished, to do him the honour to sup there with the two\nQueens.  The Mareschal was also very glad to display, in the sight of\nthe Princess of Cleves, that splendid and expensive manner of life,\nwhich he carried to so great a profusion.\n\nSome days before that appointed for the entertainment, the Dauphin, who\nhad an ill state of health, found himself indisposed, and saw nobody;\nthe Queen-Dauphin had spent all that day with him; and in the evening,\nupon his growing better, all the persons of quality that were in the\nanti-chamber were admitted; the Queen-Dauphin returned to her own\napartment, where she found Madam de Cleves and some other ladies, with\nwhom she lived in familiarity.\n\nIt being already very late, and not being dressed, she did not wait\nupon the Queen, but gave out that she was not to be seen, and ordered\nher jewels to be brought, in order to choose out some for the Mareschal\nde St. Andre's Ball, and present the Princess of Cleves with some, as\nshe had promised her.  While they were thus employed, the Prince of\nConde entered; his great quality gave him free access everywhere.\n\"Doubtless,\" said the Queen-Dauphin, \"you come from the King my\nhusband, what are they doing there?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"they are maintaining a dispute against the Duke of\nNemours, and he defends the argument he undertook with so much warmth,\nthat he must needs be very much interested in it; I believe he has some\nmistress that gives him uneasiness by going to balls, so well satisfied\nhe is that it is a vexatious thing to a lover to see the person he\nloves in those places.\"\n\n\"How,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin, \"would not the Duke de Nemours have\nhis mistress go to a ball?  I thought that husbands might wish their\nwives would not go there; but as for lovers, I never imagined they were\nof that opinion.\"  \"The Duke de Nemours finds,\" answered the Prince of\nConde, \"that nothing is so insupportable to lovers as balls, whether\nthey are beloved again, or whether they are not.  He says, if they are\nbeloved they have the chagrin to be loved the less on this account for\nseveral days; that there is no woman, whom her anxiety for dress does\nnot divert from thinking on her lover; that they are entirely taken up\nwith that one circumstance, that this care to adorn themselves is for\nthe whole world, as well as for the man they favour; that when they are\nat a ball, they are desirous to please all who look at them; and that\nwhen they triumph in their beauty, they experience a joy to which their\nlovers very little contribute.  He argues further, that if one is not\nbeloved, it is a yet greater torment to see one's mistress at an\nassembly; that the more she is admired by the public, the more unhappy\none is not to be beloved, and that the lover is in continual fear lest\nher beauty should raise a more successful passion than his own; lastly\nhe finds, there is no torment equal to that of seeing one's mistress at\na ball, unless it be to know that she is there, and not to be there\none's self.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves pretended not to hear what the Prince of Conde said,\nthough she listened very attentively; she easily saw what part she had\nin the Duke of Nemours's opinion, and particularly as to what he said\nof the uneasiness of not being at a ball where his mistress was,\nbecause he was not to be at that of the Mareschal de St. Andre, the\nKing having sent him to meet the Duke of Ferrara.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin, and the Prince of Conde, not going into the Duke's\nopinion, were very merry upon the subject.  \"There is but one occasion,\nMadam,\" said the Prince to her, \"in which the Duke will consent his\nmistress should go to a ball, and that is when he himself gives it.  He\nsays, that when he gave your Majesty one last year, his mistress was so\nkind as to come to it, though seemingly only to attend you; that it is\nalways a favour done to a lover, to partake of an entertainment which\nhe gives; that it is an agreeable circumstance for him to have his\nmistress see him preside in a place where the whole Court is, and see\nhim acquit himself well in doing the honours of it.\"  \"The Duke de\nNemours was in the right,\" said the Queen-Dauphin, smiling, \"to approve\nof his mistress's being at his own ball; there was then so great a\nnumber of ladies, whom he honoured with the distinction of that name,\nthat if they had not come, the assembly would have been very thin.\"\n\nThe Prince of Conde had no sooner begun to relate the Duke de Nemours's\nsentiments concerning assemblies, but Madam de Cleves felt in herself a\nstrong aversion to go to that of the Mareschal de St. Andre.  She\neasily came into the opinion, that a woman ought not to be at an\nentertainment given by one that professed love to her, and she was very\nglad to find out a reason of reservedness for doing a thing which would\noblige the Duke of Nemours.  However, she carried away with her the\nornaments which the Queen-Dauphin had given her; but when she showed\nthem her mother, she told her that she did not design to make use of\nthem; that the Mareschal de St. Andre took a great deal of pains to\nshow his attachment to her, and she did not doubt he would be glad to\nhave it believed that a compliment was designed her in the\nentertainment he gave the King, and that under the pretence of doing\nthe honours of his house, he would show her civilities which would be\nuneasy to her.\n\nMadam de Chartres for some time opposed her daughter's opinion, as\nthinking it very singular; but when she saw she was obstinate in it,\nshe gave way, and told her, that in that case she ought to pretend an\nindisposition as an excuse for not going to the ball, because the real\nreasons which hindered her would not be approved of; and care ought to\nbe taken that they should not be suspected.\n\nMadam de Cleves voluntarily consented to pass some days at her\nmother's, in order not to go to any place where the Duke of Nemours was\nnot to be.  However the Duke set out, without the pleasure of knowing\nshe would not be at the ball.\n\nThe day after the ball he returned, and was informed that she was not\nthere; but as he did not know the conversation he had at the Dauphin's\nCourt had been repeated to her, he was far from thinking himself happy\nenough to have been the reason of her not going.\n\nThe day after, while he was at the Queen's apartments, and talking to\nthe Queen-Dauphin, Madam de Chartres and Madam de Cleves came in.\nMadam de Cleves was dressed a little negligently, as a person who had\nbeen indisposed, but her countenance did not at all correspond with her\ndress.  \"You look so pretty,\" says the Queen-Dauphin to her, \"that I\ncan't believe you have been ill; I think the Prince of Conde, when he\ntold us the Duke de Nemours's opinion of the ball, persuaded you, that\nto go there would be doing a favour to the Mareschal de St. Andre, and\nthat that's the reason which hindered you from going.\"  Madam de Cleves\nblushed, both because the Queen-Dauphin had conjectured right, and\nbecause she spoke her conjecture in the presence of the Duke de Nemours.\n\nMadam de Chartres immediately perceived the true reason, why her\ndaughter refused to go to the ball; and to prevent the Duke de Nemours\ndiscovering it, as well as herself, she took up the discourse after a\nmanner that gave what she said an air of truth.\n\n\"I assure you, Madam,\" said she to the Queen-Dauphin, \"that your\nMajesty has done my daughter more honour than she deserves; she was\nreally indisposed, but I believe, if I had not hindered her, she would\nnot have failed to wait on you, and to show herself under any\ndisadvantages, for the pleasure of seeing what there was extraordinary\nat yesterday's entertainment.\"  The Queen-Dauphin gave credit to what\nMadam de Chartres said but the Duke de Nemours was sorry to find so\nmuch probability in it nevertheless, the blushes of the Princess of\nCleves made him suspect, that what the Queen-Dauphin had said was not\naltogether false.  The Princess of Cleves at first was concerned the\nDuke had any room to believe it was he who had hindered her from going\nto the Mareschal de St. Andre; but afterwards she was a little\nchagrined that her mother had entirely taken off the suspicion of it.\n\nThough the Congress of Cercamp had been broken off, the negotiations\nfor the peace were continued, and things were so disposed, that towards\nthe latter end of February the conferences were reassumed at\nChateau-Cambresis; the same plenipotentiaries were sent as before, and\nthe Mareschal de St. Andre being one, his absence freed the Duke de\nNemours from a rival, who was formidable rather from his curiosity in\nobserving those who addressed to Madam de Cleves, than from any\nadvances he was capable of making himself in her favour.\n\nMadam de Chartres was not willing to let her daughter see that she knew\nher sentiments for the Duke, for fear of making herself suspected in\nsome things which she was very desirous to tell her.\n\nOne day she set herself to talk about him, and a great deal of good she\nsaid of him, but mixed with it abundance of sham praises, as the\nprudence he showed in never falling in love, and how wise he was to\nmake the affair of women and love an amusement instead of a serious\nbusiness:  \"It is not,\" added she, \"that he is not suspected to have a\nvery uncommon passion for the Queen-Dauphin; I observe he visits her\nvery often; and I advise you to avoid, as much as possible, speaking to\nhim, and especially in private; because, since the Queen-Dauphin treats\nyou as she does, it would be said, that you are their confidant; and\nyou know how disagreeable that sort of reputation is: I'm of opinion,\nif this report continues, that you should not visit the Queen-Dauphin\nso often, in order to avoid involving yourself in adventures of\ngallantry.\"\n\nThe Princess of Cleves had never heard before of the amour between the\nDuke de Nemours and the Queen-Dauphin; she was so much surprised at\nwhat her mother had told her, and seemed to see so plainly how she had\nbeen mistaken in her thoughts about the Duke, that she changed\ncountenance.  Madam de Chartres perceived it.  Visitors came in that\nmoment; and the Princess of Cleves retired to her own apartment, and\nshut herself up in her closet.\n\nOne can't express the grief she felt to discover, by what her mother\nhad been just saying, the interest her heart had in the Duke de\nNemours; she had not dared as yet to acknowledge it to her secret\nthoughts; she then found, that the sentiments she had for him were such\nas the Prince of Cleves had required of her; she perceived how shameful\nit was to entertain them for another, and not for a husband that\ndeserved them; she found herself under the utmost embarrassment, and\nwas dreadfully afraid lest the Duke should make use of her only as a\nmeans to come at the Queen-Dauphin, and it was this thought determined\nher to impart to her mother something she had not yet told her.\n\nThe next morning she went into her mother's chamber to put her resolves\nin execution, but she found Madam de Chartres had some touches of a\nfever, and therefore did not think proper to speak to her: this\nindisposition however appeared to insignificant, that Madam de Cleves\nmade no scruple after dinner to visit the Queen-Dauphin; she was in her\ncloset with two or three ladies of her most familiar acquaintance.  \"We\nwere speaking,\" said she to her, as soon as she saw her, \"of the Duke\nde Nemours, and were admiring how much he's changed since his return\nfrom Brussels; before he went there, he had an infinite number of\nmistresses, and it was his own fault, for he showed an equal regard to\nthose who had merit, and to those who had none; since his return he\nneither knows the one nor the other; there never was so great a change;\nI find his humour is changed too, and that he is less gay than he used\nto be.\"\n\nThe Princess of Cleves made no answer; and it shocked her to think she\nshould have taken all that they said of the change in the Duke for\nproofs of his passion for her, had she not been undeceived; she felt in\nherself some little resentment against the Queen-Dauphin, for\nendeavouring to find out reasons, and seeming surprised at a thing,\nwhich she probably knew more of than anyone else; she could not forbear\nshowing something of it; and when the other ladies withdrew, she came\nup and told her in a low voice, \"And is it I, Madam, you have been\npointing at, and have you a mind to conceal, that you are she who has\nmade such an alteration in the conduct of the Duke of Nemours?\"  \"You\ndo me injustice,\" answered the Queen-Dauphin, \"you know I conceal\nnothing from you; it is true the Duke of Nemours, before he went to\nBrussels, had, I believe, an intention to let me know he did not hate\nme; but since his return, it has not so much as appeared that he\nremembers anything of what he has done; and I acknowledge I have a\ncuriosity to know what it is has changed him so: it would not be very\ndifficult for me to unravel this affair,\" added she; \"the Viscount de\nChartres, his intimate friend, is in love with a lady with whom I have\nsome power, and I'll know by that means the occasion of this\nalteration.\"  The Queen-Dauphin spoke with an air of sincerity which\nconvinced the Princess of Cleves, and in spite of herself she found her\nmind in a more calm and pleasing situation than it had been in before.\n\nWhen she returned to her mother, she heard she was a great deal worse\nthan she had left her; her fever was redoubled, and the days following\nit increased to so great a degree, that she was thought to be in\ndanger.  Madam de Cleves was in extreme grief on this occasion, and\nnever stirred out of her mother's chamber. The Prince of Cleves was\nthere too almost every day and all day long, partly out of affection to\nMadam de Chartres, and partly to hinder his lady from abandoning\nherself to sorrow, but chiefly that he might have the pleasure of\nseeing her, his passion not being at all diminished.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours, who had always had a great friendship for the\nPrince of Cleves, had not failed to show it since his return from\nBrussels; during the illness of Madam de Chartres he frequently found\nmeans to see the Princess of Cleves, pretending to want her husband, or\nto come to take him out to walk; he enquired for him at such hours as\nhe knew very well he was not at home, and under pretence of waiting for\nhim stayed in Madam de Cleves's anti-chamber, where there were always a\ngreat many people of quality; Madam de Cleves often came there, and her\ngrief did not make her seem less handsome in the eyes of the Duke de\nNemours; he made her sensible what interest he had in her affliction,\nand spoke to her with so submissive an air, that he easily convinced\nher, that the Queen-Dauphin was not the person he was in love with.\n\nThe seeing him at once gave her grief and pleasure; but when she no\nlonger saw him, and reflected that the charm he carried about him when\npresent, was an introduction to love, she was very near imagining she\nhated him, out of the excessive grief which that thought gave her.\n\nMadam de Chartres still grew worse and worse, so that they began to\ndespair of her life; she heard what the physicians told her concerning\nthe danger she was in with a courage worthy her virtue, and her piety.\nAfter they were gone, she caused everybody to retire, and sent for\nMadam de Cleves.\n\n\"We must part, my dear daughter,\" said she, stretching out her hand to\nher; \"the danger I leave you in, and the occasion you have for me, adds\nto the regret I have to leave you: you have a passion for the Duke de\nNemours; I do not desire you to confess it; I am no longer in a\ncondition to make use of that sincerity for your good; I have perceived\nthis inclination a great while, but was not willing to speak to you of\nit at first, for fear of making you discover it yourself; you know it\nat present but too well; you are upon the brink of a precipice; great\nefforts must be used, and you must do great violence to your heart to\nsave yourself: reflect what you owe to your husband; reflect what you\nowe to yourself, and think that you are going to lose that reputation\nwhich you have gained, and which I have so much at heart; call up, my\ndear daughter, all your courage and constancy; retire from Court;\noblige your husband to carry you away; do not be afraid of taking such\nresolutions, as being too harsh and difficult; however frightful they\nmay appear at first, they will become more pleasant in time, than the\nmisfortunes that follow gallantry: if any other motives than those of\nduty and virtue could have weight with you, I should tell you that if\nanything were capable of disturbing the happiness I hope for in the\nnext world, it would be to see you fall like other women; but if this\ncalamity must necessarily happen, I shall meet death with joy, as it\nwill hinder me from being a witness of it.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves bathed with tears her mother's hand, which she held\nfast locked in her own; nor was Madam de Chartres less moved.  \"Adieu,\ndear daughter,\" said she, \"let us put an end to a conversation which\nmelts us both; and remember, if you are able, all that I have been\nsaying to you.\"\n\nWhen she had spoke this, she turned herself on the other side, and\nordered her daughter to call her women, being unwilling either to hear\nher reply, or to speak any more.  Madam de Cleves went out of her\npresence in a condition one need not describe; and Madam de Chartres\nthought of nothing but preparing herself for death: she lived two days\nlonger, during which she would not see her daughter again; her daughter\nwas the only thing she had reluctance to part with.\n\nMadam de Cleves was in the utmost affliction; her husband did not leave\nher, and no sooner was her mother expired, but he carried her into the\ncountry, that she might not have in her eye a place which could serve\nonly to sharpen her sorrow, which was scarce to be equalled.  Though\ntenderness and gratitude had the greatest share in her griefs, yet the\nneed which she found she had of her mother to guard her against the\nDuke of Nemours added no small weight to them; she found she was\nunhappy in being left to herself, at a time when she was so little\nmistress of her own affections, and when she so much wished for\nsomebody to pity and encourage her.  The Prince of Cleves's behaviour\nto her on this occasion, made her wish more ardently than ever, never\nto fail in her duty to him; she also expressed more friendship and\naffection for him than she had done before; she would not suffer him to\nleave her, and she seemed to think that his being constantly with her\ncould defend her against the Duke of Nemours.\n\nThe Duke came to see the Prince of Cleves in the country; he did what\nhe could to pay a visit also to Madam de Cleves, but she refused to\nreceive him; and being persuaded she could not help finding something\ndangerously lovely in him, she made a strong resolution to forbear\nseeing him, and to avoid all occasions of it that were in her power.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves went to Paris to make his Court, and promised his\nlady to return the next day, but however he did not return till the day\nafter.  \"I expected you yesterday,\" said Madam de Cleves to him on his\narrival, \"and I ought to chide you for not having come as you promised;\nyou know, if I was capable of feeling a new affliction in the condition\nI am in, it would be the death of Madam de Tournon, and I have heard of\nit this morning; I should have been concerned, though I had not known\nher; it is a melting consideration to think that a lady so young and\nhandsome as she, should be dead in two days; but besides, she was the\nperson in the world that pleased me most, and who appeared to have\ndiscretion equal to her beauty.\"\n\n\"I am sorry I could not return yesterday,\" replied the Prince of\nCleves, \"but my presence was so necessary to the consolation of an\nunhappy man, that it was impossible for me to leave him. As for Madam\nde Tournon, I do not advise you not to be concerned for her, if you\nlament her as a woman full of discretion, and worthy of your esteem.\"\n\"You surprise me,\" answered Madam de Cleves, \"I have heard you say\nseveral times, that there was not a lady at Court you had  a greater\nrespect for.\"  \"It is true,\" replied he, \"but women are\nincomprehensible, and when I have seen them all, I think myself so\nhappy in having you, that I cannot enough admire my good fortune.\"\n\"You esteem me more than I deserve,\" answered Madam de Cleves, \"you\nhave not had experience enough yet to pronounce me worthy of you; but\ntell me, I beseech you, what it is has undeceived you with respect to\nMadam de Tournon.\"  \"I have been undeceived a great while,\" replied he,\n\"and I know that she was in love with the Count de Sancerre, and that\nshe gave him room to hope she would marry him.\"  \"I can't believe,\"\nsaid Madam de Cleves, \"that Madam de Tournon, after so extraordinary an\naversion as she has shown to marriage from the time she became a widow,\nand after the public declarations she has made that she would never\nmarry again, should give hopes to Sancerre.\"  \"If she had given hopes\nto him only,\" replied the Prince of Cleves, \"the wonder had not been so\ngreat; but what is surprising is, that she gave hopes likewise to\nEtouteville at the same time:  I'll let you know the whole history of\nthis matter.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\n\"You know the friendship, there is betwixt Sancerre and me.\nNevertheless about two years ago he fell in love with Madam de Tournon,\nand concealed it from me with as much care as from the rest of the\nworld; I had not the least suspicion of it.  Madam de Tournon as yet\nappeared inconsolable for the death of her husband, and lived in\nretirement with great austerity. Sancerre's sister was in a manner the\nonly person she saw, and it was at her lodgings he became in love with\nher.\n\n\"One evening there was to be play at the Louvre, and the actors only\nwaited for the coming of the King and Madam de Valentinois, when word\nwas brought that she was indisposed, and that the King would not come.\nIt was easy to see that the Duchess's indisposition was nothing but\nsome quarrel with the King; everyone knew the jealousy he had had of\nthe Mareschal de Brisac during his continuance at Court, but he had\nbeen set out some days on his return to Piemont, and one could not\nimagine what was the occasion of this falling out.\n\n\"While I was speaking of this to Sancerre, Monsieur d'Anville came into\nthe room, and told me in a whisper, that the King was so exasperated\nand so afflicted at the same time, that one would pity him; that upon a\nlate reconciliation between him and the Duchess, after the quarrel they\nhad had about the Mareschal de Brisac, he had given her a ring, and\ndesired her to wear it; and that as she was dressing herself to come to\nthe play, he had missed it on her finger, and asked what was become of\nit; upon which she seemed in surprise that she had it not, and called\nto her women for it, who unfortunately, or for want of being better\ninstructed, made answer they had not seen it four or five days.\n\n\"It was,\" continued Monsieur d'Anville, \"precisely so long, since the\nMareschal de Brisac left the Court, and the King made no doubt but she\ngave him the ring when she took her leave of him.  The thought of this\nawaked in so lively a manner that jealousy which was not yet\nextinguished, that he fell into uncommon transports, and loaded her\nwith a thousand reproaches; he is just gone into her apartment again in\ngreat concern, but whether the reason is a more confirmed opinion that\nthe Duchess had made a sacrifice of the ring, or for fear of having\ndisobliged her by his anger, I can't tell.\n\n\"As soon as Monsieur d'Anville had told me this news, I acquainted\nSancerre with it; I told it him as a secret newly entrusted with me,\nand charged him to say nothing of it.\n\n\"The next day I went early in the morning to my sister-in-law's, and\nfound Madam de Tournon at her bedside, who had no great kindness for\nthe Duchess of Valentinois, and knew very well that my sister-in-law\nhad no reason to be satisfied with her. Sancerre had been with her,\nafter he went from the play, and had acquainted her with the quarrel\nbetween the King and the Duchess; and Madam de Tournon was come to tell\nit to my sister-in-law, without knowing or suspecting that it was I\nfrom whom her lover had it.\n\n\"As soon as I advanced toward my sister-in-law, she told Madam de\nTournon, that they might trust me with what she had been telling her;\nand without waiting Madam de Tournon's leave she related to me word by\nword all I had told Sancerre the night before.  You may judge what\nsurprise I was in; I looked hard at Madam de Tournon, and she seemed\ndisordered; her disorder gave me a suspicion.  I had told the thing to\nnobody but Sancerre; he left me when the comedy was done, without\ngiving any reason for it; I remembered to have heard him speak much in\npraise of Madam de Tournon; all these things opened my eyes, and I\neasily discerned there was an intrigue between them, and that he had\nseen her since he left me.\n\n\"I was so stung to find he had concealed this adventure from me, that I\nsaid several things which made Madam de Tournon sensible of the\nimprudence she had been guilty of; I led her back to her coach, and\nassured her, I envied the happiness of him who informed her of the\nKing's quarrel with the Duchess of Valentinois.\n\n\"I went immediately in search of Sancerre, and severely reproached him;\nI told him I knew of his passion for Madam de Tournon, without saying\nhow I came by the discovery; he was forced to acknowledge it; I\nafterwards informed him what led me into the knowledge of it, and he\nacquainted me with the detail of the whole affair; he told me, that\nthough he was a younger brother, and far from being able to pretend to\nso good a match, nevertheless she was determined to marry him.  I can't\nexpress the surprise I was in; I told Sancerre he would do well to\nhasten the conclusion of the marriage, and that there was nothing he\nhad not to fear from a woman who had the artifice to support, in the\neye of the public, appearances so distant from truth; he gave me in\nanswer that she was really concerned for the loss of her husband, but\nthat the inclination she had for him had surmounted that affliction,\nand that she could not help discovering all on a sudden so great a\nchange; he mentioned besides several other reasons in her excuse, which\nconvinced me how desperately he was in love; he assured me he would\nbring her to consent that I should know his passion for her, especially\nsince it was she herself who had made me suspect it; in a word, he did\noblige her to it, though with a great deal of difficulty, and I grew\nafterwards very deep in their confidence.\n\n\"I never knew a lady behave herself in so genteel and agreeable a\nmanner to her lover, but yet I was always shocked at the affectation\nshe showed in appearing so concerned for the loss of her husband.\nSancerre was so much in love, and so well pleased with the treatment he\nreceived from her, that he scarce durst press her to conclude the\nmarriage, for fear she should think he desired it rather out of\ninterest than love; however he spoke to her of it, and she seemed fully\nbent on marrying him; she began also to abandon her reserved manner of\nlife, and to appear again in public; she visited my sister-in-law at\nhours when some of the Court were usually there; Sancerre came there\nbut seldom, but those who came every night, and frequently saw her\nthere, thought her extremely beautiful.\n\n\"She had not long quitted her solitude, when Sancerre imagined that her\npassion for him was cooled; he spoke of it several times to me: but I\nlaid no great stress on the matter; but at last, when he told me, that\ninstead of forwarding the marriage, she seemed to put it off, I began\nto think he was not to blame for being uneasy: I remonstrated to him,\nthat if Madam de Tournon's passion was abated after having continued\ntwo years, he ought not to be surprised at it, and that even supposing\nit was not abated, possibly it might not be strong enough to induce her\nto marry him; that he ought not to complain of it; that such a marriage\nin the judgment of the public would draw censures upon her, not only\nbecause he was not a suitable match for her, but also on account of the\nprejudice it would do her reputation; that therefore all he could\ndesire was, that she might not deceive him, nor lead him into false\nexpectations; I told him further, that if she had not resolution enough\nto marry him, or if she confessed she liked some other person better,\nhe ought not to resent or be angry at it, but still continue his esteem\nand regard for her.\n\n\"I give you,\" said I, \"the advice which I would take myself; for\nsincerity has such charms to me, that I believe if my mistress, or even\nmy wife ingenuously confessed, she had a greater affection for another\nthan for me, I might be troubled, but not exasperated; I would lay\naside the character of a lover or a husband, to bestow my advice and my\npity.\"\n\nThis discourse made Madam de Cleves blush, and she found in it a\ncertain similitude of her own condition, which very much surprised her,\nand gave her a concern, from which she could not recover in a great\nwhile.\n\n\"Sancerre spoke to Madam de Tournon,\" continued Monsieur de Cleves,\n\"and told her all I had advised him; but she encouraged him with so\nmany fresh assurances, and seemed so displeased at his suspicions, that\nshe entirely removed them; nevertheless she deferred the marriage until\nafter a pretty long journey he was to make; but she behaved herself so\nwell until his departure, and appeared so concerned at it, that I\nbelieved as well as he, that she sincerely loved him.  He set out about\nthree months ago; during his absence I have seldom seen Madam de\nTournon; you have entirely taken me up, and I only knew that he was\nspeedily expected.\n\n\"The day before yesterday, on my arrival at Paris, I heard she was\ndead; I sent to his lodgings to enquire if they had any news of him,\nand word was brought me he came to town the night before, which was\nprecisely the day that Madam de Tournon died; I immediately went to see\nhim, concluding in what condition I should find him, but his affliction\nfar surpassed what I had imagined.\n\n\"Never did I see a sorrow so deep and so tender; the moment he saw me\nhe embraced me with tears; 'I shall never see her more,' said he, 'I\nshall never see her more, she is dead, I was not worthy of her, but I\nshall soon follow her.'\n\n\"After this he was silent; and then, from time to time, continually\nrepeating 'She is dead, I shall never see her more,' he returned to\nlamentations and tears, and continued as a man bereft of reason.  He\ntold me he had not often received letters from her during his absence,\nbut that he knew her too well to be surprised at it, and was sensible\nhow shy and timorous she was of writing; he made no doubt but she would\nhave married him upon his return; he considered her as the most amiable\nand constant of her sex; he thought himself tenderly beloved by her; he\nlost her the moment he expected to be united to her for ever; all these\nthoughts threw him into so violent an affliction, that I own I was\ndeeply touched with it.\n\n\"Nevertheless I was obliged to leave him to go to the King, but\npromised to return immediately; accordingly I did, and I was never so\nsurprised as I was to find him entirely changed from what I had left\nhim; he was standing in his chamber, his face full of fury, sometimes\nwalking, sometimes stopping short, as if he had been distracted;\n'Come,' says he, 'and see the most forlorn wretch in the world; I am a\nthousand times more unhappy than I was a while ago, and what I have\njust heard of Madam de Tournon is worse than her death.'\n\n\"I took what he said to be wholly the effect of grief, and could not\nimagine that there could be anything worse than the death of a mistress\none loves and is beloved by; I told him, that so far as he kept his\ngrief within bounds, I approved of it, and bore a part in it; but that\nI should no longer pity him, if he abandoned himself to despair and\nflew from reason.  'I should be too happy if I had lost both my reason\nand my life,' cried he; 'Madam de Tournon was false to me, and I am\ninformed of her unfaithfulness and treachery the very day after I was\ninformed of her death; I am informed of it at a time when my soul is\nfilled with the most tender love, and pierced with the sharpest grief\nthat ever was; at a time when the idea of her in my heart, is that of\nthe most perfect woman who ever lived, and the most perfect with\nrespect to me; I find I am mistaken, and that she does not deserve to\nbe lamented by me; nevertheless I have the same concern for her death,\nas if she had been true to me, and I have the same sensibility of her\nfalsehood, as if she were yet living; had I heard of her falsehood\nbefore her death, jealousy, anger, and rage would have possessed me,\nand in some measure hardened me against the grief for her loss; but now\nmy condition is such, that I am incapable of receiving comfort, and yet\nknow not how to hate her.'\n\n\"You may judge of the surprise I was in at what Sancerre told me; I\nasked him how he came by the knowledge of it, and he told me that the\nminute I went away from him, Etouteville, who is his intimate friend,\nbut who nevertheless knew nothing of his love for Madam de Tournon,\ncame to see him; that as soon as he was sat down, he fell a-weeping,\nand asked his pardon for having concealed from him what he was going to\ntell him, that he begged him to have compassion of him, that he was\ncome to open his heart to him, and that he was the person in the world\nthe most afflicted for the death of Madam de Tournon.\n\n\"'That name,' said Sancerre, 'so astonished me, that though my first\nintention was to tell him I was more afflicted than he, I had not the\npower to speak: he continued to inform me, that he had been in love\nwith her six months, that he was always desirous to let me know it, but\nshe had expressly forbid him; and in so authoritative a manner, that he\ndurst not disobey her; that he gained her in a manner as soon as he\ncourted her, that they concealed their mutual passion for each other\nfrom the whole world, that he never visited her publicly, that he had\nthe pleasure to remove her sorrow for her husband's death, and that\nlastly he was to have married her at the very juncture in which she\ndied; but that this marriage, which was an effect of love, would have\nappeared in her an effect of duty and obedience, she having prevailed\nupon her father to lay his commands on her to marry him, in order to\navoid the appearance of too great an alteration in her conduct, which\nhad seemed so averse to a second marriage.'\n\n\"'While Etouteville was speaking to me,' said Sancerre, 'I believed all\nhe said, because I found so much probability in it, and because the\ntime when he told me his passion for Madam de Tournon commenced, is\nprecisely the same with that when she appeared changed towards me; but\nthe next morning I thought him a liar, or at least an enthusiast, and\nwas upon the point of telling him so.  Afterwards I came into an\ninclination of clearing up the matter, and proposed several questions,\nand laid my doubts before him, in a word, I proceeded so far to\nconvince myself of my misfortune, that he asked me if I knew Madam de\nTournon's handwriting, and with that threw upon my bed four letters of\nhers and her picture; my brother came in that minute; Etouteville's\nface was so full of tears, that he was forced to withdraw to avoid\nbeing observed, and said he would come again in the evening to fetch\nwhat he left with me; and as for me, I sent my brother away under\npretence of being indisposed, so impatient was I to see the letters he\nhad left, and so full of hopes to find something there that might make\nme disbelieve what Etouteville had been telling me; but alas!  What did\nI not find there?  What tenderness! what assurances of marriage! what\nletters!  She never wrote the like to me.  Thus,' continued he, 'am I\nat once pierced with anguish for her death and for her falsehood, two\nevils which have been often compared, but never felt before by the same\nperson at the same time; I confess, to my shame, that still I am more\ngrieved for her loss than for her change; I cannot think her guilty\nenough, to consent to her death: were she living, I should have the\nsatisfaction to reproach her, and to revenge myself on her by making\nher sensible of her injustice; but I shall see her no more, I shall see\nher no more; this is the greatest misfortune of all others; would I\ncould restore her to life, though with the loss of my own!  Yet what do\nI wish!  If she were restored to life, she would live for Etouteville:\nhow happy was I yesterday,' cried he, 'how happy!  I was the most\nafflicted man in the world; but my affliction was reasonable, and there\nwas something pleasing in the very thought that I was inconsolable;\ntoday all my sentiments are unjust; I pay to a feigned passion the\ntribute of my grief, which I thought I owed to a real one; I can\nneither hate nor love her memory; I am incapable of consolation, and\nyet don't know how to grieve for her; take care, I conjure you, that I\nnever see Etouteville; his very name raises horror in me; I know very\nwell I have no reason of complaint against him; I was to blame in\nconcealing from him my love for Madam de Tournon; if he had known it,\nperhaps he would not have pursued her, perhaps she would not have been\nfalse to me; he came to me to impart his sorrows, and I cannot but pity\nhim; alas! he had reason to love Madam de Tournon, he was beloved by\nher, and will never see her more: notwithstanding I perceive I can't\nhelp hating him; once more I conjure you take care I may not see him.'\n\n\"Sancerre burst afterwards into tears, began again to regret Madam de\nTournon, and to speak to her, as if she were present, and say the\nsoftest things in the world; from these transports he passed to hatred,\nto complaints, to reproaches and imprecations against her.  When I saw\nhim in so desperate a condition, I found I should want somebody to\nassist me in appeasing his mind; accordingly I sent for his brother,\nwhom I had left with the King; I met him in the anti-chamber, and\nacquainted him with Sancerre's condition: we gave the necessary orders\nto prevent his seeing Etouteville, and employed part of the night in\nendeavouring to make him capable of reason; this morning I found him\nyet more afflicted; his brother continued with him, and I returned to\nyou.\"\n\n\"'Tis impossible to be more surprised than I am,\" said Madam de Cleves;\n\"I thought Madam de Tournon equally incapable of love and falsehood.\"\n\"Address and dissimulation,\" replied Monsieur de Cleves, \"cannot go\nfurther than she carried them; observe, that when Sancerre thought her\nlove to him was abated, it really was, and she began to love\nEtouteville; she told the last that he removed her sorrow for her\nhusband's death, and that he was the cause of her quitting her\nretirement; Sancerre believed the cause was nothing but a resolution\nshe had taken not to seem any longer to be in such deep affliction; she\nmade a merit to Etouteville of concealing her correspondence with him,\nand of seeming forced to marry him by her father's command, as if it\nwas an effect of the care she had of her reputation; whereas it was\nonly an artifice to forsake Sancerre, without his having reason to\nresent it: I must return,\" continued Monsieur de Cleves, \"to see this\nunhappy man, and I believe you would do well to go to Paris too; it is\ntime for you to appear in the world again, and receive the numerous\nvisits which you can't well dispense with.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves agreed to the proposal, and returned to Paris the next\nday; she found herself much more easy with respect to the Duke de\nNemours than she had been; what her mother had told her on her\ndeath-bed, and her grief for her death, created a sort of suspension in\nher mind as to her passion for the Duke, which made her believe it was\nquite effaced.\n\nThe evening of her arrival the Queen-Dauphin made her a visit, and\nafter having condoled with her, told her that in order to divert her\nfrom melancholy thoughts, she would let her know all that had passed at\nCourt in her absence; upon which she related to her a great many\nextraordinary things; \"but what I have the greatest desire to inform\nyou of,\" added she, \"is that it is certain the Duke de Nemours is\npassionately in love; and that his most intimate friends are not only\nnot entrusted in it, but can't so much as guess who the person is he is\nin love with; nevertheless this passion of his is so strong as to make\nhim neglect, or to speak more properly, abandon the hopes of a Crown.\"\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin afterwards related whatever had passed in England;\n\"What I have just told you,\" continued she, \"I had from Monsieur\nd'Anville; and this morning he informed me, that last night the King\nsent for the Duke de Nemours upon the subject of Lignerol's letters,\nwho desires to return, and wrote to his Majesty that he could no longer\nexcuse to the Queen of England the Duke of Nemours's delay; that she\nbegins to be displeased at it; and though she has not positively given\nher promise, she has said enough to encourage him to come over; the\nKing showed this letter to the Duke of Nemours, who instead of speaking\nseriously as he had done at the beginning of this affair, only laughed\nand trifled, and made a jest of Lignerol's expectations:  He said, 'The\nwhole world would censure his imprudence, if he ventured to go to\nEngland, with the pretensions of marrying the Queen, without being\nsecure of success; I think,' added he, 'I should time my business very\nill to go to England now, when the King of Spain uses such pressing\ninstances to obtain the Queen in marriage; the Spanish King perhaps\nwould not be a very formidable rival in matters of gallantry, but in a\ntreaty of marriage I believe your Majesty would not advise me to be his\ncompetitor.' 'I would advise you to it upon this occasion,' replied the\nKing; 'but however you will have no competitor in him; I know he has\nquite other thoughts; and though he had not, Queen Mary found herself\nso uneasy under the weight of the Spanish Crown, that I can't believe\nher sister will be very desirous of it.'  'If she should not,' replied\nthe Duke of Nemours, 'it is probable she will seek her happiness in\nlove; she has been in love with my Lord Courtenay for several years;\nQueen Mary too was in love with him, and would have married him with\nconsent of the states of her kingdom, had not she known that the youth\nand beauty of her sister Elizabeth had more charms for him than her\ncrown; your Majesty knows, that the violence of her jealousy carried\nher so far, as to imprison them both, and afterwards to banish my Lord\nCourtenay, and at last determined her to marry the King of Spain; I\nbelieve Queen Elizabeth will soon recall that Lord, and make choice of\na man whom she loves, who deserves her love, and who has suffered so\nmuch for her, in preference to another whom she never saw.'  'I should\nbe of that opinion,' replied the King, 'if my Lord Courtenay were\nliving, but I received advice some days ago, that he died at Padua,\nwhither he was banished: I plainly see,' added the King, as he left the\nDuke, 'that your marriage must be concluded the same way the Dauphin's\nwas, and that ambassadors must be sent to marry the Queen of England\nfor you.'\n\n\"Monsieur d'Anville and the Viscount, who were with the King when he\nspoke to the Duke of Nemours, are persuaded that it is the passion he\nis so deeply engaged in, which diverts him from so great a design; the\nViscount, who sees deeper into him than anybody, told Madam de Martigny\nthat he was so changed he did not know him again; and what astonishes\nhim more is, that he does not find he has any private interviews, or\nthat he is ever missing at particular times, so that he believes he has\nno correspondence with the person he is in love with; and that which\nsurprises him in the Duke is to see him in love with a woman who does\nnot return his love.\"\n\nWhat poison did this discourse of the Queen-Dauphin carry in it for\nMadam de Cleves?  How could she but know herself to be the person whose\nname was not known, and how could she help being filled with tenderness\nand gratitude, when she learned, by a way not in the least liable to\nsuspicion, that the Duke, who had already touched her heart, concealed\nhis passion from the whole world, and neglected for her sake the hopes\nof a Crown?  It is impossible to express what she felt, or to describe\nthe tumult that was raised in her soul.  Had the Queen-Dauphin observed\nher closely, she might easily have discerned, that what she had been\nsaying was not indifferent to her; but as she had not the least\nsuspicion of the truth, she continued her discourse without minding\nher:  \"Monsieur d'Anville,\" added she, \"from whom, as I just told you,\nI had all this, believes I know more of it than himself, and he has so\ngreat an opinion of my beauty, that he is satisfied I am the only\nperson capable of creating so great a change in the Duke of Nemours.\"\n\nThese last words of the Queen-Dauphin gave Madam de Cleves a sort of\nuneasiness very different from that which she had a few minutes before.\n\"I can easily come into Monsieur d'Anville's opinion,\" answered she;\n\"and 'tis very probable, Madam, that nothing less than a Princess of\nyour merit could make him despise the Queen of England.\"  \"I would own\nit to you, if I knew it,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin, \"and I should know\nit, if it were true; such passions as these never escape the sight of\nthose who occasion them; they are the first to discern them; the Duke\nof Nemours has never showed me anything but slight complaisances; and\nyet I find so great a difference betwixt his present and former\nbehaviour to me, that I can assure you, I am not the cause of the\nindifference he expresses for the Crown of England.\n\n\"But I forget myself in your company,\" added the Queen-Dauphin, \"and\ndon't remember that I am to wait upon Madame: you know the peace is as\ngood as concluded, but perhaps you don't know that the King of Spain\nhas refused to sign it, but on condition of marrying this Princess,\ninstead of the Prince Don Carlos, his son: the King was with great\ndifficulty brought to allow it, but at last he has consented, and is\ngone to carry the news to Madame; I believe she will be inconsolable.\nTo marry a man of the King of Spain's age and temper can never be\npleasing, especially to her who has all the gaiety which the bloom of\nyouth joined with beauty inspires, and was in expectation of marrying a\nyoung Prince for whom she has an inclination without having seen him.\nI do not know whether the King will find in her all the obedience he\ndesires; he has charged me to see her, because he knows she loves me,\nand believes I shall be able to influence her.  From thence I shall\nmake a visit of a very different nature, to congratulate the King's\nsister.  All things are ready for her marriage with the Prince of\nSavoy, who is expected in a few days.  Never was a woman of her age so\nentirely pleased to be married; the Court will be more numerous and\nsplendid than ever, and notwithstanding your grief, you must come among\nus, in order to make strangers see that we are furnished with no mean\nbeauties.\"\n\nHaving said this, the Queen-Dauphin took her leave of Madam de Cleves,\nand the next day Madame's marriage was publicly known; some days after\nthe King and the Queens went to visit the Princess of Cleves; the Duke\nde Nemours, who had expected her return with the utmost impatience, and\nlanguished for an opportunity of speaking to her in private, contrived\nto wait upon her at an hour, when the company would probably be\nwithdrawing, and nobody else come in; he succeeded in his design, and\ncame in when the last visitors were going away.\n\nThe Princess was sitting on her bed, and the hot weather, together with\nthe sight of the Duke de Nemours, gave her a blush that added to her\nbeauty; he sat over against her with a certain timorous respect, that\nflows from a real love; he continued some minutes without speaking; nor\nwas she the less at a loss, so that they were both silent a good while:\nat last the Duke condoled with her for her mother's death; Madam de\nCleves was glad to give the conversation that turn, spoke a\nconsiderable time of the great loss she had had, and at last said, that\nthough time had taken off from the violence of her grief, yet the\nimpression would always remain so strong, that it would entirely change\nher humour.  \"Great troubles and excessive passions,\" replied the Duke,\n\"make great alterations in the mind; as for me, I am quite another man\nsince my return from Flanders; abundance of people have taken notice of\nthis change, and the Queen-Dauphin herself spoke to me of it\nyesterday.\"  \"It is true,\" replied the Princess, \"she has observed it,\nand I think I remember to have heard her say something about it.\"  \"I'm\nnot sorry, Madam,\" replied the Duke, \"that she has discerned it, but I\ncould wish some others in particular had discerned it too; there are\npersons to whom we dare give no other evidences of the passion we have\nfor them, but by things which do not concern them; and when we dare not\nlet them know we love them, we should be glad at least to have them see\nwe are not desirous of being loved by any other; we should be glad to\nconvince them, that no other beauty, though of the highest rank, has\nany charms for us, and that a Crown would be too dear, if purchased\nwith no less a price than absence from her we adore: women ordinarily,\"\ncontinued he, \"judge of the passion one has for them, by the care one\ntakes to oblige, and to be assiduous about them; but it's no hard\nmatter to do this, though they be ever so little amiable; not to give\noneself up to the pleasure of pursuing them, to shun them through fear\nof discovering to the public, and in a manner to themselves, the\nsentiments one has for them, here lies the difficulty; and what still\nmore demonstrates the truth of one's passion is, the becoming entirely\nchanged from what one was, and the having no longer a gust either for\nambition or pleasure, after one has employed one's whole life in\npursuit of both.\"\n\nThe Princess of Cleves readily apprehended how far she was concerned in\nthis discourse; one while she seemed of opinion that she ought not to\nsuffer such an address; another, she thought she ought not to seem to\nunderstand it, or show she supposed herself meant by it; she thought\nshe ought to speak, and she thought she ought to be silent; the Duke of\nNemours's discourse equally pleased and offended her; she was convinced\nby it of the truth of all the Queen-Dauphin had led her to think; she\nfound in it somewhat gallant and respectful, but also somewhat bold and\ntoo intelligible; the inclination she had for the Duke gave her an\nanxiety which it was not in her power to control; the most obscure\nexpressions of a man that pleases, move more than the most open\ndeclaration of one we have no liking for; she made no answer; the Duke\nde Nemours took notice of her silence, which perhaps would have proved\nno ill-presage, if the coming in of the Prince of Cleves had not ended\nat once the conversation and the visit.\n\nThe Prince was coming to give his wife a further account of Sancerre,\nbut she was not over curious to learn the sequel of that adventure; she\nwas so much taken up with what had just passed, that she could hardly\nconceal the embarrassment she was in.  When she was at liberty to muse\nupon it, she plainly saw she was mistaken, when she thought she was\nindifferent as to the Duke de Nemours; what he had said to her had made\nall the impression he could desire, and had entirely convinced her of\nhis passion; besides the Duke's actions agreed too well with his words\nto leave her the least doubt about it; she no longer flattered herself\nthat she did not love him; all her care was not to let him discover it,\na task of which she had already experienced the difficulty; she knew\nthe only way to succeed in it was to avoid seeing him; and as her\nmourning gave her an excuse for being more retired than usual, she made\nuse of that pretence not to go to places where he might see her; she\nwas full of melancholy; her mother's death was the seeming cause of it,\nand no suspicion was had of any other.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours, not seeing her any more, fell into desperation and\nknowing he should not meet with her in any public assembly, or at any\ndiversions the Court joined in, he could not prevail upon himself to\nappear there, and therefore he pretended a great love for hunting, and\nmade matches for that sport on the days when the Queens kept their\nassemblies; a slight indisposition had served him a good while as an\nexcuse for staying at home, and declining to go to places where he knew\nvery well that Madam de Cleves would not be.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves was ill almost at the same time, and the Princess\nnever stirred out of his room during his illness; but when he grew\nbetter, and received company, and among others the Duke de Nemours, who\nunder pretence of being yet weak, stayed with him the greatest part of\nthe day, she found she could not continue any longer there; and yet in\nthe first visits he made she had not the resolution to go out; she had\nbeen too long without seeing him, to be able to resolve to see him no\nmore; the Duke had the address, by discourses that appeared altogether\ngeneral, but which she understood very well by the relation they had to\nwhat he had said privately to her, to let her know that he went\na-hunting only to be more at liberty to think of her, and that the\nreason of his not going to the assemblies was her not being there.\n\nAt last she executed the resolution she had taken to go out of her\nhusband's room, whenever he was there, though this was doing the utmost\nviolence to herself: the Duke perceived she avoided him, and the\nthought of it touched him to the heart.\n\nThe Prince of Cleves did not immediately take notice of his wife's\nconduct in this particular, but at last he perceived she went out of\nthe room when there was company there; he spoke to her of it, and she\ntold him that she did not think it consistent with decency to be every\nevening among the gay young courtiers; that she hoped he would allow\nher to live in a more reserved manner than she had done hitherto, that\nthe virtue and presence of her mother authorised her in many liberties\nwhich could not otherwise be justified in a woman of her age.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves, who had a great deal of facility and complaisance\nfor his wife, did not show it on this occasion, but told her he would\nby no means consent to her altering her conduct; she was upon the point\nof telling him, it was reported that the Duke de Nemours was in love\nwith her, but she had not the power to name him; besides she thought it\ndisingenuous to disguise the truth, and make use of pretences to a man\nwho had so good an opinion of her.\n\nSome days after the King was with the Queen at the assembly hour, and\nthe discourse turned upon nativities and predictions; the company were\ndivided in their opinion as to what credit ought to be given to them;\nthe Queen professed to have great faith in them, and maintained that\nafter so many things had come to pass as they had been foretold, one\ncould not doubt but there was something of certainty in that science;\nothers affirmed, that of an infinite number of predictions so very few\nproved true, that the truth of those few ought to be looked upon as an\neffect of chance.\n\n\"I have formerly been very curious and inquisitive as to futurity,\"\nsaid the King, \"but I have seen so many false and improbable things,\nthat I am satisfied there is no truth in that pretended art.  Not many\nyears since there came hither a man of great reputation in astrology;\neverybody went to see him; I went among others, but without saying who\nI was, and I carried with me the Duke of Guise and Descars, and made\nthem go in first; nevertheless the astrologer addressed himself first\nto me, as if he had concluded me to be their master; perhaps he knew\nme, and yet he told me one thing that was very unsuitable to my\ncharacter, if he had known me; his prediction was that I should be\nkilled in a duel; he told the Duke of Guise, that he should die of a\nwound received behind; and he told Descars he should be knocked of the\nhead by the kick of a horse; the Duke of Guise was a little angry at\nthe prediction, as if it imported he should run away; nor was Descars\nbetter pleased to find he was to make his exit by so unfortunate an\naccident; in a word, we went away all three of us very much out of\nhumour with the astrologer; I don't know what will happen to the Duke\nof Guise and Descars, but there is not much probability of my being\nkilled in a duel; the King of Spain and I have just made peace, and if\nwe had not, I question whether we should have fought, or if I should\nhave challenged him, as the King my father did Charles the Fifth.\"\n\nAfter the King had related the misfortune that was foretold him, those\nwho had defended astrology abandoned the argument, and agreed there was\nno credit to be given to it:  \"For my part,\" said the Duke de Nemours\naloud, \"I have the least reason of any man in the world to credit it\";\nand then turning himself to Madam de Cleves, near whom he stood, \"it\nhas been foretold me,\" says he very softly, \"that I should be happy in\na person for whom I should have the most violent and respectful\npassion; you may judge, Madam, if I ought to believe in predictions.\"\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin, who believed, from what the Duke had spoke aloud,\nthat what he whispered was some false prediction that had been told\nhim, asked him what it was he said to Madam de Cleves; had he had a\nless ready wit, he would have been surprised at this question; but\nwithout any hesitation, \"What I said to her, Madam,\" answered he, \"was,\nthat it had been predicted to me, that I should be raised to a higher\nfortune than my most sanguine hopes could lead me to expect.\"  \"If\nnothing have been foretold you but this,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin,\nsmiling, and thinking of the affair of England, \"I would not advise you\nto decry astrology; you may have reasons hereafter to offer in defence\nof it.\"  Madam de Cleves apprehended the Queen-Dauphin's meaning, but\nknew withal, that the fortune the Duke of Nemours spoke of was not that\nof being King of England.\n\nThe time of her mourning being expired, the Princess of Cleves was\nobliged to make her appearance again, and go to Court as usual; she saw\nthe Duke de Nemours at the Queen-Dauphin's apartment; she saw him at\nthe Prince of Cleves's, where he often came in company of other young\nnoblemen, to avoid being remarked; yet she never once saw him, but it\ngave her a pain that could not escape his observation.\n\nHowever industrious she was to avoid being looked at by him, and to\nspeak less to him than to any other, some things escaped her in an\nunguarded moment, which convinced him he was not indifferent to her; a\nman of less discernment than he would not have perceived it, but he had\nalready so often been the object of love, that it was easy for him to\nknow when he was loved; he found the Chevalier de Guise was his rival,\nand the Chevalier knew that the Duke de Nemours was his; Monsieur de\nGuise was the only man in the Court that had unravelled this affair,\nhis interest having made him more clear-sighted than others; the\nknowledge they had of each other's sentiments created an opposition\nbetween them in everything, which, however, did not break out into an\nopen quarrel; they were always of different parties at the running, at\nthe ring, at tournaments, and all diversions the King delighted in, and\ntheir emulation was so great it could not be concealed.\n\nMadam de Cleves frequently revolved in her mind the affair of England;\nshe believed the Duke de Nemours could not resist the advice of the\nKing, and the instances of Lignerolles; she was very much concerned to\nfind that Lignerolles was not yet returned, and she impatiently\nexpected him; her inclinations strongly swayed her to inform herself\nexactly of the state of this affair; but the same reasons, which raised\nin her that curiosity, obliged her to conceal it, and she only enquired\nof the beauty, the wit, and the temper of Queen Elizabeth.  A picture\nof that Princess had been brought the King, which Madam de Cleves found\nmuch handsomer than she could have wished for, and she could not\nforbear saying, the picture flattered.  \"I don't think so,\" replied the\nQueen-Dauphin; \"that Princess has the reputation of being very\nhandsome, and of having a very exalted genius, and I know she has\nalways been proposed to me as a model worthy my imitation; she can't\nbut be very handsome, if she resembles her mother, Anne Boleyn; never\nhad woman so many charms and allurements both in her person and her\nhumour; I have heard say she had something remarkably lively in her\ncountenance, very different from what is usually found in other English\nbeauties.\"  \"I think,\" replied Madam de Cleves, \"'tis said she was born\nin France.\"  \"Those who imagine so are mistaken,\" replied the\nQueen-Dauphin; \"I'll give you her history in a few words.\n\n\"She was of a good family in England; Henry the Eighth was in love with\nher sister and her mother, and it has been even suspected by some, that\nshe was his daughter; she came to France with Henry the Seventh's\nsister, who married Louis XII that Princess, who was full of youth and\ngallantry, left the Court of France with great reluctance after her\nhusband's death; but Anne Boleyn, who had the same inclinations as her\nmistress, could not prevail with herself to go away; the late King was\nin love with her, and she continued maid of honour to Queen Claude;\nthat Queen died, and Margaretta, the King's sister, Duchess of Alenson,\nand since Queen of Navarre, whose story you know, took her into her\nservice, where she imbibed the principles of the new religion; she\nreturned afterwards to England, and there charmed all the world; she\nhad the manners of France, which please in all countries; she sung\nwell, she danced finely; she was a maid of honour to Queen Catherine,\nand Henry the Eighth fell desperately in love with her.\n\n\"Cardinal Wolsey, his favourite and first minister, being dissatisfied\nwith the Emperor for not having favoured his pretensions to the Papacy,\nin order to revenge himself of him, contrived an alliance between\nFrance and the King his master; he put it into the head of Henry the\nEighth, that his marriage with the Emperor's aunt was null, and advised\nhim to marry the Duchess of Alenson, whose husband was just dead; Anne\nBoleyn, who was not without ambition, considered Queen Catherine's\ndivorce as a means that would bring her to the Crown; she began to give\nthe King of England impressions of the Lutheran religion, and engaged\nthe late King to favour at Rome Henry the Eighth's divorce, in hopes of\nhis marrying the Duchess of Alenson; Cardinal Wolsey, that he might\nhave an opportunity of treating this affair, procured himself to be\nsent to France upon other pretences; but his master was so far from\npermitting him to propose this marriage, that he sent him express\norders to Calais not to speak of it.\n\n\"Cardinal Wolsey, at his return from France, was received with as great\nhonours as could have been paid to the King himself; never did any\nfavourite carry his pride and vanity to so great a height; he managed\nan interview between the two Kings at Boulogne, when Francis the First\nwould have given the upperhand to Henry the Eighth, but he refused to\naccept it; they treated one another by turns with the utmost\nmagnificence, and presented to each habits of the same sort with those\nthey wore themselves. I remember to have heard say, that those the late\nKing sent to the King of England were of crimson satin beset all over\nwith pearls and diamonds, and a robe of white velvet embroidered with\ngold; after having stayed some time at Boulogne, they went to Calais.\nAnne Boleyn was lodged in Henry the Eighth's Court with the train of a\nQueen; and Francis the First made her the same presents, and paid her\nthe same honours as if she had been really so: in a word, after a\npassion of nine year's continuance King Henry married her, without\nwaiting for the dissolving of his first marriage.  The Pope\nprecipitately thundered out excommunications against him, which so\nprovoked King Henry, that he declared himself head of the Church, and\ndrew after him all England into the unhappy change in which you see it.\n\n\"Anne Boleyn did not long enjoy her greatness; for when she thought\nherself most secure of it by the death of Queen Catherine, one day as\nshe was seeing a match of running at the ring made by the Viscount\nRochefort her brother, the King was struck with such a jealousy, that\nhe abruptly left the show, went away to London, and gave orders for\narresting the Queen, the Viscount Rochefort, and several others whom he\nbelieved to be the lovers or confidants of that Princess.  Though this\njealousy in appearance had its birth that moment, the King had been\nlong possessed with it by the Viscountess Rochefort, who not being able\nto bear the strict intimacy between her husband and the Queen,\nrepresented it to the King as a criminal commerce; so that that Prince,\nwho was besides in love with Jane Seymour, thought of nothing but\nridding himself of Anne Boleyn; and in less than three weeks he caused\nthe Queen and her brother to be tried, had them both beheaded, and,\nmarried Jane Seymour.  He had afterwards several wives, whom he\ndivorced or put to death; and among others Catherine Howard, whose\nconfidant the Viscountess Rochefort was, and who was beheaded with her:\nthus was she punished for having falsely accused Anne Boleyn.  And\nHenry the Eighth died, being become excessive fat.\"\n\nAll the ladies, that were present when the Queen-Dauphin made this\nrelation, thanked her for having given them so good an account of the\nCourt of England; and among the rest Madam de Cleves, who could not\nforbear asking several questions concerning Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin caused pictures in miniature to be drawn of all the\nbeauties of the Court, in order to send them to the Queen her mother.\nOne day, when that of Madam de Cleves was finishing, the Queen-Dauphin\ncame to spend the afternoon with her; the Duke de Nemours did not fail\nto be there; he let slip no opportunities of seeing Madam de Cleves,\nyet without appearing to contrive them. She looked so pretty that day,\nthat he would have fell in love with her, though he had not been so\nbefore: however he durst not keep his eyes fixed upon her, while she\nwas sitting for her picture, for fear of showing too much the pleasure\nhe took in looking at her.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin asked Monsieur de Cleves for a little picture he had\nof his wife's, to compare it with that which was just drawn; everybody\ngave their judgment of the one and the other; and Madam de Cleves\nordered the painter to mend something in the headdress of that which\nhad been just brought in; the painter in obedience to her took the\npicture out of the case in which it was, and having mended it laid it\nagain on the table.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours had long wished to have a picture of Madam de\nCleves; when he saw that which Monsieur de Cleves had, he could not\nresist the temptation of stealing it from a husband, who, he believed,\nwas tenderly loved; and he thought that among so many persons as were\nin the same room he should be no more liable to suspicion than another.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin was sitting on the bed, and whispering to Madam de\nCleves, who was standing before her.  Madam de Cleves, through one of\nthe curtains that was but half-drawn, spied the Duke de Nemours with\nhis back to the table, that stood at the bed's feet, and perceived that\nwithout turning his face he took something very dextrously from off the\ntable; she presently guessed it was her picture, and was in such\nconcern about it, that the Queen-Dauphin observed she did not attend to\nwhat she said, and asked her aloud what it was she looked at.  At those\nwords, the Duke de Nemours turned about, and met full the eyes of Madam\nde Cleves that were still fixed upon him; he thought it not impossible\nbut she might have seen what he had done.\n\nMadam de Cleves was not a little perplexed; it was reasonable to demand\nher picture of him; but to demand it publicly was to discover to the\nwhole world the sentiments which the Duke had for her, and to demand it\nin private would be to engage him to speak of his love; she judged\nafter all it was better to let him keep it, and she was glad to grant\nhim a favour which she could do without his knowing that she granted\nit.  The Duke de Nemours, who observed her perplexity, and partly\nguessed the cause of it, came up, and told her softly, \"If you have\nseen what I have ventured to do, be so good, Madam, as to let me\nbelieve you are ignorant of it; I dare ask no more\"; having said this\nhe withdrew, without waiting for her answer.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin went to take a walk, attended with the rest of the\nladies; and the Duke de Nemours went home to shut himself up in his\ncloset, not being able to support in public the ecstasy he was in on\nhaving a picture of Madam de Cleves; he tasted everything that was\nsweet in love; he was in love with the finest woman of the Court; he\nfound she loved him against her will, and saw in all her actions that\nsort of care and embarrassment which love produces in young and\ninnocent hearts.\n\nAt night great search was made for the picture; and having found the\ncase it used to be kept in, they never suspected it had been stolen but\nthought it might have fallen out by chance.  The Prince of Cleves was\nvery much concerned for the loss of it; and after having searched for\nit a great while to no purpose, he told his wife, but with an air that\nshowed he did not think so, that without doubt she had some secret\nlover, to whom she had given the picture, or who had stole it, and that\nnone but a lover would have been contented with the picture without the\ncase.\n\nThese words, though spoke in jest, made a lively impression in the mind\nof Madam de Cleves; they gave her remorse, and she reflected on the\nviolence of her inclination which hurried her on to love the Duke of\nNemours; she found she was no longer mistress of her words or\ncountenance; she imagined that Lignerolles was returned, that she had\nnothing to fear from the affair of England, nor any cause to suspect\nthe Queen-Dauphin; in a word, that she had no refuge or defence against\nthe Duke de Nemours but by retiring; but as she was not at her liberty\nto retire, she found herself in a very great extremity and ready to\nfall into the last misfortune, that of discovering to the Duke the\ninclination she had for him: she remembered all that her mother had\nsaid to her on her death-bed, and the advice which she gave her, to\nenter on any resolutions, however difficult they might be, rather than\nengage in gallantry; she remembered also what Monsieur de Cleves had\ntold her, when he gave an account of Madam de Tournon; she thought she\nought to acknowledge to him the inclination she had for the Duke de\nNemours, and in that thought she continued a long time; afterwards she\nwas astonished to have entertained so ridiculous a design, and fell\nback again into her former perplexity of not knowing what to choose.\n\nThe peace was signed; and the Lady Elizabeth, after a great deal of\nreluctance, resolved to obey the King her father.  The Duke of Alva was\nappointed to marry her in the name of the Catholic King, and was very\nsoon expected.  The Duke of Savoy too, who was to marry the King's\nsister, and whose nuptials were to be solemnised at the same time, was\nexpected every day.  The King thought of nothing but how to grace these\nmarriages with such diversions as might display the politeness and\nmagnificence of his Court. Interludes and comedies of the best kind\nwere proposed, but the King thought those entertainments too private,\nand desired to have somewhat of a more splendid nature: he resolved to\nmake a solemn tournament, to which strangers might be invited, and of\nwhich the people might be spectators.  The princes and young lords very\nmuch approved the King's design, especially the Duke of Ferrara,\nMonsieur de Guise, and the Duke de Nemours, who surpassed the rest in\nthese sorts of exercises.  The King made choice of them to be together\nwith himself the four champions of the tournament.\n\nProclamation was made throughout the kingdom, that on the 15th of June\nin the City of Paris, his most Christian Majesty, and the Princes\nAlphonso d'Ete Duke of Ferrara, Francis of Loraine Duke of Guise, and\nJames of Savoy Duke of Nemours would hold an open tournament against\nall comers.  The first combat to be on horse-back in the lists, with\ndouble armour, to break four lances, and one for the ladies; the second\ncombat with swords, one to one, or two to two, as the judges of the\nfield should direct; the third combat on foot, three pushes of pikes,\nand six hits with the sword.  The champions to furnish lances, swords,\nand pikes, at the choice of the combatants.  Whoever did not manage his\nhorse in the carreer to be put out of the lists; four judges of the\nfield to give orders.  The combatants who should break most lances and\nperform best to carry the prize, the value whereof to be at the\ndiscretion of the judges; all the combatants, as well French as\nstrangers, to be obliged to touch one or more, at their choice, of the\nshields that should hang on the pillar at the end of the lists, where a\nherald at arms should be ready to receive them, and enroll them\naccording to their quality, and the shields they had touched; the\ncombatants to be obliged to cause their shields and arms to be brought\nby a gentleman and hung up at the pillar three days before the\ntournament, otherwise not to be admitted without leave of the champions.\n\nA spacious list was made near the Bastille, which begun from the\nChateau des Tournelles and crossed the street of St. Anthony, and\nextended as far as the King's stables; on both sides were built\nscaffolds and amphitheatres, which formed a sort of galleries that made\na very fine sight, and were capable of containing an infinite number of\npeople.  The princes and lords were wholly taken up in providing what\nwas necessary for a splendid appearance, and in mingling in their\ncyphers and devices somewhat of gallantry that had relation to the\nladies they were in love with.\n\nA few days before the Duke of Alva's arrival, the King made a match at\ntennis with the Duke de Nemours, the Chevalier de Guise, and the\nViscount de Chartres.  The Queens came to see them play, attended with\nthe ladies of the Court, and among others Madam de Cleves.  After the\ngame was ended, as they went out of the tennis court, Chatelart came up\nto the Queen-Dauphin, and told her fortune had put into his hands a\nletter of gallantry, that dropped out of the Duke de Nemours's pocket.\nThis Queen, who was always very curious in what related to the Duke,\nbid Chatelart give her the letter; he did so, and she followed the\nQueen her mother-in-law, who was going with the King to see them work\nat the lists.  After they had been there some time, the King caused\nsome horses to be brought that had been lately taken in, and though\nthey were not as yet thoroughly managed, he was for mounting one of\nthem, and ordered his attendants to mount others; the King and the Duke\nde Nemours hit upon the most fiery and high mettled of them.  The\nhorses were ready to fall foul on one another, when the Duke of\nNemours, for fear of hurting the King, retreated abruptly, and ran back\nhis horse against a pillar with so much violence that the shock of it\nmade him stagger.  The company ran up to him, and he was thought\nconsiderably hurt; but the Princess of Cleves thought the hurt much\ngreater than anyone else.  The interest she had in it gave her an\napprehension and concern which she took no care to conceal; she came up\nto him with the Queens, and with a countenance so changed, that one\nless concerned than the Chevalier de Guise might have perceived it:\nperceive it he immediately did, and was much more intent upon the\ncondition Madam de Cleves was in, than upon that of the Duke de\nNemours.  The blow the Duke had given himself had so stunned him, that\nhe continued some time leaning his head on those who supported him;\nwhen he raised himself up, he immediately viewed Madam de Cleves, and\nsaw in her face the concern she was in for him, and he looked upon her\nin a manner which made her sense how much he was touched with it:\nafterwards he thanked the Queens for the goodness they had expressed to\nhim, and made apologies for the condition he had been in before them;\nand then the King ordered him to go to rest.\n\nMadam de Cleves, after she was recovered from the fright she had been\nin, presently reflected on the tokens she had given of it. The\nChevalier de Guise did not suffer her to continue long in the hope that\nnobody had perceived it, but giving her his hand to lead her out of the\nlists:  \"I have more cause to complain, Madam,\" said he, \"than the Duke\nde Nemours; pardon me, if I forget for a moment that profound respect I\nhave always had for you, and show you how much my heart is grieved for\nwhat my eyes have just seen; this is the first time I have ever been so\nbold as to speak to you, and it will be the last.  Death or at least\neternal absence will remove me from a place where I can live no longer,\nsince I have now lost the melancholy comfort I had of believing that\nall who behold you with love are as unhappy as myself.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves made only a confused answer, as if she had not\nunderstood what the Chevalier's words meant: at another time she would\nhave been offended if he had mentioned the passion he had for her; but\nat this moment she felt nothing but the affliction to know that he had\nobserved the passion she had for the Duke de Nemours.  The Chevalier de\nGuise was so well convinced of it, and so pierced with grief, that from\nthat moment he took a resolution never to think of being loved by Madam\nde Cleves; but that he might the better be able to quit a passion which\nhe had thought so difficult and so glorious, it was necessary to make\nchoice of some other undertaking worthy of employing him; he had his\nview on Rhodes: the taking of which he had formerly had some idea of;\nand when death snatched him away, in the flower of his youth, and at a\ntime when he had acquired the reputation of one of the greatest Princes\nof his age, the only regret he had to part with life was, that he had\nnot been able to execute so noble a resolution, the success whereof he\nthought infallible from the great care he had taken about it.\n\nMadam de Cleves, when she came out of the lists, went to the Queen's\napartment, with her thoughts wholly taken up with what had passed.  The\nDuke de Nemours came there soon after, richly dressed, and like one\nwholly unsensible of the accident that had befallen him; he appeared\neven more gay than usual, and the joy he was in for what he had\ndiscovered, gave him an air that very much increased his natural\nagreeableness.  The whole Court was surprised when he came in; and\nthere was nobody but asked him how he did, except Madam de Cleves, who\nstayed near the chimney pretending not to see him.  The King coming out\nof his closet, and seeing him among others called him to talk to him\nabout his late accident.  The Duke passed by Madam de Cleves, and said\nsoftly to her, \"Madam, I have received this day some marks of your\npity, but they were not such as I am most worthy of.\" Madam de Cleves\nsuspected that he had taken notice of the concern she had been in for\nhim, and what he now said convinced her she was not mistaken; it gave\nher a great deal of concern to find she was so little mistress of\nherself as not to have been able to conceal her inclinations from the\nChevalier de Guise; nor was she the less concerned to see that the Duke\nde Nemours was acquainted with them; yet this last grief was not so\nentire, but there was a certain mixture of pleasure in it.\n\nThe Queen-Dauphin, who was extremely impatient to know what there was\nin the letter which Chatelart had given her, came up to Madam de\nCleves.  \"Go read this letter,\" says she; \"'tis addressed to the Duke\nde Nemours, and was probably sent him by the mistress for whom he has\nforsaken all others; if you can't read it now, keep it, and bring it me\nabout bedtime and inform me if you know the hand.\"  Having said this,\nthe Queen-Dauphin went away from Madam de Cleves, and left her in such\nastonishment, that she was not able for some time to stir out of the\nplace.  The impatience and grief she was in not permitting her to stay\nat Court, she went home before her usual hour of retirement; she\ntrembled with the letter in her hand, her thoughts were full of\nconfusion, and she experienced I know not what of insupportable grief,\nthat she had never felt before.  No sooner was she in her closet, but\nshe opened the letter and found it as follows:\n\nI have loved you too well to leave you in a belief that the change you\nobserve in me is an effect of lightness; I must inform you that your\nfalsehood is the cause of it; you will be surprised to hear me speak of\nyour falsehood; you have dissembled it with so much skill, and I have\ntaken so much care to conceal my knowledge of it from you, that you\nhave reason to be surprised at the discovery; I am myself in wonder,\nthat I have discovered nothing of it to you before; never was grief\nequal to mine; I thought you had the most violent passion for me, I did\nnot conceal that which I had for you, and at the time that I\nacknowledged it to you without reserve, I found that you deceived me,\nthat you loved another, and that in all probability I was made a\nsacrifice to this new mistress.  I knew it the day you run at the ring,\nand this was the reason I was not there; at first I pretended an\nindisposition in order to conceal my sorrow, but afterwards  I really\nfell into one, nor could a constitution delicate like mine support so\nviolent a shock.  When I began to be better, I still counterfeited\nsickness, that I might have an excuse for not seeing and for not\nwriting to you; besides I was willing to have time to come to a\nresolution in what manner to deal with you; I took and quitted the same\nresolution twenty times; but at last I concluded you deserved not to\nsee my grief, and I resolved not to show you the least mark of it. I\nhad a desire to bring down your pride, by letting you see, that my\npassion for you declined of itself: I thought I should by this lessen\nthe value of the sacrifice you had made of me, and was loth you should\nhave the pleasure of appearing more amiable in the eyes of another, by\nshowing her how much I loved you; I resolved to write to you in a cold\nand languishing manner, that she, to whom you gave my letters, might\nperceive my love was at an end:  I was unwilling she should have the\nsatisfaction of knowing I was sensible that she triumphed over me, or\nthat she should increase her triumph by my despair and complaints.  I\nthought I should punish you too little by merely breaking with you, and\nthat my ceasing to love you would give you but a slight concern, after\nyou had first forsaken me; I found it was necessary you should love me,\nto feel the smart of not being loved, which I so severely experienced\nmyself; I was of opinion that if anything could rekindle that flame, it\nwould be to let you see that mine was extinguished, but to let you see\nit through an endeavour to conceal it from you, as if I wanted the\npower to acknowledge it to you: this resolution I adhered to; I found\nit difficult to take, and when I saw you again I thought it impossible\nto execute.  I was ready a hundred times to break out into tears and\ncomplaints; my ill state of health, which still continued, served as a\ndisguise to hide from you the affliction and trouble I was in;\nafterward I was supported by the pleasure of dissembling with you, as\nyou had done with me; however it was doing so apparent a violence to\nmyself to tell you or to write to you that I loved you, that you\nimmediately perceived I had no mind to let you see my affection was\naltered; you was touched with this, you complained of it; I endeavoured\nto remove your fears, but it was done in so forced a manner, that you\nwere still more convinced by it, I no longer loved you; in short, I did\nall I intended to do.  The fantasticalness of your heart was such, that\nyou advanced towards me in proportion as you saw I retreated from you.\nI have enjoyed all the pleasure which can arise from revenge; I plainly\nsaw, that you loved me more than you had ever done, and I showed you I\nhad no longer any love for you.  I had even reason to believe that you\nhad entirely abandoned her, for whom you had forsaken me; I had ground\ntoo to be satisfied you had never spoken to her concerning me; but\nneither your discretion in that particular, nor the return of your\naffection can make amends for your inconstancy; your heart has been\ndivided between me and another, and you have deceived me; this is\nsufficient wholly to take from me the pleasure I found in being loved\nby you, as I thought I deserved to be, and to confirm me in the\nresolution I have taken never to see you more, which you are so much\nsurprised at.\n\n\nMadam de Cleves read this letter, and read it over again several times,\nwithout knowing at the same time what she had read; she saw only that\nthe Duke de Nemours did not love her as she imagined and that he loved\nothers who were no less deceived by him than she.  What a discovery was\nthis for a person in her condition, who had a violent passion, who had\njust given marks of it to a man whom she judged unworthy of it, and to\nanother whom she used ill for his sake!  Never was affliction so\ncutting as hers; she imputed the piercingness of it to what had\nhappened that day, and believed that if the Duke de Nemours had not had\nground to believe she loved him she should not have cared whether he\nloved another or not; but she deceived herself, and this evil which she\nfound so insupportable was jealousy with all the horrors it can be\naccompanied with.  This letter discovered to her a piece of gallantry\nthe Duke de Nemours had been long engaged in; she saw the lady who\nwrote it was a person of wit and merit, and deserved to be loved; she\nfound she had more courage than herself, and envied her the power she\nhad had of concealing her sentiments from the Duke de Nemours; by the\nclose of the letter, she saw this lady thought herself beloved, and\npresently suspected that the discretion the Duke had showed in his\naddresses to her, and which she had been so much taken with, was only\nan effect of his passion for this other mistress, whom he was afraid of\ndisobliging; in short, she thought of everything that could add to her\ngrief and despair.  What reflections did she not make on herself, and\non the advices her mother had given her I how did she repent, that she\nhad not persisted in her resolution of retiring, though against the\nwill of Monsieur de Cleves, or that she had not pursued her intentions\nof acknowledging to him the inclination she had for the Duke of\nNemours!  She was convinced, she would have done better to discover it\nto a husband, whose goodness she was sensible of, and whose interest it\nwould have been to conceal it, than to let it appear to a man who was\nunworthy of it, who deceived her, who perhaps made a sacrifice of her,\nand who had no view in being loved by her but to gratify his pride and\nvanity; in a word, she found, that all the calamities that could befall\nher, and all the extremities she could be reduced to, were less than\nthat single one of having discovered to the Duke de Nemours that she\nloved him, and of knowing that he loved another: all her comfort was to\nthink, that after the knowledge of this she had nothing more to fear\nfrom herself, and that she should be entirely eased of the inclination\nshe had for the Duke.\n\nShe never thought of the orders the Queen-Dauphin had given her, to\ncome to her when she went to rest: she went to bed herself, and\npretended to be ill; so that when Monsieur de Cleves came home from the\nKing, they told him she was asleep.  But she was far from that\ntranquillity which inclines to sleep; all the night she did nothing but\ntorment herself, and read over and over the letter in her hand.\n\nMadam de Cleves was not the only person whom this letter disturbed.\nThe Viscount de Chartres, who had lost it and not the Duke de Nemours,\nwas in the utmost inquietude about it.  He had been that evening with\nthe Duke of Guise, who had given a great entertainment to the Duke of\nFerrara his brother-in-law, and to all the young people of the Court:\nit happened that the discourse turned upon ingenious letters; and the\nViscount de Chartres said he had one about him the finest that ever was\nwrit: they urged him to show it, and on his excusing himself, the Duke\nde Nemours insisted he had no such letter, and that what he said was\nonly out of vanity; the Viscount made him answer, that he urged his\ndiscretion to the utmost, that nevertheless he would not show the\nletter; but he would read some parts of it, which would make it appear\nfew men received the like.  Having said this, he would have taken out\nthe letter, but could not find it; he searched for it to no purpose.\nThe company rallied him about it; but he seemed so disturbed, that they\nforbore to speak further of it; he withdrew sooner than the others, and\nwent home with great impatience, to see if he had not left the letter\nthere.  While he was looking for it, one of the Queen's pages came to\ntell him, that the Viscountess d'Usez had thought it necessary to give\nhim speedy advice, that it was said at the Queen's Court, that he had\ndropped a letter of gallantry out of his pocket while he was playing at\ntennis; that great part of what the letter contained had been related,\nthat the Queen had expressed a great curiosity to see it, and had sent\nto one of her gentlemen for it, but that he answered, he had given it\nto Chatelart.\n\nThe page added many other particulars which heightened the Viscount's\nconcern; he went out that minute to go to a gentleman who was an\nintimate friend of Chatelart's; and though it was a very unseasonable\nhour, made him get out of bed to go and fetch the letter, without\nletting him know who it was had sent for it, or who had lost it.\nChatelart, who was prepossessed with an opinion that it belonged to the\nDuke of Nemours, and that the Duke was in love with the Queen-Dauphin,\ndid not doubt but it was he who had sent to redemand it, and so\nanswered with a malicious sort of joy, that he had put the letter into\nthe Queen-Dauphin's hands.  The gentleman brought this answer back to\nthe Viscount de Chartres, which increased the uneasiness he was under\nalready, and added new vexations to it: after having continued some\ntime in an irresolution what to do, he found that the Duke de Nemours\nwas the only person whose assistance could draw him out of this\nintricate affair.\n\nAccordingly he went to the Duke's house, and entered his room about\nbreak of day.  What the Duke had discovered the day before with respect\nto the Princess of Cleves had given him such agreeable ideas, that he\nslept very sweetly; he was very much surprised to find himself waked by\nthe Viscount de Chartres, and asked him if he came to disturb his rest\nso early, to be revenged of him for what he had said last night at\nsupper.  The Viscount's looks soon convinced him, that he came upon a\nserious business; \"I am come,\" said he, \"to entrust you with the most\nimportant affair of my life; I know very well, you are not obliged to\nme for the confidence I place in you, because I do it at a time when I\nstand in need of your assistance; but I know likewise, that I should\nhave lost your esteem, if I had acquainted you with all I am now going\nto tell you, without having been forced to it by absolute necessity: I\nhave dropped the letter I spoke of last night; it is of the greatest\nconsequence to me, that nobody should know it is addressed to me; it\nhas been seen by abundance of people, who were at the tennis court\nyesterday when I dropped it; you was there too, and the favour I have\nto ask you, is, to say it was you who lost it.\"  \"Sure you think,\"\nreplied the Duke de Nemours smiling, \"that I have no mistress, by\nmaking such a proposal, and that I have no quarrels or inconveniences\nto apprehend by leaving it to be believed that I receive such letters.\"\n\"I beg you,\" said the Viscount, \"to hear me seriously; if you have a\nmistress, as I doubt not you have, though I do not know who she is, it\nwill be easy for you to justify yourself, and I'll put you into an\ninfallible way of doing it.  As for you, though you should fail in\njustifying yourself, it can cost you nothing but a short falling out;\nbut for my part, this accident affects me in a very different manner, I\nshall dishonour a person who has passionately loved me, and is one of\nthe most deserving women in the world; on the other side, I shall draw\nupon myself an implacable hatred that will ruin my fortune, and perhaps\nproceed somewhat further.\"  \"I do not comprehend what you say,\" replied\nthe Duke de Nemours, \"but I begin to see that the reports we have had\nof your interest in a great Princess are not wholly without ground.\"\n\"They are not,\" replied the Viscount, \"but I would to God they were:\nyou would not see me in the perplexity I am in; but I must relate the\nwhole affair to you, to convince you how much I have to fear.\n\n\"Ever since I came to Court, the Queen has treated me with a great deal\nof favour and distinction, and I had grounds to believe that she was\nvery kindly disposed towards me: there was nothing, however, particular\nin all this, and I never presumed to entertain any thoughts of her but\nwhat were full of respect; so far from it, that I was deeply in love\nwith Madam de Themines; anyone that sees her may easily judge, 'tis\nvery possible for one to be greatly in love with her, when one is\nbeloved by her, and so I was.  About two years ago, the Court being at\nFontainebleau, I was two or three times in conversation with the Queen,\nat hours when there were very few people in her apartment: it appeared\nto me, that my turn of wit was agreeable to her, and I observed she\nalways approved what I said.  One day among others she fell into a\ndiscourse concerning confidence.  I said there was nobody in whom I\nentirely confided, that I found people always repented of having done\nso, and that I knew a great many things of which I had never spoke: the\nQueen told me, she esteemed me the more for it, that she had not found\nin France anyone that could keep a secret, and that this was what had\nembarrassed her more than anything else, because it had deprived her of\nthe pleasure of having a confidant; that nothing was so necessary in\nlife as to have somebody one could open one's mind to with safety,\nespecially for people of her rank.  Afterwards she frequently resumed\nthe same discourse, and acquainted me with very particular\ncircumstances; at last I imagined she was desirous to learn my secrets,\nand to entrust me with her own; this thought engaged me strictly to\nher.  I was so pleased with this distinction that I made my court to\nher with greater assiduity than usual.  One evening the King and the\nladies of the Court rode out to take the air in the forest, but the\nQueen, being a little indisposed did not go; I stayed to wait upon her,\nand she walked down to the pond-side, and dismissed her gentlemen\nushers, that she might be more at liberty.  After she had taken a few\nturns she came up to me, and bid me follow her; 'I would speak with\nyou,' says she, 'and by what I shall say you will see I am your\nfriend.'  She stopped here, and looking earnestly at me; 'You are in\nlove,' continued she, 'and because perhaps you have made nobody your\nconfidant, you think that your love is not known; but it is known, and\neven by persons who are interested in it: you are observed, the place\nwhere you see your mistress is discovered, and there's a design to\nsurprise you; I don't know who she is, nor do I ask you to tell me, I\nwould only secure you from the misfortunes into which you may fall.'\nSee, I beseech you, what a snare the Queen laid for me, and how\ndifficult it was for me not to fall into it; she had a mind to know if\nI was in love, and as she did not ask me who I was in love with, but\nlet me see her intention was only to serve me, I had no suspicion that\nshe spoke either out of curiosity or by design.\n\n\"Nevertheless, contrary to all probability, I saw into the bottom of\nthe matter; I was in love with Madam de Themines, but though she loved\nme again, I was not happy enough to have private places to see her in\nwithout danger of being discovered there, and so I was satisfied she\ncould not be the person the Queen meant; I knew also, that I had an\nintrigue with another woman less handsome and less reserved than Madam\nde Themines, and that it was not impossible but the place where I saw\nher might be discovered; but as this was a business I little cared for,\nit was easy for me to guard against all sorts of danger by forbearing\nto see her; I resolved therefore to acknowledge nothing of it to the\nQueen, but to assure her on the contrary that I had a long time laid\naside the desire of gaining women's affections, even where I might hope\nfor success, because I found them all in some measure unworthy of\nengaging the heart of an honourable man, and that it must be something\nvery much above them which could touch me. 'You do not answer me\ningenuously,' replied the Queen; 'I am satisfied of the contrary; the\nfree manner in which I speak to you ought to oblige you to conceal\nnothing from me; I would have you,' continued she, 'be of the number of\nmy friends; but I would not, after having admitted you into that rank,\nbe ignorant of your engagements; consider, whether you think my\nfriendship will be too dear at the price of making me your confidant; I\ngive you two days to think on it; but then, consider well of the answer\nyou shall make me, and remember that if ever I find hereafter you have\ndeceived me, I shall never forgive you as long as I live.'\n\n\"Having said this, the Queen left me without waiting for my answer; you\nmay imagine how full my thoughts were of what she had said to me; the\ntwo days she had given me to consider of it I did not think too long a\ntime to come to a resolution; I found she had a mind to know if I was\nin love, and that her desire was I should not be so; I foresaw the\nconsequences of what I was going to do, my vanity was flattered with\nthe thought of having a particular interest with the Queen, and a Queen\nwhose person is still extremely amiable; on the other hand, I was in\nlove with Madam de Themines, and though I had committed a petty treason\nagainst her by my engagement with the other woman I told you of, I\ncould not find in my heart to break with her; I foresaw also the danger\nI should expose myself to, if I deceived the Queen, and how hard it\nwould be to do it; nevertheless I could not resolve to refuse what\nfortune offered me, and was willing to run the hazard of anything my\nill conduct might draw upon me; I broke with her with whom I kept a\ncorrespondence that might be discovered, and was in hopes of concealing\nthat I had with Madam de Themines.\n\n\"At the two days' end, as I entered the room where the Queen was with\nall the ladies about her, she said aloud to me, and with a grave air\nthat was surprising enough, 'Have you thought of the business I charged\nyou with, and do you know the truth of it?' 'Yes, Madam,' answered I,\n'and 'tis as I told your Majesty.' 'Come in the evening, when I am\nwriting,' replied she, 'and you shall have further orders.'  I made a\nrespectful bow without answering anything, and did not fail to attend\nat the hour she had appointed me.  I found her in the gallery, with her\nsecretary and one of her women.  As soon as she saw me she came to me,\nand took me to the other end of the gallery;  'Well,' says she, 'after\nhaving considered thoroughly of this matter, have you nothing to say to\nme, and as to my manner of treating you, does not it deserve that you\nshould deal sincerely with me?'  'It is, Madam,' answered I, 'because I\ndeal sincerely, that I have nothing more to say, and I swear to your\nMajesty with all the respect I owe you, that I have no engagement with\nany woman of the Court.'  'I will believe it,' replied the Queen,\n'because I wish it; and I wish it, because I desire to have you\nentirely mine, and because it would be impossible for me to be\nsatisfied with your friendship, if you were in love; one cannot confide\nin those who are; one cannot be secure of their secrecy; they are too\nmuch divided, and their mistresses have always the first place in their\nthoughts, which does not suit at all with the manner in which I would\nhave you live with me: remember then, it is upon your giving me your\nword that you have no engagement, that I choose you for my confidant;\nremember, I insist on having you entirely to myself, and that you shall\nhave no friend of either sex but such as I shall approve, and that you\nabandon every care but that of pleasing me; I'll not desire you to\nneglect any opportunity for advancing your fortune; I'll conduct your\ninterests with more application than you can yourself, and whatever I\ndo for you, I shall think myself more than recompensed, if you answer\nmy expectations; I make choice of you, to open my heart's griefs to\nyou, and to have your assistance in softening them; you may imagine\nthey are not small; I bear in appearance without much concern the\nKing's engagement with the Duchess of Valentinois, but it is\ninsupportable to me; she governs the King, she imposes upon him, she\nslights me, all my people are at her beck.  The Queen, my\ndaughter-in-law, proud of her beauty, and the authority of her uncles,\npays me no respect. The Constable Montmorency is master of the King and\nkingdom; he hates me, and has given proofs of his hatred, which I shall\nnever forget.  The Mareschal de St. Andre is a bold young favourite,\nwho uses me no better than the others.  The detail of my misfortunes\nwould move your pity; hitherto I have not dared to confide in anybody,\nI confide in you, take care that I never repent it, and be my only\nconsolation.'  The Queen blushed, when she had ended this discourse,\nand I was so truly touched with the goodness she had expressed to me,\nthat I was going to throw myself at her feet: from that day she has\nplaced an entire confidence in me, she has done nothing without\nadvising with me, and the intimacy and union between us still subsists.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\"In the meantime, however busy and full I was of my new engagement with\nthe Queen, I still kept fair with Madam de Themines by a natural\ninclination which it was not in my power to conquer; I thought she\ncooled in her love to me, and whereas, had I been prudent, I should\nhave made use of the change I observed in her for my cure, my love\nredoubled upon it, and I managed so ill that the Queen got some\nknowledge of this intrigue.  Jealousy is natural to persons of her\nnation, and perhaps she had a greater affection for me than she even\nimagined herself; at least the report of my being in love gave her so\nmuch uneasiness, that I thought myself entirely ruined with her;\nhowever I came into favour again by virtue of submissions, false oaths,\nand assiduity; but I should not have been able to have deceived her\nlong, had not Madam de Themines's change disengaged me from her against\nmy will; she convinced me she no longer loved me, and I was so\nthoroughly satisfied of it, that I was obliged to give her no further\nuneasiness, but to let her be quiet.  Some time after she wrote me this\nletter which I have lost; I learned from it, she had heard of the\ncorrespondence I had with the other woman I told you of, and that that\nwas the reason of her change.  As I had then nothing further left to\ndivide me, the Queen was well enough satisfied with me; but the\nsentiments I have for her not being of a nature to render me incapable\nof other engagements, and love not being a thing that depends on our\nwill, I fell in love with Madam de Martigues, of whom I was formerly a\ngreat admirer, while she was with Villemontais, maid of honour to the\nQueen-Dauphin; I have reason to believe she does not hate me; the\ndiscretion I observe towards her, and which she does not wholly know\nthe reasons of, is very agreeable to her; the Queen has not the least\nsuspicion on her account, but she has another jealousy which is not\nless troublesome; as Madam de Martigues is constantly with the\nQueen-Dauphin, I go there much oftener than usual; the Queen imagines\nthat 'tis this Princess I am in love with; the Queen-Dauphin's rank,\nwhich is equal to her own, and the superiority of her youth and beauty,\ncreate a jealousy that rises even to fury, and fills her with a hatred\nagainst her daughter-in-law that cannot be concealed.  The Cardinal of\nLoraine, who, I believe has been long aspiring to the Queen's favour,\nand would be glad to fill the place I possess, is, under pretence of\nreconciling the two Queens, become master of the differences between\nthem; I doubt not but he has discovered the true cause of the Queen's\nanger, and I believe he does me all manner of ill offices, without\nletting her see that he designs it. This is the condition my affairs\nare in at present; judge what effect may be produced by the letter\nwhich I have lost, and which I unfortunately put in my pocket with\ndesign to restore it to Madam de Themines: if the Queen sees this\nletter, she will know I have deceived her; and that almost at the very\nsame time that I deceived her for Madam de Themines, I deceived Madam\nde Themines for another; judge what an idea this will give her of me,\nand whether she will ever trust me again.  If she does not see the\nletter, what shall I say to her?  She knows it has been given to the\nQueen-Dauphin; she will think Chatelart knew that Queen's hand, and\nthat the letter is from her; she will fancy the person of whom the\nletter expresses a jealousy, is perhaps herself; in short, there is\nnothing which she may not think, and there is nothing which I ought not\nto fear from her thoughts; add to this, that I am desperately in love\nwith Madam de Martigues, and that the Queen-Dauphin will certainly show\nher this letter, which she will conclude to have been lately writ.\nThus shall I be equally embroiled both with the person I love most, and\nwith the person I have most cause to fear.  Judge, after this, if I\nhave not reason to conjure you to say the letter is yours, and to beg\nof you to get it out of the Queen-Dauphin's hands.\"\n\n\"I am very well satisfied,\" answered the Duke de Nemours, \"that one\ncannot be in a greater embarrassment than that you are in, and it must\nbe confessed you deserve it; I have been accused of being inconstant in\nmy amours, and of having had several intrigues at the same time, but\nyou out-go me so far, that I should not so much as have dared to\nimagine what you have undertaken; could you pretend to keep Madam de\nThemines, and be at the same engaged with the Queen? did you hope to\nhave an engagement with the Queen, and be able to deceive her? she is\nboth an Italian and a Queen, and by consequence full of jealousy,\nsuspicion, and pride.  As soon as your good fortune, rather than your\ngood conduct, had set you at liberty from an engagement you was\nentangled in, you involved yourself in new ones, and you fancied that\nin the midst of the Court you could be in love with Madam de Martigues\nwithout the Queen's perceiving it: you could not have been too careful\nto take from her the shame of having made the first advances; she has a\nviolent passion for you; you have more discretion than to tell it me,\nand I than to ask you to tell it; it is certain she is jealous of you,\nand has truth on her side.\"  \"And does it belong to you,\" interrupted\nthe Viscount, \"to load me with reprimands, and ought not your own\nexperience to make you indulgent to my faults? However I grant I am to\nblame; but think, I conjure you, how to draw me out of this\ndifficulty\"; \"I think you must go to the Queen-Dauphin as soon as she\nis awake, and ask her for the letter, as if you had lost it.\"  \"I have\ntold you already,\" replied the Duke de Nemours, \"that what you propose\nis somewhat extraordinary, and that there are difficulties in it which\nmay affect my own particular interest; but besides, if this letter has\nbeen seen to drop out of your pocket, I should think it would be hard\nto persuade people that it dropped out of mine.\"  \"I thought I had told\nyou,\" replied the Viscount, \"that the Queen-Dauphin had been informed\nthat you dropped it.\"  \"How,\" said the Duke de Nemours hastily,\napprehending the ill consequence this mistake might be of to him with\nMadam de Cleves, \"has the Queen-Dauphin been told I dropped the\nletter?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Viscount, \"she has been told so; and what\noccasioned the mistake was, that there were several gentlemen of the\ntwo Queens in a room belonging to the tennis court, where our clothes\nwere put up, when your servants and mine went together to fetch them;\nthen it was the letter fell out of the pocket; those gentlemen took it\nup, and read it aloud; some believed it belonged to you, and others to\nme; Chatelart, who took it, and to whom I have just sent for it, says,\nhe gave it to the Queen-Dauphin as a letter of yours; and those who\nhave spoken of it to the Queen have unfortunately told her it was mine;\nso that you may easily do what I desire of you, and free me from this\nperplexity.\"\n\nThe Duke de Nemours had always had a great friendship for the Viscount\nde Chartres, and the relation he bore to Madam de Cleves still made him\nmore dear to him; nevertheless he could not prevail with himself to run\nthe risk of her having heard of this letter, as of a thing in which he\nwas concerned; he fell into a deep musing, and the Viscount guessed\npretty near what was the subject of his meditations; \"I plainly see,\"\nsaid he, \"that you are afraid of embroiling yourself with your\nmistress, and I should almost fancy the Queen-Dauphin was she, if the\nlittle jealousy you seem to have of Monsieur d'Anville did not take me\noff from that thought; but be that as it will, it is not reasonable you\nshould sacrifice your repose to mine, and I'll put you in a way of\nconvincing her you love, that this letter is directed to me, and not to\nyou; here is a billet from Madam d'Amboise, who is a friend of Madam de\nThemines, and was her confidant in the amour between her and me; in\nthis she desires me to send her Madam de Themines's letter, which I\nhave lost; my name is on the superscription, and the contents of the\nbillet prove, without question, that the letter she desires is the same\nwith that which has been found; I'll leave this billet in your hands,\nand agree that you may show it to your mistress in your justification;\nI conjure you not to lose a moment, but to go this morning to the\nQueen-Dauphin.\"\n\nThe Duke de Nemours promised the Viscount he would, and took Madam\nd'Amboise's billet; nevertheless his design was not to see the\nQueen-Dauphin; he thought more pressing business required his care; he\nmade no question, but she had already spoke of the letter to Madam de\nCleves, and could not bear that a person he loved so desperately,\nshould have ground to believe he had engagements with any other.\n\nHe went to the Princess of Cleves as soon as he thought she might be\nawake; and ordered her to be told, that, if he had not business of the\nlast consequence, he would not have desired the honour to see her at so\nextraordinary an hour.  Madam de Cleves was in bed, and her mind was\ntossed to and fro by a thousand melancholy thoughts that she had had\nduring the night; she was extremely surprised to hear the Duke de\nNemours asked for her; the anxiety she was in made her presently\nanswer, that she was ill, and could not speak with him.\n\nThe Duke was not at all shocked at this refusal; he thought it presaged\nhim no ill, that she expressed a little coldness at a time when she\nmight be touched with jealousy.  He went to the Prince of Cleves's\napartment, and told him he came from that of his lady, and that he was\nvery sorry he could not see her, because he had an affair to\ncommunicate to her of great consequence to the Viscount de Chartres; he\nexplained in few words to the Prince the importance of this business,\nand the Prince immediately introduced him into his lady's chamber.  Had\nshe not been in the dark, she would have found it hard to have\nconcealed the trouble and astonishment she was in to see the Duke de\nNemours introduced by her husband.  Monsieur de Cleves told her the\nbusiness was about a letter, wherein her assistance was wanting for the\ninterest of the Viscount, that she was to consult with Monsieur de\nNemours what was to be done; and that as for him he was going to the\nKing, who had just sent for him.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours had his heart's desire, in being alone with Madam\nde Cleves; \"I am come to ask you, Madam,\" said he, \"if the\nQueen-Dauphin has not spoke to you of a letter which Chatelart gave her\nyesterday.\"  \"She said something to me of it,\" replied Madam de Cleves,\n\"but I don't see what relation this letter his to the interests of my\nuncle, and I can assure you that he is not named in it.\"  \"It is true,\nMadam,\" replied the Duke de Nemours, \"he is not named in it but yet it\nis addressed to him, and it very much imports him that you should get\nit out of the Queen-Dauphin's hands.\"  \"I cannot comprehend,\" replied\nthe Princess, \"how it should be of any consequence to him, if this\nletter should be seen, nor what reason there is to redemand it in his\nname.\"  \"If you please to be at leisure to hear me, Madam,\" said\nMonsieur de Nemours, \"I'll presently make you acquainted with the true\nstate of the thing, and inform you of matters of so great importance to\nthe Viscount, that I would not even have trusted the Prince of Cleves\nwith them, had I not stood in need of his assistance to have the honour\nto see you.\"  \"I believe,\" said Madam de Cleves in a very unconcerned\nmanner, \"that anything you may give yourself the trouble of telling me,\nwill be to little purpose; you had better go to the Queen-Dauphin, and\nplainly tell her, without using these roundabout ways, the interest you\nhave in that letter, since she has been told, as well as I, that it\nbelongs to you.\"\n\nThe uneasiness of mind which Monsieur de Nemours observed in Madam de\nCleves gave him the most sensible pleasure he ever knew, and lessened\nhis impatience to justify himself:  \"I don't know, Madam,\" replied he,\n\"what the Queen-Dauphin may have been told; but I am not at all\nconcerned in that letter; it is addressed to the Viscount.\"  \"I believe\nso,\" replied Madam de Cleves, \"but the Queen-Dauphin has heard to the\ncontrary, and she won't think it very probable that the Viscount's\nletters should fall out of your pocket; you must therefore have some\nreason, that I don't know of, for concealing the truth of this matter\nfrom the Queen-Dauphin; I advise you to confess it to her.\"  \"I have\nnothing to confess to her,\" says he, \"the letter is not directed to me,\nand if there be anyone that I would have satisfied of it, it is not the\nQueen-Dauphin; but, Madam, since the Viscount's interest is nearly\nconcerned in this, be pleased to let me acquaint you with some matters\nthat are worthy of your curiosity.\"  Madam de Cleves by her silence\nshowed her readiness to hear him, and he as succinctly as possible\nrelated to her all he had just heard from the Viscount.  Though the\ncircumstances were naturally surprising, and proper to create\nattention, yet Madam de Cleves heard them with such coldness, that she\nseemed either not to believe them true, or to think them indifferent to\nher; she continued in this temper until the Duke de Nemours spoke of\nMadam d'Amboise's billet, which was directed to the Viscount, and was a\nproof of all he had been saying; as Madam de Cleves knew that this lady\nwas a friend of Madam de Themines, she found some probability in what\nthe Duke de Nemours had said, which made her think, that the letter\nperhaps was not addressed to him; this thought suddenly, and in spite\nof herself, drew her out of the coldness and indifferency she had until\nthen been in.  The Duke having read the billet, which fully justified\nhim, presented it to her to read, and told her she might possibly know\nthe hand. She could not forbear taking it, and examining the\nsuperscription to see if it was addressed to the Viscount de Chartres,\nand reading it all over, that she might the better judge, if the letter\nwhich was redemanded was the same with that she had in her hand.  The\nDuke de Nemours added whatever he thought proper to persuade her of it;\nand as one is easily persuaded of the truth of what one wishes, he soon\nconvinced Madam de Cleves that he had no concern in the letter.\n\nShe began now to reason with him concerning the embarrassment and\ndanger the Viscount was in, to blame his ill conduct, and to think of\nmeans to help him: she was astonished at the Queen's proceedings, and\nconfessed to the Duke that she had the letter; in short, she no sooner\nbelieved him innocent, but she discoursed with him with greater ease\nand freedom, concerning what she would scarce before vouchsafe to hear;\nthey agreed that the letter should not be restored to the\nQueen-Dauphin, for fear she should show it to Madam de Martigues, who\nknew Madam de Themines's hand, and would easily guess, by the interest\nshe had in the Viscount, that it was addressed to him; they agreed\nalso, that they ought not to entrust the Queen-Dauphin with all that\nconcerned the Queen her mother-in-law.  Madam de Cleves, under pretence\nof serving her uncle, was pleased to be the Duke de Nemours's confidant\nin the secrets he had imparted to her.\n\nThe Duke would not have confined his discourse to the Viscount's\nconcerns, but from the liberty he had of free conversation with her,\nwould have assumed a boldness he had never yet done, had not a message\nbeen brought in to Madam de Cleves, that the Queen-Dauphin had sent for\nher.  The Duke was forced to withdraw; he went to the Viscount to\ninform him, that after he had left him, he thought it more proper to\napply to Madam de Cleves, his niece, than to go directly to the\nQueen-Dauphin; he did not want reasons to make him approve what he had\ndone, and to give him hopes of good success.\n\nIn the meantime Madam de Cleves dressed herself in all haste to go to\nthe Queen-Dauphin; she was no sooner entered her chamber, but she\ncalled her to her, and whispered her, \"I have been waiting for you\nthese two hours, and was never so perplexed about disguising a truth as\nI have been this morning: the Queen has heard of the letter I gave you\nyesterday, and believes it was the Viscount de Chartres that dropped\nit; you know, she has some interest to be satisfied in it; she has been\nin search for the letter, and has caused Chatelart to be asked for it;\nwho said he had given it to me; they have been to ask me for it, under\npretence it was an ingenious letter which the Queen had a curiosity to\nsee; I durst not say that you had it, for fear she should think I had\ngiven it you on your uncle the Viscount's account, and that there was a\ncorrespondence between him and me. I was already satisfied that his\nseeing me so often gave her uneasiness, so that I said the letter was\nin the clothes I had on yesterday, and that those who had them in\nkeeping were gone abroad; give me the letter immediately,\" added she,\n\"that I may send it her, and that I may read it before I send it to see\nif I know the hand.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves was harder put to it than she expected; \"I don't know,\nMadam, what you will do,\" answered she, \"for Monsieur de Cleves, to\nwhom I gave it to read, returned it to the Duke of Nemours, who came\nearly this morning to beg him to get it of you. Monsieur de Cleves had\nthe imprudence to tell him he had it, and the weakness to yield to the\nentreaties the Duke de Nemours made that he would restore it him.\"\n\"You throw me into the greatest embarrassment I can possibly be in,\"\nreplied the Queen-Dauphin; \"and you have given this letter to the Duke\nde Nemours.  Since it was I that gave it you, you ought not to have\nrestored it without my leave; what would you have me say to the Queen,\nand what can she imagine?  She will think, and not without reason, that\nthis letter concerns myself, and that there is something between the\nViscount and me; she will never be persuaded the letter belonged to the\nDuke de Nemours.\"  \"I am very much concerned,\" replied Madam de Cleves,\n\"for the misfortune I have occasioned, and I believe the difficulty I\nhave brought you into is very great; but 'twas Monsieur de Cleves's\nfault, and not mine.\"  \"You are in fault,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin,\n\"for having given him the letter; and I believe you are the only woman\nin the world that acquaints her husband with all she knows.\" \"I\nacknowledge myself in fault, Madam,\" replied the Princess of Cleves,\n\"but let us rather think of preventing the consequences of what I have\ndone, than insist on the fault itself.\"  \"Do you remember, pretty near,\nwhat the letter contains?\" says the Queen-Dauphin.  \"Yes, Madam, I do,\"\nreplied she, \"for I have read it over more than once.\"  \"If so,\" said\nthe Queen-Dauphin, \"you must immediately get it written out in an\nunknown hand, and I'll send it to the Queen; she'll not show it those\nwho have seen it already; and though she should, I'll stand in it, that\nit is the same Chatelart gave me; and he'll not dare to say otherwise.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves approved of this expedient, and the more because it\ngave her an opportunity of sending for the Duke de Nemours, to have the\nletter itself again, in order to have it copied word for word,\nimitating as near as may be the hand it was written in, and she thought\nthis would effectually deceive the Queen.  As soon as she was got home,\nshe informed her husband of what had passed between her and the\nQueen-Dauphin, and begged him to send for the Duke de Nemours.  The\nDuke was sent for, and came immediately; Madam de Cleves told him all\nshe had told her husband, and asked for the letter; but the Duke\nanswered, that he had already returned it to the Viscount de Chartres,\nwho was so overjoyed upon having it again, and being freed from the\ndanger he was in, that he sent it immediately to Madam de Themines's\nfriend.  Madam de Cleves was in a new embarrassment on this occasion:\nin short, after having consulted together, they resolved to form the\nletter by memory; and, in order to go about it, they locked themselves\nup, and left orders that nobody should be admitted, and that all the\nDuke de Nemours's attendants should be sent away.  Such an appearance\nof secret confidence was no small charm to Monsieur de Nemours, and\neven to Madam de Cleves; her husband's presence, and the interests of\nher uncle the Viscount de Chartres, were considerations which in great\nmeasure removed her scruples, and made this opportunity of seeing and\nbeing with the Duke de Nemours so agreeable to her, that she never\nbefore experienced a joy so pure and free from allay; this threw her\ninto a freedom and gaiety of spirit which the Duke had never observed\nin her till now, and which made him still more passionately in love\nwith her: as he had never known such agreeable moments, his vivacity\nwas much heightened; and whenever Madam de Cleves was beginning to\nrecollect and write the letter, instead of assisting her seriously, did\nnothing but interrupt her with wit and pleasantry. Madam de Cleves was\nas gay as he, so that they had been locked up a considerable time, and\ntwo messages had come from the Queen-Dauphin to hasten Madam de Cleves,\nbefore they had half finished the letter.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours was glad to prolong the time that was so agreeable\nto him, and neglected the concerns of his friend; Madam de Cleves was\nnot at all tired, and neglected also the concerns of her uncle: at\nlast, with much ado, about four o'clock the letter was finished, and\nwas so ill done, and the copy so unlike the original, as to the\nhandwriting, that the queen must have taken very little care to come at\nthe truth of the matter, if she had been imposed on by so ill a\ncounterfeit.  Accordingly she was not deceived; and however industrious\nthey were to persuade her, that this letter was addressed to the Duke\nde Nemours, she remained satisfied not only that it was addressed to\nthe Viscount de Chartres, but that the Queen-Dauphin was concerned in\nit, and that there was a correspondence between them; this heightened\nher hatred against that Princess to such a degree, that she never\nforgave her, and never ceased persecuting her till she had driven her\nout of France.\n\nAs for the Viscount de Chartres, his credit was entirely ruined with\nher; and whether the Cardinal of Loraine had already insinuated himself\nso far into her esteem as to govern her, or whether the accident of\nthis letter, which made it appear that the Viscount had deceived her,\nenabled her to discover the other tricks he had played her, it is\ncertain he could never after entirely reconcile himself to her; their\ncorrespondence was broke off, and at length she ruined him by means of\nthe conspiracy of Amboise, in which he was involved.\n\nAfter the letter was sent to the Queen-Dauphin, Monsieur de Cleves and\nMonsieur de Nemours went away; Madam de Cleves continued alone, and\nbeing no longer supported by the joy which the presence of what one\nloves gives one, she seemed like one newly waked from a dream; she\nbeheld, with astonishment, the difference between the condition she was\nin the night before, and that she was in at this time: she called to\nmind, how cold and sullen she was to the Duke de Nemours, while she\nthought Madam de Themines's letter was addressed to him, and how calm\nand sweet a situation of mind succeeded that uneasiness, as soon as he\nwas satisfied he was not concerned in that letter; when she reflected,\nthat she reproached herself as guilty for having given him the\nforegoing day only some marks of sensibility, which mere compassion\nmight have produced, and that by her peevish humour this morning, she\nhad expressed such a jealousy as was a certain proof of passion, she\nthought she was not herself; when she reflected further, that the Duke\nde Nemours saw plainly that she knew he was in love with her, and that,\nnotwithstanding her knowing it, she did not use him the worse for it,\neven in her husband's presence; but that, on the contrary, she had\nnever behaved so favourably to him; when she considered, she was the\ncause of Monsieur de Cleves's sending for him, and that she had just\npassed an afternoon in private with him; when she considered all this,\nshe found, there was something within her that held intelligence with\nthe Duke de Nemours, and that she deceived a husband who least deserved\nit; and she was ashamed to appear so little worthy of esteem, even in\nthe eyes of her lover; but what she was able to support less than all\nthe rest was, the remembrance of the condition in which she spent the\nlast night, and the pricking griefs she felt from a suspicion that the\nDuke de Nemours was in love with another, and that she was deceived by\nhim.\n\nNever till then was she acquainted with the dreadful inquietudes that\nflow from jealousy and distrust; she had applied all her cares to\nprevent herself from falling in love with the Duke de Nemours, and had\nnot before had any fear of his being in love with another: though the\nsuspicions which this letter had given her were effaced, yet they left\nher sensible of the hazard there was of being deceived, and gave her\nimpressions of distrust and jealousy which she had never felt till that\ntime; she was surprised that she had never yet reflected how improbable\nit was that a man of the Duke de Nemours's turn, who had showed so much\ninconstancy towards women, should be capable of a lasting and sincere\npassion; she thought it next to impossible for her to be convinced of\nthe truth of his love; \"But though I could be convinced of it,\" says\nshe, \"what have I to do in it?  Shall I permit it?  Shall I make a\nreturn?  Shall I engage in gallantry, be false to Monsieur de Cleves,\nand be false to myself?  In a word, shall I go to expose myself to the\ncruel remorses and deadly griefs that rise from love?  I am subdued and\nvanquished by a passion, which hurries me away in spite of myself; all\nmy resolutions are vain; I had the same thoughts yesterday that I have\ntoday, and I act today contrary to what I resolved yesterday; I must\nconvey myself out of the sight of the Duke de Nemours; I must go into\nthe country, however fantastical my journey may appear; and if Monseur\nde Cleves is obstinately bent to hinder me, or to know my reasons for\nit, perhaps I shall do him and myself the injury to acquaint him with\nthem.\"  She continued in this resolution, and spent the whole evening\nat home, without going to the Queen-Dauphin to enquire what had\nhappened with respect to the counterfeited letter.\n\nWhen the Prince of Cleves returned home, she told him she was resolved\nto go into the country; that she was not very well, and had occasion to\ntake the air.  Monsieur de Cleves, to whom she appeared so beautiful\nthat he could not think her indisposition very considerable, at first\nmade a jest of her design, and answered that she had forgot that the\nnuptials of the Princesses and the tournament were very near, and that\nshe had not too much time to prepare matters so as to appear there as\nmagnificently as other ladies.  What her husband said did not make her\nchange her resolution, and she begged he would agree, that while he was\nat Compiegne with the King, she might go to Colomiers, a pretty house\nthen building, within a day's journey of Paris.  Monsieur de Cleves\nconsented to it; she went thither with a design of not returning so\nsoon, and the King set out for Compiegne, where he was to stay but few\ndays.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours was mightily concerned he had not seen Madam de\nCleves since that afternoon which he had spent so agreeably with her,\nand which had increased his hopes; he was so impatient to see her again\nthat he could not rest; so that when the King returned to Paris, the\nDuke resolved to go to see his sister the Duchess de Mercoeur, who was\nat a country seat of hers very near Colomiers; he asked the Viscount to\ngo with him, who readily consented to it.  The Duke de Nemours did this\nin hopes of visiting Madam de Cleves, in company of the Viscount.\n\nMadam de Mercoeur received them with a great deal of joy, and thought\nof nothing but giving them all the pleasures and diversions of the\ncountry; one day, as they were hunting a stag, the Duke de Nemours lost\nhimself in the forest, and upon enquiring his way was told he was near\nColomiers; at that word, Colomiers, without further reflection, or so\nmuch as knowing what design he was upon, he galloped on full speed the\nway that had been showed him; as he rode along he came by chance to the\nmade-ways and walks, which he judged led to the castle: at the end of\nthese walks he found a pavilion, at the lower end of which was a large\nroom with two closets, the one opening into a flower-garden, and the\nother looking into a spacious walk in the park; he entered the\npavilion, and would have stopped to observe the beauty of it, if he had\nnot seen in the walk the Prince and Princess of Cleves, attended with a\nnumerous train of their domestics.  As he did not expect to meet\nMonsieur de Cleves there, whom he had left with the King, he thought at\nfirst of hiding himself; he entered the closet which looked into the\nflower-garden, with design to go out that way by a door which opened to\nthe forest; but observing Madam de Cleves and her husband were sat down\nunder the pavilion, and that their attendants stayed in the park, and\ncould not come to him without passing by the place where Monsieur and\nMadam de Cleves were, he could not deny himself the pleasure of seeing\nthis Princess, nor resist the curiosity he had to hear her conversation\nwith a husband, who gave him more jealousy than any of his rivals.  He\nheard Monsieur de Cleves say to his wife, \"But why will you not return\nto Paris?  What can keep you here in the country?  You have of late\ntaken a fancy for solitude, at which I am both surprised and concerned,\nbecause it deprives me of your company: I find too, you are more\nmelancholy than usual, and I am afraid you have some cause of grief.\"\n\"I have nothing to trouble my mind,\" answered she with an air of\nconfusion, \"but there is such a bustle at Court, and such a multitude\nof people always at your house, that it is impossible but both body and\nmind should be fatigued, and one cannot but desire repose.\"  \"Repose,\"\nanswered he, \"is not very proper for one of your age; you are at home,\nand at Court, in such a manner as cannot occasion weariness, and I am\nrather afraid you desire to live apart from me.\"  \"You would do me\ngreat wrong to think so,\" replied she with yet more confusion, \"but I\nbeg you to leave me here; if you could stay here, and without company,\nI should be very glad of it; nothing would be more agreeable to me than\nyour conversation in this retirement, provided you would approve not to\nhave about you that infinite number of people, who in a manner never\nleave you.\"  \"Ah!  Madam,\" cries Monsieur de Cleves, \"both your looks\nand words convince me that you have reasons to desire to be alone,\nwhich I don't know; I conjure you to tell them me.\"  He urged her a\ngreat while to inform him, without being able to oblige her to it; and\nafter she had excused herself in a manner which still increased her\nhusband's curiosity, she continued in a deep silence, with her eyes\ncast down then, taking up the discourse on a sudden, and looking upon\nhim, \"Force me not,\" said she, \"to confess a thing to you which I have\nnot the power to confess, though I have often designed it; remember\nonly, that it is not prudent a woman of my years, and mistress of her\nown conduct, should remain exposed in the midst of a Court.\"  \"What is\nit, Madam,\" cried Monsieur de Cleves, \"that you lead me to imagine?  I\ndare not speak it, for fear of offending you.\" Madam de Cleves making\nno answer, her silence confirmed her husband in what he thought; \"You\nsay nothing to me,\" says he, \"and that tells me clearly, that I am not\nmistaken.\"  \"Alas, sir,\" answered she, falling on her knees, \"I am\ngoing to make a confession to you, such as no woman ever yet made to\nher husband; but the innocence of my intentions, and of my conduct,\ngive me power to do it; it is true, I have reasons to absent myself\nfrom Court, and I would avoid the dangers persons of my age are\nsometimes liable to; I have never shown any mark of weakness, and I\ncannot apprehend I ever shall, if you will permit me to retire from\nCourt, since now I have not Madam de Chartres to assist me in my\nconduct; however dangerous a step I am taking, I take it with pleasure\nto preserve myself worthy of you; I ask you a thousand pardons, if I\nhave sentiments which displease you, at least I will never displease\nyou by my actions; consider, that to do what I do, requires more\nfriendship and esteem for a husband than ever wife had; direct my\nconduct, have pity on me, and if you can still love me.\"\n\nMonsieur de Cleves, all the while she spoke, continued leaning his head\non his hand, almost beside himself, and never thought of raising her\nup.  When she had done speaking, and he cast his eyes upon her, and saw\nher on her knees with her face drowned in tears, inimitably beautiful,\nhe was ready to die for grief, and taking her up in his arms, \"Have you\npity on me, Madam,\" says he, \"for I deserve it, and pardon me, if in\nthe first moments of an affliction so violent as mine, I do not answer\nas I ought to so generous a proceeding as yours; I think you more\nworthy of esteem and admiration than any woman that ever was, but I\nfind myself also the most unfortunate of men: you inspired me with\npassion the first moment I saw you, and that passion has never decayed;\nnot your coldness, nor even enjoyment itself, has been able to\nextinguish it; it still continues in its first force, and yet it has\nnot been in my power to kindle in your breast any spark of love for me,\nand now I find you fear you have an inclination for another; and who is\nhe, Madam, this happy man that gives you such apprehensions?  How long\nhas he charmed you? What has he done to charm you?  What method has he\ntaken to get into your heart?  When I could not gain your affections\nmyself, it was some comfort to me to think, that no other could gain\nthem; in the meantime, another has effected what I could not, and I\nhave at once the jealousy of a husband and lover.  But it is impossible\nfor me to retain that of a husband after such a proceeding on your\npart, which is too noble and ingenuous not to give me an entire\nsecurity; it even comforts me as a lover; the sincerity you have\nexpressed, and the confidence you have placed in me are of infinite\nvalue: you have esteem enough for me to believe I shall not abuse the\nconfession you have made to me; you are in the right, Madam, I will not\nabuse it, or love you the less for it; you make me unhappy by the\ngreatest mark of fidelity ever woman gave her husband; but go on,\nMadam, and inform me who he is whom you would avoid.\"  \"I beg you not\nto ask me,\" replied she; \"I am resolved not to tell you, nor do I think\nit prudent to name him.\"  \"Fear not, Madam,\" replied Monsieur de\nCleves, \"I know the world too well to be ignorant that a woman's having\na husband does not hinder people from being in love with her; such\nlovers may be the objects of one's hatred, but we are not to complain\nof it; once again, Madam, I conjure you to tell me what I so much\ndesire to know.\"  \"It is in vain to press me,\" replied she, \"I have the\npower to be silent in what I think I ought not to tell; the confession\nI made to you was not owing to any weakness, and it required more\ncourage to declare such a truth than it would have done to conceal it.\"\n\nThe Duke de Nemours did not lose a word of this conversation, and what\nMadam de Cleves had said gave him no less jealousy than her husband; he\nwas so desperately in love with her, that he believed all the world was\nso too; it is true, he had many rivals, yet he fancied them still more,\nand his thoughts wandered to find out who it was Madam de Cleves meant:\nhe had often thought he was not disagreeable to her, but the grounds of\nhis judgment on this occasion appeared so slight, that he could not\nimagine he had raised in her heart a passion violent enough to oblige\nher to have recourse to so extraordinary a remedy; he was so\ntransported, that he scarce knew what he saw, and he could not pardon\nMonsieur de Cleves for not having pressed his wife enough to tell him\nthe name of the person she concealed from him.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves nevertheless used his utmost endeavours to know it;\nand having urged her very much on the subject; \"I think,\" answered she,\n\"that you ought to be satisfied with my sincerity; ask me no more about\nit, and don't give me cause to repent of what I have done; content\nyourself with the assurance which I once more give you, that my\nsentiments have never appeared by any of my actions, and that no\naddress hath been made to me that could give me offence.\"  \"Ah! Madam,\"\nreplied Monsieur de Cleves on a sudden, \"I cannot believe it; I\nremember the confusion you was in when your picture was lost; you have\ngiven away, Madam, you have given away that picture, which was so dear\nto me, and which I had so just a right to; you have not been able to\nconceal your inclinations, you are in love; it is known; your virtue\nhas hitherto saved you from the rest.\"  \"Is it possible,\" cried Madam\nde Cleves, \"you can imagine there was any reserve or disguise in a\nconfession like mine, which I was no way obliged to?  Take my word, I\npurchase dearly the confidence I desire of you; I conjure you to\nbelieve I have not given away my picture; it is true, I saw it taken,\nbut I would not seem to see it, for fear of subjecting myself to hear\nsuch things as no one has yet dared to mention to me.\"  \"How do you\nknow then that you are loved,\" said Monsieur de Cleves?  \"What mark,\nwhat proof of it has been given you?\"  \"Spare me the pain,\" replied\nshe, \"of repeating to you circumstances which I am ashamed to have\nobserved, and which have convinced me but too much of my own weakness.\"\n\"You are in the right, Madam,\" answered he, \"I am unjust; always refuse\nme when I ask you such things, and yet don't be angry with me for\nasking them.\"\n\nJust then several of the servants, who had stayed in the walks, came to\nacquaint Monsieur de Cleves, that a gentleman was arrived from the\nKing, with orders for him to be at Paris that evening. Monsieur de\nCleves was obliged to go, and had only time to tell his wife that he\ndesired her to come to Paris the next day; and that he conjured her to\nbelieve, that however afflicted he was, he had a tenderness and esteem\nfor her, with which she ought to be satisfied.\n\nWhen he was gone, and Madam de Cleves being alone, considered what she\nhad done, she was so frightened at the thought of it, she could hardly\nbelieve it to be true.  She found she had deprived herself of the heart\nand esteem of her husband, and was involved in a labyrinth she should\nnever get out of; she asked herself why she had ventured on so\ndangerous a step, and perceived she was engaged in it almost without\nhaving designed it; the singularity of such a confession, for which she\nsaw no precedent, made her fully sensible of her danger.\n\nBut on the other hand, when she came to think that this remedy, however\nviolent it was, was the only effectual one she could make use of\nagainst Monsieur de Nemours, she found she had no cause to repent, or\nto believe she had ventured too far; she passed the whole night full of\ndoubts, anxiety and fear; but at last her spirits grew calm again; she\neven felt a pleasure arise in her mind, from a sense of having given\nsuch a proof of fidelity to a husband who deserved it so well, who had\nso great a friendship and esteem for her, and had so lately manifested\nit by the manner in which he received the confession she had made him.\n\nIn the meantime Monsieur de Nemours was gone away from the place, in\nwhich he had overheard a conversation which so sensibly affected him,\nand was got deep into the forest; what Madam de Cleves said of her\npicture had revived him, since it was certain from thence that he was\nthe person she had an inclination for; at first he gave a leap of joy,\nbut his raptures were at an end as soon as he began to reflect, that\nthe same thing that convinced him he had touched the heart of Madam de\nCleves, ought to convince him also that he should never receive any\nmarks of it, and that it would be impossible to engage a lady who had\nrecourse to so extraordinary a remedy; and yet he could not but be\nsensibly pleased to have reduced her to that extremity; he thought it\nglorious for him to have gained the affections of a woman so different\nfrom the rest of her sex; in a word, he thought himself very happy and\nvery unhappy at the same time.  He was benighted in the forest, and was\nvery much put to it to find his way again to his sister's the Duchess\nof Mercoeur; he arrived there at break of day, and was extremely at a\nloss what account to give of his absence, but he made out the matter as\nwell as he could, and returned that very day to Paris with the Viscount.\n\nThe Duke was so taken up with his passion, and so surprised at the\nconversation he had heard, that he fell into an indiscretion very\ncommon, which is, to speak one's own particular sentiments in general\nterms, and to relate one's proper adventures under borrowed names.  As\nthey were travelling he began to talk of love, and exaggerated the\npleasure of being in love with a person that deserved it; he spoke of\nthe fantastical effects of this passion, and at last not being able to\ncontain within himself the admiration he was in at the action of Madam\nde Cleves, he related it to the Viscount without naming the person, or\nowning he had any share in it; but he told it with so much warmth and\nsurprise, that the Viscount easily suspected the story concerned\nhimself. The Viscount urged him very much to confess it, and told him\nhe had known a great while that he was violently in love, and that it\nwas unjust in him to show a distrust of a man who had committed to him\na secret on which his life depended.  The Duke de Nemours was too much\nin love to own it, and had always concealed it from the Viscount,\nthough he valued him the most of any man at Court; he answered that one\nof his friends had told him this adventure, and made him promise not to\nspeak of it; and he also conjured the Viscount to keep the secret: the\nViscount assured him he would say nothing of it but notwithstanding\nMonsieur de Nemours repented that he had told him so much.\n\nIn the meantime Monsieur de Cleves was gone to the King, with a heart\nfull of sorrow and affliction.  Never had husband so violent a passion\nfor his wife, or so great an esteem; what she had told him did not take\naway his esteem of her, but made it of a different nature from that he\nhad had before; what chiefly employed his thoughts, was a desire to\nguess who it was that had found out the secret to win her heart; the\nDuke de Nemours was the first person he thought of on this occasion, as\nbeing the handsomest man at Court; and the Chevalier de Guise, and the\nMareschal de St. Andre occurred next, as two persons who had made it\ntheir endeavour to get her love, and who were still very assiduous in\ncourting her, so that he was fully persuaded it must be one of the\nthree.  He arrived at the Louvre, and the King carried him into his\ncloset to inform him he had made choice of him to conduct Madame into\nSpain, and that he believed nobody could acquit himself better of that\ncharge, nor that any lady would do France greater honour than Madam de\nCleves.  Monsieur de Cleves received the honour the King had done him\nby this choice with the respect he ought, and he considered it also as\nwhat would take his wife from Court, without leaving room to suspect\nany change in her conduct; but the embarrassment he was under required\na speedier remedy than that journey, which was to be deferred a great\nwhile, could afford; he immediately wrote to Madam de Cleves to\nacquaint her with what the King had told him, and gave her to\nunderstand he absolutely expected she should return to Paris.  She\nreturned according to his orders, and when they met, they found one\nanother overwhelmed with melancholy.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves spoke to her, as a man of the greatest honour in the\nworld, and the best deserving the confidence she had reposed in him; \"I\nam not alarmed as to your conduct,\" said he, \"you have more strength\nand virtue than you imagine; I am not alarmed with fears of what may\nhappen hereafter; what troubles me is  that I see you have those\nsentiments for another which you want for me.\"  \"I don't know what to\nanswer you,\" said she, \"I die with shame when I speak of this subject\nspare me, I conjure you, such cruel conversations; regulate my conduct,\nand never let me see anybody; this is all I desire of you; but take it\nnot ill of me, if I speak no more of a thing which makes me appear so\nlittle worthy of you, and which I think so unbecoming me.\"  \"You are in\nthe right, Madam;\" replied he, \"I abuse your goodness and your\nconfidence in me; but have some compassion also on the condition you\nhave brought me to, and think that whatever you have told me, you\nconceal from me a name, which creates in me a curiosity I cannot live\nwithout satisfying; and yet I ask you not to satisfy it; I cannot,\nhowever, forbear telling you, that I believe the man I am to envy is\nthe Mareschal de St. Andre, the Duke de Nemours, or the Chevalier de\nGuise.\" \"I shall make you no answer,\" says she blushing, \"nor give you\nany ground from what I say, either to lessen or strengthen your\nsuspicions; but if you endeavour to inform yourself by observing me,\nyou will throw me into a confusion all the world will take notice of,\nfor God's sake,\" continued she, \"allow me under pretence of an\nindisposition to see nobody.\"  \"No, Madam,\" said he, \"it will quickly\nbe discovered to be a feigned business; and besides, I am unwilling to\ntrust you to anything but yourself; my heart tells me this is the best\nway I can take, and my reason tells me so also, considering the temper\nof mind you are in, I cannot put a greater restraint upon you than by\nleaving you to your liberty.\"\n\nMonsieur de Cleves was not mistaken; the confidence he showed he had in\nhis wife, fortified her the more against Monsieur de Nemours, and made\nher take more severe resolutions than any restraint could have brought\nher to.  She went to wait on the Queen-Dauphin at the Louvre as she\nused to do, but avoided the presence and eyes of Monsieur de Nemours\nwith so much care, that she deprived him of almost all the joy he had\nin thinking she loved him; he saw nothing in her actions but what\nseemed to show the contrary; he scarcely knew if what he had heard was\nnot a dream, so very improbable it seemed to him; the only thing which\nassured him that he was not mistaken, was Madam de Cleves's extreme\nmelancholy, which appeared, whatever pains she took to hide it; and\nperhaps kind words and looks would not have increased the Duke of\nNemours's love so much as this severe conduct did.\n\nOne evening, as Monsieur and Madam de Cleves were at the Queen's\napartment, it was said there was a report that the King would name\nanother great lord to wait on Madame into Spain.  Monsieur de Cleves\nhad his eye fixed on his wife, when it was further said, the Chevalier\nde Guise, or the Mareschal de St. Andre, was the person; he observed\nshe was not at all moved at either of those names, nor the discourse of\ntheir going along with her; this made him believe, it was not either of\nthem whose presence she feared.  In order to clear up his suspicions,\nhe went into the Queen's closet, where the King then was, and after\nhaving stayed there some time came back to his wife, and whispered her,\nthat he had just heard the Duke de Nemours was the person designed to\ngo along with them to Spain.\n\nThe name of the Duke de Nemours, and the thought of being exposed to\nsee him every day, during a very long journey, in her husband's\npresence, so affected Madam de Cleves, that she could not conceal her\ntrouble: and being willing to give other reasons for it, \"No choice,\"\nsays she, \"could have been made more disagreeable for you; he will\nshare all honours with you, and I think you ought to endeavour to get\nsome other chosen.\"  \"It is not honour, Madam,\" replied Monsieur de\nCleves, \"that makes you apprehensive of the Duke de Nemours's going\nwith me, the uneasiness you are in proceeds from another cause; and\nfrom this uneasiness of yours I learn, that which I should have\ndiscovered in another woman, by the joy she would have expressed on\nsuch an occasion; but be not afraid; what I have told you is not true,\nit was an invention of mine to assure myself of a thing which I already\nbelieved but too much.\"\n\nHaving said this, he went out, being unwilling to increase, by his\npresence, the concern he saw his wife in.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours came in that instant, and presently observed Madam\nde Cleves's condition; he came up to her, and told her softly, he had\nthat respect for her, he durst not ask what it was made her more\npensive than usual.  The voice of the Duke de Nemours brought her to\nherself again, and looking at him, without having heard what he had\nsaid to her, full of her own thoughts, and afraid lest her husband\nshould see him with her, \"For God's sake,\" says she, \"leave me to\nmyself in quiet.\"  \"Alas, Madam,\" answered he, \"I disturb you too\nlittle; what is it you can complain of?  I dare not speak to you, I\ndare not look upon you, I tremble whenever I approach you.  How have I\ndrawn upon myself what you have said to me, and why do you show me that\nI am in part the cause of the trouble I see you in?\"  Madam de Cleves\nwas very sorry to have given the Duke an opportunity of explaining\nhimself more clearly than ever he had done before; she left him without\nmaking any answer, and went home with her mind more agitated than ever.\nHer husband perceived her concern was increased, and that she was\nafraid he would speak to her of what had passed, and followed her into\nher closet; \"Do not shun me, Madam,\" says he, \"I will say nothing to\nyou that shall displease you; I ask pardon for the surprise I gave you\na while ago; I am sufficiently punished by what I have learnt from it;\nthe Duke de Nemours was of all men he whom I most feared; I see the\ndanger you are in; command yourself for your own sake, and, if it is\npossible, for mine; I do not ask this of you as a husband, but as a man\nwhose happiness wholly depends on you, and who loves you more violently\nand more tenderly than he whom your heart prefers to me.\"  Monsieur de\nCleves was melted upon speaking these words, and could scarce make an\nend of them; his wife was so moved, she burst into tears, and embraced\nhim with a tenderness and sorrow that put him into a condition not very\ndifferent from her own; they continued silent a while, and parted\nwithout having the power to speak to one another.\n\nAll things were ready for the marriage of Madame, and the Duke of Alva\nwas arrived to espouse her; he was received with all the ceremony and\nmagnificence that could be displayed on such an occasion; the King sent\nto meet him the Prince of Conde, the Cardinals of Loraine and Guise,\nthe Dukes of Loraine and Ferrara, d'Aumale, de Bouillon, de Guise, and\nde Nemours; they had a great number of gentlemen, and a great many\npages in livery; the King himself, attended with two hundred gentlemen,\nand the Constable at their head, received the Duke of Alva at the first\ngate of the Louvre; the Duke would have kneeled down, but the King\nrefused it, and made him walk by his side to the Queen's apartment, and\nto Madame's, to whom the Duke of Alva had brought a magnificent present\nfrom his master; he went thence to the apartment of Madam Margaret the\nKing's sister, to compliment her on the part of the Duke of Savoy, and\nto assure her he would arrive in a few days; there were great\nassemblies at the Louvre, the show the Duke of Alva, and the Prince of\nOrange who accompanied him, the beauties of the Court.\n\nMadam de Cleves could not dispense with going to these assemblies,\nhowever desirous she was to be absent, for fear of disobliging her\nhusband, who absolutely commanded her to be there; and what yet more\ninduced her to it, was the absence of the Duke de Nemours; he was gone\nto meet the Duke of Savoy, and after the arrival of that Prince, he was\nobliged to be almost always with him, to assist him in everything\nrelating to the ceremonies of the nuptials; for this reason Madam de\nCleves did not meet him so often as she used to do, which gave her some\nsort of ease.\n\nThe Viscount de Chartres had not forgot the conversation he had had\nwith the Duke de Nemours: it still ran in his mind that the adventure\nthe Duke had related to him was his own; and he observed him so\ncarefully that it is probable he would have unravelled the business, if\nthe arrival of the Duke of Alva and of the Duke of Savoy had not made\nsuch an alteration in the Court, and filled it with so much business,\nas left no opportunities for a discovery of that nature; the desire he\nhad to get some information about it, or rather the natural disposition\none has to relate all one knows to those one loves, made him acquaint\nMadam de Martigues with the extraordinary action of that person who had\nconfessed to her husband the passion she had for another; he assured\nher the Duke de Nemours was the man who had inspired so violent a love,\nand begged her assistance in observing him.  Madam de Martigues was\nglad to hear what the Viscount told her, and the curiosity she had\nalways observed in the Queen-Dauphin for what concerned the Duke de\nNemours made her yet more desirous to search into the bottom of the\naffair.\n\nA few days before that which was fixed for the ceremony of the\nmarriage, the Queen-Dauphin entertained at supper the King her\nfather-in-law, and the Duchess of Valentinois.  Madam de Cleves, who\nhad been busy in dressing herself, went to the Louvre later than\nordinary; as she was going, she met a gentleman that was coming from\nthe Queen-Dauphin to fetch her; as soon as she entered the room, that\nPrincess, who was sitting upon her bed, told her aloud, that she had\nexpected her with great impatience. \"I believe, Madam,\" answered she,\n\"that I am not obliged to you for it, and that your impatience was\ncaused by something else, and not your desire to see me.\"  \"You are in\nthe right,\" answered the Queen-Dauphin, \"but, nevertheless, you are\nobliged to me; for I'll tell you an adventure, which I am sure you'll\nbe glad to know.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves kneeled at her bedside, and, very luckily for her, with\nher face from the light:  \"You know,\" said the Queen, \"how desirous we\nhave been to find out what had caused so great a change in the Duke de\nNemours; I believe I know it, and it is what will surprise you; he is\ndesperately in love with, and as much beloved by, one of the finest\nladies of the Court.\"  It is easy to imagine the grief Madam de Cleves\nfelt upon hearing these words, which she could not apply to herself,\nsince she thought nobody knew anything of her passion for the Duke; \"I\nsee nothing extraordinary in that,\" replied she, \"considering how young\nand handsome a man the Duke de Nemours is.\"  \"No,\" replied the\nQueen-Dauphin, \"there is nothing extraordinary in it; but what will\nsurprise you is, that this lady, who is in love with the Duke de\nNemours, has never given him any mark of it, and that the fear she was\nin lest she should not always be mistress of her passion, has made her\nconfess it to her husband, that he may take her away from Court; and it\nis the Duke de Nemours himself who has related what I tell you.\"\n\nIf Madam de Cleves was grieved at first through the thought that she\nhad no concern in this adventure, the Queen-Dauphin's last words threw\nher into an agony, by making it certain she had too much in it; she\ncould not answer, but continued leaning her head on the bed; meanwhile\nthe Queen went on, and was so intent on what she was saying, that she\ntook no notice of her embarrassment.  When Madam de Cleves was a little\ncome to herself, \"This story, Madam,\" says she, \"does not seem very\nprobable to me, and I should be glad to know who told it you.\" \"It was\nMadam de Martigues,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin, \"and she heard it from\nthe Viscount de Chartres; you know the Viscount is in love with her; he\nentrusted this matter to her as a secret, and he was told it by the\nDuke de Nemours himself; it is true the Duke did not tell the lady's\nname, nor acknowledge that he was the person she was in love with, but\nthe Viscount makes no manner of question of it.\"  When the\nQueen-Dauphin had done speaking, somebody came up to the bed; Madam de\nCleves was so placed that she could not see who it was, but she was\npresently convinced, when the Queen-Dauphin cried out with an air of\ngaiety and surprise, \"Here he is himself, I'll ask him what there is in\nit.\"  Madam de Cleves knew very well it was the Duke de Nemours,\nwithout turning herself, as it really was; upon which she went up\nhastily to the Queen-Dauphin, and told her softly, that she ought to be\ncautious of speaking to him of this adventure, which he had entrusted\nto the Viscount de Chartres as a secret, and that it was a thing which\nmight create a quarrel between them.  \"You are too wise,\" said the\nQueen-Dauphin smiling, and turned to the Duke de Nemours.  He was\ndressed for the evening assembly, and taking up the discourse with that\ngrace which was natural to him, \"I believe, Madam,\" says he, \"I may\nventure to think you were speaking of me as I came in, that you had a\ndesign to ask me something, and that Madam de Cleves is against it.\"\n\"It is true,\" replied the Queen-Dauphin, \"but I shall not be so\ncomplaisant to her on this occasion as I was used to be; I would know\nof you, whether a story I have been told is true, and whether you are\nnot the person who is in love with, and beloved by a lady of the Court,\nwho endeavours to conceal her passion from you, and has confessed it to\nher husband.\"\n\nThe concern and confusion Madam de Cleves was in was above all that can\nbe imagined, and if death itself could have drawn her out of this\ncondition, she would have gladly embraced it; but the Duke de Nemours\nwas yet more embarrassed if possible: the discourse of the\nQueen-Dauphin, by whom he had reason to believe he was not hated, in\nthe presence of Madam de Cleves, who was confided in by her more than\nanybody of the Court, and who confided more in her, threw him into such\nconfusion and extravagance of thought, that it was impossible for him\nto be master of his countenance: the concern he saw Madam de Cleves in\nthrough his fault, and the thought of having given her just cause to\nhate him, so shocked him he could not speak a word.  The Queen-Dauphin,\nseeing how thunderstruck she was, \"Look upon him, look upon him,\" said\nshe to Madam de Cleves, \"and judge if this adventure be not his own.\"\n\nIn the meantime the Duke de Nemours, finding of what importance it was\nto him to extricate himself out of so dangerous a difficulty, recovered\nhimself from his first surprise, and became at once master of his wit\nand looks.  \"I acknowledge, Madam,\" said he, \"it is impossible to be\nmore surprised and concerned than I was at the treachery of the\nViscount de Chartres, in relating an adventure of a friend of mine,\nwhich I had in confidence imparted to him.  I know how to be revenged\nof him,\" continued he, smiling with a calm air, which removed the\nsuspicions the Queen-Dauphin had entertained of him:  \"He has entrusted\nme with things of no very small importance; but I don't know, Madam,\nwhy you do me the honour to make me a party in this affair.  The\nViscount can't say I am concerned in it, for I told him the contrary; I\nmay very well be taken to be a man in love, but I cannot believe,\nMadam, you will think me of the number of those who are loved again.\"\nThe Duke was glad to say anything to the Queen-Dauphin, which alluded\nto the inclination he had expressed for her formerly, in order to\ndivert her thoughts from the subject in question.  She imagined she\nunderstood well enough the drift of what he said, but without making\nany answer to it, she continued to rally him upon the embarrassment he\nwas in.  \"I was concerned, Madam,\" said he, \"for the interest of my\nfriend, and on account of the just reproaches he might make me for\nhaving told a secret which is dearer to him than life.  He has\nnevertheless entrusted me but with one half of it, and has not told me\nthe name of the person he loves; all I know is, that he's the most\ndeeply in love of any man in the world, and has the most reason to\ncomplain.\"  \"Do you think he has reason to complain,\" replied the\nQueen-Dauphin, \"when he is loved again?\"  \"Do you believe he is,\nMadam,\" replied he, \"and that a person who had a real passion could\ndiscover it to her husband? That lady, doubtless, is not acquainted\nwith love, and has mistaken for it a slight acknowledgment of the\nfondness her lover had for her.  My friend can't flatter himself with\nthe lent hopes; but, unfortunate as he is, he thinks himself happy at\nleast in having made her afraid of falling in love with him, and he\nwould not change his condition for that of the happiest lover in the\nworld.\"  \"Your friend has a passion very easy to be satisfied,\" said\nthe Queen-Dauphin, \"and I begin to believe it is not yourself you are\nspeaking of; I am almost,\" continued she, \"of the opinion of Madam de\nCleves, who maintains that this story cannot be true.\"  \"I don't really\nbelieve it can be true,\" answered Madam de Cleves, who had been silent\nhitherto; \"and though it were possible to be true, how should it have\nbeen known?  It is very unlikely that a woman, capable of so\nextraordinary a resolution, would have the weakness to publish it; and\nsurely her husband would not have told it neither, or he must be a\nhusband very unworthy to have been dealt with in so generous a manner.\"\nThe Duke de Nemours, who perceived the suspicions Madam de Cleves had\nof her husband, was glad to confirm her in them, knowing he was the\nmost formidable rival he had to overcome.  \"Jealousy,\" said he, \"and a\ncuriosity perhaps of knowing more than a wife has thought fit to\ndiscover, may make a husband do a great many imprudent things.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves was put to the last proof of her power and courage, and\nnot being able to endure the conversation any longer, she was going to\nsay she was not well, when by good fortune for her the Duchess of\nValentinois came in, and told the Queen-Dauphin that the King was just\ncoming; the Queen-Dauphin went into the closet to dress herself, and\nthe Duke de Nemours came up to Madam de Cleves as she was following\nher.  \"I would give my life, Madam,\" said he, \"to have a moment's\nconversation with you; but though I have a world of important things to\nsay to you, I think nothing is more so, than to entreat you to believe,\nthat if I have said anything in which the Queen-Dauphin may seem\nconcerned, I did it for reasons which do not relate to her.\" Madam de\nCleves pretended not to hear him, and left him without giving him a\nlook, and went towards the King, who was just come in.  As there were\nabundance of people there, she trod upon her gown, and made a false\nstep, which served her as an excuse to go out of a place she had not\nthe power to stay in, and so pretending to have received some hurt she\nwent home.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves came to the Louvre, and was surprised not to find\nhis wife there; they told him of the accident that had befallen her,\nand he went immediately home to enquire after her; he found her in bed,\nand perceived her hurt was not considerable. When he had been some time\nwith her, he found her so excessive melancholy that he was surprised at\nit; \"What ails you, Madam?\" says he; \"you seem to have some other grief\nthan that which you complain of.\"  \"I feel the most sensible grief I\ncan ever experience,\" answered she; \"what use have you made of that\nextraordinary, or rather foolish confidence which I placed in you?  Did\nnot I deserve to have my secret kept? and though I had not deserved it,\ndid not your own interest engage you to it? Should your curiosity to\nknow a name it was not reasonable for me to tell you have obliged you\nto make a confidant to assist you in the discovery?  Nothing but that\ncuriosity could have made you guilty of so cruel an indiscretion; the\nconsequences of it are as bad as they possibly can be.  This adventure\nis known, and I have been told it by those who are not aware that I am\nprincipally concerned in it.\"  \"What do you say, Madam?\" answered he;\n\"you accuse me of having told what passed between you and me, and you\ninform me that the thing is known; I don't go about to clear myself\nfrom this charge, you can't think me guilty of it; without doubt you\nhave applied to yourself what was told you of some other.\"  \"Ah! Sir,\"\nreplied she, \"the world has not an adventure like mine, there is not\nanother woman capable of such a thing.  The story I have heard could\nnot have been invented by chance; nobody could imagine any like it; an\naction of this nature never entered any thoughts but mine.  The\nQueen-Dauphin has just told me the story; she had it from the Viscount\nde Chartres, and the Viscount from the Duke de Nemours.\"  \"The Duke de\nNemours!\" cried Monsieur de Cleves, like a man transported and\ndesperate:  \"How! does the Duke de Nemours know that you are in love\nwith him, and that I am acquainted with it?\"  \"You are always for\nsingling out the Duke de Nemours rather than any other,\" replied she;\n\"I have told you I will never answer you concerning your suspicions: I\nam ignorant whether the Duke de Nemours knows the part I have in this\nadventure, and that which you have ascribed to him; but he told it to\nthe Viscount de Chartres, and said he had it from one of his friends,\nwho did not name the lady: this friend of the Duke de Nemours must\nneeds be one of yours, whom you entrusted the secret to, in order to\nclear up your suspicions.\"  \"Can one have a friend in the world, in\nwhom one would repose such a confidence,\" replied Monsieur de Cleves,\n\"and would a man clear his suspicions at the price of informing another\nwith what one would wish to conceal from oneself?  Think rather, Madam,\nto whom you have spoken; it is more probable this secret should have\nescaped from you than from me; you was not able alone to support the\ntrouble you found yourself in, and you endeavoured to comfort yourself\nby complaining to some confidant who has betrayed you.\"\n\n\"Do not wholly destroy me,\" cried she, \"and be not so hard-hearted as\nto accuse me of a fault you have committed yourself: can you suspect me\nof it? and do you think, because I was capable of informing you of this\nmatter, I was therefore capable of informing another?\"\n\nThe confession which Madam de Cleves had made to her husband was so\ngreat a mark of her sincerity, and she so strongly denied that she had\nentrusted it to any other, that Monsieur de Cleves did not know what to\nthink.  On the other hand he was sure he had never said anything of it;\nit was a thing that could not have been guessed, and yet it was known;\nit must therefore come from one of them two; but what grieved him most\nwas to know that this secret was in the hands of somebody else, and\nthat in all probability it would be soon divulged.\n\nMadam de Cleves thought much after the same manner; she found it\nequally impossible that her husband should, or should not have spoken\nof it.  What the Duke de Nemours had said to her, that curiosity might\nmake a husband do indiscreet things, seemed so justly applicable to\nMonsieur de Cleves's condition, that she could not think he said it by\nchance, and the probability of this made her conclude that Monsieur de\nCleves had abused the confidence she had placed in him.  They were so\ntaken up, the one and the other, with their respective thoughts, that\nthey continued silent a great while; and when they broke from this\nsilence, they only repeated the same things they had already said very\noften; their hearts and affections grew more and more estranged from\neach other.\n\nIt is easy to imagine how they passed the night; Monsieur de Cleves\ncould no longer sustain the misfortune of seeing a woman whom he adored\nin love with another; he grew quite heartless, and thought he had\nreason to be so in an affair where his honour and reputation were so\ndeeply wounded: he knew not what to think of his wife, and was at a\nloss what conduct he should prescribe to her, or what he should follow\nhimself; he saw nothing on all sides but precipices and rocks; at last,\nafter having been long tossed to and fro in suspense, he considered he\nwas soon to set out for Spain, and resolved to do nothing which might\nincrease the suspicion or knowledge of his unfortunate condition.  He\nwent to his wife, and told her that what they had to do was not to\ndebate between themselves who had discovered the secret; but to make it\nappear that the story which was got abroad was a business in which she\nhad no concern; that it depended upon her to convince the Duke de\nNemours and others of it; that she had nothing to do but to behave\nherself to him with that coldness and reserve which she ought to have\nfor a man who professed love to her; that by this proceeding she would\neasily remove the opinion he entertained of her being in love with him;\nand therefore she needed not to trouble herself as to what he might\nhitherto have thought, since if for the future she discovered no\nweakness, his former thoughts would vanish of themselves; and that\nespecially she ought to frequent the Louvre and the assemblies as usual.\n\nHaving said this, Monsieur de Cleves left his wife without waiting her\nanswer; she thought what he said very reasonable, and the resentment\nshe had against the Duke de Nemours made her believe she should be able\nto comply with it with a great deal of ease; but it seemed a hard task\nto her to appear at the marriage with that freedom and tranquillity of\nspirit as the occasion required.  Nevertheless as she was to carry the\nQueen-Dauphin's train, and had been distinguished with that honour in\npreference to a great many other Princesses, it was impossible to\nexcuse herself from it without making a great deal of noise and putting\npeople upon enquiring into the reasons of it.  She resolved therefore\nto do her utmost, and employed the rest of the day in preparing herself\nfor it, and in endeavouring to forget the thoughts that gave her so\nmuch uneasiness; and to this purpose she locked herself up in her\ncloset.  Of all her griefs the most violent was that she had reason to\ncomplain of the Duke de Nemours, and could find no excuse to urge in\nhis favour; she could not doubt but he had related this adventure to\nthe Viscount de Chartres; he had owned it himself, nor could she any\nmore doubt from his manner of speaking of it, but that he knew the\nadventure related to her; how could she excuse so great an imprudence?\nand what was become of that extreme discretion which she had so much\nadmired in this Prince?  \"He was discreet,\" said she, \"while he was\nunhappy; but the thought of being happy, though on uncertain grounds,\nhas put an end to his discretion; he could not consider that he was\nbeloved, without desiring to have it known; he said everything he could\nsay; I never acknowledged it was he I was in love with; he suspected\nit, and has declared his suspicions; if he had been sure of it, he\nmight have acted as he has; I was to blame for thinking him a man\ncapable of concealing what flattered his vanity; and yet it is for this\nman, whom I thought so different from other men, that I am become like\nother women, who was so unlike them before.  I have lost the heart and\nesteem of a husband who ought to have been my happiness; I shall soon\nbe looked upon by all the world as a person led away by an idle and\nviolent passion; he for whom I entertain this passion is no longer\nignorant of it; and it was to avoid these misfortunes that I hazarded\nmy quiet, and even my life.\"  These sad reflections were followed by a\ntorrent of tears; but however great her grief was, she plainly\nperceived she should be able to support it, were she but satisfied in\nthe Duke de Nemours.\n\nThe Duke was no less uneasy than she; the indiscretion he had been\nguilty of in telling what he did to the Viscount de Chartres, and the\nmischievous consequences of it, vexed him to the heart; he could not\nrepresent to himself the affliction and sorrow he had seen Madam de\nCleves in without being pierced with anguish; he was inconsolable for\nhaving said things to her about this adventure, which, though gallant\nenough in themselves, seemed on this occasion too gross and impolite,\nsince they gave Madam de Cleves to understand he was not ignorant that\nshe was the woman who had that violent passion, and that he was the\nobject of it.  It was before the utmost of his wishes to have a\nconversation with her, but now he found he ought rather to fear than\ndesire it.  \"What should I say to her!\" says he; \"should I go to\ndiscover further to her what I have made her too sensible of already!\nShall I tell how I know she loves me; I, who have never dared to say I\nloved her?  Shall I begin with speaking openly of my passion, that she\nmay see my hopes have inspired me with boldness?  Can I even think of\napproaching her, and of giving her the trouble to endure my sight?\nWhich way could I justify myself?  I have no excuse, I am unworthy of\nthe least regard from Madam de Cleves, and I even despair of her ever\nlooking upon me: I have given her by my own fault better means of\ndefending herself against me than any she was searching for, and\nperhaps searching for to no purpose.  I lose by my imprudence the glory\nand happiness of being loved by the most beautiful and deserving lady\nin the world; but if I had lost this happiness, without involving her\nin the most extreme grief and sufferings at the same time, I should\nhave had some comfort; for at this moment I am more sensible of the\nharm I have done her, than of that I have done myself in forfeiting her\nfavour.\"\n\nThe Duke de Nemours continued turning the same thoughts over and over,\nand tormenting himself a great while; the desire he had to speak to\nMadam de Cleves came constantly into his mind; he thought of the means\nto do it; he thought of writing to her; but at last he found,\nconsidering the fault he had committed and the temper she was in, his\nbest way was to show her a profound respect by his affliction and his\nsilence, to let her see he durst not present himself before her, and to\nwait for what time, chance, and the inclination she had for him might\nproduce to his advantage.  He resolved also not to reproach the\nViscount de Chartres for his unfaithfulness, for fear of confirming his\nsuspicions.\n\nThe preparations for the espousals and marriage of Madame on the next\nday so entirely took up the thoughts of the Court, that Madam de Cleves\nand the Duke de Nemours easily concealed from the public their grief\nand uneasiness.  The Queen-Dauphin spoke but slightly to Madam de\nCleves of the conversation they had had with the Duke de Nemours; and\nMonsieur de Cleves industriously shunned speaking to his wife of what\nwas past; so that she did not find herself under so much embarrassment\nas she had imagined.\n\nThe espousals were solemnised at the Louvre; and after the feast and\nball all the Royal family went to lie at the Bishop's Palace, according\nto custom.  In the morning, the Duke of Alva, who always had appeared\nvery plainly dressed, put on a habit of cloth of gold, mixed with\nflame-colour, yellow and black, all covered over with jewels, and wore\na close crown on his head.  The Prince of Orange very richly dressed\nalso, with his liveries, and all the Spaniards with theirs, came to\nattend the Duke of Alva from the Hotel de Villeroy where he lodged, and\nset out, marching four by four, till they came to the Bishop's Palace.\nAs soon as he was arrived, they went in order to the Church; the King\nled Madame, who wore also a close crown, her train being borne by\nMademoiselles de Montpensier and Longueville; the Queen came next, but\nwithout a crown; after her followed the Queen-Dauphin, Madame the\nKing's sister, the Duchess of Loraine, and the Queen of Navarre, their\ntrains being home by the Princesses; the Queens and the Princesses were\nall of them attended with their maids of honour, who were richly\ndressed in the same colour which they wore themselves; so that it was\nknown by the colour of their habits whose maids they were: they mounted\nthe place that was prepared in the Church, and there the marriage\nceremonies were performed; they returned afterwards to dine at the\nBishop's Palace, and went from thence about five o'clock to the Palace\nwhere the feast was, and where the Parliament, the Sovereign Courts,\nand the Corporation of the City were desired to assist. The King, the\nQueens, the Princes and Princesses sat at the marble table in the great\nhall of the Palace; the Duke of Alva sat near the new Queen of Spain,\nbelow the steps of the marble table, and at the King's right hand was a\ntable for the ambassadors, the archbishops, and the Knights of the\nOrder, and on the other side one for the Parliament.\n\nThe Duke of Guise, dressed in a robe of cloth of gold frieze, served\nthe King as Great Chamberlain; the Prince of Conde as Steward of the\nHousehold, and the Duke de Nemours as Cup-bearer. After the tables were\nremoved the ball began, and was interrupted by interludes and a great\ndeal of extraordinary machinery; then the ball was resumed, and after\nmidnight the King and the whole Court returned to the Louvre.  However\nfull of grief Madam de Cleves was, she appeared in the eyes of all\nbeholders, and particularly in those of the Duke de Nemours,\nincomparably beautiful.  He durst not speak to her, though the hurry of\nthe ceremony gave him frequent opportunities; but he expressed so much\nsorrow and so respectful a fear of approaching her, that she no longer\nthought him to blame, though he had said nothing in his justification;\nhis conduct was the same the following days, and wrought the same\neffect on the heart of Madam de Cleves.\n\nAt last the day of the tournament came; the Queens were placed in the\ngalleries that were prepared for them; the four champions appeared at\nthe end of the lists with a number of horses and liveries, the most\nmagnificent sight that ever was seen in France.\n\nThe King's colours were white and black, which he always wore in honour\nof the Duchess of Valentinois, who was a widow.  The Duke of Ferrara\nand his retinue had yellow and red.  Monsieur de Guise's carnation and\nwhite.  It was not known at first for what reason he wore those\ncolours, but it was soon remembered that they were the colours of a\nbeautiful young lady whom he had been in love with, while she was a\nmaid, and whom he yet loved though he durst not show it.  The Duke de\nNemours had yellow and black; why he had them could not be found out:\nMadam de Cleves only knew the reason of it; she remembered to have said\nbefore him she loved yellow, and that she was sorry her complexion did\nnot suit that colour.  As for the Duke, he thought he might take that\ncolour without any indiscretion, since not being worn by Madam de\nCleves it could not be suspected to be hers.\n\nThe four champions showed the greatest address that can be imagined;\nthough the King was the best horseman in his kingdom, it was hard to\nsay which of them most excelled.  The Duke de Nemours had a grace in\nall his actions which might have inclined to his favour persons less\ninterested than Madam de Cleves.  She no sooner saw him appear at the\nend of the lists, but her heart felt uncommon emotions, and every\ncourse he made she could scarce hide her joy when he had successfully\nfinished his career.\n\nIn the evening, when all was almost over, and the company ready to\nbreak up, so it was for the misfortune of the State, that the King\nwould needs break another lance; he sent orders to the Count de\nMontgomery, who was a very dextrous combatant, to appear in the lists.\nThe Count begged the King to excuse him, and alleged all the reasons\nfor it he could think of; but the King, almost angry, sent him word he\nabsolutely commanded him to do it.  The Queen conjured the King not to\nrun any more, told him he had performed so well that he ought to be\nsatisfied, and desired him to go with her to her apartments; he made\nanswer, it was for her sake that he would run again; and entered the\nbarrier; she sent the Duke of Savoy to him to entreat him a second time\nto return, but to no purpose; he ran; the lances were broke, and a\nsplinter of the Count de Montgomery's lance hit the King's eye, and\nstuck there.  The King fell; his gentlemen and Monsieur de Montmorency,\nwho was one of the Mareschals of the field, ran to him; they were\nastonished to see him wounded, but the King was not at all\ndisheartened; he said, that it was but a slight hurt, and that he\nforgave the Count de Montgomery.  One may imagine what sorrow and\naffliction so fatal an accident occasioned on a day set apart to mirth\nand joy.  The King was carried to bed, and the surgeons having examined\nhis wound found it very considerable.  The Constable immediately called\nto mind the prediction which had been told the King, that he should be\nkilled in single fight; and he made no doubt but the prediction would\nbe now accomplished. The King of Spain, who was then at Brussels, being\nadvertised of this accident, sent his physician, who was a man of great\nreputation, but that physician judged the King past hope.\n\nA Court so divided, and filled with so many opposite interests, could\nnot but be in great agitation on the breaking out of so grand an event;\nnevertheless all things were kept quiet, and nothing was seen but a\ngeneral anxiety for the King's health. The Queens, the Princes and\nPrincesses hardly ever went out of his anti-chamber.\n\nMadam de Cleves, knowing that she was obliged to be there, that she\nshould see there the Duke de Nemours, and that she could not conceal\nfrom her husband the disorder she should be in upon seeing him, and\nbeing sensible also that the mere presence of that Prince would justify\nhim in her eyes and destroy all her resolutions, thought proper to\nfeign herself ill.  The Court was too busy to give attention to her\nconduct, or to enquire whether her illness was real or counterfeit; her\nhusband alone was able to come at the truth of the matter, but she was\nnot at all averse to his knowing it.  Thus she continued at home,\naltogether heedless of the great change that was soon expected, and\nfull of her own thoughts, which she was at full liberty to give herself\nup to.  Everyone went to Court to enquire after the King's health, and\nMonsieur de Cleves came home at certain times to give her an account of\nit; he behaved himself to her in the same manner he used to do, except\nwhen they were alone, and then there appeared something of coldness and\nreserve: he had not spoke to her again concerning what had passed, nor\nhad she power, nor did she think it convenient to resume the discourse\nof it.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours, who had waited for an opportunity of speaking to\nMadam de Cleves, was surprised and afflicted not to have had so much as\nthe pleasure to see her.  The King's illness increased so much, that\nthe seventh day he was given over by the physicians; he received the\nnews of the certainty of his death with an uncommon firmness of mind;\nwhich was the more to be admired, considering that he lost his life by\nso unfortunate an accident, that he died in the flower of his age,\nhappy, adored by his people, and beloved by a mistress he was\ndesperately in love with.  The evening before his death he caused\nMadame his sister to be married to the Duke of Savoy without ceremony.\nOne may judge what condition the Duchess of Valentinois was in; the\nQueen would not permit her to see the King, but sent to demand of her\nthe King's signets, and the jewels of the crown which she had in her\ncustody.  The Duchess enquired if the King was dead, and being\nanswered, \"No\"; \"I have then as yet no other matter,\" said she, \"and\nnobody can oblige me to restore what he has trusted in my hands.\"  As\nsoon as the King expired at Chateau de Toumelles, the Duke of Ferrara,\nthe Duke of Guise, and the Duke de Nemours conducted the Queen-Mother,\nthe New King and the Queen-Consort to the Louvre.  The Duke de Nemours\nled the Queen-Mother.  As they began to march, she stepped back a\nlittle, and told the Queen her daughter-in-law, it was her place to go\nfirst; but it was easy to see, that there was more of spleen than\ndecorum in this compliment.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe Queen-mother was now wholly governed by the Cardinal of Loraine;\nthe Viscount de Chartres had no interest with her, and the passion he\nhad for Madam de Martigues and for liberty hindered him from feeling\nthis loss as it deserved to be felt. The Cardinal, during the ten days'\nillness of the King, was at leisure to form his designs, and lead the\nQueen into resolutions agreeable to what he had projected; so that the\nKing was no sooner dead but the Queen ordered the Constable to stay at\nTournelles with the corpse of the deceased King in order to perform the\nusual ceremonies.  This commission kept him at a distance and out of\nthe scene of action; for this reason the Constable dispatched a courier\nto the King of Navarre, to hasten him to Court that they might join\ntheir interest to oppose the great rise of the House of Guise.  The\ncommand of the Army was given to the Duke of Guise and the care of the\nfinances to the Cardinal of Loraine.  The Duchess of Valentinois was\ndriven from Court; the Cardinal de Tournon, the Constable's declared\nenemy, and the Chancellor Olivier, the declared enemy of the Duchess of\nValentinois, were both recalled.  In a word, the complexion of the\nCourt was entirely changed; the Duke of Guise took the same rank as the\nPrinces of the blood, in carrying the King's mantle at the funeral\nceremonies: He and his brothers carried all before them at Court, not\nonly by reason of the Cardinal's power with the Queen-Mother, but\nbecause she thought it in her power to remove them should they give her\numbrage; whereas she could not so easily remove the Constable, who was\nsupported by the Princes of the blood.\n\nWhen the ceremonial of the mourning was over, the Constable came to the\nLouvre, and was very coldly received by the King; he desired to speak\nwith him in private, but the King called for Messieurs de Guise, and\ntold him before them, that he advised him to live at ease; that the\nfinances and the command of the Army were disposed of, and that when he\nhad occasion for his advice, he would send for him to Court.  The Queen\nreceived him in a yet colder manner than the King, and she even\nreproached him for having told the late King, that his children by her\ndid not resemble him.  The King of Navarre arrived, and was no better\nreceived; the Prince of Conde, more impatient than his brother,\ncomplained aloud, but to no purpose: he was removed from Court, under\npretence of being sent to Flanders to sign the ratification of the\npeace.  They showed the King of Navarre a forged letter from the King\nof Spain, which charged him with a design of seizing that King's\nfortresses; they put him in fear for his dominions, and made him take a\nresolution to go to Bearn; the Queen furnished him with an opportunity,\nby appointing him to conduct Madam Elizabeth, and obliged him to set\nout before her, so that there remained nobody at Court that could\nbalance the power of the House of Guise.\n\nThough it was a mortifying circumstance for Monsieur de Cleves not to\nconduct Madam Elizabeth, yet he could not complain of it, by reason of\nthe greatness of the person preferred before him; he regretted the loss\nof this employment not so much on account of the honour he should have\nreceived from it, as because it would have given him an opportunity of\nremoving his wife from Court without the appearance of design in it.\n\nA few days after the King's death, it was resolved the new King should\ngo to Rheims to be crowned.  As soon as this journey was talked of,\nMadam de Cleves, who had stayed at home all this while under pretence\nof illness, entreated her husband to dispense with her following the\nCourt, and to give her leave to go to take the air at Colomiers for her\nhealth: he answered, that whether her health was the reason or not of\nher desire, however he consented to it: nor was it very difficult for\nhim to consent to a thing he had resolved upon before: as good an\nopinion as he had of his wife's virtue, he thought it imprudent to\nexpose her any longer to the sight of a man she was in love with.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours was soon informed that Madam de Cleves was not to\ngo along with the Court; he could not find in his heart to set out\nwithout seeing her, and therefore the night before his journey he went\nto her house as late as decency would allow him, in order to find her\nalone.  Fortune favoured his intention; and Madam de Nevers and Madam\nde Martigues, whom he met in the Court as they were coming out,\ninformed him they had left her alone. He went up in a concern and\nferment of mind to be paralleled only by that which Madam de Cleves was\nunder, when she was told the Duke de Nemours was come to see her; the\nfear lest he should speak to her of his passion, and lest she should\nanswer him too favourably, the uneasiness this visit might give her\nhusband, the difficulty of giving him an account of it, or of\nconcealing it from him, all these things presented themselves to her\nimagination at once, and threw her into so great an embarrassment, that\nshe resolved to avoid the thing of the world which perhaps she wished\nfor the most.  She sent one of her women to the Duke de Nemours, who\nwas in her anti-chamber, to tell him that she had lately been very ill,\nand that she was sorry she could not receive the honour which he\ndesigned her.  What an affliction was it to the Duke, not to see Madam\nde Cleves, and therefore not to see her, because she had no mind he\nshould!  He was to go away the next morning, and had nothing further to\nhope from fortune.  He had said nothing to her since that conversation\nat the Queen-Dauphin's apartments, and he had reason to believe that\nhis imprudence in telling the Viscount his adventure had destroyed all\nhis expectations; in a word, he went away with everything that could\nexasperate his grief.\n\nNo sooner was Madam de Cleves recovered from the confusion which the\nthought of receiving a visit from the Duke had given her, but all the\nreasons which had made her refuse it vanished; she was even satisfied\nshe had been to blame; and had she dared, or had it not been too late,\nshe would have had him called back.\n\nMadam de Nevers and Madam de Martigues went from the Princess of Cleves\nto the Queen-Dauphin's, where they found Monsieur de Cleves: the\nQueen-Dauphin asked them from whence they came; they said they came\nfrom Madam de Cleves, where they had spent part of the afternoon with a\ngreat deal of company, and that they had left nobody there but the Duke\nde Nemours.  These words, which they thought so indifferent, were not\nsuch with Monsieur de Cleves: though he might well imagine the Duke de\nNemours had frequent opportunities of speaking to his wife, yet the\nthought that he was now with her, that he was there alone, and that he\nmight speak to her of his life, appeared to him at this time a thing so\nnew and insupportable, that jealousy kindled in his heart with greater\nviolence than ever.  It was impossible for him to stay at the Queen's;\nhe returned from thence, without knowing why he returned, or if he\ndesigned to go and interrupt the Duke de Nemours: he was no sooner come\nhome, but he looked about him to see if there was anything by which he\ncould judge if the Duke was still there; it was some comfort to him to\nfind he was gone, and it was a pleasure to reflect that he could not\nhave been long there: he fancied, that, perhaps, it was not the Duke de\nNemours of whom he had reason to be jealous; and though he did not\ndoubt of it, yet he endeavoured to doubt of it; but he was convinced of\nit by so many circumstances, that he continued not long in that\npleasing uncertainty.  He immediately went into his wife's room, and\nafter having talked to her for some time about indifferent matters, he\ncould not forbear asking her what she had done, and who she had seen,\nand accordingly she gave him an account: when he found she did not name\nthe Duke de Nemours he asked her trembling, if those were all she had\nseen, in order to give her an occasion to name the Duke, and that he\nmight not have the grief to see she made use of any evasion.  As she\nhad not seen him, she did not name him; when Monsieur de Cleves with\naccents of sorrow, said, \"And have you not seen the Duke de Nemours, or\nhave you forgot him?\"  \"I have not seen him indeed,\" answered she; \"I\nwas ill, and I sent one of my women to make my excuses.\"  \"You was ill\nthen only for him,\" replied Monsieur de Cleves, \"since you admitted the\nvisits of others: why this distinction with respect to the Duke de\nNemours?  Why is not he to you as another man?  Why should you be\nafraid of seeing him? Why do you let him perceive that you are so?  Why\ndo you show him that you make use of the power which his passion gives\nyou over him?  Would you dare refuse to see him, but that you knew he\ndistinguishes your rigour from incivility?  But why should you exercise\nthat rigour towards him?  From a person like you, all things are\nfavours, except indifference.\"  \"I did not think,\" replied Madam de\nCleves, \"whatever suspicions you have of the Duke de Nemours, that you\ncould reproach me for not admitting a visit from him.\"  \"But I do\nreproach you, Madam,\" replied he, \"and I have good ground for so doing;\nwhy should you not see him, if he has said nothing to you? but Madam,\nhe has spoke to you; if his passion had been expressed only by silence,\nit would not have made so great an impression upon you; you have not\nthought fit to tell me the whole truth; you have concealed the greatest\npart from me; you have repented even of the little you have\nacknowledged, and you have not the resolution to go on; I am more\nunhappy than I imagined, more unhappy than any other man in the world:\nyou are my wife, I love you as my mistress, and I see you at the same\ntime in love with another, with the most amiable man of the Court, and\nhe sees you every day, and knows you are in love with him:  Alas!  I\nbelieved that you would conquer your passion for him, but sure I had\nlost my reason when I believed it was possible.\"  \"I don't know,\"\nreplied Madam de Cleves very sorrowfully, \"whether you was to blame in\njudging favourably of so extraordinary a proceeding as mine; nor do I\nknow if I was not mistaken when I thought you would do me justice.\"\n\"Doubt it not, Madam,\" replied Monsieur de Cleves, \"you was mistaken;\nyou expected from me things as impossible as those I expected from you:\nhow could you hope I should continue master of my reason? Had you\nforgot that I was desperately in love with you, and that I was your\nhusband?  Either of these two circumstances is enough to hurry a man\ninto extremities; what may they not do both together?  Alas!  What do\nthey not do?  My thoughts are violent and uncertain, and I am not able\nto control them; I no longer think myself worthy of you, nor do I think\nyou are worthy of me; I adore you, I hate you, I offend you, I ask your\npardon, I admire you, I blush for my admiration: in a word, I have\nnothing of tranquillity or reason left about me: I wonder how I have\nbeen able to live since you spoke to me at Colomiers, and since you\nlearned, from what the Queen-Dauphin told you, that your adventure was\nknown; I can't discover how it came to be known, nor what passed\nbetween the Duke de Nemours and you upon the subject; you will never\nexplain it to me, nor do I desire you to do it; I only desire you to\nremember that you have made me the most unfortunate, the most wretched\nof men.\"\n\nHaving spoke these words, Monsieur de Cleves left his wife, and set out\nthe next day without seeing her; but he wrote her a letter full of\nsorrow, and at the same time very kind and obliging: she gave an answer\nto it so moving and so full of assurances both as to her past and\nfuture conduct, that as those assurances were grounded in truth, and\nwere the real effect of her sentiments, the letter made great\nimpressions on Monsieur de Cleves, and gave him some tranquillity; add\nto this that the Duke de Nemours going to the King as well as himself,\nhe had the satisfaction to know that he would not be in the same place\nwith Madam de Cleves.  Everytime that lady spoke to her husband, the\npassion he expressed for her, the handsomeness of his behaviour, the\nfriendship she had for him, and the thought of what she owed him, made\nimpressions in her heart that weakened the idea of the Duke de Nemours;\nbut it did not continue long, that idea soon returned more lively than\nbefore.\n\nFor a few days after the Duke was gone, she was hardly sensible of his\nabsence; afterwards it tortured her; ever since she had been in love\nwith him, there did not pass a day, but she either feared or wished to\nmeet him, and it was a wounding thought to her to consider that it was\nno more in the power of fortune to contrive their meeting.\n\nShe went to Colomiers, and ordered to be carried thither the large\npictures she had caused to be copied from the originals which the\nDuchess of Valentinois had procured to be drawn for her fine house of\nAnnett.  All the remarkable actions that had passed in the late King's\nreign were represented in these pieces, and among the rest was the\nSiege of Mets, and all those who had distinguished themselves at that\nSiege were painted much to the life.  The Duke de Nemours was of this\nnumber, and it was that perhaps which had made Madam de Cleves desirous\nof having the pictures.\n\nMadam de Martigues not being able to go along with the Court, promised\nher to come and pass some days at Colomiers.  Though they divided the\nQueen's favour, they lived together without envy or coldness; they were\nfriends, but not confidants; Madam de Cleves knew that Madam de\nMartigues was in love with the Viscount, but Madam de Martigues did not\nknow that Madam de Cleves was in love with the Duke de Nemours, nor\nthat she was beloved by him.  The relation Madam de Cleves had to the\nViscount made her more dear to Madam de Martigues, and Madam de Cleves\nwas also fond of her as a person who was in love as well as herself,\nand with an intimate friend of her own lover.\n\nMadam de Martigues came to Colomiers according to her promise, and\nfound Madam de Cleves living in a very solitary manner: that Princess\naffected a perfect solitude, and passed the evenings in her garden\nwithout being accompanied even by her domestics; she frequently came\ninto the pavilion where the Duke de Nemours had overheard her\nconversation with her husband; she delighted to be in the bower that\nwas open to the garden, while her women and attendants waited in the\nother bower under the pavilion, and never came to her but when she\ncalled them.  Madam de Martigues having never seen Colomiers was\nsurprised at the extraordinary beauty of it, and particularly with the\npleasantness of the pavilion.  Madam de Cleves and she usually passed\nthe evenings there.  The liberty of being alone in the night in so\nagreeable a place would not permit the conversation to end soon between\ntwo young ladies, whose hearts were enflamed with violent passions, and\nthey took great pleasure in conversing together, though they were not\nconfidants.\n\nMadam de Martigues would have left Colomiers with great reluctance had\nshe not quitted it to go to a place where the Viscount was; she set out\nfor Chambort, the Court being there.\n\nThe King had been anointed at Rheims by the Cardinal of Loraine, and\nthe design was to pass the rest of the summer at the castle of\nChambort, which was newly built; the Queen expressed a great deal of\njoy upon seeing Madam de Martigues again at Court, and after having\ngiven her several proofs of it, she asked her how Madam de Cleves did,\nand in what manner she passed her time in the country.  The Duke de\nNemours and the Prince of Cleves were with the Queen at that time.\nMadam de Martigues, who had been charmed with Colomiers, related all\nthe beauties of it, and enlarged extremely on the description of the\npavilion in the forest, and on the pleasure Madam de Cleves took in\nwalking there alone part of the night.  The Duke de Nemours, who knew\nthe place well enough to understand what Madam de Martigues said of it,\nthought it was not impossible to see Madam de Cleves there, without\nbeing seen by anybody but her.  He asked Madam de Martigues some\nquestions to get further lights; and the Prince of Cleves, who had eyed\nhim very strictly while Madam de Martigues was speaking, thought he\nknew what his design was.  The questions the Duke asked still more\nconfirmed him in that thought, so that he made no doubt but his\nintention was to go and see his wife; he was not mistaken in his\nsuspicions: this design entered so deeply into the Duke de Nemours's\nmind, that after having spent the night in considering the proper\nmethods to execute it, he went betimes the next morning to ask the\nKing's leave to go to Paris, on some pretended occasion.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves was in no doubt concerning the occasion of his\njourney; and he resolved to inform himself as to his wife's conduct,\nand to continue no longer in so cruel an uncertainty; he had a desire\nto set out the same time as the Duke de Nemours did, and to hide\nhimself where he might discover the success of the journey; but fearing\nhis departure might appear extraordinary, and lest the Duke, being\nadvertised of it, might take other measures, he resolved to trust this\nbusiness to a gentleman of his, whose fidelity and wit he was assured\nof; he related to him the embarrassment he was under, and what the\nvirtue of his wife had been till that time, and ordered him to follow\nthe Duke de Nemours, to watch him narrowly, to see if he did not go to\nColomiers, and if he did not enter the garden in the night.\n\nThe gentleman, who was very capable of this commission, acquitted\nhimself of it with all the exactness imaginable.  He followed the Duke\nto a village within half a league of Colomiers, where the Duke stopped\nand the gentleman easily guessed his meaning was to stay there till\nnight.  He did not think it convenient to wait there, but passed on,\nand placed himself in that part of the forest where he thought the Duke\nwould pass: he took his measures very right; for it was no sooner night\nbut he heard somebody coming that way, and though it was dark, he\neasily knew the Duke de Nemours; he saw him walk round the garden, as\nwith a design to listen if he could hear anybody, and to choose the\nmost convenient place to enter: the palisades were very high and\ndouble, in order to prevent people from coming in, so that it was very\ndifficult for the Duke to get over, however he made a shift to do it.\nHe was no sooner in the garden but he discovered where Madam de Cleves\nwas; he saw a great light in the bower, all the windows of it were\nopen; upon this, slipping along by the side of the palisades, he came\nup close to it, and one may easily judge what were the emotions of his\nheart at that instant: he took his station behind one of the windows,\nwhich served him conveniently to see what Madam de Cleves was doing.\nHe saw she was alone; he saw her so inimitably beautiful, that he could\nscarce govern the transports which that sight gave him: the weather was\nhot, her head and neck were uncovered, and her hair hung carelessly\nabout her.  She lay on a couch with a table before her, on which were\nseveral baskets full of ribbons, out of which she chose some, and he\nobserved she chose those colours which he wore at the tournament; he\nsaw her make them up into knots for an Indian cane, which had been his,\nand which he had given to his sister; Madam de Cleves took it from her,\nwithout seeming to know it had belonged to the Duke.  After she had\nfinished her work with the sweetest grace imaginable, the sentiments of\nher heart showing themselves in her countenance, she took a wax candle\nand came to a great table over against the picture of the Siege of\nMets, in which was the portrait of the Duke de Nemours; she sat down\nand set herself to look upon that portrait, with an attention and\nthoughtfulness which love only can give.\n\nIt is impossible to express what Monsieur de Nemours felt at this\nmoment; to see, at midnight, in the finest place in the world, a lady\nhe adored, to see her without her knowing that he saw her, and to find\nher wholly taken up with things that related to him, and to the passion\nwhich she concealed from him; this is what was never tasted nor\nimagined by any other lover.\n\nThe Duke was so transported and beside himself, that he continued\nmotionless, with his eyes fixed on Madam de Cleves, without thinking\nhow precious his time was; when he was a little recovered, he thought\nit best not to speak to her till she came into the garden, and he\nimagined he might do it there with more safety, because she would be at\na greater distance from her women; but finding she stayed in the bower,\nhe resolved to go in: when he was upon the point of doing it, what was\nhis confusion; how fearful was he of displeasing her, and of changing\nthat countenance, where so much sweetness dwelt, into looks of anger\nand resentment!\n\nTo come to see Madam de Cleves without being seen by her had no\nimpudence in it, but to think of showing himself appeared very unwise;\na thousand things now came into his mind which he had not thought of\nbefore; it carried in it somewhat extremely bold and extravagant, to\nsurprise in the middle of the night a person to whom he had never yet\nspoke of his passion.  He thought he had no reason to expect she would\nhear him, but that she would justly resent the danger to which he\nexposed her, by accidents which might rise from this attempt; all his\ncourage left him, and he was several times upon the point of resolving\nto go back again without showing himself; yet urged by the desire of\nspeaking to her, and heartened by the hopes which everything he had\nseen gave him, he advanced some steps, but in such disorder, that a\nscarf he had on entangled in the window, and made a noise.  Madam de\nCleves turned about, and whether her fancy was full of him, or that she\nstood in a place so directly to the light that she might know him, she\nthought it was he, and without the least hesitation or turning towards\nthe place where he was, she entered the bower where her women were.  On\nher entering she was in such disorder, that to conceal it she was\nforced to say she was ill; she said it too in order to employ her\npeople about her, and to give the Duke time to retire.  When she had\nmade some reflection, she thought she had been deceived, and that her\nfancying she saw Monsieur de Nemours was only the effect of\nimagination.  She knew he was at Chambort; she saw no probability of\nhis engaging in so hazardous an enterprise; she had a desire several\ntimes to re-enter the bower, and to see if there was anybody in the\ngarden.  She wished perhaps as much as she feared to find the Duke de\nNemours there; but at last reason and prudence prevailed over her other\nthoughts, and she found it better to continue in the doubt she was in,\nthan to run the hazard of satisfying herself about it; she was a long\ntime ere she could resolve to leave a place to which she thought the\nDuke was so near, and it was almost daybreak when she returned to the\ncastle.\n\nThe Duke de Nemours stayed in the garden, as long as there was any\nlight; he was not without hopes of seeing Madam de Cleves again, though\nhe was convinced that she knew him, and that she went away only to\navoid him; but when he found the doors were shut, he knew he had\nnothing more to hope; he went to take horse near the place where\nMonsieur de Cleves's gentleman was watching him; this gentleman\nfollowed him to the same village, where he had left him in the evening.\nThe Duke resolved to stay there all the day, in order to return at\nnight to Colomiers, to see if Madam de Cleves would yet have the\ncruelty to shun him or not expose herself to view: though he was very\nmuch pleased to find himself so much in her thoughts, yet was he\nextremely grieved at the same time to see her so naturally bent to\navoid him.\n\nNever was passion so tender and so violent as that of Monsieur de\nNemours; he walked under the willows, along a little brook which ran\nbehind the house, where he lay concealed; he kept himself as much out\nof the way as possible, that he might not be seen by anybody; he\nabandoned himself to the transports of his love, and his heart was so\nfull of tenderness, that he was forced to let fall some tears, but\nthose tears were such as grief alone could not shed; they had a mixture\nof sweetness and pleasure in them which is to be found only in love.\n\nHe set himself to recall to mind all the actions of Madam de Cleves\never since he had been in love with her; her cruelty and rigour, and\nthat modesty and decency of behaviour she had always observed towards\nhim, though she loved him; \"For, after all, she loves me,\" said he,\n\"she loves me, I cannot doubt of it, the deepest engagements and the\ngreatest favours are not more certain proofs than those I have had.  In\nthe meantime, I am treated with the same rigour as if I were hated; I\nhoped something from time, but I have no reason to expect it any\nlonger; I see her always equally on her guard against me and against\nherself; if I were not loved, I should make it my business to please;\nbut I do please; she loves me, and tries to hide it from me.  What have\nI then to hope, and what change am I to expect in my fortune? though I\nam loved by the most amiable person in the world, I am under that\nexcess of passion which proceeds from the first certainty of being\nloved by her, only to make me more sensible of being ill used; let me\nsee that you love me, fair Princess,\" cried he, \"make me acquainted\nwith your sentiments; provided I know them once in my life from you, I\nam content that you resume for ever the cruelties with which you\noppress me; look upon me at least with the same eyes with which I saw\nyou look that night upon my picture; could you behold that with such\nsweet complacency, and yet avoid me with so much cruelty?  What are you\nafraid of?  Why does my love appear so terrible to you?  You love me,\nand you endeavour in vain to conceal it; you have even given me\ninvoluntary proofs of it; I know my happiness, permit me to enjoy it,\nand cease to make me unhappy.  Is it possible I should be loved by the\nPrincess of Cleves, and yet be unhappy? how beautiful was she last\nnight? how could I forbear throwing myself at her feet?  If I had done\nit, I might perhaps have hindered her from shunning me, my respectful\nbehaviour would have removed her fears; but perhaps, after all, she did\nnot know it was I; I afflict myself more than I need; she was only\nfrightened to see a man at so unseasonable an hour.\"\n\nThese thoughts employed the Duke de Nemours all the day; he wished\nimpatiently for the night, and as soon as it came he returned to\nColomiers.  Monsieur de Cleves's gentleman, who was disguised that he\nmight be less observed, followed him to the place to which he had\nfollowed him the evening before, and saw him enter the garden again.\nThe Duke soon perceived that Madam de Cleves had not run the risk of\nhis making another effort to see her, the doors being all shut; he\nlooked about on all sides to see if he could discover any light, but he\nsaw none.\n\nMadam de Cleves, suspecting he might return, continued in her chamber;\nshe had reason to apprehend she should not always have the power to\navoid him, and she would not submit herself to the hazard of speaking\nto him in a manner that would have been unsuitable to the conduct she\nhad hitherto observed.\n\nMonsieur de Nemours, though he had no hopes of seeing her, could not\nfind in his heart soon to leave a place where she so often was; he\npassed the whole night in the garden, and found some pleasure at least\nin seeing the same objects which she saw every day; it was near sunrise\nbefore he thought of retiring; but as last the fear of being discovered\nobliged him to go away.\n\nIt was impossible for him to return to Court without seeing Madam de\nCleves; he made a visit to his sister the Duchess of Mercoeur, at her\nhouse near Colomiers.  She was extremely surprised at her brother's\narrival; but he invented so probable a pretence for his journey, and\nconducted his plot so skilfully, that he drew her to make the first\nproposal herself of visiting Madam de Cleves. This proposal was\nexecuted that very day, and Monsieur de Nemours told his sister, that\nhe would leave her at Colomiers, in order to go directly to the King;\nhe formed this pretence of leaving her at Colomiers in hopes she would\ntake her leave before him, and he thought he had found out by that\nmeans an infallible way of speaking to Madam de Cleves.\n\nThe Princess of Cleves, when they arrived, was walking in her garden\nthe sight of Monsieur de Nemours gave her no small uneasiness, and put\nher out of doubt that it was he she had seen the foregoing night.  The\ncertainty of his having done so bold and imprudent a thing gave her\nsome little resentment against him, and the Duke observed an air of\ncoldness in her face, which sensibly grieved him; the conversation\nturned upon indifferent matters, and yet he had the skill all the while\nto show so much wit, complaisance, and admiration for Madam de Cleves,\nthat part of the coldness she expressed towards him at first left her\nin spite of herself.\n\nWhen his fears were over and he began to take heart, he showed an\nextreme curiosity to see the pavilion in the forest; he spoke of it as\nof the most agreeable place in the world, and gave so exact a\ndescription of it, that Madam de Mercoeur said he must needs have been\nthere several times to know all the particular beauties of it so well.\n\"And yet, I don't believe,\" replied Madam de Cleves, \"that the Duke de\nNemours was ever there; it has been finished but a little while.\"  \"It\nis not long since I was there,\" replied the Duke, looking upon her,\n\"and I don't know if I ought not to be glad you have forgot you saw me\nthere.\" Madam de Mercoeur, being taken up in observing the beauties of\nthe gardens, did not attend to what her brother said; Madam de Cleves\nblushed, and with her eyes cast down, without looking on Monsieur de\nNemours, \"I don't remember,\" said she, \"to have seen you there; and if\nyou have been there, it was without my knowledge.\"  \"It is true,\nMadam,\" replied he, \"I was there without your orders, and I passed\nthere the most sweet and cruel moments of my life.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves understood very well what he said, but made him no\nanswer; her care was to prevent Madam de Mercoeur from going into the\nbower, because the Duke de Nemours's picture was there, and she had no\nmind she should see it; she managed the matter so well, that the time\npassed away insensibly, and Madam de Mercoeur began to talk of going\nhome: but when Madam de Cleves found that the Duke and his sister did\nnot go together, she plainly saw to what she was going to be exposed;\nshe found herself under the same embarrassment she was in at Paris, and\ntook also the same resolution; her fear, lest this visit should be a\nfurther confirmation of her husband's suspicions, did not a little\ncontribute to determine her; and to the end Monsieur de Nemours might\nnot remain alone with her, she told Madam de Mercoeur she would wait\nupon her to the borders of the forest, and ordered her chariot to be\ngot ready.  The Duke was struck with such a violent grief to find that\nMadam de Cleves still continued to exercise the same rigours towards\nhim, that he turned pale that moment. Madam de Mercoeur asked him if he\nwas ill, but he looked upon Madam de Cleves without being perceived by\nanybody else, and made her sensible by his looks that he had no other\nillness besides despair: however, there was no remedy but he must let\nthem go together without daring to follow them; after what he had told\nhis sister, that he was to go directly to Court, he could not return\nwith her, but went to Paris, and set out from thence the next day.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves's gentleman had observed him all the while; he\nreturned also to Paris, and when he found Monsieur de Nemours was set\nout for Chambort, he took post to get thither before him, and to give\nan account of his journey; his master expected his return with\nimpatience, as if the happiness or unhappiness of his life depended\nupon it.\n\nAs soon as he saw him, he judged from his countenance and his silence,\nthat the news he brought was very disagreeable; he was struck with\nsorrow, and continued some time with his head hung down, without being\nable to speak; at last he made signs with his hand to him to withdraw;\n\"Go,\" says he, \"I see what you have to say to me, but I have not the\npower to hear it.\"  \"I can acquaint you with nothing,\" said the\ngentleman, \"upon which one can form any certain judgment; it is true,\nthe Duke de Nemours went two nights successively into the garden in the\nforest, and the day after he was at Colomiers with the Duchess of\nMercoeur.\" \"'Tis enough,\" replied Monsieur de Cleves, still making\nsigns to him to withdraw, \"'tis enough; I want no further information.\"\nThe gentleman was forced to leave his master, abandoned to his despair;\nnor ever was despair more violent.  Few men of so high a spirit, and so\npassionately in love, as the Prince of Cleves, have experienced at the\nsame time the grief arising from the falsehood of a mistress, and the\nshame of being deceived by a wife.\n\nMonsieur de Cleves could set no bounds to his affliction; he felt ill\nof a fever that very night, and his distemper was accompanied with such\nill symptoms that it was thought very dangerous.  Madam de Cleves was\ninformed of it, and came in all haste to him; when she arrived, he was\nstill worse; besides, she observed something in him so cold and\nchilling with respect to her, that she was equally surprised and\ngrieved at it; he even seemed to receive with pain the services she did\nhim in his sickness, but at last she imagined it was perhaps only the\neffect of his distemper.\n\nWhen she was come to Blois where the Court then was, the Duke de\nNemours was overjoyed to think she was at the same place where he was;\nhe endeavoured to see her, and went every day to the Prince of Cleves's\nunder pretence of enquiring how he did, but it was to no purpose; she\ndid not stir out of her husband's room, and was grieved at heart for\nthe condition he was in.  It vexed Monsieur de Nemours to see her under\nsuch affliction, an affliction which he plainly saw revived the\nfriendship she had for Monsieur de Cleves, and diverted the passion\nthat lay kindling in her heart. The thought of this shocked him\nseverely for some time; but the extremity, to which Monsieur de\nCleves's sickness was grown, opened to him a scene of new hopes; he saw\nit was probable that Madam de Cleves would be at liberty to follow her\nown inclinations, and that he might expect for the future a series of\nhappiness and lasting pleasures; he could not support the ecstasy of\nthat thought, a thought so full of transport! he banished it out of his\nmind for fear of becoming doubly wretched, if he happened to be\ndisappointed in his hopes.\n\nIn the meantime Monsieur de Cleves was almost given over by his\nphysicians.  One of the last days of his illness, after having had a\nvery bad night, he said in the morning, he had a desire to sleep; but\nMadam de Cleves, who remained alone in his chamber, found that instead\nof taking repose he was extremely restless; she came to him, and fell\non her knees by his bedside, her face all covered with tears; and\nthough Monsieur de Cleves had taken a resolution not to show her the\nviolent displeasure he had conceived against her, yet the care she took\nof him, and the sorrow she expressed, which sometimes he thought\nsincere, and at other times the effect of her dissimulation and\nperfidiousness, distracted him so violently with opposite sentiments\nfull of woe, that he could not forbear giving them vent.\n\n\"You shed plenty of tears, Madam,\" said he, \"for a death which you are\nthe cause of, and which cannot give you the trouble you pretend to be\nin; I am no longer in a condition to reproach you,\" added he with a\nvoice weakened by sickness and grief; \"I die through the dreadful grief\nand discontent you have given me; ought so extraordinary an action, as\nthat of your speaking to me at Colomiers, to have had so little\nconsequences?  Why did you inform me of your passion for the Duke de\nNemours, if your virtue was no longer able to oppose it?  I loved you\nto that extremity, I would have been glad to have been deceived, I\nconfess it to my shame; I have regretted that pleasing false security\nout of which you drew me; why did not you leave me in that blind\ntranquillity which so many husbands enjoy?  I should perhaps have been\nignorant all my life, that you was in love with Monsieur de Nemours; I\nshall die,\" added he, \"but know that you make death pleasing to me, and\nthat, after you have taken from me the esteem and affection I had for\nyou, life would be odious to me.  What should I live for? to spend my\ndays with a person whom I have loved so much, and by whom I have been\nso cruelly deceived; or to live apart from her and break out openly\ninto violences so opposite to my temper, and the love I had for you?\nThat love, Madam, was far greater than it appeared to you; I concealed\nthe greatest part of it from you, for fear of being importunate, or of\nlosing somewhat in your esteem by a behaviour not becoming a husband:\nin a word, I deserved your affection more than once, and I die without\nregret, since I have not been able to obtain it, and since I can no\nlonger desire it.  Adieu, Madam; you will one day regret a man who\nloved you with a sincere and virtuous passion; you will feel the\nanxiety which reasonable persons meet with in intrigue and gallantry,\nand you will know the difference between such a love as I had for you,\nand the love of people who only profess admiration for you to gratify\ntheir vanity in seducing you; but my death will leave you at liberty,\nand you may make the Duke de Nemours happy without guilt: what\nsignifies anything that can happen when I am no more, and why should I\nhave the weakness to trouble myself about it?\"\n\nMadam de Cleves was so far from imagining that her husband suspected\nher virtue, that she heard all this discourse without comprehending the\nmeaning of it, and without having any other notion about it, except\nthat he reproached her for her inclination for the Duke de Nemours; at\nlast, starting all of a sudden out of her blindness, \"I guilty!\" cried\nshe, \"I am a stranger to the very thought of guilt; the severest virtue\ncould not have inspired any other conduct than that which I have\nfollowed, and I never acted anything but what I could have wished you\nto have been witness to.\"  \"Could you have wished,\" replied Monsieur de\nCleves, looking on her with disdain, \"I had been a witness of those\nnights you passed with Monsieur de Nemours?  Ah! Madam; is it you I\nspeak of, when I speak of a lady that has passed nights with a man, not\nher husband?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied she, \"it is not me you speak of; I\nnever spent a night nor a moment with the Duke de Nemours; he never saw\nme in private, I never suffered him to do it, nor would give him a\nhearing.  I'll take all the oaths . . .\"  \"Speak no more of it,\" said\nhe interrupting her, \"false oaths or a confession would perhaps give me\nequal pain.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves could not answer him; her tears and her grief took away\nher speech; at last, struggling for utterance, \"Look on me at least,\nhear me,\" said she; \"if my interest only were concerned I would suffer\nthese reproaches, but your life is at stake; hear me for your own sake;\nI am so innocent, truth pleads so strongly for me, it is impossible but\nI must convince you.\" \"Would to God you could!\" cried he; \"but what can\nyou say? the Duke de Nemours, has not he been at Colomiers with his\nsister? And did not he pass the two foregoing nights with you in the\ngarden in the forest?\"  \"If that be my crime,\" replied she, \"it is easy\nto justify myself; I do not desire you to believe me, believe your\nservants and domestics; ask them if I went into the garden the evening\nbefore Monsieur de Nemours came to Colomiers, and if I did not go out,\nof it the night before two hours sooner than I used to do.\"  After this\nshe told him how she imagined she had seen somebody in the garden, and\nacknowledged that she believed it to be the Duke de Nemours; she spoke\nto him with so much confidence, and truth so naturally persuades, even\nwhere it is not probable, that Monsieur de Cleves was almost convinced\nof her innocence.  \"I don't know,\" said he, \"whether I ought to believe\nyou; I am so near death, that I would not know anything that might make\nme die with reluctance; you have cleared your innocence too late;\nhowever it will be a comfort to me to go away with the thought that you\nare worthy of the esteem I have had for you; I beg you I may be assured\nof this further comfort, that my memory will be dear to you, and that\nif it had been in your power you would have had for me the same passion\nwhich you had for another.\"  He would have gone on, but was so weak\nthat his speech failed him.  Madam de Cleves sent for the physicians,\nwho found him almost lifeless; yet he languished some days, and died at\nlast with admirable constancy.\n\nMadam de Cleves was afflicted to so violent a degree, that she lost in\na manner the use of her reason; the Queen was so kind as to come to see\nher, and carried her to a convent without her being sensible whither\nshe was conducted; her sisters-in-law brought her back to Paris, before\nshe was in a condition to feel distinctly even her griefs: when she was\nrestored to her faculty of thinking, and reflected what a husband she\nhad lost, and considered that she had caused his death by the passion\nwhich she had for another, the horror she had for herself and the Duke\nde Nemours was not to be expressed.\n\nThe Duke in the beginning of her mourning durst pay her no other\nrespects but such as decency required; he knew Madam de Cleves enough\nto be sensible that great importunities and eagerness would be\ndisagreeable to her; but what he learned afterwards plainly convinced\nhim that he ought to observe the same conduct a great while longer.\n\nA servant of the Duke's informed him that Monsieur de Cleves's\ngentleman, who was his intimate friend, had told him, in the excess of\nhis grief for the loss of his master, that Monsieur de Nemours's\njourney to Colomiers was the occasion of his death. The Duke was\nextremely surprised to hear this; but after having reflected upon it,\nhe guessed the truth in part, and rightly judged what Madam de Cleves's\nsentiments would be at first, and what a distance it would throw him\nfrom her, if she thought her husband's illness was occasioned by his\njealousy; he was of opinion that he ought not so much as to put her in\nmind of his name very soon, and he abided by that conduct, however\nsevere it appeared to him.\n\nHe took a journey to Paris, nor could he forbear calling at her house\nto enquire how she did.  He was told, that she saw nobody, and that she\nhad even given strict orders that they should not trouble her with an\naccount of any that might come to see her; those very strict orders,\nperhaps, were given with a view to the Duke, and to prevent her hearing\nhim spoken of; but he was too much in love to be able to live so\nabsolutely deprived of the sight of Madam de Cleves; he resolved to\nfind the means, let the difficulty be what it would, to get out of a\ncondition which was so insupportable to him.\n\nThe grief of that Princess exceeded the bounds of reason; a husband\ndying, and dying on her account, and with so much tenderness for her,\nnever went out of her mind: she continually revolved in her thoughts\nwhat she owed him, and she condemned herself for not having had a\npassion for him, as if that had been a thing which depended on herself;\nshe found no consolation but in the thought that she lamented him as he\ndeserved to be lamented, and that she would do nothing during the\nremainder of her life, but what he would have been glad she should have\ndone, had he lived.\n\nShe had often been thinking how he came to know, that the Duke de\nNemours had been at Colomiers; she could not suspect that the Duke\nhimself had told it; though it was indifferent to her whether he had or\nno, she thought herself so perfectly cured of the passion she had had\nfor him; and yet she was grieved at the heart to think that he was the\ncause of her husband's death; and she remembered with pain the fear\nMonsieur de Cleves expressed, when dying, lest she should marry the\nDuke; but all these griefs were swallowed up in that for the loss of\nher husband, and she thought she had no other but that one.\n\nAfter several months the violence of her grief abated, and she fell\ninto a languishing kind of melancholy.  Madam de Martigues made a\njourney to Paris, and constantly visited her during the time she stayed\nthere: she entertained her with an account of the Court, and what\npassed there; and though Madam de Cleves appeared unconcerned, yet\nstill she continued talking on that subject in hopes to divert her.\n\nShe talked to her of the Viscount, of Monsieur de Guise, and of all\nothers that were distinguished either in person or merit. \"As for the\nDuke de Nemours,\" says she, \"I don't know if State affairs have not\ntaken possession of his heart in the room of gallantry; he is\nabundantly less gay than he used to be, and seems wholly to decline the\ncompany of women; he often makes journeys to Paris, and I believe he is\nthere now.\"  The Duke de Nemours's name surprised Madam de Cleves, and\nmade her blush; she changed the discourse, nor did Madam de Martigues\ntake notice of her concern.\n\nThe next day Madam de Cleves, who employed herself in things suitable\nto the condition she was in, went to a man's house in her\nneighbourhood, that was famous for working silk after a particular\nmanner, and she designed to bespeak some pieces for herself; having\nseen several kinds of his work, she spied a chamber door, where she\nthought there were more, and desired it might be opened: the master\nanswered, he had not the key, and that the room was taken by a man, who\ncame there sometimes in the daytime to draw the plans and prospects of\nthe fine houses and gardens that were to be seen from his windows; \"he\nis one of the handsomest men I ever saw,\" added he, \"and does not look\nmuch like one that works for his living; whenever he comes here, I\nobserve he always looks towards the gardens and houses, but I never see\nhim work.\"\n\nMadam de Cleves listened to this story very attentively, and what Madam\nde Martigues had told her of Monsieur de Nemours's coming now and then\nto Paris, she applied in her fancy to that handsome man, who came to a\nplace so near her house; and this gave her an idea of Monsieur de\nNemours endeavouring to see her; which raised a disorder in her, of\nwhich she did not know the cause: she went towards the windows to see\nwhere they looked into, and she found they overlooked all her gardens,\nand directly faced her apartment: and when she was in her own room, she\ncould easily see that very window where she was told the man came to\ntake his prospects.  The thought that it was the Duke de Nemours,\nentirely changed the situation of her mind; she no longer found herself\nin that pensive tranquillity which she had begun to enjoy, her spirits\nwere ruffled again as with a tempest: at last, not being able to stay\nat home, she went abroad to take the air in a garden without the\nsuburbs, where she hoped to be alone; she walked about a great while,\nand found no likelihood of anyone's being there.\n\nHaving crossed a little wilderness she perceived at the end of the\nwalk, in the most remote part of the garden, a kind of a bower, open on\nall sides, and went towards it; when she was near, she saw a man lying\non the benches, who seemed sunk into a deep contemplation, and she\ndiscovered it was the Duke de Nemours. Upon this she stopped short: but\nher attendants made some noise, which roused the Duke out of his\nmusing: he took no notice who the persons were that disturbed him, but\ngot up in order to avoid the company that was coming towards him, and\nmaking a low bow, which hindered him from seeing those he saluted, he\nturned into another walk.\n\nIf he had known whom he avoided, with what eagerness would he have\nreturned?  But he walked down the alley, and Madam de Cleves saw him go\nout at a back door, where his coach waited for him. What an effect did\nthis transient view produce in the heart of Madam de Cleves?  What a\nflame rekindled out of the embers of her love, and with what violence\ndid it burn?  She went and sat down in the same place from which\nMonsieur de Nemours was newly risen, and seemed perfectly overwhelmed;\nhis image immediately possessed her fancy, and she considered him as\nthe most amiable person in the world, as one who had long loved her\nwith a passion full of veneration and sincerity, slighting all for her,\npaying respect even to her grief, to his own torture, labouring to see\nher without a thought of being seen by her, quitting the Court (though\nthe Court's delight) to come and look on the walls where she was shut\nup, and to pass his melancholy hours in places where he could not hope\nto meet her; in a word, a man whose attachment to her alone merited\nreturns of love, and for whom she had so strong an inclination, that\nshe should have loved him, though she had not been beloved by him; and\nbesides, one whose quality was suitable to hers: all the obstacles that\ncould rise from duty and virtue were now removed, and all the trace\nthat remained on her mind of their former condition was the passion the\nDuke de Nemours had for her, and that which she had for him.\n\nAll these ideas were new to her; her affliction for the death of her\nhusband had left her no room for thoughts of this kind, but the sight\nof Monsieur de Nemours revived them, and they crowded again into her\nmind; but when she had taken her fill of them, and remembered that this\nvery man, whom she considered as a proper match for her, was the same\nshe had loved in her husband's lifetime, and was the cause of his\ndeath, and that on his death-bed he had expressed a fear of her\nmarrying him, her severe virtue was so shocked at the imagination, that\nshe thought it would be as criminal in her to marry Monsieur de Nemours\nnow, as it was to love him before: in short, she abandoned herself to\nthese reflections so pernicious to her happiness, and fortified herself\nin them by the inconveniency which she foresaw would attend such a\nmarriage.  After two hours' stay in this place she returned home,\nconvinced that it was indispensably her duty to avoid the sight of the\nman she loved.\n\nBut this conviction, which was the effect of reason and virtue, did not\ncarry her heart along with it; her heart was so violently fixed on the\nDuke de Nemours, that she became even an object of compassion, and was\nwholly deprived of rest.  Never did she pass a night in so uneasy a\nmanner; in the morning, the first thing she did was to see if there was\nanybody at the window which looked towards her apartment; she saw there\nMonsieur de Nemours, and was so surprised upon it, and withdrew so\nhastily, as made him judge she knew him; he had often wished to be seen\nby her, ever since he had found out that method of seeing her, and when\nhe had no hopes of obtaining that satisfaction, his way was to go to\nmuse in the garden where she found him.\n\nTired at last with so unfortunate and uncertain a condition, he\nresolved to attempt something to determine his fate:  \"What should I\nwait for?\" said he.  \"I have long known she loves me; she is free; she\nhas no duty now to plead against me; why should I submit myself to the\nhardship of seeing her, without being seen by her or speaking to her?\nIs it possible for love so absolutely to have deprived me of reason and\ncourage, and to have rendered me so different from what I have been in\nall my other amours?  It was fit I should pay a regard to Madam de\nCleves's grief; but I do it too long, and I give her leisure to\nextinguish the inclination she had for me.\"\n\nAfter these reflections, he considered what measures he ought to take\nto see her; he found he had no longer any reason to conceal his passion\nfrom the Viscount de Chartres; he resolved to speak to him of it, and\nto communicate to him his design with regard to his niece.\n\nThe Viscount was then at Paris, the town being extremely full, and\neverybody busy in preparing equipages and dresses to attend the King of\nNavarre, who was to conduct the Queen of Spain: Monsieur de Nemours,\nwent to the Viscount, and made an ingenuous confession to him of all he\nhad concealed hitherto, except Madam de Cleves's sentiments, which he\nwould not seem to know.\n\nThe Viscount received what he told him with a great deal of pleasure,\nand assured him, that though he was not acquainted with his sentiments\non that subject, he had often thought, since Madam de Cleves had been a\nwidow, that she was the only lady that deserved him.  Monsieur de\nNemours entreated him to give him an opportunity of speaking to her,\nand learning what disposition she was in.\n\nThe Viscount proposed to carry him to her house, but the Duke was of\nopinion she would be shocked at it, because as yet she saw nobody; so\nthat they agreed, it would be better for the Viscount to ask her to\ncome to him, under some pretence, and for the Duke to come to them by a\nprivate staircase, that he might not be observed.  Accordingly this was\nexecuted; Madam de Cleves came, the Viscount went to receive her, and\nled her into a great closet at the end of his apartment; some time\nafter Monsieur de Nemours came in, as by chance:  Madam de Cleves was\nin great surprise to see him; she blushed and endeavoured to hide it;\nthe Viscount at first spoke of indifferent matters, and then went out,\nas if he had some orders to give, telling Madam de Cleves he must\ndesire her to entertain the Duke in his stead, and that he would return\nimmediately.\n\nIt is impossible to express the sentiments of Monsieur de Nemours, and\nMadam de Cleves, when they saw themselves alone, and at liberty to\nspeak to one another, as they had never been before: they continued\nsilent a while; at length, said Monsieur de Nemours, \"Can you, Madam,\npardon the Viscount for giving me an opportunity of seeing you, and\nspeaking to you, an opportunity which you have always so cruelly denied\nme?\"  \"I ought not to pardon him,\" replied she, \"for having forgot the\ncondition I am in, and to what he exposes my reputation.\"  Having spoke\nthese words, she would have gone away; but Monsieur de Nemours stopping\nher, \"Fear not, Madam,\" said he; \"you have nothing to apprehend; nobody\nknows I am here; hear me, Madam, hear me, if not out of goodness, yet\nat least for your own sake, and to free yourself from the\nextravagancies which a passion I am no longer master of will infallibly\nhurry me into.\"  Madam de Cleves now first yielded to the inclination\nshe had for the Duke de Nemours, and beholding him with eyes full of\nsoftness and charms, \"But what can you hope for,\" says she, \"from the\ncomplaisance you desire of me?  You will perhaps repent that you have\nobtained it, and I shall certainly repent that I have granted it.  You\ndeserve a happier fortune than you have hitherto had, or than you can\nhave for the future, unless you seek it elsewhere.\"  \"I, Madam,\" said\nhe, \"seek happiness anywhere else?  Or is there any happiness for me,\nbut in your love?  Though I never spoke of it before, I cannot believe,\nMadam, that you are not acquainted with my passion, or that you do not\nknow it to be the greatest and most sincere that ever was; what trials\nhas it suffered in things you are a stranger to?  What trials have you\nput it to by your rigour?\"\n\n\"Since you are desirous I should open myself to you,\" answered Madam de\nCleves, \"I'll comply with your desire, and I'll do it with a sincerity\nthat is rarely to be met with in persons of my sex:  I shall not tell\nyou that I have not observed your passion for me; perhaps you would not\nbelieve me if I should tell you so; I confess therefore to you, not\nonly that I have observed it, but that I have observed it in such\nlights as you yourself could wish it might appear to me in.\"  \"And if\nyou have seen my passion, Madam,\" said he, \"is it possible for you not\nto have been moved by it?  And may I venture to ask, if it has made no\nimpression on your heart?\"  \"You should have judged of that from my\nconduct,\" replied she; \"but I should be glad to know what you thought\nof it.\"  \"I ought to be in a happier condition,\" replied he, \"to\nventure to inform you; my fortune would contradict what I should say;\nall I can tell you, Madam, is that I heartily wished you had not\nacknowledged to Monsieur de Cleves what you concealed from me, and that\nyou had concealed from him what you made appear to me.\"  \"How came you\nto discover,\" replied she blushing, \"that I acknowledged anything to\nMonsieur de Cleves?\"  \"I learned it from yourself, Madam,\" replied he;\n\"but that you may the better pardon the boldness I showed in listening\nto what you said, remember if I have made an ill use of what I heard,\nif my hopes rose upon it, or if I was the more encouraged to speak to\nyou.\"\n\nHere he began to relate how he had overheard her conversation with\nMonsieur de Cleves; but she interrupted him before he had finished;\n\"Say no more of it,\" said she, \"I see how you came to be so well\ninformed; I suspected you knew the business but too well at the\nQueen-Dauphin's, who learned this adventure from those you had\nentrusted with it.\"\n\nUpon this Monsieur de Nemours informed her in what manner the thing\ncame to pass; \"No excuses,\" says she; \"I have long forgiven you,\nwithout being informed how it was brought about; but since you have\nlearned from my ownself what I designed to conceal from you all my\nlife, I will acknowledge to you that you have inspired me with\nsentiments I was unacquainted with before I saw you, and of which I had\nso slender an idea, that they gave me at first a surprise which still\nadded to the pain that constantly attends them: I am the less ashamed\nto make you this confession, because I do it at a time when I may do it\nwithout a crime, and because you have seen that my conduct has not been\ngoverned by my affections.\"\n\n\"Can you believe, Madam,\" said Monsieur de Nemours, falling on his\nknees, \"but I shall expire at your feet with joy and transport?\"  \"I\nhave told you nothing,\" said she smiling, \"but what you knew too well\nbefore.\"  \"Ah! Madam,\" said he, \"what a difference is there between\nlearning it by chance, and knowing it from yourself, and seeing withal\nthat you are pleased I know it.\"  \"It is true,\" answered she, \"I would\nhave you know it, and I find a pleasure in telling it you; I don't even\nknow if I do not tell it you more for my own sake, than for yours; for,\nafter all, this confession will have no consequences, and I shall\nfollow the austere rules which my duty imposes upon me.\"  \"How! Madam;\nyou are not of this opinion,\" replied Monsieur de Nemours; \"you are no\nlonger under any obligation of duty; you are at liberty; and if I\ndurst, I should even tell you, that it is in your power to act so, that\nyour duty shall one day oblige you to preserve the sentiments you have\nfor me.\"  \"My duty,\" replied she, \"forbids me to think of any man, but\nof you the last in the world, and for reasons which are unknown to\nyou.\"  \"Those reasons perhaps are not unknown to me,\" answered he, \"but\nthey are far from being good ones.  I believe that Monsieur de Cleves\nthought me happier than I was, and imagined that you approved of those\nextravagancies which my passion led me into without your approbation.\"\n\"Let us talk no more of that adventure,\" said she; \"I cannot bear the\nthought of it, it giving me shame, and the consequences of it have been\nsuch that it is too melancholy a subject to be spoken of; it is but too\ntrue that you were the cause of Monsieur de Cleves's death; the\nsuspicions which your inconsiderate conduct gave him, cost him his life\nas much as if you had taken it away with your own hands: judge what I\nought to have done, had you two fought a duel, and he been killed; I\nknow very well, it is not the same thing in the eye of the world, but\nwith me there's no difference, since I know that his death was owing to\nyou, and that it was on my account.\" \"Ah! Madam,\" said Monsieur de\nNemours, \"what phantom of duty do you oppose to my happiness?  What!\nMadam, shall a vain and groundless fancy hinder you from making a man\nhappy, for whom you have an inclination?  What, have I had some ground\nto hope I might pass my life with you? has my fate led me to love the\nmost deserving lady in the world? have I observed in her all that can\nmake a mistress adorable?  Has she had no disliking to me?  Have I\nfound in her conduct everything which perhaps I could wish for in a\nwife?  For in short, Madam, you are perhaps the only person in whom\nthose two characters have ever concurred to the degree they are in you;\nthose who marry mistresses, by whom they are loved, tremble when they\nmarry them, and cannot but fear lest they should observe the same\nconduct towards others which they observed towards them; but in you,\nMadam, I can fear nothing, I see nothing in you but matter of\nadmiration: have I had a prospect of so much felicity for no other end\nbut to see it obstructed by you?  Ah! Madam, you forget, that you have\ndistinguished me above other men; or rather, you have not distinguished\nme; you have deceived yourself, and I have flattered myself.\"\n\n\"You have not flattered yourself,\" replied she; \"the reasons of my duty\nwould not perhaps appear so strong to me without that distinction of\nwhich you doubt, and it is that which makes me apprehend unfortunate\nconsequences from your alliance.\"  \"I have nothing to answer, Madam,\"\nreplied he, \"when you tell me you apprehend unfortunate consequences;\nbut I own, that after all you have been pleased to say to me, I did not\nexpect from you so cruel a reason.\"  \"The reason you speak of,\" replied\nMadam de Cleves, \"is so little disobliging as to you, that I don't know\nhow to tell it you.\"  \"Alas!  Madam,\" said he, \"how can you fear I\nshould flatter myself too much after what you have been saying to me?\"\n\"I shall continue to speak to you,\" says she, \"with the same sincerity\nwith which I begun, and I'll lay aside that delicacy and reserve that\nmodesty obliges one to in a first conversation, but I conjure you to\nhear me without interruption.\n\n\"I think I owe the affection you have for me, the poor recompsense not\nto hide from you any of my thoughts, and to let you see them such as\nthey really are; this in all probability will be the only time I  shall\nallow myself the freedom to discover them to you; and I cannot confess\nwithout a blush, that the certainty of not being loved by you, as I am,\nappears to me so dreadful a misfortune, that if I had not invincible\nreasons grounded on my duty, I could not resolve to subject myself to\nit; I know that you are free, that I am so too, and that circumstances\nare such, that the public perhaps would have no reason to blame either\nyou or me, should we unite ourselves forever; but do men continue to\nlove, when under engagements for life?  Ought I to expect a miracle in\nmy favour?  And shall I place myself in a condition of seeing certainly\nthat passion come to an end, in which I should place all my felicity?\nMonsieur de Cleves was perhaps the only man in the world capable of\ncontinuing to love after marriage; it was my ill fate that I was not\nable to enjoy that happiness, and perhaps his passion had not lasted\nbut that he found none, in me; but I should not have the same way of\npreserving yours; I even think your constancy is owing to the obstacles\nyou have met with; you have met with enough to animate you to conquer\nthem; and my unguarded actions, or what you learned by chance, gave you\nhopes enough not to be discouraged.\"  \"Ah!  Madam,\" replied Monsieur de\nNemours, \"I cannot keep the silence you enjoined me; you do me too much\ninjustice, and make it appear too clearly that you are far from being\nprepossessed in my favour.\"  \"I confess,\" answered she, \"that my\npassions may lead me, but they cannot blind me; nothing can hinder me\nfrom knowing that you are born with a disposition for gallantry, and\nhave all the qualities proper to give success; you have already had a\ngreat many amours, and you will have more; I should no longer be she\nyou placed your happiness in; I should see you as warm for another as\nyou had been for me; this would grievously vex me, and I am not sure I\nshould not have the torment of jealousy; I have said too much to\nconceal from you that you have already made me know what jealousy is,\nand that I suffered such cruel inquietudes the evening the Queen gave\nme Madam de Themines's letter, which it was said was addressed to you,\nthat to this moment I retain an idea of it, which makes me believe it\nis the worst of all ills.\n\n\"There is scarce a woman but out of vanity or inclination desires to\nengage you; there are very few whom you do not please, and my own\nexperience would make me believe, that there are none whom it is not in\nyour power to please; I should think you always in love and beloved,\nnor should I be often mistaken; and yet in this case I should have no\nremedy but patience, nay I question if I should dare to complain: a\nlover may be reproached; but can a husband be so, when one has nothing\nto urge, but that he loves one no longer?  But admit I could accustom\nmyself to bear a misfortune of this nature, yet how could I bear that\nof imagining I constantly saw Monsieur de Cleves, accusing you of his\ndeath, reproaching me with having loved you, with having married you,\nand showing me the difference betwixt his affection and yours? It is\nimpossible to over-rule such strong reasons as these; I must continue\nin the condition I am in, and in the resolution I have taken never to\nalter it.\"  \"Do you believe you have the power to do it, Madam?\" cried\nthe Duke de Nemours.  \"Do you think your resolution can hold out\nagainst a man who adores, and who has the happiness to please you?  It\nis more difficult than you imagine, Madam, to resist a person who\npleases and loves one at the same time; you have done it by an\nausterity of virtue, which is almost without example; but that virtue\nno longer opposes your inclinations, and I hope you will follow them in\nspite of yourself.\"  \"I know nothing can be more difficult than what I\nundertake,\" replied Madam de Cleves; \"I distrust my strength in the\nmidst of my reasons; what I think I owe to the memory of Monsieur de\nCleves would be a weak consideration, if not supported by the interest\nof my ease and repose; and the reasons of my repose have need to be\nsupported by those of my duty; but though I distrust myself, I believe\nI shall never overcome my scruples, nor do I so much as hope to\novercome the inclination I have for you; that inclination will make me\nunhappy, and I will deny myself the sight of you, whatever violence it\nis to me:  I conjure you, by all the power I have over you, to seek no\noccasion of seeing me; I am in a condition which makes that criminal\nwhich might be lawful at another time; decency forbids all commerce\nbetween us.\"  Monsieur de Nemours threw himself at her feet, and gave a\nloose to all the violent motions with which he was agitated; he\nexpressed both by his words and tears the liveliest and most tender\npassion that ever heart was touched with; nor was the heart of Madam de\nCleves insensible; she looked upon him with eyes swelled with tears:\n\"Why was it,\" cries she, \"that I can charge you with Monsieur de\nCleves's death?  Why did not my first acquaintance with you begin since\nI have been at liberty, or why did not I know you before I was engaged?\nWhy does fate separate us by such invincible obstacles?\"  \"There are no\nobstacles, Madam,\" replied Monsieur de Nemours; \"it is you alone oppose\nmy happiness; you impose on yourself a law which virtue and reason do\nnot require you to obey.\"  \"'Tis true,\" says she, \"I sacrifice a great\ndeal to a duty which does not subsist but in my imagination; have\npatience, and expect what time may produce; Monsieur de Cleves is but\njust expired, and that mournful object is too near to leave me clear\nand distinct views; in the meantime enjoy the satisfaction to know you\nhave gained the heart of a person who would never have loved anyone,\nhad she not seen you: believe the inclination I have for you will last\nforever, and that it will be uniform and the same, whatever becomes of\nme: Adieu,\" said she; \"this is a conversation I ought to blush for;\nhowever, give an account of it to the Viscount; I agree to it, and\ndesire you to do it.\"\n\nWith these words she went away, nor could Monsieur de Nemours detain\nher.  In the next room she met with the Viscount, who seeing her under\nso much concern would not speak to her, but led her to her coach\nwithout saying a word; he returned to Monsieur de Nemours, who was so\nfull of joy, grief, admiration, and of all those affections that attend\na passion full of hope and fear, that he had not the use of his reason.\nIt was a long time ere the Viscount could get from him an account of\nthe conversation; at last the Duke related it to him, and Monsieur de\nChartres, without being in love, no less admired the virtue, wit and\nmerit of Madam de Cleves, than did Monsieur de Nemours himself; they\nbegan to examine what issue could reasonably be hoped for in this\naffair; and however fearful the Duke de Nemours was from his love, he\nagreed with the Viscount, that it was impossible Madam de Cleves should\ncontinue in the resolution she was in; they were of opinion\nnevertheless that it was necessary to follow her orders, for fear, upon\nthe public's perceiving the inclination he had for her, she should make\ndeclarations and enter into engagements with respect to the world, that\nshe would afterwards abide by, lest it should be thought she loved him\nin her husband's lifetime.\n\nMonsieur de Nemours determined to follow the King; it was a journey he\ncould not well excuse himself from, and so he resolved to go without\nendeavouring to see Madam de Cleves again from the window out of which\nhe had sometimes seen her; he begged the Viscount to speak to her; and\nwhat did he not desire him to say in his behalf?  What an infinite\nnumber of reasons did he furnish him with, to persuade her to conquer\nher scruples?  In short, great part of the night was spent before he\nthought of going away.\n\nAs for Madam de Cleves, she was in no condition to rest; it was a thing\nso new to her to have broke loose from the restraints she had laid on\nherself, to have endured the first declarations of love that ever were\nmade to her, and to have confessed that she herself was in love with\nhim that made them, all this was so new to her, that she seemed quite\nanother person; she was surprised at what she had done; she repented of\nit; she was glad of it; all her thoughts were full of anxiety and\npassion; she examined again the reasons of her duty, which obstructed\nher happiness; she was grieved to find them so strong, and was sorry\nthat she had made them out so clear to Monsieur de Nemours: though she\nhad entertained thoughts of marrying him, as soon as she beheld him in\nthe garden of the suburbs, yet her late conversation with him made a\nmuch greater impression on her mind; at some moments she could not\ncomprehend how she could be unhappy by marrying him, and she was ready\nto say in her heart, that her scruples as to what was past, and her\nfears for the future, were equally groundless: at other times, reason\nand her duty prevailed in her thoughts, and violently hurried her into\na resolution not to marry again, and never to see Monsieur de Nemours;\nbut this was a resolution hard to be established in a heart so softened\nas hers, and so lately abandoned to the charms of love.  At last, to\ngive herself a little ease, she concluded that it was not yet necessary\nto do herself the violence of coming to any resolution, and decency\nallowed her a considerable time to determine what to do: however she\nresolved to continue firm in having no commerce with Monsieur de\nNemours.  The Viscount came to see her, and pleaded his friend's cause\nwith all the wit and application imaginable, but could not make her\nalter her conduct, or recall the severe orders she had given to\nMonsieur de Nemours; she told him her design was not to change her\ncondition; that she knew how difficult it was to stand to that design,\nbut that she hoped she should be able to do it; she made him so\nsensible how far she was affected with the opinion that Monsieur de\nNemours was the cause of her husband's death, and how much she was\nconvinced that it would be contrary to her duty to marry him, that the\nViscount was afraid it would be very difficult to take away those\nimpressions; he did not, however, tell the Duke what he thought, when\nhe gave him an account of his conversation with her, but left him as\nmuch hope as a man who is loved may reasonably have.\n\nThey set out the next day, and went after the King; the Viscount wrote\nto Madam de Cleves at Monsieur de Nemours's request, and in a second\nletter, which soon followed the first, the Duke wrote a line or two in\nhis own hand; but Madam de Cleves determined not to depart from the\nrules she had prescribed herself, and fearing the accidents that might\nhappen from letters, informed the Viscount that she would receive his\nletters no more, if he continued to speak of Monsieur de Nemours, and\ndid it in so peremptory a manner, that the Duke desired him not to\nmention him.\n\nDuring the absence of the Court, which was gone to conduct the Queen of\nSpain as far as Poitou, Madam de Cleves continued at home; and the more\ndistant she was from Monsieur de Nemours, and from everything that\ncould put her in mind of him, the more she recalled the memory of the\nPrince of Cleves, which she made it her glory to preserve; the reasons\nshe had not to marry the Duke de Nemours appeared strong with respect\nto her duty, but invincible with respect to her quiet; the opinion she\nhad, that marriage would put an end to his love, and the torments of\njealousy, which she thought the infallible consequences of marriage,\ngave her the prospect of a certain unhappiness if she consented to his\ndesires; on the other hand, she thought it impossible, if he were\npresent, to refuse the most amiable man in the world, the man who loved\nher, and whom she loved, and to oppose him in a thing that was neither\ninconsistent with virtue nor decency: she thought that nothing but\nabsence and distance could give her the power to do it; and she found\nshe stood in need of them, not only to support her resolution not to\nmarry, but even to keep her from seeing Monsieur de Nemours; she\nresolved therefore to take a long journey, in order to pass away the\ntime which decency obliged her to spend in retirement; the fine estate\nshe had near the Pyrenees seemed the most proper place she could make\nchoice of; she set out a few days before the Court returned, and wrote\nat parting to the Viscount to conjure him not to think of once\nenquiring after her, or of writing to her.\n\nMonsieur de Nemours was as much troubled at this journey as another\nwould have been for the death of his mistress; the thought of being\ndeprived so long a time of the sight of Madam de Cleves grieved him to\nthe soul, especially as it happened at a time when he had lately\nenjoyed the pleasure of seeing her, and of seeing her moved by his\npassion; however he could do nothing but afflict himself, and his\naffliction increased every day. Madam de Cleves, whose spirits had been\nso much agitated, was no sooner arrived at her country seat, but she\nfell desperately ill; the news of it was brought to Court; Monsieur de\nNemours was inconsolable; his grief proceeded even to despair and\nextravagance; the Viscount had much a-do to hinder him from discovering\nhis passion in public, and as much a-do to keep him from going in\nperson to know how she did; the relation and friendship between her and\nthe Viscount served as an excuse for sending frequent messengers; at\nlast they heard she was out of the extremity of danger she had been in,\nbut continued in a languishing malady that left but little hopes of\nlife.\n\nThe nature of her disease gave her a prospect of death both near, and\nat a distance, and showed her the things of this life in a very\ndifferent view from that in which they are seen by people in health;\nthe necessity of dying, to which she saw herself so near, taught her to\nwean herself from the world, and the lingeringness of her distemper\nbrought her to a habit in it; yet when she was a little recovered, she\nfound that Monsieur de Nemours was not effaced from her heart; but to\ndefend herself against him, she called to her aid all the reasons which\nshe thought she had never to marry him; after a long conflict in\nherself, she subdued the relics of that passion which had been weakened\nby the sentiments her illness had given her; the thoughts of death had\nreproached her with the memory of Monsieur de Cleves, and this\nremembrance was so agreeable to her duty, that it made deep impressions\nin her heart; the passions and engagements of the world appeared to her\nin the light, in which they appear to persons who have more great and\nmore distant views.  The weakness of her body, which was brought very\nlow, aided her in preserving these sentiments; but as she knew what\npower opportunities have over the wisest resolutions, she would not\nhazard the breach of those she had taken, by returning into any place\nwhere she might see him she loved; she retired, under pretence of\nchange of air, into a convent, but without declaring a settled\nresolution of quitting the Court.\n\nUpon the first news of it, Monsieur de Nemours felt the weight of this\nretreat, and saw the importance of it; he presently thought he had\nnothing more to hope, but omitted not anything that might oblige her to\nreturn; he prevailed with the Queen to write; he made the Viscount not\nonly write, but go to her, but all to no purpose; the Viscount saw her,\nbut she did not tell him she had fixed her resolution; and yet he\njudged, she would never return to Court; at last Monsieur de Nemours\nhimself went to her, under pretence of using the waters; she was\nextremely grieved and surprised to hear he was come, and sent him word\nby a person of merit about her, that she desired him not to take it ill\nif she did not expose herself to the danger of seeing him, and of\ndestroying by his presence those sentiments she was obliged to\npreserve; that she desired he should know, that having found it both\nagainst her duty and peace of mind to yield to the inclination she had\nto be his, all things else were become so indifferent to her, that she\nhad renounced them for ever; that she thought only of another life, and\nhad no sentiment remaining as to this, but the desire of seeing him in\nthe same dispositions she was in.\n\nMonsieur de Nemours was like to have expired in the presence of the\nlady who told him this; he begged her a thousand times to return to\nMadam de Cleves, and to get leave for him to see her; but she told him\nthe Princess had not only forbidden her to come back with any message\nfrom him, but even to report the conversation that should pass between\nthem.  At length Monsieur de Nemours was obliged to go back, oppressed\nwith the heaviest grief a man is capable of, who has lost all hopes of\never seeing again a person, whom  he loved not only with the most\nviolent, but most natural and sincere passion that ever was; yet still\nhe was not utterly discouraged, but used all imaginable methods to make\nher alter her resolution; at last, after several years, time and\nabsence abated his grief, and extinguished his passion. Madam de Cleves\nlived in a manner that left no probability of her ever returning to\nCourt; she spent one part of the year in that religious house, and the\nother at her own, but still continued the austerity of retirement, and\nconstantly employed herself in exercises more holy than the severest\nconvents can pretend to; and her life, though it was short, left\nexamples of inimitable virtues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Princess of Cleves, by Madame de Lafayette\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCESS OF CLEVES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 467.txt or 467.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/6\/467\/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":754,"split":"train"}
