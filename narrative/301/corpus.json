The boy grows up, the woman dies. Gilliat becomes a good fisherman and sailor. People believe him to be a wizard.\nIn Guernsey also lives Mess Lethierry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a former sailor and owner of the first steamship of the island, the Durande \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with his niece Deruchette. One day, near Christmas, when going to church, she sees Gilliat on the road behind her and writes his name in the snow. He sees this and becomes obsessed with her gesture. In time he falls in love with her and goes to play the bagpipes near her house.\nSieur Clubin, the trusted captain of Durande, sets up a plan to sink the ship on the Hanois reef and flee with a ship of Spanish smugglers, Tamaulipas. He gets in touch with Rantaine, a swindler who had stolen a large sum of money from Mess Lethierry many years ago. Clubin takes the money from Rantaine at gunpoint.\nIn thick fog, Clubin sails for the Hanois reef from where he can easily swim to the shore, meet the smugglers, and disappear, giving the appearance of having drowned. Because of the fog he has mistakenly arrived at the Douvres reef, which is still halfway between Guernsey and France. Left alone on the ship, he is terrified, but he sees a cutter and leaps into the water to catch it. At that moment he is grabbed by the leg and is pulled down to the bottom.\nEverybody in Guernsey finds out about the shipwreck. Mess Lethierry is desperate to get the Durande's engine back. His niece declares she will marry the rescuer of the engine, and Mess Lethierry swears she will marry no other. Gilliat immediately takes up the mission, enduring hunger, thirst, and cold trying to free the engine from the wreck. In a battle with an octopus, he finds the skeleton of Clubin and the stolen money on the bottom of the sea.\nEventually he succeeds in returning the engine to Lethierry, who is very pleased and ready to honour his promise. Gilliat appears in front of the people as the rescuer but he declines to marry Deruchette because he had seen her accepting a marriage proposal made by Ebenezer Caudry, the young priest recently arrived on the island. He arranges their hurried wedding and helps them run away on the sailing ship Cashmere. In the end, with all his dreams shattered, Gilliat decides to wait for the tide sitting on the Gild Holm'Ur chair (a rock in the sea) and drowns as he watches the Cashmere disappear on the horizon.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Toilers of the Sea, by Victor Hugo\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

There is a familiar glimpse of the\nHugo household to be had in the first winter of its transference to the\nChannel Islands, years before _Les Travailleurs_ was written, which\nbetrays the mood from which finally sprang this concrete fable of the\nman-at-odds. It was the end of November 1852, and a father and his\nyounger son sat in a room of a house of Marine Terrace, Jersey--a plain,\nunpicturesque house; square, hard in outline, and newly\nwhitewashed,--Methodism, said Hugo, in stones and mortar. Outside its\nwindows the rain fell and the wind blew: the house was like a thing\nbenumbed by the angry noise. The two inmates sat plunged in thought,\npossibly thinking of the sad significance of these beginnings of winter\nand of exile which had arrived together. At length the son (Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois\nHugo) asked the father what he meant to do during their exile, which he\nhad already predicted would be long? The father said, \"I shall look at\nthe sea.\" Then came a silence, broken by a question as to what the son\nwould do? To which he replied that he would translate Shakespeare.\n\nVictor Hugo's own study or eulogy of Shakespeare was written as a\npreamble to his son's translation of the plays. It is not too much to\nconnect the new and ample creative work that followed, including his\ngreat novel of Revolution, _Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables_, and his poems in _La\nL\u00c3\u00a9gende des Si\u00c3\u00a8cles_ (first series) with the double artistic stimulus\ngained from this conditioned solitude and his closer acquaintance with\nthe dramatic mind of that \"giant of the great art of the ages,\" as he\ntermed our English poet in the book already quoted from.\n\nThe Shakespeare book is dated from Hauteville House, 1864. _Les\nTravailleurs_ from the same quarters, March 1866. The Hugos had perforce\nsuddenly left Jersey for Guernsey in 1855, owing to the gibes and flouts\nof an unlucky revolutionary Jersey journal, _L'Homme_, at the two\ngovernments: Victor Hugo being already a marked man for his pains. The\nGuernsey house he inhabited for so many years had a spacious study in\nits upper story, with a large window, free to the sun and to the sea.\nHere he wrote, tirelessly, tremendously, as his custom was: beginning\nbetimes in the early morning, and writing on till the time for his\n_d\u00c3\u00a9jeuner_: standing at a tall desk to write in his sea-tower. You must\nturn to certain of his poems and to the pages of _Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables_ and\n_Les Travailleurs_ for the mental colours and phantasmagoria of those\ndays and years.\n\nIt would be easy to point out, resuming an immense amount of criticism\nof his romances and of this story in particular, the defects on the side\nof dramatic and true life-likeness to be found in Hugo's\nprose-narrative. But it is more helpful in turning to a story-book to\nknow what has been said unreservedly in its favour. Hugo's greatest\nappreciator was superlative in his praise, and it need hardly be\nexplained that it was Swinburne who brought his tribute to the romance\nof Gilliatt also, after positing the parallel claims of Hugo's five\nchief romances. Of the five, they were not, he said, to be comparatively\nclassified in order of merit. \"But I may perhaps be permitted to say\nwithout fear of deserved rebuke that none is to me personally a treasure\nof greater price than _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_. The splendid energy\nof the book makes the superhuman energy of the hero seem not only\npossible but natural, and his triumph over all physical impossibilities\nnot only natural but inevitable.\" Swinburne's love for the Channel\nIslands, and his poems inspired by them, were mainly due as we know to\nHugo's life and his books lived and written there.\n\n    E.R.\n\nThe following is a list of the chief publications of Victor Hugo:--\n\n    POETICAL WORKS:--Nouvelles Odes, 1824; Odes et Po\u00c3\u00a9sies Diverses,\n    1822; Odes et Ballades, 1826; Les Orientales, 1829; Feuilles\n    d'Automne, 1831; Les Chants du Cr\u00c3\u00a9puscule, 1835; Les Voix\n    Int\u00c3\u00a9rieures, 1837; Les Rayons et les Ombres, 1840; Odes sur\n    Napol\u00c3\u00a9on, 1840; Les Ch\u00c3\u00a2timents, 1853; Les Contemplations, 1856; La\n    L\u00c3\u00a9gende des Si\u00c3\u00a8cles (1st part), 1859; Les Chansons des Rues et des\n    Bois, 1865; L'Ann\u00c3\u00a9e Terrible, 1872; La L\u00c3\u00a9gende des Si\u00c3\u00a8cles (2nd\n    part), 1877; L'Art d'\u00c3\u00aatre Grand-p\u00c3\u00a8re, 1877; Le Pape, 1878; La Piti\u00c3\u00a9\n    Supr\u00c3\u00aame, 1879; L'\u00c3\u0082ne, 1880; Religion et Religions, 1880; Les Quatre\n    Vents de l'Esprit, 1881; La L\u00c3\u00a9gende des Si\u00c3\u00a8cles (3rd part), 1883.\n\n    DRAMATIC WORKS:--Cromwell, 1827; Amy Robsart, 1828; Hernani, 1830;\n    Marion Delorme, 1831; Le Roi s'amuse, 1832; Lucr\u00c3\u00a8ce Borgia, 1833;\n    Marie Tudor, 1833; Angelo, Tyran de Padoue, 1835; La Esmeralda\n    (libretto for Opera), 1836; Ruy Blas, 1838; Burgraves, 1843;\n    Torquemada, 1882.\n\n    NOVELS AND OTHER PROSE WORKS:--Hans d'Islande, 1823; Bug-Jargal\n    (enlarged for book form), 1826; Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamn\u00c3\u00a9, 1829;\n    Notre-Dame de Paris, 1831; \u00c3\u0089tude sur Mirabeau, 1834; Claude Gueux,\n    1834; Le Rhin, 1842; Napol\u00c3\u00a9on le Petit, 1852; Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables, 1862;\n    Litt\u00c3\u00a9rature et Philosophie m\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9es, 1864; William Shakespeare, 1864;\n    Les Travailleurs de la Mer, 1866; L'Homme qui rit, 1869; Actes et\n    Paroles, 1872; Quatre-Vingt-Treize, 1873; Histoire d'un Crime, 1877;\n    Discours pour Voltaire, 1878; Le Domaine public payant, 1878;\n    L'Archipel de la Manche, 1883.\n\n    Hugo left a mass of manuscripts, of which some have been published\n    since his death:--Le Th\u00c3\u00a9atre en Libert\u00c3\u00a9, La Fin de Satan, Dieu,\n    Choses Vues, Tonte la Lyre, Oc\u00c3\u00a9an, En Voyage, Postscriptum de ma\n    Vie.\n\n    An Edition D\u00c3\u00a9finitive of his works in 48 volumes was published\n    1880-5.\n\n    TRANSLATIONS:--Of novels, 28 vols., 1895, 1899, etc.; of dramas, by\n    I.G.

He has need of a\nfaith; hence the temple. He must create; hence the city. He must live;\nhence the plough and the ship. But these three solutions comprise three\nperpetual conflicts. The mysterious difficulty of life results from all\nthree. Man strives with obstacles under the form of superstition, under\nthe form of prejudice, and under the form of the elements. A triple\n[Greek: anagk\u00c3\u00aa] weighs upon us. There is the fatality of dogmas, the\noppression of human laws, the inexorability of nature. In _Notre Dame de\nParis_ the author denounced the first; in the _Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables_ he\nexemplified the second; in this book he indicates the third. With these\nthree fatalities mingles that inward fatality--the supreme [Greek:\nanagk\u00c3\u00aa], the human heart.\n\n    HAUTEVILLE HOUSE,\n    _March, 1866_.\n\n           I DEDICATE THIS BOOK\n                 TO THE\n       ROCK OF HOSPITALITY AND LIBERTY\n    TO THAT PORTION OF OLD NORMAN GROUND\n              INHABITED BY\n     THE NOBLE LITTLE NATION OF THE SEA\n         TO THE ISLAND OF GUERNSEY\n     SEVERE YET KIND, MY PRESENT ASYLUM\n             PERHAPS MY TOMB\n\n    V.H.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nPART I\n\nSIEUR CLUBIN\n\n\n    Book I.--THE HISTORY OF A BAD REPUTATION\n\n      CHAP.

Snow fell on that day. In the Channel Islands a frosty winter\nis uncommon, and a fall of snow is an event.\n\nOn that Christmas morning, the road which skirts the seashore from St.\nPeter's Port to the Vale was clothed in white. From midnight till the\nbreak of day the snow had been falling. Towards nine o'clock, a little\nafter the rising of the wintry sun, as it was too early yet for the\nChurch of England folks to go to St. Sampson's, or for the Wesleyans to\nrepair to Eldad Chapel, the road was almost deserted. Throughout that\nportion of the highway which separates the first from the second tower,\nonly three foot-passengers could be seen. These were a child, a man, and\na woman. Walking at a distance from each other, these wayfarers had no\nvisible connection. The child, a boy of about eight years old, had\nstopped, and was looking curiously at the wintry scene. The man walked\nbehind the woman, at a distance of about a hundred paces. Like her he\nwas coming from the direction of the church of St. Sampson. The\nappearance of the man, who was still young, was something between that\nof a workman and a sailor. He wore his working-day clothes--a kind of\nGuernsey shirt of coarse brown stuff, and trousers partly concealed by\ntarpaulin leggings--a costume which seemed to indicate that,\nnotwithstanding the holy day, he was going to no place of worship. His\nheavy shoes of rough leather, with their soles covered with large\nnails, left upon the snow, as he walked, a print more like that of a\nprison lock than the foot of a man. The woman, on the contrary, was\nevidently dressed for church. She wore a large mantle of black silk,\nwadded, under which she had coquettishly adjusted a dress of Irish\npoplin, trimmed alternately with white and pink; but for her red\nstockings, she might have been taken for a Parisian. She walked on with\na light and free step, so little suggestive of the burden of life that\nit might easily be seen that she was young. Her movements possessed that\nsubtle grace which indicates the most delicate of all transitions--that\nsoft intermingling, as it were, of two twilights--the passage from the\ncondition of a child to that of womanhood. The man seemed to take no\nheed of her.\n\nSuddenly, near a group of oaks at the corner of a field, and at the spot\ncalled the Basses Maisons, she turned, and the movement seemed to\nattract the attention of the man. She stopped, seemed to reflect a\nmoment, then stooped, and the man fancied that he could discern that she\nwas tracing with her finger some letters in the snow. Then she rose\nagain, went on her way at a quicker pace, turned once more, this time\nsmiling, and disappeared to the left of the roadway, by the footpath\nunder the hedges which leads to the Ivy Castle. When she had turned for\nthe second time, the man had recognised her as D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, a charming\ngirl of that neighbourhood.\n\nThe man felt no need of quickening his pace; and some minutes later he\nfound himself near the group of oaks. Already he had ceased to think of\nthe vanished D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; and if, at that moment, a porpoise had appeared\nabove the water, or a robin had caught his eye in the hedges, it is\nprobable that he would have passed on his way. But it happened that his\neyes were fixed upon the ground; his gaze fell mechanically upon the\nspot where the girl had stopped. Two little footprints were there\nplainly visible; and beside them he read this word, evidently written by\nher in the snow--\n\n    \"GILLIATT.\"\n\nIt was his own name.\n\nHe lingered for awhile motionless, looking at the letters, the little\nfootprints, and the snow; and then walked on, evidently in a thoughtful\nmood.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE B\u00c3\u009b DE LA RUE\n\n\nGilliatt lived in the parish of St. Sampson. He was not liked by his\nneighbours; and there were reasons for that fact.\n\nTo begin with, he lived in a queer kind of \"haunted\" dwelling. In the\nislands of Jersey and Guernsey, sometimes in the country, but often in\nstreets with many inhabitants, you will come upon a house the entrance\nto which is completely barricaded. Holly bushes obstruct the doorway,\nhideous boards, with nails, conceal the windows below; while the\ncasements of the upper stories are neither closed nor open: for all the\nwindow-frames are barred, but the glass is broken. If there is a little\nyard, grass grows between its stones; and the parapet of its wall is\ncrumbling away. If there is a garden, it is choked with nettles,\nbrambles, and hemlock, and strange insects abound in it. The chimneys\nare cracked, the roof is falling in; so much as can be seen from without\nof the rooms presents a dismantled appearance. The woodwork is rotten;\nthe stone mildewed. The paper of the walls has dropped away and hangs\nloose, until it presents a history of the bygone fashions of\npaper-hangings--the scrawling patterns of the time of the Empire, the\ncrescent-shaped draperies of the Directory, the balustrades and pillars\nof the days of Louis XVI. The thick draperies of cobwebs, filled with\nflies, indicate the quiet reign long enjoyed by innumerable spiders.\nSometimes a broken jug may be noticed on a shelf. Such houses are\nconsidered to be haunted. Satan is popularly believed to visit them by\nnight. Houses are like the human beings who inhabit them. They become to\ntheir former selves what the corpse is to the living body. A\nsuperstitious belief among the people is sufficient to reduce them to\nthis state of death. Then their aspect is terrible. These ghostly houses\nare common in the Channel Islands.\n\nThe rural and maritime populations are easily moved with notions of the\nactive agency of the powers of evil. Among the Channel Isles, and on the\nneighbouring coast of France, the ideas of the people on this subject\nare deeply rooted. In their view, Beelzebub has his ministers in all\nparts of the earth. It is certain that Belphegor is the ambassador from\nthe infernal regions in France, Hutgin in Italy, Belial in Turkey,\nThamuz in Spain, Martinet in Switzerland, and Mammon in England. Satan\nis an Emperor just like any other: a sort of Satan C\u00c3\u00a6sar. His\nestablishment is well organised. Dagon is grand almoner, Succor Benoth\nchief of the Eunuchs; Asmodeus, banker at the gaming-table; Kobal,\nmanager of the theatre, and Verdelet, grand-master of the ceremonies.\nNybbas is the court-fool; Wierus, a savant, a good strygologue, and a\nman of much learning in demonology, calls Nybbas the great parodist.\n\nThe Norman fishermen, who frequent the Channel, have many precautions to\ntake at sea, by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them.\nIt has long been an article of popular faith, that Saint Maclou\ninhabited the great square rock called Ortach, in the sea between\nAurigny and the Casquets; and many old sailors used to declare that they\nhad often seen him there, seated and reading in a book. Accordingly the\nsailors, as they passed, were in the habit of kneeling many times before\nthe Ortach rock, until the day when the fable was destroyed, and the\ntruth took its place. For it has been discovered, and is now well\nestablished, that the lonely inhabitant of the rock is not a saint, but\na devil. This evil spirit, whose name is Jochmus, had the impudence to\npass himself off, for many centuries, as Saint Maclou. Even the Church\nherself is not proof against snares of this kind. The demons Raguhel,\nOribel, and Tobiel, were regarded as saints until the year 745; when\nPope Zachary, having at length exposed them, turned them out of saintly\ncompany. This sort of weeding of the saintly calendar is certainly very\nuseful; but it can only be practised by very accomplished judges of\ndevils and their ways.\n\nThe old inhabitants of these parts relate--though all this refers to\nbygone times--that the Catholic population of the Norman Archipelago was\nonce, though quite involuntarily, even in more intimate correspondence\nwith the powers of darkness than the Huguenots themselves. How this\nhappened, however, we do not pretend to say; but it is certain that the\npeople suffered considerable annoyance from this cause. It appears that\nSatan had taken a fancy to the Catholics, and sought their company a\ngood deal; a circumstance which has given rise to the belief that the\ndevil is more Catholic than Protestant. One of his most insufferable\nfamiliarities consisted in paying nocturnal visits to married Catholics\nin bed, just at the moment when the husband had fallen fast asleep, and\nthe wife had begun to doze; a fruitful source of domestic trouble.\nPatouillet was of opinion that a faithful biography of Voltaire ought\nnot to be without some allusion to this practice of the evil one. The\ntruth of all this is perfectly well known, and described in the forms\nof excommunication in the rubric _de erroribus nocturnis et de semine\ndiabolorum_. The practice was raging particularly at St. Helier's\ntowards the end of the last century, probably as a punishment for the\nRevolution; for the evil consequences of revolutionary excesses are\nincalculable. However this may have been, it is certain that this\npossibility of a visit from the demon at night, when it is impossible to\nsee distinctly, or even in slumber, caused much embarrassment among\northodox dames. The idea of giving to the world a Voltaire was by no\nmeans a pleasant one. One of these, in some anxiety, consulted her\nconfessor on this extremely difficult subject, and the best mode for\ntimely discovery of the cheat. The confessor replied, \"In order to be\nsure that it is your husband by your side, and not a demon, place your\nhand upon his head. If you find horns, you may be sure there is\nsomething wrong.\" But this test was far from satisfactory to the worthy\ndame.\n\nGilliatt's house had been haunted, but it was no longer in that\ncondition; it was for that reason, however, only regarded with more\nsuspicion. No one learned in demonology can be unaware of the fact that,\nwhen a sorcerer has installed himself in a haunted dwelling, the devil\nconsiders the house sufficiently occupied, and is polite enough to\nabstain from visiting there, unless called in, like the doctor, on some\nspecial occasion.\n\nThis house was known by the name of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue. It was situated at\nthe extremity of a little promontory, rather of rock than of land,\nforming a small harbourage apart in the creek of Houmet Paradis. The\nwater at this spot is deep. The house stood quite alone upon the point,\nalmost separated from the island, and with just sufficient ground about\nit for a small garden, which was sometimes inundated by the high tides.\nBetween the port of St. Sampson and the creek of Houmet Paradis, rises a\nsteep hill, surmounted by the block of towers covered with ivy, and\nknown as Vale Castle, or the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de l'Archange; so that, at St.\nSampson, the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue was shut out from sight.\n\nNothing is commoner than sorcerers in Guernsey. They exercise their\nprofession in certain parishes, in profound indifference to the\nenlightenment of the nineteenth century. Some of their practices are\ndownright criminal. They set gold boiling, they gather herbs at\nmidnight, they cast sinister looks upon the people's cattle. When the\npeople consult them they send for bottles containing \"water of the\nsick,\" and they are heard to mutter mysteriously, \"the water has a sad\nlook.\" In March, 1857, one of them discovered, in water of this kind,\nseven demons. They are universally feared. Another only lately bewitched\na baker \"as well as his oven.\" Another had the diabolical wickedness to\nwafer and seal up envelopes \"containing nothing inside.\" Another went so\nfar as to have on a shelf three bottles labelled \"B.\" These monstrous\nfacts are well authenticated. Some of these sorcerers are obliging, and\nfor two or three guineas will take on themselves the complaint from\nwhich you are suffering. Then they are seen to roll upon their beds, and\nto groan with pain; and while they are in these agonies the believer\nexclaims, \"There! I am well again.\" Others cure all kinds of diseases,\nby merely tying a handkerchief round the patient's loins, a remedy so\nsimple that it is astonishing that no one had yet thought of it. In the\nlast century, the Cour Royale of Guernsey bound such folks upon a heap\nof fagots and burnt them alive. In these days it condemns them to eight\nweeks' imprisonment; four weeks on bread and water, and the remainder of\nthe term in solitary confinement. _Amant alterna caten\u00c3\u00a6._\n\nThe last instance of burning sorcerers in Guernsey took place in 1747.\nThe city authorities devoted one of its squares, the Carrefour du\nBordage, to that ceremony. Between 1565 and 1700, eleven sorcerers thus\nsuffered at this spot. As a rule the criminals made confession of their\nguilt. Torture was used to assist their confession. The Carrefour du\nBordage has indeed rendered many other services to society and religion.\nIt was here that heretics were brought to the stake. Under Queen Mary,\namong other Huguenots burnt here, were a mother and two daughters. The\nname of this mother was Perrotine Massy. One of the daughters was\n_enceinte_, and was delivered of a child even in the midst of the\nflames. As the old chronicle expresses it, \"_Son ventre \u00c3\u00a9clata_.\" The\nnew-born infant rolled out of the fiery furnace. A man named House took\nit in his arms; but Helier Gosselin the bailli, like a good Catholic as\nhe was, sternly commanded the child to be cast again into the fire.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nFOR YOUR WIFE: WHEN YOU MARRY\n\n\nWe must return to Gilliatt.\n\nThe country people told how, towards the close of the great Revolution,\na woman, bringing with her a little child, came to live in Guernsey. She\nwas English, or perhaps French. She had a name which the Guernsey\npronunciation and the country folks' bad spelling had finally converted\ninto \"Gilliatt.\" She lived alone with the child, which, according to\nsome, was a nephew; according to others, a son or grandson; according to\nothers, again, a strange child whom she was protecting. She had some\nmeans; enough to struggle on in a poor way. She had purchased a small\nplot of ground at La Sergent\u00c3\u00a9e, and another at La Roque Crespel, near\nRocquaine. The house of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue was haunted at this period. For\nmore than thirty years no one had inhabited it. It was falling into\nruins. The garden, so often invaded by the sea, could produce nothing.\nBesides noises and lights seen there at night-time, the house had this\nmysterious peculiarity: any one who should leave there in the evening,\nupon the mantelpiece, a ball of worsted, a few needles, and a plate\nfilled with soup, would assuredly find, in the morning, the soup\nconsumed, the plate empty, and a pair of mittens ready knitted. The\nhouse, demon included, was offered for sale for a few pounds sterling.\nThe stranger woman became the purchaser, evidently tempted by the devil,\nor by the advantageous bargain.\n\nShe did more than purchase the house; she took up her abode there with\nthe child; and from that moment peace reigned within its walls. The B\u00c3\u00bb\nde la Rue has found a fit tenant, said the country people. The haunting\nceased. There was no longer any light seen there, save that of the\ntallow candle of the new comer. \"Witch's candle is as good as devil's\ntorch.\" The proverb satisfied the gossips of the neighbourhood.\n\nThe woman cultivated some acres of land which belonged to her. She had a\ngood cow, of the sort which produces yellow butter. She gathered her\nwhite beans, cauliflowers, and \"Golden drop\" potatoes. She sold, like\nother people, her parsnips by the tonneau, her onions by the hundred,\nand her beans by the denerel. She did not go herself to market, but\ndisposed of her crops through the agency of Guilbert Falliot, at the\nsign of the Abreveurs of St. Sampson. The register of Falliot bears\nevidence that Falliot sold for her, on one occasion, as much as twelve\nbushels of rare early potatoes.\n\nThe house had been meanly repaired; but sufficiently to make it\nhabitable. It was only in very bad weather that the rain-drops found\ntheir way through the ceilings of the rooms. The interior consisted of a\nground-floor suite of rooms, and a granary overhead. The ground-floor\nwas divided into three rooms; two for sleeping, and one for meals. A\nladder connected it with the granary above. The woman attended to the\nkitchen and taught the child to read. She did not go to church or\nchapel, which, all things considered, led to the conclusion that she\nmust be French not to go to a place of worship. The circumstance was\ngrave. In short, the new comers were a puzzle to the neighbourhood.\n\nThat the woman was French seemed probable. Volcanoes cast forth stones,\nand revolutions men, so families are removed to distant places; human\nbeings come to pass their lives far from their native homes; groups of\nrelatives and friends disperse and decay; strange people fall, as it\nwere, from the clouds--some in Germany, some in England, some in\nAmerica. The people of the country view them with surprise and\ncuriosity. Whence come these strange faces? Yonder mountain, smoking\nwith revolutionary fires, casts them out. These barren a\u00c3\u00abrolites, these\nfamished and ruined people, these footballs of destiny, are known as\nrefugees, \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s, adventurers. If they sojourn among strangers, they\nare tolerated; if they depart, there is a feeling of relief. Sometimes\nthese wanderers are harmless, inoffensive people, strangers--at least,\nas regards the women--to the events which have led to their exile,\nobjects of persecution, helpless and astonished at their fate. They take\nroot again somewhere as they can. They have done no harm to any one, and\nscarcely comprehend the destiny that has befallen them. So thus I have\nseen a poor tuft of grass uprooted and carried away by the explosion of\na mine. No great explosion was ever followed by more of such strays than\nthe first French Revolution.\n\nThe strange woman whom the Guernsey folks called \"Gilliatt\" was,\npossibly, one of these human strays.\n\nThe woman grew older; the child became a youth. They lived alone and\navoided by all; but they were sufficient for each other. _Louve et\nlouveteau se pourl\u00c3\u00a8chent._ This was another of the generous proverbs\nwhich the neighbourhood applied to them. Meanwhile, the youth grew to\nmanhood; and then, as the old and withered bark falls from the tree,\nthe mother died. She left to her son the little field of Sergent\u00c3\u00a9e, the\nsmall property called La Roque Crespel, and the house known as the B\u00c3\u00bb de\nla Rue; with the addition, as the official inventory said, of \"one\nhundred guineas in gold in the _pid d'une cauche_,\" that is to say, in\nthe foot of a stocking. The house was already sufficiently furnished\nwith two oaken chests, two beds, six chairs and a table, besides\nnecessary household utensils. Upon a shelf were some books, and in the\ncorner a trunk, by no means of a mysterious character, which had to be\nopened for the inventory. This trunk was of drab leather, ornamented\nwith brass nails and little stars of white metal, and it contained a\nbride's outfit, new and complete, of beautiful Dunkirk linen--chemises\nand petticoats, and some silk dresses--with a paper on which was\nwritten, in the handwriting of the deceased,--\n\n\"For your wife: when you marry.\"\n\nThe loss of his mother was a terrible blow for the young man. His\ndisposition had always been unsociable; he became now moody and sullen.\nThe solitude around him was complete. Hitherto it had been mere\nisolation; now his life was a blank. While we have only one companion,\nlife is endurable; left alone, it seems as if it is impossible to\nstruggle on, and we fall back in the race, which is the first sign of\ndespair. As time rolls on, however, we discover that duty is a series of\ncompromises; we contemplate life, regard its end, and submit; but it is\na submission which makes the heart bleed.\n\nGilliatt was young; and his wound healed with time. At that age sorrows\ncannot be lasting. His sadness, disappearing by slow degrees, seemed to\nmingle itself with the scenes around him, to draw him more and more\ntowards the face of nature, and further and further from the need of\nsocial converse; and, finally, to assimilate his spirit more completely\nto the solitude in which he lived.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAN UNPOPULAR MAN\n\n\nGilliatt, as we have said, was not popular in the parish. Nothing could\nbe more natural than that antipathy among his neighbours. The reasons\nfor it were abundant. To begin with, as we have already explained, there\nwas the strange house he lived in; then there was his mysterious origin.\nWho could that woman have been? and what was the meaning of this child?\nCountry people do not like mysteries, when they relate to strange\nsojourners among them. Then his clothes were the clothes of a workman,\nwhile he had, although certainly not rich, sufficient to live without\nlabour. Then there was his garden, which he succeeded in cultivating,\nand from which he produced crops of potatoes, in spite of the stormy\nequinoxes; and then there were the big books which he kept upon a shelf,\nand read from time to time.\n\nMore reasons: why did he live that solitary life? The B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue was a\nkind of lazaretto, in which Gilliatt was kept in a sort of moral\nquarantine. This, in the popular judgment, made it quite simple that\npeople should be astonished at his isolation, and should hold him\nresponsible for the solitude which society had made around his home.\n\nHe never went to chapel. He often went out at night-time. He held\nconverse with sorcerers. He had been seen, on one occasion, sitting on\nthe grass with an expression of astonishment on his features. He haunted\nthe druidical stones of the Ancresse, and the fairy caverns which are\nscattered about in that part. It was generally believed that he had been\nseen politely saluting the Roque qui Chante, or Crowing Rock. He bought\nall birds which people brought to him, and having bought them, set them\nat liberty. He was civil to the worthy folks in the streets of St.\nSampson, but willingly turned out of his way to avoid them if he could.\nHe often went out on fishing expeditions, and always returned with fish.\nHe trimmed his garden on Sundays. He had a bagpipe which he had bought\nfrom one of the Highland soldiers who are sometimes in Guernsey, and on\nwhich he played occasionally at twilight, on the rocks by the seashore.\nHe had been seen to make strange gestures, like those of one sowing\nseeds. What kind of treatment could be expected for a man like that?\n\nAs regards the books left by the deceased woman, which he was in the\nhabit of reading, the neighbours were particularly suspicious. The\nReverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode, rector of St. Sampson, when he visited the\nhouse at the time of the woman's funeral, had read on the backs of these\nbooks the titles _Rosier's Dictionary_, _Candide_, by Voltaire, _Advice\nto the People on Health_, by Tissot. A French noble, an \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9, who had\nretired to St. Sampson, remarked that this Tissot, \"must have been the\nTissot who carried the head of the Princess de Lamballe upon a pike.\"\n\nThe Reverend gentleman had also remarked upon one of these books, the\nhighly fantastic and terribly significant title, _De Rhubarbaro_.\n\nIn justice to Gilliatt, however, it must be added that this volume being\nin Latin--a language which it is doubtful if he understood--the young\nman had possibly never read it.\n\nBut it is just those books which a man possesses, but does not read,\nwhich constitute the most suspicious evidence against him. The Spanish\nInquisition have deliberated on that point, and have come to a\nconclusion which places the matter beyond further doubt.\n\nThe book in question, however, was no other than the treatise of Doctor\nTilingius upon the rhubarb plant, published in Germany in 1679.\n\nIt was by no means certain that Gilliatt did not prepare philters and\nunholy decoctions. He was undoubtedly in possession of certain phials.\n\nWhy did he walk abroad at evening, and sometimes even at midnight, on\nthe cliffs? Evidently to hold converse with the evil spirits who, by\nnight, frequent the seashores, enveloped in smoke.\n\nOn one occasion he had aided a witch at Torteval to clean her chaise:\nthis was an old woman named Moutonne Gahy.\n\nWhen a census was taken in the island, in answer to a question about his\ncalling, he replied, \"Fisherman; when there are fish to catch.\" Imagine\nyourself in the place of Gilliatt's neighbours, and admit that there is\nsomething unpleasant in answers like this.\n\nPoverty and wealth are comparative terms. Gilliatt had some fields and a\nhouse, his own property; compared with those who had nothing, he was not\npoor. One day, to test this, and perhaps, also as a step towards a\ncorrespondence--for there are base women who would marry a demon for the\nsake of riches--a young girl of the neighbourhood said to Gilliatt,\n\"When are you going to take a wife, neighbour?\" He answered, \"I will\ntake a wife when the Roque qui Chante takes a husband.\"\n\nThis Roque qui Chante is a great stone, standing in a field near Mons.\nLem\u00c3\u00a9zurier de Fry's. It is a stone of a highly suspicious character. No\none knows what deeds are done around it. At times you may hear there a\ncock crowing, when no cock is near--an extremely disagreeable\ncircumstance. Then it is commonly asserted that this stone was\noriginally placed in the field by the elfin people known as\n_Sarregousets_, who are the same as the _Sins_.\n\nAt night, when it thunders, if you should happen to see men flying in\nthe lurid light of the clouds, or on the rolling waves of the air, these\nare no other than the Sarregousets. A woman who lives at the Grand\nMielles knows them well. One evening, when some Sarregousets happened to\nbe assembled at a crossroad, this woman cried out to a man with a cart,\nwho did not know which route to take, \"Ask them your way. They are civil\nfolks, and always ready to direct a stranger.\" There can be little doubt\nthat this woman was a sorceress.\n\nThe learned and judicious King James I. had women of this kind boiled,\nand then tasting the water of the cauldron, was able to say from its\nflavour, \"That was a sorceress;\" or \"That was not one.\"\n\nIt is to be regretted that the kings of these latter days no longer\npossess a talent which placed in so strong a light the utility of\nmonarchical institutions.\n\nIt was not without substantial grounds that Gilliatt lived in this odour\nof sorcery. One midnight, during a storm, Gilliatt being at sea alone in\na bark, on the coast by La Sommeilleuse, he was heard to ask--\n\n\"Is there a passage sufficient for me?\"\n\nAnd a voice cried from the heights above:\n\n\"Passage enough: steer boldly.\"\n\nTo whom could he have been speaking, if not to those who replied to him?\nThis seems something like evidence.\n\nAnother time, one stormy evening, when it was so dark that nothing could\nbe distinguished, Gilliatt was near the Catiau Roque--a double row of\nrocks where witches, goats, and other diabolical creatures assemble and\ndance on Fridays--and here, it is firmly believed, that the voice of\nGilliatt was heard mingling in the following terrible conversation:--\n\n\"How is Vesin Brovard?\" (This was a mason who had fallen from the roof\nof a house.)\n\n\"He is getting better.\"\n\n\"Ver dia! he fell from a greater height than that of yonder peak. It is\ndelightful to think that he was not dashed to pieces.\"\n\n\"Our folks had a fine time for the seaweed gathering last week.\"\n\n\"Ay, finer than to-day.\"\n\n\"I believe you. There will be little fish at the market to-day.\"\n\n\"It blows too hard.\"\n\n\"They can't lower their nets.\"\n\n\"How is Catherine?\"\n\n\"She is charming.\"\n\nCatherine was evidently the name of a Sarregouset.\n\nAccording to all appearance, Gilliatt had business on hand at night: at\nleast none doubted it.\n\nSometimes he was seen with a pitcher in his hand, pouring water on the\nground. Now water, cast upon the ground, is known to make a shape like\nthat of devils.\n\nOn the road to St. Sampson, opposite the Martello tower, number 1, stand\nthree stones, arranged in the form of steps. Upon the platform of those\nstones, now empty, stood anciently a cross, or perhaps a gallows. These\nstones are full of evil influences.\n\nStaid and worthy people, and perfectly credible witnesses, testified to\nhaving seen Gilliatt at this spot conversing with a toad. Now there are\nno toads at Guernsey. The share of Guernsey in the reptiles of the\nChannel Isles consisting exclusively of the snakes. It is Jersey that\nhas all the toads. This toad, then, must have swum from the neighbouring\nisland, in order to hold converse with Gilliatt. The converse was of a\nfriendly kind.\n\nThese facts were clearly established; and the proof is that the three\nstones are there to this day. Those who doubt it may go and see them;\nand at a little distance, there is also a house on which the passer-by\nmay read this inscription:--\n\n\"DEALER IN CATTLE, ALIVE AND DEAD, OLD CORDAGE, IRON, BONES, AND TOBACCO\nFOR CHEWING, PROMPT PAYMENT FOR GOODS, AND EVERY ATTENTION GIVEN TO\nORDERS.\"\n\nA man must be sceptical indeed to contest the existence of those stones,\nand of the house in question. Now both these circumstances were\ninjurious to the reputation of Gilliatt.\n\nOnly the most ignorant are unaware of the fact that the greatest danger\nof the coasts of the Channel Islands is the King of the Auxcriniers. No\ninhabitant of the seas is more redoubtable. Whoever has seen him is\ncertain to be wrecked between one St. Michel and the other. He is\nlittle, being in fact a dwarf; and is deaf, in his quality of king. He\nknows the names of all those who have been drowned in the seas, and the\nspots where they lie. He has a profound knowledge of that great\ngraveyard which stretches far and wide beneath the waters of the ocean.\nA head, massive in the lower part and narrow in the forehead; a squat\nand corpulent figure; a skull, covered with warty excrescences; long\nlegs, long arms, fins for feet, claws for hands, and a sea-green\ncountenance; such are the chief characteristics of this king of the\nwaves. His claws have palms like hands; his fins human nails. Imagine a\nspectral fish with the face of a human being. No power could check his\ncareer unless he could be exorcised, or mayhap, fished up from the sea.\nMeanwhile he continues his sinister operations. Nothing is more\nunpleasant than an interview with this monster: amid the rolling waves\nand breakers, or in the thick of the mist, the sailor perceives,\nsometimes, a strange creature with a beetle brow, wide nostrils,\nflattened ears, an enormous mouth, gap-toothed jaws, peaked eyebrows,\nand great grinning eyes. When the lightning is livid, he appears red;\nwhen it is purple, he looks wan. He has a stiff spreading beard, running\nwith water, and overlapping a sort of pelerine, ornamented with fourteen\nshells, seven before and seven behind. These shells are curious to those\nwho are learned in conchology. The King of the Auxcriniers is only seen\nin stormy seas. He is the terrible harbinger of the tempest. His hideous\nform traces itself in the fog, in the squall, in the tempest of rain.\nHis breast is hideous. A coat of scales covers his sides like a vest. He\nrises above the waves which fly before the wind, twisting and curling\nlike thin shavings of wood beneath the carpenter's plane. Then his\nentire form issues out of the foam, and if there should happen to be in\nthe horizon any vessels in distress, pale in the twilight, or his face\nlighted up with a sinister smile, he dances terrible and uncouth to\nbehold. It is an evil omen indeed to meet him on a voyage.\n\nAt the period when the people of St. Sampson were particularly excited\non the subject of Gilliatt, the last persons who had seen the King of\nthe Auxcriniers declared that his pelerine was now ornamented with only\nthirteen shells. Thirteen! He was only the more dangerous. But what had\nbecome of the fourteenth? Had he given it to some one? No one would say\npositively; and folks confined themselves to conjecture. But it was an\nundoubted fact that a certain Mons. Lupin Mabier, of Godaines, a man of\nproperty, paying a good sum to the land tax, was ready to depose on\noath, that he had once seen in the hands of Gilliatt a very remarkable\nkind of shell.\n\nIt was not uncommon to hear dialogues like the following among the\ncountry people:--\n\n\"I have a fine bull here, neighbour, what do you say?\"\n\n\"Very fine, neighbour?\"\n\n\"It is a fact, tho' 'tis I who say it; he is better though for tallow\nthan for meat.\"\n\n\"Ver dia!\"\n\n\"Are you sure that Gilliatt hasn't cast his eye upon it?\"\n\nGilliatt would stop sometimes beside a field where some labourers were\nassembled, or near gardens in which gardeners were engaged, and would\nperhaps hear these mysterious words:\n\n\"When the _mors du diable_ flourishes, reap the winter rye.\"\n\n(The _mors du diable_ is the scabwort plant.)\n\n\"The ash tree is coming out in leaf. There will be no more frost.\"\n\n\"Summer solstice, thistle in flower.\"\n\n\"If it rain not in June, the wheat will turn white. Look out for\nmildew.\"\n\n\"When the wild cherry appears, beware of the full moon.\"\n\n\"If the weather on the sixth day of the new moon is like that of the\nfourth, or like that of the fifth day, it will be the same nine times\nout of twelve, in the first case, and eleven times out of twelve in the\nsecond, during the whole month.\"\n\n\"Keep your eye on neighbours who go to law with you. Beware of malicious\ninfluences. A pig which has had warm milk given to it will die. A cow\nwhich has had its teeth rubbed with leeks will eat no more.\"\n\n\"Spawning time with the smelts; beware of fevers.\"\n\n\"When frogs begin to appear, sow your melons.\"\n\n\"When the liverwort flowers, sow your barley.\"\n\n\"When the limes are in bloom, mow the meadows.\"\n\n\"When the elm-tree flowers, open the hot-bed frames.\"\n\n\"When tobacco fields are in blossom, close your greenhouses.\"\n\nAnd, fearful to relate, these occult precepts were not without truth.\nThose who put faith in them could vouch for the fact.\n\nOne night, in the month of June, when Gilliatt was playing upon his\nbagpipe, upon the sand-hills on the shore of the Demie de Fontenelle, it\nhad happened that the mackerel fishing had failed.\n\nOne evening, at low water, it came to pass that a cart filled with\nseaweed for manure overturned on the beach, in front of Gilliatt's\nhouse. It is most probable that he was afraid of being brought before\nthe magistrates, for he took considerable trouble in helping to raise\nthe cart, and he filled it again himself.\n\nA little neglected child of the neighbourhood being troubled with\nvermin, he had gone himself to St. Peter's Port, and had returned with\nan ointment, with which he rubbed the child's head. Thus Gilliatt had\nremoved the pest from the poor child, which was an evidence that\nGilliatt himself had originally given it; for everybody knows that there\nis a certain charm for giving vermin to people.\n\nGilliatt was suspected of looking into wells--a dangerous practice with\nthose who have an evil eye; and, in fact, at Arculons, near St. Peter's\nPort, the water of a well became unwholesome. The good woman to whom\nthis well belonged said to Gilliatt:\n\n\"Look here, at this water;\" and she showed him a glassful. Gilliatt\nacknowledged it.\n\n\"The water is thick,\" he said; \"that is true.\"\n\nThe good woman, who dreaded him in her heart, said, \"Make it sweet again\nfor me.\"\n\nGilliatt asked her some questions: whether she had a stable? whether the\nstable had a drain? whether the gutter of the drain did not pass near\nthe well? The good woman replied \"Yes.\" Gilliatt went into the stable;\nworked at the drain; turned the gutter in another direction; and the\nwater became pure again. People in the country round might think what\nthey pleased. A well does not become foul one moment and sweet the next\nwithout good cause; the bottom of the affair was involved in obscurity;\nand, in short, it was difficult to escape the conclusion that Gilliatt\nhimself had bewitched the water.\n\nOn one occasion, when he went to Jersey, it was remarked that he had\ntaken a lodging in the street called the Rue des Alleurs. Now the word\n_alleurs_ signifies spirits from the other world.\n\nIn villages it is the custom to gather together all these little hints\nand indications of a man's career; and when they are gathered together,\nthe total constitutes his reputation among the inhabitants.\n\nIt happened that Gilliatt was once caught with blood issuing from his\nnose. The circumstances appeared grave. The master of a barque who had\nsailed almost entirely round the world, affirmed that among the\nTongusians all sorcerers were subject to bleeding at the nose. In fact,\nwhen you see a man in those parts bleeding at the nose, you know at once\nwhat is in the wind. Moderate reasoners, however, remarked that the\ncharacteristics of sorcerers among the Tongusians may possibly not apply\nin the same degree to the sorcerers of Guernsey.\n\nIn the environs of one of the St. Michels, he had been seen to stop in a\nclose belonging to the Huriaux, skirting the highway from the Videclins.\nHe whistled in the field, and a moment afterwards a crow alighted there;\na moment later, a magpie. The fact was attested by a worthy man who has\nsince been appointed to the office of Douzenier of the Douzaine, as\nthose are called who are authorised to make a new survey and register of\nthe fief of the king.\n\nAt Hamel, in the Vingtaine of L'Epine, there lived some old women who\nwere positive of having heard one morning a number of swallows\ndistinctly calling \"Gilliatt.\"\n\nAdd to all this that he was of a malicious temper.\n\nOne day, a poor man was beating an ass. The ass was obstinate. The poor\nman gave him a few kicks in the belly with his wooden shoe, and the ass\nfell. Gilliatt ran to raise the unlucky beast, but he was dead. Upon\nthis Gilliatt administered to the poor man a sound thrashing.\n\nAnother day, Gilliatt seeing a boy come down from a tree with a brood of\nlittle birds, newly hatched and unfledged, he took the brood away from\nthe boy, and carried his malevolence so far as even to take them back\nand replace them in the tree.\n\nSome passers-by took up the boy's complaint; but Gilliatt made no reply,\nexcept to point to the old birds, who were hovering and crying\nplaintively over the tree, as they looked for their nest. He had a\nweakness for birds--another sign by which the people recognise a\nmagician.\n\nChildren take a pleasure in robbing the nests of birds along the cliff.\nThey bring home quantities of yellow, blue, and green eggs, with which\nthey make rosaries for mantelpiece ornaments. As the cliffs are peaked,\nthey sometimes slip and are killed. Nothing is prettier than shutters\ndecorated with sea-birds' eggs. Gilliatt's mischievous ingenuity had no\nend. He would climb, at the peril of his own life, into the steep places\nof the sea rocks, and hang up bundles of hay, old hats, and all kinds of\nscarecrows, to deter the birds from building there, and, as a\nconsequence, to prevent the children from visiting those spots.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why Gilliatt was disliked throughout the\ncountry. Perhaps nothing less could have been expected.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nMORE SUSPICIOUS FACTS ABOUT GILLIATT\n\n\nPublic opinion was not yet quite settled with regard to Gilliatt.\n\nIn general he was regarded as a _Marcou_: some went so far as to believe\nhim to be a _Cambion_. A cambion is the child of a woman begotten by a\ndevil.\n\nWhen a woman bears to her husband seven male children consecutively, the\nseventh is a marcou. But the series must not be broken by the birth of\nany female child.\n\nThe marcou has a natural fleur-de-lys imprinted upon some part of his\nbody; for which reason he has the power of curing scrofula, exactly the\nsame as the King of France. Marcous are found in all parts of France,\nbut particularly in the Orl\u00c3\u00a9anais. Every village of G\u00c3\u00a2tinais has its\nmarcou. It is sufficient for the cure of the sick that the marcou should\nbreathe upon their wounds, or let them touch his fleur-de-lys. The night\nof Good Friday is particularly favourable to these ceremonies. Ten years\nago there lived, at Ormes in G\u00c3\u00a2tinais, one of these creatures who was\nnicknamed the Beau Marcou, and consulted by all the country of Beauce.\nHe was a cooper, named Foulon, who kept a horse and vehicle. To put a\nstop to his miracles, it was found necessary to call in the assistance\nof the gendarmes. His fleur-de-lys was on the left breast; other marcous\nhave it in different parts.\n\nThere are marcous at Jersey, Auvigny, and at Guernsey. This fact is\ndoubtless in some way connected with the rights possessed by France over\nNormandy: or why the fleur-de-lys?\n\nThere are also, in the Channel Islands, people afflicted with scrofula;\nwhich of course necessitates a due supply of these marcous.\n\nSome people, who happened to be present one day when Gilliatt was\nbathing in the sea, had fancied that they could perceive upon him a\nfleur-de-lys. Interrogated on that subject he made no reply, but merely\nburst into laughter. For he laughed sometimes like other men. From that\ntime, however, no one ever saw him bathe: he bathed thenceforth only in\nperilous and solitary places; probably by moonlight: a thing in itself\nsomewhat suspicious.\n\nThose who obstinately regarded him as a cambion, or son of the devil,\nwere evidently in error. They ought to have known that cambions\nscarcely exist out of Germany. But The Vale and St. Sampson were, fifty\nyears ago, places remarkable for the ignorance of their inhabitants.\n\nTo fancy that a resident of the island of Guernsey could be the son of a\ndevil was evidently absurd.\n\nGilliatt, for the very reason that he caused disquietude among the\npeople, was sought for and consulted. The peasants came in fear, to talk\nto him of their diseases. That fear itself had in it something of faith\nin his powers; for in the country, the more the doctor is suspected of\nmagic, the more certain is the cure. Gilliatt had certain remedies of\nhis own, which he had inherited from the deceased woman. He communicated\nthem to all who had need of them, and would never receive money for\nthem. He cured whitlows with applications of herbs. A liquor in one of\nhis phials allayed fever. The chemist of St. Sampson, or _pharmacien_,\nas they would call him in France, thought that this was probably a\ndecoction of Jesuits' bark. The more generous among his censors admitted\nthat Gilliatt was not so bad a demon in his dealings with the sick, so\nfar as regarded his ordinary remedies. But in his character of a marcou,\nhe would do nothing. If persons afflicted with scrofula came to him to\nask to touch the fleur-de-lys on his skin, he made no other answer than\nthat of shutting the door in their faces. He persistently refused to\nperform any miracles--a ridiculous position for a sorcerer. No one is\nbound to be a sorcerer; but when a man is one, he ought not to shirk the\nduties of his position.\n\nOne or two exceptions might be found to this almost universal antipathy.\nSieur Landoys, of the Clos-Land\u00c3\u00a9s, was clerk and registrar of St.\nPeter's Port, custodian of the documents, and keeper of the register of\nbirths, marriages, and deaths. This Landoys was vain of his descent from\nPeter Landoys, treasurer of the province of Brittany, who was hanged in\n1485. One day, when Sieur Landoys was bathing in the sea, he ventured to\nswim out too far, and was on the point of drowning: Gilliatt plunged\ninto the water, narrowly escaping drowning himself, and succeeded in\nsaving him. From that day Landoys never spoke an evil word of Gilliatt.\nTo those who expressed surprise at this change, he replied, \"Why should\nI detest a man who never did me any harm, and who has rendered me a\nservice?\" The parish clerk and registrar even came at last to feel a\nsort of friendship for Gilliatt. This public functionary was a man\nwithout prejudices. He had no faith in sorcerers. He laughed at people\nwho went in fear of ghostly visitors. As for him, he had a boat in\nwhich he amused himself by making fishing excursions in his leisure\nhours; but he had never seen anything extraordinary, unless it was on\none occasion--a woman clothed in white, who rose about the waters in\nthe light of the moon--and even of this circumstance he was not quite\nsure. Moutonne Gahy, the old witch of Torteval, had given him a little\nbag to be worn under the cravat, as a protection against evil spirits:\nhe ridiculed the bag, and knew not what it contained, though, to be\nsure, he carried it about him, feeling more security with this charm\nhanging on his neck.\n\nSome courageous persons, emboldened by the example of Landoys, ventured\nto cite, in Gilliatt's favour, certain extenuating circumstances; a few\nsigns of good qualities, as his sobriety, his abstinence from spirits\nand tobacco; and sometimes they went so far as to pass this elegant\neulogium upon him: \"He neither smokes, drinks, chews tobacco, or takes\nsnuff.\"\n\nSobriety, however, can only count as a virtue when there are other\nvirtues to support it.\n\nThe ban of public opinion lay heavily upon Gilliatt.\n\nIn any case, as a marcou, Gilliatt had it in his power to render great\nservices. On a certain Good Friday, at midnight, a day and an hour\npropitious to this kind of cure, all the scrofulous people of the\nisland, either by sudden inspiration, or by concerted action, presented\nthemselves in a crowd at the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue, and with pitiable sores and\nimploring gestures, called on Gilliatt to make them clean. But he\nrefused; and herein the people found another proof of his malevolence.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE DUTCH SLOOP\n\n\nSuch was the character of Gilliatt.\n\nThe young women considered him ugly.\n\nUgly he was not. He might, perhaps, have been called handsome. There was\nsomething in his profile of rude but antique grace. In repose it had\nsome resemblance to that of a sculptured Dacian on the Trajan column.\nHis ears were small, delicate, without lobes, and of an admirable form\nfor hearing. Between his eyes he had that proud vertical line which\nindicates in a man boldness and perseverance. The corners of his mouth\nwere depressed, giving a slight expression of bitterness. His forehead\nhad a calm and noble roundness. The clear pupils of his eyes possessed a\nsteadfast look, although troubled a little with that involuntary\nmovement of the eyelids which fishermen contract from the glitter of the\nwaves. His laugh was boyish and pleasing. No ivory could be of a finer\nwhite than his teeth; but exposure to the sun had made him swarthy as a\nmoor. The ocean, the tempest, and the darkness cannot be braved with\nimpunity. At thirty he looked already like a man of forty-five. He wore\nthe sombre mask of the wind and the sea.\n\nThe people had nicknamed him \"Malicious Gilliatt.\"\n\nThere is an Indian fable to the effect that one day the god Brahma\ninquired of the Spirit of Power, \"Who is stronger than thee?\" and the\nspirit replied \"Cunning.\" A Chinese proverb says, \"What could not the\nlion do, if he was the monkey also?\" Gilliatt was neither the lion nor\nthe monkey; but his actions gave some evidence of the truth of the\nChinese proverb, and of the Hindoo fable. Although only of ordinary\nheight and strength, he was enabled, so inventive and powerful was his\ndexterity, to lift burdens that might have taxed a giant, and to\naccomplish feats which would have done credit to an athlete.\n\nHe had in him something of the power of the gymnast. He used, with equal\naddress, his left hand and his right.\n\nHe never carried a gun; but was often seen with his net. He spared the\nbirds, but not the fish. Ill-luck to these dumb creatures! He was an\nexcellent swimmer.\n\nSolitude either develops the mental powers, or renders men dull and\nvicious. Gilliatt sometimes presented himself under both these aspects.\nAt times, when his features wore that air of strange surprise already\nmentioned, he might have been taken for a man of mental powers scarcely\nsuperior to the savage. At other moments an indescribable air of\npenetration lighted up his face. Ancient Chaldea possessed some men of\nthis stamp. At certain times the dullness of the shepherd mind became\ntransparent, and revealed the inspired sage.\n\nAfter all, he was but a poor man; uninstructed, save to the extent of\nreading and writing. It is probable that the condition of his mind was\nat that limit which separates the dreamer from the thinker. The thinker\nwills, the dreamer is a passive instrument. Solitude sinks deeply into\npure natures, and modifies them in a certain degree. They become,\nunconsciously, penetrated with a kind of sacred awe. The shadow in which\nthe mind of Gilliatt constantly dwelt was composed in almost equal\ndegrees of two elements, both obscure, but very different. Within\nhimself all was ignorance and weakness; without, infinity and mysterious\npower.\n\nBy dint of frequent climbing on the rocks, of escalading the rugged\ncliffs, of going to and fro among the islands in all weathers, of\nnavigating any sort of craft which came to hand, of venturing night and\nday in difficult channels, he had become, without taking count of his\nother advantages, and merely in following his fancy and pleasure, a\nseaman of extraordinary skill.\n\nHe was a born pilot. The true pilot is the man who navigates the bed of\nthe ocean even more than its surface. The waves of the sea are an\nexternal problem, continually modified by the submarine conditions of\nthe waters in which the vessel is making her way. To see Gilliatt\nguiding his craft among the reefs and shallows of the Norman\nArchipelago, one might have fancied that he carried in his head a plan\nof the bottom of the sea. He was familiar with it all, and feared\nnothing.\n\nHe was better acquainted with the buoys in the channels than the\ncormorants who make them their resting-places. The almost imperceptible\ndifferences which distinguish the four upright buoys of the Creux,\nAlligande, the Tr\u00c3\u00a9mies, and the Sardrette, were perfectly visible and\nclear to him, even in misty weather. He hesitated neither at the oval,\napple-headed buoy of Anfr\u00c3\u00a9, nor at the triple iron point of the Rousse,\nnor at the white ball of the Corbette, nor at the black ball of Longue\nPierre; and there was no fear of his confounding the cross of Goubeau\nwith the sword planted in earth at La Platte, nor the hammer-shaped buoy\nof the Barb\u00c3\u00a9es with the curled-tail buoy of the Moulinet.\n\nHis rare skill in seamanship showed itself in a striking manner one day\nat Guernsey, on the occasion of one of those sea tournaments which are\ncalled regattas. The feat to be performed was to navigate alone a boat\nwith four sails from St. Sampson to the Isle of Herm, at one league\ndistance, and to bring the boat back from Herm to St. Sampson. To\nmanage, without assistance, a boat with four sails, is a feat which\nevery fisherman is equal to, and the difficulty seemed little; but there\nwas a condition which rendered it far from simple. The boat, to begin\nwith, was one of those large and heavy sloops of bygone times which the\nsailors of the last century knew by the name of \"Dutch Belly Boats.\"\nThis ancient style of flat, pot-bellied craft, carrying on the larboard\nand starboard sides, in compensation for the want of a keel, two wings,\nwhich lowered themselves, sometimes the one, sometimes the other,\naccording to the wind, may occasionally be met with still at sea. In the\nsecond place, there was the return from Herm, a journey which was\nrendered more difficult by a heavy ballasting of stones. The conditions\nwere to go empty, but to return loaded. The sloop was the prize of the\ncontest. It was dedicated beforehand to the winner. This \"Dutch Belly\nBoat\" had been employed as a pilot-boat. The pilot who had rigged and\nworked it for twenty years was the most robust of all the sailors of the\nchannel. When he died no one had been found capable of managing the\nsloop; and it was, in consequence, determined to make it the prize of\nthe regatta. The sloop, though not decked, had some sea qualities, and\nwas a tempting prize for a skilful sailor. Her mast was somewhat\nforward, which increased the motive-power of her sails; besides having\nthe advantage of not being in the way of her pilot. It was a\nstrong-built vessel, heavy, but roomy, and taking the open sea well; in\nfact, a good, serviceable craft. There was eager anxiety for the prize;\nthe task was a rough one, but the reward of success was worth having.\nSeven or eight fishermen, among the most vigorous of the island,\npresented themselves. One by one they essayed; but not one could succeed\nin reaching Herm. The last one who tried his skill was known for having\ncrossed, in a rowing-boat, the terrible narrow sea between Sark and\nBrecq-Hou. Sweating with his exertions, he brought back the sloop, and\nsaid, \"It is impossible.\" Gilliatt then entered the bark, seized first\nof all the oar, then the mainsail, and pushed out to sea. Then, without\neither making fast the boom, which would have been imprudent, or letting\nit go, which kept the sail under his direction, and leaving the boom to\nmove with the wind without drifting, he held the tiller with his left\nhand. In three quarters of an hour he was at Herm. Three hours later,\nalthough a strong breeze had sprung up and was blowing across the roads,\nthe sloop, guided by Gilliatt, returned to St. Sampson with its load of\nstones. He had, with an extravagant display of his resources, even added\nto the cargo the little bronze cannon at Herm, which the people were in\nthe habit of firing off on the 5th of November, by way of rejoicing over\nthe death of Guy Fawkes.\n\nGuy Fawkes, by the way, has been dead two hundred and sixty years; a\nremarkably long period of rejoicing.\n\nGilliatt, thus burdened and encumbered, although he had the Guy\nFawkes'-day cannon in the boat and the south wind in his sails,\nsteered, or rather brought back, the heavy craft to St. Sampson.\n\nSeeing which, Mess Lethierry exclaimed, \"There's a bold sailor for you!\"\n\nAnd he held out his hand to Gilliatt.\n\nWe shall have occasion to speak again of Mess Lethierry.\n\nThe sloop was awarded to Gilliatt.\n\nThis adventure detracted nothing from his evil reputation.\n\nSeveral persons declared that the feat was not at all astonishing, for\nthat Gilliatt had concealed in the boat a branch of wild medlar. But\nthis could not be proved.\n\nFrom that day forward, Gilliatt navigated no boat except the old sloop.\nIn this heavy craft he went on his fishing avocation. He kept it at\nanchor in the excellent little shelter which he had all to himself,\nunder the very wall of his house of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue. At nightfall, he\ncast his nets over his shoulder, traversed his little garden, climbed\nover the parapet of dry stones, stepped lightly from rock to rock, and\njumping into the sloop, pushed out to sea.\n\nHe brought home heavy takes of fish; but people said that his medlar\nbranch was always hanging up in the boat. No one had ever seen this\nbranch, but every one believed in its existence.\n\nWhen he had more fish than he wanted, he did not sell it, but gave it\naway.\n\nThe poor people took his gift, but were little grateful, for they knew\nthe secret of his medlar branch. Such devices cannot be permitted. It is\nunlawful to trick the sea out of its treasures.\n\nHe was a fisherman; but he was something more. He had, by instinct, or\nfor amusement, acquired a knowledge of three or four trades. He was a\ncarpenter, worker in iron, wheelwright, boat-caulker, and, to some\nextent, an engineer. No one could mend a broken wheel better than he\ncould. He manufactured, in a fashion of his own, all the things which\nfishermen use. In a corner of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue he had a small forge and\nan anvil; and the sloop having but one anchor, he had succeeded, without\nhelp, in making another. The anchor was excellent. The ring had the\nnecessary strength; and Gilliatt, though entirely uninstructed in this\nbranch of the smith's art, had found the exact dimensions of the stock\nfor preventing the over-balancing of the fluke ends.\n\nHe had patiently replaced all the nails in the planks by rivets; which\nrendered rust in the holes impossible.\n\nIn this way he had much improved the sea-going qualities of the sloop.\nHe employed it sometimes when he took a fancy to spend a month or two in\nsome solitary islet, like Chousey or the Casquets. People said, \"Ay! ay!\nGilliatt is away;\" but this was a circumstance which nobody regretted.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nA FIT TENANT FOR A HAUNTED HOUSE\n\n\nGilliatt was a man of dreams, hence his daring, hence also his timidity.\nHe had ideas on many things which were peculiarly his own.\n\nThere was in his character, perhaps, something of the visionary and the\ntranscendentalist. Hallucinations may haunt the poor peasant like\nMartin, no less than the king like Henry IV. There are times when the\nunknown reveals itself in a mysterious way to the spirit of man. A\nsudden rent in the veil of darkness will make manifest things hitherto\nunseen, and then close again upon the mysteries within. Such visions\nhave occasionally the power to effect a transfiguration in those whom\nthey visit. They convert a poor camel-driver into a Mahomet; a peasant\ngirl tending her goats into a Joan of Arc. Solitude generates a certain\namount of sublime exaltation. It is like the smoke arising from the\nburning bush. A mysterious lucidity of mind results, which converts the\nstudent into a seer, and the poet into a prophet: herein we find a key\nto the mysteries of Horeb, Kedron, Ombos; to the intoxication of\nCastilian laurels, the revelations of the month Busion. Hence, too, we\nhave Peleia at Dodona, Phemonoe at Delphos, Trophonius in Lebadea,\nEzekiel on the Chebar, and Jerome in the Thetais.\n\nMore frequently this visionary state overwhelms and stupefies its\nvictim. There is such a thing as a divine besottedness. The Hindoo fakir\nbears about with him the burden of his vision, as the Cretin his go\u00c3\u00aetre.\nLuther holding converse with devils in his garret at Wittenburg; Pascal\nshutting out the view of the infernal regions with the screen of his\ncabinet; the African Obi conversing with the white-faced god Bossum; are\neach and all the same phenomenon, diversely interpreted by the minds in\nwhich they manifest themselves, according to their capacity and power.\nLuther and Pascal were grand, and are grand still; the Obi is simply a\npoor half-witted creature.\n\nGilliatt was neither so exalted nor so low. He was a dreamer: nothing\nmore.\n\nNature presented itself to him under a somewhat strange aspect.\n\nJust as he had often found in the perfectly limpid water of the sea\nstrange creatures of considerable size and of various shapes, of the\nMedusa genus, which out of the water bore a resemblance to soft crystal,\nand which, cast again into the sea, became lost to sight in that medium\nby reason of their identity in transparency and colour, so he imagined\nthat other transparencies, similar to these almost invisible denizens of\nthe ocean, might probably inhabit the air around us. The birds are\nscarcely inhabitants of the air, but rather amphibious creatures passing\nmuch of their lives upon the earth. Gilliatt could not believe the air a\nmere desert. He used to say, \"Since the water is filled with life, why\nnot the atmosphere?\" Creatures colourless and transparent like the air\nwould escape from our observation. What proof have we that there are no\nsuch creatures? Analogy indicates that the liquid fields of air must\nhave their swimming habitants, even as the waters of the deep. These\naerial fish would, of course, be diaphanous; a provision of their wise\nCreator for our sakes as well as their own. Allowing the light to pass\nthrough their forms, casting no shadow, having no defined outline, they\nwould necessarily remain unknown to us, and beyond the grasp of human\nsense. Gilliatt indulged the wild fancy that if it were possible to\nexhaust the earth of its atmosphere, or if we could fish the air as we\nfish the depths of the sea, we should discover the existence of a\nmultitude of strange animals. And then, he would add in his reverie,\nmany things would be made clear.\n\nReverie, which is thought in its nebulous state, borders closely upon\nthe land of sleep, by which it is bounded as by a natural frontier. The\ndiscovery of a new world, in the form of an atmosphere filled with\ntransparent creatures, would be the beginning of a knowledge of the vast\nunknown. But beyond opens up the illimitable domain of the possible,\nteeming with yet other beings, and characterised by other phenomena. All\nthis would be nothing supernatural, but merely the occult continuation\nof the infinite variety of creation. In the midst of that laborious\nidleness, which was the chief feature in his existence, Gilliatt was\nsingularly observant. He even carried his observations into the domain\nof sleep. Sleep has a close relation with the possible, which we call\nalso the _invraisemblable_. The world of sleep has an existence of its\nown. Night-time, regarded as a separate sphere of creation, is a\nuniverse in itself. The material nature of man, upon which philosophers\ntell us that a column of air forty-five miles in height continually\npresses, is wearied out at night, sinks into lassitude, lies down, and\nfinds repose. The eyes of the flesh are closed; but in that drooping\nhead, less inactive than is supposed, other eyes are opened. The unknown\nreveals itself. The shadowy existences of the invisible world become\nmore akin to man; whether it be that there is a real communication, or\nwhether things far off in the unfathomable abyss are mysteriously\nbrought nearer, it seems as if the impalpable creatures inhabiting space\ncome then to contemplate our natures, curious to comprehend the denizens\nof the earth. Some phantom creation ascends or descends to walk beside\nus in the dim twilight: some existence altogether different from our\nown, composed partly of human consciousness, partly of something else,\nquits his fellows and returns again, after presenting himself for a\nmoment to our inward sight; and the sleeper, not wholly slumbering, nor\nyet entirely conscious, beholds around him strange manifestations of\nlife--pale spectres, terrible or smiling, dismal phantoms, uncouth\nmasks, unknown faces, hydra-headed monsters, undefined shapes,\nreflections of moonlight where there is no moon, vague fragments of\nmonstrous forms. All these things which come and go in the troubled\natmosphere of sleep, and to which men give the name of dreams, are, in\ntruth, only realities invisible to those who walk about the daylight\nworld. The dream-world is the Aquarium of Night.\n\nSo, at least, thought Gilliatt.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE GILD-HOLM-'UR SEAT\n\n\nThe curious visitor, in these days, would seek in vain in the little bay\nof Houmet for the house in which Gilliatt lived, or for his garden, or\nthe creek in which he sheltered the Dutch sloop. The B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue no\nlonger exists. Even the little peninsula on which his house stood has\nvanished, levelled by the pickaxe of the quarryman, and carried away,\ncart-load by cart-load, by dealers in rock and granite. It must be\nsought now in the churches, the palaces, and the quays of a great city.\nAll that ridge of rocks has been long ago conveyed to London.\n\nThese long lines of broken cliffs in the sea, with their frequent gaps\nand crevices, are like miniature chains of mountains. They strike the\neye with the impression which a giant may be supposed to have in\ncontemplating the Cordilleras. In the language of the country they are\ncalled \"Banques.\" These banques vary considerably in form. Some resemble\na long spine, of which each rock forms one of the vertebr\u00c3\u00a6; others are\nlike the backbone of a fish; while some bear an odd resemblance to a\ncrocodile in the act of drinking.\n\nAt the extremity of the ridge on which the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue was situate, was\na large rock, which the fishing people of Houmet called the \"Beast's\nHorn.\" This rock, a sort of pyramid, resembled, though less in height,\nthe \"Pinnacle\" of Jersey. At high water the sea divided it from the\nridge, and the Horn stood alone; at low water it was approached by an\nisthmus of rocks. The remarkable feature of this \"Beast's Horn\" was a\nsort of natural seat on the side next the sea, hollowed out by the\nwater, and polished by the rains. The seat, however, was a treacherous\none. The stranger was insensibly attracted to it by \"the beauty of the\nprospect,\" as the Guernsey folks said. Something detained him there in\nspite of himself, for there is a charm in a wide view. The seat seemed\nto offer itself for his convenience; it formed a sort of niche in the\npeaked _fa\u00c3\u00a7ade_ of the rock. To climb up to it was easy, for the sea,\nwhich had fashioned it out of its rocky base, had also cast beneath it,\nat convenient distances, a kind of natural stairs composed of flat\nstones. The perilous abyss is full of these snares; beware, therefore,\nof its proffered aids. The spot was tempting: the stranger mounted and\nsat down. There he found himself at his ease; for his seat he had the\ngranite rounded and hollowed out by the foam; for supports, two rocky\nelbows which seemed made expressly for him; against his back, the high\nvertical wall of rock which he looked up to and admired, without\nthinking of the impossibility of scaling it. Nothing could be more\nsimple than to fall into reverie in that convenient resting-place. All\naround spread the wide sea; far off the ships were seen passing to and\nfro. It was possible to follow a sail with the eye, till it sank in the\nhorizon beyond the Casquets. The stranger was entranced: he looked\naround, enjoying the beauty of the scene, and the light touch of wind\nand wave. There is a sort of bat found at Cayenne, which has the power\nof fanning people to sleep in the shade with a gentle beating of its\ndusky wings. Like this strange creature the wind wanders about,\nalternately ravaging or lulling into security. So the stranger would\ncontinue contemplating the sea, listening for a movement in the air, and\nyielding himself up to dreamy indolence. When the eyes are satiated with\nlight and beauty, it is a luxury to close them for awhile. Suddenly the\nloiterer would arouse; but it was too late. The sea had crept up step by\nstep; the waters surrounded the rock; the stranger had been lured on to\nhis death.\n\nA terrible rock was this in a rising sea.\n\nThe tide gathers at first insensibly, then with violence; when it\ntouches the rocks a sudden wrath seems to possess it, and it foams.\nSwimming is difficult in the breakers: excellent swimmers have been lost\nat the Horn of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue.\n\nIn certain places, and at certain periods, the aspect of the sea is\ndangerous--fatal; as at times is the glance of a woman.\n\nVery old inhabitants of Guernsey used to call this niche, fashioned\nin the rock by the waves, \"Gild-Holm-'Ur\" seat, or Kidormur; a\nCeltic word, say some authorities, which those who understand\nCeltic cannot interpret, and which all who understand French\ncan--\"_Qui-dort-meurt:_\"[1] such is the country folks' translation.\n\nThe reader may choose between the translation, _Qui-dort-meurt_, and\nthat given in 1819, I believe in _The Armorican_, by M. Athenas.\nAccording to this learned Celtic scholar, Gild-Holm-'Ur signifies \"The\nresting-place of birds.\"\n\nThere is, at Aurigny, another seat of this kind, called the Monk's\nChair, so well sculptured by the waves, and with steps of rock so\nconveniently placed, that it might be said that the sea politely sets a\nfootstool for those who rest there.\n\nIn the open sea, at high water, the Gild-Holm-'Ur was no longer visible;\nthe water covered it entirely.\n\nThe Gild-Holm-'Ur was a neighbour of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue. Gilliatt knew it\nwell, and often seated himself there. Was it his meditating place? No.\nWe have already said he did not meditate, but dream. The sea, however,\nnever entrapped him there.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] He who sleeps must die.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nMESS LETHIERRY\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nA TROUBLED LIFE, BUT A QUIET CONSCIENCE\n\n\nMess Lethierry, a conspicuous man in St. Sampson, was a redoubtable\nsailor. He had voyaged a great deal. He had been a cabin-boy, seaman,\ntopmast-man, second mate, mate, pilot, and captain. He was at this\nperiod a ship-owner. There was not a man to compare with him for general\nknowledge of the sea. He was brave in putting off to ships in distress.\nIn foul weather he would take his way along the beach, scanning the\nhorizon. \"What have we yonder?\" he would say; \"some craft in trouble?\"\nWhether it were an interloping Weymouth fisherman, a cutter from\nAurigny, a bisquine from Courseulle, the yacht of some nobleman, an\nEnglish craft or a French one--poor or rich, mattered little. He jumped\ninto a boat, called together two or three strong fellows, or did without\nthem, as the case might be, pushed out to sea, rose and sank, and rose\nagain on rolling waves, plunged into the storm, and encountered the\ndanger face to face. Then afar off, amid the rain and lightning, and\ndrenched with water, he was sometimes seen upright in his boat like a\nlion with a foaming mane. Often he would pass whole days in danger\namidst the waves, the hail, and the wind, making his way to the sides of\nfoundering vessels during the tempest, and rescuing men and merchandise.\nAt night, after feats like these, he would return home, and pass his\ntime in knitting stockings.\n\nFor fifty years he led this kind of life--from ten years of age to\nsixty--so long did he feel himself still young. At sixty, he began to\ndiscover that he could no longer lift with one hand the great anvil at\nthe forge of Varclin. This anvil weighed three hundredweight. At length\nrheumatic pains compelled him to be a prisoner; he was forced to give up\nhis old struggle with the sea, to pass from the heroic into the\npatriarchal stage, to sink into the condition of a harmless, worthy old\nfellow.\n\nHappily his rheumatism attacks happened at the period when he had\nsecured a comfortable competency. These two consequences of labour are\nnatural companions. At the moment when men become rich, how often comes\nparalysis--the sorrowful crowning of a laborious life!\n\nOld and weary men say among themselves, \"Let us rest and enjoy life.\"\n\nThe population of islands like Guernsey is composed of men who have\npassed their lives in going about their little fields or in sailing\nround the world. These are the two classes of the labouring people; the\nlabourers on the land, and the toilers of the sea. Mess Lethierry was of\nthe latter class; he had had a life of hard work. He had been upon the\ncontinent; was for some time a ship carpenter at Rochefort, and\nafterwards at Cette. We have just spoken of sailing round the world; he\nhad made the circuit of all France, getting work as a journeyman\ncarpenter; and had been employed at the great salt works of\nFranche-Comte. Though a humble man, he had led a life of adventure. In\nFrance he had learned to read, to think, to have a will of his own. He\nhad had a hand in many things, and in all he had done had kept a\ncharacter for probity. At bottom, however, he was simply a sailor. The\nwater was his element; he used to say that he lived with the fish when\nreally at home. In short, his whole existence, except two or three\nyears, had been devoted to the ocean. Flung into the water, as he said,\nhe had navigated the great oceans both of the Atlantic and the Pacific,\nbut he preferred the Channel. He used to exclaim enthusiastically, \"That\nis the sea for a rough time of it!\" He was born at sea, and at sea would\nhave preferred to end his days. After sailing several times round the\nworld, and seeing most countries, he had returned to Guernsey, and never\npermanently left the island again. Henceforth his great voyages were to\nGranville and St. Malo.\n\nMess Lethierry was a Guernsey man--that peculiar amalgamation of\nFrenchman and Norman, or rather English. He had within himself this\nquadruple extraction, merged and almost lost in that far wider country,\nthe ocean. Throughout his life and wheresoever he went, he had preserved\nthe habits of a Norman fisherman.\n\nAll this, however, did not prevent his looking now and then into some\nold book; of taking pleasure in reading, in knowing the names of\nphilosophers and poets, and in talking a little now and then in all\nlanguages.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nA CERTAIN PREDILECTION\n\n\nGilliatt was a child of Nature. Mess Lethierry was the same.\n\nLethierry's uncultivated nature, however, was not without certain\nrefinements.\n\nHe was fastidious upon the subject of women's hands. In his early years,\nwhile still a lad, passing from the stage of cabin-boy to that of\nsailor, he had heard the Admiral de Suffren say, \"There goes a pretty\ngirl; but what horrible great red hands.\" An observation from an admiral\non any subject is a command, a law, an authority far above that of an\noracle. The exclamation of Admiral de Suffren had rendered Lethierry\nfastidious and exacting in the matter of small and white hands. His own\nhand, a large club fist of the colour of mahogany, was like a mallet or\na pair of pincers for a friendly grasp, and, tightly closed, would\nalmost break a paving-stone.\n\nHe had never married; he had either no inclination for matrimony, or had\nnever found a suitable match. That, perhaps, was due to his being a\nstickler for hands like those of a duchess. Such hands are, indeed,\nsomewhat rare among the fishermen's daughters at Portbail.\n\nIt was whispered, however, that at Rochefort, on the Charente, he had,\nonce upon a time, made the acquaintance of a certain grisette, realising\nhis ideal. She was a pretty girl with graceful hands; but she was a\nvixen, and had also a habit of scratching. Woe betide any one who\nattacked her! yet her nails, though capable at a pinch of being turned\ninto claws, were of a cleanliness which left nothing to be desired. It\nwas these peculiarly bewitching nails which had first enchanted and then\ndisturbed the peace of Lethierry, who, fearing that he might one day\nbecome no longer master of his mistress, had decided not to conduct that\nyoung lady to the nuptial altar.\n\nAnother time he met at Aurigny a country girl who pleased him. He\nthought of marriage, when one of the inhabitants of the place said to\nhim, \"I congratulate you; you will have for your wife a good fuel\nmaker.\" Lethierry asked the meaning of this. It appeared that the\ncountry people at Aurigny have a certain custom of collecting manure\nfrom their cow-houses, which they throw against a wall, where it is left\nto dry and fall to the ground. Cakes of dried manure of this kind are\nused for fuel, and are called _coipiaux_. A country girl of Aurigny has\nno chance of getting a husband if she is not a good fuel maker; but the\nyoung lady's especial talent only inspired disgust in Lethierry.\n\nBesides, he had in his love matters a kind of rough country folks'\nphilosophy, a sailor-like sort of habit of mind. Always smitten but\nnever enslaved, he boasted of having been in his youth easily conquered\nby a petticoat, or rather a _cotillon_; for what is now-a-days called a\ncrinoline, was in his time called a _cotillon_; a term which, in his use\nof it, signifies both something more and something less than a wife.\n\nThese rude seafaring men of the Norman Archipelago, have a certain\namount of shrewdness. Almost all can read and write. On Sundays, little\ncabin-boys may be seen in those parts, seated upon a coil of ropes,\nreading, with book in hand. From all time these Norman sailors have had\na peculiar satirical vein, and have been famous for clever sayings. It\nwas one of these men, the bold pilot Qu\u00c3\u00a9ripel, who said to Montgomery,\nwhen he sought refuge in Jersey after the unfortunate accident in\nkilling Henry II. at a tournament, with a blow of his lance, \"_T\u00c3\u00aate\nfolle a cass\u00c3\u00a9 t\u00c3\u00aate vide_.\" Another one, Touzeau, a sea-captain at St.\nBr\u00c3\u00a9lade, was the author of that philosophical pun, erroneously\nattributed to Camus, \"_Apr\u00c3\u00a8s la mort, les papes deviennent papillons, et\nles sires deviennent cirons_.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE OLD SEA LANGUAGE\n\n\nThe mariners of the Channel are the true ancient Gauls. The islands,\nwhich in these days become rapidly more and more English--preserved for\nmany ages their old French character. The peasant in Sark speaks the\nlanguage of Louis XIV. Forty years ago, the old classical nautical\nlanguage was to be found in the mouths of the sailors of Jersey and\nAurigny. When amongst them, it was possible to imagine oneself carried\nback to the sea life of the seventeenth century. From that speaking\ntrumpet which terrified Admiral Hidde, a philologist might have learnt\nthe ancient technicalities of manoeuvring and giving orders at sea, in\nthe very words which were roared out to his sailors by Jean Bart. The\nold French maritime vocabulary is now almost entirely changed, but was\nstill in use in Jersey in 1820. A ship that was a good plyer was _bon\nboulinier_; one that carried a weather-helm in spite of her foresails\nand rudder was _un vaisseau ardent_; to get under way was _prendre\naire_; to lie to in a storm, _capeyer_; to make fast running rigging was\n_faire dormant_; to get to windward, _faire chapelle_; to keep the cable\ntight, _faire teste_; to be out of trim, _\u00c3\u00aatre en pantenne_; to keep the\nsails full, _porter plain_. These expressions have fallen out of use.\nTo-day we say _louvoyer_ for to beat to windward, they said _leauvoyer_;\nfor _naviguer_, sail, they said _naviger_; for _virer vent devant_, to\ntack, _donner vent devant_; for _aller de l'avant_, to make headway,\n_tailler de l'avant_; for _tirez d'accord_, haul together, _halez\nd'accord_; for _d\u00c3\u00a9rapez_, to weigh anchor, _deplantez_; for _embraquez_,\nto haul tight, _abraquez_; for _taquets_, cleats, _bittons_; for\n_burins_, toggles, _tappes_; for _balancine_, fore-lift, main-lift,\netc., _valancine_; for _tribord_, starboard, _stribord_; for _les hommes\nde quart \u00c3\u00a0 b\u00c3\u00a2bord_, men of the larboard watch, _les basbourdis_.\nTourville wrote to Hocquincourt: _nous avons singl\u00c3\u00a9t_ (sailed), for\n_cingl\u00c3\u00a9_. Instead of _la rafale_, squall, _le raffal_; instead of\n_bossoir_, cat-head, _boussoir_; instead of _drosse_, truss, _drousse_;\ninstead of _loffer_, to luff, _faire une olof\u00c3\u00a9e_; instead of _elonger_,\nto lay alongside, _alonger_; instead of _forte brise_, stiff breeze,\n_survent_; instead of _jouail_, stock of an anchor, _jas_; instead of\n_soute_, store-room, _fosse_.\n\nSuch, at the beginning of this century, was the maritime dialect of the\nChannel Islands. Ango would have been startled had he heard the speech\nof a Jersey pilot. Whilst everywhere else the sails _faseyaient_\n(shivered), in these islands they _barbeyaient_. A _saute de vent_,\nsudden shift of wind, was a _folle-vente_. The old methods of mooring\nknown as _la valture_ and _la portugaise_ were alone used, and such\ncommands as _jour-et-chaque!_ and _bosse et vilte!_ might still be\nheard. While a sailor of Granville was already employing the word _clan_\nfor sheave-hold, one of St. Aubin or of St. Sampson still stuck to his\n_canal de pouliot_. What was called _bout d'alonge_ (upper fultock) at\nSt. Malo, was _oreille d'\u00c3\u00a2ne_ at St. Helier. Mess Lethierry, as did the\nDuke de Vibonne, called the sheer of the decks _la tonture_, and the\ncaulker's chisel _la patarasse_.\n\nIt was with this uncouth sea dialect in his mouth that Duquesne beat De\nRuyter, that Duguay Trouin defeated Wasnaer, and that Tourville, in\n1681, poured a broadside into the first galley which bombarded Algiers.\nIt is now a dead language. The idiom of the sea is altogether different.\nDuperr\u00c3\u00a9 would not be able to understand Suffren.\n\nThe language of French naval signals is not less transformed; there is a\nlong distance between the four pennants, red, white, yellow, and blue,\nof Labourdonnaye, and the eighteen flags of these days, which, hoisted\ntwo and two, three and three, or four and four, furnish, for distant\ncommunication, sixty-six thousand combinations, are never deficient,\nand, so to speak, foresee the unforeseen.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nONE IS VULNERABLE WHERE ONE LOVES\n\n\nMess Lethierry's heart and hand were always ready--a large heart and a\nlarge hand. His failing was that admirable one, self-confidence. He had\na certain fashion of his own of undertaking to do a thing. It was a\nsolemn fashion. He said, \"I give my word of honour to do it, with God's\nhelp.\" That said, he went through with his duty. He put his faith in\nGod--nothing more. His rare churchgoing was merely formal. At sea he was\nsuperstitious.\n\nNevertheless, the storm had never yet arisen which could daunt him. One\nreason of this was his impatience of opposition. He could tolerate it\nneither from the ocean nor anything else. He meant to have his way; so\nmuch the worse for the sea if it thwarted him. It might try, if it\nwould, but Mess Lethierry would not give in. A refractory wave could no\nmore stop him than an angry neighbour. What he had said was said; what\nhe planned out was done. He bent neither before an objection nor before\nthe tempest. The word \"no\" had no existence for him, whether it was in\nthe mouth of a man or in the angry muttering of a thunder-cloud. In the\nteeth of all he went on in his way. He would take no refusals. Hence his\nobstinacy in life, and his intrepidity on the ocean.\n\nHe seasoned his simple meal of fish soup for himself, knowing the\nquantities of pepper, salt, and herbs which it required, and was as well\npleased with the cooking as with the meal. To complete the sketch of\nLethierry's peculiarities, the reader must conjure a being to whom the\nputting on of a surtout would amount to a transfiguration; whom a\nlandsman's greatcoat would convert into a strange animal; one who,\nstanding with his locks blown about by the wind, might have represented\nold Jean Bart, but who, in the landsman's round hat, would have looked\nan idiot; awkward in cities, wild and redoubtable at sea; a man with\nbroad shoulders, fit for a porter; one who indulged in no oaths, was\nrarely in anger, whose voice had a soft accent, which became like\nthunder in a speaking-trumpet; a peasant who had read something of the\nphilosophy of Diderot and D'Alembert; a Guernsey man who had seen the\ngreat Revolution; a learned ignoramus, free from bigotry, but indulging\nin visions, with more faith in the White Lady than in the Holy Virgin;\npossessing the strength of Polyphemus, the perseverance of Columbus,\nwith a little of the bull in his nature, and a little of the child. Add\nto these physical and mental peculiarities a somewhat flat nose, large\ncheeks, a set of teeth still perfect, a face filled with wrinkles, and\nwhich seemed to have been buffeted by the waves and subjected to the\nbeating of the winds of forty years, a brow in which the storm and\ntempest were plainly written--an incarnation of a rock in the open sea.\nAdd to this, too, a good-tempered smile always ready to light up his\nweather-beaten countenance, and you have before you Mess Lethierry.\n\nMess Lethierry had two special objects of affection only. Their names\nwere Durande and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nDURANDE AND D\u00c3\u0089RUCHETTE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nPRATTLE AND SMOKE\n\n\nThe human body might well be regarded as a mere simulacrum; but it\nenvelopes our reality, it darkens our light, and broadens the shadow in\nwhich we live. The soul is the reality of our existence. Strictly\nspeaking, the human visage is a mask. The true man is that which exists\nunder what is called man. If that being, which thus exists sheltered and\nsecreted behind that illusion which we call the flesh, could be\napproached, more than one strange revelation would be made. The vulgar\nerror is to mistake the outward husk for the living spirit. Yonder\nmaiden, for example, if we could see her as she really is, might she not\nfigure as some bird of the air?\n\nA bird transmuted into a young maiden, what could be more exquisite?\nPicture it in your own home, and call it D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Delicious creature!\nOne might be almost tempted to say, \"Good-morning, Mademoiselle\nGoldfinch.\" The wings are invisible, but the chirping may still be\nheard. Sometimes, too, she pipes a clear, loud song. In her childlike\nprattle, the creature is, perhaps, inferior; but in her song, how\nsuperior to humanity! When womanhood dawns, this angel flies away; but\nsometimes returns, bringing back a little one to a mother. Meanwhile,\nshe who is one day to be a mother is for a long while a child; the girl\nbecomes a maiden, fresh and joyous as the lark. Noting her movements, we\nfeel as if it was good of her not to fly away. The dear familiar\ncompanion moves at her own sweet will about the house; flits from branch\nto branch, or rather from room to room; goes to and fro; approaches and\nretires; plumes her wings, or rather combs her hair, and makes all kinds\nof gentle noises--murmurings of unspeakable delight to certain ears. She\nasks a question, and is answered; is asked something in return, and\nchirps a reply. It is delightful to chat with her when tired of serious\ntalk; for this creature carries with her something of her skyey element.\nShe is, as it were, a thread of gold interwoven with your sombre\nthoughts; you feel almost grateful to her for her kindness in not making\nherself invisible, when it would be so easy for her to be even\nimpalpable; for the beautiful is a necessary of life. There is, in this\nworld, no function more important than that of being charming. The\nforest-glade would be incomplete without the humming-bird. To shed joy\naround, to radiate happiness, to cast light upon dark days, to be the\ngolden thread of our destiny, and the very spirit of grace and harmony,\nis not this to render a service? Does not beauty confer a benefit upon\nus, even by the simple fact of being beautiful? Here and there we meet\nwith one who possesses that fairy-like power of enchanting all about\nher; sometimes she is ignorant herself of this magical influence, which\nis, however, for that reason, only the more perfect. Her presence lights\nup the home; her approach is like a cheerful warmth; she passes by; and\nwe are content; she stays awhile, and we are happy. To behold her is to\nlive: she is the Aurora with a human face. She has no need to do more\nthan simply to be: she makes an Eden of the house; Paradise breathes\nfrom her; and she communicates this delight to all, without taking any\ngreater trouble than that of existing beside them. Is it not a thing\ndivine to have a smile which, none know how, has the power to lighten\nthe weight of that enormous chain which all the living, in common, drag\nbehind them? D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette possessed this smile: we may even say that this\nsmile was D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette herself. There is one thing which has more\nresemblance to ourselves than even our face, and that is our expression:\nbut there is yet another thing which more resembles us than this, and\nthat is our smile. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette smiling was simply D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThere is something peculiarly attractive in the Jersey and Guernsey\nrace. The women, particularly the young, are remarkable for a pure and\nexquisite beauty. Their complexion is a combination of the Saxon\nfairness, with the proverbial ruddiness of the Norman people--rosy\ncheeks and blue eyes; but the eyes want brilliancy. The English training\ndulls them. Their liquid glances will be irresistible whenever the\nsecret is found of giving them that depth which is the glory of the\nParisienne. Happily Englishwomen are not yet quite transformed into the\nParisian type. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was not a Parisian; yet she was certainly not\na Guernesiaise. Lethierry had brought her up to be neat and delicate and\npretty; and so she was.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had, at times, an air of bewitching langour, and a certain\nmischief in the eye, which were altogether involuntary. She scarcely\nknew, perhaps, the meaning of the word love, and yet not unwillingly\nensnared those about her in the toils. But all this in her was innocent.\nShe never thought of marrying.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had the prettiest little hands in the world, and little feet\nto match them. Sweetness and goodness reigned throughout her person; her\nfamily and fortune were her uncle Mess Lethierry; her occupation was\nonly to live her daily life; her accomplishments were the knowledge of a\nfew songs; her intellectual gifts were summed up in her simple\ninnocence; she had the graceful repose of the West Indian woman, mingled\nat times with giddiness and vivacity, with the teasing playfulness of a\nchild, yet with a dash of melancholy. Her dress was somewhat rustic, and\nlike that peculiar to her country--elegant, though not in accordance\nwith the fashions of great cities; for she wore flowers in her bonnet\nall the year round. Add to all this an open brow, a neck supple and\ngraceful, chestnut hair, a fair skin slightly freckled with exposure to\nthe sun, a mouth somewhat large, but well-defined, and visited from time\nto time by a dangerous smile. This was D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nSometimes in the evening, a little after sunset, at the moment when the\ndusk of the sky mingles with the dusk of the sea, and twilight invests\nthe waves with a mysterious awe, the people beheld, entering the harbour\nof St. Sampson, upon the dark rolling waters, a strange, undefined\nthing, a monstrous form which puffed and blew; a horrid machine which\nroared like a wild beast, and smoked like a volcano; a species of Hydra\nfoaming among the breakers, and leaving behind it a dense cloud, as it\nrushed on towards the town with a frightful beating of its fins, and a\nthroat belching forth flame. This was Durande.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE OLD STORY OF UTOPIA\n\n\nA steamboat was a prodigious novelty in the waters of the Channel in\n182-. The whole coast of Normandy was long strangely excited by it.\nNow-a-days, ten or a dozen steam vessels, crossing and recrossing within\nthe bounds of the horizon, scarcely attract a glance from loiterers on\nthe shore. At the most, some persons, whose interest or business it is\nto note such things, will observe the indications in their smoke of\nwhether they burn Welsh or Newcastle coal. They pass, and that is all.\n\"Welcome,\" if coming home; \"a pleasant passage,\" if outward bound.\n\nFolks were less calm on the subject of these wonderful inventions in the\nfirst quarter of the present century; and the new and strange machines,\nand their long lines of smoke regarded with no good-will by the Channel\nIslanders. In that Puritanical Archipelago, where the Queen of England\nhas been censured for violating the Scriptures[2] by using chloroform\nduring her accouchments, the first steam-vessel which made its\nappearance received the name of the \"Devil Boat.\" In the eyes of these\nworthy fishermen, once Catholics, now Calvinists, but always bigots, it\nseemed to be a portion of the infernal regions which had been somehow\nset afloat. A local preacher selected for his discourse the question of\n\"Whether man has the right to make fire and water work together when God\nhad divided them.[3] This beast, composed of iron and fire, did it not\nresemble Leviathan? Was it not an attempt to bring chaos again into the\nuniverse? This is not the only occasion on which the progress of\ncivilisation has been stigmatised as a return to chaos.\n\n\"A mad notion--a gross delusion--an absurdity!\" Such was the verdict of\nthe Academy of Sciences when consulted by Napoleon on the subject of\nsteamboats, early in the present century. The poor fishermen of St.\nSampson may be excused for not being, in scientific matters, any wiser\nthan the mathematicians of Paris; and in religious matters, a little\nisland like Guernsey is not bound to be more enlightened than a great\ncontinent like America. In the year 1807, when the first steamboat of\nFulton, commanded by Livingston, furnished with one of Watt's engines,\nsent from England, and manoeuvred, besides her ordinary crew, by two\nFrenchmen only, Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Michaux and another, made her first voyage from\nNew York to Albany, it happened that she set sail on the 17th of August.\nThe Methodists took up this important fact, and in numberless chapels,\npreachers were heard calling down a malediction on the machine, and\ndeclaring that this number 17 was no other than the total of the ten\nhorns and seven heads of the beast of the Apocalypse. In America, they\ninvoked against the steamboats the beast from the book of Revelation; in\nEurope, the reptile of the book of Genesis. This was the simple\ndifference.\n\nThe savants had rejected steamboats as impossible; the priests had\nanathematised them as impious. Science had condemned, and religion\nconsigned them to perdition. Fulton was a new incarnation of Lucifer.\nThe simple people on the coasts and in the villages were confirmed in\ntheir prejudice by the uneasiness which they felt at the outlandish\nsight. The religious view of steamboats may be summed up as follows:\nWater and fire were divorced at the creation. This divorce was enjoined\nby God himself. Man has no right to join what his Maker has put asunder;\nto reunite what he has disunited. The peasants' view was simply, \"I\ndon't like the look of this thing.\"\n\nNo one but Mess Lethierry, perhaps, could have been found at that early\nperiod daring enough to dream of such an enterprise as the establishment\nof a steam-vessel between Guernsey and St. Malo. He, alone, as an\nindependent thinker, was capable of conceiving such an idea, or, as a\nhardy mariner, of carrying it out. The French part of his nature,\nprobably, conceived the idea; the English part supplied the energy to\nput it in execution.\n\nHow and when this was, we are about to inform the reader.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[2] Genesis, chap. iii. v. 16.\n\n[3] Genesis, chap. i. v. 4.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nRANTAINE\n\n\nAbout forty years before the period of the commencement of our\nnarrative, there stood in the suburbs of Paris, near the city wall,\nbetween the Fosse-aux-Loups and the Tombe-Issoire, a house of doubtful\nreputation. It was a lonely, ruinous building, evidently a place for\ndark deeds on an occasion. Here lived, with his wife and child, a\nspecies of town bandit; a man who had been clerk to an attorney\npractising at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet--he figured somewhat later at the Assize\nCourt; the name of this family was Rantaine. On a mahogany chest of\ndrawers in the old house were two china cups, ornamented with flowers,\non one of which appeared, in gilt letters, the words, \"A souvenir of\nfriendship;\" on the other, \"A token of esteem.\" The child lived in an\natmosphere of vice in this miserable home. The father and mother having\nbelonged to the lower middle class, the boy had learnt to read, and they\nbrought it up in a fashion. The mother, pale and almost in rags, gave\n\"instruction,\" as she called it, mechanically, to the little one, heard\nit spell a few words to her, and interrupted the lesson to accompany\nher husband on some criminal expedition, or to earn the wages of\nprostitution. Meanwhile, the book remained open on the table as she had\nleft it, and the boy sat beside it, meditating in his way.\n\nThe father and mother, detected one day in one of their criminal\nenterprises, suddenly vanished into that obscurity in which the penal\nlaws envelop convicted malefactors. The child, too, disappeared.\n\nLethierry, in his wanderings about the world, stumbled, one day, on an\nadventurer like himself; helped him out of some scrape; rendered him a\nkindly service, and was apparently repaid with gratitude. He took a\nfancy to the stranger, picked him up, and brought him to Guernsey,\nwhere, finding him intelligent in learning the duties of a sailor aboard\na coasting vessel, he made him a companion. This stranger was the little\nRantaine, now grown up to manhood.\n\nRantaine, like Lethierry, had a bull neck, a large and powerful breadth\nof shoulders for carrying burdens, and loins like those of the Farnese\nHercules. Lethierry and he had a remarkable similarity of appearance:\nRantaine was the taller. People who saw their forms behind as they were\nwalking side by side along the port, exclaimed, \"There are two\nbrothers.\" On looking them in the face the effect was different: all\nthat was open in the countenance of Lethierry was reserved and cautious\nin that of Rantaine. Rantaine was an expert swordsman, played on the\nharmonica, could snuff a candle at twenty paces with a pistol-ball,\ncould strike a tremendous blow with the fist, recite verses from\nVoltaire's _Henriade_, and interpret dreams; he knew by heart _Les\nTombeaux de Saint Denis_, by Treneuil. He talked sometimes of having had\nrelations with the Sultan of Calicut, \"whom the Portuguese call the\nZamorin.\" If any one had seen the little memorandum-book which he\ncarried about with him, he would have found notes and jottings of this\nkind: \"At Lyons in a fissure of the wall of one of the cells in the\nprison of St. Joseph, a file.\" He spoke always with a grave\ndeliberation; he called himself the son of a Chevalier de Saint Louis.\nHis linen was of a miscellaneous kind, and marked with different\ninitials. Nobody was ever more tender than he was on the point of\nhonour; he fought and killed his man. The mother of a pretty actress\ncould not have an eye more watchful for an insult.\n\nHe might have stood for the personification of subtlety under an outer\ngarb of enormous strength.\n\nIt was the power of his fist, applied one day at a fair, upon a _cabeza\nde moro_, which had originally taken the fancy of Lethierry. No one in\nGuernsey knew anything of his adventures. They were of a chequered kind.\nIf the great theatre of destiny had a special wardrobe, Rantaine ought\nto have taken the dress of harlequin. He had lived, and had seen the\nworld. He had run through the gamut of possible trades and qualities;\nhad been a cook at Madagascar, trainer of birds at Honolulu, a religious\njournalist at the Galapagos Islands, a poet at Oomrawuttee, a freeman at\nHaiti. In this latter character he had delivered at Grand Goave a\nfuneral oration, of which the local journals have preserved this\nfragment: \"Farewell, then, noble spirit. In the azure vault of the\nheavens, where thou wingest now thy flight, thou wilt, no doubt, rejoin\nthe good Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Leander Crameau, of Little Goave. Tell him that, thanks to\nten years of glorious efforts, thou hast completed the church of the\n_Ansa-\u00c3\u00a0-Veau_. Adieu! transcendent genius, model mason!\" His freemason's\nmask did not prevent him, as we see, wearing a little of the Roman\nCatholic. The former won to his side the men of progress, and the latter\nthe men of order. He declared himself a white of pure caste, and hated\nthe negroes; though, for all that, he would certainly have been an\nadmirer of the Emperor Soulouque. In 1815, at Bordeaux, the glow of his\nroyalist enthusiasm broke forth in the shape of a huge white feather in\nhis cap. His life had been a series of eclipses--of appearances,\ndisappearances, and reappearances. He was a sort of revolving light upon\nthe coasts of scampdom. He knew a little Turkish: instead of\n\"guillotined,\" would say \"_n\u00c3\u00a9bo\u00c3\u00afss\u00c3\u00a9_.\" He had been a slave in Tripoli,\nin the house of a Thaleb, and had learnt Turkish by dint of blows with a\nstick. His employment had been to stand at evenings at the doors of the\nmosque, there to read aloud to the faithful the Koran inscribed upon\nslips of wood, or pieces of camel leather. It is not improbable that he\nwas a renegade.\n\nHe was capable of everything, and something worse.\n\nHe had a trick of laughing loud and knitting his brows at the same time.\nHe used to say, \"In politics, I esteem only men inaccessible to\ninfluences;\" or, \"I am for decency and good morals;\" or, \"The pyramid\nmust be replaced upon its base.\" His manner was rather cheerful and\ncordial than otherwise. The expression of his mouth contradicted the\nsense of his words. His nostrils had an odd way of distending\nthemselves. In the corners of his eyes he had a little network of\nwrinkles, in which all sorts of dark thoughts seemed to meet together.\nIt was here alone that the secret of his physiognomy could be thoroughly\nstudied. His flat foot was a vulture's claw. His skull was low at the\ntop and large about the temples. His ill-shapen ear, bristled with hair,\nseemed to say, \"Beware of speaking to the animal in this cave.\"\n\nOne fine day, in Guernsey, Rantaine was suddenly missing.\n\nLethierry's partner had absconded, leaving the treasury of their\npartnership empty.\n\nIn this treasury there was some money of Rantaine's, no doubt, but there\nwere also fifty thousand francs belonging to Lethierry.\n\nBy forty years of industry and probity as a coaster and ship carpenter,\nLethierry had saved one hundred thousand francs. Rantaine robbed him of\nhalf the sum.\n\nHalf ruined, Lethierry did not lose heart, but began at once to think\nhow to repair his misfortune. A stout heart may be ruined in fortune,\nbut not in spirit. It was just about that time that people began to talk\nof the new kind of boat to be moved by steam-engines. Lethierry\nconceived the idea of trying Fulton's invention, so much disputed about;\nand by one of these fire-boats to connect the Channel Islands with the\nFrench coast. He staked his all upon this idea; he devoted to it the\nwreck of his savings. Accordingly, six months after Rantaine's flight,\nthe astonished people of St. Sampson beheld, issuing from the port, a\nvessel discharging huge volumes of smoke, and looking like a ship a-fire\nat sea. This was the first steam-vessel to navigate the Channel.\n\nThis vessel, to which the people in their dislike and contempt for\nnovelty immediately gave the nickname of \"Lethierry's Galley,\" was\nannounced as intended to maintain a constant communication between\nGuernsey and St. Malo.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF UTOPIA\n\n\nIt may be well imagined that the new enterprise did not prosper much at\nfirst. The owners of cutters passing between the Island of Guernsey and\nthe French coast were loud in their outcries. They denounced this attack\nupon the Holy Scriptures and their monopoly. The chapels began to\nfulminate against it. One reverend gentleman, named Elihu, stigmatised\nthe new steam-vessel as an \"atheistical construction,\" and the\nsailing-boat was declared the only orthodox craft. The people saw the\nhorns of the devil among the beasts which the fireship carried to and\nfro. This storm of protest continued a considerable time. At last,\nhowever, it began to be perceived that these animals arrived less tired\nand sold better, their meat being superior; that the sea risk was less\nalso for passengers; that this mode of travelling was less expensive,\nshorter, and more sure; that they started at a fixed time, and arrived\nat a fixed time; that consignments of fish travelling faster arrived\nfresher, and that it was now possible to find a sale in the French\nmarkets for the surplus of great takes of fish so common in Guernsey.\nThe butter, too, from the far-famed Guernsey cows, made the passage\nquicker in the \"Devil Boat\" than in the old sailing vessels, and lost\nnothing of its good quality, insomuch that Dinan, in Brittany, began to\nbecome a customer for it, as well as St. Brieuc and Rennes. In short,\nthanks to what they called \"Lethierry's Galley,\" the people enjoyed safe\ntravelling, regular communication, prompt and easy passages to and fro,\nan increase of circulation, an extension of markets and of commerce,\nand, finally, it was felt that it was necessary to patronise this \"Devil\nBoat,\" which flew in the face of the Holy Scriptures, and brought wealth\nto the island. Some daring spirits even went so far as to express a\npositive satisfaction at it. Sieur Landoys, the registrar, bestowed his\napproval upon the vessel--an undoubted piece of impartiality on his\npart, as he did not like Lethierry. For, first of all, Lethierry was\nentitled to the dignity of \"Mess,\" while Landoys was merely \"Sieur\nLandoys.\" Then, although registrar of St. Peter's Port, Landoys was a\nparishioner of St. Sampson. Now, there was not in the entire parish\nanother man besides them devoid of prejudices. It seemed little enough,\ntherefore, to indulge themselves with a detestation of each other. Two\nof a trade, says the proverb, rarely agree.\n\nSieur Landoys, however, had the honesty to support the steamboat. Others\nfollowed Landoys. By little and little, these facts multiplied. The\ngrowth of opinion is like the rising tide. Time and the continued and\nincreasing success of the venture, with the evidence of real service\nrendered and the improvement in the general welfare, gradually converted\nthe people; and the day at length arrived when, with the exception of a\nfew wiseacres, every one admired \"Lethierry's Galley.\"\n\nIt would probably win less admiration now-a-days. This steamboat of\nforty years since would doubtless provoke a smile among our modern\nboat-builders; for this marvel was ill-shaped; this prodigy was clumsy\nand infirm.\n\nThe distance between our grand Atlantic steam-vessels of the present day\nand the boats with wheel-paddles which Denis Papin floated on the Fulda\nin 1707, is not greater than that between a three-decker, like the\n_Montebello_, 200 feet long, having a mainyard of 115 feet, carrying a\nweight of 3000 tons, 1100 men, 120 guns, 10,000 cannon-balls, and 160\npackages of canister, belching forth at every broadside, when in action,\n3300 pounds of iron, and spreading to the wind, when it moves, 5600\nsquare m\u00c3\u00a8tres of canvas, and the old Danish galley of the second\ncentury, discovered, full of stone hatchets, and bows and clubs, in the\nmud of the seashore, at Wester-Satrup, and preserved at the Hotel de\nVille at Flensburg.\n\nExactly one hundred years--from 1707 to 1807--separate the first\npaddle-boat of Papin from the first steamboat of Fulton. \"Lethierry's\nGalley\" was assuredly a great improvement upon those two rough sketches;\nbut it was itself only a sketch. For all that, it was a masterpiece in\nits way. Every scientific discovery in embryo presents that double\naspect--a monster in the foetus, a marvel in the germ.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE DEVIL BOAT\n\n\n\"Lethierry's Galley\" was not masted with a view to sailing well; a fact\nwhich was not a defect; it is, indeed, one of the laws of naval\nconstruction. Besides, her motive power being steam, her sails were only\naccessory. A paddle steamboat, moreover, is almost insensible to sails.\nThe new steam-vessel was too short, round, and thick-set. She had too\nmuch bow, and too great a breadth of quarter. The daring of inventors\nhad not yet reached the point of making a steam-vessel light;\nLethierry's boat had some of the defects of Gilliatt's Dutch sloop. She\npitched very little, but she rolled a good deal. Her paddle-boxes were\ntoo high. She had too much beam for her length. The massive machinery\nencumbered her, and to make her capable of carrying a heavy cargo, her\nconstructors had raised her bulwarks to an unusual height, giving to the\nvessel the defects of old seventy-fours, a bastard model which would\nhave to be cut down to render them really seaworthy, or fit to go into\naction. Being short, she ought to have been able to veer quickly--the\ntime employed in a manoeuvre of that kind being in proportion to the\nlength of the vessel--but her weight deprived her of the advantage of\nher shortness. Her midship-frame was too broad, a fact which retarded\nher; the resistance of the sea being proportioned to the largest section\nbelow the water-line, and to the square of the speed. Her prow was\nvertical, which would not be regarded as a fault at the present day, but\nat that period this portion of the construction was invariably sloped at\nan angle of forty-five degrees. All the curving lines of the hull agreed\nwell together, but it was not long enough for oblique sailing, or for\nlying parallel with the water displaced, which should always be thrown\noff laterally. In rough weather she drew too much water, sometimes fore,\nsometimes aft, which showed that her centre of gravity was not rightly\nadjusted. Owing to the weight of the engine, the cargo shifted, so that\nthe centre of gravity was often aft of the mainmast, and then steam\npower had to be resorted to, for at such times the mainsail had to be\nfurled as it only made the vessel fall off. If close to the wind, very\ncareful manoeuvring was required. The rudder was the old-fashioned\nbar-rudder, not the wheeled one of the present time. Two skiffs, a\nspecies of _you-yous_, were suspended to the davits. The vessel had four\nanchors; the sheet-anchor, the second or working anchor, and two\nbower-anchors. These four anchors, slung by chains, were moved,\naccording to the occasion, by the great capstan of the poop, or by the\nsmall capstan at the prow. At that period the pump windlass had not\nsuperseded the intermitting efforts of the old handspike. Having only\ntwo bower-anchors, one on the starboard and the other on the larboard\nside, the vessel could not move conveniently in certain winds, though\nshe could aid herself at such times with the second anchor. Her buoys\nwere normal, and so constructed that they carried the weight of the\nbuoy-ropes without dipping. The launch was of a useful size, of service\nin all cases of need, and able to raise the main anchor. A novelty about\nher was that she was rigged with chains, which in no way detracted,\nhowever, from the mobility of the running rigging, or from the firmness\nof the standing rigging. The masts, yards, etc., although not of\nfirst-rate quality, were not in any way amiss, and the rigging at the\nmast-head was not very noticeable. The ribs were solid, but coarse, less\ndelicacy of wood being required for steam than for sail. Her speed was\nsix knots an hour. When lying-to she rode well. Take her as she was,\n\"Lethierry's Galley\" was a good sea boat; but people felt, that in\nmoments of danger from reefs or waterspouts, she would be hardly\nmanageable. Unhappily her build made her roll about on the waves, with a\nperpetual creaking like that of a new shoe.\n\nShe was, above all, a merchandise boat, and, like all ships built more\nfor commerce than for fighting, was constructed exclusively with a view\nto stowage. She carried few passengers. The transport of cattle rendered\nstowage difficult and very peculiar. Vessels carried bullocks at that\ntime in the hold, which was a complication of the difficulty. At the\npresent day they are stowed on the fore-deck. The paddle-boxes of\nLethierry's \"Devil Boat\" were painted white, the hull, down to the\nwater-line, red, and all the rest of the vessel black, according to the\nsomewhat ugly fashion of this century. When empty she drew seven feet of\nwater, and when laden fourteen.\n\nWith regard to the engine, it was of considerable power. To speak\nexactly, its power was equal to that of one horse to every three tons\nburden, which is almost equal to that of a tugboat. The paddles were\nwell placed, a little in advance of the centre of gravity of the vessel.\nThe maximum pressure of the engine was equal to two atmospheres. It\nconsumed a great deal of coal, although it was constructed on the\ncondensation and expansion principles. It had no fly-wheel on account of\nthe instability of the point of support, but this was then, as now,\ncompensated for by two cranks at the extremities of the revolving shaft,\nso arranged that one was always at right angles when the other was at\ndead-point. The whole rested on a single sheet of cast-iron, so that\neven in case of any serious damage, no shock of the waves could upset\nits equilibrium, and even if the hull were injured the engine would\nremain intact. To render it stronger still, the connecting-rod had been\nplaced near the steam-cylinders, so that the centre of oscillation of\nthe working-beam was transferred from the middle to the end. Since then\noscillating cylinders have been invented which do away with the\nnecessity of connecting-rods, but in those days the placing of the\nconnecting-rod near the cylinder was thought a triumph of engineering.\nThe boiler was in sections and provided with a salt-water pump. The\nwheels were very large, which lessened the loss of power; the\nsmoke-stack was lofty, which increased the draught. On the other hand,\nthe size of the wheels exposed them to the force of the waves, and the\nheight of the smoke-stack to the violence of the wind. Wooden\npaddle-floats, iron clamps, bosses of cast-iron--such were the wheels,\nwhich, well constructed, could, strange though it may seem, be taken to\npieces. Three floats were always under water. The speed of the centre of\nthe floats only exceeded by a sixth the speed of the vessel itself; this\nwas the chief defect of the wheels. Moreover, the cranks were too long,\nand the slide-valve caused too much friction in the admission of steam\ninto the cylinder. For that period the engine seemed, and indeed was,\nadmirable. It had been constructed in France, at the works at Bercy.\nMess Lethierry had roughly sketched it: the engineer who had constructed\nit in accordance with his diagram was dead, so that the engine was\nunique, and probably could not have been replaced. The designer still\nlived, but the constructor was no more.\n\nThe engine had cost forty thousand francs.\n\nLethierry had himself constructed the \"Devil Boat\" upon the great\ncovered stocks by the side of the first tower between St. Peter's Port\nand St. Sampson. He had been to Br\u00c3\u00aame to buy the wood. All his skill as\na shipwright was exhausted in its construction; his ingenuity might be\nseen in the planks, the seams of which were straight and even, and\ncovered with sarangousti, an Indian mastic, better than resin. The\nsheathing was well beaten. To remedy the roundness of the hull,\nLethierry had fitted out a boom at the bowsprit, which allowed him to\nadd a false spritsail to the regular one. On the day of the launch, he\ncried aloud, \"At last I am afloat!\" The vessel was successful, in fact,\nas the reader has already learnt.\n\nEither by chance or design she had been launched on the 14th of July,\nthe anniversary of the taking of the Bastille. On that day, mounted upon\nthe bridge between the two paddle-boxes, looked Lethierry upon the sea,\nand exclaimed, \"It is your turn now! The Parisians took the Bastille,\nnow science takes the sea.\"\n\nLethierry's boat made the voyage from Guernsey to St. Malo once a week.\nShe started on the Tuesday morning, and returned on the Friday evening,\nin time for the Saturday market. She was a stronger craft than any of\nthe largest coasting sloops in all the Archipelago, and her capacity\nbeing in proportion to her dimensions, one of her voyages was equal to\nfour voyages of an ordinary boat in the same trade; hence they were very\nprofitable. The reputation of a vessel depends on its stowage, and\nLethierry was an admirable stower of cargo. When he was no longer able\nto work himself, he trained up a sailor to undertake this duty. At the\nend of two years, the steamboat brought in a clear seven hundred and\nfifty pounds sterling a year, or eighteen thousand francs. The pound\nsterling of Guernsey is worth twenty-four francs only, that of England\ntwenty-five, and that of Jersey twenty-six. These differences are less\nunimportant than they seem: the banks, at all events, know how to turn\nthem to advantage.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nLETHIERRY'S EXALTATION\n\n\nThe \"Devil Boat\" prospered. Mess Lethierry began to look forward to the\ntime when he should be called \"Monsieur.\" At Guernsey, people do not\nbecome \"Monsieurs\" at one bound. Between the plain man and the\ngentleman, there is quite a scale to climb. To begin with, we have the\nsimple name, plain \"Peter,\" let us suppose; the second step is\n\"Neighbour Peter;\" the third, \"Father Peter;\" the fourth, \"Sieur Peter;\"\nthe fifth, \"Mess Peter;\" and then we reach the summit in \"Monsieur\nPeter.\"\n\nThis scale ascending thus from the ground is carried to still greater\nheights. All the upper classes of England join on and continue it. Here\nare the various steps, becoming more and more glorious. Above the\nMonsieur, or \"Mr.,\" there is the \"Esquire;\" above the squire, the\nknight; above the knight, still rising, we have the baronet, the Scotch\nlaird, the baron, the viscount, the earl (called count in France, and\njarl in Norway); the marquis, the duke, the prince of the blood royal,\nand the king: so, by degrees, we ascend from the people to the middle\nclass, from the middle class to the baronetage, from the baronetage to\nthe peerage, from the peerage to royalty.\n\nThanks to his successful ingenuity, thanks to steam, and his engines,\nand the \"Devil Boat,\" Mess Lethierry was fast becoming an important\npersonage. When building his vessel he had been compelled to borrow\nmoney. He had become indebted at Br\u00c3\u00aame, he had become indebted at St.\nMalo; but every year he diminished his obligations.\n\nHe had, moreover, purchased on credit, at the very entrance to the port\nof St. Sampson, a pretty stone-built house, entirely new, situate\nbetween the sea and a garden. On the corner of this house was inscribed\nthe name of the \"Brav\u00c3\u00a9es.\" Its front formed a part of the wall of the\nport itself, and it was remarkable for a double row of windows: on the\nnorth, alongside a little enclosure filled with flowers, and on the\nsouth commanding a view of the ocean. It had thus two _fa\u00c3\u00a7ades_, one\nopen to the tempest and the sea, the other looking into a garden filled\nwith roses.\n\nThese two frontages seemed made for the two inmates of the house--Mess\nLethierry and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThe \"Brav\u00c3\u00a9es\" was popular at St. Sampson, for Mess Lethierry had at\nlength become a popular man. This popularity was due partly to his good\nnature, his devotedness, and his courage; partly to the number of lives\nhe had saved; and a great deal to his success, and to the fact that he\nhad awarded to St. Sampson the honour of being the port of the departure\nand arrival of the new steamboat. Having made the discovery that the\n\"Devil Boat\" was decidedly a success, St. Peter's, the capital, desired\nto obtain it for that port, but Lethierry held fast to St. Sampson. It\nwas his native town. \"It was there that I was first pitched into the\nwater,\" he used to say; hence his great local popularity. His position\nas a small landed proprietor paying land-tax, made him, what they call\nin Guernsey, an _unhabitant_. He was chosen douzenier. The poor sailor\nhad mounted five out of six steps of the Guernsey social scale; he had\nattained the dignity of \"Mess\"; he was rapidly approaching the Monsieur;\nand who could predict whether he might not even rise higher than that?\nwho could say that they might not one day find in the almanack of\nGuernsey, under the heading of \"Nobility and Gentry,\" the astonishing\nand superb inscription,--_Lethierry, Esq._?\n\nBut Mess Lethierry had nothing of vanity in his nature, or he had no\nsense of it; or if he had, disdained it: to know that he was useful was\nhis greatest pleasure; to be popular touched him less than being\nnecessary; he had, as we have already said, only two objects of delight,\nand consequently only two ambitions: the Durande and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nHowever this may have been, he had embarked in the lottery of the sea,\nand had gained the chief prize.\n\nThis chief prize was the Durande steaming away in all her pride.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE SAME GODFATHER AND THE SAME PATRON SAINT\n\n\nHaving created his steamboat, Lethierry had christened it: he had called\nit Durande--\"La Durande.\" We will speak of her henceforth by no other\nname; we will claim the liberty, also, in spite of typographical usage,\nof not italicising this name Durande; conforming in this to the notion\nof Mess Lethierry, in whose eyes La Durande was almost a living person.\n\nDurande and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette are the same name. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette is the diminutive.\n\nThis diminutive is very common in France.\n\nIn the country the names of saints are endowed with all these\ndiminutives as well as all their augmentatives. One might suppose there\nwere several persons when there is, in fact, only one. This system of\npatrons and patronesses under different names is by no means rare. Lise,\nLisette, Lisa, Elisa, Isabelle, Lisbeth, Betsy, all these are simply\nElizabeth. It is probable that Mahout, Maclou, Malo, and Magloire are\nthe same saint: this, however, we do not vouch for.\n\nSaint Durande is a saint of l'Angoumois, and of the Charente; whether\nshe is an orthodox member of the calendar is a question for the\nBollandists: orthodox or not, she has been made the patron saint of\nnumerous chapels.\n\nIt was while Lethierry was a young sailor at Rochefort that he had made\nthe acquaintance of this saint, probably in the person of some pretty\nCharantaise, perhaps in that of the grisette with the white nails. The\nsaint had remained sufficiently in his memory for him to give the name\nto the two things which he loved most--Durande to the steamboat,\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette to the girl.\n\nOf one he was the father, of the other the uncle.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was the daughter of a brother who had died: she was an orphan\nchild: he had adopted her, and had taken the place both of father and\nmother.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was not only his niece, she was his godchild; he had held her\nin his arms at the baptismal font; it was he who had chosen her patron\nsaint, Durande, and her Christian name, D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, as we have said, was born at St. Peter's Port. Her name was\ninscribed at its date on the register of the parish.\n\nAs long as the niece was a child, and the uncle poor, nobody took heed\nof her appellation of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; but when the little girl became a\nmiss, and the sailor a gentleman, the name of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette shocked the\nfeelings of Guernsey society. The uncouthness of the sound astonished\nevery one. Folks asked Mess Lethierry \"why D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette?\" He answered, \"It\nis a very good name in its way.\" Several attempts were made to get him\nto obtain a change in the baptismal name, but he would be no party to\nthem. One day, a fine lady of the upper circle of society in St.\nSampson, the wife of a rich retired ironfounder, said to Mess Lethierry,\n\"In future, I shall call your daughter Nancy.\"\n\n\"If names of country towns are in fashion,\" said he, \"why not Lons le\nSaulnier?\" The fine lady did not yield her point, and on the morrow\nsaid, \"We are determined not to have it D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; I have found for\nyour daughter a pretty name--_Marianne_.\" \"A very pretty name, indeed,\"\nreplied Mess Lethierry, \"composed of two words which signify--a husband\nand an ass.\"[4] He held fast to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nIt would be a mistake to infer from Lethierry's pun that he had no wish\nto see his niece married. He desired to see her married, certainly; but\nin his own way: he intended her to have a husband after his own heart,\none who would work hard, and whose wife would have little to do. He\nliked rough hands in a man, and delicate ones in a woman. To prevent\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette spoiling her pretty hands he had always brought her up like a\nyoung lady; he had provided her with a music-master, a piano, a little\nlibrary, and a few needles and threads in a pretty work-basket. She was,\nindeed, more often reading than stitching; more often playing than\nreading. This was as Mess Lethierry wished it. To be charming was all\nthat he expected of her. He had reared the young girl like a flower.\nWhoever has studied the character of sailors will understand this: rude\nand hard in their nature, they have an odd partiality for grace and\ndelicacy. To realise the idea of the uncle, the niece ought to have been\nrich; so indeed felt Mess Lethierry. His steamboat voyaged for this end.\nThe mission of Durande was to provide a marriage portion for D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[4] A play upon the French words, _mari_ and _ane_.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\"BONNIE DUNDEE\"\n\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette occupied the prettiest room at the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es. It had two\nwindows, was furnished with various articles made of fine-grained\nmahogany, had a bed with four curtains, green and white, and looked out\nupon the garden, and beyond it towards the high hill, on which stands\nthe Vale Castle. Gilliatt's house, the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue, was on the other\nside of this hill.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had her music and piano in this chamber; she accompanied\nherself on the instrument when singing the melody which she\npreferred--the melancholy Scottish air of \"Bonnie Dundee.\" The very\nspirit of night breathes in this melody; but her voice was full of the\nfreshness of dawn. The contrast was quaint and pleasing; people said,\n\"Miss D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette is at her piano.\"\n\nThe passers-by at the foot of the hill stopped sometimes before the wall\nof the garden of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es to listen to that sweet voice and plaintive\nsong.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was the very embodiment of joy as she went to and fro in the\nhouse. She brought with her a perpetual spring. She was beautiful, but\nmore pretty than beautiful; and still more graceful than pretty. She\nreminded the good old pilots, friends of Mess Lethierry, of that\nprincess in the song which the soldiers and sailors sing, who was so\nbeautiful:\n\n    \"Qu'elle passait pour telle dans le regiment.\"\n\nMess Lethierry used to say, \"She has a head of hair like a ship's\ncable.\"\n\nFrom her infancy she had been remarkable for beauty. The learned in such\nmatters had grave doubts about her nose, but the little one having\nprobably determined to be pretty, had finally satisfied their\nrequirements. She grew to girlhood without any serious loss of beauty;\nher nose became neither too long nor too short; and when grown up, her\ncritics admitted her to be charming.\n\nShe never addressed her uncle otherwise than as father.\n\nLethierry allowed her to soil her fingers a little in gardening, and\neven in some kind of household duties: she watered her beds of pink\nhollyhocks, purple foxgloves, perennial phloxes, and scarlet herb\nbennets. She took good advantage of the climate of Guernsey, so\nfavourable to flowers. She had, like many other persons there, aloes in\nthe open ground, and, what is more difficult, she succeeded in\ncultivating the Nepaulese cinquefoil. Her little kitchen-garden was\nscientifically arranged; she was able to produce from it several kinds\nof rare vegetables. She sowed Dutch cauliflower and Brussels cabbages,\nwhich she thinned out in July, turnips for August, endive for September,\nshort parsnip for the autumn, and rampions for winter. Mess Lethierry\ndid not interfere with her in this, so long as she did not handle the\nspade and rake too much, or meddle with the coarser kinds of garden\nlabour. He had provided her with two servants, one named Grace, and the\nother Douce, which are favourite names in Guernsey. Grace and Douce did\nthe hard work of the house and garden, and they had the right to have\nred hands.\n\nWith regard to Mess Lethierry, his room was a little retreat with a view\nover the harbour, and communicating with the great lower room of the\nground floor, on which was situated the door of the house, near which\nthe various staircases met.\n\nHis room was furnished with his hammock, his chronometer, and his pipe:\nthere were also a table and a chair. The ceiling had been whitewashed,\nas well as the four walls. A fine marine map, bearing the inscription\n_W. Faden_, 5 Charing Cross, Geographer to His Majesty, and representing\nthe Channel Islands, was nailed up at the side of the door, and on the\nleft, stretched out and fastened with other nails, appeared one of those\nlarge cotton handkerchiefs on which are printed, in colours, the signals\nof all countries in the world, having at the four corners the standards\nof France, Russia, Spain, and the United States, and in the centre the\nunion-jack of England.\n\nDouce and Grace were two faithful creatures within certain limits. Douce\nwas good-natured enough, and Grace was probably good-looking. Douce was\nunmarried, and had secretly \"a gallant.\" In the Channel Islands the word\nis common, as indeed is the fact itself. The two girl's regarded as\nservants had something of the Creole in their character, a sort of\nslowness in their movements, not out of keeping with the Norman spirit\npervading the relations of servant and master in the Channel Islands.\nGrace, coquettish and good-looking, was always scanning the future with\na nervous anxiety. This arose from the fact of her not only having, like\nDouce, \"a gallant,\" but also, as the scandal-loving averred, a sailor\nhusband, whose return one day was a thing she dreaded. This, however,\ndoes not concern us. In a household less austere and less innocent,\nDouce would have continued to be the servant, but Grace would have\nbecome the _soubrette_. The dangerous talents of Grace were lost upon a\nyoung mistress so pure and good as D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. For the rest, the\nintrigues of Douce and Grace were cautiously concealed. Mess Lethierry\nknew nothing of such matters, and no token of them had ever reached\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThe lower room of the ground floor, a hall with a large fireplace and\nsurrounded with benches and tables, had served in the last century as a\nmeeting-place for a conventicle of French Protestant refugees. The sole\nornament of the bare stone wall was a sheet of parchment, set in a frame\nof black wood, on which were represented some of the charitable deeds of\nthe great Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux. Some poor diocesans of this famous\norator, surnamed the \"Eagle,\" persecuted by him at the time of the\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes, and driven to take shelter at\nGuernsey, had hung this picture on the wall to preserve the remembrance\nof those facts. The spectator who had the patience to decipher a rude\nhandwriting in faded ink might have learnt the following facts, which\nare but little known:--\"29th October, 1685, Monsieur the Bishop of\nMeaux, appeals to the king to destroy the temples of Morcef and\nNanteuil\"--\"2nd April, 1686, Arrest of Cochard, father and son, for\ntheir religious opinions, at the request of Monsieur the Bishop of\nMeaux. Released: the Cochards having recanted.\"--\"28th October, 1699,\nMonsieur the Bishop of Meaux sent to Mde. Pontchartrain a petition of\nremonstrance, pointing out that it will be necessary to place the young\nladies named Chalandes and de Neuville, who are of the reformed\nreligion, in the House of the 'New Catholics' at Paris.\"--\"7th July,\n1703, the king's order executed as requested by Monsieur the Bishop of\nMeaux, for shutting up in an asylum Baudouin and his wife, two bad\nCatholics of Fublaines.\"\n\nAt the end of the hall, near the door of Mess Lethierry's room, was a\nlittle corner with a wooden partition, which had been the Huguenot's\nsanctum, and had become, thanks to its row of rails and a small hole to\npass paper or money through, the steamboat office; that is to say, the\noffice of the Durande, kept by Mess Lethierry in person. Upon the old\noaken reading-desk, where once rested the Holy Bible, lay a great ledger\nwith its alternate pages headed Dr. and Cr.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE MAN WHO DISCOVERED RANTAINE'S CHARACTER\n\n\nAs long as Mess Lethierry had been able to do duty, he had commanded the\nDurande, and had had no other pilot or captain but himself; but a time\nhad come, as we have said, when he had been compelled to find a\nsuccessor. He had chosen for that purpose Sieur Clubin, of Torteval, a\ntaciturn man. Sieur Clubin had a character upon the coast for strict\nprobity. He became the _alter ego_, the double, of Mess Lethierry.\n\nSieur Clubin, although he had rather the look of a notary than of a\nsailor, was a mariner of rare skill. He had all the talents which are\nrequired to meet dangers of every kind. He was a skilful stower, a safe\nman aloft, an able and careful boatswain, a powerful steersman, an\nexperienced pilot, and a bold captain. He was prudent, and he carried\nhis prudence sometimes to the point of daring, which is a great quality\nat sea. His natural apprehensiveness of danger was tempered by a strong\ninstinct of what was possible in an emergency. He was one of those\nmariners who will face risks to a point perfectly well known to\nthemselves, and who generally manage to come successfully out of every\nperil. Every certainty which a man can command, dealing with so fickle\nan element as the sea, he possessed. Sieur Clubin, moreover, was a\nrenowned swimmer; he was one of that race of men broken into the\nbuffeting of the waves, who can remain as long as they please in the\nwater--who can start from the Havre-des-Pas at Jersey, double the\nColettes, swim round the Hermitage and Castle Elizabeth, and return in\ntwo hours to the point from which they started. He came from Torteval,\nwhere he had the reputation of often having swum across the passage so\nmuch dreaded, from the Hanway rocks to the point of Pleinmont.\n\nOne circumstance which had recommended Sieur Clubin to Mess Lethierry\nmore than any other, was his having judged correctly the character of\nRantaine. He had pointed out to Lethierry the dishonesty of the man, and\nhad said \"Rantaine will rob you.\" His prediction was verified. More than\nonce--in matters, it is true, not very important--Mess Lethierry had put\nhis ever-scrupulous honesty to the proof; and he freely communicated\nwith him on the subject of his affairs. Mess Lethierry used to say, \"A\ngood conscience expects to be treated with perfect confidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nLONG YARNS\n\n\nMess Lethierry, for the sake of his own ease, always wore his seafaring\nclothes, and preferred his tarpaulin overcoat to his pilot jacket.\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette felt vexed, occasionally, about this peculiarity. Nothing is\nprettier than a pouting beauty. She laughed and scolded. \"My dear\nfather,\" she would say, \"what a smell of pitch!\" and she would give him\na gentle tap upon his broad shoulders.\n\nThis good old seaman had gathered from his voyages many wonderful\nstories. He had seen at Madagascar birds' feathers, three of which\nsufficed to make a roof of a house. He had seen in India, field sorrel,\nthe stalks of which were nine inches high. In New Holland he had seen\ntroops of turkeys and geese led about and guarded by a bird, like a\nflock by a shepherd's dog; this bird was called the Agami. He had\nvisited elephants' cemeteries. In Africa, he had encountered gorillas, a\nterrible species of man-monkey. He knew the ways of all the ape tribe,\nfrom the wild dog-faced monkey, which he called the Macaco-bravo, to the\nhowling monkey or _Macaco-barbado_. In Chili, he had seen a pouched\nmonkey move the compassion of the huntsman by showing its little one. He\nhad seen in California a hollow trunk of a tree fall to the ground, so\nvast that a man on horseback could ride one hundred paces inside. In\nMorocco, he had seen the Mozabites and the Bisskris fighting with\nmatraks and bars of iron--the Bisskris, because they had been called\n_kelbs_, which means dogs; and the Mozabites, because they had been\ntreated as _khamsi_, which means people of the fifth sect. He had seen\nin China the pirate Chanh-thong-quan-larh-Quoi cut to pieces for having\nassassinated the Ap of a village. At Thu-dan-mot, he had seen a lion\ncarry off an old woman in the open market-place. He was present at the\narrival of the Great Serpent brought from Canton to Saigon to celebrate\nin the pagoda of Cho-len the f\u00c3\u00aate of Quan-nam, the goddess of\nnavigators. He had beheld the great Quan-S\u00c3\u00bb among the Moi. At Rio de\nJaneiro, he had seen the Brazilian ladies in the evening put little\nballs of gauze into their hair, each containing a beautiful kind of\nfirefly; and the whole forming a head-dress of little twinkling lights.\nHe had combated in Paraguay with swarms of enormous ants and spiders,\nbig and downy as an infant's head, and compassing with their long legs\na third of a yard, and attacking men by pricking them with their\nbristles, which enter the skin as sharp as arrows, and raise painful\nblisters. On the river Arinos, a tributary of the Tocantins, in the\nvirgin forests to the north of Diamantina, he had determined the\nexistence of the famous bat-shaped people, the Murcilagos, or men who\nare born with white hair and red eyes, who live in the shady solitudes\nof the woods, sleep by day, awake by night, and fish and hunt in the\ndark, seeing better then than by the light of the moon. He told how,\nnear Beyrout, once in an encampment of an expedition of which he formed\npart, a rain gauge belonging to one of the party happened to be stolen\nfrom a tent. A wizard, wearing two or three strips of leather only, and\nlooking like a man having nothing on but his braces, thereupon rang a\nbell at the end of a horn so violently, that a hyena finally answered\nthe summons by bringing back the missing instrument. The hyena was, in\nfact, the thief. These veritable histories bore a strong resemblance to\nfictions; but they amused D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThe _poup\u00c3\u00a9e_ or \"doll\" of the Durande, as the people of the Channel\nIslands call the figure-head of a ship, was the connecting link between\nthe vessel and Lethierry's niece. In the Norman Islands the figure-head\nof a ship, a roughly-carved wooden statue, is called the Poup\u00c3\u00a9e. Hence\nthe local saying, meaning to sail, \"_\u00c3\u00aatre entre poupe et poup\u00c3\u00a9e_.\"\n\nThe _poup\u00c3\u00a9e_ of the Durande was particularly dear to Mess Lethierry. He\nhad instructed the carver to make it resemble D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. It looked like\na rude attempt to cut out a face with a hatchet; or like a clumsy log\ntrying hard to look like a girl.\n\nThis unshapely block produced a great effect upon Mess Lethierry's\nimagination. He looked upon it with an almost superstitious admiration.\nHis faith in it was complete. He was able to trace in it an excellent\nresemblance to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Thus the dogma resembles the truth, and the\nidol the deity.\n\nMess Lethierry had two grand f\u00c3\u00aate days in every week; one was Tuesday,\nthe other Friday. His first delight consisted in seeing the Durande\nweigh anchor; his second in seeing her enter the port again. He leaned\nupon his elbows at the window contemplating his work, and was happy.\n\nOn Fridays, the presence of Mess Lethierry at his window was a signal.\nWhen people passing the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es saw him lighting his pipe, they said,\n\"Ay! the steamboat is in sight.\" One kind of smoke was the herald of the\nother.\n\nThe Durande, when she entered the port, made her cable fast to a huge\niron ring under Mess Lethierry's window, and fixed in the basement of\nthe house. On those nights Lethierry slept soundly in his hammock, with\na soothing consciousness of the presence of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette asleep in her\nroom near him, and of the Durande moored opposite.\n\nThe moorings of the Durande were close to the great bell of the port. A\nlittle strip of quay passed thence before the door of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\nThe quay, the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es and its house, the garden, the alleys bordered\nwith edges, and the greater part even of the surrounding houses, no\nlonger exist. The demand for Guernsey granite has invaded these too. The\nwhole of this part of the town is now occupied by stone-cutters' yards.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nMATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS\n\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was approaching womanhood, and was still unmarried.\n\nMess Lethierry in bringing her up to have white hands had also rendered\nher somewhat fastidious. A training of that kind has its disadvantages;\nbut Lethierry was himself still more fastidious. He would have liked to\nhave provided at the same time for both his idols; to have found in the\nguide and companion of the one a commander for the other. What is a\nhusband but the pilot on the voyage of matrimony? Why not then the same\nconductor for the vessel and for the girl? The affairs of a household\nhave their tides, their ebbs and flows, and he who knows how to steer a\nbark, ought to know how to guide a woman's destiny, subject as both are\nto the influences of the moon and the wind. Sieur Clubin being only\nfifteen years younger than Lethierry, would necessarily be only a\nprovisional master for the Durande. It would be necessary to find a\nyoung captain, a permanent master, a true successor of the founder,\ninventor, and creator of the first channel steamboat. A captain for the\nDurande who should come up to his ideal, would have been, already,\nalmost a son-in-law in Lethierry's eyes. Why not make him son-in-law in\na double sense? The idea pleased him. The husband _in posse_ of\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette haunted his dreams. His ideal was a powerful seaman, tanned\nand browned by weather, a sea athlete. This, however, was not exactly\nthe ideal of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Her dreams, if dreams they could even be\ncalled, were of a more ethereal character.\n\nThe uncle and the niece were at all events agreed in not being in haste\nto seek a solution of these problems. When D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette began to be\nregarded as a probable heiress, a crowd of suitors had presented\nthemselves. Attentions under these circumstances are not generally worth\nmuch. Mess Lethierry felt this. He would grumble out the old French\nproverb, \"_A maiden of gold, a suitor of brass_.\" He politely showed the\nfortune-seekers to the door. He was content to wait, and so was\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nIt was, perhaps, a singular fact, that he had little inclination for the\nlocal aristocracy. In that respect Mess Lethierry showed himself not\nentirely English. It will hardly be believed that he even refused for\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette a Ganduel of Jersey, and a Bugnet Nicolin of Sark. People\nwere bold enough to affirm, although we doubt if this were possible,\nthat he had even declined the proposals of a member of the family of\nEdou, which is evidently descended from \"Edou-ard\" (Anglic\u00c3\u00a8 Edward) the\nConfessor.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nAN ANOMALY IN THE CHARACTER OF LETHIERRY\n\n\nMess Lethierry had a failing, and a serious one. He detested a priest;\nthough not as an individual, but as an institution. Reading one day--for\nhe used to read--in a work of Voltaire--for he would even read\nVoltaire--the remark, that priests \"have something cat-like in their\nnature,\" he laid down the book and was heard to mutter, \"Then, I\nsuppose, I have something dog-like in mine.\"\n\nIt must be remembered that the priests--Lutheran and Calvinist, as well\nas Catholic--had vigorously combated the new \"Devil Boat,\" and had\npersecuted its inventor. To be a sort of revolutionist in the art of\nnavigation, to introduce a spirit of progress in the Norman Archipelago,\nto disturb the peace of the poor little island of Guernsey with a new\ninvention, was in their eyes, as we have not concealed from the reader,\nan abominable and most condemnable rashness. Nor had they omitted to\ncondemn it pretty loudly. It must not be forgotten that we are now\nspeaking of the Guernsey clergy of a bygone generation, very different\nfrom that of the present time, who in almost all the local places of\nworship display a laudable sympathy with progress. They had embarrassed\nLethierry in a hundred ways; every sort of resisting force which can be\nfound in sermons and discourses had been employed against him. Detested\nby the churchmen, he naturally came to detest them in his turn. Their\nhatred was the extenuating circumstance to be taken into account in\njudging of his.\n\nBut it must be confessed that his dislike for priests was, in some\ndegree, in his very nature. It was hardly necessary for them to hate him\nin order to inspire him with aversion. As he said, he moved among them\nlike the dog among cats. He had an antipathy to them, not only in idea,\nbut in what is more difficult to analyse, his instincts. He felt their\nsecret claws, and showed his teeth; sometimes, it must be confessed, a\nlittle at random and out of season. It is a mistake to make no\ndistinctions: a dislike in the mass is a prejudice. The good Savoyard\ncur\u00c3\u00a9 would have found no favour in his eyes. It is not certain that a\nworthy priest was even a possible thing in Lethierry's mind. His\nphilosophy was carried so far that his good sense sometimes abandoned\nhim. There is such a thing as the intolerance of tolerants, as well as\nthe violence of moderates. But Lethierry was at bottom too good-natured\nto be a thorough hater. He did not attack so much as avoid. He kept the\nchurch people at a distance. He suffered evil at their hands; but he\nconfined himself to not wishing them any good. The shade of difference,\nin fact, between his aversion and theirs, lay in the fact that they bore\nanimosity, while he had only a strong antipathy. Small as is the island\nof Guernsey, it has, unfortunately, plenty of room for differences of\nreligion; there, to take the broad distinction, is the Catholic faith\nand the Protestant faith; every form of worship has its temple or\nchapel. In Germany, at Heidelberg, for example, people are not so\nparticular; they divide a church in two, one half for St. Peter, the\nother half for Calvin, and between the two is a partition to prevent\nreligious variances terminating in fisticuffs. The shares are equal; the\nCatholics have three altars, the Huguenots three altars. As the services\nare at the same hours, one bell summonses both denominations to prayers;\nit rings, in fact, both for God and for Satan, according as each pleases\nto regard it. Nothing can be more simple.\n\nThe phlegmatic character of the Germans favours, I suppose, this\npeculiar arrangement, but in Guernsey every religion has its own\ndomicile; there is the orthodox parish and the heretic parish; the\nindividual may choose. \"Neither one nor the other\" was the choice of\nMess Lethierry.\n\nThis sailor, workman, philosopher, and parvenu trader, though a simple\nman in appearance, was by no means simple at bottom. He had his opinions\nand his prejudices. On the subject of the priests he was immovable; he\nwould have entered the lists with Montlosier.\n\nOccasionally he indulged in rather disrespectful jokes upon this\nsubject. He had certain odd expressions thereupon peculiar to himself,\nbut significant enough. Going to confession he called \"combing one's\nconscience.\" The little learning that he had--a certain amount of\nreading picked up here and there between the squalls at sea--did not\nprevent his making blunders in spelling. He made also mistakes in\npronunciation, some of which, however, gave a double sense to his words,\nwhich might have been suspected of a sly intention. After peace had been\nbrought about by Waterloo between the France of Louis XVIII. and the\nEngland of Wellington, Mess Lethierry was heard to say, \"Bour mont a \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9\nle tra\u00c3\u00aetre d'union entre les deux camps.\" On one occasion he wrote _pape\n\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9_ for _papaut\u00c3\u00a9_. We do not think these puns were intentional.\n\nThough he was a strong anti-papist, that circumstance was far from\nconciliating the Anglicans. He was no more liked by the Protestant\nrectors than by the Catholic cur\u00c3\u00a9s. The enunciation of the greatest\ndogmas did not prevent his anti-theological temper bursting forth.\nAccident, for example, having once brought him to hear a sermon on\neternal punishment, by the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode--a magnificent\ndiscourse, filled from one end to the other with sacred texts, proving\nthe everlasting pains, the tortures, the torments, the perditions, the\ninexorable chastisements, the burnings without end, the inextinguishable\nmaledictions, the wrath of the Almighty, the celestial fury, the divine\nvengeance, and other incontestable realities--he was heard to say as he\nwas going out in the midst of the faithful flock, \"You see, I have an\nodd notion of my own on this matter; I imagine God as a merciful being.\"\n\nThis leaven of atheism was doubtless due to his sojourn in France.\n\nAlthough a Guernsey man of pure extraction, he was called in the island\n\"the Frenchman;\" but chiefly on account of his \"improper\" manner of\nspeaking. He did not indeed conceal the truth from himself. He was\nimpregnated with ideas subversive of established institutions. His\nobstinacy in constructing the \"Devil Boat\" had proved that. He used to\nsay, \"I was suckled by the '89\"--a bad sort of nurse. These were not his\nonly indiscretions. In France \"to preserve appearances,\" in England \"to\nbe respectable,\" is the chief condition of a quiet life. To be\nrespectable implies a multitude of little observances, from the strict\nkeeping of Sunday down to the careful tying of a cravat. \"To act so that\nnobody may point at you;\" this is the terrible social law. To be pointed\nat with the finger is almost the same thing as an anathematisation.\nLittle towns, always hotbeds of gossip, are remarkable for that\nisolating malignancy, which is like the tremendous malediction of the\nChurch seen through the wrong end of the telescope. The bravest are\nafraid of this ordeal. They are ready to confront the storm, the fire of\ncannon, but they shrink at the glance of \"Mrs. Grundy.\" Mess Lethierry\nwas more obstinate than logical; but under pressure even his obstinacy\nwould bend. He put--to use another of his phrases, eminently suggestive\nof latent compromises, not always pleasant to avow--\"a little water in\nhis wine.\" He kept aloof from the clergy, but he did not absolutely\nclose his door against them. On official occasions, and at the customary\nepochs of pastoral visits, he received with sufficiently good grace both\nthe Lutheran rector and the Papist chaplain. He had even, though at\ndistant intervals, accompanied D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette to the Anglican parish church,\nto which D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette herself, as we have said, only went on the four\ngreat festivals of the year.\n\nOn the whole, these little concessions, which always cost him a pang,\nirritated him; and far from inclining him towards the Church people,\nonly increased his inward disinclination to them. He compensated himself\nby more raillery. His nature, in general so devoid of bitterness, had no\nuncharitable side except this. To alter him, however, was impossible.\n\nIn fact, this was in his very temperament, and was beyond his own power\nto control.\n\nEvery sort of priest or clergyman was distasteful to him. He had a\nlittle of the old revolutionary want of reverence. He did not\ndistinguish between one form of worship and another. He did not do\njustice to that great step in the progress of ideas, the denial of the\nreal presence. His shortsightedness in these matters even prevented his\nperceiving any essential difference between a minister and an abb\u00c3\u00a9. A\nreverend doctor and a reverend father were pretty nearly the same to\nhim. He used to say, \"Wesley is not more to my taste than Loyola.\" When\nhe saw a reverend pastor walking with his wife, he would turn to look at\nthem, and mutter, \"a married priest,\" in a tone which brought out all\nthe absurdity which those words had in the ears of Frenchmen at that\ntime. He used to relate how, on his last voyage to England, he had seen\nthe \"Bishop_ess_\" of London. His dislike for marriages of that sort\namounted almost to disgust. \"Gown and gown do not mate well,\" he would\nsay. The sacerdotal function was to him in the nature of a distinct sex.\nIt would have been natural to him to have said, \"Neither a man nor a\nwoman, only a priest;\" and he had the bad taste to apply to the Anglican\nand the Roman Catholic clergy the same disdainful epithets. He\nconfounded the two cassocks in the same phraseology. He did not take the\ntrouble to vary in favour of Catholics or Lutherans, or whatever they\nmight be, the figures of speech common among military men of that\nperiod. He would say to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, \"Marry whom you please, provided you\ndo not marry a parson.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHOUGHTLESSNESS ADDS A GRACE TO BEAUTY\n\n\nA word once said, Mess Lethierry remembered it: a word once said,\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette soon forgot it. Here was another difference between the uncle\nand the niece.\n\nBrought up in the peculiar way already described, D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was little\naccustomed to responsibility. There is a latent danger in an education\nnot sufficiently serious, which cannot be too much insisted on. It is\nperhaps unwise to endeavour to make a child happy too soon.\n\nSo long as she was happy, D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette thought all was well. She knew,\ntoo, that it was always a pleasure to her uncle to see her pleased. The\nreligious sentiment in her nature was satisfied with going to the parish\nchurch four times in the year. We have seen her in her Christmas-day\ntoilet. Of life, she was entirely ignorant. She had a disposition which\none day might lead her to love passionately. Meanwhile she was\ncontented.\n\nShe sang by fits and starts, chatted by fits and starts, enjoyed the\nhour as it passed, fulfilled some little duty, and was gone again, and\nwas delightful in all. Add to all this the English sort of liberty which\nshe enjoyed. In England the very infants go alone, girls are their own\nmistresses, and adolescence is almost wholly unrestrained. Such are the\ndifferences of manners. Later, how many of these free maidens become\nfemale slaves? I use the word in its least odious sense; I mean that\nthey are free in the development of their nature, but slaves to duty.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette awoke every morning with little thought of her actions of the\nday before. It would have troubled her a good deal to have had to give\nan account of how she had spent her time the previous week. All this,\nhowever, did not prevent her having certain hours of strange\ndisquietude; times when some dark cloud seemed to pass over the\nbrightness of her joy. Those azure depths are subject to such shadows!\nBut clouds like these soon passed away. She quickly shook off such moods\nwith a cheerful laugh, knowing neither why she had been sad, nor why she\nhad regained her serenity. She was always at play. As a child, she would\ntake delight in teasing the passers-by. She played practical jokes upon\nthe boys. If the fiend himself had passed that way, she would hardly\nhave spared him some ingenious trick. She was pretty and innocent; and\nshe could abuse the immunity accorded to such qualities. She was ready\nwith a smile, as a cat with a stroke of her claws. So much the worse for\nthe victim of her scratches. She thought no more of them. Yesterday had\nno existence for her. She lived in the fullness of to-day. Such it is to\nhave too much happiness fall to one's lot! With D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette impressions\nvanished like the melted snow.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\nTHE BAGPIPE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nSTREAKS OF FIRE ON THE HORIZON\n\n\nGilliatt had never spoken to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; he knew her from having seen\nher at a distance, as men know the morning star.\n\nAt the period when D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had met Gilliatt on the road leading from\nSt. Peter's Port to Vale, and had surprised him by tracing his name in\nthe snow, she was just sixteen years of age. Only the evening before\nMess Lethierry had said to her, \"Come, no more childish tricks; you are\na great girl.\"\n\nThat word \"Gilliatt,\" written by the young maiden, had sunk into an\nunfathomed depth.\n\nWhat were women to Gilliatt? He could not have answered that question\nhimself. When he met one he generally inspired her with something of the\ntimidity which he felt himself. He never spoke to a woman except from\nurgent necessity. He had never played the part of a \"gallant\" to any one\nof the country girls. When he found himself alone on the road, and\nperceived a woman coming towards him, he would climb over a fence, or\nbury himself in some copse: he even avoided old women. Once in his life\nhe had seen a Parisian lady. A _Parisienne_ on the wing was a strange\nevent in Guernsey at that distant epoch; and Gilliatt had heard this\ngentle lady relate her little troubles in these words: \"I am very much\nannoyed; I have got some spots of rain upon my bonnet. Pale buff is a\nshocking colour for rain.\" Having found, some time afterwards, between\nthe leaves of a book, an old engraving, representing \"a lady of the\nChauss\u00c3\u00a9e d'Antin\" in full dress, he had stuck it against the wall at\nhome as a souvenir of this remarkable apparition.\n\nOn that Christmas morning when he had met D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, and when she had\nwritten his name and disappeared laughing, he returned home, scarcely\nconscious of why he had gone out. That night he slept little; he was\ndreaming of a thousand things: that it would be well to cultivate black\nradishes in the garden; that he had not seen the boat from Sark pass\nby; had anything happened to it? Then he remembered that he had seen the\nwhite stonecrop in flower, a rare thing at that season. He had never\nknown exactly who was the woman who had reared him, and he made up his\nmind that she must have been his mother, and thought of her with\nredoubled tenderness. He called to mind the lady's clothing in the old\nleathern trunk. He thought that the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode would\nprobably one day or other be appointed dean of St. Peter's Port and\nsurrogate of the bishop, and that the rectory of St. Sampson would\nbecome vacant. Next, he remembered that the morrow of Christmas would be\nthe twenty-seventh day of the moon, and that consequently high water\nwould be at twenty-one minutes past three, the half-ebb at a quarter\npast seven, low water at thirty-three minutes past nine, and half flood\nat thirty-nine minutes past twelve. He recalled, in the most trifling\ndetails, the costume of the Highlander who had sold him the bagpipe; his\nbonnet with a thistle ornament, his claymore, his close-fitting short\njacket, his philabeg ornamented with a pocket, and his snuff-horn, his\npin set with a Scottish stone, his two girdles, his sash and belts, his\nsword, cutlass, dirk, and skene-dhu--his black-sheathed knife, with its\nblack handle ornamented with two cairngorms--and the bare knees of the\nsoldier; his socks, gaiters, and buckled shoes. This highly-equipped\nfigure became a spectre in his imagination, which pursued him with a\nsense of feverishness as he sunk into oblivion. When he awoke it was\nfull daylight, and his first thought was of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThe next night he slept more soundly, but he was dreaming again of the\nScottish soldier. In the midst of his sleep he remembered that the\nafter-Christmas sittings of the Chief Law Court would commence on the\n21st of January. He dreamed also about the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode. He\nthought of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, and seemed to be in violent anger with her. He\nwished he had been a child again to throw stones at her windows. Then he\nthought that if he were a child again he should have his mother by his\nside, and he began to sob.\n\nGilliatt had a project at this time of going to pass three months at\nChousey, or at the Miriquiers; but he did not go.\n\nHe walked no more along the road to St. Peter's Port.\n\nHe had an odd fancy that his name of \"Gilliatt\" had remained there\ntraced upon the ground, and that the passers-by stopped to read it.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE UNKNOWN UNFOLDS ITSELF BY DEGREES\n\n\nOn the other hand, Gilliatt had the satisfaction of seeing the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es\nevery day. By some accident he was continually passing that way. His\nbusiness seemed always to lead him by the path which passed under the\nwall of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's garden.\n\nOne morning, as he was walking along this path, he heard a market-woman\nwho was returning from the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, say to another: \"Mess Lethierry is\nfond of sea-kale.\"\n\nHe dug in his garden of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue a trench for sea-kale. The\nsea-kale is a vegetable which has a flavour like asparagus.\n\nThe wall of the garden of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es was very low; it would have been\neasy to scale it. The idea of scaling it would have appeared, to him,\nterrible. But there was nothing to hinder his hearing, as any one else\nmight, the voices of persons talking as he passed, in the rooms or in\nthe garden. He did not listen, but he heard them. Once he could\ndistinguish the voices of the two servants, Grace and Douce, disputing.\nIt was a sound which belonged to the house, and their quarrel remained\nin his ears like a remembrance of music.\n\nOn another occasion, he distinguished a voice which was different, and\nwhich seemed to him to be the voice of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. He quickened his\npace, and was soon out of hearing.\n\nThe words uttered by that voice, however, remained fixed in his memory.\nHe repeated them at every instant. They were, \"Will you please give me\nthe little broom?\"\n\nBy degrees he became bolder. He had the daring to stay awhile. One day\nit happened that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was singing at her piano, altogether\ninvisible from without, although her window was open. The air was that\nof \"Bonnie Dundee.\" He grew pale, but he screwed his courage to the\npoint of listening.\n\nSpringtide came. One day Gilliatt enjoyed a beatific vision. The heavens\nwere opened, and there, before his eyes, appeared D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, watering\nlettuces in her little garden.\n\nSoon afterwards he look to doing more than merely listening there. He\nwatched her habits, observed her hours, and waited to catch a glimpse of\nher.\n\nIn all this he was very careful not to be seen.\n\nThe year advanced; the time came when the trellises were heavy with\nroses, and haunted by the butterflies. By little and little, he had come\nto conceal himself for hours behind her wall, motionless and silent,\nseen by no one, and holding his breath as D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette passed in and out\nof her garden. Men grow accustomed to poison by degrees.\n\nFrom his hiding-place he could often hear the sound of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\nconversing with Mess Lethierry under a thick arch of leaves, in a spot\nwhere there was a garden-seat. The words came distinctly to his ears.\n\nWhat a change had come over him! He had even descended to watch and\nlisten. Alas! there is something of the character of a spy in every\nhuman heart.\n\nThere was another garden-seat, visible to him, and nearer D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\nwould sit there sometimes.\n\nFrom the flowers that he had observed her gathering he had guessed her\ntaste in the matter of perfumes. The scent of the bindweed was her\nfavourite, then the pink, then the honeysuckle, then the jasmine. The\nrose stood only fifth in the scale. She looked at the lilies, but did\nnot smell them.\n\nGilliatt figured her in his imagination from this choice of odours. With\neach perfume he associated some perfection.\n\nThe very idea of speaking to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette would have made his hair stand\non end. A poor old rag-picker, whose wandering brought her, from time to\ntime, into the little road leading under the inclosure of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es,\nhad occasionally remarked Gilliatt's assiduity beside the wall, and his\ndevotion for this retired spot. Did she connect the presence of a man\nbefore this wall with the possibility of a woman behind it? Did she\nperceive that vague, invisible thread? Was she, in her decrepit\nmendicancy, still youthful enough to remember something of the old\nhappier days? And could she, in this dark night and winter of her\nwretched life, still recognise the dawn? We know not: but it appears\nthat, on one occasion, passing near Gilliatt at his post, she brought to\nbear upon him something as like a smile as she was still capable of, and\nmuttered between her teeth, \"It is getting warmer.\"\n\nGilliatt heard the words, and was struck by them. \"It warms one,\" he\nmuttered, with an inward note of interrogation. \"It is getting warmer.\"\nWhat did the old woman mean?\n\nHe repeated the phrase mechanically all day, but he could not guess its\nmeaning.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE AIR \"BONNIE DUNDEE\" FINDS AN ECHO ON THE HILL\n\n\nIt was in a spot behind the enclosure of the garden of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, at\nan angle of the wall, half concealed with holly and ivy, and covered\nwith nettles, wild mallow, and large white mullen growing between the\nblocks of stone, that he passed the greater part of that summer. He\nwatched there, lost in deep thought. The lizards grew accustomed to his\npresence, and basked in the sun among the same stones. The summer was\nbright and full of dreamy indolence: overhead the light clouds came and\nwent. Gilliatt sat upon the grass. The air was full of the songs of\nbirds. He held his two hands up to his forehead, sometimes trying to\nrecollect himself: \"Why should she write my name in the snow?\" From a\ndistance the sea breeze came up in gentle breaths, at intervals the horn\nof the quarrymen sounded abruptly, warning the passers-by to take\nshelter, as they shattered some mass with gunpowder. The Port of St.\nSampson was not visible from this place, but he could see the tips of\nmasts above the trees. The sea-gulls flew wide and afar. Gilliatt had\nheard his mother say that women could love men; that such things\nhappened sometimes. He remembered it; and said within himself, \"Who\nknows, may not D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette love me?\" Then a feeling of sadness would come\nupon him; he would say, \"She, too, thinks of me in her turn. It is\nwell.\" He remembered that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was rich, and that he was poor: and\nthen the new boat appeared to him an execrable invention. He could never\nremember what day of the month it was. He would stare listlessly at the\ngreat bees, with their yellow bodies and their short wings, as they\nentered with a buzzing noise into the holes in the wall.\n\nOne evening D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette went in-doors to retire to bed. She approached\nher window to close it. The night was dark. Suddenly, something caught\nher ear, and she listened. Somewhere in the darkness there was a sound\nof music. It was some one, perhaps, on the hill-side, or at the foot of\nthe towers of Vale Castle, or, perhaps, further still, playing an air\nupon some instrument. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette recognised her favourite melody,\n\"Bonnie Dundee,\" played upon the bagpipe. She thought little of it.\n\nFrom that night the music might be heard again from time to time at the\nsame hours, particularly when the nights were very dark.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was not much pleased with all this.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n    \"A serenade by night may please a lady fair,\n    But of uncle and of guardian let the troubadour beware.\"\n\n    _Unpublished Comedy_\n\n\nFour years passed away.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was approaching her twenty-first year, and was still\nunmarried. Some writer has said that a fixed idea is a sort of gimlet;\nevery year gives it another turn. To pull out the first year is like\nplucking out the hair by the roots; in the second year, like tearing the\nskin; in the third, like breaking the bones; and in the fourth, like\nremoving the very brain itself.\n\nGilliatt had arrived at this fourth stage.\n\nHe had never yet spoken a word to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. He lived and dreamed near\nthat delightful vision. This was all.\n\nIt happened one day that, finding himself by chance at St. Sampson, he\nhad seen D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette talking with Mess Lethierry at the door of the\nBrav\u00c3\u00a9es, which opens upon the roadway of the port. Gilliatt ventured to\napproach very near. He fancied that at the very moment of his passing\nshe had smiled. There was nothing impossible in that.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette still heard, from time to time, the sound of the bagpipe.\n\nMess Lethierry had also heard this bagpipe. By degrees he had come to\nremark this persevering musician under D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's window. A tender\nstrain, too; all the more suspicious. A nocturnal gallant was a thing\nnot to his taste. His wish was to marry D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette in his own time, when\nshe was willing and he was willing, purely and simply, without any\nromance, or music, or anything of that sort. Irritated at it, he had at\nlast kept a watch, and he fancied that he had detected Gilliatt. He\npassed his fingers through his beard--a sign of anger--and grumbled out,\n\"What has that fellow got to pipe about? He is in love with D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette,\nthat is clear. You waste your time, young man. Any one who wants\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette must come to me, and not loiter about playing the flute.\"\n\nAn event of importance, long foreseen, occurred soon afterwards. It was\nannounced that the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode was appointed surrogate of\nthe Bishop of Winchester, dean of the island, and rector of St. Peter's\nPort, and that he would leave St. Sampson for St. Peter's immediately\nafter his successor should be installed.\n\nIt could not be long to the arrival of the new rector. He was a\ngentleman of Norman extraction, Monsieur Ebenezer Caudray.\n\nSome facts were known about the new rector, which the benevolent and\nmalevolent interpreted in a contrary sense. He was known to be young and\npoor, but his youth was tempered with much learning, and his poverty by\ngood expectations. In the dialect specially invented for the subject of\nriches and inheritances, death goes by the name of \"expectations.\" He\nwas the nephew and heir of the aged and opulent dean of St. Asaph. At\nthe death of this old gentleman he would be a rich man. M. Caudray had\ndistinguished relations. He was almost entitled to the quality of\n\"Honourable.\" As regarded his doctrine, people judged differently. He\nwas an Anglican, but, according to the expression of Bishop Tillotson, a\n\"libertine\"--that is, in reality, one who was very severe. He repudiated\nall pharisaism. He was a friend rather of the Presbytery than the\nEpiscopacy. He dreamed of the Primitive Church of the days when even\nAdam had the right to choose his Eve, and when Frumentinus, Bishop of\nHierapolis, carried off a young maiden to make her his wife, and said to\nher parents, \"Her will is such, and such is mine. You are no longer her\nmother, and you are no longer her father. I am the Bishop of Hierapolis,\nand this is my wife. Her father is in heaven.\" If the common belief\ncould be trusted, M. Caudray subordinated the text, \"Honour thy father\nand thy mother,\" to that other text, in his eyes of higher significance,\n\"The woman is the flesh of the man. She shall leave her father and\nmother to follow her husband.\" This tendency, however, to circumscribe\nthe parental authority and to favour religiously every mode of forming\nthe conjugal tie, is peculiar to all Protestantism, particularly in\nEngland, and singularly so in America.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nA DESERVED SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS ITS DETRACTORS\n\n\nAt this period the affairs of Mess Lethierry were in this position:--The\nDurande had well fulfilled all his expectations. He had paid his debts,\nrepaired his misfortunes, discharged his obligations at Br\u00c3\u00aame, met his\nacceptances at St. Malo. He had paid off the mortgage upon his house at\nthe Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, and had bought up all the little local rent charges upon\nthe property. He was also the proprietor of a great productive capital.\nThis was the Durande herself. The net revenue from the boat was about a\nthousand pounds sterling per annum, and the traffic was constantly\nincreasing. Strictly speaking, the Durande constituted his entire\nfortune. She was also the fortune of the island. The carriage of cattle\nbeing one of the most profitable portions of her trade, he had been\nobliged, in order to facilitate the stowage, and the embarking and\ndisembarking of animals, to do away with the luggage-boxes and the two\nboats. It was, perhaps, imprudent. The Durande had but one boat--namely,\nher long-boat; but this was an excellent one.\n\nTen years had elapsed since Rantaine's robbery.\n\nThis prosperity of the Durande had its weak point. It inspired no\nconfidence. People regarded it as a risk. Lethierry's good fortune was\nlooked upon as exceptional. He was considered to have gained by a lucky\nrashness. Some one in the Isle of Wight who had imitated him had not\nsucceeded. The enterprise had ruined the shareholders. The engines, in\nfact, were badly constructed. But people shook their heads. Innovations\nhave always to contend with the difficulty that few wish them well. The\nleast false step compromises them.\n\nOne of the commercial oracles of the Channel Islands, a certain banker\nfrom Paris, named Jauge, being consulted upon a steamboat speculation,\nwas reported to have turned his back, with the remark, \"An investment is\nit you propose to me? Exactly; an investment in smoke.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the sailing vessels had no difficulty in finding\ncapitalists to take shares in a venture. Capital, in fact, was\nobstinately in favour of sails, and as obstinately against boilers and\npaddle-wheels. At Guernsey, the Durande was indeed a fact, but steam was\nnot yet an established principle. Such is the fanatical spirit of\nconservatism in opposition to progress. They said of Lethierry, \"It is\nall very well; but he could not do it a second time.\" Far from\nencouraging, his example inspired timidity. Nobody would have dared to\nrisk another Durande.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE SLOOP \"CASHMERE\" SAVES A SHIPWRECKED CREW\n\n\nThe equinoctial gales begin early in the Channel. The sea there is\nnarrow, and the winds disturb it easily. The westerly gales begin from\nthe month of February, and the waves are beaten about from every\nquarter. Navigation becomes an anxious matter. The people on the coasts\nlook to the signal-post, and begin to watch for vessels in distress. The\nsea is then like a cut-throat in ambush for his victim. An invisible\ntrumpet sounds the alarm of war with the elements, furious blasts spring\nup from the horizon, and a terrible wind soon begins to blow. The dark\nnight whistles and howls. In the depth of the clouds the black tempest\ndistends its cheeks, and the storm arises.\n\nThe wind is one danger; the fogs are another.\n\nFogs have from all time been the terror of mariners. In certain fogs\nmicroscopic prisms of ice are found in suspension, to which Mariotte\nattributes halos, mock suns, and paraselenes. Storm-fogs are of a\ncomposite character; various gases of unequal specific gravity combine\nwith the vapour of water, and arrange themselves, layer over layer, in\nan order which divides the dense mist into zones. Below ranges the\niodine; above the iodine is the sulphur; above the sulphur the brome;\nabove the brome the phosphorus. This, in a certain manner, and making\nallowance for electric and magnetic tension, explains several phenomena,\nas the St. Elmo's Fire of Columbus and Magellan, the flying stars moving\nabout the ships, of which Seneca speaks; the two flames, Castor and\nPollux, mentioned by Plutarch; the Roman legion, whose spears appeared\nto C\u00c3\u00a6sar to take fire; the peak of the Chateau of Duino in Friuli which\nthe sentinel made to sparkle by touching it with his lance; and perhaps\neven those fulgurations from the earth which the ancients called Satan's\nterrestrial lightnings. At the equator, an immense mist seems\npermanently to encircle the globe. It is known as the cloud-ring. The\nfunction of the cloud-ring is to temper the heat of the tropics, as that\nof the Gulf-stream is to mitigate the coldness of the Pole. Under the\ncloud-ring fogs are fatal. These are what are called _horse latitudes_.\nIt was here that navigators of bygone ages were accustomed to cast their\nhorses into the sea to lighten the ship in stormy weather, and to\neconomise the fresh water when becalmed. Columbus said, \"_Nube abaxo ex\nmuerte_,\" death lurks in the low cloud. The Etruscans, who bear the same\nrelation to meteorology which the Chaldeans did to astronomy, had two\nhigh priests--the high priest of the thunder, and the high priest of the\nclouds. The \"fulgurators\" observed the lightning, and the weather sages\nwatched the mists. The college of Priest-Augurs was consulted by the\nSyrians, the Phoenicians, the Pelasgi, and all the primitive navigators\nof the ancient _Mare Internum_. The origin of tempests was, from that\ntime forward, partially understood. It is intimately connected with the\ngeneration of fogs, and is, properly speaking, the same phenomenon.\nThere exist upon the ocean three regions of fogs, one equatorial and two\npolar. The mariners give them but one name, the _pitch-pot_.\n\nIn all latitudes, and particularly in the Channel, the equinoctial fogs\nare dangerous. They shed a sudden darkness over the sea. One of the\nperils of fogs, even when not very dense, arises from their preventing\nthe mariners perceiving the change of the bed of the sea by the\nvariations of the colour of the water. The result is a dangerous\nconcealment of the approach of sands and breakers. The vessel steers\ntowards the shoals without receiving any warning. Frequently the fogs\nleave a ship no resource except to lie-to, or to cast anchor. There are\nas many shipwrecks from the fogs as from the winds.\n\nAfter a very violent squall succeeding one of these foggy days, the\nmail-boat _Cashmere_ arrived safely from England. It entered at St.\nPeter's Port as the first gleam of day appeared upon the sea, and at the\nvery moment when the cannon of Castle Cornet announced the break of day.\nThe sky had cleared: the sloop _Cashmere_ was anxiously expected, as she\nwas to bring the new rector of St. Sampson.\n\nA little after the arrival of the sloop, a rumour ran through the town\nthat she had been hailed during the night at sea by a long-boat\ncontaining a shipwrecked crew.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nHOW AN IDLER HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE SEEN BY A FISHERMAN\n\n\nOn that very night, at the moment when the wind abated, Gilliatt had\ngone out with his nets, without, however, taking his famous old Dutch\nboat too far from the coast.\n\nAs he was returning with the rising tide, towards two o'clock in the\nafternoon, the sun was shining brightly, and he passed before the\nBeast's Horn to reach the little bay of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue. At that moment\nhe fancied that he saw, in the projection of the \"Gild-Holm-'Ur\" seat a\nshadow, which was not that of the rock. He steered his vessel nearer,\nand was able to perceive a man sitting in the \"Gild-Holm-'Ur.\" The sea\nwas already very high, the rock encircled by the waves, and escape\nentirely cut off. Gilliatt made signs to the man. The stranger remained\nmotionless. Gilliatt drew nearer; the man was asleep.\n\nHe was attired in black. \"He looks like a priest,\" thought Gilliatt. He\napproached still nearer, and could distinguish the face of a young man.\n\nThe features were unknown to him.\n\nThe rock, happily, was peaked; there was a good depth. Gilliatt wore\noff, and succeeded in skirting the rocky wall. The tide raised the bark\nso high that Gilliatt, by standing upon the gunwale of the sloop, could\ntouch the man's feet. He raised himself upon the planking, and stretched\nout his hands. If he had fallen at that moment, it is doubtful if he\nwould have risen again on the water; the waves were rolling in between\nthe boat and the rock, and destruction would have been inevitable. He\npulled the foot of the sleeping man. \"Ho! there. What are you doing in\nthis place?\"\n\nThe man aroused, and muttered--\n\n\"I was looking about.\"\n\nHe was now completely awake, and continued--\n\n\"I have just arrived in this part. I came this way on a pleasure trip. I\nhave passed the night on the sea: the view from here seemed beautiful. I\nwas weary, and fell asleep.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes later, and you would have been drowned.\"\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\n\"Jump into my bark.\"\n\nGilliatt kept the bark fast with his foot, clutched the rock with one\nhand, and stretched out the other to the stranger in black, who sprang\nquickly into the boat. He was a fine young man.\n\nGilliatt seized the tiller, and in two minutes his boat entered the bay\nof the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue.\n\nThe young man wore a round hat and a white cravat; and his long black\nfrock-coat was buttoned up to the neck. He had fair hair, which he wore\n_en couronne_. He had a somewhat feminine cast of features, a clear eye,\na grave manner.\n\nMeanwhile the boat had touched the ground. Gilliatt passed the cable\nthrough the mooring-ring, then turned and perceived the young man\nholding out a sovereign in a very white hand.\n\nGilliatt moved the hand gently away.\n\nThere was a pause. The young man was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"You have saved me from death.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Gilliatt.\n\nThe moorings were made fast, and they went ashore.\n\nThe stranger continued--\n\n\"I owe you my life, sir.\"\n\n\"No matter.\"\n\nThis reply from Gilliatt was again followed by a pause.\n\n\"Do you belong to this parish?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Gilliatt.\n\n\"To what parish, then?\"\n\nGilliatt lifted up his right hand, pointed to the sky, and said--\n\n\"To that yonder.\"\n\nThe young man bowed, and left him.\n\nAfter walking a few paces, the stranger stopped, felt in his pocket,\ndrew out a book, and returning towards Gilliatt, offered it to him.\n\n\"Permit me to make you a present of this.\"\n\nGilliatt took the volume.\n\nIt was a Bible.\n\nAn instant after, Gilliatt, leaning upon the parapet, was following the\nyoung man with his eyes as he turned the angle of the path which led to\nSt. Sampson.\n\nBy little and little he lowered his gaze, forgot all about the\nstranger--knew no more whether the \"Gild-Holm-'Ur\" existed. Everything\ndisappeared before him in the bottomless depth of a reverie.\n\nThere was one abyss which swallowed up all his thought. This was\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nA voice calling him, aroused him from this dream.\n\n\"Ho there, Gilliatt!\"\n\nHe recognised the voice and looked up.\n\n\"What is the matter, Sieur Landoys?\"\n\nIt was, in fact, Sieur Landoys, who was passing along the road about one\nhundred paces from the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue in his phaeton, drawn by one little\nhorse. He had stopped to hail Gilliatt, but he seemed hurried.\n\n\"There is news, Gilliatt.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"At the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I am too far off to tell you the story.\"\n\nGilliatt shuddered.\n\n\"Is Miss D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette going to be married?\"\n\n\"No; but she had better look out for a husband.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Go up to the house, and you will learn.\"\n\nAnd Sieur Landoys whipped on his horse.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V\n\nTHE REVOLVER\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nCONVERSATIONS AT THE JEAN AUBERGE\n\n\nSieur Clubin was a man who bided his time. He was short in stature, and\nhis complexion was yellow. He had the strength of a bull. His sea life\nhad not tanned his skin; his flesh had a sallow hue; it was the colour\nof a wax candle, of which his eyes, too, had something of the steady\nlight. His memory was peculiarly retentive. With him, to have seen a man\nonce, was to have him like a note in a note-book. His quiet glance took\npossession of you. The pupil of his eye received the impression of a\nface, and kept it like a portrait. The face might grow old, but Sieur\nClubin never lost it; it was impossible to cheat that tenacious memory.\nSieur Clubin was curt in speech, grave in manner, bold in action. No\ngestures were ever indulged in by him. An air of candour won everybody\nto him at first; many people thought him artless. He had a wrinkle in\nthe corner of his eye, astonishingly expressive of simplicity. As we\nhave said, no abler mariner existed; no one like him for reefing a sail,\nfor keeping a vessel's head to the wind, or the sails well set. Never\ndid reputation for religion and integrity stand higher than his. To have\nsuspected him would have been to bring yourself under suspicion. He was\non terms of intimacy with Monsieur R\u00c3\u00a9buchet, a money-changer at St.\nMalo, who lived in the Rue St. Vincent, next door to the armourer's; and\nMonsieur R\u00c3\u00a9buchet would say, \"I would leave my shop in Clubin's hands.\"\n\nSieur Clubin was a widower; his wife, like himself, had enjoyed a high\nreputation for probity. She had died with a fame for incorruptible\nvirtue. If the bailli had whispered gallant things in her ear, she would\nhave impeached him before the king. If a saint had made love to her, she\nwould have told it to the priest. This couple, Sieur and Dame Clubin,\nhad realised in Torteval the ideal of the English epithet\n\"respectable.\" Dame Clubin's reputation was as the snowy whiteness of\nthe swan; Sieur Clubin's like that of ermine itself--a spot would have\nbeen fatal to him. He could hardly have picked up a pin without making\ninquiries for the owner. He would send round the town-crier about a box\nof matches. One day he went into a wine-shop at St. Servan, and said to\nthe man who kept it, \"Three years ago I breakfasted here; you made a\nmistake in the bill;\" and he returned the man thirteen sous. He was the\nvery personification of probity, with a certain compression of the lips\nindicative of watchfulness.\n\nHe seemed, indeed, always on the watch--for what? For rogues probably.\n\nEvery Tuesday he commanded the Durande on her passage from Guernsey to\nSt. Malo. He arrived at St. Malo on the Tuesday evening, stayed two days\nthere to discharge and take in a new cargo, and started again for\nGuernsey on Friday morning.\n\nThere was at that period, at St. Malo, a little tavern near the harbour,\nwhich was called the \"Jean Auberge.\"\n\nThe construction of the modern quays swept away this house. At this\nperiod, the sea came up as far as the St. Vincent and Dinan gates. St.\nMerlan and St. Servan communicated with each other by covered carts and\nother vehicles, which passed to and fro among vessels lying high and\ndry, avoiding the buoys, the anchors, and cables, and running the risk\nnow and then of smashing their leathern hoods against the lowered yards,\nor the end of a jibboom. Between the tides, the coachmen drove their\nhorses over those sands, where, six hours afterwards, the winds would be\nbeating the rolling waves. The four-and-twenty carrying dogs of St.\nMalo, who tore to pieces a naval officer in 1770, were accustomed to\nprowl about this beach. This excess of zeal on their part led to the\ndestruction of the pack. Their nocturnal barkings are no longer heard\nbetween the little and the great Talard.\n\nSieur Clubin was accustomed to stay at the Jean Auberge. The French\noffice of the Durande was held there.\n\nThe custom-house officers and coast-guardmen came to take their meals\nand to drink at the Jean Auberge. They had their separate tables. The\ncustom-house officers of Binic found it convenient for the service to\nmeet there with their brother officers of St. Malo.\n\nCaptains of vessels came there also; but they ate at another table.\n\nSieur Clubin sat sometimes at one, sometimes at the other table, but\npreferred the table of the custom-house men to that of the sea captains.\nHe was always welcome at either.\n\nThe tables were well served. There were strange drinks especially\nprovided for foreign sailors. A dandy sailor from Bilboa could have been\nsupplied there with a _helada_. People drank stout there, as at\nGreenwich; or brown _gueuse_, as at Antwerp.\n\nMasters of vessels who came from long voyages and privateersmen\nsometimes appeared at the captains' table, where they exchanged news.\n\"How are sugars? That commission is only for small lots.--The brown\nkinds, however, are going off. Three thousand bags of East India, and\nfive hundred hogsheads of Sagua.--Take my word, the opposition will end\nby defeating Vill\u00c3\u00a8le.--What about indigo? Only seven serons of Guatemala\nchanged hands.--The _Nanino-Julia_ is in the roads; a pretty\nthree-master from Brittany.--The two cities of La Plata are at\nloggerheads again.--When Monte Video gets fat, Buenos Ayres grows\nlean.--It has been found necessary to transfer the cargo of the\n_Regina-Coeli_, which has been condemned at Callao.--Cocoas go off\nbriskly.--Caraque bags are quoted at one hundred and thirty-four, and\nTrinidad's at seventy-three.--It appears that at the review in the Champ\nde Mars, the people cried, 'Down with the ministers!'--The raw salt\nSaladeros hides are selling--ox-hides at sixty francs, and cows' at\nforty-eight.--Have they passed the Balkan?--What is Diebitsch\nabout?--Aniseed is in demand at San Francisco. Plagniol olive oil is\nquiet.--Gruy\u00c3\u00a8re cheese, in bulk, is thirty-two francs the\nquintal.--Well, is Leon XII. dead?\" etc., etc.\n\nAll these things were talked about and commented on aloud. At the table\nof the custom-house and coast-guard officers they spoke in a lower key.\n\nMatters of police and revenue on the coast and in the ports require, in\nfact, a little more privacy, and a little less clearness in the\nconversation.\n\nThe sea-captains' table was presided over by an old captain of a large\nvessel, M. Gertrais-Gaboureau. M. Gertrais-Gaboureau could hardly be\nregarded as a man; he was rather a living barometer. His long life at\nsea had given him a surprising power of prognosticating the state of the\nweather. He seemed to issue a decree for the weather to-morrow. He\nsounded the winds, and felt the pulse, as it were, of the tides. He\nmight be imagined requesting the clouds to show their tongue--that is\nto say, their forked lightnings. He was the physician of the wave, the\nbreeze, and the squall. The ocean was his patient. He had travelled\nround the world like a doctor going his visits, examining every kind of\nclimate in its good and bad condition. He was profoundly versed in the\npathology of the seasons. Sometimes he would be heard delivering himself\nin this fashion--\"The barometer descended in 1796 to three degrees below\ntempest point.\" He was a sailor from real love of the sea. He hated\nEngland as much as he liked the ocean. He had carefully studied English\nseamanship, and considered himself to have discovered its weak point. He\nwould explain how the _Sovereign_ of 1637 differed from the _Royal\nWilliam_ of 1670, and from the _Victory_ of 1775. He compared their\nbuild as to their forecastles and quarter-decks. He looked back with\nregret to the towers upon the deck, and the funnel-shaped tops of the\n_Great Harry_ of 1514--probably regarding them from the point of view of\nconvenient lodging-places for French cannon-balls. In his eyes, nations\nonly existed for their naval institutions. He indulged in some odd\nfigures of speech on this subject. He considered the term \"The Trinity\nHouse\" as sufficiently indicating England. The \"Northern Commissioners\"\nwere in like manner synonymous in his mind with Scotland; the \"Ballast\nBoard,\" with Ireland. He was full of nautical information. He was, in\nhimself, a marine alphabet and almanack, a tariff and low-water mark,\nall combined. He knew by heart all the lighthouse dues--particularly\nthose of the English coast--one penny per ton for passing before this;\none farthing before that. He would tell you that the Small Rock Light\nwhich once used to burn two hundred gallons of oil, now consumes fifteen\nhundred. Once, aboard ship, he was attacked by a dangerous disease, and\nwas believed to be dying. The crew assembled round his hammock, and in\nthe midst of his groans and agony he addressed the chief carpenter with\nthe words, \"You had better make a mortise in each side of the main caps,\nand put in a bit of iron to help pass the top ropes through.\" His habit\nof command had given to his countenance an expression of authority.\n\nIt was rare that the subjects of conversation at the captains' table and\nat that of the custom-house men were the same. This, however, did happen\nto be the case in the first days of that month of February to which the\ncourse of this history has now brought us. The three-master\n_Tamaulipas_, Captain Zuela, arrived from Chili, and bound thither\nagain, was the theme of discussion at both tables.\n\nAt the captains' table they were talking of her cargo; and at that of\nthe custom-house people, of certain circumstances connected with her\nrecent proceedings.\n\nCaptain Zuela, of Copiapo, was partly a Chilian and partly a Columbian.\nHe had taken a part in the War of Independence in a true independent\nfashion, adhering sometimes to Bolivar, sometimes to Morillo, according\nas he had found it to his interest. He had enriched himself by serving\nall causes. No man in the world could have been more Bourbonist, more\nBonapartist, more absolutist, more liberal, more atheistical, or more\ndevoutly catholic. He belonged to that great and renowned party which\nmay be called the Lucrative party. From time to time he made his\nappearance in France on commercial voyages; and if report spoke truly,\nhe willingly gave a passage to fugitives of any kind--bankrupts or\npolitical refugees, it was all the same to him, provided they could pay.\nHis mode of taking them aboard was simple. The fugitive waited upon a\nlonely point of the coast, and at the moment of setting sail, Zuela\nwould detach a small boat to fetch him. On his last voyage he had\nassisted in this way an outlaw and fugitive from justice, named Berton;\nand on this occasion he was suspected of being about to aid the flight\nof the men implicated in the affair of the Bidassoa. The police were\ninformed, and had their eye upon him.\n\nThis period was an epoch of flights and escapes. The Restoration in\nFrance was a reactionary movement. Revolutions are fruitful of voluntary\nexile; and restorations of wholesale banishments. During the first seven\nor eight years which followed the return of the Bourbons, panic was\nuniversal--in finance, in industry, in commerce, men felt the ground\ntremble beneath them. Bankruptcies were numerous in the commercial\nworld; in the political, there was a general rush to escape. Lavalette\nhad taken flight, Lefebvre Desnouettes had taken flight, Delon had taken\nflight. Special tribunals were again in fashion--_plus_ Treetaillon.\nPeople instinctively shunned the Pont de Saumur, the Esplanade de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9ole, the wall of the Observatoire in Paris, the tower of Taurias\nd'Avignon--dismal landmarks in history where the period of reaction has\nleft its sign-spots, on which the marks of that blood-stained hand are\nstill visible. In London the Thistlewood affair, with its ramifications\nin France: in Paris the Trogoff trial, with its ramifications in\nBelgium, Switzerland, and Italy, had increased the motives for anxiety\nand flight, and given an impetus to that mysterious rout which left so\nmany gaps in the social system of that day. To find a place of safety,\nthis was the general care. To be implicated was to be ruined. The spirit\nof the military tribunals had survived their institution. Sentences were\nmatters of favour. People fled to Texas, to the Rocky Mountains, to\nPeru, to Mexico. The men of the Loire, traitors then, but now regarded\nas patriots, had founded the _Champ d'Asile_. B\u00c3\u00a9ranger in one of his\nsongs says--\n\n    \"Barbarians! we are Frenchmen born;\n    Pity us, glorious, yet forlorn.\"\n\nSelf-banishment was the only resource left. Nothing, perhaps, seems\nsimpler than flight, but that monosyllable has a terrible significance.\nEvery obstacle is in the way of the man who slips away. Taking to flight\nnecessitates disguise. Persons of importance--even illustrious\ncharacters--were reduced to these expedients, only fit for malefactors.\nTheir independent habits rendered it difficult for them to escape\nthrough the meshes of authority. A rogue who violates the conditions of\nhis ticket-of-leave comports himself before the police as innocently as\na saint; but imagine innocence constrained to act a part; virtue\ndisguising its voice; a glorious reputation hiding under a mask. Yonder\npasser-by is a man of well-earned celebrity; he is in quest of a false\npassport. The equivocal proceedings of one absconding from the reach of\nthe law is no proof that he is not a hero. Ephemeral but characteristic\nfeatures of the time of which our so-called regular history takes no\nnote, but which the true painter of the age will bring out into relief.\nUnder cover of these flights and concealments of honest men, genuine\nrogues, less watched and suspected, managed often to get clear off. A\nscoundrel, who found it convenient to disappear, would take advantage of\nthe general pell-mell, tack himself on to the political refugees, and,\nthanks to his greater skill in the art, would contrive to appear in that\ndim twilight more honest even than his honest neighbours. Nothing looks\nmore awkward and confused sometimes than honesty unjustly condemned. It\nis out of its element, and is almost sure to commit itself.\n\nIt is a curious fact, that this voluntary expatriation, particularly\nwith honest folks, appeared to lead to every strange turn of fortune.\nThe modicum of civilisation which a scamp brought with him from London\nor Paris became, perhaps, a valuable stock in trade in some primitive\ncountry, ingratiated him with the people, and enabled him to strike\ninto new paths. There is nothing impossible in a man's escaping thus\nfrom the laws, to reappear elsewhere as a dignitary among the\npriesthood. There was something phantasmagorial in these sudden\ndisappearances; and more than one such flight has led to events like the\nmarvels of a dream. An escapade of this kind, indeed, seemed to end\nnaturally in the wild and wonderful; as when some broken bankrupt\nsuddenly decamps to turn up again twenty years later as Grand Vizier to\nthe Mogul, or as a king in Tasmania.\n\nRendering assistance to these fugitives was an established trade, and,\nlooking to the abundance of business of that kind, was a highly\nprofitable one. It was generally carried on as a supplementary branch of\ncertain recognised kinds of commerce. A person, for instance, desiring\nto escape to England, applied to the smugglers; one who desired to get\nto America, had recourse to sea-captains like Zuela.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nCLUBIN OBSERVES SOMEONE\n\n\nZuela came sometimes to take refreshment at the Jean Auberge. Clubin\nknew him by sight.\n\nFor that matter Clubin was not proud. He did not disdain even to know\nscamps by sight. He went so far sometimes as to cultivate even a closer\nacquaintance with them; giving his hand in the open street, or saying\ngood-day to them. He talked English with the smugglers, and jabbered\nSpanish with the _contrebandistas_. On this subject he had at command a\nnumber of apologetic phrases. \"Good,\" he said, \"can be extracted out of\nthe knowledge of evil. The gamekeeper may find advantage in knowing the\npoacher. The good pilot may sound the depths of a pirate, who is only a\nsort of hidden rock. I test the quality of a scoundrel as a doctor will\ntest a poison.\" There was no answering a battery of proverbs like this.\nEverybody gave Clubin credit for his shrewdness. People praised him for\nnot indulging in a ridiculous delicacy. Who, then, should dare to speak\nscandal of him on this point? Everything he did was evidently \"for the\ngood of the service.\" With him, all was straightforward. Nothing could\nstain his good fame. Crystal might more easily become sullied. This\ngeneral confidence in him was the natural reward of a long life of\nintegrity, the crowning advantage of a settled reputation. Whatever\nClubin might do, or appear to do, was sure to be interpreted favourably.\nHe had attained almost to a state of impeccability. Over and above this,\n\"he is very wary,\" people said: and from a situation which in others\nwould have given rise to suspicion, his integrity would extricate\nitself, with a still greater halo of reputation for ability. This\nreputation for ability mingled harmoniously with his fame for perfect\nsimplicity of character. Great simplicity and great talents in\nconjunction are not uncommon. The compound constitutes one of the\nvarieties of the virtuous man, and one of the most valuable. Sieur\nClubin was one of those men who might be found in intimate conversation\nwith a sharper or a thief, without suffering any diminution of respect\nin the minds of their neighbours.\n\nThe _Tamaulipas_ had completed her loading. She was ready for sea, and\nwas preparing to sail very shortly.\n\nOne Tuesday evening the Durande arrived at St. Malo while it was still\nbroad daylight. Sieur Clubin, standing upon the bridge of the vessel,\nand superintending the manoeuvres necessary for getting her into port,\nperceived upon the sandy beach near the Petit-Bey, two men, who were\nconversing between the rocks, in a solitary spot. He observed them with\nhis sea-glass, and recognised one of the men. It was Captain Zuela. He\nseemed to recognise the other also.\n\nThis other was a person of high stature, a little grey. He wore the\nbroad-brimmed hat and the sober clothing of the Society of Friends. He\nwas probably a Quaker. He lowered his gaze with an air of extreme\ndiffidence.\n\nOn arriving at the Jean Auberge, Sieur Clubin learnt that the\n_Tamaulipas_ was preparing to sail in about ten days.\n\nIt has since become known that he obtained information on some other\npoints.\n\nThat night he entered the gunsmith's shop in the St. Vincent Street, and\nsaid to the master:\n\n\"Do you know what a revolver is?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the gunsmith. \"It is an American weapon.\"\n\n\"It is a pistol with which a man can carry on a conversation.\"\n\n\"Exactly: an instrument which comprises in itself both the question and\nthe answer.\"\n\n\"And the rejoinder too.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Monsieur Clubin. A rotatory clump of barrels.\"\n\n\"I shall want five or six balls.\"\n\nThe gunmaker twisted the corner of his lip, and made that peculiar noise\nwith which, when accompanied by a toss of the head, Frenchmen express\nadmiration.\n\n\"The weapon is a good one, Monsieur Clubin.\"\n\n\"I want a revolver with six barrels.\"\n\n\"I have not one.\"\n\n\"What! and you a gunmaker!\"\n\n\"I do not keep such articles yet. You see, it is a new thing. It is only\njust coming into vogue. French makers, as yet, confine themselves to the\nsimple pistol.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"It has not yet become an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, I say.\"\n\n\"I have excellent pistols.\"\n\n\"I want a revolver.\"\n\n\"I agree that it is more useful. Stop, Monsieur Clubin!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I believe I know where there is one at this moment in St. Malo; to be\nhad a bargain.\"\n\n\"A revolver?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For sale?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"I believe I know; or I can find out.\"\n\n\"When can you give me an answer?\"\n\n\"A bargain; but of good quality.\"\n\n\"When shall I return?\"\n\n\"If I procure you a revolver, remember, it will be a good one.\"\n\n\"When will you give me an answer?\"\n\n\"After your next voyage.\"\n\n\"Do not mention that it is for me,\" said Clubin.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nCLUBIN CARRIES AWAY SOMETHING AND BRINGS BACK NOTHING\n\n\nSieur Clubin completed the loading of the Durande, embarked a number of\ncattle and some passengers, and left St. Malo for Guernsey, as usual, on\nthe Friday morning.\n\nOn that same Friday, when the vessel had gained the open, which permits\nthe captain to absent himself a moment from the place of command, Clubin\nentered his cabin, shut himself in, took a travelling bag which he kept\nthere, put into one of its compartments some biscuit, some boxes of\npreserves, a few pounds of chocolate in sticks, a chronometer, and a sea\ntelescope, and passed through the handles a cord, ready prepared to\nsling it if necessary. Then he descended into the hold, went into the\ncompartment where the cables are kept, and was seen to come up again\nwith one of those knotted ropes heavy with pieces of metal, which are\nused for ship caulkers at sea and by robbers ashore. Cords of this kind\nare useful in climbing.\n\nHaving arrived at Guernsey, Clubin repaired to Torteval. He took with\nhim the travelling bag and the knotted cord, but did not bring them back\nagain.\n\nLet us repeat once for all, the Guernsey which we are describing is that\nancient Guernsey which no longer exists, and of which it would be\nimpossible to find a parallel now anywhere except in the country. There\nit is still flourishing, but in the towns it has passed away. The same\nremarks apply to Jersey. St. Helier's is as civilised as Dieppe, St.\nPeter's Port as L'Orient. Thanks to the progress of civilisation, thanks\nto the admirably enterprising spirit of that brave island people,\neverything has been changed during the last forty years in the Norman\nArchipelago. Where there was darkness there is now light. With these\npremises let us proceed.\n\nAt that period, then, which is already so far removed from us as to have\nbecome historical, smuggling was carried on very extensively in the\nChannel. The smuggling vessels abounded, particularly on the western\ncoast of Guernsey. People of that peculiarly clever kind who know, even\nin the smallest details, what went on half a century ago, will even cite\nyou the names of these suspicious craft, which were almost always\nAustrians or Guiposeans. It is certain that a week scarcely ever passed\nwithout one or two being seen either in Saint's Bay or at Pleinmont.\nTheir coming and going had almost the character of a regular service. A\ncavern in the cliffs at Sark was called then, and is still called, the\n\"Shops\" (\"Les Boutiques\"), from its being the place where these\nsmugglers made their bargains with the purchasers of their merchandise.\nThis sort of traffic had in the Channel a dialect of its own, a\nvocabulary of contraband technicalities now forgotten, and which was to\nthe Spanish what the \"Levantine\" is to the Italian.\n\nOn many parts of the English coast smuggling had a secret but cordial\nunderstanding with legitimate and open commerce. It had access to the\nhouse of more than one great financier, by the back-stairs it is true;\nand its influence extended itself mysteriously through all the\ncommercial world, and the intricate ramifications of manufacturing\nindustry. Merchant on one side, smuggler on the other; such was the key\nto the secret of many great fortunes. S\u00c3\u00a9guin affirmed it of Bourgain,\nBourgain of S\u00c3\u00a9guin. We do not vouch for their accusations; it is\npossible that they were calumniating each other. However this may have\nbeen, it is certain that the contraband trade, though hunted down by the\nlaw, was flourishing enough in certain financial circles. It had\nrelations with \"the very best society.\" Thus the brigand Mandrin, in\nother days, found himself occasionally _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with the Count of\nCharolais; for this underhand trade often contrived to put on a very\nrespectable appearance; kept a house of its own with an irreproachable\nexterior.\n\nAll this necessitated a host of manoeuvres and connivances, which\nrequired impenetrable secrecy. A contrabandist was entrusted with a good\nmany things, and knew how to keep them secret. An inviolable confidence\nwas the condition of his existence. The first quality, in fact, in a\nsmuggler was strict honour in his own circle. No discreetness, no\nsmuggling. Fraud has its secrets like the priest's confessional.\n\nThese secrets were indeed, as a rule, faithfully kept. The contrabandist\nswore to betray nothing, and he kept his word; nobody was more\ntrustworthy than the genuine smuggler. The Judge Alcade of Oyarzun\ncaptured a smuggler one day, and put him to torture to compel him to\ndisclose the name of the capitalist who secretly supported him. The\nsmuggler refused to tell. The capitalist in question was the Judge\nAlcade himself. Of these two accomplices, the judge and the smuggler,\nthe one had been compelled, in order to appear in the eyes of the world\nto fulfil the law, to put the other to the torture, which the other had\npatiently borne for the sake of his oath.\n\nThe two most famous smugglers who haunted Pleinmont at that period were\nBlasco and Blasquito. They were _Tocayos_. This was a sort of Spanish or\nCatholic relationship which consisted in having the same patron saint in\nheaven; a thing, it will be admitted, not less worthy of consideration\nthan having the same father upon earth.\n\nWhen a person was initiated into the furtive ways of the contraband\nbusiness, nothing was more easy, or, from a certain point of view, more\ntroublesome. It was sufficient to have no fear of dark nights, to repair\nto Pleinmont, and to consult the oracle located there.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nPLEINMONT\n\n\nPleinmont, near Torteval, is one of the three corners of the island of\nGuernsey. At the extremity of the cape there rises a high turfy hill,\nwhich looks over the sea.\n\nThe height is a lonely place. All the more lonely from there being one\nsolitary house there.\n\nThis house adds a sense of terror to that of solitude.\n\nIt is popularly believed to be haunted.\n\nHaunted or not, its aspect is singular.\n\nBuilt of granite, and rising only one story high, it stands in the midst\nof the grassy solitude. It is in a perfectly good condition as far as\nexterior is concerned; the walls are thick and the roof is sound. Not a\nstone is wanting in the sides, not a tile upon the roof. A brick-built\nchimney-stack forms the angle of the roof. The building turns its back\nto the sea, being on that side merely a blank wall. On examining this\nwall, however, attentively, the visitor perceives a little window\nbricked up. The two gables have three dormer windows, one fronting the\neast, the others fronting the west, but both are bricked up in like\nmanner. The front, which looks inland, has alone a door and windows.\nThis door, too, is walled in, as are also the two windows of the\nground-floor. On the first floor--and this is the feature which is most\nstriking as you approach--there are two open windows; but these are even\nmore suspicious than the blind windows. Their open squares look dark\neven in broad day, for they have no panes of glass, or even\nwindow-frames. They open simply upon the dusk within. They strike the\nimagination like hollow eye-sockets in a human face. Inside all is\ndeserted. Through the gaping casements you may mark the ruin within. No\npanellings, no woodwork; all bare stone. It is like a windowed\nsepulchre, giving liberty to the spectres to look out upon the daylight\nworld. The rains sap the foundations on the seaward side. A few nettles,\nshaken by the breeze, flourish in the lower part of the walls. Far\naround the horizon there is no other human habitation. The house is a\nvoid; the abode of silence: but if you place your ear against the wall\nand listen, you may distinguish a confused noise now and then, like the\nflutter of wings. Over the walled door, upon the stone which forms its\narchitrave, are sculptured these letters, \"ELM-PBILG,\" with the date\n\"1780.\"\n\nThe dark shadow of night and the mournful light of the moon find\nentrance there.\n\nThe sea completely surrounds the house. Its situation is magnificent;\nbut for that reason its aspect is more sinister. The beauty of the spot\nbecomes a puzzle. Why does not a human family take up its abode here?\nThe place is beautiful, the house well-built. Whence this neglect? To\nthese questions, obvious to the reason, succeed others, suggested by the\nreverie which the place inspires. Why is this cultivatable garden\nuncultivated? No master for it; and the bricked-up doorway? What has\nhappened to the place? Why is it shunned by men? What business is done\nhere? If none, why is there no one here? Is it only when all the rest of\nthe world are asleep that some one in this spot is awake? Dark squalls,\nwild winds, birds of prey, strange creatures, unknown forms, present\nthemselves to the mind, and connect themselves somehow with this\ndeserted house. For what class of wayfarers can this be the hostelry?\nYou imagine to yourself whirlwinds of rain and hail beating in at the\nopen casements, and wandering through the rooms. Tempests have left\ntheir vague traces upon the interior walls. The chambers, though walled\nand covered in, are visited by the hurricanes. Has the house been the\nscene of some great crime? You may almost fancy that this spectral\ndwelling, given up to solitude and darkness, might be heard calling\naloud for succour. Does it remain silent? Do voices indeed issue from\nit? What business has it on hand in this lonely place? The mystery of\nthe dark hours rests securely here. Its aspect is disquieting at\nnoonday; what must it be at midnight? The dreamer asks himself--for\ndreams have their coherence--what this house may be between the dusk of\nevening and the twilight of approaching dawn? Has the vast supernatural\nworld some relation with this deserted height, which sometimes compels\nit to arrest its movements here, and to descend and to become visible?\nDo the scattered elements of the spirit world whirl around it? Does the\nimpalpable take form and substance here? Insoluble riddles! A holy awe\nis in the very stones; that dim twilight has surely relations with the\ninfinite Unknown. When the sun has gone down, the song of the birds will\nbe hushed, the goatherd behind the hills will go homeward with his\ngoats; reptiles, taking courage from the gathering darkness, will creep\nthrough the fissures of rocks; the stars will begin to appear, night\nwill come, but yonder two blank casements will still be staring at the\nsky. They open to welcome spirits and apparitions; for it is by the\nnames of apparitions, ghosts, phantom faces vaguely distinct, masks in\nthe lurid light, mysterious movements of minds, and shadows, that the\npopular faith, at once ignorant and profound, translates the sombre\nrelations of this dwelling with the world of darkness.\n\nThe house is \"haunted;\" the popular phrase comprises everything.\n\nCredulous minds have their explanation; common-sense thinkers have\ntheirs also. \"Nothing is more simple,\" say the latter, \"than the history\nof the house. It is an old observatory of the time of the revolutionary\nwars and the days of smuggling. It was built for such objects. The wars\nbeing ended, the house was abandoned; but it was not pulled down, as it\nmight one day again become useful. The door and windows have been walled\nto prevent people entering, or doing injury to the interior. The walls\nof the windows, on the three sides which face the sea, have been bricked\nup against the winds of the south and south-west. That is all.\"\n\nThe ignorant and the credulous, however, are not satisfied. In the first\nplace, the house was not built at the period of the wars of the\nRevolution. It bears the date \"1780,\" which was anterior to the\nRevolution. In the next place it was not built for an observatory. It\nbears the letters \"ELM-PBILG,\" which are the double monogram of two\nfamilies, and which indicate, according to usage, that the house was\nbuilt for the use of a newly-married couple. Then it has certainly been\ninhabited: why then should it be abandoned? If the door and windows were\nbricked up to prevent people entering the house only, why were two\nwindows left open? Why are there no shutters, no window-frames, no\nglass? Why were the walls bricked in on one side if not on the other?\nThe wind is prevented from entering from the south; but why is it\nallowed to enter from the north?\n\nThe credulous are wrong, no doubt; but it is clear that the common-sense\nthinkers have not discovered the key to the mystery. The problem remains\nstill unsolved.\n\nIt is certain that the house is generally believed to have been more\nuseful than inconvenient to the smugglers.\n\nThe growth of superstitious terror tends to deprive facts of their true\nproportions. Without doubt, many of the nocturnal phenomena which have,\nby little and little, secured to the building the reputation of being\nhaunted, might be explained by obscure and furtive visits, by brief\nsojourns of sailors near the spot, and sometimes by the precaution,\nsometimes by the daring, of men engaged in certain suspicious\noccupations concealing themselves for their dark purposes, or allowing\nthemselves to be seen in order to inspire dread.\n\nAt this period, already a remote one, many daring deeds were possible.\nThe police--particularly in small places--was by no means as efficient\nas in these days.\n\nAdd to this, that if the house was really, as was said, a resort of the\nsmugglers, their meetings there must, up to a certain point, have been\nsafe from interruptions precisely because the house was dreaded by the\nsuperstitious people of the country. Its ghostly reputation prevented\nits being visited for other reasons. People do not generally apply to\nthe police, or officers of customs, on the subject of spectres. The\nsuperstitious rely on making the sign of the cross; not on magistrates\nand indictments. There is always a tacit connivance, involuntary it may\nbe, but not the less real, between the objects which inspire fear and\ntheir victims. The terror-stricken feel a sort of culpability in having\nencountered their terrors; they imagine themselves to have unveiled a\nsecret; and they have an inward fear, unknown even to themselves, of\naggravating their guilt, and exciting the anger of the apparitions. All\nthis makes them discreet. And over and above this reason, the very\ninstinct of the credulous is silence; dread is akin to dumbness; the\nterrified speak little; horror seems always to whisper, \"Hush!\"\n\nIt must be remembered that this was a period when the Guernsey peasants\nbelieved that the Mystery of the Holy Manger is repeated by oxen and\nasses every year on a fixed day; a period when no one would have dared\nto enter a stable at night for fear of coming upon the animals on their\nknees.\n\nIf the local legends and stories of the people can be credited, the\npopular superstition went so far as to fasten to the walls of the house\nat Pleinmont things of which the traces are still visible--rats without\nfeet, bats without wings, and bodies of other dead animals. Here, too,\nwere seen toads crushed between the pages of a Bible, bunches of yellow\nlupins, and other strange offerings, placed there by imprudent\npassers-by at night, who, having fancied that they had seen something,\nhoped by these small sacrifices to obtain pardon, and to appease the\nill-humours of were-wolves and evil spirits. In all times, believers of\nthis kind have flourished; some even in very high places. C\u00c3\u00a6sar\nconsulted Saganius, and Napoleon Mademoiselle Lenormand. There are a\nkind of consciences so tender, that they must seek indulgences even from\nBeelzebub. \"May God do, and Satan not undo,\" was one of the prayers of\nCharles the Fifth. They come to persuade themselves that they may commit\nsins even against the Evil One; and one of their cherished objects was,\nto be irreproachable even in the eyes of Satan. We find here an\nexplanation of those adorations sometimes paid to infernal spirits. It\nis only one more species of fanaticism. Sins against the devil certainly\nexist in certain morbid imaginations. The fancy that they have violated\nthe laws of the lower regions torments certain eccentric casuists; they\nare haunted with scruples even about offending the demons. A belief in\nthe efficacy of devotions to the spirits of the Brocken or Armuyr, a\nnotion of having committed sins against hell, visionary penances for\nimaginary crimes, avowals of the truth to the spirit of falsehood,\nself-accusation before the origin of all evil, and confessions in an\ninverted sense--are all realities, or things at least which have\nexisted. The annals of criminal procedure against witchcraft and magic\nprove this in every page. Human folly unhappily extends even thus far:\nwhen terror seizes upon a man he does not stop easily. He dreams of\nimaginary faults, imaginary purifications, and clears out his conscience\nwith the old witches' broom.\n\nBe this as it may, if the house at Pleinmont had its secrets, it kept\nthem to itself; except by some rare chance, no one went there to see. It\nwas left entirely alone. Few people, indeed, like to run the risk of an\nencounter with the other world.\n\nOwing to the terror which it inspired, and which kept at a distance all\nwho could observe or bear testimony on the subject, it had always been\neasy to obtain an entrance there at night by means of a rope ladder, or\neven by the use of the first ladder coming to hand in one of the\nneighbouring fields. A consignment of goods or provisions left there\nmight await in perfect safety the time and opportunity for a furtive\nembarkation. Tradition relates that forty years ago a fugitive--for\npolitical offences as some affirm, for commercial as others\nsay--remained for some time concealed in the haunted house at Pleinmont;\nwhence he finally succeeded in embarking in a fishing-boat for England.\nFrom England a passage is easily obtained to America.\n\nTradition also avers that provisions deposited in this house remain\nthere untouched, Lucifer and the smugglers having an interest in\ninducing whoever places them there to return.\n\nFrom the summit of the house, there is a view to the south of the Hanway\nRocks, at about a mile from the shore.\n\nThese rocks are famous. They have been guilty of all the evil deeds of\nwhich rocks are capable. They are the most ruthless destroyers of the\nsea. They lie in a treacherous ambush for vessels in the night. They\nhave contributed to the enlargement of the cemeteries at Torteval and\nRocquaine.\n\nA lighthouse was erected upon these rocks in 1862. At the present day,\nthe Hanways light the way for the vessels which they once lured to\ndestruction; the destroyer in ambush now bears a lighted torch in his\nhand; and mariners seek in the horizon, as a protector and a guide, the\nrock which they used to fly as a pitiless enemy. It gives confidence by\nnight in that vast space where it was so long a terror--like a robber\nconverted into a gendarme.\n\nThere are three Hanways: the Great Hanway, the Little Hanway, and the\nMauve. It is upon the Little Hanway that the red light is placed at the\npresent time.\n\nThis reef of rocks forms part of a group of peaks, some beneath the sea,\nsome rising out of it. It towers above them all; like a fortress, it has\nadvanced works: on the side of the open sea, a chain of thirteen rocks;\non the north, two breakers--the High Fourqui\u00c3\u00a9s, the Needles, and a\nsandbank called the H\u00c3\u00a9rou\u00c3\u00a9e. On the south, three rocks--the Cat Rock,\nthe Perc\u00c3\u00a9e, and the Herpin Rock; then two banks--the South Bank and the\nMuet: besides which, there is, on the side opposite Pleinmont, the Tas\nde Pois d'Aval.\n\nTo swim across the channel from the Hanways to Pleinmont is difficult,\nbut not impossible. We have already said that this was one of the\nachievements of Clubin. The expert swimmer who knows this channel can\nfind two resting-places, the Round Rock, and further on, a little out of\nthe course, to the left, the Red Rock.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE BIRDS'-NESTERS\n\n\nIt was near the period of that Saturday which was passed by Sieur Clubin\nat Torteval that a curious incident occurred, which was little heard of\nat the time, and which did not generally transpire till a long time\nafterwards. For many things, as we have already observed, remain\nundivulged, simply by reason of the terror which they have caused in\nthose who have witnessed them.\n\nIn the night-time between Saturday and Sunday--we are exact in the\nmatter of the date, and we believe it to be correct--three boys climbed\nup the hill at Pleinmont. The boys returned to the village: they came\nfrom the seashore. They were what are called, in the corrupt French of\nthat part, \"d\u00c3\u00a9niquoiseaux,\" or birds'-nesters. Wherever there are cliffs\nand cleft-rocks overhanging the sea, the young birds'-nesters abound.\nThe reader will remember that Gilliatt interfered in this matter for the\nsake of the birds as well as for the sake of the children.\n\nThe \"d\u00c3\u00a9niquoiseaux\" are a sort of sea-urchins, and are not a very timid\nspecies.\n\nThe night was very dark. Dense masses of cloud obscured the zenith.\nThree o'clock had sounded in the steeple of Torteval which is round and\npointed like a magician's hat.\n\nWhy did the boys return so late? Nothing more simple. They had been\nsearching for sea-gulls' nests in the Tas de Pois d'Aval. The season\nhaving been very mild, the pairing of the birds had begun very early.\nThe children watching the fluttering of the male and female about their\nnests, and excited by the pursuit, had forgotten the time. The waters\nhad crept up around them; they had no time to regain the little bay in\nwhich they had moored their boat, and they were compelled to wait upon\none of the peaks of the Tas de Pois for the ebb of the tide. Hence their\nlate return. Mothers wait on such occasions in feverish anxiety for the\nreturn of their children, and when they find them safe, give vent to\ntheir joy in the shape of anger, and relieve their tears by dealing them\na sound drubbing. The boys accordingly hastened their steps, but in fear\nand trembling. Their haste was of that sort which is glad of an excuse\nfor stopping, and which is not inconsistent with a reluctance to reach\ntheir destination; for they had before them the prospect of warm\nembraces, to be followed with an inevitable thrashing.\n\nOne only of the boys had nothing of this to fear. He was an orphan: a\nFrench boy, without father or mother, and perfectly content just then\nwith his motherless condition; for nobody taking any interest in him,\nhis back was safe from the dreaded blows. The two others were natives of\nGuernsey, and belonged to the parish of Torteval.\n\nHaving climbed the grassy hill, the three birds'-nesters reached the\ntableland on which was situate the haunted house.\n\nThey began by being in fear, which is the proper frame of mind of every\npasser-by; and particularly of every child at that hour and in that\nplace.\n\nThey had a strong desire to take to their heels as fast as possible, and\na strong desire, also, to stay and look.\n\nThey did stop.\n\nThey looked towards the solitary building.\n\nIt was all dark and terrible.\n\nIt stood in the midst of the solitary plain--an obscure block, a hideous\nbut symmetrical excrescence; a high square mass with right-angled\ncorners, like an immense altar in the darkness.\n\nThe first thought of the boys was to run: the second was to draw nearer.\nThey had never seen this house before. There is such a thing as a desire\nto be frightened arising from curiosity. They had a little French boy\nwith them, which emboldened them to approach.\n\nIt is well known that the French have no fear.\n\nBesides, it is reassuring to have company in danger; to be frightened in\nthe company of two others is encouraging.\n\nAnd then they were a sort of hunters accustomed to peril. They were\nchildren; they were used to search, to rummage, to spy out hidden\nthings. They were in the habit of peeping into holes; why not into this\nhole? Hunting is exciting. Looking into birds' nests perhaps gives an\nitch for looking a little into a nest of ghosts. A rummage in the dark\nregions. Why not?\n\nFrom prey to prey, says the proverb, we come to the devil. After the\nbirds, the demons. The boys were on the way to learn the secret of those\nterrors of which their parents had told them. To be on the track of\nhobgoblin tales--nothing could be more attractive. To have long stories\nto tell like the good housewives. The notion was tempting.\n\nAll this mixture of ideas, in their state of half-confusion,\nhalf-instinct, in the minds of the Guernsey birds'-nesters, finally\nscrewed their courage to the point. They approached the house.\n\nThe little fellow who served them as a sort of moral support in the\nadventure was certainly worthy of their confidence. He was a bold\nboy--an apprentice to a ship-caulker; one of those children who have\nalready become men. He slept on a little straw in a shed in the\nship-caulker's yard, getting his own living, having red hair, and a loud\nvoice; climbing easily up walls and trees, not encumbered with\nprejudices in the matter of property in the apples within his reach; a\nlad who had worked in the repairing dock for vessels of war--a child of\nchance, a happy orphan, born in France, no one knew exactly where; ready\nto give a centime to a beggar; a mischievous fellow, but a good one at\nheart; one who had talked to Parisians. At this time he was earning a\nshilling a day by caulking the fishermen's boats under repair at the\nP\u00c3\u00aaqueries. When he felt inclined he gave himself a holiday, and went\nbirds'-nesting. Such was the little French boy.\n\nThe solitude of the place impressed them with a strange feeling of\ndread. They felt the threatening aspect of the silent house. It was wild\nand savage. The naked and deserted plateau terminated in a precipice at\na short distance from its steep incline. The sea below was quiet. There\nwas no wind. Not a blade of grass stirred.\n\nThe birds'-nesters advanced by slow steps, the French boy at their head,\nand looking towards the house.\n\nOne of them, afterwards relating the story, or as much of it as had\nremained in his head, added, \"It did not speak.\"\n\nThey came nearer, holding their breath, as one might approach a savage\nanimal.\n\nThey had climbed the hill at the side of the house which descended to\nseaward towards a little isthmus of rocks almost inaccessible. Thus they\nhad come pretty near to the building; but they saw only the southern\nside, which was all walled up. They did not dare to approach by the\nother side, where the terrible windows were.\n\nThey grew bolder, however; the caulker's apprentice whispered, \"Let's\nveer to larboard. That's the handsome side. Let's have a look at the\nblack windows.\"\n\nThe little band accordingly \"veered to larboard,\" and came round to the\nother side of the house.\n\nThe two windows were lighted up.\n\nThe boys took to their heels.\n\nWhen they had got to some distance, the French boy, however, returned.\n\n\"Hillo!\" said he, \"the lights have vanished.\"\n\nThe light at the windows had, indeed, disappeared. The outline of the\nbuilding was seen as sharply defined as if stamped out with a punch\nagainst the livid sky.\n\nTheir fear was not abated, but their curiosity had increased. The\nbirds'-nesters approached.\n\nSuddenly the light reappeared at both windows at the same moment.\n\nThe two young urchins from Torteval took to their heels and vanished.\nThe daring French boy did not advance, but he kept his ground.\n\nHe remained motionless, confronting the house and watching it.\n\nThe light disappeared, and appeared again once more. Nothing could be\nmore horrible. The reflection made a vague streak of light upon the\ngrass, wet with the night dew. All of a moment the light cast upon the\nwalls of the house two huge dark profiles, and the shadows of enormous\nheads.\n\nThe house, however, being without ceilings, and having nothing left but\nits four walls and roof, one window could not be lighted without the\nother.\n\nPerceiving that the caulker's apprentice kept his ground, the other\nbirds'-nesters returned, step by step, and one after the other,\ntrembling and curious. The caulker's apprentice whispered to them,\n\"There are ghosts in the house. I have seen the nose of one.\" The two\nTorteval boys got behind their companion, standing tiptoe against his\nshoulder; and thus sheltered, and taking him for their shield, felt\nbolder and watched also.\n\nThe house on its part seemed also to be watching them. There it stood in\nthe midst of that vast darkness and silence, with its two glaring eyes.\nThese were its upper windows. The light vanished, reappeared, and\nvanished again, in the fashion of these unearthly illuminations. These\nsinister intermissions had, probably, some connection with the opening\nand shutting of the infernal regions. The air-hole of a sepulchre has\nthus been seen to produce effects like those from a dark lantern.\n\nSuddenly a dark form, like that of a human being, ascended to one of the\nwindows, as if from without, and plunged into the interior of the house.\n\nTo enter by the window is the custom with spirits.\n\nThe light was for a moment more brilliant, then went out, and appeared\nno more. The house became dark. The noises resembled voices. This is\nalways the case. When there was anything to be seen it is silent. When\nall became invisible again, noises were heard.\n\nThere is a silence peculiar to night-time at sea. The repose of darkness\nis deeper on the water than on the land. When there is neither wind nor\nwave in that wild expanse, over which, in ordinary time, even the flight\nof eagles makes no sound, the movement of a fly could be heard. This\nsepulchral quiet gave a dismal relief to the noises which issued from\nthe house.\n\n\"Let us look,\" said the French boy.\n\nAnd he made a step towards the house.\n\nThe others were so frightened that they resolved to follow him. They did\nnot dare even to run away alone.\n\nJust as they had passed a heap of fagots, which for some mysterious\nreason seemed to inspire them with a little courage in that solitude, a\nwhite owl flew towards them from a bush. The owls have a suspicious sort\nof flight, a sidelong skim which is suggestive of mischief afloat. The\nbird passed near the boys, fixing upon them its round eyes, bright\namidst the darkness.\n\nA shudder ran through the group behind the French boy.\n\nHe looked up at the owl and said:\n\n\"Too late, my bird; I _will_ look.\"\n\nAnd he advanced.\n\nThe crackling sound made by his thick-nailed boots among the furze\nbushes did not prevent his hearing the noise in the house, which rose\nand fell with the continuousness and the calm accent of a dialogue.\n\nA moment afterwards the boy added:\n\n\"Besides, it is only fools who believe in spirits.\"\n\nInsolence in the face of danger rallies the cowardly, and inspirits them\nto go on.\n\nThe two Torteval lads resumed their march, quickening their steps behind\nthe caulker's apprentice.\n\nThe haunted house seemed to them to grow larger before their eyes. This\noptical illusion of fear is founded in reality. The house did indeed\ngrow larger, for they were coming nearer to it.\n\nMeanwhile the voices in the house took a tone more and more distinct.\nThe children listened. The ear, too, has its power of exaggerating. It\nwas different to a murmur, more than a whispering, less than an uproar.\nNow and then one or two words, clearly articulated, could be caught.\nThese words, impossible to be understood, sounded strangely. The boys\nstopped and listened; then went forward again.\n\n\"It's the ghosts talking,\" said the caulker's apprentice; \"but I don't\nbelieve in ghosts.\"\n\nThe Torteval boys were sorely tempted to shrink behind the heap of\nfagots, but they had already left it far behind; and their friend the\ncaulker continued to advance towards the house. They trembled at\nremaining with him; but they dared not leave him.\n\nStep by step, and perplexed, they followed. The caulker's apprentice\nturned towards them and said--\n\n\"You know it isn't true. There are no such things.\"\n\nThe house grew taller and taller. The voices became more and more\ndistinct.\n\nThey drew nearer.\n\nAnd now they could perceive within the house something like a muffled\nlight. It was a faint glimmer, like one of those effects produced by\ndark lanterns, already referred to, and which are common at the midnight\nmeetings of witches.\n\nWhen they were close to the house they halted.\n\nOne of the two Torteval boys ventured on an observation:\n\n\"It isn't spirits: it is ladies dressed in white.\"\n\n\"What's that hanging from the window?\" asked the other.\n\n\"It looks like a rope.\"\n\n\"It's a snake.\"\n\n\"It is only a hangman's rope,\" said the French boy, authoritatively.\n\"That's what they use. Only I don't believe in them.\"\n\nAnd in three bounds, rather than steps, he found himself against the\nwall of the building.\n\nThe two others, trembling, imitated him, and came pressing against him,\none on his right side, the other on his left. The boys applied their\nears to the wall. The sounds continued.\n\nThe following was the conversation of the phantoms:--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Asi, entendido esta?\"\n\n\"Entendido.\"\n\n\"Dicho?\"\n\n\"Dicho.\"\n\n\"Aqui esperara un hombre, y podra marcharse en Inglaterra con\nBlasquito.\"\n\n\"Pagando?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So that is understood?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"As is arranged?\"\n\n\"As is arranged.\"\n\n\"A man will wait here, and can accompany Blasquito to England.\"\n\n\"Paying the expense?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pagando.\"\n\n\"Blasquito tomara al hombre en su barca.\"\n\n\"Sin buscar para conocer a su pais?\"\n\n\"No nos toca.\"\n\n\"Ni a su nombre del hombre?\"\n\n\"No se pide el nombre, pero se pesa la bolsa.\"\n\n\"Bien: esperara el hombre en esa casa.\"\n\n\"Tenga que comer.\"\n\n\"Tendra.\"\n\n\"Onde?\"\n\n\"En este saco que he llevado.\"\n\n\"Muy bien.\"\n\n\"Puedo dexar el saco aqui?\"\n\n\"Los contrabandistas no son ladrones.\"\n\n\"Y vosotros, cuando marchais?\"\n\n\"Ma\u00c3\u00b1ana por la ma\u00c3\u00b1ana.

The children did\nnot listen long. This time they took to flight in earnest; the French\nboy, convinced at last, running even quicker than the others.\n\nOn the Tuesday following this Saturday, Sieur Clubin returned to St.\nMalo, bringing back the Durande.\n\nThe _Tamaulipas_ was still at anchor in the roads.\n\nSieur Clubin, between the whiffs of his pipe, said to the landlord of\nthe Jean Auberge:\n\n\"Well; and when does the _Tamaulipas_ get under way?\"\n\n\"The day after to-morrow--Thursday,\" replied the landlord.\n\nOn that evening, Clubin supped at the coast-guard officers' table; and,\ncontrary to his habit, went out after his supper. The consequence of his\nabsence was, that he could not attend to the office of the Durande, and\nthus lost a little in the matter of freights. This fact was remarked in\na man ordinarily punctual.\n\nIt appeared that he had chatted a few moments with his friend the\nmoney-changer.\n\nHe returned two hours after Noguette had sounded the Curfew bell. The\nBrazilian bell sounds at ten o'clock. It was therefore midnight.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE JACRESSADE\n\n\nForty years ago, St. Malo possessed an alley known by the name of the\n\"Ruelle Coutanchez.\" This alley no longer exists, having been removed\nfor the improvements of the town.\n\nIt was a double row of houses, leaning one towards the other, and\nleaving between them just room enough for a narrow rivulet, which was\ncalled the street. By stretching the legs, it was possible to walk on\nboth sides of the stream, touching with head or elbows, as you went, the\nhouses either on the right or the left. These old relics of medi\u00c3\u00a6val\nNormandy have almost a human interest. Tumbledown houses and sorcerers\nalways go together. Their leaning stories, their overhanging walls,\ntheir bowed penthouses, and their old thick-set irons, seem like lips,\nchin, nose, and eyebrows. The garret window is the blind eye. The walls\nare the wrinkled and blotchy cheeks. The opposite houses lay their\nforeheads together as if they were plotting some malicious deed. All\nthose words of ancient villany--like cut-throat, \"slit-weazand,\" and the\nlike--are closely connected with architecture of this kind.\n\nOne of these houses in the alley--the largest and the most famous, or\nnotorious--was known by the name of the Jacressade.\n\nThe Jacressade was a lodging-house for people who do not lodge. In all\ntowns, and particularly in sea-ports, there is always found beneath the\nlowest stratum of society a sort of residuum: vagabonds who are more\nthan a match for justice; rovers after adventures; chemists of the\nswindling order, who are always dropping their lives into the\nmelting-pot; people in rags of every shape, and in every style of\nwearing them; withered fruits of roguery; bankrupt existences;\nconsciences that have filed their schedule; men who have failed in the\nhouse-breaking trade (for the great masters of burglary move in a higher\nsphere); workmen and workwomen in the trade of wickedness; oddities,\nmale and female; men in coats out at elbows; scoundrels reduced to\nindigence; rogues who have missed the wages of roguery; men who have\nbeen hit in the social duel; harpies who have no longer any prey; petty\nlarceners; _queux_ in the double and unhappy meaning of that word. Such\nare the constituents of that living mass. Human nature is here reduced\nto something bestial. It is the refuse of the social state, heaped up in\nan obscure corner, where from time to time descends that dreaded broom\nwhich is known by the name of police. In St. Malo, the Jacressade was\nthe name of this corner.\n\nIt is not in dens of this sort that we find the high-class\ncriminals--the robbers, forgers, and other great products of ignorance\nand poverty. If murder is represented here, it is generally in the\nperson of some coarse drunkard; in the matter of robbery, the company\nrarely rise higher than the mere sharper. The vagrant is there; but not\nthe highwayman. It would not, however, be safe to trust this\ndistinction. This last stage of vagabondage may have its extremes of\nscoundrelism. It was on an occasion, when casting their nets into the\nEpi-sci\u00c3\u00a9--which was in Paris what the Jacressade was in St. Malo--that\nthe police captured the notorious Lacenaire.\n\nThese lurking-places refuse nobody. To fall in the social scale has a\ntendency to bring men to one level. Sometimes honesty in tatters found\nitself there. Virtue and probity have been known before now to be\nbrought to strange passes. We must not judge always by appearances, even\nin the palace or at the galleys. Public respect, as well as universal\nreprobation, requires testing. Surprising results sometimes spring from\nthis principle. An angel may be discovered in the stews; a pearl in the\ndunghill. Such sad and dazzling discoveries are not altogether unknown.\n\nThe Jacressade was rather a courtyard than a house; and more of a well\nthan a courtyard. It had no stories looking on the street. Its fa\u00c3\u00a7ade\nwas simply a high wall, with a low gateway. You raised the latch, pushed\nthe gate, and were at once in the courtyard.\n\nIn the midst of this yard might be perceived a round hole, encircled\nwith a margin of stones, and even with the ground. The yard was small,\nthe well large. A broken pavement surrounded it.\n\nThe courtyard was square, and built on three sides only. On the side of\nthe street was only the wall; facing you as you entered the gateway\nstood the house, the two wings of which formed the sides to right and\nleft.\n\nAny one entering there after nightfall, at his own risk and peril, would\nhave heard a confused murmur of voices; and, if there had been moonlight\nor starlight enough to give shape to the obscure forms before his eyes,\nthis is what he would have seen.\n\nThe courtyard: the well. Around the courtyard, in front of the gate, a\nlean-to or shed, in a sort of horse-shoe form, but with square corners;\na rotten gallery, with a roof of joists supported by stone pillars at\nunequal distances. In the centre, the well; around the well, upon a\nlitter of straw, a kind of circular chaplet, formed of the soles of\nboots and shoes; some trodden down at heel, some showing the toes of the\nwearers, some the naked heels. The feet of men, women, and children, all\nasleep.\n\nBeyond these feet, the eye might have distinguished, in the shadow of\nthe shed, bodies, drooping heads, forms stretched out lazily, bundles of\nrags of both sexes, a promiscuous assemblage, a strange and revolting\nmass of life. The accommodation of this sleeping chamber was open to\nall, at the rate of two sous a week. On a stormy night the rain fell\nupon the feet, the whirling snow settled on the bodies of those wretched\nsleepers.\n\nWho were these people? The unknown. They came there at night, and\ndeparted in the morning. Creatures of this kind form part of the social\nfabric. Some stole in during the darkness, and paid nothing. The greater\npart had scarcely eaten during the day. All kinds of vice and baseness,\nevery sort of moral infection, every species of distress were there. The\nsame sleep settled down upon all in this bed of filth. The dreams of all\nthese companions in misery went on side by side. A dismal meeting-place,\nwhere misery and weakness, half-sobered debauchery, weariness from long\nwalking to and fro, with evil thoughts, in quest of bread, pallor with\nclosed eyelids, remorse, envy, lay mingled and festering in the same\nmiasma, with faces that had the look of death, and dishevelled hair\nmixed with the filth and sweepings of the streets. Such was the putrid\nheap of life fermenting in this dismal spot. An unlucky turn of the\nwheel of fortune, a ship arrived on the day before, a discharge from\nprison, a dark night, or some other chance, had cast them here, to find\na miserable shelter. Every day brought some new accumulation of such\nmisery. Let him enter who would, sleep who could, speak who dared; for\nit was a place of whispers. The new comers hastened to bury themselves\nin the mass, or tried to seek oblivion in sleep, since there was none in\nthe darkness of the place. They snatched what little of themselves they\ncould from the jaws of death. They closed their eyes in that confusion\nof horrors which every day renewed. They were the embodiment of misery,\nthrown off from society, as the scum is from the sea.\n\nIt was not every one who could even get a share of the straw. More than\none figure was stretched out naked upon the flags. They lay down worn\nout with weariness, and awoke paralysed. The well, without lid or\nparapet, and thirty feet in depth, gaped open night and day. Rain fell\naround it; filth accumulated about, and the gutters of the yard ran down\nand filtered through its sides. The pail for drawing the water stood by\nthe side. Those who were thirsty drank there; some, disgusted with life,\ndrowned themselves in it--slipped from their slumber in the filthy shed\ninto that profounder sleep. In the year 1819, the body of a boy, of\nfourteen years old, was taken up out of this well.\n\nTo be safe in this house, it was necessary to be of the \"right sort.\"\nThe uninitiated were regarded with suspicion.\n\nDid these miserable wretches, then, know each other? No; yet they\nscented out the genuine guest of the Jacressade.\n\nThe mistress of the house was a young and rather pretty woman, wearing a\ncap trimmed with ribbons. She washed herself now and then with water\nfrom the well. She had a wooden leg.\n\nAt break of day, the courtyard became empty. Its inmates dispersed.\n\nAn old cock and some other fowls were kept in the courtyard, where they\nraked among the filth of the place all day long. A long horizontal beam,\nsupported by posts, traversed the yard--a gibbet-shaped erection, not\nout of keeping with the associations of the place. Sometimes on the\nmorrow of a rainy-day, a silk dress, mudded and wet, would be seen\nhanging out to dry upon this beam. It belonged to the woman with the\nwooden leg.\n\nOver the shed, and like it, surrounding the yard, was a story, and above\nthis story a loft. A rotten wooden ladder, passing through a hole in\nthe roof of the shed, conducted to this story; and up this ladder the\nwoman would climb, sometimes staggering while its crazy rounds creaked\nbeneath her.\n\nThe occasional lodgers, whether by the week or the night, slept in the\ncourtyard; the regular inmates lived in the house.\n\nWindows without a pane of glass, door-frames with no door, fireplaces\nwithout stoves; such were the chief features of the interior. You might\npass from one room to the other, indifferently, by a long square\naperture which had been the door, or by a triangular hole between the\njoists of the partitions. The fallen plaster of the ceiling lay about\nthe floor. It was difficult to say how the old house still stood erect.\nThe high winds indeed shook it. The lodgers ascended as they could by\nthe worn and slippery steps of the ladder. Everything was open to the\nair. The wintry atmosphere was absorbed into the house, like water into\na sponge. The multitude of spiders seemed alone to guarantee the place\nagainst falling to pieces immediately. There was no sign of furniture.\nTwo or three paillasses were in the corner, their ticking torn in parts,\nand showing more dust than straw within. Here and there were a water-pot\nand an earthen pipkin. A close, disagreeable odour haunted the rooms.\n\nThe windows looked out upon the square yard. The scene was like the\ninterior of a scavenger's cart. The things, not to speak of the human\nbeings, which lay rusting, mouldering, and putrefying there, were\nindescribable. The fragments seemed to fraternise together. Some fell\nfrom the walls, others from the living tenants of the place. The d\u00c3\u00a9bris\nwere sown with their tatters.\n\nBesides the floating population which bivouacked nightly in the square\nyard, the Jacressade had three permanent lodgers--a charcoal man, a\nrag-picker, and a \"gold-maker.\" The charcoal man and the rag-picker\noccupied two of the paillasses of the first story; the \"gold-maker,\" a\nchemist, lodged in the loft, which was called, no one knew why, the\ngarret. Nobody knew where the woman slept. The \"gold-maker\" was a poet\nin a small way. He inhabited a room in the roof, under the tiles--a\nchamber with a narrow window, and a large stone fireplace forming a\ngulf, in which the wind howled at will. The garret window having no\nframe, he had nailed across it a piece of iron sheathing, part of the\nwreck of a ship. This sheathing left little room for the entrance of\nlight and much for the entrance of cold. The charcoal-man paid rent from\ntime to time in the shape of a sack of charcoal; the rag-picker paid\nwith a bowl of grain for the fowls every week; the \"gold-maker\" did not\npay at all. Meanwhile the latter consumed the very house itself for\nfuel. He had pulled down the little woodwork which remained; and every\nnow and then he took from the wall or the roof a lath or some scantling,\nto heat his crucible. Upon the partition, above the rag-picker's\nmattress, might have been seen two columns of figures, marked in chalk\nby the rag-picker himself from week to week--a column of threes, and a\ncolumn of fives--according as the bowl of grain had cost him three\nliards or five centimes. The gold-pot of the \"chemist\" was an old\nfragment of a bomb-shell, promoted by him to the dignity of a crucible,\nin which he mixed his ingredients. The transmutation of metals absorbed\nall his thoughts. He was determined before he died to revenge himself by\nbreaking the windows of orthodox science with the real philosopher's\nstone. His furnace consumed a good deal of wood. The hand-rail of the\nstairs had disappeared. The house was slowly burning away. The landlady\nsaid to him, \"You will leave us nothing but the shell.\" He mollified her\nby addressing her in verses.\n\nSuch was the Jacressade.\n\nA boy of twelve, or, perhaps, sixteen--for he was like a dwarf, with a\nlarge wen upon his neck, and always carrying a broom in his hand--was\nthe domestic of the place.\n\nThe habitu\u00c3\u00a9s entered by the gateway of the courtyard; the public entered\nby the shop.\n\nIn the high wall, facing the street, and to the right of the entrance to\nthe courtyard, was a square opening, serving at once as a door and a\nwindow. This was the shop. The square opening had a shutter and a\nframe--the only shutter in all the house which had hinges and bolts.\nBehind this square aperture, which was open to the street, was a little\nroom, a compartment obtained by curtailing the sleeping shed in the\ncourtyard. Over the door, passers-by read the inscription in charcoal,\n\"Curiosities sold here.\" On three boards, forming the shop front, were\nseveral china pots without ears, a Chinese parasol made of goldbeater's\nskin, and ornamented with figures, torn here and there, and impossible\nto open or shut; fragments of iron, and shapeless pieces of old pottery,\nand dilapidated hats and bonnets, three or four shells, some packets of\nold bone and metal buttons, a tobacco-box with a portrait of\nMarie-Antoinette, and a dog's-eared volume of Boisbertrand's _Algebra_.\nSuch was the stock of the shop; this assortment completed the\n\"curiosities.\" The shop communicated by a back door with the yard in\nwhich was the well. It was furnished with a table and a stool. The woman\nwith a wooden leg presided at the counter.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nNOCTURNAL BUYERS AND MYSTERIOUS SELLERS\n\n\nClubin had been absent from the Jean Auberge all the evening of Tuesday.\nOn the Wednesday night he was absent again.\n\nIn the dusk of that evening, two strangers penetrated into the mazes of\nthe Ruelle Coutanchez. They stopped in front of the Jacressade. One of\nthem knocked at the window; the door of the shop opened, and they\nentered. The woman with the wooden leg met them with the smile which she\nreserved for respectable citizens. There was a candle on the table.\n\nThe strangers were, in fact, respectable citizens. The one who had\nknocked said, \"Good-day, mistress. I have come for that affair.\"\n\nThe woman with the wooden leg smiled again, and went out by the\nback-door leading to the courtyard, and where the well was. A moment\nafterwards the back-door was opened again, and a man stood in the\ndoorway. He wore a cap and a blouse. It was easy to see the shape of\nsomething under his blouse. He had bits of old straw in his clothes, and\nlooked as if he had just been aroused from sleep.\n\nHe advanced and exchanged glances with the strangers. The man in the\nblouse looked puzzled, but cunning; he said--\n\n\"You are the gunsmith?\"\n\nThe one who had tapped at the window replied--\n\n\"Yes; you are the man from Paris?\"\n\n\"Known as Redskin. Yes.\"\n\n\"Show me the thing.\"\n\nThe man took from under his blouse a weapon extremely rare at that\nperiod in Europe. It was a revolver.\n\nThe weapon was new and bright. The two strangers examined it. The one\nwho seemed to know the house, and whom the man in the blouse had called\n\"the gunsmith,\" tried the mechanism. He passed the weapon to the other,\nwho appeared less at home there, and kept his back turned to the light.\n\nThe gunsmith continued--\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nThe man in the blouse replied--\n\n\"I have just brought it from America. Some people bring monkeys,\nparrots, and other animals, as if the French people were savages. For\nmyself I brought this. It is a useful invention.\"\n\n\"How much?\" inquired the gunsmith again.\n\n\"It is a pistol which turns and turns.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Bang! the first fire. Bang! the second fire. Bang! the third fire. What\na hailstorm of bullets! That will do some execution.\"\n\n\"The price?\"\n\n\"There are six barrels.\"\n\n\"Well, well, what do you want for it?\"\n\n\"Six barrels; that is six Louis.\"\n\n\"Will you take five?\"\n\n\"Impossible. One Louis a ball. That is the price.\"\n\n\"Come, let us do business together. Be reasonable.\"\n\n\"I have named a fair price. Examine the weapon, Mr. Gunsmith.\"\n\n\"I have examined it.\"\n\n\"The barrel twists and turns like Talleyrand himself. The weapon ought\nto be mentioned in the _Dictionary of Weathercocks_. It is a gem.\"\n\n\"I have looked at it.\"\n\n\"The barrels are of Spanish make.\"\n\n\"I see they are.\"\n\n\"They are twisted. This is how this twisting is done. They empty into a\nforge the basket of a collector of old iron. They fill it full of these\nold scraps, with old nails, and broken horseshoes swept out of farriers'\nshops.\"\n\n\"And old sickle-blades.\"\n\n\"I was going to say so, Mr. Gunsmith. They apply to all this rubbish a\ngood sweating heat, and this makes a magnificent material for\ngun-barrels.\"\n\n\"Yes; but it may have cracks, flaws, or crosses.\"\n\n\"True; but they remedy the crosses by little twists, and avoid the risk\nof doublings by beating hard. They bring their mass of iron under the\ngreat hammer; give it two more good sweating heats. If the iron has been\nheated too much, they re-temper it with dull heats, and lighter hammers.\nAnd then they take out their stuff and roll it well; and with this iron\nthey manufacture you a weapon like this.\"\n\n\"You are in the trade, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I am of all trades.\"\n\n\"The barrels are pale-coloured.\"\n\n\"That's the beauty of them, Mr. Gunsmith. The tint is obtained with\nantimony.\"\n\n\"It is settled, then, that we give you five Louis?\"\n\n\"Allow me to observe that I had the honour of saying six.\"\n\nThe gunsmith lowered his voice.\n\n\"Hark you, master. Take advantage of the opportunity. Get rid of this\nthing. A weapon of this kind is of no use to a man like you. It will\nmake you remarked.\"\n\n\"It is very true,\" said the Parisian. \"It is rather conspicuous. It is\nmore suited to a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Will you take five Louis?\"\n\n\"No, six; one for every shot.\"\n\n\"Come, six Napoleons.\"\n\n\"I will have six Louis.\"\n\n\"You are not a Bonapartist, then. You prefer a Louis to a Napoleon.\"\n\nThe Parisian nicknamed \"Redskin\" smiled.\n\n\"A Napoleon is greater,\" said he, \"but a Louis is worth more.\"\n\n\"Six Napoleons.\"\n\n\"Six Louis. It makes a difference to me of four-and-twenty francs.\"\n\n\"The bargain is off in that case.\"\n\n\"Good: I keep the toy.\"\n\n\"Keep it.\"\n\n\"Beating me down! a good idea! It shall never be said that I got rid\nlike that of a wonderful specimen of ingenuity.\"\n\n\"Good-night, then.\"\n\n\"It marks a whole stage in the progress of making pistols, which the\nChesapeake Indians call Nortay-u-Hah.\"\n\n\"Five Louis, ready money. Why, it is a handful of gold.\"\n\n\"'Nortay-u-Hah,' that signifies 'short gun.' A good many people don't\nknow that.\"\n\n\"Will you take five Louis, and just a bit of silver?\"\n\n\"I said six, master.\"\n\nThe man who kept his back to the candle, and who had not yet spoken, was\nspending his time during the dialogue in turning and testing the\nmechanism of the pistol. He approached the armourer's ear and\nwhispered--\n\n\"Is it a good weapon?\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"I will give the six Louis.\"\n\nFive minutes afterwards, while the Parisian nicknamed \"Redskin\" was\ndepositing the six Louis which he had just received in a secret slit\nunder the breast of his blouse, the armourer and his companion carrying\nthe revolver in his trousers pocket, stepped out into the straggling\nstreet.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nA \"CANNON\" OFF THE RED BALL AND THE BLACK\n\n\nOn the morrow, which was a Thursday, a tragic circumstance occurred at a\nshort distance from St. Malo, near the peak of the \"D\u00c3\u00a9coll\u00c3\u00a9,\" a spot\nwhere the cliff is high and the sea deep.\n\nA line of rocks in the form of the top of a lance, and connecting\nthemselves with the land by a narrow isthmus, stretch out there into the\nwater, ending abruptly with a large peak-shaped breaker. Nothing is\ncommoner in the architecture of the sea. In attempting to reach the\nplateau of the peaked rock from the shore, it was necessary to follow an\ninclined plane, the ascent of which was here and there somewhat steep.\n\nIt was upon a plateau of this kind, towards four o'clock in the\nafternoon, that a man was standing, enveloped in a large military cape,\nand armed; a fact easy to be perceived from certain straight and angular\nfolds in his mantle. The summit on which this man was resting was a\nrather extensive platform, dotted with large masses of rock, like\nenormous paving-stones, leaving between them narrow passages. This\nplatform, on which a kind of thick, short grass grew here and there,\ncame to an end on the sea side in an open space, leading to a\nperpendicular escarpment. The escarpment, rising about sixty feet above\nthe level of the sea, seemed cut down by the aid of a plumb-line. Its\nleft angle, however, was broken away, and formed one of those natural\nstaircases common to granite cliffs worn by the sea, the steps of which\nare somewhat inconvenient, requiring sometimes the strides of a giant or\nthe leaps of an acrobat. These stages of rock descended perpendicularly\nto the sea, where they were lost. It was a break-neck place. However, in\ncase of absolute necessity, a man might succeed in embarking there,\nunder the very wall of the cliff.\n\nA breeze was sweeping the sea. The man wrapped in his cape and standing\nfirm, with his left hand grasping his right shoulder, closed one eye,\nand applied the other to a telescope. He seemed absorbed in anxious\nscrutiny. He had approached the edge of the escarpment, and stood there\nmotionless, his gaze immovably fixed on the horizon. The tide was high;\nthe waves were beating below against the foot of the cliffs.\n\nThe object which the stranger was observing was a vessel in the offing,\nand which was manoeuvring in a strange manner. The vessel, which had\nhardly left the port of St. Malo an hour, had stopped behind the\nBanquetiers. It had not cast anchor, perhaps because the bottom would\nonly have permitted it to bear to leeward on the edge of the cable, and\nbecause the ship would have strained on her anchor under the cutwater.\nHer captain had contented himself with lying-to.\n\nThe stranger, who was a coast-guardman, as was apparent from his uniform\ncape, watched all the movements of the three-master, and seemed to note\nthem mentally. The vessel was lying-to, a little off the wind, which was\nindicated by the backing of the small topsail, and the bellying of the\nmain-topsail. She had squared the mizen, and set the topmast as close as\npossible, and in such a manner as to work the sails against each other,\nand to make little way either on or off shore. Her captain evidently did\nnot care to expose his vessel much to the wind, for he had only braced\nup the small mizen-topsail. In this way, coming crossway on, he did not\ndrift at the utmost more than half a league an hour.\n\nIt was still broad daylight, particularly on the open sea, and on the\nheights of the cliff. The shores below were becoming dark.\n\nThe coast-guardman, still engaged in his duty, and carefully scanning\nthe offing, had not thought of observing the rocks at his side and at\nhis feet. He turned his back towards the difficult sort of causeway\nwhich formed the communication between his resting-place and the shore.\nHe did not, therefore, remark that something was moving in that\ndirection. Behind a fragment of rock, among the steps of that causeway,\nsomething like the figure of a man had been concealed, according to all\nappearances, since the arrival of the coast-guardman. From time to time\na head issued from the shadow behind the rock; looked up and watched the\nwatcher. The head, surmounted by a wide-brimmed American hat, was that\nof the Quaker-looking man, who, ten days before, was talking among the\nstones of the Petit-Bey to Captain Zuela.\n\nSuddenly, the curiosity of the coast-guardman seemed to be still more\nstrongly awakened. He polished the glass of his telescope quickly with\nhis sleeve, and brought it to bear closely upon the three-master.\n\nA little black spot seemed to detach itself from her side.\n\nThe black spot, looking like a small insect upon the water, was a boat.\n\nThe boat seemed to be making for the shore. It was manned by several\nsailors, who were pulling vigorously.\n\nShe pulled crosswise by little and little, and appeared to be\napproaching the Pointe du D\u00c3\u00a9coll\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe gaze of the coast-guardman seemed to have reached its most intense\npoint. No movement of the boat escaped it. He had approached nearer\nstill to the verge of the rock.\n\nAt that instant a man of large stature appeared on one of the rocks\nbehind him. It was the Quaker. The officer did not see him.\n\nThe man paused an instant, his arms at his sides, but with his fists\ndoubled; and with the eye of a hunter, watching for his prey, he\nobserved the back of the officer.\n\nFour steps only separated them. He put one foot forward, then stopped;\ntook a second step, and stopped again. He made no movement except the\nact of walking; all the rest of his body was motionless as a statue. His\nfoot fell upon the tufts of grass without noise. He made a third step,\nand paused again. He was almost within reach of the coast-guard, who\nstood there still motionless with his telescope. The man brought his two\nclosed fists to a level with his collar-bone, then struck out his arms\nsharply, and his two fists, as if thrown from a sling, struck the\ncoast-guardman on the two shoulders. The shock was decisive. The\ncoast-guardman had not the time to utter a cry. He fell head first from\nthe height of the rock into the sea. His boots appeared in the air about\nthe time occupied by a flash of lightning. It was like the fall of a\nstone in the sea, which instantly closed over him.\n\nTwo or three circles widened out upon the dark water.\n\nNothing remained but the telescope, which had dropped from the hands of\nthe man, and lay upon the turf.\n\nThe Quaker leaned over the edge of the escarpment a moment, watched the\ncircles vanishing on the water, waited a few minutes, and then rose\nagain, singing in a low voice:\n\n    \"The captain of police is dead,\n    Through having lost his life.\"\n\nHe knelt down a second time. Nothing reappeared. Only at the spot where\nthe officer had been engulfed, he observed on the surface of the water a\nsort of dark spot, which became diffused with the gentle lapping of the\nwaves. It seemed probable that the coast-guardman had fractured his\nskull against some rock under water, and that his blood caused the spot\nin the foam. The Quaker, while considering the meaning of this spot,\nbegan to sing again:\n\n    \"Not very long before he died,\n    The luckless man was still alive.\"\n\nHe did not finish his song.\n\nHe heard an extremely soft voice behind him, which said:\n\n\"Is that you, Rantaine? Good-day. You have just killed a man!\"\n\nHe turned. About fifteen paces behind him, in one of the passages\nbetween the rocks, stood a little man holding a revolver in his hand.\n\nThe Quaker answered:\n\n\"As you see. Good-day, Sieur Clubin.\"\n\nThe little man started.\n\n\"You know me?\"\n\n\"You knew me very well,\" replied Rantaine.\n\nMeanwhile they could hear a sound of oars on the sea. It was the\napproach of the boat which the officer had observed.\n\nSieur Clubin said in a low tone, as if speaking to himself:\n\n\"It was done quickly.\"\n\n\"What can I do to oblige you?\" asked Rantaine.\n\n\"Oh, a trifling matter! It is very nearly ten years since I saw you. You\nmust have been doing well. How are you?\"\n\n\"Well enough,\" answered Rantaine. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Clubin.\n\nRantaine advanced a step towards Clubin.\n\nA little sharp click caught his ear. It was Sieur Clubin who was cocking\nhis revolver.\n\n\"Rantaine, there are about fifteen paces between us. It is a nice\ndistance. Remain where you are.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Rantaine. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I! Oh, I have come to have a chat with you.\"\n\nRantaine did not offer to move again. Sieur Clubin continued:\n\n\"You assassinated a coast-guardman just now.\"\n\nRantaine lifted the flap of his hat, and replied:\n\n\"You have already done me the honour to mention it.\"\n\n\"Exactly; but in terms less precise. I said a man: I say now, a\ncoast-guardman. The man wore the number 619. He was the father of a\nfamily; leaves a wife and five children.\"\n\n\"That is no doubt correct,\" said Rantaine.\n\nThere was a momentary pause.\n\n\"They are picked men--those coast-guard people,\" continued Clubin;\n\"almost all old sailors.\"\n\n\"I have remarked,\" said Rantaine, \"that people generally do leave a wife\nand five children.\"\n\nSieur Clubin continued:\n\n\"Guess how much this revolver cost me?\"\n\n\"It is a pretty tool,\" said Rantaine.\n\n\"What do you guess it at?\"\n\n\"I should guess it at a good deal.\"\n\n\"It cost me one hundred and forty-four francs.\"\n\n\"You must have bought that,\" said Rantaine, \"at the shop in the Ruelle\nCoutanchez.\"\n\nClubin continued:\n\n\"He did not cry out. The fall stopped his voice, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Sieur Clubin, there will be a breeze to-night.\"\n\n\"I am the only one in the secret.\"\n\n\"Do you still stay at the Jean Auberge?\"\n\n\"Yes: you are not badly served there.\"\n\n\"I remember getting some excellent sour-krout there.\"\n\n\"You must be exceedingly strong, Rantaine. What shoulders you have! I\nshould be sorry to get a tap from you. I, on the other hand, when I came\ninto the world, looked so spare and sickly, that they despaired of\nrearing me.\"\n\n\"They succeeded though; which was lucky.\"\n\n\"Yes: I still stay at the Jean Auberge.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Sieur Clubin, how I recognised you? It was from your\nhaving recognised me. I said to myself, there is nobody like Sieur\nClubin for that.\"\n\nAnd he advanced a step.\n\n\"Stand back where you were, Rantaine.\"\n\nRantaine fell back, and said to himself:\n\n\"A fellow becomes like a child before one of those weapons.\"\n\nSieur Clubin continued:\n\n\"The position of affairs is this: we have on our right, in the direction\nof St. Enogat, at about three hundred paces from here, another\ncoast-guardman--his number is 618--who is still alive; and on our left,\nin the direction of St. Lunaire--a customs station. That makes seven\narmed men who could be here, if necessary, in five minutes. The rock\nwould be surrounded; the way hither guarded. Impossible to elude them.\nThere is a corpse at the foot of this rock.\"\n\nRantaine took a side-way glance at the revolver.\n\n\"As you say, Rantaine, it is a pretty tool. Perhaps it is only loaded\nwith powder; but what does that matter? A report would be enough to\nbring an armed force--and I have six barrels here.\"\n\nThe measured sound of the oars became very distinct. The boat was not\nfar off.\n\nThe tall man regarded the little man curiously. Sieur Clubin spoke in a\nvoice more and more soft and subdued.\n\n\"Rantaine, the men in the boat which is coming, knowing what you did\nhere just now, would lend a hand and help to arrest you. You are to pay\nCaptain Zuela ten thousand francs for your passage. You would have made\na better bargain, by the way, with the smugglers of Pleinmont; but they\nwould only have taken you to England; and besides, you cannot risk going\nto Guernsey, where they have the pleasure of knowing you. To return,\nthen, to the position of affairs--if I fire, you are arrested. You are\nto pay Zuela for your passage ten thousand francs. You have already paid\nhim five thousand in advance. Zuela would keep the five thousand and be\ngone. These are the facts. Rantaine, you have managed your masquerading\nvery well. That hat--that queer coat--and those gaiters make a wonderful\nchange. You forgot the spectacles; but did right to let your whiskers\ngrow.\"\n\nRantaine smiled spasmodically. Clubin continued:\n\n\"Rantaine, you have on a pair of American breeches, with a double fob.\nIn one side you keep your watch. Take care of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sieur Clubin.\"\n\n\"In the other is a little box made of wrought iron, which opens and\nshuts with a spring. It is an old sailor's tobacco-box. Take it out of\nyour pocket, and throw it over to me.\"\n\n\"Why, this is robbery.\"\n\n\"You are at liberty to call the coast-guardman.\"\n\nAnd Clubin fixed his eye on Rantaine.\n\n\"Stay, Mess Clubin,\" said Rantaine, making a slight forward movement,\nand holding out his open hand.\n\nThe title \"Mess\" was a delicate flattery.\n\n\"Stay where you are, Rantaine.\"\n\n\"Mess Clubin, let us come to terms. I offer you half.\"\n\nClubin crossed his arms, still showing the barrels of his revolver.\n\n\"Rantaine, what do you take me for? I am an honest man.\"\n\nAnd he added after a pause:\n\n\"I must have the whole.\"\n\nRantaine muttered between his teeth, \"This fellow's of a stern sort.\"\n\nThe eye of Clubin lighted up, his voice became clear and sharp as steel.\nHe cried:\n\n\"I see that you are labouring under a mistake. Robbery is your name, not\nmine. My name is Restitution. Hark you, Rantaine. Ten years ago you left\nGuernsey one night, taking with you the cash-box of a certain\npartnership concern, containing fifty thousand francs which belonged to\nyou, but forgetting to leave behind you fifty thousand francs which were\nthe property of another. Those fifty thousand francs, the money of your\npartner, the excellent and worthy Mess Lethierry, make at present, at\ncompound interest, calculated for ten years, eighty thousand six hundred\nand sixty-six francs. You went into a money-changer's yesterday. I'll\ngive you his name--R\u00c3\u00a9buchet, in St. Vincent Street. You counted out to\nhim seventy-six thousand francs in French bank-notes; in exchange for\nwhich he gave you three notes of the Bank of England for one thousand\npounds sterling each, plus the exchange. You put these bank-notes in the\niron tobacco-box, and the iron tobacco-box into your double fob on the\nright-hand side. On the part of Mess Lethierry, I shall be content with\nthat. I start to-morrow for Guernsey, and intend to hand it to him.\nRantaine, the three-master lying-to out yonder is the _Tamaulipas_. You\nhave had your luggage put aboard there with the other things belonging\nto the crew. You want to leave France. You have your reasons. You are\ngoing to Arequipa. The boat is coming to fetch you. You are awaiting it.\nIt is at hand. You can hear it. It depends on me whether you go or stay.\nNo more words. Fling me the tobacco-box.\"\n\nRantaine dipped his hand in the fob, drew out a little box, and threw it\nto Clubin. It was the iron tobacco-box. It fell and rolled at Clubin's\nfeet.\n\nClubin knelt without lowering his gaze; felt about for the box with his\nleft hand, keeping all the while his eyes and the six barrels of the\nrevolver fixed upon Rantaine.\n\nThen he cried:\n\n\"Turn your back, my friend.\"\n\nRantaine turned his back.\n\nSieur Clubin put the revolver under one arm, and touched the spring of\nthe tobacco-box. The lid flew open.\n\nIt contained four bank-notes; three of a thousand pounds, and one of ten\npounds.\n\nHe folded up the three bank-notes of a thousand pounds each, replaced\nthem in the iron tobacco-box, shut the lid again, and put it in his\npocket.\n\nThen he picked up a stone, wrapped it in the ten-pound note, and said:\n\n\"You may turn round again.\"\n\nRantaine turned.\n\nSieur Clubin continued:\n\n\"I told you I would be contented with three thousand pounds. Here, I\nreturn you ten pounds.\"\n\nAnd he threw to Rantaine the note enfolding the stone.\n\nRantaine, with a movement of his foot, sent the bank-note and the stone\ninto the sea.\n\n\"As you please,\" said Clubin. \"You must be rich. I am satisfied.\"\n\nThe noise of oars, which had been continually drawing nearer during the\ndialogue, ceased. They knew by this that the boat had arrived at the\nbase of the cliff.\n\n\"Your vehicle waits below. You can go, Rantaine.\"\n\nRantaine advanced towards the steps of stones, and rapidly disappeared.\n\nClubin moved cautiously towards the edge of the escarpment, and watched\nhim descending.\n\nThe boat had stopped near the last stage of the rocks, at the very spot\nwhere the coast-guardman had fallen.\n\nStill observing Rantaine stepping from stone to stone, Clubin muttered:\n\n\"A good number 619. He thought himself alone. Rantaine thought there\nwere only two there. I alone knew that there were three.\"\n\nHe perceived at his feet the telescope which had dropped from the hands\nof the coast-guardman.\n\nThe sound of oars was heard again. Rantaine had stepped into the boat,\nand the rowers had pushed out to sea.\n\nWhen Rantaine was safely in the boat, and the cliff was beginning to\nrecede from his eyes, he arose again abruptly. His features were\nconvulsed with rage; he clenched his fist and cried:\n\n\"Ha! he is the devil himself; a villain!\"\n\nA few seconds later, Clubin, from the top of the rock, while bringing\nhis telescope to bear upon the boat, heard distinctly the following\nwords articulated by a loud voice, and mingling with the noise of the\nsea:\n\n\"Sieur Clubin, you are an honest man; but you will not be offended if I\nwrite to Lethierry to acquaint him with this matter; and we have here in\nthe boat a sailor from Guernsey, who is one of the crew of the\n_Tamaulipas_; his name is Ahier-Tostevin, and he will return to St. Malo\non Zuela's next voyage, to bear testimony to the fact of my having\nreturned to you, on Mess Lethierry's account, the sum of three thousand\npounds sterling.\"\n\nIt was Rantaine's voice.\n\nClubin rarely did things by halves. Motionless as the coast-guardman had\nbeen, and in the exact same place, his eye still at the telescope, he\ndid not lose sight of the boat for one moment. He saw it growing less\namidst the waves; watched it disappear and reappear, and approach the\nvessel, which was lying-to; finally he recognised the tall figure of\nRantaine on the deck of the _Tamaulipas_.\n\nWhen the boat was raised, and slung again to the davits, the\n_Tamaulipas_ was in motion once more. The land-breeze was fresh, and she\nspread all her sails. Clubin's glass continued fixed upon her outline\ngrowing more and more indistinct; until half an hour later, when the\n_Tamaulipas_ had become only a dark shape upon the horizon, growing\nsmaller and smaller against the pale twilight in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nUSEFUL INFORMATION FOR PERSONS WHO EXPECT OR FEAR THE ARRIVAL OF LETTERS\nFROM BEYOND SEA\n\n\nOn that evening, Sieur Clubin returned late.\n\nOne of the causes of his delay was, that before going to his inn, he had\npaid a visit to the Dinan gate of the town, a place where there were\nseveral wine-shops. In one of these wine-shops, where he was not known,\nhe had bought a bottle of brandy, which he placed in the pocket of his\novercoat, as if he desired to conceal it. Then, as the Durande was to\nstart on the following morning, he had taken a turn aboard to satisfy\nhimself that everything was in order.\n\nWhen Sieur Clubin returned to the Jean Auberge, there was no one left in\nthe lower room except the old sea-captain, M. Gertrais-Gaboureau, who\nwas drinking a jug of ale and smoking his pipe.\n\nM. Gertrais-Gaboureau saluted Sieur Clubin between a whiff and a draught\nof ale.\n\n\"How d'ye do, Captain Clubin?\"\n\n\"Good evening, Captain Gertrais.\"\n\n\"Well, the _Tamaulipas_ is gone.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Clubin, \"I did not observe.\"\n\nCaptain Gertrais-Gaboureau expectorated, and said:\n\n\"Zuela has decamped.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"This evening.\"\n\n\"Where is he gone?\"\n\n\"To the devil.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but where is that?\"\n\n\"To Arequipa.\"\n\n\"I knew nothing of it,\" said Clubin.\n\nHe added:\n\n\"I am going to bed.\"\n\nHe lighted his candle, walked towards the door, and returned.\n\n\"Have you ever been at Arequipa, Captain?\"\n\n\"Yes; some years ago.\"\n\n\"Where do they touch on that voyage?\"\n\n\"A little everywhere; but the _Tamaulipas_ will touch nowhere.\"\n\nM. Gertrais-Gaboureau emptied his pipe upon the corner of a plate and\ncontinued:\n\n\"You know the lugger called the _Trojan Horse_, and that fine\nthree-master, the _Trentemouzin_, which are gone to Cardiff? I was\nagainst their sailing on account of the weather. They have returned in a\nfine state. The lugger was laden with turpentine; she sprang a leak, and\nin working the pumps they pumped up with the water all her cargo. As to\nthe three-master, she has suffered most above water. Her cutwater, her\nheadrail, the stock of her larboard anchor are broken. Her standing\njibboom is gone clean by the cap. As for the jib-shrouds and bobstays,\ngo and see what they look like. The mizenmast is not injured, but has\nhad a severe shock. All the iron of the bowsprit has given way; and it\nis an extraordinary fact that, though the bowsprit itself is not\nscratched, it is completely stripped. The larboard-bow of the vessel is\nstove in a good three feet square. This is what comes of not taking\nadvice.\"\n\nClubin had placed the candle on the table, and had begun to readjust a\nrow of pins which he kept in the collar of his overcoat. He continued:\n\n\"Didn't you say, Captain, that the _Tamaulipas_ would not touch\nanywhere?\"\n\n\"Yes; she goes direct to Chili.\"\n\n\"In that case, she can send no news of herself on the voyage.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Captain Clubin. In the first place, she can send any\nletters by vessels she may meet sailing for Europe.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Then there is the ocean letter-box.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the ocean letter-box?\"\n\n\"Don't you know what that is, Captain Clubin?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"When you pass the straits of Magellan----\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Snow all round you; always bad weather; ugly down-easters, and bad\nseas.\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"When you have doubled Cape Monmouth----\"\n\n\"Well, what next?\"\n\n\"Then you double Cape Valentine.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Why, then you double Cape Isidore.\"\n\n\"And afterwards?\"\n\n\"You double Point Anne.\"\n\n\"Good. But what is it you call the ocean letter-box?\"\n\n\"We are coming to that. Mountains on the right, mountains on the left.\nPenguins and stormy petrels all about. A terrible place. Ah! by Jove,\nwhat a howling and what cracks you get there! The hurricane wants no\nhelp. That's the place for holding on to the sheer-rails; for reefing\ntopsails. That's where you take in the mainsail, and fly the jibsail; or\ntake in the jibsail and try the stormjib. Gusts upon gusts! And then,\nsometimes four, five, or six days of scudding under bare poles. Often\nonly a rag of canvas left. What a dance! Squalls enough to make a\nthree-master skip like a flea. I saw once a cabin-boy hanging on to the\njibboom of an English brig, the _True Blue_, knocked, jibboom and all,\nto ten thousand nothings. Fellows are swept into the air there like\nbutterflies. I saw the second mate of the _Revenue_, a pretty schooner,\nknocked from under the forecross-tree, and killed dead. I have had my\nsheer-rails smashed, and come out with all my sails in ribbons. Frigates\nof fifty guns make water like wicker baskets. And the damnable coast!\nNothing can be imagined more dangerous. Rocks all jagged-edged. You\ncome, by and by, to Port Famine. There it's worse and worse. The worst\nseas I ever saw in my life. The devil's own latitudes. All of a sudden\nyou spy the words, painted in red, 'Post Office.'\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Captain Gertrais?\"\n\n\"I mean, Captain Clubin, that immediately after doubling Point Anne you\nsee, on a rock, a hundred feet high, a great post with a barrel\nsuspended to the top. This barrel is the letter-box. The English sailors\nmust needs go and write up there 'Post Office.' What had they to do with\nit? It is the ocean post-office. It isn't the property of that worthy\ngentleman, the King of England. The box is common to all. It belongs to\nevery flag. _Post Office!_ there's a crack-jaw word for you. It produces\nan effect on me as if the devil had suddenly offered me a cup of tea. I\nwill tell you now how the postal arrangements are carried out. Every\nvessel which passes sends to the post a boat with despatches. A vessel\ncoming from the Atlantic, for instance, sends there its letters for\nEurope; and a ship coming from the Pacific, its letters for New Zealand\nor California. The officer in command of the boat puts his packet into\nthe barrel, and takes away any packet he finds there. You take charge of\nthese letters, and the ship which comes after you takes charge of yours.\nAs ships are always going to and fro, the continent whence you come is\nthat to which I am going. I carry your letters; you carry mine. The\nbarrel is made fast to the post with a chain. And it rains, snows and\nhails! A pretty sea. The imps of Satan fly about on every side. The\n_Tamaulipas_ will pass there. The barrel has a good lid with a hinge,\nbut no padlock. You see, a fellow can write to his friends this way. The\nletters come safely.\"\n\n\"It is very curious,\" muttered Clubin thoughtfully.\n\nCaptain Gertrais-Gaboureau returned to his bottle of ale.\n\n\"If that vagabond Zuela should write (continued Clubin aside), the\nscoundrel puts his scrawl into the barrel at Magellan, and in four\nmonths I have his letter.\"\n\n\"Well, Captain Clubin, do you start to-morrow?\"\n\nClubin, absorbed in a sort of somnambulism, did not notice the question;\nand Captain Gertrais repeated it.\n\nClubin woke up.\n\n\"Of course, Captain Gertrais. It is my day. I must start to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"If it was my case, I shouldn't, Captain Clubin. The hair of the dog's\ncoat feels damp. For two nights past, the sea-birds have been flying\nwildly round the lanthorn of the lighthouse. A bad sign. I have a\nstorm-glass, too, which gives me a warning. The moon is at her second\nquarter; it is the maximum of humidity. I noticed to-day some pimpernels\nwith their leaves shut, and a field of clover with its stalks all stiff.\nThe worms come out of the ground to-day; the flies sting; the bees keep\nclose to their hives; the sparrows chatter together. You can hear the\nsound of bells from far off. I heard to-night the Angelus at St.\nLunaire. And then the sun set angry. There will be a good fog to-morrow,\nmark my words. I don't advise you to put to sea. I dread the fog a good\ndeal more than a hurricane. It's a nasty neighbour that.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI\n\nTHE DRUNKEN STEERSMAN AND THE SOBER CAPTAIN\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE DOUVRES\n\n\nAt about five leagues out, in the open sea, to the south of Guernsey,\nopposite Pleinmont Point, and between the Channel Islands and St. Malo,\nthere is a group of rocks, called the Douvres. The spot is dangerous.\n\nThis term Douvres, applied to rocks and cliffs, is very common. There\nis, for example, near the _C\u00c3\u00b4tes du Nord_, a Douvre, on which a\nlighthouse is now being constructed, a dangerous reef; but one which\nmust not be confounded with the rock above referred to.\n\nThe nearest point on the French coast to the Douvres is Cape Br\u00c3\u00a9hat. The\nDouvres are a little further from the coast of France than from the\nnearest of the Channel Islands. The distance from Jersey may be pretty\nnearly measured by the extreme length of Jersey. If the island of Jersey\ncould be turned round upon Corbi\u00c3\u00a8re, as upon a hinge, St. Catherine's\nPoint would almost touch the Douvres, at a distance of more than four\nleagues.\n\nIn these civilised regions the wildest rocks are rarely desert places.\nSmugglers are met with at Hagot, custom-house men at Binic, Celts at\nBr\u00c3\u00a9hat, oyster-dredgers at Cancale, rabbit-shooters at C\u00c3\u00a9sambre or\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar's Island, crab-gatherers at Brecqhou, trawlers at the Minquiers,\ndredgers at Ecr\u00c3\u00a9hou, but no one is ever seen upon the Douvres.\n\nThe sea birds alone make their home there.\n\nNo spot in the ocean is more dreaded. The Casquets, where it is said the\n_Blanche Nef_ was lost; the Bank of Calvados; the Needles in the Isle of\nWight; the Ronesse, which makes the coast of Beaulieu so dangerous; the\nsunken reefs at Pr\u00c3\u00a9el, which block the entrance to Merquel, and which\nnecessitates the red-painted beacon in twenty fathoms of water, the\ntreacherous approaches to Etables and Plouha; the two granite Druids to\nthe south of Guernsey, the Old Anderlo and the Little Anderlo, the\nCorbi\u00c3\u00a8re, the Hanways, the Isle of Ras, associated with terror in the\nproverb:\n\n    \"_Si jamais tu passes le Ras,\n    Si tu ne meurs, tu trembleras._\"\n\nthe Mortes-Femmes, the D\u00c3\u00a9route between Guernsey and Jersey, the Hardent\nbetween the Minquiers and Chousey, the Mauvais Cheval between Bouley Bay\nand Barneville, have not so evil a reputation. It would be preferable to\nhave to encounter all these dangers, one after the other, than the\nDouvres once.\n\nIn all that perilous sea of the Channel, which is the Egean of the West,\nthe Douvres have no equal in their terrors, except the Paternoster\nbetween Guernsey and Sark.\n\nFrom the Paternoster, however, it is possible to give a signal--a ship\nin distress there may obtain succour. To the north rises Dicard or\nD'Icare Point, and to the south Grosnez. From the Douvres you can see\nnothing.\n\nIts associations are the storm, the cloud, the wild sea, the desolate\nwaste, the uninhabited coast. The blocks of granite are hideous and\nenormous--everywhere perpendicular wall--the severe inhospitality of the\nabyss.\n\nIt is in the open sea; the water about is very deep. A rock completely\nisolated like the Douvres attracts and shelters creatures which shun the\nhaunts of men. It is a sort of vast submarine cave of fossil coral\nbranches--a drowned labyrinth. There, at a depth to which divers would\nfind it difficult to descend, are caverns, haunts, and dusky mazes,\nwhere monstrous creatures multiply and destroy each other. Huge crabs\ndevour fish and are devoured in their turn. Hideous shapes of living\nthings, not created to be seen by human eyes, wander in this twilight.\nVague forms of antenn\u00c3\u00a6, tentacles, fins, open jaws, scales, and claws,\nfloat about there, quivering, growing larger, or decomposing and\nperishing in the gloom, while horrible swarms of swimming things prowl\nabout seeking their prey.\n\nTo gaze into the depths of the sea is, in the imagination, like\nbeholding the vast unknown, and from its most terrible point of view.\nThe submarine gulf is analogous to the realm of night and dreams. There\nalso is sleep, unconsciousness, or at least apparent unconsciousness, of\ncreation. There, in the awful silence and darkness, the rude first forms\nof life, phantom-like, demoniacal, pursue their horrible instincts.\n\nForty years ago, two rocks of singular form signalled the Douvres from\nafar to passers on the ocean. They were two vertical points, sharp and\ncurved--their summits almost touching each other. They looked like the\ntwo tusks of an elephant rising out of the sea; but they were tusks,\nhigh as tall towers, of an elephant huge as a mountain. These two\nnatural towers, rising out of the obscure home of marine monsters, only\nleft a narrow passage between them, where the waves rushed through. This\npassage, tortuous and full of angles, resembled a straggling street\nbetween high walls. The two twin rocks are called the Douvres. There was\nthe Great Douvre and the Little Douvre; one was sixty feet high, the\nother forty. The ebb and flow of the tide had at last worn away part of\nthe base of the towers, and a violent equinoctial gale on the 26th of\nOctober, 1859, overthrew one of them. The smaller one, which still\nremains, is worn and tottering.\n\nOne of the most singular of the Douvres is a rock known as \"The Man.\"\nThis still exists. Some fisherman in the last century visiting this spot\nfound on the height of the rock a human body. By its side were a number\nof empty sea-shells. A sailor escaped from shipwreck had found a refuge\nthere; had lived some time upon rock limpets, and had died. Hence its\nname of \"The Man.\"\n\nThe solitudes of the sea are peculiarly dismal. The things which pass\nthere seem to have no relation to the human race; their objects are\nunknown. Such is the isolation of the Douvres. All around, as far as eye\ncan reach, spreads the vast and restless sea.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nAN UNEXPECTED FLASK OF BRANDY\n\n\nOn the Friday morning, the day after the departure of the _Tamaulipas_,\nthe Durande started again for Guernsey.\n\nShe left St. Malo at nine o'clock. The weather was fine; no haze. Old\nCaptain Gertrais-Gaboureau was evidently in his dotage.\n\nSieur Clubin's numerous occupations had decidedly been unfavourable to\nthe collection of freight for the Durande. He had only taken aboard some\npackages of Parisian articles for the fancy shops of St. Peter's Port;\nthree cases for the Guernsey hospital, one containing yellow soap and\nlong candles, and the other French shoe leather for soles, and choice\nCordovan skins. He brought back from his last cargo a case of crushed\nsugar and three chests of congou tea, which the French custom-house\nwould not permit to pass. He had embarked very few cattle; some bullocks\nonly. These bullocks were in the hold loosely tethered.\n\nThere were six passengers aboard; a Guernsey man, two inhabitants of St.\nMalo, dealers in cattle: a \"tourist,\"--a phrase already in vogue at this\nperiod--a Parisian citizen, probably travelling on commercial affairs,\nand an American, engaged in distributing Bibles.\n\nWithout reckoning Clubin, the crew of the Durande amounted to seven men;\na helmsman, a stoker, a ship's carpenter, and a cook--serving as sailors\nin case of need--two engineers, and a cabin boy. One of the two\nengineers was also a practical mechanic. This man, a bold and\nintelligent Dutch negro, who had originally escaped from the sugar\nplantations of Surinam, was named Imbrancam. The negro, Imbrancam,\nunderstood and attended admirably to the engine. In the early days of\nthe \"Devil Boat,\" his black face, appearing now and then at the top of\nthe engine-room stairs, had contributed not a little to sustain its\ndiabolical reputation.\n\nThe helmsman, a native of Guernsey, but of a family originally from\nCotentin, bore the name of Tangrouille. The Tangrouilles were an old\nnoble family.\n\nThis was strictly true. The Channel Islands are like England, an\naristocratic region. Castes exist there still. The castes have their\npeculiar ideas, which are, in fact, their protection. These notions of\ncaste are everywhere similar; in Hindostan, as in Germany, nobility is\nwon by the sword; lost by soiling the hands with labour: but preserved\nby idleness. To do nothing, is to live nobly; whoever abstains from work\nis honoured. A trade is fatal. In France, in old times, there was no\nexception to this rule, except in the case of glass manufacturers.\nEmptying bottles being then one of the glories of gentlemen, making them\nwas probably, for that reason, not considered dishonourable. In the\nChannel archipelago, as in Great Britain, he who would remain noble must\ncontrive to be rich. A working man cannot possibly be a gentleman. If he\nhas ever been one, he is so no longer. Yonder sailor, perhaps, descends\nfrom the Knights Bannerets, but is nothing but a sailor. Thirty years\nago, a real Gorges, who would have had rights over the Seigniory of\nGorges, confiscated by Philip Augustus, gathered seaweed, naked-footed,\nin the sea. A Carteret is a waggoner in Sark. There are at Jersey a\ndraper, and at Guernsey a shoemaker, named Gruchy, who claim to be\nGrouchys, and cousins of the Marshal of Waterloo. The old registers of\nthe Bishopric of Coutances make mention of a Seigniory of Tangroville,\nevidently from Tancarville on the lower Seine, which is identical with\nMontmorency. In the fifteenth century, Johan de H\u00c3\u00a9roudeville, archer and\n_\u00c3\u00a9toffe_ of the Sire de Tangroville, bore behind him \"_son corset et ses\nautres harnois_.\" In May, 1371, at Pontorson, at the review of Bertrand\ndu Guesclin, Monsieur de Tangroville rendered his homage as Knight\nBachelor. In the Norman islands, if a noble falls into poverty, he is\nsoon eliminated from the order. A mere change of pronunciation is\nenough. Tangroville becomes Tangrouille: and the thing is done.\n\nThis had been the fate of the helmsman of the Durande.\n\nAt the Bordag\u00c3\u00a9 of St. Peter's Port, there is a dealer in old iron named\nIngrouille, who is probably an Ingroville. Under Lewis le Gros the\nIngrovilles possessed three parishes in the district of Valognes. A\ncertain Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Trigan has written an Ecclesiastical History of Normandy.\nThis chronicler Trigan was the cur\u00c3\u00a9 of the Seigniory of Digoville. The\nSire of Digoville, if he had sunk to a lower grade, would have been\ncalled Digouille.\n\nTangrouille, this probable Tancarville, and possible Montmorency, had an\nancient noble quality, but a grave failing for a steersman; he got drunk\noccasionally.\n\nSieur Clubin had obstinately determined to retain him. He answered for\nhis conduct to Mess Lethierry.\n\nTangrouille the helmsman never left the vessel; he slept aboard.\n\nOn the eve of their departure, when Sieur Clubin came at a late hour to\ninspect the vessel, the steersman was in his hammock asleep.\n\nIn the night Tangrouille awoke. It was his nightly habit. Every drunkard\nwho is not his own master has his secret hiding-place. Tangrouille had\nhis, which he called his store. The secret store of Tangrouille was in\nthe hold. He had placed it there to put others off the scent. He thought\nit certain that his hiding-place was known only to himself. Captain\nClubin, being a sober man himself, was strict. The little rum or gin\nwhich the helmsman could conceal from the vigilant eyes of the captain,\nhe kept in reserve in this mysterious corner of the hold, and nearly\nevery night he had a stolen interview with the contents of this store.\nThe surveillance was rigorous, the orgie was a poor one, and\nTangrouille's nightly excesses were generally confined to two or three\nfurtive draughts. Sometimes it happened that the store was empty. This\nnight Tangrouille had found there an unexpected bottle of brandy. His\njoy was great; but his astonishment greater. From what cloud had it\nfallen? He could not remember when or how he had ever brought it into\nthe ship. He soon, however, consumed the whole of it; partly from\nmotives of prudence, and partly from a fear that the brandy might be\ndiscovered and seized. The bottle he threw overboard. In the morning,\nwhen he took the helm, Tangrouille exhibited a slight oscillation of the\nbody.\n\nHe steered, however, pretty nearly as usual.\n\nWith regard to Clubin, he had gone, as the reader knows, to sleep at the\nJean Auberge.\n\nClubin always wore, under his shirt, a leathern travelling belt, in\nwhich he kept a reserve of twenty guineas; he took this belt off only at\nnight. Inside the belt was his name \"Clubin,\" written by himself on the\nrough leather, with thick lithographer's ink, which is indelible.\n\nOn rising, just before his departure, he put into this girdle the iron\nbox containing the seventy-five thousand francs in bank-notes; then, as\nhe was accustomed to do, he buckled the belt round his body.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nCONVERSATIONS INTERRUPTED\n\n\nThe Durande started pleasantly. The passengers, as soon as their bags\nand portmanteaus were installed upon and under the benches, took that\ncustomary survey of the vessel which seems indispensable under the\ncircumstances. Two of the passengers--the tourist and the Parisian--had\nnever seen a steam-vessel before, and from the moment the paddles began\nto revolve, they stood admiring the foam. Then they looked with\nwonderment at the smoke. Then they examined one by one, and almost piece\nby piece upon the upper and lower deck, all those naval appliances such\nas rings, grapnels, hooks and bolts, which, with their nice precision\nand adaptation, form a kind of colossal _bijouterie_--a sort of iron\njewellery, fantastically gilded with rust by the weather. They walked\nround the little signal gun upon the upper deck. \"Chained up like a\nsporting dog,\" observed the tourist. \"And covered with a waterproof\ncoat to prevent its taking cold,\" added the Parisian. As they left the\nland further behind, they indulged in the customary observations upon\nthe view of St. Malo. One passenger laid down the axiom that the\napproach to a place by sea is always deceptive; and that at a league\nfrom the shore, for example, nothing could more resemble Ostend than\nDunkirk. He completed his series of remarks on Dunkirk by the\nobservation that one of its two floating lights painted red was called\n_Ruytingen_, and the other _Mardyck_.\n\nSt. Malo, meanwhile, grew smaller in the distance, and finally\ndisappeared from view.\n\nThe aspect of the sea was a vast calm. The furrow left in the water by\nthe vessel was a long double line edged with foam, and stretching\nstraight behind them as far as the eye could see.\n\nA straight line drawn from St. Malo in France to Exeter in England would\ntouch the island of Guernsey. The straight line at sea is not always the\none chosen. Steam-vessels, however, have, to a certain extent, a power\nof following the direct course denied to sailing ships.\n\nThe wind in co-operation with the sea is a combination of forces. A ship\nis a combination of appliances. Forces are machines of infinite power.\nMachines are forces of limited power. That struggle which we call\nnavigation is between these two organisations, the one inexhaustible,\nthe other intelligent.\n\nMind, directing the mechanism, forms the counterbalance to the infinite\npower of the opposing forces. But the opposing forces, too, have their\norganisation. The elements are conscious of where they go, and what they\nare about. No force is merely blind. It is the function of man to keep\nwatch upon these natural agents, and to discover their laws.\n\nWhile these laws are still in great part undiscovered, the struggle\ncontinues, and in this struggle navigation, by the help of steam, is a\nperpetual victory won by human skill every hour of the day, and upon\nevery point of the sea. The admirable feature in steam navigation is,\nthat it disciplines the very ship herself. It diminishes her obedience\nto the winds, and increases her docility to man.\n\nThe Durande had never worked better at sea than on that day. She made\nher way marvellously.\n\nTowards eleven o'clock, a fresh breeze blowing from the nor'-nor'-west,\nthe Durande was off the Minquiers, under little steam, keeping her head\nto the west, on the starboard tack, and close up to the wind. The\nweather was still fine and clear. The trawlers, however, were making for\nshore.\n\nBy little and little, as if each one was anxious to get into port, the\nsea became clear of the boats.\n\nIt could not be said that the Durande was keeping quite her usual\ncourse. The crew gave no thought to such matters. The confidence in the\ncaptain was absolute; yet, perhaps through the fault of the helmsman,\nthere was a slight deviation. The Durande appeared to be making rather\ntowards Jersey than Guernsey. A little after eleven the captain\nrectified the vessel's course, and put her head fair for Guernsey. It\nwas only a little time lost, but in short days time lost has its\ninconveniences. It was a February day, but the sun shone brightly.\n\nTangrouille, in his half-intoxicated state, had not a very sure arm, nor\na very firm footing. The result was, that the helmsman lurched pretty\noften, which also retarded progress.\n\nThe wind had almost entirely fallen.\n\nThe Guernsey passenger, who had a telescope in his hand, brought it to\nbear from time to time upon a little cloud of grey mist, lightly moved\nby the wind, in the extreme western horizon. It resembled a fleecy down\nsprinkled with dust.\n\nCaptain Clubin wore his ordinary austere, Puritan-like expression of\ncountenance. He appeared to redouble his attention.\n\nAll was peaceful and almost joyous on board the Durande. The passengers\nchatted. It is possible to judge of the state of the sea in a passage\nwith the eyes closed, by noting the _tremolo_ of the conversation about\nyou. The full freedom of mind among the passengers answers to the\nperfect tranquillity of the waters.\n\nIt is impossible, for example, that a conversation like the following\ncould take place otherwise than on a very calm sea.\n\n\"Observe that pretty green and red fly.\"\n\n\"It has lost itself out at sea, and is resting on the ship.\"\n\n\"Flies do not soon get tired.\"\n\n\"No doubt; they are light; the wind carries them.\"\n\n\"An ounce of flies was once weighed, and afterwards counted; and it was\nfound to comprise no less than six thousand two hundred and\nsixty-eight.\"\n\nThe Guernsey passenger with the telescope had approached the St. Malo\ncattle dealers; and their talk was something in this vein:\n\n\"The Aubrac bull has a round and thick buttock, short legs, and a\nyellowish hide. He is slow at work by reason of the shortness of his\nlegs.\"\n\n\"In that matter the Salers beats the Aubrac.\"\n\n\"I have seen, sir, two beautiful bulls in my life. The first has the\nlegs low, the breast thick, the rump full, the haunches large, a good\nlength of neck to the udder, withers of good height, the skin easy to\nstrip. The second had all the signs of good fattening, a thick-set back,\nneck and shoulders strong, coat white and brown, rump sinking.\"\n\n\"That's the Cotentin race.\"\n\n\"Yes; with a slight cross with the Angus or Suffolk bull.\"\n\n\"You may believe it if you please, sir, but I assure you in the south\nthey hold shows of donkeys.\"\n\n\"Shows of donkeys?\"\n\n\"Of donkeys, on my honour. And the ugliest are the most admired.\"\n\n\"Ha! it is the same as with the mule shows. The ugly ones are considered\nbest.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Take also the Poitevin mares; large belly, thick legs.\"\n\n\"The best mule known is a sort of barrel upon four posts.\"\n\n\"Beauty in beasts is a different thing from beauty in men.\"\n\n\"And particularly in women.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"As for me, I like a woman to be pretty.\"\n\n\"I am more particular about her being well dressed.\"\n\n\"Yes; neat, clean, and well set off.\"\n\n\"Looking just new. A pretty girl ought always to appear as if she had\njust been turned out by a jeweller.\"\n\n\"To return to my bulls; I saw these two sold at the market at Thouars.\"\n\n\"The market at Thouars; I know it very well. The Bonneaus of La\nRochelle, and the Babas corn merchants at Marans, I don't know whether\nyou have heard of them attending that market.\"\n\nThe tourist and the Parisian were conversing with the American of the\nBibles.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the tourist, \"I will tell you the tonnage of the civilised\nworld. France 716,000 tons; Germany 1,000,000; the United States,\n5,000,000; England, 5,500,000; add the small vessels. Total 12,904,000\ntons, carried in 145,000 vessels scattered over the waters of the\nglobe.\"\n\nThe American interrupted:\n\n\"It is the United States, sir, which have 5,500,000.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said the tourist. \"You are an American?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I agree again.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The American missionary was considering whether this\nwas a case for the offer of a Bible.\n\n\"Is it true, sir,\" asked the tourist, \"that you have a passion for\nnicknames in America, so complete, that you confer them upon all your\ncelebrated men, and that you call your famous Missouri banker, Thomas\nBenton, 'Old Lingot'?\"\n\n\"Yes; just as we call Zachary Taylor 'Old Zach.'\"\n\n\"And General Harrison, 'Old Tip;' am I right? and General Jackson, 'Old\nHickory?'\"\n\n\"Because Jackson is hard as hickory wood; and because Harrison beat the\nredskins at _Tippecanoe_.\"\n\n\"It is an odd fashion that of yours.\"\n\n\"It is our custom. We call Van Buren 'The Little Wizard;' Seward, who\nintroduced the small bank-notes, 'Little Billy;' and Douglas, the\ndemocrat senator from Illinois, who is four feet high and very eloquent,\n'The Little Giant.' You may go from Texas to the State of Maine without\nhearing the name of Mr. Cass. They say the 'Great Michiganer.' Nor the\nname of Clay; they say 'The miller's boy with the scar.' Clay is the son\nof a miller.\"\n\n\"I should prefer to say 'Clay' or 'Cass,'\" said the Parisian. \"It's\nshorter.\"\n\n\"Then you would be out of the fashion. We call Corwin, who is the\nSecretary of the Treasury, 'The Waggoner-boy;' Daniel Webster, 'Black\nDan.' As to Winfield Scott, as his first thought after beating the\nEnglish at Chippeway, was to sit down to dine, we call him 'Quick--a\nbasin of soup.'\"\n\nThe small white mist perceived in the distance had become larger. It\nfilled now a segment of fifteen degrees above the horizon. It was like a\ncloud loitering along the water for want of wind to stir it. The breeze\nhad almost entirely died away. The sea was glassy. Although it was not\nyet noon, the sun was becoming pale. It lighted but seemed to give no\nwarmth.\n\n\"I fancy,\" said the tourist, \"that we shall have a change of weather.\"\n\n\"Probably rain,\" said the Parisian.\n\n\"Or fog,\" said the American.\n\n\"In Italy,\" remarked the tourist, \"Molfetta is the place where there\nfalls the least rain; and Tolmezzo, where there falls the most.\"\n\nAt noon, according to the usage of the Channel Islands, the bell sounded\nfor dinner. Those dined who desired. Some passengers had brought with\nthem provisions, and were eating merrily on the after-deck. Clubin did\nnot eat.\n\nWhile this eating was going on, the conversations continued.\n\nThe Guernsey man, having probably a scent for Bibles, approached the\nAmerican. The latter said to him:\n\n\"You know this sea?\"\n\n\"Very well; I belong to this part.\"\n\n\"And I, too,\" said one of the St. Malo men.\n\nThe native of Guernsey followed with a bow and continued:\n\n\"We are fortunately well out at sea now; I should not have liked a fog\nwhen we were off the Minquiers.\"\n\nThe American said to the St. Malo man:\n\n\"Islanders are more at home on the sea than the folks of the coast.\"\n\n\"True; we coast people are only half dipped in salt water.\"\n\n\"What are the Minquiers?\" asked the American.\n\nThe St. Malo man replied:\n\n\"They are an ugly reef of rocks.\"\n\n\"There are also the Grelets,\" said the Guernsey man.\n\n\"Parblus!\" ejaculated the other.\n\n\"And the Chouas,\" added the Guernsey man.\n\nThe inhabitant of St. Malo laughed.\n\n\"As for that,\" said he, \"there are the Savages also.\"\n\n\"And the Monks,\" observed the Guernsey man.\n\n\"And the Duck,\" cried the St. Maloite.\n\n\"Sir,\" remarked the inhabitant of Guernsey, \"you have an answer for\neverything.\"\n\nThe tourist interposed with a question:\n\n\"Have we to pass all that legion of rocks?\"\n\n\"No; we have left it to the sou'-south-east. It is behind us.\"\n\nAnd the Guernsey passenger continued:\n\n\"Big and little rocks together, the Grelets have fifty-seven peaks.\"\n\n\"And the Minquiers forty-eight,\" said the other.\n\nThe dialogue was now confined to the St. Malo and the Guernsey\npassenger.\n\n\"It strikes me, Monsieur St. Malo, that there are three rocks which you\nhave not included.\"\n\n\"I mentioned all.\"\n\n\"From the Der\u00c3\u00a9e to the Ma\u00c3\u00aetre Ile.\"\n\n\"And Les Maisons?\"\n\n\"Yes; seven rocks in the midst of the Minquiers.\"\n\n\"I see you know the very stones.\"\n\n\"If I didn't know the stones, I should not be an inhabitant of St.\nMalo.\"\n\n\"It is amusing to hear French people's reasonings.\"\n\nThe St. Malo man bowed in his turn, and said:\n\n\"The Savages are three rocks.\"\n\n\"And the Monks two.\"\n\n\"And the Duck one.\"\n\n\"_The_ Duck; this is only one, of course.\"\n\n\"No: for _the_ Suarde consists of four rocks.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the Suarde?\" asked the inhabitant of Guernsey.\n\n\"We call the Suarde what you call the Chouas.\"\n\n\"It is a queer passage, that between the Chouas and the Duck.\"\n\n\"It is impassable except for the birds.\"\n\n\"And the fish.\"\n\n\"Scarcely: in bad weather they give themselves hard knocks against the\nwalls.\"\n\n\"There is sand near the Minquiers?\"\n\n\"Around the Maisons.\"\n\n\"There are eight rocks visible from Jersey.\"\n\n\"Visible from the strand of Azette; that's correct: but not eight; only\nseven.\"\n\n\"At low water you can walk about the Minquiers?\"\n\n\"No doubt; there would be sand above water.\"\n\n\"And what of the Dirouilles?\"\n\n\"The Dirouilles bear no resemblance to the Minquiers.\"\n\n\"They are very dangerous.\"\n\n\"They are near Granville.\"\n\n\"I see that you St. Malo people, like us, enjoy sailing in these seas.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the St. Malo man, \"with the difference that we say, 'We\nhave the habit,' you, 'We are fond.'\"\n\n\"You make good sailors.\"\n\n\"I am myself a cattle merchant.\"\n\n\"Who was that famous sailor born of St. Malo?\"\n\n\"Surcouf?\"\n\n\"Another?\"\n\n\"Duguay-Trouin.\"\n\nHere the Parisian commercial man chimed in:\n\n\"Duguay-Trouin? He was captured by the English. He was as agreeable as\nhe was brave. A young English lady fell in love with him. It was she who\nprocured him his liberty.\"\n\nAt this moment a voice like thunder was heard crying out:\n\n\"You are drunk, man!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nCAPTAIN CLUBIN DISPLAYS ALL HIS GREAT QUALITIES\n\n\nEverybody turned.\n\nIt was the captain calling to the helmsman.\n\nSieur Clubin's tone and manner evidenced that he was extremely angry, or\nthat he wished to appear so.\n\nA well-timed burst of anger sometimes removes responsibility, and\nsometimes shifts it on to other shoulders.\n\nThe captain, standing on the bridge between the two paddle-boxes, fixed\nhis eyes on the helmsman. He repeated, between his teeth, \"Drunkard.\"\nThe unlucky Tangrouille hung his head.\n\nThe fog had made progress. It filled by this time nearly one-half of the\nhorizon. It seemed to advance from every quarter at the same time. There\nis something in a fog of the nature of a drop of oil upon the water. It\nenlarged insensibly. The light wind moved it onward slowly and silently.\nBy little and little it took possession of the ocean. It was coming\nchiefly from the north-west, dead ahead: the ship had it before her\nprow, like a line of cliff moving vast and vague. It rose from the sea\nlike a wall. There was an exact point where the wide waters entered the\nfog, and were lost to sight.\n\nThis line of the commencement of the fog was still above half-a-league\ndistant. The interval was visibly growing less and less. The Durande\nmade way; the fog made way also. It was drawing nearer to the vessel,\nwhile the vessel was drawing nearer to it.\n\nClubin gave the order to put on more steam, and to hold off the coast.\n\nThus for some time they skirted the edge of the fog; but still it\nadvanced. The vessel, meanwhile, sailed in broad sunlight.\n\nTime was lost in these manoeuvres, which had little chance of success.\nNightfall comes quickly in February. The native of Guernsey was\nmeditating upon the subject of this fog. He said to the St. Malo men:\n\n\"It will be thick!\"\n\n\"An ugly sort of weather at sea,\" observed one of the St. Malo men.\n\nThe other added:\n\n\"A kind of thing which spoils a good passage.\"\n\nThe Guernsey passenger approached Clubin, and said:\n\n\"I'm afraid, Captain, that the fog will catch us.\"\n\nClubin replied:\n\n\"I wished to stay at St. Malo, but I was advised to go.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By some old sailors.\"\n\n\"You were certainly right to go,\" said the Guernsey man. \"Who knows\nwhether there will not be a tempest to-morrow? At this season you may\nwait and find it worse.\"\n\nA few moments later, the Durande entered the fog bank.\n\nThe effect was singular. Suddenly those who were on the after-deck could\nnot see those forward. A soft grey medium divided the ship in two.\n\nThen the entire vessel passed into the fog. The sun became like a dull\nred moon. Everybody suddenly shivered. The passengers put on their\novercoats, and the sailors their tarpaulins. The sea, almost without a\nripple, was the more menacing from its cold tranquillity. All was pale\nand wan. The black funnel and the heavy smoke struggled with the dewy\nmist which enshrouded the vessel.\n\nDropping to westward was now useless. The captain kept the vessel's head\nagain towards Guernsey, and gave orders to put on the steam.\n\nThe Guernsey passenger, hanging about the engine-room hatchway, heard\nthe negro Imbrancam talking to his engineer comrade. The passenger\nlistened. The negro said:\n\n\"This morning, in the sun, we were going half steam on; now, in the fog,\nwe put on steam.\"\n\nThe Guernsey man returned to Clubin.\n\n\"Captain Clubin, a look-out is useless; but have we not too much steam\non?\"\n\n\"What can I do, sir? We must make up for time lost through the fault of\nthat drunkard of a helmsman.\"\n\n\"True, Captain Clubin.\"\n\nAnd Clubin added:\n\n\"I am anxious to arrive. It is foggy enough by day: it would be rather\ntoo much at night.\"\n\nThe Guernsey man rejoined his St. Malo fellow-passengers, and remarked:\n\n\"We have an excellent captain.\"\n\nAt intervals, great waves of mist bore down heavily upon them, and\nblotted out the sun; which again issued out of them pale and sickly. The\nlittle that could be seen of the heavens resembled the long strips of\npainted sky, dirty and smeared with oil, among the old scenery of a\ntheatre.\n\nThe Durande passed close to a cutter which had cast anchor for safety.\nIt was the _Shealtiel_ of Guernsey. The master of the cutter remarked\nthe high speed of the steam-vessel. It struck him also, that she was not\nin her exact course. She seemed to him to bear to westward too much. The\napparition of this vessel under full steam in the fog surprised him.\n\nTowards two o'clock the weather had become so thick that the captain was\nobliged to leave the bridge, and plant himself near the steersman. The\nsun had vanished, and all was fog. A sort of ashy darkness surrounded\nthe ship. They were navigating in a pale shroud. They could see neither\nsky nor water.\n\nThere was not a breath of wind.\n\nThe can of turpentine suspended under the bridge, between the\npaddle-boxes, did not even oscillate.\n\nThe passengers had become silent.\n\nThe Parisian, however, hummed between his teeth the song of\nB\u00c3\u00a9ranger--\"_Un jour le bon Dieu s'\u00c3\u00a9veillant_.\"\n\nOne of the St. Malo passengers addressed him:\n\n\"You are from Paris, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. _Il mit la t\u00c3\u00aate \u00c3\u00a0 la fen\u00c3\u00aatre._\"\n\n\"What do they do in Paris?\"\n\n\"_Leur plan\u00c3\u00a8te a p\u00c3\u00a9ri, peut-\u00c3\u00aatre._--In Paris, sir, things are going on\nvery badly.\"\n\n\"Then it's the same ashore as at sea.\"\n\n\"It is true; we have an abominable fog here.\"\n\n\"One which might involve us in misfortunes.\"\n\nThe Parisian exclaimed:\n\n\"Yes; and why all these misfortunes in the world? Misfortunes! What are\nthey sent for, these misfortunes? What use do they serve? There was the\nfire at the Od\u00c3\u00a9on theatre, and immediately a number of families thrown\nout of employment. Is that just? I don't know what is your religion,\nsir, but I am puzzled by all this.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said the St. Malo man.\n\n\"Everything that happens here below,\" continued the Parisian, \"seems to\ngo wrong. It looks as if Providence, for some reason, no longer watched\nover the world.\"\n\nThe St. Malo man scratched the top of his head, like one making an\neffort to understand. The Parisian continued:\n\n\"Our guardian angel seems to be absent. There ought to be a decree\nagainst celestial absenteeism. He is at his country-house, and takes no\nnotice of us; so all gets in disorder. It is evident that this guardian\nis not in the government; he is taking holiday, leaving some vicar--some\nseminarist angel, some wretched creature with sparrows'-wings--to look\nafter affairs.\"\n\nCaptain Clubin, who had approached the speakers during this\nconversation, laid his hand upon the shoulder of the Parisian.\n\n\"Silence, sir,\" he said. \"Keep a watch upon your words. We are upon the\nsea.\"\n\nNo one spoke again aloud.\n\nAfter a pause of five minutes, the Guernsey man, who had heard all this,\nwhispered in the ear of the St. Malo passenger:\n\n\"A religious man, our captain.\"\n\nIt did not rain, but all felt their clothing wet. The crew took no heed\nof the way they were making; but there was increased sense of\nuneasiness. They seemed to have entered into a doleful region. The fog\nmakes a deep silence on the sea; it calms the waves, and stifles the\nwind. In the midst of this silence, the creaking of the Durande\ncommunicated a strange, indefinable feeling of melancholy and\ndisquietude.\n\nThey passed no more vessels. If afar off, in the direction of Guernsey\nor in that of St. Malo, any vessels were at sea outside the fog, the\nDurande, submerged in the dense cloud, must have been invisible to them;\nwhile her long trail of smoke attached to nothing, looked like a black\ncomet in the pale sky.\n\nSuddenly Clubin roared out:\n\n\"Hang-dog! you have played us an ugly trick. You will have done us some\ndamage before we are out of this. You deserve to be put in irons. Get\nyou gone, drunkard!\"\n\nAnd he seized the helm himself.\n\nThe steersman, humbled, shrunk away to take part in the duties forward.\n\nThe Guernsey man said:\n\n\"That will save us.\"\n\nThe vessel was still making way rapidly.\n\nTowards three o'clock, the lower part of the fog began to clear, and\nthey could see the sea again.\n\nA mist can only be dispersed by the sun or the wind. By the sun is well;\nby the wind is not so well. At three o'clock in the afternoon, in the\nmonth of February, the sun is always weak. A return of the wind at this\ncritical point in a voyage is not desirable. It is often the forerunner\nof a hurricane.\n\nIf there was any breeze, however, it was scarcely perceptible.\n\nClubin with his eye on the binnacle, holding the tiller and steering,\nmuttered to himself some words like the following, which reached the\nears of the passengers:\n\n\"No time to be lost; that drunken rascal has retarded us.\"\n\nHis visage, meanwhile, was absolutely without expression.\n\nThe sea was less calm under the mist. A few waves were distinguishable.\nLittle patches of light appeared on the surface of the water. These\nluminous patches attract the attention of the sailors. They indicate\nopenings made by the wind in the overhanging roof of fog. The cloud rose\na little, and then sunk heavier. Sometimes the density was perfect. The\nship was involved in a sort of foggy iceberg. At intervals this terrible\ncircle opened a little, like a pair of pincers; showed a glimpse of the\nhorizon, and then closed again.\n\nMeanwhile the Guernsey man, armed with his spyglass, was standing like a\nsentinel in the fore part of the vessel.\n\nAn opening appeared for a moment, and was blotted out again.\n\nThe Guernsey man returned alarmed.\n\n\"Captain Clubin!\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"We are steering right upon the Hanways.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" said Clubin, coldly.\n\nThe Guernsey man insisted.\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"I have just seen the rock in the horizon.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Out yonder.\"\n\n\"It is the open sea there. Impossible.\"\n\nAnd Clubin kept the vessel's head to the point indicated by the\npassenger.\n\nThe Guernsey man seized his spyglass again.\n\nA moment later he came running aft again.\n\n\"Captain!\"\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Tack about!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I am certain of having seen a very high rock just ahead. It is the\nGreat Hanway.\"\n\n\"You have seen nothing but a thicker bank of fog.\"\n\n\"It is the Great Hanway. Tack, in the name of Heaven!\"\n\nClubin gave the helm a turn.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nCLUBIN REACHES THE CROWNING-POINT OF GLORY\n\n\nA crash was heard. The ripping of a vessel's side upon a sunken reef in\nopen sea is the most dismal sound of which man can dream. The Durande's\ncourse was stopped short.\n\nSeveral passengers were knocked down with the shock and rolled upon the\ndeck.\n\nThe Guernsey man raised his hands to heaven:\n\n\"We are on the Hanways. I predicted it.\"\n\nA long cry went up from the ship.\n\n\"We are lost.\"\n\nThe voice of Clubin, dry and short, was heard above all.\n\n\"No one is lost! Silence!\"\n\nThe black form of Imbrancam, naked down to the waist, issued from the\nhatchway of the engine-room.\n\nThe negro said with self-possession:\n\n\"The water is gaining, Captain. The fires will soon be out.\"\n\nThe moment was terrible.\n\nThe shock was like that of a suicide. If the disaster had been wilfully\nsought, it could not have been more terrible. The Durande had rushed\nupon her fate as if she had attacked the rock itself. A point had\npierced her sides like a wedge. More than six feet square of planking\nhad gone; the stem was broken, the prow smashed, and the gaping hull\ndrank in the sea with a horrible gulping noise. It was an entrance for\nwreck and ruin. The rebound was so violent that it had shattered the\nrudder pendants; the rudder itself hung unhinged and flapping. The rock\nhad driven in her keel. Round about the vessel nothing was visible\nexcept a thick, compact fog, now become sombre. Night was gathering\nfast.\n\nThe Durande plunged forward. It was like the effort of a horse pierced\nthrough the entrails by the horns of a bull. All was over with her.\n\nTangrouille was sobered. Nobody is drunk in the moment of a shipwreck.\nHe came down to the quarter-deck, went up again, and said:\n\n\"Captain, the water is gaining rapidly in the hold. In ten minutes it\nwill be up to the scupper-holes.\"\n\nThe passengers ran about bewildered, wringing their hands, leaning over\nthe bulwarks, looking down in the engine-room, and making every other\nsort of useless movement in their terror. The tourist had fainted.\n\nClubin made a sign with his hand, and they were silent. He questioned\nImbrancam:\n\n\"How long will the engines work yet?\"\n\n\"Five or six minutes, sir.\"\n\nThen he interrogated the Guernsey passenger:\n\n\"I was at the helm. You saw the rock. On which bank of the Hanways are\nwe?\"\n\n\"On the Mauve. Just now, in the opening in the fog, I saw it clearly.\"\n\n\"If we're on the Mauve,\" remarked Clubin, \"we have the Great Hanway on\nthe port side, and the Little Hanway on the starboard bow; we are a mile\nfrom the shore.\"\n\nThe crew and passengers listened, fixing their eyes anxiously and\nattentively on the captain.\n\nLightening the ship would have been of no avail, and indeed would have\nbeen hardly possible. In order to throw the cargo overboard, they would\nhave had to open the ports and increase the chance of the water\nentering. To cast anchor would have been equally useless: they were\nstuck fast. Besides, with such a bottom for the anchor to drag, the\nchain would probably have fouled. The engines not being injured, and\nbeing workable while the fires were not extinguished, that is to say,\nfor a few minutes longer, they could have made an effort, by help of\nsteam and her paddles, to turn her astern off the rocks; but if they had\nsucceeded, they must have settled down immediately. The rock, indeed, in\nsome degree stopped the breach and prevented the entrance of the water.\nIt was at least an obstacle; while the hole once freed, it would have\nbeen impossible to stop the leak or to work the pumps. To snatch a\nponiard from a wound in the heart is instant death to the victim. To\nfree the vessel from the rock would have been simply to founder.\n\nThe cattle, on whom the water was gaining in the hold, were lowing\npiteously.\n\nClubin issued orders:\n\n\"Launch the long boat.\"\n\nImbrancam and Tangrouille rushed to execute the order. The boat was\neased from her fastenings. The rest of the crew looked on stupefied.\n\n\"All hands to assist,\" cried Clubin.\n\nThis time all obeyed.\n\nClubin, self-possessed, continued to issue his orders in that old sea\ndialect, which French sailors of the present day would scarcely\nunderstand.\n\n\"Haul in a rope--Get a cable if the capstan does not work--Stop\nheaving--Keep the blocks clear--Lower away there--- Bring her down stern\nand bows--Now then, all together, lads--Take care she don't lower stern\nfirst--There's too much strain on there--Hold the laniard of the stock\ntackle--Stand by there!\"\n\nThe long boat was launched.\n\nAt that instant the Durande's paddles stopped, and the smoke ceased--the\nfires were drowned.\n\nThe passengers slipped down the ladder, and dropped hurriedly into the\nlong boat. Imbrancam lifted the fainting tourist, carried him into the\nboat, and then boarded the vessel again.\n\nThe crew made a rush after the passengers--the cabin boy was knocked\ndown, and the others were trampling upon him.\n\nImbrancam barred their passage.\n\n\"Not a man before the lad,\" he said.\n\nHe kept off the sailors with his two black arms, picked up the boy, and\nhanded him down to the Guernsey man, who was standing upright in the\nboat.\n\nThe boy saved, Imbrancam made way for the others, and said:\n\n\"Pass on!\"\n\nMeanwhile Clubin had entered his cabin, and had made up a parcel\ncontaining the ship's papers and instruments. He took the compass from\nthe binnacle, handed the papers and instruments to Imbrancam, and the\ncompass to Tangrouille, and said to them:\n\n\"Get aboard the boat.\"\n\nThey obeyed. The crew had taken their places before them.\n\n\"Now,\" cried Clubin, \"push off.\"\n\nA cry arose from the long boat.\n\n\"What about yourself, Captain?\"\n\n\"I will remain here.\"\n\nShipwrecked people have little time to deliberate, and not much for\nindulging in tender feeling. Those who were in the long boat and in\ncomparative safety, however, felt an emotion which was not altogether\nselfish. All the voices shouted together:\n\n\"Come with us, Captain.\"\n\n\"No: I remain here.\"\n\nThe Guernsey man, who had some experience of the sea, replied:\n\n\"Listen to me, Captain. You are wrecked on the Hanways. Swimming, you\nwould have only a mile to cross to Pleinmont. In a boat you can only\nland at Rocquaine, which is two miles. There are breakers, and there is\nthe fog. Our boat will not get to Rocquaine in less than two hours. It\nwill be a dark night. The sea is rising--the wind getting fresh. A\nsquall is at hand. We are now ready to return and bring you off; but if\nbad weather comes on, that will be out of our power. You are lost if you\nstay there. Come with us.\"\n\nThe Parisian chimed in:\n\n\"The long boat is full--too full, it is true, and one more will\ncertainly be one too many; but we are thirteen--a bad number for the\nboat, and it is better to overload her with a man than to take an\nominous number. Come, Captain.\"\n\nTangrouille added:\n\n\"It was all my fault--not yours, Captain. It isn't fair for you to be\nleft behind.\"\n\n\"I have decided to remain here,\" said Clubin. \"The vessel must\ninevitably go to pieces in the tempest to-night. I won't leave her. When\nthe ship is lost, the captain is already dead. People shall not say I\ndidn't do my duty to the end. Tangrouille, I forgive you.\"\n\nThen, folding his arms, he cried:\n\n\"Obey orders! Let go the rope, and push off.\"\n\nThe long-boat swayed to and fro. Imbrancam had seized the tiller. All\nthe hands which were not rowing were raised towards the captain--every\nmouth cried, \"Cheers for Captain Clubin.\"\n\n\"An admirable fellow!\" said the American.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the Guernsey man, \"he is one of the worthiest seamen\nafloat.\"\n\nTangrouille shed tears.\n\n\"If I had had the courage,\" he said, \"I would have stayed with him.\"\n\nThe long-boat pushed away, and was lost in the fog.\n\nNothing more was visible.\n\nThe beat of the oars grew fainter, and died away.\n\nClubin remained alone.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE INTERIOR OF AN ABYSS SUDDENLY REVEALED\n\n\nWhen Clubin found himself upon this rock, in the midst of the fog and\nthe wide waters, far from all sound of human life, left for dead, alone\nwith the tide rising around him, and night settling down rapidly, he\nexperienced a feeling of profound satisfaction.\n\nHe had succeeded.\n\nHis dream was realised. The acceptance which he had drawn upon destiny\nat so long a date had fallen due at last.\n\nWith him, to be abandoned there was, in fact, to be saved.\n\nHe was on the Hanways, one mile from the shore; he had about him\nseventy-five thousand francs. Never was shipwreck more scientifically\naccomplished. Nothing had failed. It is true, everything had been\nforeseen. From his early years Clubin had had an idea to stake his\nreputation for honesty at life's gaming-table; to pass as a man of high\nhonour, and to make that reputation his fulcrum for other things; to\nbide his time, to watch his opportunity; not to grope about blindly, but\nto seize boldly; to venture on one great stroke, only one; and to end by\nsweeping off the stakes, leaving fools behind him to gape and wonder.\nWhat stupid rogues fail in twenty times, he meant to accomplish at the\nfirst blow; and while they terminated a career on the gallows, he\nintended to finish with a fortune. The meeting with Rantaine had been a\nnew light to him. He had immediately laid his plan--to compel Rantaine\nto disgorge; to frustrate his threatened revelations by disappearing; to\nmake the world believe him dead, the best of all modes of concealment;\nand for this purpose to wreck the Durande. The shipwreck was necessary\nto his designs. Lastly, he had the satisfaction of vanishing, leaving\nbehind him a great renown, the crowning point of his existence. As he\nstood meditating on these things amid the wreck, Clubin might have been\ntaken for some demon in a pleasant mood.\n\nHe had lived a lifetime for the sake of this one minute.\n\nHis whole exterior was expressive of the two words, \"At last.\" A\ndevilish tranquillity reigned in that sallow countenance.\n\nHis dull eye, the depth of which generally seemed to be impenetrable,\nbecame clear and terrible. The inward fire of his dark spirit was\nreflected there.\n\nMan's inner nature, like that external world about him, has its electric\nphenomena. An idea is like a meteor; at the moment of its coming, the\nconfused meditations which preceded it open a way, and a spark flashes\nforth. Bearing within oneself a power of evil, feeling an inward prey,\nbrings to some minds a pleasure which is like a sparkle of light. The\ntriumph of an evil purpose brightens up their visages. The success of\ncertain cunning combinations, the attainment of certain cherished\nobjects, the gratification of certain ferocious instincts, will manifest\nthemselves in sinister but luminous appearances in their eyes. It is\nlike a threatening dawn, a gleam of joy drawn out of the heart of a\nstorm. These flashes are generated in the conscience in its states of\ncloud and darkness.\n\nSome such signs were then exhibiting themselves in the pupils of those\neyes. They were like nothing else that can be seen shining either above\nor here below.\n\nAll Clubin's pent-up wickedness found full vent now.\n\nHe gazed into the vast surrounding darkness, and indulged in a low,\nirrepressible laugh, full of sinister significance.\n\nHe was rich at last! rich at last!\n\nThe unknown future of his life was at length unfolding; the problem was\nsolved.\n\nClubin had plenty of time before him. The sea was rising, and\nconsequently sustained the Durande, and even raised her at last a\nlittle. The vessel kept firmly in its place among the rocks; there was\nno danger of her foundering. Besides, he determined to give the\nlong-boat time to get clear off--to go to the bottom, perhaps. Clubin\nhoped it might.\n\nErect upon the deck of the shipwrecked vessel, he folded his arms,\napparently enjoying that forlorn situation in the dark night.\n\nHypocrisy had weighed upon this man for thirty years. He had been evil\nitself, yoked with probity for a mate. He detested virtue with the\nfeeling of one who has been trapped into a hateful match. He had always\nhad a wicked premeditation; from the time when he attained manhood he\nhad worn the cold and rigid armour of appearances. Underneath this was\nthe demon of self. He had lived like a bandit in the disguise of an\nhonest citizen. He had been the soft-spoken pirate; the bond-slave of\nhonesty. He had been confined in garments of innocence, as in oppressive\nmummy cloths; had worn those angel wings which the devils find so\nwearisome in their fallen state. He had been overloaded with public\nesteem. It is arduous passing for a shining light. To preserve a\nperpetual equilibrium amid these difficulties, to think evil, to speak\ngoodness--here had been indeed a labour. Such a life of contradictions\nhad been Clubin's fate. It had been his lot--not the less onerous\nbecause he had chosen it himself--to preserve a good exterior, to be\nalways presentable, to foam in secret, to smile while grinding his\nteeth. Virtue presented itself to his mind as something stifling. He had\nfelt, sometimes, as if he could have gnawed those finger-ends which he\nwas compelled to keep before his mouth.\n\nTo live a life which is a perpetual falsehood is to suffer unknown\ntortures. To be premeditating indefinitely a diabolical act, to have to\nassume austerity; to brood over secret infamy seasoned with outward good\nfame; to have continually to put the world off the scent; to present a\nperpetual illusion, and never to be one's self--is a burdensome task. To\nbe constrained to dip the brush in that dark stuff within, to produce\nwith it a portrait of candour; to fawn, to restrain and suppress one's\nself, to be ever on the _qui vive_; watching without ceasing to mask\nlatent crimes with a face of healthy innocence: to transform deformity\ninto beauty; to fashion wickedness into the shape of perfection; to\ntickle, as it were, with the point of a dagger, to put sugar with\npoison, to keep a bridle on every gesture and keep a watch over every\ntone, not even to have a countenance of one's own--what can be harder,\nwhat can be more torturing. The odiousness of hypocrisy is obscurely\nfelt by the hypocrite himself. Drinking perpetually of his own imposture\nis nauseating. The sweetness of tone which cunning gives to scoundrelism\nis repugnant to the scoundrel compelled to have it ever in the mouth;\nand there are moments of disgust when villainy seems on the point of\nvomiting its secret. To have to swallow that bitter saliva is horrible.\nAdd to this picture his profound pride. There are strange moments in the\nhistory of such a life, when hypocrisy worships itself. There is always\nan inordinate egotism in roguery. The worm has the same mode of gliding\nalong as the serpent, and the same manner of raising its head. The\ntreacherous villain is the despot curbed and restrained, and only able\nto attain his ends by resigning himself to play a secondary part. He is\nsummed-up littleness capable of enormities. The perfect hypocrite is a\nTitan dwarfed.\n\nClubin had a genuine faith that he had been ill-used. Why had not he the\nright to have been born rich? It was from no fault of his that it was\notherwise. Deprived as he had been of the higher enjoyments of life, why\nhad he been forced to labour--in other words, to cheat, to betray, to\ndestroy? Why had he been condemned to this torture of flattering,\ncringing, fawning; to be always labouring for men's respect and\nfriendship, and to wear night and day a face which was not his own? To\nbe compelled to dissimulate was in itself to submit to a hardship. Men\nhate those to whom they have to lie. But now the disguise was at an end.\nClubin had taken his revenge.\n\nOn whom? On all! On everything!\n\nLethierry had never done him any but good services; so much the greater\nhis spleen. He was revenged upon Lethierry.\n\nHe was revenged upon all those in whose presence he had felt constraint.\nIt was his turn to be free now. Whoever had thought well of him was his\nenemy. He had felt himself their captive long enough.\n\nNow he had broken through his prison walls. His escape was accomplished.\nThat which would be regarded as his death, would be, in fact, the\nbeginning of his life. He was about to begin the world again. The true\nClubin had stripped off the false. In one hour the spell was broken. He\nhad kicked Rantaine into space; overwhelmed Lethierry in ruin; human\njustice in night, and opinion in error. He had cast off all humanity;\nblotted out the whole world.\n\nThe name of God, that word of three letters, occupied his mind but\nlittle.\n\nHe had passed for a religious man. What was he now?\n\nThere are secret recesses in hypocrisy; or rather the hypocrite is\nhimself a secret recess.\n\nWhen Clubin found himself quite alone, that cavern in which his soul had\nso long lain hidden, was opened. He enjoyed a moment of delicious\nliberty. He revelled for that moment in the open air. He gave vent to\nhimself in one long breath.\n\nThe depth of evil within him revealed itself in his visage. He expanded,\nas it were, with diabolical joy. The features of Rantaine by the side\nof his at that moment would have shown like the innocent expression of a\nnew-born child.\n\nWhat a deliverance was this plucking off of the old mask. His conscience\nrejoiced in the sight of its own monstrous nakedness, as it stepped\nforth to take its hideous bath of wickedness. The long restraint of\nmen's respect seemed to have given him a peculiar relish for infamy. He\nexperienced a certain lascivious enjoyment of wickedness. In those\nfrightful moral abysses so rarely sounded, such natures find atrocious\ndelights--they are the obscenities of rascality. The long-endured\ninsipidity of the false reputation for virtue gave him a sort of\nappetite for shame. In this state of mind men disdain their fellows so\nmuch that they even long for the contempt which marks the ending of\ntheir unmerited homage. They feel a satisfaction in the freedom of\ndegradation, and cast an eye of envy at baseness, sitting at its ease,\nclothed in ignominy and shame. Eyes that are forced to droop modestly\nare familiar with these stealthy glances at sin. From Messalina to\nMarie-Alacoque the distance is not great. Remember the histories of La\nCadi\u00c3\u00a8re and the nun of Louviers. Clubin, too, had worn the veil.\nEffrontery had always been the object of his secret admiration. He\nenvied the painted courtesan, and the face of bronze of the professional\nruffian. He felt a pride in surpassing her in artifices, and a disgust\nfor the trick of passing for a saint. He had been the Tantalus of\ncynicism. And now, upon this rock, in the midst of this solitude, he\ncould be frank and open. A bold plunge into wickedness--what a\nvoluptuous sense of relief it brought with it. All the delights known to\nthe fallen angels are summed up in this; and Clubin felt them in that\nmoment. The long arrears of dissimulations were paid at last. Hypocrisy\nis an investment; the devil reimburses it. Clubin gave himself up to the\nintoxication of the idea, having no longer any eye upon him but that of\nHeaven. He whispered within himself, \"I am a scoundrel,\" and felt\nprofoundly satisfied.\n\nNever had human conscience experienced such a full tide of emotions.\n\nHe was glad to be entirely alone, and yet would not have been sorry to\nhave had some one there. He would have been pleased to have had a\nwitness of his fiendish joy; gratified to have had opportunity of saying\nto society, \"Thou fool.\"\n\nThe solitude, indeed, assured his triumph; but it made it less.\n\nHe was not himself to be spectator of his glory. Even to be in the\npillory has its satisfaction, for everybody can see your infamy.\n\nTo compel the crowd to stand and gape is, in fact, an exercise of power.\nA malefactor standing upon a platform in the market-place, with the\ncollar of iron around his neck, is master of all the glances which he\nconstrains the multitude to turn towards him. There is a pedestal on\nyonder scaffolding. To be there--the centre of universal observation--is\nnot this, too, a triumph? To direct the pupil of the public eye, is this\nnot another form of supremacy? For those who worship an ideal\nwickedness, opprobrium is glory. It is a height from whence they can\nlook down; a superiority at least of some kind; a pre-eminence in which\nthey can display themselves royally. A gallows standing high in the gaze\nof all the world is not without some analogy with a throne. To be\nexposed is, at least, to be seen and studied.\n\nHerein we have evidently the key to the wicked reigns of history. Nero\nburning Rome, Louis Quatorze treacherously seizing the Palatinate, the\nPrince Regent killing Napoleon slowly, Nicholas strangling Poland before\nthe eyes of the civilised world, may have felt something akin to\nClubin's joy. Universal execration derives a grandeur even from its\nvastness.\n\nTo be unmasked is a humiliation; but to unmask one's self is a triumph.\nThere is an intoxication in the position, an insolent satisfaction in\nits contempt for appearances, a flaunting insolence in the nakedness\nwith which it affronts the decencies of life.\n\nThese ideas in a hypocrite appear to be inconsistent, but in reality are\nnot. All infamy is logical. Honey is gall. A character like that of\nEscobar has some affinity with that of the Marquis de Sade. In proof, we\nhave L\u00c3\u00a9otade. A hypocrite, being a personification of vice complete,\nincludes in himself the two poles of perversity. Priest-like on one\nside, he resembles the courtesan on the other. The sex of his diabolical\nnature is double. It engenders and transforms itself. Would you see it\nin its pleasing shape? Look at it. Would you see it horrible? Turn it\nround.\n\nAll this multitude of ideas was floating confusedly in Clubin's mind. He\nanalysed them little, but he felt them much.\n\nA whirlwind of flakes of fire borne up from the pit of hell into the\ndark night, might fitly represent the wild succession of ideas in his\nsoul.\n\nClubin remained thus some time pensive and motionless. He looked down\nupon his cast-off virtues as a serpent on its old skin.\n\nEverybody had had faith in that virtue; even he himself a little.\n\nHe laughed again.\n\nSociety would imagine him dead, while he was rich. They would believe\nhim drowned, while he was saved. What a capital trick to have played off\non the stupidity of the world.\n\nRantaine, too, was included in that universal stupidity. Clubin thought\nof Rantaine with an unmeasured disdain: the disdain of the marten for\nthe tiger. The trick had failed with Rantaine; it had succeeded with\nhim.--Rantaine had slunk away abashed; Clubin disappeared in triumph. He\nhad substituted himself for Rantaine--stepped between him and his\nmistress, and carried off her favours.\n\nAs to the future, he had no well-settled plan. In the iron tobacco-box\nin his girdle he had the three bank-notes. The knowledge of that fact\nwas enough. He would change his name. There are plenty of countries\nwhere sixty thousand francs are equal to six hundred thousand. It would\nbe no bad solution to go to one of those corners of the world, and live\nthere honestly on the money disgorged by that scoundrel Rantaine. To\nspeculate, to embark in commerce, to increase his capital, to become\nreally a millionaire, that, too, would be no bad termination to his\ncareer.\n\nFor example. The great trade in coffee from Costa Rica was just\nbeginning to be developed. There were heaps of gold to be made. He would\nsee.\n\nIt was of little consequence. He had plenty of time to think of it. The\nhardest part of the enterprise was accomplished. Stripping Rantaine, and\ndisappearing with the wreck of the Durande, were the grand achievements.\nAll the rest was for him simple. No obstacle henceforth was likely to\nstop him. He had nothing more to fear. He could reach the shore with\ncertainty by swimming. He would land at Pleinmont in the darkness;\nascend the cliffs; go straight to the old haunted house; enter it easily\nby the help of the knotted cord, concealed beforehand in a crevice of\nthe rocks; would find in the house his travelling-bag containing\nprovisions and dry clothing. There he could await his opportunity. He\nhad information. A week would not pass without the Spanish smugglers,\nBlasquito probably, touching at Pleinmont. For a few guineas he would\nobtain a passage, not to Torbay--as he had said to Blasco, to confound\nconjecture, and put him off the scent--but to Bilbao or Passages.\nThence he could get to Vera Cruz or New Orleans. But the moment had come\nfor taking to the water. The long boat was far enough by this time. An\nhour's swimming was nothing for Clubin. The distance of a mile only\nseparated him from the land, as he was on the Hanways.\n\nAt this point in Clubin's meditations, a clear opening appeared in the\nfog bank, the formidable Douvres rocks stood before him.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAN UNEXPECTED DENOUEMENT\n\n\nClubin, haggard, stared straight ahead.\n\nIt was indeed those terrible and solitary rocks.\n\nIt was impossible to mistake their misshapen outlines. The two twin\nDouvres reared their forms aloft, hideously revealing the passage\nbetween them, like a snare, a cut-throat in ambush in the ocean.\n\nThey were quite close to him. The fog, like an artful accomplice, had\nhidden them until now.\n\nClubin had mistaken his course in the dense mist. Notwithstanding all\nhis pains, he had experienced the fate of two other great navigators,\nGonzalez who discovered Cape Blanco, and Fernandez, who discovered Cape\nVerd. The fog had bewildered him. It had seemed to him, in the\nconfidence of his seamanship, to favour admirably the execution of his\nproject; but it had its perils. In veering to westward he had lost his\nreckoning. The Guernsey man, who fancied that he recognised the Hanways,\nhad decided his fate, and determined him to give the final turn to the\ntiller. Clubin had never doubted that he had steered the vessel on the\nHanways.\n\nThe Durande, stove in by one of the sunken rocks of the group, was only\nseparated from the two Douvres by a few cables' lengths.\n\nAt two hundred fathoms further was a massive block of granite. Upon the\nsteep sides of this rock were some hollows and small projections, which\nmight help a man to climb. The square corners of those rude walls at\nright angles indicated the existence of a plateau on the summit.\n\nIt was the height known by the name of \"The Man.\"\n\n\"The Man Rock\" rose even higher still than the Douvres. Its platform\ncommanded a view over their two inaccessible peaks. This platform,\ncrumbling at its edges, had every kind of irregularity of shape. No\nplace more desolate or more dangerous could be imagined. The hardly\nperceptible waves of the open sea lapped gently against the square sides\nof that dark enormous mass; a sort of rest-place for the vast spectres\nof the sea and darkness.\n\nAll around was calm. Scarcely a breath of air or a ripple. The mind\nguessed darkly the hidden life and vastness of the depths beneath that\nquiet surface.\n\nClubin had often seen the Douvres from afar.\n\nHe satisfied himself that he was indeed there.\n\nHe could not doubt it.\n\nA sudden and hideous change of affairs. The Douvres instead of the\nHanways. Instead of one mile, five leagues of sea! The Douvres to the\nsolitary shipwrecked sailor is the visible and palpable presence of\ndeath, the extinction of all hope of reaching land.\n\nClubin shuddered. He had placed himself voluntarily in the jaws of\ndestruction. No other refuge was left to him than \"The Man Rock.\" It was\nprobable that a tempest would arise in the night, and that the\nlong-boat, overloaded as she was, would sink. No news of the shipwreck\nthen would come to land. It would not even be known that Clubin had been\nleft upon the Douvres. No prospect was now before him but death from\ncold and hunger. His seventy-five thousand francs would not purchase him\na mouthful of bread. All the scaffolding he had built up had brought him\nonly to this snare. He alone was the laborious architect of this\ncrowning catastrophe. No resource--no possible escape; his triumph\ntransformed into a fatal precipice. Instead of deliverance, a prison;\ninstead of the long prosperous future, agony. In the glance of an eye,\nin the moment which the lightning occupies in passing, all his\nconstruction had fallen into ruins. The paradise dreamed of by this\ndemon had changed to its true form of a sepulchre.\n\nMeanwhile there had sprung up a movement in the air. The wind was\nrising. The fog, shaken, driven in, and rent asunder, moved towards the\nhorizon in vast shapeless masses. As quickly as it had disappeared\nbefore, the sea became once more visible.\n\nThe cattle, more and more invaded by the waters, continued to bellow in\nthe hold.\n\nNight was approaching, probably bringing with it a storm.\n\nThe Durande, filling slowly with the rising tide, swung from right to\nleft, then from left to right, and began to turn upon the rock as upon a\npivot.\n\nThe moment could be foreseen when a wave must move her from her fixed\nposition, and probably roll her over on her beam-ends.\n\nIt was not even so dark as at the instant of her striking the rocks.\nThough the day was more advanced, it was possible to see more clearly.\nThe fog had carried away with it some part of the darkness. The west was\nwithout a cloud. Twilight brings a pale sky. Its vast reflection\nglimmered on the sea.\n\nThe Durande's bows were lower than her stern. Her stern was, in fact,\nalmost out of the water. Clubin mounted on the taffrail, and fixed his\neyes on the horizon.\n\nIt is the nature of hypocrisy to be sanguine. The hypocrite is one who\nwaits his opportunity. Hypocrisy is nothing, in fact, but a horrible\nhopefulness; the very foundation of its revolting falsehood is composed\nof that virtue transformed into a vice.\n\nStrange contradiction. There is a certain trustfulness in hypocrisy. The\nhypocrite confides in some power, unrevealed even to himself, which\npermits the course of evil.\n\nClubin looked far and wide over the ocean.\n\nThe position was desperate, but that evil spirit did not yet despair.\n\nHe knew that after the fog, vessels that had been lying-to or riding at\nanchor would resume their course; and he thought that perhaps one would\npass within the horizon.\n\nAnd, as he had anticipated, a sail appeared.\n\nShe was coming from the east and steering towards the west.\n\nAs it approached the cut of the vessel became visible. It had but one\nmast, and was schooner-rigged. Her bowsprit was almost horizontal. It\nwas a cutter.\n\nBefore a half-hour she must pass not very far from the Douvres.\n\nClubin said within himself, \"I am saved!\"\n\nIn a moment like this, a man thinks at first of nothing but his life.\n\nThe cutter was probably a strange craft. Might it not be one of the\nsmuggling vessels on its way to Pleinmont? It might even be Blasquito\nhimself. In that case, not only life, but fortune, would be saved; and\nthe accident of the Douvres, by hastening the conclusion, by dispensing\nwith the necessity for concealment in the haunted house, and by bringing\nthe adventure to a d\u00c3\u00a9nouement at sea, would be turned into a happy\nincident.\n\nAll his original confidence of success returned fanatically to his\nsombre mind.\n\nIt is remarkable how easily knaves are persuaded that they deserve to\nsucceed.\n\nThere was but one course to take.\n\nThe Durande, entangled among the rocks, necessarily mingled her outline\nwith them, and confounded herself with their irregular shapes, among\nwhich she formed only one more mass of lines. Thus become indistinct and\nlost, she would not suffice, in the little light which remained, to\nattract the attention of the crew of the vessel which was approaching.\n\nBut a human form standing up, black against the pale twilight of the\nsky, upon \"the Man Rock,\" and making signs of distress, would doubtless\nbe perceived, and the cutter would then send a boat to take the\nshipwrecked man aboard.\n\n\"The Man\" was only two hundred fathoms off. To reach it by swimming was\nsimple, to climb it easy.\n\nThere was not a minute to lose.\n\nThe bows of the Durande being low between the rocks, it was from the\nheight of the poop where Clubin stood that he had to jump into the sea.\nHe began by taking a sounding, and discovered that there was great depth\njust under the stern of the wrecked vessel. The microscopic shells of\nforaminifera which the adhesive matter on the lead-line brought up were\nintact, indicating the presence of very hollow caves under the rocks, in\nwhich the water was tranquil, however great the agitation of the\nsurface.\n\nHe undressed, leaving his clothing on the deck. He knew that he would be\nable to get clothing when aboard the cutter.\n\nHe retained nothing but his leather belt.\n\nAs soon as he was stripped he placed his hand upon this belt, buckled it\nmore securely, felt for the iron tobacco-box, took a rapid survey in the\ndirection which he would have to follow among the breakers and the waves\nto gain \"the Man Rock;\" then precipitating himself head first, he\nplunged into the sea.\n\nAs he dived from a height, he plunged heavily.\n\nHe sank deep in the water, touched the bottom, skirted for a moment the\nsubmarine rocks, then struck out to regain the surface.\n\nAt that moment he felt himself seized by one foot.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII\n\nTHE DANGER OF OPENING A BOOK AT RANDOM\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE PEARL AT THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICE\n\n\nA few moments after his short colloquy with Sieur Landoys, Gilliatt was\nat St. Sampson.\n\nHe was troubled, even anxious. What could it be that had happened.\n\nThere was a murmur in St. Sampson like that of a startled hive.\nEverybody was at his door. The women were talking loud. There were\npeople who seemed relating some occurrence and who were gesticulating. A\ngroup had gathered around them. The words could be heard, \"What a\nmisfortune!\" Some faces wore a smile.\n\nGilliatt interrogated no one. It was not in his nature to ask questions.\nHe was, moreover, too much moved to speak to strangers. He had no\nconfidence in rumours. He preferred to go direct to the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\nHis anxiety was so great that he was not even deterred from entering the\nhouse.\n\nThe door of the great lower room opening upon the Quay, moreover, stood\nquite open. There was a swarm of men and women on the threshold.\nEverybody was going in, and Gilliatt went with the rest.\n\nEntering he found Sieur Landoys standing near the doorposts.\n\n\"You have heard, no doubt, of this event?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I did not like to call it out to you on the road. It makes me like a\nbird of evil omen.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\"\n\n\"The Durande is lost.\"\n\nThere was a crowd in the great room.\n\nThe various groups spoke low, like people in a sick chamber.\n\nThe assemblage, which consisted of neighbours, the first comers,\ncurious to learn the news, huddled together near the door with a sort of\ntimidity, leaving clear the bottom of the room, where appeared\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette sitting and in tears. Mess Lethierry stood beside her.\n\nHis back was against the wall at the end of the room. His sailor's cap\ncame down over his eyebrows. A lock of grey hair hung upon his cheek. He\nsaid nothing. His arms were motionless; he seemed scarcely to breathe.\nHe had the look of something lifeless placed against the wall.\n\nIt was easy to see in his aspect a man whose life had been crushed\nwithin him. The Durande being gone, Lethierry had no longer any object\nin his existence. He had had a being on the sea; that being had suddenly\nfoundered. What could he do now? Rise every morning: go to sleep every\nnight. Never more to await the coming of the Durande; to see her get\nunder way, or steer again into the port. What was a remainder of\nexistence without object? To drink, to eat, and then?--He had crowned\nthe labours of his life by a masterpiece: won by his devotion a new step\nin civilisation. The step was lost; the masterpiece destroyed. To live a\nfew vacant years longer! where would be the good? Henceforth nothing was\nleft for him to do. At his age men do not begin life anew. Besides, he\nwas ruined. Poor old man!\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, sitting near him on a chair and weeping, held one of Mess\nLethierry's hands in hers. Her hands were joined: his hand was clenched\nfast. It was the sign of the shade of difference in their two sorrows.\nIn joined hands there is still some token of hope, in the clenched fist\nnone.\n\nMess Lethierry gave up his arm to her, and let her do with it what she\npleased. He was passive. Struck down by a thunderbolt, he had scarcely a\nspark of life left within him.\n\nThere is a degree of overwhelmment which abstracts the mind entirely\nfrom its fellowship with man. The forms which come and go within your\nroom become confused and indistinct. They pass by, even touch you, but\nnever really come near you. You are far away; inaccessible to them, as\nthey to you. The intensities of joy and despair differ in this. In\ndespair, we take cognisance of the world only as something dim and afar\noff: we are insensible to the things before our eyes; we lose the\nfeeling of our own existence. It is in vain, at such times, that we are\nflesh and blood; our consciousness of life is none the more real: we are\nbecome, even to ourselves, nothing but a dream.\n\nMess Lethierry's gaze indicated that he had reached this state of\nabsorption.\n\nThe various groups were whispering together. They exchanged information\nas far as they had gathered it. This was the substance of their news.\n\nThe Durande had been wrecked the day before in the fog on the Douvres,\nabout an hour before sunset. With the exception of the captain, who\nrefused to leave his vessel, the crew and passengers had all escaped in\nthe long-boat. A squall from the south-west springing up as the fog had\ncleared, had almost wrecked them a second time, and had carried them out\nto sea beyond Guernsey. In the night they had had the good fortune to\nmeet with the _Cashmere_, which had taken them aboard and landed them at\nSt. Peter's Port. The disaster was entirely the fault of the steersman\nTangrouille, who was in prison. Clubin had behaved nobly.\n\nThe pilots, who had mustered in great force, pronounced the words \"The\nDouvres\" with a peculiar emphasis. \"A dreary half-way house that,\" said\none.\n\nA compass and a bundle of registers and memorandum-books lay on the\ntable; they were doubtless the compass of the Durande and the ship's\npapers, handed by Clubin to Imbrancam and Tangrouille at the moment of\nthe departure of the long-boat. They were the evidences of the\nmagnificent self-abnegation of that man who had busied himself with\nsaving these documents even in the presence of death itself--a little\nincident full of moral grandeur; an instance of sublime\nself-forgetfulness never to be forgotten.\n\nThey were unanimous in their admiration of Clubin; unanimous also in\nbelieving him to be saved after all. The _Shealtiel_ cutter had arrived\nsome hours after the _Cashmere_. It was this vessel which had brought\nthe last items of intelligence. She had passed four-and-twenty hours in\nthe same waters as the Durande. She had lain-to in the fog, and tacked\nabout during the squall. The captain of the _Shealtiel_ was present\namong the company.\n\nThis captain had just finished his narrative to Lethierry as Gilliatt\nentered. The narrative was a true one. Towards the morning, the storm\nhaving abated, and the wind becoming manageable, the captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ had heard the lowing of oxen in the open sea. This rural\nsound in the midst of the waves had naturally startled him. He steered\nin that direction, and perceived the Durande among the Douvres. The sea\nhad sufficiently subsided for him to approach. He hailed the wreck; the\nbellowing of the cattle was the sole reply. The captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ was confident that there was no one aboard the Durande. The\nwreck still held together well, and notwithstanding the violence of the\nsquall, Clubin could have passed the night there. He was not the man to\nleave go his hold very easily. He was not there, however; and therefore\nhe must have been rescued. It was certain that several sloops and\nluggers, from Granville and St. Malo, must, after laying-to in the fog\non the previous evening, have passed pretty near the rocks. It was\nevident that one of these had taken Clubin aboard. It was to be\nremembered that the long-boat of the Durande was full when it left the\nunlucky vessel; that it was certain to encounter great risks; that\nanother man aboard would have overloaded her, and perhaps caused her to\nfounder; and that these circumstances had no doubt weighed with Clubin\nin coming to his determination to remain on the wreck. His duty,\nhowever, once fulfilled, and a vessel at hand, Clubin assuredly would\nnot have scrupled to avail himself of its aid. A hero is not necessarily\nan idiot. The idea of a suicide was absurd in connection with a man of\nClubin's irreproachable character. The culprit, too, was Tangrouille,\nnot Clubin. All this was conclusive. The captain of the _Shealtiel_ was\nevidently right, and everybody expected to see Clubin reappear very\nshortly. There was a project abroad to carry him through the town in\ntriumph.\n\nTwo things appeared certain from the narrative of the captain: Clubin\nwas saved, the Durande lost.\n\nAs regarded the Durande, there was nothing for it but to accept the\nfact; the catastrophe was irremediable. The captain of the _Shealtiel_\nhad witnessed the last moments of the wreck. The sharp rock on which the\nvessel had been, as it were, nailed, had held her fast during the night,\nand resisted the shock of the tempest as if reluctant to part with its\nprey; but in the morning, at the moment when the captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ had convinced himself that there was no one aboard to be\nsaved, and was about to wear off again, one of those seas which are like\nthe last angry blows of a tempest had struck her. The wave lifted her\nviolently from her place, and with the swiftness and directness of an\narrow from a bow had thrown her against the two Douvres rocks. \"An\ninfernal crash was heard,\" said the captain. The vessel, lifted by the\nwave to a certain height, had plunged between the two rocks up to her\nmidship frame. She had stuck fast again; but more firmly than on the\nsubmarine rocks. She must have remained there suspended, and exposed to\nevery wind and sea.\n\nThe Durande, according to the statements of the crew of the _Shealtiel_,\nwas already three parts broken up. She would evidently have foundered\nduring the night, if the rocks had not kept her up. The captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ had watched her a long time with his spyglass. He gave, with\nnaval precision, the details of her disaster. The starboard quarter\nbeaten in, the masts maimed, the sails blown from the bolt-ropes, the\nshrouds torn away, the cabin sky-lights smashed by the falling of one of\nthe booms, the dome of the cuddy-house beaten in, the chocks of the\nlong-boat struck away, the round-house overturned, the hinges of the\nrudder broken, the trusses wrenched away, the quarter-cloths demolished,\nthe bits gone, the cross-beam destroyed, the shear-rails knocked off,\nthe stern-post broken. As to the parts of the cargo made fast before the\nforemast, all destroyed, made a clean sweep of, gone to ten thousand\nshivers, with top ropes, iron pulleys, and chains. The Durande had\nbroken her back; the sea now must break her up piecemeal. In a few days\nthere would be nothing of her remaining.\n\nIt appeared that the engine was scarcely injured by all these ravages--a\nremarkable fact, and one which proved its excellence. The captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ thought he could affirm that the crank had received no\nserious injury. The vessel's masts had given way, but the funnel had\nresisted everything. Only the iron guards of the captain's gangway were\ntwisted; the paddle boxes had suffered, the frames were bruised, but the\npaddles had not a float missing. The machinery was intact. Such was the\nconviction of the captain of the _Shealtiel_. Imbrancam, the engineer,\nwho was among the crowd, had the same conviction. The negro, more\nintelligent than many of his white companions, was proud of his engines.\nHe lifted up his arms, opening the ten fingers of his black hands, and\nsaid to Lethierry, as he sat there silent, \"Master, the machinery is\nalive still!\"\n\nThe safety of Clubin seeming certain, and the hull of the Durande being\nalready sacrificed, the engines became the topic of conversation among\nthe crowd. They took an interest in it as in a living thing. They felt a\ndelight in praising its good qualities. \"That's what I call a well-built\nmachine,\" said a French sailor. \"Something like a good one,\" cried a\nGuernsey fisherman. \"She must have some good stuff in her,\" said the\ncaptain of the _Shealtiel_, \"to come out of that affair with only a few\nscratches.\"\n\nBy degrees the machinery of the Durande became the absorbing object of\ntheir thoughts. Opinions were warm for and against. It had its enemies\nand its friends. More than one who possessed a good old sailing cutter,\nand who hoped to get a share of the business of the Durande, was not\nsorry to find that the Douvres rock had disposed of the new invention.\nThe whispering became louder. The discussion grew noisy, though the\nhubbub was evidently a little restrained; and now and then there was a\nsimultaneous lowering of voices out of respect to Lethierry's death-like\nsilence.\n\nThe result of the colloquy, so obstinately maintained on all sides, was\nas follows:--\n\nThe engines were the vital part of the vessel. To rescue the Durande was\nimpossible; but the machinery might still be saved. These engines were\nunique. To construct others similar, the money was wanting; but to find\nthe artificer would have been still more difficult. It was remembered\nthat the constructor of the machinery was dead. It had cost forty\nthousand francs. No one would risk again such a sum upon such a chance:\nparticularly as it was now discovered that steamboats could be lost like\nother vessels. The accident of the Durande destroyed the prestige of all\nher previous success. Still, it was deplorable to think that at that\nvery moment this valuable mechanism was still entire and in good\ncondition, and that in five or six days it would probably go to pieces,\nlike the vessel herself. As long as this existed, it might almost be\nsaid that there was no shipwreck. The loss of the engines was alone\nirreparable. To save the machinery would be almost to repair the\ndisaster.\n\nSave the machinery! It was easy to talk of it; but who would undertake\nto do it? Was it possible, even? To scheme and to execute are two\ndifferent things; as different as to dream and to do. Now if ever a\ndream had appeared wild and impracticable, it was that of saving the\nengines then embedded between the Douvres. The idea of sending a ship\nand a crew to work upon those rocks was absurd. It could not be thought\nof. It was the season of heavy seas. In the first gale the chains of the\nanchors would be worn away and snapped upon the submarine peaks, and the\nvessel must be shattered on the rocks. That would be to send a second\nshipwreck to the relief of the first. On the miserable narrow height\nwhere the legend of the place described the shipwrecked sailor as\nhaving perished of hunger, there was scarcely room for one person. To\nsave the engines, therefore, it would be necessary for a man to go to\nthe Douvres, to be alone in that sea, alone in that desert, alone at\nfive leagues from the coast, alone in that region of terrors, alone for\nentire weeks, alone in the presence of dangers foreseen and\nunforeseen--without supplies in the face of hunger and nakedness,\nwithout succour in the time of distress, without token of human life\naround him save the bleached bones of the miserable being who had\nperished there in his misery, without companionship save that of death.\nAnd besides, how was it possible to extricate the machinery? It would\nrequire not only a sailor, but an engineer; and for what trials must he\nnot prepare. The man who would attempt such a task must be more than a\nhero. He must be a madman: for in certain enterprises, in which\nsuperhuman power appears necessary, there is a sort of madness which is\nmore potent than courage. And after all, would it not be a folly to\nimmolate oneself for a mass of rusted iron. No: it was certain that\nnobody would undertake to go to the Douvres on such an errand. The\nengine must be abandoned like the rest. The engineer for such a task\nwould assuredly not be forthcoming. Where, indeed, should they look for\nsuch a man?\n\nAll this, or similar observations, formed the substance of the confused\nconversations of the crowd.\n\nThe captain of the _Shealtiel_, who had been a pilot, summed up the\nviews of all by exclaiming aloud:--\n\n\"No; it is all over. The man does not exist who could go there and\nrescue the machinery of the Durande.\"\n\n\"If I don't go,\" said Imbrancam, \"it is because nobody could do it.\"\n\nThe captain of the _Shealtiel_ shook his left hand in the air with that\nsudden movement which expresses a conviction that a thing is impossible.\n\n\"If he existed--\" continued the captain.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette turned her head impulsively, and interrupted.\n\n\"I would marry him,\" she said, innocently.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\nA man made his way out of the crowd, and standing before her, pale and\nanxious, said:\n\n\"You would marry him, Miss D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette?\"\n\nIt was Gilliatt.\n\nAll eyes were turned towards him. Mess Lethierry had just before stood\nupright, and gazed about him. His eyes glittered with a strange light.\n\nHe took off his sailor's cap, and threw it on the ground: then looked\nsolemnly before him, and without seeing any of the persons present,\nsaid:\n\n\"D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette should be his. I pledge myself to it in God's name.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nMUCH ASTONISHMENT ON THE WESTERN COAST\n\n\nThe full moon rose at ten o'clock on the following night; but however\nfine the night, however favourable the wind and sea, no fisherman\nthought of going out that evening either from Hogue la Perre, or\nBourdeaux harbour, or Houmet Benet, or Platon, or Port Grat, or Vazon\nBay, or Perrelle Bay, or Pezeries, or the Tielles or Saints' Bay, or\nLittle Bo, or any other port or little harbour in Guernsey; and the\nreason was very simple. A cock had been heard to crow at noonday.\n\nWhen the cock is heard to crow at an extraordinary hour, fishing is\nsuspended.\n\nAt dusk on that evening, however, a fisherman returning to Omptolle, met\nwith a remarkable adventure. On the height above Houmet Paradis, beyond\nthe Two Brayes and the Two Grunes, stands to the left the beacon of the\nPlattes Toug\u00c3\u00a8res, representing a tub reversed; and to the right, the\nbeacon of St. Sampson, representing the face of a man. Between these\ntwo, the fisherman thought that he perceived for the first time a third\nbeacon. What could be the meaning of this beacon? When had it been\nerected on that point? What shoal did it indicate? The beacon responded\nimmediately to these interrogations. It moved, it was a mast. The\nastonishment of the fisherman did not diminish. A beacon would have been\nremarkable; a mast was still more so: it could not be a fishing-boat.\nWhen everybody else was returning, some boat was going out. Who could it\nbe? and what was he about?\n\nTen minutes later the vessel, moving slowly, came within a short\ndistance of the Omptolle fisherman. He did not recognise it. He heard\nthe sound of rowing: there were evidently only two oars. There was\nprobably, then, only one man aboard. The wind was northerly. The man,\ntherefore, was evidently paddling along in order to take the wind off\nPoint Fontenelle. There he would probably take to his sails. He\nintended then to double the Ancresse and Mount Crevel. What could that\nmean?\n\nThe vessel passed, the fisherman returned home. On that same night, at\ndifferent hours, and at different points, various persons scattered and\nisolated on the western coast of Guernsey, observed certain facts.\n\nAs the Omptolle fisherman was mooring his bark, a carter of seaweed\nabout half-a-mile off, whipping his horses along the lonely road from\nthe Cl\u00c3\u00b4tures near the Druid stones, and in the neighbourhood of the\nMartello Towers 6 and 7, saw far off at sea, in a part little\nfrequented, because it requires much knowledge of the waters, and in the\ndirection of North Rock and the Jablonneuse, a sail being hoisted. He\npaid little attention to the circumstance, not being a seaman, but a\ncarter of seaweed.\n\nHalf-an-hour had perhaps elapsed since the carter had perceived this\nvessel, when a plasterer returning from his work in the town, and\npassing round Pel\u00c3\u00a9e Pool, found himself suddenly opposite a vessel\nsailing boldly among the rocks of the Quenon, the Rousse de Mer, and the\nGripe de Rousse. The night was dark, but the sky was light over the sea,\nan effect common enough; and he could distinguish a great distance in\nevery direction. There was no sail visible except this vessel.\n\nA little lower, a gatherer of crayfish, preparing his fish wells on the\nbeach which separates Port Soif from the Port Enfer, was puzzled to make\nout the movements of a vessel between the Boue Corneille and the\nMoubrette. The man must have been a good pilot, and in great haste to\nreach some destination to risk his boat there.\n\nJust as eight o'clock was striking at the Catel, the tavern-keeper at\nCobo Bay observed with astonishment a sail out beyond the Boue du Jardin\nand the Grunettes, and very near the Susanne and the Western Grunes.\n\nNot far from Cobo Bay, upon the solitary point of the Houmet of Vason\nBay, two lovers were lingering, hesitating before they parted for the\nnight. The young woman addressed the young man with the words, \"I am not\ngoing because I don't care to stay with you: I've a great deal to do.\"\nTheir farewell kiss was interrupted by a good sized sailing boat which\npassed very near them, making for the direction of the Messellettes.\n\nMonsieur le Peyre des Norgiots, an inhabitant of Cotillon Pipet, was\nengaged about nine o'clock in the evening in examining a hole made by\nsome trespassers in the hedge of his property called La Jennerotte, and\nhis \"_friquet_ planted with trees.\" Even while ascertaining the amount\nof the damage, he could not help observing a fishing-boat audaciously\nmaking its way round the Crocq Point at that hour of night.\n\nOn the morrow of a tempest, when there is always some agitation upon the\nsea, that route was extremely unsafe. It was rash to choose it, at\nleast, unless the steersman knew all the channels by heart.\n\nAt half-past nine o'clock, at L'Equerrier, a trawler carrying home his\nnet stopped for a time to observe between Colombelle and the Soufleresse\nsomething which looked like a boat. The boat was in a dangerous\nposition. Sudden gusts of wind of a very dangerous kind are very common\nin that spot. The _Soufleresse_, or Blower, derives its name from the\nsudden gusts of wind which it seems to direct upon the vessels, which by\nrare chance find their way thither.\n\nAt the moment when the moon was rising, the tide being high and the sea\nbeing quiet, in the little strait of Li-Hou, the solitary keeper of the\nisland of Li-Hou was considerably startled. A long black object slowly\npassed between the moon and him. This dark form, high and narrow,\nresembled a winding-sheet spread out and moving. It glided along the\nline of the top of the wall formed by the ridges of rock. The keeper of\nLi-Hou fancied that he had beheld the Black Lady.\n\nThe White Lady inhabits the Tau de Pez d'Amont; the Grey Lady, the Tau\nde Pez d'Aval; the Red Lady, the Silleuse, to the north of the Marquis\nBank; and the Black Lady, the Grand Etacr\u00c3\u00a9, to the west of Li-Houmet. At\nnight, when the moon shines, these ladies stalk abroad, and sometimes\nmeet.\n\nThat dark form might undoubtedly be a sail. The long groups of rocks on\nwhich she appeared to be walking, might in fact be concealing the hull\nof a bark navigating behind them, and allowing only her sail to be seen.\nBut the keeper asked himself, what bark would dare, at that hour, to\nventure herself between Li-Hou and the P\u00c3\u00a9cheresses, and the Anguilli\u00c3\u00a8res\nand L\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9e Point? And what object could she have? It seemed to him much\nmore probable that it was the Black Lady.\n\nAs the moon was passing the clock-tower of St. Peter in the Wood, the\nserjeant at Castle Rocquaine, while in the act of raising the drawbridge\nof the castle, distinguished at the end of the bay beyond the Haute\nCan\u00c3\u00a9e, but nearer than the Sambule, a sailing-vessel which seemed to be\nsteadily dropping down from north to south.\n\nOn the southern coast of Guernsey behind Pleinmont, in the curve of a\nbay composed entirely of precipices and rocky walls rising peak-shaped\nfrom the sea, there is a singular landing-place, to which a French\ngentleman, a resident of the island since 1855, has given the name of\n\"The Port on the Fourth Floor,\" a name now generally adopted. This port,\nor landing-place, which was then called the Moie, is a rocky plateau\nhalf-formed by nature, half by art, raised about forty feet above the\nlevel of the waves, and communicating with the water by two large beams\nlaid parallel in the form of an inclined plane. The fishing-vessels are\nhoisted up there by chains and pulleys from the sea, and are let down\nagain in the same way along these beams, which are like two rails. For\nthe fishermen there is a ladder. The port was, at the time of our story,\nmuch frequented by the smugglers. Being difficult of access, it was well\nsuited to their purposes.\n\nTowards eleven o'clock, some smugglers--perhaps the same upon whose aid\nClubin had counted--stood with their bales of goods on the summit of\nthis platform of the Moie. A smuggler is necessarily a man on the look\nout, it is part of his business to watch. They were astonished to\nperceive a sail suddenly make its appearance beyond the dusky outline of\nCape Pleinmont. It was moonlight. The smugglers observed the sail\nnarrowly, suspecting that it might be some coast-guard cutter about to\nlie in ambush behind the Great Hanway. But the sail left the Hanways\nbehind, passed to the north-west of the Boue Blondel, and was lost in\nthe pale mists of the horizon out at sea.\n\n\"Where the devil can that boat be sailing?\" asked the smuggler.\n\nThat same evening, a little after sunset, some one had been heard\nknocking at the door of the old house of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue. It was a boy\nwearing brown clothes and yellow stockings, a fact that indicated that\nhe was a little parish clerk. An old fisherwoman prowling about the\nshore with a lantern in her hand, had called to the boy, and this\ndialogue ensued between the fisherwoman and the little clerk, before the\nentrance to the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue:--\n\n\"What d'ye want, lad?\"\n\n\"The man of this place.\"\n\n\"He's not there.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Will he be there to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Is he gone away?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I've come, good woman, from the new rector of the parish, the Reverend\nEbenezer Caudray, who desires to pay him a visit.\"\n\n\"I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"The rector sent me to ask if the man who lives at the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue\nwould be at home to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nA QUOTATION FROM THE BIBLE\n\n\nDuring the twenty-four hours which followed, Mess Lethierry slept not,\nate nothing, drank nothing. He kissed D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette on the forehead, asked\nafter Clubin, of whom there was as yet no news, signed a declaration\ncertifying that he had no intention of preferring a charge against\nanyone, and set Tangrouille at liberty.\n\nAll the morning of the next day he remained half supporting himself on\nthe table of the office of the Durande, neither standing nor sitting:\nanswering kindly when anyone spoke to him. Curiosity being satisfied,\nthe Brav\u00c3\u00a9es had become a solitude. There is a good deal of curiosity\ngenerally mingled with the haste of condolences. The door had closed\nagain, and left the old man again alone with D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. The strange\nlight that had shone in Lethierry's eyes was extinguished. The mournful\nlook which filled them after the first news of the disaster had\nreturned.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, anxious for his sake, had, on the advice of Grace and Douce,\nlaid silently beside him a pair of stockings, which he had been\nknitting, sailor fashion, when the bad news had arrived.\n\nHe smiled bitterly, and said:\n\n\"They must think me foolish.\"\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour's silence, he added:\n\n\"These things are well when you are happy.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette carried away the stockings, and took advantage of the\nopportunity to remove also the compass and the ship's papers which\nLethierry had been brooding over too long.\n\nIn the afternoon, a little before tea-time, the door opened and two\nstrangers entered, attired in black. One was old, the other young.\n\nThe young one has, perhaps, already been observed in the course of this\nstory.\n\nThe two men had each a grave air; but their gravity appeared different.\nThe old man possessed what might be called state gravity; the gravity of\nthe young man was in his nature. Habit engenders the one; thought the\nother.\n\nThey were, as their costume indicated, two clergymen, each belonging to\nthe Established Church.\n\nThe first fact in the appearance of the younger man which might have\nfirst struck the observer was, that his gravity, though conspicuous in\nthe expression of his features, and evidently springing from the mind,\nwas not indicated by his person. Gravity is not inconsistent with\npassion, which it exalts by purifying it; but the idea of gravity could\nwith difficulty be associated with an exterior remarkable above all for\npersonal beauty. Being in holy orders, he must have been at least\nfour-and-twenty, but he seemed scarcely more than eighteen. He possessed\nthose gifts at once in harmony with, and in opposition to, each other. A\nsoul which seemed created for exalted passion, and a body created for\nlove. He was fair, rosy-fresh, slim, and elegant in his severe attire,\nand he had the cheeks of a young girl, and delicate hands. His movements\nwere natural and lively, though subdued. Everything about him was\npleasing, elegant, almost voluptuous. The beauty of his expression\nserved to correct this excess of personal attraction. His open smile,\nwhich showed his teeth, regular and white as those of a child, had\nsomething in it pensive, even devotional. He had the gracefulness of a\npage, mingled with the dignity of a bishop.\n\nHis fair hair, so fair and golden as to be almost effeminate, clustered\nover his white forehead, which was high and well-formed. A slight double\nline between the eyebrows awakened associations with studious thought.\n\nThose who saw him felt themselves in the presence of one of those\nnatures, benevolent, innocent, and pure, whose progress is in inverse\nsense with that of vulgar minds; natures whom illusion renders wise, and\nwhom experience makes enthusiasts.\n\nHis older companion was no other than Doctor Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode. Doctor\nJaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode belonged to the High Church; a party whose system is a\nsort of popery without a pope. The Church of England was at that epoch\nlabouring with the tendencies which have since become strengthened and\ncondensed in the form of Puseyism. Doctor Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode belonged to\nthat shade of Anglicanism which is almost a variety of the Church of\nRome. He was haughty, precise, stiff, and commanding. His inner sight\nscarcely penetrated outwardly. He possessed the letter in the place of\nthe spirit. His manner was arrogant; his presence imposing. He had less\nthe appearance of a \"Reverend\" than of a _Monsignore_. His frock-coat\nwas cut somewhat in the fashion of a cassock. His true centre would have\nbeen Rome. He was a born Prelate of the Antechamber. He seemed to have\nbeen created expressly to fill a part in the Papal Court, to walk behind\nthe Pontifical litter, with all the Court of Rome in _abitto paonazzo_.\nThe accident of his English birth and his theological education,\ndirected more towards the Old than the New Testament, had deprived him\nof that destiny. All his splendours were comprised in his preferments as\nRector of St. Peter's Port, Dean of the Island of Guernsey, and\nSurrogate of the Bishop of Winchester. These were, undoubtedly, not\nwithout their glories. These glories did not prevent M. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode\nbeing, on the whole, a worthy man.\n\nAs a theologian he was esteemed by those who were able to judge of such\nmatters; he was almost an authority in the Court of Arches--that\nSorbonne of England.\n\nHe had the true air of erudition; a learned contraction of the eyes;\nbristling nostrils; teeth which showed themselves at all times; a thin\nupper lip and a thick lower one. He was the possessor of several learned\ndegrees, a valuable prebend, titled friends, the confidence of the\nbishop, and a Bible, which he carried always in his pocket.\n\nMess Lethierry was so completely absorbed that the entrance of the two\npriests produced no effect upon him, save a slight movement of the\neyebrows.\n\nM. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode advanced, bowed, alluded in a few sober and dignified\nwords to his recent promotion, and mentioned that he came according to\ncustom to introduce among the inhabitants, and to Mess Lethierry in\nparticular, his successor in the parish, the new Rector of St. Sampson,\nthe Rev. Ebenezer Caudray, henceforth the pastor of Mess Lethierry.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette rose.\n\nThe young clergyman, who was the Rev. Ebenezer, saluted her.\n\nMess Lethierry regarded Monsieur Ebenezer Caudray, and muttered, \"A bad\nsailor.\"\n\nGrace placed chairs. The two visitors seated themselves near the table.\n\nDoctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode commenced a discourse. It had reached his ears that a\nserious misfortune had befallen his host. The Durande had been lost. He\ncame as Lethierry's pastor to offer condolence and advice. This\nshipwreck was unfortunate, and yet not without compensations. Let us\nexamine our own hearts. Are we not puffed up with prosperity? The waters\nof felicity are dangerous. Troubles must be submitted to cheerfully. The\nways of Providence are mysterious. Mess Lethierry was ruined, perhaps.\nBut riches were a danger. You may have false friends; poverty will\ndisperse them, and leave you alone. The Durande was reported to have\nbrought a revenue of one thousand pounds sterling per annum. It was more\nthan enough for the wise. Let us fly from temptations; put not our faith\nin gold; bow the head to losses and neglect. Isolation is full of good\nfruits. It was in solitude that Ajah discovered the warm springs while\nleading the asses of his father Zibeon. Let us not rebel against the\ninscrutable decrees of Providence. The holy man Job, after his misery,\nhad put faith in riches. Who can say that the loss of the Durande may\nnot have its advantages even of a temporal kind. He, for instance,\nDoctor Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode had invested some money in an excellent\nenterprise, now in progress at Sheffield. If Mess Lethierry, with the\nwealth which might still remain to him, should choose to embark in the\nsame affair, he might transfer his capital to that town. It was an\nextensive manufactory of arms for the supply of the Czar, now engaged in\nrepressing insurrection in Poland. There was a good prospect of\nobtaining three hundred per cent. profit.\n\nThe word Czar appeared to awaken Lethierry. He interrupted Dr. H\u00c3\u00a9rode.\n\n\"I want nothing to do with the Czar.\"\n\nThe Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode replied:\n\n\"Mess Lethierry, princes are recognised by God. It is written, 'Render\nunto C\u00c3\u00a6sar the things which are C\u00c3\u00a6sar's.' The Czar is C\u00c3\u00a6sar.\"\n\nLethierry partly relapsed into his dream and muttered:\n\n\"C\u00c3\u00a6sar? who is C\u00c3\u00a6sar? I don't know.\"\n\nThe Rev. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode continued his exhortations. He did not press\nthe question of Sheffield.\n\nTo contemn a C\u00c3\u00a6sar was republicanism. He could understand a man being a\nrepublican. In that case he could turn his thoughts towards a republic.\nMess Lethierry might repair his fortune in the United States, even\nbetter than in England. If he desired to invest what remained to him at\ngreat profit, he had only to take shares in the great company for\ndeveloping the resources of Texas, which employed more than twenty\nthousand negroes.\n\n\"I want nothing to do with slavery,\" said Lethierry.\n\n\"Slavery,\" replied the Reverend H\u00c3\u00a9rode, \"is an institution recognised by\nScripture. It is written, 'If a man smite his slave, he shall not be\npunished, for he is his money.'\"\n\nGrace and Douce at the door of the room listened in a sort of ecstacy to\nthe words of the Reverend Doctor.\n\nThe doctor continued. He was, all things considered, as we have said, a\nworthy man; and whatever his differences, personal or connected with\ncaste, with Mess Lethierry, he had come very sincerely to offer him that\nspiritual and even temporal aid which he, Doctor Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode,\ndispensed.\n\nIf Mess Lethierry's fortune had been diminished to that point that he\nwas unable to take a beneficial part in any speculation, Russian or\nAmerican, why should he not obtain some government appointment suited to\nhim? There were many very respectable places open to him, and the\nreverend gentleman was ready to recommend him. The office of\nDeputy-Vicomte was just vacant. Mess Lethierry was popular and\nrespected, and the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode, Dean of Guernsey and\nSurrogate of the Bishop, would make an effort to obtain for Mess\nLethierry this post. The Deputy-Vicomte is an important officer. He is\npresent as the representative of His Majesty at the holding of the\nSessions, at the debates of the _Cohue_, and at executions of justice.\n\nLethierry fixed his eye upon Doctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode.\n\n\"I don't like hanging,\" he said.\n\nDoctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode, who, up to this point, had pronounced his words with the\nsame intonation, had now a fit of severity; his tone became slightly\nchanged.\n\n\"Mess Lethierry, the pain of death is of divine ordination. God has\nplaced the sword in the hands of governors. It is written, 'An eye for\nan eye, a tooth for a tooth.'\"\n\nThe Reverend Ebenezer imperceptibly drew his chair nearer to the\nReverend Doctor and said, so as to be heard only by him:\n\n\"What this man says, is dictated to him.\"\n\n\"By whom? By what?\" demanded the Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode, in the same\ntone.\n\nThe young man replied in a whisper, \"By his conscience.\"\n\nThe Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode felt in his pocket, drew out a thick little\nbound volume with clasps, and said aloud:\n\n\"Conscience is here.\"\n\nThe book was a Bible.\n\nThen Doctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode's tone became softer. \"His wish was to render a\nservice to Mess Lethierry, whom he respected much. As his pastor, it was\nhis right and duty to offer counsel. Mess Lethierry, however, was free.\"\n\nMess Lethierry, plunged once more in his overwhelming absorption, no\nlonger listened. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, seated near him, and thoughtful, also did\nnot raise her eyes, and by her silent presence somewhat increased the\nembarrassment of a conversation not very animated. A witness who says\nnothing is a species of indefinable weight. Doctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode, however, did\nnot appear to feel it.\n\nLethierry no longer replying, Doctor H\u00c3\u00a9rode expatiated freely. Counsel\nis from man; inspiration is from God. In the counsels of the priests\nthere is inspiration. It is good to accept, dangerous to refuse them.\nSochoh was seized by eleven devils for disdaining the exhortations of\nNathaniel. Tiburianus was struck with a leprosy for having driven from\nhis house the Apostle Andrew. Barjesus, a magician though he was, was\npunished with blindness for having mocked at the words of St. Paul.\nElxai and his sisters, Martha and Martena, are in eternal torments for\ndespising the warnings of Valentianus, who proved to them clearly that\ntheir Jesus Christ, thirty-eight leagues in height, was a demon.\nAholibamah, who is also called Judith, obeyed the Councils, Reuben and\nPeniel listened to the counsels from on high, as their names indeed\nindicate. Reuben signifies son of the vision; and Peniel, \"the face of\nGod.\":\n\nMess Lethierry struck the table with his fist.\n\n\"Parbleu!\" he cried; \"it was my fault.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked M. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode.\n\n\"I say that it is my fault.\"\n\n\"Your fault? Why?\"\n\n\"Because I allowed the Durande to return on Fridays.\"\n\nM. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode whispered in Caudray's ear:\n\n\"This man is superstitious.\"\n\nHe resumed, raising his voice, and in a didactic tone:\n\n\"Mess Lethierry, it is puerile to believe in Fridays. You ought not to\nput faith in fables. Friday is a day just like any other. It is very\noften a propitious day. Melendez founded the city of Saint Augustin on a\nFriday; it was on a Friday that Henry the Seventh gave his commission\nto John Cabot; the Pilgrims of the _Mayflower_ landed at Province Town\non a Friday. Washington was born on Friday, the 22nd of February 1732;\nChristopher Columbus discovered America on Friday, the 12th of October\n1492.\"\n\nHaving delivered himself of these remarks, he rose.\n\nCaudray, whom he had brought with him, rose also.\n\nGrace and Douce, perceiving that the two clergymen were about to take\ntheir leave, opened the folding-doors.\n\nMess Lethierry saw nothing; heard nothing.\n\nM. Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode said, apart to M. Caudray:\n\n\"He does not even salute us. This is not sorrow; it is vacancy. He must\nhave lost his reason.\"\n\nHe took his little Bible, however, from the table, and held it between\nhis hands outstretched, as one holds a bird in fear that it may fly\naway. This attitude awakened among the persons present a certain amount\nof attention. Grace and Douce leaned forward eagerly.\n\nHis voice assumed all the solemnity of which it was capable.\n\n\"Mess Lethierry,\" he began, \"let us not part without reading a page of\nthe Holy Book. It is from books that wise men derive consolation in the\ntroubles of life. The profane have their oracles; but believers have\ntheir ready resource in the Bible. The first book which comes to hand,\nopened by chance may afford counsel; but the Bible, opened at any page,\nyields a revelation. It is, above all, a boon to the afflicted. Yes,\nHoly Scripture is an unfailing balm for their wounds. In the presence of\naffliction, it is good to consult its sacred pages--to open even without\nchoosing the place, and to read with faith the passage which we find.\nWhat man does not choose is chosen by God. He knoweth best what suiteth\nus. His finger pointeth invisibly to that which we read. Whatever be the\npage, it will infallibly enlighten. Let us seek, then, no other light;\nbut hold fast to His. It is the word from on high. In the text which is\nevoked with confidence and reverence, often do we find a mysterious\nsignificance in our present troubles. Let us hearken, then, and obey.\nMess Lethierry, you are in affliction, but I hold here the book of\nconsolation. You are sick at heart, but I have here the book of\nspiritual health.\"\n\nThe Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode touched the spring of the clasp, and let\nhis finger slip between the leaves. Then he placed his hand a moment\nupon the open volume, collected his thoughts, and, raising his eyes\nimpressively, began to read in a loud voice.\n\nThe passage which he had lighted on was as follows:\n\n\"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide, and he\nlifted up his eyes and saw and beheld the camels were coming.\n\n\"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she lighted off\nthe camel.\n\n\"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the\nfield to meet us?\n\n\"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah,\nand she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after\nhis mother's death.\"\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette glanced at each other.\n\n\n\n\nPART II.--MALICIOUS GILLIATT\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROCK\n\nI\n\nTHE PLACE WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO REACH, AND DIFFICULT TO LEAVE\n\n\nThe bark which had been observed at so many points on the coast of\nGuernsey on the previous evening was, as the reader has guessed, the old\nDutch barge or sloop. Gilliatt had chosen the channel along the coast\namong the rocks. It was the most dangerous way, but it was the most\ndirect. To take the shortest route was his only thought. Shipwrecks will\nnot wait; the sea is a pressing creditor; an hour's delay may be\nirreparable. His anxiety was to go quickly to the rescue of the\nmachinery in danger.\n\nOne of his objects in leaving Guernsey was to avoid arousing attention.\nHe set out like one escaping from justice, and seemed anxious to hide\nfrom human eyes. He shunned the eastern coast, as if he did not care to\npass in sight of St. Sampson and St. Peter's Port, and glided silently\nalong the opposite coast, which is comparatively uninhabited. Among the\nbreakers, it was necessary to ply the oars; but Gilliatt managed them on\nscientific principles; taking the water quietly, and dropping it with\nexact regularity, he was able to move in the darkness with as little\nnoise and as rapidly as possible. So stealthy were his movements, that\nhe might have seemed to be bent upon some evil errand.\n\nIn truth, though embarking desperately in an enterprise which might well\nbe called impossible, and risking his life with nearly every chance\nagainst him, he feared nothing but the possibility of some rival in the\nwork which he had set before him.\n\nAs the day began to break, those unknown eyes which look down upon the\nworld from boundless space might have beheld, at one of the most\ndangerous and solitary spots at sea, two objects, the distance between\nwhich was gradually decreasing, as the one was approaching the other.\nOne, which was almost imperceptible in the wide movement of the waters,\nwas a sailing boat. In this was a man. It was the sloop. The other,\nblack, motionless, colossal, rose above the waves, a singular form. Two\ntall pillars issuing from the sea bore aloft a sort of cross-beam which\nwas like a bridge between them. This bridge, so singular in shape that\nit was impossible to imagine what it was from a distance, touched each\nof the two pillars. It resembled a vast portal. Of what use could such\nan erection be in that open plain, the sea, which stretched around it\nfar and wide? It might have been imagined to be a Titanic Cromlech,\nplanted there in mid-ocean by an imperious whim, and built up by hands\naccustomed to proportion their labours to the great deep. Its wild\noutline stood well-defined against the clear sky.\n\nThe morning light was growing stronger in the east; the whiteness in the\nhorizon deepened the shadow on the sea. In the opposite sky the moon was\nsinking.\n\nThe two perpendicular forms were the Douvres. The huge mass held fast\nbetween them, like an architrave between two pillars, was the wreck of\nthe Durande.\n\nThe rock, thus holding fast and exhibiting its prey, was terrible to\nbehold. Inanimate things look sometimes as if endowed with a dark and\nhostile spirit towards man. There was a menace in the attitude of the\nrocks. They seemed to be biding their time.\n\nNothing could be more suggestive of haughtiness and arrogance than their\nwhole appearance: the conquered vessel; the triumphant abyss. The two\nrocks, still streaming with the tempest of the day before, were like two\nwrestlers sweating from a recent struggle. The wind had sunk; the sea\nrippled gently; here and there the presence of breakers might be\ndetected in the graceful streaks of foam upon the surface of the waters.\nA sound came from the sea like the murmuring of bees. All around was\nlevel except the Douvres, rising straight, like two black columns. Up to\na certain height they were completely bearded with seaweed; above this\ntheir steep haunches glittered at points like polished armour. They\nseemed ready to commence the strife again. The beholder felt that they\nwere rooted deep in mountains whose summits were beneath the sea. Their\naspect was full of a sort of tragic power.\n\nOrdinarily the sea conceals her crimes. She delights in privacy. Her\nunfathomable deeps keep silence. She wraps herself in a mystery which\nrarely consents to give up its secrets. We know her savage nature, but\nwho can tell the extent of her dark deeds? She is at once open and\nsecret; she hides away carefully, and cares not to divulge her actions;\nwrecks a vessel, and, covering it with the waves, engulfs it deep, as if\nconscious of her guilt. Among her crimes is hypocrisy. She slays and\nsteals, conceals her booty, puts on an air of unconsciousness, and\nsmiles.\n\nHere, however, was nothing of the kind. The Douvres, lifting above the\nlevel of the waters the shattered hull of the Durande, had an air of\ntriumph. The imagination might have pictured them as two monstrous arms,\nreaching upwards from the gulf, and exhibiting to the tempest the\nlifeless body of the ship. Their aspect was like that of an assassin\nboasting of his evil deeds.\n\nThe solemnity of the hour contributed something to the impression of the\nscene. There is a mysterious grandeur in the dawn, as of the border-land\nbetween the region of consciousness and the world of our dreams. There\nis something spectral in that confused transition time. The immense form\nof the two Douvres, like a capital letter H, the Durande forming its\ncross stroke, appeared against the horizon in all their twilight\nmajesty.\n\nGilliatt was attired in his seaman's clothing: a Guernsey shirt, woollen\nstockings, thick shoes, a homespun jacket, trousers of thick stuff, with\npockets, and a cap upon his head of red worsted, of a kind then much in\nuse among sailors, and known in the last century as a _gal\u00c3\u00a9rienne_.\n\nHe recognised the rocks, and steered towards them.\n\nThe situation of the Durande was exactly the contrary of that of a\nvessel gone to the bottom: it was a vessel suspended in the air.\n\nNo problem more strange was ever presented to a salvor.\n\nIt was broad daylight when Gilliatt arrived in the waters about the\nrock.\n\nAs we have said, there was but little sea. The slight agitation of the\nwater was due almost entirely to its confinement among the rocks. Every\npassage, small or large, is subject to this chopping movement. The\ninside of a channel is always more or less white with foam. Gilliatt did\nnot approach the Douvres without caution.\n\nHe cast the sounding lead several times.\n\nHe had a cargo to disembark.\n\nAccustomed to long absences, he had at home a number of necessaries\nalways ready. He had brought a sack of biscuit, another of rye-meal, a\nbasket of salt fish and smoked beef, a large can of fresh water; a\nNorwegian chest painted with flowers, containing several coarse woollen\nshirts, his tarpaulin and his waterproof overalls, and a sheepskin which\nhe was accustomed to throw at night over his clothes. On leaving the B\u00c3\u00bb\nde la Rue he had put all these things hastily into the barge, with the\naddition of a large loaf. In his hurry he had brought no other tools but\nhis huge forge-hammer, his chopper and hatchet, and a knotted rope.\nFurnished with a grappling-iron and with a ladder of that sort, the\nsteepest rocks become accessible, and a good sailor will find it\npossible to scale the rudest escarpment. In the island of Sark the\nvisitor may see what the fishermen of the Havre Gosselin can accomplish\nwith a knotted cord.\n\nHis nets and lines and all his fishing apparatus were in the barge. He\nhad placed them there mechanically and by habit; for he intended, if his\nenterprise continued, to sojourn for some time in an archipelago of\nrocks and breakers, where fishing nets and tackle are of little use.\n\nAt the moment when Gilliatt was skirting the great rock the sea was\nretiring; a circumstance favourable to his purpose. The departing tide\nlaid bare, at the foot of the smaller Douvre, one or two table-rocks,\nhorizontal, or only slightly inclined, and bearing a fanciful\nresemblance to boards supported by crows. These table-rocks, sometimes\nnarrow, sometimes broad, standing at unequal distances along the side of\nthe great perpendicular column, were continued in the form of a thin\ncornice up to a spot just beneath the Durande, the hull of which stood\nswelling out between the two rocks. The wreck was held fast there as in\na vice.\n\nThis series of platforms was convenient for approaching and surveying\nthe position. It was convenient also for disembarking the contents of\nthe barge provisionally; but it was necessary to hasten, for it was only\nabove water for a few hours. With the rising tide the table-rocks would\nbe again beneath the foam.\n\nIt was before these table-rocks, some level, some slanting, that\nGilliatt pushed in and brought the barge to a stand. A thick mass of wet\nand slippery sea-wrack covered them, rendered more slippery here and\nthere by their inclined surfaces.\n\nGilliatt pulled off his shoes and sprang bare-footed on to the slimy\nweeds, and made fast the barge to a point of rock.\n\nThen he advanced as far as he could along the granite cornice, reached\nthe rock immediately beneath the wreck, looked up, and examined it.\n\nThe Durande had been caught suspended, and, as it were, fitted in\nbetween the two rocks, at about twenty feet above the water. It must\nhave been a heavy sea which had cast her there.\n\nSuch effects from furious seas have nothing surprising for those who are\nfamiliar with the ocean. To cite one example only:--On the 25th January\n1840, in the Gulf of Stora, a tempest struck with its expiring force a\nbrig, and casting it almost intact completely over the broken wreck of\nthe corvette _La Marne_, fixed it immovable, bowsprit first, in a gap\nbetween the cliffs.\n\nThe Douvres, however, held only a part of the Durande.\n\nThe vessel snatched from the waves had been, as it were, uprooted from\nthe waters by the hurricane. A whirlwind had wrenched it against the\ncounteracting force of the rolling waves, and the vessel thus caught in\ncontrary directions by the two claws of the tempest had snapped like a\nlath. The after-part with the engine and the paddles, lifted out of the\nfoam and driven by all the fury of the cyclone into the defile of the\nDouvres, had plunged in up to her midship beam, and remained there. The\nblow had been well directed. To drive it in this fashion between the two\nrocks, the storm had struck it as with an enormous hammer. The\nforecastle carried away and rolled down by the sea, had gone to\nfragments among the breakers.\n\nThe hold, broken in, had scattered out the bodies of the drowned cattle\nupon the sea.\n\nA large portion of the forward side and bulwarks still hung to the\nriders by the larboard paddle-box, and by some shattered braces easy to\nstrike off with the blow of a hatchet.\n\nHere and there, among beams, planks, rags of canvas, pieces of chains,\nand other remains of wreck were seen lying about among the rugged\nfragments of shattered rock.\n\nGilliatt surveyed the Durande attentively. The keel formed a roofing\nover his head.\n\nA serene sky stretched far and wide over the waters, scarcely wrinkled\nwith a passing breath. The sun rose gloriously in the midst of the vast\nazure circle.\n\nFrom time to time a drop of water was detached from the wreck and fell\ninto the sea.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nA CATALOGUE OF DISASTERS\n\n\nThe Douvres differed in shape as well as in height.\n\nUpon the Little Douvre, which was curved and pointed, long veins of\nreddish-coloured rock, of a comparatively soft kind, could be seen\nbranching out and dividing the interior of the granite. At the edges of\nthese red dykes were fractures, favourable to climbing. One of these\nfractures, situated a little above the wreck, had been so laboriously\nworn and scooped out by the splashing of the waves, that it had become a\nsort of niche, in which it would have been quite possible to place a\nstatue. The granite of the Little Douvre was rounded at the surface,\nand, to the feel at least, soft like touchstone; but this feeling\ndetracted nothing from its durability. The Little Douvre terminated in a\npoint like a horn. The Great Douvre, polished, smooth, glossy,\nperpendicular, and looking as if cut out by the builder's square, was in\none piece, and seemed made of black ivory. Not a hole, not a break in\nits smooth surface. The escarpment looked inhospitable. A convict could\nnot have used it for escape, nor a bird for a place for its nest. On the\nsummit there was a horizontal surface as upon \"The Man Rock;\" but the\nsummit of the Great Douvre was inaccessible.\n\nIt was possible to scale the Little Douvre, but not to remain on the\nsummit; it would have been possible to rest on the summit of the Great\nDouvre, but impossible to scale it.\n\nGilliatt, having rapidly surveyed the situation of affairs, returned to\nthe barge, landed its contents upon the largest of the horizontal\ncornice rocks, made of the whole compact mass a sort of bale, which he\nrolled up in tarpaulin, fitted a sling rope to it with a hoisting block,\npushed the package into a corner of the rocks where the waves could not\nreach it, and then clutching the Little Douvre with his hands, and\nholding on with his naked feet, he clambered from projection to\nprojection, and from niche to niche, until he found himself level with\nthe wrecked vessel high up in the air.\n\nHaving reached the height of the paddles, he sprang upon the poop.\n\nThe interior of the wreck presented a mournful aspect.\n\nTraces of a great struggle were everywhere visible. There were plainly\nto be seen the frightful ravages of the sea and wind. The action of the\ntempest resembles the violence of a band of pirates. Nothing is more\nlike the victim of a criminal outrage than a wrecked ship violated and\nstripped by those terrible accomplices, the storm-cloud, the thunder,\nthe rain, the squall, the waves, and the breakers.\n\nStanding upon the dismantled deck, it was natural to dream of the\npresence of something like a furious stamping of the spirits of the\nstorm. Everywhere around were the marks of their rage. The strange\ncontortions of certain portions of the ironwork bore testimony to the\nterrific force of the winds. The between-decks were like the cell of a\nlunatic, in which everything has been broken.\n\nNo wild beast can compare with the sea for mangling its prey. The waves\nare full of talons. The north wind bites, the billows devour, the waves\nare like hungry jaws. The ocean strikes like a lion with its heavy paw,\nseizing and dismembering at the same moment.\n\nThe ruin conspicuous in the Durande presented the peculiarity of being\ndetailed and minute. It was a sort of horrible stripping and plucking.\nMuch of it seemed done with design. The beholder was tempted to exclaim,\n\"What wanton mischief!\" The ripping of the planking was edged here and\nthere artistically. This peculiarity is common with the ravages of the\ncyclone. To chip and tear away is the caprice of the great devastator.\nIts ways are like those of the professional torturer. The disasters\nwhich it causes wear a look of ingenious punishments. One might fancy it\nactuated by the worst passions of man. It refines in cruelty like a\nsavage. While it is exterminating it dissects bone by bone. It torments\nits victim, avenges itself, and takes delight in its work. It even\nappears to descend to petty acts of malice.\n\nCyclones are rare in our latitudes, and are, for that reason, the more\ndangerous, being generally unexpected. A rock in the path of a heavy\nwind may become the pivot of a storm. It is probable that the squall had\nthus rotated upon the point of the Douvres, and had turned suddenly into\na waterspout on meeting the shock of the rocks, a fact which explained\nthe casting of the vessel so high among them. When the cyclone blows, a\nvessel is of no more weight in the wind than a stone in a sling.\n\nThe damage received by the Durande was like the wound of a man cut in\ntwain. It was a divided trunk from which issued a mass of _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ like\nthe entrails of a body. Various kinds of cordage hung floating and\ntrembling, chains swung chattering; the fibres and nerves of the vessel\nwere there naked and exposed. What was not smashed was disjointed.\n\nFragments of the sheeting resembled currycombs bristling with nails;\neverything bore the appearance of ruin; a handspike had become nothing\nbut a piece of iron; a sounding-lead, nothing but a lump of metal; a\ndead-eye had become a mere piece of wood; a halliard, an end of rope; a\nstrand of cord, a tangled skein; a bolt-rope, a thread in the hem of a\nsail. All around was the lamentable work of demolition. Nothing remained\nthat was not unhooked, unnailed, cracked, wasted, warped, pierced with\nholes, destroyed: nothing hung together in the dreadful mass, but all\nwas torn, dislocated, broken. There was that air of drift which\ncharacterises the scene of all struggles--from the mel\u00c3\u00a9es of men, which\nare called battles, to the mel\u00c3\u00a9es of the elements, to which we give the\nname of chaos. Everything was sinking and dropping away; a rolling mass\nof planks, panelling, ironwork, cables, and beams had been arrested just\nat the great fracture of the hull, whence the least additional shock\nmust have precipitated them into the sea. What remained of her powerful\nframe, once so triumphant, was cracked here and there, showing through\nlarge apertures the dismal gloom within.\n\nThe foam from below spat its flakes contemptuously upon this broken and\nforlorn outcast of the sea.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSOUND; BUT NOT SAFE\n\n\nGilliatt did not expect to find only a portion of the ship existing.\nNothing in the description, in other respects so precise, of the captain\nof the _Shealtiel_ had led him to anticipate this division of the vessel\nin the centre. It was probable that the \"diabolical crash\" heard by the\ncaptain of the _Shealtiel_ marked the moment when this destruction had\ntaken place under the blows of a tremendous sea. The captain had,\ndoubtless, worn ship just before this last heavy squall; and what he had\ntaken for a great sea was probably a waterspout. Later, when he drew\nnearer to observe the wreck, he had only been able to see the stern of\nthe vessel--the remainder, that is to say, the large opening where the\nfore-part had given way, having been concealed from him among the masses\nof rock.\n\nWith that exception, the information given by the captain of the\n_Shealtiel_ was strictly correct. The hull was useless, but the engine\nremained intact.\n\nSuch chances are common in the history of shipwreck. The logic of\ndisaster at sea is beyond the grasp of human science.\n\nThe masts having snapped short, had fallen over the side; the chimney\nwas not even bent. The great iron plating which supported the machinery\nhad kept it together, and in one piece. The planks of the paddle-boxes\nwere disjointed, like the leaves of wooden sunblinds; but through their\napertures the paddles themselves could be seen in good condition. A few\nof their floats only were missing.\n\nBesides the machinery, the great stern capstan had resisted the\ndestruction. Its chain was there, and, thanks to its firm fixture in a\nframe of joists, might still be of service, unless the strain of the\nvoyal should break away the planking. The flooring of the deck bent at\nalmost every point, and was tottering throughout.\n\nOn the other hand, the trunk of the hull, fixed between the Douvres,\nheld together, as we have already said, and it appeared strong.\n\nThere was something like derision in this preservation of the machinery;\nsomething which added to the irony of the misfortune. The sombre malice\nof the unseen powers of mischief displays itself sometimes in such\nbitter mockeries. The machinery was saved, but its preservation did not\nmake it any the less lost. The ocean seemed to have kept it only to\ndemolish it at leisure. It was like the playing of the cat with her\nprey.\n\nIts fate was to suffer there and to be dismembered day by day. It was to\nbe the plaything of the savage amusements of the sea. It was slowly to\ndwindle, and, as it were, to melt away. For what could be done? That\nthis vast block of mechanism and gear, at once massive and delicate,\ncondemned to fixity by its weight, delivered up in that solitude to the\ndestructive elements, exposed in the gripe of the rock to the action of\nthe wind and wave, could, under the frown of that implacable spot,\nescape from slow destruction, seemed a madness even to imagine.\n\nThe Durande was the captive of the Douvres.\n\nHow could she be extricated from that position?\n\nHow could she be delivered from her bondage?\n\nThe escape of a man is difficult; but what a problem was this--the\nescape of a vast and cumbrous machine.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nA PRELIMINARY SURVEY\n\n\nGilliatt was pressed on all sides by demands upon his labours. The most\npressing, however, was to find a safe mooring for the barge; then a\nshelter for himself.\n\nThe Durande having settled down more on the larboard than on the\nstarboard side, the right paddle-box was higher than the left.\n\nGilliatt ascended the paddle-box on the right. From that position,\nalthough the gut of rocks stretching in abrupt angles behind the Douvres\nhad several elbows, he was able to study the ground-plan of the group.\n\nThis survey was the preliminary step of his operations.\n\nThe Douvres, as we have already described them, were like two high\ngable-ends, forming the narrow entrance to a straggling alley of small\ncliffs with perpendicular faces. It is not rare to find in primitive\nsubmarine formations these singular kinds of passages, which seem cut\nout with a hatchet.\n\nThis defile was extremely tortuous, and was never without water even in\nthe low tides. A current, much agitated, traversed it at all times from\nend to end. The sharpness of its turnings was favourable or\nunfavourable, according to the nature of the prevailing wind; sometimes\nit broke the swell and caused it to fall; sometimes it exasperated it.\nThis latter effect was the most frequent. An obstacle arouses the anger\nof the sea, and pushes it to excesses. The foam is the exaggeration of\nthe waves.\n\nThe stormy winds in these narrow and tortuous passages between the rocks\nare subjected to a similar compression, and acquire the same malignant\ncharacter. The tempest frets in its sudden imprisonment. Its bulk is\nstill immense, but sharpened and contracted; and it strikes with the\nmassiveness of a huge club and the keenness of an arrow. It pierces even\nwhile it strikes down. It is a hurricane contracted, like the draught\nthrough the crevice of a door.\n\nThe two chains of rocks, leaving between them this kind of street in the\nsea, formed stages at a lower level than the Douvres, gradually\ndecreasing, until they sunk together at a certain distance beneath the\nwaves.\n\nThere was another such gullet of less height than the gullet of the\nDouvres, but narrower still, and which formed the eastern entrance of\nthe defile. It was evident that the double prolongation of the ridge of\nrocks continued the kind of street under the water as far as \"The Man\nRock,\" which stood like a square citadel at the extremity of the group.\n\nAt low water, indeed, which was the time at which Gilliatt was observing\nthem, the two rows of sunken rock showed their tips, some high and dry,\nand all visible and preserving their parallel without interruption.\n\n\"The Man\" formed the boundary, and buttressed on the eastern side the\nentire mass of the group, which was protected on the opposite side by\nthe two Douvres.\n\nThe whole, from a bird's-eye view, appeared like a winding chaplet of\nrocks, having the Douvres at one extremity and \"The Man\" at the other.\n\nThe Douvres, taken together, were merely two gigantic shafts of granite\nprotruding vertically and almost touching each other, and forming the\ncrest of one of the mountainous ranges lying beneath the ocean. Those\nimmense ridges are not only found rising out of the unfathomable deep.\nThe surf and the squall had broken them up and divided them like the\nteeth of a saw. Only the tip of the ridge was visible; this was the\ngroup of rocks. The remainder, which the waves concealed, must have been\nenormous. The passage in which the storm had planted the Durande was the\nway between these two colossal shafts.\n\nThis passage, zigzag in form as the forked lightning, was of about the\nsame width in all parts. The ocean had so fashioned it. Its eternal\ncommotion produces sometimes those singular regularities. There is a\nsort of geometry in the action of the sea.\n\nFrom one extremity to the other of the defile, the two parallel granite\nwalls confronted each other at a distance which the midship frame of the\nDurande measured exactly. Between the two Douvres, the widening of the\nLittle Douvre, curved and turned back as it was, had formed a space for\nthe paddles. In any other part they must have been shattered to\nfragments.\n\nThe high double fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of rock within the passage was hideous to the\nsight. When, in the exploration of the desert of water which we call the\nocean, we come upon the unknown world of the sea, all is uncouth and\nshapeless. So much as Gilliatt could see of the defile from the height\nof the wreck, was appalling. In the rocky gorges of the ocean we may\noften trace a strange permanent impersonation of shipwreck. The defile\nof the Douvres was one of these gorges, and its effect was exciting to\nthe imagination. The oxydes of the rock showed on the escarpment here\nand there in red places, like marks of clotted blood; it resembled the\nsplashes on the walls of an abattoir. Associations of the charnel-house\nhaunted the place. The rough marine stones, diversely tinted--here by\nthe decomposition of metallic amalgams mingling with the rock, there by\nthe mould of dampness, manifested in places by purple scales, hideous\ngreen blotches, and ruddy splashes, awakened ideas of murder and\nextermination. It was like the unwashed walls of a chamber which had\nbeen the scene of an assassination; or it might have been imagined that\nmen had been crushed to death there, leaving traces of their fate. The\npeaked rocks produced an indescribable impression of accumulated\nagonies. Certain spots appeared to be still dripping with the carnage;\nhere the wall was wet, and it looked impossible to touch it without\nleaving the fingers bloody. The blight of massacre seemed everywhere. At\nthe base of the double parallel escarpment, scattered along the water's\nedge, or just below the waves, or in the worn hollows of the rocks, were\nmonstrous rounded masses of shingle, some scarlet, others black or\npurple, which bore a strange resemblance to internal organs of the body;\nthey might have been taken for human lungs, or heart, or liver,\nscattered and putrefying in that dismal place. Giants might have been\ndisembowelled there. From top to bottom of the granite ran long red\nlines, which might have been compared to oozings from a funeral bier.\n\nSuch aspects are frequent in sea caverns.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nA WORD UPON THE SECRET CO-OPERATIONS OF THE ELEMENTS\n\n\nThose who, by the disastrous chances of sea-voyages, happen to be\ncondemned to a temporary habitation upon a rock in mid-ocean, find that\nthe form of their inhospitable refuge is by no means a matter of\nindifference. There is the pyramidal-shaped rock, a single peak rising\nfrom the water; there is the circle rock somewhat resembling a round of\ngreat stones; and there is the corridor-rock. The latter is the most\nalarming of all. It is not only the ceaseless agony of the waves\nbetween its walls, or the tumult of the imprisoned sea; there are also\ncertain obscure meteorological characteristics which appear to appertain\nto this parallelism of two marine rocks. The two straight sides seem a\nveritable electric battery.\n\nThe first result of the peculiar position of these corridor-rocks is an\naction upon the air and the water. The corridor-rock acts upon the waves\nand the wind mechanically by its form; galvanically, by the different\nmagnetic action rendered possible by its vertical height, its masses in\njuxtaposition and contrary to each other.\n\nThis form of rock attracts to itself all the forces scattered in the\nwinds, and exercises over the tempest a singular power of concentration.\n\nHence there is in the neighbourhood of these breakers a certain\naccentuation of storms.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that the wind is composite. The wind is\nbelieved to be simple; but it is by no means simple. Its power is not\nmerely dynamic, it is chemical also; but this is not all, it is\nmagnetic. Its effects are often inexplicable. The wind is as much\nelectrical as aerial. Certain winds coincide with the _aurores\nboreales_. The wind blowing from the bank of the Aiguilles rolls the\nwaves one hundred feet high; a fact observed with astonishment by\nDumont-d'Urville. The corvette, he says, \"knew not what to obey.\"\n\nIn the south seas the waters will sometimes become inflated like an\noutbreak of immense tumours; and at such times the ocean becomes so\nterrible that the savages fly to escape the sight of it. The blasts in\nthe north seas are different. They are mingled with sharp points of ice;\nand their gusts, unfit to breathe, will blow the sledges of the\nEsquimaux backwards in the snow. Other winds burn. The simoon of Africa\nis the typhoon of China and the samiel of India. Simoon, typhoon, and\nsamiel, are believed to be the names of demons. They descend from the\nheights of the mountains. A storm vitrified the volcano of Toluca. This\nhot wind, a whirlwind of inky colour, rushing upon red clouds, is\nalluded to in the Vedas: \"Behold the black god, who comes to steal the\nred cows.\" In all these facts we trace the presence of the electric\nmystery.\n\nThe wind indeed is full of it; so are the waves. The sea, too, is\ncomposite in its nature. Under its waves of water which we see, it has\nits waves of force which are invisible. Its constituents are\ninnumerable. Of all the elements the ocean is the most indivisible and\nthe most profound.\n\nEndeavour to conceive this chaos so enormous that it dwarfs all other\nthings to one level. It is the universal recipient, reservoir of germs\nof life, and mould of transformations. It amasses and then disperses, it\naccumulates and then sows, it devours and then creates. It receives all\nthe waste and refuse waters of the earth, and converts them into\ntreasure. It is solid in the iceberg, liquid in the wave, fluid in the\nestuary. Regarded as matter, it is a mass; regarded as a force, it is an\nabstraction. It equalises and unites all phenomena. It may be called the\ninfinite in combination. By force and disturbance, it arrives at\ntransparency. It dissolves all differences, and absorbs them into its\nown unity. Its elements are so numerous that it becomes identity. One of\nits drops is complete, and represents the whole. From the abundance of\nits tempests, it attains equilibrium. Plato beheld the mazy dances of\nthe spheres. Strange fact, though not the less real, the ocean, in the\nvast terrestrial journey round the sun, becomes, with its flux and\nreflux, the balance of the globe.\n\nIn a phenomenon of the sea, all other phenomena are resumed. The sea is\nblown out of a waterspout as from a syphon; the storm observes the\nprinciple of the pump; the lightning issues from the sea as from the\nair. Aboard ships dull shocks are sometimes felt, and an odour of\nsulphur issues from the receptacles of chain cables. The ocean boils.\n\"The devil has put the sea in his cauldron,\" said De Ruyter. In certain\ntempests, which characterise the equinoxes and the return to equilibrium\nof the prolific power of nature, vessels breasting the foam seem to give\nout a kind of fire, phosphoric lights chase each other along the\nrigging, so close sometimes to the sailors at their work that the latter\nstretch forth their hands and try to catch, as they fly, these birds of\nflame. After the great earthquake of Lisbon, a blast of hot air, as from\na furnace, drove before it towards the city a wave sixty feet high. The\noscillation of the ocean is closely related to the convulsions of the\nearth.\n\nThese immeasurable forces produce sometimes extraordinary inundations.\nAt the end of the year 1864, one of the Maldive Islands, at a hundred\nleagues from the Malabar coast, actually foundered in the sea. It sunk\nto the bottom like a shipwrecked vessel. The fishermen who sailed from\nit in the morning, found nothing when they returned at night; scarcely\ncould they distinguish their villages under the sea. On this occasion\nboats were the spectators of the wrecks of houses.\n\nIn Europe, where nature seems restrained by the presence of\ncivilisation, such events are rare and are thought impossible.\nNevertheless, Jersey and Guernsey originally formed part of Gaul, and at\nthe moment while we are writing these lines, an equinoctial gale has\ndemolished a great portion of the cliff of the Firth of Forth in\nScotland.\n\nNowhere do these terrific forces appear more formidably conjoined than\nin the surprising strait known as the Lyse-Fiord. The Lyse-Fiord is the\nmost terrible of all the gut rocks of the ocean. Their terrors are there\ncomplete. It is in the northern sea, near the inhospitable Gulf of\nStavanger, and in the 59th degree of latitude. The water is black and\nheavy, and subject to intermitting storms. In this sea, and in the midst\nof this solitude, rises a great sombre street--a street for no human\nfootsteps. None ever pass through there; no ship ever ventures in. It is\na corridor ten leagues in length, between two rocky walls of three\nthousand feet in height. Such is the passage which presents an entrance\nto the sea. The defile has its elbows and angles like all these streets\nof the sea--never straight, having been formed by the irregular action\nof the water. In the Lyse-Fiord, the sea is almost always tranquil; the\nsky above is serene; the place terrible. Where is the wind? Not on high.\nWhere is the thunder? Not in the heavens. The wind is under the sea; the\nlightnings within the rock. Now and then there is a convulsion of the\nwater. At certain moments, when there is perhaps not a cloud in the sky,\nnearly half way up the perpendicular rock, at a thousand or fifteen\nhundred feet above the water, and rather on the southern than on the\nnorthern side, the rock suddenly thunders, lightnings dart forth, and\nthen retire like those toys which lengthen out and spring back again in\nthe hands of children. They contract and enlarge; strike the opposite\ncliff, re-enter the rock, issue forth again, recommence their play,\nmultiply their heads and tips of flame, grow bristling with points,\nstrike wherever they can, recommence again, and then are extinguished\nwith a sinister abruptness. Flocks of birds fly wide in terror. Nothing\nis more mysterious than that artillery issuing out of the invisible. One\ncliff attacks the other, raining lightning blows from side to side.\nTheir war concerns not man. It signals the ancient enmity of two rocks\nin the impassable gulf.\n\nIn the Lyse-Fiord, the wind whirls like the water in an estuary; the\nrock performs the function of the clouds; and the thunder breaks forth\nlike volcanic fire. This strange defile is a voltaic pile; the plates of\nwhich are the double line of cliffs.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nA STABLE FOR THE HORSE\n\n\nGilliatt was sufficiently familiar with marine rocks to grapple in\nearnest with the Douvres. Before all, as we have just said, it was\nnecessary to find a safe shelter for the barge.\n\nThe double row of reefs, which stretched in a sinuous form behind the\nDouvres, connected itself here and there with other rocks, and suggested\nthe existence of blind passages and hollows opening out into the\nstraggling way, and joining again to the principal defile like branches\nto a trunk.\n\nThe lower part of these rocks was covered with kelp, the upper part with\nlichens. The uniform level of the seaweed marked the line of the water\nat the height of the tide, and the limit of the sea in calm weather. The\npoints which the water had not touched presented those silver and golden\nhues communicated to marine granite by the white and yellow lichen.\n\nA crust of conoidical shells covered the rock at certain points, the dry\nrot of the granite.\n\nAt other points in the retreating angles, where fine sand had\naccumulated, ribbed on its surface rather by the wind than by the waves,\nappeared tufts of blue thistles.\n\nIn the indentations, sheltered from the winds, could be traced the\nlittle perforations made by the sea-urchin. This shelly mass of\nprickles, which moves about a living ball, by rolling on its spines, and\nthe armour of which is composed of ten thousand pieces, artistically\nadjusted and welded together--the sea-urchin, which is popularly called,\nfor some unknown reason, \"Aristotle's lantern,\" wears away the granite\nwith his five teeth, and lodges himself in the hole. It is in such holes\nthat the samphire gatherers find them. They cut them in halves and eat\nthem raw, like an oyster. Some steep their bread in the soft flesh.\nHence its other name, \"Sea-egg.\"\n\nThe tips of the further reefs, left out of the water by the receding\ntide, extended close under the escarpment of \"The Man\" to a sort of\ncreek, enclosed nearly on all sides by rocky walls. Here was evidently a\npossible harbourage. It had the form of a horse-shoe, and opened only on\none side to the east wind, which is the least violent of all winds in\nthat sea labyrinth. The water was shut in there, and almost motionless.\nThe shelter seemed comparatively safe. Gilliatt, moreover, had not much\nchoice.\n\nIf he wished to take advantage of the low water, it was important to\nmake haste.\n\nThe weather continued to be fine and calm. The insolent sea was for a\nwhile in a gentle mood.\n\nGilliatt descended, put on his shoes again, unmoored the cable,\nre-embarked, and pushed out into the water. He used the oars, coasting\nthe side of the rock.\n\nHaving reached \"The Man Rock,\" he examined the entrance to the little\ncreek.\n\nA fixed, wavy line in the motionless sea, a sort of wrinkle,\nimperceptible to any eye but that of a sailor, marked the channel.\n\nGilliatt studied for a moment its lineament, almost indistinct under the\nwater; then he held off a little in order to veer at ease, and steer\nwell into channel; and suddenly with a stroke of the oars he entered the\nlittle bay.\n\nHe sounded.\n\nThe anchorage appeared to be excellent.\n\nThe sloop would be protected there against almost any of the\ncontingencies of the season.\n\nThe most formidable reefs have quiet nooks of this sort. The ports which\nare thus found among the breakers are like the hospitality of the fierce\nBedouin--friendly and sure.\n\nGilliatt placed the sloop as near as he could to \"The Man,\" but still\nfar enough to escape grazing the rock; and he cast his two anchors.\n\nThat done, he crossed his arms, and reflected on his position.\n\nThe sloop was sheltered. Here was one problem solved. But another\nremained. Where could he now shelter himself?\n\nHe had the choice of two places: the sloop itself, with its corner of\ncabin, which was scarcely habitable, and the summit of \"The Man Rock,\"\nwhich was not difficult to scale.\n\nFrom one or other of these refuges it was possible at low water, by\njumping from rock to rock, to gain the passage between the Douvres where\nthe Durande was fixed, almost without wetting the feet.\n\nBut low water lasts but a short while, and all the rest of the time he\nwould be cut off either from his shelter or from the wreck by more than\ntwo hundred fathoms. Swimming among breakers is difficult at all times;\nif there is the least commotion in the sea it is impossible.\n\nHe was driven to give up the idea of shelter in the sloop or on \"The\nMan.\"\n\nNo resting-place was possible among the neighbouring rocks.\n\nThe summits of the lower ones disappeared twice a day beneath the rising\ntide.\n\nThe summits of the higher ones were constantly swept by the flakes of\nfoam, and promised nothing but an inhospitable drenching.\n\nNo choice remained but the wreck itself.\n\nWas it possible to seek refuge there?\n\nGilliatt hoped it might be.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nA CHAMBER FOR THE VOYAGER\n\n\nHalf-an-hour afterwards, Gilliatt having returned to the wreck, climbed\nto the deck, went below, and descended into the hold, completing the\nsummary survey of his first visit.\n\nBy the help of the capstan he had raised to the deck of the Durande the\npackage which he had made of the lading of the sloop. The capstan had\nworked well. Bars for turning it were not wanting. Gilliatt had only to\ntake his choice among the heap of wreck.\n\nHe found among the fragments a chisel, dropped, no doubt, from the\ncarpenter's box, and which he added to his little stock of tools.\n\nBesides this--for in poverty of appliances so complete everything counts\nfor a little--he had his jack-knife in his pocket.\n\nGilliatt worked the whole day long on the wreck, clearing away,\npropping, arranging.\n\nAt nightfall he observed the following facts:\n\nThe entire wreck shook in the wind. The carcass trembled at every step\nhe took. There was nothing stable or strong except the portion of the\nhull jammed between the rocks which contained the engine. There the\nbeams were powerfully supported by the granite walls.\n\nFixing his home in the Durande would be imprudent. It would increase the\nweight; but far from adding to her burden, it was important to lighten\nit. To burden the wreck in any way was indeed the very contrary of what\nhe wanted.\n\nThe mass of ruin required, in fact, the most careful management. It was\nlike a sick man at the approach of dissolution. The wind would do\nsufficient to help it to its end.\n\nIt was, moreover, unfortunate enough to be compelled to work there. The\namount of disturbance which the wreck would have to withstand would\nnecessarily distress it, perhaps beyond its strength.\n\nBesides, if any accident should happen in the night while Gilliatt was\nsleeping, he must necessarily perish with the vessel. No assistance was\npossible; all would be over. In order to help the shattered vessel, it\nwas absolutely necessary to remain outside it.\n\nHow to be outside and yet near it, this was the problem.\n\nThe difficulty became more complicated as he considered it.\n\nWhere could he find a shelter under such conditions?\n\nGilliatt reflected.\n\nThere remained nothing but the two Douvres. They seemed hopeless enough.\n\nFrom below, it was possible to distinguish upon the upper plateau of the\nGreat Douvre a sort of protuberance.\n\nHigh rocks with flattened summits, like the Great Douvre and \"The Man,\"\nare a sort of decapitated peaks. They abound among the mountains and in\nthe ocean. Certain rocks, particularly those which are met with in the\nopen sea, bear marks like half-felled trees. They have the appearance of\nhaving received blows from a hatchet. They have been subjected, in fact,\nto the blows of the gale, that indefatigable pioneer of the sea.\n\nThere are other still more profound causes of marine convulsions. Hence\nthe innumerable bruises upon these primeval masses of granite. Some of\nthese sea giants have their heads struck off.\n\nSometimes these heads, from some inexplicable cause, do not fall, but\nremain shattered on the summit of the mutilated trunk. This singularity\nis by no means rare. The Devil's Rock, at Guernsey, and the Table, in\nthe Valley of Anweiler, illustrate some of the most surprising features\nof this strange geological enigma.\n\nSome such phenomena had probably fashioned the summit of the Great\nDouvre.\n\nIf the protuberance which could be observed on the plateau were not a\nnatural irregularity in the stone, it must necessarily be some remaining\nfragment of the shattered summit.\n\nPerhaps the fragment might contain some excavation--some hole into which\na man could creep for cover. Gilliatt asked for no more.\n\nBut how could he reach the plateau? How could he scale that\nperpendicular wall, hard and polished as a pebble, half covered with\nthe growth of glutinous conferv\u00c3\u00a6, and having the slippery look of a\nsoapy surface?\n\nThe ridge of the plateau was at least thirty feet above the deck of the\nDurande.\n\nGilliatt took out of his box of tools the knotted cord, hooked it to his\nbelt by the grapnel, and set to work to scale the Little Douvre. The\nascent became more difficult as he climbed. He had forgotten to take off\nhis shoes, a fact which increased the difficulty. With great labour and\nstraining, however, he reached the point. Safely arrived there, he\nraised himself and stood erect. There was scarcely room for his two\nfeet. To make it his lodging would be difficult. A Stylite might have\ncontented himself there; Gilliatt, more luxurious in his requirements,\nwanted something more commodious.\n\nThe Little Douvre, leaning towards the great one, looked from a distance\nas if it was saluting it, and the space between the Douvres, which was\nsome score of feet below, was only eight or ten at the highest points.\n\nFrom the spot to which he had climbed, Gilliatt saw more distinctly the\nrocky excrescence which partly covered the plateau of the Great Douvre.\n\nThis plateau rose three fathoms at least above his head.\n\nA precipice separated him from it. The curved escarpment of the Little\nDouvre sloped away out of sight beneath him.\n\nHe detached the knotted rope from his belt, took a rapid glance at the\ndimensions of the rock, and slung the grapnel up to the plateau.\n\nThe grapnel scratched the rock, and slipped. The knotted rope with the\nhooks at its end fell down beneath his feet, swinging against the side\nof the little Douvre.\n\nHe renewed the attempt; slung the rope further, aiming at the granite\nprotuberance, in which he could perceive crevices and scratches.\n\nThe cast was, this time, so neat and skilful, that the hooks caught.\n\nHe pulled from below. A portion of the rock broke away, and the knotted\nrope with its heavy iron came down once more, striking the escarpment\nbeneath his feet.\n\nHe slung the grapnel a third time.\n\nIt did not fall.\n\nHe put a strain upon the rope; it resisted. The grapnel was firmly\nanchored.\n\nThe hooks had caught in some fracture of the plateau which he could not\nsee.\n\nIt was necessary to trust his life to that unknown support.\n\nHe did not hesitate.\n\nThe matter was urgent. He was compelled to take the shortest route.\n\nMoreover, to descend again to the deck of the Durande, in order to\ndevise some other step, was impossible. A slip was probable, and a fall\nalmost certain. It was easier to climb than to descend.\n\nGilliatt's movements were decisive, as are those of all good sailors. He\nnever wasted force. He always proportioned his efforts to the work in\nhand. Hence the prodigies of strength which he executed with ordinary\nmuscles. His biceps were no more powerful than that of ordinary men; but\nhis heart was firmer. He added, in fact, to strength which is physical,\nenergy which belongs to the moral faculties.\n\nThe feat to be accomplished was appalling.\n\nIt was to cross the space between the two Douvres, hanging only by this\nslender line.\n\nOftentimes in the path of duty and devotedness, the figure of death\nrises before men to present these terrible questions:\n\nWilt thou do this? asks the shadow.\n\nGilliatt tested the cord again; the grappling-iron held firm.\n\nWrapping his left hand in his handkerchief, he grasped the knotted cord\nwith his right hand, which he covered with his left; then stretching out\none foot, and striking out sharply with the other against the rock, in\norder that the impetus might prevent the rope twisting, he precipitated\nhimself from the height of the Little Douvre on to the escarpment of the\ngreat one.\n\nThe shock was severe.\n\nThere was a rebound.\n\nHis clenched fists struck the rocks in their turn; the handkerchief had\nloosened, and they were scratched; they had indeed narrowly escaped\nbeing crushed.\n\nGilliatt remained hanging there a moment dizzy.\n\nHe was sufficiently master of himself not to let go his hold of the\ncord.\n\nA few moments passed in jerks and oscillations before he could catch the\ncord with his feet; but he succeeded at last.\n\nRecovering himself, and holding the cord at last between his naked feet\nas with two hands, he gazed into the depth below.\n\nHe had no anxiety about the length of the cord, which had many a time\nserved him for great heights. The cord, in fact, trailed upon the deck\nof the Durande.\n\nAssured of being able to descend again, he began to climb hand over\nhand, and still clinging with his feet.\n\nIn a few moments he had gained the summit.\n\nNever before had any creature without wings found a footing there. The\nplateau was covered in parts with the dung of birds. It was an irregular\ntrapezium, a mass struck off from the colossal granitic prism of the\nGreat Douvre. This block was hollowed in the centre like a basin--a work\nof the rain.\n\nGilliatt, in fact, had guessed correctly.\n\nAt the southern angle of the block, he found a mass of superimposed\nrocks, probably fragments of the fallen summit. These rocks, looking\nlike a heap of giant paving-stones, would have left room for a wild\nbeast, if one could have found its way there, to secrete himself between\nthem. They supported themselves confusedly one against the other,\nleaving interstices like a heap of ruins. They formed neither grottoes\nnor caves, but the pile was full of holes like a sponge. One of these\nholes was large enough to admit a man.\n\nThis recess had a flooring of moss and a few tufts of grass. Gilliatt\ncould fit himself in it as in a kind of sheath. The recess at its\nentrance was about two feet high. It contracted towards the bottom.\nStone coffins sometimes have this form. The mass of rocks behind lying\ntowards the south-west, the recess was sheltered from the showers, but\nwas open to the cold north wind.\n\nGilliatt was satisfied with the place.\n\nThe two chief problems were solved; the sloop had a harbour, and he had\nfound a shelter.\n\nThe chief merit of his cave was its accessibility from the wreck.\n\nThe grappling-iron of the knotted cord having fallen between two blocks,\nhad become firmly hooked, but Gilliatt rendered it more difficult to\ngive way by rolling a huge stone upon it.\n\nHe was now free to operate at leisure upon the Durande.\n\nHenceforth he was at home.\n\nThe Great Douvre was his dwelling; the Durande was his workshop.\n\nNothing was more simple for him than going to and fro, ascending and\ndescending.\n\nHe dropped down easily by the knotted cord on to the deck.\n\nThe day's work was a good one, the enterprise had begun well; he was\nsatisfied, and began to feel hungry.\n\nHe untied his basket of provisions, opened his knife, cut a slice of\nsmoked beef, took a bite out of his brown loaf, drank a draught from his\ncan of fresh water, and supped admirably.\n\nTo do well and eat well are two satisfactions. A full stomach resembles\nan easy conscience.\n\nThis supper was ended, and there was still before him a little more\ndaylight. He took advantage of it to begin the lightening of the\nwreck--an urgent necessity.\n\nHe had passed part of the day in gathering up the fragments. He put on\none side, in the strong compartment which contained the machine, all\nthat might become of use to him, such as wood, iron, cordage, and\ncanvas. What was useless he cast into the sea.\n\nThe cargo of the sloop hoisted on to the deck by the capstan, compact as\nhe had made it, was an encumbrance. Gilliatt surveyed the species of\nniche, at a height within his reach, in the side of the Little Douvre.\nThese natural closets, not shut in, it is true, are often seen in the\nrocks. It struck him that it was possible to trust some stores to this\ndep\u00c3\u00b4t, and he accordingly placed in the back of the recess his two boxes\ncontaining his tools and his clothing, and his two bags holding the\nrye-meal and the biscuit. In the front--a little too near the edge\nperhaps, but he had no other place--he rested his basket of provisions.\n\nHe had taken care to remove from the box of clothing his sheepskin, his\nloose coat with a hood, and his waterproof overalls.\n\nTo lessen the hold of the wind upon the knotted cord, he made the lower\nextremity fast to one of the riders of the Durande.\n\nThe Durande being much driven in, this rider was bent a good deal, and\nit held the end of the cord as firmly as a tight hand.\n\nThere was still the difficulty of the upper end of the cord. To control\nthe lower part was well, but at the summit of the escarpment at the spot\nwhere the knotted cord met the ridge of the plateau, there was reason to\nfear that it would be fretted and worn away by the sharp angle of the\nrock.\n\nGilliatt searched in the heap of rubbish in reserve, and took from it\nsome rags of sail-cloth, and from a bunch of old cables he pulled out\nsome strands of rope-yarn with which he filled his pockets.\n\nA sailor would have guessed that he intended to bind with these pieces\nof sail-cloth and ends of yarn the part of the knotted rope upon the\nedge of the rock, so as to preserve it from all friction--an operation\nwhich is called \"keckling.\"\n\nHaving provided himself with these things, he drew on his overalls over\nhis legs, put on his waterproof coat over his jacket, drew its hood over\nhis red cap, hung the sheepskin round his neck by the two legs, and\nclothed in this complete panoply, he grasped the cord, now firmly fixed\nto the side of the Great Douvre, and mounted to the assault of that\nsombre citadel in the sea.\n\nIn spite of his scratched hands, Gilliatt easily regained the summit.\n\nThe last pale tints of sunset were fading in the sky. It was night upon\nthe sea below. A little light still lingered upon the height of the\nDouvre.\n\nGilliatt took advantage of this remains of daylight to bind the knotted\nrope. He wound it round again and again at the part which passed over\nthe edge of the rock, with a bandage of several thicknesses of canvas\nstrongly tied at every turn. The whole resembled in some degree the\npadding which actresses place upon their knees, to prepare them for the\nagonies and supplications of the fifth act.\n\nThis binding completely accomplished, Gilliatt rose from his stooping\nposition.\n\nFor some moments, while he had been busied in his task, he had had a\nconfused sense of a singular fluttering in the air.\n\nIt resembled, in the silence of the evening, the noise which an immense\nbat might make with the beating of its wings.\n\nGilliatt raised his eyes.\n\nA great black circle was revolving over his head in the pale twilight\nsky.\n\nSuch circles are seen in pictures round the heads of saints. These,\nhowever, are golden on a dark ground, while the circle around Gilliatt\nwas dark upon a pale ground. The effect was strange. It spread round the\nGreat Douvre like the aureole of night.\n\nThe circle drew nearer, then retired; grew narrower, and then spread\nwide again.\n\nIt was an immense flight of gulls, seamews, and cormorants; a vast\nmultitude of affrighted sea birds.\n\nThe Great Douvre was probably their lodging, and they were coming to\nrest for the night. Gilliatt had taken a chamber in their home. It was\nevident that their unexpected fellow-lodger disturbed them.\n\nA man there was an object they had never beheld before.\n\nTheir wild flutter continued for some time.\n\nThey seemed to be waiting for the stranger to leave the place.\n\nGilliatt followed them dreamily with his eyes.\n\nThe flying multitude seemed at last to give up their design. The circle\nsuddenly took a spiral form, and the cloud of sea birds came down upon\n\"The Man Rock\" at the extremity of the group, where they seemed to be\nconferring and deliberating.\n\nGilliatt, after settling down in his alcove of granite, and covering a\nstone for a pillow for his head, could hear the birds for a long time\nchattering one after the other, or croaking, as if in turns.\n\nThen they were silent, and all were sleeping--the birds upon their rock,\nGilliatt upon his.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIMPORTUN\u00c3\u0086QUE VOLUCRES\n\n\nGilliatt slept well; but he was cold, and this awoke him from time to\ntime. He had naturally placed his feet at the bottom, and his head at\nthe entrance to his cave. He had not taken the precaution to remove from\nhis couch a number of angular stones, which did not by any means conduce\nto sleep.\n\nNow and then he half-opened his eyes.\n\nAt intervals he heard loud noises. It was the rising tide entering the\ncaverns of the rocks with a sound like the report of a cannon.\n\nAll the circumstances of his position conspired to produce the effect of\na vision. Hallucinations seemed to surround him. The vagueness of night\nincreased this effect; and Gilliatt felt himself plunged into some\nregion of unrealities. He asked himself if all were not a dream?\n\nThen he dropped to sleep again; and this time, in a veritable dream,\nfound himself at the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue, at the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, at St. Sampson. He\nheard D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette singing; he was among realities. While he slept he\nseemed to wake and live; when he awoke again he appeared to be sleeping.\n\nIn truth, from this time forward he lived in a dream.\n\nTowards the middle of the night a confused murmur filled the air.\nGilliatt had a vague consciousness of it even in his sleep. It was\nperhaps a breeze arising.\n\nOnce, when awakened by a cold shiver, he opened his eyes a little wider\nthan before. Clouds were moving in the zenith; the moon was flying\nthrough the sky, with one large star following closely in her footsteps.\n\nGilliatt's mind was full of the incidents of his dreams. The wild\noutlines of things in the darkness were exaggerated by this confusion\nwith the impressions of his sleeping hours.\n\nAt daybreak he was half-frozen; but he slept soundly.\n\nThe sudden daylight aroused him from a slumber which might have been\ndangerous. The alcove faced the rising sun.\n\nGilliatt yawned, stretched himself, and sprang out of his sleeping\nplace.\n\nHis sleep had been so deep that he could not at first recall the\ncircumstances of the night before.\n\nBy degrees the feeling of reality returned, and he began to think of\nbreakfast.\n\nThe weather was calm; the sky cool and serene. The clouds were gone; the\nnight wind had cleared the horizon, and the sun rose brightly. Another\nfine day was commencing. Gilliatt felt joyful.\n\nHe threw off his overcoat and his leggings; rolled them up in the\nsheepskin with the wool inside, fastened the roll with a length of\nrope-yarn, and pushed it into the cavern for a shelter in case of rain.\n\nThis done, he made his bed--an operation which consisted in removing the\nstones which had annoyed him in the night.\n\nHis bed made, he slid down the cord on to the deck of the Durande, and\napproached the niche where he had placed his basket of provisions. As it\nwas very near the edge, the wind in the night had swept it down, and\nrolled it into the sea.\n\nIt was evident that it would not be easy to recover it. There was a\nspirit of mischief and malice in a wind which had sought out his basket\nin that position.\n\nIt was the commencement of hostilities. Gilliatt understood the token.\n\nTo those who live in a state of rude familiarity with the sea, it\nbecomes natural to regard the wind as an individuality, and the rocks as\nsentient beings.\n\nNothing remained but the biscuit and the rye-meal, except the\nshell-fish, on which the shipwrecked sailor had supported a lingering\nexistence upon \"The Man Rock.\"\n\nIt was useless to think of subsisting by net or line fishing. Fish are\nnaturally averse to the neighbourhood of rocks. The drag and bow net\nfishers would waste their labour among the breakers, the points of which\nwould be destructive only to their nets.\n\nGilliatt breakfasted on a few limpets which he plucked with difficulty\nfrom the rocks. He narrowly escaped breaking his knife in the attempt.\n\nWhile he was making his spare meal, he was sensible of a strange\ndisturbance on the sea. He looked around.\n\nIt was a swarm of gulls and seamews which had just alighted upon some\nlow rocks, and were beating their wings, tumbling over each other,\nscreaming, and shrieking. All were swarming noisily upon the same point.\nThis horde with beaks and talons were evidently pillaging something.\n\nIt was Gilliatt's basket.\n\nRolled down upon a sharp point by the wind, the basket had burst open.\nThe birds had gathered round immediately. They were carrying off in\ntheir beaks all sorts of fragments of provisions. Gilliatt recognised\nfrom the distance his smoked beef and his salted fish.\n\nIt was their turn now to be aggressive. The birds had taken to\nreprisals. Gilliatt had robbed them of their lodging, they deprived him\nof his supper.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE ROCK, AND HOW GILLIATT USED IT\n\n\nA week passed.\n\nAlthough it was in the rainy season no rain fell, a fact for which\nGilliatt felt thankful. But the work he had entered upon surpassed, in\nappearance at least, the power of human hand or skill. Success appeared\nso improbable that the attempt seemed like madness.\n\nIt is not until a task is fairly grappled with that its difficulties and\nperils become fully manifest. There is nothing like making a\ncommencement for making evident how difficult it will be to come to the\nend. Every beginning is a struggle against resistance. The first step is\nan exorable undeceiver. A difficulty which we come to touch pricks like\na thorn.\n\nGilliatt found himself immediately in the presence of obstacles.\n\nIn order to raise the engine of the Durande from the wreck in which it\nwas three-fourths buried, with any chance of success--in order to\naccomplish a salvage in such a place and in such a season, it seemed\nalmost necessary to be a legion of men. Gilliatt was alone; a complete\napparatus of carpenters' and engineers' tools and implements were\nwanted. Gilliatt had a saw, a hatchet, a chisel, and a hammer. He wanted\nboth a good workshop and a good shed; Gilliatt had not a roof to cover\nhim. Provisions, too, were necessary, but he had not even bread.\n\nAny one who could have seen Gilliatt working on the rock during all that\nfirst work might have been puzzled to determine the nature of his\noperations. He seemed to be no longer thinking either of the Durande or\nthe two Douvres. He was busy only among the breakers: he seemed absorbed\nin saving the smaller parts of the shipwreck. He took advantage of every\nhigh tide to strip the reefs of everything which the shipwreck had\ndistributed among them. He went from rock to rock, picking up whatever\nthe sea had scattered--tatters of sail-cloth, pieces of iron, splinters\nof panels, shattered planking, broken yards--here a beam, there a chain,\nthere a pulley.\n\nAt the same time he carefully surveyed all the recesses of the rocks. To\nhis great disappointment none were habitable. He had suffered from the\ncold in the night, where he lodged between the stones on the summit of\nthe rock, and he would gladly have found some better refuge.\n\nTwo of those recesses were somewhat extensive. Although the natural\npavement of rock was almost everywhere oblique and uneven it was\npossible to stand upright, and even to walk within them. The wind and\nthe rain wandered there at will, but the highest tides did not reach\nthem. They were near the Little Douvre, and were approachable at any\ntime. Gilliatt decided that one should serve him as a storehouse, the\nother as a forge.\n\nWith all the sail, rope-bands, and all the reef-earrings he could\ncollect, he made packages of the fragments of wreck, tying up the wood\nand iron in bundles, and the canvas in parcels. He lashed all these\ntogether carefully. As the rising tide approached these packages, he\nbegan to drag them across the reefs to his storehouse. In the hollow of\nthe rocks he had found a top rope, by means of which he had been able to\nhaul even the large pieces of timber. In the same manner he dragged from\nthe sea the numerous portions of chains which he found scattered among\nthe breakers.\n\nGilliatt worked at these tasks with astonishing activity and tenacity.\nHe accomplished whatever he attempted--nothing could withstand his\nant-like perseverance.\n\nAt the end of the week he had gathered into this granite warehouse of\nmarine stores, and ranged into order, all this miscellaneous and\nshapeless mass of salvage. There was a corner for the tacks of sails and\na corner for sheets. Bow-lines were not mixed with halliards; parrels\nwere arranged according to their number of holes. The coverings of\nrope-yarn, unwound from the broken anchorings, were tied in bunches; the\ndead-eyes without pulleys were separated from the tackle-blocks.\nBelaying-pins, bullseyes, preventer-shrouds, down-hauls, snatch-blocks,\npendents, kevels, trusses, stoppers, sailbooms, if they were not\ncompletely damaged by the storm, occupied different compartments. All\nthe cross-beams, timber-work, uprights, stanchions, mast-heads,\nbinding-strakes, portlids, and clamps, were heaped up apart. Wherever it\nwas possible, he had fixed the fragments of planks, from the vessel's\nbottom, one in the other. There was no confusion between reef-points and\nnippers of the cable, nor of crow's-feet with towlines; nor of pulleys\nof the small with pulleys of the large ropes; nor of fragments from the\nwaist with fragments from the stern. A place had been reserved for a\nportion of the cat-harpings of the Durande, which had supported the\nshrouds of the topmast and the futtock-shrouds. Every portion had its\nplace. The entire wreck was there classed and ticketed. It was a sort of\nchaos in a storehouse.\n\nA stay-sail, fixed by huge stones, served, though torn and damaged, to\nprotect what the rain might have injured.\n\nShattered as were the bows of the wreck, he had succeeded in saving the\ntwo cat-heads with their three pulley-blocks.\n\nHe had found the bowsprit too, and had had much trouble in unrolling its\ngammoning; it was very hard and tight, having been, according to custom,\nmade by the help of the windlass, and in dry weather. Gilliatt, however,\npersevered until he had detached it, this thick rope promising to be\nvery useful to him.\n\nHe had been equally successful in discovering the little anchor which\nhad become fast in the hollow of a reef, where the receding tide had\nleft it uncovered.\n\nIn what had been Tangrouille's cabin he had found a piece of chalk,\nwhich he preserved carefully. He reflected that he might have some marks\nto make.\n\nA fire-bucket and several pails in pretty good condition completed this\nstock of working materials.\n\nAll that remained of the store of coal of the Durande he carried into\nthe warehouse.\n\nIn a week this salvage of d\u00c3\u00a9bris was finished; the rock was swept clean,\nand the Durande was lightened. Nothing remained now to burden the hull\nexcept the machinery.\n\nThe portion of the fore-side bulwarks which hung to it did not distress\nthe hull. The mass hung without dragging, being partly sustained by a\nledge of rock. It was, however, large and broad, and heavy to drag, and\nwould have encumbered his warehouse too much. This bulwarking looked\nsomething like a boat-builder's stocks. Gilliatt left it where it was.\n\nHe had been profoundly thoughtful during all this labour. He had sought\nin vain for the figure-head--the \"doll,\" as the Guernsey folks called\nit, of the Durande. It was one of the things which the waves had carried\naway for ever. Gilliatt would have given his hands to find it--if he had\nnot had such peculiar need of them at that time.\n\nAt the entrance to the storehouse and outside were two heaps of\nrefuse--a heap of iron good for forging, and a heap of wood good for\nburning.\n\nGilliatt was always at work at early dawn. Except his time of sleep, he\ndid not take a moment of repose.\n\nThe wild sea birds, flying hither and thither, watched him at his work.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE FORGE\n\n\nThe warehouse completed, Gilliatt constructed his forge.\n\nThe other recess which he had chosen had within it a species of passage\nlike a gallery in a mine of pretty good depth. He had had at first an\nidea of making this his lodging, but the draught was so continuous and\nso persevering in this passage that he had been compelled to give it up.\nThis current of air, incessantly renewed, first gave him the notion of\nthe forge. Since it could not be his chamber, he was determined that\nthis cabin should be his smithy. To bend obstacles to our purposes is a\ngreat step towards triumph. The wind was Gilliatt's enemy. He had set\nabout making it his servant.\n\nThe proverb applied to certain kinds of men--\"Fit for everything, good\nfor nothing\"--may also be applied to the hollows of rocks. They give no\nadvantages gratuitously. On one side we find a hollow fashioned\nconveniently in the shape of a bath; but it allows the water to run away\nthrough a fissure. Here is a rocky chamber, but without a roof; here a\nbed of moss, but oozy with wet; here an arm-chair, but one of hard\nstone.\n\nThe forge which Gilliatt intended was roughly sketched out by nature;\nbut nothing could be more troublesome than to reduce this rough sketch\nto manageable shape, to transform this cavern into a laboratory and\nsmith's shop. With three or four large rocks, shaped like a funnel, and\nending in a narrow fissure, chance had constructed there a species of\nvast ill-shapen blower, of very different power to those huge old forge\nbellows of fourteen feet long, which poured out at every breath\nninety-eight thousand inches of air. This was quite a different sort of\nconstruction. The proportions of the hurricane cannot be definitely\nmeasured.\n\nThis excess of force was an embarrassment. The incessant draught was\ndifficult to regulate.\n\nThe cavern had two inconveniences; the wind traversed it from end to\nend; so did the water.\n\nThis was not the water of the sea, but a continual little trickling\nstream, more like a spring than a torrent.\n\nThe foam, cast incessantly by the surf upon the rocks and sometimes more\nthan a hundred feet in the air, had filled with sea water a natural cave\nsituated among the high rocks overlooking the excavation. The\noverflowings of this reservoir caused, a little behind the escarpment, a\nfall of water of about an inch in breadth, and descending four or five\nfathoms. An occasional contribution from the rains also helped to fill\nthe reservoir. From time to time a passing cloud dropped a shower into\nthe rocky basin, always overflowing. The water was brackish, and unfit\nto drink, but clear. This rill of water fell in graceful drops from the\nextremities of the long marine grasses, as from the ends of a length of\nhair.\n\nHe was struck with the idea of making this water serve to regulate the\ndraught in the cave. By the means of a funnel made of planks roughly and\nhastily put together to form two or three pipes, one of which was fitted\nwith a valve, and of a large tub arranged as a lower reservoir, without\nchecks or counterweight, and completed solely by air-tight stuffing\nabove and air-holes below, Gilliatt, who, as we have already said, was\nhandy at the forge and at the mechanic's bench, succeeded in\nconstructing, instead of the forge-bellows, which he did not possess, an\napparatus less perfect than what is known now-a-days by the name of a\n\"cagniardelle,\" but less rude than what the people of the Pyrenees\nanciently called a \"trompe.\"\n\nHe had some rye-meal, and he manufactured with it some paste. He had\nalso some white rope, which picked out into tow. With this paste and\ntow, and some bits of wood, he stopped all the crevices of the rock,\nleaving only a little air passage made of a powder-flask which he had\nfound aboard the Durande, and which had served for loading the signal\ngun. This powder-flask was directed horizontally to a large stone, which\nGilliatt made the hearth of the forge. A stopper made of a piece of tow\nserved to close it in case of need.\n\nAfter this, he heaped up the wood and coal upon the hearth, struck his\nsteel against the bare rock, caught a spark upon a handful of loose tow,\nand having ignited it, soon lighted his forge fire.\n\nHe tried the blower: it worked well.\n\nGilliatt felt the pride of a Cyclops: he was the master of air, water,\nand fire. Master of the air; for he had given a kind of lungs to the\nwind, and changed the rude draught into a useful blower. Master of\nwater, for he had converted the little cascade into a \"trompe.\" Master\nof fire, for out of this moist rock he had struck a flame.\n\nThe cave being almost everywhere open to the sky, the smoke issued\nfreely, blackening the curved escarpment. The rocks which seemed\ndestined for ever to receive only the white foam, became now familiar\nwith the blackening smoke.\n\nGilliatt selected for an anvil a large smooth round stone, of about the\nrequired shape and dimensions. It formed a base for the blows of his\nhammer; but one that might fly and was very dangerous. One of the\nextremities of this block, rounded and ending in a point, might, for\nwant of anything better, serve instead of a conoid bicorn; but the other\nkind of bicorn of the pyramidal form was wanting. It was the ancient\nstone anvil of the Troglodytes. The surface, polished by the waves, had\nalmost the firmness of steel.\n\nHe regretted not having brought his anvil. As he did not know that the\nDurande had been broken in two by the tempest, he had hoped to find the\ncarpenter's chest and all his tools generally kept in the forehold. But\nit was precisely the fore-part of the vessel which had been carried\naway.\n\nThese two excavations which he had found in the rock were contiguous.\nThe warehouse and the forge communicated with each other.\n\nEvery evening, when his work was ended, he supped on a little biscuit,\nmoistened in water, a sea-urchin or a crab, or a few _ch\u00c3\u00a2taignes de\nmer_, the only food to be found among those rocks; and shivering like\nhis knotted cord, mounted again to sleep in his cell upon the Great\nDouvre.\n\nThe very materialism of his daily occupation increased the kind of\nabstraction in which he lived. To be steeped too deeply in realities is\nin itself a cause of visionary moods. His bodily labour, with its\ninfinite variety of details, detracted nothing from the sensation of\nstupor which arose from the strangeness of his position and his work.\nOrdinary bodily fatigue is a thread which binds man to the earth; but\nthe very peculiarity of the enterprise he was engaged in kept him in a\nsort of ideal twilight region. There were times when he seemed to be\nstriking blows with his hammer in the clouds. At other moments his tools\nappeared to him like arms. He had a singular feeling, as if he was\nrepressing or providing against some latent danger of attack. Untwisting\nropes, unravelling threads of yarn in a sail, or propping up a couple of\nbeams, appeared to him at such times like fashioning engines of war. The\nthousand minute pains which he took about his salvage operations\nproduced at last in his mind the effect of precautions against\naggressions little concealed, and easy to anticipate. He did not know\nthe words which express the ideas, but he perceived them. His instincts\nbecame less and less those of the worker; his habits more and more those\nof the savage man.\n\nHis business there was to subdue and direct the powers of nature. He had\nan indistinct perception of it. A strange enlargement of his ideas!\n\nAround him, far as eye could reach, was the vast prospect of endless\nlabour wasted and lost. Nothing is more disturbing to the mind than the\ncontemplation of the diffusion of forces at work in the unfathomable and\nillimitable space of the ocean. The mind tends naturally to seek the\nobject of these forces. The unceasing movement in space, the unwearying\nsea, the clouds that seem ever hurrying somewhere, the vast mysterious\nprodigality of effort, all this is a problem. Whither does this\nperpetual movement tend? What do these winds construct? What do these\ngiant blows build up? These howlings, shocks, and sobbings of the storm,\nwhat do they end in? and what is the business of this tumult? The ebb\nand flow of these questionings is eternal, as the flux and reflux of\nthe sea itself. Gilliatt could answer for himself; his work he knew, but\nthe agitation which surrounded him far and wide at all times perplexed\nhim confusedly with its eternal questionings. Unknown to himself,\nmechanically, by the mere pressure of external things, and without any\nother effect than a strange, unconscious bewilderment, Gilliatt, in this\ndreamy mood, blended his own toil somehow with the prodigious wasted\nlabour of the sea-waves. How, indeed, in that position, could he escape\nthe influence of that mystery of the dread, laborious ocean? how do\nother than meditate, so far as meditation was possible, upon the\nvacillation of the waves, the perseverance of the foam, the\nimperceptible wearing down of rocks, the furious beatings of the four\nwinds? How terrible that perpetual recommencement, that ocean bed, those\nDana\u00c3\u00afdes-like clouds, all that travail and weariness for no end!\n\nFor no end? Not so! But for what? O Thou Infinite Unknown, Thou only\nknowest!\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n\nA rock near the coast is sometimes visited by men; a rock in mid-ocean\nnever. What object could any one have there? No supplies can be drawn\nthence; no fruit-trees are there, no pasturage, no beasts, no springs of\nwater fitted for man's use. It stands aloft, a rock with its steep sides\nand summits above water, and its sharp points below. Nothing is to be\nfound there but inevitable shipwreck.\n\nThis kind of rocks, which in the old sea dialect were called _Isol\u00c3\u00a9s_,\nare, as we have said, strange places. The sea is alone there; she works\nher own will. No token of terrestrial life disturbs her. Man is a terror\nto the sea; she is shy of his approach, and hides from him her deeds.\nBut she is bolder among the lone sea rocks. The everlasting soliloquy of\nthe waves is not troubled there. She labours at the rock, repairs its\ndamage, sharpens its peaks, makes them rugged or renews them. She\npierces the granite, wears down the soft stone, and denudes the hard;\nshe rummages, dismembers, bores, perforates, and grooves; she fills the\nrock with cells, and makes it sponge-like, hollows out the inside, or\nsculptures it without. In that secret mountain which is hers, she makes\nto herself caves, sanctuaries, palaces. She has her splendid and\nmonstrous vegetation, composed of floating plants which bite, and of\nmonsters which take root; and she hides away all this terrible\nmagnificence in the twilight of her deeps. Among the isolated rocks no\neye watches over her; no spy embarrasses her movements. It is there that\nshe develops at liberty her mysterious side, which is inaccessible to\nman. Here she keeps all strange secretions of life. Here that the\nunknown wonders of the sea are assembled.\n\nPromontories, forelands, capes, headlands, breakers, and shoals are\nveritable constructions. The geological changes of the earth are\ntrifling compared with the vast operations of the ocean. These breakers,\nthese habitations in the sea, these pyramids, and spouts of the foam are\nthe practicers of a mysterious art which the author of this book has\nsomewhere called \"the Art of Nature.\" Their style is known by its\nvastness. The effects of chance seem here design. Its works are\nmultiform. They abound in the mazy entanglement of the rock-coral\ngroves, the sublimity of the cathedral, the extravagance of the pagoda,\nthe amplitude of the mountain, the delicacy of the jeweller's work, the\nhorror of the sepulchre. They are filled with cells like the wasps'\nnest, with dens like menageries, with subterranean passages like the\nhaunts of moles, with dungeons like Bastiles, with ambuscades like a\ncamp. They have their doors, but they are barricaded; their columns, but\nthey are shattered; their towers, but they are tottering; their bridges,\nbut they are broken. Their compartments are unaccommodating; these are\nfitted for the birds only, those only for fish. They are impassable.\nTheir architectural style is variable and inconsistent; it regards or\ndisregards at will the laws of equilibrium, breaks off, stops short,\nbegins in the form of an archivolt, and ends in an architrave, block on\nblock. Enceladus is the mason. A wondrous science of dynamics exhibits\nhere its problems ready solved. Fearful overhanging blocks threaten, but\nfall not: the human mind cannot guess what power supports their\nbewildering masses. Blind entrances, gaps, and ponderous suspensions\nmultiply and vary infinitely. The laws which regulate this Babel baffle\nhuman induction. The great unknown architect plans nothing, but succeeds\nin all. Rocks massed together in confusion form a monstrous monument,\ndefy reason, yet maintain equilibrium. Here is something more than\nstrength; it is eternity. But order is wanting. The wild tumult of the\nwaves seems to have passed into the wilderness of stone. It is like a\ntempest petrified and fixed for ever. Nothing is more impressive than\nthat wild architecture; always standing, yet always seeming to fall; in\nwhich everything appears to give support, and yet to withdraw it. A\nstruggle between opposing lines has resulted in the construction of an\nedifice, filled with traces of the efforts of those old antagonists, the\nocean and the storm.\n\nThis architecture has its terrible masterpieces, of which the Douvres\nrock was one.\n\nThe sea had fashioned and perfected it with a sinister solicitude. The\nsnarling waters licked it into shape. It was hideous, treacherous, dark,\nfull of hollows.\n\nIt had a complete system of submarine caverns ramifying and losing\nthemselves in unfathomed depths. Some of the orifices of this labyrinth\nof passages were left exposed by the low tides. A man might enter there,\nbut at his risk and peril.\n\nGilliatt determined to explore all these grottoes, for the purpose of\nhis salvage labour. There was not one which was not repulsive.\nEverywhere about the caverns that strange aspect of an abattoir, those\nsingular traces of slaughter, appeared again in all the exaggeration of\nthe ocean. No one who has not seen in excavations of this kind, upon the\nwalls of everlasting granite, these hideous natural frescoes, can form a\nnotion of their singularity.\n\nThese pitiless caverns, too, were false and sly. Woe betide him who\nwould loiter there. The rising tide filled them to their roofs.\n\nRock limpets and edible mosses abounded among them.\n\nThey were obstructed by quantities of shingle, heaped together in their\nrecesses. Some of their huge smooth stones weighed more than a ton. They\nwere of every proportion, and of every hue; but the greater part were\nblood coloured. Some, covered with a hairy and glutinous seaweed, seemed\nlike large green moles boring a way into the rock.\n\nSeveral of the caverns terminated abruptly in the form of a demi-cupola.\nOthers, main arteries of a mysterious circulation, lengthened out in the\nrock in dark and tortuous fissures. They were the alleys of the\nsubmarine city; but they gradually contracted from their entrances, and\nat length left no way for a man to pass. Peering in by the help of a\nlighted torch, he could see nothing but dark hollows dripping with\nmoisture.\n\nOne day, Gilliatt, exploring, ventured into one of these fissures. The\nstate of the tide favoured the attempt. It was a beautiful day of calm\nand sunshine. There was no fear of any accident from the sea to increase\nthe danger.\n\nTwo necessities, as we have said, compelled him to undertake these\nexplorations. He had to gather fragments of wreck and other things to\naid him in his labour, and to search for crabs and crayfish for his\nfood. Shell-fish had begun to fail him on the rocks.\n\nThe fissure was narrow, and the passage difficult. Gilliatt could see\ndaylight beyond. He made an effort, contorted himself as much as he\ncould, and penetrated into the cave as far as he was able.\n\nHe had reached, without suspecting it, the interior of the rock, upon\nthe point of which Clubin had steered the Durande. Though abrupt and\nalmost inaccessible without, it was hollowed within. It was full of\ngalleries, pits, and chambers, like the tomb of an Egyptian king. This\nnetwork of caverns was one of the most complicated of all that\nlabyrinth, a labour of the water, the undermining of the restless sea.\nThe branches of the subterranean maze probably communicated with the sea\nwithout by more than one issue, some gaping at the level of the waves,\nthe others profound and invisible. It was near here, but Gilliatt knew\nit not, that Clubin had dived into the sea.\n\nIn this crocodile cave--where crocodiles, it is true, were not among the\ndangers--Gilliatt wound about, clambered, struck his head occasionally,\nbent low and rose again, lost his footing and regained it many times,\nadvancing laboriously. By degrees the gallery widened; a glimmer of\ndaylight appeared, and he found himself suddenly at the entrance to a\ncavern of a singular kind.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE INTERIOR OF AN EDIFICE UNDER THE SEA\n\n\nThe gleam of daylight was fortunate.\n\nOne step further, and Gilliatt must have fallen into a pool, perhaps\nwithout bottom. The waters of these cavern pools are so cold and\nparalysing as to prove fatal to the strongest swimmers.\n\nThere is, moreover, no means of remounting or of hanging on to any part\nof their steep walls.\n\nHe stopped short. The crevice from which he had just issued ended in a\nnarrow and slippery projection, a species of corbel in the peaked wall.\nHe leaned against the side and surveyed it.\n\nHe was in a large cave. Over his head was a roofing not unlike the\ninside of a vast skull, which might have been imagined to have been\nrecently dissected. The dripping ribs of the striated indentations of\nthe roof seemed to imitate the branching fibres and jagged sutures of\nthe bony cranium. A stony ceiling and a watery floor. The rippled waters\nbetween the four walls of the cave were like wavy paving tiles. The\ngrotto was shut in on all sides. Not a window, not even an air-hole\nvisible. No breach in the wall, no crack in the roof. The light came\nfrom below and through the water, a strange, sombre light.\n\nGilliatt, the pupils of whose eyes had contracted during his\nexplorations of the dusky corridor, could distinguish everything about\nhim in the pale glimmer.\n\nHe was familiar, from having often visited them, with the caves of\nPl\u00c3\u00a9mont in Jersey, the Creux-Maill\u00c3\u00a9 at Guernsey, the Boutiques at Sark;\nbut none of these marvellous caverns could compare with the subterranean\nand submarine chamber into which he had made his way.\n\nUnder the water at his feet he could see a sort of drowned arch. This\narch, a natural ogive, fashioned by the waves, was glittering between\nits two dark and profound supports. It was by this submerged porch that\nthe daylight entered into the cavern from the open sea. A strange light\nshooting upward from a gulf.\n\nThe glimmer spread out beneath the waters like a large fan, and was\nreflected on the rocks. Its direct rays, divided into long, broad\nshafts, appeared in strong relief against the darkness below, and\nbecoming brighter or more dull from one rock to another, looked as if\nseen here and there through plates of glass. There was light in that\ncave it is true; but it was the light that was unearthly. The beholder\nmight have dreamed that he had descended in some other planet. The\nglimmer was an enigma, like the glaucous light from the eye-pupil of a\nSphinx. The whole cave represented the interior of a death's-head of\nenormous proportions, and of a strange splendour. The vault was the\nhollow of the brain, the arch the mouth; the sockets of the eyes were\nwanting. The cavern, alternately swallowing and rendering up the flux\nand reflux through its mouth wide opened to the full noonday without,\nseemed to drink in the light and vomit forth bitterness; a type of some\nbeings intelligent and evil. The light, in traversing this inlet through\nthe vitreous medium of the sea-water, became green, like a ray of\nstarlight from Aldebaran. The water, filled with the moist light,\nappeared like a liquid emerald. A tint of aqua-marina of marvellous\ndelicacy spread a soft hue throughout the cavern. The roof, with its\ncerebral lobes, and its rampant ramifications, like the fibres of\nnerves, gave out a tender reflection of chrysoprase. The ripples\nreflected on the roof were falling in order and dissolving again\nincessantly, and enlarging and contracting their glittering scales in a\nmysterious and mazy dance. They gave the beholder an impression of\nsomething weird and spectral: he wondered what prey secured, or what\nexpectation about to be realised, moved with a joyous thrill this\nmagnificent network of living fire. From the projections of the vault,\nand the angles of the rock, hung lengths of delicate fibrous plants,\nbathing their roots probably through the granite in some upper pool of\nwater, and distilling from their silky ends one after the other, a drop\nof water like a pearl. These drops fell in the water now and then with a\ngentle splash. The effect of the scene was singular. Nothing more\nbeautiful could be imagined; nothing more mournful could anywhere be\nfound.\n\nIt was a wondrous palace, in which death sat smiling and content.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nWHAT WAS SEEN THERE; AND WHAT PERCEIVED DIMLY\n\n\nA place of shade, which yet was dazzling to the eyes--such was this\nsurprising cavern.\n\nThe beating of the sea made itself felt throughout the cavern. The\noscillation without raised and depressed the level of the waters within,\nwith the regularity of respiration. A mysterious spirit seemed to fill\nthis great organism, as it swelled and subsided in silence.\n\nThe water had a magical transparency, and Gilliatt distinguished at\nvarious depths submerged recesses, and surfaces of jutting rocks ever of\na deeper and a deeper green. Certain dark hollows, too, were there,\nprobably too deep for soundings.\n\nOn each side of the submarine porch, rude elliptical arches, filled with\nshallows, indicated the position of small lateral caves, low alcoves of\nthe central cavern, accessible, perhaps, at certain tides. These\nopenings had roofs in the form of inclined planes, and at angles more or\nless acute. Little sandy beaches of a few feet wide, laid bare by the\naction of the water, stretched inward, and were lost in these recesses.\n\nHere and there seaweeds of more than a fathom in length undulated\nbeneath the water, like the waving of long tresses in the wind; and\nthere were glimpses of a forest of sea plants.\n\nAbove and below the surface of the water, the wall of the cavern from\ntop to bottom--from the vault down to the depth at which it became\ninvisible--was tapestried with that prodigious efflorescence of the sea,\nrarely perceived by human eyes, which the old Spanish navigators called\n_praderias del mar_. A luxuriant moss, having all the tints of the\nolive, enlarged and concealed the protuberances of granite. From all the\njutting points swung the thin fluted strips of varech, which sailors use\nas their barometers. The light breath which stirred in the cavern waved\nto and fro their glossy bands.\n\nUnder these vegetations there showed themselves from time to time some\nof the rarest _bijoux_ of the casket of the ocean; ivory shells,\nstrombi, purple-fish, univalves, struthiolaires, turriculated cerites.\nThe bell-shaped limpet shells, like tiny huts, were everywhere adhering\nto the rocks, distributed in settlements, in the alleys between which\nprowled oscabrions, those beetles of the sea. A few large pebbles found\ntheir way into the cavern; shell-fish took refuge there. The crustacea\nare the grandees of the sea, who, in their lacework and embroidery,\navoid the rude contact of the pebbly crowd. The glittering heap of their\nshells, in certain spots under the wave, gave out singular irradiations,\namidst which the eye caught glimpses of confused azure and gold, and\nmother-of-pearl, of every tint of the water.\n\nUpon the side of the cavern, a little above the water-line, a\nmagnificent and singular plant, attaching itself, like a fringe, to the\nborder of seaweed, continued and completed it. This plant, thick,\nfibrous, inextricably intertwined, and almost black, exhibited to the\neye large confused and dusky festoons, everywhere dotted with\ninnumerable little flowers of the colour of lapis-lazuli. In the water\nthey seemed to glow like small blue flames. Out of the water they were\nflowers; beneath it they were sapphires. The water rising and inundating\nthe basement of the grotto clothed with these plants, seemed to cover\nthe rock with gems.\n\nAt every swelling of the wave these flowers increased in splendour, and\nat every subsidence grew dull again. So it is with the destiny of man;\naspiration is life, the outbreathing of the spirit is death.\n\nOne of the marvels of the cavern was the rock itself. Forming here a\nwall, there an arch, and here again a pillar or pilaster, it was in\nplaces rough and bare, and sometimes close beside, was wrought with the\nmost delicate natural carving. Strange evidences of mind mingled with\nthe massive stolidity of the granite. It was the wondrous art-work of\nthe ocean. Here a sort of panel, cut square, and covered with round\nembossments in various positions, simulated a vague bas-relief. Before\nthis sculpture, with its obscure designs, a man might have dreamed of\nPrometheus roughly sketching for Michael Angelo. It seemed as if that\ngreat genius with a few blows of his mallet could have finished the\nindistinct labours of the giant. In other places the rock was damasked\nlike a Saracen buckler, or engraved like a Florentine vase. There were\nportions which appeared like Corinthian brass, then like arabesques, as\non the door of a mosque; then like Runic stones with obscure and mystic\nprints of claws. Plants with twisted creepers and tendrils, crossing and\nrecrossing upon the groundwork of golden lichens, covered it with\nfiligree. The grotto resembled in some wise a Moorish palace. It was a\nunion of barbarism and of goldsmith's work, with the imposing and rugged\narchitecture of the elements.\n\nThe magnificent stains and moulderings of the sea covered, as with\nvelvet, the angles of granite. The escarpments were festooned with\nlarge-flowered bindweed, sustaining itself with graceful ease, and\nornamenting the walls as by intelligent design. Wall-pellitories showed\ntheir strange clusters in tasteful arrangement. The wondrous light which\ncame from beneath the water, at once a submarine twilight and an Elysian\nradiance, softened down and blended all harsh lineaments. Every wave was\na prism. The outlines of things under these rainbow-tinted undulations\nproduced the chromatic effects of optical glasses made too convex. Solar\nspectra shot through the waters. Fragments of rainbows seemed floating\nin that transparent dawn. Elsewhere--in other corners--there was\ndiscernible a kind of moonlight in the water. Every kind of splendour\nseemed to mingle there, forming a strange sort of twilight. Nothing\ncould be more perplexing or enigmatical than the sumptuous beauties of\nthis cavern. Enchantment reigned over all. The fantastic vegetation,\nthe rude masonry of the place seemed to harmonise. It was a happy\nmarriage this, between these strange wild things. The branches seeming\nbut to touch one another clung closely each to each. The stern rock and\nthe pale flower met in a passionate embrace. Massive pillars had\ncapitals and entwining wreaths of delicate garlands, that quivered\nthrough every fibre, suggestive of fairy fingers tickling the feet of a\nBehemoth, and the rock upheld the plant, and the plant clasped the rock\nwith unnatural joy of attraction.\n\nThe effect produced by the mysterious reconciliation of these strange\nforms was of a supreme and inexpressible beauty.\n\nThe works of nature, not less than the works of genius, contain the\nabsolute, and produce an impression of awe. Something unexpected about\nthem imperiously insists on our mental submission; we are conscious of a\npremeditation beyond our human scope, and at no time are they more\nstartling than when we suddenly become aware of the beauty that is\nmingled with their terror.\n\nThis hidden grotto was, if we may use the expression, siderealised.\nThere was everything in it to surprise and overwhelm. An apocalyptic\nlight illuminated this crypt. One could not tell if that which the eyes\nlooked upon was a reality, for reality bore the impress of the\nimpossible. One could see, and touch, and know that one was standing\nthere, and yet it was difficult to believe in it all.\n\nWas it daylight which entered by this casement beneath the sea? Was it\nindeed water which trembled in this dusky pool? Were not these arched\nroofs and porches fashioned out of sunset clouds to imitate a cavern to\nmen's eyes? What stone was that beneath the feet? Was not this solid\nshaft about to melt and pass into thin air? What was that cunning\njewellery of glittering shells, half seen beneath the wave? How far away\nwere life, and the green earth, and human faces? What strange\nenchantment haunted that mystic twilight? What blind emotion, mingling\nits sympathies with the uneasy restlessness of plants beneath the wave?\n\nAt the extremity of the cavern, which was oblong, rose a Cyclopean\narchivolte, singularly exact in form. It was a species of cave within a\ncave, of tabernacle within a sanctuary. Here, behind a sheet of bright\nverdure, interposed like the veil of a temple, arose a stone out of the\nwaves, having square sides, and bearing some resemblance to an altar.\nThe water surrounded it in all parts. It seemed as if a goddess had\njust descended from it. One might have dreamed there that some\ncelestial form beneath that crypt or upon that altar dwelt for ever\npensive in naked beauty, but grew invisible at the approach of mortals.\nIt was hard to conceive that majestic chamber without a vision within.\nThe day-dream of the intruder might evoke again the marvellous\napparition. A flood of chaste light falling upon white shoulders\nscarcely seen; a forehead bathed with the light of dawn; an Olympian\nvisage oval-shaped; a bust full of mysterious grace; arms modestly\ndrooping; tresses unloosened in the aurora; a body delicately modelled\nof pure whiteness, half-wrapped in a sacred cloud, with the glance of a\nvirgin; a Venus rising from the sea, or Eve issuing from chaos; such was\nthe dream which filled the mind.\n\nIt seemed improbable that no phantom figure haunted this abode. Some\nwoman's form, the embodiment of a star, had no doubt but shortly left\nthe altar. Enveloped in this atmosphere of mute adoration the mind\npictured an Amphitryon, a Tethys, some Diana capable of passion, some\nidealistic figure formed of light, looking softly down in the\nsurrounding dusk. It was she who had left behind in the cave this\nperfumed luminosity, an emanation from her star-body. The dazzling\nphantom was no longer visible, she was only revealed by the invisible,\nand the sense of her presence lingered, setting the whole being\nvoluptuously a-quiver. The goddess had departed, but divinity remained.\n\nThe beauty of the recess seemed made for this celestial presence. It was\nfor the sake of this deity, this fairy of the pearl caverns, this queen\nof the Zephyrs, this Grace born of the waves, it was for her--as the\nmind, at least, imagined--that this subterranean dwelling had been thus\nreligiously walled in, so that nothing might ever trouble the reverent\nshadows and the majestic silence round about that divine spirit.\n\nGilliatt, who was a kind of seer amid the secrets of nature, stood there\nmusing, and sensible of confused emotions.\n\nSuddenly, at a few feet below him, in the delightful transparence of\nthat water like liquid jewels, he became sensible of the approach of\nsomething of mystic shape. A species of long ragged band was moving\namidst the oscillation of the waves. It did not float, but darted about\nof its own will. It had an object; was advancing somewhere rapidly. The\nobject had something of the form of a jester's bauble with points, which\nhung flabby and undulating. It seemed covered with a dust incapable of\nbeing washed away by the water. It was more than horrible; it was foul.\nThe beholder felt that it was something monstrous. It was a living\nthing; unless, indeed, it were but an illusion. It seemed to be seeking\nthe darker portion of the cavern, where at last it vanished. The heavy\nshadows grew darker as its sinister form glided into them, and\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nTHE LABOUR\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE RESOURCES OF ONE WHO HAS NOTHING\n\n\nThe cavern did not easily part with its explorers. The entry had been\ndifficult; going back was more difficult still. Gilliatt, however,\nsucceeded in extricating himself; but he did not return there. He had\nfound nothing of what he was in quest of, and he had not the time to\nindulge curiosity.\n\nHe put the forge in operation at once. Tools were wanting; he set to\nwork and made them.\n\nFor fuel he had the wreck; for motive force the water; for his bellows\nthe wind; for his anvil a stone; for art his instinct; for power his\nwill.\n\nHe entered with ardour upon his sombre labours.\n\nThe weather seemed to smile upon his work. It continued to be dry and\nfree from equinoctial gales. The month of March had come, but it was\ntranquil. The days grew longer. The blue of the sky, the gentleness of\nall the movements of the scene, the serenity of the noontide, seemed to\nexclude the idea of mischief. The waves danced merrily in the sunlight.\nA Judas kiss is the first step to treachery; of such caresses the ocean\nis prodigal. Her smile, like that of woman's sometimes, cannot be\ntrusted.\n\nThere was little wind. The hydraulic bellows worked all the better for\nthat reason. Much wind would have embarrassed rather than aided it.\nGilliatt had a saw; he manufactured for himself a file. With the saw he\nattacked the wood; with the file the metal. Then he availed himself of\nthe two iron hands of the smith--the pincers and the pliers. The pincers\ngripe, the pliers handle; the one is like the closed hand, the other\nlike the fingers. By degrees he made for himself a number of\nauxiliaries, and constructed his armour. With a piece of hoop-wood he\nmade a screen for his forge-fire.\n\nOne of his principal labours was the sorting and repair of pulleys. He\nmended both the blocks and the sheaves of tackle. He cut down the\nirregularities of all broken joists, and reshaped the extremities. He\nhad, as we have said, for the necessities of his carpentry, a quantity\nof pieces of wood, stored away, and arranged according to the forms, the\ndimensions, and the nature of their grain; the oak on one side, the pine\non the other; the short pieces like riders, separated from the straight\npieces like binding strakes. This formed his reserve of supports and\nlevers, of which he might stand in great need at any moment.\n\nAny one who intends to construct hoisting tackle ought to provide\nhimself with beams and small cables. But that is not sufficient. He must\nhave cordage. Gilliatt restored the cables, large and small. He frayed\nout the tattered sails, and succeeded in converting them into an\nexcellent yarn, of which he made twine. With this he joined the ropes.\nThe joins, however, were liable to rot. It was necessary, therefore, to\nhasten to make use of these cables. He had only been able to make white\ntow, for he was without tar.\n\nThe ropes mended, he proceeded to repair the chains.\n\nThanks to the lateral point of the stone anvil, which served the part of\nthe conoid bicorn, he was able to forge rings rude in shape but strong.\nWith these he fastened together the severed lengths of chains, and made\nlong pieces.\n\nTo work at a forge without assistance is something more than\ntroublesome. He succeeded nevertheless. It is true that he had only to\nforge and shape articles of comparatively small size, which he was able\nto handle with the pliers in one hand, while he hammered with the other.\n\nHe cut into lengths the iron bars of the captain's bridge on which\nClubin used to pass to and fro from paddle-box to paddle-box giving his\norders; forged at one extremity of each piece a point, and at the other\na flat head. By this means he manufactured large nails of about a foot\nin length. These nails, much used in pontoon making, are useful in\nfixing anything in rocks.\n\nWhat was his object in all these labours? We shall see.\n\nHe was several times compelled to renew the blade of his hatchet and the\nteeth of his saw. For renotching the saw he had manufactured a\nthree-sided file.\n\nOccasionally he made use of the capstan of the Durande. The hook of the\nchain broke: he made another.\n\nBy the aid of his pliers and pincers, and by using his chisel as a\nscrewdriver, he set to work to remove the two paddle-wheels of the\nvessel; an object which he accomplished. This was rendered practicable\nby reason of a peculiarity in their construction. The paddle-boxes which\ncovered them served him to stow them away. With the planks of these\npaddle-boxes, he made two cases in which he deposited the two paddles,\npiece by piece, each part being carefully numbered.\n\nHis lump of chalk became precious for this purpose.\n\nHe kept the two cases upon the strongest part of the wreck.\n\nWhen these preliminaries were completed, he found himself face to face\nwith the great difficulty. The problem of the engine of the Durande was\nnow clearly before him.\n\nTaking the paddle-wheels to pieces had proved practicable. It was very\ndifferent with the machinery.\n\nIn the first place, he was almost entirely ignorant of the details of\nthe mechanism. Working thus blindly he might do some irreparable damage.\nThen, even in attempting to dismember it, if he had ventured on that\ncourse, far other tools would be necessary than such as he could\nfabricate with a cavern for a forge, a wind-draught for bellows, and a\nstone for an anvil. In attempting, therefore, to take to pieces the\nmachinery, there was the risk of destroying it.\n\nThe attempt seemed at first sight wholly impracticable.\n\nThe apparent impossibility of the project rose before him like a stone\nwall, blocking further progress.\n\nWhat was to be done?\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nWHEREIN SHAKESPEARE AND \u00c3\u0086SCHYLUS MEET\n\n\nGilliatt had a notion.\n\nSince the time of the carpenter-mason of Salbris, who, in the sixteenth\ncentury, in the dark ages of science--long before Amontons had\ndiscovered the first law of electricity, or Lahire the second, or\nCoulomb the third--without other helper than a child, his son, with\nill-fashioned tools, in the chamber of the great clock of La\nCharit\u00c3\u00a9-sur-Loire, resolved at one stroke five or six problems in\nstatics and dynamics inextricably intervolved like the wheels in a block\nof carts and waggons--since the time of that grand and marvellous\nachievement of the poor workman, who found means, without breaking a\nsingle piece of wire, without throwing one of the teeth of the wheels\nout of gear, to lower in one piece, by a marvellous simplification, from\nthe second story of the clock-tower to the first, that massive monitor\nof the hours, made all of iron and brass, \"large as the room in which\nthe man watches at night from the tower,\" with its motion, its\ncylinders, its barrels, its drum, its hooks, and its weights, the barrel\nof its spring steel-yard, its horizontal pendulum, the holdfasts of its\nescapement, its reels of large and small chains, its stone weights, one\nof which weighed five hundred pounds, its bells, its peals, its jacks\nthat strike the hours--since the days, I say, of the man who\naccomplished this miracle, and of whom posterity knows not even the\nname--nothing that could be compared with the project which Gilliatt was\nmeditating had ever been attempted.\n\nThe ponderousness, the delicacy, the involvement of the difficulties\nwere not less in the machinery of the Durande than in the clock of La\nCharit\u00c3\u00a9-sur-Loire.\n\nThe untaught mechanic had his helpmate--his son; Gilliatt was alone.\n\nA crowd gathered together from Meung-sur-Loire, from Nevers, and even\nfrom Orleans, able at time of need to assist the mason of Salbris, and\nto encourage him with their friendly voices. Gilliatt had around him no\nvoices but those of the wind; no crowd but the assemblage of waves.\n\nThere is nothing more remarkable than the timidity of ignorance, unless\nit be its temerity. When ignorance becomes daring, she has sometimes a\nsort of compass within herself--the intuition of the truth, clearer\noftentimes in a simple mind than in a learned brain.\n\nIgnorance invites to an attempt. It is a state of wonderment, which,\nwith its concomitant curiosity, forms a power. Knowledge often enough\ndisconcerts and makes over-cautious. Gama, had he known what lay before\nhim, would have recoiled before the Cape of Storms. If Columbus had been\na great geographer, he might have failed to discover America.\n\nThe second successful climber of Mont Blanc was the savant, Saussure;\nthe first the goatherd, Balmat.\n\nThese instances I admit are exceptions, which detract nothing from\nscience, which remains the rule. The ignorant man may discover; it is\nthe learned who invent.\n\nThe sloop was still at anchor in the creek of \"The Man Rock,\" where the\nsea left it in peace. Gilliatt, as will be remembered, had arranged\neverything for maintaining constant communication with it. He visited\nthe sloop and measured her beam carefully in several parts, but\nparticularly her midship frame. Then he returned to the Durande and\nmeasured the diameter of the floor of the engine-room. This diameter,\nof course, without the paddles, was two feet less than the broadest part\nof the deck of his bark. The machinery, therefore, might be put aboard\nthe sloop.\n\nBut how could it be got there?\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nGILLIATT'S MASTERPIECE COMES TO THE RESCUE OF THAT OF LETHIERRY\n\n\nAny fisherman who had been mad enough to loiter in that season in the\nneighbourhood of Gilliatt's labours about this time would have been\nrepaid for his hardihood, by a singular sight between the two Douvres.\n\nBefore his eyes would have appeared four stout beams, at equal\ndistances, stretching from one Douvre to the other, and apparently\nforced into the rock, which is the firmest of all holds. On the Little\nDouvre, their extremities were laid and buttressed upon the projections\nof rock. On the Great Douvre, they had been driven in by blows of a\nhammer, by the powerful hand of a workman standing upright upon the beam\nitself. These supports were a little longer than the distance between\nthe rocks. Hence the firmness of their hold; and hence, also, their\nslanting position. They touched the Great Douvre at an acute, and the\nLittle Douvre at an obtuse angle. Their inclination was only slight; but\nit was unequal, which was a defect. But for this defect, they might have\nbeen supposed to be prepared to receive the planking of a deck. To these\nfour beams were attached four sets of hoisting apparatus, each having\nits pendent and its tackle-fall, with the bold peculiarity of having the\ntackle-blocks with two sheaves at one extremity of the beam, and the\nsimple pulleys at the opposite end. This distance, which was too great\nnot to be perilous, was necessitated by the operations to be effected.\nThe blocks were firm, and the pulleys strong. To this tackle-gear cables\nwere attached, which from a distance looked like threads; while beneath\nthis apparatus of tackle and carpentry, in the air, the massive hull of\nthe Durande seemed suspended by threads.\n\nShe was not yet suspended, however. Under the cross beams, eight\nperpendicular holes had been made in the deck, four on the port, and\nfour on the starboard side of the engine; eight other holes had been\nmade beneath them through the keel. The cables, descending vertically\nfrom the four tackle-blocks, through the deck, passed out at the keel,\nand under the machinery, re-entered the ship by the holes on the other\nside, and passing again upward through the deck, returned, and were\nwound round the beams. Here a sort of jigger-tackle held them in a bunch\nbound fast to a single cable, capable of being directed by one arm. The\nsingle cable passed over a hook, and through a dead-eye, which completed\nthe apparatus, and kept it in check. This combination compelled the four\ntacklings to work together, and acting as a complete restraint upon the\nsuspending powers, became a sort of dynamical rudder in the hand of the\npilot of the operation, maintaining the movements in equilibrium. The\ningenious adjustment of this system of tackling had some of the\nsimplifying qualities of the Weston pulley of these times, with a\nmixture of the antique polyspaston of Vitruvius. Gilliatt had discovered\nthis, although he knew nothing of the dead Vitruvius or of the still\nunborn Weston. The length of the cables varied, according to the unequal\ndeclivity of the cross-beams. The ropes were dangerous, for the untarred\nhemp was liable to give way. Chains would have been better in this\nrespect, but chains would not have passed well through the\ntackle-blocks.\n\nThe apparatus was full of defects; but as the work of one man, it was\nsurprising. For the rest, it will be understood that many details are\nomitted which would render the construction perhaps intelligible to\npractical mechanics, but obscure to others.\n\nThe top of the funnel passed between the two beams in the middle.\n\nGilliatt, without suspecting it, had reconstructed, three centuries\nlater, the mechanism of the Salbris carpenter--a mechanism rude and\nincorrect, and hazardous for him who would dare to use it.\n\nHere let us remark, that the rudest defects do not prevent a mechanism\nfrom working well or ill. It may limp, but it moves. The obelisk in the\nsquare of St. Peter's at Rome is erected in a way which offends against\nall the principles of statics. The carriage of the Czar Peter was so\nconstructed that it appeared about to overturn at every step; but it\ntravelled onward for all that. What deformities are there in the\nmachinery of Marly! Everything that is heterodox in hydraulics. Yet it\ndid not supply Louis XIV. any the less with water.\n\nCome what might, Gilliatt had faith. He had even anticipated success so\nconfidently as to fix in the bulwarks of the sloop, on the day when he\nmeasured its proportions, two pairs of corresponding iron rings on each\nside, exactly at the same distances as the four rings on board the\nDurande, to which were attached the four chains of the funnel.\n\nHe had in his mind a very complete and settled plan. All the chances\nbeing against him, he had evidently determined that all the precautions\nat least should be on his side.\n\nHe did some things which seemed useless; a sign of attentive\npremeditation.\n\nHis manner of proceeding would, as we have said, have puzzled an\nobserver, even though familiar with mechanical operations.\n\nA witness of his labour who had seen him, for example, with enormous\nefforts, and at the risk of breaking his neck, driving with blows of his\nhammer eight or ten great nails which he had forged into the base of the\ntwo Douvres at the entrance of the defile between them, would have had\nsome difficulty in understanding the object of these nails, and would\nprobably have wondered what could be the use of all that trouble.\n\nIf he had then seen him measuring the portion of the fore bulwark which\nhad remained, as we have described it, hanging on by the wreck, then\nattaching a strong cable to the upper edge of that portion, cutting away\nwith strokes of his hatchet the dislocated fastenings which held it,\nthen dragging it out of the defile, pushing the lower part by the aid of\nthe receding tide, while he dragged the upper part; finally, by great\nlabour, fastening with the cable this heavy mass of planks and piles\nwider than the entrance of the defile itself, with the nails driven into\nthe base of the Little Douvre, the observer would perhaps have found it\nstill more difficult to comprehend, and might have wondered why\nGilliatt, if he wanted for the purpose of his operations to disencumber\nthe space between the two rocks of this mass, had not allowed it to fall\ninto the sea, where the tide would have carried it away.\n\nGilliatt had probably his reasons.\n\nIn fixing the nails in the basement of the rocks, he had taken advantage\nof all the cracks in the granite, enlarged them where needful, and\ndriven in first of all wedges of wood, in which he fixed the nails. He\nmade a rough commencement of similar preparations in the two rocks which\nrose at the other extremity of the narrow passage on the eastern side.\nHe furnished with plugs of wood all the crevices, as if he desired to\nkeep these also ready to hold nails or clamps; but this appeared to be\na simple precaution, for he did not use them further. He was compelled\nto economise, and only to use his materials as he had need, and at the\nmoment when the necessity for them came. This was another addition to\nhis numerous difficulties.\n\nAs fast as one labour was accomplished another became necessary.\nGilliatt passed without hesitation from task to task, and resolutely\naccomplished his giant strides.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nSUB RE\n\n\nThe aspect of the man who accomplished all these labours became\nterrible.\n\nGilliatt in his multifarious tasks expended all his strength at once,\nand regained it with difficulty.\n\nPrivations on the one hand, lassitude on the other, had much reduced\nhim. His hair and beard had grown long. He had but one shirt which was\nnot in rags. He went about bare-footed, the wind having carried away one\nof his shoes and the sea the other. Fractures of the rude and dangerous\nstone anvil which he used had left small wounds upon his hands and arms,\nthe marks of labour. These wounds, or rather scratches, were\nsuperficial; but the keen air and the salt sea irritated them\ncontinually.\n\nHe was generally hungry, thirsty, and cold.\n\nHis store of fresh water was gone; his rye-meal was used or eaten. He\nhad nothing left but a little biscuit.\n\nThis he broke with his teeth, having no water in which to steep it.\n\nBy little and little, and day by day, his powers decreased.\n\nThe terrible rocks were consuming his existence.\n\nHow to obtain food was a problem; how to get drink was a problem; how to\nfind rest was a problem.\n\nHe ate when he was fortunate enough to find a crayfish or a crab; he\ndrank when he chanced to see a sea-bird descend upon a point of rock;\nfor on climbing up to the spot he generally found there a hollow with a\nlittle fresh water. He drank from it after the bird; sometimes with the\nbird; for the gulls and seamews had become accustomed to him, and no\nlonger flew away at his approach. Even in his greatest need of food he\ndid not attempt to molest them. He had, as will be remembered, a\nsuperstition about birds. The birds on their part--now that his hair was\nrough and wild and his beard long--had no fear of him. The change in his\nface gave them confidence; he had lost resemblance to men, and taken the\nform of the wild beast.\n\nThe birds and Gilliatt, in fact, had become good friends. Companions in\npoverty, they helped each other. As long as he had had any meal, he had\ncrumbled for them some little bits of the cakes he made. In his deeper\ndistress they showed him in their turn the places where he might find\nthe little pools of water.\n\nHe ate the shell-fish raw. Shell-fish help in a certain degree to quench\nthe thirst. The crabs he cooked. Having no kettle, he roasted them\nbetween two stones made red-hot in his fire, after the manner of the\nsavages of the Feroe islands.\n\nMeanwhile signs of the equinoctial season had begun to appear. There\ncame rain--an angry rain. No showers or steady torrents, but fine,\nsharp, icy, penetrating points which pierced to his skin through his\nclothing, and to his bones through his skin. It was a rain which yielded\nlittle water for drinking, but which drenched him none the less.\n\nChary of assistance, prodigal of misery--such was the character of these\nrains. During one week Gilliatt suffered from them all day and all\nnight.\n\nAt night, in his rocky recess, nothing but the overpowering fatigue of\nhis daily work enabled him to get sleep. The great sea-gnats stung him,\nand he awakened covered with blisters.\n\nHe had a kind of low fever, which sustained him; this fever is a succour\nwhich destroys. By instinct he chewed the mosses, or sucked the leaves\nof wild cochlearia, scanty tufts of which grew in the dry crevices of\nthe rocks. Of his suffering, however, he took little heed. He had no\ntime to spare from his work to the consideration of his own privations.\nThe rescue of the machinery of the Durande was progressing well. That\nsufficed for him.\n\nEvery now and then, for the necessities of his work, he jumped into the\nwater, swam to some point, and gained a footing again. He simply plunged\ninto the sea and left it, as a man passes from one room in his dwelling\nto another.\n\nHis clothing was never dry. It was saturated with rain water, which had\nno time to evaporate, and with sea water, which never dries. He lived\nperpetually wet.\n\nLiving in wet clothing is a habit which may be acquired. The poor\ngroups of Irish people--old men, mothers, girls almost naked, and\ninfants--who pass the winter in the open air, under the snow and rain,\nhuddled together, sometimes at the corners of houses in the streets of\nLondon, live and die in this condition.\n\nTo be soaked with wet, and yet to be thirsty: Gilliatt grew familiar\nwith this strange torture. There were times when he was glad to suck the\nsleeve of his loose coat.\n\nThe fire which he made scarcely warmed him. A fire in open air yields\nlittle comfort. It burns on one side, and freezes on the other.\n\nGilliatt often shivered even while sweating over his forge.\n\nEverywhere about him rose resistance amidst a terrible silence. He felt\nhimself the enemy of an unseen combination. There is a dismal _non\npossumus_ in nature. The inertia of matter is like a sullen threat. A\nmysterious persecution environed him. He suffered from heats and\nshiverings. The fire ate into his flesh; the water froze him; feverish\nthirst tormented him; the wind tore his clothing; hunger undermined the\norgans of the body. The oppression of all these things was constantly\nexhausting him. Obstacles silent, immense, seemed to converge from all\npoints, with the blind irresponsibility of fate, yet full of a savage\nunanimity. He felt them pressing inexorably upon him. No means were\nthere of escaping from them. His sufferings produced the impression of\nsome living persecutor. He had a constant sense of something working\nagainst him, of a hostile form ever present, ever labouring to\ncircumvent and to subdue him. He could have fled from the struggle; but\nsince he remained, he had no choice but to war with this impenetrable\nhostility. He asked himself what it was. It took hold of him, grasped\nhim tightly, overpowered him, deprived him of breath. The invisible\npersecutor was destroying him by slow degrees. Every day the oppression\nbecame greater, as if a mysterious screw had received another turn.\n\nHis situation in this dreadful spot resembled a duel, in which a\nsuspicion of some treachery haunts the mind of one of the combatants.\n\nNow it seemed a coalition of obscure forces which surrounded him. He\nfelt that there was somewhere a determination to be rid of his presence.\nIt is thus that the glacier chases the loitering ice-block.\n\nAlmost without seeming to touch him this latent coalition had reduced\nhim to rags; had left him bleeding, distressed, and, as it were, _hors\nde combat_, even before the battle. He laboured, indeed, not the\nless--without pause or rest; but as the work advanced, the workman\nhimself lost ground. It might have been fancied that Nature, dreading\nhis bold spirit, adopted the plan of slowly undermining his bodily\npower. Gilliatt kept his ground, and left the rest to the future. The\nsea had begun by consuming him; what would come next?\n\nThe double Douvres--that dragon made of granite, and lying in ambush in\nmid-ocean--had sheltered him. It had allowed him to enter, and to do his\nwill; but its hospitality resembled the welcome of devouring jaws.\n\nThe desert, the boundless surface, the unfathomable space around him and\nabove, so full of negatives to man's will; the mute, inexorable\ndetermination of phenomena following their appointed course; the grand\ngeneral law of things, implacable and passive; the ebbs and flows; the\nrocks themselves, dark Pleiades whose points were each a star amid\nvortices, a centre of an irradiation of currents; the strange,\nindefinable conspiracy to stifle with indifference the temerity of a\nliving being; the wintry winds, the clouds, and the beleaguering waves\nenveloped him, closed round him slowly, and in a measure shut him in,\nand separated him from companionship, like a dungeon built up by degrees\nround a living man. All against him; nothing for him; he felt himself\nisolated, abandoned, enfeebled, sapped, forgotten. His storehouse empty,\nhis tools broken or defective; he was tormented with hunger and thirst\nby day, with cold by night. His sufferings had left him with wounds and\ntatters, rags covering sores, torn hands, bleeding feet, wasted limbs,\npallid cheeks, and eyes bright with a strange light; but this was the\nsteady flame of his determination.\n\nThe virtue of a man is betrayed by his eyes. How much of the man there\nis in us may be read in their depths. We make ourselves known by the\nlight that gleams beneath our brows. The petty natures wink at us, the\nlarger send forth flashes. If there is no brilliancy under the lids,\nthere is no thought in the brain, no love in the heart. Those who love\ndesire, and those who desire sparkle and flash. Determination gives a\nfire to the glance, a magnificent fire that consumes all timid thoughts.\n\nIt is the self-willed ones who are sublime. He who is only brave, has\nbut a passing fit, he who is only valiant has temperament and nothing\nmore, he who is courageous has but one virtue. He who persists in the\ntruth is the grand character. The secret of great hearts may be summed\nup in the word: Perseverando. Perseverance is to courage what the wheel\nis to the lever; it is the continual renewing of the centre of support.\nLet the desired goal be on earth or in heaven, only make for the goal.\nEverything is in that; in the first case one is a Columbus, in the\nsecond a god. Not to allow conscience to argue or the will to fail--this\nis the way to suffering and glory. In the world of ethics to fall does\nnot exclude the possibility of soaring, rather does it give impetus to\nflight. The mediocrities allow themselves to be dissuaded by the\nspecious obstacles--the great ones never. To perish is their perhaps, to\nconquer their conviction. You may propose many good reasons to the\nmartyr why he should not allow himself to be stoned to death. Disdain of\nevery reasonable objection begets that sublime victory of the vanquished\nwhich we call martyrdom.\n\nAll his efforts seemed to tend to the impossible. His success was\ntrifling and slow. He was compelled to expend much labour for very\nlittle results. This it was that gave to his struggle its noble and\npathetic character.\n\nThat it should have required so many preparations, so much toil, so many\ncautious experiments, such nights of hardship, and such days of danger,\nmerely to set up four beams over a shipwrecked vessel, to divide and\nisolate the portion that could be saved, and to adjust to that wreck\nwithin a wreck four tackle-blocks with their cables was only the result\nof his solitary labour. Fate had decreed him the work, and necessity\nobliged him to carry it out.\n\nThat solitary position Gilliatt had more than accepted; he had\ndeliberately chosen it. Dreading a competitor, because a competitor\nmight have proved a rival, he had sought for no assistance. The\noverwhelming enterprise, the risk, the danger, the toil multiplied by\nitself, the possible destruction of the salvor in his work, famine,\nfever, nakedness, distress--he had chosen all these for himself! Such\nwas his selfishness. He was like a man placed in some terrible chamber\nwhich is being slowly exhausted of air. His vitality was leaving him by\nlittle and little. He scarcely perceived it.\n\nExhaustion of the bodily strength does not necessarily exhaust the will.\nFaith is only a secondary power; the will is the first. The mountains,\nwhich faith is proverbially said to move, are nothing beside that which\nthe will can accomplish. All that Gilliatt lost in vigour, he gained in\ntenacity. The destruction of the physical man under the oppressive\ninfluence of that wild surrounding sea, and rock, and sky, seemed only\nto reinvigorate his moral nature.\n\nGilliatt felt no fatigue; or, rather, would not yield to any. The\nrefusal of the mind to recognise the failings of the body is in itself\nan immense power.\n\nHe saw nothing, except the steps in the progress of his labours.\n\nHis object--now seeming so near attainment--wrapped him in perpetual\nillusions.\n\nHe endured all this suffering without any other thought than is\ncomprised in the word \"Forward.\" His work flew to his head; the strength\nof the will is intoxicating. Its intoxication is called heroism.\n\nHe had become a kind of Job, having the ocean for the scene of his\nsufferings. But he was a Job wrestling with difficulty, a Job combating\nand making head against afflictions; a Job conquering! a combination of\nJob and Prometheus, if such names are not too great to be applied to a\npoor sailor and fisher of crabs and crayfish.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nSUB UMBRA\n\n\nSometimes in the night-time Gilliatt woke and peered into the darkness.\n\nHe felt a strange emotion.\n\nHis eyes were opened upon the black night; the situation was dismal;\nfull of disquietude.\n\nThere is such a thing as the pressure of darkness.\n\nA strange roof of shadow; a deep obscurity, which no diver can explore;\na light mingled with that obscurity, of a strange, subdued, and sombre\nkind; floating atoms of rays, like a dust of seeds or of ashes; millions\nof lamps, but no illumining; a vast sprinkling of fire, of which no man\nknows the secret; a diffusion of shining points, like a drift of sparks\narrested in their course; the disorder of the whirlwind, with the\nfixedness of death; a mysterious and abyssmal depth; an enigma, at once\nshowing and concealing its face; the Infinite in its mask of\ndarkness--these are the synonyms of night. Its weight lies heavily on\nthe soul of man.\n\nThis union of all mysteries--the mystery of the Cosmos and the mystery\nof Fate--oppresses human reason.\n\nThe pressure of darkness acts in inverse proportion upon different kinds\nof natures. In the presence of night man feels his own incompleteness.\nHe perceives the dark void and is sensible of infirmity. It is like the\nvacancy of blindness. Face to face with night, man bends, kneels,\nprostrates himself, crouches on the earth, crawls towards a cave, or\nseeks for wings. Almost always he shrinks from that vague presence of\nthe Infinite Unknown. He asks himself what it is; he trembles and bows\nthe head. Sometimes he desires to go to it.\n\nTo go whither?\n\nHe can only answer, \"Yonder.\"\n\nBut what is that? and what is there?\n\nThis curiosity is evidently forbidden to the spirit of man; for all\naround him the roads which bridge that gulf are broken up or gone. No\narch exists for him to span the Infinite. But there is attraction in\nforbidden knowledge, as in the edge of the abyss. Where the footstep\ncannot tread, the eye may reach; where the eye can penetrate no further,\nthe mind may soar. There is no man, however feeble or insufficient his\nresources, who does not essay. According to his nature he questions or\nrecoils before that mystery. With some it has the effect of repressing;\nwith others it enlarges the soul. The spectacle is sombre, indefinite.\n\nIs the night calm and cloudless? It is then a depth of shadow. Is it\nstormy? It is then a sea of cloud. Its limitless deeps reveal themselves\nto us, and yet baffle our gaze: close themselves against research, but\nopen to conjecture. Its innumerable dots of light only make deeper the\nobscurity beyond. Jewels, scintillations, stars; existences revealed in\nthe unknown universes; dread defiances to man's approach; landmarks of\nthe infinite creation; boundaries there, where there are no bounds;\nsea-marks impossible, and yet real, numbering the fathoms of those\ninfinite deeps. One microscopic glittering point; then another; then\nanother; imperceptible, yet enormous. Yonder light is a focus; that\nfocus is a star; that star is a sun; that sun is a universe; that\nuniverse is nothing. For all numbers are as zero in the presence of the\nInfinite.\n\nThese worlds, which yet are nothing, exist. Through this fact we feel\nthe difference which separates the _being nothing_ from the _not to be_.\n\nThe inaccessible joined to the inexplicable, such is the universe. From\nthe contemplation of the universe is evolved a sublime phenomenon: the\nsoul growing vast through its sense of wonder. A reverent fear is\npeculiar to man; the beasts know no such fear.\n\nHis intelligence becomes conscious in this august terror of its own\npower and its own weakness.\n\nDarkness has unity, hence arises horror; at the same time it is complex,\nand hence terror. Its unity weighs on the spirit and destroys all desire\nof resistance. Its complexity causes us to look around on all sides;\napparently we have reason to fear sudden happenings. We yield and yet\nare on guard. We are in presence of the whole, hence submission; and of\nthe many, hence defiance.\n\nThe unity of darkness contains a multiple, a mysterious\nplurality--visible in matter, realised in thought. Silence rules all;\nanother reason for watchfulness.\n\nNight--and he who writes this has said it elsewhere--is the right and\nnormal condition of that special part of creation to which we belong.\nLight, brief of duration here as throughout space, is but the nearness\nof a star. This universal, prodigious night does not fulfil itself,\nwithout friction, and all such friction in such a mechanism means what\nwe call evil. We feel this darkness to be evil, a latent denial of\ndivine order, the implicit blasphemy of the real rebelling against the\nideal. Evil complicates, by one knows not what hydra-headed monstrosity,\nthe vast, cosmic whole.\n\nEverywhere it arises and resists.\n\nIt is the tempest, and hinders the hastening ship; it is chaos, and\ntrammels the birth of a world. Good is one; evil is ubiquitous. Evil\ndislocates the logic of Life. It causes the bird to devour the fly and\nthe comet to destroy the planet. Evil is a blot on the page of creation.\n\nThe darkness of night is full of vertiginous uncertainty.\n\nWhoso would sound its depths is submerged, and struggles therein.\n\nWhat fatigue to be compared to this contemplation of shadows. It is the\nstudy of annihilation.\n\nThere is no sure hold on which the soul may rest. There are ports of\ndeparture, and no havens for arrival. The interlacing of contradictory\nsolutions; all the branches of doubt seen at a glance; the ramifications\nof phenomena budding limitlessly from some undefined impulse; laws\nintersecting each other; an incomprehensible promiscuity causing the\nmineral to become vegetable; the vegetable to rise to higher life;\nthought to gather weight; love to shine and gravitation to attract; the\nimmense range presented to view by all questions, extending itself into\nthe limitless obscurity; the half seen, suggesting the unknown; the\ncosmic correlation appearing clearly, not to sight but to intelligence,\nin the vast, dim space; the invisible become visible--these are the\ngreat overshadowing! Man lives beneath it. He is ignorant of detail, but\nhe carries, in such proportion as he is able to bear, the weight of the\nmonstrous whole. This obsession prompted the astronomy of the Chaldean\nshepherds. Involuntary revelations flow from creation; hints of science\nfall from it unconsciously and are absorbed by the ignorant. Every\nsolitary, impregnated in this mysterious way, becomes, without being\naware of it, a natural philosopher.\n\nThe darkness is indivisible. It is inhabited. Inhabited by the\nchangeless absolute; inhabited also by change. Action exists there,\ndisquieting thought! An awful creative will works out its phases.\nPremeditations, Powers, fore-ordained Destinies, elaborate there\ntogether an incommensurable work. A life of horror and terror is hidden\ntherein. There are vast evolutions of suns; the stellar family, the\nplanetary family; zodiacal pollen; the _Quid Divinum_ of currents;\neffluvia, polarisations, and attractions; there are embraces and\nantagonisms; a magnificent flux and reflux of universal antithesis; the\nimponderable, free-floating around fixed centres; there is the sap of\nglobes and light beyond globes; the wandering atom, the scattered germ,\nthe processes of fecundity, meetings for union and for combat;\nunimagined profusion, distances which are as a dream, vertiginous\norbits, the rush of worlds into the incalculable; marvels following each\nother in the obscurity. One mechanism works throughout in the breath of\nfleeing spheres, and the wheels that we know are turning. The sage\nconjectures; the ignorant man believes and trembles. These things exist\nand yet are hidden; they are inexpugnable, beyond reach, beyond\napproach.\n\nWe are convinced and oppressed--we feel, we know not what dark evidence\nwithin us; we realise nothing, but are crushed by the impalpable.\n\nAll is incomprehensible, but nothing is unintelligible.\n\nAnd add to all that, the tremendous question: Is this immanent universe\na Being?\n\nWe exist beneath the shadow. We look; we listen. And meanwhile the dark\nearth rolls onward. The flowers are conscious of this tremendous motion;\nthe one opens at eleven in the evening and the other at five in the\nmorning. Astounding sense of law! And in other depths of wonder, the\ndrop of water is a world; the infusoria breed; animalcul\u00c3\u00a6 display\ngigantic fecundity, the imperceptible reveals its grandeur, immensity\nmanifests itself, in an inverse sense; there are alg\u00c3\u00a6 that produce in an\nhour thirteen hundred millions of their kind. Every enigma is propounded\nin one. The irreducible is before us. Hence we are constrained to some\nkind of faith. An involuntary belief is the result. But belief does not\nensure peace of mind. Faith has an extraordinary desire to take shape.\nHence religions. Nothing is so overwhelming as a formless faith.\n\nAnd despite of thought or desire or inward resistance, to look at the\ndarkness is to fall into profound and wondering meditation. What can we\nmake of these phenomena! How should we act beneath their united forces?\nTo divide such weight of oppression is impossible. What reverie can\nfollow all these mystic vistas? What abstruse revelations arise,\nstammering, and are obscure from their very mass, as a hesitating\nspeech. Darkness is silence, but such a silence suggests everything. One\nmajestic thought is the result: God--God is the irrepressible idea that\nsprings within man's soul. Syllogisms, feuds, negations, systems,\nreligions cannot destroy it. This idea is affirmed by the whole dark\nuniverse. Yet unrest is everywhere in fearful immanence. The wondrous\ncorrelation of forces is manifested in the upholding of the balanced\ndarkness. The universe is suspended and nothing falls. Incessant and\nimmeasurable changes operate without accident or destruction. Man\nparticipates in the constant changes, and in experiencing such he names\nthem Destiny. But where does destiny begin? And where does nature end?\nWhat difference is there between an event and a season? between a sorrow\nand a rainfall? between a virtue and a star? An hour, is it not a\nrolling wave? The wheels of creation revolve mechanically regardless of\nman. The starry sky is a vision of wheels, pendulums, and counterpoise.\n\nHe who contemplates it cannot but ponder upon it.\n\nIt is the whole reality and yet the whole abstraction. And nothing more.\nWe are in prison and at the mercy of the darkness, and no evasion is\npossible.\n\nWe are an integral part of the working of this unknown whole; and we\nfeel the mystery within us fraternising with the mystery beyond us.\nHence the sublimity of Death. What anguish! And yet what bliss to\nbelong to the Infinite, and through the sense of the Infinite to\nrecognise our inevitable immortality, the possibility of an eternity; to\ngrasp amid this prodigious deluge of universal life, the persistent,\nimperishable _Me_; to look at the stars and say, The living soul within\nme is akin to you; to gaze into darkness and cry, I am as unfathomable\nas thou! Such immensity is of night, and, added to solitude, weighed\nheavily on Gilliatt's mind.\n\nDid he understand it? No.\n\nDid he feel it? Yes.\n\nAll these vague imaginings, increased and intensified by solitude,\nweighed upon Gilliatt.\n\nHe understood them little, but he felt them. His was a powerful\nintellect clouded; a great spirit wild and untaught.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nGILLIATT PLACES THE SLOOP IN READINESS\n\n\nThis rescue of the machinery of the wreck as meditated by Gilliatt was,\nas we have already said, like the escape of a criminal from a\nprison--necessitating all the patience and industry recorded of such\nachievements; industry carried to the point of a miracle, patience only\nto be compared with a long agony. A certain prisoner named Thomas, at\nthe Mont Saint Michel, found means of secreting the greater part of a\nwall in his paillasse. Another at Tulle, in 1820, cut away a quantity of\nlead from the terrace where the prisoners walked for exercise. With what\nkind of knife? No one would guess. And melted this lead with what fire?\nNone have ever discovered; but it is known that he cast it in a mould\nmade of the crumbs of bread. With this lead and this mould he made a\nkey, and with this key succeeded in opening a lock of which he had never\nseen anything but the keyhole. Some of this marvellous ingenuity\nGilliatt possessed. He had once climbed and descended from the cliff at\nBoisros\u00c3\u00a9. He was the Baron Trenck of the wreck, and the Latude of her\nmachinery.\n\nThe sea, like a jailor, kept watch over him.\n\nFor the rest, mischievous and inclement as the rain had been, he had\ncontrived to derive some benefit from it. He had in part replenished his\nstock of fresh water; but his thirst was inextinguishable, and he\nemptied his can as fast as he filled it.\n\nOne day--it was on the last day of April or the first of May--all was at\nlength ready for his purpose.\n\nThe engine-room was, as it were, enclosed between the eight cables\nhanging from the tackle-blocks, four on one side, four on the other. The\nsixteen holes upon the deck and under the keel, through which the cables\npassed, had been hooped round by sawing. The planking had been sawed,\nthe timber cut with the hatchet, the ironwork with a file, the sheathing\nwith the chisel. The part of the keel immediately under the machinery\nwas cut squarewise, and ready to descend with it while still supporting\nit. All this frightful swinging mass was held only by one chain, which\nwas itself only kept in position by a filed notch. At this stage, in\nsuch a labour and so near its completion, haste is prudence.\n\nThe water was low; the moment favourable.\n\nGilliatt had succeeded in removing the axle of the paddles, the\nextremities of which might have proved an obstacle and checked the\ndescent. He had contrived to make this heavy portion fast in a vertical\nposition within the engine-room itself.\n\nIt was time to bring his work to an end. The workman, as we have said,\nwas not weary, for his will was strong; but his tools were. The forge\nwas by degrees becoming impracticable. The blower had begun to work\nbadly. The little hydraulic fall being of sea-water, saline deposits had\nencrusted the joints of the apparatus, and prevented its free action.\n\nGilliatt visited the creek of \"The Man Rock,\" examined the sloop, and\nassured himself that all was in good condition, particularly the four\nrings fixed to starboard and to larboard; then he weighed anchor, and\nworked the heavy barge-shaped craft with the oars till he brought it\nalongside the two Douvres. The defile between the rocks was wide enough\nto admit it. There was also depth enough. On the day of his arrival he\nhad satisfied himself that it was possible to push the sloop under the\nDurande.\n\nThe feat, however, was difficult; it required the minute precision of a\nwatchmaker. The operation was all the more delicate from the fact that,\nfor his objects, he was compelled to force it in by the stern, rudder\nfirst. It was necessary that the mast and the ringing of the sloop\nshould project beyond the wreck in the direction of the sea.\n\nThese embarrassments rendered all Gilliatt's operations awkward. It was\nnot like entering the creek of \"The Man,\" where it was a mere affair of\nthe tiller. It was necessary here to push, drag, row, and take\nsoundings all together. Gilliatt consumed but a quarter of an hour in\nthese manoeuvres; but he was successful.\n\nIn fifteen or twenty minutes the sloop was adjusted under the wreck. It\nwas almost wedged in there. By means of his two anchors he moored the\nboat by head and stern. The strongest of the two was placed so as to be\nefficient against the strongest wind that blows, which was that from the\nsouth-west. Then by the aid of a lever and the capstan, he lowered into\nthe sloop the two cases containing the pieces of the paddle-wheel, the\nslings of which were all ready. The two cases served as ballast.\n\nRelieved of these encumbrances, he fastened to the hook of the chain of\nthe capstan the sling of the regulating tackle-gear, intending to check\nthe pulleys.\n\nOwing to the peculiar objects of this labour, the defects of the old\nsloop became useful qualities. It had no deck; her burden therefore\nwould have greater depth, and could rest upon the hold. Her mast was\nvery forward--too far forward indeed for general purposes; her contents\ntherefore would have more room, and the mast standing thus beyond the\nmass of the wreck, there would be nothing to hinder its disembarkation.\nIt was a mere shell, or case for receiving it; but nothing is more\nstable than this on the sea.\n\nWhile engaged in these operations, Gilliatt suddenly perceived that the\nsea was rising. He looked around to see from what quarter the wind was\ncoming.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nSUDDEN DANGER\n\n\nThe breeze was scarcely perceptible; but what there was came from the\nwest. A disagreeable habit of the winds during the equinoxes.\n\nThe rising sea varies much in its effects upon the Douvres rocks,\ndepending upon the quarter of the wind.\n\nAccording to the gale which drives them before it, the waves enter the\nrocky corridor either from the east or from the west. Entering from the\neast, the sea is comparatively gentle; coming from the west, it is\nalways furious. The reason of this is, that the wind from the east\nblowing from the land has not had time to gather force; while the\nwesterly winds, coming from the Atlantic, blow unchecked from a vast\nocean. Even a very slight breeze, if it comes from the west, is serious.\nIt rolls the huge billows from the illimitable space and dashes the\nwaves against the narrow defile in greater bulk than can find entrance\nthere.\n\nA sea which rolls into a gulf is always terrible. It is the same with a\ncrowd of people: a multitude is a sort of fluid body. When the quantity\nwhich can enter is less than the quantity endeavouring to force a way,\nthere is a fatal crush among the crowd, a fierce convulsion on the\nwater. As long as the west wind blows, however slight the breeze, the\nDouvres are twice a day subjected to that rude assault. The sea rises,\nthe tide breasts up, the narrow gullet gives little entrance, the waves,\ndriven against it violently, rebound and roar, and a tremendous surf\nbeats the two sides of the gorge. Thus the Douvres, during the slightest\nwind from the west, present the singular spectacle of a sea\ncomparatively calm without, while within the rocks a storm is raging.\nThis tumult of waters, altogether confined and circumscribed, has\nnothing of the character of a tempest. It is a mere local outbreak among\nthe waves, but a terrible one. As regards the winds from the north and\nsouth, they strike the rocks crosswise, and cause little surf in the\npassage. The entrance by the east, a fact which must be borne in mind,\nwas close to \"The Man Rock.\" The dangerous opening to the west was at\nthe opposite extremity, exactly between the two Douvres.\n\nIt was at this western entrance that Gilliatt found himself with the\nwrecked Durande, and the sloop made fast beneath it.\n\nA catastrophe seemed inevitable. There was not much wind, but it was\nsufficient for the impending mischief.\n\nBefore many hours, the swell which was rising would be rushing with full\nforce into the gorge of the Douvres. The first waves were already\nbreaking. This swell, and eddy of the entire Atlantic, would have behind\nit the immense sea. There would be no squall; no violence, but a simple\noverwhelming wave, which commencing on the coasts of America, rolls\ntowards the shores of Europe with an impetus gathered over two thousand\nleagues. This wave, a gigantic ocean barrier, meeting the gap of the\nrocks, must be caught between the two Douvres, standing like\nwatch-towers at the entrance, or like pillars of the defile. Thus\nswelled by the tide, augmented by resistance, driven back by the shoals,\nand urged on by the wind, it would strike the rock with violence, and\nwith all the contortions from the obstacles it had encountered, and all\nthe frenzy of a sea confined in limits, would rush between the rocky\nwalls, where it would reach the sloop and the Durande, and, in all\nprobability, destroy them.\n\nA shield against this danger was wanting. Gilliatt had one.\n\nThe problem was to prevent the sea reaching it at one bound; to obstruct\nit from striking, while allowing it to rise; to bar the passage without\nrefusing it admission; to prevent the compression of the water in the\ngorge, which was the whole danger; to turn an eruption into a simple\nflood; to extract as it were from the waves all their violence, and\nconstrain the furies to be gentle; it was, in fact, to substitute an\nobstacle which will appease, for an obstacle which irritates.\n\nGilliatt, with all that dexterity which he possessed, and which is so\nmuch more efficient than mere force, sprang upon the rocks like a\nchamois among the mountains or a monkey in the forest; using for his\ntottering and dizzy strides the smallest projecting stone; leaping into\nthe water, and issuing from it again; swimming among the shoals and\nclambering the rocks, with a rope between his teeth and a mallet in his\nhand. Thus he detached the cable which kept suspended and also fast to\nthe basement of the Little Douvre the end of the forward side of the\nDurande; fashioned out of some ends of hawsers a sort of hinges, holding\nthis bulwark to the huge nails fixed in the granite; swung this\napparatus of planks upon them, like the gates of a great dock, and\nturned their sides, as he would turn a rudder, outward to the waves,\nwhich pushed the extremities upon the Great Douvre, while the rope\nhinges detained the other extremities upon the Little Douvre; next he\ncontrived, by means of the huge nails placed beforehand for the purpose,\nto fix the same kind of fastenings upon the Great Douvre as on the\nlittle one; made completely fast the vast mass of woodwork against the\ntwo pillars of the gorge, slung a chain across this barrier like a\nbaldric upon a cuirass; and in less than an hour, this barricade against\nthe sea was complete and the gullet of the rocks closed as by a\nfolding-door.\n\nThis powerful apparatus, a heavy mass of beams and planks, which laid\nflat would have made a raft, and upright formed a wall, had by the aid\nof the water been handled by Gilliatt with the adroitness of a juggler.\nIt might almost have been said that the obstruction was complete before\nthe rising sea had the time to perceive it.\n\nIt was one of those occasions on which Jean Bart would have employed the\nfamous expression which he applied to the sea every time he narrowly\nescaped shipwreck. \"We have cheated the Englishman;\" for it is well\nknown that when that famous admiral meant to speak contemptuously of the\nocean he called it \"the Englishman.\"\n\nThe entrance to the defile being thus protected, Gilliatt thought of the\nsloop. He loosened sufficient cable for the two anchors to allow her to\nrise with the tide; an operation similar to what the mariners of old\ncalled \"_mouiller avec des embossures_.\" In all this, Gilliatt was not\ntaken the least by surprise; the necessity had been foreseen. A seaman\nwould have perceived it by the two pulleys of the top ropes cut in the\nform of snatch-blocks, and fixed behind the sloop, through which passed\ntwo ropes, the ends of which were slung through the rings of the\nanchors.\n\nMeanwhile the tide was rising fast; the half flood had arrived, a moment\nwhen the shock of the waves, even in comparatively moderate weather, may\nbecome considerable. Exactly what Gilliatt expected came to pass. The\nwaves rolled violently against the barrier, struck it, broke heavily and\npassed beneath. Outside was the heavy swell; within, the waters ran\nquietly. He had devised a sort of marine _Furcul\u00c3\u00a6 caudin\u00c3\u00a6_. The sea was\nconquered.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMOVEMENT RATHER THAN PROGRESS\n\n\nThe moment so long dreaded had come.\n\nThe problem now was to place the machinery in the bark.\n\nGilliatt remained thoughtful for some moments, holding the elbow of his\nleft arm in his right hand, and applying his left hand to his forehead.\n\nThen he climbed upon the wreck, one part of which, containing the\nengine, was to be parted from it, while the other remained.\n\nHe severed the four slings which fixed the four chains from the funnel\non the larboard and the starboard sides. The slings being only of cord,\nhis knife served him well enough for this purpose.\n\nThe four chains set free, hung down along the sides of the funnel.\n\nFrom the wreck he climbed up to the apparatus which he had constructed,\nstamped with his feet upon the beams, inspected the tackle-blocks,\nlooked to the pulleys, handled the cables, examined the eking-pieces,\nassured himself that the untarred hemp was not saturated through, found\nthat nothing was wanting and nothing giving way; then springing from the\nheight of the suspending props on to the deck, he took up his position\nnear the capstan, in the part of the Durande which he intended to leave\njammed in between the two Douvres. This was to be his post during his\nlabours.\n\nEarnest, but troubled with no impulses but what were useful to his work,\nhe took a final glance at the hoisting-tackle, then seized a file and\nbegan to saw with it through the chain which held the whole suspended.\n\nThe rasping of the file was audible amidst the roaring of the sea.\n\nThe chain from the capstan, attached to the regulating gear, was within\nhis reach, quite near his hand.\n\nSuddenly there was a crash. The link which he was filing snapped when\nonly half cut through: the whole apparatus swung violently. He had only\njust time sufficient to seize the regulating gear.\n\nThe severed chain beat against the rock; the eight cables strained; the\nhuge mass, sawed and cut through, detached itself from the wreck; the\nbelly of the hull opened, and the iron flooring of the engine-room was\nvisible below the keel.\n\nIf he had not seized the regulating tackle at that instant it would have\nfallen. But his powerful hand was there, and it descended steadily.\n\nWhen the brother of Jean Bart, Peter Bart, that powerful and sagacious\ntoper, that poor Dunkirk fisherman, who used to talk familiarly with the\nGrand Admiral of France, went to the rescue of the galley _Langeron_, in\ndistress in the Bay of Ambleteuse, endeavouring to save the heavy\nfloating mass in the midst of the breakers of that furious bay, he\nrolled up the mainsail, tied it with sea-reeds, and trusted to the ties\nto break away of themselves, and give the sail to the wind at the right\nmoment. Just so Gilliatt trusted to the breaking of the chain; and the\nsame eccentric feat of daring was crowned with the same success.\n\nThe tackle, taken in hand by Gilliatt, held out and worked well. Its\nfunction, as will be remembered, was to moderate the powers of the\napparatus, thus reduced from many to one, by bringing them into united\naction. The gear had some similarity to a bridle of a bowline, except\nthat instead of trimming a sail it served to balance a complicated\nmechanism.\n\nErect, and with his hand upon the capstan, Gilliatt, so to speak, was\nenabled to feel the pulse of the apparatus.\n\nIt was here that his inventive genius manifested itself.\n\nA remarkable coincidence of forces was the result.\n\nWhile the machinery of the Durande, detached in a mass, was lowering to\nthe sloop, the sloop rose slowly to receive it. The wreck and the\nsalvage vessel assisting each other in opposite ways, saved half the\nlabour of the operation.\n\nThe tide swelling quietly between the two Douvres raised the sloop and\nbrought it nearer to the Durande. The sea was more than conquered; it\nwas tamed and broken in. It became, in fact, part and parcel of the\norganisation of power.\n\nThe rising waters lifted the vessel without any sort of shock, gently,\nand almost with precaution, as one would handle porcelain.\n\nGilliatt combined and proportioned the two labours, that of the water\nand that of the apparatus; and standing steadfast at the capstan, like\nsome terrible statue obeyed by all the movement around it at the same\nmoment, regulated the slowness of the descent by the slow rise of the\nsea.\n\nThere was no jerk given by the waters, no slip among the tackle. It was\na strange collaboration of all the natural forces subdued. On one side,\ngravitation lowering the huge bulk, on the other the sea raising the\nbark. The attraction of heavenly bodies which causes the tide, and the\nattractive force of the earth, which men call weight, seemed to conspire\ntogether to aid his plans. There was no hesitation, no stoppage in their\nservice; under the dominance of mind these passive forces became active\nauxiliaries. From minute to minute the work advanced; the interval\nbetween the wreck and the sloop diminished insensibly. The approach\ncontinued in silence, and as in a sort of terror of the man who stood\nthere. The elements received his orders and fulfilled them.\n\nNearly at the moment when the tide ceased to raise it, the cable ceased\nto slide. Suddenly, but without commotion, the pulleys stopped. The vast\nmachine had taken its place in the bark, as if placed there by a\npowerful hand. It stood straight, upright, motionless, firm. The iron\nfloor of the engine-room rested with its four corners evenly upon the\nhold.\n\nThe work was accomplished.\n\nGilliatt contemplated it, lost in thought.\n\nHe was not the spoiled child of success. He bent under the weight of his\ngreat joy. He felt his limbs, as it were, sinking; and contemplating\nhis triumph, he, who had never been shaken by danger, began to tremble.\n\nHe gazed upon the sloop under the wreck and at the machinery in the\nsloop. He seemed to feel it hard to believe it true. It might have been\nsupposed that he had never looked forward to that which he had\naccomplished. A miracle had been wrought by his hands, and he\ncontemplated it in bewilderment.\n\nHis reverie lasted but a short time.\n\nStarting like one awakening from a deep sleep, he seized his saw, cut\nthe eight cables, separated now from the sloop, thanks to the rising of\nthe tide, by only about ten feet; sprang aboard, took a bunch of cord,\nmade four slings, passed them through the rings prepared beforehand, and\nfixed on both sides aboard the sloop the four chains of the funnel which\nonly an hour before had been still fastened to their places aboard the\nDurande.\n\nThe funnel being secured, he disengaged the upper part of the machinery.\nA square portion of the planking of the Durande was adhering to it; he\nstruck off the nails and relieved the sloop of this encumbrance of\nplanks and beams; which fell over on to the rocks--a great assistance in\nlightening it.\n\nFor the rest, the sloop, as has been foreseen, behaved well under the\nburden of the machinery. It had sunk in the water, but only to a good\nwater-line. Although massive, the engine of the Durande was less heavy\nthan the pile of stones and the cannon which he had once brought back\nfrom Herm in the sloop.\n\nAll then was ended; he had only to depart.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nA SLIP BETWEEN CUP AND LIP\n\n\nAll was not ended.\n\nTo re-open the gorge thus closed by the portion of the Durande's\nbulwarks, and at once to push out with the sloop beyond the rocks,\nnothing could appear more clear and simple. On the ocean every minute is\nurgent. There was little wind; scarcely a wrinkle on the open sea. The\nafternoon was beautiful, and promised a fine night. The sea, indeed, was\ncalm, but the ebb had begun. The moment was favourable for starting.\nThere would be the ebb-tide for leaving the Douvres; and the flood\nwould carry him into Guernsey. It would be possible to be at St.\nSampson's at daybreak.\n\nBut an unexpected obstacle presented itself. There was a flaw in his\narrangements which had baffled all his foresight.\n\nThe machinery was freed; but the chimney was not.\n\nThe tide, by raising the sloop to the wreck suspended in the air, had\ndiminished the dangers of the descent, and abridged the labour. But this\ndiminution of the interval had left the top of the funnel entangled in\nthe kind of gaping frame formed by the open hull of the Durande. The\nfunnel was held fast there as between four walls.\n\nThe services rendered by the sea had been accompanied by that\nunfortunate drawback. It seemed as if the waves, constrained to obey,\nhad avenged themselves by a malicious trick.\n\nIt is true that what the flood-tide had done, the ebb would undo.\n\nThe funnel, which was rather more than three fathoms in height, was\nburied more than eight feet in the wreck. The water-level would fall\nabout twelve feet. Thus the funnel descending with the falling tide\nwould have four feet of room to spare, and would clear itself easily.\n\nBut how much time would elapse before that release would be completed?\nSix hours.\n\nIn six hours it would be near midnight. What means would there be of\nattempting to start at such an hour? What channel could he find among\nall those breakers, so full of dangers even by day? How was he to risk\nhis vessel in the depth of black night in that inextricable labyrinth,\nthat ambuscade of shoals?\n\nThere was not help for it. He must wait for the morrow. These six hours\nlost, entailed a loss of twelve hours at least.\n\nHe could not even advance the labour by opening the mouth of the gorge.\nHis breakwater was necessary against the next tide.\n\nHe was compelled to rest. Folding his arms was almost the only thing\nwhich he had not yet done since his arrival on the rocks.\n\nThis forced inaction irritated, almost vexed him with himself, as if it\nhad been his fault. He thought \"what would D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette say of me if she\nsaw me thus doing nothing?\"\n\nAnd yet this interval for regaining his strength was not unnecessary.\n\nThe sloop was now at his command; he determined to pass the night in\nit.\n\nHe mounted once more to fetch his sheepskin upon the Great Douvre;\ndescended again, supped off a few limpets and _ch\u00c3\u00a2taignes de mer_,\ndrank, being very thirsty, a few draughts of water from his can, which\nwas nearly empty, enveloped himself in the skin, the wool of which felt\ncomforting, lay down like a watch-dog beside the engine, drew his red\ncap over his eyes and slept.\n\nHis sleep was profound. It was such sleep as men enjoy who have\ncompleted a great labour.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nSEA-WARNINGS\n\n\nIn the middle of the night he awoke suddenly and with a jerk like the\nrecoil of a spring.\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nThe Douvres, rising high over his head, were lighted up as by the white\nglow of burning embers. Over all the dark escarpment of the rock there\nwas a light like the reflection of a fire.\n\nWhere could this fire come from?\n\nIt was from the water.\n\nThe aspect of the sea was extraordinary.\n\nThe water seemed a-fire. As far as the eye could reach, among the reefs\nand beyond them, the sea ran with flame. The flame was not red; it had\nnothing in common with the grand living fires of volcanic craters or of\ngreat furnaces. There was no sparkling, no glare, no purple edges, no\nnoise. Long trails of a pale tint simulated upon the water the folds of\na winding-sheet. A trembling glow was spread over the waves. It was the\nspectre of a great fire, rather than the fire itself. It was in some\ndegree like the glow of unearthly flames lighting the inside of a\nsepulchre. A burning darkness.\n\nThe night itself, dim, vast, and wide-diffused, was the fuel of that\ncold flame. It was a strange illumination issuing out of blindness. The\nshadows even formed part of that phantom-fire.\n\nThe sailors of the Channel are familiar with those indescribable\nphosphorescences, full of warning for the navigator. They are nowhere\nmore surprising than in the \"Great V,\" near Isigny.\n\nBy this light, surrounding objects lose their reality. A spectral\nglimmer renders them, as it were, transparent. Rocks become no more\nthan outlines. Cables of anchors look like iron bars heated to a white\nheat. The nets of the fishermen beneath the water seem webs of fire. The\nhalf of the oar above the waves is dark as ebony, the rest in the sea\nlike silver. The drops from the blades uplifted from the water fall in\nstarry showers upon the sea. Every boat leaves a furrow behind it like a\ncomet's tail. The sailors, wet and luminous, seem like men in flames. If\nyou plunge a hand into the water, you withdraw it clothed in flame. The\nflame is dead, and is not felt. Your arm becomes a firebrand. You see\nthe forms of things in the sea roll beneath the waves as in liquid fire.\nThe foam twinkles. The fish are tongues of fire, or fragments of the\nforked lightning, moving in the depths.\n\nThe reflection of this brightness had passed over the closed eyelids of\nGilliatt in the sloop. It was this that had awakened him.\n\nHis awakening was opportune.\n\nThe ebb tide had run out, and the waters were beginning to rise again.\nThe funnel, which had become disengaged during his sleep, was about to\nenter again into the yawning hollow above it.\n\nIt was rising slowly.\n\nA rise of another foot would have entangled it in the wreck again. A\nrise of one foot is equivalent to half-an-hour's tide. If he intended,\ntherefore, to take advantage of that temporary deliverance once more\nwithin his reach, he had just half-an-hour before him.\n\nHe leaped to his feet.\n\nUrgent as the situation was, he stood for a few moments meditative,\ncontemplating the phosphorescence of the waves.\n\nGilliatt knew the sea in all its phases. Notwithstanding all her tricks,\nand often as he had suffered from her terrors, he had long been her\ncompanion. That mysterious entity which we call the ocean had nothing in\nits secret thoughts which he could not divine. Observation, meditation,\nand solitude, had given him a quick perception of coming changes, of\nwind, or cloud, or wave.\n\nGilliatt hastened to the top ropes and payed out some cable; then being\nno longer held fast by the anchors, he seized the boat-hook of the\nsloop, and pushed her towards the entrance to the gorge some fathoms\nfrom the Durande, and quite near to the breakwater. Here, as the\nGuernsey sailors say, it had _du rang_. In less than ten minutes the\nsloop was withdrawn from beneath the carcase of the wreck. There was no\nfurther danger of the funnel being caught in a trap. The tide might rise\nnow.\n\nAnd yet Gilliatt's manner was not that of one about to take his\ndeparture.\n\nHe stood considering the light upon the sea once more; but his thoughts\nwere not of starting. He was thinking of how to fix the sloop again, and\nhow to fix it more firmly than ever, though near to the exit from the\ndefile.\n\nUp to this time he had only used the two anchors of the sloop and had\nnot yet employed the little anchor of the Durande, which he had found,\nas will be remembered, among the breakers. This anchor had been\ndeposited by him in readiness for any emergency, in a corner of the\nsloop, with a quantity of hawsers, and blocks of top-ropes, and his\ncable, all furnished beforehand with large knots, which prevented its\ndragging. He now let go this third anchor, taking care to fasten the\ncable to a rope, one end of which was slung through the anchor ring,\nwhile the other was attached to the windlass of the sloop. In this\nmanner he made a kind of triangular, triple anchorage, much stronger\nthan the moorings with two anchors. All this indicated keen anxiety, and\na redoubling of precautions. A sailor would have seen in this operation\nsomething similar to an anchorage in bad weather, when there is fear of\na current which might carry the vessel under the wind.\n\nThe phosphorescence which he had been observing, and upon which his eye\nwas now fixed once more, was threatening, but serviceable at the same\ntime. But for it he would have been held fast locked in sleep, and\ndeceived by the night. The strange appearance upon the sea had awakened\nhim, and made things about him visible.\n\nThe light which it shed among the rocks was, indeed, ominous; but\ndisquieting as it appeared to be to Gilliatt, it had served to show him\nthe dangers of his position, and had rendered possible his operations in\nextricating the sloop. Henceforth, whenever he should be able to set\nsail, the vessel, with its freight of machinery, would be free.\n\nAnd yet the idea of departing was further than ever from his mind. The\nsloop being fixed in its new position, he went in quest of the strongest\nchain which he had in his store-cavern, and attaching it to the nails\ndriven into the two Douvres, he fortified from within with this chain\nthe rampart of planks and beams, already protected from without by the\ncross chain. Far from opening the entrance to the defile, he made the\nbarrier more complete.\n\nThe phosphorescence lighted him still, but it was diminishing. The day,\nhowever, was beginning to break.\n\nSuddenly he paused to listen.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nA WORD TO THE WISE IS ENOUGH\n\n\nA feeble, indistinct sound seemed to reach his ear from somewhere in the\nfar distance.\n\nAt certain hours the great deeps give forth a murmuring noise.\n\nHe listened a second time. The distant noise recommenced. Gilliatt shook\nhis head like one who recognises at last something familiar to him.\n\nA few minutes later he was at the other extremity of the alley between\nthe rocks, at the entrance facing the east, which had remained open\nuntil then, and by heavy blows of his hammer was driving large nails\ninto the sides of the gullet near \"The Man Rock,\" as he had done at the\ngullet of the Douvres.\n\nThe crevices of these rocks were prepared and well furnished with\ntimber, almost all of which was heart of oak. The rock on this side\nbeing much broken up, there were abundant cracks, and he was able to fix\neven more nails there than in the base of the two Douvres.\n\nSuddenly, and as if some great breath had passed over it, the luminous\nappearance on the waters vanished. The twilight becoming paler every\nmoment, assumed its functions.\n\nThe nails being driven, Gilliatt dragged beams and cords, and then\nchains to the spot; and without taking his eyes off his work, or\npermitting his mind to be diverted for a moment, he began to construct\nacross the gorge of \"The Man\" with beams fixed horizontally, and made\nfast by cables, one of those open barriers which science has now adopted\nunder the name of breakwaters.\n\nThose who have witnessed, for example, at La Rocquaine in Guernsey, or\nat Bourg-d'Eau in France, the effect produced by a few posts fixed in\nthe rock, will understand the power of these simple preparations. This\nsort of breakwater is a combination of what is called in France _\u00c3\u00a9pi_\nwith what is known in England as \"a dam.\" The breakwater is the\nchevaux-de-frise of fortifications against tempests. Man can only\nstruggle against the sea by taking advantage of this principle of\ndividing its forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the sun had risen, and was shining brightly. The sky was\nclear, the sea calm.\n\nGilliatt pressed on his work. He, too, was calm; but there was anxiety\nin his haste. He passed with long strides from rock to rock, and\nreturned dragging wildly sometimes a rider, sometimes a binding strake.\nThe utility of all this preparation of timbers now became manifest. It\nwas evident that he was about to confront a danger which he had\nforeseen.\n\nA strong iron bar served him as a lever for moving the beams.\n\nThe work was executed so fast that it was rather a rapid growth than a\nconstruction. He who has never seen a military pontooner at his work can\nscarcely form an idea of this rapidity.\n\nThe eastern gullet was still narrower than the western. There were but\nfive or six feet of interval between the rocks. The smallness of this\nopening was an assistance. The space to be fortified and closed up being\nvery little, the apparatus would be stronger, and might be more simple.\nHorizontal beams, therefore, sufficed, the upright ones being useless.\n\nThe first cross pieces of the breakwater being fixed, Gilliatt mounted\nupon them and listened once more.\n\nThe murmurs had become significant.\n\nHe continued his construction. He supported it with the two cat-heads of\nthe Durande, bound to the frame of beams by cords passed through the\nthree pulley-sheaves. He made the whole fast by chains.\n\nThe construction was little more than a colossal hurdle, having beams\nfor rods and chains in the place of wattles.\n\nIt seemed woven together, quite as much as built.\n\nHe multiplied the fastenings, and added nails where they were necessary.\n\nHaving obtained a great quantity of bar iron from the wreck, he had been\nable to make a large number of these heavy nails.\n\nWhile still at work, he broke some biscuit with his teeth. He was\nthirsty, but he could not drink, having no more fresh water. He had\nemptied the can at his meal of the evening before.\n\nHe added afterwards four or five more pieces of timber; then climbed\nagain upon the barrier and listened.\n\nThe noises from the horizon had ceased; all was still.\n\nThe sea was smooth and quiet; deserving all those complimentary phrases\nwhich worthy citizens bestow upon it when satisfied with a trip. \"A\nmirror,\" \"a pond,\" \"like oil,\" and so forth. The deep blue of the sky\nresponded to the deep green tint of the ocean. The sapphire and the\nemerald hues vied with each other. Each were perfect. Not a cloud on\nhigh, not a line of foam below. In the midst of all this splendour, the\nApril sun rose magnificently. It was impossible to imagine a lovelier\nday.\n\nOn the verge of the horizon a flight of birds of passage formed a long\ndark line against the sky. They were flying fast as if alarmed.\n\nGilliatt set to work again to raise the breakwater.\n\nHe raised it as high as he could; as high, indeed, as the curving of the\nrocks would permit.\n\nTowards noon the sun appeared to him to give more than its usual warmth.\nNoon is the critical time of the day. Standing upon the powerful frame\nwhich he had built up, he paused again to survey the wide expanse.\n\nThe sea was more than tranquil. It was a dull dead calm. No sail was\nvisible. The sky was everywhere clear; but from blue it had become\nwhite. The whiteness was singular. To the west, and upon the horizon,\nwas a little spot of a sickly hue. The spot remained in the same place,\nbut by degrees grew larger. Near the breakers the waves shuddered; but\nvery gently.\n\nGilliatt had done well to build his breakwater.\n\nA tempest was approaching.\n\nThe elements had determined to give battle.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nTHE STRUGGLE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nEXTREMES MEET\n\n\nNothing is more threatening than a late equinox.\n\nThe appearance of the sea presents a strange phenomenon, resulting from\nwhat may be called the arrival of the ocean winds.\n\nIn all seasons, but particularly at the epoch of the Syzygies, at the\nmoment when least expected, the sea sometimes becomes singularly\ntranquil. That vast perpetual movement ceases; a sort of drowsiness and\nlanguor overspreads it; and it seems weary and about to rest. Every rag\nof bunting, from the tiny streamer of the fishing-boat to the great flag\nof ships of war, droops against the mast. The admiral's flag, the Royal\nand Imperial ensigns sleep alike.\n\nSuddenly all these streamers begin to flutter gently.\n\nIf there happen to be clouds, the moment has then come for marking the\nformation of the _cirri_; if the sun is setting, for observing the red\ntints of the horizon; or if it be night and there is a moon, for looking\nattentively for the halo.\n\nIt is then that the captain or commander of a squadron, if he happen to\npossess one of those storm indicators, the inventor of which is unknown,\nnotes his instrument carefully and takes his precautions against the\nsouth wind, if the clouds have an appearance like dissolved sugar; or\nagainst the north, if they exfoliate in crystallisations like brakes of\nbrambles, or like fir woods. Then, too, the poor Irish or Breton\nfisherman, after having consulted some mysterious gnomon engraved by the\nRomans or by demons upon one of those straight enigmatical stones, which\nare called in Brittany _Menhir_, and in Ireland _Cruach_, hauls his boat\nup on the shore.\n\nMeanwhile the serenity of sky and ocean continues. The day dawns\nradiant, and Aurora smiles. It was this which filled the old poets and\nseers with religious horror; for men dared to suspect the falsity of\nthe sun. _Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?_\n\nThe sombre vision of nature's secret laws is interdicted to man by the\nfatal opacity of surrounding things. The most terrible and perfidious of\nher aspects is that which masks the convulsions of the deep.\n\nSome hours, and even days sometimes, pass thus. Pilots raise their\ntelescopes here and there. The faces of old seamen have always an\nexpression of severity left upon them by the vexation of perpetually\nlooking out for changes.\n\nSuddenly a great confused murmur is heard. A sort of mysterious dialogue\ntakes place in the air.\n\nNothing unusual is seen.\n\nThe wide expanse is tranquil.\n\nYet the noises increase. The dialogue becomes more audible.\n\nThere is something beyond the horizon.\n\nSomething terrible. It is the wind.\n\nThe wind; or rather that populace of Titans which we call the gale. The\nunseen multitude.\n\nIndia knew them as the Maroubs, Judea as the Keroubim, Greece as the\nAquilones. They are the invisible winged creatures of the Infinite.\nTheir blasts sweep over the earth.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE OCEAN WINDS\n\n\nThey come from the immeasurable deep. Their wide wings need the breadth\nof the ocean gulf; the spaciousness of desert solitudes. The Atlantic,\nthe Pacific--those vast blue plains--are their delight. They hasten\nthither in flocks. Commander Page witnessed, far out at sea, seven\nwaterspouts at once. They wander there, wild and terrible! The\never-ending yet eternal flux and reflux is their work. The extent of\ntheir power, the limits of their will, none know. They are the Sphinxes\nof the abyss: Gama was their oedipus. In that dark, ever-moving expanse,\nthey appear with faces of cloud. He who perceives their pale lineaments\nin that wide dispersion, the horizon of the sea, feels himself in\npresence of an unsubduable power. It might be imagined that the\nproximity of human intelligence disquieted them, and that they revolted\nagainst it. The mind of man is invincible, but the elements baffle him.\nHe can do nothing against the power which is everywhere, and which none\ncan bind. The gentle breath becomes a gale, smites with the force of a\nwar-club, and then becomes gentle again. The winds attack with a\nterrible crash, and defend themselves by fading into nothingness. He who\nwould encounter them must use artifice. Their varying tactics, their\nswift redoubled blows, confuse. They fly as often as they attack. They\nare tenacious and impalpable. Who can circumvent them? The prow of the\n_Argo_, cut from an oak of Dodona's grove, that mysterious pilot of the\nbark, spoke to them, and they insulted that pilot-goddess. Columbus,\nbeholding their approach at _La Pinta_, mounted upon the poop, and\naddressed them with the first verses of St. John's Gospel. Surcouf\ndefied them: \"Here come the gang,\" he used to say. Napier greeted them\nwith cannon-balls. They assume the dictatorship of chaos.\n\nChaos is theirs, in which to wreak their mysterious vengeance: the den\nof the winds is more monstrous than that of lions. How many corpses lie\nin its deep recesses, where the howling gusts sweep without pity over\nthat obscure and ghastly mass! The winds are heard wheresoever they go,\nbut they give ear to none. Their acts resemble crimes. None know on whom\nthey cast their hoary surf; with what ferocity they hover over\nshipwrecks, looking at times as if they flung their impious foam-flakes\nin the face of heaven. They are the tyrants of unknown regions. \"_Luoghi\nspaventosi_,\" murmured the Venetian mariners.\n\nThe trembling fields of space are subjected to their fierce assaults.\nThings unspeakable come to pass in those deserted regions. Some horseman\nrides in the gloom; the air is full of a forest sound; nothing is\nvisible; but the tramp of cavalcades is heard. The noonday is overcast\nwith sudden night; a tornado passes. Or it is midnight, which suddenly\nbecomes bright as day; the polar lights are in the heavens. Whirlwinds\npass in opposite ways, and in a sort of hideous dance, a stamping of the\nstorms upon the waters. A cloud overburdened opens and falls to earth.\nOther clouds, filled with red light, flash and roar; then frown again\nominously. Emptied of their lightnings, they are but as spent brands.\nPent-up rains dissolve in mists. Yonder sea appears a fiery furnace in\nwhich the rains are falling: flames seem to issue from the waves. The\nwhite gleam of the ocean under the shower is reflected to marvellous\ndistances. The different masses transform themselves into uncouth\nshapes. Monstrous whirlpools make strange hollows in the sky. The\nvapours revolve, the waves spin, the giddy Naiads roll; sea and sky are\nlivid; noises as of cries of despair are in the air.\n\nGreat sheaves of shadow and darkness are gathered up, trembling in the\nfar depths of the sky. Now and then there is a convulsion. The rumour\nbecomes tumult as the wave becomes surge. The horizon, a confused mass\nof strata, oscillating ceaselessly, murmurs in a continual undertone.\nStrange and sudden outbursts break through the monotony. Cold airs rush\nforth, succeeded by warm blasts. The trepidation of the sea betokens\nanxious expectation, agony, terror profound. Suddenly the hurricane\ncomes down, like a wild beast, to drink of the ocean: a monstrous\ndraught! The sea rises to the invisible mouth; a mound of water is\nformed; the swell increases, and the waterspout appears; the Prester of\nthe ancients, stalactite above, stalagmite below, a whirling\ndouble-inverted cone, a point in equilibrium upon another, the embrace\nof two mountains--a mountain of foam ascending, a mountain of vapour\ndescending--terrible coition of the cloud and the wave. Like the column\nin Holy Writ, the waterspout is dark by day and luminous by night. In\nits presence the thunder itself is silent and seems cowed.\n\nThe vast commotion of those solitudes has its gamut, a terrible\ncrescendo. There are the gust, the squall, the storm, the gale, the\ntempest, the whirlwind, the waterspout--the seven chords of the lyre of\nthe winds, the seven notes of the firmament. The heavens are a clear\nspace, the sea a vast round; but a breath passes, they have vanished,\nand all is fury and wild confusion.\n\nSuch are these inhospitable realms.\n\nThe winds rush, fly, swoop down, dwindle away, commence again; hover\nabove, whistle, roar, and smile; they are frenzied, wanton, unbridled,\nor sinking at ease upon the raging waves. Their howlings have a harmony\nof their own. They make all the heavens sonorous. They blow in the cloud\nas in a trumpet; they sing through the infinite space with the mingled\ntones of clarions, horns, bugles, and trumpets--a sort of Promethean\nfanfare.\n\nSuch was the music of ancient Pan. Their harmonies are terrible. They\nhave a colossal joy in the darkness. They drive and disperse great\nships. Night and day, in all seasons, from the tropics to the pole,\nthere is no truce; sounding their fatal trumpet through the tangled\nthickets of the clouds and waves, they pursue the grim chase of vessels\nin distress. They have their packs of bloodhounds, and take their\npleasure, setting them to bark among the rocks and billows. They huddle\nthe clouds together, and drive them diverse. They mould and knead the\nsupple waters as with a million hands.\n\nThe water is supple because it is incompressible. It slips away without\neffort. Borne down on one side, it escapes on the other. It is thus that\nwaters become waves, and that the billows are a token of their liberty.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE NOISES EXPLAINED\n\n\nThe grand descent of winds upon the world takes place at the equinoxes.\nAt this period the balance of tropic and pole librates, and the vast\natmospheric tides pour their flood upon one hemisphere and their ebb\nupon another. The signs of Libra and Aquarius have reference to these\nphenomena.\n\nIt is the time of tempests.\n\nThe sea awaits their coming, keeping silence.\n\nSometimes the sky looks sickly. Its face is wan. A thick dark veil\nobscures it. The mariners observe with uneasiness the angry aspect of\nthe clouds.\n\nBut it is its air of calm contentment which they dread the most. A\nsmiling sky in the equinoxes is the tempest in gay disguise. It was\nunder skies like these that \"The Tower of Weeping Women,\" in Amsterdam,\nwas filled with wives and mothers scanning the far horizon.\n\nWhen the vernal or autumnal storms delay to break, they are gathering\nstrength; hoarding up their fury for more sure destruction. Beware of\nthe gale that has been long delayed. It was Angot who said that \"the sea\npays well old debts.\"\n\nWhen the delay is unusually long, the sea betokens her impatience only\nby a deeper calm, but the magnetic intensity manifests itself by what\nmight be called a fiery humour in the sea. Fire issues from the waves;\nelectric air, phosphoric water. The sailors feel a strange lassitude.\nThis time is particularly perilous for iron vessels; their hulls are\nthen liable to produce variations of the compass, leading them to\ndestruction. The transatlantic steam-vessel _Iowa_ perished from this\ncause.\n\nTo those who are familiar with the sea, its aspect at these moments is\nsingular. It may be imagined to be both desiring and fearing the\napproach of the cyclone. Certain unions, though strongly urged by\nnature, are attended by this strange conjunction of terror and desire.\nThe lioness in her tenderest moods flies from the lion. Thus the sea, in\nthe fire of her passion, trembles at the near approach of her union with\nthe tempest. The nuptials are prepared. Like the marriages of the\nancient emperors, they are celebrated with immolations. The f\u00c3\u00aate is\nheralded with disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, from yonder deeps, from the great open sea, from the\nunapproachable latitudes, from the lurid horizon of the watery waste,\nfrom the utmost bounds of the free ocean, the winds pour down.\n\nListen; for this is the famous equinox.\n\nThe storm prepares mischief. In the old mythology these entities were\nrecognised, indistinctly moving, in the grand scene of nature. Eolus\nplotted with Boreas. The alliance of element with element is necessary;\nthey divide their task. One has to give impetus to the wave, the cloud,\nthe stream: night is an auxiliary, and must be employed. There are\ncompasses to be falsified, beacons to be extinguished, lanterns of\nlighthouses to be masked, stars to be hidden. The sea must lend her aid.\nEvery storm is preceded by a murmur. Behind the horizon line there is a\npremonitory whispering among the hurricanes.\n\nThis is the noise which is heard afar off in the darkness amidst the\nterrible silence of the sea.\n\nIt was this significant whispering which Gilliatt had noted. The\nphosphorescence on the water had been the first warning: this murmur the\nsecond.\n\nIf the demon Legion exists, he is assuredly no other than the wind.\n\nThe wind is complex, but the air is one.\n\nHence it follows that all storms are mixed--a principle which results\nfrom the unity of the air.\n\nThe entire abyss of heaven takes part in a tempest: the entire ocean\nalso. The totality of its forces is marshalled for the strife. A wave is\nthe ocean gulf; a gust is a gulf of the atmosphere. A contest with a\nstorm is a contest with all the powers of sea and sky.\n\nIt was Messier, that great authority among naval men, the pensive\nastronomer of the little lodge at Cluny, who said, \"The wind comes from\neverywhere and is everywhere.\" He had no faith in the idea of winds\nimprisoned even in inland seas. With him there were no Mediterranean\nwinds; he declared that he recognised them as they wandered about the\nearth. He affirmed that on a certain day, at a certain hour, the F\u00c3\u00b6hn of\nthe Lake of Constance, the ancient Favonius of Lucretius, had traversed\nthe horizon of Paris; on another day, the Bora of the Adriatic; on\nanother day, the whirling Notus, which is supposed to be confined in the\nround of the Cyclades. He indicated their currents. He did not believe\nit impossible that the \"Autan,\" which circulates between Corsica and the\nBalearic Isles, could escape from its bounds. He did not admit the\ntheory of winds imprisoned like bears in their dens. It was he, too, who\nsaid that \"every rain comes from the tropics, and every flash of\nlightning from the pole.\" The wind, in fact, becomes saturated with\nelectricity at the intersection of the colures which marks the extremity\nof the axis, and with water at the equator; bringing moisture from the\nequatorial line and the electric fluid from the poles.\n\nThe wind is ubiquitous.\n\nIt is certainly not meant by this that the winds never move in zones.\nNothing is better established than the existence of those continuous air\ncurrents; and aerial navigation by means of the wind boats, to which the\npassion for Greek terminology has given the name of \"aeroscaphes,\" may\none day succeed in utilising the chief of these streams of wind. The\nregular course of air streams is an incontestable fact. There are both\nrivers of wind and rivulets of wind, although their branches are exactly\nthe reverse of water currents: for in the air it is the rivulets which\nflow out of the rivers, and the smaller rivers which flow out of the\ngreat streams instead of falling into them. Hence instead of\nconcentration we have dispersion.\n\nThe united action of the winds and the unity of the atmosphere result\nfrom this dispersion. The displacement of one molecule produces the\ndisplacement of another. The vast body of air becomes subject to one\nagitation. To these profound causes of coalition we must add the\nirregular surface of the earth, whose mountains furrow the atmosphere,\ncontorting and diverting the winds from their course, and determining\nthe directions of counter currents in infinite radiations.\n\nThe phenomenon of the wind is the oscillation of two oceans one against\nthe other; the ocean of air, superimposed upon the ocean of water, rests\nupon these currents, and is convulsed with this vast agitation.\n\nThe indivisible cannot produce separate action. No partition divides\nwave from wave. The islands of the Channel feel the influence of the\nCape of Good Hope. Navigation everywhere contends with the same monster;\nthe sea is one hydra. The waves cover it as with a coat of scales. The\nocean is Ceto.\n\nUpon that unity reposes an infinite variety.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTURBA TURMA\n\n\nAccording to the compass there are thirty-two winds, that is to say,\nthirty-two points. But these directions may be subdivided indefinitely.\nClassed by its directions, the wind is incalculable; classed by its\nkinds, it is infinite. Homer himself would have shrunk from the task of\nenumerating them.\n\nThe polar current encounters the tropical current. Heat and cold are\nthus combined; the equilibrium is distributed by a shock, the wave of\nwind issues forth and is distended, scattered and broken up in every\ndirection in fierce streams. The dispersion of the gusts shakes the\nstreaming locks of the wind upon the four corners of the horizon.\n\nAll the winds which blow are there. The wind of the Gulf Stream, which\ndisgorges the great fogs of Newfoundland; the wind of Peru, in the\nregion of silent heavens, where no man ever heard the thunder roar; the\nwind of Nova Scotia, where flies the great auk (_Alca impennis_) with\nhis furrowed beak; the iron whirlwinds of the Chinese seas; the wind of\nMozambique, which destroys the canoes and junks; the electric wind,\nwhich the people of Japan denounce by the beating of a gong; the African\nwind, which blows between Table Mountain and the Devil's Peak, where it\ngains its liberty; the currents of the equator, which pass over the\ntrade winds, describing a parabola, the summit of which is always to the\nwest; the Plutonian wind, which issues from craters, the terrible breath\nof flames; the singular wind peculiar to the volcano Awa, which\noccasions a perpetual olive tint in the north; the Java monsoon, against\nwhich the people construct those casemates known as hurricane houses;\nthe branching north winds called by the English \"Bush winds;\" the curved\nsqualls of the Straits of Malacca, observed by Horsburgh; the powerful\nsouth-west wind, called Pampero in Chili, and Rebojo at Buenos Ayres,\nwhich carries the great condor out to sea, and saves him from the pit\nwhere the Indian, concealed under a bullock-hide newly stripped,\nwatches for him, lying on his back and bending his great bow with his\nfeet; the chemical wind, which, according to Lemery, produces\nthunder-bolts from the clouds; the Harmattan of the Caffres; the Polar\nsnow-driver, which harnesses itself to the everlasting icebergs; the\nwind of the Gulf of Bengal, which sweeps over a continent to pillage the\ntriangular town of wooden booths at Nijni-Novogorod, in which is held\nthe great fair of Asia; the wind of the Cordilleras, agitator of great\nwaves and forests; the wind of the Australian Archipelago, where the\nbee-hunters take the wild hives hidden under the forks of the branches\nof the giant eucalyptus; the Sirocco, the Mistral, the Hurricane, the\ndry winds, the inundating and diluvian winds, the torrid winds, which\nscatter dust from the plains of Brazil upon the streets of Genoa, which\nboth obey and revolt against diurnal rotation, and of which Herrara\nsaid, \"_Malo viento torna contra el sol_;\" those winds which hunt in\ncouples, conspiring mischief, the one undoing the work of the other; and\nthose old winds which assailed Columbus on the coast of Veragua, and\nwhich during forty days, from the 21st of October to the 28th of\nNovember 1520, delayed and nearly frustrated Magellan's approach to the\nPacific; and those which dismasted the Armada and confounded Philip II.\nOthers, too, there are, of the names of which there is no end. The\nwinds, for instance, which carry showers of frogs and locusts, and drive\nbefore them clouds of living things across the ocean; those which blow\nin what are called \"Wind-leaps,\" and whose function is to destroy ships\nat sea; those which at a single blast throw the cargo out of trim, and\ncompel the vessel to continue her course half broadside over; the winds\nwhich construct the circum-cumuli; the winds which mass together the\ncircum-strati; the dark heavy winds swelled with rains; the winds of the\nhailstorms; the fever winds, whose approach sets the salt springs and\nsulphur springs of Calabria boiling; those which give a glittering\nappearance to the fur of African panthers, prowling among the bushes of\nCape Ferro; those which come shaking from the cloud, like the tongue of\na trigonocephal, the terrible forked lightning; and those which bring\nwhirlwinds of black snow. Such is the legion of winds.\n\nThe Douvres rock heard their distant tramp at the moment when Gilliatt\nwas constructing his breakwater.\n\nAs we have said, the wind means the combination of all the winds of the\nearth.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nGILLIATT'S ALTERNATIVES\n\n\nThe mysterious forces had chosen their time well.\n\nChance, if chance exists, is sometimes far-seeing.\n\nWhile the sloop had been anchored in the little creek of \"The Man Rock,\"\nand as long as the machinery had been prisoned in the wreck, Gilliatt's\nposition had been impregnable. The sloop was in safety; the machinery\nsheltered. The Douvres, which held the hull of the Durande fast,\ncondemned it to slow destruction, but protected it against unexpected\naccidents. In any event, one resource had remained to him. If the engine\nhad been destroyed, Gilliatt would have been uninjured. He had still the\nsloop by which to escape.\n\nBut to wait till the sloop was removed from the anchorage where she was\ninaccessible; to allow it to be fixed in the defile of the Douvres; to\nwatch until the sloop, too, was, as it were, entangled in the rocks; to\npermit him to complete the salvage, the moving, and the final\nembarkation of the machinery; to do no damage to that wonderful\nconstruction by which one man was enabled to put the whole aboard his\nbark; to acquiesce, in fact, in the success of his exploits so far; this\nwas but the trap which the elements had laid for him. Now for the first\ntime he began to perceive in all its sinister characteristics the trick\nwhich the sea had been meditating so long.\n\nThe machinery, the sloop, and their master were all now within the gorge\nof the rocks. They formed but a single point. One blow, and the sloop\nmight be dashed to pieces on the rock, the machinery destroyed, and\nGilliatt drowned.\n\nThe situation could not have been more critical.\n\nThe sphinx, which men have imagined concealing herself in the cloud,\nseemed to mock him with a dilemma.\n\n\"Go or stay.\"\n\nTo go would have been madness; to remain was terrible.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE COMBAT\n\n\nGilliatt ascended to the summit of the Great Douvre.\n\nFrom hence he could see around the horizon.\n\nThe western side was appalling. A wall of cloud spread across it,\nbarring the wide expanse from side to side, and ascending slowly from\nthe horizon towards the zenith. This wall, straight lined, vertical,\nwithout a crevice in its height, without a rent in its structure, seemed\nbuilt by the square and measured by the plumb-line. It was cloud in the\nlikeness of granite. Its escarpment, completely perpendicular at the\nsouthern extremity, curved a little towards the north, like a bent sheet\nof iron, presenting the steep slippery face of an inclined plane. The\ndark wall enlarged and grew; but its entablature never ceased for a\nmoment to be parallel with the horizon line, which was almost\nindistinguishable in the gathering darkness. Silently, and altogether,\nthe airy battlements ascended. No undulation, no wrinkle, no projection\nchanged its shape or moved its place. The aspect of this immobility in\nmovement was impressive. The sun, pale in the midst of a strange sickly\ntransparence, lighted up this outline of the Apocalypse. Already the\ncloudy bank had blotted out one half the space of the sky: shelving like\nthe fearful talus of the abyss. It was the uprising of a dark mountain\nbetween earth and heaven.\n\nIt was night falling suddenly upon midday.\n\nThere was a heat in the air as from an oven door, coming from that\nmysterious mass on mass. The sky, which from blue had become white, was\nnow turning from white to a slatey grey. The sea beneath was leaden-hued\nand dull. There was no breath, no wave, no noise. Far as eye could\nreach, the desert ocean. No sail was visible on any side. The birds had\ndisappeared. Some monstrous treason seemed abroad.\n\nThe wall of cloud grew visibly larger.\n\nThis moving mountain of vapours, which was approaching the Douvres, was\none of those clouds which might be called the clouds of battle. Sinister\nappearances; some strange, furtive glance seemed cast upon the beholder\nthrough that obscure mass up-piled.\n\nThe approach was terrible.\n\nGilliatt observed it closely, and muttered to himself, \"I am thirsty\nenough, but you will give me plenty to drink.\"\n\nHe stood there motionless a few moments, his eye fixed upon the cloud\nbank, as if mentally taking a sounding of the tempest.\n\nHis _gal\u00c3\u00a9rienne_ was in the pocket of his jacket; he took it out and\nplaced it on his head. Then he fetched from the cave, which had so long\nserved him for a sleeping-place, a few things which he had kept there in\nreserve; he put on his overalls, and attired himself in his waterproof\novercoat, like a knight who puts on his armour at the moment of battle.\nHe had no shoes; but his naked feet had become hardened to the rocks.\n\nThis preparation for the storm being completed, he looked down upon his\nbreakwater, grasped the knotted cord hurriedly, descended from the\nplateau of the Douvre, stepped on to the rocks below, and hastened to\nhis store cavern. A few moments later he was at work. The vast silent\ncloud might have heard the strokes of his hammer. With the nails, ropes,\nand beams which still remained, he constructed for the eastern gullet a\nsecond frame, which he succeeded in fixing at ten or twelve feet from\nthe other.\n\nThe silence was still profound. The blades of grass between the cracks\nof the rocks were not stirred.\n\nThe sun disappeared suddenly. Gilliatt looked up.\n\nThe rising cloud had just reached it. It was like the blotting out of\nday, succeeded by a mingled pale reflection.\n\nThe immense wall of cloud had changed its appearance. It no longer\nretained its unity. It had curved on reaching the zenith, whence it\nspread horizontally over the rest of the heavens. It had now its various\nstages. The tempest formation was visible, like the strata in the side\nof a trench. It was possible to distinguish the layers of the rain from\nthe beds of hail. There was no lightning, but a horrible, diffused\nglare; for the idea of horror may be attached to light. The vague\nbreathing of the storm was audible; the silence was broken by an obscure\npalpitation. Gilliatt, silent also, watched the giant blocks of vapour\ngrouping themselves overhead forming the shapeless mass of clouds. Upon\nthe horizon brooded and lengthened out a band of mist of ashen hue; in\nthe zenith, another band of lead colour. Pale, ragged fragments of cloud\nhung from the great mass above upon the mist below. The pile of cloud\nwhich formed the background was wan, dull, gloomy. A thin, whitish\ntransverse cloud, coming no one could tell whither, cut the high dark\nwall obliquely from north to south. One of the extremities of this\ncloud trailed along the surface of the sea. At the point where it\ntouched the waters, a dense red vapour was visible in the midst of the\ndarkness. Below it, smaller clouds, quite black and very low, were\nflying as if bewildered or moved by opposite currents of air. The\nimmense cloud beyond increased from all points at once, darkened the\neclipse, and continued to spread its sombre pall. In the east, behind\nGilliatt, there was only one clear porch in the heavens, which was\nrapidly being closed. Without any feeling of wind abroad, a strange\nflight of grey downy particles seemed to pass; they were fine and\nscattered as if some gigantic bird had been plucked of its plumage\nbehind the bank of cloud. A dark compact roof had gradually formed\nitself, which on the verge of the horizon touched the sea, and mingled\nin darkness with it. The beholder had a vague sense of something\nadvancing steadily towards him. It was vast, heavy, ominous. Suddenly an\nimmense peal of thunder burst upon the air.\n\nGilliatt himself felt the shock. The rude reality in the midst of that\nvisionary region has something in it terrific. The listener might fancy\nthat he hears something falling in the chamber of giants. No electric\nflash accompanied the report. It was a blind peal. The silence was\nprofound again. There was an interval, as when combatants take up their\nposition. Then appeared slowly, one after the other, great shapeless\nflashes; these flashes were silent. The wall of cloud was now a vast\ncavern, with roofs and arches. Outlines of forms were traceable among\nthem; monstrous heads were vaguely shadowed forth; rocks seemed to\nstretch out; elephants bearing turrets, seen for a moment, vanished. A\ncolumn of vapour, straight, round, and dark, and surmounted by a white\nmist, simulated the form of a colossal steam-vessel engulfed, hissing,\nand smoking beneath the waves. Sheets of cloud undulated like folds of\ngiant flags. In the centre, under a thick purple pall, a nucleus of\ndense fog sunk motionless, inert, impenetrable by the electric fires; a\nsort of hideous foetus in the bosom of the tempest.\n\nSuddenly Gilliatt felt a breath moving his hair. Two or three large\nspots of rain fell heavily around him on the rock. Then there was a\nsecond thunder-clap. The wind was rising.\n\nThe terror of darkness was at its highest point. The first peal of\nthunder had shaken the sea; the second rent the wall of cloud from top\nto base; breach was visible; the pent-up deluge rushed towards it; the\nrent became like a gulf filled with rain. The outpouring of the tempest\nhad begun.\n\nThe moment was terrible.\n\nRain, wind, lightnings, thunder, waves swirling upwards to the clouds,\nfoam, hoarse noises, whistlings, mingled together like monsters suddenly\nunloosened.\n\nFor a solitary man, imprisoned with an overloaded vessel, between two\ndangerous rocks in mid-ocean, no crisis could have been more menacing.\nThe danger of the tide, over which he had triumphed, was nothing\ncompared with the danger of the tempest.\n\nSurrounded on all sides by dangers, Gilliatt, at the last moment, and\nbefore the crowning peril, had developed an ingenious strategy. He had\nsecured his basis of operations in the enemies' territory; had pressed\nthe rock into his service. The Douvres, originally his enemy, had become\nhis second in that immense duel. Out of that sepulchre he had\nconstructed a fortress. He was built up among those formidable sea\nruins. He was blockaded, but well defended. He had, so to speak, set his\nback against the wall, and stood face to face with the hurricane. He had\nbarricaded the narrow strait, that highway of the waves. This, indeed,\nwas the only possible course. It seemed as if the ocean, like other\ndespots, might be brought to reason by the aid of barricades. The sloop\nmight be considered secure on three sides. Closely wedged between the\ntwo interior walls of the rock, made fast by three anchorings, she was\nsheltered from the north by the Little Douvre, on the south by the Great\none; terrible escarpments, more accustomed to wreck vessels than to save\nthem. On the western side she was protected by the frame of timbers made\nfast and nailed to the rocks--a tried barrier which had withstood the\nrude flood-tide of the sea; a veritable citadel-gate, having for its\nsides the columns of the rock--the two Douvres themselves. Nothing was\nto be feared from that side. It was on the eastern side only that there\nwas danger.\n\nOn that side there was no protection but the breakwater. A breakwater is\nan apparatus for dividing and distributing. It requires at least two\nframes. Gilliatt had only had time to construct one. He was compelled to\nbuild the second in the very presence of the tempest.\n\nFortunately the wind came from the north-west. The wind is not always\nadroit in its attacks. The north-west wind, which is the ancient\n\"galerno,\" had little effect upon the Douvres. It assailed the rocks in\nflank, and drove the waves neither against the one nor the other of the\ntwo gullets; so that instead of rushing into a defile, they dashed\nthemselves against a wall.\n\nBut the currents of the wind are curved, and it was probable that there\nwould be some sudden change. If it should veer to the east before the\nsecond frame could be constructed the peril would be great. The\nirruption of the sea into the gorge would be complete, and all would\nprobably be lost.\n\nThe wildness of the storm went on increasing. The essence of a tempest\nis the rapid succession of its blows. That is its strength; but it is\nalso its weakness. Its fury gives the opportunity to human intelligence,\nand man spies its weak points for his defence; but under what\noverwhelming assaults! No respite, no interruption, no truce, no pause\nfor taking breath. There seems an unspeakable cowardice in that\nprodigality of inexhaustible resources.\n\nAll the tumult of the wide expanse rushed towards the Douvres. Voices\nwere heard in the darkness. What could they be? The ancient terror of\nthe sea was there. At times they seemed to speak as if some one was\nuttering words of command. There were clamours, strange trepidations,\nand then that majestic roar which the mariners call the \"Ocean cry.\" The\nindefinite and flying eddies of the wind whistled, while curling the\nwaves and flinging them like giant quoits, cast by invisible athletes,\nagainst the breakers. The enormous surf streamed over all the rocks;\ntorrents above; foam below. Then the roaring was redoubled. No uproar of\nmen or beasts could yield an idea of that din which mingled with the\nincessant breaking of the sea. The clouds cannonaded, the hailstones\npoured their volleys, the surf mounted to the assault. As far as eye\ncould reach, the sea was white; ten leagues of yeasty water filled the\nhorizon. Doors of fire were opened, clouds seemed burnt by clouds, and\nshowed like smoke above a nebulous red mass, resembling burning embers.\nFloating conflagrations rushed together and amalgamated, each changing\nthe shape of the other. From the midst of the dark roof a terrible\narsenal appeared to be emptied out, hurling downward from the gulf,\npell-mell, waterspouts, hail torrents, purple fire, phosphoric gleams,\ndarkness, and lightnings.\n\nMeanwhile Gilliatt seemed to pay no attention to the storm. His head was\nbent over his work. The second framework began to approach completion.\nTo every clap of thunder he replied with a blow of his hammer, making a\ncadence which was audible even amidst that tumult. He was bareheaded,\nfor a gust had carried away his _gal\u00c3\u00a9rienne_.\n\nHe suffered from a burning thirst. Little pools of rain had formed in\nthe rocks around him. From time to time he took some water in the hollow\nof his hand and drank. Then, without even looking upward to observe the\nstorm, he applied himself anew to his task.\n\nAll might depend upon a moment. He knew the fate that awaited him if his\nbreakwater should not be completed in time. Of what avail could it be to\nlose a moment in looking for the approach of death?\n\nThe turmoil around him was like that of a vast bubbling cauldron. Crash\nand uproar were everywhere. Sometimes the lightning seemed to descend a\nsort of ladder. The electric flame returned incessantly to the same\npoints of the rock, where there were probably metallic veins. Hailstones\nfell of enormous size. Gilliatt was compelled to shake the folds of his\novercoat, even the pockets of which became filled with hail.\n\nThe storm had now rotated to the west, and was expending its fury upon\nthe barricades of the two Douvres. But Gilliatt had faith in his\nbreakwaters, and with good reason. These barricades, made of a great\nportion of the fore-part of the Durande, took the shock of the waves\neasily. Elasticity is a resistance. The experiments of Stephenson\nestablish the fact that against the waves, which are themselves elastic,\na raft of timber, joined and chained together in a certain fashion, will\nform a more powerful obstacle than a breakwater of masonry. The barriers\nof the Douvres fulfilled these conditions. They were, moreover, so\ningeniously made fast, that the waves striking them beneath were like\nhammers beating in nails, pressing and consolidating the work upon the\nrocks. To demolish them it would have been necessary to overthrow the\nDouvres themselves. The surf, in fact, was only able to cast over upon\nthe sloop some flakes of foam. On that side, thanks to the barrier, the\ntempest ended only in harmless insult. Gilliatt turned his back upon the\nscene. He heard composedly its useless rage upon the rocks behind him.\n\nThe foam-flakes coming from all sides were like flights of down. The\nvast irritated ocean deluged the rocks, dashed over them and raged\nwithin, penetrated into the network of their interior fissures, and\nissued again from the granitic masses by the narrow chinks, forming a\nkind of inexhaustible fountains playing peacefully in the midst of that\ndeluge. Here and there a silvery network fell gracefully from these\nspouts in the sea.\n\nThe second frame of the eastern barrier was nearly completed. A few\nmore knots of rope and ends of chains and this new rampart would be\nready to play its part in barring out the storm.\n\nSuddenly there was a great brightness; the rain ceased; the clouds\nrolled asunder; the wind had just shifted; a sort of high, dark window\nopened in the zenith, and the lightnings were extinguished. The end\nseemed to have come. It was but the commencement.\n\nThe change of wind was from the north-west to the north-east.\n\nThe storm was preparing to burst forth again with a new legion of\nhurricanes. The north was about to mount to the assault. Sailors call\nthis dreaded moment of transition the \"Return storm.\" The southern wind\nbrings most rain, the north wind most lightning.\n\nThe attack, coming now from the east, was directed against the weak\npoint of the position.\n\nThis time Gilliatt interrupted his work and looked around him.\n\nHe stood erect, upon a curved projection of the rock behind the second\nbarrier, which was nearly finished. If the first frame had been carried\naway, it would have broken down the second, which was not yet\nconsolidated, and must have crushed him. Gilliatt, in the place that he\nhad chosen, must in that case have been destroyed before seeing the\nsloop, the machinery, and all his work shattered and swallowed up in the\ngulf. Such was the possibility which awaited him. He accepted it, and\ncontemplated it sternly.\n\nIn that wreck of all his hope, to die at once would have been his\ndesire; to die first, as he would have regarded it--for the machinery\nproduced in his mind the effect of a living being. He moved aside his\nhair, which was beaten over his eyes by the wind, grasped his trusty\nmallet, drew himself up in a menacing attitude, and awaited the event.\n\nHe was not kept long in suspense.\n\nA flash of lightning gave the signal; the livid opening in the zenith\nclosed; a driving torrent of rain fell; then all became dark, save where\nthe lightnings broke forth once more. The attack had recommenced in\nearnest.\n\nA heavy swell, visible from time to time in the blaze of the lightning,\nwas rolling in the east beyond \"The Man Rock.\" It resembled a huge wall\nof glass. It was green and without foam, and it stretched across the\nwide expanse. It was advancing towards the breakwater, increasing as it\napproached. It was a singular kind of gigantic cylinder, rolling upon\nthe ocean. The thunder kept up a hollow rumbling.\n\nThe great wave struck \"The Man Rock,\" broke in twain, and passed beyond.\nThe broken wave, rejoined, formed a mountain of water, and instead of\nadvancing in parallel line as before, came down perpendicularly upon the\nbreakwater.\n\nThe shock was terrific: the whole wave became a roaring surf.\n\nIt is impossible for those who have not witnessed them to imagine those\nsnowy avalanches which the sea thus precipitates, and under which it\nengulfs for the moment rocks of more than a hundred feet in height,\nsuch, for example, as the Great Anderlo at Guernsey, and the Pinnacle at\nJersey. At Saint Mary of Madagascar it passes completely over the\npromontory of Tintingue.\n\nFor some moments the sea drowned everything. Nothing was visible except\nthe furious waters, an enormous breadth of foam, the whiteness of a\nwinding-sheet blowing in the draught of a sepulchre; nothing was heard\nbut the roaring storm working devastation around.\n\nWhen the foam subsided, Gilliatt was still standing at his post.\n\nThe barrier had stood firm. Not a chain was broken, not a nail\ndisplaced. It had exhibited under the trial the two chief qualities of a\nbreakwater; it had proved flexible as a hurdle and firm as a wall. The\nsurf falling upon it had dissolved into a shower of drops.\n\nA river of foam rushing along the zigzags of the defile subsided as it\napproached the sloop.\n\nThe man who had put this curb upon the fury of the ocean took no rest.\n\nThe storm fortunately turned aside its fury for a moment. The fierce\nattack of the waves was renewed upon the wall of the rock. There was a\nrespite, and Gilliatt took advantage of it to complete the interior\nbarrier.\n\nThe daylight faded upon his labours. The hurricane continued its\nviolence upon the flank of the rocks with a mournful solemnity. The\nstores of fire and water in the sky poured out incessantly without\nexhausting themselves. The undulations of the wind above and below were\nlike the movements of a dragon.\n\nNightfall brought scarcely any deeper night. The change was hardly felt,\nfor the darkness was never complete. Tempests alternately darkening and\nillumining by their lightnings, are merely intervals of the visible and\ninvisible. All is pale glare, and then all is darkness. Spectral shapes\nissue forth suddenly, and return as suddenly into the deep shade.\n\nA phosphoric zone, tinged with the hue of the aurora borealis, appeared\nlike ghastly flames behind the dense clouds, giving to all things a wan\naspect, and making the rain-drifts luminous.\n\nThis uncertain light aided Gilliatt, and directed him in his operations.\nBy its help he was enabled to raise the forward barrier. The breakwater\nwas now almost complete. As he was engaged in making fast a powerful\ncable to the last beam, the gale blew directly in his face. This\ncompelled him to raise his head. The wind had shifted abruptly to the\nnorth-east. The assault upon the eastern gullet recommenced. Gilliatt\ncast his eyes around the horizon. Another great wall of water was\napproaching.\n\nThe wave broke with a great shock; a second followed; then another and\nanother still; then five or six almost together; then a last shock of\ntremendous force.\n\nThis last wave, which was an accumulation of forces, had a singular\nresemblance to a living thing. It would not have been difficult to\nimagine in the midst of that swelling mass the shapes of fins and\ngill-coverings. It fell heavily and broke upon the barriers. Its almost\nanimal form was torn to pieces in the shape of spouts and gushes,\nresembling the crushing to death of some sea hydra upon that block of\nrocks and timbers. The swell rushed through, subsiding but devastating\nas it went. The huge wave seemed to bite and cling to its victim as it\ndied. The rock shook to its base. A savage howling mingled with the\nroar; the foam flew far like the spouting of a leviathan.\n\nThe subsidence exhibited the extent of the ravages of the surf. This\nlast escalade had not been ineffectual. The breakwater had suffered this\ntime. A long and heavy beam, torn from the first barrier, had been\ncarried over the second, and hurled violently upon the projecting rock\non which Gilliatt had stood but a moment before. By good fortune he had\nnot returned there. Had he done so, his death had been inevitable.\n\nThere was a remarkable circumstance in the fall of this beam, which by\npreventing the framework rebounding, saved Gilliatt from greater\ndangers. It even proved useful to him, as will be seen, in another way.\n\nBetween the projecting rock and the interior wall of the defile there\nwas a large interval, something like the notch of an axe, or the split\nof a wedge. One of the extremities of the timber hurled into the air by\nthe waves had stuck fast into this notch in falling. The gap had become\nenlarged.\n\nGilliatt was struck with an idea. It was that of bearing heavily on the\nother extremity.\n\nThe beam caught by one end in the nook, which it had widened, projected\nfrom it straight as an outstretched arm. This species of arm projected\nparallel with the anterior wall of the defile, and the disengaged end\nstretched from its resting place about eighteen or twenty inches. A good\ndistance for the object to be attained.\n\nGilliatt raised himself by means of his hands, feet, and knees to the\nescarpment, and then turned his back, pressing both his shoulders\nagainst the enormous lever. The beam was long, which increased its\nraising power. The rock was already loosened; but he was compelled to\nrenew his efforts again and again. The sweat-drops rolled from his\nforehead as rapidly as the spray. The fourth attempt exhausted all his\npowers. There was a cracking noise; the gap spreading in the shape of a\nfissure, opened its vast jaws, and the heavy mass fell into the narrow\nspace of the defile with a noise like the echo of the thunder.\n\nThe mass fell straight, and without breaking; resting in its bed like a\nDruid cromlech precipitated in one piece.\n\nThe beam which had served as a lever descended with the rock, and\nGilliatt, stumbling forward as it gave way, narrowly escaped falling.\n\nThe bed of the pass at this part was full of huge round stones, and\nthere was little water. The monolith lying in the boiling foam, the\nflakes of which fell on Gilliatt where he stood, stretched from side to\nside of the great parallel rocks of the defile, and formed a transversal\nwall, a sort of cross-stroke between the two escarpments. Its two ends\ntouched the rocks. It had been a little too long to lie flat, but its\nsummit of soft rock was struck off with the fall. The result of this\nfall was a singular sort of _cul-de-sac_, which may still be seen. The\nwater behind this stony barrier is almost always tranquil.\n\nThis was a rampart more invincible still than the forward timbers of the\nDurande fixed between the two Douvres.\n\nThe barrier came opportunely.\n\nThe assaults of the sea had continued. The obstinacy of the waves is\nalways increased by an obstacle. The first frame began to show signs of\nbreaking up. One breach, however small, in a breakwater, is always\nserious. It inevitably enlarges, and there is no means of supplying its\nplace, for the sea would sweep away the workmen.\n\nA flash which lighted up the rocks revealed to Gilliatt the nature of\nthe mischief; the beams broken down, the ends of rope and fragments of\nchain swinging in the winds, and a rent in the centre of the apparatus.\nThe second frame was intact.\n\nThough the block of stone so powerfully overturned by Gilliatt in the\ndefile behind the breakwater was the strongest possible barrier, it had\na defect. It was too low. The surge could not destroy, but could sweep\nover it.\n\nIt was useless to think of building it higher. Nothing but masses of\nrock could avail upon a barrier of stone; but how could such masses be\ndetached? or, if detached, how could they be moved, or raised, or piled,\nor fixed? Timbers may be added, but rocks cannot.\n\nGilliatt was not Enceladus.\n\nThe very little height of this rocky isthmus rendered him anxious.\n\nThe effects of this fault were not long in showing themselves. The\nassaults upon the breakwater were incessant; the heavy seas seemed not\nmerely to rage, but to attack with determination to destroy it. A sort\nof trampling noise was heard upon the jolted framework.\n\nSuddenly the end of a binding strake, detached from the dislocated\nframe, was swept away over the second barrier and across the transversal\nrock, falling in the defile, where the water seized and carried it into\nthe sinuosities of the pass. Gilliatt lost sight of it. It seemed\nprobable that it would do some injury to the sloop. Fortunately, the\nwater in the interior of the rocks, shut in on all sides, felt little of\nthe commotion without. The waves there were comparatively trifling, and\nthe shock was not likely to be very severe. For the rest, he had little\ntime to spare for reflection upon this mishap. Every variety of danger\nwas arising at once; the tempest was concentrated upon the vulnerable\npoint; destruction was imminent.\n\nThe darkness was profound for a moment: the lightnings paused--a sort of\nsinister connivance. The cloud and the sea became one: there was a dull\npeal.\n\nThis was followed by a terrible outburst. The frame which formed the\nfront of the barriers was swept away. The fragments of beams were\nvisible in the rolling waters. The sea was using the first breakwater as\nan engine for making a breach in the second.\n\nGilliatt experienced the feeling of a general who sees his advanced\nguard driven in.\n\nThe second construction of beams resisted the shock. The apparatus\nbehind it was powerfully secured and buttressed. But the broken frame\nwas heavy, and was at the mercy of the waves, which were incessantly\nhurling it forward and withdrawing it. The ropes and chains which\nremained unsevered prevented its entirely breaking up, and the qualities\nwhich Gilliatt had given it as a means of defence made it, in the end, a\nmore effective weapon of destruction. Instead of a buckler, it had\nbecome a battering-ram. Besides this, it was now full of irregularities\nfrom breaking; ends of timbers projected from all parts; and it was, as\nit were, covered with teeth and spikes. No sort of arm could have been\nmore effective, or more fitted for the handling of the tempest. It was\nthe projectile, while the sea played the part of the catapult.\n\nThe blows succeeded each other with a dismal regularity. Gilliatt,\nthoughtful and anxious, behind that barricaded portal, listened to the\nsound of death knocking loudly for admittance.\n\nHe reflected with bitterness that, but for the fatal entanglement of the\nfunnel of the Durande in the wreck, he would have been at that very\nmoment, and even since the morning, once more at Guernsey, in the port,\nwith the sloop out of danger and with the machinery saved.\n\nThe dreaded moment arrived. The destruction was complete. There was a\nsound like a death-rattle. The entire frame of the breakwater, the\ndouble apparatus crushed and mingled confusedly, came in a whirl of\nfoam, rushing upon the stone barricade like chaos upon a mountain, where\nit stopped. Here the fragments lay together, a mass of beams penetrable\nby the waves, but still breaking their force. The conquered barrier\nstruggled nobly against destruction. The waves had shattered it, and in\ntheir turn were shattered against it. Though overthrown, it still\nremained in some degree effective. The rock which barred its passage, an\nimmovable obstacle held it fast. The defile, as we have said, was very\nnarrow at that point; the victorious whirlwind had driven forward,\nmingled and piled up the wreck of the breakwater in this narrow pass.\nThe very violence of the assault, by heaping up the mass and driving the\nbroken ends one into the other, had contributed to make the pile firm.\nIt was destroyed, but immovable. A few pieces of timber only were swept\naway and dispersed by the waves. One passed through the air very near\nto Gilliatt. He felt the counter current upon his forehead.\n\nSome waves, however, of that kind which in great tempests return with an\nimperturbable regularity, swept over the ruins of the breakwater. They\nfell into the defile, and in spite of the many angles of the passage,\nset the waters within in commotion. The waters began to roll through the\ngorge ominously. The mysterious embraces of the waves among the rocks\nwere audible.\n\nWhat means were there of preventing this agitation extending as far as\nthe sloop? It would not require a long time for the blast of wind to\ncreate a tempest through all the windings of the pass. A few heavy seas\nwould be sufficient to stave in the sloop and scatter her burden.\n\nGilliatt shuddered as he reflected.\n\nBut he was not disconcerted. No defeat could daunt his soul.\n\nThe hurricane had now discovered the true plan of attack, and was\nrushing fiercely between the two walls of the strait.\n\nSuddenly a crash was heard, resounding and prolonging itself through the\ndefile at some distance behind him: a crash more terrible than any he\nhad yet heard.\n\nIt came from the direction of the sloop.\n\nSomething disastrous was happening there.\n\nGilliatt hastened towards it.\n\nFrom the eastern gullet where he was, he could not see the sloop on\naccount of the sharp turns of the pass. At the last turn he stopped and\nwaited for the lightning.\n\nThe first flash revealed to him the position of affairs.\n\nThe rush of the sea through the eastern entrance had been met by a blast\nof wind from the other end. A disaster was near at hand.\n\nThe sloop had received no visible damage; anchored as she was, the storm\nhad little power over her, but the carcase of the Durande was\ndistressed.\n\nIn such a tempest, the wreck presented a considerable surface. It was\nentirely out of the sea in the air, exposed. The breach which Gilliatt\nhad made, and which he had passed the engine through, had rendered the\nhull still weaker. The keelson was snapped, the vertebral column of the\nskeleton was broken.\n\nThe hurricane had passed over it. Scarcely more than this was needed to\ncomplete its destruction. The planking of the deck had bent like an\nopened book. The dismemberment had begun. It was the noise of this\ndislocation which had reached Gilliatt's ears in the midst of the\ntempest.\n\nThe disaster which presented itself as he approached appeared almost\nirremediable.\n\nThe square opening which he had cut in the keel had become a gaping\nwound. The wind had converted the smooth-cut hole into a ragged\nfracture. This transverse breach separated the wreck in two. The\nafter-part, nearest to the sloop, had remained firm in its bed of rocks.\nThe forward portion which faced him was hanging. A fracture, while it\nholds, is a sort of hinge. The whole mass oscillated, as the wind moved\nit, with a doleful noise. Fortunately the sloop was no longer beneath\nit.\n\nBut this swinging movement shook the other portion of the hull, still\nwedged and immovable as it was between the two Douvres. From shaking to\ncasting down the distance is not far. Under the obstinate assaults of\nthe gale, the dislocated part might suddenly carry away the other\nportion, which almost touched the sloop. In this case, the whole wreck,\ntogether with the sloop and the engine, must be swept into the sea and\nswallowed up.\n\nAll this presented itself to his eyes. It was the end of all. How could\nit be prevented?\n\nGilliatt was one of those who are accustomed to snatch the means of\nsafety out of danger itself. He collected his ideas for a moment. Then\nhe hastened to his arsenal and brought his hatchet.\n\nThe mallet had served him well, it was now the turn of the axe.\n\nHe mounted upon the wreck, got a footing on that part of the planking\nwhich had not given way, and leaning over the precipice of the pass\nbetween the Douvres, he began to cut away the broken joists and the\nplanking which supported the hanging portion of the hull.\n\nHis object was to effect the separation of the two parts of the wreck,\nto disencumber the half which remained firm, to throw overboard what the\nwaves had seized, and thus share the prey with the storm. The hanging\nportion of the wreck, borne down by the wind and by its own weight,\nadhered only at one or two points. The entire wreck resembled a\nfolding-screen, one leaf of which, half-hanging, beat against the other.\nFive or six pieces of the planking only, bent and started, but not\nbroken, still held. Their fractures creaked and enlarged at every gust,\nand the axe, so to speak, had but to help the labour of the wind. This\nmore than half-severed condition, while it increased the facility of the\nwork, also rendered it dangerous. The whole might give way beneath him\nat any moment.\n\nThe tempest had reached its highest point. The convulsion of the sea\nreached the heavens. Hitherto the storm had been supreme, it had seemed\nto work its own imperious will, to give the impulse, to drive the waves\nto frenzy, while still preserving a sort of sinister lucidity. Below was\nfury--above, anger. The heavens are the breath, the ocean only foam,\nhence the authority of the wind. But the intoxication of its own horrors\nhad confused it. It had become a mere whirlwind; it was a blindness\nleading to night. There are times when tempests become frenzied, when\nthe heavens are attacked with a sort of delirium; when the firmament\nraves and hurls its lightnings blindly. No terror is greater than this.\nIt is a hideous moment. The trembling of the rock was at its height.\nEvery storm has a mysterious course, but now it loses its appointed\npath. It is the most dangerous point of the tempest. \"At that moment,\"\nsays Thomas Fuller, \"the wind is a furious maniac.\" It is at that\ninstant that that continuous discharge of electricity takes place which\nPiddington calls \"the cascade of lightnings.\" It is at that instant that\nin the blackest spot of the clouds, none know why, unless it be to spy\nthe universal terror, a circle of blue light appears, which the Spanish\nsailors of ancient times called the eye of the tempest, _el ojo de la\ntempestad_. That terrible eye looked down upon Gilliatt.\n\nGilliatt on his part was surveying the heavens. He raised his head now.\nAfter every stroke of his hatchet he stood erect and gazed upwards,\nalmost haughtily. He was, or seemed to be, too near destruction not to\nfeel self-sustained. Would he despair? No! In the presence of the\nwildest fury of the ocean he was watchful as well as bold. He planted\nhis feet only where the wreck was firm. He ventured his life, and yet\nwas careful; for his determined spirit, too, had reached its highest\npoint. His strength had grown tenfold greater. He had become heated with\nhis own intrepidity. The strokes of his hatchet were like blows of\ndefiance. He seemed to have gained in directness what the tempest had\nlost. A pathetic struggle! On the one hand, an indefatigable will; on\nthe other, inexhaustible power. It was a contest with the elements for\nthe prize at his feet. The clouds took the shape of Gorgon masks in the\nimmensity of the heavens; every possible form of terror appeared; the\nrain came from the sea, the surf from the cloud; phantoms of the wind\nbent down; meteoric faces revealed themselves and were again eclipsed,\nleaving the darkness more monstrous: then there was nothing seen but the\ntorrents coming from all sides--a boiling sea; cumuli heavy with hail,\nashen-hued, ragged-edged, appeared seized with a sort of whirling\nfrenzy; strange rattlings filled the air; the inverse currents of\nelectricity observed by Volta darted their sudden flashes from cloud to\ncloud. The prolongation of the lightnings was terrible; the flashes\npassed near to Gilliatt. The very ocean seemed astonished. He passed to\nand fro upon the tottering wreck, making the deck tremble under his\nsteps, striking, cutting, hacking with the hatchet in his hand, pallid\nin the gleam of the lightning, his long hair streaming, his feet naked,\nin rags, his face covered with the foam of the sea, but grand still amid\nthat maelstrom of the thunderstorm.\n\nAgainst these furious powers man has no weapon but his invention.\nInvention was Gilliatt's triumph. His object was to allow all the\ndislocated portions of the wreck to fall together. For this reason he\ncut away the broken portions without entirely separating them, leaving\nsome parts on which they still swung. Suddenly he stopped, holding his\naxe in the air. The operation was complete. The entire portion went with\na crash.\n\nThe mass rolled down between the two Douvres, just below Gilliatt, who\nstood upon the wreck, leaning over and observing the fall. It fell\nperpendicularly into the water, struck the rocks, and stopped in the\ndefile before touching the bottom. Enough remained out of the water to\nrise more than twelve feet above the waves. The vertical mass of\nplanking formed a wall between the two Douvres; like the rock overturned\ncrosswise higher up the defile, it allowed only a slight stream of foam\nto pass through at its two extremities, and thus was a fifth barricade\nimprovised by Gilliatt against the tempest in that passage of the seas.\n\nThe hurricane itself, in its blind fury, had assisted in the\nconstruction of this last barrier.\n\nIt was fortunate that the proximity of the two walls had prevented the\nmass of wreck from falling to the bottom. This circumstance gave the\nbarricade greater height; the water, besides, could flow under the\nobstacle, which diminished the power of the waves. That which passes\nbelow cannot pass over. This is partly the secret of the floating\nbreakwater.\n\nHenceforth, let the storm do what it might, there was nothing to fear\nfor the sloop or the machinery. The water around them could not become\nagitated again. Between the barrier of the Douvres, which covered them\non the west, and the barricade which protected them from the east, no\nheavy sea or wind could reach them.\n\nGilliatt had plucked safety out of the catastrophe itself. The storm had\nbeen his fellow-labourer in the work.\n\nThis done, he took a little water in the palm of his hand from one of\nthe rain-pools, and drank: and then, looking upward at the storm, said\nwith a smile, \"Bungler!\"\n\nHuman intelligence combating with brute force experiences an ironical\njoy in demonstrating the stupidity of its antagonist, and compelling it\nto serve the very objects of its fury, and Gilliatt felt something of\nthat immemorial desire to insult his invisible enemy, which is as old as\nthe heroes of the _Iliad_.\n\nHe descended to the sloop and examined it by the gleam of the lightning.\nThe relief which he had been able to give to his distressed bark was\nwell-timed. She had been much shaken during the last hour, and had begun\nto give way. A hasty glance revealed no serious injury. Nevertheless, he\nwas certain that the vessel had been subjected to violent shocks. As\nsoon as the waves had subsided, the hull had righted itself; the anchors\nhad held fast; as to the machine, the four chains had supported it\nadmirably.\n\nWhile Gilliatt was completing this survey, something white passed before\nhis eyes and vanished in the gloom. It was a sea-mew.\n\nNo sight could be more welcome in tempestuous weather. When the birds\nreappear the storm is departing. The thunder redoubled; another good\nsign.\n\nThe violent efforts of the storm had broken its force. All mariners know\nthat the last ordeal is severe, but short. The excessive violence of the\nthunderstorm is the herald of the end.\n\nThe rain stopped suddenly. Then there was only a surly rumbling in the\nheavens. The storm ceased with the suddenness of a plank falling to the\nground. The immense mass of clouds became disorganised. A strip of clear\nsky appeared between them. Gilliatt was astonished: it was broad\ndaylight.\n\nThe tempest had lasted nearly twenty hours.\n\nThe wind which had brought the storm carried it away. A dark pile was\ndiffused over the horizon, the broken clouds were flying in confusion\nacross the sky. From one end to the other of the line there was a\nmovement of retreat: a long muttering was heard, gradually decreasing, a\nfew last drops of rain fell, and all those dark masses charged with\nthunder, departed like a terrible multitude of chariots.\n\nSuddenly the wide expanse of sky became blue.\n\nGilliatt perceived that he was wearied. Sleep swoops down upon the\nexhausted frame like a bird upon its prey. He drooped and sank upon the\ndeck of the bark without choosing his position, and there slept.\nStretched at length and inert, he remained thus for some hours, scarcely\ndistinguishable from the beams and joists among which he lay.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\nPITFALLS IN THE WAY\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nHE WHO IS HUNGRY IS NOT ALONE\n\n\nWhen he awakened he was hungry.\n\nThe sea was growing calmer. But there was still a heavy swell, which\nmade his departure, for the present at least, impossible. The day, too,\nwas far advanced. For the sloop with its burden to get to Guernsey\nbefore midnight, it was necessary to start in the morning.\n\nAlthough pressed by hunger, Gilliatt began by stripping himself, the\nonly means of getting warmth. His clothing was saturated by the storm,\nbut the rain had washed out the sea-water, which rendered it possible to\ndry them.\n\nHe kept nothing on but his trousers, which he turned up nearly to the\nknees.\n\nHis overcoat, jacket, overalls, and sheepskin he spread out and fixed\nwith large round stones here and there.\n\nThen he thought of eating.\n\nHe had recourse to his knife, which he was careful to sharpen, and to\nkeep always in good condition; and he detached from the rocks a few\nlimpets, similar in kind to the _clonisses_ of the Mediterranean. It is\nwell known that these are eaten raw: but after so many labours, so\nvarious and so rude, the pittance was meagre. His biscuit was gone; but\nof water he had now abundance.\n\nHe took advantage of the receding tide to wander among the rocks in\nsearch of crayfish. There was extent enough of rock to hope for a\nsuccessful search.\n\nBut he had not reflected that he could do nothing with these without\nfire to cook them. If he had taken the trouble to go to his\nstore-cavern, he would have found it inundated with the rain. His wood\nand coal were drowned, and of his store of tow, which served him for\ntinder, there was not a fibre which was not saturated. No means remained\nof lighting a fire.\n\nFor the rest, his blower was completely disorganised. The screen of the\nhearth of his forge was broken down; the storm had sacked and devastated\nhis workshop. With what tools and apparatus had escaped the general\nwreck, he could still have done carpentry work; but he could not have\naccomplished any of the labours of the smith. Gilliatt, however, never\nthought of his workshop for a moment.\n\nDrawn in another direction by the pangs of hunger, he had pursued\nwithout much reflection his search for food. He wandered, not in the\ngorge of the rocks, but outside among the smaller breakers. It was there\nthat the Durande, ten weeks previously, had first struck upon the sunken\nreef.\n\nFor the search that Gilliatt was prosecuting, this part was more\nfavourable than the interior. At low water the crabs are accustomed to\ncrawl out into the air. They seem to like to warm themselves in the sun,\nwhere they swarm sometimes to the disgust of loiterers, who recognise in\nthese creatures, with their awkward sidelong gait, climbing clumsily\nfrom crack to crack the lower stages of the rocks like the steps of a\nstaircase, a sort of sea vermin.\n\nFor two months Gilliatt had lived upon these vermin of the sea.\n\nOn this day, however, the crayfish and crabs were both wanting. The\ntempest had driven them into their solitary retreats; and they had not\nyet mustered courage to venture abroad. Gilliatt held his open knife in\nhis hand, and from time to time scraped a cockle from under the bunches\nof seaweed, which he ate while still walking.\n\nHe could not have been far from the very spot where Sieur Clubin had\nperished.\n\nAs Gilliatt was determining to content himself with the sea-urchins and\nthe _ch\u00c3\u00a2taignes de mer_, a little clattering noise at his feet aroused\nhis attention. A large crab, startled by his approach, had just dropped\ninto a pool. The water was shallow, and he did not lose sight of it.\n\nHe chased the crab along the base of the rock; the crab moved fast.\n\nSuddenly it was gone.\n\nIt had buried itself in some crevice under the rock.\n\nGilliatt clutched the projections of the rock, and stretched out to\nobserve where it shelved away under the water.\n\nAs he suspected, there was an opening there in which the creature had\nevidently taken refuge. It was more than a crevice; it was a kind of\nporch.\n\nThe sea entered beneath it, but was not deep. The bottom was visible,\ncovered with large pebbles. The pebbles were green and clothed with\n_conferv\u00c3\u00a6_, indicating that they were never dry. They were like the tops\nof a number of heads of infants, covered with a kind of green hair.\n\nHolding his knife between his teeth, Gilliatt descended, by the help of\nfeet and hands, from the upper part of the escarpment, and leaped into\nthe water. It reached almost to his shoulders.\n\nHe made his way through the porch, and found himself in a blind passage,\nwith a roof in the form of a rude arch over his head. The walls were\npolished and slippery. The crab was nowhere visible. He gained his feet\nand advanced in daylight growing fainter, so that he began to lose the\npower to distinguish objects.\n\nAt about fifteen paces the vaulted roof ended overhead. He had\npenetrated beyond the blind passage. There was here more space, and\nconsequently more daylight. The pupils of his eyes, moreover, had\ndilated; he could see pretty clearly. He was taken by surprise.\n\nHe had made his way again into the singular cavern which he had visited\nin the previous month. The only difference was that he had entered by\nthe way of the sea.\n\nIt was through the submarine arch, that he had remarked before, that he\nhad just entered. At certain low tides it was accessible.\n\nHis eyes became more accustomed to the place. His vision became clearer\nand clearer. He was astonished. He found himself again in that\nextraordinary palace of shadows; saw again before his eyes that vaulted\nroof, those columns, those purple and blood-like stains, that vegetation\nrich with gems, and at the farther end, that crypt or sanctuary, and\nthat altar-like stone. He took little notice of these details, but their\nimpression was in his mind, and he saw that the place was unchanged.\n\nHe observed before him, at a certain height in the wall, the crevice\nthrough which he had penetrated the first time, and which, from the\npoint where he now stood, appeared inaccessible.\n\nNear the moulded arch, he remarked those low dark grottoes, a sort of\ncaves within a cavern, which he had already observed from a distance. He\nnow stood nearer to them. The entrance to the nearest to him was out of\nthe water, and easily approachable. Nearer still than this recess he\nnoticed, above the level of the water, and within reach of his hand, a\nhorizontal fissure. It seemed to him probable that the crab had taken\nrefuge there, and he plunged his hand in as far as he was able, and\ngroped about in that dusky aperture.\n\nSuddenly he felt himself seized by the arm. A strange indescribable\nhorror thrilled through him.\n\nSome living thing, thin, rough, flat, cold, slimy, had twisted itself\nround his naked arm, in the dark depth below. It crept upward towards\nhis chest. Its pressure was like a tightening cord, its steady\npersistence like that of a screw. In less than a moment some mysterious\nspiral form had passed round his wrist and elbow, and had reached his\nshoulder. A sharp point penetrated beneath the armpit.\n\nGilliatt recoiled; but he had scarcely power to move! He was, as it\nwere, nailed to the place. With his left hand, which was disengaged, he\nseized his knife, which he still held between his teeth, and with that\nhand, holding the knife, he supported himself against the rocks, while\nhe made a desperate effort to withdraw his arm. He succeeded only in\ndisturbing his persecutor, which wound itself still tighter. It was\nsupple as leather, strong as steel, cold as night.\n\nA second form, sharp, elongated, and narrow, issued out of the crevice,\nlike a tongue out of monstrous jaws. It seemed to lick his naked body.\nThen suddenly stretching out, it became longer and thinner, as it crept\nover his skin, and wound itself round him. At the same time a terrible\nsense of pain, comparable to nothing he had ever known, compelled all\nhis muscles to contract. He felt upon his skin a number of flat rounded\npoints. It seemed as if innumerable suckers had fastened to his flesh\nand were about to drink his blood.\n\nA third long undulating shape issued from the hole in the rock; seemed\nto feel its way about his body; lashed round his ribs like a cord, and\nfixed itself there.\n\nAgony when at its height is mute. Gilliatt uttered no cry. There was\nsufficient light for him to see the repulsive forms which had entangled\nthemselves about him. A fourth ligature, but this one swift as an arrow,\ndarted towards his stomach, and wound around him there.\n\nIt was impossible to sever or tear away the slimy bands which were\ntwisted tightly round his body, and were adhering by a number of points.\nEach of the points was the focus of frightful and singular pangs. It was\nas if numberless small mouths were devouring him at the same time.\n\nA fifth long, slimy, riband-shaped strip issued from the hole. It passed\nover the others, and wound itself tightly around his chest. The\ncompression increased his sufferings. He could scarcely breathe.\n\nThese living thongs were pointed at their extremities, but broadened\nlike a blade of a sword towards its hilt. All belonged evidently to the\nsame centre. They crept and glided about him; he felt the strange points\nof pressure, which seemed to him like mouths, change their places from\ntime to time.\n\nSuddenly a large, round, flattened, glutinous mass issued from beneath\nthe crevice. It was the centre; the five thongs were attached to it like\nspokes to the nave of a wheel. On the opposite side of this disgusting\nmonster appeared the commencement of three other tentacles, the ends of\nwhich remained under the rock. In the middle of this slimy mass appeared\ntwo eyes.\n\nThe eyes were fixed on Gilliatt.\n\nHe recognised the Devil-Fish.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE MONSTER\n\n\nIt is difficult for those who have not seen it to believe in the\nexistence of the devil-fish.\n\nCompared to this creature, the ancient hydras are insignificant.\n\nAt times we are tempted to imagine that the vague forms which float in\nour dreams may encounter in the realm of the Possible attractive forces,\nhaving power to fix their lineaments, and shape living beings, out of\nthese creatures of our slumbers. The Unknown has power over these\nstrange visions, and out of them composes monsters. Orpheus, Homer, and\nHesiod imagined only the Chimera: Providence has created this terrible\ncreature of the sea.\n\nCreation abounds in monstrous forms of life. The wherefore of this\nperplexes and affrights the religious thinker.\n\nIf terror were the object of its creation, nothing could be imagined\nmore perfect than the devil-fish.\n\nThe whale has enormous bulk, the devil-fish is comparatively small; the\njararaca makes a hissing noise, the devil-fish is mute; the rhinoceros\nhas a horn, the devil-fish has none; the scorpion has a dart, the\ndevil-fish has no dart; the shark has sharp fins, the devil-fish has no\nfins; the vespertilio-bat has wings with claws, the devil-fish has no\nwings; the porcupine has his spines, the devil-fish has no spines; the\nsword-fish has his sword, the devil-fish has none; the torpedo has its\nelectric spark, the devil-fish has none; the toad has its poison, the\ndevil-fish has none; the viper has its venom, the devil-fish has no\nvenom; the lion has its talons, the devil-fish has no talons; the\ngriffon has its beak, the devil-fish has no beak; the crocodile has its\njaws, the devil-fish has no teeth.\n\nThe devil-fish has no muscular organisation, no menacing cry, no\nbreastplate, no horn, no dart, no claw, no tail with which to hold or\nbruise; no cutting fins, or wings with nails, no prickles, no sword, no\nelectric discharge, no poison, no talons, no beak, no teeth. Yet he is\nof all creatures the most formidably armed.\n\nWhat, then, is the devil-fish? It is the sea vampire.\n\nThe swimmer who, attracted by the beauty of the spot, ventures among\nbreakers in the open sea, where the still waters hide the splendours of\nthe deep, or in the hollows of unfrequented rocks, in unknown caverns\nabounding in sea plants, testacea, and crustacea, under the deep portals\nof the ocean, runs the risk of meeting it. If that fate should be yours,\nbe not curious, but fly. The intruder enters there dazzled; but quits\nthe spot in terror.\n\nThis frightful apparition, which is always possible among the rocks in\nthe open sea, is a greyish form which undulates in the water. It is of\nthe thickness of a man's arm, and in length nearly five feet. Its\noutline is ragged. Its form resembles an umbrella closed, and without\nhandle. This irregular mass advances slowly towards you. Suddenly it\nopens, and eight radii issue abruptly from around a face with two eyes.\nThese radii are alive: their undulation is like lambent flames; they\nresemble, when opened, the spokes of a wheel, of four or five feet in\ndiameter. A terrible expansion! It springs upon its prey.\n\nThe devil-fish harpoons its victim.\n\nIt winds around the sufferer, covering and entangling him in its long\nfolds. Underneath it is yellow; above, a dull, earthy hue: nothing could\nrender that inexplicable shade dust coloured. Its form is spider-like,\nbut its tints are like those of the chamelion. When irritated it becomes\nviolet. Its most horrible characteristic is its softness.\n\nIts folds strangle, its contact paralyses.\n\nIt has an aspect like gangrened or scabrous flesh. It is a monstrous\nembodiment of disease.\n\nIt adheres closely to its prey, and cannot be torn away; a fact which is\ndue to its power of exhausting air. The eight antenn\u00c3\u00a6, large at their\nroots, diminish gradually, and end in needle-like points. Underneath\neach of these feelers range two rows of pustules, decreasing in size,\nthe largest ones near the head, the smaller at the extremities. Each row\ncontains twenty-five of these. There are, therefore, fifty pustules to\neach feeler, and the creature possesses in the whole four hundred. These\npustules are capable of acting like cupping-glasses. They are\ncartilaginous substances, cylindrical, horny, and livid. Upon the large\nspecies they diminish gradually from the diameter of a five-franc piece\nto the size of a split pea. These small tubes can be thrust out and\nwithdrawn by the animal at will. They are capable of piercing to a depth\nof more than an inch.\n\nThis sucking apparatus has all the regularity and delicacy of a\nkey-board. It stands forth at one moment and disappears the next. The\nmost perfect sensitiveness cannot equal the contractibility of these\nsuckers; always proportioned to the internal movement of the animal, and\nits exterior circumstances. The monster is endowed with the qualities of\nthe sensitive plant.\n\nThis animal is the same as those which mariners call Poulps; which\nscience designates Cephalopter\u00c3\u00a6, and which ancient legends call Krakens.\nIt is the English sailors who call them \"Devil-fish,\" and sometimes\nBloodsuckers. In the Channel Islands they are called _pieuvres_.\n\nThey are rare at Guernsey, very small at Jersey; but near the island of\nSark are numerous as well as very large.\n\nAn engraving in Sonnini's edition of Buffon represents a Cephaloptera\ncrushing a frigate. Denis Montfort, in fact, considers the Poulp, or\nOctopod, of high latitudes, strong enough to destroy a ship. Bory Saint\nVincent doubts this; but he shows that in our regions they will attack\nmen. Near Brecq-Hou, in Sark, they show a cave where a devil-fish a few\nyears since seized and drowned a lobster-fisher. Peron and Lamarck are\nin error in their belief that the \"poulp\" having no fins cannot swim. He\nwho writes these lines has seen with his own eyes, at Sark, in the\ncavern called the Boutiques, a pieuvre swimming and pursuing a bather.\nWhen captured and killed, this specimen was found to be four English\nfeet broad, and it was possible to count its four hundred suckers. The\nmonster thrust them out convulsively in the agony of death.\n\nAccording to Denis Montfort, one of those observers whose marvellous\nintuition sinks or raises them to the level of magicians, the poulp is\nalmost endowed with the passions of man: it has its hatreds. In fact, in\nthe Absolute to be hideous is to hate.\n\nHideousness struggles under the natural law of elimination, which\nnecessarily renders it hostile.\n\nWhen swimming, the devil-fish rests, so to speak, in its sheath. It\nswims with all its parts drawn close. It may be likened to a sleeve sewn\nup with a closed fist within. The protuberance, which is the head,\npushes the water aside and advances with a vague undulatory movement.\nIts two eyes, though large, are indistinct, being of the colour of the\nwater.\n\nWhen in ambush, or seeking its prey, it retires into itself, grows\nsmaller and condenses itself. It is then scarcely distinguishable in the\nsubmarine twilight.\n\nAt such times, it looks like a mere ripple in the water. It resembles\nanything except a living creature.\n\nThe devil-fish is crafty. When its victim is unsuspicious, it opens\nsuddenly.\n\nA glutinous mass, endowed with a malignant will, what can be more\nhorrible?\n\nIt is in the most beautiful azure depths of the limpid water that this\nhideous, voracious polyp delights. It always conceals itself, a fact\nwhich increases its terrible associations. When they are seen, it is\nalmost invariably after they have been captured.\n\nAt night, however, and particularly in the hot season, it becomes\nphosphorescent. These horrible creatures have their passions; their\nsubmarine nuptials. Then it adorns itself, burns and illumines; and from\nthe height of some rock, it may be seen in the deep obscurity of the\nwaves below, expanding with a pale irradiation--a spectral sun.\n\nThe devil-fish not only swims, it walks. It is partly fish, partly\nreptile. It crawls upon the bed of the sea. At these times, it makes use\nof its eight feelers, and creeps along in the fashion of a species of\nswift-moving caterpillar.\n\nIt has no blood, no bones, no flesh. It is soft and flabby; a skin with\nnothing inside. Its eight tentacles may be turned inside out like the\nfingers of a glove.\n\nIt has a single orifice in the centre of its radii, which appears at\nfirst to be neither the vent nor the mouth. It is, in fact, both one and\nthe other. The orifice performs a double function. The entire creature\nis cold.\n\nThe jelly-fish of the Mediterranean is repulsive. Contact with that\nanimated gelatinous substance which envelopes the bather, in which the\nhands sink, and the nails scratch ineffectively; which can be torn\nwithout killing it, and which can be plucked off without entirely\nremoving it--that fluid and yet tenacious creature which slips through\nthe fingers, is disgusting; but no horror can equal the sudden\napparition of the devil-fish, that Medusa with its eight serpents.\n\nNo grasp is like the sudden strain of the cephaloptera.\n\nIt is with the sucking apparatus that it attacks. The victim is\noppressed by a vacuum drawing at numberless points: it is not a clawing\nor a biting, but an indescribable scarification. A tearing of the flesh\nis terrible, but less terrible than a sucking of the blood. Claws are\nharmless compared with the horrible action of these natural air-cups.\nThe talons of the wild beast enter into your flesh; but with the\ncephaloptera it is you who enter into the creature. The muscles swell,\nthe fibres of the body are contorted, the skin cracks under the\nloathsome oppression, the blood spurts out and mingles horribly with the\nlymph of the monster, which clings to its victim by innumerable hideous\nmouths. The hydra incorporates itself with the man; the man becomes one\nwith the hydra. The spectre lies upon you: the tiger can only devour\nyou; the devil-fish, horrible, sucks your life-blood away. He draws you\nto him, and into himself; while bound down, glued to the ground,\npowerless, you feel yourself gradually emptied into this horrible pouch,\nwhich is the monster itself.\n\nThese strange animals, Science, in accordance with its habit of\nexcessive caution even in the face of facts, at first rejects as\nfabulous; then she decides to observe them; then she dissects,\nclassifies, catalogues, and labels; then procures specimens, and\nexhibits them in glass cases in museums. They enter then into her\nnomenclature; are designated mollusks, invertebrata, radiata: she\ndetermines their position in the animal world a little above the\ncalamaries, a little below the cuttle-fish; she finds for these hydras\nof the sea an analogous creature in fresh water called the argyronecte:\nshe divides them into great, medium, and small kinds; she admits more\nreadily the existence of the small than of the large species, which is,\nhowever, the tendency of science in all countries, for she is by nature\nmore microscopic than telescopic. She regards them from the point of\nview of their construction, and calls them Cephaloptera; counts their\nantenn\u00c3\u00a6, and calls them Octopedes. This done, she leaves them. Where\nscience drops them, philosophy takes them up.\n\nPhilosophy in her turn studies these creatures. She goes both less far\nand further. She does not dissect, but meditate. Where the scalpel has\nlaboured, she plunges the hypothesis. She seeks the final cause. Eternal\nperplexity of the thinker. These creatures disturb his ideas of the\nCreator. They are hideous surprises. They are the death's-head at the\nfeast of contemplation. The philosopher determines their characteristics\nin dread. They are the concrete forms of evil. What attitude can he take\ntowards this treason of creation against herself? To whom can he look\nfor the solution of these riddles? The Possible is a terrible matrix.\nMonsters are mysteries in their concrete form. Portions of shade issue\nfrom the mass, and something within detaches itself, rolls, floats,\ncondenses, borrows elements from the ambient darkness, becomes subject\nto unknown polarisations, assumes a kind of life, furnishes itself with\nsome unimagined form from the obscurity, and with some terrible spirit\nfrom the miasma, and wanders ghostlike among living things. It is as if\nnight itself assumed the forms of animals. But for what good? with what\nobject? Thus we come again to the eternal questioning.\n\nThese animals are indeed phantoms as much as monsters. They are proved\nand yet improbable. Their fate is to exist in spite of _\u00c3\u00a0 priori_\nreasonings. They are the amphibia of the shore which separates life from\ndeath. Their unreality makes their existence puzzling. They touch the\nfrontier of man's domain and people the region of chimeras. We deny the\npossibility of the vampire, and the cephaloptera appears. Their swarming\nis a certainty which disconcerts our confidence. Optimism, which is\nnevertheless in the right, becomes silenced in their presence. They form\nthe visible extremity of the dark circles. They mark the transition of\nour reality into another. They seem to belong to that commencement of\nterrible life which the dreamer sees confusedly through the loophole of\nthe night.\n\nThat multiplication of monsters, first in the Invisible, then in the\nPossible, has been suspected, perhaps perceived by magi and philosophers\nin their austere ecstasies and profound contemplations. Hence the\nconjecture of a material hell. The demon is simply the invisible tiger.\nThe wild beast which devours souls has been presented to the eyes of\nhuman beings by St. John, and by Dante in his vision of Hell.\n\nIf, in truth, the invisible circles of creation continue indefinitely,\nif after one there is yet another, and so forth in illimitable\nprogression; if that chain, which for our part we are resolved to doubt,\nreally exist, the cephaloptera at one extremity proves Satan at the\nother. It is certain that the wrongdoer at one end proves the existence\nof wrong at the other.\n\nEvery malignant creature, like every perverted intelligence, is a\nsphinx. A terrible sphinx propounding a terrible riddle; the riddle of\nthe existence of Evil.\n\nIt is this perfection of evil which has sometimes sufficed to incline\npowerful intellects to a faith in the duality of the Deity, towards that\nterrible bifrons of the Manich\u00c3\u00a6ans.\n\nA piece of silk stolen during the last war from the palace of the\nEmperor of China represents a shark eating a crocodile, who is eating a\nserpent, who is devouring an eagle, who is preying on a swallow, who in\nhis turn is eating a caterpillar.\n\nAll nature which is under our observation is thus alternately devouring\nand devoured. The prey prey on each other.\n\nLearned men, however, who are also philosophers, and therefore optimists\nin their view of creation, find, or believe they find, an explanation.\nAmong others, Bonnet of Geneva, that mysterious exact thinker, who was\nopposed to Buffon, as in later times Geoffrey St. Hilaire has been to\nCuvier, was struck with the idea of the final object. His notions may be\nsummed up thus: universal death necessitates universal sepulture; the\ndevourers are the sextons of the system of nature. All created things\nenter into and form the elements of other. To decay is to nourish. Such\nis the terrible law from which not even man himself escapes.\n\nIn our world of twilight this fatal order of things produces monsters.\nYou ask for what purpose. We find the solution here.\n\nBut _is_ this the solution? Is this the answer to our questionings? And\nif so, why not some different order of things? Thus the question\nreturns.\n\nLet us live: be it so.\n\nBut let us endeavour that death shall be progress. Let us aspire to an\nexistence in which these mysteries shall be made clear. Let us follow\nthat conscience which leads us thither.\n\nFor let us never forget that the highest is only attained through the\nhigh.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nANOTHER KIND OF SEA-COMBAT\n\n\nSuch was the creature in whose power Gilliatt had fallen for some\nminutes.\n\nThe monster was the inhabitant of the grotto; the terrible genii of the\nplace. A kind of sombre demon of the water.\n\nAll the splendours of the cavern existed for it alone.\n\nOn the day of the previous month when Gilliatt had first penetrated into\nthe grotto, the dark outline, vaguely perceived by him in the ripples of\nthe secret waters, was this monster. It was here in its home.\n\nWhen entering for the second time into the cavern in pursuit of the\ncrab, he had observed the crevice in which he supposed that the crab had\ntaken refuge, the pieuvre was there lying in wait for prey.\n\nIs it possible to imagine that secret ambush?\n\nNo bird would brood, no egg would burst to life, no flower would dare to\nopen, no breast to give milk, no heart to love, no spirit to soar, under\nthe influence of that apparition of evil watching with sinister patience\nin the dusk.\n\nGilliatt had thrust his arm deep into the opening; the monster had\nsnapped at it. It held him fast, as the spider holds the fly.\n\nHe was in the water up to his belt; his naked feet clutching the\nslippery roundness of the huge stones at the bottom; his right arm bound\nand rendered powerless by the flat coils of the long tentacles of the\ncreature, and his body almost hidden under the folds and cross folds of\nthis horrible bandage.\n\nOf the eight arms of the devil-fish three adhered to the rock, while\nfive encircled Gilliatt. In this way, clinging to the granite on the one\nhand, and with the other to its human prey, it enchained him to the\nrock. Two hundred and fifty suckers were upon him, tormenting him with\nagony and loathing. He was grasped by gigantic hands, the fingers of\nwhich were each nearly a yard long, and furnished inside with living\nblisters eating into the flesh.\n\nAs we have said, it is impossible to tear oneself from the folds of the\ndevil-fish. The attempt ends only in a firmer grasp. The monster clings\nwith more determined force. Its effort increases with that of its\nvictim; every struggle produces a tightening of its ligatures.\n\nGilliatt had but one resource, his knife.\n\nHis left hand only was free; but the reader knows with what power he\ncould use it. It might have been said that he had two right hands.\n\nHis open knife was in his hand.\n\nThe antenna of the devil-fish cannot be cut; it is a leathery substance\nimpossible to divide with the knife, it slips under the edge; its\nposition in attack also is such that to cut it would be to wound the\nvictim's own flesh.\n\nThe creature is formidable, but there is a way of resisting it. The\nfishermen of Sark know this, as does any one who has seen them execute\ncertain movements in the sea. The porpoises know it also; they have a\nway of biting the cuttle-fish which decapitates it. Hence the frequent\nsight on the sea of pen-fish, poulps, and cuttle-fish without heads.\n\nThe cephaloptera, in fact, is only vulnerable through the head.\n\nGilliatt was not ignorant of this fact.\n\nHe had never seen a devil-fish of this size. His first encounter was\nwith one of the larger species. Another would have been powerless with\nterror.\n\nWith the devil-fish, as with a furious bull, there is a certain moment\nin the conflict which must be seized. It is the instant when the bull\nlowers the neck; it is the instant when the devil-fish advances its\nhead. The movement is rapid. He who loses that moment is destroyed.\n\nThe things we have described occupied only a few moments. Gilliatt,\nhowever, felt the increasing power of its innumerable suckers.\n\nThe monster is cunning; it tries first to stupefy its prey. It seizes\nand then pauses awhile.\n\nGilliatt grasped his knife; the sucking increased.\n\nHe looked at the monster, which seemed to look at him.\n\nSuddenly it loosened from the rock its sixth antenna, and darting it at\nhim, seized him by the left arm.\n\nAt the same moment it advanced its head with a violent movement. In one\nsecond more its mouth would have fastened on his breast. Bleeding in the\nsides, and with his two arms entangled, he would have been a dead man.\n\nBut Gillian was watchful. He avoided the antenna, and at the moment when\nthe monster darted forward to fasten on his breast, he struck it with\nthe knife clenched in his left hand. There were two convulsions in\nopposite directions; that of the devil-fish and that of its prey. The\nmovement was rapid as a double flash of lightnings.\n\nHe had plunged the blade of his knife into the flat slimy substance, and\nby a rapid movement, like the flourish of a whip in the air, describing\na circle round the two eyes, he wrenched the head off as a man would\ndraw a tooth.\n\nThe struggle was ended. The folds relaxed. The monster dropped away,\nlike the slow detaching of bands. The four hundred suckers, deprived of\ntheir sustaining power, dropped at once from the man and the rock. The\nmass sank to the bottom of the water.\n\nBreathless with the struggle, Gilliatt could perceive upon the stones at\nhis feet two shapeless, slimy heaps, the head on one side, the remainder\nof the monster on the other.\n\nFearing, nevertheless, some convulsive return of his agony, he recoiled\nto avoid the reach of the dreaded tentacles.\n\nBut the monster was quite dead.\n\nGilliatt closed his knife.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nNOTHING IS HIDDEN, NOTHING LOST\n\n\nIt was time that he killed the devil-fish. He was almost suffocated. His\nright arm and his chest were purple. Numberless little swellings were\ndistinguishable upon them; the blood flowed from them here and there.\nThe remedy for these wounds is sea-water. Gilliatt plunged into it,\nrubbing himself at the same time with the palms of his hands. The\nswellings disappeared under the friction.\n\nBy stepping further into the waters he had, without perceiving,\napproached to the species of recess already observed by him near the\ncrevice where he had been attacked by the devil-fish.\n\nThis recess stretched obliquely under the great walls of the cavern, and\nwas dry. The large pebbles which had become heaped up there had raised\nthe bottom above the level of ordinary tides. The entrance was a rather\nlarge elliptical arch; a man could enter by stooping. The green light of\nthe submarine grotto penetrated into it and lighted it feebly.\n\nIt happened that, while hastily rubbing his skin, Gilliatt raised his\neyes mechanically.\n\nHe was able to see far into the cavern.\n\nHe shuddered.\n\nHe fancied that he perceived, in the furthest depth of the dusky recess,\nsomething smiling.\n\nGilliatt had never heard the word \"hallucination,\" but he was familiar\nwith the idea. Those mysterious encounters with the invisible, which,\nfor the sake of avoiding the difficulty of explaining them, we call\nhallucinations, are in nature. Illusions or realities, visions are a\nfact. He who has the gift will see them. Gilliatt, as we have said, was\na dreamer. He had, at times, the faculty of a seer. It was not in vain\nthat he had spent his days in musing among solitary places.\n\nHe imagined himself the dupe of one of those mirages which he had more\nthan once beheld when in his dreamy moods.\n\nThe opening was somewhat in the shape of a chalk-burner's oven. It was a\nlow niche with projections like basket-handles. Its abrupt groins\ncontracted gradually as far as the extremity of the crypt, where the\nheaps of round stones and the rocky roof joined.\n\nGilliatt entered, and lowering his head, advanced towards the object in\nthe distance.\n\nThere was indeed something smiling.\n\nIt was a death's head; but it was not only the head. There was the\nentire skeleton. A complete human skeleton was lying in the cavern.\n\nIn such a position a bold man will continue his researches.\n\nGilliatt cast his eyes around. He was surrounded by a multitude of\ncrabs. The multitude did not stir. They were but empty shells.\n\nThese groups were scattered here and there among the masses of pebbles\nin irregular constellations.\n\nGilliatt, having his eyes fixed elsewhere, had walked among them without\nperceiving them.\n\nAt this extremity of the crypt, where he had now penetrated, there was a\nstill greater heap of remains. It was a confused mass of legs, antenn\u00c3\u00a6,\nand mandibles. Claws stood wide open; bony shells lay still under their\nbristling prickles; some reversed showed their livid hollows. The heap\nwas like a _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_ of besiegers who had fallen, and lay massed together.\n\nThe skeleton was partly buried in this heap.\n\nUnder this confused mass of scales and tentacles, the eye perceived the\ncranium with its furrows, the vertebr\u00c3\u00a6, the thigh bones, the tibias, and\nthe long-jointed finger bones with their nails. The frame of the ribs\nwas filled with crabs. Some heart had once beat there. The green mould\nof the sea had settled round the sockets of the eyes. Limpets had left\ntheir slime upon the bony nostrils. For the rest, there were not in this\ncave within the rocks either sea-gulls, or weeds, or a breath of air.\nAll was still. The teeth grinned.\n\nThe sombre side of laughter is that strange mockery of expression which\nis peculiar to a human skull.\n\nThis marvellous palace of the deep, inlaid and incrusted with all the\ngems of the sea, had at length revealed and told its secret. It was a\nsavage haunt; the devil-fish inhabited it; it was also a tomb, in which\nthe body of a man reposed.\n\nThe skeleton and the creatures around it oscillated vaguely in the\nreflections of the subterranean water which trembled upon the roof and\nwall. The horrible multitude of crabs looked as if finishing their\nrepast. These crustacea seemed to be devouring the carcase. Nothing\ncould be more strange than the aspect of the dead vermin upon their dead\nprey.\n\nGilliatt had beneath his eyes the storehouse of the devil-fish.\n\nIt was a dismal sight. The crabs had devoured the man: the devil-fish\nhad devoured the crabs.\n\nThere were no remains of clothing anywhere visible. The man must have\nbeen seized naked.\n\nGilliatt, attentively examining, began to remove the shells from the\nskeleton. What had this man been? The body was admirably dissected; it\nlooked as if prepared for the study of anatomy; all the flesh was\nstripped; not a muscle remained; not a bone was missing. If Gilliatt had\nbeen learned in science, he might have demonstrated the fact. The\nperiostea, denuded of their covering, were white and smooth, as if they\nhad been polished. But for some green mould of sea-mosses here and\nthere, they would have been like ivory. The cartilaginous divisions were\ndelicately inlaid and arranged. The tomb sometimes produces this dismal\nmosaic work.\n\nThe body was, as it were, interred under the heap of dead crabs.\nGilliatt disinterred it.\n\nSuddenly he stooped, and examined more closely.\n\nHe had perceived around the vertebral column a sort of belt.\n\nIt was a leathern girdle, which had evidently been worn buckled upon the\nwaist of the man when alive.\n\nThe leather was moist; the buckle rusty.\n\nGilliatt pulled the girdle; the vertebra of the skeleton resisted, and\nhe was compelled to break through them in order to remove it. A crust of\nsmall shells had begun to form upon it.\n\nHe felt it, and found a hard substance within, apparently of square\nform. It was useless to endeavour to unfasten the buckle, so he cut the\nleather with his knife.\n\nThe girdle contained a little iron box and some pieces of gold. Gilliatt\ncounted twenty guineas.\n\nThe iron box was an old sailor's tobacco-box, opening and shutting with\na spring. It was very tight and rusty. The spring being completely\noxidised would not work.\n\nOnce more the knife served Gilliatt in a difficulty. A pressure with the\npoint of the blade caused the lid to fly up.\n\nThe box was open.\n\nThere was nothing inside but pieces of paper.\n\nA little roll of very thin sheets, folded in four, was fitted in the\nbottom of the box. They were damp, but not injured. The box,\nhermetically sealed, had preserved them. Gilliatt unfolded them.\n\nThey were three bank-notes of one thousand pounds sterling each; making\ntogether seventy-five thousand francs.\n\nGilliatt folded them again, replaced them in the box, taking advantage\nof the space which remained to add the twenty guineas; and then reclosed\nthe box as well as he could.\n\nNext he examined the girdle.\n\nThe leather, which had originally been polished outside, was rough\nwithin. Upon this tawny ground some letters had been traced in black\nthick ink. Gilliatt deciphered them, and read the words, \"Sieur Clubin.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE FATAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIX INCHES AND TWO FEET\n\n\nGilliatt replaced the box in the girdle, and placed the girdle in the\npocket of his trousers.\n\nHe left the skeleton among the crabs, with the remains of the devil-fish\nbeside it.\n\nWhile he had been occupied with the devil-fish and the skeleton, the\nrising tide had submerged the entrance to the cave. He was only enabled\nto leave it by plunging under the arched entrance. He got through\nwithout difficulty; for he knew the entrance well, and was master of\nthese gymnastics in the sea.\n\nIt is easy to understand the drama which had taken place there during\nthe ten weeks preceding. One monster had preyed upon another; the\ndevil-fish had seized Clubin.\n\nThese two embodiments of treachery had met in the inexorable darkness.\nThere had been an encounter at the bottom of the sea between these two\ncompounds of mystery and watchfulness; the monster had destroyed the\nman: a horrible fulfilment of justice.\n\nThe crab feeds on carrion, the devil-fish on crabs. The devil-fish\nseizes as it passes any swimming animal--an otter, a dog, a man if it\ncan--sucks the blood, and leaves the body at the bottom of the water.\nThe crabs are the spider-formed scavengers of the sea. Putrefying flesh\nattracts them; they crowd round it, devour the body, and are in their\nturn consumed by the devil-fish. Dead creatures disappear in the crab,\nthe crab disappears in the pieuvre. This is the law which we have\nalready pointed out.\n\nThe devil-fish had laid hold of him, and drowned him. Some wave had\ncarried his body into the cave, and deposited it at the extremity of the\ninner cavern, where Gilliatt had discovered it.\n\nHe returned searching among the rocks for sea-urchins and limpets. He\nhad no desire for crabs; to have eaten them now would have seemed to him\nlike feeding upon human flesh.\n\nFor the rest, he thought of nothing but of eating what he could before\nstarting. Nothing now interposed to prevent his departure. Great\ntempests are always followed by a calm, which lasts sometimes several\ndays. There was, therefore, no danger from the sea. Gilliatt had\nresolved to leave the rocks on the following day. It was important, on\naccount of the tide, to keep the barrier between the two Douvres during\nthe night, but he intended to remove it at daybreak, to push the sloop\nout to sea, and set sail for St. Sampson. The light breeze which was\nblowing came from the south-west, which was precisely the wind which he\nwould want.\n\nIt was in the first quarter of the moon, in the month of May; the days\nwere long.\n\nWhen Gilliatt, having finished his wanderings among the rocks, and\nappeased his appetite to some extent, returned to the passage between\nthe two Douvres, where he had left the sloop, the sun had set, the\ntwilight was increased by that pale light which comes from a crescent\nmoon; the tide had attained its height, and was beginning to ebb. The\nfunnel standing upright above the sloop had been covered by the foam\nduring the tempest with a coating of salt which glittered white in the\nlight of the moon.\n\nThis circumstance reminded Gilliatt that the storm had inundated the\nsloop, both with surf and rain-water, and that if he meant to start in\nthe morning, it would be necessary to bail it out.\n\nBefore leaving to go in quest of crabs, he had ascertained that it had\nabout six inches of water in the hold. The scoop which he used for the\npurpose would, he thought, be sufficient for throwing the water\noverboard.\n\nOn arriving at the barrier, Gilliatt was struck with terror. There were\nnearly two feet of water in the sloop. A terrible discovery; the bark\nhad sprung a leak.\n\nShe had been making water gradually during his absence. Burdened as she\nwas, two feet of water was a perilous addition. A little more, and she\nmust inevitably founder. If he had returned but an hour later, he would\nprobably have found nothing above water but the funnel and the mast.\n\nThere was not a minute to be lost in deliberation. It was absolutely\nnecessary to find the leakage, stop it, and then empty the vessel, or at\nall events, lighten it. The pumps of the Durande had been lost in the\nbreak-up of the wreck. He was reduced to use the scoop of the bark.\n\nTo find the leak was the most urgent necessity.\n\nGilliatt set to work immediately, and without even giving himself time\nto dress. He shivered; but he no longer felt either hunger or cold.\n\nThe water continued to gain upon his vessel. Fortunately there was no\nwind. The slightest swell would have been fatal.\n\nThe moon went down.\n\nBent low, and plunged in the water deeper than his waist he groped about\nfor a long time. He discovered the mischief at last.\n\nDuring the gale, at the critical moment when the sloop had swerved, the\nstrong bark had bumped and grazed rather violently on the rocks. One of\nthe projections of the Little Douvre had made a fracture in the\nstarboard side of the hull.\n\nThe leak unluckily--it might almost have been said, maliciously--had\nbeen made near the joint of the two riders, a fact which, joined with\nthe fury of the hurricane, had prevented him perceiving it during his\ndark and rapid survey in the height of the storm.\n\nThe fracture was alarming on account of its size; but fortunately,\nalthough the vessel was sunk lower than usual by the weight of water, it\nwas still above the ordinary water-line.\n\nAt the moment when the accident had occurred, the waves had rolled\nheavily into the defile, and had flooded through the breach; and the\nvessel had sunk a few inches under the additional weight, so that, even\nafter the subsidence of the water, the weight having raised the\nwater-line, had kept the hole still under the surface. Hence the\nimminence of the danger. But if he could succeed in stopping the leak,\nhe could empty the sloop; the hole once staunched, the vessel would rise\nto its usual water-line, the fracture would be above water, and in this\nposition the repair would be easy, or at least possible. He had still,\nas we have already said, his carpenters' tools in good condition.\n\nBut meanwhile what uncertainty must he not endure! What perils, what\nchances of accidents! He heard the water rising inexorably. One shock,\nand all would have perished. What misery seemed in store for him.\nPerhaps his endeavours were even now too late.\n\nHe reproached himself bitterly. He thought that he ought to have seen\nthe damage immediately. The six inches of water in the hold ought to\nhave suggested it to him. He had been stupid enough to attribute these\nsix inches of water to the rain and the foam. He was angry with himself\nfor having slept and eaten; he taxed himself even with his weariness,\nand almost with the storm and the dark night. All seemed to him to have\nbeen his own fault.\n\nThese bitter self-reproaches filled his mind while engaged in his\nlabour, but they did not prevent his considering well the work he was\nengaged in.\n\nThe leak had been found; that was the first step: to staunch it was the\nsecond. That was all that was possible for the moment. Joinery work\ncannot be carried on under water.\n\nIt was a favourable circumstance that the breach in the hull was in the\nspace between the two chains which held the funnel fast on the starboard\nside. The stuffing with which it was necessary to stop it could be fixed\nto these chains.\n\nThe water meanwhile was gaining. Its depth was now between two and three\nfeet; and it reached above his knees.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nDE PROFUNDIS AD ALTUM\n\n\nGilliatt had to his hand among his reserve of rigging for the sloop a\npretty large tarpaulin, furnished with long laniards at the four\ncorners.\n\nHe took this tarpaulin, made fast the two corners by the laniards to the\ntwo rings of the chains of the funnel on the same side as the leak, and\nthrew it over the gunwale. The tarpaulin hung like a sheet between the\nLittle Douvre and the bark, and sunk in the water. The pressure of the\nwater endeavouring to enter into the hold, kept it close to the hull\nupon the gap. The heavier the pressure the closer the sail adhered. It\nwas stuck by the water itself right upon the fracture. The wound of the\nbark was staunched.\n\nThe tarred canvas formed an effectual barrier between the interior of\nthe hold and the waves without. Not a drop of water entered. The leak\nwas masked, but was not stopped. It was a respite only.\n\nGilliatt took the scoop and began to bale the sloop. It was time that\nshe were lightened. The labour warmed him a little, but his weariness\nwas extreme. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that he could not\ncomplete the work of staunching the hold. He had scarcely eaten\nanything, and he had the humiliation of feeling himself exhausted.\n\nHe measured the progress of his work by the sinking of the level of\nwater below his knees. The fall was slow.\n\nMoreover, the leakage was only interrupted; the evil was moderated, not\nrepaired. The tarpaulin pushed into the gap began to bulge inside;\nlooking as if a fist were under the canvas, endeavouring to force it\nthrough. The canvas, strong and pitchy, resisted; but the swelling and\nthe tension increased; it was not certain that it would not give way,\nand at any moment the swelling might become a rent. The irruption of\nwater must then recommence.\n\nIn such a case, as the crews of vessels in distress know well, there is\nno other remedy than stuffing. The sailors take rags of every kind which\nthey can find at hand, everything, in fact, which in their language is\ncalled \"service;\" and with this they push the bulging sail-cloth as far\nas they can into the leak.\n\nOf this \"service,\" Gilliatt had none. All the rags and tow which he had\nstored up had been used in his operations, or carried away by the storm.\n\nIf necessary, he might possibly have been able to find some remains by\nsearching among the rocks. The sloop was sufficiently lightened for him\nto leave it with safety for a quarter of an hour; but how could he make\nthis search without a light? The darkness was complete. There was no\nlonger any moon; nothing but the starry sky. He had no dry tow with\nwhich to make a match, no tallow to make a candle, no fire to light one,\nno lantern to shelter it from the wind. In the sloop and among the rocks\nall was confused and indistinct. He could hear the water lapping against\nthe wounded hull, but he could not even see the crack. It was with his\nhands that he had ascertained the bulging of the tarpaulin. In that\ndarkness it was impossible to make any useful search for rags of canvas\nor pieces of tow scattered among the breakers. Who could glean these\nwaifs and strays without being able to see his path? Gilliatt looked\nsorrowfully at the sky; all those stars, he thought, and yet no light!\n\nThe water in the bark having diminished, the pressure from without\nincreased. The bulging of the canvas became larger, and was still\nincreasing, like a frightful abscess ready to burst. The situation,\nwhich had been improved for a short time, began to be threatening.\n\nSome means of stopping it effectually was absolutely necessary. He had\nnothing left but his clothes, which he had stretched to dry upon the\nprojecting rocks of the Little Douvre.\n\nHe hastened to fetch them, and placed them upon the gunwale of the\nsloop.\n\nThen he took his tarpaulin overcoat, and kneeling in the water, thrust\nit into the crevice, and pushing the swelling of the sail outward,\nemptied it of water. To the tarpaulin coat he added the sheepskin, then\nhis Guernsey shirt, and then his jacket. The hole received them all. He\nhad nothing left but his sailor's trousers, which he took off, and\npushed in with the other articles. This enlarged and strengthened the\nstuffing.\n\nThe stopper was made, and it appeared to be sufficient.\n\nThese clothes passed partly through the gap, the sail-cloth outside\nenveloping them. The sea making an effort to enter, pressed against the\nobstacle, spread it over the gap, and blocked it. It was a sort of\nexterior compression.\n\nInside, the centre only of the bulging having been driven out, there\nremained all around the gap and the stuffing just thrust through a sort\nof circular pad formed by the tarpaulin, which was rendered still firmer\nby the irregularities of the fracture with which it had become\nentangled.\n\nThe leak was staunched, but nothing could be more precarious. Those\nsharp splinters of the gap which fixed the tarpaulin might pierce it and\nmake holes, by which the water would enter; while he would not even\nperceive it in the darkness. There was little probability of the\nstoppage lasting until daylight. Gilliatt's anxiety changed its form;\nbut he felt it increasing at the same time that he found his strength\nleaving him.\n\nHe had again set to work to bale out the hold, but his arms, in spite of\nall his efforts, could scarcely lift a scoopfull of water. He was naked\nand shivering. He felt as if the end were now at hand.\n\nOne possible chance flashed across his mind. There might be a sail in\nsight. A fishing-boat which should by any accident be in the\nneighbourhood of the Douvres, might come to his assistance. The moment\nhad arrived when a helpmate was absolutely necessary. With a man and a\nlantern all might yet be saved. If there were two persons, one might\neasily bale the vessel. Since the leak was temporarily staunched, as\nsoon as she could be relieved of this burden, she would rise, and regain\nher ordinary water-line. The leak would then be above the surface of the\nwater, the repairs would be practicable, and he would be able\nimmediately to replace the stuff by a piece of planking, and thus\nsubstitute for the temporary stoppage a complete repair. If not, it\nwould be necessary to wait till daylight--to wait the whole night long;\na delay which might prove ruinous. If by chance some ship's lantern\nshould be in sight, Gilliatt would be able to signal it from the height\nof the Great Douvre. The weather was calm, there was no wind or rolling\nsea; there was a possibility of the figure of a man being observed\nmoving against the background of the starry sky. A captain of a ship, or\neven the master of a fishing-boat, would not be at night in the waters\nof the Douvres without directing his glass upon the rock, by way of\nprecaution.\n\nGilliatt hoped that some one might perceive him.\n\nHe climbed upon the wreck, grasped the knotted rope, and mounted upon\nthe Great Douvre.\n\nNot a sail was visible around the horizon; not a boat's lantern. The\nwide expanse, as far as eye could reach, was a desert. No assistance was\npossible, and no resistance possible.\n\nGilliatt felt himself without resources; a feeling which he had not felt\nuntil then.\n\nA dark fatality was now his master. With all his labour, all his\nsuccess, all his courage, he and his bark, and its precious burden, were\nabout to become the sport of the waves. He had no other means of\ncontinuing the struggle; he became listless. How could he prevent the\ntide from returning, the water from rising, the night from continuing?\nThe temporary stoppage which he had made was his sole reliance. He had\nexhausted and stripped himself in constructing and completing it; he\ncould neither fortify nor add to it. The stopgap was such that it must\nremain as it was; and every further effort was useless. The apparatus,\nhastily constructed, was at the mercy of the waves. How would this inert\nobstacle work? It was this obstacle now, not Gilliatt, which had to\nsustain the combat, that handfull of rags, not that intelligence. The\nswell of a wave would suffice to re-open the fracture. More or less of\npressure; the whole question was comprised in that formula.\n\nAll depended upon a brute struggle between two mechanical quantities.\nHenceforth he could neither aid his auxiliary, nor stop his enemy. He\nwas no longer any other than a mere spectator of this struggle, which\nwas one for him of life or death. He who had ruled over it, a supreme\nintelligence, was at the last moment compelled to resign all to a mere\nblind resistance.\n\nNo trial, no terror that he had yet undergone, could bear comparison\nwith this.\n\nFrom the time when he had taken up his abode upon the Douvres, he had\nfound himself environed, and, as it were, possessed by solitude. This\nsolitude more than surrounded, it enveloped him. A thousand menaces at\nonce had met him face to face. The wind was always there, ready to\nbecome furious; the sea, ready to roar. There was no stopping that\nterrible mouth the wind, no imprisoning that dread monster the sea. And\nyet he had striven, he, a solitary man, had combated hand to hand with\nthe ocean, had wrestled even with the tempest.\n\nMany other anxieties, many other necessities had he made head against.\nThere was no form of distress with which he had not become familiar. He\nhad been compelled to execute great works without tools, to move vast\nburdens without aid, without science to resolve problems, without\nprovisions to find food, without bed or roof to cover it, to find\nshelter and sleep.\n\nUpon that solitary rock he had been subjected by turns to all the\nvaried and cruel tortures of nature; oftentimes a gentle mother, not\nless often a pitiless destroyer.\n\nHe had conquered his isolation, conquered hunger, conquered thirst,\nconquered cold, conquered fever, conquered labour, conquered sleep. He\nhad encountered a mighty coalition of obstacles formed to bar his\nprogress. After his privations there were the elements; after the sea\nthe tempest, after the tempest the devil-fish, after the monster the\nspectre.\n\nA dismal irony was then the end of all. Upon this rock, whence he had\nthought to arise triumphant, the spectre of Clubin had only arisen to\nmock him with a hideous smile.\n\nThe grin of the spectre was well founded. Gilliatt saw himself ruined;\nsaw himself no less than Clubin in the grasp of death.\n\nWinter, famine, fatigue, the dismemberment of the wreck, the removal of\nthe machinery, the equinoctial gale, the thunder, the monster, were all\nas nothing compared with this small fracture in a vessel's planks.\nAgainst the cold one could procure--and he had procured--fire; against\nhunger, the shell-fish of the rocks; against thirst, the rain; against\nthe difficulties of his great task, industry and energy; against the sea\nand the storm, the breakwater; against the devil-fish, the knife; but\nagainst the terrible leak he had no weapon.\n\nThe hurricane had bequeathed him this sinister farewell. The last\nstruggle, the traitorous thrust, the treacherous side blow of the\nvanquished foe. In its flight the tempest had turned and shot this arrow\nin the rear. It was the final and deadly stab of his antagonist.\n\nIt was possible to combat with the tempest, but how could he struggle\nwith that insidious enemy who now attacked him.\n\nIf the stoppage gave way, if the leak re-opened, nothing could prevent\nthe sloop foundering. It would be the bursting of the ligature of the\nartery; and once under the water with its heavy burden, no power could\nraise it. The noble struggle, with two months' Titanic labour, ended\nthen in annihilation. To recommence would be impossible. He had neither\nforge nor materials. At daylight, in all probability, he was about to\nsee all his work sink slowly and irrecoverably into the gulf. Terrible,\nto feel that sombre power beneath. The sea snatched his prize from his\nhands.\n\nWith his bark engulfed, no fate awaited him but to perish of hunger and\ncold, like the poor shipwrecked sailor on \"The Man Rock.\"\n\nDuring two long months the intelligences which hover invisibly over the\nworld had been the spectators of these things; on one hand the wide\nexpanse, the waves, the winds, the lightnings, the meteors; on the other\na man. On one hand the sea, on the other a human mind; on the one hand\nthe infinite, on the other an atom.\n\nThe battle had been fierce, and behold the abortive issue of these\nprodigies of valour.\n\nThus did this heroism without parallel end in powerlessness; thus ended\nin despair that formidable struggle; that struggle of a nothing against\nall; that Iliad against one.\n\nGilliatt gazed wildly into space.\n\nHe had no clothing. He stood naked in the midst of that immensity.\n\nThen overwhelmed by the sense of that unknown infinity, like one\nbewildered by a strange persecution, confronting the shadows of night,\nin the presence of that impenetrable darkness, in the midst of the\nmurmur of the waves, the swell, the foam, the breeze, under the clouds,\nunder that vast diffusion of force, under that mysterious firmament of\nwings, of stars, of gulfs, having around him and beneath him the ocean,\nabove him the constellations, under the great unfathomable deep, he\nsank, gave up the struggle, lay down upon the rock, his face towards the\nstars, humbled, and uplifting his joined hands towards the terrible\ndepths, he cried aloud, \"Have mercy.\"\n\nWeighed down to earth by that immensity, he prayed.\n\nHe was there alone, in the darkness upon the rock, in the midst of that\nsea, stricken down with exhaustion like one smitten by lightning, naked\nlike the gladiator in the circus, save that for circus he had the vast\nhorizon, instead of wild beasts the shadows of darkness, instead of the\nfaces of the crowd the eyes of the Unknown, instead of the Vestals the\nstars, instead of C\u00c3\u00a6sar the All-powerful.\n\nHis whole being seemed to dissolve in cold, fatigue, powerlessness,\nprayer, and darkness, and his eyes closed.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE APPEAL IS HEARD\n\n\nSome hours passed.\n\nThe sun rose in an unclouded sky.\n\nIts first ray shone upon a motionless form upon the Great Douvre. It was\nGilliatt.\n\nHe was still outstretched upon the rock.\n\nHe was naked, cold, and stiff; but he did not shiver. His closed eyelids\nwere wan. It would have been difficult for a beholder to say whether the\nform before him was not a corpse.\n\nThe sun seemed to look upon him.\n\nIf he were not dead, he was already so near death that the slightest\ncold wind would have sufficed to extinguish life.\n\nThe wind began to breathe, warm and animating: it was the opening breath\nof May.\n\nMeanwhile the sun ascended in the deep blue sky; its rays, less\nhorizontal, flushed the sky. Its light became warmth. It enveloped the\nslumbering form.\n\nGilliatt moved not. If he breathed, it was only that feeble respiration\nwhich could scarcely tarnish the surface of a mirror.\n\nThe sun continued its ascent; its rays striking less and less obliquely\nupon the naked man. The gentle breeze which had been merely tepid became\nhot.\n\nThe rigid and naked body remained still without movement; but the skin\nseemed less livid.\n\nThe sun, approaching the zenith, shone almost perpendicularly upon the\nplateau of the Douvres. A flood of light descended from the heavens; the\nvast reflection from the glassy sea increased its splendour: the rock\nitself imbibed the rays and warmed the sleeper.\n\nA sigh raised his breast.\n\nHe lived.\n\nThe sun continued its gentle offices. The wind, which was already the\nbreath of summer and of noon, approached him like loving lips that\nbreathed upon him softly.\n\nGilliatt moved.\n\nThe peaceful calm upon the sea was perfect. Its murmur was like the\ndroning of the nurse beside the sleeping infant. The rock seemed cradled\nin the waves.\n\nThe sea-birds, who knew that form, fluttered above it; not with their\nold wild astonishment, but with a sort of fraternal tenderness. They\nuttered plaintive cries: they seemed to be calling to him. A sea-mew,\nwho no doubt knew him, was tame enough to come near him. It began to caw\nas if speaking to him. The sleeper seemed not to hear. The bird hopped\nupon his shoulder, and pecked his lips softly.\n\nGilliatt opened his eyes.\n\nThe birds dispersed, chattering wildly.\n\nGilliatt arose, stretched himself like a roused lion, ran to the edge\nof the platform, and looked down into the space between the two Douvres.\n\nThe sloop was there, intact; the stoppage had held out; the sea had\nprobably disturbed it but little.\n\nAll was saved.\n\nHe was no longer weary. His powers had returned. His swoon had ended in\na deep sleep.\n\nHe descended and baled out the sloop, emptied the hold, raised the\nleakage above the water-line, dressed himself, ate, drank some water,\nand was joyful.\n\nThe gap in the side of his vessel, examined in broad daylight, proved to\nrequire more labour than he had thought. It was a serious fracture. The\nentire day was not too much for its repair.\n\nAt daybreak on the morrow, after removing the barrier and re-opening the\nentrance to the defile, dressed in the tattered clothing which had\nserved to stop the leak, having about him Clubin's girdle and the\nseventy-five thousand francs, standing erect in the sloop, now repaired,\nby the side of the machinery which he had rescued, with a favourable\nbreeze and a good sea, Gilliatt pushed off from the Douvres.\n\nHe put the sloop's head for Guernsey.\n\nAt the moment of his departure from the rocks, any one who had been\nthere might have heard him singing, in an undertone, the air of \"Bonnie\nDundee.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART III.--D\u00c3\u0089RUCHETTE\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\nNIGHT AND THE MOON\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE HARBOUR BELL\n\n\nThe St. Sampson of the present day is almost a city; the St. Sampson of\nforty years since was almost a village.\n\nWhen the winter evenings were ended and spring had come, the inhabitants\nwere not long out of bed after sundown. St. Sampson was an ancient\nparish which had long been accustomed to the sound of the curfew-bell,\nand which had a traditional habit of blowing out the candle at an early\nhour. Those old Norman villages are famous for early roosting, and the\nvillagers are generally great rearers of poultry.\n\nThe people of St. Sampson, except a few rich families among the\ntownsfolk, are also a population of quarriers and carpenters. The port\nis a port of ship repairing. The quarrying of stone and the fashioning\nof timber go on all day long; here the labourer with the pickaxe, there\nthe workman with the mallet. At night they sink with fatigue, and sleep\nlike lead. Rude labours bring heavy slumbers.\n\nOne evening, in the commencement of the month of May, after watching the\ncrescent moon for some instants through the trees, and listening to the\nstep of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, walking alone in the cool air in the garden of the\nBrav\u00c3\u00a9es, Mess Lethierry had returned to his room looking on the harbour,\nand had retired to rest; Douce and Grace were already a-bed. Except\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, the whole household were sleeping. Doors and shutters were\neverywhere closed. Footsteps were silent in the streets. Some few\nlights, like winking eyes about to close in rest, showed here and there\nin windows in the roofs, indicating the hour of domestics going to bed.\nNine had already struck in the old Romanesque belfry, surrounded by ivy,\nwhich shares with the church of St. Br\u00c3\u00a9lade at Jersey the peculiarity of\nhaving for its date four ones (IIII), which are used to signify eleven\nhundred and eleven.\n\nThe popularity of Mess Lethierry at St. Sampson had been founded on his\nsuccess. The success at an end, there had come a void. It might be\nimagined that ill-fortune is contagious, and that the unsuccessful have\na plague, so rapidly are they put in quarantine. The young men of\nwell-to-do families avoided D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. The isolation around the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es\nwas so complete that its inmates had not even yet heard the news of the\ngreat local event which had that day set all St. Sampson in a ferment.\nThe rector of the parish, the Rev. Ebenezer Caudray, had become rich.\nHis uncle, the magnificent Dean of St. Asaph, had just died in London.\nThe news had been brought by the mail sloop, the _Cashmere_, arrived\nfrom England that very morning, and the mast of which could be perceived\nin the roads of St. Peter's Port. The _Cashmere_ was to depart for\nSouthampton at noon on the morrow, and, so the rumour ran, to convey the\nreverend gentleman, who had been suddenly summoned to England, to be\npresent at the official opening of the will, not to speak of other\nurgent matters connected with an important inheritance. All day long St.\nSampson had been conversing on this subject. The _Cashmere_, the Rev.\nEbenezer, his deceased uncle, his riches, his departure, his possible\npreferment in the future, had formed the foundations of that perpetual\nbuzzing. A solitary house, still uninformed on these matters, had\nremained at peace. This was the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\nMess Lethierry had jumped into his hammock, and lay down in his\nclothing.\n\nSince the catastrophe of the Durande, to get into his hammock had been\nhis resource. Every captive has recourse to stretching himself upon his\npallet, and Mess Lethierry was the captive of his grief. To go to bed\nwas a truce, a gain in breathing time, a suspension of ideas. He neither\nslept nor watched. Strictly speaking, for two months and a half--for so\nlong was it since his misfortune--Mess Lethierry had been in a sort of\nsomnambulism. He had not yet regained possession of his faculties. He\nwas in that cloudy and confused condition of intellect with which those\nare familiar who have undergone overwhelming afflictions. His\nreflections were not thought, his sleep was no repose. By day he was not\nawake, by night not asleep. He was up, and then gone to rest, that was\nall. When he was in his hammock forgetfulness came to him a little. He\ncalled that sleeping. Chimeras floated about him, and within him. The\nnocturnal cloud, full of confused faces, traversed his brain. Sometimes\nit was the Emperor Napoleon dictating to him the story of his life;\nsometimes there were several D\u00c3\u00a9ruchettes; strange birds were in the\ntrees; the streets of Lons-le-Saulnier became serpents. Nightmares were\nthe brief respites of despair. He passed his nights in dreaming, and his\ndays in reverie.\n\nSometimes he remained all the afternoon at the window of his room, which\nlooked out upon the port, with his head drooping, his elbows on the\nstone, his ears resting on his fists, his back turned to the whole\nworld, his eye fixed on the old massive iron ring fastened in the wall\nof the house, at only a few feet from his window, where in the old days\nhe used to moor the Durande. He was looking at the rust which gathered\non the ring.\n\nHe was reduced to the mere mechanical habit of living.\n\nThe bravest men, when deprived of their most cherished idea, will come\nto this. His life had become a void. Life is a voyage; the idea is the\nitinerary. The plan of their course gone, they stop. The object is lost,\nthe strength of purpose gone. Fate has a secret discretionary power. It\nis able to touch with its rod even our moral being. Despair is almost\nthe destitution of the soul. Only the greatest minds resist, and for\nwhat?\n\nMess Lethierry was always meditating, if absorption can be called\nmeditation, in the depth of a sort of cloudy abyss. Broken words\nsometimes escaped him like these, \"There is nothing left for me now, but\nto ask yonder for leave to go.\"\n\nThere was a certain contradiction in that nature, complex as the sea, of\nwhich Mess Lethierry was, so to speak, the product. Mess Lethierry's\ngrief did not seek relief in prayer.\n\nTo be powerless is a certain strength. In the presence of our two great\nexpressions of this blindness--destiny and nature--it is in his\npowerlessness that man has found his chief support in prayer.\n\nMan seeks succour from his terror; his anxiety bids him kneel. Prayer,\nthat mighty force of the soul, akin to mystery. Prayer addresses itself\nto the magnanimity of the Shades; prayer regards mystery with eyes\nthemselves overshadowed by it, and beneath the power of its fixed and\nappealing gaze, we feel the possibility of the great Unknown unbending\nto reply.\n\nThe mere thought of such a possibility becomes a consolation.\n\nBut Mess Lethierry prayed not.\n\nIn the time when he was happy, God existed for him almost in visible\ncontact. Lethierry addressed Him, pledged his word to Him, seemed at\ntimes to hold familiar intercourse with Him. But in the hour of his\nmisfortune, a phenomenon not infrequent--the idea of God had become\neclipsed in his mind. This happens when the mind has created for itself\na deity clothed with human qualities.\n\nIn the state of mind in which he existed, there was for Lethierry only\none clear vision--the smile of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Beyond this all was dark.\n\nFor some time, apparently on account of the loss of the Durande, and of\nthe blow which it had been to them, this pleasant smile had been rare.\nShe seemed always thoughtful. Her birdlike playfulness, her childlike\nways, were gone. She was never seen now in the morning, at the sound of\nthe cannon which announced daybreak, saluting the rising sun with \"Boom!\nDaylight! Come in, please!\" At times her expression was very serious, a\nsad thing for that sweet nature. She made an effort, however, sometimes\nto laugh before Mess Lethierry and to divert him; but her cheerfulness\ngrew tarnished from day to day--gathered dust like the wing of a\nbutterfly with a pin through its body. Whether through sorrow for her\nuncle's sorrow--for there are griefs which are the reflections of other\ngriefs--or whether for any other reasons, she appeared at this time to\nbe much inclined towards religion. In the time of the old rector, M.\nJaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode, she scarcely went to church, as has been already said,\nfour times a year. Now she was, on the contrary, assiduous in her\nattendance. She missed no service, neither of Sunday nor of Thursday.\nPious souls in the parish remarked with satisfaction that amendment. For\nit is a great blessing when a girl who runs so many dangers in the world\nturns her thoughts towards God. That enables the poor parents at least\nto be easy on the subject of love-making and what not.\n\nIn the evening, whenever the weather permitted, she walked for an hour\nor two in the garden of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es. She was almost as pensive there as\nMess Lethierry, and almost always alone. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette went to bed last.\nThis, however, did not prevent Douce and Grace watching her a little, by\nthat instinct for spying which is common to servants; spying is such a\nrelaxation after household work.\n\nAs to Mess Lethierry, in the abstracted state of his mind, these little\nchanges in D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's habits escaped him. Moreover, his nature had\nlittle in common with the Duenna. He had not even remarked her\nregularity at the church. Tenacious of his prejudices against the clergy\nand their sermons, he would have seen with little pleasure these\nfrequent attendances at the parish church. It was not because his own\nmoral condition was not undergoing change. Sorrow is a cloud which\nchanges form.\n\nRobust natures, as we have said, are sometimes almost overthrown by\nsudden great misfortunes; but not quite. Manly characters such as\nLethierry's experience a reaction in a given time. Despair has its\nbackward stages. From overwhelmment we rise to dejection; from dejection\nto affliction; from affliction to melancholy. Melancholy is a twilight\nstate; suffering melts into it and becomes a sombre joy. Melancholy is\nthe pleasure of being sad.\n\nThese elegiac moods were not made for Lethierry. Neither the nature of\nhis temperament nor the character of his misfortune suited those\ndelicate shades. But at the moment at which we have returned to him, the\nreverie of his first despair had for more than a week been tending to\ndisperse; without, however, leaving him less sad. He was more inactive,\nwas always dull; but he was no longer overwhelmed. A certain perception\nof events and circumstances was returning to him, and he began to\nexperience something of that phenomenon which may be called the return\nto reality.\n\nThus by day in the great lower room, he did not listen to the words of\nthose about him, but he heard them. Grace came one morning quite\ntriumphant to tell D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette that he had undone the cover of a\nnewspaper.\n\nThis half acceptance of realities is in itself a good symptom, a token\nof convalescence. Great afflictions produce a stupor; it is by such\nlittle acts that men return to themselves. This improvement, however, is\nat first only an aggravation of the evil. The dreamy condition of mind\nin which the sufferer has lived, has served, while it lasted, to blunt\nhis grief. His sight before was thick. He felt little. Now his view is\nclear, nothing escapes him; and his wounds re-open. Each detail that he\nperceives serves to remind him of his sorrow. He sees everything again\nin memory, every remembrance is a regret. All kinds of bitter\naftertastes lurk in that return to life. He is better, and yet worse.\nSuch was the condition of Lethierry. In returning to full consciousness,\nhis sufferings had become more distinct.\n\nA sudden shock first recalled him to a sense of reality.\n\nOne afternoon, between the 15th and 20th of April, a double-knock at the\ndoor of the great lower room of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es had signalled the arrival of\nthe postman. Douce had opened the door; there was a letter.\n\nThe letter came from beyond sea; it was addressed to Mess Lethierry, and\nbore the postmark \"Lisbon.\"\n\nDouce had taken the letter to Mess Lethierry, who was in his room. He\nhad taken it, placed it mechanically upon the table, and had not looked\nat it.\n\nThe letter remained an entire week upon the table without being\nunsealed.\n\nIt happened, however, one morning that Douce said to Mess Lethierry:\n\n\"Shall I brush the dust off your letter, sir?\"\n\nLethierry seemed to arouse from his lethargy.\n\n\"Ay, ay! You are right,\" he said; and he opened the letter, and read as\nfollows:--\n\n    \"At Sea, _10th March_.\n\n\"To Mess Lethierry of St. Sampson.\n\n\"You will be gratified to receive news of me. I am aboard the\n_Tamaulipas_, bound for the port of 'No-return.' Among the crew is a\nsailor named Ahier-Tostevin, from Guernsey, who will return and will\nhave some facts to communicate to you. I take the opportunity of our\nspeaking a vessel, the _Herman Cortes_, bound for Lisbon, to forward you\nthis letter.\n\n\"You will be astonished to learn that I am going to be honest.\n\n\"As honest as Sieur Clubin.\n\n\"I am bound to believe that you know of certain recent occurrences;\nnevertheless, it is, perhaps, not altogether superfluous to send you a\nfull account of them.\n\n\"To proceed then.\n\n\"I have returned you your money.\n\n\"Some years ago, I borrowed from you, under somewhat irregular\ncircumstances, the sum of fifty thousand francs. Before leaving St. Malo\nlately, I placed in the hands of your confidential man of business,\nSieur Clubin, on your account three bank-notes of one thousand pounds\neach; making together seventy-five thousand francs. You will no doubt\nfind this reimbursement sufficient.\n\n\"Sieur Clubin acted for you, and received your money, including\ninterest, in a remarkably energetic manner. He appeared to me, indeed,\nsingularly zealous. This is, in fact, my reason for apprising you of the\nfacts.\n\n\"Your other confidential man of business,\n\n    \"RANTAINE.\n\n\"_Postscript_--Sieur Clubin was in possession of a revolver, which will\nexplain to you the circumstance of my having no receipt.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe who has ever touched a torpedo, or a Leyden-jar fully charged, may\nhave a notion of the effect produced on Mess Lethierry by the reading of\nthis letter.\n\nUnder that envelope, in that sheet of paper folded in four, to which he\nhad at first paid so little attention, lay the elements of an\nextraordinary commotion.\n\nHe recognised the writing and the signature. As to the facts which the\nletter contained, at first he understood nothing.\n\nThe excitement of the event, however, soon gave movement to his\nfaculties.\n\nThe effective part of the shock he had received lay in the phenomenon of\nthe seventy-five thousand francs entrusted by Rantaine to Clubin; this\nwas a riddle which compelled Lethierry's brain to work. Conjecture is a\nhealthy occupation for the mind. Reason is awakened: logic is called\ninto play.\n\nFor some time past public opinion in Guernsey had been undergoing a\nreaction on the subject of Clubin: that man of such high reputation for\nhonour during many years; that man so unanimously regarded with esteem.\nPeople had begun to question and to doubt; there were wagers pro and\ncon. Some light had been thrown on the question in singular ways. The\nfigure of Clubin began to become clearer, that is to say, he began to be\nblacker in the eyes of the world.\n\nA judicial inquiry had taken place at St. Malo, for the purpose of\nascertaining what had become of the coast-guardman, number 619. Legal\nperspicacity had got upon a false scent, a thing which happens not\nunfrequently. It had started with the hypothesis that the man had been\nenticed by Zuela, and shipped aboard the _Tamaulipas_ for Chili. This\ningenious supposition had led to a considerable amount of wasted\nconjecture. The shortsightedness of justice had failed to take note of\nRantaine; but in the progress of inquiry the authorities had come upon\nother clues. The affair, so obscure, became complicated. Clubin had\nbecome mixed up with the enigma. A coincidence, perhaps a direct\nconnection, had been found between the departure of the _Tamaulipas_ and\nthe loss of the Durande. At the wine-shop near the Dinan Gate, where\nClubin thought himself entirely unknown, he had been recognised. The\nwine-shop keeper had talked; Clubin had bought a bottle of brandy that\nnight. For whom? The gunsmith of St. Vincent Street, too, had talked.\nClubin had purchased a revolver. For what object? The landlord of the\n\"Jean Auberge\" had talked. Clubin had absented himself in an\ninexplicable manner. Captain Gertrais-Gaboureau had talked; Clubin had\ndetermined to start, although warned, and knowing that he might expect a\ngreat fog. The crew of the Durande had talked. In fact, the collection\nof the freight had been neglected, and the stowage badly arranged, a\nnegligence easy to comprehend, if the captain had determined to wreck\nthe ship. The Guernsey passenger, too, had spoken. Clubin had evidently\nimagined that he had run upon the Hanways. The Torteval people had\nspoken. Clubin had visited that neighbourhood a few days before the loss\nof the Durande, and had been seen walking in the direction of Pleinmont,\nnear the Hanways. He had with him a travelling-bag. \"He had set out with\nit, and come back without it.\" The birds'-nesters had spoken: their\nstory seemed to be possibly connected with Clubin's disappearance, if\ninstead of ghosts they supposed smugglers. Finally, the haunted house of\nPleinmont itself had spoken. Persons who had determined to get\ninformation had climbed and entered the windows, and had found\ninside--what? The very travelling-bag which had been seen in Sieur\nClubin's possession. The authorities of the _Douzaine_ of Torteval had\ntaken possession of the bag and had it opened. It was found to contain\nprovisions, a telescope, a chronometer, a man's clothing, and linen\nmarked with Clubin's initials. All this in the gossip of St. Malo and\nGuernsey became more and more like a case of fraud. Obscure hints were\nbrought together; there appeared to have been a singular disregard of\nadvice; a willingness to encounter the dangers of the fog; a suspected\nnegligence in the stowage of the cargo. Then there was the mysterious\nbottle of brandy; a drunken helmsman; a substitution of the captain for\nthe helmsman; a management of the rudder, to say the least, unskilful.\nThe heroism of remaining behind upon the wreck began to look like\nroguery. Clubin besides had evidently been deceived as to the rock he\nwas on. Granted an intention to wreck the vessel, it was easy to\nunderstand the choice of the Hanways, the shore easily reached by\nswimming, and the intended concealment in the haunted house awaiting the\nopportunity for flight. The travelling-bag, that suspicious preparative,\ncompleted the demonstration. By what link this affair connected itself\nwith the other affair of the disappearance of the coast-guardman nobody\nknew. People imagined some connection, and that was all. They had a\nglimpse in their minds of the look-out-man, number 619, alongside of the\nmysterious Clubin--quite a tragic drama. Clubin possibly was not an\nactor in it, but his presence was visible in the side scenes.\n\nThe supposition of a wilful destruction of the Durande did not explain\neverything. There was a revolver in the story, with no part yet assigned\nto it. The revolver, probably, belonged to the other affair.\n\nThe scent of the public is keen and true. Its instinct excels in those\ndiscoveries of truth by pieces and fragments. Still, amidst these facts,\nwhich seemed to point pretty clearly to a case of barratry, there were\nserious difficulties.\n\nEverything was consistent; everything coherent; but a basis was wanting.\n\nPeople do not wreck vessels for the pleasure of wrecking them. Men do\nnot run all those risks of fog, rocks, swimming, concealment, and flight\nwithout an interest. What could have been Clubin's interest?\n\nThe act seemed plain, but the motive was puzzling.\n\nHence a doubt in many minds. Where there is no motive, it is natural to\ninfer that there was no act.\n\nThe missing link was important. The letter from Rantaine seemed to\nsupply it.\n\nThis letter furnished a motive for Clubin's supposed crime: seventy-five\nthousand francs to be appropriated.\n\nRantaine was the _Deus ex machin\u00c3\u00a2_. He had descended from the clouds\nwith a lantern in his hand. His letter was the final light upon the\naffair. It explained everything, and even promised a witness in the\nperson of Ahier-Tostevin.\n\nThe part which it at once suggested for the revolver was decisive.\nRantaine was undoubtedly well informed. His letter pointed clearly the\nexplanation of the mystery.\n\nThere could be no possible palliation of Clubin's crime. He had\npremeditated the shipwreck; the proofs were the preparations discovered\nin the haunted house. Even supposing him innocent, and admitting the\nwreck to have been accidental, would he not, at the last moment, when he\nhad determined to sacrifice himself with the vessel, have entrusted the\nseventy-five thousand francs to the men who escaped in the long-boat.\nThe evidence was strikingly complete. Now what had become of Clubin? He\nhad probably been the victim of his blunder. He had doubtless perished\nupon the Douvres.\n\nAll this construction of surmises, which were not far from the reality,\nhad for several days occupied the mind of Mess Lethierry. The letter\nfrom Rantaine had done him the service of setting him to think. He was\nat first shaken by his surprise; then he made an effort to reflect. He\nmade another effort more difficult still, that of inquiry. He was\ninduced to listen, and even seek conversation. At the end of a week, he\nhad become, to a certain degree, in the world again; his thoughts had\nregained their coherence, and he was almost restored. He had emerged\nfrom his confused and troubled state.\n\nRantaine's letter, even admitting that Mess Lethierry could ever have\nentertained any hope of the reimbursement of his money, destroyed that\nlast chance.\n\nIt added to the catastrophe of the Durande this new wreck of\nseventy-five thousand francs. It put him in possession of that amount\njust so far as to make him sensible of its loss. The letter revealed to\nhim the extreme point in his ruin.\n\nHence he experienced a new and very painful sensation, which we have\nalready spoken of. He began to take an interest in his household--what\nit was to be in the future--how he was to set things in order; matters\nof which he had taken no heed for two months past. These trifling cares\nwounded him with a thousand tiny points, worse in their aggregate than\nthe old despair. A sorrow is doubly burdensome which has to be endured\nin each item, and while disputing inch by inch with fate for ground\nalready lost. Ruin is endurable in the mass, but not in the dust and\nfragments of the fallen edifice. The great fact may overwhelm, but the\ndetails torture. The catastrophe which lately fell like a thunderbolt,\nbecomes now a cruel persecution. Humiliation comes to aggravate the\nblow. A second desolation succeeds the first, with features more\nrepulsive. You descend one degree nearer to annihilation. The\nwinding-sheet becomes changed to sordid rags.\n\nNo thought is more bitter than that of one's own gradual fall from a\nsocial position.\n\nRuin is simple enough. A violent shock; a cruel turn of fate; a\ncatastrophe once for all. Be it so. We submit, and all is over. You are\nruined: it is well; you are dead? No; you are still living. On the\nmorrow you know it well. By what? By the pricking of a pin. Yonder\npasser-by omits to recognise you; the tradesmen's bills rain down upon\nyou; and yonder is one of your enemies, who is smiling. Perhaps he is\nthinking of Arnal's last pun; but it is all the same. The pun would not\nhave appeared to him so inimitable but for your ruin. You read your own\nsudden insignificance even in looks of indifference. Friends who used to\ndine at your table become of opinion that three courses were an\nextravagance. Your faults are patent to the eyes of everybody;\ningratitude having nothing more to expect, proclaims itself openly;\nevery idiot has foreseen your misfortunes. The malignant pull you to\npieces; the more malignant profess to pity. And then come a hundred\npaltry details. Nausea succeeds to grief. You have been wont to indulge\nin wine; you must now drink cider. Two servants, too! Why, one will be\ntoo many. It will be necessary to discharge this one, and get rid of\nthat. Flowers in your garden are superfluous; you will plant it with\npotatoes. You used to make presents of your fruits to friends; you will\nsend them henceforth to market. As to the poor, it will be absurd to\nthink of giving anything to them. Are you not poor yourself? And then\nthere is the painful question of dress. To have to refuse a wife a new\nribbon, what a torture! To have to refuse one who has made you a gift of\nher beauty a trifling article; to haggle over such matters, like a\nmiser! Perhaps she will say to you, \"What! rob my garden of its flowers,\nand now refuse one for my bonnet!\" Ah me! to have to condemn her to\nshabby dresses. The family table is silent. You fancy that those around\nit think harshly of you. Beloved faces have become clouded. This is what\nis meant by falling fortunes. It is to die day by day. To be struck down\nis like the blast of the furnace; to decay like this is the torture of\nthe slow fire.\n\nAn overwhelming blow is a sort of Waterloo, a slow decay, a St. Helena.\nDestiny, incarnate in the form of Wellington, has still some dignity;\nbut how sordid in the shape of Hudson Lowe. Fate becomes then a paltry\nhuckster. We find the man of Campo Formio quarrelling about a pair of\nstockings; we see that dwarfing of Napoleon which makes England less.\nWaterloo and St. Helena! Reduced to humbler proportions, every ruined\nman has traversed those two phases.\n\nOn the evening we have mentioned, and which was one of the first\nevenings in May, Lethierry, leaving D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette to walk by moonlight in\nthe garden, had gone to bed more depressed than ever.\n\nAll these mean and repulsive details, peculiar to worldly misfortune;\nall these trifling cares, which are at first insipid, and afterwards\nharassing, were revolving in his mind. A sullen load of miseries! Mess\nLethierry felt that his fall was irremediable. What could he do? What\nwould become of them? What sacrifices should he be compelled to impose\non D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette? Whom should he discharge--Douce or Grace? Would they have\nto sell the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es? Would they not be compelled to leave the island? To\nbe nothing where he had been everything; it was a terrible fall indeed.\n\nAnd to know that the old times had gone for ever! To recall those\njourneys to and fro, uniting France with those numberless islands; the\nTuesday's departure, the Friday's return, the crowd on the quay, those\ngreat cargoes, that industry, that prosperity, that proud direct\nnavigation, that machinery embodying the will of man, that all-powerful\nboiler, that smoke, all that reality! The steamboat had been the final\ncrown of the compass; the needle indicating the direct track, the\nsteam-vessel following it. One proposing, the other executing. Where was\nshe now, his Durande, that mistress of the seas, that queen who had made\nhim a king? To have been so long the man of ideas in his own country,\nthe man of success, the man who revolutionised navigation; and then to\nhave to give up all, to abdicate! To cease to exist, to become a\nbye-word, an empty bag which once was full. To belong to the past, after\nhaving so long represented the future. To come down to be an object of\npity to fools, to witness the triumph of routine, obstinacy,\nconservatism, selfishness, ignorance. To see the old barbarous sailing\ncutters crawling to and fro upon the sea: the outworn old-world\nprejudices young again; to have wasted a whole life; to have been a\nlight, and to suffer this eclipse. Ah! what a sight it was upon the\nwaves, that noble funnel, that prodigious cylinder, that pillar with its\ncapital of smoke, that column grander than any in the Place Vend\u00c3\u00b4me, for\non that there was only a man, while on this stood Progress. The ocean\nwas subdued; it was certainty upon the open sea. And had all this been\nwitnessed in that little island, in that little harbour, in that little\ntown of St. Sampson? Yes; it had been witnessed. And could it be that,\nhaving seen it, all had vanished to be seen no more.\n\nAll this series of regrets tortured Lethierry. There is such a thing as\na mental sobbing. Never, perhaps, had he felt his misfortune more\nbitterly. A certain numbness follows this acute suffering. Under the\nweight of his sorrow he gradually dosed.\n\nFor about two hours he remained in this state, feverish, sleeping a\nlittle, meditating much. Such torpors are accompanied by an obscure\nlabour of the brain, which is inexpressibly wearying. Towards the middle\nof the night, about midnight, a little before or a little after, he\nshook off his lethargy. He aroused, and opened his eyes. His window was\ndirectly in front of his hammock. He saw something extraordinary.\n\nA form was before the window; a marvellous form. It was the funnel of a\nsteam-vessel.\n\nMess Lethierry started, and sat upright in his bed. The hammock\noscillated like a swing in a tempest. Lethierry stared. A vision filled\nthe window-frame. There was the harbour flooded with the light of the\nmoon, and against that glitter, quite close to his house, stood forth,\ntall, round, and black, a magnificent object.\n\nThe funnel of a steam-vessel was there.\n\nLethierry sprang out of his hammock, ran to the window, lifted the sash,\nleaned out, and recognised it.\n\nThe funnel of the Durande stood before him.\n\nIt was in the old place.\n\nIts four chains supported it, made fast to the bulwarks of a vessel in\nwhich, beneath the funnel, he could distinguish a dark mass of irregular\noutline.\n\nLethierry recoiled, turned his back to the window, and dropped in a\nsitting posture into his hammock again.\n\nThen he returned, and once more he saw the vision.\n\nAn instant afterwards, or in about the time occupied by a flash of\nlightning, he was out upon the quay, with a lantern in his hand.\n\nA bark carrying a little backward a massive block from which issued the\nstraight funnel before the window of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, was made fast to the\nmooring-ring of the Durande. The bows of the bark stretched beyond the\ncorner of the wall of the house, and were level with the quay.\n\nThere was no one aboard.\n\nThe vessel was of a peculiar shape. All Guernsey would have recognised\nit. It was the old Dutch sloop.\n\nLethierry jumped aboard; and ran forward to the block which he saw\nbeyond the mast.\n\nIt was there, entire, complete, intact, standing square and firm upon\nits cast-iron flooring; the boiler had all its rivets, the axle of the\npaddle-wheels was raised erect, and made fast near the boiler; the\nbrine-pump was in its place; nothing was wanting.\n\nLethierry examined the machinery.\n\nThe lantern and the moon helped him in his examination. He went over\nevery part of the mechanism.\n\nHe noticed the two cases at the sides. He examined the axle of the\nwheels.\n\nHe went into the little cabin; it was empty.\n\nHe returned to the engine, and felt it, looked into the boiler, and\nknelt down to examine it inside.\n\nHe placed his lantern within the furnace, where the light, illuminating\nall the machinery, produced almost the illusion of an engine-room with\nits fire.\n\nThen he burst into a wild laugh, sprang to his feet, and with his eye\nfixed on the engine, and his arms outstretched towards the funnel, he\ncried aloud, \"Help.\"\n\nThe harbour bell was upon the quay, at a few paces distance. He ran to\nit, seized the chain, and began to pull it violently.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE HARBOUR BELL AGAIN\n\n\nGilliatt, in fact, after a passage without accident, but somewhat slow\non account of the heavy burden of the sloop, had arrived at St. Sampson\nafter dark, and nearer ten than nine o'clock.\n\nHe had calculated the time. The half-flood had arrived. There was plenty\nof water, and the moon was shining; so that he was able to enter the\nport.\n\nThe little harbour was silent. A few vessels were moored there, with\ntheir sails brailed up to the yards, their tops over, and without\nlanterns. At the far end a few others were visible, high and dry in the\ncareenage, where they were undergoing repairs; large hulls dismasted and\nstripped, with their planking open at various parts, lifting high the\nends of their timbers, and looking like huge dead beetles lying on their\nbacks with their legs in the air.\n\nAs soon as he had cleared the harbour mouth, Gilliatt examined the port\nand the quay. There was no light to be seen either at the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es or\nelsewhere. The place was deserted, save, perhaps, by some one going to\nor returning from the parsonage-house; nor was it possible to be sure\neven of this; for the night blurred every outline, and the moonlight\nalways gives to objects a vague appearance. The distance added to the\nindistinctness. The parsonage-house at that period was situated on the\nother side of the harbour, where there stands at the present day an open\nmast-house.\n\nGilliatt had approached the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es quietly, and had made the sloop fast\nto the ring of the Durande, under Mess Lethierry's window.\n\nHe leaped over the bulwarks, and was ashore.\n\nLeaving the sloop behind him by the quay, he turned the angle of the\nhouse, passed along a little narrow street, then along another, did not\neven notice the pathway which branched off leading to the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue,\nand in a few minutes found himself at that corner of the wall where\nthere were wild mallows with pink flowers in June, with holly, ivy, and\nnettles. Many a time concealed behind the bushes, seated on a stone, in\nthe summer days, he had watched here through long hours, even for whole\nmonths, often tempted to climb the wall, over which he contemplated the\ngarden of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es and the two windows of a little room seen through\nthe branches of the trees. The stone was there still; the bushes, the\nlow wall, the angle, as quiet and dark as ever. Like an animal returning\nto its hole, gliding rather than walking, he made his way in. Once\nseated there, he made no movement. He looked around; saw again the\ngarden, the pathways, the beds of flowers, the house, the two windows of\nthe chamber. The moonlight fell upon this dream. He felt it horrible to\nbe compelled to breathe, and did what he could to prevent it.\n\nHe seemed to be gazing on a vision of paradise, and was afraid that all\nwould vanish. It was almost impossible that all these things could be\nreally before his eyes; and if they were, it could only be with that\nimminent danger of melting into air which belongs to things divine. A\nbreath, and all must be dissipated. He trembled with the thought.\n\nBefore him, not far off, at the side of one of the alleys in the garden,\nwas a wooden seat painted green. The reader will remember this seat.\n\nGilliatt looked up at the two windows. He thought of the slumber of some\none possibly in that room. Behind that wall she was no doubt sleeping.\nHe wished himself elsewhere, yet would sooner have died than go away.\nHe thought of a gentle breathing moving a woman's breast. It was she,\nthat vision, that purity in the clouds, that form haunting him by day\nand night. She was there! He thought of her so far removed, and yet so\nnear as to be almost within reach of his delight; he thought of that\nimpossible ideal drooping in slumber, and like himself, too, visited by\nvisions; of that being so long desired, so distant, so impalpable--her\nclosed eyelids, her face resting on her hand; of the mystery of sleep in\nits relations with that pure spirit, of what dreams might come to one\nwho was herself a dream. He dared not think beyond, and yet he did. He\nventured on those familiarities which the fancy may indulge in; the\nnotion of how much was feminine in that angelic being disturbed his\nthoughts. The darkness of night emboldens timid imaginations to take\nthese furtive glances. He was vexed within himself, feeling on\nreflection as if it were profanity to think of her so boldly; yet still\nconstrained, in spite of himself, he tremblingly gazed into the\ninvisible. He shuddered almost with a sense of pain as he imagined her\nroom, a petticoat on a chair, a mantle fallen on the carpet, a band\nunbuckled, a handkerchief. He imagined her corset with its lace hanging\nto the ground, her stockings, her boots. His soul was among the stars.\n\nThe stars are made for the human heart of a poor man like Gilliatt not\nless than for that of the rich and great. There is a certain degree of\npassion by which every man becomes wrapped in a celestial light. With a\nrough and primitive nature, this truth is even more applicable. An\nuncultivated mind is easily touched with dreams.\n\nDelight is a fulness which overflows like any other. To see those\nwindows was almost too much happiness for Gilliatt.\n\nSuddenly, he looked and saw her.\n\nFrom the branches of a clump of bushes, already thickened by the spring,\nthere issued with a spectral slowness a celestial figure, a dress, a\ndivine face, almost a shining light beneath the moon.\n\nGilliatt felt his powers failing him: it was D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette approached. She stopped. She walked back a few paces, stopped\nagain, then returned and sat upon the wooden bench. The moon was in the\ntrees, a few clouds floated among the pale stars; the sea murmured to\nthe shadows in an undertone, the town was sleeping, a thin haze was\nrising from the horizon, the melancholy was profound. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\ninclined her head, with those thoughtful eyes which look attentive yet\nsee nothing. She was seated sideways, and had nothing on her head but a\nlittle cap untied, which showed upon her delicate neck the commencement\nof her hair. She twirled mechanically a ribbon of her cap around one of\nher fingers; the half light showed the outline of her hands like those\nof a statue; her dress was of one of those shades which by night looked\nwhite: the trees stirred as if they felt the enchantment which she shed\naround her. The tip of one of her feet was visible. Her lowered eyelids\nhad that vague contraction which suggests a tear checked in its course,\nor a thought suppressed. There was a charming indecision in the\nmovements of her arms, which had no support to lean on; a sort of\nfloating mingled with every posture. It was rather a gleam than a\nlight--rather a grace than a goddess; the folds of her dress were\nexquisite; her face which might inspire adoration, seemed meditative,\nlike portraits of the Virgin. It was terrible to think how near she was:\nGilliatt could hear her breathe.\n\nA nightingale was singing in the distance. The stirring of the wind\namong the branches set in movement, the inexpressible silence of the\nnight. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, beautiful, divine, appeared in the twilight like a\ncreation from those rays and from the perfumes in the air. That\nwidespread enchantment seemed to concentre and embody itself\nmysteriously in her; she became its living manifestation. She seemed the\noutblossoming of all that shadow and silence.\n\nBut the shadow and silence which floated lightly about her weighed\nheavily on Gilliatt. He was bewildered; what he experienced is not to be\ntold in words. Emotion is always new, and the word is always enough.\nHence the impossibility of expressing it. Joy is sometimes overwhelming.\nTo see D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, to see herself, to see her dress, her cap, her\nribbon, which she twined around her finger, was it possible to imagine\nit? Was it possible to be thus near her; to hear her breathe? She\nbreathed! then the stars might breathe also. Gilliatt felt a thrill\nthrough him. He was the most miserable and yet the happiest of men. He\nknew not what to do. His delirious joy at seeing her annihilated him.\nWas it indeed D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette there, and he so near? His thoughts, bewildered\nand yet fixed, were fascinated by that figure as by a dazzling jewel. He\ngazed upon her neck--her hair. He did not even say to himself that all\nthat would now belong to him, that before long--to-morrow, perhaps--he\nwould have the right to take off that cap, to unknot that ribbon. He\nwould not have conceived for a moment the audacity of thinking even so\nfar. Touching in idea is almost like touching with the hand. Love was\nwith Gilliatt like honey to the bear. He thought confusedly; he knew not\nwhat possessed him. The nightingale still sang. He felt as if about to\nbreathe his life out.\n\nThe idea of rising, of jumping over the wall, of speaking to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette,\nnever came into his mind. If it had he would have turned and fled. If\nanything resembling a thought had begun to dawn in his mind, it was\nthis: that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was there, that he wanted nothing more, and that\neternity had begun.\n\nA noise aroused them both--her from her reverie--him from his ecstasy.\n\nSome one was walking in the garden. It was not possible to see who was\napproaching on account of the trees. It was the footstep of a man.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette raised her eyes.\n\nThe steps drew nearer, then ceased. The person walking had stopped. He\nmust have been quite near. The path beside which was the bench wound\nbetween two clumps of trees. The stranger was there in the alley between\nthe trees, at a few paces from the seat.\n\nAccident had so placed the branches, that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette could see the\nnewcomer while Gilliatt could not.\n\nThe moon cast on the ground beyond the trees a shadow which reached to\nthe garden seat.\n\nGilliatt could see this shadow.\n\nHe looked at D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nShe was quite pale; her mouth was partly open, as with a suppressed cry\nof surprise. She had just half risen from the bench, and sunk again upon\nit. There was in her attitude a mixture of fascination with a desire to\nfly. Her surprise was enchantment mingled with timidity. She had upon\nher lips almost the light of a smile, with the fulness of tears in her\neyes. She seemed as if transfigured by that presence; as if the being\nwhom she saw before her belonged not to this earth. The reflection of an\nangel was in her look.\n\nThe stranger, who was to Gilliatt only a shadow, spoke. A voice issued\nfrom the trees, softer than the voice of a woman; yet it was the voice\nof a man. Gilliatt heard these words:\n\n\"I see you, mademoiselle, every Sunday and every Thursday. They tell me\nthat once you used not to come so often. It is a remark that has been\nmade. I ask your pardon. I have never spoken to you; it was my duty; but\nI come to speak to you to-day, for it is still my duty. It is right\nthat I speak to you first. The _Cashmere_ sails to-morrow. This is why I\nhave come. You walk every evening in your garden. It would be wrong of\nme to know your habits so well, if I had not the thought that I have.\nMademoiselle, you are poor; since this morning I am rich. Will you have\nme for your husband?\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette joined her two hands in a suppliant attitude, and looked at\nthe speaker, silent, with fixed eyes, and trembling from head to foot.\n\nThe voice continued:\n\n\"I love you. God made not the heart of man to be silent. He has promised\nhim eternity with the intention that he should not be alone. There is\nfor me but one woman upon earth. It is you. I think of you as of a\nprayer. My faith is in God, and my hope in you. What wings I have you\nbear. You are my life, and already my supreme happiness.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, \"there is no one to answer in the house!\"\n\nThe voice rose again:\n\n\"Yes, I have encouraged that dream. Heaven has not forbidden us to\ndream. You are like a glory in my eyes. I love you deeply, mademoiselle.\nTo me you are holy innocence. I know it is the hour at which your\nhousehold have retired to rest, but I had no choice of any other moment.\nDo you remember that passage of the Bible which some one read before us;\nit was the twenty-fifth chapter of Genesis. I have thought of it often\nsince. M. H\u00c3\u00a9rode said to me, you must have a rich wife. I replied no, I\nmust have a poor wife. I speak to you, mademoiselle, without venturing\nto approach you; I would step even further back if it was your wish that\nmy shadow should not touch your feet. You alone are supreme. You will\ncome to me if such is your will. I love and wait. You are the living\nform of a benediction.\"\n\n\"I did not know, sir,\" stammered D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, \"that any one remarked me\non Sundays and Thursdays.\"\n\nThe voice continued:\n\n\"We are powerless against celestial things. The whole Law is love.\nMarriage is Canaan; you are to me the promised land of beauty.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette replied, \"I did not think I did wrong any more than other\npersons who are strict.\"\n\nThe voice continued:\n\n\"God manifests his will in the flowers, in the light of dawn, in the\nspring; and love is of his ordaining. You are beautiful in this holy\nshadow of night. This garden has been tended by you; in its perfumes\nthere is something of your breath. The affinities of our souls do not\ndepend on us. They cannot be counted with our sins. You were there, that\nwas all. I was there, that was all. I did nothing but feel that I loved\nyou. Sometimes my eyes rested upon you. I was wrong, but what could I\ndo. It was through looking at you that all happened. I could not\nrestrain my gaze. There are mysterious impulses which are above our\nsearch. The heart is the chief of all temples. To have your spirit in my\nhouse--this is the terrestrial paradise for which I hope. Say, will you\nbe mine. As long as I was poor, I spoke not. I know your age. You are\ntwenty-one; I am twenty-six. I go to-morrow; if you refuse me I return\nno more. Oh, be my betrothed; will you not? More than once have my eyes,\nin spite of myself, addressed to you that question. I love you; answer\nme. I will speak to your uncle as soon as he is able to receive me; but\nI turn first to you. To Rebecca I plead for Rebecca; unless you love me\nnot.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette hung her head, and murmured:\n\n\"Oh! I worship him.\"\n\nThe words were spoken in a voice so low, that only Gilliatt heard them.\n\nShe remained with her head lowered as if by shading her face she hoped\nto conceal her thoughts.\n\nThere was a pause. No leaf among the trees was stirred. It was that\nsolemn and peaceful moment when the slumber of external things mingles\nwith the sleep of living creatures; and night seems to listen to the\nbeating of Nature's heart. In the midst of that retirement, like a\nharmony making the silence more complete, rose the wide murmur of the\nsea.\n\nThe voice was heard again.\n\n\"Mademoiselle!\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette started.\n\nAgain the voice spoke.\n\n\"You are silent.\"\n\n\"What would you have me say?\"\n\n\"I wait for your reply.\"\n\n\"God has heard it,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThen the voice became almost sonorous, and at the same time softer than\nbefore, and these words issued from the leaves as from a burning bush:\n\n\"You are my betrothed. Come then to me. Let the blue sky, with all its\nstars, be witness of this taking of my soul to thine; and let our first\nembrace be mingled with that firmament.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette arose, and remained an instant motionless, looking straight\nbefore her, doubtless in another's eyes. Then, with slow steps, with\nhead erect, her arms drooping, but with the fingers of her hands wide\napart, like one who leans on some unseen support, she advanced towards\nthe trees, and was out of sight.\n\nA moment afterwards, instead of the one shadow upon the gravelled walk,\nthere were two. They mingled together. Gilliatt saw at his feet the\nembrace of those two shadows.\n\nIn certain moments of crisis, time flows from us as his sands from the\nhour-glass, and we have no feeling of his flight. That pair on the one\nhand, who were ignorant of the presence of a witness, and saw him not;\non the other, that witness of their joy who could not see them, but who\nknew of their presence--how many minutes did they remain thus in that\nmysterious suspension of themselves? It would be impossible to say.\nSuddenly a noise burst forth at a distance. A voice was heard crying\n\"Help!\" and the harbour bell began to sound. It is probable that in\nthose celestial transports of delight they heard no echo of that tumult.\n\nThe bell continued to ring. Any one who had sought Gilliatt then in the\nangle of the wall would have found him no longer there.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nGRATITUDE AND DESPOTISM\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nJOY SURROUNDED BY TORTURES\n\n\nMess Lethierry pulled the bell furiously, then stopped abruptly. A man\nhad just turned the corner of the quay. It was Gilliatt.\n\nLethierry ran towards him, or rather flung himself upon him; seized his\nhand between his own, and looked him in the face for a moment, silent.\nIt was the silence of an explosion struggling to find an issue.\n\nThen pulling and shaking him with violence, and squeezing him in his\narms, he compelled him to enter the lower room of the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, pushed\nback with his heel the door which had remained half opened, sat down, or\nsank into a chair beside a great table lighted by the moon, the\nreflection of which gave a vague pallor to Gilliatt's face, and with a\nvoice of intermingled laughter and tears, cried:\n\n\"Ah! my son; my player of the bagpipe! I knew well that it was you. The\nsloop, _parbleu_! Tell me the story. You went there, then. Why, they\nwould have burnt you a hundred years ago! It is magic! There isn't a\nscrew missing. I have looked at everything already, recognised\neverything, handled everything. I guessed that the paddles were in the\ntwo cases. And here you are once more! I have been looking for you in\nthe little cabin. I rang the bell. I was seeking for you. I said to\nmyself, 'Where is he, that I may devour him?' You must admit that\nwonderful things do come to pass. He has brought back life to me.\n_Tonnerre!_ you are an angel! Yes, yes; it is my engine. Nobody will\nbelieve it; people will see it, and say, 'It can't be true.' Not a tap,\nnot a pin missing. The feed-pipe has never budged an inch. It is\nincredible that there should have been no more damage. We have only to\nput a little oil. But how did you accomplish it? To think that the\nDurande will be moving again. The axle of the wheels must have been\ntaken to pieces by some watchmaker. Give me your word that I am not\ncrazy.\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet, breathed a moment, and continued:\n\n\"Assure me of that. What a revolution! I pinched myself to be certain I\nwas not dreaming. You are my child, you are my son, you are my\nProvidence. Brave lad! To go and fetch my good old engine. In the open\nsea, among those cut-throat rocks. I have seen some strange things in my\nlife; nothing like that. I have known Parisians, who were veritable\ndemons, but I'll defy them to have done that. It beats the Bastille. I\nhave seen the _gauchos_ labouring in the _Pampas_, with a crooked branch\nof a tree for a plough and a bundle of thorn-bushes for a harrow,\ndragged by a leathern strap; they get harvests of wheat that way, with\ngrains as big as hedgenuts. But that is a trifle compared with your\nfeats. You have performed a miracle--a real one. Ah! _gredin!_ let me\nhug you. How they will gossip in St. Sampson. I shall set to work at\nonce to build the boat. It is astonishing that the crank is all right.\nGentlemen, he has been to the Douvres; I say to the Douvres. He went\nalone. The Douvres! I defy you to find a worse spot. Do you know, have\nthey told you, that it's proved that Clubin sent the Durande to the\nbottom to swindle me out of money which he had to bring me? He made\nTangrouille drunk. It's a long story. I'll tell you another day of his\npiratical tricks. I, stupid idiot, had confidence in Clubin. But he\ntrapped himself, the villain, for he couldn't have got away. There is a\nGod above, scoundrel! Do you see, Gilliatt, bang! bang! the irons in the\nfire; we'll begin at once to rebuild the Durande. We'll have her twenty\nfeet longer. They build them longer now than they did. I'll buy the wood\nfrom Dantzic and Br\u00c3\u00aame. Now I have got the machinery they will give me\ncredit again. They'll have confidence now.\"\n\nMess Lethierry stopped, lifted his eyes with that look which sees the\nheavens through the roof, and muttered, \"Yes, there is a power on high!\"\n\nThen he placed the middle finger of his right hand between his two\neyebrows, and tapped with his nail there, an action which indicates a\nproject passing through the mind, and he continued:\n\n\"Nevertheless, to begin again, on a grand scale, a little ready money\nwould have been useful. Ah! if I only had my three bank-notes, the\nseventy-five thousand francs that that robber Rantaine returned, and\nthat vagabond Clubin stole.\"\n\nGilliatt silently felt in his pocket, and drew out something which he\nplaced before him. It was the leathern belt that he had brought back. He\nopened, and spread it out upon the table; in the inside the word\n\"Clubin\" could be deciphered in the light of the moon. He then took out\nof the pocket of the belt a box, and out of the box three pieces of\npaper, which he unfolded and offered to Lethierry.\n\nLethierry examined them. It was light enough to read the figures \"1000,\"\nand the word \"thousand\" was also perfectly visible. Mess Lethierry took\nthe three notes, placed them on the table one beside the other, looked\nat them, looked at Gilliatt, stood for a moment dumb; and then began\nagain, like an eruption after an explosion:\n\n\"These too! You are a marvel. My bank-notes! all three. A thousand\npounds each. My seventy-five thousand francs. Why, you must have gone\ndown to the infernal regions. It is Clubin's belt. Pardieu! I can read\nhis vile name. Gilliatt has brought back engine and money too. There\nwill be something to put in the papers. I will buy some timber of the\nfinest quality. I guess how it was; you found his carcase; Clubin\nmouldering away in some corner. We'll have some Dantzic pine and Br\u00c3\u00aame\noak; we'll have a first-rate planking--oak within and pine without. In\nold times they didn't build so well, but their work lasted longer; the\nwood was better seasoned, because they did not build so much. We'll\nbuild the hull perhaps of elm. Elm is good for the parts in the water.\nTo be dry sometimes, and sometimes wet, rots the timbers; the elm\nrequires to be always wet; it's a wood that feeds upon water. What a\nsplendid Durande we'll build. The lawyers will not trouble me again. I\nshall want no more credit. I have some money of my own. Did ever any one\nsee a man like Gilliatt. I was struck down to the ground, I was a dead\nman. He comes and sets me up again as firm as ever. And all the while I\nwas never thinking about him. He had gone clean out of my mind; but I\nrecollect everything now. Poor lad! Ah! by the way, you know you are to\nmarry D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\"\n\nGilliatt leaned with his back against the wall, like one who staggers,\nand said in a tone very low, but distinct:\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMess Lethierry started.\n\n\"How, no!\"\n\nGilliatt replied:\n\n\"I do not love her.\"\n\nMess Lethierry went to the window, opened and reclosed it, took the\nthree bank-notes, folded them, placed the iron box on top, scratched his\nhead, seized Clubin's belt, flung it violently against the wall, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"You must be mad.\"\n\nHe thrust his fists into his pockets, and exclaimed:\n\n\"You don't love D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette? What! was it at me, then, that you used to\nplay the bagpipe?\"\n\nGilliatt, still supporting himself by the wall, turned pale, as a man\nnear his end. As he became pale, Lethierry became redder.\n\n\"There's an idiot for you! He doesn't love D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Very good; make\nup your mind to love her, for she shall never marry any but you. A\ndevilish pretty story that; and you think that I believe you. If there\nis anything really the matter with you, send for a doctor; but don't\ntalk nonsense. You can't have had time to quarrel, or get out of temper\nwith her. It is true that lovers are great fools sometimes. Come now,\nwhat are your reasons? If you have any, say. People don't make geese of\nthemselves without reasons. But, I have wool in my ears; perhaps I\ndidn't understand. Repeat to me what you said.\"\n\nGilliatt replied:\n\n\"I said, No!\"\n\n\"You said, No. He holds to it, the lunatic! You must be crazy. You said,\nNo. Here's a stupidity beyond anything ever heard of. Why, people have\nhad their heads shaved for much less than that. What! you don't like\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette? Oh, then, it was out of affection for the old man that you\ndid all these things? It was for the sake of papa that you went to the\nDouvres, that you endured cold and heat, and was half dead with hunger\nand thirst, and ate the limpets off the rocks, and had the fog, the\nrain, and the wind for your bedroom, and brought me back my machine,\njust as you might bring a pretty woman her little canary that had\nescaped from its cage. And the tempest that we had three days ago. Do\nyou think I don't bear it in mind? You must have had a time of it! It\nwas in the midst of all this misery, alongside of my old craft, that you\nshaped, and cut, and turned, and twisted, and dragged about, and filed,\nand sawed, and carpentered, and schemed, and performed more miracles\nthere by yourself than all the saints in paradise. Ah! you annoyed me\nenough once with your bagpipe. They call it a _biniou_ in Brittany.\nAlways the same tune too, silly fellow. And yet you don't love\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette? I don't know what is the matter with you. I recollect it\nall now. I was there in the corner; D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette said, 'He shall be my\nhusband;' and so you shall. You don't love her! Either you must be mad,\nor else I am mad. And you stand there, and speak not a word. I tell you\nyou are not at liberty to do all the things you have done, and then say,\nafter all, 'I don't love D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.' People don't do others services in\norder to put them in a passion. Well; if you don't marry her, she shall\nbe single all her life. In the first place, I shall want you. You must\nbe the pilot of the Durande. Do you imagine I mean to part with you like\nthat? No, no, my brave boy; I don't let you go. I have got you now; I'll\nnot even listen to you. Where will they find a sailor like you? You are\nthe man I want. But why don't you speak?\"\n\nMeanwhile the harbour bell had aroused the household and the\nneighbourhood. Douce and Grace had risen, and had just entered the lower\nroom, silent and astonished. Grace had a candle in her hand. A group of\nneighbours, townspeople, sailors, and peasants, who had rushed out of\ntheir houses, were outside on the quay, gazing in wonderment at the\nfunnel of the Durande in the sloop. Some, hearing Lethierry's voice in\nthe lower room, began to glide in by the half-opened door. Between the\nfaces of two worthy old women appeared that of Sieur Landoys, who had\nthe good fortune always to find himself where he would have regretted to\nhave been absent.\n\nMen feel a satisfaction in having witnesses of their joys. The sort of\nscattered support which a crowd presents pleases them at such times;\ntheir delight draws new life from it. Mess Lethierry suddenly perceived\nthat there were persons about him; and he welcomed the audience at once.\n\n\"Ah! you are here, my friends? I am very glad to see you. You know the\nnews? That man has been there, and brought it back. How d'ye do, Sieur\nLandoys? When I woke up just now, the first thing I spied was the\nfunnel. It was under my window. There's not a nail missing. They make\npictures of Napoleon's deeds; but I think more of that than of the\nbattle of Austerlitz. You have just left your beds, my good friends. The\nDurande has found you sleeping. While you are putting on your night-caps\nand blowing out your candles there are others working like heroes. We\nare a set of cowards and do-nothings; we sit at home rubbing our\nrheumatisms; but happily that does not prevent there being some of\nanother stamp. The man of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue has arrived from the Douvres\nrocks. He has fished up the Durande from the bottom of the sea; and\nfished up my money out of Clubin's pocket, from a greater depth still.\nBut how did you contrive to do it? All the powers of darkness were\nagainst you--the wind and the sea--the sea and the wind. It's true\nenough that you are a magician. Those who say that are not so stupid\nafter all. The Durande is back again. The tempests may rage now; that\ncuts the ground from under them. My friends, I can inform you that there\nwas no shipwreck after all. I have examined all the machinery. It is\nlike new, perfect. The valves go as easily as rollers. You would think\nthem made yesterday. You know that the waste water is carried away by a\ntube inside another tube, through which come the waters from the\nboilers; this was to economise the heat. Well; the two tubes are there\nas good as ever. The complete engine, in fact. She is all there, her\nwheels and all. Ah! you shall marry her.\"\n\n\"Marry the complete engine?\" asked Sieur Landoys.\n\n\"No; D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; yes; the engine. Both of them. He shall be my double\nson-in-law. He shall be her captain. Good day, Captain Gilliatt; for\nthere will soon be a captain of the Durande. We are going to do a world\nof business again. There will be trade, circulation, cargoes of oxen and\nsheep. I wouldn't give St. Sampson for London now. And there stands the\nauthor of all this. It was a curious adventure, I can tell you. You will\nread about it on Saturday in old Mauger's _Gazette_. Malicious Gilliatt\nis very malicious. What's the meaning of these Louis-d'ors here?\"\n\nMess Lethierry had just observed, through the opening of the lid, that\nthere was some gold in the box upon the notes. He seized it, opened and\nemptied it into the palm of his hand, and put the handful of guineas on\nthe table.\n\n\"For the poor, Sieur Landoys. Give those sovereigns from me to the\nconstable of St. Sampson. You recollect Rantaine's letter. I showed it\nto you. Very well; I've got the bank-notes. Now we can buy some oak and\nfir, and go to work at carpentering. Look you! Do you remember the\nweather of three days ago? What a hurricane of wind and rain! Gilliatt\nendured all that upon the Douvres. That didn't prevent his taking the\nwreck to pieces, as I might take my watch. Thanks to him, I am on my\nlegs again. Old 'Lethierry's galley' is going to run again, ladies and\ngentlemen. A nut-shell with a couple of wheels and a funnel. I always\nhad that idea. I used to say to myself, one day I will do it. That was a\ngood long time back. It was an idea that came in my head at Paris, at\nthe coffee-house at the corner of the Rue Christine and the Rue\nDauphine, when I was reading a paper which had an account of it. Do you\nknow that Gilliatt would think nothing of putting the machine at Marly\nin his pocket, and walking about with it? He is wrought-iron, that man;\ntempered steel, a mariner of invaluable qualities, an excellent smith,\nan extraordinary fellow, more astonishing than the Prince of Hohenlohe.\nThat is what I call a man with brains. We are children by the side of\nhim. Sea-wolves we may think ourselves; but the sea-lion is there.\nHurrah for Gilliatt! I do not know how he has done it; but certainly he\nmust have been the devil. And how can I do other than give him\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\"\n\nFor some minutes D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had been in the room. She had not spoken or\nmoved since she entered. She had glided in like a shadow, had sat down\nalmost unperceived behind Mess Lethierry, who stood before her,\nloquacious, stormy, joyful, abounding in gestures, and talking in a loud\nvoice. A little while after her another silent apparition had appeared.\nA man attired in black, with a white cravat, holding his hat in his\nhand, stood in the doorway. There were now several candles among the\ngroup, which had gradually increased in number. These lights were near\nthe man attired in black. His profile and youthful and pleasing\ncomplexion showed itself against the dark background with the clearness\nof an engraving on a medal. He leaned with his shoulder against the\nframework of the door, and held his left hand to his forehead, an\nattitude of unconscious grace, which contrasted the breadth of his\nforehead with the smallness of his hand. There was an expression of\nanguish in his contracted lips, as he looked on and listened with\nprofound attention. The standers-by having recognised M. Caudray, the\nrector of the parish, had fallen back to allow him to pass; but he\nremained upon the threshold. There was hesitation in his posture, but\ndecision in his looks, which now and then met those of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. With\nregard to Gilliatt, whether by chance or design, he was in shadow, and\nwas only perceived indistinctly.\n\nAt first Mess Lethierry did not observe Caudray, but he saw D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\nHe went to her and kissed her fervently upon the forehead; stretching\nforth his hand at the same time towards the dark corner where Gilliatt\nwas standing.\n\n\"D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette,\" he said, \"we are rich again; and there is your future\nhusband.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette raised her head, and looked into the dusky corner bewildered.\n\nMess Lethierry continued:\n\n\"The marriage shall take place immediately, if it can; they shall have a\nlicence; the formalities here are not very troublesome; the dean can do\nwhat he pleases; people are married before they have time to turn round.\nIt is not as in France, where you must have bans, and publications, and\ndelays, and all that fuss. You will be able to boast of being the wife\nof a brave man. No one can say he is not. I thought so from the day when\nI saw him come back from Herm with the little cannon. But now he comes\nback from the Douvres with his fortune and mine, and the fortune of this\ncountry. A man of whom the world will talk a great deal more one day.\nYou said once, 'I will marry him;' and you shall marry him, and you\nshall have little children, and I will be grandpapa; and you will have\nthe good fortune to be the wife of a noble fellow, who can work, who can\nbe useful to his fellow-men; a surprising fellow, worth a hundred\nothers; a man who can rescue other people's inventions, a providence! At\nall events, you will not have married, like so many other silly girls\nabout here, a soldier or a priest, that is, a man who kills or a man who\nlies. But what are you doing there, Gilliatt? Nobody can see you. Douce,\nGrace, everybody there! Bring a light, I say. Light up my son-in-law for\nme. I betroth you to each other, my children: here stands your husband,\nhere my son, Gilliatt of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue, that noble fellow, that great\nseaman; I will have no other son-in-law, and you no other husband. I\npledge my word to that once more in God's name. Ah! you are there,\nMonsieur the Cur\u00c3\u00a9. You will marry these young people for us.\"\n\nLethierry's eye had just fallen upon Caudray.\n\nDouce and Grace had done as they were directed. Two candles placed upon\nthe table cast a light upon Gilliatt from head to foot.\n\n\"There's a fine fellow,\" said Mess Lethierry.\n\nGilliatt's appearance was hideous.\n\nHe was in the condition in which he had that morning set sail from the\nrocks; in rags, his bare elbows showing through his sleeves; his beard\nlong, his hair rough and wild; his eyes bloodshot, his skin peeling, his\nhands covered with wounds; his feet naked. Some of the blisters left by\nthe devil-fish were still visible upon his arms.\n\nLethierry gazed at him.\n\n\"This is my son-in-law,\" he said. \"How he has struggled with the sea. He\nis all in rags. What shoulders; what hands. There's a splendid fellow!\"\n\nGrace ran to D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette and supported her head. She had fainted.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE LEATHERN TRUNK\n\n\nAt break of day St. Sampson was on foot, and all the people of St.\nPeter's Port began to flock there. The resurrection of the Durande\ncaused a commotion in the island not unlike what was caused by the\n_Salette_ in the south of France. There was a crowd on the quay staring\nat the funnel standing erect in the sloop. They were anxious to see and\nhandle the machinery; but Lethierry, after making a new and triumphant\nsurvey of the whole by daylight, had placed two sailors aboard with\ninstructions to prevent any one approaching it. The funnel, however,\nfurnished food enough for contemplation. The crowd gaped with\nastonishment. They talked of nothing but Gilliatt. They remarked on his\nsurname of \"malicious Gilliatt;\" and their admiration wound up with the\nremark, \"It is not pleasant to have people in the island who can do\nthings like that.\"\n\nMess Lethierry was seen from outside the house, seated at a table before\nthe window, writing, with one eye on the paper and another on the sloop.\nHe was so completely absorbed that he had only once stopped to call\nDouce and ask after D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. Douce replied, \"Mademoiselle has risen\nand is gone out.\" Mess Lethierry replied, \"She is right to take the air.\nShe was a little unwell last night, owing to the heat. There was a crowd\nin the room. This and her surprise and joy, and the windows being all\nclosed, overcame her. She will have a husband to be proud of.\" And he\nhad gone on with his writing. He had already finished and sealed two\nletters, addressed to the most important shipbuilders at Br\u00c3\u00aame. He now\nfinished the sealing of a third.\n\nThe noise of a wheel upon the quay induced him to look up. He leaned out\nof the window, and observed coming from the path which led to the B\u00c3\u00bb de\nla Rue a boy pushing a wheelbarrow. The boy was going towards St.\nPeter's Port. In the barrow was a portmanteau of brown leather, studded\nwith nails of brass and white metal.\n\nMess Lethierry called to the boy:\n\n\"Where are you going, my lad?\"\n\nThe boy stopped, and replied:\n\n\"To the _Cashmere_.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To take this trunk aboard.\"\n\n\"Very good; you shall take these three letters too.\"\n\nMess Lethierry opened the drawer of his table, took a piece of string,\ntied the three letters which he had just written across and across, and\nthrew the packet to the boy, who caught it between his hands.\n\n\"Tell the captain of the _Cashmere_ they are my letters, and to take\ncare of them. They are for Germany--Br\u00c3\u00aame _vi\u00c3\u00a2_ London.\"\n\n\"I can't speak to the captain, Mess Lethierry.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"The _Cashmere_ is not at the quay.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"She is in the roads.\"\n\n\"Ay, true; on account of the sea.\"\n\n\"I can only speak to the man who takes the things aboard.\"\n\n\"You will tell him, then, to look to the letters.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mess Lethierry.\"\n\n\"At what time does the _Cashmere_ sail?\"\n\n\"At twelve.\"\n\n\"The tide will flow at noon; she will have it against her.\"\n\n\"But she will have the wind,\" answered the lad.\n\n\"Boy,\" said Mess Lethierry, pointing with his forefinger at the engine\nin the sloop, \"do you see that? There is something which laughs at winds\nand tides.\"\n\nThe boy put the letters in his pocket, took up the handles of the barrow\nagain, and went on his way towards the town. Mess Lethierry called\n\"Douce! Grace!\"\n\nGrace opened the door a little way.\n\n\"What is it, Mess?\"\n\n\"Come in and wait a moment.\"\n\nMess Lethierry took a sheet of paper, and began to write. If Grace,\nstanding behind him, had been curious, and had leaned forward while he\nwas writing, she might have read as follows:--\n\n\"I have written to Br\u00c3\u00aame for the timber. I have appointments all the\nmorning with carpenters for the estimate. The rebuilding will go on\nfast. You must go yourself to the Deanery for a licence. It is my wish\nthat the marriage should take place as soon as possible; immediately\nwould be better. I am busy about the Durande. Do you be busy about\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\"\n\nHe dated it and signed \"Lethierry.\" He did not take the trouble to seal\nit, but merely folded it in four, and handed it to Grace, saying:\n\n\"Take that to Gilliatt.\"\n\n\"To the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue?\"\n\n\"To the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nTHE DEPARTURE OF THE _CASHMERE_\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE HAVELET NEAR THE CHURCH\n\n\nWhen there is a crowd at St. Sampson, St. Peter's Port is soon deserted.\nA point of curiosity at a given place is like an air-pump. News travel\nfast in small places. Going to see the funnel of the Durande under Mess\nLethierry's window had been, since sunrise, the business of the Guernsey\nfolks. Every other event was eclipsed by this. The death of the Dean of\nSt. Asaph was forgotten, together with the question of the Rev. Mr.\nCaudray, his sudden riches, and the departure of the _Cashmere_. The\nmachinery of the Durande brought back from the Douvres rocks was the\norder of the day. People were incredulous. The shipwreck had appeared\nextraordinary, the salvage seemed impossible. Everybody hastened to\nassure himself of the truth by the help of his own eyes. Business of\nevery kind was suspended. Long strings of townsfolk with their families,\nfrom the \"Vesin\" up to the \"Mess,\" men and women, gentlemen, mothers\nwith children, infants with dolls, were coming by every road or pathway\nto see \"the thing to be seen\" at the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es, turning their backs upon\nSt. Peter's Port. Many shops at St. Peter's Port were closed. In the\nCommercial Arcade there was an absolute stagnation in buying and\nselling. The Durande alone obtained attention. Not a single shopkeeper\nhad had a \"handsell\" that morning, except a jeweller, who was surprised\nat having sold a wedding-ring to \"a sort of man who appeared in a great\nhurry, and who asked for the house of the Dean.\" The shops which\nremained open were centres of gossip, where loiterers discussed the\nmiraculous salvage. There was not a foot-passenger at the \"Hyvreuse,\"\nwhich is known in these days, nobody knows why, as Cambridge Park; no\none was in the High Street, then called the Grande Rue; nor in Smith\nStreet, known then only as the Rue des Forges; nobody in Hauteville. The\nEsplanade itself was deserted. One might have guessed it to be Sunday. A\nvisit from a Royal personage to review the militia at the Ancresse\ncould not have emptied the town more completely. All this hubbub about\n\"a nobody\" like Gilliatt, caused a good deal of shrugging of the\nshoulders among persons of grave and correct habits.\n\nThe church of St. Peter's Port, with its three gable-ends placed side by\nside, its transept and its steeple, stands at the water's side at the\nend of the harbour, and nearly on the landing place itself, where it\nwelcomes those who arrive, and gives the departing \"God speed.\" It\nrepresents the capital letter at the beginning of that long line which\nforms the front of the town towards the sea.\n\nIt is both the parish church of St. Peter's Port and the chief place of\nthe Deanery of the whole island. Its officiating minister is the\nsurrogate of the bishop, a clergyman in full orders.\n\nThe harbour of St. Peter's Port, a very fine and large port at the\npresent day, was at that epoch, and even up to ten years ago, less\nconsiderable than the harbour of St. Sampson. It was enclosed by two\nenormous thick walls, beginning at the water's edge on both sides, and\ncurving till they almost joined again at the extremities, where there\nstood a little white lighthouse. Under this lighthouse, a narrow gullet,\nbearing still the two rings of the chain with which it was the custom to\nbar the passage in ancient times, formed the entrance for vessels. The\nharbour of St. Peter's Port might be well compared with the claws of a\nhuge lobster opened a little way. This kind of pincers took from the\nocean a portion of the sea, which it compelled to remain calm. But\nduring the easterly winds the waves rolled heavily against the narrow\nentrance, the port was agitated, and it was better not to enter. This is\nwhat had happened with the _Cashmere_ that day, which had accordingly\nanchored in the roads.\n\nThe vessels, during the easterly winds, preferred this course, which\nbesides saved them the port dues. On these occasions the boatmen of the\ntown, a hardy race of mariners whom the new port has thrown out of\nemployment, came in their boats to fetch passengers at the landing-place\nor at stations on the shore, and carried them with their luggage, often\nin heavy seas, but always without accident, to the vessels about to\nsail. The east wind blows off the shore, and is very favourable for the\npassage to England; the vessel at such times rolls, but does not pitch.\n\nWhen a vessel happened to be in the port, everybody embarked from the\nquay. When it was in the roads they took their choice, and embarked from\nany point of the coast near the moorings. The \"Havelet\" was one of\nthese creeks. This little harbour (which is the signification of the\nword) was near the town, but was so solitary that it seemed far off.\nThis solitude was owing to the shelter of the high cliffs of Fort St.\nGeorge, which overlooked this retired inlet. The Havelet was accessible\nby several paths. The most direct was along the water's side. It had the\nadvantage of leading to the town and to the church in five minutes'\nwalk, and the disadvantage of being covered by the sea twice a day. The\nother paths were more or less abrupt, and led down to the creek through\ngaps in the steep rocks. Even in broad daylight, it was dusk in the\nHavelet. Huge blocks overhanging it on all sides, and thick bushes and\nbrambles cast a sort of soft twilight upon the rocks and waves below.\nNothing could be more peaceful than this spot in calm weather; nothing\nmore tumultuous during heavy seas. There were ends of branches there\nwhich were always wet with the foam. In the spring time, the place was\nfull of flowers, of nests, of perfumes, of birds, of butterflies, and\nbees. Thanks to recent improvements, this wild nook no longer exists.\nFine, straight lines have taken the place of these wild features;\nmasonry, quays, and little gardens, have made their appearance;\nearthwork has been the rage, and taste has finally subdued the\neccentricities of the cliff, and the irregularities of the rocks below.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nDESPAIR CONFRONTS DESPAIR\n\n\nIt was a little before ten o'clock in the morning. The crowd at St.\nSampson, according to all appearance, was increasing. The multitude,\nfeverish with curiosity, was moving towards the north; and the Havelet,\nwhich is in the south, was more deserted than ever.\n\nNotwithstanding this, there was a boat there and a boatman. In the boat\nwas a travelling bag. The boatman seemed to be waiting for some one.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ was visible at anchor in roads, as she did not start till\nmidday; there was as yet no sign of moving aboard.\n\nA passer-by, who had listened from one of the ladder-paths up the cliffs\noverhead, would have heard a murmur of words in the Havelet, and if he\nhad leaned over the overhanging cliff might have seen, at some distance\nfrom the boat, in a corner among the rocks and branches, where the eye\nof the boatman could not reach them, a man and a woman. It was Caudray\nand D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nThese obscure nooks on the seashore, the chosen places of lady bathers,\nare not always so solitary as is believed. Persons are sometimes\nobserved and heard there. Those who seek shelter and solitude in them\nmay easily be followed through the thick bushes, and, thanks to the\nmultiplicity and entanglement of the paths, the granite and the shrubs\nwhich favour the stolen interview may also favour the witness.\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette stood face to face, looking into each other's\neyes, and holding each other by the hand. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was speaking.\nCaudray was silent. A tear that had gathered upon his eyelash hung there\nand did not fall.\n\nGrief and strong passion were imprinted in his calm, religious\ncountenance. A painful resignation was there too--a resignation hostile\nto faith, though springing from it. Upon that face, simply devout until\nthen, there was the commencement of a fatal expression. He who had\nhitherto meditated only on doctrine, had begun to meditate on Fate, an\nunhealthy meditation for a priest. Faith dissolves under its action.\nNothing disturbs the religious mind more than that bending under the\nweight of the unknown. Life seems a perpetual succession of events, to\nwhich man submits. We never know from which direction the sudden blow\nwill come. Misery and happiness enter or make their exit, like\nunexpected guests. Their laws, their orbit, their principle of\ngravitation, are beyond man's grasp. Virtue conducts not to happiness,\nnor crime to retribution: conscience has one logic, fate another; and\nneither coincide. Nothing is foreseen. We live confusedly, and from hand\nto mouth. Conscience is the straight line, life is the whirlwind, which\ncreates above man's head either black chaos or the blue sky. Fate does\nnot practise the art of gradations. Her wheel turns sometimes so fast\nthat we can scarcely distinguish the interval between one revolution and\nanother, or the link between yesterday and to-day. Caudray was a\nbeliever whose faith did not exclude reason, and whose priestly training\ndid not shut him out from passion. Those religious systems which impose\ncelibacy on the priesthood are not without reason for it. Nothing really\ndestroys the individuality of the priest more than love. All sorts of\nclouds seemed to darken Caudray's soul. He looked too long into\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's eyes. These two beings worshipped each other.\n\nThere was in Caudray's eye the mute adoration of despair.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette spoke.\n\n\"You must not leave me. I shall not have strength. I thought I could bid\nyou farewell. I cannot. Why did you come yesterday? You should not have\ncome if you were going so soon. I never spoke to you. I loved you; but\nknew it not. Only that day, when M. H\u00c3\u00a9rode read to us the story of\nRebecca, and when your eyes met mine, my cheeks were like fire, and I\nthought only of how Rebecca's face must have burnt like mine; and yet,\nif any one had told me yesterday that I loved you, I might have laughed\nat it. This is what is so terrible. It has been like a treason. I did\nnot take heed. I went to the church, I saw you, I thought everybody\nthere was like myself. I do not reproach you; you did nothing to make me\nlove you; you did nothing but look at me; it is not your fault if you\nlook at people; and yet that made me love you so much. I did not even\nsuspect it. When you took up the book it was a flood of light; when\nothers took it, it was but a book. You raised your eyes sometimes; you\nspoke of archangels; oh! you were my archangel. What you said penetrated\nmy thoughts at once. Before then, I know not even whether I believed in\nGod. Since I have known you, I have learnt to pray. I used to say to\nDouce, dress me quickly, lest I should be late at the service; and I\nhastened to the church. Such it was with me to love some one. I did not\nknow the cause. I said to myself, how devout I am becoming. It is from\nyou that I have learnt that I do not go to church for God's service. It\nis true; I went for your sake. You spoke so well, and when you raised\nyour arms to heaven, you seemed to hold my heart within your two white\nhands. I was foolish; but I did not know it. Shall I tell you your\nfault? It was your coming to me in the garden; it was your speaking to\nme. If you had said nothing, I should have known nothing. If you had\ngone, I should, perhaps, have been sad, but now I should die. Since I\nknow that I love you, you cannot leave me. Of what are you thinking? You\ndo not seem to listen to me.\"\n\nCaudray replied:\n\n\"You heard what was said last night?\"\n\n\"Ah, me!\"\n\n\"What can I do against that?\"\n\nThey were silent for a moment. Caudray continued:\n\n\"There is but one duty left to me. It is to depart.\"\n\n\"And mine to die. Oh! how I wish there was no sea, but only sky. It\nseems to me as if that would settle all, and that our departure would be\nthe same. It was wrong to speak to me; why did you speak to me? Do not\ngo. What will become of me? I tell you I shall die. You will be far off\nwhen I shall be in my grave. Oh! my heart will break. I am very\nwretched; yet my uncle is not unkind.\"\n\nIt was the first time in her life that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had ever said \"my\nuncle.\" Until then she had always said \"my father.\"\n\nCaudray stepped back, and made a sign to the boatman. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette heard\nthe sound of the boat-hook among the shingle, and the step of the man on\nthe gunwale of the boat.\n\n\"No! no!\" cried D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\n\"It must be, D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette,\" replied Caudray.\n\n\"No! never! For the sake of an engine--impossible. Did you see that\nhorrible man last night? You cannot abandon me thus. You are wise; you\ncan find a means. It is impossible that you bade me come here this\nmorning with the idea of leaving me. I have never done anything to\ndeserve this; you can have no reproach to make me. Is it by that vessel\nthat you intended to sail? I will not let you go. You shall not leave\nme. Heaven does not open thus to close so soon. I know you will remain.\nBesides, it is not yet time. Oh! how I love you.\"\n\nAnd pressing closely to him, she interlaced the fingers of each hand\nbehind his neck, as if partly to make a bond of her two arms for\ndetaining him, and partly with her joined hands to pray. He moved away\nthis gentle restraint, while D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette resisted as long as she could.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette sank upon a projection of the rock covered with ivy, lifting\nby an unconscious movement the sleeve of her dress up to the elbow, and\nexhibiting her graceful arm. A pale suffused light was in her eyes. The\nboat was approaching.\n\nCaudray held her head between his hands. He touched her hair with a sort\nof religious care, fixed his eyes upon her for some moments, then kissed\nher on the forehead fervently, and in an accent trembling with anguish,\nand in which might have been traced the uprooting of his soul, he\nuttered the word which has so often resounded in the depths of the human\nheart, \"Farewell!\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette burst into loud sobs.\n\nAt this moment they heard a voice near them, which said solemnly and\ndeliberately:\n\n\"Why should you not be man and wife?\"\n\nCaudray raised his head. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette looked up.\n\nGilliatt stood before them.\n\nHe had approached by a bye-path.\n\nHe was no longer the same man that he had appeared on the previous\nnight. He had arranged his hair, shaved his beard, put on shoes, and a\nwhite shirt, with a large collar turned over, sailor fashion. He wore a\nsailor's costume, but all was new. A gold ring was on his little finger.\nHe seemed profoundly calm. His sunburnt skin had become pale: a hue of\nsickly bronze overspread it.\n\nThey looked at him astonished. Though so changed, D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette recognised\nhim. But the words which he had spoken were so far from what was passing\nin their minds at that moment, that they had left no distinct\nimpression.\n\nGilliatt spoke again:\n\n\"Why should you say farewell? Be man and wife, and go together.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette started. A trembling seized her from head to foot.\n\nGilliatt continued:\n\n\"Miss Lethierry is a woman. She is of age. It depends only on herself.\nHer uncle is but her uncle. You love each other----\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette interrupted in a gentle voice, and asked, \"How came you\nhere?\"\n\n\"Make yourselves one,\" repeated Gilliatt.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette began to have a sense of the meaning of his words. She\nstammered out:\n\n\"My poor uncle!\"\n\n\"If the marriage was yet to be,\" said Gilliatt, \"he would refuse. When\nit is over he will consent. Besides, you are going to leave here. When\nyou return he will forgive.\"\n\nGilliatt added, with a slight touch of bitterness, \"And then he is\nthinking of nothing just now but the rebuilding of his boat. This will\noccupy his mind during your absence. The Durande will console him.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, in a state of stupor which was not without\nits gleam of joy. \"I must not leave him unhappy.\"\n\n\"It will be but for a short time,\" answered Gilliatt.\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had been, as it were, bewildered. They recovered\nthemselves now. The meaning of Gilliatt's words became plainer as their\nsurprise diminished. There was a slight cloud still before them; but\ntheir part was not to resist. We yield easily to those who come to\nsave. Objections to a return into Paradise are weak. There was something\nin the attitude of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, as she leaned imperceptibly upon her\nlover, which seemed to make common cause with Gilliatt's words. The\nenigma of the presence of this man, and of his utterances, which, in the\nmind of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette in particular, produced various kinds of\nastonishment, was a thing apart. He said to them, \"Be man and wife!\"\nThis was clear; if there was responsibility, it was his. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had\na confused feeling that, for many reasons, he had the right to decide\nupon her fate. Caudray murmured, as if plunged in thought, \"An uncle is\nnot a father.\"\n\nHis resolution was corrupted by the sudden and happy turn in his ideas.\nThe probable scruples of the clergyman melted, and dissolved in his\nheart's love for D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nGilliatt's tone became abrupt and harsh, and like the pulsations of\nfever.\n\n\"There must be no delay,\" he said. \"You have time, but that is all.\nCome.\"\n\nCaudray observed him attentively; and suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\"I recognise you. It was you who saved my life.\"\n\nGilliatt replied:\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Yonder,\" said Caudray, \"at the extremity of the Banques.\"\n\n\"I do not know the place,\" said Gilliatt.\n\n\"It was on the very day that I arrived here.\"\n\n\"Let us lose no time,\" interrupted Gilliatt.\n\n\"And if I am not deceived, you are the man whom we met last night.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\nGilliatt raised his voice:\n\n\"Boatman! wait there for us. We shall return soon. You asked me, Miss\nLethierry, how I came to be here. The answer is very simple. I walked\nbehind you. You are twenty-one. In this country, when persons are of\nage, and depend only on themselves, they may be married immediately. Let\nus take the path along the water-side. It is passable; the tide will not\nrise here till noon. But lose no time. Come with me.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette and Caudray seemed to consult each other by a glance. They\nwere standing close together motionless. They were intoxicated with joy.\nThere are strange hesitations sometimes on the edge of the abyss of\nhappiness. They understood, as it were, without understanding.\n\n\"His name is Gilliatt,\" whispered D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nGilliatt interrupted them with a sort of tone of authority.\n\n\"What do you linger for?\" he asked. \"I tell you to follow me.\"\n\n\"Whither?\" asked Caudray.\n\n\"There!\"\n\nAnd Gilliatt pointed with his finger towards the spire of the church.\n\nGilliatt walked on before, and they followed him. His step was firm; but\nthey walked unsteadily.\n\nAs they approached the church, an expression dawned upon those two pure\nand beautiful countenances, which was soon to become a smile. The\napproach to the church lighted them up. In the hollow eyes of Gilliatt\nthere was the darkness of night. The beholder might have imagined that\nhe saw a spectre leading two souls to Paradise.\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette scarcely took count of what had happened. The\ninterposition of this man was like the branch clutched at by the\ndrowning. They followed their guide with the docility of despair,\nleaning on the first comer. Those who feel themselves near death easily\naccept the accident which seems to save. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, more ignorant of\nlife, was more confident. Caudray was thoughtful. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was of age,\nit was true. The English formalities of marriage are simple, especially\nin primitive parts, where the clergyman has almost a discretionary\npower; but would the Dean consent to celebrate the marriage without even\ninquiring whether the uncle consented? This was the question.\nNevertheless, they could learn. In any case there would be but a delay.\n\nBut what was this man? and if it was really he whom Lethierry the night\nbefore had declared should be his son-in-law, what could be the meaning\nof his actions? The very obstacle itself had become a providence.\nCaudray yielded; but his yielding was only the rapid and tacit assent of\na man who feels himself saved from despair.\n\nThe pathway was uneven, and sometimes wet and difficult to pass.\nCaudray, absorbed in thought, did not observe the occasional pools of\nwater or the heaps of shingle. But from time to time Gilliatt turned and\nsaid to him, \"Take heed of those stones. Give her your hand.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE FORETHOUGHT OF SELF-SACRIFICE\n\n\nIt struck ten as they entered the church.\n\nBy reason of the early hour, and also on account of the desertion of the\ntown that day, the church was empty.\n\nAt the farther end, however, near the table which in the reformed church\nfulfils the place of the altar, there were three persons. They were the\nDean, his evangelist, and the registrar. The Dean, who was the Reverend\nJaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode, was seated; the evangelist and the registrar stood\nbeside him.\n\nA book was open upon the table.\n\nBeside him, upon a credence-table, was another book. It was the parish\nregister, and also open; and an attentive eye might have remarked a page\non which was some writing, of which the ink was not yet dry. By the side\nof the register were a pen and a writing-desk.\n\nThe Reverend Jaquemin H\u00c3\u00a9rode rose on perceiving Caudray.\n\n\"I have been expecting you,\" he said. \"All is ready.\"\n\nThe Dean, in fact, wore his officiating robes.\n\nCaudray looked towards Gilliatt.\n\nThe Reverend Doctor added, \"I am at your service, brother;\" and he\nbowed.\n\nIt was a bow which neither turned to right or left. It was evident from\nthe direction of the Dean's gaze that he did not recognise the existence\nof any one but Caudray, for Caudray was a clergyman and a gentleman.\nNeither D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, who stood aside, nor Gilliatt, who was in the rear,\nwere included in the salutation. His look was a sort of parenthesis in\nwhich none but Caudray were admitted. The observance of these little\nniceties constitutes an important feature in the maintenance of order\nand the preservation of society.\n\nThe Dean continued, with a graceful and dignified urbanity:\n\n\"I congratulate you, my colleague, from a double point of view. You have\nlost your uncle, and are about to take a wife; you are blessed with\nriches on the one hand, and happiness on the other. Moreover, thanks to\nthe boat which they are about to rebuild, Mess Lethierry will also be\nrich; which is as it should be. Miss Lethierry was born in this parish;\nI have verified the date of her birth in the register. She is of age,\nand at her own disposal. Her uncle, too, who is her only relative,\nconsents. You are anxious to be united immediately on account of your\napproaching departure. This I can understand; but this being the\nmarriage of the rector of the parish, I should have been gratified to\nhave seen it associated with a little more solemnity. I will consult\nyour wishes by not detaining you longer than necessary. The essentials\nwill be soon complied with. The form is already drawn up in the\nregister, and it requires only the names to be filled in. By the terms\nof the law and custom, the marriage may be celebrated immediately after\nthe inscription. The declaration necessary for the licence has been duly\nmade. I take upon myself a slight irregularity; for the application for\nthe licence ought to have been registered seven days in advance; but I\nyield to necessity and the urgency of your departure. Be it so, then. I\nwill proceed with the ceremony. My evangelist will be the witness for\nthe bridegroom; as regards the witness for the bride----\"\n\nThe Dean turned towards Gilliatt. Gilliatt made a movement of his head.\n\n\"That is sufficient,\" said the Dean.\n\nCaudray remained motionless; D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was happy, but no less powerless\nto move.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" continued the Dean, \"there is still an obstacle.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette started.\n\nThe Dean continued:\n\n\"The representative here present of Mess Lethierry applied for the\nlicence for you, and has signed the declaration on the register.\" And\nwith the thumb of his left hand the Dean pointed to Gilliatt, which\nprevented the necessity of his remembering his name. \"The messenger from\nMess Lethierry,\" he added, \"has informed me this morning that being too\nmuch occupied to come in person, Mess Lethierry desired that the\nmarriage should take place immediately. This desire, expressed verbally,\nis not sufficient. In consequence of having to grant the licence, and of\nthe irregularity which I take upon myself, I cannot proceed so rapidly\nwithout informing myself from Mess Lethierry personally, unless some one\ncan produce his signature. Whatever might be my desire to serve you, I\ncannot be satisfied with a mere message. I must have some written\ndocument.\"\n\n\"That need not delay us,\" said Gilliatt. And he presented a paper to the\nDean. The Dean took it, perused it by a glance, seemed to pass over some\nlines as unimportant, and read aloud: \"Go to the Dean for the licence.\nI wish the marriage to take place as soon as possible. Immediately would\nbe better.\"\n\nHe placed the paper on the table, and proceeded:\n\n\"It is signed, Lethierry. It would have been more respectful to have\naddressed himself to me. But since I am called on to serve a colleague,\nI ask no more.\"\n\nCaudray glanced again at Gilliatt. There are moments when mind and mind\ncomprehend each other. Caudray felt that there was some deception; he\nhad not the strength of purpose, perhaps he had not the idea of\nrevealing it. Whether in obedience to a latent heroism, of which he had\nbegun to obtain a glimpse; or whether from a deadening of the\nconscience, arising from the suddenness of the happiness placed within\nhis reach, he uttered no word.\n\nThe Dean took the pen, and aided by the clerk, filled up the spaces in\nthe page of the register; then he rose, and by a gesture invited Caudray\nand D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette to approach the table.\n\nThe ceremony commenced. It was a strange moment. Caudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\nstood beside each other before the minister. He who has ever dreamed of\na marriage in which he himself was chief actor, may conceive something\nof the feeling which they experienced.\n\nGilliatt stood at a little distance in the shadow of the pillars.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, on rising in the morning, desperate, thinking only of death\nand its associations, had dressed herself in white. Her attire, which\nhad been associated in her mind with mourning, was suited to her\nnuptials. A white dress is all that is necessary for the bride.\n\nA ray of happiness was visible upon her face. Never had she appeared\nmore beautiful. Her features were remarkable for prettiness rather than\nwhat is called beauty. Their fault, if fault it be, lay in a certain\nexcess of grace. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette in repose, that is, neither disturbed by\npassion or grief, was graceful above all. The ideal virgin is the\ntransfiguration of a face like this. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, touched by her sorrow\nand her love, seemed to have caught that higher and more holy\nexpression. It was the difference between the field daisy and the lily.\n\nThe tears had scarcely dried upon her cheeks; one perhaps still lingered\nin the midst of her smiles. Traces of tears indistinctly visible form a\npleasing but sombre accompaniment of joy.\n\nThe Dean, standing near the table, placed his finger upon the open book,\nand asked in a distinct voice whether they knew of any impediment to\ntheir union.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n\"Amen!\" said the Dean.\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette advanced a step or two towards the table.\n\n\"Joseph Ebenezer Caudray, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded\nwife?\"\n\nCaudray replied \"I will.\"\n\nThe Dean continued:\n\n\"Durande D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette Lethierry, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded\nhusband?\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, in an agony of soul, springing from her excess of happiness,\nmurmured rather than uttered--\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nThen followed the beautiful form of the Anglican marriage service. The\nDean looked around, and in the twilight of the church uttered the solemn\nwords:\n\n\"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\"\n\nGilliatt answered, \"I do!\"\n\nThere was an interval of silence. Caudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette felt a vague\nsense of oppression in spite of their joy.\n\nThe Dean placed D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's right hand in Caudray's; and Caudray\nrepeated after him:\n\n\"I take thee, Durande D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette to be my wedded wife, for better for\nworse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to\ncherish till death do us part; and thereto I plight thee my troth.\"\n\nThe Dean then placed Caudray's right hand in that of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, and\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette said after him:\n\n\"I take thee to be my wedded husband for better for worse, for richer\nfor poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish till death\ndo us part; and thereto I plight thee my troth.\"\n\nThe Dean asked, \"Where is the ring?\" The question took them by surprise.\nCaudray had no ring; but Gilliatt took off the gold ring which he wore\nupon his little finger. It was probably the wedding-ring which had been\nsold that morning by the jeweller in the Commercial Arcade.\n\nThe Dean placed the ring upon the book; then handed it to Caudray, who\ntook D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's little trembling left hand, passed the ring over her\nfourth finger, and said:\n\n\"With this ring I thee wed!\"\n\n\"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\"\ncontinued the Dean.\n\n\"Amen,\" said his evangelist.\n\nThen the Dean said, \"Let us pray.\"\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette turned towards the table, and knelt down.\n\nGilliatt, standing by, inclined his head.\n\nSo they knelt before God; while he seemed to bend under the burden of\nhis fate.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nFOR YOUR WIFE: WHEN YOU MARRY\n\n\nAs they left the church they could see the _Cashmere_ making\npreparations for her departure.\n\n\"You are in time,\" said Gilliatt.\n\nThey chose again the path leading to the Havelet.\n\nCaudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette went before, Gilliatt this time walking behind\nthem. They were two somnambulists. Their bewilderment had not passed\naway, but only changed in form. They took no heed of whither they were\ngoing, or of what they did. They hurried on mechanically, scarcely\nremembering the existence of anything, feeling that they were united for\never, but scarcely able to connect two ideas in their minds. In ecstasy\nlike theirs it is as impossible to think as it is to swim in a torrent.\nIn the midst of their trouble and darkness they had been plunged in a\nwhirlpool of delight; they bore a paradise within themselves. They did\nnot speak, but conversed with each other by the mysterious sympathy of\ntheir souls. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette pressed Caudray's arm to her side.\n\nThe footsteps of Gilliatt behind them reminded them now and then that he\nwas there. They were deeply moved, but could find no words. The excess\nof emotion results in stupor. Theirs was delightful, but overwhelming.\nThey were man and wife: every other idea was postponed to that. What\nGilliatt had done was well; that was all that they could grasp. They\nexperienced towards their guide a deep but vague gratitude in their\nhearts. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette felt that there was some mystery to be explained, but\nnot now. Meanwhile they accepted their unexpected happiness. They felt\nthemselves controlled by the abruptness and decision of this man who\nconferred on them so much happiness with a kind of authority. To\nquestion him, to talk with him seemed impossible. Too many impressions\nrushed into their minds at once for that. Their absorption was\npardonable.\n\nEvents succeed each other sometimes with the rapidity of hailstones.\nTheir effect is overpowering; they deaden the senses. Falling upon\nexistences habitually calm, they render incidents rapidly unintelligible\neven to those whom they chiefly concern; we become scarcely conscious of\nour own adventures; we are overwhelmed without guessing the cause, or\ncrowned with happiness without comprehending it. For some hours\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette had been subjected to every kind of emotion: at first,\nsurprise and delight at meeting Caudray in the garden; then horror at\nthe monster whom her uncle had presented as her husband; then her\nanguish when the angel of her dreams spread his wings and seemed about\nto depart; and now her joy, a joy such as she had never known before,\nfounded on an inexplicable enigma; the monster of last night himself\nrestoring her lover; marriage arising out of her torture; this Gilliatt,\nthe evil destiny of last night, become to-day her saviour! She could\nexplain nothing to her own mind. It was evident that all the morning\nGilliatt had had no other occupation than that of preparing the way for\ntheir marriage: he had done all: he had answered for Mess Lethierry,\nseen the Dean, obtained the licence, signed the necessary declaration;\nand thus the marriage had been rendered possible. But D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\nunderstood it not. If she had, she could not have comprehended the\nreasons. They did nothing but close their eyes to the world,\nand--grateful in their hearts--yield themselves up to the guidance of\nthis good demon. There was no time for explanations, and expressions of\ngratitude seemed too insignificant. They were silent in their trance of\nlove.\n\nThe little power of thought which they retained was scarcely more than\nsufficient to guide them on their way--to enable them to distinguish the\nsea from the land, and the _Cashmere_ from every other vessel.\n\nIn a few minutes they were at the little creek.\n\nCaudray entered the boat first. At the moment when D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was about\nto follow, she felt her sleeve held gently. It was Gilliatt, who had\nplaced his finger upon a fold of her dress.\n\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"you are going on a journey unexpectedly. It has\nstruck me that you would have need of dresses and clothes. You will find\na trunk aboard the _Cashmere_, containing a lady's clothing. It came to\nme from my mother. It was intended for my wife if I should marry.\nPermit me to ask your acceptance of it.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette, partially aroused from her dream, turned towards him.\nGilliatt continued, in a voice which was scarcely audible:\n\n\"I do not wish to detain you, madam, but I feel that I ought to give you\nsome explanation. On the day of your misfortune, you were sitting in the\nlower room; you uttered certain words; it is easy to understand that you\nhave forgotten them. We are not compelled to remember every word we\nspeak. Mess Lethierry was in great sorrow. It was certainly a noble\nvessel, and one that did good service. The misfortune was recent; there\nwas a great commotion. Those are things which one naturally forgets. It\nwas only a vessel wrecked among the rocks; one cannot be always thinking\nof an accident. But what I wished to tell you was, that as it was said\nthat no one would go, I went. They said it was impossible; but it was\nnot. I thank you for listening to me a moment. You can understand,\nmadam, that if I went there, it was not with the thought of displeasing\nyou. This is a thing, besides, of old date. I know that you are in\nhaste. If there was time, if we could talk about this, you might perhaps\nremember. But this is all useless now. The history of it goes back to a\nday when there was snow upon the ground. And then on one occasion that I\npassed you, I thought that you looked kindly on me. This is how it was.\nWith regard to last night, I had not had time to go to my home. I came\nfrom my labour; I was all torn and ragged; I startled you, and you\nfainted. I was to blame; people do not come like that to strangers'\nhouses; I ask your forgiveness. This is nearly all I had to say. You are\nabout to sail. You will have fine weather; the wind is in the east.\nFarewell. You will not blame me for troubling you with these things.\nThis is the last minute.\"\n\n\"I am thinking of the trunk you spoke of,\" replied D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette. \"Why do\nyou not keep it for your wife, when you marry?\"\n\n\"It is most likely, madam,\" replied Gilliatt, \"that I shall never\nmarry.\"\n\n\"That would be a pity,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette; \"you are so good.\"\n\nAnd D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette smiled. Gilliatt returned her smile.\n\nThen he assisted her to step into the boat.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour afterwards Caudray and D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette were\naboard the _Cashmere_ in the roads.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE GREAT TOMB\n\n\nGilliatt walked along the water-side, passed rapidly through St. Peter's\nPort, and then turned towards St. Sampson by the seashore. In his\nanxiety to meet no one whom he knew, he avoided the highways now filled\nwith foot-passengers by his great achievement.\n\nFor a long time, as the reader knows, he had had a peculiar manner of\ntraversing the country in all parts without being observed. He knew the\nbye-paths, and favoured solitary and winding routes; he had the shy\nhabits of a wild beast who knows that he is disliked, and keeps at a\ndistance. When quite a child, he had been quick to feel how little\nwelcome men showed in their faces at his approach, and he had gradually\ncontracted that habit of being alone which had since become an instinct.\n\nHe passed through the Esplanade, then by the Salerie. Now and then he\nturned and looked behind him at the _Cashmere_ in the roads, which was\nbeginning to set her sails. There was little wind; Gilliatt went faster\nthan the _Cashmere_. He walked with downcast eyes among the lower rocks\nat the water's edge. The tide was beginning to rise.\n\nSuddenly he stopped, and, turning his back, contemplated for some\nminutes a group of oaks beyond the rocks which concealed the road to\nVale. They were the oaks at the spot called the Basses Maisons. It was\nthere that D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette once wrote with her finger the name of Gilliatt in\nthe snow. Many a day had passed since that snow had melted away.\n\nThen he pursued his way.\n\nThe day was beautiful; more beautiful than any that had yet been seen\nthat year. It was one of those spring days when May suddenly pours forth\nall its beauty, and when nature seems to have no thought but to rejoice\nand be happy. Amidst the many murmurs from forest and village, from the\nsea and the air, a sound of cooing could be distinguished. The first\nbutterflies of the year were resting on the early roses. Everything in\nnature seemed new--the grass, the mosses, the leaves, the perfumes, the\nrays of light. The sun shone as if it had never shone before. The\npebbles seemed bathed in coolness. Birds but lately fledged sang out\ntheir deep notes from the trees, or fluttered among the boughs in their\nattempts to use their new-found wings. There was a chattering all\ntogether of goldfinches, pewits, tomtits, woodpeckers, bullfinches, and\nthrushes. The blossoms of lilacs, May lilies, daphnes, and melilots\nmingled their various hues in the thickets. A beautiful kind of\nwater-weed peculiar to Guernsey covered the pools with an emerald green;\nwhere the kingfishers and the water-wagtails, which make such graceful\nlittle nests, came down to bathe their wings. Through every opening in\nthe branches appeared the deep blue sky. A few lazy clouds followed each\nother in the azure depths. The ear seemed to catch the sound of kisses\nsent from invisible lips. Every old wall had its tufts of wallflowers.\nThe plum-trees and laburnums were in blossom; their white and yellow\nmasses gleamed through the interlacing boughs. The spring showered all\nher gold and silver on the woods. The new shoots and leaves were green\nand fresh. Calls of welcome were in the air; the approaching summer\nopened her hospitable doors for birds coming from afar. It was the time\nof the arrival of the swallows. The clusters of furze-bushes bordered\nthe steep sides of hollow roads in anticipation of the clusters of the\nhawthorn. The pretty and the beautiful reigned side by side; the\nmagnificent and the graceful, the great and the little, had each their\nplace. No note in the great concert of nature was lost. Green\nmicroscopic beauties took their place in the vast universal plan in\nwhich all seemed distinguishable as in limpid water. Everywhere a divine\nfulness, a mysterious sense of expansion, suggested the unseen effort of\nthe sap in movement. Guttering things glittered more than ever; loving\nnatures became more tender. There was a hymn in the flowers, and a\nradiance in the sounds of the air. The wide-diffused harmony of nature\nburst forth on every side. All things which felt the dawn of life\ninvited others to put forth shoots. A movement coming from below, and\nalso from above, stirred vaguely all hearts susceptible to the scattered\nand subterranean influence of germination. The flower shadowed forth the\nfruit; young maidens dreamed of love. It was nature's universal bridal.\nIt was fine, bright, and warm; through the hedges in the meadows\nchildren were seen laughing and playing at their games. The fruit-trees\nfilled the orchards with their heaps of white and pink blossom. In the\nfields were primroses, cowslips, milfoil, daffodils, daisies, speedwell,\njacinths, and violets. Blue borage and yellow irises swarmed with those\nbeautiful little pink stars which flower always in groups, and are\nhence called \"companions.\" Creatures with golden scales glided between\nthe stones. The flowering houseleek covered the thatched roofs with\npurple patches. Women were plaiting hives in the open air; and the bees\nwere abroad, mingling their humming with the murmurs from the sea.\nNature, sensitive to the touch of spring, exhaled delight.\n\nWhen Gilliatt arrived at St. Sampson, the water had not yet risen at the\nfurther end of the harbour, and he was able to cross it dry-footed\nunperceived behind the hulls of vessels fixed for repair. A number of\nflat stones were placed there at regular distances to make a causeway.\n\nHe was not observed. The crowd was at the other end of the port, near\nthe narrow entrance, by the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es. There his name was in every mouth.\nThey were, in fact, speaking about him so much that none paid attention\nto him. He passed, sheltered in some degree by the very commotion that\nhe had caused.\n\nHe saw from afar the sloop in the place where he had moored it, with the\nfunnel standing between its four chains; observed a movement of\ncarpenters at their work, and confused outlines of figures passing to\nand fro; and he could distinguish the loud and cheery voice of Mess\nLethierry giving orders.\n\nHe threaded the narrow alleys behind the Brav\u00c3\u00a9es. There was no one there\nbeside him. All curiosity was concentrated on the front of the house. He\nchose the footpath alongside the low wall of the garden, but stopped at\nthe angle where the wild mallow grew. He saw once more the stone where\nhe used to pass his time; saw once more the wooden garden seat where\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette was accustomed to sit, and glanced again at the pathway of\nthe alley where he had seen the embrace of two shadows which had\nvanished.\n\nHe soon went on his way, climbed the hill of Vale Castle, descended\nagain, and directed his steps towards the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue.\n\nThe Houmet-Paradis was a solitude.\n\nHis house was in the same state in which he had left it in the morning,\nafter dressing himself to go to St. Peter's Port.\n\nA window was open, through which his bagpipe might have been seen\nhanging to a nail upon the wall.\n\nUpon the table was the little Bible given to him in token of gratitude\nby the stranger whom he now knew as Caudray.\n\nThe key was in the door. He approached; placed his hand upon it; turned\nit twice in the lock, put the key in his pocket, and departed.\n\nHe walked not in the direction of the town, but towards the sea.\n\nHe traversed his garden diagonally, taking the shortest way without\nregard to the beds, but taking care not to tread upon the plants which\nhe placed there, because he had heard that they were favourites with\nD\u00c3\u00a9ruchette.\n\nHe crossed the parapet wall, and let himself down upon the rocks.\n\nGoing straight on, he began to follow the long ridge of rocks which\nconnected the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue with the great natural obelisk of granite\nrising erect from the sea, which was known as the Beast's Horn. This was\nthe place of the Gild-Holm-'Ur seat.\n\nHe strode on from block to block like a giant among mountains. To make\nlong strides upon a row of breakers is like walking upon the ridge of a\nroof.\n\nA fisherwoman with dredge-nets, who had been walking naked-footed among\nthe pools of sea-water at some distance, and had just regained the\nshore, called to him, \"Take care; the tide is coming.\" But he held on\nhis way.\n\nHaving arrived at the great rock of the point, the Horn, which rises\nlike a pinnacle from the sea, he stopped. It was the extremity of the\npromontory.\n\nHe looked around.\n\nOut at sea a few sailing boats at anchor were fishing. Now and then\nrivulets of silver glittered among them in the sun: it was the water\nrunning from the nets. The _Cashmere_ was not yet off St. Sampson. She\nhad set her main-topsail, and was between Herm and Jethou.\n\nGilliatt rounded the rock, and came under the Gild-Holm-'Ur seat, at the\nfoot of that kind of abrupt stairs where, less than three months before,\nhe had assisted Caudray to come down. He ascended.\n\nThe greater number of the steps were already under water. Two or three\nonly were still dry, by which he climbed.\n\nThe steps led up to the Gild-Holm-'Ur seat. He reached the niche,\ncontemplated it for a moment, pressed his hand upon his eyes, and let it\nglide gently from one eyelid to the other--a gesture by which he seemed\nto obliterate the memory of the past--then sat down in the hollow, with\nthe perpendicular wall behind him, and the ocean at his feet.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ at that moment was passing the great round half-submerged\ntower, defended by one sergeant and a cannon, which marks the half way\nin the roads between Herm and St. Peter's Port.\n\nA few flowers stirred among the crevices in the rock about Gilliatt's\nhead. The sea was blue as far as eye could reach. The wind came from the\neast; there was a little surf in the direction of the island of Sark, of\nwhich only the western side is visible from Guernsey. In the distance\nappeared the coast of France like a mist, with the long yellow strips of\nsand about Carteret. Now and then a white butterfly fluttered by. The\nbutterflies frequently fly out to sea.\n\nThe breeze was very slight. The blue expanse, both above and below, was\ntranquil. Not a ripple agitated those species of serpents, of an azure\nmore or less dark, which indicate on the surface of the sea the lines of\nsunken rocks.\n\nThe _Cashmere_, little moved by the wind, had set her topsail and\nstudding-sails to catch the breeze. All her canvas was spread, but the\nwind being a side one, her studding-sails only compelled her to hug the\nGuernsey coast more closely. She had passed the beacon of St. Sampson,\nand was off the hill of Vale Castle. The moment was approaching when she\nwould double the point of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue.\n\nGilliatt watched her approach.\n\nThe air and sea were still. The tide rose not by waves, but by an\nimperceptible swell. The level of the water crept upward without a\npalpitation. The subdued murmur from the open sea was soft as the\nbreathing of a child.\n\nIn the direction of the harbour of St. Sampson, faint echoes could be\nheard of carpenters' hammers. The carpenters were probably the workmen\nconstructing the tackle, gear, and apparatus for removing the engine\nfrom the sloop. The sounds, however, scarcely reached Gilliatt by reason\nof the mass of granite at his back.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ approached with the slowness of a phantom.\n\nGilliatt watched it still.\n\nSuddenly a touch and a sensation of cold caused him to look down. The\nsea had reached his feet.\n\nHe lowered his eyes, then raised them again.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ was quite near.\n\nThe rock in which the rains had hollowed out the Gild-Holm-'Ur seat was\nso completely vertical, and there was so much water at its base, that in\ncalm weather vessels were able to pass without danger within a few\ncables' lengths.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ was abreast of the rock. It rose straight upwards as if\nit had grown out of the water; or like the lengthening out of a shadow.\nThe rigging showed black against the heavens and in the magnificent\nexpanse of the sea. The long sails, passing for a moment over the sun,\nbecame lighted up with a singular glory and transparence. The water\nmurmured indistinctly; but no other noise marked the majestic gliding of\nthat outline. The deck was as visible as if he had stood upon it.\n\nThe steersman was at the helm; a cabin-boy was climbing the shrouds; a\nfew passengers leaning on the bulwarks were contemplating the beauty of\nthe scene. The captain was smoking; but nothing of all this was seen by\nGilliatt.\n\nThere was a spot on the deck on which the broad sunlight fell. It was on\nthis corner that his eyes were fixed. In this sunlight were D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette\nand Caudray. They were sitting together side by side, like two birds,\nwarming themselves in the noonday sun, upon one of those covered seats\nwith a little awning which well-ordered packet-boats provided for\npassengers, and upon which was the inscription, when it happened to be\nan English vessel, \"For ladies only.\" D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's head was leaning upon\nCaudray's shoulder; his arm was around her waist; they held each other's\nhands with their fingers interwoven. A celestial light was discernible\nin those two faces formed by innocence. Their chaste embrace was\nexpressive of their earthly union and their purity of soul. The seat was\na sort of alcove, almost a nest; it was at the same time a glory round\nthem; the tender aureola of love passing into a cloud.\n\nThe silence was like the calm of heaven.\n\nCaudray's gaze was fixed in contemplation. D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette's lips moved; and,\namidst that perfect silence, as the wind carried the vessel near shore,\nand it glided within a few fathoms of the Gild-Holm-'Ur seat, Gilliatt\nheard the tender and musical voice of D\u00c3\u00a9ruchette exclaiming:\n\n\"Look yonder. It seems as if there were a man upon the rock.\"\n\nThe vessel passed.\n\nLeaving the promontory of the B\u00c3\u00bb de la Rue behind, the _Cashmere_ glided\non upon the waters. In less than a quarter of an hour, her masts and\nsails formed only a white obelisk, gradually decreasing against the\nhorizon. Gilliatt felt that the water had reached his knees.\n\nHe contemplated the vessel speeding on her way.\n\nThe breeze freshened out at sea. He could see the _Cashmere_ run out her\nlower studding-sails and her staysails, to take advantage of the rising\nwind. She was already clear of the waters of Guernsey. Gilliatt followed\nthe vessel with his eyes.\n\nThe waves had reached his waist.\n\nThe tide was rising: time was passing away.\n\nThe seamews and cormorants flew about him restlessly, as if anxious to\nwarn him of his danger. It seemed as if some of his old companions of\nthe Douvres rocks flying there had recognised him.\n\nAn hour had passed.\n\nThe wind from the sea was scarcely felt in the roads; but the form of\nthe _Cashmere_ was rapidly growing less. The sloop, according to all\nappearance, was sailing fast. It was already nearly off the Casquets.\n\nThere was no foam around the Gild-Holm-'Ur; no wave beat against its\ngranite sides. The water rose peacefully. It was nearly level with\nGilliatt's shoulders.\n\nAnother hour had passed.\n\nThe _Cashmere_ was beyond the waters of Aurigny. The Ortach rock\nconcealed it for a moment; it passed behind it, and came forth again as\nfrom an eclipse. The sloop was veering to the north upon the open sea.\nIt was now only a point glittering in the sun.\n\nThe birds were hovering about Gilliatt, uttering short cries. Only his\nhead was now visible. The tide was nearly at the full. Evening was\napproaching. Behind him, in the roads, a few fishing-boats were making\nfor the harbour.\n\nGilliatt's eyes continued fixed upon the vessel in the horizon. Their\nexpression resembled nothing earthly. A strange lustre shone in their\ncalm and tragic depths. There was in them the peace of vanished hopes,\nthe calm but sorrowful acceptance of an end far different from his\ndreams. By degrees the dusk of heaven began to darken in them, though\ngazing still upon the point in space. At the same moment the wide waters\nround the Gild-Holm-'Ur and the vast gathering twilight closed upon\nthem.\n\nThe _Cashmere_, now scarcely perceptible, had become a mere spot in the\nthin haze.\n\nGradually, the spot, which was but a shape, grew paler.\n\nThen it dwindled, and finally disappeared.\n\nAt the moment when the vessel vanished on the line of the horizon, the\nhead of Gilliatt disappeared. Nothing was visible now but the sea.\n\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED, BUNGAY,\nSUFFOLK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Toilers of the Sea, by Victor Hugo\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOILERS OF THE SEA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32338-8.txt or 32338-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/2\/3\/3\/32338\/\n\nProduced by StevenGibbs, Jane Hyland and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":301,"split":"train"}
