He wins many academic prizes and his future seems promising. Then his Cockney uncle arrives intending to open an eating-house adjacent to the college. Godwin is mortified of being associated with 'trade' and leaves the college rather than face the scorn he expects to receive from his upper-class fellow students.This is indicative of his social aspirations (upwards) and snobbery (downwards).\nHe moves to London where he abhors the social mores of the lower orders and pines to be accepted into high society where he believes his intellect should place him. He sees writing as a possible entry and pens a fiercely critical article on the Church of England and its attitude to Darwinism. It is published anonymously but not before word of its true authorship has spread within his small circle of friends. These include Christian Moxey, who has an idealised romantic fixation on a married woman (ultimately found to be unrequited), Moxey's sister Marcella has a likewise unrequited crush on Godwin Peak, and Malkin-a flighty Bohemian who has an idea of training an adolescent girl to be a wife worthy of his radical views, and who has formed a relationship with Mrs.Jacox and her daughters to further this plan (ultimately successful).\nAfter submitting the article Peak goes on holiday to the West Country stopping of in Exeter where he encounters the Warricombe family (minor gentry) whose son Buckland he was at Whitelaw with (Peak once visited the family as a child and was smitten by their daughter Sidwell). He trails the family around Exeter until he has an 'accidental' encounter with Buckland and gets invited to their house. He meets Sidwell, now a beautiful and devoutly religious woman, and in a hypocritical volte face Peak declares himself a Christian and whats more his intent to take Holy Orders. This plan would give him two things he desires,an upper class wife and entry into a socially higher class through his vocation. He stays in Exeter to execute his plan and proximity to the Warricombes, especially Sidwell and her father, seems to be getting him closer to his goals.\nHowever Buckland Warricombe distrusts him, seeing him as a social upstart, and seeks out Peak's London friends to ascertain his motives. He meets with the Moxeys and while there Malkin arrives, whose mouth runs away with him, exposing Peak's authorship of the article thus revealing Peak as a fraud and hypocrite. Marcella does not stop Malkin despite knowing the consequences for Peak, as it suits her ends to hamper Peak and Sidwell's relationship. Ironically Marcella is shown to be a better mate for Peak but he is more interested in Sidwell's beauty and social position.\nBuckland exposes Peak as a hypocrite and possible fraudster to Sidwell and her father (who liked Peak believing him to be sympathetic to his anti-evolutionary Anglicanism). However Sidwell has fallen in love with Peak and forgives him but Peak feels he cannot stay in Exeter and be shamed by the revelation of his hypocrisy, reminiscent of his leaving college rather than be associated with tradespeople.\nThey part but keep up a cool, sporadic correspondence for some years. Then Marcella Moxey is killed while trying to prevent a horse being beaten and leaves her considerable wealth to Peak. He reluctantly accepts it (she had previously offered him money but he refused it) and now an independent man of means he proposes marriage to Sidwell. She almost accepts him but out of love and loyalty to her family, and father in particular, she turns him down. Denied his aspiration to marry into society Peak goes on a tour of Europe where he contracts Malaria and dies alone in a Viennese boarding-house.

At eleven in the morning (just as a\nheavy shower fell from the smoke-canopy above the roaring streets) the\nmunicipal authorities, educational dignitaries, and prominent burgesses\nof Kingsmill assembled on an open space before the College to unveil a\nstatue of Sir Job Whitelaw. The honoured baronet had been six months\ndead. Living, he opposed the desire of his fellow-citizens to exhibit\neven on canvas his gnarled features and bald crown; but when his\nmodesty ceased to have a voice in the matter, no time was lost in\nraising a memorial of the great manufacturer, the self-made\nmillionaire, the borough member in three Parliaments, the enlightened\nand benevolent founder of an institute which had conferred humane\ndistinction on the money-making Midland town. Beneath such a sky,\norations were necessarily curtailed; but Sir Job had always been\nimpatient of much talk. An interval of two or three hours dispersed the\nrain-clouds and bestowed such grace of sunshine as Kingsmill might at\nthis season temperately desire; then, whilst the marble figure was\ngetting dried,--with soot-stains which already foretold its negritude\nof a year hence,--again streamed towards the College a varied\nmultitude, official, parental, pupillary. The students had nothing\ndistinctive in their garb, but here and there flitted the cap and gown\nof Professor or lecturer, signal for doffing of beavers along the line\nof its progress.\n\nAmong the more deliberate of the throng was a slender, upright,\nruddy-cheeked gentleman of middle age, accompanied by his wife and a\ndaughter of sixteen. On alighting from a carriage, they first of all\ndirected their steps towards the statue, conversing together with\npleasant animation. The father (Martin Warricombe, Esq. of Thornhaw, a\nsmall estate some five miles from Kingsmill,) had a countenance\nsuggestive of engaging qualities--genial humour, mildness, a turn for\nmeditation, perhaps for study. His attire was informal, as if he\ndisliked abandoning the freedom of the country even when summoned to\nurban ceremonies. He wore a grey felt hat, and a light jacket which\ndisplayed the straightness of his shoulders. Mrs. Warricombe and her\ndaughter were more fashionably equipped, with taste which proclaimed\ntheir social standing. Save her fresh yet delicate complexion the lady\nhad no particular personal charm. Of the young girl it could only be\nsaid that she exhibited a graceful immaturity, with perchance a little\nmore earnestness than is common at her age; her voice, even when she\nspoke gaily, was seldom audible save by the person addressed.\n\nComing to a pause before Sir Job, Mr. Warricombe put on a pair of\neyeglasses which had dangled against his waistcoat, and began to\nscrutinise carefully the sculptured lineaments. He was addressing\ncertain critical remarks to his companions when an interruption\nappeared in the form of a young man whose first words announced his\nrelation to the group.\n\n'I say, you're very late! There'll be no getting a decent seat, if you\ndon't mind. Leave Sir Job till afterwards.'\n\n'The statue somehow disappoints me,' observed his father, placidly.\n\n'Oh, it isn't bad, I think,' returned the youth, in a voice not unlike\nhis father's, save for a note of excessive self-confidence. He looked\nabout eighteen; his comely countenance, with its air of robust health\nand habitual exhilaration, told of a boyhood passed amid free and\njoyous circumstances. It was the face of a young English plutocrat,\nwith more of intellect than such visages are wont to betray; the native\nvigour of his temperament had probably assimilated something of the\nmodern spirit. 'I'm glad,' he continued, 'that they haven't stuck him\nin a toga, or any humbug of that sort. The old fellow looks baggy, but\nso he was. They ought to have kept his chimney-pot, though. Better than\ngiving him those scraps of hair, when everyone knows he was as bald as\na beetle.'\n\n'Sir Job should have been granted Caesar's privilege,' said Mr.\nWarricombe, with a pleasant twinkle in his eyes.\n\n'What was that?' came from the son, with abrupt indifference.\n\n'For shame, Buckland!'\n\n'What do I care for Caesar's privileges? We can't burden our minds with\nthat antiquated rubbish nowadays. You would despise it yourself,\nfather, if it hadn't got packed into your head when you were young.'\n\nThe parent raised his eyebrows in a bantering smile.\n\n'I have lived to hear classical learning called antiquated rubbish.\nWell, well!--Ha! there is Professor Gale.'\n\nThe Professor of Geology, a tall man, who strode over the pavement as\nif he were among granite hills, caught sight of the party and\napproached. His greeting was that of a familiar friend; he addressed\nyoung Warricombe and his sister by their Christian names, and inquired\nafter certain younger members of the household. Mr Warricombe,\nregarding him with a look of repressed eagerness, laid a hand on his\narm, and spoke in the subdued voice of one who has important news to\ncommunicate.\n\n'If I am not much mistaken, I have chanced on a new species of\n_homalonotus_!'\n\n'Indeed!--not in your kitchen garden, I presume?'\n\n'Hardly. Dr Pollock sent me a box of specimens the other day'--\n\nBuckland saw with annoyance the likelihood of prolonged discussion.\n\n'I don't know whether you care to remain standing all the afternoon,'\nhe said to his mother. 'At this rate we certainly shan't get seats.'\n\n'We will walk on, Martin,' said the lady, glancing at her husband.\n\n'We come! we come!' cried the Professor, with a wave of his arm.\n\nThe palaeontological talk continued as far as the entrance of the\nassembly hall. The zest with which Mr. Warricombe spoke of his\ndiscovery never led him to raise his voice above the suave, mellow\nnote, touched with humour, which expressed a modest assurance. Mr Gale\nwas distinguished by a blunter mode of speech; he discoursed with\nopen-air vigour, making use now and then of a racy colloquialism which\nthe other would hardly have permitted himself.\n\nAs young Warricombe had foreseen, the seats obtainable were none too\nadvantageous; only on one of the highest rows of the amphitheatre could\nthey at length establish themselves.\n\n'Buckland will enjoy the more attention when he marches down to take\nhis prizes,' observed the father. 'He must sit at the end here, that he\nmayn't have a struggle to get out.'\n\n'Don't, Martin, don't!' urged his wife, considerately.\n\n'Oh, it doesn't affect me,' said Buckland, with a laugh.\n\n'I feel pretty sure I have got the Logic and the Chemistry, and those\nare what I care most about. I dare say Peak has beaten me in Geology.'\n\nThe appearance in the lower part of the hall of a dark-robed\nprocession, headed by the tall figure of the Principal, imposed a\nmoment's silence, broken by outbursts of welcoming applause. The\nProfessors of Whitelaw College were highly popular, not alone with the\nmembers of their classes, but with all the educated inhabitants of\nKingsmill; and deservedly, for several of them bore names of wide\nrecognition, and as a body they did honour to the institution which had\nwon their services. With becoming formality they seated themselves in\nface of the public. On tables before them were exposed a considerable\nnumber of well-bound books, shortly to be distributed among the\ncollegians, who gazed in that direction with speculative eyes.\n\nAmong the general concourse might have been discovered two or three\nrepresentatives of the wage-earning multitude which Kingsmill depended\nupon for its prosperity, but their presence was due to exceptional\ncircumstances; the College provided for proletarian education by a\nsystem of evening classes, a curriculum necessarily quite apart from\nthat followed by the regular students. Kingsmill, to be sure, was no\nnurse of Toryism; the robust employers of labour who sent their sons to\nWhitelaw--either to complete a training deemed sufficient for an active\ncareer, or by way of transition-stage between school and\nuniversity--were for the most part avowed Radicals, in theory scornful\nof privilege, practically supporters of that mode of freedom which\nregards life as a remorseless conflict. Not a few of the young men\n(some of these the hardest and most successful workers) came from poor,\nmiddle-class homes, whence, but for Sir Job's foundation, they must\nhave set forth into the world with no better equipment of knowledge\nthan was supplied by some 'academy' of the old type: a glance\ndistinguished such students from the well-dressed and well-fed\noffspring of Kingsmill plutocracy. The note of the assembly was\nsomething other than refinement; rather, its high standard of health,\nspirits, and comfort--the characteristic of Capitalism. Decent\nreverence for learning, keen appreciation of scientific power, warm\nliberality of thought and sentiment within appreciable limits,\nenthusiasm for economic, civic, national ideals,--such attributes were\nabundantly discoverable in each serried row. From the expanse of\ncountenances beamed a boundless self-satisfaction. To be connected in\nany way with Whitelaw formed a subject of pride, seeing that here was\nthe sturdy outcome of the most modern educational endeavour, a\nnoteworthy instance of what Englishmen can do for themselves, unaided\nby bureaucratic machinery. Every student who achieved distinction in\nto-day's class lists was felt to bestow a share of his honour upon each\nspectator who applauded him.\n\nWith occasional adjustment of his eye-glasses, and smiling his smile of\nmodest tolerance, Mr. Warricombe surveyed the crowded hall. His\nconnection with the town was not intimate, and he could discover few\nfaces that were familiar to him. A native and, till of late, an\ninhabitant of Devon, he had come to reside on his property near\nKingsmill because it seemed to him that the education of his children\nwould be favoured by a removal thither. Two of his oldest friends held\nprofessorships at Whitelaw; here, accordingly, his eldest son was\nmaking preparation for Cambridge, whilst his daughter attended classes\nat the admirable High School, of which Kingsmill was only less proud\nthan of its College.\n\nSeated between his father and his sister, Buckland drew their attention\nto such persons or personages as interested his very selective mind.\n\n'Admire the elegant languor of Wotherspoon,' he remarked, indicating\nthe Professor of Greek. 'Watch him for a moment, and you'll see him\nglance contemptuously at old Plummer. He can't help it; they hate each\nother.'\n\n'But why?' whispered the girl, with timid eagerness.\n\n'Oh, it began, they say, when Plummer once had to take one of\nWotherspoon's classes; some foolery about a second aorist. Thank\ngoodness, I don't understand the profound dispute.--Oh, do look at that\nfatuous idiot Chilvers!'\n\nThe young gentleman of whom he spoke, a student of Buckland's own\nstanding, had just attracted general notice. Rising from his seat in\nthe lower part of the amphitheatre, at the moment when all were hushed\nin anticipation of the Principal's address, Mr. Chilvers was beckoning\nto someone whom his eye had descried at great distance, and for whom,\nas he indicated by gesture, he had preserved a place.\n\n'See how it delights him to make an exhibition of himself!' pursued the\ncensorious youth. 'I'd bet a sovereign he's arranged it all. Look how\nhe brandishes his arm to display his cuffs and gold links. Now he\ntouches his hair, to point out how light and exquisite it is, and how\nbeautifully he parts it!'\n\n'What a graceful figure!' murmured Mrs. Warricombe, with genuine\nadmiration.\n\n'There, that's just what he hopes everyone is saying,' replied her son,\nin a tone of laughing disgust.\n\n'But he certainly is graceful, Buckland,' persisted the lady.\n\n'And in the meantime,' remarked Mr. Warricombe, drily, 'we are all\nawaiting the young gentleman's pleasure.'\n\n'Of course; he enjoys it. Almost all the people on that row belong to\nhim--father, mother, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, and cousins to\nthe fourth degree. Look at their eyes fondly fixed upon him! Now he\npretends to loosen his collar at the throat, just for a change of\nattitude--the puppy!'\n\n'My dear!' remonstrated his mother, with apprehensive glance at her\nneighbours.\n\n'But he is really clever, isn't he, Buckland?' asked the sister, her\nname was Sidwell.\n\n'After a fashion. I shouldn't wonder if he takes a dozen or two prizes.\nIt's all a knack, you know.'\n\n'Where is your friend Peak?' Mr. Warricombe made inquiry.\n\nBut at this moment Mr. Chilvers abandoned his endeavour and became\nseated, allowing the Principal to rise, manuscript in hand. Buckland\nleaned back with an air of resignation to boredom; his father bent\nslightly forward, with lips close pressed and brows wrinkled; Mrs\nWarricombe widened her eyes, as if hearing were performed with those\norgans, and assumed the smile she would have worn had the speaker been\naddressing her in particular. Sidwell's blue eyes imitated the movement\nof her mother's, with a look of profound gravity which showed that she\nhad wholly forgotten herself in reverential listening; only when five\nminutes' strict attention induced a sense of weariness did she allow a\nglance to stray first along the professorial rank, then towards the\nplace where the golden head of young Chilvers was easily\ndistinguishable.\n\nNothing could be more satisfactory than the annual report summarised by\nPrincipal Nares, whose mellifluous voice and daintily pedantic\nutterance fell upon expectant hearing with the impressiveness of\npersonal compliment. So delivered, statistics partook of the grace of\nculture; details of academic organisation acquired something more than\nsecular significance. In this the ninth year of its existence, Whitelaw\nCollege was flourishing in every possible way. Private beneficence had\nendowed it with new scholarships and exhibitions; the scheme of\nlectures had been extended; the number of its students steadily\nincreased, and their successes in the field of examination had been\nnoteworthy beyond precedent. Truly, the heart of their founder, to whom\nhonour had this day been rendered, must have gladdened if he could but\nhave listened to the story of dignified progress! Applause, loud and\nlong, greeted the close of the address. Buckland Warricombe was\nprobably the only collegian who disdained to manifest approval in any\nway.\n\n'Why don't you clap?' asked his sister, who, girl-like, was excited to\nwarmth of cheek and brightness of eye by the enthusiasm about her.\n\n'That kind of thing is out of date,' replied the young man, thrusting\nhis hands deep into his pockets.\n\nAs Professor of Logic and Moral Philosophy, Dr Nares began the\ndistribution of prizes. Buckland, in spite of his resolve to exhibit no\nweakness, waited with unmistakable tremor for the announcement of the\nleading name, which might possibly be his own. A few words of comment\nprefaced the declaration:--never had it been the Professor's lot to\nreview more admirable papers than those to which he had awarded the\nfirst prize. The name of the student called upon to come forward\nwas--Godwin Peak.\n\n'Beaten!' escaped from Buckland's lips.\n\nMrs. Warricombe glanced at her son with smiling sympathy; Sidwell,\nwhose cheek had paled as her nerves quivered under the stress of\nexpectancy, murmured a syllable of disappointment; Mr. Warricombe set\nhis brows and did not venture to look aside. A moment, and all eyes\nwere directed upon the successful student, who rose from a seat\nhalf-way down the hall and descended the middle passage towards the row\nof Professors. He was a young man of spare figure and unhealthy\ncomplexion, his age not easily conjectured. Embarrassment no doubt\naccounted for much of the awkwardness of his demeanour; but, under any\ncircumstances, he must have appeared ungainly, for his long arms and\nlegs had outgrown their garments, which were no fashionable specimens\nof tailoring. The nervous gravity of his countenance had a peculiar\nsternness; one might have imagined that he was fortifying his\nself-control with scorn of the elegantly clad people through whom he\npassed. Amid plaudits, he received from the hands of the Principal a\ncouple of solid volumes, probably some standard work of philosophy,\nand, thus burdened, returned with hurried step to his place.\n\n'No one expected that,' remarked Buckland to his father. 'He must have\ncrammed furiously for the exam. It's outside his work for the First\nB.A.'\n\n'What a shame!' Sidwell whispered to her mother; and the reply was a\nlook which eloquently expressed Mrs. Warricombe's lack of sympathy with\nthe victor.\n\nBut a second prize had been awarded. As soon as silence was restored,\nthe Principal's gracious voice delivered a summons to 'Buckland Martin\nWarricombe.' A burst of acclamation, coming especially from that part\nof the amphitheatre where Whitelaw's nurslings had gathered in greatest\nnumbers, seemed to declare the second prizeman distinctly more popular\nthan the first. Preferences of this kind are always to be remarked on\nsuch occasions.\n\n'Second prize be hanged!' growled the young man, as, with a flush of\nshame on his ruddy countenance, he set forth to receive the honour,\nleaving Mr. Warricombe convulsed with silent laughter.\n\n'He would far rather have had nothing at all,' murmured Sidwell, who\nshared her brother's pique and humiliation.\n\n'Oh, it'll do him good,' was her father's reply. 'Buckland has got into\na way of swaggering.'\n\nUndeniable was the swagger with which the good-looking, breezy lad went\nand returned.\n\n'What is the book?' inquired Mr. Warricombe.\n\n'I don't know.--Oh, Mill's _Logic_. Idiotic choice! They might have\nknown I had it already.'\n\n'They clap him far more than they did Mr. Peak,' Sidwell whispered to\nher mother, with satisfaction.\n\nBuckland kept silence for a few minutes, then muttered:\n\n'There's nothing I care about now till Chemistry and Geology. Here\ncomes old Wotherspoon. Now we shall know who is strongest in second\naorists. I shouldn't wonder if Peak takes both Senior Greek and Latin.\nI heartily hope he'll beat that ass Chilvers.'\n\nBut the name so offensive to young Warricombe was the first that issued\nfrom the Professor's lips. Beginning with the competition for a special\nclassical prize, Professor Wotherspoon announced that the honours had\nfallen to 'Bruno Leathwaite Chilvers.'\n\n'That young man is not badly supplied with brains, say what you will,'\nremarked Mr. Warricombe.\n\nUpon Bruno Leathwaite Chilvers keen attention was directed; every pair\nof female eyes studied his graces, and female hands had a great part in\nthe applause that greeted his arising. Applause different in kind from\nthat hitherto bestowed; less noisy, but implying, one felt, a more\ndelicate spirit of commendation. With perfect self-command, with\nsingular facial decorum, with a walk which betokened elegant\nathleticism and safely skirted the bounds of foppery, Mr. Chilvers\ndischarged the duty he was conscious of owing to a multitude of\nkinsfolk, friends, admirers. You would have detected something clerical\nin the young man's air. It became the son of a popular clergyman, and\ngave promise of notable aptitude for the sacred career to which Bruno\nLeathwaite, as was well understood, already had designed himself. In\nmatters sartorial he presented a high ideal to his fellow-students;\nthis seemly attention to externals, and the delicate glow of health\ndiscernible through the golden down of his cheeks, testified the\ncompatibility of hard study and social observances. Bruno had been\nheard to say that the one thing it behoved Whitelaw to keep carefully\nin mind was the preservation of 'tone', a quality far less easy to\ncultivate than mere academic excellence.\n\n'How clever he must be!' purred Mrs. Warricombe. 'If he lives, he will\nsome day be an archbishop.'\n\nBuckland was leaning back with his eyes closed, disgusted at the\nspectacle. Nor did he move when Professor Wotherspoon's voice made the\nnext announcement.\n\n'In Senior Greek, the first prize is taken by--Bruno Leathwaite\nChilvers.'\n\n'Then I suppose Peak comes second,' muttered Buckland.\n\nSo it proved. Summoned to receive the inferior prize, Godwin Peak, his\ncountenance harsher than before, his eyes cast down, moved ungracefully\nto the estrade. And during the next half-hour this twofold exhibition\nwas several times repeated. In Senior Latin, in Modern and Ancient\nHistory, in English Language and Literature, in French, first sounded\nthe name of Chilvers, whilst to the second award was invariably\nattached that of Peak. Mrs. Warricombe's delight expressed itself in\nevery permissible way: on each occasion she exclaimed, 'How clever he\nis!' Sidwell cast frequent glances at her brother, in whom a shrewder\neye could have divined conflict of feelings--disgust at the\nglorification of Chilvers and involuntary pleasure in the successive\ndefeats of his own conqueror in Philosophy. Buckland's was by no means\nan ignoble face; venial malice did not ultimately prevail in him.\n\n'It's Peak's own fault,' he declared at length, with vexation.\n'Chilvers stuck to the subjects of his course. Peak has been taking up\nhalf-a-dozen extras, and they've done for him. I shouldn't wonder if he\nwent in for the Poem and the Essay: I know he was thinking about both.'\n\nWhether Godwin Peak had or had not endeavoured for these two prizes\nremained uncertain. When, presently, the results of the competition\nwere made known, it was found that in each case the honour had fallen\nto a young man hitherto undistinguished. His name was John Edward\nEarwaker. Externally he bore a sort of generic resemblance to Peak, for\nhis face was thin and the fashion of his clothing indicated narrow\nmeans.\n\n'I never heard you mention him,' said Mr. Warricombe, turning to his\nson with an air of surprise.\n\n'I scarcely know him at all; he's only in one or two of my classes.\nPeak is thick with him.'\n\nThe subject of the prize poem was 'Alaric'; that of the essay, 'Trades\nUnionism'. So it was probable that John Edward Earwaker did not lack\nversatility of intellect.\n\nOn the rising of the Professor of Chemistry, Buckland had once more to\nsubdue signs of expectancy. He knew he had done good papers, but his\nconfidence in the result was now clouded by a dread of the second\nprize--which indeed fell to him, the first being taken by a student of\nno account save in this very special subject. Keen was his\nmortification; he growled, muttered, shrugged his shoulders nervously.\n\n'If I had foreseen this, you'd never have caught me here,' was his\nreply, when Sidwell whispered consolation.\n\nThere still remained a chance for him, signalled by the familiar form\nof Professor Gale. Geology had been a lifelong study with Martin\nWarricombe, and his son pursued it with hereditary aptitude. Sidwell\nand her mother exchanged a look of courageous hope; each felt convinced\nthat the genial Professor could not so far disregard private feeling as\nto place Buckland anywhere but at the head of the class.\n\n'The results of the examination are fairly good; I'm afraid I can't say\nmore than that,' thus rang out Mr. Gale's hearty voice. 'As for the\nfirst two names on my list, I haven't felt justified in placing either\nbefore the other. I have bracketed them, and there will be two prizes.\nThe names are--Godwin Peak and Buckland Martin Warricombe.'\n\n'He might have mentioned Buckland first,' murmured Mrs. Warricombe,\nresentfully.\n\n'He of course gave them out in alphabetical order,' answered her\nhusband.\n\n'Still, it isn't right that Buckland should come second.'\n\n'That's absurd,' was the good-natured reply.\n\nThe lady of course remained unconvinced, and for years she nourished a\npique against Professor Gale, not so much owing to his having bracketed\nher son as because the letter P has alphabetical precedence of W.\n\nIn what remained of the proceedings the Warricombes had no personal\ninterest. For a special reason, however, their attention was excited by\nthe rising of Professor Walsh, who represented the science of Physics.\nEarly in the present year had been published a speculative treatise\nwhich, owing to its supposed incompatibility with Christian dogmas,\nprovoked much controversy and was largely discussed in all educated\ncircles. The work was anonymous, but a rumour which gained general\ncurrency attributed it to Professor Walsh. In the year 1874 an\nimputation of religious heresy was not lightly to be incurred by a\nProfessor--even Professor of Physics--at an English college. There were\nmany people in Kingsmill who considered that Mr. Walsh's delay in\nrepudiating so grave a charge rendered very doubtful the propriety of\nhis retaining the chair at Whitelaw. Significant was the dispersed\napplause which followed slowly upon his stepping forward to-day; on the\nProfessor's face was perchance legible something like a hint of amused\ndefiance. Ladies had ceased to beam; they glanced meaningly at one\nanother, and then from under their eyelids at the supposed heretic.\n\n'A fine fellow, Walsh!' exclaimed Buckland, clapping vigorously.\n\nHis father smiled, but with some uneasiness. Mrs. Warricombe whispered\nto Sidwell:\n\n'What a very disagreeable face! The only one of the Professors who\ndoesn't seem a gentleman.'\n\nThe girl was aware of dark reports affecting Mr. Walsh's reputation.\nShe hazarded only a brief examination of his features, and looked at\nthe applauding Buckland with alarm.\n\n'His lectures are splendid,' said her brother, emphatically. 'If I were\ngoing to be here next session, I should take them.'\n\nFor some minutes after the Professor's return to his seat a susurration\nwas audible throughout the hall; bonnets bent together, and beards\nexchanged curt comments.\n\nThe ceremony, as is usual with all ceremonies, grew wearisome before\nits end. Buckland was deep in one of the chapters of his geologic prize\nwhen the last speaker closed the last report and left the assembly free\nto disperse. Then followed the season of congratulations: Professors,\nstudents, and the friendly public mingled in a _conversazione_. A\nnucleus of vivacious intercourse formed at the spot where young Mr.\nChilvers stood amid trophies of examinational prowess. When his\nnumerous relatives had all shaken hands with him, and laughed, smiled,\nor smirked their felicitations, they made way for the press of eager\nacquaintances. His prize library was reverently surveyed, and many were\nthe sportive sallies elicited by the victor's obvious inability to\ncarry away what he had won. Suavely exultant, ready with his reply to\nevery flattering address, Bruno Chilvers exhibited a social tact in\nadvance of his years: it was easy to imagine what he would become when\nOxford terms and the seal of ordination had matured his youthful\npromise.\n\nAt no great distance stood his competitor, Godwin Peak embarrassed, he\nalso, with wealth of spoils; but about this young man was no concourse\nof admiring kinsfolk. No lady offered him her hand or shaped\ncompliments for him with gracious lips. Half-a-dozen fellow-students,\namong them John Earwaker, talked in his vicinity of the day's results.\nPeak's part in the gossip was small, and when he smiled it was in a\nforced, anxious way, with brief raising of his eyes. For a moment only\nwas the notice of a wider circle directed upon him when Dr Nares,\nmoving past with a train of colloquial attendants, turned aside to\nrepeat his praise of the young man's achievements in Philosophy: he\nbestowed a kindly shake of the hand, and moved on.\n\nThe Warricombe group descended, in purposeless fashion, towards the\nspot where Chilvers held his court. Their personal acquaintance with\nBruno and his family was slight, and though Mrs. Warricombe would\ngladly have pushed forward to claim recognition, natural diffidence\nrestrained her. Sidwell kept in the rear, risking now and then a glance\nof vivid curiosity on either hand. Buckland, striving not to look\npetulant or sullen, allowed himself to be led on; but when he became\naware of the tendency Bruno-wards, a protest broke from him.\n\n'There's no need to swell that fellow's conceit. Here, father, come and\nhave a word with Peak; he looks rather down in the mouth among his\nsecond prizes.'\n\nMr. Warricombe having beckoned his companions, they reluctantly\nfollowed to the more open part of the hall.\n\n'It's very generous of Buckland,' fell from the lady's lips, and she at\nlength resolved to show an equal magnanimity. Peak and Earwaker were\nconversing together when Buckland broke in upon them with genial\noutburst.\n\n'Confound it, Peak! what do you mean by getting me stuck into a\nbracket?'\n\n'I had the same question to as _you_,' returned the other, with a grim\nsmile.\n\nMr. Warricombe came up with extended hand.\n\n'A species of bracket,' he remarked, smiling benevolently, 'which no\nalgebraic process will remove. Let us hope it signifies that you and\nBuckland will work through life shoulder to shoulder in the field of\ngeology. What did Professor Gale give you?'\n\nBefore he could reply, Peak had to exchange greetings with Mrs\nWarricombe and her daughter. Only once hitherto had he met them. Six\nmonths ago he had gone out with Buckland to the country-house and\npassed an afternoon there, making at the time no very favourable\nimpression on his hostess. He was not of the young men who easily\ninsinuate themselves into ladies' affections: his exterior was against\nhim, and he seemed too conscious of his disadvantages in that\nparticular. Mrs. Warricombe found it difficult to shape a few civil\nphrases for the acceptance of the saturnine student. Sidwell, repelled\nand in a measure alarmed by his bilious countenance, could do no more\nthan grant him her delicately gloved fingers. Peak, for his part, had\nnothing to say. He did not even affect an interest in these persons,\nand turned his eyes to follow the withdrawing Earwaker. Mr. Warricombe,\nhowever, had found topic for discourse in the prize volume; he began to\ncomment on the excellence of certain sections of the book.\n\n'Do you go home?' interrupted Buckland, addressing the question to his\nrival. 'Or do you stay in Kingsmill until the First B.A.?'\n\n'I shall go home,' replied Peak, moving uneasily.\n\n'Perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you at Thornhaw when you\nare up again for the examination?' said Mrs. Warricombe, with faltering\ntongue.\n\n'I'm afraid I shan't be able to come, thank you,' was the awkward\nresponse.\n\nBuckland's voice came to the relief.\n\n'I daresay I may look in upon you at your torture. Good luck, old\nfellow! If we don't see each other again, write to me at Trinity before\nthe end of the year.'\n\nAs soon as she was sufficiently remote, Mrs. Warricombe ejaculated in a\nsubdued voice of irritation:\n\n'Such a very unprepossessing young man I never met! He seems to have no\nbreeding whatever.'\n\n'Overweighted with brains,' replied her husband; adding to himself,\n'and by no means so with money, I fear.'\n\nOpportunity at length offering, Mrs. Warricombe stepped into the circle\nirradiated by Bruno Chilvers; her husband and Sidwell pressed after.\nBuckland, with an exclamation of disgust, went off to criticise the\nhero among a group of his particular friends.\n\nGodwin Peak stood alone. On the bench where he had sat were heaped the\nprize volumes (eleven in all, some of them massive), and his wish was\nto make arrangements for their removal. Gazing about him, he became\naware of the College librarian, with whom he was on friendly terms.\n\n'Mr. Poppleton, who would pack and send these books away for me?'\n\n'An _embarras de richesse_!' laughed the librarian. 'If you like to\ntell the porter to take care of them for the present, I shall be glad\nto see that they are sent wherever you like.'\n\nPeak answered with a warmth of acknowledgment which seemed to imply\nthat he did not often receive kindnesses. Before long he was free to\nleave the College, and at the exit he overtook Earwaker, who carried a\nbrown paper parcel.\n\n'Come and have some tea with me across the way, will you?' said the\nliterary prizeman. 'I have a couple of hours to wait for my train.'\n\n'All right. I envy you that five-volume Spenser.'\n\n'I wish they had given me five authors I don't possess instead. I think\nI shall sell this.'\n\nEarwaker laughed as he said it--a strange chuckle from deep down in his\nthroat. A comparison of the young men, as they walked side by side,\nshowed that Peak was of better physical type than his comrade. Earwaker\nhad a slight, unshapely body and an ill-fitting head; he walked with\nexcessive strides and swung his thin arm nervously. Probably he was the\nelder of the two, and he looked twenty. For Peak's disadvantages of\nperson, his studious bashfulness and poverty of attire were mainly\nresponsible. With improvement in general health even his features might\nhave a tolerable comeliness, or at all events would not be\ndisagreeable. Earwaker's visage was homely, and seemed the more so for\nhis sprouting moustache and beard.\n\n'Have you heard any talk about Walsh?' the latter inquired, as they\nwalked on.\n\nPeak shrugged his shoulders, with a laugh.\n\n'No. Have you?'\n\n'Some women in front of me just now were-evidently discussing him. I\nheard \"How shocking!\" and \"Disgraceful!\"'\n\nPeak's eyes flashed, and he exclaimed in a voice of wrath:\n\n'Besotted idiots! How I wish I were in Walsh's position! How I should\nenjoy standing up before the crowd of fools and seeing their fear of\nme! But I couldn't keep it to myself; I should give in to the\ntemptation to call them blockheads and jackasses.'\n\nEarwaker was amused at his friend's vehemence. He sympathised with it,\nbut had an unyouthful sobriety in the expression of his feelings.\n\n'Most likely he despises them far too much to be disturbed by what they\nthink of him. But, I say, isn't it desperately comical that one human\nbeing can hate and revile another because they think differently about\nthe origin of the universe? Couldn't you roar with laughter when you've\nthought over it for a moment? \"You be damned for your theory of\nirregular verbs!\" is nothing to it.' And he uttered his croak of mirth,\nwhilst Peak, with distorted features, laughed in rage and scorn.\n\nThey had crossed the open space in front of the College buildings, and\nwere issuing into the highway, when a voice very unlike those that were\nwont to sound within the academic precincts (or indeed in the streets\nof Kingsmill) made sudden demand upon Peak's attention.\n\n'Thet you, Godwin? Thoughts I, it must be 'im! 'Ow goes it, my bo-oy?\nYou 'ardly reckonise me, I dessay, and I couldn't be sure as it was you\ntill I'd 'ed a good squint at yer. I've jest called round at your\nlodgin's, and they towld me as you was at the Collige.'\n\nHe who thus accosted the student, with the most offensive purity of\nCockney accent, was a man of five-and-forty, dressed in a new suit of\nready-made tweeds, the folding crease strongly marked down the front of\nthe trousers and the coat sleeves rather too long. His face bore a\nstrong impress of vulgarity, but at the same time had a certain\ningenuousness, a self-absorbed energy and simplicity, which saved it\nfrom being wholly repellent; the brow was narrow, the eyes small and\nbright, and the coarse lips half hid themselves under a struggling\nreddish growth. In these lineaments lurked a family resemblance to\nGodwin Peak, sufficient to support a claim of kindred which at this\nmoment might have seemed improbable. At the summons of recognition\nGodwin stood transfixed; his arms fell straight, and his head drew back\nas if to avoid a blow. For an instant he was clay colour, then a hot\nflush broke upon his cheeks.\n\n'I shan't be able to go with you,' he said, in a thick, abrupt voice,\naddressing Earwaker but not regarding him. 'Good-bye!'\n\nThe other offered his hand and, without speaking, walked away.\n\n'Prize-dye at the Collige, they tell me,' pursued Godwin's relative,\nlooking at a cluster of people that passed. 'What 'ave you took?'\n\n'One or two class-prizes,' replied the student, his eyes on the ground.\n'Shall we walk to my lodgings?'\n\n'I thought you might like to walk me over the show. But pr'aps you're\nin a 'urry?'\n\n'No, no. But there's nothing particular to see. I think the\nlecture-rooms are closed by now.'\n\n'Oo's the gent as stands there?--the figger, I mean.'\n\n'Sir Job Whitelaw, founder of the College.'\n\n'Job, eh? And was you a-goin' 'ome to yer tea, Godwin?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Well, then, look 'ere, 'spose we go to the little shop opposyte--nice\nlittle plyce it looks. I could do a cup o' tea myself, and we can 'ev a\nquite confab. It's a long time since we'ed a talk together. I come over\nfrom Twybridge this mornin'; slep' there last night, and saw yer mother\nan' Oliver. They couldn't give me a bed, but that didn't mike no\nmatter; I put up at the Norfolk Harms--five-an-six for bed an'\nbreakfast. Come along, my bo-oy; I stand treat.'\n\nGodwin glanced about him. From the College was approaching what seemed\nto be a formal procession; it consisted of Bruno Chilvers, supported on\neither hand by ladies and followed by an admiring train.\n\n'You had better come to my lodgings with me, uncle,' said the young man\nhurriedly, moving forward.\n\n'No, no; I won't be no expense to you, Godwin, bo-oy. And I 'ave a\nreason for wantin' to go to the little shop opposyte.'\n\nAlready several collegians had passed, giving Peak a nod and scanning\nhis companion; a moment's delay and Chilvers would be upon him. Without\nanother word, Godwin moved across the broad street to the place of\nrefreshment which his uncle had indicated, and whither Earwaker had\npreceded them. It was a pastry-cook's, occasionally visited by the\nalumni of Whitelaw. In the rear of the shop a little room offered seats\nand tables, and here, Godwin knew, Earwaker would be found.\n\n'Let us go up-stairs,' he said, leading to a side entrance. 'There's a\nquieter room.'\n\n'Right you are!'\n\nThe uncle--his name was Andrew Peak--paused to make a survey of the\npremises. When he entered, his scrutiny of the establishment was close,\nand he seemed to reflect with interest upon all he saw. The upper room\nwas empty; a long table exhibited knives and forks, but there were no\nsigns of active business. Andrew pulled a bell-rope; the summons was\nanswered by an asthmatic woman, who received an order for tea, toast,\n'watercreases', and sundry other constituents of a modest meal.\n\n'Come 'ere often, Godwin?' inquired Andrew, as he stood by the window\nand mused.\n\n'Now and then, for a bun.'\n\n'Much custom from your show over the wye?'\n\n'Not so much as a better place would have.'\n\n'Young gents don't live at the Collige, they tell me?'\n\n'No, there's no residence.'\n\n'So naturally they want a plyce where they can 'ev a nibble, somewheres\n'andy?'\n\n'Yes. We have to go further into the town for a decent dinner.'\n\n'Jest what I thought!' exclaimed Andrew, slapping his leg. 'With a\nestablishment like that opposyte, there'd ought to be a medium-sized\nSpiers & Pond at this 'ere street corner for any man as knows 'is wye\nabout. That's _my_ idea, Godwin--see?'\n\nPeak had as yet given but half an ear to his relative's discourse; he\nhad answered mechanically, and only now was constrained to serious\nattention by a note of meaning in the last interrogative. He looked at\nthe speaker; and Andrew, in the manner of one accustomed to regard life\nas a game of cunning, first winked with each eye, then extended one\ncheek with the pressure of his tongue. Sickened with disgust, Godwin\nturned suddenly away,--a movement entirely lost upon his uncle, who\nimagined the young man to be pondering a fruitful suggestion.\n\n'I don't mind tellin' you, Godwin,' pursued Andrew presently, in a\ncautious voice, laying an open hand against his trousers-pocket, 'as\nI've been a-doin' pretty good business lytely. Been growin' a bit--see?\nI'm runnin' round an' keepin' my heyes open understand? Thoughts I,\nnow, if I could come acrosst a nicet little openin', somethink in the\nrest'rant line, _that's_ what 'ud sewt me jest about down to the\nground. I'm cut out for it--see? I've got the practical experience, and\nI've got the capital; and as soon as I got a squint of this little\ncorner shop--understand what I mean?'\n\nHis eyes gleamed with eagerness which was too candid for the typically\nvulgar mind. In his self-satisfaction he exhibited a gross cordiality\nwhich might have made rather an agreeable impression on a person\notherwise disinterested.\n\nAt this point the asthmatic woman reappeared, carrying a laden tray.\nAndrew at once entered into conversation with her, framing his remarks\nand queries so as to learn all he could concerning the state of the\nbusiness and the disposition of its proprietors. His nephew, meanwhile,\nstung to the core with shame, kept apart, as if amusing himself with\nthe prospect from the window, until summoned to partake of the meal.\nHis uncle expressed contempt of everything laid before them.\n\n'_This_ ain't no wye of caterin' for young gents at Collige!' he\nexclaimed. 'If there ain't a openin' 'ere, then I never see one.\nGodwin, bo-oy, 'ow much longer'll it be before you're out of you're\ntime over there?'\n\n'It's uncertain--I can't say.'\n\n'But ain't it understood as you stay till you've passed the top\nstandard, or whatever it's called?'\n\n'I really haven't made up my mind what to do.'\n\n'But you'll be studyin' 'ere for another twelve months, I dessay?'\n\n'Why do you ask?'\n\n'Why? cos s'posin' I got 'old o' this 'ere little shop, or another like\nit close by, me an' you might come to an understandin'--see? It might\nbe worth your while to give a 'int to the young gents as you're in\nwith--eh?'\n\nGodwin was endeavouring to masticate a piece of toast, but it turned to\nsawdust upon his palate. Of a sudden, when the bilious gloom of his\ncountenance foretold anything but mirth, he burst into hard laughter.\nAndrew smote him jovially on the back.\n\n'Tickles you, eh, bo-oy? \"Peak's Refreshment an' Dinin' Rooms!\"\nEverything tip-top, mind; respectable business, Godwin; nothing for\nnobody to be ashamed of--_that_ wouldn't do, of course.'\n\nThe young man's laughter ended as abruptly as it had begun, but his\nvisage was no longer clouded with bitter misery. A strange indifference\nseemed to have come upon him, and whilst the speculative uncle talked\naway with increasing excitement, he ate and drank heedlessly.\n\n'Mother expects you to-morrow, she tells me,' said Andrew, when his\ncompanion's taciturnity had suggested a change of topic. 'Shouldn't\nwonder if you see me over at Twybridge again before long. I was to\nremember your awnt and your cousin Jowey to you. You wouldn't know\nJowey? the sharpest lad of his age as ever I knowed, is Jowey. Your\nfather 'ud a' took a delight in 'im, if 'e'd lived, that 'e would.'\n\nFor a quarter of an hour or so the dialogue was concerned with domestic\nhistory. Godwin gave brief reply to many questions, but asked none, not\neven such as civility required. The elder man, however, was unaffected\nby this reticence, and when at length his nephew pleaded an engagement\nas excuse for leave-taking he shook hands with much warmth. The two\nparted close by the shop, and Godwin, casting a glance at the now\nsilent College, walked hastily towards his lodgings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nIn the prosperous year of 1856, incomes of between a hundred and a\nhundred and fifty pounds were chargeable with a tax of elevenpence\nhalfpenny in the pound: persons who enjoyed a revenue of a hundred and\nfifty or more had the honour of paying one and fourpence. Abatements\nthere were none, and families supporting life on two pounds a week\nmight in some cases, perchance, be reconciled to the mulct by\nconsidering how equitably its incidence was graduated.\n\nSome, on the other hand, were less philosophical; for instance, the\nhousehold consisting of Nicholas Peak, his wife, their three-year-old\ndaughter, their newly-born son, and a blind sister of Nicholas,\ndependent upon him for sustenance. Mr. Peak, aged thirty and now four\nyears wedded, had a small cottage on the outskirts of Greenwich. He was\nemployed as dispenser, at a salary of thirty-five shillings a week, by\na medical man with a large practice. His income, therefore, fell\nconsiderably within the hundred pound limit; and, all things\nconsidered, it was not unreasonable that he should be allowed to expend\nthe whole of this sum on domestic necessities. But it came to pass that\nNicholas, in his greed of wealth, obtained supplementary employment,\nwhich benefited him to the extent of a yearly ten pounds. Called upon\nto render his statement to the surveyor of income-tax, he declared\nhimself in possession of a hundred and one pounds per annum;\nconsequently, he stood indebted to the Exchequer in the sum of four\npounds, sixteen shillings, and ninepence. His countenance darkened, as\nalso did that of Mrs. Peak.\n\n'This is wrong and cruel--dreadfully cruel!' cried the latter, with\ntears in her eyes.\n\n'It is; but that's no new thing,' was the bitter reply.\n\n'I think it's wrong of _you_, Nicholas. What need is there to say\nanything about that ten pounds? It's taking the food out of our mouths.'\n\nKnowing only the letter of the law, Mr. Peak answered sternly:\n\n'My income is a hundred and one pounds. I can't sign my name to a lie.'\n\nPicture the man. Tall, gaunt, with sharp intellectual features, and\neyes of singular beauty, the face of an enthusiast--under given\ncircumstances, of a hero. Poorly clad, of course, but with rigorous\nself-respect; his boots polished, _propria manu_, to the point of\nperfection; his linen washed and ironed by the indefatigable wife. Of\nsimplest tastes, of most frugal habits, a few books the only luxury\nwhich he deemed indispensable; yet a most difficult man to live with,\nfor to him applied precisely the description which Robert Burns gave of\nhis own father; he was 'of stubborn, ungainly integrity and headlong\nirascibility'.\n\nUngainly, for his strong impulses towards culture were powerless to\nobliterate the traces of his rude origin. Born in a London alley, the\nson of a labourer burdened with a large family, he had made his way by\nsheer force of character to a position which would have seemed proud\nsuccess but for the difficulty with which he kept himself alive. His\nparents were dead. Of his brothers, two had disappeared in the abyss,\nand one, Andrew, earned a hard livelihood as a journeyman baker; the\nelder of his sisters had married poorly, and the younger was his blind\npensioner. Nicholas had found a wife of better birth than his own, a\nyoung woman with country kindred in decent circumstances, though she\nherself served as nursemaid in the house of the medical man who\nemployed her future husband. He had taught himself the English\nlanguage, so far as grammar went, but could not cast off the London\naccent; Mrs. Peak was fortunate enough to speak with nothing worse than\nthe note of the Midlands.\n\nHis bent led him to the study of history, politics, economics, and in\nthat time of military outbreak he was frenzied by the conflict of his\nideals with the state of things about him. A book frequently in his\nhands was Godwin's _Political Justice_, and when a son had been born to\nhim he decided to name the child after that favourite author. In this\nway, at all events, he could find some expression for his hot defiance\nof iniquity.\n\nHe paid his income-tax, and felt a savage joy in the privation thus\nimposed upon his family. Mrs. Peak could not forgive her husband, and\nin this case, though she had but dim appreciation of the point of\nhonour involved, her censures doubtless fell on Nicholas's vulnerable\nspot; it was the perversity of arrogance, at least as much as honesty,\nthat impelled him to incur taxation. His wife's perseverance in\ncomplaint drove him to stern impatience, and for a long time the peace\nof the household suffered.\n\nWhen the boy Godwin was five years old, the death of his blind aunt\ncame as a relief to means which were in every sense overtaxed. Twelve\nmonths later, a piece of unprecedented good fortune seemed to place the\nPeaks beyond fear of want, and at the same time to supply Nicholas with\na fulfilment of hopeless desires. By the death of Mrs Peak's brother,\nthey came into possession of a freehold house and about nine hundred\npounds. The property was situated some twelve miles from the Midland\ntown of Twybridge, and thither they at once removed. At Twybridge lived\nMrs. Peak's elder sister, Miss Cadman; but between this lady and her\nnearest kinsfolk there had been but slight correspondence--the deceased\nCadman left her only a couple of hundred pounds. With capital at\ncommand, Nicholas Peak took a lease of certain fields near his house,\nand turned farmer. The study of chemistry had given a special bent to\nhis economic speculations; he fancied himself endowed with exceptional\naptitude for agriculture, and the scent of the furrow brought all his\nenergies into feverish activity--activity which soon impoverished him:\nthat was in the order of things. 'Ungainly integrity' and 'headlong\nirascibility' wrought the same results for the ex-dispenser as for the\nAyrshire husbandman. His farming came to a chaotic end; and when the\nstruggling man died, worn out at forty-three, his wife and children\n(there was now a younger boy, Oliver, named after the Protector) had no\nvery bright prospects.\n\nThings went better with them than might have been anticipated. To Mrs.\nPeak her husband's death was not an occasion of unmingled mourning. For\nthe last few years she had suffered severely from domestic discord, and\nwhen left at peace by bereavement she turned with a sense of liberation\nto the task of caring for her children's future. Godwin was just\nthirteen, Oliver was eleven; both had been well schooled, and with the\nhelp of friends they might soon be put in the way of self-support. The\ndaughter, Charlotte, sixteen years of age, had accomplishments which\nwould perhaps be profitable. The widow decided to make a home in\nTwybridge, where Miss Cadman kept a millinery shop. By means of this\nconnection, Charlotte presently found employment for her skill in fine\nneedlework. Mrs. Peak was incapable of earning money, but the\nexperiences of her early married life enabled her to make more than the\nmost of the pittance at her disposal.\n\nMiss Cadman was a woman of active mind, something of a\nbusy-body--dogmatic, punctilious in her claims to respect, proud of the\nacknowledgment by her acquaintances that she was not as other\ntradespeople; her chief weakness was a fanatical ecclesiasticism, the\ncommon blight of English womanhood. Circumstances had allowed her a\nbetter education than generally falls to women of that standing, and in\nspite of her shop she succeeded in retaining the friendship of certain\nladies long ago her schoolfellows. Among these were the Misses\nLumb--middle-aged sisters, who lived at Twybridge on a small\nindependence, their time chiefly devoted to the support of the Anglican\nChurch. An eldest Miss Lumb had been fortunate enough to marry that\ngrowing potentate of the Midlands, Mr. Job Whitelaw. Now Lady Whitelaw,\nshe dwelt at Kingsmill, but her sisters frequently enjoyed the honour\nof entertaining her, and even Miss Cadman the milliner occasionally\nheld converse with the baronet's wife. In this way it came to pass that\nthe Widow Peak and her children were brought under the notice of\npersons who sooner or later might be of assistance to them.\n\nAbounding in emphatic advice, Miss Cadman easily persuaded her sister\nthat Godwin must go to school for at least two years longer. The boys\nhad been at a boarding-school twenty miles away from their country\nhome; it would be better for them now to be put under the care of some\nTwybridge teacher--such an one as Miss Cadman's acquaintances could\nrecommend. For her own credit, the milliner was anxious that these\nnephews of hers should not be running about the town as errand-boys or\nthe like, and with prudence there was no necessity for such\ndegradation. An uncommon lad like Godwin (she imagined him named after\nthe historic earl) must not be robbed of his fair chance in life; she\nwould gladly spare a little money for his benefit; he was a boy to\nrepay such expenditure.\n\nIndeed it seemed probable. Godwin devoured books, and had a remarkable\nfaculty for gaining solid information on any subject that took his\nfancy. What might be the special bent of his mind one could not yet\ndiscover. He read poetry with precocious gusto, but at the same time\nhis aptitude for scientific pursuits was strongly marked. In botany,\nchemistry, physics, he made progress which the people about him,\nincluding his schoolmaster, were incapable of appreciating; and already\nthe collection of books left by his father, most of them out of date,\nfailed to satisfy his curiosity. It might be feared that tastes so\ndiscursive would be disadvantageous to a lad who must needs pursue some\ndefinite bread-study, and the strain of self-consciousness which grew\nstrong in him was again a matter for concern. He cared nothing for\nboyish games and companionship; in the society of strangers especially\nof females--he behaved with an excessive shyness which was easily\nmistaken for a surly temper. Reproof, correction, he could not endure,\nand it was fortunate that the decorum of his habits made remonstrance\nseldom needful.\n\nLudicrous as the project would have appeared to any unbiassed observer\nof character, Miss Cadman conceived a hope that Godwin might become a\nclergyman. From her point of view it was natural to assume that\nuncommon talents must be devoted to the service of the Church, and she\nwould have gladly done her utmost for the practical furthering of such\nan end. Mrs. Peak, though well aware that her son had imbibed the\npaternal prejudices, was disposed to entertain the same hope, despite\nsolid obstacles. For several years she had nourished a secret\nantagonism to her husband's spirit of political, social, and religious\nrebellion, and in her widowhood she speedily became a pattern of the\nconservative female. It would have gratified her to discern any\npossibility of Godwin's assuming the priestly garb. And not alone on\nthe ground of conscience. Long ago she had repented the marriage which\nconnected her with such a family as that of the Peaks, and she ardently\ndesired that the children, now exclusively her own, might enter life on\na plane superior to their father's.\n\n'Godwin, how would you like to go to College and be a clergyman?' she\nasked one Sunday afternoon, when an hour or two of congenial reading\nseemed to have put the boy into a gentle humour.\n\n'To go to College' was all very well (diplomacy had prompted this\npreface), but the words that followed fell so alarmingly on Godwin's\near that he looked up with a resentful expression, unable to reply\notherwise.\n\n'You never thought of it, I suppose?' his mother faltered; for she\noften stood in awe of her son, who, though yet but fourteen, had much\nof his father's commanding severity.\n\n'I don't want to be a parson,' came at length, bluntly.\n\n'Don't use that word, Godwin.'\n\n'Why not? It's quite a proper word. It comes from the Latin _persona_.'\n\nThe mother had enough discretion to keep silence, and Godwin, after in\nvain trying to settle to his book again, left the room with disturbed\ncountenance.\n\nHe had now been attending the day-school for about a year, and was\ndistinctly ahead of his coevals. A Christmas examination was on the\npoint of being held, and it happened that a singular test of the lad's\nmoral character coincided with the proof of his intellectual progress.\nIn a neighbouring house lived an old man named Rawmarsh, kindly but\nrather eccentric; he had once done a good business as a printer, and\nnow supported himself by such chance typographic work of a small kind\nas friends might put in his way. He conceived an affection for Godwin;\noften had the boy to talk with him of an evening. On one such occasion,\nMr. Rawmarsh opened a desk, took forth a packet of newly printed\nleaves, and with a mysterious air silently spread them before the boy's\neyes. In an instant Godwin became aware that he was looking at the\nexamination papers which a day or two hence would be set before him at\nschool; he saw and recognised a passage from the book of Virgil which\nhis class had been reading.\n\n'That is _sub rosa_, you know,' whispered the old printer, with half\naverted face.\n\nGodwin shrank away, and could not resume the conversation thus\ninterrupted. On the following day he went about with a feeling of\nguilt. He avoided the sight of Mr. Rawmarsh, for whom he had suddenly\nlost all respect, and suffered torments in the thought that he enjoyed\nan unfair advantage over his class-mates. The Latin passage happened to\nbe one which he knew thoroughly well; there was no need, even had he\ndesired, to 'look it up'; but in sitting down to the examination, he\nexperienced a sense of shame and self-rebuke. So strong were the\neffects of this, that he voluntarily omitted the answer to a certain\nimportant question which he could have 'done' better than any of the\nother boys, thus endeavouring to adjust in his conscience the terms of\ncompetition, though in fact no such sacrifice was called for. He came\nout at the head of the class, but the triumph had no savour for him,\nand for many a year he was subject to a flush of mortification whenever\nthis incident came back to his mind.\n\nMr. Rawmarsh was not the only intelligent man who took an interest in\nGodwin. In a house which the boy sometimes visited with a\nschool-fellow, lodged a notable couple named Gunnery the husband about\nseventy, the wife five years older; they lived on a pension from a\nrailway company. Mr. Gunnery was a dabbler in many sciences, but had a\nspecial enthusiasm for geology. Two cabinets of stones and fossils gave\nevidence of his zealous travels about the British isles; he had even\nwritten a little hand-book of petrology which was for sale at certain\nbooksellers' in Twybridge, and probably nowhere else. To him, about\nthis time, Godwin began to resort, always sure of a welcome; and in the\nlittle uncarpeted room where Mr. Gunnery pursued his investigations\nmany a fateful lesson was given and received. The teacher understood\nthe intelligence he had to deal with, and was delighted to convey, by\nthe mode of suggested inference, sundry results of knowledge which it\nperhaps would not have been prudent to declare in plain, popular words.\n\nTheir intercourse was not invariably placid. The geologist had an\nirritable temper, and in certain states of the atmosphere his rheumatic\ntwinges made it advisable to shun argument with him. Godwin, moreover,\nwas distinguished by an instability of mood peculiarly trying to an old\nman's testy humour. Of a sudden, to Mr Gunnery's surprise and\nannoyance, he would lose all interest in this or that science. Thus,\none day the lad declared himself unable to name two stones set before\nhim, felspar and quartz, and when his instructor broke into angry\nimpatience he turned sullenly away, exclaiming that he was tired of\ngeology.\n\n'Tired of geology?' cried Mr. Gunnery, with flaming eyes. 'Then _I_ am\ntired of _you_, Master Peak! Be off, and don't come again till I send\nfor you!'\n\nGodwin retired without a word. On the second day he was summoned back\nagain, but his resentment of the dismissal rankled in him for a long\ntime; injury to his pride was the wrong he found it hardest to forgive.\n\nHis schoolmaster, aware of the unusual pursuits which he added to the\nroutine of lessons, gave him as a prize the English translation of a\nbook by Figuier--_The World before the Deluge_. Strongly interested by\nthe illustrations of the volume (fanciful scenes from the successive\ngeologic periods), Godwin at once carried it to his scientific friend.\n'Deluge?' growled Mr. Gunnery. '_What_ deluge? _Which_ deluge?' But he\nrestrained himself, handed the book coldly back, and began to talk of\nsomething else. All this was highly significant to Godwin, who of\ncourse began the perusal of his prize in a suspicious mood. Nor was he\nlong before he sympathised with Mr Gunnery's distaste. Though too young\nto grasp the arguments at issue, his prejudices were strongly excited\nby the conventional Theism which pervades Figuier's work. Already it\nwas the habit of his mind to associate popular dogma with intellectual\nshallowness; herein, as at every other point which fell within his\nscope, he had begun to scorn average people, and to pride himself\nintensely on views which he found generally condemned. Day by day he\ngrew into a clearer understanding of the memories bequeathed to him by\nhis father; he began to interpret remarks, details of behaviour,\ninstances of wrath, which, though they had stamped themselves on his\nrecollection, conveyed at the time no precise significance. The issue\nwas that he hardened himself against the influence of his mother and\nhis aunt, regarding them as in league against the free progress of his\neducation.\n\nAs women, again, he despised these relatives. It is almost impossible\nfor a bright-witted lad born in the lower middle class to escape this\nstage of development. The brutally healthy boy contemns the female sex\nbecause he sees it incapable of his own athletic sports, but Godwin was\none of those upon whose awaking intellect is forced a perception of the\nbrain-defect so general in women when they are taught few of life's\ngraces and none of its serious concerns,--their paltry prepossessions,\ntheir vulgar sequaciousness, their invincible ignorance, their\nabsorption in a petty self. And especially is this phase of thought to\nbe expected in a boy whose heart blindly nourishes the seeds of\npoetical passion. It was Godwin's sincere belief that he held girls, as\ngirls, in abhorrence. This meant that he dreaded their personal\ncriticism, and that the spectacle of female beauty sometimes overcame\nhim with a despair which he could not analyse. Matrons and elderly\nunmarried women were truly the objects of his disdain; in them he saw\nnothing but their shortcomings. Towards his mother he was conscious of\nno tenderness; of as little towards his sister, who often censured him\nwith trenchant tongue; as for his aunt, whose admiration of him was\nmodified by reticences, he could never be at ease in her company, so\nstrong a dislike had he for her look, her voice, her ways of speech.\n\nHe would soon be fifteen years old. Mrs. Peak was growing anxious, for\nshe could no longer consent to draw upon her sister for a portion of\nthe school fees, and no pertinent suggestion for the lad's future was\nmade by any of the people who admired his cleverness. Miss Cadman still\nclung in a fitful way to the idea of making her nephew a cleric; she\nhad often talked it over with the Misses Lumb, who of course held that\n'any sacrifice' was justifiable with such a motive, and who suggested a\nhope that, by the instrumentality of Lady Whitelaw, a curacy might\neasily be obtained as soon as Godwin was old enough. But several years\nmust pass before that Levitical stage could be reached; and then, after\nall, perhaps the younger boy, Oliver, placid of temper and notably\npliant in mind, was better suited for the dignity of Orders. It was\nlamentable that Godwin should have become so intimate with that\nearth-burrowing Mr. Gunnery, who certainly never attended either church\nor chapel, and who seemed to have imbued his pupil with immoral\ntheories concerning the date of creation. Godwin held more decidedly\naloof from his aunt, and had been heard by Charlotte to speak very\ndisrespectfully of the Misses Lumb. In short, there was no choice but\nto discover an opening for him in some secular pursuit. Could he,\nperhaps, become an assistant teacher? Or must he 'go into an office'?\n\nNo common lad. A youth whose brain glowed like a furnace, whose heart\nthrobbed with tumult of high ambitions, of inchoate desires; endowed\nwith knowledge altogether exceptional for his years; a nature\nessentially militant, displaying itself in innumerable forms of callow\nintolerance--apt, assuredly, for some vigorous part in life, but as\nlikely as not to rush headlong on traverse roads if no judicious mind\nassumed control of him. What is to be done with the boy?\n\nAll very well, if the question signified, in what way to provide for\nthe healthy development of his manhood. Of course it meant nothing of\nthe sort, but merely: What work can be found for him whereby he may\nearn his daily bread? We--his kinsfolk even, not to think of the world\nat large--can have no concern with his growth as an intellectual being;\nwe are hard pressed to supply our own mouths with food; and now that we\nhave done our recognised duty by him, it is high time that he learnt to\nfight for his own share of provender. Happily, he is of the robust sex;\nhe can hit out right and left, and make standing-room. We have armed\nhim with serviceable weapons, and now he must use them against the\nenemy--that is to say, against all mankind, who will quickly enough\ndeprive him of sustenance if he fail in the conflict. We neither know,\nnor in great measure care, for what employment he is naturally marked.\nObviously he cannot heave coals or sell dogs' meat, but with negative\ncertainty not much else can be resolved, seeing how desperate is the\ncompetition for minimum salaries. He has been born, and he must eat. By\nwhat licensed channel may he procure the necessary viands?\n\nPaternal relatives Godwin had as good as none. In quitting London,\nNicholas Peak had ceased to hold communication with any of his own\nstock save the younger brother Andrew. With him he occasionally\nexchanged a letter, but Andrew's share in the correspondence was\nlimited to ungrammatical and often unintelligible hints of numerous\nprojects for money-making. Just after the removal of the bereaved\nfamily to Twybridge, they were surprised by a visit from Andrew, in\nanswer to one of whose letters Mrs. Peak had sent news of her husband's\ndeath. Though her dislike of the man amounted to loathing, the widow\ncould not refuse him hospitality; she did her best, however, to prevent\nhis coming in contact with anyone she knew. Andrew declared that he was\nat length prospering; he had started a coffee-shop at Dalston, in\nnorth-east London, and positively urged a proposal (well-meant, beyond\ndoubt) that Godwin should be allowed to come to him and learn the\nbusiness. Since then the Londoner had once again visited Twybridge,\ntowards the end of Godwin's last school-year. This time he spoke of\nhimself less hopefully, and declared a wish to transfer his business to\nsome provincial town, where he thought his metropolitan experience\nmight be of great value, in the absence of serious competition. It was\nnot difficult to discover a family likeness between Andrew's\ninstability and the idealism which had proved the ruin of Nicholas.\n\nOn this second occasion Godwin tried to escape a meeting with his\nuncle. Unable to do so, he sat mute, replying to questions\nmonosyllabically. Mrs. Peak's shame and annoyance, in face of this\nLondon-branded vulgarian, were but feeble emotions compared with those\nof her son. Godwin hated the man, and was in dread lest any\nschool-fellow should come to know of such a connection. Yet delicacy\nprevented his uttering a word on the subject to his mother. Mrs Peak's\nsilence after Andrew's departure made it uncertain how she regarded the\nobligation of kindred, and in any such matter as this the boy was far\ntoo sensitive to risk giving pain. But to his brother Oliver he spoke.\n\n'What is the brute to us? When I'm a man, let him venture to come near\nme, and see what sort of a reception he'll get! I hate low, uneducated\npeople! I hate them worse than the filthiest vermin!--don't you?'\n\nOliver, aged but thirteen, assented, as he habitually did to any\nquestion which seemed to await an affirmative.\n\n'They ought to be swept off the face of the earth!' pursued Godwin,\nsitting up in bed--for the dialogue took place about eleven o'clock at\nnight. 'All the grown-up creatures, who can't speak proper English and\ndon't know how to behave themselves, I'd transport them to the Falkland\nIslands,'--this geographic precision was a note of the boy's\nmind,--'and let them die off as soon as possible. The children should\nbe sent to school and purified, if possible; if not, they too should be\ngot rid of.'\n\n'You're an aristocrat, Godwin,' remarked Oliver, simply; for the elder\nbrother had of late been telling him fearful stories from the French\nRevolution, with something of an anti-popular bias.\n\n'I hope I am. I mean to be, that's certain. There's nothing I hate like\nvulgarity. That's why I can't stand Roper. When he beat me in\nmathematics last midsummer, I felt so ashamed I could hardly bear\nmyself. I'm working like a nigger at algebra and Euclid this half, just\nbecause I think it would almost kill me to be beaten again by a low\ncad.'\n\nThis was perhaps the first time that Godwin found expression for the\nprejudice which affected all his thoughts and feelings. It relieved him\nto have spoken thus; henceforth he had become clear as to his point of\nview. By dubbing him aristocrat, Oliver had flattered him in the\nsubtlest way. If indeed the title were justly his, as he instantly felt\nit was, the inference was plain that he must be an aristocrat of\nnature's own making--one of the few highly favoured beings who, in\ndespite of circumstance, are pinnacled above mankind. In his ignorance\nof life, the boy visioned a triumphant career; an aristocrat _de jure_\nmight possibly become one even in the common sense did he but pursue\nthat end with sufficient zeal. And in his power of persistent endeavour\nhe had no lack of faith.\n\nThe next day he walked with exalted head. Encountering the\nobjectionable Roper, he smiled upon him contemptuously tolerant.\n\nThere being no hope of effective assistance from relatives, Mrs. Peak\nturned for counsel to a man of business, with whom her husband had made\nacquaintance in his farming days, and who held a position of influence\nat Twybridge. This was Mr. Moxey, manufacturing chemist, famous in the\nMidlands for his 'sheep and cattle dressings', and sundry other\nproducts of agricultural enterprise. His ill-scented, but lucrative,\nworks were situated a mile out of the town; and within sight of the\nreeking chimneys stood a large, plain house, uncomfortably like an\n'institution' of some kind, in which he dwelt with his five daughters.\nThither, one evening, Mrs. Peak betook herself, having learnt that Mr.\nMoxey dined at five o'clock, and that he was generally to be found\ndigging in his garden until sunset. Her reception was civil. The\nmanufacturer--sparing of words, but with no unkindly face--requested\nthat Godwin should be sent to see him, and promised to do his best to\nbe of use. A talk with the boy strengthened his interest. He was\nsurprised at Godwin's knowledge of chemistry, pleased with his general\nintelligence, and in the end offered to make a place for him at the\nworks, where, though for a year or two his earnings must be small, he\nwould gain experience likely to be of substantial use to him. Godwin\ndid not find the proposal distasteful; it brought a change into his\nlife, and the excitement of novelty; it flattered him with the show of\nrelease from pupilage. To Mr. Moxey's he went.\n\nThe hours were not long, and it was understood that his theoretical\nstudies should continue in the evening. Godwin's home was a very small\nhouse in a monotonous little street; a garret served as bedroom for the\ntwo boys, also as the elder one's laboratory. Servant Mrs. Peak had\nnone. She managed everything herself, as in the old Greenwich days,\nleaving Charlotte free to work at her embroidery. Godwin took turns\nwith Oliver at blacking the shoes.\n\nAs a matter of course the boys accompanied their mother each Sunday\nmorning to the parish church, and this ceremony was becoming an\ninsufferable tax on Godwin's patience. It was not only that he hated\nthe name of religion, and scorned with much fierceness all who came in\nsympathetic contact therewith; the loss of time seemed to him an\noppressive injury, especially now that he began to suffer from\nrestricted leisure. He would not refuse to obey his mother's wish, but\nthe sullenness of his Sabbatic demeanour made the whole family\nuncomfortable. As often as possible he feigned illness. He tried the\neffect of dolorous sighs and groans; but Mrs. Peak could not dream of\nconceding a point which would have seemed to her the condonation of\ndeadly sin. 'When I am a man!' muttered Godwin. 'Ah! when I am a man!'\n\nA year had gone by, and the routine to which he was bound began to have\na servile flavour. His mind chafed at subjugation to commercial\ninterests. Sick of 'sheep and cattle dressings', he grew tired of\nchemistry altogether, and presently of physical science in general. His\nevenings were given to poetry and history; he took up the classical\nschoolbooks again, and found a charm in Latin syntax hitherto\nunperceived. It was plain to him now how he had been wronged by the\nnecessity of leaving school when his education had but just begun.\n\nDiscontent becoming ripe for utterance, he unbosomed himself to Mr\nGunnery. It happened that the old man had just returned from a visit to\nKingsmill, where he had spent a week in the museum, then newly enriched\nwith geologic specimens. After listening in silence to the boy's\ncomplaints, and pondering for a long time, he began to talk of Whitelaw\nCollege.\n\n'Does it cost much to study there?' Godwin asked, gloomily.\n\n'No great sum, I think. There are scholarships to be had.'\n\nMr. Gunnery threw out the suggestion carelessly. Knowing the hazards of\nlife, he could not quite justify himself in encouraging Godwin's\nrestiveness.\n\n'Scholarships? For free study?'\n\n'Yes; but that wouldn't mean free living, you know. Students don't live\nat the College.'\n\n'How do you go in for a scholarship?'\n\nThe old man replied, meditatively, 'If you were to pass the Cambridge\nLocal Examination, and to get the first place in the Kingsmill\ndistrict, you would have three years of free study at Whitelaw.'\n\n'Three years?' shouted Godwin, springing up from his chair.\n\n'But how could you live, my boy?'\n\nGodwin sat down again, and let his head fall forward.\n\nHow to keep oneself alive during a few years of intellectual growth?--a\nquestion often asked by men of mature age, but seldom by a lad of\nsixteen. No matter. He resolved that he would study for this Cambridge\nLocal Examination, and have a try for the scholarship. His attainments\nwere already up to the standard required for average success in such\ncompetitions. On obtaining a set of 'papers', he found that they looked\neasy enough. Could he not come out first in the Kingsmill district?\n\nHe worked vigorously at special subjects; aid was needless, but he\nwished for more leisure. Not a word to any member of his household.\nWhen his mother discovered that he was reading in the bedroom till long\npast midnight, she made serious objection on the score of health and on\nthat of gas bills. Godwin quietly asserted that work he must, and that\nif necessary he would buy candles out of his pocket-money. He had\nunexpectedly become more grave, more restrained; he even ceased to\ngrumble about going to church, having found that service time could be\nutilised for committing to memory lists of dates and the like, jotted\ndown on a slip of paper. When the time for the examination drew near,\nhe at length told his mother to what end he had been labouring, and\nasked her to grant him the assistance necessary for his journey and the\nsojourn at Kingsmill; the small sum he had been able to save, after\npurchase of books, would not suffice. Mrs. Peak knew not whether to\napprove her son's ambition or to try to repress it. She would welcome\nan improval in his prospects, but, granting success, how was he to live\nwhilst profiting by a scholarship? And again, what did he propose to\nmake of himself when he had spent three years in study?\n\n'In any case,' was Godwin's reply, 'I should be sure of a good place as\na teacher. But I think I might try for something in the Civil Service;\nthere are all sorts of positions to be got.'\n\nIt was idle to discuss the future whilst the first step was still\nspeculative. Mrs. Peak consented to favour the attempt, and what was\nmore, to keep it a secret until the issue should be known. It was\nneedful to obtain leave of absence from Mr. Moxey, and Godwin, when\nmaking the request, stated for what purpose he was going to Kingsmill,\nthough without explaining the hope which had encouraged his studies.\nThe project seemed laudable, and his employer made no difficulties.\n\nGodwin just missed the scholarship; of candidates in the prescribed\ndistrict, he came out second.\n\nGrievous was the disappointment. To come so near success exasperated\nhis impatient temper, and for a few days his bondage at the chemical\nworks seemed intolerable; he was ready for almost any venture that\npromised release and new scope for his fretting energies. But at the\nmoment when nervous irritation was most acute, a remarkable act of\nkindness suddenly restored to him all the hopes he had abandoned. One\nSaturday afternoon he was summoned from his surly retreat in the\ngarret, to speak with a visitor. On entering the sitting-room, he found\nhis mother in company with Miss Cadman and the Misses Lumb, and from\nthe last-mentioned ladies, who spoke with amiable alternation, he\nlearnt that they were commissioned by Sir Job Whitelaw to offer for his\nacceptance a three-years' studentship at Whitelaw College. Affected by\nher son's chagrin, Mrs. Peak had disclosed the story to her sister, who\nhad repeated it to the Misses Lumb, who in turn had made it the subject\nof a letter to Lady Whitelaw. It was an annual practice with Sir Job to\ndiscover some promising lad whom he could benefit by the payment of his\nfees for a longer or shorter period of college study. The hint from\nTwybridge came to him just at the suitable time, and, on further\ninquiry, he decided to make proffer of this advantage to Godwin Peak.\nThe only condition was that arrangements should be made by the\nstudent's relatives for his support during the proposed period.\n\nThis generosity took away Godwin's breath. The expenditure it\nrepresented was trifling, but from a stranger in Sir Job's position it\nhad something which recalled to so fervent a mind the poetry of\nMedicean patronage. For the moment no faintest doubt gave warning to\nhis self-respect; he was eager to accept nobly a benefaction nobly\nintended.\n\nMiss Cadman, flattered by Sir Job's attention to her nephew, now came\nforward with an offer to contribute towards Godwin's livelihood. Her\nsupplement would eke into adequacy such slender allowance as the\nwidow's purse could afford. Details were privately discussed, resolves\nwere taken. Mr. Moxey, when it was made known to him, without\nexplanation, that Godwin was to be sent to Whitelaw College, behaved\nwith kindness; he at once released the lad, and added a present to the\nsalary that was due. Proper acknowledgment of the Baronet's kindness\nwas made by the beneficiary himself, who wrote a letter giving truer\ntestimony of his mental calibre than would have been offered had he\nexpressed himself by word of mouth. A genial reply summoned him to an\ninterview as soon as he should have found an abode in Kingsmill. The\nlodging he had occupied during the examination was permanently secured,\nand a new period of Godwin's life began.\n\nFor two years, that is to say until his age drew towards nineteen, Peak\npursued the Arts curriculum at Whitelaw. His mood on entering decided\nhis choice, which was left free to him. Experience of utilitarian\nchemistry had for the present made his liberal tastes predominant, and\nneither the splendid laboratories of Whitelaw nor the repute of its\nscientific Professors tempted him to what had once seemed his natural\ndirection. In the second year, however, he enlarged his course by the\naddition of one or two classes not included in Sir Job's design; these\nwere paid for out of a present made to him by Mr. Gunnery.\n\nIt being customary for the regular students of Whitelaw to graduate at\nLondon University, Peak passed his matriculation, and worked on for the\npreliminary test then known as First B.A. In the meanwhile he rose\nsteadily, achieving distinction in the College. The more observant of\nhis teachers remarked him even where he fell short of academic triumph,\nand among his fellow-students he had the name of a stern 'sweater', one\nnot easily beaten where he had set his mind on excelling. He was not\ngenerally liked, for his mood appeared unsocial, and a repelling\narrogance was sometimes felt in his talk. No doubt--said the more\nfortunate young men--he came from a very poor home, and suffered from\nthe narrowness of his means. They noticed that he did not subscribe to\nthe College Union, and that he could never join in talk regarding the\ndiversions of the town. His two or three intimates were chosen from\namong those contemporaries who read hard and dressed poorly.\n\nThe details of Godwin's private life were noteworthy. Accustomed\nhitherto to a domestic circle, at Kingsmill he found himself isolated,\nand it was not easy for him to surrender all at once the comforts of\nhome. For a time he felt as though his ambition were a delinquency\nwhich entailed the punishment of loneliness. Nor did his relations with\nSir Job Whitelaw tend to mitigate this feeling. In his first interview\nwith the Baronet, Godwin showed to little advantage. A deadly\nbashfulness forbade him to be natural either in attitude or speech. He\nfelt his dependence in a way he had not foreseen; the very clothes he\nwore, then fresh from the tailor's, seemed to be the gift of charity,\nand their stiffness shamed him. A man of the world, Sir Job could make\nallowance for these defects. He understood that the truest kindness\nwould be to leave a youth such as this to the forming influences of the\nCollege. So Godwin barely had a glimpse of Lady Whitelaw in her\nhusband's study, and thereafter for many months he saw nothing of his\nbenefactors. Subsequently he was twice invited to interviews with Sir\nJob, who talked with kindness and commendation. Then came the Baronet's\ndeath. Godwin received an assurance that this event would be no check\nupon his career, but he neither saw nor heard directly from Lady\nWhitelaw.\n\nNot a house in Kingsmill opened hospitable doors to the lonely student;\nnor was anyone to blame for this. With no family had he friendly\nacquaintance. When, towards the end of his second year, he grew\nsufficiently intimate with Buckland Warricombe to walk out with him to\nThornhaw, it could be nothing more than a scarcely welcome exception to\nthe rule of solitude. Impossible for him to cultivate the friendship of\nsuch people as the Warricombes, with their large and joyous scheme of\nlife. Only at a hearth where homeliness and cordiality united to unthaw\nhis proud reserve could Godwin perchance have found the companionship\nhe needed. Many such homes existed in Kingsmill, but no kindly fortune\nled the young man within the sphere of their warmth.\n\nHis lodgings were in a very ugly street in the ugliest outskirts of the\ntown; he had to take a long walk through desolate districts\n(brick-yard, sordid pasture, degenerate village) before he could\nrefresh his eyes with the rural scenery which was so great a joy to him\nas almost to be a necessity. The immediate vicinage offered nothing but\nmonotone of grimy, lower middle-class dwellings, occasionally relieved\nby a public-house. He occupied two rooms, not unreasonably clean, and\nwas seldom disturbed by the attentions of his landlady.\n\nAn impartial observer might have wondered at the negligence which left\nhim to arrange his life as best he could, notwithstanding youth and\nutter inexperience. It looked indeed as if there were no one in the\nworld who cared what became of him. Yet this was merely the result of\nhis mother's circumstances, and of his own character. Mrs Peak could do\nno more than make her small remittances, and therewith send an\noccasional admonition regarding his health. She did not, in fact,\nconceive the state of things, imagining that the authority and\nsupervisal of the College extended over her son's daily existence,\nwhereas it was possible for Godwin to frequent lectures or not, to\nstudy or to waste his time, pretty much as he chose, subject only to\nofficial inquiry if his attendance became frequently irregular. His\nindependent temper, and the seeming maturity of his mind, supplied\nanother excuse for the imprudent confidence which left him to his own\nresources. Yet the perils of the situation were great indeed. A youth\nof less concentrated purpose, more at the mercy of casual allurement,\nwould probably have gone to wreck amid trials so exceptional.\n\nTrials not only of his moral nature. The sums of money with which he\nwas furnished fell short of a reasonable total for bare necessities. In\nthe calculation made by Mrs. Peak and her sister, outlay on books had\npractically been lost sight of; it was presumed that ten shillings a\nterm would cover this item. But Godwin could not consent to be at a\ndisadvantage in his armoury for academic contest. The first month saw\nhim compelled to contract his diet, that he might purchase books;\nthenceforth he rarely had enough to eat. His landlady supplied him with\nbreakfast, tea, and supper--each repast of the very simplest kind; for\ndinner it was understood that he repaired to some public table, where\nmeat and vegetables, with perchance a supplementary sweet when nature\ndemanded it, might be had for about a shilling. That shilling was not\noften at his disposal. Dinner as it is understood by the comfortably\nclad, the 'regular meal' which is a part of English respectability,\ncame to be represented by a small pork-pie, or even a couple of buns,\neaten at the little shop over against the College. After a long morning\nof mental application this was poor refreshment; the long afternoon\nwhich followed, again spent in rigorous study, could not but reduce a\ngrowing frame to ravenous hunger. Tea and buttered bread were the means\nof appeasing it, until another four hours' work called for reward in\nthe shape of bread and cheese. Even yet the day's toil was not ended.\nGodwin sometimes read long after midnight, with the result that, when\nat length he tried to sleep, exhaustion of mind and body kept him for a\nlong time feverishly wakeful.\n\nThese hardships he concealed from the people at Twybridge. Complaint,\nit seemed to him, would be ungrateful, for sacrifices were already made\non his behalf. His father, as he well remembered, was wont to relate,\nwith a kind of angry satisfaction, the miseries through which he had\nfought his way to education and the income-tax. Old enough now to\nreflect with compassionate understanding upon that life of conflict,\nGodwin resolved that he too would bear the burdens inseparable from\npoverty, and in some moods was even glad to suffer as his father had\ndone. Fortunately he had a sound basis of health, and hunger and vigils\nwould not easily affect his constitution. If, thus hampered, he could\noutstrip competitors who had every advantage of circumstance, the more\nglorious his triumph.\n\nSunday was an interval of leisure. Rejoicing in deliverance from\nSabbatarianism, he generally spent the morning in a long walk, and the\nrest of the day was devoted to non-collegiate reading. He had\nsubscribed to a circulating library, and thus obtained new publications\nrecommended to him in the literary paper which again taxed his stomach.\nMere class-work did not satisfy him. He was possessed with throes of\nspiritual desire, impelling him towards that world of unfettered\nspeculation which he had long indistinctly imagined. It was a great\nthing to learn what the past could teach, to set himself on the common\nlevel of intellectual men; but he understood that college learning\ncould not be an end in itself, that the Professors to whom he listened\neither did not speak out all that was in their minds, or, if they did,\nwere far from representing the advanced guard of modern thought. With\neagerness he at length betook himself to the teachers of philosophy and\nof geology. Having paid for these lectures out of his own pocket, he\nfelt as if he had won a privilege beyond the conventional course of\nstudy, an initiation to a higher sphere of intellect. The result was\ndisillusion. Not even in these class-rooms could he hear the word for\nwhich he waited, the bold annunciation of newly discovered law, the\nscience which had completely broken with tradition. He came away\nunsatisfied, and brooded upon the possibilities which would open for\nhim when he was no longer dependent.\n\nHis evening work at home was subject to a disturbance which would have\nled him to seek other lodgings, could he have hoped to find any so\ncheap as these. The landlady's son, a lank youth of the clerk species,\nwas wont to amuse himself from eight to ten with practice on a piano.\nBy dint of perseverance he had learned to strum two or three hymnal\nmelodies popularised by American evangelists; occasionally he even\nadded the charm of his voice, which had a pietistic nasality not easily\nendured by an ear of any refinement. Not only was Godwin harassed by\nthe recurrence of these performances; the tunes worked themselves into\nhis brain, and sometimes throughout a whole day their burden clanged\nand squalled incessantly on his mental hearing. He longed to entreat\nforbearance from the musician, but an excess of delicacy--which always\nruled his behaviour--kept him silent. Certain passages in the classics,\nand many an elaborate mathematical formula, long retained for him an\nassociation with the cadences of revivalist hymnody.\n\nLike all proud natures condemned to solitude, he tried to convince\nhimself that he had no need of society, that he despised its\nattractions, and could be self-sufficing. So far was this from the\ntruth that he often regarded with bitter envy those of his\nfellow-students who had the social air, who conversed freely among\ntheir equals, and showed that the pursuits of the College were only a\npart of their existence. These young men were either preparing for the\nUniversity, or would pass from Whitelaw to business, profession,\nofficial training; in any case, a track was marked out for them by the\nzealous care of relatives and friends, and their efforts would always\nbe aided, applauded, by a kindly circle. Some of them Godwin could not\nbut admire, so healthful were they, so bright of intellect, and\ncourteous in manner,--a type distinct from any he had formerly\nobserved. Others were antipathetic to him. Their aggressive gentility\nconflicted with the wariness of his self-esteem; such a one, for\ninstance, as Bruno Chilvers, the sound of whose mincing voice, as he\nread in the class, so irritated him that at times he had to cover his\nears. Yet, did it chance that one of these offensive youths addressed a\ncivil word to him, on the instant his prejudice was disarmed, and his\nemotions flowed forth in a response to which he would gladly have given\nfree expression. When he was invited to meet the relatives of Buckland\nWarricombe, shyness prepossessed him against them; but the frank\nkindness of his reception moved him, and on going away he was ashamed\nto have replied so boorishly to attentions so amiably meant. The same\nnote of character sounded in what personal intercourse he had with the\nProfessors. Though his spirit of criticism was at times busy with these\ngentlemen, he had for most of them a profound regard; and to be elected\nby one or other for a word of commendation, a little private\nassistance, a well-phrased inquiry as to his progress, always made his\nheart beat high with gratitude. They were his first exemplars of\nfinished courtesy, of delicate culture; and he could never sufficiently\nregret that no one of them was aware how thankfully he recognised his\ndebt.\n\nIn longing for the intimacy of refined people, he began to modify his\nsentiments with regard to the female sex. His first prize-day at\nWhitelaw was the first occasion on which he sat in an assembly where\nladies (as he understood the title) could be seen and heard. The\nimpression he received was deep and lasting. On the seat behind him\nwere two girls whose intermittent talk held him with irresistible charm\nthroughout the whole ceremony. He had not imagined that girls could\ndisplay such intelligence, and the sweet clearness of their intonation,\nthe purity of their accent, the grace of their habitual phrases, were\nthings altogether beyond his experience. This was not the English he\nhad been wont to hear on female lips. His mother and his aunt spoke\nwith propriety; their associates were soft-tongued; but here was\nsomething quite different from inoffensiveness of tone and diction.\nGodwin appreciated the differentiating cause. These young ladies behind\nhim had been trained from the cradle to speak for the delight of\nfastidious ears; that they should be grammatical was not enough--they\nmust excel in the art of conversational music. Of course there existed\na world where only such speech was interchanged, and how inestimably\nhappy those men to whom the sphere was native!\n\nWhen the proceedings were over, he drew aside and watched the two girls\nas they mingled with acquaintances; he kept them in view until they\nleft the College. An emotion such as this he had never known; for the\nfirst time in his life he was humiliated without embitterment.\n\nThe bitterness came when he had returned to his home in the back street\nof Twybridge, and was endeavouring to spend the holidays in a hard\n'grind'. He loathed the penurious simplicity to which his life was\ncondemned; all familiar circumstances were become petty, coarse,\nvulgar, in his eyes; the contrast with the idealised world of his\nambition plunged him into despair: Even Mr. Gunnery seemed an ignoble\nfigure when compared with the Professors of Whitelaw, and his authority\nin the sciences was now subjected to doubt. However much or little\nmight result from the three years at College, it was clear to Godwin\nthat his former existence had passed into infinite remoteness; he was\nno longer fit for Twybridge, no longer a companion for his kindred.\nOliver, whose dulness as a schoolboy gave no promise of future\nachievements, was now learning the business of a seedsman; his brother\nfelt ashamed when he saw him at work in the shop, and had small\npatience with the comrades to whom Oliver dedicated his leisure.\nCharlotte was estranged by religious differences. Only for his mother\ndid the young man show increased consideration. To his aunt he\nendeavoured to be grateful, but his behaviour in her presence was\nelaborate hypocrisy. Hating the necessity for this, he laid the blame\non fortune, which had decreed his birth in a social sphere where he\nmust ever be an alien.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWith the growth of his militant egoism, there had developed in Godwin\nPeak an excess of nervous sensibility which threatened to deprive his\ncharacter of the initiative rightly belonging to it. Self-assertion is\nthe practical complement of self-esteem. To be largely endowed with the\nlatter quality, yet constrained by a coward delicacy to repress it, is\nto suffer martyrdom at the pleasure of every robust assailant, and in\nthe end be driven to the refuge of a moody solitude. That encounter\nwith his objectionable uncle after the prize distribution at Whitelaw\nshowed how much Godwin had lost of the natural vigour which declared\nitself at Andrew Peak's second visit to Twybridge, when the boy\ncertainly would not have endured his uncle's presence but for\nhospitable considerations and the respect due to his mother. The\ndecision with which he then unbosomed himself to Oliver, still\ncharacterised his thoughts, but he had not courage to elude the\ndialogue forced upon him, still less to make known his resentment of\nthe man's offensive vulgarity. He endured in silence, his heart afire\nwith scornful wrath.\n\nThe affliction could not have befallen him at a time when he was less\ncapable of supporting it resignedly. Notwithstanding his noteworthy\nsuccess in two classes, it seemed to him that he had lost\neverything--that the day was one of signal and disgraceful defeat. In\nany case that sequence of second prizes must have filled him with\nchagrin, but to be beaten thus repeatedly by such a fellow as Bruno\nChilvers was humiliation intolerable. A fopling, a mincer of effeminate\nEnglish, a rote-repeater of academic catchwords--bah! The\nby-examinations of the year had whispered presage, but Peak always felt\nthat he was not putting forth his strength; when the serious trial came\nhe would show what was really in him. Too late he recognised his error,\nthough he tried not to admit it. The extra subjects had exacted too\nmuch of him; there was a limit to his powers. Within the College this\nwould be well enough understood, but to explain a disagreeable fact is\nnot to change it; his name was written in pitiful subordination. And as\nfor the public assembly--he would have sacrificed some years of his\nlife to have stepped forward in facile supremacy, beneath the eyes of\nthose clustered ladies. Instead of that, they had looked upon his\nshame; they had interchanged glances of amusement at each repetition of\nhis defeat; had murmured comments in their melodious speech; had ended\nby losing all interest in him--as intuition apprised him was the wont\nof women.\n\nAs soon as he had escaped from his uncle, he relapsed into musing upon\nthe position to which he was condemned when the new session came round.\nAgain Chilvers would be in the same classes with him, and, as likely as\nnot, with the same result. In the meantime, they were both 'going in'\nfor the First B.A.; he had no fear of failure, but it might easily\nhappen that Chilvers would achieve higher distinction. With an eye to\nawards that might be won--substantial cash-annuities--he was reading\nfor Honours; but it seemed doubtful whether he could present himself,\nas the second examination was held only in London. Chilvers would of\ncourse be an Honours candidate. He would smile--confound him!--at an\nobjection on the score of the necessary journey to London. Better to\nrefrain altogether than again to see Chilvers come out ahead. General\nsurprise would naturally be excited, questions asked on all hands. How\nwould it sound: 'I simply couldn't afford to go up'--?\n\nAt this point of the meditation he had reached his lodgings; he\nadmitted himself with a latch-key, turned into his murky sitting-room,\nand sat down.\n\nThe table was laid for tea, as usual. Though he might have gone to\nTwybridge this evening, he had preferred to stay overnight, for an odd\nreason. At a theatre in Kingsmill a London company, headed by an\nactress of some distinction, was to perform _Romeo and Juliet_, and he\npurposed granting himself this indulgence before leaving the town. The\nplan was made when his eye fell upon the advertisement, a few days ago.\nHe then believed it probable that an evening at the theatre would\nappropriately follow upon a day of victory. His interest in the\nperformance had collapsed, but he did not care to alter his\narrangements.\n\nThe landlady came in bearing the tea-pot. He wanted nothing, yet could\nnot exert himself to say so.\n\nBut he was losing sight of a menace more formidable than defeat by\nChilvers. What was it his blackguard uncle had said? Had the fellow\nreally threatened to start an eating-house opposite the College, and\nflare his name upon a placard? 'Peak's Dining and Refreshment\nRooms'--merciful heavens!\n\nAgain the mood of laughter came upon him. Why, here was a solution of\nall difficulties, as simple as unanticipated. If indeed that awful\nthing came to pass, farewell to Whitelaw! What possibility of pursuing\nhis studies when every class-companion, every Professor,--nay, the very\nporters,--had become aware that he was nephew to the man who supplied\nmeals over the way? Moral philosophy had no prophylactic against an\nordeal such as this. Could the most insignificant lad attending\nlectures afford to disregard such an occasion of ridicule and contempt?\n\nBut the scheme would not be realised; it sounded too unlikely. Andrew\nPeak was merely a loose-minded vagabond, who might talk of this and\nthat project for making money, but would certainly never quit his dirty\nhaunts in London. Godwin asked himself angrily why he had submitted to\nthe fellow's companionship. This absurd delicacy must be corrected\nbefore it became his tyrant. The idea of scrupling to hurt the\nsensibilities of Andrew Peak! The man was coarse-hided enough to\nundergo kicking, and then take sixpence in compensation,--not a doubt\nof it. This detestable tie of kindred must no longer be recognised. He\nwould speak gravely to his mother about it. If Andrew again presented\nhimself at the house he should be given plainly to understand that his\nvisits were something less than welcome,--if necessary, a downright\nblunt word must effect their liberation. Godwin felt strong enough for\nthat, musing here alone. And, student-like, he passed on to debate the\ntheory of the problem. Andrew was his father's brother, but what is a\nmere tie of blood if nature has alienated two persons by a subtler\ndistinction? By the dead man, Andrew had never been loved or esteemed;\nmemory supplied proof of this. The widow shrank from him. No obligation\nof any kind lay upon them to tolerate the London ruffian.--Enough; he\nshould be got rid of!\n\nAlternating his causes of misery, which--he could not quite\nforget--might blend for the sudden transformation of his life, Godwin\nlet the tea grow cold upon the table, until it was time, if he still\nmeant to visit the theatre, for setting forth. He had no mind to go,\nbut as little to sit here and indulge harassing reflection. With an\neffort, he made ready and left the house.\n\nThe cost of his seat at the theatre was two shillings. So nicely had he\nadjusted the expenses of these last days that, after paying the\nlandlady's bill to-morrow morning, there would remain to him but a few\npence more than the money needed for his journey home. Walking into the\ntown, he debated with himself whether it were not better to save this\nflorin. But as he approached the pit door, the spirit of pleasure\nrevived in him; he had seen but one of Shakespeare's plays, and he\nbelieved (naturally at his age) that to see a drama acted was necessary\nfor its full appreciation. Sidling with affected indifference, he added\nhimself to the crowd.\n\nTo stand thus, expectant of the opening doors, troubled him with a\nsense of shame. To be sure, he was in the spiritual company of Charles\nLamb, and of many another man of brains who has waited under the lamp.\nBut contact with the pittites of Kingsmill offended his instincts; he\nresented this appearance of inferiority to people who came at their\nleisure, and took seats in the better parts of the house. When a\nneighbour addressed him with a meaningless joke which defied grammar,\nhe tried to grin a friendly answer, but inwardly shrank. The events of\nthe day had increased his sensibility to such impressions. Had he\ntriumphed over Bruno Chilvers, he could have behaved this evening with\na larger humanity.\n\nThe fight for entrance--honest British stupidity, crushing ribs and\nrending garments in preference to seemly order of progress--enlivened\nhim somewhat, and sent him laughing to his conquered place; but before\nthe curtain rose he was again depressed by the sight of a familiar\nfigure in the stalls, a fellow-student who sat there with mother and\nsister, black-uniformed, looking very much a gentleman. 'I, of course,\nam not a gentleman,' he said to himself, gloomily. Was there any chance\nthat he might some day take his ease in that orthodox fashion? Inasmuch\nas it was conventionality, he scorned it; but the privileges which it\nrepresented had strong control of his imagination. That lady and her\ndaughter would follow the play with intelligence. To exchange comments\nwith them would be a keen delight. As for him--he had a shop-boy on one\nhand and a grocer's wife on the other.\n\nBy the end he had fallen into fatigue. Amid clamour of easily-won\napplause he made his way into the street, to find himself in a heavy\ndownpour of rain. Having no umbrella, he looked about for a sheltered\nstation, and the glare of a neighbouring public-house caught his eye;\nhe was thirsty, and might as well refresh body and spirit with a glass\nof beer, an unwonted indulgence which had the pleasant semblance of\ndissipation. Arrived at the bar he came upon two acquaintances, who, to\njudge by their flushed cheeks and excited voices, had been celebrating\njovially the close of their academic labours. They hailed him.\n\n'Hollo, Peak! Come and help us to get sober before bedtime!'\n\nThey were not exactly studious youths, but neither did they belong to\nthe class that Godwin despised, and he had a comrade-like feeling for\nthem. In a few minutes his demeanour was wholly changed. A glass of hot\nwhisky acted promptly upon his nervous system, enabled him to forget\nvexations, and attuned him to kindred sprightliness. He entered merrily\ninto the talk of a time of life which is independent of morality--talk\ndistinct from that of the blackguard, but equally so from that of the\nreflective man. His first glass had several successors. The trio\nrambled arm in arm from one place of refreshment to another, and\npresently sat down in hearty fellowship to a supper of such viands as\nrecommend themselves at bibulous midnight. Peak was drawing recklessly\nupon the few coins that remained to him; he must leave his landlady's\nclaim undischarged, and send the money from home. Prudence be hanged!\nIf one cannot taste amusement once in a twelvemonth, why live at all?\n\nHe reached his lodgings, at something after one o'clock, drenched with\nrain, gloriously indifferent to that and all other chances of life.\nPooh! his system had been radically wrong. He should have allowed\nhimself recreation once a week or so; he would have been all the better\nfor it, body and mind. Books and that kind of thing are all very well\nin their way, but one must live; he had wasted too much of his youth in\nsolitude. _O mihi proeteritos referat si Jupiter annos!_ Next session\nhe would arrange things better. Success in examinations--what trivial\nfuss when one looked at it from the right point of view! And he had\nfretted himself into misery, because Chilvers had got more\n'marks',--ha, ha, ha!\n\nThe morrow's waking was lugubrious enough. Headache and nausea weighed\nupon him. Worse still, a scrutiny of his pockets showed that he had\nonly the shamefaced change of half-a-crown wherewith to transport\nhimself and his belongings to Twybridge. Now, the railway fare alone\nwas three shillings; the needful cab demanded eighteenpence. O idiot!\n\nAnd he hated the thought of leaving his bill unpaid; the more so\nbecause it was a trifling sum, a week's settlement. To put himself\nunder however brief an obligation to a woman such as the landlady\ngnawed at his pride. Not that only. He had no business to make a demand\nupon his mother for this additional sum. But there was no way of\nraising the money; no one of whom he could borrow it; nothing he could\nafford to sell--even if courage had supported him through such a\ntransaction. Triple idiot!\n\nBread turned to bran upon his hot palate; he could only swallow cups of\ncoffee. With trembling hands he finished the packing of his box and\nportmanteau, then braced himself to the dreaded interview. Of course,\nit involved no difficulty, the words once uttered; but, when he was\nleft alone again, he paced the room for a few minutes in flush of\nmortification. It had made his headache worse.\n\nThe mode of his homeward journey he had easily arranged. His baggage\nhaving been labelled for Twybridge, he himself would book as far as his\nmoney allowed, then proceed on foot for the remaining distance. With\nthe elevenpence now in his pocket he could purchase a ticket to a\nlittle town called Dent, and by a calculation from the railway tariff\nhe concluded that from Dent to Twybridge was some five-and-twenty\nmiles. Well and good. At the rate of four miles an hour it would take\nhim from half-past eleven to about six o'clock. He could certainly\nreach home in time for supper.\n\nAt Dent station, ashamed to ask (like a tramp) the way to so remote a\nplace as Twybridge, he jotted down a list of intervening railway\nstoppages, and thus was enabled to support the semblance of one who\nstrolls on for his pleasure. A small handbag he was obliged to carry,\nand the clouded sky made his umbrella a requisite. On he trudged\nsteadily, for the most part by muddy ways, now through a pleasant\nvillage, now in rural solitude. He had had the precaution, at breakfast\ntime, to store some pieces of bread in his pocket, and after two or\nthree hours this resource was welcome. Happily the air and exercise\nhelped him to get rid of his headache. A burst of sunshine in the\nafternoon would have made him reasonably cheerful, but for the wretched\nmeditations surviving from yesterday.\n\nHe pondered frequently on his spasmodic debauch, repeating, as well as\nmemory permitted, all his absurdities of speech and action. Defiant\nself-justification was now far to seek. On the other hand, he perceived\nvery clearly how easy it would be for him to lapse by degrees of\nweakened will into a ruinous dissoluteness. Anything of that kind would\nmean, of course, the abandonment of his ambitions. All he had to fight\nthe world with was his brain; and only by incessant strenuousness in\nits exercise had he achieved the moderate prominence declared in\nyesterday's ceremony. By birth, by station, he was of no account; if he\nchose to sink, no influential voice would deplore his falling off or\nremind him of what he owed to himself. Chilvers, now--what a\nwide-spreading outcry, what calling upon gods and men, would be excited\nby any defection of that brilliant youth! Godwin Peak must make his own\ncareer, and that he would hardly do save by efforts greater than the\nordinary man can put forth. The ordinary man?--Was he in any respect\nextraordinary? were his powers noteworthy? It was the first time that\nhe had deliberately posed this question to himself, and for answer came\na rush of confident blood, pulsing through all the mechanism of his\nbeing.\n\nThe train of thought which occupied him during this long trudge was to\nremain fixed in his memory; in any survey of the years of pupilage this\nrecollection would stand prominently forth, associated, moreover, with\none slight incident which at the time seemed a mere interruption of his\nmusing. From a point on the high-road he observed a small quarry, so\nexcavated as to present an interesting section; though weary, he could\nnot but turn aside to examine these strata. He knew enough of the\ngeology of the county to recognise the rocks and reflect with\nunderstanding upon their position; a fragment in his hand, he sat down\nto rest for a moment. Then a strange fit of brooding came over him.\nEscaping from the influences of personality, his imagination wrought\nback through eras of geologic time, held him in a vision of the\ninfinitely remote, shrivelled into insignificance all but the one fact\nof inconceivable duration. Often as he had lost himself in such\nreveries, never yet had he passed so wholly under the dominion of that\nawe which attends a sudden triumph of the pure intellect. When at\nlength he rose, it was with wide, blank eyes, and limbs partly numbed.\nThese needed half-an-hour's walking before he could recover his mood of\npractical self-search.\n\nUntil the last moment he could not decide whether to let his mother\nknow how he had reached Twybridge. His arrival corresponded pretty well\nwith that of a train by which he might have come. But when the door\nopened to him, and the familiar faces smiled their welcome, he felt\nthat he must have nothing to do with paltry deceit; he told of his\nwalk, explaining it by the simple fact that this morning he had found\nhimself short of money. How that came to pass, no one inquired. Mrs.\nPeak, shocked at such martyrdom, tended him with all motherly care; for\nonce, Godwin felt that it was good to have a home, however simple.\n\nThis amiable frame of mind was not likely to last beyond the first day.\nMatter of irritation soon enough offered itself, as was invariably the\ncase at Twybridge. It was pleasant enough to be feted as the hero of\nthe family, to pull out a Kingsmill newspaper and exhibit the full\nreport of prize-day at Whitelaw, with his own name, in very small type,\ndemanding the world's attention, and finally to exhibit the volumes in\ntree-calf which his friend the librarian had forwarded to him. But\ndomestic circumstances soon made assault upon his nerves, and trial of\nhis brief patience.\n\nFirst of all, there came an unexpected disclosure. His sister Charlotte\nhad affianced herself to a young man of Twybridge, one Mr Cusse, whose\nprospects were as slender as his present means. Mrs Peak spoke of the\naffair in hushed privacy, with shaking of the head and frequent sighs,\nfor to her mind Mr. Cusse had few even personal recommendations. He was\na draper's assistant. Charlotte had made his acquaintance on occasions\nof church festivity, and urged the fact of his zeal in Sunday-school\ntuition as sufficient reply to all doubts. As he listened, Godwin bit\nhis lips.\n\n'Does he come here, then?' was his inquiry.\n\n'Once or twice a week. I haven't felt able to say anything against it,\nGodwin. I suppose it will be a very long engagement.'\n\nCharlotte was just twenty-two, and it seemed probable that she knew her\nown mind; in any case, she was of a character which would only be\ndriven to obstinacy by adverse criticism. Godwin learnt that his aunt\nEmily (Miss Cadman) regarded this connection with serious disapproval.\nHerself a shopkeeper, she might have been expected to show indulgence\nto a draper's assistant, but, so far from this, her view of Mr. Cusse\nwas severely scornful. She had nourished far other hopes for Charlotte,\nwho surely at her age (Miss Cadman looked from the eminence of\nfive-and-forty) should have been less precipitate. No undue harshness\nhad been exhibited by her relatives, but Charlotte took a stand which\nsufficiently declared her kindred with Godwin. She held her head higher\nthan formerly, spoke with habitual decision which bordered on\nsnappishness, and at times displayed the absentmindedness of one who in\nsilence suffers wrong.\n\nThere passed but a day or two before Godwin was brought face to face\nwith Mr. Cusse, who answered too well to the idea Charlotte's brother\nhad formed of him. He had a very smooth and shiny forehead, crowned by\nsleek chestnut hair; his chin was deferential; the bend of his body\nsignified a modest hope that he did his duty in the station to which\nProvidence had summoned him. Godwin he sought to flatter with looks of\nadmiring interest; also, by entering upon a conversation which was\nmeant to prove that he did not altogether lack worldly knowledge, of\nhowever little moment that might be in comparison with spiritual\nconcerns. Examining, volume by volume and with painful minuteness, the\nprizes Godwin had carried off, he remarked fervently, in each instance,\n'I can see how very interesting that is! So thorough, so thorough!'\nEven Charlotte was at length annoyed, when Mr. Cusse had exclaimed upon\nthe 'thoroughness' of Ben Jonson's works; she asked an abrupt question\nabout some town affair, and so gave her brother an opportunity of\ntaking the books away. There was no flagrant offence in the man. He\nspoke with passable accent, and manifested a high degree of amiability;\nbut one could not dissociate him from the counter. At the thought that\nhis sister might become Mrs. Cusse, Godwin ground his teeth. Now that\nhe came to reflect on the subject, he found in himself a sort of\nunreasoned supposition that Charlotte would always remain single; it\nseemed so unlikely that she would be sought by a man of liberal\nstanding, and at the same time so impossible for her to accept any one\nless than a gentleman. Yet he remembered that to outsiders such\nfastidiousness must show in a ridiculous light. What claim to gentility\nhad they, the Peaks? Was it not all a figment of his own self-conceit?\nEven in education Charlotte could barely assert a superiority to Mr.\nCusse, for her formal schooling had ended when she was twelve, and she\nhad never cared to read beyond the strait track clerical inspiration.\n\nThere were other circumstances which helped to depress his estimate of\nthe family dignity. His brother Oliver, now seventeen, was developing\ninto a type of young man as objectionable as it is easily recognised.\nThe slow, compliant boy had grown more flesh and muscle than once\nseemed likely, and his wits had begun to display that kind of\nvivaciousness which is only compatible with a nature moulded in common\nclay. He saw much company, and all of low intellectual order; he had\npurchased a bicycle, and regarded it as a source of distinction, a\nmeans of displaying himself before shopkeepers' daughters; he believed\nhimself a modest tenor, and sang verses of sentimental imbecility; he\ntook in several weekly papers of unpromising title, for the chief\npurpose of deciphering cryptograms, in which pursuit he had singular\nsuccess. Add to these characteristics a penchant for cheap jewellery,\nand Oliver Peak stands confessed.\n\nIt appeared to Godwin that his brother had leapt in a few months to\nthese heights of vulgar accomplishment; each separate revelation struck\nunexpectedly upon his nerves and severely tried his temper. When at\nlength Oliver, waiting for supper, began to dance grotesquely to an air\nwhich local talent had somehow caught from the London music-halls,\nGodwin's self-control gave way.\n\n'Is it your ambition,' he asked, with fiery sarcasm, 'to join a troupe\nof nigger minstrels?'\n\nOliver was startled into the military posture of attention. He\nanswered, with some embarrassment:\n\n'I can't say it is.'\n\n'Yet anyone would suppose so,' went on Godwin, hotly. 'Though you are\nemployed in a shop, I should have thought you might still aim at\nbehaving like a gentleman.'\n\nIndisposed to quarrel, and possessed of small skill in verbal fence,\nOliver drew aside with shadowed brow. As the brothers still had to\nshare one bedroom, they were presently alone together, and their\nmuteness, as they lay down to sleep, showed the estrangement that had\nat length come between them. When all had been dark and still for\nhalf-an-hour, Godwin spoke.\n\n'Are you awake?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'There was something about Uncle Andrew. I didn't mention. He talks of\nopening an eating-house just opposite Whitelaw.'\n\n'Oh.'\n\nThe tone of this signified nothing more than curiosity.\n\n'You don't see any reason why he shouldn't?'\n\nOliver delayed a little before replying.\n\n'I suppose it wouldn't be very nice for you.'\n\n'That's rather a mild way of putting it. It would mean that I should\nhave to leave the College, and give up all my hopes.'\n\n'I see,' returned the other, with slow apprehension.\n\nThere followed several minutes of silence. Then Godwin sat up in bed,\nas had always been his wont when he talked with earnestness at night.\n\n'If you think I lost my temper without cause at suppertime, just\nremember that I had that blackguard before my mind, and that it isn't\nvery pleasant to see you taking after that branch of our family.'\n\n'Do you mean to say I am like uncle?'\n\n'I mean to say that, if you are not careful, you won't be the kind of\nman I should like to see you. Do you know what is meant by inherited\ntendencies? Scientific men are giving a great deal of attention to such\nthings nowadays. Children don't always take after their parents; very\noften they show a much stronger likeness to a grandfather, or an uncle,\nor even more distant relatives. Just think over this, and make up your\nmind to resist any danger of that sort. I tell you plainly that the\nhabits you are getting into, and the people you make friends of, are\ndetestable. For heaven's sake, spend more of your time in a rational\nway, and learn to despise the things that shopkeepers admire. Read!\nForce yourself to stick hard at solid books for two or three hours\nevery day. If you don't, it's all up with you. I am speaking for your\nown good. Read, read, read!'\n\nQuietness ensued. Then Oliver began to move uneasily in his bed, and at\nlength his protest became audible.\n\n'I can't see what harm I do.'\n\n'No!' burst from his brother's lips, scornfully. 'And that's just your\ndanger. Do you suppose _I_ could sing nigger songs, and run about the\ntown with shopboys, and waste hours over idiotic puzzles?'\n\n'We're not all alike, and it wouldn't do for us to be.'\n\n'It would do very well for us all to have brains and to use them. The\nlife you lead is a brainless life, brainless and vulgar.'\n\n'Well, if I haven't got brains, I can't help it,' replied Oliver, with\nsullen resignation.\n\n'You have enough to teach you to live respectably, if only you look to\nthe right kind of example.'\n\nThere followed a vehement exhortation, now angry, now in strain of\nnatural kindliness. To this Oliver made only a few brief and muttered\nreplies; when it was all over, he fell asleep. But Godwin was wakeful\nfor hours.\n\nThe next morning he attempted to work for his approaching examination,\nbut with small result. It had begun to be very doubtful to him whether\nhe should 'go up' at all, and this uncertainty involved so great a\nchange in all his prospects that he could not command the mental calm\nnecessary for study. After dinner he went out with unsettled purpose.\nHe would gladly have conversed with Mr Gunnery, but the old people were\njust now on a stay with relatives in Bedfordshire, and their return\nmight be delayed for another week. Perhaps it behoved him to go and see\nMr. Moxey, but he was indisposed to visit the works, and if he went to\nthe house this evening he would encounter the five daughters, who, like\nall women who did not inspire him with admiration, excited his bashful\ndislike. At length he struck off into the country and indulged restless\nthoughts in places where no one could observe him.\n\nA result of the family's removal first from London to the farm, and\nthen into Twybridge, was that Godwin had no friends of old standing. At\nGreenwich, Nicholas Peak formed no intimacies, nor did a single\nassociate remain to him from the years of his growth and struggle; his\nwife, until the renewal of intercourse with her sister at Twybridge,\nhad no society whatever beyond her home. A boy reaps advantage from the\nhalf parental kindness of men and women who have watched his growth\nfrom infancy; in general it affects him as a steadying influence,\nkeeping before his mind the social bonds to which his behaviour owes\nallegiance. The only person whom Godwin regarded with feeling akin to\nthis was Mr. Gunnery, but the geologist found no favour with Mrs. Peak,\nand thus he involuntarily helped to widen the gap between the young man\nand his relatives. Nor had the intimacies of school time supplied\nGodwin with friendships for the years to come; his Twybridge\nclass-fellows no longer interested him, nor did they care to continue\nhis acquaintance. One was articled to a solicitor; one was learning the\ndrug-trade in his father's shop; another had begun to deal in corn; the\nrest were scattered about England, as students or salary-earners. The\ndominion of the commonplace had absorbed them, all and sundry; they\nwere the stuff which destiny uses for its every-day purposes, to keep\nthe world a-rolling.\n\nSo that Godwin had no ties which bound him strongly to any district. He\ncould not call himself a Londoner; for, though born in Westminster, he\nhad grown to consciousness on the outskirts of Greenwich, and\nremembered but dimly some of the London streets, and a few places of\npublic interest to which his father had taken him. Yet, as a matter of\ncourse, it was to London that his ambition pointed, when he forecast\nthe future. Where else could he hope for opportunity of notable\nadvancement? At Twybridge? Impossible to find more than means of\nsubsistence; his soul loathed such a prospect. At Kingsmill? There was\na slender hope that he might establish a connection with Whitelaw\nCollege, if he devoted himself to laboratory work; but what could come\nof that--at all events for many years? London, then? The only\nacceptable plan for supporting himself there was to succeed in a Civil\nService competition. That, indeed, seemed the most hopeful direction\nfor his efforts; a government office might afford him scope, and, he\nhad heard, would allow him abundant leisure.\n\nOr to go abroad? To enter for the Indian clerkships, and possibly\ncleave a wider way than could be hoped in England? There was allurement\nin the suggestion; travel had always tempted his fancy. In that case he\nwould be safely severed from the humble origin which in his native\ncountry might long be an annoyance, or even an obstacle; no Uncle\nAndrew could spring up at inconvenient moments in the middle of his\npath. Yes; this indeed might be best of all. He must send for papers,\nand give attention to the matter.\n\nMusing in this way, he had come within sight of the familiar chemical\nworks. It was near the hour at which Mr. Moxey was about to go home for\nhis afternoon dinner; why not interrupt his walk, and have a word with\nhim? That duty would be over.\n\nHe pushed on, and, as he approached the buildings, was aware of Mr\nMoxey stepping into the road, unaccompanied. Greetings speedily\nfollowed. The manufacturer, who was growing stout in his mellow years\nand looking more leisurely than when Godwin first knew him, beamed with\nsmiles of approbation.\n\n'Glad to see you; glad to see you! I have heard of your doings at\nCollege.'\n\n'Nothing to boast of, Mr. Moxey.'\n\n'Why, what would satisfy you? A nephew of mine was there last Friday,\nand tells me you carried off half a hundredweight of prizes. Here he\ncomes, I see.'\n\nThere drew near a young man of about four-and-twenty, well-dressed,\nsauntering with a cane in his hand. His name was Christian Moxey.\n\n'Much pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Peak,' he said, with a winning\nsmile. 'I was at Whitelaw the other day, when you distinguished\nyourself, and if I had known then that you were an acquaintance of my\nuncle's I should have been tempted to offer a word of congratulation.\nVery glad indeed to meet you.'\n\nGodwin, grateful as always for the show of kindness and flattered by\nsuch a reception, at once felt a liking for Christian Moxey. Most\npeople would have admitted the young man's attractiveness. He had a\nthin and sallow face, and seemed to be of weak constitution. In talking\nhe leant upon his cane, and his movements were languid; none the less,\nhis person was distinguished by an air of graceful manhood. His\nfeatures, separately considered, were ordinary enough; together they\nmade a countenance of peculiar charm, vividly illumined, full of appeal\nto whosoever could appreciate emotional capabilities. The interest he\nexcited in Peak appeared to be reciprocal, for his eyes dwelt as often\nand as long as possible on Godwin's features.\n\n'Come along, and have something to eat with us,' said Mr. Moxey, in a\ntone of genial invitation. 'I daresay you had dinner long enough ago to\nhave picked up a new appetite.'\n\nGodwin had a perturbing vision of the five Miss Moxeys and of a dinner\ntable, such as he was not used to sit at; he wished to decline, yet\nknew not how to do so with civility.\n\n'Yes, yes; come along!' added his friend, heartily. 'Tell us something\nabout your chemistry paper. Any posers this time? My nephew won't be\nout of it; he belongs to the firm of Bates Brothers--the Rotherhithe\npeople, you know.'\n\nThis information was a surprise to Godwin. He had imagined Christian\nMoxey either a gentleman at large, or at all events connected with some\nliberal profession. Glancing at the attractive face, he met a singular\nlook, a smile which suggested vague doubts. But Christian made no\nremark, and Mr. Moxey renewed his inquiries about the examination in\nchemistry.\n\nThe five daughters--all assembled in a homely sitting-room--were\nnothing less than formidable. Plain, soft-spoken, not ill educated,\nthey seemed to live in perfect harmony, and to derive satisfaction from\npursuits independent of external society. In the town they were seldom\nseen; few families called upon them; and only the most inveterate\ngossips found matter for small-talk in their retired lives. It had\nnever been heard that any one of them was sought in marriage. Godwin,\nsuperfluously troubled about his attire, met them with grim endeavour\nat politeness; their gravity, a result of shyness, he misinterpreted,\nsupposing them to hold aloof from a young man who had been in their\nfather's employ. But before he could suffer much from the necessity of\nformal conversation the door opened to admit yet another young lady, a\nperfect stranger to him. Her age was about seventeen, but she had\nnothing of the sprightly grace proverbially connected with that time of\nlife in girls; her pale and freckled visage expressed a haughty\nreserve, intensified as soon as her eye fell upon the visitor. She had\na slight but well-proportioned figure, and a mass of auburn hair\ncarelessly arranged.\n\n'My sister,' said Christian, glancing at Godwin. 'Marcella, you\nrecognise Mr. Peak.'\n\n'Oh yes,' the girl replied, as she came forward, and made a sudden\noffer of her hand.\n\nShe too had been present the other day at Whitelaw. Her 'Oh yes'\nsounded offensive to Godwin, yet in shaking hands with her he felt a\nwarm pressure, and it flattered him when he became aware that Marcella\nregarded him from time to time with furtive interest. Presently he\nlearnt that Christian and his sister were on a short visit at the house\nof their relatives; their home was in London. Marcella had seated\nherself stiffly by a window, and seemed to pay more attention to the\nview without than to the talk which went on, until dinner was announced.\n\nSpeculating on all he saw, Godwin noticed that Christian Moxey showed a\nmarked preference for the youngest of his cousins, a girl of eighteen,\nwhose plain features were frequently brightened with a happy and very\npleasant smile. When he addressed her (by the name of Janet) his voice\nhad a playful kindness which must have been significant to everyone who\nheard it. At dinner, his place was by her side, and he attended to her\nwith more than courtesy. This astonished Peak. He deemed it incredible\nthat any man should conceive a tender feeling for a girl so far from\nbeautiful. Constantly occupied with thought of sexual attachments, he\nhad never imagined anything of the kind apart from loveliness of\nfeature in the chosen object; his instincts were, in fact, revolted by\nthe idea of love for such a person as Janet Moxey. Christian seemed to\nbe degraded by such a suggestion. In his endeavour to solve the\nmystery, Godwin grew half unconscious of the other people about him.\n\nSuch play of the imaginative and speculative faculties accounts for the\ncommon awkwardness of intelligent young men in society that is strange\nto them. Only the cultivation of a double consciousness puts them\nfinally at ease. Impossible to converse with suavity, and to heed the\nforms of ordinary good-breeding, when the brain is absorbed in all\nmanner of new problems: one must learn to act a part, to control the\nfacial mechanism, to observe and anticipate, even whilst the intellect\nis spending its sincere energy on subjects unavowed. The perfectly\ngraceful man will always be he who has no strong apprehension either of\nhis own personality or of that of others, who lives on the surface of\nthings, who can be interested without emotion, and surprised without\ncontemplative impulse. Never yet had Godwin Peak uttered a word that\nwas worth listening to, or made a remark that declared his mental\npowers, save in most familiar colloquy. He was beginning to understand\nthe various reasons of his seeming clownishness, but this very process\nof self-study opposed an obstacle to improvement.\n\nWhen he found himself obliged to take part in conversation about\nWhitelaw College, Godwin was disturbed by an uncertainty which had\nnever left his mind at rest during the past two years;--was it, or was\nit not, generally known to his Twybridge acquaintances that he studied\nas the pensioner of Sir Job Whitelaw? To outward seeming all delicacy\nhad been exercised in the bestowal of Sir Job's benefaction. At the\nbeginning of each academic session Mrs. Peak had privately received a\ncheque which represented the exact outlay in fees for the course her\nson was pursuing; payment was then made to the registrar as if from\nPeak himself. But Lady Whitelaw's sisters were in the secret, and was\nit likely that they maintained absolute discretion in talking with\ntheir Twybridge friends? There seemed, in the first instance, to be a\ntacit understanding that the whole affair should remain strictly\nprivate, and to Godwin himself, sensible enough of such refinements, it\nwas by no means inconceivable that silence had been strictly preserved.\nHe found no difficulty in imagining that Sir Job's right hand knew\nnothing of what the left performed, and it might be that the\nauthorities of Whitelaw had no hint of his peculiar position. Still, he\nwas perchance mistaken. The Professors perhaps regarded him as a sort\nof charity-boy, and Twybridge possibly saw him in the same light. The\ndoubt flashed upon his mind while he was trying to eat and converse\nwith becoming self-possession. He dug his heel into the carpet and\nsilently cursed the burden of his servitude.\n\nWhen the meal was over, Mr. Moxey led the way out into the garden.\nChristian walked apart with Janet: Godwin strolled about between his\nhost and the eldest Miss Moxey, talking of he knew not what. In a short\nhalf-hour he screwed up his courage to the point of leave-taking.\nMarcella and three of her cousins had disappeared, so that the\nawkwardness of departure was reduced. Christian, who seemed to be in a\nvery contented mood, accompanied the guest as far as the garden gate.\n\n'What will be your special line of work when you leave Whitelaw?' he\ninquired. 'Your tastes seem about equally divided between science and\nliterature.'\n\n'I haven't the least idea what I shall do,' was Peak's reply.\n\n'Very much my own state of mind when I came home from Zurich a year\nago. But it had been taken for granted that I was preparing for\nbusiness, so into business I went.' He laughed good-humouredly.\n'Perhaps you will be drawn to London?'\n\n'Yes--I think it likely,' Godwin answered, with an absent glance this\nway and that.\n\n'In any case,' pursued the other, 'you'll be there presently for First\nB.A. Honours. Try to look in at my rooms, will you? I should be\ndelighted to see you. Most of my day is spent in the romantic locality\nof Rotherhithe, but I get home about five o'clock, as a rule. Let me\ngive you a card.'\n\n'Thank you.'\n\n'I daresay we shall meet somewhere about here before then. Of course\nyou are reading hard, and haven't much leisure. I'm an idle dog,\nunfortunately. I should like to work, but I don't quite know what at. I\nsuppose this is a transition time with me.'\n\nGodwin tried to discover the implication of this remark. Had it any\nreference to Miss Janet Moxey? Whilst he stood in embarrassed silence,\nChristian looked about with a peculiar smile, and seemed on the point\nof indulging in further self-revelation; but Godwin of a sudden held\nout his hand for good-bye, and with friendly smiles they parted.\n\nPeak was older than his years, and he saw in Christian one who might\nprove a very congenial associate, did but circumstances favour their\nintercourse. That was not very likely to happen, but the meeting at all\nevents turned his thoughts to London once more.\n\nHis attempts to 'read' were still unfruitful. For one thing, the stress\nand excitement of the Whitelaw examinations had wearied him; it was\ncharacteristic of the educational system in which he had become\ninvolved that studious effort should be called for immediately after\nthat frenzy of college competition. He ought now to have been\n'sweating' at his London subjects. Instead of that, he procured works\nof general literature from a Twybridge library, and shut himself up\nwith them in the garret bedroom.\n\nA letter from Mr. Gunnery informed him that the writer would be home in\na day or two. This return took place late one evening, and on the\nmorrow Godwin set forth to visit his friend. On reaching the house, he\nlearnt that Mr. Gunnery had suffered an accident which threatened\nserious results. Walking barefoot in his bedroom the night before, he\nhad stepped upon the point of a large nail, and was now prostrate,\nenduring much pain. Two days elapsed before Godwin could be admitted;\nhe then found the old man a mere shadow of his familiar\nself--bloodless, hollow-eyed.\n\n'This is the kind of practical joke that Fate likes to play upon us!'\nthe sufferer growled in a harsh, quaking voice, his countenance divided\nbetween genial welcome and surly wrath. 'It'll be the end of me. Pooh!\nwho doesn't know that such a thing is fatal at my age? Blood-poisoning\nhas fairly begun. I'd a good deal rather have broken my neck among\nhonest lumps of old red sandstone. A nail! A damned Brummagem nail!--So\nyou collared the first prize in geology, eh? I take that as a kindness,\nGodwin. You've got a bit beyond Figuier and his _Deluge_, eh? His\nDeluge, bah!'\n\nAnd he laughed discordantly. On the other side of the bed sat Mrs\nGunnery, grizzled and feeble dame. Shaken into the last stage of\nsenility by this alarm, she wiped tears from her flaccid cheeks, and\nmoaned a few unintelligible words.\n\nThe geologist's forecast of doom was speedily justified. Another day\nbereft him of consciousness, and when, for a short while, he had\nrambled among memories of his youth, the end came. It was found that he\nhad made a will, bequeathing his collections and scientific instruments\nto Godwin Peak: his books were to be sold for the benefit of the widow,\nwho would enjoy an annuity purchased out of her husband's savings. The\npoor old woman, as it proved, had little need of income; on the\nthirteenth day after Mr. Gunnery's funeral, she too was borne forth\nfrom the house, and the faithful couple slept together.\n\nTo inherit from the dead was an impressive experience to Godwin. At the\npresent stage of his development, every circumstance affecting him\nstarted his mind upon the quest of reasons, symbolisms, principles; the\n'natural supernatural' had hold upon him, and ruled his thought\nwhenever it was free from the spur of arrogant instinct. This tendency\nhad been strengthened by the influence of his friend Earwaker, a young\nman of singularly complex personality, positive and analytic in a far\nhigher degree than Peak, yet with a vein of imaginative vigour which\nseemed to befit quite a different order of mind. Godwin was not\ndistinguished by originality in thinking, but his strongly featured\ncharacter converted to uses of his own the intellectual suggestions he\nso rapidly caught from others. Earwaker's habit of reflection had much\nto do with the strange feelings awakened in Godwin when he transferred\nto his mother's house the cabinets which had been Mr. Gunnery's pride\nfor thirty or forty years. Joy of possession was subdued in him by the\nconflict of metaphysical questionings.\n\nDays went on, and nothing was heard of Uncle Andrew. Godwin tried to\nassure himself that he had been needlessly terrified; the eating-house\nproject would never be carried out. Practically dismissing that\nanxiety, he brooded over his defeat by Chilvers, and thought with\nextreme reluctance of the year still to be spent at Whitelaw, probably\na year of humiliation. In the meantime, should he or should he not\npresent himself for his First B.A.? The five pound fee would be a most\nserious demand upon his mother's resources, and did the profit warrant\nit, was it really of importance to him to take a degree?\n\nHe lived as much as possible alone, generally avoiding the society of\nhis relatives, save at meal times. A careless remark (not intentionally\noffensive) with reference to Mr. Cusse had so affronted Charlotte that\nshe never spoke to him save in reply to a question. Godwin regretted\nthe pain he had given, but could not bring himself to express this\nfeeling, for a discussion would inevitably have disclosed all his mind\nconcerning the draper's assistant. Oliver seemed to have forgiven his\nbrother's reproaches, but no longer behaved with freedom when Godwin\nwas present. For all this, the elder's irritation was often aroused by\nthings he saw and heard; and at length--on a memorable Saturday\nafternoon--debate revived between them. Oliver, as his custom was, had\nattired himself sprucely for a visit to acquaintances, and a silk hat\nof the very newest fashion lay together with his gloves upon the table.\n\n'What is this thing?' inquired Godwin, with ominous calm, as he pointed\nto the piece of head-gear.\n\n'A hat, I suppose,' replied his brother.\n\n'You mean to say you are going to wear that in the street?'\n\n'And why not?'\n\nOliver, not venturing to raise his eyes, stared at the table-cloth\nindignantly.\n\n'Can't you feel,' burst from the other, 'that it's a disgrace to buy\nand wear such a thing?'\n\n'Disgrace! what's the matter with the hat? It's the fashionable shape.'\n\nGodwin mastered his wrath, and turned contemptuously away. But Oliver\nhad been touched in a sensitive place; he was eager to defend himself.\n\n'I can't see what you're finding fault with,' he exclaimed. 'Everybody\nwears this shape.'\n\n'And isn't that quite sufficient reason why anyone who respects himself\nshould choose something as different as possible? Everybody! That is to\nsay, all the fools in the kingdom. It's bad enough to follow when you\ncan't help it, but to imitate asses gratuitously is the lowest depth of\ndegradation. Don't you know that that is the meaning of vulgarity? How\nyou can offer such an excuse passes my comprehension. Have you no self?\nAre you made, like this hat, on a pattern with a hundred thousand\nothers?'\n\n'You and I are different,' said Oliver, impatiently. 'I am content to\nbe like other people.'\n\n'And I would poison myself with vermin-killer if I felt any risk of\nsuch contentment! Like other people? Heaven forbid and forfend! Like\nother people? Oh, what a noble ambition!'\n\nThe loud passionate voice summoned Mrs. Peak from an adjacent room.\n\n'Godwin! Godwin!' she remonstrated. 'Whatever is it? Why should you put\nyourself out so?'\n\nShe was a short and slender woman, with an air of gentility,\nindependent of her badly made and long worn widow's dress.\nSelf-possession marked her manner, and the even tones in which she\nspoke gave indication of a mild, perhaps an unemotional, temperament.\n\nOliver began to represent his grievance.\n\n'What harm is there, if I choose to wear a hat that's in fashion? I pay\nfor it out of my own'--\n\nBut he was interrupted by a loud visitor's knock at the front door,\ndistant only a few paces. Mrs. Peak turned with a startled look.\nGodwin, dreading contact with friends of the family, strode upstairs.\nWhen the door was opened, there appeared the smiling countenance of\nAndrew Peak; he wore the costume of a traveller, and by his side stood\na boy of ten, too plainly his son.\n\n'Well, Grace!' was his familiar greeting, as the widow drew back. 'I\ntold you you'd 'ev the pleasure of seem' me again before so very long.\nGodwin at 'ome with you, I s'pose? Thet you, Noll? 'Ow do, my bo-oy?\n'Ere's yer cousin Jowey. Shike 'ands, Jowey bo-oy! Sorry I couldn't\nbring my old lady over this time, Grace; she sends her respects, as\nusual. 'Ow's Charlotte? Bloomin', I 'ope?'\n\nHe had made his way into the front parlour, dragging the youngster\nafter him. Having deposited his handbag and umbrella on the sofa, he\nseated himself in the easy-chair, and began to blow his nose with\nvigour.\n\n'Set down, Jowey; set down, bo-oy! Down't be afride of your awnt.'\n\n'Oi ain't afride!' cried the youth, in a tone which supported his\nassertion.\n\nMrs. Peak trembled with annoyance and indecision. Andrew evidently\nmeant to stay for some time, and she could not bring herself to treat\nhim with plain discourtesy; but she saw that Oliver, after shaking\nhands in a very strained way, had abruptly left the room, and Godwin\nwould be anything but willing to meet his uncle. When the name of her\nelder son was again mentioned she withdrew on the pretence of summoning\nhim, and went up to his room. Godwin had heard the hateful voice, and\nwas in profound disturbance.\n\n'What does he say, mother?' he inquired anxiously. 'Anything about\nKingsmill?'\n\n'Not yet. Oh, I _do_ so wish we could bring this connection to an end!'\n\nIt was the first time Mrs. Peak had uttered her sentiments so\nunreservedly.\n\n'Then, shall I see him in private,' said Godwin, 'and simply let him\nknow the truth?'\n\n'I dread the thought of that, Godwin. He would very likely be coarse\nand violent. I must try to show him by my manner. Oliver has gone out,\nand when Charlotte comes home I'll tell her to keep out of sight. He\nhas brought his boy. Suppose you don't come down at all? I might say\nyou are too busy.'\n\n'No, no; you shan't have to do it all alone. I'll come down with you. I\nmust hear what he has to say.'\n\nThey descended. As soon as his nephew appeared, Andrew sprang up, and\nshouted joyfully:\n\n'Well, Godwin, bo-oy! It's all settled! Got the bloomin' shop from next\nquarter dye! \"Peak's Dinin' and Refreshment Rooms!\" Jowey an' me was\nover there all yisterday--wasn't us, Jowey? Oh, it's immense!'\n\nGodwin felt the blood buzz in his ears, and a hot choking clutch at his\nthroat. He took his stand by the mantelpiece, and began to turn a\nlittle glass ornament round and round. Fate had spoken. On the instant,\nall his College life was far behind him, all his uneasiness regarding\nthe next session was dispelled, and he had no more connection with\nKingsmill.\n\nMrs. Peak had heard from Oliver of her brother-in-law's proposed\nundertaking. She had spoken of it with anxiety to Godwin, who merely\nshrugged his shoulders and avoided the topic, ashamed to dwell on the\nparticulars of his shame. In hearing Andrew's announcement she had much\nado to repress tears of vexation; silently she seated herself, and\nlooked with pained countenance from uncle to nephew.\n\n'Shall you make any changes in the place?' Godwin asked, carelessly.\n\n'Shan't I, jest! It'll take a month to refit them eatin' rooms. I'm\nagoin' to do it proper--up to Dick! and I want your 'elp, my bo-oy. You\nan' me 'II jest write a bit of a circular--see? to send round to the\nbig pots of the Collige, an' all the parents of the young fellers as we\ncan get the addresses of--see?'\n\nEven amid his pangs of mortification Godwin found himself pondering an\nintellectual question. Was his uncle wholly unconscious of the misery\nhe was causing? Had it never occurred to him that the public proximity\nof an uneducated shopkeeping relative must be unwelcome to a lad who\nwas distinguishing himself at Whitelaw College? Were that truly the\ncase, then it would be unjust to regard Andrew resentfully; destiny\nalone was to blame. And, after all, the man might be so absorbed in his\nown interest, so strictly confined to the views of his own class, as\nnever to have dreamt of the sensibilities he wounded. In fact, the\nshame excited by this prospect was artificial. Godwin had already felt\nthat it was unworthy alike of a philosopher and of a high-minded man of\nthe world. The doubt as to Andrew's state of mind, and this moral\nproblem, had a restraining effect upon the young man's temper. A\npractical person justifies himself in wrath as soon as his judgment is\nat one with that of the multitude. Godwin, though his passions were of\nexceptional force, must needs refine, debate with himself points of\nabstract justice.\n\n'I've been tellin' Jowey, Grace, as I 'ope he may turn out such another\nas Godwin 'ere. 'E'll go to Collige, will Jowey. Godwin, jest arst the\nbo-oy a question or two, will you? 'E ain't been doin' bad at 'is\nschool. Jest put 'im through 'is pyces, as yer may sye. Stend up,\nJowey, bo-oy.'\n\nGodwin looked askance at his cousin, who stood with pert face, ready\nfor any test.\n\n'What's the date of William the Conqueror?' he asked, mechanically.\n\n'Ow!' shouted the youth. 'Down't mike me larff! Zif I didn't know thet!\nTensixsixtenightysivn, of course!'\n\nThe father turned round with an expression of such sincere pride that\nGodwin, for all his loathing, was obliged to smile.\n\n'Jowey, jest sye a few verses of poitry; them as you learnt larst. 'E's\ngood at poitry, is Jowey.'\n\nThe boy broke into fearsome recitation:\n\n'The silly buckits _on_ the deck That 'ed so long rem'ined, I dreamt as\nthey was filled with jew, End when I awowk, it r'ined.'\n\nHalf-a-dozen verses were thus massacred, and the reciter stopped with\nthe sudden jerk of a machine.\n\n'Goes str'ight on, don't 'e, Grace?' cried the father, exultantly.\n'Jowey ain't no fool. Know what he towld me the other day? Somethin' as\nI never knew, and shouldn't never 'ave thought of s'long as I lived. We\nwas talkin' about jewellery, an' Jowey, 'e pops up all at wunst. \"It's\ncalled jewellery,\" says 'e, \"'cos it's mostly the Jews as sell it.\"\nNow, oo'd a thought o' that? But you see it's right as soon as you're\ntowld, eh? Now ain't it right, Godwin?'\n\n'No doubt,' was the dry answer.\n\n'It never struck me,' murmured Mrs. Peak, who took her son's assent\nseriously, and felt that it was impossible to preserve an obstinate\nsilence.\n\n''E ain't no fool, ain't Jowey!' cried the parent. 'Wite till 'e gits\nto Collige. Godwin'll put us up to all the ins and outs. Plenty o' time\nfor that; 'e'll often run over an' 'ev a bit o' dinner, and no need to\ntalk about p'yment.'\n\n'Do you stay in Twybridge to-night?' inquired Godwin, who had changed\nin look and manner, so that he appeared all but cheerful.\n\n'No, we're on our w'y 'ome, is Jowey an' me. Jest thought we'd break\nthe journey 'ere. We shall ketch the six-fifty hup.'\n\n'Then you will have a cup of tea with us,' said Mrs. Peak, surprised at\nGodwin's transformation, but seeing that hospitality was now\nunavoidable.\n\nCharlotte presently entered the house, and, after a private\nconversation with her mother, went to greet Andrew. If only to signify\nher contempt for Godwin's prejudices, Charlotte would have behaved\ncivilly to the London uncle. In the end, Andrew took his leave in the\nfriendliest possible way, repeating often that he would soon have the\npleasure of entertaining Mrs. Peak and all her family at his new\ndining-rooms over against Whitelaw College.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nImmediately upon his uncle's departure, Godwin disappeared; Mrs. Peak\ncaught only a glimpse of him as he went by the parlour window. In a\nshort time Oliver came home, and, having learned what had happened,\njoined his mother and sister in a dull, intermittent conversation on\nthe subject of Godwin's future difficulties.\n\n'He won't go back to Whitelaw,' declared the lad. 'He said he wouldn't.'\n\n'People must be above such false shame,' was Charlotte's opinion. 'I\ncan't see that it will make the slightest difference in his position or\nhis prospects.'\n\nWhereupon her mother's patience gave way.\n\n'Don't talk such nonsense, Charlotte! You understand perfectly well how\nserious it will be. I never knew anything so cruel.'\n\n'I was never taught,' persisted the girl, with calm obstinacy, 'that\none ought to be ashamed of one's relatives just because they are in a\nhumble position.'\n\nOliver brought the tedious discussion to an end by clamouring for\nsupper. The table was laid, and all were about to sit down when Godwin\npresented himself. To the general astonishment, he seemed in excellent\nspirits, and ate more heartily than usual. Not a word was spoken of\nUncle Andrew, until Mrs. Peak and her elder son were left alone\ntogether; then Godwin remarked in a tone of satisfied decision:\n\n'Of course, this is the end of my work at Whitelaw. We must make new\nplans, mother.'\n\n'But how can we, dear? What will Lady Whitelaw say?'\n\n'I have to think it out yet. In a day or two I shall very likely write\na letter to Lady Whitelaw. There's no need, you know, to go talking\nabout this in Twybridge. Just leave it to me, will you?'\n\n'It's not a subject I care to talk about, you may be sure. But I do\nhope you won't do anything rash, Godwin.'\n\n'Not I. To tell you the truth, I'm not at all sorry to leave. It was a\nmistake that I went in for the Arts course--Greek, and Latin, and so\non, you know; I ought to have stuck to science. I shall go back to it\nnow. Don't be afraid. I'll make a position for myself before long. I'll\nrepay all you have spent on me.'\n\nTo this conclusion had he come. The process of mind was favoured by his\ndefeat in all the Arts subjects; in that direction he could see only\nthe triumphant Chilvers, a figure which disgusted him with Greeks,\nRomans, and all the ways of literature. As to his future efforts he was\nby no means clear, but it eased him greatly to have cast off a burden\nof doubt; his theorising intellect loved the sensation of life thrown\nopen to new, however vague, possibilities. At present he was convinced\nthat Andrew Peak had done him a service. In this there was an\nindication of moral cowardice, such as commonly connects itself with\nintense pride of individuality. He desired to shirk the combat with\nChilvers, and welcomed as an excuse for doing so the shame which\nanother temper would have stubbornly defied.\n\nNow he would abandon his B.A. examination,--a clear saving of money.\nPresently it might suit him to take the B.Sc. instead; time enough to\nthink of that. Had he but pursued the Science course from the first,\nwho at Whitelaw could have come out ahead of him? He had wasted a\ncouple of years which might have been most profitably applied: by this\ntime he might have been ready to obtain a position as demonstrator in\nsome laboratory, on his way perhaps to a professorship. How had he thus\nbeen led astray? Not only had his boyish instincts moved strongly\ntowards science, but was not the tendency of the age in the same\ndirection? Buckland Warricombe, who habitually declaimed against\nclassical study, was perfectly right; the world had learned all it\ncould from those hoary teachers, and must now turn to Nature. On every\nhand, the future was with students of the laws of matter. Often, it was\ntrue, he had been tempted by the thought of a literary career; he had\nwritten in verse and prose, but with small success. An attempt to\ncompose the Prize Poem was soon abandoned in discouragement; the essay\nhe sent in had not been mentioned. These honours had fallen to\nEarwaker, with whom it was not easy to compete on such ground. No, he\nwas not born a man of letters. But in science, granted fair\nopportunity, he might make a name. He might, and he would!\n\nOn the morrow, splendour of sunshine drew him forth to some distance\nfrom the town. He went along the lanes singing; now it was holiday with\nhim, and for the first time he could enjoy the broad golden daylight,\nthe genial warmth. In a hollow of grassy fields, where he least\nexpected to encounter an acquaintance, it was his chance to come upon\nChristian Moxey, stretched at full length in the company of nibbling\nsheep. Since the dinner at Mr. Moxey's, he had neither seen nor heard\nof Christian, who, it seemed probable, was back at his work in\nRotherhithe. As their looks met, both laughed.\n\n'I won't get up,' said Christian; 'the effort would be too great. Sit\ndown and let us have a talk.'\n\n'I disturb your thoughts,' answered Godwin.\n\n'A most welcome disturbance; they weren't very pleasant just then. In\nfact, I have come as far as this in the hope of escaping them. I'm not\nmuch of a walker, are you?'\n\n'Well, yes, I enjoy a good walk.'\n\n'You are of an energetic type,' said Christian, musingly. 'You will do\nsomething in life. When do you go up for Honours?'\n\n'I have decided not to go in at all.'\n\n'Indeed; I'm sorry to hear that.'\n\n'I have half made up my mind not to return to Whitelaw.'\n\nObserving his hearer's look of surprise, Godwin asked himself whether\nit signified a knowledge of his footing at Whitelaw. The possibility of\nthis galled him; but it was such a great step to have declared, as it\nwere in public, an intention of freeing himself, that he was able to\ntalk on with something of aggressive confidence.\n\n'I think I shall go in for some practical work of a scientific kind. It\nwas a mistake for me to pursue the Arts course.'\n\nChristian looked at him earnestly.\n\n'Are you sure of that?'\n\n'Yes, I feel sure of it.'\n\nThere was silence. Christian beat the ground with his stick.\n\n'Your state of mind, then,' he said at length, 'is more like my own\nthan I imagined. I, too, have wavered for a long time between\nliterature and science, and now at last I have quite\ndecided--quite--that scientific study is the only safe line for me. The\nfact is, a man must concentrate himself. Not only for the sake of\npractical success, but--well, for his own sake.'\n\nHe spoke lazily, dreamily, propped upon his elbow, seeming to watch the\nsheep which panted at a few yards from him.\n\n'I have no right,' he pursued, with a shadow of kindly anxiety on his\nfeatures, 'to offer you advice, but--well, if you will let me insist on\nwhat I have learned from my own experience. There's nothing like having\na special line of work and sticking to it vigorously. I, unfortunately,\nshall never do anything of any account,--but I know so well the\nconflict between diverging tastes. It has played the deuce with me, in\nall sorts of ways. At Zurich I utterly wasted my time, and I've done no\nbetter since I came back to England. Don't think me presumptuous. I\nonly mean--well, it is so important to--to go ahead in one line.'\n\nHis air of laughing apology was very pleasant. Godwin felt his heart\nopen to the kind fellow.\n\n'No one needs the advice more than I,' he replied. 'I am going back to\nthe line I took naturally when I first began to study at all.'\n\n'But why leave Whitelaw?' asked Christian, gently.\n\n'Because I dislike it--I can't tell you why.'\n\nWith ready tact Moxey led away from a subject which he saw was painful.\n\n'Of course there are many other places where one can study just as\nwell.'\n\n'Do you know anything of the School of Mines in London?' Godwin\ninquired, abruptly.\n\n'I worked there myself for a short time.'\n\n'Then you could tell me about the--the fees, and so on?'\n\nChristian readily gave the desired information, and the listener mused\nover it.\n\n'Have you any friends in London?' Moxey asked, at length.\n\n'No. But I don't think that matters. I shall work all the harder.'\n'Perhaps so,' said the other, with some hesitation. And he added\nthoughtfully, 'It depends on one's temperament. Doesn't answer to be\ntoo much alone--I speak for myself at all events. I know very few\npeople in London--very few that I care anything about. That, in fact,\nis one reason why I am staying here longer than I intended.' He seemed\nto speak rather to himself than to Godwin; the half-smile on his lips\nexpressed a wish to disclose circumstances and motives which were yet\nhardly a suitable topic in a dialogue such as this. 'I like the\natmosphere of a--of a comfortable home. No doubt I should get on\nbetter--with things in general--if I had a home of my own. I live in\nlodgings, you know; my sister lives with friends. Of course one has a\nsense of freedom, but then'--\n\nHis voice murmured off into silence, and again he beat the ground with\nhis cane. Godwin was strongly interested in this broken revelation; he\nfound it difficult to understand Moxey's yearning for domesticity, all\nhis own impulses leading towards quite a contrary ideal. To him, life\nin London lodgings made rich promise; that indeed would be freedom, and\nfull of all manner of high possibilities!\n\nEach communed with his thoughts. Happening to glance at Christian,\nGodwin was struck with the graceful attitude in which the young man\nreclined; he himself squatted awkwardly on the grass, unable to abandon\nhimself in natural repose, even as he found it impossible to talk with\nthe ease of unconsciousness. The contrast, too, between his garments,\nhis boots, and those of the Londoner was painful enough to him. Without\nbeing a dandy, Christian, it was evident, gave a good deal of thought\nto costume. That kind of thing had always excited Godwin's contempt,\nbut now he confessed himself envious; doubtless, to be well dressed was\na great step towards the finished ease of what is called a gentlemanly\ndemeanour, which he knew he was very far from having attained.\n\n'Well,' exclaimed Christian, unexpectedly, 'if I can be of ever so\nlittle use to you, pray let me. I must get back to town in a few days,\nbut you know my address. Write to me, I beg, if you wish for any more\ninformation.'\n\nThe talk turned to less difficult topics. Godwin made inquiries about\nZurich, then about Switzerland in general.\n\n'Did you see much of the Alps?'\n\n'Not as a climber sees them. That sort of thing isn't in my way; I\nhaven't the energy--more's the pity. Would you like to see a lot of\ngood photographs I brought back? I have them here; brought them to show\nthe girls.'\n\nIn spite of the five Miss Moxeys and Christian's sister, Peak accepted\nthe invitation to walk back with his companion, and presently they\nbegan to stroll towards Twybridge.\n\n'I have an absurd tendency to dream--to lose myself amid ideals--I\ndon't quite know how to express it,' Christian resumed, when both had\nbeen silent for some minutes. 'That's why I mean to go in earnestly for\nscience--as a corrective. Fortunately, I have to work for my living;\notherwise, I should moon my life away--no doubt. My sister has ten\ntimes as much energy--she knows much more than I do already. What a\nsplendid thing it is to be of an independent character! I had rather be\na self-reliant coal-heaver than a millionaire of uncertain will. My\nuncle--there's a man who knows his own mind. I respect those strong\npractical natures. Don't be misled by ideals. Make the most of your\ncircumstances. Don't aim at--but I beg your pardon; I don't know what\nright I have to lecture you in this way.' And he broke off with his\npleasant, kind-hearted laugh, colouring a little.\n\nThey reached Mr. Moxey's house. In a garden chair on the lawn sat Miss\nJanet, occupied with a book. She rose to meet them, shook hands with\nGodwin, and said to her cousin:\n\n'The postman has just left a letter for you--forwarded from London.'\n\n'Indeed? I'm going to show Mr. Peak my Swiss photographs. You wouldn't\ncare to come and help me in the toil of turning them over?'\n\n'O lazy man!'\n\nHer laugh was joyous. Any one less prejudiced than Peak would have\nrecognised the beauty which transformed her homely features as she met\nChristian's look.\n\nOn the hall table lay the letter of which Janet had spoken. Christian\ntook it up, and Godwin, happening at that moment to observe him, caught\nthe tremor of a sudden emotion on lip and eyelid. Instantly, prompted\nby he knew not what perception, he turned his gaze to Janet, and in\ntime to see that she also was aware of her cousin's strong interest in\nthe letter, which was at once put away in Christian's pocket.\n\nThey passed into the sitting-room, where a large portfolio stood\nagainst the back of a chair. The half-hour which ensued was to Godwin a\ntime of uneasiness. His pleasure in the photographs suffered\ndisturbance from a subtle stress on his nerves, due to something\nindeterminable in the situation, of which he formed a part. Janet's\nmerry humour seemed to be subdued. Christian was obviously forcing\nhimself to entertain the guest whilst his thoughts were elsewhere. As\nsoon as possible, Godwin rose to depart. He was just saying good-bye to\nJanet, when Marcella entered the room. She stood still, and Christian\nsaid, hurriedly:\n\n'It's possible, Marcella, that Mr. Peak will be coming to London before\nlong. We may have the pleasure of seeing him there.'\n\n'You will be glad, I'm sure,' answered his sister. Then, as if forcing\nherself to address Peak directly, she faced to him and added, 'It isn't\neasy to find sympathetic companions.'\n\n'I, at all events, haven't found very many,' Godwin replied, meaning to\nspeak in a tone only half-serious, but conscious at once that he had\nmade what might seem an appeal for sympathy. Thereupon his pride\nrevolted, and in a moment drove him from the room.\n\nChristian followed, and at the front door shook hands with him. Nervous\nimpatience was unmistakable in the young man's look and words. Again\nGodwin speculated on the meaning of this, and wondered, in connection\ntherewith, what were the characteristics which Marcella Moxey looked\nfor in a 'sympathetic companion'.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn the course of the afternoon, Godwin sat down to pen the rough draft\nof a letter to Lady Whitelaw. When the first difficulties were\nsurmounted, he wrote rapidly, and at considerable length. It was not\neasy, at his time of life, to compress into the limits of an ordinary\nepistle all he wished to say to the widow of his benefactor. His\npurpose was, with all possible respect yet as firmly as might be, to\ninform Lady Whitelaw that he could not spend the last of his proposed\nthree years at the College in Kingsmill, and furthermore to request of\nher that she would permit his using the promised sum of money as a\nstudent at the Royal School of Mines. This had to be done without\nconfession of the reasons for his change of plan; he could not even\nhint at them. Yet cause must be assigned, and the best form of words he\ncould excogitate ran thus: 'Family circumstances render it\ndesirable--almost necessary--that I should spend the next twelve months\nin London. In spite of sincere reluctance to leave Whitelaw College, I\nam compelled to take this step.' The lady must interpret that as best\nshe might. Very hard indeed was the task of begging a continuance of\nher bounty under these changed conditions. Could he but have resigned\nthe money, all had been well; his tone might then have been dignified\nwithout effort. But such disinterestedness he could not afford. His\nmother might grant him money enough barely to live upon until he\ndiscovered means of support--for his education she was unable to pay.\nAfter more than an hour's work he had moderately satisfied himself;\nindeed, several portions of the letter struck him as well composed, and\nhe felt that they must heighten the reader's interest in him. With an\nauthor's pleasure (though at the same time with much uneasiness) he\nperused the appeal again and again.\n\nLate in the evening, when he was alone with his mother, he told her\nwhat he had done, and read the letter for her opinion. Mrs. Peak was\ngravely troubled.\n\n'Lady Whitelaw will ask her sisters for an explanation,' she said.\n\n'I have thought of that,' Godwin replied, with the confident, cheerful\nair he had assumed from the first. 'If the Miss Lumbs go to aunt, she\nmust be prepared to put them off in some way. But look here, mother,\nwhen uncle has opened his shop, it's pretty certain that some one or\nother will hit on the true explanation of my disappearance. Let them.\nThen Lady Whitelaw will understand and forgive me.'\n\nAfter much musing, the mother ventured a timid question, the result of\nher anxieties rather than of her judgment on the point at issue.\n\n'Godwin, dear, are you quite sure that his shop would make so much\ndifference?'\n\nThe young man gave a passionate start.\n\n'What! To have the fellows going there to eat, and hearing his talk,\nand--? Not for a day could I bear it! Not for an hour!'\n\nHe was red with anticipated shame, and his voice shook with indignation\nat the suggested martyrdom. Mrs. Peak dried a tear.\n\n'You would be so alone in London, Godwin.'\n\n'Not a bit of it. Young Mr. Moxey will be a useful friend, I am\nconvinced he will. To tell you the whole truth, I aim at getting a\nplace at the works in Rotherhithe, where he no doubt has influence. You\nsee, mother, I might manage it even before the end of the year. Our Mr.\nMoxey will be disposed to help me with his recommendation.'\n\n'But, my dear, wouldn't it come to the same thing, then, if you went\nback to Mr. Moxey's?'\n\nHe made a gesture of impatience.\n\n'No, no, no! I couldn't live at Twybridge. I have my way to make,\nmother, and the place for that is London. You know I am ambitious.\nTrust me for a year or two, and see the result. I depend upon your help\nin this whole affair. Don't refuse it me. I have done with Whitelaw,\nand I have done with Twybridge: now comes London. You can't regard me\nas a boy, you know.'\n\n'No--but'--\n\n'But me no buts!' he cried, laughing excitedly. 'The thing is settled.\nAs soon as possible in the morning I post this letter. I feel it will\nbe successful. See aunt to-morrow, and get her support. Mind that\nCharlotte and Oliver don't talk to people. If you all use discretion,\nthere's no need for any curiosity to be excited.'\n\nWhen Godwin had taken a resolve, there was no domestic influence strong\nenough to prevent his acting upon it. Mrs. Peak's ignorance of the\nworld, her mild passivity, and the faith she had in her son's\nintellectual resources, made her useless as a counsellor, and from no\none else--now that Mr. Gunnery was dead--would the young man have\ndreamt of seeking guidance. Whatever Lady Whitelaw's reply, he had made\nup his mind to go to London. Should his subsidy be refused, then he\nwould live on what his mother could allow him until--probably with the\naid of Christian Moxey--he might obtain a salaried position. The letter\nwas despatched, and with feverish impatience he awaited a reply.\n\nNine days passed, and he heard nothing. Half that delay sufficed to\nbring out all the self-tormenting capacities of a nature such as his.\nTo his mother's conjectural explanations he could lend no ear.\nDoubtless Lady Whitelaw (against whom, for subtle reasons, he was\nalready prejudiced) had taken offence; either she would not reply at\nall, or presently there would come a few lines of polite displeasure,\nintimating her disinclination to aid his project. He silently raged\nagainst 'the woman'. Her neglect was insolence. Had she not delicacy\nenough to divine the anxiety natural to one in his dependent position?\nDid she take him for an every-day writer of mendicant appeals? His\npride fed upon the outrage and became fierce.\n\nThen arrived a small glossy envelope, containing a tiny sheet of very\nthick note-paper, whereon it was written that Lady Whitelaw regretted\nher tardiness in replying to him (caused by her absence from home), and\nhoped he would be able to call upon her, at ten o'clock next morning,\nat the house of her sisters, the Misses Lumb, where she was stopping\nfor a day--she remained his sincerely.\n\nHaving duly contorted this note into all manner of painful meanings,\nGodwin occupied an hour in making himself presentable (scornful that he\nshould deem such trouble necessary), and with furiously beating heart\nset out to walk through Twybridge. Arrived at the house, he was led by\na servant into the front room on the ground floor, where Lady Whitelaw,\nalone, sat reading a newspaper. Her features were of a very common\norder, and nothing distinguished her from middle-aged women of average\nrefinement; she had chubby hands, rather broad shoulders, and no\nvisible waist. The scrutiny she bestowed upon her visitor was close. To\nGodwin's feelings it too much resembled that with which she would have\nreceived an applicant for the post of footman. Yet her smile was\nfriendly enough, and no lack of civility appeared in the repetition of\nher excuses for having replied so late.\n\n'Let us talk about this,' she began, when Godwin was uneasily seated.\n(She spoke with an excess of precision, as though it had at one time\nbeen needful for her to premeditate polished phrases.) 'I am very sorry\nyou should have to think of quitting the College; very sorry indeed.\nYou are one of the students who do honour to the institution.'\n\nThis was pleasant, and Godwin felt a regret of the constraint that was\nupon him. In his endeavour not to display a purring smile, he looked\ngrim, as if the compliment were beneath his notice.\n\n'Pray don't think,' she pursued, 'that I wish you to speak more fully\nabout the private circumstances you refer to in your letter. But do let\nme ask you: Is your decision final? Are you sure that when the\nvacations are over you will see things just as you do now?'\n\n'I am quite sure of it,' he replied.\n\nThe emphasis was merely natural to him. He could not so govern his\nvoice as to convey the respectful regret which at this moment he felt.\nA younger lady, one who had heightened the charm of her compliment with\nsubtle harmony of tones and strongly feminine gaze, would perhaps have\nelicited from him a free confession. Gratitude and admiration would\nhave made him capable of such frankness. But in the face of this\nnewspaper-reading woman (yes, he had unaccountably felt it jar upon him\nthat a lady should be reading a newspaper), under her matronly smile,\nhe could do no more than plump out his 'quite sure'. To Lady Whitelaw\nit sounded altogether too curt; she was conscious of her position as\npatroness, and had in fact thought it likely that the young man would\nbe disposed to gratify her curiosity in some measure.\n\n'I can only say that I am sorry to hear it,' fell from her tightened\nlips, after a moment's pause.\n\nInstantly Godwin's pride expelled the softer emotion. He pressed hard\nwith his feet upon the floor, every nerve in his body tense with that\ndistressing passion peculiar to the shyly arrogant. Regard him, and you\nhad imagined he was submitting to rebuke for an offence he could not\ndeny.\n\nLady Whitelaw waited. A minute, almost, and Peak gave no sign of\nopening his mouth.\n\n'It is certainly much to be regretted,' she said at length, coolly. 'Of\ncourse, I don't know what prospects you may have in London, but, if you\nhad remained at the College, something advantageous would no doubt have\noffered before long.'\n\nThere went small tact to the wording of this admonition. Impossible for\nLady Whitelaw to understand the complexities of a character such as\nGodwin's, even had she enjoyed opportunities of studying it; but many a\nwoman of the world would have directed herself more cautiously after\nreading that letter of his. Peak's impulse was to thank her for the\npast, and declare that henceforth he would dispense with aid; only the\nchoking in his throat obstructed some such utterance. He resented\nprofoundly her supposition (natural enough) that his chief aim was to\nestablish himself in a self-supporting career. What? Am I to be\ngrateful for a mere chance of earning my living? Have I not shown that\nI am capable of something more than the ordinary lot in life? From the\nheights of her assured independence, does she look down upon me as a\nyoung man seeking a 'place'? He was filled with wrath, and all because\na good, commonplace woman could not divine that he dreamt of European\nfame.\n\n'I am very sorry that I can't take that into account,' he managed to\nsay. 'I wish to give this next year exclusively to scientific study,\nand after that I shall see what course is open to me.'\n\nHe was not of the men who can benefit by patronage, and be simply\ngrateful for it. His position was a false one: to be begging with\nawkward show of thankfulness for a benefaction which in his heart he\ndetested. He knew himself for an undesigning hypocrite, and felt that\nhe might as well have been a rascal complete. Gratitude! No man capable\nof it in fuller measure than he; but not to such persons as Lady\nWhitelaw. Before old Sir Job he could more easily have bowed himself.\nBut this woman represented the superiority of mere brute wealth,\nagainst which his soul rebelled.\n\nThere was another disagreeable silence, during which Lady Whitelaw\ncommented on her protege very much as Mrs. Warricombe had done.\n\n'Will you allow me to ask,' she said at length, with cold politeness,\n'whether you have acquaintances in London?'\n\n'Yes. I know some one who studied at the School of Mines.'\n\n'Well, Mr. Peak, I see that your mind is made up. And no doubt you are\nthe best judge of your private circumstances. I must ask you to let me\nthink over the matter for a day or two. I will write to you.'\n\n'And I to you,' thought Godwin; a resolve which enabled him to rise\nwith something like a conventional smile, and thus put an end to a very\nbrief and quite unsatisfactory interview.\n\nHe strode homewards in a state of feverish excitement. His own\nbehaviour had been wretchedly clownish; he was only too well aware of\nthat. He ought to have put aside all the grosser aspects of his case,\nand have exhibited the purely intellectual motives which made such a\nchange as he purposed seem desirable to him. That would have been to\nact with dignity; that would have been the very best form of gratitude\nfor the kindness he had received. But no, his accursed lack of\nself-possession had ruined all. 'The woman was now offended in good\nearnest; he saw it in her face at parting. The fault was admittedly on\nhis side, but what right had she to talk about 'something\nadvantageous'? She would write to him, to be sure; that meant, she\ncould not yet make up her mind whether to grant the money or not. Pluto\ntake the money! Long before sitting down to her glossy note-paper she\nshould have received a letter from _him_.\n\nComposed already. Now he was up in the garret bedroom, scribbling as\nfast as pen could fly over paper. He had been guilty of a mistake--so\nran the epistle; having decided to leave Whitelaw, he ought never to\nhave requested a continuance of the pension. He begged Lady Whitelaw\nwould forgive this thoughtless impropriety; she had made him understand\nthe full extent of his error. Of course he could not accept anything\nmore from her. As for the past, it would be idle for him to attempt an\nexpression of his indebtedness. But for Sir Job's munificence, he must\nnow have been struggling to complete a radically imperfect\neducation,--'instead of going into the world to make a place for myself\namong the scientific investigators of our time'.\n\nOne's claims to respectful treatment must be put forward unmistakably,\nespecially in dealing with such people as Lady Whitelaw. Now, perhaps,\nshe would understand what his reserve concealed. The satisfaction of\ndeclining further assistance was enormous. He read his letter several\ntimes aloud. This was the great style; he could imagine this incident\nforming a landmark in the biography of a notable man. Now for a fair\ncopy, and in a hand, mind you, that gave no hint of his care for\ncaligraphic seemliness: bold, forthright.\n\nThe letter in his pocket, he went downstairs. His mother had been out\nall the morning; now she was just returned, and Godwin saw trouble on\nher forehead. Anxiously she inquired concerning the result of his\ninterview.\n\nNow that it was necessary to make an intelligible report of what had\nhappened, Godwin found his tongue falter. How could he convey to\nanother the intangible sense of wounded dignity which had impelled his\npen? Instead of producing the letter with a flourish, he answered with\naffected carelessness:\n\n'I am to hear in a day or two.'\n\n'Did she seem to take it--in the right way?'\n\n'She evidently thinks of me too much as a schoolboy.'\n\nAnd he began to pace the room. Mrs. Peak sat still, with an air of\nanxious brooding.\n\n'You don't think she will refuse, Godwin?' fell from her presently.\n\nHis hand closed on the letter.\n\n'Why? Well, in that case I should go to London and find some occupation\nas soon as possible. You could still let me have the same money as\nbefore?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nIt was said absently, and did not satisfy Godwin. In the course of the\nconversation it appeared that Mrs. Peak had that morning been to see\nthe legal friend who looked after her small concerns, and though she\nwould not admit that she had any special cause for uneasiness, her son\nrecalled similar occasions when an interview with Mr. Dutch had been\nfollowed by several days' gloom. The truth was that Mrs Peak could not\nlive strictly within the income at her disposal, and on being from time\nto time reminded of this, she was oppressed by passing worry. If Godwin\nand Oliver 'got on well,' things would come all right in the end, but\nin the meantime she could not face additional expenditure. Godwin did\nnot like to be reminded of the razor's edge on which the affairs of the\nhousehold were balanced. At present it brought about a very sudden\nchange in his state of mind; he went upstairs again, and sat with the\nletter before him, sunk in misery. The reaction had given him a\nheadache.\n\nA fortnight, and no word from Lady Whitelaw. But neither was Godwin's\nletter posted.\n\nWas he at liberty to indulge the self-respect which urged him to write?\nIn a moment of heated confidence it was all very well to talk of\n'getting some occupation' in London, but he knew that this might prove\nno easy matter. A year's work at the School of Mines would decidedly\nfacilitate his endeavour; and, seeing that his mother's peace depended\nupon his being speedily self-supporting, was it not a form of\nselfishness to reject help from one who could well afford it? From a\ndistance, he regarded Lady Whitelaw with more charity; a longer talk\nwith her might have led to better mutual apprehension. And, after all,\nit was not she but her husband to whom he would stand indebted. Sir Job\nwas a very kind-hearted old fellow; he had meant thoroughly well. Why,\nclearly, the bestower of this third year's allowance would not be Lady\nWhitelaw at all.\n\nIf it were granted. Godwin began to suffer a troublesome misgiving;\nperchance he had gone too far, and was now, in fact, abandoned to his\nown resources.\n\nThree weeks. Then came the expected letter, and, as he opened it, his\nheart leaped at the sight of a cheque--talisman of unrivalled power\nover the emotions of the moneyless! Lady Whitelaw wrote briefly and\nformally. Having considered Godwin's request, she had no reason for\ndoubting that he would make a good use of the proposed year at the\nSchool of Mines, and accordingly she sent him the sum which Sir Job had\nintended for his final session at Whitelaw College. She wished him all\nbenefit from his studies, and prosperity henceforth.\n\nRejoicing, though shame-smitten, Godwin exhibited this remittance to\nhis mother, from whom it drew a deep sigh of relief. And forthwith he\nsat down to write quite a different letter from that which still lay in\nhis private drawer,--a letter which he strove to make the justification\n(to his own mind) of this descent to humility. At considerable length\nhe dwelt upon the change of tastes of which he had been conscious\nlately, and did not fail to make obvious the superiority of his\nambition to all thought of material advancement. He offered his thanks,\nand promised to give an account of himself (as in duty bound) at the\nclose of the twelvemonths' study he was about to undertake: a letter in\nwhich the discerning would have read much sincerity, and some pathos;\nafter all, not a letter to be ashamed of. Lady Whitelaw would not\nunderstand it; but then, how many people are capable of even faintly\napprehending the phenomena of mental growth?\n\nAnd now to plan seriously his mode of life in London. With Christian\nMoxey he was so slightly acquainted that it was impossible to seek his\nadvice with regard to lodgings; besides, the lodgings must be of a\ncharacter far too modest to come within Mr. Moxey's sphere of\nobservation. Other acquaintance he had none in the capital, so it was\nclear that he must enter boldly upon the unknown world, and find a home\nfor himself as best he might. Mrs. Peak could offer suggestions as to\nlikely localities, and this was of course useful help. In the meantime\n(for it would be waste of money to go up till near the end of the\nholiday season) he made schemes of study and completed his information\nconcerning the School of Mines. So far from lamenting the interruption\nof his promising career at Whitelaw, he persuaded himself that Uncle\nAndrew had in truth done him a very good turn: now at length he was\nfixed in the right course. The only thing he regretted was losing sight\nof his two or three student-friends, especially Earwaker and Buckland\nWarricombe. They, to be sure, would soon guess the reason of his\ndisappearance. Would they join in the laughter certain to be excited by\n'Peak's Dining and Refreshment Rooms'? Probably; how could they help\nit? Earwaker might be superior to a prejudice of that kind; his own\nconnections were of humble standing. But Warricombe must wince and\nshrug his shoulders. Perhaps even some of the Professors would have\ntheir attention directed to the ludicrous mishap: they were gentlemen,\nand, even though they smiled, must certainly sympathise with him.\n\nWait a little. Whitelaw College should yet remember the student who\nseemed to have vanished amid the world's obscure tumult.\n\nResolved that he was about to turn his back on Twybridge for ever, he\nfound the conditions of life there quite supportable through this last\nmonth or two; the family reaped benefit from his improved temper. Even\nto Mr. Cusse he behaved with modified contempt. Oliver was judicious\nenough to suppress his nigger minstrelsy and kindred demonstrations of\nspirit in his brother's presence, and Charlotte, though steadily\nresentful, did her best to avoid conflict.\n\nThrough the Misses Lumb, Godwin's change of purpose had of course\nbecome known to his aunt, who for a time took it ill that these debates\nhad been concealed from her. When Mrs. Peak, in confidence, apprised\nher of the disturbing cause, Miss Cadman's indignation knew no bounds.\nWhat! That low fellow had been allowed to interfere with the progress\nof Godwin Peak's education, and not a protest uttered? He should have\nbeen _forbidden_ to establish himself in Kingsmill! Why had they not\ntaken _her_ into council? She would have faced the man, and have\noverawed him; he should have been made to understand the gross\nselfishness of his behaviour. Never had she heard of such a monstrous\ncase--\n\nGodwin spent much time in quiet examination of the cabinets bequeathed\nto him by Mr. Gunnery. He used a pound or two of Lady Whitelaw's money\nfor the purchase of scientific books, and set to work upon them with\nfreshened zeal. The early morning and late evening were given to\ncountry walks, from which he always returned with brain excited by the\nforecast of great achievements.\n\nWhen the time of his departure approached, he decided to pay a farewell\nvisit to Mr. Moxey. He chose an hour when the family would probably be\ntaking their ease in the garden. Three of the ladies were, in fact,\namusing themselves with croquet, while their father, pipe in mouth,\nbent over a bed of calceolarias.\n\n'What's this that I hear?' exclaimed Mr. Moxey, as he shook hands. 'You\nare not going back to Whitelaw?'\n\nThe story had of course spread among all Twybridge people who knew\nanything of the Peaks, and it was generally felt that some mystery was\ninvolved. Godwin had reasonably feared that his obligations to Sir Job\nWhitelaw must become known; impossible for such a matter to be kept\nsecret; all who took any interest in the young man had long been\nprivately acquainted with the facts of his position. Now that\ndiscussion was rife, it would have been prudent in the Misses Lumb to\ndivulge as much of the truth at they knew, but (in accordance with the\nlaw of natural perversity) they maintained a provoking silence. Hence\nwhispers and suspicious questions, all wide of the mark. No one had as\nyet heard of Andrew Peak, and it seemed but too likely that Lady\nWhitelaw, for some good reason, had declined to discharge the expenses\nof Godwin's last year at the College.\n\nMr. Moxey himself felt that an explanation was desirable, but he\nlistened with his usual friendly air to Godwin's account of the\nmatter--which of course included no mention of Lady Whitelaw.\n\n'Have you friends in London?' he inquired--like everyone else.\n\n'No. Except that your nephew was so kind as to ask me to call on him,\nif ever I happened to be there.'\n\nThere passed over Mr. Moxey's countenance a curious shadow. Godwin\nnoticed it, and at once concluded that the manufacturer condemned\nChristian for undue advances to one below his own station. The result\nof this surmise was of course a sudden coldness on Godwin's part,\nincreased when he found that Mr. Moxey turned to another subject,\nwithout a word about his nephew.\n\nIn less than ten minutes he offered to take leave, and no one urged him\nto stay longer. Mr. Moxey made sober expression of good wishes, and\nhoped he might hear that the removal to London had proved\n'advantageous'. This word sufficed to convert Godwin's irritation into\nwrath; he said an abrupt 'good-evening', raised his hat as awkwardly as\nusual, and stalked away.\n\nA few paces from the garden gate, he encountered Miss Janet Moxey, just\ncoming home from walk or visit. Another grab at his hat, and he would\nhave passed without a word, but the girl stopped him.\n\n'We hear that you are going to London, Mr. Peak.'\n\n'Yes, I am, Miss Moxey.'\n\nShe examined his face, and seemed to hesitate.\n\n'Perhaps you have just been to say good-bye to father?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nJanet paused, looked away, again turned her eyes upon him.\n\n'You have friends there, I hope?' she ventured.\n\n'No, I have none.'\n\n'My cousin--Christian, you remember--would, I am sure, be very glad to\nhelp you in any way.' Her voice sank, and at the same time she coloured\njust perceptibly under Godwin's gaze.\n\n'So he assured me,' was the reply. 'But I must learn to be independent,\nMiss Moxey.'\n\nWhereupon Godwin performed a salute, and marched forward.\n\nHis boxes were packed, and now he had but one more evening in the old\nhome. It was made less pleasant than it might have been by a piece of\ninformation upon which he by chance alighted in a newspaper. The result\nof the Honours examination for the First B.A. at London had just been\nmade known, and in two subjects a high place was assigned to Bruno\nLeathwaite Chilvers--not the first place happily, but it was\ndisagreeable enough.\n\nPooh! what matter? What are academic successes? Ten years hence, which\nname would have wider recognition--Bruno Chilvers or Godwin Peak? He\nlaughed with scornful superiority.\n\nNo one was to accompany him to the station; on that he insisted. He had\ndecided for as early a train as possible, that the dolours of\nleave-taking might be abridged. At a quarter to eight the cab drove up\nto the door. Out with the trunks labelled 'London'!\n\n'Take care of the cabinets!' were his last words to his mother. 'I may\nwant to have them sent before long.'\n\nHe implied, what he had not ventured to say plainly, that he was\nleaving Twybridge for good, and henceforth would not think of it as\nhome. In these moments of parting, he resented the natural feeling\nwhich brought moisture to his eyes. He hardened himself against the\nties of blood, and kept repeating to himself a phrase in which of late\nhe had summed his miseries: 'I was born in exile--born in exile.' Now\nat length had he set forth on a voyage of discovery, to end perchance\nin some unknown land among his spiritual kith and kin.\n\n\n\n\nPart II\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nIn the spring of 1882 Mr. Jarvis Runcorn, editor and co-proprietor of\nthe London _Weekly Post_, was looking about for a young man of\njournalistic promise whom he might associate with himself in the\nconduct of that long established Radical paper. The tale of his years\nwarned him that he could not hope to support much longer a burden which\nnecessarily increased with the growing range and complexity of public\naffairs. Hitherto he had been the autocrat of the office, but competing\nSunday papers exacted an alertness, a versatile vigour, such as only\nyouth can supply; for there was felt to be a danger that the _Weekly\nPost_ might lose its prestige in democratic journalism. Thus on the\nwatch, Mr. Runcorn--a wary man of business, who had gone through many\ntrades before he reached that of weekly literature--took counsel one\nday with a fellow-campaigner, Malkin by name, who owned two or three\ncountry newspapers, and had reaped from them a considerable fortune; in\nconsequence, his attention was directed to one John Earwaker, then\nediting the _Wattleborough Courier_. Mr. Malkin's eldest son had\nrecently stood as Liberal candidate for Wattleborough, and though\ndefeated was loud in his praise of the _Courier_; with its editor he\nhad come to be on terms of intimate friendship. Earwaker was well\nacquainted with journalistic life in the provinces. He sprang from a\nhumble family living at Kingsmill, had studied at Whitelaw College, and\nwas now but nine-and-twenty: the style of his 'leaders' seemed to mark\nhim for a wider sphere of work. It was decided to invite him to London,\nand the young man readily accepted Mr. Runcorn's proposals. A few\nmonths later he exchanged temporary lodgings for chambers in Staple\nInn, where he surrounded himself with plain furniture and many books.\n\nIn personal appearance he had changed a good deal since that prize-day\nat Whitelaw when his success as versifier and essayist foretold a\nliterary career. His figure was no longer ungainly; the big head seemed\nto fit better upon the narrow shoulders. He neither walked with\nextravagant paces, nor waved his arms like a windmill. A sufficiency of\ngood food, and the habit of intercourse with active men; had given him\nan every-day aspect; perhaps the sole peculiarity he retained from\nstudent times was his hollow chuckle of mirth, a laugh which struggled\nvainly for enlargement. He dressed with conventional decency, even\nsubmitting to the chimney-pot hat. His features betrayed connection\nwith a physically coarse stock; but to converse with him was to\ndiscover the man of original vigour and wide intellectual scope. With\nordinary companions, it was a rare thing for him to speak of his\nprofessional interests. But for his position on _The Weekly Post_ it\nwould not have been easy to surmise how he stood with regard to\npolitics, and he appeared to lean as often towards the conservative as\nto the revolutionary view of abstract questions.\n\nThe newspaper left him time for other literary work, and it was known\nto a few people that he wrote with some regularity for reviews, but all\nthe products of his pen were anonymous. A fact which remained his own\nsecret was that he provided for the subsistence of his parents, old\npeople domiciled in a quiet corner of their native Kingsmill. The\nstrict sobriety of life which is indispensable to success in such a\ncareer as this cost him no effort. He smoked moderately, ate and drank\nas little as might be, could keep his health on six hours of sleep, and\nfor an occasional holiday liked to walk his twenty or thirty miles.\nEarwaker was naturally marked for survival among the fittest.\n\nOn an evening of June in the year '84, he was interrupted whilst\nequipping himself for dinner abroad, by a thunderous rat-tat-tat.\n\n'You must wait, my friend, whoever you are,' he murmured placidly, as\nhe began to struggle with the stiff button-holes of his shirt.\n\nThe knock was repeated, and more violently.\n\n'Now there's only one man of my acquaintance who knocks like that,' he\nmused, elaborating the bow of his white tie. 'He, I should imagine, is\nin Brazil; but there's no knowing. Perhaps our office is on\nfire.--Anon, anon!'\n\nHe made haste to don waistcoat and swallow-tail, then crossed his\nsitting-room and flung open the door of the chambers.\n\n'Ha! Then it _is_ you! I was reminded of your patient habits.'\n\nA tall man, in a light overcoat and a straw hat of spacious brim, had\nseized both his hands, with shouts of excited greeting.\n\n'Confound you! Why did you keep me waiting? I thought I had missed you\nfor the evening. How the deuce are you? And why the devil have you left\nme without a line from you for more than six months?'\n\nEarwaker drew aside, and allowed his tumultuous friend to rush into the\nnearest room.\n\n'Why haven't you written?--confound you!' was again vociferated, amid\nbursts of boyish laughter. 'Why hasn't anybody written?'\n\n'If everybody was as well informed of your movements as I, I don't\nwonder,' replied the journalist. 'Since you left Buenos Ayres, I have\nhad two letters, each containing twenty words, which gave me to\nunderstand that no answer could by possibility reach you.'\n\n'Humbug! You could have written to half-a-dozen likely places. Did I\nreally say that? Ha, ha, ha!--Shake hands again, confound you! How do\nyou do? Do I look well? Have I a tropical colour? I say, what a blessed\nthing it was that I got beaten down at Wattleborough! All this time I\nshould have been sitting in the fog at Westminster. What a time I've\nhad! What a time I've had!'\n\nIt was more than twelve months since Malkin's departure from England.\nThough sun and sea had doubtless contributed to his robustness, he must\nalways have been a fair example of the vigorous Briton. His broad\nshoulders, upright bearing, open countenance, and frank resonant voice,\ndeclared a youth passed amid the wholesome conditions which wealth\nalone can command. The hearty extravagance of his friendliness was only\npossible in a man who has never been humiliated by circumstances, never\nrestricted in his natural needs of body and mind. Yet he had more than\nthe heartiness of a contented Englishman. The vivacity which made a\nwhirlwind about him probably indicated some ancestral mingling with the\nblood of a more ardent race. Earwaker examined him with a smile of\npleasure.\n\n'It's unfortunate,' he said, 'that I have to go out to dinner.'\n\n'Dinner! Pooh! we can get dinner anywhere.'\n\n'No doubt, but I am engaged.'\n\n'The devil you are! Who is she? Why didn't you write to tell me?'\n\n'The word has a less specific meaning, my dear fellow,' replied\nEarwaker, laughing. 'Only you of all men would have rushed at the wrong\none. I mean to say--if your excitement can take in so common a\nfact--that I have promised to dine with some people at Notting Hill,\nand mustn't disappoint them.'\n\nMalkin laughed at his mistake, then shouted:\n\n'Notting Hill! Isn't that somewhere near Fulham? We'll take a cab, and\nI can drop you on my way.'\n\n'It wouldn't be on the way at all.'\n\nThe journalist's quiet explanation was cut short by a petulant outcry.\n\n'Oh, very well! Of course if you want to get rid of me! I should have\nthought after sixteen months'--\n\n'Don't be idiotic,' broke in the other. 'There's a strong feminine\nelement in you, Malkin; that's exactly the kind of talk with which\nwomen drive men to frenzy.'\n\n'Feminine element!' shouted the traveller with hot face. 'What do you\nmean? I propose to take a cab with you, and you'--\n\nEarwaker turned away laughing. 'Time and distance are nothing to you,\nand I shall be very glad of your company. Come by all means.'\n\nHis friend was instantly appeased.\n\n'Don't let me make you late, Earwaker. Must we start this moment? Come\nalong, then. Can I carry anything for you? Lord! if you could only see\na tropical forest! How do you get on with old Runcorn? _Write_? What\nthe devil was the use of my writing, when words are powerless to\ndescribe--? What a rum old place this seems, after experiences like\nmine; how the deuce can you live here? I say, I've brought you a ton of\ncuriosities; will make your rooms look like a museum. Confound it! I've\nbroken my shin against the turn in the staircase! Whew! Who are you\ngoing to dine with?--Moxey? Never heard the name.'\n\nIn Holborn a hansom was hailed, and the friends continued their\ndialogue as they drove westward. Having at length effervesced, Malkin\nbegan to exchange question and answer with something of the calm\nneedful for mutual intelligibility.\n\n'And how do you get on with old Runcorn?'\n\n'As well as can be expected where there is not a single subject of\nagreement,' Earwaker replied. 'I have hopes of reducing our\ncirculation.'\n\n'What the deuce do you mean?'\n\n'In other words, of improving the paper. Runcorn is strong on the side\nof blackguardism. We had a great fight the other day over a leader\noffered by Kenyon,--a true effusion of the political gutter-snipe. I\nrefused point-blank to let it go in; Runcorn swore that, if I did not,\n_I_ should go _out_. I offered to retire that moment. \"We must write\nfor our public,\" he bellowed. \"True,\" said I, \"but not necessarily for\nthe basest among them. The standard at the best is low enough.\" \"Do you\ncall yourself a Radical?\" \"Not if this be Radicalism.\" \"You ought to be\non the _Morning_ instead of the _Weekly Post_.\" I had my way, and\nprobably shall end by sending Mr Kenyon back to his tinker's work shop.\nIf not, I must look out for cleaner occupation.'\n\n'Go it, my boy! Go it!' cried Malkin, slapping his companion's knee\nviolently. 'Raise the tone! To the devil with mercenary considerations!\nHelp the proletariat out of its grovelling position.'\n\nThey approached the street where Earwaker had to alight. The other\ndeclared his intention of driving on to Fulham in the hope of finding a\nfriend who lived there.\n\n'But I must see you again. When shall you be home to-night?'\n\n'About half-past eleven, I dare say.'\n\n'Right! If I am free I'll come out to Staple Inn, and we'll talk till\nthree or four.'\n\nThe house at which the journalist presented himself was such as might\nbe inhabited by a small family of easy means. As he was taking off his\novercoat, a door opened and Christian Moxey came forward to greet him.\nThey shook hands like men who stood on friendly, but not exactly on\nintimate, terms.\n\n'Will you come up to the laboratory for a moment?' said Moxey. 'I\nshould like to show you something I have under the microscope.'\n\nThe room he spoke of was at the top of the house; two chambers had been\nmade into one, and the fittings were those required by a student of\nphysical science. Various odours distressed the air. A stranger to the\npursuits represented might have thought that the general disorder and\nencumberment indicated great activity, but the experienced eye\nperceived at once that no methodical work was here in progress.\nMineralogy, botany, biology, physics, and probably many other sciences,\nwere suggested by the specimens and apparatus that lay confusedly on\ntables, shelves, or floor.\n\nMoxey looked very slim and elegant in his evening costume. When he\ntouched any object, his long, translucent fingers seemed soft and\nsensitive as a girl's. He stepped with peculiar lightness, and the\nharmonious notes of his voice were in keeping with these other\ncharacteristics. Ten years had developed in him that graceful languor\nwhich at four-and-twenty was only beginning to get mastery over the\nenergies of a well-built frame.\n\n'This stuff here,' he said, pointing to an open box full of mud, 'is\nsilt from down the Thames. It's positively loaded with\n_diatomaceoe_,--you remember our talking about them when you were last\nhere? I am working at the fabric of the valves. Now, just look!'\n\nEarwaker, with attentive smile, followed the demonstration.\n\n'Peak is busy with them as well,' said Christian, presently. 'Has he\ntold you his theory of their locomotion? Nobody has found out yet how\nthe little beggars move about. Peak has a bright idea.'\n\nThey spent ten minutes in the laboratory, then went downstairs. Two\nother guests had meanwhile arrived, and were conversing with the\nhostess, Miss Moxey. The shy, awkward, hard-featured girl was grown\ninto a woman whose face made such declaration of intellect and\ncharacter that, after the first moment, one became indifferent to its\nlack of feminine beauty. As if with the idea of compensating for\npersonal disadvantages, she was ornately dressed; her abundant tawny\nhair had submitted to much manipulation, and showed the gleam of\njewels; expense and finished craft were manifest in every detail of her\ngarb. Though slightly round-shouldered, her form was well-proportioned\nand suggested natural vigour. Like Christian, she had delicate hands.\n\n'Do you know a distinguished clergyman, named Chilvers?' she asked of\nEarwaker, with a laugh, when he had taken a place by her.\n\n'Chilvers?--Is it Bruno Chilvers, I wonder?'\n\n'That's the name!' exclaimed one of the guests, a young married lady of\neager face and fidgety manners.\n\n'Then I knew him at College, but I had no idea he was become\ndistinguished.'\n\nMiss Moxey again laughed.\n\n'Isn't it amusing, the narrowness of a great clerical reputation? Mrs.\nMorton was astonished that I had never heard his name.'\n\n'Please don't think,' appealed the lady, looking anxiously at Earwaker,\n'that I consider it shameful not to know him. I only happened to\nmention a very ridiculous sermon of his, that was forced upon me by a\ndistressingly orthodox friend of mine. They tell me, he is one of the\nnewest lights of the Church.'\n\nEarwaker listened with amusement, and then related anecdotes of Bruno\nChilvers. Whilst he was talking, the door opened to admit another\narrival, and a servant's voice announced 'Mr. Peak'. Miss Moxey rose,\nand moved a step or two forward; a change was visible on her\ncountenance, which had softened and lightened.\n\n'I am very sorry to be late,' said the new-comer, in a dull and rather\nhusky voice, which made strong contrast with the humorous tones his\nentrance had interrupted.\n\nHe shook hands in silence with the rest of the company, giving merely a\nnod and a smile as reply to some gracious commonplace from Mrs. Morton.\n\n'Has it come to your knowledge,' Earwaker asked of him, 'that Bruno\nChilvers is exciting the orthodox world by his defence of Christianity\nagainst neo-heathenism?'\n\n'Chilvers?--No.'\n\n'Mrs. Morton tells us that all the Church newspapers ring with his\nname.'\n\n'Please don't think,' cried Mrs. Morton, with the same anxious look as\nbefore, 'that I read such papers. We never have such a thing in our\nhouse, Mr. Peak. I have only been told about it.'\n\nPeak smiled gravely, but made no other answer. Then he turned to\nEarwaker.\n\n'Where is he?'\n\n'I can't say. Perhaps Mrs. Morton'--\n\n'They tell me he is somewhere in Norfolk,' replied the lady. 'I forget\nthe town.'\n\nA summons to dinner broke off the conversation. Moxey offered his arm\nto the one lady present as guest, and Earwaker did the same courtesy to\nthe hostess. Mr. Morton, a meditative young man who had been listening\nwith a smile of indifference, sauntered along in the rear with Godwin\nPeak.\n\nAt the dinner-table Peak was taciturn, and seemed to be musing on a\ndisagreeable subject. To remarks, he answered briefly and absently. As\nMoxey, Earwaker, and Mrs. Morton kept up lively general talk, this\nmuteness was not much noticed, but when the ladies had left the room,\nand Peak still frowned over his wineglass, the journalist rebuked him.\n\n'What's the matter with you? Don't depress us.'\n\nThe other laughed impatiently, and emptied his glass.\n\n'Malkin has come back,' pursued Earwaker. 'He burst in upon me, just as\nI was leaving home--as mad as a March hare. You must come and meet him\nsome evening.'\n\n'As you please.'\n\nReturned to the upper room, Peak seated himself in a shadowy corner,\ncrossed his legs, thrust his hands into his pockets, and leaned back to\nregard a picture on the wall opposite. This attitude gave sufficient\nproof of the change that had been wrought in him by the years between\nnineteen and nine-and-twenty; even in a drawing-room, he could take his\nease unconcernedly. His face would have led one to suppose him an older\nman; it was set in an expression of stern, if not morose,\nthoughtfulness.\n\nHe had small, hard lips, indifferent teeth (seldom exhibited), a\nprominent chin, a long neck; his body was of firm, not ungraceful\nbuild. Society's evening uniform does not allow a man much scope in the\nmatter of adornments; it was plain, however, that Godwin no longer\nscorned the tailor and haberdasher. He wore a suit which confidently\nchallenged the criticism of experts, and the silk socks visible above\nhis shoes might have been selected by the most fastidious of worldlings.\n\nWhen he had sat there for some minutes, his eyes happened to stray\ntowards Miss Moxey, who was just then without a companion. Her glance\nanswered to his, and a smile of invitation left him no choice but to\nrise and go to a seat beside her.\n\n'You are meditative this evening,' she said, in a voice subdued below\nits ordinary note.\n\n'Not very fit for society, to tell the truth,' Godwin answered,\ncarelessly. 'One has such moods, you know. But how would you take it\nif, at the last moment, I sent a telegram, \"Please excuse me. Don't\nfeel able to talk\"?'\n\n'You don't suppose I should be offended?'\n\n'Certainly you would.'\n\n'Then you know less of me than I thought.'\n\nHer eyes wandered about the room, their smile betokening an uneasy\nself-consciousness.\n\n'Christian tells me,' she continued, 'that you are going to take your\nholiday in Cornwall.'\n\n'I thought of it. But perhaps I shan't leave town at all. It wouldn't\nbe worth while, if I go abroad at the end of the year.'\n\n'Abroad?' Marcella glanced at him. 'What scheme is that?'\n\n'Haven't I mentioned it? I want to go to South America and the Pacific\nislands. Earwaker has a friend, who has just come back from travel in\nthe tropics; the talk about it has half decided me to leave England. I\nhave been saving money for years to that end.'\n\n'You never spoke of it--to me, Marcella replied, turning a bracelet on\nher wrist. 'Should you go alone?'\n\n'Of course. I couldn't travel in company. You know how impossible it\nwould be for me to put up with the moods and idiosyncrasies of other\nmen.'\n\nThere was a quiet arrogance in his tone. The listener still smiled, but\nher fingers worked nervously.\n\n'You are not so unsocial as you pretend,' she remarked, without looking\nat him.\n\n'Pretend! I make no pretences of any kind,' was his scornful answer.\n\n'You are ungracious this evening.'\n\n'Yes--and can't hide it.'\n\n'Don't try to, I beg. But at least tell me what troubles you.'\n\n'That's impossible,' Peak replied, drily.\n\n'Then friendship goes for nothing,' said Marcella, with a little forced\nlaugh.\n\n'Yes--in all but a very few human concerns. How often could _you_ tell\n_me_ what it is that prevents your taking life cheerfully?'\n\nHe glanced at her, and Marcella's eyes fell; a moment after, there was\na suspicion of colour in her cheek.\n\n'What are you reading?' Peak asked abruptly, but in a voice of more\nconventional note.\n\n'Still Hafiz.'\n\n'I envy your power of abstraction.'\n\n'Yet I hear that you are deeply concerned about the locomotive powers\nof the _diatomaceaoe_?'\n\nTheir eyes met, and they laughed--not very mirthfully.\n\n'It preserves me from worse follies,' said Peak. 'After all, there are\nways more or less dignified of consuming time'--\n\nAs he spoke, his ear caught a familiar name, uttered by Christian\nMoxey, and he turned to listen. Moxey and Earwaker were again talking\nof the Rev. Bruno Chilvers. Straightway disregarding Marcella, Peak\ngave attention to the men's dialogue, and his forehead wrinkled into\nscornful amusement.\n\n'It's very interesting,' he exclaimed, at a moment when there was\nsilence throughout the company, 'to hear that Chilvers is really coming\nto the front. At Whitelaw it used to be prophesied that he would be a\nbishop, and now I suppose he's fairly on the way to that. Shall we\nwrite letters of congratulation to him, Earwaker?'\n\n'A joint epistle, if you like.'\n\nMr. Morton, who had brightened since dinner, began to speak caustically\nof the form of intellect necessary nowadays in a popular clergyman.\n\n'He must write a good deal,' put in Earwaker, 'and that in a style\nwhich would have scandalised the orthodox of the last century.\nRationalised dogma is vastly in demand.'\n\nPeak's voice drew attention.\n\n'Two kinds of books dealing with religion are now greatly popular, and\nwill be for a long time. On the one hand there is that growing body of\npeople who, for whatever reason, tend to agnosticism, but desire to be\nconvinced that agnosticism is respectable; they are eager for\nanti-dogmatic books, written by men of mark. They couldn't endure to be\nclassed with Bradlaugh, but they rank themselves confidently with\nDarwin and Huxley. Arguments matter little or nothing to them. They\ntake their rationalism as they do a fashion in dress, anxious only that\nit shall be \"good form\". Then there's the other lot of people--a much\nlarger class--who won't give up dogma, but have learnt that bishops,\npriests, and deacons no longer hold it with the old rigour, and that\none must be \"broad\"; these are clamorous for treatises which pretend to\nreconcile revelation and science. It's quite pathetic to watch the\nenthusiasm with which they hail any man who distinguishes himself by\nthis kind of apologetic skill, this pious jugglery. Never mind how\nwashy the book from a scientific point of view. Only let it obtain\nvogue, and it will be glorified as the new evangel. The day has gone by\nfor downright assaults on science; to be marketable, you must prove\nthat _The Origin of Species_ was approvingly foreseen in the first\nchapter of Genesis, and that the Apostles' Creed conflicts in no single\npoint with the latest results of biblical criticism. Both classes seek\nto avoid ridicule, and to adapt themselves to a standard of\nrespectability. If Chilvers goes in for the newest apologetics, he is\nbound to be enormously successful. The man has brains, and really there\nare so few such men who still care to go into the Church.'\n\nThere was a murmur of laughing approval. The speaker had worked himself\ninto eloquent nervousness; he leaned forward with his hands straining\ntogether, and the muscles of his face quivering.\n\n'And isn't it surprising,' said Marcella, 'in how short a time this\napologetic attitude has become necessary?'\n\nPeak flashed a triumphant look at her.\n\n'I often rejoice to think of it!' he cried. 'How magnificent it is that\nso many of the solemn jackasses who brayed against Darwin from ten to\ntwenty years ago should live to be regarded as beneath contempt! I say\nit earnestly: this thought is one of the things that make life\ntolerable to me!'\n\n'You have need of charity, friend Peak,' interposed Earwaker. 'This is\nthe spirit of the persecutor.'\n\n'Nothing of the kind! It is the spirit of justified reason. You may say\nthat those people were honestly mistaken;--such honesty is the brand of\na brainless obstructive. _They_ would have persecuted, but too gladly!\nThere were, and are, men who would have committed Darwin to penal\nservitude, if they had had the power. Men like Lyell, who were able to\ndevelop a new convolution in their brains, I respect heartily. I only\nspeak of the squalling mass, the obscene herd of idiot mockers.'\n\n'Who assuredly,' remarked Earwaker, 'feel no shame whatever in the\nretrospect of their idiocy. To convert a _mind_ is a subject for high\nrejoicing; to confute a _temper_ isn't worth the doing.'\n\n'That is philosophy,' said Marcella, 'but I suspect you of often\nfeeling as Mr. Peak does. I am sure _I_ do.'\n\nPeak, meeting an amused glance from the journalist, left his seat and\ntook up a volume that lay on one of the tables. It was easy to see that\nhis hands shook, and that there was perspiration on his forehead. With\npleasant tact, Moxey struck into a new subject, and for the next\nquarter of an hour Peak sat apart in the same attitude as before his\noutburst of satire and invective. Then he advanced to Miss Moxey again,\nfor the purpose of taking leave. This was the signal for Earwaker's\nrising, and in a few minutes both men had left the house.\n\n'I'll go by train with you,' said Earwaker, as they walked away.\n'Farringdon Street will suit me well enough.'\n\nPeak vouchsafed no reply, but, when they had proceeded a little\ndistance, he exclaimed harshly:\n\n'I hate emancipated women!'\n\nHis companion stopped and laughed loudly.\n\n'Yes, I hate emancipated women,' the other repeated, with deliberation.\n'Women ought neither to be enlightened nor dogmatic. They ought to be\nsexual.'\n\n'That's unusual brutality on your part.'\n\n'Well, you know what I mean.'\n\n'I know what you think you mean,' said Earwaker. 'But the woman who is\nneither enlightened nor dogmatic is only too common in society. They\nare fools, and troublesome fools.'\n\nPeak again kept silence.\n\n'The emancipated woman,' pursued his friend, 'needn't be a Miss Moxey,\nnor yet a Mrs. Morton.'\n\n'Miss Moxey is intolerable,' said Peak. 'I can't quite say why I\ndislike her so, but she grows more antipathetic to me the better I know\nher. She has not a single feminine charm--not one. I often feel very\nsorry for her, but dislike her all the same.'\n\n'Sorry for her,' mused Earwaker. 'Yes, so do I. I can't like her\neither. She is certainly an incomplete woman. But her mind is of no low\norder. I had rather talk with her than with one of the imbecile\nprettinesses. I half believe you have a sneaking sympathy with the men\nwho can't stand education in a wife.'\n\n'It's possible. In some moods.'\n\n'In no mood can I conceive such a prejudice. I have no great attraction\nto women of any kind, but the uneducated woman I detest.'\n\n'Well, so do I,' muttered Peak. 'Do you know what?' he added, abruptly.\n'I shall be off to the Pacific. Yes, I shall go this next winter. My\nmind is made up.'\n\n'I shan't try to dissuade you, old fellow, though I had rather have you\nin sight. Come and see Malkin. I'll drop you a note with an\nappointment.'\n\n'Do.'\n\nThey soon reached the station, and exchanged but few more words before\nEarwaker's leaving the train at Farringdon Street. Peak pursued his\njourney towards the south-east of London.\n\nOn reaching home, the journalist flung aside his foolish coat of\nceremony, indued a comfortable jacket, lit a pipe with long stem, and\nbegan to glance over an evening newspaper. He had not long reposed in\nhis arm-chair when the familiar appeal thundered from without. Malkin\nonce more shook his hand effusively.\n\n'Had my journey to Fulham for nothing. Didn't matter; I ran over to\nPutney and looked up my old landlady. The rooms are occupied by a\nmarried couple, but I think we shall succeed in persuading them to make\nway for me. I promised to find them lodgings every bit as good in two\ndays' time.'\n\n'If that is so easy, why not take the new quarters yourself?'\n\n'Why, to tell you the truth, I didn't think of it!--Oh, I had rather\nhave the old crib; I can do as I like there, you know. Confound it! Now\nI shall have to spend all to-morrow lodging-hunting for other people.\nCouldn't I pay a man to do it? Some confidential agent--private\npolice--you know what I mean?'\n\n'A man of any delicacy,' replied Earwaker, with grave countenance,\n'would feel bound by such a promise to personal exertion.'\n\n'Right; quite right! I didn't mean it; of course I shall hunt\nconscientiously. Oh, I say; I have brought over a couple of\narmadilloes. Would you like one?'\n\n'Stuffed, do you mean?'\n\n'Pooh! Alive, man, alive! They only need a little care. I should think\nyou might keep the creature in your kitchen; they become quite\naffectionate.'\n\nThe offer was unhesitatingly declined, and Malkin looked hurt. There\nneeded a good deal of genial explanation before Earwaker could restore\nhim to his sprightly mood.\n\n'Where have you been dining?' cried the traveller. 'Moxey's--ah, I\nremember. But who _is_ Moxey? A new acquaintance, eh?'\n\n'Yes; I have known him about six months. Got to know him through Peak.'\n\n'Peak? Peak? What, the fellow you once told me about--who disappeared\nfrom Whitelaw because of his uncle, the cat's-meat man?'\n\n'The man's-meat man, rather.'\n\n'Yes, yes--the eating-house; I remember. You have met him again? Why on\nearth didn't you tell me in your letters? What became of him? Tell me\nthe story.'\n\n'Certainly, if you will cease to shake down plaster from the\nceiling.--We met in a restaurant (appropriate scene), happening to sit\nat the same table. Whilst eating, we stared at each other fitfully.\n\"I'll be hanged if that isn't Peak,\" I kept saying to myself. And at\nthe same moment we opened our lips to question each other.'\n\n'Just the same thing happened once to a friend of mine and a friend of\nhis. But it was on board ship, and both were devilish seasick.\nWalker--you remember my friend Walker?--tells the story in a\nside-splitting way. I wonder what has become of Walker? The last time I\nmet him he was travelling agent for a menagerie--a most interesting\nfellow, Walker.--But I beg your pardon. Go on, old fellow!'\n\n'Well, after that we at once saw a good deal of each other. He has been\nworking for years at a chemical factory down on the river; Moxey used\nto be there, and got him the place.'\n\n'Moxey?--Oh yes, the man you dined with. You must remember that these\nare new names to me. I must know all these new people, I say. You don't\nmind?'\n\n'You shall be presented to the whole multitude, as soon as you like.\nPeak wants to see you. He thinks of an excursion like this last of\nyours.'\n\n'He does? By Jove, we'll go together! I have always wanted a travelling\ncompanion. We'll start as soon as ever he likes!--well, in a month or\ntwo. I must just have time to look round. Oh, I haven't done with the\ntropics yet! I must tell him of a rattling good insect-powder I have\ninvented; I think of patenting it. I say, how does one get a patent?\nQuite a simple matter, I suppose?'\n\n'Oh, always has been. The simplest and least worrying of all business\nenterprises.'\n\n'What? Eh? That smile of yours means mischief.'\n\nIn a quarter of an hour they had got back to the subject of Peak's\nhistory.\n\n'And did he really run away because of the eating-house?' Malkin\ninquired.\n\n'I shall never venture to ask, and it's not very likely he will admit\nit. It was some time before he cared to talk much of Whitelaw.'\n\n'But what is he doing? You used to think he would come out strong,\ndidn't you? Has he written anything?'\n\n'A few things in _The Liberator_, five or six years ago.'\n\n'What, the atheistic paper?'\n\n'Yes. But he's ashamed of it now. That belongs to a bygone stage of\ndevelopment.'\n\n'Turned orthodox?'\n\nEarwaker laughed.\n\n'I only mean that he is ashamed of the connection with street-corner\nrationalism.'\n\n'Quite right. Devilish low, that kind of thing. But I went in for it\nmyself once. Did I ever tell you that I debated with a parson on\nMile-end Waste? Fact! That was in my hot-headed days. A crowd of\ncoster-mongers applauded me in the most flattering way.--I say,\nEarwaker, you haven't any whisky?'\n\n'Forgive me; your conversation makes me forget hospitality. Shall I\nmake hot water? I have a spirit-kettle.'\n\n'Cold for me. I get in such a deuced perspiration when I begin to\ntalk.--Try this tobacco; the last of half a hundred-weight I took in at\nBahia.'\n\nThe traveller refreshed himself with a full tumbler, and resumed the\nconversation cheerily.\n\n'Has he just been wasting his time, then, all these years?'\n\n'He goes in for science--laboratory work, evolutionary speculations. Of\ncourse I can't judge his progress in such matters; but Moxey, a clever\nman in the same line, thinks very highly of him.'\n\n'Just the fellow to travel with. I want to get hold of some solid\nscientific ideas, but I haven't the patience to work steadily. A\nconfounded fault of mine, you know, Earwaker,--want of patience. You\nmust have noticed it?'\n\n'Oh--well, now and then, perhaps.'\n\n'Yes, yes; but of course I know myself better. And now tell me about\nMoxey. A married man, of course?'\n\n'No, lives with a sister.'\n\n'Unmarried sister?--Brains?'\n\n'Pretty well supplied with that commodity.'\n\n'You must introduce me to her. I do like women with brains.--\n\n'Orthodox or enlightened?'\n\n'Bitterly enlightened.'\n\n'Really? Magnificent! Oh, I must know her. Nothing like an emancipated\nwoman! How any man can marry the ordinary female passes my\nunderstanding. What do _you_ think?'\n\n'My opinions are in suspense; not yet precipitated, as Peak might say.'\n\nOne o'clock sounded from neighbouring churches, but Malkin was wide\nawake as ever. He entered upon a detailed narrative of his travels,\ndelightful to listen to, so oddly blended were the strains of conscious\nand unconscious humour which marked his personality. Two o'clock; three\no'clock;--he would have talked till breakfast-time, but at last\nEarwaker declared that the hour had come for sleep. As Malkin had taken\na room at the Inns of Court Hotel, it was easy for him to repair to his\nquarters. The last his friend heard of him was an unexplained laugh,\nechoing far down the staircase.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nPeak's destination was Peckham Rye. On quitting the railway, he had a\nwalk of some ten minutes along a road which smelt of new bricks and\nstucco heated by the summer sun; an obscure passage led him into a\nstreet partly of dwelling-houses, partly of shops, the latter closed.\nHe paused at the side door of one over which the street lamp dimly\nrevealed--'Button, Herbalist'.\n\nHis latch-key admitted him to total darkness, but he moved forward with\nthe confidence of long use. He softly ascended two flights of stairs,\nopened a door, struck a match, and found himself in a comfortable\nsitting-room, soon illumined by a reading-lamp. The atmosphere, as\nthroughout the house, was strongly redolent of dried simples. Anyone\nacquainted with the characteristics of furnished lodgings must have\nsurmised that Peak dwelt here among his own moveables, and was indebted\nto the occupier of the premises for bare walls alone; the tables and\nchairs, though plain enough, were such as civilisation permits; and\nthough there were no pictures, sundry ornaments here and there made\nstrong denial of lodging-house affinity. It was at once laboratory,\nstudy, and dwelling-room. Two large cabinets, something the worse for\ntransportation, alone formed a link between this abode and the old home\nat Twybridge. Books were not numerous, and a good microscope seemed to\nbe the only scientific instrument of much importance. On door-pegs hung\na knapsack, a botanist's vasculum, and a geologist's wallet.\n\nA round table was spread with the materials of supper, and here again\nan experienced lodger must have bestowed contemplative scrutiny, for no\nhand of common landlady declared itself in the arrangement. The cloth\nwas spotless, the utensils tasteful and carefully disposed. In a bowl\nlay an appetising salad, ready for mingling; a fragment of Camembert\ncheese was relieved upon a setting of green leafage; a bottle of ale,\nwith adjacent corkscrew, stood beside the plate; the very loaf seemed\nto come from no ordinary baker's, or was made to look better than its\nkin by the fringed white cloth in which it nestled.\n\nThe custom of four years had accustomed Peak to take these things as a\nmatter of course, yet he would readily have admitted that they were\nextraordinary enough. Indeed, he even now occasionally contrasted this\nstate of comfort with the hateful experiences of his first six years in\nLondon. The subject of lodgings was one of those on which (often\nintemperate of speech) he spoke least temperately. For six years he had\nshifted from quarter to quarter, from house to house, driven away each\ntime by the hateful contact of vulgarity in every form,--by foulness\nand dishonesty, by lying, slandering, quarrelling, by drunkenness, by\nbrutal vice,--by all abominations that distinguish the lodging-letter\nof the metropolis. Obliged to practise extreme economy, he could not\ntake refuge among self-respecting people, or at all events had no luck\nin endeavouring to find such among the poorer working-class. To a man\nof Godwin's idiosyncrasy the London poor were of necessity abominable,\nand it anguished him to be forced to live among them.\n\nRescue came at last, and in a very unexpected way. Resident in the more\nopen part of Bermondsey (winter mornings made a long journey to\nRotherhithe intolerable), he happened to walk one day as far as Peckham\nRye, and was there attracted by the shop window of a herbalist. He\nentered to make a purchase, and got into conversation with Mr. Button,\na middle-aged man of bright intelligence and more reading than could be\nexpected. The herbalist led his customer to an upper room, in which\nwere stored sundry curiosities, and happened casually to say that he\nwas desirous of finding a lodger for two superfluous chambers. Peak's\ninquiries led to his seeing Mrs. Button, whom he found to be a\nFrenchwoman of very pleasing appearance; she spoke fluent\nFrench-English, anything but disagreeable to an ear constantly\ntormented by the London vernacular. After short reflection he decided\nto take and furnish the rooms. It proved a most fortunate step, for he\nlived (after the outlay for furniture) at much less expense than\ntheretofore, and in comparative luxury. Cleanliness, neatness, good\ntaste by no means exhausted Mrs. Button's virtues; her cooking seemed\nto the lodger of incredible perfection, and the infinite goodwill with\nwhich he was tended made strange contrast with the base usage he had\ncommonly experienced.\n\nIn these ten years he had paid but four visits to Twybridge, each of\nbrief duration. Naturally there were changes among his kinsfolk:\nCharlotte, after an engagement which prolonged itself to the fifth\ntwelvemonth, had become Mrs. Cusse, and her husband now had a draper's\nshop of his own, with two children already born into the world of\ndraperdom. Oliver, twice fruitlessly affianced, had at length (when\nsix-and-twenty) wedded a young person whom his mother and his aunt both\nregarded as a most undesirable connection, the daughter (aged\nthirty-two) of a man who was drinking himself to death on such money as\nhe could earn by casual reporting for a Twybridge newspaper. Mrs. Peak\nthe elder now abode with her sister at the millinery shop, and saw\nlittle of her two married children. With Oliver and Charlotte their\nbrother had no sympathy, and affected none; he never wrote to them, nor\nthey to him; but years had strengthened his regard for his mother, and\nwith her he had fairly regular correspondence. Gladly he would have\nseen her more often, but the air of shopkeeping he was compelled to\nbreathe when he visited Twybridge nauseated and repelled him. He\nrecognised the suitability both of Oliver and Charlotte for the\npositions to which life had consigned them--they suffered from no\nprofitless aspiration; but it seemed to him a just cause of quarrel\nwith fate that his kindred should thus have relapsed, instead of\nbettering the rank their father had bequeathed to them. He would not\navow to such friends as Moxey and Earwaker the social standing of his\nonly recognised relatives.\n\nAs for the unrecognised, he had long ago heard with some satisfaction\nthat Andrew Peak, having ultimately failed in his Kingsmill venture,\nreturned to London. Encounter with the fatal Andrew had been spared him\never since that decisive day when Master Jowey Peak recited from\nColeridge and displayed his etymological genius.\n\nFor himself, he had earned daily bread, and something more; he had\nstudied in desultory fashion; he had seen a good deal of the British\nIsles and had visited Paris. The result of it all was gnawing\ndiscontent, intervals of furious revolt, periods of black despair.\n\nHe had achieved nothing, and he was alone.\n\nYoung still, to be sure; at twenty-nine it is too early to abandon\nambitions which are supported by force of brain and of will. But\ncircumstances must needs help if the desires of his soul were to be\nattained. On first coming to London, received with all friendliness by\nChristian Moxey, he had imagined that it only depended upon himself to\nfind admission before long to congenial society--by which he then\nunderstood the companionship of intelligent and aspiring young men.\nChristian, however, had himself no such circle, and knew that the\nawkward lad from Twybridge could not associate with the one or two\nwealthy families to which he could have presented him. The School of\nMines was only technically useful; it helped Godwin to get his place\nwith Bates & Sons, but supplied no friendships. In the third year,\nMoxey inherited means and left the chemical works for continental\ntravel.\n\nBy tormenting attraction Godwin was often led to walk in the wealthy\ndistricts of London. Why was no one of these doors open to him? There\nwere his equals; not in the mean streets where he dwelt. There were the\nmen of culture and capacity, the women of exquisite person and exalted\nmind. Was he the inferior of such people? By heaven, no!\n\nHe chanced once to be in Hyde Park on the occasion of some public\nceremony, and was brought to pause at the edge of a gaping plebeian\ncrowd, drawn up to witness the passing of aristocratic vehicles. Close\nin front of him an open carriage came to a stop; in it sat, or rather\nreclined, two ladies, old and young. Upon this picture Godwin fixed his\neyes with the intensity of fascination; his memory never lost the\nimpress of these ladies' faces. Nothing very noteworthy about them; but\nto Godwin they conveyed a passionate perception of all that is implied\nin social superiority. Here he stood, one of the multitude, of the\nherd; shoulder to shoulder with boors and pick-pockets; and within\nreach of his hand reposed those two ladies, in Olympian calm, seeming\nunaware even of the existence of the throng. Now they exchanged a word;\nnow they smiled to each other. How delicate was the moving of their\nlips! How fine must be their enunciation! On the box sat an old\ncoachman and a young footman; they too were splendidly impassive,\nscornful of the multitudinous gaze.--The block was relieved, and on the\ncarriage rolled.\n\nThey were his equals, those ladies, merely his equals. With such as\nthey he should by right of nature associate.\n\nIn his rebellion, he could not hate them. He hated the malodorous\nrabble who stared insolently at them and who envied their immeasurable\nremoteness. Of mere wealth he thought not; might he only be recognised\nby the gentle of birth and breeding for what he really was, and be\nrescued from the promiscuity of the vulgar!\n\nYet at this time he was drawn into connection with the movement of\npopular Radicalism which revolts against religious respectability.\nInherited antipathy to all conventional forms of faith outweighed his\nother prejudices so far as to induce him to write savage papers for\n_The Liberator_. Personal contact with artisan freethinkers was\ndisgusting to him. From the meeting of emancipated workmen he went away\nwith scorn and detestation in his heart; but in the quiet of his\nlodgings he could sit down to aid their propaganda. One explanation of\nthis inconsistency lay in the fact that no other channel was open to\nhis literary impulses. Pure science could not serve him, for he had no\noriginal results to announce. Pure literature seemed beyond his scope,\nyet he was constantly endeavouring to express himself. He burned with\nthe desire of fame, and saw no hope of achieving it save as an author.\n_The Liberator_ would serve him as a first step. In time he might get\nfoothold in the monthly reviews, and see his name side by side with\nthose of the leaders of thought.\n\nOccasions, of course, offered when he might have extended his\nacquaintance, but they were never of a kind that he cared to use; at\nbest they would only have admitted him to the homes of decent,\nsemi-educated families, and for such society he was altogether\nunfitted. The licence of the streets but seldom allured him. After his\ntwenty-fourth year he was proof against the decoys of venal pleasure,\nand lived a life of asceticism exceedingly rare in young and lonely\nmen. When Christian Moxey returned to London and took the house at\nNotting Hill, which he henceforth occupied together with his sister, a\npossibility of social intercourse at length appeared. Indeed it was a\nsubstantial gain to sit from time to time at a civilised table, and to\nconverse amid graceful surroundings with people who at all events\nfollowed the intellectual current of the day. Careless hitherto of his\npersonal appearance, he now cultivated an elegance of attire in\nconformity with his aristocratic instincts, and this habit became\nfixed. When next he visited Twybridge, the change in his appearance was\ngenerally remarked. Mrs. Peak naturally understood it as a significant\nresult of his intercourse with Miss Moxey, of whom, as it seemed to\nher, he spoke with singular reticence.\n\nBut Marcella had no charm for Godwin's imagination, notwithstanding\nthat he presently suspected a warmth of interest on her side which he\nwas far from consciously encouraging. Nor did he find among his friends\nany man or woman for whose acquaintance he greatly cared. The Moxeys\nhad a very small circle, consisting chiefly of intellectual inferiors.\nChristian was too indolent to make a figure in society, and his sister\nsuffered from peculiarities of mind and temperament which made it as\ndifficult for her as for Peak himself to form intimate friendships.\n\nWhen chance encounter brought him into connection with Earwaker, the\nrevival of bygone things was at first doubtfully pleasant. Earwaker\nhimself, remarkably developed and become a very interesting man, was as\nwelcome an associate as he could have found, but it cost him some\neffort to dismiss the thought of Andrew Peak's eating-house, and to\naccept the friendly tact with which the journalist avoided all hint of\nunpleasant memories. That Earwaker should refrain from a single\nquestion concerning that abrupt disappearance, nearly ten years ago,\nsufficiently declared his knowledge of the unspeakable cause, a\nreflection which often made Godwin writhe. However, this difficulty was\novercome, and the two met very frequently. For several weeks Godwin\nenjoyed better spirits than he had known since the first excitement of\nhis life in London faded away.\n\nOne result was easily foreseen. His mind grew busy with literary\nprojects, many that he had long contemplated and some that were new.\nOnce more he aimed at contributing to the 'advanced' reviews, and\nsketched out several papers of sociological tenor. None of these were\nwritten. As soon as he sat down to deliberate composition, a sense of\nhis deficiencies embarrassed him. Godwin's self-confidence had nothing\nin common with the conceit which rests on imaginary strength. Power\nthere was in him; of that he could not but be conscious: its true\ndirection he had not yet learned. Defect of knowledge, lack of\npen-practice, confusion and contradictoriness of aims, instability of\nconviction,--these faults he recognised in himself at every moment of\ninward scrutiny.\n\nOn his table this evening lay a library volume which he had of late\nbeen reading, a book which had sprung into enormous popularity. It was\ncalled _Spiritual Aspects of Evolution_, and undertook, with confidence\ncharacteristic of its kind, to reconcile the latest results of science\nwith the dogmas of Oriental religion. This work was in his mind when he\nspoke so vehemently at Moxey's; already he had trembled with an impulse\nto write something on the subject, and during his journey home a\npossible essay had begun to shape itself. Late as was the hour he could\nnot prepare for sleep. His brain throbbed with a congestion of thought;\nhe struggled to make clear the lines on which his satire might direct\nitself. By two o'clock he had flung down on paper a conglomerate of\nburning ideas, and thus relieved he at length went to bed.\n\nTwo days later came a note from Staple Inn, inviting him to meet Malkin\nthe next evening. By this time he had made a beginning of his critical\nessay, and the exordium so far satisfied him that he was tempted to\ntake it for Earwaker's judgment. But no; better his friend should see\nthe thing when it was complete.\n\nAbout eight o'clock he reached the journalist's chambers. Malkin had\nnot yet arrived. Peak amused himself with examining certain tropical\nproducts which the traveller had recently cast pell-mell into his\nfriend's sitting-room. Then sounded a knock at the door, but it was not\nsuch as would have heralded the expected man.\n\n'A telegram,' observed Earwaker, and went to take it in.\n\nHe returned with hoarse sounds of mirth.\n\n'Our friend excuses himself. Read this characteristic despatch.'\n\nPeak saw with surprise that the telegram far exceeded familiar\ndimensions. 'Unspeakably grieved,' it began. 'Cannot possibly with you.\nAt moment's notice undertaken escort two poor girls Rouen. Not even\ntime look in apologise. Go via Dieppe and leave Victoria few minutes.\nHope be back Thursday. Express sincerest regret Mr. Peak. Lament\nappearance discourtesy. Will apologise personally. Common humanity\nconstrains go Rouen. Will explain Thursday. No time add another word.\nRush tickets train.'\n\n'There you have the man!' cried Earwaker. 'How do you class such a mind\nas that? Ten to one this is some Quixotic obligation he has laid upon\nhimself, and probably he has gone without even a handbag.'\n\n'Vocally delivered,' said Peak, 'this would represent a certain stage\nof drunkenness. I suppose it isn't open to such an explanation?'\n\n'Malkin never was intoxicated, save with his own vivacity.'\n\nThey discussed the singular being with good-natured mirth, then turned\nby degrees to other topics.\n\n'I have just come across a passage that will delight you,' said\nEarwaker, taking up a book. 'Perhaps you know it.'\n\nHe read from Sir Thomas Brown's _Pscudodoxia Epidemica_. '\"Men's names\nshould not only distinguish them. A man should be something that all\nmen are not, and individual in somewhat beside his proper name. Thus,\nwhile it exceeds not the bound of reason and modesty, we cannot condemn\nsingularity. _Nos numerus sumus_ is the motto of the multitude, and for\nthat reason are they fools.\"'\n\nPeak laughed his approval.\n\n'It astonishes me,' he said, lighting his pipe, 'that you can go on\nwriting for this Sunday rag, when you have just as little sympathy with\nits aims as I have. Do get into some less offensive connection.'\n\n'What paper would you recommend?' asked the other, with his significant\nsmile.\n\n'Why need you journalise at all?'\n\n'On the whole, I like it. And remember, to admit that the multitude are\nfools is not the same thing as to deny the possibility of progress.'\n\n'Do you really believe yourself a democrat, Earwaker?'\n\n'M--m--m! Well, yes, I believe the democratic spirit is stronger in me\nthan any other.'\n\nPeak mused for a minute, then suddenly looked up.\n\n'And what am I?'\n\n'I am glad nothing much depends on my successfully defining you.'\n\nThey laughed together.\n\n'I suppose,' said Godwin, 'you can't call a man a democrat who\nrecognises in his heart and soul a true distinction of social classes.\nSocial, mark. The division I instinctively support is by no means\nintellectual. The well-born fool is very often more sure of my respect\nthan the working man who struggles to a fair measure of education.'\n\nEarwaker would have liked to comment on this with remarks personal to\nthe speaker, but he feared to do so. His silence, however, was eloquent\nto Peak, who resumed brusquely.\n\n'I am not myself well-born,--though if my parents could have come into\nwealth early in their lives, perhaps I might reasonably have called\nmyself so. All sorts of arguments can be brought against my prejudice,\nbut the prejudice is ineradicable. I respect hereditary social\nstanding, independently of the individual's qualities. There's nothing\nof the flunkey in this, or I greatly deceive myself. Birth in a sphere\nof refinement is desirable and respectable; it saves one, absolutely,\nfrom many forms of coarseness. The masses are not only fools, but very\nnear the brutes. Yes, they can send forth fine individuals--but remain\nbase. I don't deny the possibility of social advance; I only say that\nat present the lower classes are always disagreeable, often repulsive,\nsometimes hateful.'\n\n'I could apply that to the classes above them.'\n\n'Well, I can't. But I am quite ready to admit that there are all sorts\nof inconsistencies in me. Now, the other day I was reading Burns, and I\ncouldn't describe what exaltation all at once possessed me in the\nthought that a ploughman had so glorified a servant-girl that together\nthey shine in the highest heaven, far above all the monarchs of earth.\nThis came upon me with a rush--a very rare emotion. Wasn't that\ndemocratic?'\n\nHe inquired dubiously, and Earwaker for a moment had no reply but his\nfamiliar 'M--m--m!'\n\n'No, it was not democratic,' the journalist decided at length; 'it was\npride of intellect.'\n\n'Think so? Then look here. If it happens that a whining wretch stops me\nin the street to beg, what do you suppose is my feeling? I am ashamed\nin the sense of my own prosperity. I can't look him in the face. If I\nyielded to my natural impulse, I should cry out, \"Strike me! spit at\nme! show you hate me!--anything but that terrible humiliation of\nyourself before me!\" That's how I feel. The abasement of which _he_\nisn't sensible affects _me_ on his behalf. I give money with what\ndelicacy I can. If I am obliged to refuse, I mutter apologies and hurry\naway with burning cheeks. What does that mean?'\n\nEarwaker regarded him curiously.\n\n'That is mere fineness of humanity.'\n\n'Perhaps moral weakness?'\n\n'I don't care for the scalpel of the pessimist. Let us give it the\nbetter name.'\n\nPeak had never been so communicative. His progress in composition these\nlast evenings seemed to have raised his spirits and spurred the\nactivity of his mind. With a look of pleasure he pursued his\nself-analysis.\n\n'Special antipathies--sometimes explicable enough--influence me very\nwidely. Now, I by no means hate all orders of uneducated people. A\nhedger, a fisherman, a country mason,--people of that kind I rather\nlike to talk with. I could live a good deal with them. But the London\nvulgar I abominate, root and branch. The mere sound of their voices\nnauseates me; their vilely grotesque accent and pronunciation--bah! I\ncould write a paper to show that they are essentially the basest of\nEnglish mortals. Unhappily, I know so much about them. If I saw the\nprobability of my dying in a London lodging-house, I would go out into\nthe sweet-scented fields and there kill myself.'\n\nEarwaker understood much by this avowal, and wondered whether his\nfriend desired him so to do.\n\n'Well, I can't say that I have any affection for the race,' he replied.\n'I certainly believe that, socially and politically, there is less hope\nof them than of the lower orders in any other part of England.'\n\n'They are damned by the beastly conditions of their life!' cried\nGodwin, excitedly. 'I don't mean only the slum-denizens. All, all\nHammersmith as much as St. George's-in-the-East. I must write about\nthis; I must indeed.'\n\n'Do by all means. Nothing would benefit you more than to get your soul\ninto print.'\n\nPeak delayed a little, then:\n\n'Well, I am doing something at last.'\n\nAnd he gave an account of his projected essay. By this time his hands\ntrembled with nervous agitation, and occasionally a dryness of the\npalate half choked his voice.\n\n'This may do very well,' opined Earwaker. 'I suppose you will try _The\nCritical_?'\n\n'Yes. But have I any chance? Can a perfectly unknown man hope to get\nin?'\n\nThey debated this aspect of the matter. Seeing Peak had laid down his\npipe, the journalist offered him tobacco.\n\n'Thanks; I can't smoke just yet. It's my misfortune that I can't talk\nearnestly without throwing my body into disorder.'\n\n'How stolid I am in comparison!' said Earwaker.\n\n'That book of M'Naughten's,' resumed the other, going back to his\nsubject. 'I suppose the clergy accept it?'\n\n'Largely, I believe.'\n\nPeak mused.\n\n'Now, if I were a clergyman'--\n\nBut his eye met Earwaker's, and they broke into laughter.\n\n'Why not?' pursued Godwin. 'Did I ever tell you that my people\noriginally wished to make a parson of me? Of course I resisted tooth\nand nail, but it seems to me now that I was rather foolish in doing so.\nI wish I _had_ been a parson. In many ways the position would have\nsuited me very well.'\n\n'M--m--m!'\n\n'I am quite serious. Well, if I were so placed, I should preach Church\ndogma, pure and simple. I would have nothing to do with these\nreconciliations. I would stand firm as Jeremy Taylor; and in\nconsequence should have an immense and enthusiastic congregation.'\n\n'I daresay.'\n\n'Depend upon it, let the dogmas do what they still can. There's a vast\npolice force in them, at all events. A man may very strongly defend\nhimself for preaching them.'\n\nThe pursuit of this argument led Earwaker to ask:\n\n'What proportion of the clergy can still take that standing in stolid\nconscientiousness?'\n\n'What proportion are convinced that it is untenable?' returned Peak.\n\n'Many wilfully shut their eyes to the truth.'\n\n'No, they don't shut their eyes!' cried Godwin. 'They merely lower a\nnictitating membrane which permits them to gaze at light without\nfeeling its full impact.'\n\n'I recommend you to bring that into your paper,' said the journalist,\nwith his deep chuckle.\n\nAn hour later they were conversing with no less animation, but the talk\nwas not so critical. Christian Moxey had come up as a topic, and\nEarwaker was saying that he found it difficult to divine the man's\npersonality.\n\n'You won't easily do that,' replied Peak, 'until you know more of his\nstory. I can't see that I am bound to secrecy--at all events with you.\nPoor Moxey imagines that he is in love, and the fancy has lasted about\nten years.\n\n'Ten years?'\n\n'When I first knew him he was paying obvious attentions to a rather\nplain cousin down at Twybridge. Why, I don't know, for he certainly was\ndevoted to a girl here in London. All he has confessed to me is that he\nhad given up hopes of her, but that a letter of some sort or other\nrevived them, and he hastened back to town. He might as well have\nstayed away; the girl very soon married another man. Less than a year\nlater she had bitterly repented this, and in some way or other she\nallowed Moxey to know it. Since then they have been Platonic\nlovers--nothing more, I am convinced. They see each other about once in\nsix months, and presumably live on a hope that the obnoxious husband\nmay decease. I only know the woman as \"Constance\"; never saw her.'\n\n'So that's Moxey? I begin to understand better.'\n\n'Admirable fellow, but deplorably weak. I have an affection for him,\nand have had from our first meeting.'\n\n'Women!' mused Earwaker, and shook his head.\n\n'You despise them?'\n\n'On the whole, I'm afraid so.'\n\n'Yes, but _what_ women?' cried the other with impatience. 'It would be\njust as reasonable to say that you despise men. Can't you see that?'\n\n'I doubt it.'\n\n'Now look here; the stock objections to women are traditional. They\ntake no account of the vast change that is coming about. Because women\nwere once empty-headed, it is assumed they are all still so _en masse_.\nThe defect of the female mind? It is my belief that this is nothing\nmore nor less than the defect of the uneducated human mind. I believe\nmost men among the brutally ignorant exhibit the very faults which are\ncried out upon as exclusively feminine. A woman has hitherto been an\nignorant human being; that explains everything.'\n\n'Not everything; something, perhaps. Remember your evolutionism. The\npreservation of the race demands in women many kinds of irrationality,\nof obstinate instinct, which enrage a reasoning man. Don't suppose I\nspeak theoretically. Four or five years ago I had really made up my\nmind to marry; I wasted much valuable time among women and girls, of\nanything but low social standing. But my passions were choked by my\nlogical faculty. I foresaw a terrible possibility--that I might beat my\nwife. One thing I learned with certainty was that the woman, _qua_\nwoman, hates abstract thought--hates it. Moreover (and of consequence)\nshe despises every ambition that has not a material end.'\n\nHe enlarged upon the subject, followed it into all its ramifications,\nelaborated the inconsistencies with which it is rife. Peak's reply was\ndeliberate.\n\n'Admitting that some of these faults are rooted in sex, I should only\nfind them intolerable when their expression took a vulgar form. Between\nirrationality and coarseness of mind there is an enormous distinction.'\n\n'With coarse minds I have nothing to do.'\n\n'Forgive me if I ask you a blunt question,' said Peak, after\nhesitating. 'Have you ever associated with women of the highest\nrefinement?'\n\nEarwaker laughed.\n\n'I don't know what that phrase means. It sounds rather odd on your\nlips.'\n\n'Well, women of the highest class of commoners. With peeresses we\nneedn't concern ourselves.'\n\n'You imagine that social precedence makes all that difference in women?'\n\n'Yes, I do. The daughter of a county family is a finer being than any\ngirl who can spring from the nomad orders.'\n\n'Even supposing your nomads produce a Rachel or a Charlotte Brontee?'\n\n'We are not talking of genius,' Peak replied.\n\n'It was irrelevant, I know.--Well, yes, I _have_ conversed now and then\nwith what you would call well-born women. They are delightful\ncreatures, some of them, in given circumstances. But do you think I\never dreamt of taking a wife drenched with social prejudices?'\n\nPeak's face expressed annoyance, and he said nothing.\n\n'A man's wife,' pursued Earwaker, 'may be his superior in whatever you\nlike, _except_ social position. That is precisely the distinction that\nno woman can forget or forgive. On that account they are the\nobstructive element in social history. If I loved a woman of rank above\nmy own she would make me a renegade; for her sake I should deny my\nfaith. I should write for the _St. James's Gazette_, and at last poison\nmyself in an agony of shame.'\n\nA burst of laughter cleared the air for a moment, but for a moment\nonly. Peak's countenance clouded over again, and at length he said in a\nlower tone:\n\n'There are men whose character would defy that rule.'\n\n'Yes--to their own disaster. But I ought to have made one exception.\nThere is a case in which a woman will marry without much regard to her\nhusband's origin. Let him be a parson, and he may aim as high as he\nchooses.'\n\nPeak tried to smile. He made no answer, and fell into a fit of brooding.\n\n'What's all this about?' asked the journalist, when he too had mused\nawhile. 'Whose acquaintance have you been making?'\n\n'No one's.'\n\nThe suspicion was inevitable.\n\n'If it were true, perhaps you would be justified in mistrusting my way\nof regarding these things. But it's the natural tendency of my mind. If\nI ever marry at all, it will be a woman of far higher birth than my\nown.'\n\n'Don't malign your parents, old fellow. They gave you a brain inferior\nto that of few men. You will never meet a woman of higher birth.'\n\n'That's a friendly sophism. I can't thank you for it, because it has a\nbitter side.'\n\nBut the compliment had excited Peak, and after a moment's delay he\nexclaimed:\n\n'I have no other ambition in life--no other! Think the confession as\nridiculous as you like; my one supreme desire is to marry a perfectly\nrefined woman. Put it in the correct terms: I am a plebeian, and I aim\nat marrying a lady.'\n\nThe last words were flung out defiantly. He quivered as he spoke, and\nhis face flushed.\n\n'I can't wish you success,' returned his friend, with a grave smile.\n\n'You couldn't help it sounding like a sneer, if you did. The desire is\nhopeless, of course. It's because I know that, that I have made up my\nmind to travel for a year or two; it'll help me on towards the age when\nI shall regard all women with indifference. We won't talk about it any\nmore.'\n\n'One question. You seriously believe that you could find satisfaction\nin the life to which such a marriage would condemn you?'\n\n'What life?' asked Peak, impatiently.\n\n'That of an average gentleman, let us say, with house in town and\ncountry, with friends whose ruling motive was social propriety.'\n\n'I could enjoy the good and throw aside the distasteful.'\n\n'What about the distastefulness of your wife's crass conventionalism,\nespecially in religion?'\n\n'It would not be _crass_, to begin with. If her religion were genuine,\nI could tolerate it well enough; if it were merely a form, I could\ntrain her to my own opinions. Society is growing liberal--the best of\nit. Please remember that I have in mind a woman of the highest type our\ncivilisation can produce.'\n\n'Then you mustn't look for her in society!' cried Earwaker.\n\n'I don't care; where you will, so long as she had always lived among\npeople of breeding and high education, and never had her thoughts\nsoiled with the vile contact of poverty.'\n\nEarwaker started up and reached a volume from a shelf. Quickly finding\nthe desired page, he began to read aloud:\n\n'Dear, had the world in its caprice Deigned to proclaim--I know you\nboth, Have recognised your plighted troth, Am sponsor for you; live in\npeace!'--\n\nHe read to the end of the poem, and then looked up with an admiring\nsmile.\n\n'An ideal!' exclaimed Peak. 'An ideal akin to Murger's and Musset's\ngrisettes, who never existed.'\n\n'An ideal, most decidedly. But pray what is this consummate lady you\nhave in mind? An ideal every bit as much, and of the two I prefer\nBrowning's. For my own part, I am a polygamist; my wives live in\nliterature, and too far asunder to be able to quarrel. Impossible\nwomen, but exquisite. They shall suffice to me.'\n\nPeak rose, sauntered about the room for a minute or two, then said:\n\n'I have just got a title for my paper. I shall call it \"The New\nSophistry.\"'\n\n'Do very well, I should think,' replied the other, smiling. 'Will you\nlet me see it when it's done?'\n\n'Who knows if I shall finish it? Nothing I ever undertook has been\nfinished yet--nothing won that I ever aimed at. Good night. Let me hear\nabout Malkin.'\n\nIn a week's time Godwin received another summons to Staple Inn, with\npromise of Malkin's assured presence. In reply he wrote:\n\n'Owing to a new arrangement at Bates's, I start tomorrow for my holiday\nin Cornwall, so cannot see you for a few weeks. Please offer Malkin my\napologies; make them (I mean it) as profuse as those he telegraphed.\nHerewith I send you my paper, \"The New Sophistry\", which I have written\nat a few vehement sittings, and have carelessly copied. If you think it\nworth while, will you have the kindness to send it for me to _The\nCritical_? I haven't signed it, as my unmeaning name would perhaps\nindispose the fellow to see much good in it. I should thank you if you\nwould write in your own person, saying that you act for a friend; you\nare probably well known in those quarters. If it is accepted, time\nenough to claim my glory. If it seems to you to have no chance, keep it\ntill I return, as I hate the humiliation of refusals.--Don't think I\nmade an ass of myself the other night. We will never speak on that\nsubject again. All I said was horribly sincere, but I'm afraid you\ncan't understand that side of my nature. I should never have spoken so\nfrankly to Moxey, though he has made no secret with me of his own\nweaknesses. If I perish before long in a South American swamp, you will\nbe able to reflect on my personality with completer knowledge, so I\ndon't regret the indiscretion.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\n'_Pereunt et imputantur_.'\n\nGodwin Peak read the motto beneath the clock in Exeter Cathedral, and\nbelieved it of Christian origin. Had he known that the words were found\nin Martial, his rebellious spirit would have enjoyed the consecration\nof a phrase from such an unlikely author. Even as he must have laughed\nhad he stood in the Vatican before the figures of those two Greek\ndramatists who, for ages, were revered as Christian saints.\n\nHis ignorance preserved him from a clash of sentiments. This afternoon\nhe was not disposed to cynicism; rather he welcomed the softening\ninfluence of this noble interior, and let the golden sunlight form what\nshapes it would--heavenly beam, mystic aureole--before his mind's eye.\nArchitecture had no special interest for him, and the history of church\nor faith could seldom touch his emotions; but the glorious handiwork of\nmen long dead, the solemn stillness of an ancient sanctuary, made that\nappeal to him which is independent of names.\n\n'_Pereunt et imputantur_.'\n\nHe sat down where the soft, slow ticking of the clock could guide his\nthoughts. This morning he had left London by the earliest train, and\nafter a night in Exeter would travel westward by leisurely stages,\nseeing as much as possible of the coast and of that inland scenery\nwhich had geological significance. His costume declared him bent on\nholiday, but, at the same time, distinguished him with delicate\nemphasis from the tourist of the season. Trustworthy sartorial skill\nhad done its best for his person. Sitting thus, he had the air of a\ngentleman who enjoys no unwonted ease. He could forget himself in\nreverie, and be unaware of soft footfalls that drew near along the\naisle.\n\nBut the sound of a young voice, subdued yet very clear, made claim upon\nhis attention.\n\n'Sidwell!--Sidwell!'\n\nShe who spoke was behind him; on looking up, he saw that a lady just in\nfront had stopped and turned to the summons; smiling, she retraced her\nsteps. He moved, so as to look discreetly in the backward direction,\nand observed a group of four persons, who were occupied with a tablet\non the wall: a young man (not long out of boyhood), a girl who might be\na year or two younger, and two ladies, of whom it could only be said\nthat they were mature in the beauty of youth, probably of\nmaidenhood--one of them, she who had been called back by the name of\n'Sidwell'.\n\nSurely an uncommon name. From a guide-book, with which he had amused\nhimself in the train, he knew that one of the churches of Exeter was\ndedicated to St. Sidwell, but only now did his recollection apprise him\nof a long past acquaintance with the name of the saint. Had not\nBuckland Warricombe a sister called Sidwell? And--did he only surmise a\nconnection between the Warricombes and Devon? No, no; on that remote\nday, when he went out with Buckland to the house near Kingsmill, Mr.\nWarricombe spoke to him of Exeter,--mentioning that the town of his\nbirth was Axminster, where William Buckland, the geologist, also was\nborn; whence the name of his eldest son. How suddenly it all came back!\n\nHe rose and moved apart to a spot whence he might quietly observe the\nstrangers. 'Sidwell', once remarked, could not be confused with the\ncompanion of her own age; she was slimmer, shorter (if but slightly),\nmore sedate in movement, and perhaps better dressed--though both were\nadmirable in that respect. Ladies, beyond a doubt. And the young man--\n\nAt this distance it was easy to deceive oneself, but did not that face\nbring something back? Now, as he smiled, it seemed to recall Buckland\nWarricombe--with a difference. This might well be a younger brother;\nthere used to be one or two.\n\nThey were familiar with the Cathedral, and at present appeared to take\nexclusive interest in certain mural monuments. For perhaps ten minutes\nthey lingered about the aisle, then, after a glance at the west window,\nwent forth. With quick step, Godwin pursued them; he issued in time to\nsee them entering an open carriage, which presently drove away towards\nHigh Street.\n\nFor half an hour he walked the Cathedral Close. Not long ago, on first\ncoming into that quiet space, with its old houses, its smooth lawns,\nits majestic trees, he had felt the charm peculiar to such scenes--the\nnatural delight in a form of beauty especially English. Now, the\nimpression was irrecoverable; he could see nothing but those four\npersons, and their luxurious carriage, and the two beautiful horses\nwhich had borne them--whither? As likely as not the identity he had\nsupposed for them was quite imaginary; yet it would be easy to\nascertain whether a Warricombe family dwelt at Exeter. The forename of\nBuckland's father--? He never had known it. Still, it was worth while\nconsulting a directory.\n\nHe walked to his hotel.\n\nYes, the name Warricombe stood there, but it occurred more than once.\nHe sought counsel of the landlord. Which of these Warricombes was a\ngentleman of position, with grown-up sons and daughters? To such a\ndescription answered Martin Warricombe, Esquire, well known in the\ncity. His house was in the Old Tiverton Road, out beyond St Sidwell's,\ntwo miles away; anyone in that district would serve as guide to it.\n\nWith purpose indefinite, Godwin set forth in the direction suggested.\nAt little more than a saunter, he passed out of High Street into its\ncontinuation, where he soon descried the Church of St. Sidwell, and\nthence, having made inquiry, walked towards the Old Tiverton Road. He\nwas now quite beyond the town limits, and few pedestrians came in\nsight; if he really wished to find the abode of Martin Warricombe, he\nmust stop the first questionable person. But to what end this inquiry?\nHe could not even be certain that Martin was the man he had in mind,\nand even were he right in all his conjectures, what had he to do with\nthe Warricombes?\n\nTen years ago the family had received him courteously as Buckland's\nfellow-student; he had spent an hour or two at their house, and\nsubsequently a few words had passed when they saw him on prize-day at\nWhitelaw. To Buckland he had never written; he had never since heard of\nhim; that name was involved in the miserable whirl of circumstances\nwhich brought his College life to a close, and it was always his hope\nthat Buckland thought no more of him. Even had there been no\ndisagreeable memories, it was surely impossible to renew after this\ninterval so very slight an acquaintance. How could they receive him,\nsave with civilly mild astonishment?\n\nAn errand-boy came along, whistling townwards, a big basket over his\nhead. No harm in asking where Mr. Warricombe lived. The reply was\nprompt: second house on the right hand, rather a large one, not a\nquarter of a mile onward.\n\nHere, then. The site was a good one. From this part of the climbing\nroad one looked over the lower valley of the Exe, saw the whole\nestuary, and beyond that a horizon of blue sea. Fair, rich land, warm\nunder the westering sun. The house itself seemed to be old, but after\nall was not very large; it stood amid laurels, and in the garden behind\nrose a great yew-tree. No person was visible; but for the wave-like\nmurmur of neighbouring pines, scarce a sound would have disturbed the\nair.\n\nGodwin walked past, and found that the road descended into a deep\nhollow, whence between high banks, covered with gorse and bracken and\nmany a summer flower, it led again up a hill thick planted with firs;\nat the lowest point was a bridge over a streamlet, offering on either\nhand a view of soft green meadows. A spot of exquisite retirement:\nhappy who lived here in security from the struggle of life!\n\nIt was folly to spoil his enjoyment of country such as this by dreaming\nimpossible opportunities. The Warricombes could be nothing to him; to\nmeet with Buckland would only revive the shame long ago outlived. After\nresting for a few minutes he turned back, passed the silent house\nagain, delighted himself with the wide view, and so into the city once\nmore, where he began to seek the remnants of its old walls.\n\nThe next morning was Sunday, and he had planned to go by the Plymouth\ntrain to a station whence he could reach Start Point; but his mood was\nbecome so unsettled that ten o'clock, when already he should have been\non his journey, found him straying about the Cathedral Close. A mere\nhalf-purpose, a vague wavering intention, which might at any moment be\nscattered by common sense, drew his steps to the door of the Cathedral,\nwhere people were entering for morning service; he moved idly within\nsight of the carriages which drew up. Several had discharged their\nfreightage of tailoring and millinery, when two vehicles, which seemed\ncompanions, stopped at the edge of the pavement, and from the second\nalighted the young ladies whom Godwin had yesterday observed; their\nmale companion, however, was different. The carriage in advance also\ncontained four persons: a gentleman of sixty, his wife, a young girl,\nand the youth of yesterday. It needed but a glance to inform Godwin\nthat the oldest of the party was Mr. Warricombe, Buckland's father; ten\nyears had made no change in his aspect. Mrs. Warricombe was not less\nrecognisable. They passed at once into the edifice, and he had scarcely\ntime to bestow a keen look upon Sidwell.\n\nThat was a beautiful girl; he stood musing upon the picture registered\nby his brain. But why not follow, and from a neighbouring seat survey\nher and the others at his leisure? Pooh! But the impulse constrained\nhim. After all, he could not get a place that allowed him to see\nSidwell. Her companion, however, the one who seemed to be of much the\nsame age, was well in view. Sisters they could not be; nothing of the\nWarricombe countenance revealed itself in those handsome but\nstrongly-marked features. A beautiful girl, she also, yet of a type\nthat made slight appeal to him. Sidwell was all he could imagine of\nsweet and dignified; more modest in bearing, more gracile, more--\n\nMonday at noon, and he still walked the streets of Exeter. Early this\nmorning he had been out to the Old Tiverton Road, and there, on the\nlawn amid the laurels, had caught brief glimpse of two female figures,\nin one of which he merely divined Sidwell. Why he tarried thus he did\nnot pretend to explain to himself. Rain had just come on, and the\nlowering sky made him low-spirited; he mooned about the street under\nhis umbrella.\n\nAnd at this rate, might vapour away his holiday. Exeter was tedious,\nbut he could not make up his mind to set forth for the sea-shore, where\nonly his own thoughts awaited him. Packed away in his wallet lay\ngeological hammer, azimuth compass, clinometer, miniature\nmicroscope,--why should he drag all that lumber about with him? What to\nhim were the bygone millions of ages, the hoary records of unimaginable\ntime? One touch of a girl's hand, one syllable of musical speech,--was\nit not that whereof his life had truly need?\n\nAs remote from him, however, as the age of the pterodactyl. How often\nwas it necessary to repeat this? On a long voyage, such as he had all\nbut resolved to take, one might perchance form acquaintances. He had\nheard of such things; not impossibly, a social circle might open to him\nat Buenos Ayres. But here in England his poor origin, his lack of means\nwould for ever bar him from the intimacy of people like the Warricombes.\n\nHe loitered towards the South-Western station, dimly conscious of a\npurpose to look for trains. Instead of seeking the time-tables he stood\nbefore the bookstall and ran his eye along the titles of new novels; he\nhad half a mind to buy one of Hardy's and read himself into the temper\nwhich suited summer rambles. But just as his hand was stretched forth,\na full voice, speaking beside him, made demand for a London weekly\npaper. Instantly he turned. The tones had carried him back to Whitelaw;\nthe face disturbed that illusion, but substituted a reality which threw\nhim into tremor.\n\nHis involuntary gaze was met with one of equal intensity. A man of his\nown years, but in splendid health and with bright eyes that looked\nenjoyment of life, suddenly addressed him.\n\n'Godwin Peak--surely--?'\n\n'Buckland Warricombe, no less surely.'\n\nThey shook hands with vigour, laughing in each other's faces; then,\nafter a moment's pause, Warricombe drew aside from the bookstall, for\nsake of privacy.\n\n'Why did we lose sight of each other?' he asked, flashing a glance at\nGodwin's costume. 'Why didn't you write to me at Cambridge? What have\nyou been doing this half-century?'\n\n'I have been in London all the time.'\n\n'I am there most of the year. Well, I rejoice to have met you. On a\nholiday?'\n\n'Loitering towards Cornwall.'\n\n'In that case, you can come and have lunch with me at my father's\nhouse. It's only a mile or two off. I was going to walk, but we'll\ndrive, if you like.'\n\nThere was no refusing, and no possibility of reflection. Buckland's\nhearty manner made the invitation in itself a thoroughly pleasant one,\nand before Peak could sufficiently command his thoughts to picture the\nscene towards which he was going they were walking side by side through\nthe town. In appearance, Warricombe showed nothing of the revolutionary\nwhich, in old days, he aimed at making himself, and his speech had a\nsuavity which no doubt resulted from much intercourse with the polished\nworld; Godwin was filled with envious admiration of his perfect\nphysique, and the mettle which kept it in such excellent vigour. Even\nfor a sturdy walker, it was no common task to keep pace with Buckland's\nstrides; Peak soon found himself conversing rather too breathlessly for\ncomfort.\n\n'What is your latest record for the mile?' he inquired.\n\nWarricombe, understanding at once the reference to his old athletic\npastime and its present application, laughed merrily, and checked his\nprogress.\n\n'A bad habit of mine; it gets me into trouble with everyone.\nBy-the-bye, haven't you become a stronger man than used to seem likely?\nI'm quite glad to see how well you look.'\n\nThe sincerity of these expressions, often repeated, put Godwin far more\nat his ease than the first moment's sensation had promised. He too\nbegan to feel a genuine pleasure in the meeting, and soon bade defiance\nto all misgivings. Delicacy perhaps withheld Warricombe from further\nmention of Whitelaw, but on the other hand it was not impossible that\nhe knew nothing of the circumstances which tormented Godwin's memory.\nOn leaving the College perchance he had lost all connection with those\ncommon friends who might have informed him of subsequent jokes and\nrumours. Unlikely, to be sure; for doubtless some of his Whitelaw\ncontemporaries encountered him at Cambridge; and again, was it not\nprobable that the younger Warricombe had become a Whitelaw student?\nThen Professor Gale--no matter! The Warricombes of course knew all\nabout Andrew Peak and his dining-rooms, but they were liberal-minded,\nand could forgive a boy's weakness, as well as overlook an\nacquaintance's obscure origin. In the joy of finding himself\nexuberantly welcomed by a man of Buckland's world he overcame his\nignoble self-consciousness.\n\n'Did you know that we were in this part of the country?' Warricombe\nasked, once more speeding ahead.\n\n'I always thought of you in connection with Kingsmill.'\n\n'We gave up Thornhaw seven years ago. My father was never quite\ncomfortable out of Devonshire. The house I am taking you to has been in\nour family for three generations. I have often tried to be proud of the\nfact, but, as you would guess, that kind of thing doesn't come very\nnatural to me.'\n\nIn the effort to repudiate such sentiment, Buckland distinctly betrayed\nits hold upon him. He imagined he was meeting Godwin on equal ground,\nbut the sensibility of the proletarian could not thus be deceived.\nThere was a brief silence, during which each looked away from the other.\n\n'Still keep up your geology?' was Warricombe's next question.\n\n'I can just say that I haven't forgotten it all.'\n\n'I'm afraid that's more than I can. During my Cambridge time it caused\ndisagreeable debates with my father. You remember that his science is\nof the old school. I wouldn't say a word to disparage him. I believe\nthe extent of his knowledge is magnificent; but he can't get rid of\nthat old man of the sea, the Book of Genesis. A few years ago I wasn't\ntoo considerate in argument, and I talked as I oughtn't to have done,\ncalled names, and so on. The end of it was, I dropped science\naltogether, having got as much out of it as I needed. The good old\npater has quite forgiven my rudeness. At present we agree to differ,\nand get on capitally. I'm sure he'll be delighted to see you. There are\nsome visitors with us; a Miss Moorhouse and her brother. I think you'll\nlike them. Couldn't you stay overnight?'\n\nGodwin was unable to reply on the instant, and his companion proceeded\nwith the same heartiness.\n\n'Just as you like, you know. But do stay if you can. On Wednesday\nmorning I must go back to town. I act as secretary to Godolphin, the\nmember for Slacksea.'\n\nPeak's acquaintance with current politics was slight, but Mr. Ellis\nGodolphin, the aristocratic Radical, necessarily stood before his\nimagination with some clearness of outline. So this was how life had\ndealt with Buckland. The announcement was made with a certain\nsatisfaction, as if it implied more than the hearer would readily\nappreciate. Again there was a slight shrinking on Godwin's part; it\nwould be natural for him to avow his own position, and so leave no room\nfor misunderstandings, but before he could shape a phrase Buckland was\nagain questioning.\n\n'Do you ever see any of the old fellows?'\n\n'I have met one or two of them, by chance.'\n\nAs if his tact informed him that this inquiry had been a mistake,\nWarricombe resumed the subject of his family.\n\n'My brother Louis is at home--of course you can't remember him; he was\na youngster when you were at Thornhaw. The younger boy died some years\nago, a pony accident; cut up my father dreadfully. Then there's my\nsister Sidwell, and my sister Fanny--that's all of us. I can't quite\nanswer for Louis, but the rest are of the old school. Liberal enough,\ndon't be afraid. But--well, the old school.'\n\nAs Godwin kept silence, the speaker shot a glance at him, keenly\nscrutinising. Their eyes did not meet; Peak kept his on the ground.\n\n'Care much about politics nowadays?'\n\n'Not very much.'\n\n'Can't say that I do myself,' pursued Buckland. 'I rather drifted into\nit. Godolphin, I daresay, has as little humbug about him as most\nparliamentarians; we stick to the practical fairly well. I shall never\ngo into the House on my own account. But there's a sort of pleasure in\nbeing in the thick of public movements. I'm not cut out for debate;\nshould lose my temper, and tell disagreeable truths--which wouldn't do,\nyou know. But behind the scenes--it isn't bad, in a way.'\n\nA longer pause obliged Godwin to speak of himself.\n\n'My life is less exciting. For years I have worked in a manufacturing\nlaboratory at Rotherhithe.'\n\n'So science has carried the day with you, after all. It used to be very\ndoubtful.'\n\nThis was a kind and pleasant way of interpreting necessity. Godwin felt\ngrateful, and added with a smile:\n\n'I don't think I shall stick to it much longer. For one thing, I am\nsick of town. Perhaps I shall travel for a year or two; perhaps--I'm in\na state of transition, to tell the truth.'\n\nBuckland revolved this information; his face told that he found it\nslightly puzzling.\n\n'You once had thoughts of literature.'\n\n'Long given up.'\n\n'Leisure would perhaps revive them?'\n\n'Possibly; but I think not.'\n\nThey were now quitting the town, and Peak, unwilling to appear before\nstrangers in a state of profuse perspiration, again moderated his\nfriend's speed. They began to talk about the surrounding country, a\ntheme which occupied them until the house was reached. With\nquick-beating heart, Godwin found himself at the gate by which he had\nalready twice passed. Secure in the decency of his apparel, and no\nlonger oppressed by bashfulness, he would have gone joyously forward\nbut for the dread of a possible ridiculous association which his name\nmight revive in the thoughts of Mr. and Mrs. Warricombe. Yet\nBuckland--who had no lack of kindly feeling--would hardly have brought\nhim here had the reception which awaited him been at all dubious.\n\n'If we don't come across anyone,' said Warricombe, 'we'll go straight\nup to my room.'\n\nBut the way was not clear. Within the beautiful old porch sat Sidwell\nWarricombe and her friend of the striking countenance, whom Godwin now\nknew as Miss Moorhouse. Buckland addressed his sister in a tone of\nlively pleasure.\n\n'Whom do you think I have met and brought home with me? Here is my old\nfriend, Godwin Peak.'\n\nUnder the two pairs of female eyes, Godwin kept a calm, if rather\nstern, face.\n\n'I should have had no difficulty in recognising Mr. Peak,' said\nSidwell, holding out her hand. 'But was the meeting quite by chance?'\n\nTo Godwin himself the question was of course directed, with a look of\nsmiling interest--such welcome as could not have been improved upon;\nshe listened to his reply, then presented him to Miss Moorhouse. A\nslight languor in her movements and her voice, together with the\nbeautiful coldness of her complexion, made it probable that she did not\nshare the exuberant health manifest in her two brothers. She conversed\nwith mature self-possession, yet showed a slight tendency to\nabstractedness. On being addressed, she regarded the speaker steadily\nfor an instant before shaping her answer, which always, however\ntrifling the subject, seemed carefully worded. In these few moments of\ndialogue, Godwin reached the conclusion that Sidwell had not much sense\nof humour, but that the delicacy of her mind was unsurpassable.\n\nIn Miss Moorhouse there was no defect of refinement, but her\nconversation struck a note of sprightliness at once more energetic and\nmore subtle than is often found in English girls. Thus, though at times\nshe looked so young that it might be doubted whether she had long been\nout of her teens, at others one suspected her older than Sidwell. The\nfriends happened to be as nearly as possible of an age, which was\nverging to twenty-six.\n\nWhen he spoke to Miss Moorhouse, Buckland's frank tone subdued itself.\nHe watched her face with reverent attention, smiled when she smiled,\nand joined in her laughter with less than his usual volume of sound. In\nacuteness he was obviously inferior to her, and there were moments when\nhe betrayed some nervousness under her rejoinders. All this was matter\nof observation for Peak, who had learnt to exercise his discernment\neven whilst attending to the proprieties.\n\nThe sounding of the first luncheon-bell left the young men free to go\nupstairs. When at length they presented themselves in the drawing-room,\nMrs. Warricombe and her younger daughter sat there alone. The greeting\nof his hostess did not quite satisfy Godwin, though it was sufficiently\ncourteous; he remembered that ten years ago Mrs. Warricombe had\nappeared to receive him with some restraint, and his sensation in\nrenewing her acquaintance was one of dislike. But in a moment the\nmaster of the house joined them, and no visitor could have had a more\nkindly welcome than that he offered to his son's friend. With genial\ntact, Mr. Warricombe ignored the interval since his last conversation\nwith Godwin, and spoke as if this visit were the most natural thing in\nthe world.\n\n'Do you already know the country about Exeter?'\n\n'I have seen very little of it yet.'\n\n'Oh, then, we must show you our points of view. Our own garden offers a\nglimpse of the river-mouth and a good prospect of Haldon--the ridge\nbeyond the Exe; but there are many much better points within easy\nreach. You are in no hurry, I hope?'\n\nLouis Warricombe and Miss Moorhouse's brother were away on a long walk;\nthey did not return for lunch. Godwin was glad of this, for time had\nwrought the change in him that he felt more at ease in female society\nthan under the eyes of young men whose social position inclined them to\ncriticism. The meal proved as delightful as luncheon is wont to be in a\nluxurious country-house, when brilliant sunshine gleams on the foliage\nvisible from windows, and the warmth of the season sanctions clear\ncolours in costume. The talk was wholly of country pleasures. It\nafforded the visitor no little satisfaction to be able to make known\nhis acquaintance with parts of England to which the Warricombes had not\npenetrated. Godwin learnt that the family were insular in their tastes;\na mention by Miss Moorhouse of continental scenes led the host to avow\na strong preference for his own country, under whatever aspect, and\nSidwell murmured her sympathy.\n\nNo less introspective than in the old days, though he could better\ncommand his muscles, Peak, after each of his short remarks, made\ncomparison of his tone and phraseology with those of the other\nspeakers. Had he still any marks of the ignoble world from which he\nsprang? Any defect of pronunciation, any native awkwardness of\nutterance? Impossible to judge himself infallibly, but he was conscious\nof no vulgar mannerism. Though it was so long since he left Whitelaw,\nthe accent of certain of the Professors still remained with him as an\nexample: when endeavouring to be graceful, he was wont to hear the\nvoice of Dr Nares, or of Professor Barber who lectured on English\nLiterature. More recently he had been observant of Christian Moxey's\nspeech, which had a languid elegance worth imitating in certain\nparticulars. Buckland Warricombe was rather a careless talker, but it\nwas the carelessness of a man who had never needed to reflect on such a\nmatter, the refinement of whose enunciation was assured to him from the\nnursery. That now was a thing to be aimed at. Preciseness must be\navoided, for in a young man it seemed to argue conscious effort: a\nloose sentence now and then, a colloquialism substituted for the more\ngrammatical phrase.\n\nHeaven be thanked that he was unconcerned on the point of garb!\nInferiority in that respect would have been fatal to his ease. His\nclothes were not too new, and in quality were such as he had the habit\nof wearing. The Warricombes must have immediately detected any\npretentiousness, were it but in a necktie; that would impress them more\nunfavourably than signs of poverty. But he defied inspection. Not\nSidwell herself, doubtless sensitive in the highest degree, could\nconceive a prejudice against him on this account.\n\nHis misgivings were overcome. If these people were acquainted with the\n'dining-rooms' joke, it certainly did not affect their behaviour to\nhim, and he could hope, by the force of his personality, to obliterate\nfrom their minds such disagreeable thoughts as they might secretly\nentertain. Surely he could make good his claim to be deemed a\ngentleman. To Buckland he had declared his position, and no shame\nattached to it. A man of scientific tastes, like Mr. Warricombe, must\nconsider it respectable enough. Grant him a little time, and why should\nhe not become a recognised friend of this family?\n\nIf he were but resident in Exeter.\n\nFor the first time, he lost himself in abstraction, and only an inquiry\nfrom Sidwell recalled him.\n\n'You have seen the Cathedral, Mr. Peak?'\n\n'Oh yes! I attended service there yesterday morning.'\n\nHad he reflected, perhaps he would not have added this circumstance;\neven in speaking he suffered a confused doubtfulness. But as soon as\nthe words were uttered, he felt strangely glad. Sidwell bestowed upon\nhim an unmistakable look of approval; her mother gazed with colder\ninterest; Mr. Warricombe regarded him, and mused; Buckland, a smile of\npeculiar meaning on his close lips, glanced from him to Miss Moorhouse.\n\n'Ah, then, you heard Canon Grayling,' remarked the father of the\nfamily, with something in his tone which answered to Sidwell's facial\nexpression. 'How did you like his sermon?'\n\nGodwin was trifling with a pair of nut-crackers, but the nervousness\nevident in his fingers did not prevent him from replying with a natural\nair of deliberation.\n\n'I was especially struck with the passage about the barren fig-tree.'\n\nThe words might have expressed a truth, but in that case a tone of\nsarcasm must have winged them. As it was, they involved either\nhypocrisy or ungenerous irony at the expense of his questioner.\nBuckland could not but understand them in the latter sense; his face\ndarkened. At that moment, Peak met his eye, and encountered its steady\nsearching gaze with a perfectly calm smile. Half-a-dozen pulsings of\nhis heart--violent, painful, and the fatal hour of his life had struck.\n\n'What had he to say about it?' Buckland asked, carelessly.\n\nPeak's reply was one of those remarkable efforts of mind--one might\nsay, of character--which are sometimes called forth, without\npremeditation, almost without consciousness, by a profound moral\ncrisis. A minute or two ago he would have believed it impossible to\nrecall and state in lucid terms the arguments to which, as he sat in\nthe Cathedral, he had barely given ear; he remembered vaguely that the\npreacher (whose name he knew not till now) had dwelt for a few moments\non the topic indicated, but at the time he was indisposed to listen\nseriously, and what chance was there that the chain of thought had\nfixed itself in his memory? Now, under the marvelling regard of his\nconscious self, he poured forth an admirable rendering of the Canon's\nviews, fuller than the original--more eloquent, more subtle. For five\nminutes he held his hearers in absorbed attention, even Buckland\nbending forward with an air of genuine interest; and when he stopped,\nrather suddenly, there followed a silence.\n\n'Mr. Peak,' said the host, after a cough of apology, 'you have made\nthat clearer to me than it was yesterday. I must thank you.'\n\nGodwin felt that a slight bow of acknowledgment was perhaps called for,\nbut not a muscle would obey his will. He was enervated; perspiration\nstood on his forehead. The most severe physical effort could not have\nreduced him to a feebler state.\n\nSidwell was speaking:\n\n'Mr. Peak has developed what Canon Grayling only suggested.'\n\n'A brilliant effort of exegesis,' exclaimed Buckland, with a\ngood-natured laugh.\n\nAgain the young men exchanged looks. Godwin smiled as one might under a\nsentence of death. As for the other, his suspicion had vanished, and he\nnow gave way to frank amusement. Luncheon was over, and by a general\nmovement all went forth on to the lawn in front of the house. Mr.\nWarricombe, even more cordial than hitherto, named to Godwin the\nfeatures of the extensive landscape.\n\n'But you see that the view is in a measure spoilt by the growth of the\ncity. A few years ago, none of those ugly little houses stood in the\nmid-distance. A few years hence, I fear, there will be much more to\ncomplain of. I daresay you know all about the ship-canal: the story of\nthe countess, and so forth?'\n\nBuckland presently suggested that the afternoon might be used for a\ndrive.\n\n'I was about to propose it,' said his father. 'You might start by the\nStoke Canon Road, so as to let Mr. Peak have the famous view from the\ngate; then go on towards Silverton, for the sake of the reversed\nprospect from the Exe. Who shall be of the party?'\n\nIt was decided that four only should occupy the vehicle, Miss Moorhouse\nand Fanny Warricombe to be the two ladies. Godwin regretted Sidwell's\nomission, but the friendly informality of the arrangement delighted\nhim. When the carriage rolled softly from the gravelled drive, Buckland\nholding the reins, he felt an animation such as no event had ever\nproduced in him. No longer did he calculate phrases. A spontaneous\naptness marked his dialogue with Miss Moorhouse, and the laughing words\nhe now and then addressed to Fanny. For a short time Buckland was\nlaconic, but at length he entered into the joyous tone of the occasion.\nEarwaker would have stood in amazement, could he have seen and heard\nthe saturnine denizen of Peckham Rye.\n\nThe weather was superb. A sea-breeze mitigated the warmth of the\ncloudless sun, and where a dark pine-tree rose against the sky it gave\nthe azure depths a magnificence unfamiliar to northern eyes.\n\n'On such a day as this,' remarked Miss Moorhouse, dividing her look\nbetween Buckland and his friend, 'one feels that there's a good deal to\nbe said for England.'\n\n'But for the vile weather,' was Warricombe's reply, 'you wouldn't know\nsuch enjoyment.'\n\n'Oh, I can't agree with that for a moment! My capacity for enjoyment is\nunlimited. That philosophy is unworthy of you; it belongs to a paltry\nscheme called \"making the best of things\".'\n\n'In which you excel, Miss Moorhouse.'\n\n'That she does!' agreed Fanny--a laughing, rosy-cheeked maiden.\n\n'I deny it! No one is more copious in railing against circumstances.'\n\n'But you turn them all to a joke,' Fanny objected.\n\n'That's my profound pessimism. I am misunderstood. No one expects irony\nfrom a woman.'\n\nPeak found it difficult not to gaze too persistently at the subtle\ncountenance. He was impelled to examine it by a consciousness that he\nhimself received a large share of Miss Moorhouse's attention, and a\ndoubt as to the estimation in which she held him. Canon Grayling's\nsermon and Godwin's comment had elicited no remark from her. Did she\nbelong to the ranks of emancipated women? With his experience of\nMarcella Moxey, he welcomed the possibility of this variation of the\ntype, but at the same time, in obedience to a new spirit that had\nstrange possession of him, recognised that such phenomena no longer\naroused his personal interest. By the oddest of intellectual processes\nhe had placed himself altogether outside the sphere of unorthodox\nspirits. Concerning Miss Moorhouse he cared only for the report she\nmight make of him to the Warricombes.\n\nBefore long, the carriage was stopped that he might enjoy one of the\npleasantest views in the neighbourhood of the city. A gate,\ninterrupting a high bank with which the road was bordered, gave\nadmission to the head of a great cultivated slope, which fell to the\nriver Exe; hence was suddenly revealed a wide panorama. Three\nwell-marked valleys--those of the Creedy, the Exe, and the Culm--spread\ntheir rural loveliness to remote points of the horizon; gentle\nundulations, with pasture and woodland, with long winding roads, and\nmany a farm that gleamed white amid its orchard leafage, led the gaze\ninto regions of evanescent hue and outline. Westward, a bolder swell\npointed to the skirts of Dartmoor. No inappropriate detail disturbed\nthe impression. Exeter was wholly hidden behind the hill on which the\nobservers stood, and the line of railway leading thither could only be\ndescried by special search. A foaming weir at the hill's foot blended\nits soft murmur with that of the fir branches hereabouts; else, no\nsound that the air could convey beyond the pulsing of a bird's note.\n\nAll had alighted, and for a minute or two there was silence. When Peak\nhad received such geographical instruction as was needful, Warricombe\npointed out to him a mansion conspicuous on the opposite slope of the\nExe valley, the seat of Sir Stafford Northcote. The house had no\narchitectural beauty, but its solitary lordship amid green pastures and\ntracts of thick wood declared the graces and privileges of ancestral\nwealth. Standing here alone, Godwin would have surveyed these\npossessions of an English aristocrat with more or less bitterness; envy\nwould, for a moment at all events, have perturbed his pleasure in the\nnatural scene. Accompanied as he was, his emotion took a form which\nindeed was allied to envy, but had nothing painful. He exulted in the\nprerogatives of birth and opulence, felt proud of hereditary pride,\ngloried that his mind was capable of appreciating to the full those\ndistinctions which, by the vulgar, are not so much as suspected.\nAdmitted to equal converse with men and women who represented the best\nin English society, he could cast away the evil grudge, the fierce\nspirit of self-assertion, and be what nature had proposed in endowing\nhim with large brain, generous blood, delicate tissues. What room for\nmalignancy? He was accepted by his peers, and could regard with\ntolerance even those ignoble orders of mankind amid whom he had so long\ndwelt unrecognised.\n\nA bee hummed past him, and this sound--of all the voices of nature that\nwhich most intenerates--filled his heart to overflowing. Moisture made\nhis eyes dim, and at the impulse of a feeling of gratitude, such as\nonly the subtlest care of psychology could fully have explained, he\nturned to Buckland, saying:\n\n'But for my meeting with you I should have had a lonely and not very\ncheerful holiday. I owe you a great deal.'\n\nWarricombe laughed, but as an Englishman does when he wishes to avoid\nshow of emotion.\n\n'I am very glad indeed that we did meet. Stay with us over tomorrow. I\nonly wish I were not obliged to go to London on Wednesday.--Look,\nFanny, isn't that a hawk, over Cowley Bridge?'\n\n'Do you feel you would like to shoot it?' asked Miss Moorhouse--who a\nmoment ago had very closely examined Peak's face.\n\n'To shoot it--why do you ask that?'\n\n'Confess that you felt the desire.'\n\n'Every man does,' replied Buckland, 'until he has had a moment to\nrecover himself. That's the human instinct.'\n\n'The male human instinct. Thank you for your honesty.'\n\nThey drove on, and by a wide circuit, occasionally stopping for the\nview, returned to the Old Tiverton Road, and so home. By this time\nLouis Warricombe and Mr. Moorhouse were back from their walk. Reposing\nin the company of the ladies, they had partaken of such refreshments as\nare lawful at five o'clock, and now welcomed with vivacity the later\narrivals. Moorhouse was something older than Buckland, a sallow-cheeked\nman with forehead and eyes expressive of much intelligence. Till of\nlate he had been a Cambridge tutor, but was now privately occupied in\nmathematical pursuits. Louis Warricombe had not yet made up his mind\nwhat profession to follow, and to aid the process of resolve had for\nthe present devoted himself to physical exercise.\n\nTea-cup in hand, Godwin seated himself by Sidwell, who began by\ninquiring how the drive had pleased him. The fervour of his reply\ncaused her to smile with special graciousness, and their conversation\nwas uninterrupted for some minutes. Then Fanny came forward with a book\nof mosses, her own collection, which she had mentioned to Peak as they\nwere talking together in the carriage.\n\n'Do you make special study of any science?' Sidwell asked, when certain\nremarks of Godwin's had proved his familiarity with the things he was\ninspecting.\n\n'It is long since I worked seriously at anything of the kind,' he\nanswered; adding in a moment, 'except at chemistry--that only because\nit is my business.'\n\n'Organic or inorganic chemistry?' inquired Fanny, with the promptness\nof a schoolgirl who wishes to have it known that her ideas are no\nlonger vague.\n\n'Organic for the most part,' Godwin replied, smiling at her. 'And of\nthe most disagreeable kind.'\n\nSidwell reflected, then put another question, but with some diffidence.\n\n'I think you were once fond of geology?'\n\nIt was the first allusion to that beginning of their acquaintance, ten\nyears ago. Peak succeeded in meeting her look with steadiness.\n\n'Yes, I still like it.'\n\n'Father's collections have been much improved since you saw them at\nThornhaw.'\n\n'I hope Mr. Warricombe will let me see them.'\n\nBuckland came up and made an apology for drawing his friend aside.\n\n'Will you let us send for your traps? You may just as well have a room\nhere for a night or two.'\n\nPerpetually imagining some kind chance that might associate him with\ncivilised people, Godwin could not even pack his portmanteau for a\nramble to Land's End without stowing away a dress suit. He was thus\nsaved what would have been an embarrassment of special annoyance.\nWithout hesitation, he accepted Buckland's offer, and named the hotel\nat which the luggage was deposited.\n\n'All right; the messenger shall explain. Our name's well enough known\nto them. If you would like to look up my father in his study, he'll be\ndelighted to go over his collections with you. You still care for that\nkind of thing?'\n\n'Most certainly. How can you doubt it?'\n\nBuckland smiled, and gave no other reply.\n\n'Ask Fanny to show you the way when you care to go.' And he left the\nroom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nSidwell had fallen into conversation with Mr. Moorhouse. Miss\nMoorhouse, Mrs. Warricombe, and Louis were grouped in animated talk.\nObserving that Fanny threw glances towards him from a lonely corner,\nPeak went over to her, and was pleased with the smile he met. Fanny had\nwatched eyes, much brighter than Sidwell's; her youthful vivacity\nblended with an odd little fashion of schoolgirl pedantry in a very\npiquant way. Godwin's attempts at conversation with her were rather\nawkward; he found it difficult to strike the suitable note, something\nnot too formal yet not deficient in respect.\n\n'Do you think,' he asked presently, 'that I should disturb your father\nif I went to him?'\n\n'Oh, not at all! I often go and sit in the study at this time.'\n\n'Will you show me the way?'\n\nFanny at once rose, and together they crossed the hall, passed through\na sort of anteroom connecting with a fernery, and came to the study\ndoor. A tap was answered by cheerful summons, and Fanny looked in.\n\n'Well, my ladybird? Ah, you are bringing Mr. Peak; come in, come in!'\n\nIt was a large and beautiful room, its wide windows, in a cushioned\nrecess, looking upon the lawn where the yew tree cast solemn shade. One\nwall presented an unbroken array of volumes, their livery sober but\nhandsome; detached bookcases occupied other portions of the irregular\nperimeter. Cabinets, closed and open, were arranged with due regard to\nconvenience. Above the mantelpiece hung a few small photographs, but\nthe wall-space at disposal was chiefly occupied with objects which\nillustrated Mr. Warricombe's scientific tastes. On a stand in the light\nof the window gleamed two elaborate microscopes, provocative of\nenthusiasm in a mind such as Godwin's.\n\nIn a few minutes, Fanny silently retired. Her father, by no means\nforward to speak of himself and his pursuits, was led in that direction\nby Peak's expressions of interest, and the two were soon busied with\nmatters which had a charm for both. A collection of elvans formed the\nstarting-point, and when they had entered upon the wide field of\npalaeontology it was natural for Mr. Warricombe to invite his guest's\nattention to the species of _homalonotus_ which he had had the\nhappiness of identifying some ten years ago--a discovery now recognised\nand chronicled. Though his sympathy was genuine enough, Godwin\nstruggled against an uneasy sense of manifesting excessive\nappreciation. Never oblivious of himself, he could not utter the\nsimplest phrase of admiration without criticising its justice, its\ntone. And at present it behoved him to bear in mind that he was\nconversing with no half-bred sciolist. Mr Warricombe obviously had his\nshare of human weakness, but he was at once a gentleman and a student\nof well-stored mind; insincerity must be very careful if it would not\njar upon his refined ear. So Godwin often checked himself in the\nutterance of what might sound too much like flattery. A young man\ntalking with one much older, a poor man in dialogue with a wealthy,\nmust under any circumstances guard his speech; for one of Godwin's\naggressive idiosyncrasy the task of discretion had peculiar\ndifficulties, and the attitude he had assumed at luncheon still further\ncomplicated the operations of his mind. Only at moments could he speak\nin his true voice, and silence meant for the most part a studious\nrepression of much he would naturally have uttered.\n\nResurgent envy gave him no little trouble. On entering the room, he\ncould not but exclaim to himself, 'How easy for a man to do notable\nwork amid such surroundings! If I were but thus equipped for\ninvestigation!' And as often as his eyes left a particular object to\nmake a general survey, the same thought burned in him. He feared lest\nit should be legible on his countenance.\n\nTaking a pamphlet from the table, Mr. Warricombe, with a humorous\ntwinkle in his eyes, inquired whether Peak read German; the answer\nbeing affirmative:\n\n'Naturally,' he rejoined, 'you could hardly have neglected so important\na language. I, unfortunately, didn't learn it in my youth, and I have\nnever had perseverance enough to struggle with it since. Something led\nme to take down this brochure the other day--an old attempt of mine to\nwrite about the weathering of rocks. It was printed in '76, and no\nsooner had it seen the light than friends of mine wanted to know what I\nmeant by appropriating, without acknowledgement, certain facts quite\nrecently pointed out by Professor Pfaff of Erlangen! Unhappily,\nProfessor Pfaff's results were quite unknown to me, and I had to get\nthem translated. The coincidences, sure enough, were very noticeable.\nJust before you came in, I was reviving that old discomfiture.'\n\nPeak, in glancing over the pages, murmured with a smile:\n\n'_Pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt_!'\n\n'Even so!' exclaimed Mr. Warricombe, laughing with a subdued heartiness\nwhich was one of his pleasant characteristics. And, after a pause, he\ninquired, 'Do you find any time to keep up your classics?'\n\n'By fits and starts. Sometimes I return to them for a month or two.'\n\n'Why, it's pretty much the same with me. Here on my table, for\ninstance, lies Tacitus. I found it mentioned not long ago that the\nfirst sentence of the _Annals_ is a hexameter--did you know it?--and\nwhen I had once got hold of the book I thought it a shabby thing to\nreturn it to the dust of its shelf without reading at least a few\npages. So I have gone on from day to day, with no little enjoyment.\nBuckland, as you probably know, regards these old fellows with scorn.'\n\n'We always differed about that.'\n\n'I can't quite decide whether he is still sincere in all he says about\nthem. Time, I suspect, is mellowing his judgment.'\n\nThey moved to the shelves where Greek and Latin books stood in serried\norder, and only the warning dinner-bell put an end to their sympathetic\ndiscussion of the place such authors should hold in modern educational\nsystems.\n\n'Have they shown you your room?' Mr. Warricombe asked.\n\nBut, as he spoke, the face of his eldest son appeared at the door.\n\n'Your traps have safely arrived, Peak.'\n\nThe bedroom to which Godwin was conducted had a delicious fragrance, of\nsource indeterminable. When he had closed the door, he stood for a few\nmoments looking about him; it was his first experience of the upper\nchambers of houses such as this. Merely to step upon the carpet\nfluttered his senses: merely to breathe the air was a purification.\nLuxury of the rational kind, dictated by regard for health of body and\nsoul, appeared in every detail. On the walls were water-colours,\nscenery of Devon and Cornwall; a hanging book-case held about a score\nof volumes poets, essayists, novelists. Elsewhere, not too prominent,\nlay a Bible and a Prayer-book.\n\nHe dressed, as never before, with leisurely enjoyment of the process.\nWhen the mirror declared him ready, his eyes returned frequently to an\ninspection of the figure he presented, and it seemed to him that he was\nnot unworthy to take his place at the dinner-table. As for his visage,\nmight he not console himself with the assurance that it was of no\ncommon stamp? 'If I met that man in a room, I should be curious about\nhim; I should see at once that he didn't belong to the vulgar; I should\ndesire to hear him speak.' And the Warricombes were not lacking in\ndiscernment. He would compare more than favourably with Mr. Moorhouse,\nwhose aspect, bright and agreeable enough, made no promise of\noriginality.--It must be time to go down. He left the room with an air\nof grave self-confidence.\n\nAt dinner he was careful to attempt no repetition of the display which\nhad done very well at luncheon; it must not be thought that he had the\nhabit of talking for effect. Mrs. Warricombe, unless he mistook, had\nbegun to view him more favourably; her remarks made less distinction\nbetween him and the other guests. But he could not like his hostess; he\nthought her unworthy to be the mother of Sidwell and Fanny, of Buckland\nand Louis; there was a marked strain of the commonplace in her. The\ngirls, costumed for the evening, affected him with a return of the awe\nhe had all but overcome. Sidwell was exquisite in dark colours, her\nsister in white. Miss Moorhouse (addressed by her friends as 'Sylvia')\nlooked older than in the day-time, and had lost something of her\nanimation; possibly the country routine had begun to weary her a little.\n\nPeak was at a vast distance from the hour which saw him alight at\nExeter and begin his ramble about the city. He no longer felt himself\nalone in the world; impossible to revive the mood in which he\ndeliberately planned to consume his economies in a year or two of\ndesert wandering; far other were the anticipations which warmed his\nmind when the after-dinner repose attuned him to unwonted hopefulness.\nThis family were henceforth his friends, and it depended only upon\nhimself to make the connection lasting, with all manner of benefits\neasily imagined. Established in the country, the Warricombes stood to\nhim in quite a different relation from any that could have arisen had\nhe met with them in London. There he would have been nothing more than\na casual dinner-guest, welcomed for the hour and all but forgotten when\nhe had said good-night. For years he had understood that London offered\nhim no prospect of social advancement. But a night passed under this\nroof practically raised him to a level whence he surveyed a rich field\nof possible conquest. With the genial geologist he felt himself on\nexcellent terms, and much of this was ascribable to a singular chance\nwhich had masked his real being, and represented him, with scarce an\neffort of his own, in a light peculiarly attractive to Mr. Warricombe.\nHe was now playing the conscious hypocrite; not a pleasant thing to\nface and accept, but the fault was not his--fate had brought it about.\nAt all events, he aimed at no vulgar profit; his one desire was for\nhuman fellowship; he sought nothing but that solace which every code of\nmorals has deemed legitimate. Let the society which compelled to such\nan expedient bear the burden of its shame.\n\nThat must indeed have been a circle of great intellects amid which\nGodwin Peak felt himself subordinate. He had never known that\nimpression, and in the Warricombe family was no one whom he could\nregard even as his equal. Buckland, doubtless, had some knowledge of\nthe world, and could boast of a free mind; but he lacked subtlety: a\npsychological problem would easily puzzle him. Mr. Warricombe's\nattainments were respectable, but what could be said of a man who had\ndevoted his life to geology, and still (in the year 1884) remained an\northodox member of the Church of England? Godwin, as he sat in the\ndrawing-room and enjoyed its atmosphere of refinement, sincerely held\nhimself of far more account as an intellectual being than all the\npersons about him.\n\nBut if his brain must dwell in solitude his heart might compass worthy\nalliances--the thing most needful to humanity. One may find the\nassociates of his intellect in libraries--the friend of one's emotions\nmust walk in flesh and blood. Earwaker, Moxey--these were in many\nrespects admirable fellows, and he had no little love for them, but the\nworld they represented was womanless, and so of flagrant imperfection.\nOf Marcella Moxey he could not think emotionally; indeed she emphasised\nby her personality the lack which caused his suffering. Sidwell\nWarricombe suggested, more completely than any woman he had yet\nobserved, that companionship without which life must to the end taste\nbitter. His interest in her was not strictly personal; she moved and\nspoke before him as a typical woman, not as the daughter of Martin\nWarricombe and the sister of Buckland. Here at last opened to his view\nthat sphere of female society which he had known as remotely existing,\nthe desperate aim of ambition.\n\nConventional women--but was not the phrase tautological? In the few\nfemales who have liberated their souls, was not much of the woman\ninevitably sacrificed, and would it not be so for long years to come?\nOn the other hand, such a one as Sidwell might be held a perfect\ncreature, perfect in relation to a certain stage of human development.\nLook at her, as she sat conversing with Moorhouse, soft candle-light\nupon her face; compare her on the one hand with an average emancipated\ngirl, on the other with a daughter of the people. How unsatisfying was\nthe former; the latter, how repulsive! Here one had the exquisite mean,\nthe lady as England has perfected her towards the close of this\nnineteenth century. A being of marvellous delicacy, of purest\ninstincts, of unsurpassable sweetness. Who could not detail her\nlimitations, obvious and, in certain moods, irritating enough? These\nwere nothing to the point, unless one would roam the world a hungry\nidealist; and Godwin was weary of the famined pilgrimage.\n\nThe murmur of amiable voices softened him to the reception of all that\nwas good in his present surroundings, and justified in the light of\nsentiment his own dishonour. This English home, was it not surely the\nbest result of civilisation in an age devoted to material progress?\nHere was peace, here was scope for the kindliest emotions. Upon\nhim--the born rebel, the scorner of average mankind, the consummate\negoist--this atmosphere exercised an influence more tranquillising,\nmore beneficent, than even the mood of disinterested study. In the\nworld to which sincerity would condemn him, only the worst elements of\nhis character found nourishment and range; here he was humanised, made\nreceptive of all gentle sympathies. Heroism might point him to an\nunending struggle with adverse conditions, but how was heroism possible\nwithout faith? Absolute faith he had none; he was essentially a\nnegativist, guided by the mere relations of phenomena. Nothing easier\nthan to contemn the mode of life represented by this wealthy middle\nclass; but compare it with other existences conceivable by a thinking\nman, and it was emphatically good. It aimed at placidity, at\nbenevolence, at supreme cleanliness,--things which more than\ncompensated for the absence of higher spirituality. We can be but what\nwe are; these people accepted themselves, and in so doing became\nestimable mortals. No imbecile pretensions exposed them to the rebuke\nof a social satirist; no vulgarity tainted their familiar intercourse.\nTheir allegiance to a worn-out creed was felt as an added grace; thus\nonly could their souls aspire, and the imperfect poetry of their\nnatures be developed.\n\nHe took an opportunity of seating himself by Mrs. Warricombe, with whom\nas yet he had held no continuous dialogue.\n\n'Has there been anything of interest at the London theatres lately?'\nshe asked.\n\n'I know so little of them,' Godwin replied, truthfully. 'It must be\nseveral years since I saw a play.'\n\n'Then in that respect you have hardly become a Londoner.'\n\n'Nor in any other, I believe,' said Peak, with a smile. 'I have lived\nthere ten years, but am far from regarding London as my home. I hope a\nfew months more will release me from it altogether.'\n\n'Indeed!--Perhaps you think of leaving England?'\n\n'I should be very sorry to do that--for any length of time. My wish is\nto settle somewhere in the country, and spend a year or two in quiet\nstudy.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe looked amiable surprise, but corrected herself to\napproving interest.\n\n'I have heard some of our friends say that their minds get unstrung, if\nthey are long away from town, but I should have thought that country\nquietness would be much better than London noise. My husband certainly\nfinds it so.'\n\n'People are very differently constituted,' said Godwin. 'And then it\ndepends much on the nature of one's work.'\n\nUttering these commonplaces with an air of reflection, he observed that\nthey did not cost him the self-contempt which was wont to be his\npenalty for concession to the terms of polite gossip; rather, his mind\naccepted with gratitude this rare repose. He tasted something of the\ntranquil self-content which makes life so enjoyable when one has never\nseen a necessity for shaping original remarks. No one in this room\nwould despise him for a platitude, were it but recommended with a\npleasant smile. With the Moxeys, with Earwaker, he durst not thus have\nspoken.\n\nWhen the hour of separation was at hand, Buckland invited his guest to\nretire with him to a part of the house where they could smoke and chat\ncomfortably.\n\n'Moorhouse and Louis are fagged after their twenty mile stretch this\nmorning; I have caught both of them nodding during the last few\nminutes. We can send them to bed without apology.'\n\nHe led the way upstairs to a region of lumber-rooms, whence a narrow\nflight of steps brought them into a glass-house, octangular and with\npointed tops, out upon the roof. This, he explained, had been built\nsome twenty years ago, at a time when Mr. Warricombe amused himself\nwith photography. A few indications of its original purposes were still\nnoticeable; an easel and a box of oil-colours showed that\nsomeone--doubtless of the younger generation--had used it as a\npainting-room; a settee and deep cane chairs made it an inviting lounge\non a warm evening like the present, when, by throwing open a hinged\nwall, one looked forth into the deep sky and tasted the air from the\nsea.\n\n'Sidwell used to paint a little,' said Buckland, as his companion bent\nto examine a small canvas on which a landscape was roughed in. It lay\non a side table, and was half concealed by an ordnance map, left\nunfolded. 'For the last year or two I think she has given it up. I'm\nafraid we are not strong in matters of art. Neither of the girls can\nplay very well, though of course they both tinkle for their own\namusement. Maurice--the poor lad who was killed--gave a good deal of\nartistic promise; father keeps some little water-colours of his, which\nmen in that line have praised--perhaps sincerely.'\n\n'I remember you used to speak slightingly of art,' said Godwin, as he\ntook an offered cigar.\n\n'Did I? And of a good many other things, I daresay. It was my habit at\none time, I believe, to grow heated in scorn of Euclid's definitions.\nWhat an interesting book Euclid is! Half a year ago, I was led by a\ntalk with Moorhouse to go through some of the old \"props\", and you\ncan't imagine how they delighted me. Moorhouse was so obliging as to\ntell me that I had an eminently deductive mind.'\n\nHe laughed, but not without betraying some pleasure in the remark.\n\n'Surprising,' he went on, 'how very little such a mind as Moorhouse's\nsuggests itself in common conversation. He is really profound in\nmathematics, a man of original powers, but I never heard him make a\nremark of the slightest value on any other subject. Now his sister--she\nhas studied nothing in particular, yet she can't express an opinion\nthat doesn't bear the stamp of originality.'\n\nGodwin was contented to muse, his eyes fixed on a brilliant star in the\nwestern heaven.\n\n'There's only one inconsistency in her that annoys and puzzles me,'\nBuckland pursued, speaking with the cigar in his mouth. 'In religion,\nshe seems to be orthodox. True, we have never spoken on the subject,\nbut--well, she goes to church, and carries prayer-books. I don't know\nhow to explain it. Hypocrisy is the last thing one could suspect her\nof. I'm sure she hates it in every form. And such a clear brain!--I\ncan't understand it.'\n\nThe listener was still star-gazing. He had allowed his cigar, after the\nfirst few puffs, to smoulder untasted; his lips were drawn into an\nexpression very unlike the laxity appropriate to pleasurable smoking.\nWhen the murmur of the pines had for a moment been audible, he said,\nwith a forced smile:\n\n'I notice you take for granted that a clear brain and religious\northodoxy are incompatible.'\n\nThe other gave him a keen look.\n\n'Hardly,' was Buckland's reply, spoken with less ingenuousness of tone\nthan usual. 'I say that Miss Moorhouse has undeniably a strong mind,\nand that it is impossible to suspect her of the slightest hypocrisy.'\n\n'Whence the puzzle that keeps you occupied,' rejoined Peak, in a voice\nthat sounded like assumption of superiority, though the accent had an\nagreeable softness.\n\nWarricombe moved as if impatiently, struck a match to rekindle his\nweed, blew tumultuous clouds, and finally put a blunt question:\n\n'What do you think about it yourself?'\n\n'From my point of view, there is no puzzle at all,' Godwin replied, in\na very clear voice, smiling as he met the other's look.\n\n'How am I to understand that?' asked Buckland, good-naturedly, though\nwith a knitting of his brows.\n\n'Not as a doubt of Miss Moorhouse's sincerity. I can't see that a\nbelief in the Christian religion is excluded by any degree of\nintellectual clearness.'\n\n'No--your views have changed, Peak?'\n\n'On many subjects, this among them.'\n\n'I see.'\n\nThe words fell as if involuntarily from Warricombe's lips. He gazed at\nthe floor awhile, then, suddenly looking up, exclaimed:\n\n'It would be civil to accept this without surprise, but it is too much\nfor me. How has it come about?'\n\n'That would take me a long time to explain.'\n\n'Then,' pursued his companion, watching him closely, 'you were quite in\nsympathy with that exposition you gave at lunch today?'\n\n'Quite. I hope there was nothing in my way of speaking that made you\nthink otherwise?'\n\n'Nothing at all. I couldn't help wondering what it meant. You seemed\nperfectly in earnest, yet such talk had the oddest sound on your\nlips--to me, I mean. Of course I thought of you as I used to know you.'\n\n'Naturally.' Peak was now in an attitude of repose, his legs crossed,\nthumb and forefinger stroking his chin. 'I couldn't very well turn\naside to comment on my own mental history.'\n\nHere again was the note of something like genial condescension.\nBuckland seemed sensible of it, and slightly raised his eyebrows.\n\n'I am to understand that you have become strictly orthodox in matters\nof religious faith?'\n\n'The proof is,' replied Godwin, 'that I hope before long to take\nOrders.'\n\nAgain there was silence, and again the sea-breath made its whispering\nin the pines. Warricombe, with a sudden gesture, pointed towards the\nsky.\n\n'A shooting star--one of the brightest I ever saw!'\n\n'I missed it,' said Peak, just glancing in that direction.\n\nThe interruption enabled Buckland to move his chair; in this new\nposition he was somewhat further from Peak, and had a better view of\nhis face.\n\n'I should never have imagined you a clergyman,' he said, thoughtfully,\n'but I can see that your mind has been developing powers in that\ndirection.--Well, so be it! I can only hope you have found your true\nwork in life.'\n\n'But you doubt it?'\n\n'I can't say that I doubt it, as I can't understand you. To be sure, we\nhave been parted for many years. In some respects I must seem much\nchanged'--\n\n'Greatly changed,' Godwin put in, promptly.\n\n'Yes,' pursued the other, correctively, 'but not in a way that would\nseem incredible to anyone whatever. I am conscious of growth in\ntolerance, but my attitude in essentials is unchanged. Thinking of\nyou--as I have often enough done--I always kept the impression you made\non me when we were both lads; you seemed most distinctly a modern\nmind--one of the most modern that ever came under my notice. Now, I\ndon't find it impossible to understand my father, when he reconciles\nscience with religion; he was born sixty years ago. But Godwin Peak as\na--a--'\n\n'Parson,' supplied Peak, drily.\n\n'Yes, as a parson--I shall have to meditate much before I grasp the\nnotion.'\n\n'Perhaps you have dropped your philosophical studies?' said Godwin,\nwith a smile of courteous interest.\n\n'I don't know. Metaphysics have no great interest for me, but I\nphilosophise in a way. I thought myself a student of human nature, at\nall events.'\n\n'But you haven't kept up with philosophical speculation on the points\ninvolved in orthodox religion?'\n\n'I confess my ignorance of everything of the kind--unless you include\nBishop Blougram among the philosophers?'\n\nGodwin bore the gaze which accompanied this significant inquiry. For a\nmoment he smiled, but there followed an expression of gravity touched\nwith pain.\n\n'I hadn't thought of broaching this matter,' he said, with slow\nutterance, but still in a tone of perfect friendliness. 'Let us put it\naside.'\n\nWarricombe seemed to make an effort, and his next words had the accent\nof well-bred consideration which distinguished his ordinary talk.\n\n'Pray forgive my bad joke. I merely meant that I have no right whatever\nto argue with anyone who has given serious attention to such things.\nThey are altogether beyond my sphere. I was born an agnostic, and no\nsubtlety of demonstration could incline me for a moment to theological\nviews; my intellect refuses to admit a single preliminary of such\narguments. You astonish me, and that's all I am justified in saying.'\n\n'My dear Warricombe, you are justified in saying whatever your mind\nsuggests. That is one of the principles which I hold unaltered--let me\nbe quite frank with you. I should never have decided upon such a step\nas this, but for the fact that I have managed to put by a small sum of\nmoney which will make me independent for two or three years. Till quite\nlately I hadn't a thought of using my freedom in this way; it was clear\nto me that I must throw over the old drudgery at Rotherhithe, but this\nresolve which astonishes you had not yet ripened--I saw it only as one\nof the possibilities of my life. Well, now, it's only too true that\nthere's something of speculation in my purpose; I look to the Church,\nnot only as a congenial sphere of activity, but as a means of\nsubsistence. In a man of no fortune this is inevitable; I hope there is\nnothing to be ashamed of. Even if the conditions of the case allowed\nit, I shouldn't present myself for ordination forthwith; I must study\nand prepare myself in quietness. How the practical details will be\narranged, I can't say; I have no family influence, and I must hope to\nmake friends who will open a way for me. I have always lived apart from\nsociety; but that isn't natural to me, and it becomes more distasteful\nthe older I grow. The probability is that I shall settle somewhere in\nthe country, where I can live decently on a small income. After all,\nit's better I should have let you know this at once. I only realised a\nfew minutes ago that to be silent about my projects was in a way to be\nguilty of false pretences.'\n\nThe adroitness of this last remark, which directed itself, with such\nshow of candour, against a suspicion precisely the opposite of that\nlikely to be entertained by the listener, succeeded in disarming\nWarricombe; he looked up with a smile of reassurance, and spoke\nencouragingly.\n\n'About the practical details I don't think you need have any anxiety.\nIt isn't every day that the Church of England gets such a recruit. Let\nme suggest that you have a talk with my father.'\n\nPeak reflected on the proposal, and replied to it with grave\nthoughtfulness:\n\n'That's very kind of you, but I should have a difficulty in asking Mr.\nWarricombe's advice. I'm afraid I must go on in my own way for a time.\nIt will be a few months, I daresay, before I can release myself from my\nengagements in London.'\n\n'But I am to understand that your mind is really made up?'\n\n'Oh, quite!'\n\n'Well, no doubt we shall have opportunities of talking. We must meet in\ntown, if possible. You have excited my curiosity, and I can't help\nhoping you'll let me see a little further into your mind some day. When\nI first got hold of Newman's _Apologia_, I began to read it with the\nutmost eagerness, flattering myself that now at length I should\nunderstand how a man of brains could travel such a road. I was horribly\ndisappointed, and not a little enraged, when I found that he began by\nassuming the very beliefs I thought he was going to justify. In you I\nshall hope for more logic.'\n\n'Newman is incapable of understanding such an objection,' said Peak,\nwith a look of amusement.\n\n'But you are not.'\n\nThe dialogue grew chatty. When they exchanged good-night, Peak fancied\nthat the pressure of Buckland's hand was less fervent than at their\nmeeting, but his manner no longer seemed to indicate distrust. Probably\nthe agnostic's mood was one of half-tolerant disdain.\n\nGodwin turned the key in his bedroom door, and strayed aimlessly about.\nHe was fatigued, but the white, fragrant bed did not yet invite him; a\nturbulence in his brain gave warning that it would be long before he\nslept. He wound up his watch; the hands pointed to twelve. Chancing to\ncome before the mirror, he saw that he was unusually pale, and that his\neyes had a swollen look.\n\nThe profound stillness was oppressive to him; he started nervously at\nan undefined object in a dim corner, and went nearer to examine it; he\nwas irritable, vaguely discontented, and had even a moment of nausea,\nperhaps the result of tobacco stronger than he was accustomed to smoke.\nAfter leaning for five minutes at the open window, he felt a soothing\neffect from the air, and could think consecutively of the day's events.\nWhat had happened seemed to him incredible; it was as though he revived\na mad dream, of ludicrous coherence. Since his display of rhetoric at\nluncheon all was downright somnambulism. What fatal power had subdued\nhim? What extraordinary influence had guided his tongue, constrained\nhis features? His conscious self had had no part in all this comedy;\nnow for the first time was he taking count of the character he had\nplayed.\n\nHad he been told this morning that--Why, what monstrous folly was all\nthis? Into what unspeakable baseness had he fallen? Happily, he had but\nto take leave of the Warricombe household, and rush into some region\nwhere he was unknown. Years hence, he would relate the story to\nEarwaker.\n\nFor a long time he suffered the torments of this awakening. Shame\nbuffeted him on the right cheek and the left; he looked about like one\nwho slinks from merited chastisement. Oh, thrice ignoble varlet! To\npose with unctuous hypocrisy before people who had welcomed him under\ntheir roof, unquestioned, with all the grace and kindliness of English\nhospitality! To lie shamelessly in the face of his old fellow-student,\nwho had been so genuinely glad to meet him again!\n\nYet such possibility had not been unforeseen. At the times of his\nprofound gloom, when solitude and desire crushed his spirit, he had\nwished that fate would afford him such an opportunity of knavish\nsuccess. His imagination had played with the idea that a man like\nhimself might well be driven to this expedient, and might even use it\nwith life-long result. Of a certainty, the Church numbered such men\namong her priests,--not mere lukewarm sceptics who made religion a\nsource of income, nor yet those who had honestly entered the portal and\nby necessity were held from withdrawing, though their convictions had\nchanged; but deliberate schemers from the first, ambitious but hungry\nnatures, keen-sighted, unscrupulous. And they were at no loss to defend\nthemselves against the attack of conscience. Life is a terrific\nstruggle for all who begin it with no endowments save their brains. A\nhypocrite was not necessarily a harm-doer; easy to picture the\nunbelieving priest whose influence was vastly for good, in word and\ndeed.\n\nBut he, he who had ever prided himself on his truth-fronting intellect,\nand had freely uttered his scorn of the credulous mob! He who was his\nown criterion of moral right and wrong! No wonder he felt like a\nwhipped cur. It was the ancestral vice in his blood, brought out by\nover-tempting circumstance. The long line of base-born predecessors,\nthe grovelling hinds and mechanics of his genealogy, were responsible\nfor this. Oh for a name wherewith honour was hereditary!\n\nHis eyes were blinded by a rush of hot tears. Down, down--into the\ndepths of uttermost despondency, of self-pity and self-contempt! Had it\nbeen practicable, he would have fled from the house, leaving its\noccupants to think of him as they would; even as, ten years ago, he had\nfled from the shame impending over him at Kingsmill. A cowardly\ninstinct, this; having once acted upon it gave to his whole life a\ntaint of craven meanness. Mere bluster, all his talk of mental dignity\nand uncompromising scorn of superstitions. A weak and idle man, whose\nbest years were already wasted!\n\nHe gazed deliberately at himself in the glass, at his red eyelids and\nunsightly lips. Darkness was best; perhaps he might forget his shame\nfor an hour or two, ere the dawn renewed it. He threw off his garments\nheedlessly, extinguished the lamp, and crept into the ready\nhiding-place.\n\n\n\n\nPart III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n'Why are you obstinately silent? [wrote Earwaker, in a letter addressed\nto Godwin at his Peckham lodgings]. I take it for granted that you must\nby this time be back from your holiday. Why haven't you replied to my\nletter of a fortnight ago? Nothing yet from _The Critical_. If you are\nreally at work as usual, come and see me to-morrow evening, any time\nafter eight. The posture of my affairs grows dubious; the shadow of\nKenyon thickens about me. In all seriousness I think I shall be driven\nfrom _The Weekly Post_ before long. My quarrels with Runcorn are too\nfrequent, and his blackguardism keeps more than pace with the times.\nCome or write, for I want to know how things go with you.\n\n_Tuissimus_, J.E.E.'\n\nPeak read this at breakfast on a Saturday morning. It was early in\nSeptember, and three weeks had elapsed since his return from the west\nof England. Upon the autumn had fallen a blight of cold and rainy\nweather, which did not enhance the cheerfulness of daily journeying\nbetween Peckham Rye and Rotherhithe. When it was necessary for him to\nset forth to the train, he muttered imprecations, for a mood of\ninactivity possessed him; he would gladly have stayed in his\ncomfortable sitting-room, idling over books or only occupied with\nlanguid thought.\n\nIn the afternoon he was at liberty to follow his impulse, and this\ndirected him to the British Museum, whither of late he had several\ntimes resorted as a reader. Among the half-dozen books for which he\napplied was one in German, Reusch's _Bibel und Natur_. After a little\ndallying, he became absorbed in this work, and two or three hours\npassed before its hold on his attention slackened. He seldom changed\nhis position; the volume was propped against others, and he sat bending\nforward, his arms folded upon the desk. When he was thus deeply\nengaged, his face had a hard, stern aspect; if by chance his eye\nwandered for a moment, its look seemed to express resentment of\ninterruption.\n\nAt length he threw himself back with a sudden yielding to weariness,\ncrossed his legs, sank together in the chair, and for half-an-hour\nbrooded darkly. A fit of yawning admonished him that it was time to\nquit the atmosphere of study. He betook himself to a restaurant in the\nStrand, and thence about eight o'clock made his way to Staple Inn,\nwhere the journalist gave him cheerful welcome.\n\n'Day after day I have meant to write,' thus he excused himself. 'But I\nhad really nothing to say.'\n\n'You don't look any better for your holiday,' Earwaker remarked.\n\n'Holiday? Oh, I had forgotten all about it. When do _you_ go?'\n\n'The situation is comical. I feel sure that if I leave town, my\nconnection with the _Post_ will come to an end. I shall have a note\nfrom Runcorn saying that we had better take this opportunity of\nterminating my engagement. On the whole I should be glad, yet I can't\nmake up my mind to be ousted by Kenyon--that's what it means. They want\nto get me away, but I stick on, postponing holiday from week to week.\nRuncorn can't decide to send me about my business, yet every leader I\nwrite enrages him. But for Kenyon, I should gain my point; I feel sure\nof it. It's one of those cases in which homicide would be justified by\npublic interest. If Kenyon gets my place, the paper becomes at once an\norgan of ruffiandom, the delight of the blackguardry.'\n\n'How's the circulation?' inquired Peak.\n\n'Pretty sound; that adds to the joke. This series of stories by\nDoubleday has helped us a good deal, and my contention is, if we can\nkeep financially right by help of this kind, why not make a little\nsacrifice for the sake of raising our political tone? Runcorn won't see\nit; he listens eagerly to Kenyon's assurance that we might sell several\nthousand more by striking the true pot-house note.'\n\n'Then pitch the thing over! Wash your hands, and go to cleaner work.'\n\n'The work I am doing is clean enough,' replied Earwaker. 'Let me have\nmy way, and I can make the paper a decent one and a useful one. I\nshan't easily find another such chance.'\n\n'Your idealism has a strong root,' said Godwin, rather contemptuously.\n'I half envy you. There must be a distinct pleasure in believing that\nany intellectual influence will exalt the English democracy.'\n\n'I'm not sure that I do believe it, but I enjoy the experiment. The\nchief pleasure, I suppose, is in fighting Runcorn and Kenyon.'\n\n'They are too strong for you, Earwaker. They have the spirit of the age\nto back them up.'\n\nThe journalist became silent; he smiled, but the harassment of conflict\nmarked his features.\n\n'I hear nothing about \"The New Sophistry\",' he remarked, when Godwin\nhad begun to examine some books that lay on the table. 'Dolby has the\ntrick of keeping manuscripts a long time. Everything that seems at the\nfirst glance tolerable, he sends to the printer, then muses over it at\nhis leisure. Probably your paper is in type.'\n\n'I don't care a rap whether it is or not. What do you think of this\nbook of Oldwinkle's?'\n\nHe was holding a volume of humorous stories, which had greatly taken\nthe fancy of the public.\n\n'It's uncommonly good,' replied the journalist, laughing. 'I had a\nprejudice against the fellow, but he has overcome me. It's more than\ngood farce--something like really strong humour here and there.'\n\n'I quite believe it,' said Peak, 'yet I couldn't read a page. Whatever\nthe mob enjoys is at once spoilt for me, however good I should\notherwise think it. I am sick of seeing and hearing the man's name.'\n\nEarwaker shook his head in deprecation.\n\n'Narrow, my boy. One must be able to judge and enjoy impartially.'\n\n'I know it, but I shall never improve. This book seems to me to have a\nbad smell; it looks mauled with dirty fingers. I despise Oldwinkle for\nhis popularity. To make them laugh, and to laugh _with_ them--pah!'\n\nThey debated this point for some time, Peak growing more violent,\nthough his friend preserved a smiling equanimity. A tirade of virulent\ncontempt, in which Godwin exhibited all his powers of savage eloquence,\nwas broken by a visitor's summons at the door.\n\n'Here's Malkin,' said the journalist; 'you'll see each other at last.'\n\nPeak could not at once command himself to the look and tone desirable\nin meeting a stranger; leaning against the mantelpiece, he gazed with a\nscowl of curiosity at the man who presented himself, and when he shook\nhands, it was in silence. But Malkin made speech from the others\nunnecessary for several minutes. With animated voice and gesture, he\npoured forth apologies for his failure to keep the appointment of six\nor seven weeks ago.\n\n'Only the gravest call of duty could have kept me away, I do assure\nyou! No doubt Earwaker has informed you of the circumstances. I\ntelegraphed--I think I telegraphed; didn't I, Earwaker?'\n\n'I have some recollection of a word or two of scant excuse,' replied\nthe journalist.\n\n'But I implore you to consider the haste I was in,' cried Malkin; 'not\nfive minutes, Mr. Peak, to book, to register luggage, to do everything;\nnot five minutes, I protest! But here we are at last. Let us talk! Let\nus talk!'\n\nHe seated himself with an air of supreme enjoyment, and began to cram\nthe bowl of a large pipe from a bulky pouch.\n\n'How stands the fight with Kenyon and Co.?' he cried, as soon as the\ntobacco was glowing.\n\nEarwaker briefly repeated what he had told Peak.\n\n'Hold out! No surrender and no compromise! What's your opinion, Mr\nPeak, on the abstract question? Is a popular paper likely, or not, to\nbe damaged in its circulation by improvement of style and tone--within\nthe limits of discretion?'\n\n'I shouldn't be surprised if it were,' Peak answered, drily.\n\n'I'm afraid you're right. There's no use in blinking truths, however\ndisagreeable. But, for Earwaker, that isn't the main issue. What he has\nto do is to assert himself. Every man's first duty is to assert\nhimself. At all events, this is how I regard the matter. I am all for\nindividualism, for the development of one's personality at whatever\ncost. No compromise on points of faith! Earwaker has his ideal of\njournalistic duty, and in a fight with fellows like Runcorn and Kenyon\nhe must stand firm as a rock.'\n\n'I can't see that he's called upon to fight at all,' said Peak. 'He's\nin a false position; let him get out of it.'\n\n'A false position? I can't see that. No man better fitted than Earwaker\nto raise the tone of Radical journalism. Here's a big Sunday newspaper\npractically in his hands; it seems to me that the circumstances give\nhim a grand opportunity of making his force felt. What are we all\nseeking but an opportunity for striking out with effect?'\n\nGodwin listened with a sceptical smile, and made answer in slow,\ncareless tones.\n\n'Earwaker happens to be employed and paid by certain capitalists to\nincrease the sale of their paper.'\n\n'My dear sir!' cried the other, bouncing upon his seat. 'How can you\ntake such a view? A great newspaper surely cannot be regarded as a mere\nsource of income. These capitalists declare that they have at heart the\ninterests of the working classes; so has Earwaker, and he is far better\nable than they to promote those interests. His duty is to apply their\nmoney to the best use, morally speaking. If he were lukewarm in the\nmatter, I should be the first to advise his retirement; but this fight\nis entirely congenial to him. I trust he will hold his own to the last\npossible moment.'\n\n'You must remember,' put in the journalist, with a look of amusement,\n'that Peak has no sympathy with Radicalism.'\n\n'I lament it, but that does not affect my argument. If you were a high\nTory, I should urge you just as strongly to assert yourself. Surely you\nagree with this point of mine, Mr. Peak? You admit that a man must\ndevelop whatever strength is in him.'\n\n'I'm not at all sure of that.'\n\nMalkin fixed himself sideways in the chair, and examined his\ncollocutor's face earnestly. He endeavoured to subdue his excitement to\nthe tone of courteous debate, but the words that at length escaped him\nwere humorously blunt.\n\n'Then of what _are_ you sure?'\n\n'Of nothing.'\n\n'Now we touch bottom!' cried Malkin. 'Philosophically speaking, I agree\nwith you. But we have to live our lives, and I suppose we must direct\nourselves by some conscious principle.'\n\n'I don't see the necessity,' Peak replied, still in an impassive tone.\n'We may very well be guided by circumstances as they arise. To be sure,\nthere's a principle in that, but I take it you mean something\ndifferent.'\n\n'Yes I do. I hold that the will must direct circumstances, not receive\nits impulse from them. How, then, are we to be guided? What do you set\nbefore yourself?'\n\n'To get through life with as much satisfaction and as little pain as\npossible.'\n\n'You are a hedonist, then. Well and good! Then that is your conscious\nprinciple'--\n\n'No, it isn't.'\n\n'How am I to understand you?'\n\n'By recognising that a man's intellectual and moral principles as\nlikely as not tend to anything but his happiness.'\n\n'I can't admit it!' exclaimed Malkin, leaping from his chair. 'What\n_is_ happiness?'\n\n'I don't know.'\n\n'Earwaker, _what_ is happiness? What _is_ happiness?'\n\n'I really don't know,' answered the journalist, mirthfully.\n\n'This is trifling with a grave question. We all know perfectly well\nthat happiness is the conscious exertion of individual powers. Why is\nthere so much suffering under our present social system? Because the\nmajority of men are crushed to a dead level of mechanical toil, with no\nopportunity of developing their special faculties. Give a man scope,\nand happiness is put within his reach.'\n\n'What do you mean by scope?' inquired Godwin.\n\n'Scope? Scope? Why, room to expand. The vice of our society is\nhypocrisy; it comes of over-crowding. When a man isn't allowed to be\nhimself, he takes refuge in a mean imitation of those other men who\nappear to be better off. That was what sent me off to South America. I\ngot into politics, and found that I was in danger of growing dishonest,\nof compromising, and toadying. In the wilderness, I found myself\nagain.--Do you seriously believe that happiness can be obtained by\nignoring one's convictions?'\n\nHe addressed the question to both, snuffing the air with head thrown\nback.\n\n'What if you have no convictions?' asked Peak.\n\n'Then you are incapable of happiness in any worthy sense! You may\ngraze, but you will never feast.'\n\nThe listeners joined in laughter, and Malkin, after a moment's\nhesitation, allowed his face to relax in good-humoured sympathy.\n\n'Now look here!' he cried. 'You--Earwaker; suppose you sent conscience\nto the devil, and set yourself to please Runcorn by increasing the\ncirculation of your paper by whatever means. You would flourish,\nundoubtedly. In a short time you would be chief editor, and your\npockets would burst with money. But what about your peace of mind? What\nabout happiness?'\n\n'Why, I'm disposed to agree with Peak,' answered the journalist. 'If I\n_could_ take that line, I should be a happier man than\nconscientiousness will ever make me.'\n\nMalkin swelled with indignation.\n\n'You don't mean it! You are turning a grave argument into\njest!--Where's my hat? Where the devil is my hat? Send for me again\nwhen you are disposed to talk seriously.'\n\nHe strode towards the door, but Earwaker arrested him with a shout.\n\n'You're leaving your pipe!'\n\n'So I am. Where is it?--Did I tell you where I bought this pipe?'\n\n'No. What's the wood?'\n\nOn the instant Malkin fell into a cheerful vein of reminiscence. In\nfive minutes he was giving a rapturous description of tropical scenes,\nlaughing joyously as he addressed now one now the other of his\ncompanions.\n\n'I hear you have a mind to see those countries, Mr. Peak,' he said at\nlength. 'If you care for a travelling companion--rather short-tempered,\nbut you'll pardon that--pray give me the preference. I should enjoy\nabove all things to travel with a man of science.'\n\n'It's very doubtful whether I shall ever get so far,' Godwin replied,\nmusingly.\n\nAnd, as he spoke, he rose to take leave. Earwaker's protest that it was\nnot yet ten o'clock did not influence him.\n\n'I want to reflect on the meaning of happiness,' he said, extending his\nhand to Malkin; and, in spite of the smile, his face had a sombre cast.\n\nThe two who were left of course discussed him.\n\n'You won't care much for Peak,' said Earwaker. 'He and I suit each\nother, because there's a good deal of indifferentism in both of us.\nMoral earnestness always goes against the grain with him; I've noticed\nit frequently.'\n\n'I'm sorry I spoke so dogmatically. It wasn't altogether good manners.\nSuppose I write him a short letter, just expressing my regret for\nhaving been led away'--\n\n'Needless, needless,' laughed the journalist. 'He thinks all the better\nof you for your zeal. But happiness is a sore point with him; few men,\nI should think, have known less of it. I can't imagine any\ncircumstances which would make him thoroughly at peace with himself and\nthe world.'\n\n'Poor fellow! You can see something of that in his face. Why doesn't he\nget married?'\n\n'A remarkable suggestion!--By the way, why don't _you_?'.\n\n'My dear boy, there's nothing I wish more, but it's a business of such\nfearful precariousness. I'm one of those men whom marriage will either\nmake or ruin. You know my characteristics; the slightest check upon my\nindependence, and all's up with me. The woman I marry must be perfectly\nreasonable, perfectly good-tempered; she must have excellent education,\nand every delicacy of breeding. Where am I to find this paragon?'\n\n'Society is open to you.'\n\n'True, but I am not open to society. I don't take kindly to the people\nof my own class. No, I tell you what--my only chance of getting a\nsuitable wife is to train some very young girl for the purpose. Don't\nmisunderstand me, for heaven's sake! I mean that I must make a\nfriendship with some schoolgirl in whose education I can have a voice,\nwhose relatives will permit me to influence her mind and develop her\ncharacter. What do you think of this idea?'\n\n'Not bad, but it demands patience.'\n\n'And who more patient than I? But let us talk of that poor Mrs. Jacox\nand her girls. You feel that you know them pretty well from my letters,\ndon't you? Nothing more monstrous can be imagined than the treatment to\nwhich this poor woman has been subjected! I couldn't have believed that\nsuch dishonesty and brutality were possible in English families of\ndecent position. Her husband deserted her, her brother robbed her, her\nsister-in-law libelled her,--the whole story is nauseating!'\n\n'You're quite sure that she tells you the truth?'\n\nMalkin glared with sudden resentment.\n\n'The truth? What! you also desire to calumniate her? For shame,\nEarwaker! A poor widow toiling to support herself in a foreign country,\nwith two children dependent on her.'\n\n'Yes, yes, yes; but you seem to know very little of her.'\n\n'I know her perfectly, and all her circumstances!'\n\nMrs. Jacox was the mother of the two girls whom Malkin had escorted to\nRouen, after an hour or so of all but casual acquaintance. She and her\nhistory had come in a very slight degree under the notice of certain\ngood-natured people with whom Malkin was on friendly terms, and hearing\nthat the children, Bella and Lily, aged fourteen and twelve\nrespectively, were about to undertake alone a journey to the Continent,\nthe erratic hero felt it incumbent upon him to see them safe at their\nmother's side. Instead of returning forthwith, he lingered in Normandy\nfor several weeks, striking off at length, on the summons of a friend,\nto Orleans, whence he was only to-day returned. Two or three letters\nhad kept Earwaker informed of his movements. Of Mrs. Jacox he wrote as\nhe now spoke, with compassionate respect, and the girls, according to\nhim, were exquisite models of budding maidenhood.\n\n'You haven't told me,' said Earwaker, calmly fronting the indignant\noutburst, 'what her circumstances are--at present.'\n\n'She assists an English lady in the management of a boardinghouse,'\nMalkin replied, with an air which forbade trivial comment. 'Bella and\nLily will of course continue their studies. I daresay I shall run over\nnow and then to see them.'\n\n'May I, without offence, inquire if either of these young ladies seems\nsuitable for the ideal training of which you spoke?'\n\nMalkin smiled thoughtfully. He stood with his legs apart and stroked\nhis blond beard.\n\n'The surmise is not unnatural. Well, I confess that Bella has inspired\nme with no little interest. She is rather mature, unfortunately; I wish\nshe had been Lily's age. We shall see; we shall see.'\n\nMusing, he refilled his pipe, and gossip was prolonged till something\nafter one o'clock. Malkin was never known to retire willingly from an\nevening's congenial talk until the small hours were in progress.\n\nPeak, on reaching home about eleven, was surprised to see a light in\nhis sitting-room window. As he entered, his landlady informed him that\nMr. Moxey had been waiting upstairs for an hour or two. Christian was\nreading. He laid down the book and rose languidly. His face was\nflushed, and he spoke with a laugh which suggested that a fit of\ndespondency (as occasionally happened) had tempted him to excess in\ncordials. Godwin understood these signs. He knew that his friend's\nintellect was rather brightened than impaired by such stimulus, and he\naffected not to be conscious of any peculiarity.\n\n'As you wouldn't come to me,' Christian began, 'I had no choice but to\ncome to you. My visit isn't unwelcome, I hope?'\n\n'Certainly not. But how are you going to get home? You know the time?'\n\n'Don't trouble. I shan't go to bed to-night. Let me sit here and read,\nwill you? If I feel tired I can lie down on the sofa. What a delightful\nbook this is! I must get it.'\n\nIt was a history of the Italian Renaissance, recently published.\n\n'Where does this phrase come from?' he continued, pointing to a scrap\nof paper, used as a book-mark, on which Godwin had pencilled a note.\nThe words were: '_Foris ut moris, intus ut libet_.'\n\n'It's mentioned there,' Peak replied, 'as the motto of those humanists\nwho outwardly conformed to the common faith.'\n\n'I see. All very well when the Inquisition was flourishing, but sounds\nignoble nowadays.'\n\n'Do you think so? In a half-civilised age, whether the sixteenth or the\nnineteenth century, a wise man may do worse than adopt it.'\n\n'Better be honest, surely?'\n\nPeak stood for a moment as if in doubt, then exclaimed irritably:\n\n'Honest? Honest? Who is or can be honest? Who truly declares himself?\nWhen a man has learnt that truth is indeterminable, how is it more\nmoral to go about crying that you don't believe a certain dogma than to\nconcede that the dogma may possibly be true? This new morality of the\nagnostics is mere paltry conceit. Why must I make solemn declaration\nthat I don't believe in absolute knowledge? I might as well be called\nupon to inform all my acquaintances how I stand with regard to the\ntheories of chemical affinity. One's philosophy has nothing to do with\nthe business of life. If I chose to become a Church of England\nclergyman, what moral objection could be made?'\n\nThis illustration was so amusing to Moxey, that his surprise at what\npreceded gave way to laughter.\n\n'I wonder,' he exclaimed, 'that you never seriously thought of a\nprofession for which you are so evidently cut out.'\n\nGodwin kept silence; his face had darkened, and he seated himself with\nsullen weariness.\n\n'Tell me what you've been doing,' resumed Moxey. 'Why haven't I heard\nfrom you?'\n\n'I should have come in a day or two. I thought you were probably out of\ntown.'\n\n'Her husband is ill,' said the other, by way of reply. He leaned\nforward with his arms upon the table, and gazed at Godwin with eyes of\npeculiar brightness.\n\n'Ill, is he?' returned Godwin, with slow interest. 'In the same way as\nbefore?'\n\n'Yes, but much worse.'\n\nChristian paused; and when he again spoke it was hurriedly, confusedly.\n\n'How can I help getting excited about it? How can I behave decently?\nYou're the only man I ever speak to on the subject, and no doubt I both\nweary and disgust you; but I _must_ speak to some one. My nerves are\nstrung beyond endurance; it's only by speaking that I can ease myself\nfrom the intolerable strain.'\n\n'Have you seen her lately?'\n\n'Yesterday, for a moment, in the street. It's ten months since the last\nmeeting.'\n\n'Well,' remarked Godwin, abruptly, 'it's probable the man will die one\nof these days, then your trials will have a happy end. I see no harm in\nhoping that his life may be short--that's a conventional feeling. If\ntwo people can be benefited by the death of a single person, why\nshouldn't we be glad in the prospect of his dying? Not of his\nsuffering--that's quite another thing. But die he must; and to curtail\nthe life of a being who at length wholly ceases to exist is no injury.\nYou can't injure a nonentity. Do you think I should take it ill if I\nknew that some persons were wishing my death? Why, look, if ever I\ncrush a little green fly that crawls upon me in the fields, at once I\nam filled with envy of its fate--sincerest envy. To have passed so\nsuddenly from being into nothingness--how blessed an extinction! To\nfeel in that way, instinctively, in the very depths of your soul, is to\nbe a true pessimist. If I had ever doubted my sincerity in pessimism,\nthis experience, several times repeated, would have reassured me.'\n\nChristian covered his face, and brooded for a long time, whilst Godwin\nsat with his eyes on vacancy.\n\n'Come and see us to-morrow,' said the former, at length.\n\n'Perhaps.';\n\n'Why do you keep away?'\n\n'I'm in no mood for society.'\n\n'We'll have no one. Only Marcella and I.'\n\nAgain a long silence.\n\n'Marcella is going in for comparative philology,' Christian resumed,\nwith the gentle tone in which he invariably spoke of his sister. 'What\na mind that girl has! I never knew any woman of half her powers.'\n\nGodwin said nothing.\n\n'No,' continued the other fervently, 'nor of half her goodness. I\nsometimes think that no mortal could come nearer to our ideal of moral\njustice and purity. If it were not for her, I should long ago have gone\nto perdition, in one way or another. It's her strength, not my own,\nthat has saved me. I daresay you know this?'\n\n'There's some truth in it, I believe,' Peak answered, his eye wandering.\n\n'See how circumstances can affect one's judgment. If, just about the\ntime I first knew you, I had abandoned myself to a life of sottish\ndespair, of course I should have charged Constance with the blame of\nit. Now that I have struggled on, I can see that she has been a\nblessing to me instead of a curse. If Marcella has given me strength, I\nhave to thank Constance for the spiritual joy which otherwise I should\nnever have known.'\n\nPeak uttered a short laugh.\n\n'That is only saying that she _might_ have been ruinous, but in the\ncourse of circumstances has proved helpful. I envy your power of\nderiving comfort from such reflections.'\n\n'Well, we view things differently. I have the habit of looking to the\nconsolatory facts of life, you to the depressing. There's an\nunfortunate lack in you, Peak; you seem insensible to female influence,\nand I believe that is closely connected with your desperate pessimism.'\n\nGodwin laughed again, this time with mocking length of note. 'Come now,\nisn't it true?' urged the other. 'Sincerely, do you care for women at\nall?'\n\n'Perhaps not.'\n\n'A grave misfortune, depend upon it! It accounts for nearly everything\nthat is unsatisfactory in your life. If you had ever been sincerely\ndevoted to a woman, be assured your powers would have developed in a\nway of which you have no conception. It's no answer to tell me that _I_\nam still a mere trifler, never likely to do anything of account; I\nhaven't it in me to be anything better, and I might easily have become\nmuch worse. But you might have made yourself a great position--I mean,\nyou _might_ do so; you are still very young. If only you knew the\ndesire of a woman's help.'\n\n'You really think so?' said Godwin, with grave irony.\n\n'I am sure of it! There's no harm in repeating what you have often told\nme--your egoism oppresses you. A woman's influence takes one out of\noneself. No man can be a better authority on this than I. For more than\neleven years I have worshipped one woman with absolute faithfulness'----\n\n'Absolute?' interrupted Godwin, bluntly.\n\n'What exception occurs to you?'\n\n'As you challenge inquiry, forgive me for asking what your interest was\nin one of your cousins at Twybridge?'\n\nChristian started, and averted his face with a look of embarrassment.\n\n'Do you mean to say that you knew anything about that?'\n\n'I was always an observer,' Peak replied, smiling. 'You don't remember,\nperhaps, that I happened to be present when a letter had just arrived\nfor you at your uncle's house--a letter which evidently disturbed you?'\n\n'This is astonishing! Peak, you're a terrible fellow! Heaven forbid\nthat I should ever be at your mercy! Yes, you are quite right,' he\ncontinued, despondently. 'But that was no real unfaithfulness. I don't\nquite know how to explain it. I _did_ make love to poor Janet, and with\nthe result that I have never since seen any of the family. My uncle,\nwhen he found I had drawn back, was very savage--naturally enough.\nMarcella and I never again went to Twybridge. I liked Janet; she was a\ngood, kind girl. I believed just then that my love for Constance was\nhopeless; my mood impelled me to the conviction that the best thing I\ncould do was to marry Janet and settle down to a peaceful domestic\nlife. Then came that letter--it was from Constance herself. It meant\nnothing, yet it was enough to revive all my hopes. I rushed off--! How\nbrutally I had behaved! Poor little Janet!'\n\nHe let his face fall upon his hands.\n\n'Allow me an indiscreet question,' said Peak, after a silence. 'Have\nyou any founded hope of marrying Constance if she becomes a widow?'\n\nChristian started and looked up with wide eyes.\n\n'Hope? Every hope! I have the absolute assurance of her love.'\n\n'I see.'\n\n'But I mustn't mislead you,' pursued the other, hurriedly. 'Our\nrelations are absolutely pure. I have only allowed myself to see her at\nvery long intervals. Why shouldn't I tell you? It was less than a year\nafter her marriage; I found her alone in a room in a friend's house;\nher eyes were red with weeping. I couldn't help holding my hand to her.\nShe took it, and held it for a moment, and looked at me steadily, and\nwhispered my name--that was all. I knew then that she repented of her\nmarriage--who can say what led her into it? I was poor, you know;\nperhaps--but in spite of all, she _did_ love me. There has never since\nbeen anything like a scene of emotion between us--_that_ her conscience\ncouldn't allow. She is a noble-minded woman, and has done her duty. But\nif she is free'--\n\nHe quivered with passionate feeling.\n\n'And you are content,' said Godwin, drily, 'to have wasted ten years of\nyour life for such a possibility?'\n\n'Wasted!' Christian exclaimed. 'Come, come, Peak; why _will_ you affect\nthis wretched cynicism? Is it waste of years to have lived with the\nhighest and purest ideal perpetually before one's mind? What can a man\ndo better than, having found an admirable woman, to worship her\nthenceforth, and defy every temptation that could lead him astray? I\ndon't like to seem boastful, but I _have_ lived purely and devotedly.\nAnd if the test endured to the end of my life, I could sustain it. Is\nthe consciousness of my love nothing to Constance? Has it not helped\nher?'\n\nSuch profound sincerity was astonishing to Peak. He did not admire it,\nfor it seemed to him, in this case at all events, the fatal weakness of\na character it was impossible not to love. Though he could not declare\nhis doubts, he thought it more than probable that this Laura of the\nvoiceless Petrarch was unworthy of such constancy, and that she had no\nintention whatever of rewarding it, even if the opportunity arrived.\nBut this was the mere speculation of a pessimist; he might be\naltogether wrong, for he had never denied the existence of high virtue,\nin man or woman.\n\n'There goes midnight!' he remarked, turning from the subject. 'You\ncan't sleep, neither can I. Why shouldn't we walk into town?'\n\n'By all means; on condition that you will come home with me, and spend\nto-morrow there.'\n\n'Very well.'\n\nThey set forth, and with varied talk, often broken by long silences,\nmade their way through sleeping suburbs to the dark valley of Thames.\n\nThere passed another month, during which Peak was neither seen nor\nheard of by his friends. One evening in October, as he sat studying at\nthe British Museum, a friendly voice claimed his attention. He rose\nnervously and met the searching eye of Buckland Warricombe.\n\n'I had it in mind to write to you,' said the latter. 'Since we parted\ndown yonder I have been running about a good deal, with few days in\ntown. Do you often read here?'\n\n'Generally on Saturday afternoon.'\n\nBuckland glanced at the open volume, and caught a heading, 'Apologetic\nTheology.'\n\n'Still at the works?'\n\n'Yes; I shall be there till Christmas--no longer.'\n\n'Are you by chance disengaged to-morrow? Could you dine with me? I\nshall be alone; perhaps you don't mind that? We could exchange views on\n\"fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute\".'\n\nGodwin accepted the invitation, and Warricombe, unable to linger, took\nleave of him.\n\nThey met the next evening in Buckland's rooms, not far from the Houses\nof Parliament. Commonplace comfort was the note of these quarters. Peak\nwondered that a man who had it in his power to surround himself with\nevidences of taste should be content to dwell thus. His host seemed to\ndetect this thought in the glances Godwin cast about him.\n\n'Nothing but a _pied-a-terre_. I have been here three or four years,\nbut I don't think of it as a home. I suppose I shall settle somewhere\nbefore long: yet, on the whole, what does it matter where one lives?\nThere's something in the atmosphere of our time that makes one\nindisposed to strike roots in the old way. Who knows how long there'll\nbe such a thing as real property? We are getting to think of ourselves\nas lodgers; it's as well to be indifferent about a notice to quit.'\n\n'Many people would still make a good fight for the old homes,' replied\nPeak.\n\n'Yes; I daresay I should myself, if I were a family man. A wife and\nchildren are strong persuasions to conservatism. In those who have\nanything, that's to say. Let the families who have nothing learn how\nthey stand in point of numbers, and we shall see what we shall see.'\n\n'And you are doing your best to teach them that.'\n\nBuckland smiled.\n\n'A few other things at the same time. One isn't necessarily an\nanarchist, you know.'\n\n'What enormous faith you must have in the metaphysical powers of the\nmultitude!'\n\n'Trenchant! But say, rather, in the universal self-interest. That's the\ntrait of human nature which we have in mind when we speak of\nenlightenment. The aim of practical Radicalism is to instruct men's\nselfishness. Astonishing how capable it is of being instructed! The\nmistake of the Socialist lies in his crediting men with far too much\nself-esteem, far too little perception of their own limits. The\ncharacteristic of mankind at large is humility.'\n\nPeak began to understand his old acquaintance; he had imagined him less\nacute. Gratified by the smile of interest, Warricombe added:\n\n'There are forces of madness; I have shown you that I make allowance\nfor them. But they are only dangerous so long as privilege allies\nitself with hypocrisy. The task of the modern civiliser is to sweep\naway sham idealisms.'\n\n'I agree with you,' Godwin replied.\n\nWith sudden change of mood, Buckland began to speak of an indifferent\ntopic of the day, and in a few minutes they sat down to dinner.\n\nNot till the welcome tobacco blended its aroma with that of coffee did\na frankly personal note sound in their conversation.\n\n'So at Christmas you are free,' said Warricombe. 'You still think of\nleaving London?'\n\n'I have decided to go down into Devonshire.'\n\n'The seaside?'\n\n'I shall stay first of all in Exeter,' Godwin replied, with\ndeliberation; 'one can get hold of books there.'\n\n'Yes, especially of the ecclesiastical colour.'\n\n'You are still unable to regard my position with anything but\ncontempt?' Peak asked, looking steadily at the critical face.\n\n'Come now; what does it all mean? Of course I quite understand how\ntolerant the Church is becoming: I know what latitude it permits in its\nservants. But what do you propose to yourself?'\n\n'Precisely what you call the work of the civiliser--to attack sham\nideals.'\n\n'As for instance--?'\n\n'The authority of the mob,' answered Peak, suavely.\n\n'Your clericalism is political, then?'\n\n'To a great extent.'\n\n'I discern a vague sort of consistency in this. You regard the Church\nformulas as merely symbolical--useful for the purposes of the day?'\n\n'Rather for the purposes of eternity.'\n\n'In the human sense.'\n\n'In every sense.'\n\nWarricombe perceived that no directness of questioning would elicit\nliteral response, and on the whole this relieved him. To hear Godwin\nPeak using the language of a fervent curate would have excited in him\nsomething more than disgust. It did not seem impossible that a nature\nlike Peak's--intellectually arrogant, vehemently anti-popular--should\nhave been attracted by the traditions, the social prestige, of the\nAnglican Church; nor at all unlikely that a mind so constituted should\njustify a seeming acceptance of dogmas, which in the strict sense it\ndespised. But he was made uneasy by his ignorance of Peak's private\nlife during the years since their parting at College. He did not like\nto think of the possible establishment of intimacy between this man of\nlow origin, uncertain career, boundless ambition, and the household of\nMartin Warricombe. There could be no doubt that Peak had decided to go\nto Exeter because of the social prospects recently opened to him. In\nthe vulgar phrase, he had probably 'taken stock' of Mr. Warricombe's\nidiosyncrasy, and saw therein a valuable opportunity for a theological\nstudent, who at the same time was a devotee of natural science. To be\nsure, the people at Exeter could be put on their guard. On the other\nhand, Peak had plainly avowed his desire to form social connections of\nthe useful kind; in his position such an aim was essential, a mere\nmatter of course.\n\nGodwin's voice interrupted this train of thought.\n\n'Let me ask you a plain question. You have twice been kind enough to\nintroduce me to your home as a friend of yours. Am I guilty of\npresumption in hoping that your parents will continue to regard me as\nan acquaintance? I trust there's no need to assure you that I know the\nmeaning of discretion.'\n\nAn appeal to Buckland's generosity seldom failed. Yes, it was true that\nhe had more than once encouraged the hope now frankly expressed.\nIndulging a correspondent frankness, he might explain that Peak's\nposition was so distasteful to him that it disturbed the future with\nmany kinds of uncertainty. But this would be churlish. He must treat\nhis guest as a gentleman, so long as nothing compelled him to take the\nless agreeable view.\n\n'My dear Peak, let us have none of these formalities. My parents have\ndistinctly invited you to go and see them whenever you are in the\nneighbourhood. I am quite sure they will help to make your stay in\nExeter a pleasant one.'\n\nTherewith closed the hazardous dialogue. Warricombe turned at once to a\nsafe topic--that of contemporary fiction, and they chatted pleasantly\nenough for the rest of the evening.\n\nNot many days after this, Godwin received by post an envelope which\ncontained certain proof sheets, and therewith a note in which the\neditor of _The Critical Review_ signified his acceptance of a paper\nentitled 'The New Sophistry'. The communication was originally\naddressed to Earwaker, who had scribbled at the foot, 'Correct, if you\nare alive, and send back to Dolby.'\n\nThe next morning he did not set out as usual for Rotherhithe. Through\nthe night he had not closed his eyes; he was in a state of nervousness\nwhich bordered on fever. A dozen times he had read over the proofs,\nwith throbbing pulse, with exultant self-admiration: but the printer's\nerrors which had caught his eye, and a few faults of phrase, were still\nuncorrected. What a capital piece of writing it was! What a\nflagellation of M'Naughten and all his tribe! If this did not rouse\nechoes in the literary world--\n\nThrough the long day he sat in languor or paced his room like one made\nrestless by pain. Only when the gloom of nightfall obliged him to light\nhis lamp did he at length sit down to the table and carefully revise\nthe proofs, pen in hand. When he had made up the packet for post, he\nwrote to Earwaker.\n\n'I had forgotten all about this thing. Proofs have gone to Dolby. I\nhave not signed; probably he would object to my doing so. As it is, the\npaper can be ascribed to anyone, and attention thus excited. We shall\nsee paragraphs attributing it to men of mark--perhaps scandal will fix\nit on a bishop. In any case, don't let out the secret. I beg this\nseriously, and for a solid reason. Not a word to anyone, however\nintimate. If Dolby betrays _your_ name, grin and bear it. I depend upon\nyour friendship.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nIn a by-way which declines from the main thoroughfare of Exeter, and\nbears the name of Longbrook Street, is a row of small houses placed\nabove long strips of sloping garden. They are old and plain, with no\narchitectural feature calling for mention, unless it be the latticed\nporch which gives the doors an awkward quaintness. Just beyond, the\nroad crosses a hollow, and begins the ascent of a hill here interposed\nbetween the city and the inland-winding valley of Exe. The little\nterrace may be regarded as urban or rural, according to the tastes and\noccasions of those who dwell there. In one direction, a walk of five\nminutes will conduct to the middle of High Street, and in the other it\ntakes scarcely longer to reach the open country.\n\nOn the upper floor of one of these cottages, Godwin Peak had made his\nabode. Sitting-room and bedchamber, furnished with homely comfort,\nanswered to his bachelor needs, and would allow of his receiving\nwithout embarrassment any visitor whom fortune might send him. Of\nquietness he was assured, for a widow and her son, alike remarkable for\nsobriety of demeanour, were the only persons who shared the house with\nhim. Mrs. Roots could not compare in grace and skill with the little\nFrenchwoman who had sweetened his existence at Peckham Rye, but her\nzeal made amends for natural deficiency, and the timorous respect with\nwhich she waited upon him was by no means disagreeable to Godwin. Her\nreply to a request or suggestion was always, 'If you please, sir.'\nThroughout the day she went so tranquilly about her domestic duties,\nthat Godwin seldom heard anything except the voice of the cuckoo-clock,\na pleasant sound to him. Her son, employed at a nurseryman's, was a\ngreat sinewy fellow with a face of such ruddiness that it seemed to\ndiffuse warmth; on Sunday afternoon, whatever the state of the sky, he\nsat behind the house in his shirt-sleeves, and smoked a pipe as he\ncontemplated the hart's-tongue which grew there upon a rockery.\n\n'The gentleman from London'--so Mrs. Roots was wont to style her lodger\nin speaking with neighbours--had brought his books with him; they found\nplace on a few shelves. His microscope had its stand by the window, and\none or two other scientific implements lay about the room. The cabinets\nbequeathed to him by Mr. Gunnery he had sent to Twybridge, to remain in\nhis mother's care. In taking the lodgings, he described himself merely\nas a student, and gave his landlady to understand that he hoped to\nremain under her roof for at least a year. Of his extreme\nrespectability, the widow could entertain no doubt, for he dressed with\naristocratic finish, attended services at the Cathedral and elsewhere\nvery frequently, and made the most punctual payments. Moreover, a\ncasual remark had informed her that he was on friendly terms with Mr.\nMartin Warricombe, whom her son knew as a gentleman of distinction. He\noften sat up very late at night, but, doubtless, that was the practice\nof Londoners. No lodger could have given less trouble, or have\nacknowledged with more courtesy all that was done for his convenience.\n\nNo one ever called upon Mr. Peak, but he was often from home for many\nhours together, probably on visits to great people in city or country.\nIt seemed rather strange, however, that the postman so seldom brought\nanything for him. Though he had now been more than two months in the\nhouse, he had received only three letters, and those at long intervals.\n\nNoticeable was the improvement in his health since his arrival here.\nThe pallor of his cheeks was giving place to a wholesome tinge; his eye\nwas brighter; he showed more disposition to converse, and was readier\nwith pleasant smiles. Mrs. Roots even heard him singing in his\nbedroom--though, oddly enough, it was a secular song on Sunday morning.\nThe weekly bills for food, which at first had been very modest, grew\nricher in items. Godwin had, in fact, never felt so well. He extended\nhis walks in every direction, sometimes rambling up the valley to\nsleepy little towns where he could rest in the parlours of old inns,\nsometimes striking across country to this or that point of the\nsea-coast, or making his way to the nearer summits of Dartmoor, noble\nin their wintry desolation. He marked with delight every promise of\nreturning spring. When he could only grant himself a walk of an hour or\ntwo in the sunny afternoon, there was many a deep lane within easy\nreach, where the gorse gleamed in masses of gold, and the little\noak-trees in the hedges were ruddy with last year's clinging leafage,\nand catkins hung from the hazels, and the fresh green of sprouting ivy\ncrept over bank and wall. Had he now been in London, the morning would\nhave awakened him to the glow of sunrise, he felt the sweet air\nbreathing health into fog and slush and misery. As it was, when he\nlooked out upon his frame and vigour into his mind. There were moments\nwhen he could all but say of himself that he was at peace with the\nworld.\n\nAs on a morning towards the end of March, when a wind from the Atlantic\nswept spaces of brightest blue amid the speeding clouds, and sang\njoyously as it rushed over hill and dale. It was the very day for an\nupland walk, for a putting forth of one's strength in conflict with\nboisterous gusts and sudden showers, that give a taste of earth's\nnourishment. But Godwin had something else in view. After breakfast, he\nsat down to finish a piece of work which had occupied him for two or\nthree days, a translation from a German periodical. His mind wrought\neasily, and he often hummed an air as his pen moved over the paper.\nWhen the task was completed, he rolled his papers and the pamphlet\ntogether, put them into the pocket of his overcoat, and presently went\nforth.\n\nTwenty minutes' walk brought him to the Warricombes' house. It was his\nsecond call within the present week, but such assiduity had not\nhitherto been his wont. Though already summoned twice or thrice by\nexpress invitation, he was sparing of voluntary visits. Having asked\nfor Mr. Warricombe, he was forthwith conducted to the study. In the\nwelcome which greeted his appearance, he could detect no suspicion of\nsimulated warmth, though his ear had unsurpassable discrimination.\n\n'Have you looked through it?' Martin exclaimed, as he saw the foreign\nperiodical in his visitor's hand.\n\n'I have written a rough translation'----\n\n'Oh, how could you think of taking such trouble! These things are sent\nto me by the dozen--I might say, by the cartload. My curiosity would\nhave been amply satisfied if you had just told me the drift of the\nthing.'\n\n'It seemed to me,' said Peak, modestly, 'that the paper was worth a\nlittle careful thought. I read it rapidly at first, but found myself\ndrawn to it again. It states the point of view of the average\nscientific mind with such remarkable clearness, that I wished to think\nit over, and the best way was to do so pen in hand.'\n\n'Well, if you really did it on your own account'----\n\nMr. Warricombe took the offered sheets and glanced at the first of them.\n\n'My only purpose,' said Godwin 'in calling again so soon was to leave\nthis with you.'\n\nHe made as though he would take his departure.\n\n'You want to get home again? Wait at least till this shower is over. I\nenjoy that pelting of spring rain against the window. In a minute or\ntwo we shall have the laurels flashing in the sunshine, as if they were\nhung with diamonds.'\n\nThey stood together looking out on to the garden. Presently their talk\nreturned to the German disquisition, which was directed against the\nclass of quasi-scientific authors attacked by Peak himself in his\n_Critical_ article. In the end Godwin sat down and began to read the\ntranslation he had made, Mr. Warricombe listening with a thoughtful\nsmile. From time to time the reader paused and offered a comment,\nendeavouring to show that the arguments were merely plausible; his air\nwas that of placid security, and he seemed to enjoy the irony which\noften fell from his lips. Martin frequently scrutinised him, and always\nwith a look of interest which betokened grave reflection.\n\n'Here,' said Godwin at one point, 'he has a note citing a passage from\nReusch's book on _The Bible and Nature_. If I am not mistaken, he\nmisrepresents his author, though perhaps not intentionally.'\n\n'You know the book?'\n\n'I have studied it carefully, but I don't possess it. I thought I\nremembered this particular passage very well.'\n\n'Is it a work of authority?'\n\n'Yes; it is very important. Unfortunately, it hasn't yet been\ntranslated. Rather bulky, but I shouldn't mind doing it myself if I\nwere sure of finding a publisher.'\n\n'_The Bible and Nature_,' said Martin, musingly. 'What is his scheme?\nHow does he go to work?'\n\nGodwin gave a brief but lucid description of the book, and Mr\nWarricombe listened gravely. When there had been silence for some\nmoments, the latter spoke in a tone he had never yet used when\nconversing with Peak. He allowed himself, for the first time, to betray\na troubled doubt on the subject under discussion.\n\n'So he makes a stand at Darwinism as it affects man?'\n\nPeak had yet no means of knowing at what point Martin himself 'made a\nstand'. Modes of reconcilement between scientific discovery and\nreligious tradition are so very numerous, and the geologist was only\nnow beginning to touch upon these topics with his young acquaintance.\nThat his mind was not perfectly at ease amid the conflicts of the day,\nGodwin soon perceived, and by this time he had clear assurance that\nMartin would willingly thrash out the whole debate with anyone who\nseemed capable of supporting orthodox tenets by reasoning not\nunacceptable to a man of broad views. The negativist of course assumed\nfrom the first that Martin, however respectable his knowledge, was far\nfrom possessing the scientific mind, and each conversation had supplied\nhim with proofs of this defect; it was not at all in the modern spirit\nthat the man of threescore years pursued his geological and kindred\nresearches, but with the calm curiosity of a liberal intellect which\nhas somehow taken this direction instead of devoting itself to literary\nstudy. At bottom, Godwin had no little sympathy with Mr. Warricombe; he\ntoo, in spite of his militant instincts, dwelt by preference amid\npurely human interests. He grasped with firm intelligence the modes of\nthought which distinguish scientific men, but his nature did not prompt\nhim to a consistent application of them. Personal liking enabled him to\nsubdue the impulses of disrespect which, under other circumstances,\nwould have made it difficult for him to act with perfection his present\npart. None the less, his task was one of infinite delicacy. Martin\nWarricombe was not the man to unbosom himself on trivial instigation.\nIt must be a powerful influence which would persuade him to reveal\nwhatever self-questionings lay beneath his genial good breeding and\nlong-established acquiescence in a practical philosophy. Godwin guarded\nhimself against his eager emotions; one false note, one syllable of\nindiscretion, and his aims might be hopelessly defeated.\n\n'Yes,' was his reply to the hesitating question. 'He argues strenuously\nagainst the descent of man. If I understand him, he regards the\nconcession of this point as impossible.'\n\nMartin was deep in thought. He held a paper-knife bent upon his knee,\nand his smooth, delicate features wore an unquiet smile.\n\n'Do you know Hebrew, Mr. Peak?'\n\nThe question came unexpectedly, and Godwin could not help a momentary\nconfusion, but he covered it with the tone of self-reproach.\n\n'I am ashamed to say that I am only now taking it up seriously.'\n\n'I don't think you need be ashamed,' said Martin, good-naturedly. 'Even\na mind as active as yours must postpone some studies. Reusch, I\nsuppose, is sound on that head?'\n\nThe inquiry struck Godwin as significant. So Mr. Warricombe attached\nimportance to the verbal interpretation of the Old Testament.\n\n'Distinctly an authority,' he replied. 'He devotes whole chapters to a\nminute examination of the text.'\n\n'If you had more leisure,' Martin began, deliberately, when he had\nagain reflected, 'I should be disposed to urge you to undertake that\ntranslation.'\n\nPeak appeared to meditate.\n\n'Has the book been used by English writers?' the other inquired.\n\n'A good deal.--It was published in the sixties, but I read it in a new\nedition dated a few years ago. Reusch has kept pace with the men of\nscience. It would be very interesting to compare the first form of the\nbook with the latest.'\n\n'It would, very.'\n\nRaising his head from the contemplative posture, Godwin exclaimed, with\na laugh of zeal:\n\n'I think I must find time to translate him. At all events, I might\naddress a proposal to some likely publisher. Yet I don't know how I\nshould assure him of my competency.'\n\n'Probably a specimen would be the surest testimony.'\n\n'Yes. I might do a few chapters.'\n\nMr. Warricombe's lapse into silence and brevities intimated to Godwin\nthat it was time to take leave. He always quitted this room with\nreluctance. Its air of luxurious culture affected his senses\ndeliciously, and he hoped that he might some day be permitted to linger\namong the cabinets and the library shelves. There were so many books he\nwould have liked to take down, some with titles familiar to him, others\nwhich kindled his curiosity when he chanced to observe them. The\nlibrary abounded in such works as only a wealthy man can purchase, and\nGodwin, who had examined some of them at the British Museum, was filled\nwith the humaner kind of envy on seeing them in Mr. Warricombe's\npossession. Those publications of the Palaeontological Society, one\nvolume of which (a part of Davidson's superb work on the _Brachiopoda_)\neven now lay open within sight--his hand trembled with a desire to\ntouch them! And those maps of the Geological Surveys, British and\nforeign, how he would have enjoyed a day's poring over them!\n\nHe rose, but Martin seemed in no haste to bring the conversation to an\nend.\n\n'Have you read M'Naughten's much-discussed book?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Did you see the savage attack in _The Critical_ not long ago?'\n\nGodwin smiled, and made quiet answer:\n\n'I should think it was the last word of scientific bitterness and\nintolerance.'\n\n'Scientific?' repeated Martin, doubtfully. 'I don't think the writer\nwas a man of science. I saw it somewhere attributed to Huxley, but that\nwas preposterous. To begin with, Huxley would have signed his name;\nand, again, his English is better. The article seemed to me to be\nstamped with literary rancour; it was written by some man who envies\nM'Naughten's success.'\n\nPeak kept silence. Martin's censure of the anonymous author's style\nstung him to the quick, and he had much ado to command his countenance.\n\n'Still,' pursued the other, 'I felt that much of his satire was only\ntoo well pointed. M'Naughten is suggestive; but one comes across books\nof the same purpose which can have no result but to injure their cause\nwith all thinking people.'\n\n'I have seen many such,' remarked Godwin.\n\nMr. Warricombe stepped to a bookcase and took down a small volume.\n\n'I wonder whether you know this book of Ampare's, _La Grace, Rome, et\nDante_? Delightful for odd moments!--There came into my mind a passage\nhere at the beginning, apropos of what we were saying: \"_Il faut\nsouvent un vrai courage pour persister dans une opinion juste en depit\nde ses defenseurs_.\"--Isn't that capital?'\n\nPeak received it with genuine appreciation; for once he was able to\nlaugh unfeignedly. The aphorism had so many applications from his own\npoint of view.\n\n'Excellent!--I don't remember to have seen the book.'\n\n'Take it, if you care to.'\n\nThis offer seemed a distinct advance in Mr. Warricombe's friendliness.\nGodwin felt a thrill of encouragement.\n\n'Then you will let me keep this translation for a day or two?' Martin\nadded, indicating the sheets of manuscript. 'I am greatly obliged to\nyou for enabling me to read the thing.'\n\nThey shook hands. Godwin had entertained a slight hope that he might be\nasked to stay to luncheon; but it could not be much past twelve\no'clock, and on the whole there was every reason for feeling satisfied\nwith the results of his visit. Before long he would probably receive\nanother invitation to dine. So with light step he went out into the\nhall, where Martin again shook hands with him.\n\nThe sky had darkened over, and a shrilling of the wind sounded through\nthe garden foliage--fir, and cypress, and laurel. Just as Godwin\nreached the gate, he was met by Miss Warricombe and Fanny, who were\nreturning from a walk. They wore the costume appropriate to March\nweather in the country, close-fitting, defiant of gusts; and their\ncheeks glowed with health. As he exchanged greetings with them, Peak\nreceived a new impression of the sisters. He admired the physical\nvigour which enabled them to take delight in such a day as this, when\ngirls of poorer blood and ignoble nurture would shrink from the sky's\nshowery tumult, and protect their surface elegance by the fireside.\nImpossible for Sidwell and Fanny to be anything but graceful, for at\nall times they were perfectly unaffected.\n\n'There'll be another storm in a minute,' said the younger of them,\nlooking with interest to the quarter whence the wind came. 'How\nsuddenly they burst! What a rush! And then in five minutes the sky is\nclear again.'\n\nHer eyes shone as she turned laughingly to Peak.\n\n'You're not afraid of getting wet? Hadn't you better come under cover?'\n\n'Here it is!' exclaimed Sidwell, with quieter enjoyment. 'Take shelter\nfor a minute or two, Mr. Peak.'\n\nThey led the way to the portico, where Godwin stood with them and\nwatched the squall. A moment's downpour of furious rain was followed by\nheavy hailstones, which drove horizontally before the shrieking wind.\nThe prospect had wrapped itself in grey gloom. At a hundred yards'\ndistance, scarcely an object could be distinguished; the storm-cloud\nswooped so low that its skirts touched the branches of tall elms, a\nstreaming, rushing raggedness.\n\n'Don't you enjoy that?' Fanny asked of Godwin.\n\n'Indeed I do.'\n\n'You should be on Dartmoor in such weather,' said Sidwell. 'Father and\nI were once caught in storms far worse than this--far better, I ought\nto say, for I never knew anything so terrifically grand.'\n\nAlready it was over. The gusts diminished in frequency and force, the\nhail ceased, the core of blackness was passing over to the eastern sky.\nFanny ran out into the garden, and pointed upward.\n\n'Look where the sunlight is coming!'\n\nAn uncloaked patch of heaven shone with colour like that of the girl's\neyes--faint, limpid blue. Reminding himself that to tarry longer in\nthis company would be imprudent, Godwin bade the sisters good-morning.\nThe frank heartiness with which Fanny pressed his hand sent him on his\nway exultant. Not too strong a word; for, independently of his wider\nambitions, he was moved and gratified by the thought that kindly\nfeeling towards him had sprung up in such a heart as this. Nor did\nconscience so much as whisper a reproach. With unreflecting\ningenuousness he tasted the joy as if it were his right. Thus long he\nhad waited, through years of hungry manhood, for the look, the tone,\nwhich were in harmony with his native sensibilities. Fanny Warricombe\nwas but an undeveloped girl, yet he valued her friendship above the\npassionate attachment of any woman bred on a lower social plane. Had it\nbeen possible, he would have kissed her fingers with purest reverence.\n\nWhen out of sight of the house, he paused to regard the sky again. Its\nnoontide splendour was dazzling; masses of rosy cloud sailed swiftly\nfrom horizon to horizon, the azure deepening about them. Yet before\nlong the west would again send forth its turbulent spirits, and so the\ngirls might perhaps be led to think of him.\n\nBy night the weather grew more tranquil. There was a full moon, and its\nradiance illumined the ever-changing face of heaven with rare grandeur.\nGodwin could not shut himself up over his books; he wandered far away\ninto the country, and let his thoughts have freedom.\n\nHe was learning to review with calmness the course by which he had\nreached his now steadfast resolve. A revulsion such as he had\nexperienced after his first day of simulated orthodoxy, half a year\nago, could not be of lasting effect, for it was opposed to the whole\ntenor of his mature thought. It spoilt his holiday, but had no chance\nof persisting after his return to the atmosphere of Rotherhithe. That\nhe should have been capable of such emotion was, he said to himself, in\nthe just order of things; callousness in the first stages of an\nundertaking which demanded gross hypocrisy would signify an ignoble\nnature--a nature, indeed, which could never have been submitted to\ntrial of so strange a kind. But he had overcome himself; that phase of\ndifficulty was outlived, and henceforth he saw only the material\nobstacles to be defied by his vindicated will.\n\nWhat he proposed to himself was a life of deliberate baseness. Godwin\nPeak never tried to play the sophist with this fact. But he succeeded\nin justifying himself by a consideration of the circumstances which had\ncompelled him to a vile expedient. Had his project involved conscious\nwrong to other persons, he would scarcely even have speculated on its\npossibilities. He was convinced that no mortal could suffer harm, even\nif he accomplished the uttermost of his desires. Whom was he in danger\nof wronging? The conventional moralist would cry: Everyone with whom he\ncame in slightest contact! But a mind such as Peak's has very little to\ndo with conventional morality. Injury to himself he foresaw and\naccepted; he could never be the man nature designed in him; and he must\nfrequently submit to a self-contempt which would be very hard to bear.\nThose whom he consistently deceived, how would they suffer? Martin\nWarricombe to begin with. Martin was a man who had lived his life, and\nwhose chief care would now be to keep his mind at rest in the faiths\nwhich had served him from youth onwards. In that very purpose, Godwin\nbelieved he could assist him. To see a young man, of strong and trained\nintellect, championing the old beliefs, must doubtless be a source of\nreassurance to one in Martin's position. Reassurance derived from a\nlie?--And what matter, if the outcome were genuine, if it lasted until\nthe man himself was no more? Did not every form of content result from\nillusion? What was truth without the mind of the believer?\n\nSociety, then--at all events that part of it likely to be affected by\nhis activity? Suppose him an ordained priest, performing all the\nfunctions implied in that office. Why, to think only of examples\nrecognised by the public at large, how would he differ for the worse\nfrom this, that, and the other clergyman who taught Christianity, all\nbut with blunt avowal, as a scheme of human ethics? No wolf in sheep's\nclothing he! He plotted against no man's pocket, no woman's honour; he\nhad no sinister design of sapping the faith of congregations--a scheme,\nby-the-bye, which fanatic liberators might undertake with vast\nself-approval. If by a word he could have banished religious dogma from\nthe minds of the multitude, he would not have cared to utter it.\nWherein lay, indeed, a scruple to be surmounted. The Christian priest\nmust be a man of humble temper; he must be willing, even eager, to sit\ndown among the poor in spirit as well as in estate, and impart to them\nhis unworldly solaces. Yes, but it had always been recognised that some\nmen who could do the Church good service were personally unfitted for\nthose meek ministrations. His place was in the hierarchy of intellect;\nif he were to be active at all, it must be with the brain. In his\nconversation with Buckland Warricombe, last October, he had spoken not\naltogether insincerely. Let him once be a member of the Church\nmilitant, and his heart would go with many a stroke against that\ndemocratic movement which desired, among other things, the Church's\nabolition. He had power of utterance. Roused to combat by the\nproletarian challenge, he could make his voice ring in the ears of men,\neven though he used a symbolism which he would not by choice have\nadopted.\n\nFor it was natural that he should anticipate distinction. Whatever his\nlot in life, he would not be able to rest among an inglorious\nbrotherhood. If he allied himself with the Church, the Church must\nassign him leadership, whether titular or not was of small moment. In\ndays to come, let people, if they would, debate his history, canvass\nhis convictions. His scornful pride invited any degree of publicity,\nwhen once his position was secure.\n\nBut in the meantime he was leaving aside the most powerful of all his\nmotives, and one which demanded closest scrutiny. Not ambition, in any\nordinary sense; not desire of material luxury; no incentive recognised\nby unprincipled schemers first suggested his dishonour. This edifice of\nsubtle untruth had for its foundation a mere ideal of sexual love. For\nthe winning of some chosen woman, men have wrought vehemently, have\nruined themselves and others, have achieved triumphs noble or\ndegrading. But Godwin Peak had for years contemplated the possibility\nof baseness at the impulse of a craving for love capable only of a\nsocial (one might say, of a political) definition. The woman throned in\nhis imagination was no individual, but the type of an order. So\nstrangely had circumstances moulded him, that he could not brood on a\ndesire of spiritual affinities, could not, as is natural to most\ncultivated men, inflame himself with the ardour of soul reaching to\nsoul; he was pre-occupied with the contemplation of qualities which\ncharacterise a class. The sense of social distinctions was so burnt\ninto him, that he could not be affected by any pictured charm of mind\nor person in a woman who had not the stamp of gentle birth and\nbreeding. If once he were admitted to the intimacy of such women, then,\nindeed, the canons of selection would have weight with him; no man more\ncapable of disinterested choice. Till then, the ideal which possessed\nhim was merely such an assemblage of qualities as would excite the\ndemocrat to disdain or fury.\n\nIn Sidwell Warricombe this ideal found an embodiment; but Godwin did\nnot thereupon come to the conclusion that Sidwell was the wife he\ndesired. Her influence had the effect of deciding his career, but he\nneither imagined himself in love with her, nor tried to believe that he\nmight win her love if he set himself to the endeavour. For the first\ntime he was admitted to familiar intercourse with a woman whom he\n_could_ make the object of his worship. He thought much of her; day and\nnight her figure stood before him; and this had continued now for half\na year. Still he neither was, nor dreamt himself, in love with her.\nBefore long his acquaintance would include many of her like, and at any\nmoment Sidwell might pale in the splendour of another's loveliness.\n\nBut what reasoning could defend the winning of a wife by false\npretences? This, his final aim, could hardly be achieved without grave\nwrong to the person whose welfare must in the nature of things be a\nprime motive with him. The deception he had practised must sooner or\nlater be discovered; lifelong hypocrisy was incompatible with perfect\nmarriage; some day he must either involve his wife in a system of\ndishonour, or with her consent relinquish the false career, and find\nhis happiness in the obscurity to which he would then be relegated.\nAdmit the wrong. Grant that some woman whom he loved supremely must, on\nhis account, pass through a harsh trial--would it not be in his power\nto compensate her amply? The wife whom he imagined (his idealism in\nthis matter was of a crudity which made the strangest contrast with his\nhabits of thought on every other subject) would be ruled by her\nemotions, and that part of her nature would be wholly under his\ngovernance. Religious fanaticism could not exist in her, for in that\ncase she would never have attracted him. Little by little she would\nlearn to think as he did, and her devotedness must lead her to pardon\nhis deliberate insincerities. Godwin had absolute faith in his power of\ndominating the woman whom he should inspire with tenderness. This was a\nfeature of his egoism, the explanation of those manifold\ninconsistencies inseparable from his tortuous design. He regarded his\nlove as something so rare, so vehement, so exalting, that its bestowal\nmust seem an abundant recompense for any pain of which he was the cause.\n\nThus, with perfect sincerity of argument, did Godwin Peak face the\nundertaking to which he was committed. Incidents might perturb him, but\nhis position was no longer a cause of uneasiness--save, indeed, at\nthose moments when he feared lest any of his old acquaintances might\nhear of him before time was ripe. This was a source of anxiety, but\ninevitable; one of the risks he dared.\n\nHad it seemed possible, he would have kept even from his mother the\nsecret of his residence at Exeter; but this would have necessitated the\nestablishment of some indirect means of communication with her, a\ntroublesome and uncertain expedient. He shrank from leaving her in\nignorance of his whereabouts, and from passing a year or two without\nknowledge of her condition. And, on the whole, there could not be much\ndanger in this correspondence. The Moxeys, who alone of his friends had\never been connected with Twybridge, were now absolutely without\ninterests in that quarter. From them he had stolen away, only\nacquainting Christian at the last moment, in a short letter, with his\ndeparture from London. 'It will be a long time before we again see each\nother--at least, I think so. Don't trouble your head about me. I can't\npromise to write, and shall be sorry not to hear how things go with\nyou; but may all happen as you wish!' In the same way he had dealt with\nEarwaker, except that his letter to Staple Inn was much longer, and\ncontained hints which the philosophic journalist might perchance truly\ninterpret. '\"He either fears his fate too much\"--you know the old song.\nI have set out on my life's adventure. I have gone to seek that without\nwhich life is no longer worth having. Forgive my shabby treatment of\nyou, old friend. You cannot help me, and your displeasure would be a\nhindrance in my path. A last piece of counsel: throw overboard the\nweekly rag, and write for people capable of understanding you.'\nEarwaker was not at all likely to institute a search; he would accept\nthe situation, and wait with quiet curiosity for its upshot. No doubt\nhe and Moxey would discuss the affair together, and any desire\nChristian might have to hunt for his vanished comrade would yield\nbefore the journalist's surmises. No one else had any serious reason\nfor making inquiries. Probably he might dwell in Devonshire, as long as\nhe chose, without fear of encountering anyone from his old world.\n\nOccasionally--as to-night, under the full moon--he was able to cast off\nevery form of trouble, and rejoice in his seeming liberty. Though every\nstep in the life before him was an uncertainty, an appeal to fortune,\nhis faith in himself grasped strongly at assurance of success. Once\nmore he felt himself a young man, with unwearied energies; he had\nshaken off the burden of those ten frustrate years, and kept only their\nharvest of experience. Old in one sense, in another youthful, he had\nvast advantages over such men as would henceforth be his\ncompetitors--the complex brain, the fiery heart, passion to desire, and\nskill in attempting. If with such endowment he could not win the prize\nwhich most men claim as a mere matter of course, a wife of social\ninstincts correspondent with his own, he must indeed be luckless. But\nhe was not doomed to defeat! Foretaste of triumph urged the current of\nhis blood and inflamed him with exquisite ardour. He sang aloud in the\nstill lanes the hymns of youth and of love; and, when weariness brought\nhim back to his lonely dwelling, he laid his head on the pillow, and\nslept in dreamless calm.\n\nAs for the details of his advance towards the clerical state, he had\ndecided to resume his career at the point where it was interrupted by\nAndrew Peak. Twice had his education received a check from hostile\ncircumstances: when domestic poverty compelled him to leave school for\nMr. Moxey's service, and when shame drove him from Whitelaw College. In\nreflecting upon his own character and his lot he gave much weight to\nthese irregularities, no doubt with justice. In both cases he was\nturned aside from the way of natural development and opportunity. He\nwould now complete his academic course by taking the London degree at\nwhich he had long ago aimed; the preliminary examination might without\ndifficulty be passed this summer, and next year he might write himself\nBachelor of Arts. A return to the studies of boyhood probably accounted\nin some measure for the frequent gaiety which he attributed to\nimproving health and revived hopes. Everything he undertook was easy to\nhim, and by a pleasant self-deception he made the passing of a school\ntask his augury of success in greater things.\n\nDuring the spring he was indebted to the Warricombes' friendship for\nseveral new acquaintances. A clergyman named Lilywhite, often at the\nWarricombes' house, made friendly overtures to him; the connection\nmight be a useful one, and Godwin made the most of it. Mr. Lilywhite\nwas a man of forty well--read, of scientific tastes, an active\npedestrian. Peak had no difficulty in associating with him on amicable\nterms. With Mrs. Lilywhite, the mother of six children and possessed of\nmany virtues, he presently became a favourite,--she saw in him 'a great\ndeal of quiet moral force'. One or two families of good standing made\nhim welcome at their houses; society is very kind to those who seek its\nbenefits with recognised credentials. The more he saw of these wealthy\nand tranquil middle-class people, the more fervently did he admire the\ngracefulness of their existence. He had not set before himself an\nimaginary ideal; the girls and women were sweet, gentle, perfect in\nmanner, and, within limits, of bright intelligence. He was conscious of\nbenefiting greatly, and not alone in things extrinsic, by the\natmosphere of such homes.\n\nNature's progress towards summer kept him in a mood of healthful\nenjoyment. From the window of his sitting-room he looked over the\nopposite houses to Northernhay, the hill where once stood Rougemont\nCastle, its wooded declivities now fashioned into a public garden. He\nwatched the rooks at their building in the great elms, and was\ngladdened when the naked branches began to deck themselves, day by day\nthe fresh verdure swelling into soft, graceful outline. In his walks he\npried eagerly for the first violet, welcomed the earliest blackthorn\nblossom; every common flower of field and hedgerow gave him a new, keen\npleasure. As was to be expected he found the same impulses strong in\nSidwell Warricombe and her sister. Sidwell could tell him of secret\nspots where the wood-sorrel made haste to flower, or where the white\nviolet breathed its fragrance in security from common pilferers. Here\nwas the safest and pleasantest matter for conversation. He knew that on\nsuch topics he could talk agreeably enough, revealing without stress or\nimportunity his tastes, his powers, his attainments. And it seemed to\nhim that Sidwell listened with growing interest. Most certainly her\nfather encouraged his visits to the house, and Mrs. Warricombe behaved\nto him with increase of suavity.\n\nIn the meantime he had purchased a copy of Reusch's _Bibel und Natur_,\nand had made a translation of some fifty pages. This experiment he\nsubmitted to a London publishing house, with proposals for the\ncompletion of the work; without much delay there came a civil letter of\nexcuse, and with it the sample returned. Another attempt again met with\nrejection. This failure did not trouble him. What he really desired was\nto read through his version of Reusch with Martin Warricombe, and\nbefore long he had brought it to pass that Martin requested a perusal\nof the manuscript as it advanced, which it did but slowly. Godwin durst\nnot endanger his success in the examination by encroaching upon hours\nof necessary study; his leisure was largely sacrificed to _Bibel und\nNatur_, and many an evening of calm golden loveliness, when he longed\nto be amid the fields, passed in vexatious imprisonment. The name of\nReusch grew odious to him, and he revenged himself for the hypocrisy of\nother hours by fierce scorn, cast audibly at this laborious exegetist.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nIt occasionally happens that a woman whose early life has been directed\nby native silliness and social bias, will submit to a tardy education\nat the hands of her own children. Thus was it with Mrs Warricombe.\n\nShe came of a race long established in squirearchic dignity amid heaths\nand woodlands. Her breeding was pure through many generations of the\npaternal and maternal lines, representative of a physical type,\nfortified in the males by much companionship with horse and hound, and\nby the corresponding country pursuits of dowered daughters. At the time\nof her marriage she had no charms of person more remarkable than rosy\ncomeliness and the symmetry of supple limb. As for the nurture of her\nmind, it had been intrusted to home-governesses of respectable\nincapacity. Martin Warricombe married her because she was one of a\nlittle circle of girls, much alike as to birth and fortune, with whom\nhe had grown up in familiar communication. Timidity imposed restraints\nupon him which made his choice almost a matter of accident. As befalls\noften enough, the betrothal became an accomplished fact whilst he was\nstill doubting whether he desired it or not. When the fervour of early\nwedlock was outlived, he had no difficulty in accepting as a matter of\ncourse that his life's companion should be hopelessly illogical and at\nheart indifferent to everything but the small graces and substantial\ncomforts of provincial existence. One of the advantages of wealth is\nthat it allows husband and wife to keep a great deal apart without any\nshow of mutual unkindness, a condition essential to happiness in\nmarriage. Time fostered in them a calm attachment, independent of\nspiritual sympathy, satisfied with a common regard for domestic honour.\n\nNot that Mrs. Warricombe remained in complete ignorance of her\nhusband's pursuits; social forms would scarcely have allowed this,\nseeing that she was in constant intercourse, as hostess or guest, with\nMartin's scientific friends. Of fossils she necessarily knew something.\nUp to a certain point they amused her; she could talk of ammonites, of\nbrachiopods, and would point a friend's attention to the _Calceola\nsandalina_ which Martin prized so much. The significance of\npalaeontology she dimly apprehended, for in the early days of their\nunion her husband had felt it desirable to explain to her what was\nmeant by geologic time and how he reconciled his views on that subject\nwith the demands of religious faith. Among the books which he induced\nher to read were Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise and the works of Hugh\nMiller. The intellectual result was chaotic, and Mrs. Warricombe\nsettled at last into a comfortable private opinion, that though the\nrecord of geology might be trustworthy that of the Bible was more so.\nShe would admit that there was no impiety in accepting the evidence of\nnature, but held to a secret conviction that it was safer to believe in\nGenesis. For anything beyond a quasi-permissible variance from biblical\nauthority as to the age of the world she was quite unprepared, and\nMartin, in his discretion, imparted to her nothing of the graver doubts\nwhich were wont to trouble him.\n\nBut as her children grew up, Mrs. Warricombe's mind and temper were\ninsensibly modified by influences which operated through her maternal\naffections, influences no doubt aided by the progressive spirit of the\ntime. The three boys--Buckland, Maurice, and Louis--were distinctly of\na new generation. It needed some ingenuity to discover their points of\nkindred with paternal and maternal grandparents; nor even with father\nand mother had they much in common which observation could readily\ndetect. Sidwell, up to at least her fifteenth year, seemed to present\nfar less change of type. In her Mrs. Warricombe recognised a daughter,\nand not without solace. But Fanny again was a problematical nature,\nalmost from the cradle. Latest born, she appeared to revive many\ncharacteristics of the youthful Buckland, so far as a girl could\nresemble her brother. It was a strange brood to cluster around Mrs.\nWarricombe. For many years the mother was kept in alternation between\nhopes and fears, pride and disapproval, the old hereditary habits of\nmind, and a new order of ideas which could only be admitted with the\nutmost slowness. Buckland's Radicalism deeply offended her; she\nmarvelled how such depravity could display itself in a child of hers.\nYet in the end her ancestral prejudices so far yielded as to allow of\nher smiling at sentiments which she once heard with horror. Maurice,\nwhom she loved more tenderly, all but taught her to see the cogency of\na syllogism--amiably set forth. And Louis, with his indolent\ngood-nature, laughed her into a tolerance of many things which had\nmoved her indignation. But it was to Sidwell that in the end she owed\nmost. Beneath the surface of ordinary and rather backward girlhood,\nwhich discouraged her father's hopes, Sidwell was quietly developing a\npersonality distinguished by the refinement of its ethical motives. Her\northodoxy seemed as unimpeachable as Mrs Warricombe could desire, yet\nas she grew into womanhood, a curiosity, which in no way disturbed the\ntenor of her quietly contented life, led her to examine various forms\nof religion, ancient and modern, and even systems of philosophy which\nprofessed to establish a moral code, independent of supernatural faith.\nShe was not of studious disposition--that is to say, she had never\ncared as a schoolgirl to do more mental work than was required of her,\nand even now it was seldom that she read for more than an hour or two\nin the day. Her habit was to dip into books, and meditate long on the\nfirst points which arrested her thoughts. Of continuous application she\nseemed incapable. She could read French, but did not attempt to pursue\nthe other languages of which her teachers had given her a smattering.\nIt pleased her best when she could learn from conversation. In this way\nshe obtained some insight into her father's favourite sciences,\noccasionally making suggestions or inquiries which revealed a subtle if\nnot an acute intelligence.\n\nLittle by little Mrs. Warricombe found herself changing places with the\ndaughter whom she had regarded as wholly subject to her direction.\nSidwell began to exercise an indeterminate control, the proofs of which\nwere at length manifest in details of her mother's speech and\ndemeanour. An exquisite social tact, an unfailing insensibly as the\nqualities of pure air: these were the points of sincerity of moral\njudgment, a gentle force which operated as character to which Mrs.\nWarricombe owed the humanisation observable when one compared her in\n1885 with what she was, say, in 1874, when the sight of Professor Walsh\nmoved her to acrimony, and when she conceived a pique against Professor\nGale because the letter P has alphabetical precedence of W. Her\nlimitations were of course the same as ever, and from her sons she had\nonly learnt to be ashamed of announcing them too vehemently. Sidwell it\nwas who had led her to that degree of genuine humility, which is not\nsatisfied with hiding a fault but strives to amend it.\n\nMartin Warricombe himself was not unaffected by the growth about him of\nyoung men and maidens who looked upon the world with new eyes, whose\nworld, indeed, was another than that in which he had spent the better\npart of his life. In his case contact with the young generation tended\nto unsettlement, to a troublesome persistency of speculations which he\nwould have preferred to dismiss altogether. At the time of his\nmarriage, and for some years after, he was content to make a broad\ndistinction between those intellectual pursuits which afforded him\nrather a liberal amusement than the pleasures of earnest study and the\nquestions of metaphysical faith which concerned his heart and\nconscience. His native prejudices were almost as strong, and much the\nsame, as those of his wife; but with the vagueness of emotional logic\nnatural to his constitution, he satisfied himself that, by conceding a\nfew inessential points, he left himself at liberty to follow the\nscientific movements of the day without damage to his religious\nconvictions. The tolerant smile so frequently on his countenance was\ndirected as often in the one quarter as in the other. Now it signified\na gentle reproof of those men of science who, like Professor Walsh,\n'went too far', whose zeal for knowledge led them 'to forget the source\nof all true enlightenment'; now it expressed a forbearing sympathy with\nsuch as erred in the opposite direction, who were 'too literal in their\ninterpretation of the sacred volume'. Amiable as the smile was, it\nbetrayed weakness, and at moments Martin became unpleasantly conscious\nof indisposition to examine his own mind on certain points. His life,\nindeed, was one of debate postponed. As the realm of science extended,\nas his intercourse with men who frankly avowed their 'infidelity' grew\nmore frequent, he ever and again said to himself that, one of these\ndays, he must sit down and 'have it out' in a solemn self-searching.\nBut for the most part he got on very well amid his inconsistencies.\nReligious faith has rarely any connection with reasoning. Martin\nbelieved because he believed, and avoided the impact of disagreeable\narguments because he wished to do so.\n\nThe bent of his mind was anything but polemical; he cared not to spend\ntime even over those authors whose attacks on the outposts of science,\nor whose elaborate reconcilements of old and new, might have afforded\nhim some support. On the other hand, he altogether lacked that breadth\nof intellect which seeks to comprehend all the results of speculation,\nto discern their tendency, to derive from them a consistent theory of\nthe nature of things. Though a man be well versed in a science such as\npalaeontology it does not follow that he will view it in its\nphilosophical relations. Martin had kept himself informed of all the\nfacts appertaining to his study which the age brought forth, but\nwithout developing the new modes of mental life requisite for the\nrecognition of all that such facts involved. The theories of evolution\nhe did not venture openly to resist, but his acceptance of them was so\nhalf-hearted that practically he made no use of their teaching. He was\nno man of science, but an idler among the wonders which science uses\nfor her own purposes.\n\nHe regarded with surprise and anxiety the tendencies early manifested\nin his son Buckland. Could he have had his way the lad would have grown\nup with an impossible combination of qualities, blending the enthusiasm\nof modern research with a spirit of expansive teleology. Whilst\nBuckland was still of boyish years, the father treated with bantering\ngood-humour such outbreaks of irreverence as came immediately under his\nnotice, weakly abstaining from any attempt at direct argument or\ninfluence. But, at a later time, there took place serious and painful\ndiscussions, and only when the young man had rubbed off his edges in\nthe world's highways could Martin forget that stage of most unwelcome\nconflict.\n\nAt the death of his younger boy, Maurice, he suffered a blow which had\nresults more abiding than the melancholy wherewith for a year or two\nhis genial nature was overshadowed. From that day onwards he was never\nwholly at ease among the pursuits which had been wont to afford him an\nunfailing resource against whatever troubles. He could no longer accept\nand disregard, in a spirit of cheerful faith, those difficulties\nscience was perpetually throwing in his way. The old smile of kindly\ntolerance had still its twofold meaning, but it was more evidently a\ndisguise of indecision, and not seldom touched with sadness. Martin's\nlife was still one of postponed debate, but he could not regard the day\nwhen conclusions would be demanded of him as indefinitely remote.\nDesiring to dwell in the familiar temporary abode, his structure of\nincongruities and facile reconcilements, he found it no longer\nweather-proof. The times were shaking his position with earthquake\nafter earthquake. His sons (for he suspected that Louis was hardly less\nemancipated than Buckland) stood far aloof from him, and must in\nprivate feel contemptuous of his old-fashioned beliefs. In Sidwell,\nhowever, he had a companion more and more indispensable, and he could\nnot imagine that _her_ faith would ever give way before the invading\nspirit of agnosticism. Happily she was no mere pietist. Though he did\nnot quite understand her attitude towards Christianity, he felt assured\nthat Sidwell had thought deeply and earnestly of religion in all its\naspects, and it was a solace to know that she found no difficulty in\nrecognising the large claims of science. For all this, he could not\ndeliberately seek her confidence, or invite her to a discussion of\nreligious subjects. Some day, no doubt, a talk of that kind would begin\nnaturally between them, and so strong was his instinctive faith in\nSidwell that he looked forward to this future communing as to a certain\nhope of peace.\n\nThat a figure such as Godwin Peak, a young man of vigorous intellect,\npreparing to devote his life to the old religion, should excite Mr.\nWarricombe's interest was of course to be anticipated; and it seemed\nprobable enough that Peak, exerting all the force of his character and\naided by circumstances, might before long convert this advantage to a\nmeans of ascendency over the less self-reliant nature. But here was no\ninstance of a dotard becoming the easy prey of a scientific Tartufe.\nMartin's intellect had suffered no decay. His hale features and\ndignified bearing expressed the mind which was ripened by sixty years\nof pleasurable activity, and which was learning to regard with steadier\nview the problems it had hitherto shirked. He could not change the\ndirection nature had given to his thoughts, and prepossession would in\nsome degree obscure his judgment where the merits and trustworthiness\nof a man in Peak's circumstances called for scrutiny; but self-respect\nguarded him against vulgar artifices, and a fine sensibility made it\nimprobable that he would become the victim of any man in whom base\nmotives predominated.\n\nLeft to his own impulses, he would still have proceeded with all\ncaution in his offers of friendly services to Peak. A letter of\ncarefully-worded admonition, which he received from his son, apprising\nhim of Peak's resolve to transfer himself to Exeter, scarcely affected\nhis behaviour when the young man appeared. It was but natural--he\nargued--that Buckland should look askance on a case of 'conversion';\nfor his own part, he understood that such a step might be prompted by\ninterest, but he found it difficult to believe that to a man in Peak's\nposition, the Church would offer temptation thus coercive. Nor could he\ndiscern in the candidate for a curacy any mark of dishonourable\npurpose. Faults, no doubt, were observable, among them a tendency to\nspiritual pride--which seemed (Martin could admit) an argument for,\nrather than against, his sincerity. The progress of acquaintance\ndecidedly confirmed his favourable impressions; they were supported by\nthe remarks of those among his friends to whom Peak presently became\nknown.\n\nIt was not until Whitsuntide of the next year, when the student had\nbeen living nearly five months at Exeter, that Buckland again came down\nto visit his relatives. On the evening of his arrival, chancing to be\nalone with Sidwell, he asked her if Peak had been to the house lately.\n\n'Not many days ago,' replied his sister, 'he lunched with us, and then\nsat with father for some time.'\n\n'Does he come often?'\n\n'Not very often. He is translating a German book which interests father\nvery much.'\n\n'Oh, what book?'\n\n'I don't know. Father has only mentioned it in that way.'\n\nThey were in a little room sacred to the two girls, very daintily\nfurnished and fragrant of sweet-brier, which Sidwell loved so much\nthat, when the season allowed it, she often wore a little spray of it\nat her girdle. Buckland opened a book on the table, and, on seeing the\ntitle, exclaimed with a disparaging laugh:\n\n'I can't get out of the way of this fellow M'Naughten! Wherever I go,\nthere he lies about on the tables and chairs. I should have thought he\nwas thoroughly smashed by an article that came out in _The Critical_\nlast year.'\n\nSidwell smiled, evidently in no way offended.\n\n'That article could \"smash\" nobody,' she made answer. 'It was too\nviolent; it overshot the mark.'\n\n'Not a bit of it!--So you read it, eh? You're beginning to read, are\nyou?'\n\n'In my humble way, Buckland.'\n\n'M'Naughten, among other things. Humble enough, that, I admit.'\n\n'I am not a great admirer of M'Naughten,' returned his sister, with a\nlook of amusement.\n\n'No? I congratulate you.--I wonder what Peak thinks of the book?'\n\n'I really don't know.'\n\n'Then let me ask another question. What do you think of Peak?'\n\nSidwell regarded him with quiet reflectiveness.\n\n'I feel,' she said, 'that I don't know him very well yet. He is\ncertainly interesting.'\n\n'Yes, he is. Does he impress you as the kind of man likely to make a\ngood clergyman?'\n\n'I don't see any reason why he should not.'\n\nHer brother mused, with wrinkles of dissatisfaction on his brow.\n\n'Father gets to like him, you say?'\n\n'Yes, I think father likes him.'\n\n'Well, I suppose it's all right.'\n\n'All right?'\n\n'It's the most astounding thing that ever came under my observation,'\nexclaimed Buckland, walking away and then returning.\n\n'That Mr. Peak should be studying for the Church?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'But do reflect more modestly!' urged Sidwell, with something that was\nnot quite archness, though as near it as her habits of tone and feature\nwould allow. 'Why should you refuse to admit an error in your own way\nof looking at things? Wouldn't it be better to take this as a proof\nthat intellect isn't necessarily at war with Christianity?'\n\n'I never stated it so broadly as that,' returned her brother, with\nimpatience. 'But I should certainly have maintained that _Peak's_\nintellect was necessarily in that position.'\n\n'And you see how wrong you would have been,' remarked the girl, softly.\n\n'Well--I don't know.'\n\n'You don't know?'\n\n'I mean that I can't acknowledge what I can't understand.'\n\n'Then do try to understand, Buckland!--Have you ever put aside your\nprejudice for a moment to inquire what our religion really means? Not\nonce, I think--at all events, not since you reached years of\ndiscretion.'\n\n'Allow me to inform you that I studied the question thoroughly at\nCambridge.'\n\n'Yes, yes; but that was in your boyhood.'\n\n'And when does manhood begin?'\n\n'At different times in different persons. In your case it was late.'\n\nBuckland laughed. He was considering a rejoinder, when they were\ninterrupted by the appearance of Fanny, who asked at once:\n\n'Shall you go to see Mr. Peak this evening, Buckland?'\n\n'I'm in no hurry,' was the abrupt reply.\n\nThe girl hesitated.\n\n'Let us all have a drive together--with Mr. Peak, I mean--like when you\nwere here last.'\n\n'We'll see about it.'\n\nBuckland went slowly from the room.\n\nLate the same evening he sat with his father in the study. Mr\nWarricombe knew not the solace of tobacco, and his son, though never\nquite at ease without pipe or cigar, denied himself in this room, with\nthe result that he shifted frequently upon his chair and fell into many\nawkward postures.\n\n'And how does Peak impress you?' he inquired, when the subject he most\nwished to converse upon had been postponed to many others. It was clear\nthat Martin would not himself broach it.\n\n'Not disagreeably,' was the reply, with a look of frankness, perhaps\nover-emphasised.\n\n'What is he doing? I have only heard from him once since he came down,\nand he had very little to say about himself.'\n\n'I understand that he proposes to take the London B.A.'\n\n'Oh, then, he never did that? Has he unbosomed himself to you about his\naffairs of old time?'\n\n'No. Such confidences are hardly called for.'\n\n'Speaking plainly, father, you don't feel any uneasiness?'\n\nMartin deliberated, fingering the while an engraved stone which hung\nupon his watch-guard. He was at a disadvantage in this conversation.\nAware that Buckland regarded the circumstances of Peak's sojourn in the\nneighbourhood with feelings allied to contempt, he could neither adopt\nthe tone of easy confidence natural to him on other occasions of\ndifference in opinion, nor express himself with the coldness which\nwould have obliged his son to quit the subject.\n\n'Perhaps you had better tell me,' he replied, 'whether _you_ are really\nuneasy.'\n\nIt was impossible for Buckland to answer as his mind prompted. He could\nnot without offence declare that no young man of brains now adopted a\nclerical career with pure intentions, yet such was his sincere belief.\nMade tolerant in many directions by the cultivation of his shrewdness,\nhe was hopelessly biassed in judgment as soon as his anti-religious\nprejudice came into play--a point of strong resemblance between him and\nPeak. After fidgeting for a moment, he exclaimed:\n\n'Yes, I am; but I can't be sure that there's any cause for it.'\n\n'Let us come to matters of fact,' said Mr. Warricombe, showing that he\nwas not sorry to discuss this side of the affair. 'I suppose there is\nno doubt that Peak had a position till lately at the place he speaks\nof?'\n\n'No doubt whatever. I have taken pains to ascertain that. His account\nof himself, so far, is strictly true.'\n\nMartin smiled, with satisfaction he did not care to disguise.\n\n'Have you met some acquaintance of his?'\n\n'Well,' answered Buckland, changing his position, 'I went to work in\nrather an underhand way, perhaps--but the results are satisfactory. No,\nI haven't come across any of his friends, but I happened to hear not\nlong ago that he was on intimate terms with some journalists.'\n\nHis father laughed.\n\n'Anything compromising in that association, Buckland?'\n\n'I don't say that--though the fellows I speak of are hot Radicals.'\n\n'Though?'\n\n'I mean,' replied the young man, with his shrewder smile, 'that they\nare not exactly the companions a theological student would select.'\n\n'I understand. Possibly he has journalised a little himself?'\n\n'That I can't say, though I should have thought it likely enough. I\nmight, of course, find out much more about him, but it seemed to me\nthat to have assurance of his truthfulness in that one respect was\nenough for the present.'\n\n'Do you mean, Buckland,' asked his father, gravely, 'that you have been\nsetting secret police at work?'\n\n'Well, yes. I thought it the least objectionable way of getting\ninformation.'\n\nMartin compressed his lips and looked disapproval.\n\n'I really can't see that such extreme measures were demanded. Come,\ncome; what is all this about? Do you suspect him of planning\nburglaries? That was an ill-judged step, Buckland; decidedly\nill-judged. I said just now that Peak impressed me by no means\ndisagreeably. Now I will add that I am convinced of his good faith--as\nsure of it as I am of his remarkable talents and aptitude for the\nprofession he aims at. In spite of your extraordinary distrust, I can't\nfeel a moment's doubt of his honour. Why, I could have told you myself\nthat he has known Radical journalists. He mentioned it the other day,\nand explained how far his sympathy went with that kind of thing. No,\nno; that was hardly permissible, Buckland.'\n\nThe young man had no difficulty in bowing to his father's reproof when\nthe point at issue was one of gentlemanly behaviour.\n\n'I admit it,' he replied. 'I wish I had gone to Rotherhithe and made\nsimple inquiries in my own name. That, all things considered, I might\nhave allowed myself; at all events, I shouldn't have been at ease\nwithout getting that assurance. If Peak had heard, and had said to me,\n\"What the deuce do you mean?\" I should have told him plainly, what I\nhave strongly hinted to him already, that I don't understand what he is\ndoing in this galley.'\n\n'And have placed yourself in a position not easy to define.'\n\n'No doubt.'\n\n'All this arises, my boy,' resumed Martin, in a tone of grave kindness,\n'from your strange inability to grant that on certain matters you may\nbe wholly misled.'\n\n'It does.'\n\n'Well, well; that is forbidden ground. But do try to be less narrow.\nAre you unable then to meet Peak in a friendly way?'\n\n'Oh, by no means! It seems more than likely that I have wronged him.'\n\n'Well said! Keep your mind open. I marvel at the dogmatism of men who\nare set on overthrowing dogma. Such a position is so strangely\nunphilosophic that I don't know how a fellow of your brains can hold it\nfor a moment. If I were not afraid of angering you,' Martin added, in\nhis pleasantest tone, 'I would quote the Master of Trinity.'\n\n'A capital epigram, but it is repeated too often.'\n\nMr. Warricombe shook his head, and with a laugh rose to say good-night.\n\n'It's a great pity,' he remarked next day to Sidwell, who had been\nsaying that her brother seemed less vivacious than usual, 'that\nBuckland is defective on the side of humour. For a man who claims to be\nphilosophical he takes things with a rather obtuse seriousness. I know\nnothing better than humour as a protection against the kind of mistake\nhe is always committing.'\n\nThe application of this was not clear to Sidwell.\n\n'Has something happened to depress him?' she asked.\n\n'Not that I know of. I spoke only of his general tendency to\nintemperate zeal. That is enough to account for intervals of reaction.\nAnd how much sounder his judgment of men would be if he could only see\nthrough a medium of humour now and then! You know he is going over to\nBudleigh Salterton this afternoon?'\n\nSidwell smiled, and said quietly:\n\n'I thought it likely he would.'\n\nAt Budleigh Salterton, a nook on the coast some fifteen miles away,\nSylvia Moorhouse was now dwelling. Her mother, a widow of substantial\nmeans, had recently established herself there, in the proximity of\nfriends, and the mathematical brother made his home with them. That\nBuckland took every opportunity of enjoying Sylvia's conversation was\nno secret; whether the predilection was mutual, none of his relatives\ncould say, for in a matter such as this Buckland was by nature disposed\nto reticence. Sidwell's intimacy with Miss Moorhouse put her in no\nbetter position than the others for forming an opinion; she could only\nsuspect that the irony which flavoured Sylvia's talk with and\nconcerning the Radical, intimated a lurking kindness. Buckland's\npreference was easily understood, and its growth for five or six years\nseemed to promise stability.\n\nImmediately after luncheon the young man set forth, and did not\nreappear until the evening of the next day. His spirits had not\nbenefited by the excursion; at dinner he was noticeably silent, and\ninstead of going to the drawing-room afterwards he betook himself to\nthe studio up on the roof, and smoked in solitude. There, towards ten\no'clock, Sidwell sought him. Heavy rain was beating upon the glass, and\na high wind blended its bluster with the cheerless sound.\n\n'Don't you find it rather cold here?' she asked, after observing her\nbrother's countenance of gloom.\n\n'Yes; I'm coming down.--Why don't you keep up your painting?'\n\n'I have lost interest in it, I'm afraid.'\n\n'That's very weak, you know. It seems to me that nothing interests you\npermanently.'\n\nSidwell thought it better to make no reply.\n\n'The characteristic of women,' Buckland pursued, with some asperity,\nthrowing away the stump of his cigar. 'It comes, I suppose, of their\nridiculous education--their minds are never trained to fixity of\npurpose. They never understand themselves, and scarcely ever make an\neffort to understand any one else. Their life is a succession of\ninconsistencies.'\n\n'This generalising is so easy,' said Sidwell, with a laugh, 'and so\nworthless. I wonder you should be so far behind the times.'\n\n'What light have the times thrown on the subject?'\n\n'There's no longer such a thing as _woman_ in the abstract. We are\nindividuals.'\n\n'Don't imagine it! That may come to pass three or four generations\nhence, but as yet the best of you can only vary the type in unimportant\nparticulars. By the way, what is Peak's address?'\n\n'Longbrook Street; but I don't know the number. Father can give it you,\nI think.'\n\n'I shall have to drop him a note. I must get back to town early in the\nmorning.'\n\n'Really? We hoped to have you for a week.'\n\n'Longer next time.'\n\nThey descended together. Now that Louis no longer abode here (he had\ndecided at length for medicine, and was at work in London), the family\nas a rule spent very quiet evenings. By ten o'clock Mrs Warricombe and\nFanny had retired, and Sidwell was left either to talk with her father,\nor to pursue the calm meditations which seemed to make her independent\nof companionship as often as she chose.\n\n'Are they all gone?' Buckland asked, finding a vacant room.\n\n'Father is no doubt in the study.'\n\n'It occurs to me--. Do you feel satisfied with this dead-alive\nexistence?'\n\n'Satisfied? No life could suit me better.'\n\n'You really think of living here indefinitely?'\n\n'As far as I am concerned, I hope nothing may ever disturb us.'\n\n'And to the end of your life you will scent yourself with sweetbrier?\nDo try a bit of mint for a change.'\n\n'Certainly, if it will please you.'\n\n'Seriously, I think you might all come to town for next winter. You are\nrusting, all of you. Father was never so dull, and mother doesn't seem\nto know how to pass the days. It wouldn't be bad for Louis to be living\nwith you instead of in lodgings. Do just think of it. It's ages since\nyou heard a concert, or saw a picture.'\n\nSidwell mused, and her brother watched her askance.\n\n'I don't know whether the others would care for it,' she said, 'but I\nam not tempted by a winter of fog.'\n\n'Fog? Pooh! Well, there is an occasional fog, just now and then, but\nit's much exaggerated. Who ever thinks of the weather in England? Fanny\nmight have a time at Bedford College or some such place-she learns\nnothing here. Think it over. Father would be delighted to get among the\nsocieties, and so on.'\n\nHe repeated his arguments in many forms, and Sidwell listened\npatiently, until they were joined by Mr. Warricombe, whereupon the\nsubject dropped; to be resumed, however, in correspondence, with a\npersistency which Buckland seldom exhibited in anything which affected\nthe interests of his relatives. As the summer drew on, Mrs Warricombe\nbegan to lend serious ear to this suggestion of change, and Martin was\nat all events moved to discuss the pros and cons of half a year in\nLondon. Sidwell preserved neutrality, seldom making an allusion to the\nproject; but Fanny supported her brother's proposal with sprightly\nzeal, declaring on one occasion that she began distinctly to feel the\nneed of 'a higher culture', such as London only could supply.\n\nIn the meantime there had been occasional interchange of visits between\nthe family and their friends at Budleigh Salterton. One evening, when\nMrs. Moorhouse and Sylvia were at the Warricombes', three or four\nExeter people came to dine, and among the guests was Godwin Peak--his\ninvitation being due in this instance to Sylvia's express wish to meet\nhim again.\n\n'I am studying men,' she had said to Sidwell not long before, when the\nlatter was at the seaside with her. 'In our day this is the proper\nstudy of womankind. Hitherto we have given serious attention only to\none another. Mr. Peak remains in my memory as a type worth observing;\nlet me have a chance of talking to him when I come next.'\n\nShe did not neglect her opportunity, and Mrs. Moorhouse, who also\nconversed with the theologian and found him interesting, was so good as\nto hope that he would call upon her if ever his steps turned towards\nBudleigh Salterton.\n\nAfter breakfast next morning, Sidwell found her friend sitting with a\nbook beneath one of the great trees of the garden. At that moment\nSylvia was overcome with laughter, evidently occasioned by her reading.\n\n'Oh,' she exclaimed, 'if this man isn't a great humorist! I don't think\nI ever read anything more irresistible.'\n\nThe book was Hugh Miller's _Testimony of the Rocks_, a richly bound\ncopy belonging to Mrs. Warricombe.\n\n'I daresay you know it very well; it's the chapter in which he\ndiscusses, with perfect gravity, whether it would have been possible\nfor Noah to collect examples of all living creatures in the ark. He\ndecides that it wouldn't--that the deluge _must_ have spared a portion\nof the earth; but the details of his argument are delicious, especially\nthis place where he says that all the insects could have been brought\ntogether only \"at enormous expense of miracle\"! I suspected a secret\nsmile; but no--that's out of the question. \"At enormous expense of\nmiracle\"!'\n\nSylvia's eyes winked as she laughed, a peculiarity which enhanced the\ncharm of her frank mirth. Her dark, pure complexion, strongly-marked\neyebrows, subtle lips, were shadowed beneath a great garden hat, and a\nloose white gown, with no oppressive moulding at the waist, made her a\nrefreshing picture in the glare of mid-summer.\n\n'The phrase is ridiculous enough,' assented Sidwell. 'Miracle can be\nbut miracle, however great or small its extent.'\n\n'Isn't it strange, reading a book of this kind nowadays? What a leap we\nhave made! I should think there's hardly a country curate who would be\ncapable of bringing this argument into a sermon.'\n\n'I don't know,' returned Sidwell, smiling. 'One still hears remarkable\nsermons.'\n\n'What will Mr. Peak's be like?'\n\nThey exchanged glances. Sylvia wore a look of reflective curiosity, and\nher friend answered with some hesitation, as if the thought were new to\nher:\n\n'They won't deal with Noah, we may take that for granted.'\n\n'Most likely not with miracles, however little expensive.'\n\n'Perhaps not. I suppose he will deal chiefly with the moral teaching of\nChristianity.'\n\n'Do you think him strong as a moralist?' inquired Sylvia.\n\n'He has very decided opinions about the present state of our\ncivilisation.'\n\n'So I find. But is there any distinctly moral force in him?'\n\n'Father thinks so,' Sidwell replied, 'and so do our friends the\nLilywhites.'\n\nMiss Moorhouse pondered awhile.\n\n'He is a great problem to me,' she declared at length, knitting her\nbrows with a hint of humorous exaggeration. 'I wonder whether he\nbelieves in the dogmas of Christianity.'\n\nSidwell was startled.\n\n'Would he think of becoming a clergyman?'\n\n'Oh, why not? Don't they recognise nowadays that the spirit is enough?'\n\nThere was silence. Sidwell let her eyes wander over the sunny grass to\nthe red-flowering creeper on the nearest side of the house.\n\n'That would involve a great deal of dissimulation,' she said at length.\n'I can't reconcile it with what I know of Mr. Peak.'\n\n'And I can't reconcile anything else,' rejoined the other.\n\n'He impresses you as a rationalist?'\n\n'You not?'\n\n'I confess I have taken his belief for granted. Oh, think! He couldn't\nkeep up such a pretence. However you justify it, it implies conscious\ndeception. It would be dishonourable. I am sure _he_ would think it so.'\n\n'How does your brother regard him?' Sylvia asked, smiling very\nslightly, but with direct eyes.\n\n'Buckland can't credit anyone with sincerity except an aggressive\nagnostic.'\n\n'But I think he allows honest credulity.'\n\nSidwell had no answer to this. After musing a little, she put a\nquestion which indicated how her thoughts had travelled.\n\n'Have you met many women who declared themselves agnostics?'\n\n'Several.'\n\nSylvia removed her hat, and began to fan herself gently with the brim.\nHere, in the shade, bees were humming; from the house came faint notes\nof a piano--Fanny practising a mazurka of Chopin.\n\n'But never, I suppose, one who found a pleasure in attacking\nChristianity?'\n\n'A girl who was at school with me in London,' Sylvia replied, with an\nair of amused reminiscence. 'Marcella Moxey. Didn't I ever speak to you\nof her?'\n\n'I think not.'\n\n'She was bitter against religion of every kind.'\n\n'Because her mother made her learn collects, I dare say?' suggested\nSidwell, in a tone of gentle satire.\n\n'No, no. Marcella was about eighteen then, and had neither father nor\nmother.--(How Fanny's touch improves!)--She was a born atheist, in the\nfullest sense of the word.'\n\n'And detestable?'\n\n'Not to me--I rather liked her. She was remarkably honest, and I have\nsometimes thought that in morals, on the whole, she stood far above\nmost women. She hated falsehood--hated it with all her heart, and a\nstory of injustice maddened her. When I think of Marcella it helps me\nto picture the Russian girls who propagate Nihilism.'\n\n'You have lost sight of her?'\n\n'She went abroad, I think. I should like to have known her fate. I\nrather think there will have to be many like her before women are\ncivilised.'\n\n'How I should like to ask her,' said Sidwell, 'on what she supported\nher morality?'\n\n'Put the problem to Mr. Peak,' suggested the other, gaily. 'I fancy he\nwouldn't find it insoluble.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe and Mrs. Moorhouse appeared in the distance, walking\nhither under parasols. The girls rose to meet them, and were presently\nengaged in less interesting colloquy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThis summer Peak became a semi-graduate of London University. To avoid\nthe risk of a casual meeting with acquaintances, he did not go to\nLondon, but sat for his examination at the nearest provincial centre.\nThe revival of boyish tremors at the successive stages of this business\nwas anything but agreeable; it reminded him, with humiliating force,\nhow far he had strayed from the path indicated to his self-respecting\nmanhood. Defeat would have strengthened in overwhelming revolt all the\nimpulses which from time to time urged him to abandon his servile\ncourse. But there was no chance of his failing to satisfy the\nexaminers. With 'Honours' he had now nothing to do; enough for his\npurpose that in another year's time he would write himself Bachelor of\nArts, and thus simplify the clerical preliminaries. In what quarter he\nwas to look for a curacy remained uncertain. Meanwhile his enterprise\nseemed to prosper, and success emboldened his hopes.\n\nHopes which were no longer vague, but had defined themselves in a way\nwhich circumstances made inevitable. Though he had consistently guarded\nhimself against the obvious suggestions arising out of his intercourse\nwith the Warricombe family, though he still emphasised every\ndiscouraging fact, and strove to regard it as axiomatic that nothing\ncould be more perilous to his future than a hint of presumption or\nself-interest in word or deed beneath that friendly roof, it was coming\nto pass that he thought of Sidwell not only as the type of woman\npursued by his imagination, but as herself the object of his converging\ndesires. Comparison of her with others had no result but the deepening\nof that impression she had at first made upon him. Sidwell exhibited\nall the qualities which most appealed to him in her class; in addition,\nshe had the charms of a personality which he could not think of common\noccurrence. He was yet far from understanding her; she exercised his\npowers of observation, analysis, conjecture, as no other person had\never done; each time he saw her (were it but for a moment) he came away\nwith some new perception of her excellence, some hitherto unmarked\ngrace of person or mind whereon to meditate. He had never approached a\nwoman who possessed this power at once of fascinating his senses and\ncontrolling his intellect to a glad reverence. Whether in her presence\nor musing upon her in solitude, he found that the unsparing naturalism\nof his scrutiny was powerless to degrade that sweet, pure being.\n\nRare, under any circumstances, is the passionate love which controls\nevery motive of heart and mind; rarer still that form of it which, with\nno assurance of reciprocation, devotes exclusive ardour to an object\nonly approachable through declared obstacles. Godwin Peak was not\nframed for romantic languishment. In general, the more complex a man's\nmechanism, and the more pronounced his habit of introspection, the less\ncapable is he of loving with vehemence and constancy. Heroes of passion\nare for the most part primitive natures, nobly tempered; in our time\nthey tend to extinction. Growing vulgarism on the one hand, and on the\nother a development of the psychological conscience, are unfavourable\nto any relation between the sexes, save those which originate in pure\nanimalism, or in reasoning less or more generous. Never having\nexperienced any feeling which he could dignify with the name of love,\nGodwin had no criterion in himself whereby to test the emotions now\nbesetting him. In a man of his age this was an unusual state of things,\nfor when the ardour which will bear analysis has at length declared\nitself, it is wont to be moderated by the regretful memory of that\nfugacious essence which gave to the first frenzy of youth its\nirrecoverable delight. He could not say in reply to his impulses: If\nthat was love which overmastered me, this must be something either more\nor less exalted. What he _did_ say was something of this kind: If\ndesire and tenderness, if frequency of dreaming rapture, if the calmest\napproval of the mind and the heart's most exquisite, most painful\nthrobbing, constitute love,--then assuredly I love Sidwell. But if to\nlove is to be possessed with madness, to lose all taste of life when\nhope refuses itself, to meditate frantic follies, to deem it\ninconceivable that this woman should ever lose her dominion over me, or\nanother reign in her stead,--then my passion falls short of the true\ntestrum, and I am only dallying with fancies which might spring up as\noften as I encountered a charming girl.\n\nAll things considered, to encourage this amorous preoccupation was\nprobably the height of unwisdom. The lover is ready at deluding\nhimself, but Peak never lost sight of the extreme unlikelihood that he\nshould ever become Martin Warricombe's son-in-law, of the thousand\nrespects which forbade his hoping that Sidwell would ever lay her hand\nin his. That deep-rooted sense of class which had so much influence on\nhis speculative and practical life asserted itself, with rigid\nconsistency, even against his own aspirations; he attributed to the\nWarricombes more prejudice on this subject than really existed in them.\nHe, it was true, belonged to no class whatever, acknowledged no\nsubordination save that of the hierarchy of intelligence; but this\ncould not obscure the fact that his brother sold seeds across a\ncounter, that his sister had married a haberdasher, that his uncle\n(notoriously) was somewhere or other supplying the public with cheap\nrepasts. Girls of Sidwell's delicacy do not misally themselves, for\nthey take into account the fact that such misalliance is fraught with\nelements of unhappiness, affecting husband as much as wife. No need to\ndwell upon the scruples suggested by his moral attitude; he would never\nbe called upon to combat them with reference to Sidwell's future.\n\nWhat, then, was he about? For what advantage was he playing the\nhypocrite? Would he, after all, be satisfied with some such wife as the\naverage curate may hope to marry?\n\nA hundred times he reviewed the broad question, by the light of his six\nmonths' experience. Was Sidwell Warricombe his ideal woman, absolutely\nspeaking? Why, no; not with all his glow of feeling could he persuade\nhimself to declare her that. Satisfied up to a certain point, admitted\nto the sphere of wealthy refinement, he now had leisure to think of yet\nhigher grades, of the women who are not only exquisite creatures by\nsocial comparison but rank by divine right among the foremost of their\nrace. Sidwell was far from intolerant, and held her faiths in a\nsincerely ethical spirit. She judged nobly, she often saw with clear\nvision. But must not something of kindly condescension always blend\nwith his admiring devotedness? Were it but possible to win the love of\na woman who looked forth with eyes thoroughly purged from all mist of\ntradition and conventionalism, who was at home among arts and sciences,\nwho, like himself, acknowledged no class and bowed to no authority but\nthat of the supreme human mind!\n\nSuch women are to be found in every age, but how many of them shine\nwith the distinctive ray of womanhood? These are so rare that they have\na place in the pages of history. The truly emancipated woman--it was\nGodwin's conviction--is almost always asexual; to him, therefore,\nutterly repugnant. If, then, he were not content to waste his life in a\nvain search for the priceless jewel, which is won and worn only by\nfortune's supreme favourites, he must acquiesce in the imperfect\nmarriage commonly the lot of men whose intellect allows them but little\ncompanionship even among their own sex: for that matter, the lot of\nmost men, and necessarily so until the new efforts in female education\nshall have overcome the vice of wedlock as hitherto sanctioned. Nature\nprovides the hallucination which flings a lover at his mistress's feet.\nFor the chill which follows upon attainment she cares nothing--let\nsociety and individuals make their account with that as best they may.\nEven with a wife such as Sidwell the process of disillusion would\ndoubtless have to be faced, however liberal one's allowances in the\nforecast.\n\nReflections of this colour were useful; they helped to keep within\nlimits the growth of agitating desire. But there were seasons when\nGodwin surrendered himself to luxurious reverie, hours of summer\ntwilight which forbade analysis and listened only to the harmonies of\npassion. Then was Sidwell's image glorified, and all the delights\npromised by such love as hers fired his imagination to intolerable\necstasy. O heaven! to see the smile softened by rosy warmth which would\nconfess that she had given her heart--to feel her supple fingers\nintertwined with his that clasped them--to hear the words in which a\nmind so admirable, instincts so delicate, would make expression of\ntheir tenderness! To live with Sidwell--to breathe the fragrance of\nthat flower of womanhood in wedded intimacy--to prove the devotion of a\nnature so profoundly chaste! The visionary transport was too poignant;\nin the end it drove him to a fierce outbreak of despairing wrath. How\ncould he dream that such bliss would be the reward of despicable\nartifice, of calculated dishonour? Born a rebel, how could his be the\nfate of those happy men who are at one with the order of things? The\nprophecy of a heart wrung with anguish foretold too surely that for him\nwas no rapturous love, no joy of noble wedlock. Solitude, now and for\never, or perchance some base alliance of the flesh, which would involve\nhis later days in sordid misery.\n\nIn moods of discouragement he thought with envy of his old self, his\nlife in London lodgings, his freedom in obscurity. It belongs to the\npathos of human nature that only in looking back can one appreciate the\ntrue value of those long tracts of monotonous ease which, when we are\nliving through them, seem of no account save in relation to past or\nfuture; only at a distance do we perceive that the exemption from\npainful shock was in itself a happiness, to be rated highly in\ncomparison with most of those disturbances known as moments of joy. A\nwise man would have entertained no wish but that he might grow old in\nthat same succession of days and weeks and years. Without anxiety\nconcerning his material needs (certainly the most substantial of\nearthly blessings), his leisure not inadequate to the gratification of\na moderate studiousness, with friends who offered him an ever-ready\nwelcome,--was it not much? If he were condemned to bachelorhood, his\nphilosophy was surely capable of teaching him that the sorrows and\nanxieties he thus escaped made more than an offset against the\nsatisfactions he must forego. Reason had no part in the fantastic\nchange to which his life had submitted, nor was he ever supported by a\nhope which would bear his cooler investigation.\n\nAnd yet hope had her periods of control, for there are times when the\nmind wearies of rationality, and, as it were in self-defense, in\nobedience to the instinct of progressive life, craves a specious\ncomfort. It seemed undeniable that Mr. Warricombe regarded him with\ngrowth of interest, invited his conversation more unreservedly. He\nbegan to understand Martin's position with regard to religion and\nscience, and thus could utter himself more securely. At length he\nventured to discourse with some amplitude on his own convictions--the\nviews, that is to say, which he thought fit to adopt in his character\nof a liberal Christian. It was on an afternoon of early August that\nthis opportunity presented itself. They sat together in the study, and\nMartin was in a graver mood than usual, not much disposed to talk, but\na willing listener. There had been mention of a sermon at the\nCathedral, in which the preacher declared his faith that the maturity\nof science would dispel all antagonisms between it and revelation.\n\n'The difficulties of the unbeliever,' said Peak, endeavouring to avoid\na sermonising formality, though with indifferent success, 'are, of\ncourse, of two kinds; there's the theory of evolution, and there's\nmodern biblical criticism. The more I study these objections, the less\nable I am to see how they come in conflict with belief in Christianity\nas a revealed religion.'\n\n'Yet you probably had your time of doubt?' remarked the other, touching\nfor the first time on this personal matter.\n\n'Oh, yes; that was inevitable. It only means that one's development is\nimperfect. Most men who confirm themselves in agnosticism are kept at\nthat point by arrested moral activity. They give up the intellectual\nquestion as wearisome, and accept the point of view which flatters\ntheir prejudices: thereupon follows a blunting of the sensibilities on\nthe religious side.'\n\n'There are men constitutionally unfitted for the reception of spiritual\ntruth,' said Martin, in a troubled tone. He was playing with a piece of\nstring, and did not raise his eyes.\n\n'I quite believe that. There's our difficulty when we come to\nevidences. The evidences of science are wholly different in _kind_ from\nthose of religion. Faith cannot spring from any observation of\nphenomena, or scrutiny of authorities, but from the declaration made to\nus by the spiritual faculty. The man of science can only become a\nChristian by the way of humility--and that a kind of humility he finds\nit difficult even to conceive. One wishes to impress upon him the\nharmony of this faith with the spiritual voice that is in every man. He\nreplies: I know nothing of that spiritual voice. And if that be true,\none can't help him by argument.'\n\nPeak had constructed for himself, out of his reading, a plausible\nsystem which on demand he could set forth with fluency. The tone of\ncurrent apologetics taught him that, by men even of cultivated\nintellect, such a position as he was now sketching was deemed tenable;\nyet to himself it sounded so futile, so nugatory, that he had to harden\nhis forehead as he spoke. Trial more severe to his conscience lay in\nthe perceptible solicitude with which Mr Warricombe weighed these\ndisingenuous arguments. It was a hateful thing to practise such\ndeception on one who probably yearned for spiritual support. But he had\ncommitted himself to this course, and must brave it out.\n\n'Christianity,' he was saying presently--appropriating a passage of\nwhich he had once made careful note--'is an organism of such vital\nenergy that it perforce assimilates whatever is good and true in the\nculture of each successive age. To understand this is to learn that we\nmust depend rather on _constructive_, than on _defensive_, apology.\nThat is to say, we must draw evidence of our faith from its latent\ncapacities, its unsuspected affinities, its previsions, its\nadaptability, comprehensiveness, sympathy, adequacy to human needs.'\n\n'That puts very well what I have always felt,' replied Mr Warricombe.\n'Yet there will remain the objection that such a faith may be of purely\nhuman origin. If evolution and biblical criticism seem to overthrow all\nthe historic evidences of Christianity, how convince the objectors that\nthe faith itself was divinely given?'\n\n'But I cannot hold for a moment,' exclaimed Peak, in the words which he\nknew his interlocutor desired to hear, 'that all the historic evidences\nhave been destroyed. That indeed would shake our position.'\n\nHe enlarged on the point, with display of learning, yet studiously\navoiding the tone of pedantry.\n\n'Evolution,' he remarked, when the dialogue had again extended its\nscope, 'does not touch the evidence of design in the universe; at most\nit can correct our imperfect views (handed down from an age which had\nno scientific teaching because it was not ripe for it) of the mode in\nwhich that design was executed, or rather is still being executed.\nEvolutionists have not succeeded in explaining life; they have merely\ndiscovered a new law relating to life. If we must have an explanation,\nthere is nothing for it but to accept the notion of a Deity. Indeed,\nhow can there be religion without a divine author? Religion is based on\nthe idea of a divine mind which reveals itself to us for moral ends.\nThe Christian revelation, we hold, has been developed gradually, much\nof it in connection with secondary causes and human events. It has come\ndown to us in anything but absolute purity--like a stream which has\nbeen made turbid by its earthly channel. The lower serves its purpose\nas a stage to the higher, then it falls away, the higher surviving.\nHitherto, the final outcome of evolution is the soul in a bodily\ntenement. May it not be that the perfected soul alone survives in the\nlast step of the struggle for existence?'\n\nPeak had been talking for more than a quarter of an hour. Under stress\nof shame and intellectual self-criticism (for he could not help\nconfuting every position as he stated it) his mind often wandered. When\nhe ceased speaking there came upon him an uncomfortable dreaminess\nwhich he had already once or twice experienced when in colloquy with\nMr. Warricombe; a tormenting metaphysical doubt of his own identity\nstrangely beset him. With involuntary attempt to recover the familiar\nself he grasped his own wrist, and then, before he was aware, a laugh\nescaped him, an all but mocking laugh, unsuitable enough to the spirit\nof the moment. Mr Warricombe was startled, but looked up with a\nfriendly smile.\n\n'You fear,' he said, 'that this last speculation may seem rather\nfanciful to me?'\n\nGodwin was biting his lip fiercely, and could not command himself to\nutterance of a word.\n\n'By no means, I assure you,' added the other. 'It appeals to me very\nstrongly.'\n\nPeak rose from his chair.\n\n'It struck me,' he said, 'that I had been preaching a sermon rather\nthan taking part in a conversation. I'm afraid it is the habit of men\nwho live a good deal alone to indulge in monologues.'\n\nOn his return home, the sight of _Bibel und Natur_ and his sheets of\nlaborious manuscript filled him with disgust. It was two or three days\nbefore he could again apply himself to the translation. Yet this\nexpedient had undoubtedly been of great service to him in the matter of\nhis relations with Mr. Warricombe. Without the aid of Reusch he would\nhave found it difficult to speak naturally on the theme which drew\nMartin into confidences and established an intimacy between them.\n\nAlready they had discussed in detail the first half of the book. How a\nman of Mr. Warricombe's intelligence could take grave interest in an\narid exegesis of the first chapter of Genesis, Godwin strove in vain to\ncomprehend. Often enough the debates were perilously suggestive of\nburlesque, and, when alone, he relieved himself of the laughter he had\nscarce restrained. For instance, there was that terrible _thohu wabohu_\nof the second verse, a phrase preserved from the original, and tossed\ninto all the corners of controversy. Was _thohu wabohu_ the first\ncondition of the earth, or was it merely a period of division between a\nprevious state of things and creation as established by the Hexaemeron?\nDid light exist or not, previous to the _thohu wabohu_? Then, again,\nwhat kind of 'days' were the three which passed before the birth of the\nsun? Special interest, of course, attached to the successive theories\nof theology on the origin of geologic strata. First came the 'theory of\nrestitution', which explained unbiblical antiquity by declaring that\nthe strata belonged to a world before the Hexaimeron, a world which had\nbeen destroyed, and succeeded by the new creation. Less objectionable\nwas the 'concordistic theory', which interprets the 'six days' as so\nmany vast periods of creative activity. But Reusch himself gave\npreference to the 'ideal theory', the supporters whereof (diligently\nadapting themselves to the progress of science) hold that the six days\nare not to be understood as consecutive periods at all, but merely as\nsix phases of the Creator's work.\n\nBy the exercise of watchfulness and dexterity, Peak managed for the\nmost part to avoid expression of definite opinions. His attitude was\nthat of a reverent (not yet reverend) student. Mr. Warricombe was less\nguarded, and sometimes allowed himself to profess that he saw nothing\nbut vain ingenuity in Reusch's argument: as, for example, where the\ntheologian, convinced that the patriarchs did really live to an\nabnormal age, suggests that man's life was subsequently shortened in\norder that 'sin might not flourish with such exuberance'. This passage\ncaused Martin to smile.\n\n'It won't do, it won't do,' he said, quietly. 'Far better apply his\nrationalism here as elsewhere. These are wonderful old stories, not to\nbe understood literally. Nothing depends upon them nothing essential.'\n\nThereupon Peak mused anxiously. Not for the first time there occurred\nto him a thought which suited only too well with his ironic habits of\nmind. What if this hypocritic comedy were altogether superfluous? What\nif Mr. Warricombe would have received him no less cordially had he\navowed his sincere position, and contented himself with guarding\nagainst offensiveness? Buckland, it was true, had suffered in his\nfather's esteem on account of his unorthodoxy, but that young man had\nbeen too aggressive, too scornful. With prudence, would it not have\nbeen possible to win Martin's regard by fortifying the scientific\nrather than the dogmatic side of his intellect? If so, what a hopeless\nerror had he committed!--But Sidwell? Was _she_ liberal enough to take\na personal interest in one who had renounced faith in revelation? He\ncould not decide this question, for of Sidwell he knew much less than\nof her father. And it was idle to torment himself with such debate of\nthe irreversible.\n\nAnd, indeed, there seemed much reason for believing that Martin,\nwhatever the extent of his secret doubts, was by temperament armed\nagainst agnosticism. Distinctly it comforted him to hear the\nunbelievers assailed--the friends of whom he spoke most heartily were\nall on the orthodox side; if ever a hint of gentle malice occurred in\nhis conversation, it was when he spoke of a fallacy, a precipitate\nconclusion, detected in works of science. Probably he was too old to\novercome this bias.\n\nHis view of the Bible appeared to harmonise with that which Peak put\nforth in one of their dialogues. 'The Scriptures were meant to be\nliterally understood in primitive ages, and spiritually when the growth\nof science made it possible. _Genesis_ was never intended to teach the\nfacts of natural history; it takes phenomena as they appear to\nuninstructed people, and uses them only for the inculcation of moral\nlessons; it presents to the childhood of the world a few great\nelementary truths. And the way in which phenomena are spoken of in the\nOld Testament is never really incompatible with the facts as we know\nthem nowadays. Take the miracle of the sun standing still, which is\nsupposed to be a safe subject of ridicule. Why, it merely means that\nlight was miraculously prolonged; the words used are those which common\npeople would at all times understand.'\n\n(Was it necessary to have admitted the miracle? Godwin asked himself.\nAt all events Mr. Warricombe nodded approvingly.)\n\n'Then the narrative of the creation of man; that's not at all\nincompatible with his slow development through ages. To teach the\nscientific fact--if we yet really know it--would have been worse than\nuseless. The story is meant to express that spirit, and not matter, is\nthe source of all existence. Indeed, our knowledge of the true meaning\nof the Bible has increased with the growth of science, and naturally\nthat must have been intended from the first. Things which do not\nconcern man's relation to the spiritual have no place in this book;\nthey are not within its province. Such things were discoverable by\nhuman reason, and the knowledge which achieves has nothing to do with a\ndivine revelation.'\n\nTo Godwin it was a grinding of the air, but the listener appeared to\nthink it profitable.\n\nWith his clerical friend, Mr. Lilywhite, he rarely touched on matters\nof religion. The vicar of St. Ethelreda's was a man well suited to\nsupport the social dignity of his Church. A gentleman before\neverything, he seemed incapable of prying into the state of a\nparishioner's soul; you saw in him the official representative of a\nDivinity characterised by well-bred tolerance. He had written a\npleasant little book on the by-ways of Devon and Cornwall, which\nbrought about his intimacy with the Warricombe household. Peak liked\nhim more the better he knew him, and in the course of the summer they\nhad one or two long walks together, conversing exclusively of the\nthings of earth. Mr. Lilywhite troubled himself little about evolution;\nhe spoke of trees and plants, of birds and animals, in a loving spirit,\nlike the old simple naturalists. Geology did not come within his sphere.\n\n'I'm very sorry,' he said, 'that I could never care much for it. Don't\nthink I'm afraid of it--not I! I feel the grandeur of its scope, just\nas I do in the case of astronomy; but I have never brought myself to\nstudy either science. A narrowness of mind, no doubt. I can't go into\nsuch remote times and regions. I love the sunlight and the green fields\nof this little corner of the world--too well, perhaps: yes, perhaps too\nwell.'\n\nAfter one of these walks, he remarked to Mrs. Lilywhite:\n\n'It's my impression that Mr. Peak has somehow been misled in his choice\nof a vocation. I don't think he'll do as a churchman.'\n\n'Why not, Henry?' asked his wife, with gentle concern, for she still\nspoke of Peak's 'quiet moral force'.\n\n'There's something too restless about him. I doubt whether he has\nreally made up his mind on any subject whatever. Well, it's not easy to\nexplain what I feel, but I don't think he will take Orders.'\n\nCalling at the vicarage one afternoon in September, Godwin found Mrs\nLilywhite alone. She startled him by saying at once:\n\n'An old acquaintance of yours was with us yesterday, Mr. Peak.'\n\n'Who could that be, I wonder?'\n\nHe smiled softly, controlling his impulse to show quite another\nexpression.\n\n'You remember Mr. Bruno Chilvers?'\n\n'Oh, yes!'\n\nThere was a constriction in his throat. Struggling to overcome it, he\nadded:\n\n'But I should have thought he had no recollection of me.'\n\n'Quite the contrary, I assure you. He is to succeed Mr. Bell of St\nMargaret's, at Christmas; he was down here only for a day or two, and\ncalled upon my husband with a message from an old friend of ours. It\nappears he used to know the Warricombes, when they lived at Kingsmill,\nand he had been to see them before visiting us; it was there your name\nwas mentioned to him.'\n\nGodwin had seated himself, and leaned forward, his hands grasping the\nglove he had drawn off.\n\n'We were contemporaries at Whitelaw College,' he observed.\n\n'So we learnt from him. He spoke of you with the greatest interest; he\nwas delighted to hear that you contemplated taking Orders. Of course we\nknew Mr. Chilvers by reputation, but my husband had no idea that he was\ncoming to Exeter. What an energetic man he is! In a few hours he seemed\nto have met everyone, and to have learnt everything. My husband says he\nfelt quite rebuked by such a display of vigour!'\n\nEven in his discomposure, graver than any that had affected him since\nhis talks with Buckland Warricombe, Peak was able to notice that the\nRev. Bruno had not made a wholly favourable impression upon the\nLilywhites. There was an amiable causticity in that mention of his\n'display of vigour', such as did not often characterise Mrs Lilywhite's\ncomments. Finding that the vicar would be away till evening, Godwin\nstayed for only a quarter of an hour, and when he had escaped it\nirritated and alarmed him to reflect how unusual his behaviour must\nhave appeared to the good lady.\n\nThe blow was aimed at his self-possession from such an unlikely\nquarter. In Church papers he had frequently come across Chilvers's\nname, and the sight of it caused him a twofold disturbance: it was\nhateful to have memories of humiliation revived, and perhaps still more\nharassing to be forced upon acknowledgment of the fact that he stood as\nan obscure aspirant at the foot of the ladder which his old rival was\ntriumphantly ascending. Bad enough to be classed in any way with such a\nman as Chilvers; but to be regarded as at one with him in religious\nfaith, to be forbidden the utterance of scorn when Chilvers was\nextolled, stung him so keenly that he rushed into any distraction to\nelude the thought. When he was suffering shame under the gaze of\nBuckland Warricombe he remembered Chilvers, and shrank as before a\nmerited scoff. But the sensation had not been abiding enough to affect\nhis conduct. He had said to himself that he should never come in\ncontact with the fellow, and that, after all, community of religious\nprofession meant no more, under their respective circumstances, than if\nboth were following law or physic.\n\nBut the unforeseen had happened. In a few months, the Rev. Bruno\nChilvers would be a prominent figure about the streets of Exeter; would\nbe frequently seen at the Warricombes', at the Lilywhites', at the\nhouses of their friends. His sermons at St. Margaret's would doubtless\nattract, and form a staple topic of conversation. Worse than all, his\nexpressions of 'interest' and 'delight' made it probable that he would\nseek out his College competitor and offer the hand of brotherhood.\nThese things were not to be avoided--save by abandonment of hopes, save\nby retreat, by yielding to a hostile destiny.\n\nThat Chilvers might talk here and there of Whitelaw stories was\ncomparatively unimportant. The Warricombes must already know all that\ncould be told, and what other people heard did not much matter. It was\nthe man himself that Peak could not endure. Dissembling had hitherto\nbeen no light task. The burden had more than once pressed so gallingly\nthat its permanent support seemed impossible; but to stand before Bruno\nChilvers in the attitude of humble emulation, to give respectful ear\nwhilst the popular cleric advised or encouraged, or bestowed pontifical\npraise, was comparable only to a searing of the flesh with red irons.\nEven with assured prospect of recompense in the shape of Sidwell\nWarricombe's heart and hand, he could hardly submit to such an ordeal.\nAs it was, reason having so often convinced him that he clung to a\nvisionary hope, the torture became gratuitous, and its mere suggestion\ninspired him with a fierce resentment destructive of all his purposes.\n\nFor several days he scarcely left the house. To wrath and dread had\nsucceeded a wretched torpor, during which his mind kept revolving the\nthoughts prompted by his situation, turbidly and to no issue. He tasted\nall the bitterness of the solitude to which he had condemned himself;\nthere was not a living soul with whom he could commune. At moments he\nwas possessed with the desire of going straightway to London, and\nmaking Earwaker the confidant of all his folly. But that demanded an\nexertion of which he was physically incapable. He thought of the old\nhome at Twybridge, and was tempted also in that direction. His mother\nwould welcome him with human kindness; beneath her roof he could lie\ndormant until fate should again point his course. He even wrote a\nletter saying that in all probability he should pay a visit to\nTwybridge before long. But the impulse was only of an hour's duration,\nfor he remembered that to talk with his mother would necessitate all\nmanner of new falsehoods, a thickening of the atmosphere of lies which\nalready oppressed him. No; if he quitted Exeter, it must be on a longer\njourney. He must resume his purpose of seeking some distant country,\nwhere new conditions of life would allow him to try his fortune at\nleast as an honest adventurer. In many parts of colonial England his\ntechnical knowledge would have a value, and were there not women to be\nwon beneath other skies--women perhaps of subtler charm than the old\nhidebound civilisation produced? Reminiscences of scenes and figures in\nnovels he had read nourished the illusion. He pictured some thriving\nlittle town at the ends of the earth, where a young Englishman of good\nmanners and unusual culture would easily be admitted to the intimacy of\nthe richest families; he saw the ideal colonist (a man of good birth,\nbut a sower of wild oats in his youth) with two or three daughters\nabout him--beautiful girls, wondrously self-instructed--living amid\nromantic dreams of the old world, and of the lover who would some day\ncarry them off (with a substantial share of papa's wealth) to Europe\nand the scenes of their imagination.\n\nThe mind has marvellous methods of self-defence against creeping\nlethargy of despair. At the point to which he had been reduced by\nseveral days of blank despondency, Peak was able to find genuine\nencouragement in visions such as this. He indulged his fancy until the\nvital force began to stir once more within him, and then, with one\nangry sweep, all his theological books and manuscripts were flung out\nof sight. Away with this detestable mummery! Now let Bruno Chilvers\npour his eloquence from the pulpit of St. Margaret's, and rear to what\nheights he could the edifice of his social glory; men of that stamp\nwere alone fitted to thrive in England. Was not _he_ almost certainly a\nhypocrite, masking his brains (for brains he had) under a show of\nbroadest Anglicanism? But his career was throughout consistent. He trod\nin the footsteps of his father, and with inherited aptitude moulded\nantique traditions into harmony with the taste of the times. Compared\nwith such a man, Peak felt himself a bungler. The wonder was that his\nclumsy lying had escaped detection.\n\nAnother day, and he had done nothing whatever, but was still buoyed up\nby the reaction of visionary hope. His need now was of communicating\nhis change of purpose to some friendly hearer. A week had passed since\nhe had exchanged a word with anyone but Mrs. Roots, and converse he\nmust. Why not with Mr. Warricombe? That was plainly the next step: to\nsee Martin and make known to him that after all he could not become a\nclergyman. No need of hinting a conscientious reason. At all events,\nnothing more definite than a sense of personal unfitness, a growing\nperception of difficulties inherent in his character. It would be very\ninteresting to hear Mr. Warricombe's replies.\n\nA few minutes after this decision was taken, he set off towards the Old\nTiverton Road, walking at great speed, flourishing his stick--symptoms\nof the nervous cramp (so to speak) which he was dispelling. He reached\nthe house, and his hand was on the bell, when an unexpected opening of\nthe door presented Louis Warricombe just coming forth for a walk. They\nexchanged amiabilities, and Louis made known that his father and mother\nwere away on a visit to friends in Cornwall.\n\n'But pray come in,' he added, offering to re-enter.\n\nPeak excused himself, for it was evident that Louis made a sacrifice to\ncourtesy. But at that moment there approached from the garden Fanny\nWarricombe and her friend Bertha Lilywhite, eldest daughter of the\ngenial vicar; they shook hands with Godwin, Fanny exclaiming:\n\n'Don't go away, Mr. Peak. Have a cup of tea with us--Sidwell is at\nhome. I want to show you a strange sort of spleenwort that I gathered\nthis morning.'\n\n'In that case,' said her brother, smiling, 'I may confess that I have\nan appointment. Pray forgive me for hurrying off, Mr. Peak.'\n\nGodwin was embarrassed, but the sprightly girl repeated her summons,\nand he followed into the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nHaving led the way to the drawing-room, Fanny retired again for a few\nmoments, to fetch the fern of which she had spoken, leaving Peak in\nconversation with little Miss Lilywhite. Bertha was a rather shy girl\nof fifteen, not easily induced, under circumstances such as these, to\nutter more than monosyllables, and Godwin, occupied with the unforeseen\nresults of his call, talked about the weather. With half-conscious\nabsurdity he had begun to sketch a theory of his own regarding\nrain-clouds and estuaries (Bertha listening with an air of the gravest\nattention) when Fanny reappeared, followed by Sidwell. Peak searched\nthe latter's face for indications of her mood, but could discover\nnothing save a spirit of gracious welcome. Such aspect was a matter of\ncourse, and he knew it. None the less, his nervousness and the state of\nmind engendered by a week's miserable solitude, tempted him to believe\nthat Sidwell did not always wear that smile in greeting a casual\ncaller. This was the first time that she had received him without the\ncountenance of Mrs. Warricombe. Observing her perfect manner, as she\nsat down and began to talk, he asked himself what her age really was.\nThe question had never engaged his thoughts. Eleven years ago, when he\nsaw her at the house near Kingsmill and again at Whitelaw College, she\nlooked a very young girl, but whether of thirteen or sixteen he could\nnot at the time have determined, and such a margin of possibility\nallowed her now to have reached--it might be--her twenty-seventh\nsummer. But twenty-seven drew perilously near to thirty; no, no,\nSidwell could not be more than twenty-five. Her eyes still had the dewy\nfreshness of flowering maidenhood; her cheek, her throat, were so\nexquisitely young----\n\nIn how divine a calm must this girl have lived to show, even at\nfive-and-twenty, features as little marked by inward perturbation as\nthose of an infant! Her position in the world considered, one could\nforgive her for having borne so lightly the inevitable sorrows of life,\nfor having dismissed so readily the spiritual doubts which were the\nheritage of her time; but was she a total stranger to passion? Did not\nthe fact of her still remaining unmarried make probable such a\ndeficiency in her nature? Had she a place among the women whom coldness\nof temperament preserves in a bloom like that of youth, until fading\nhair and sinking cheek betray them----?\n\nWhilst he thought thus, Godwin was in appearance busy with the fern\nFanny had brought for his inspection. He talked about it, but in\nsnatches, with intervals of abstractedness.\n\nYet might he not be altogether wrong? Last year, when he observed\nSidwell in the Cathedral and subsequently at home, his impression had\nbeen that her face was of rather pallid and dreamy cast; he recollected\nthat distinctly. Had she changed, or did familiarity make him less\nsensible of her finer traits? Possibly she enjoyed better health\nnowadays, and, if so, it might result from influences other than\nphysical. Her air of quiet happiness seemed to him especially\nnoticeable this afternoon, and as he brooded there came upon him a\ndread which, under the circumstances, was quite irrational, but for all\nthat troubled his views. Perhaps Sidwell was betrothed to some one? He\nknew of but one likely person--Miss Moorhouse's brother. About a month\nago the Warricombes had been on a visit at Budleigh Salterton, and\nsomething might then have happened. Pangs of jealousy smote him, nor\ncould he assuage them by reminding himself that he had no concern\nwhatever in Sidwell's future.\n\n'Will Mr. Warricombe be long away?' he asked, coldly.\n\n'A day or two. I hope you didn't wish particularly to see him to-day?'\n\n'Oh, no.'\n\n'Do you know, Mr. Peak,' put in Fanny, 'that we are all going to London\nnext month, to live there for half a year?'\n\nGodwin exhibited surprise. He looked from the speaker to her sister,\nand Sidwell, as she smiled confirmation, bent very slightly towards him.\n\n'We have made up our minds, after much uncertainty,' she said. 'My\nbrother Buckland seems to think that we are falling behind in\ncivilisation.'\n\n'So we are,' affirmed Fanny, 'as Mr. Peak would admit, if only he could\nbe sincere.'\n\n'Am I never sincere then, Miss Fanny?' Godwin asked.\n\n'I only meant to say that nobody can be when the rules of politeness\ninterfere. Don't you think it's a pity? We might tell one another the\ntruth in a pleasant way.'\n\n'I agree with you. But then we must be civilised indeed. How do you\nthink of London, Miss Warricombe? Which of its aspects most impresses\nyou?'\n\nSidwell answered rather indefinitely, and ended by mentioning that in\n_Villette_, which she had just re-read, Charlotte Bronte makes a\ncontrast between the City and the West End, and greatly prefers the\nformer.\n\n'Do you agree with her, Mr. Peak?'\n\n'No, I can't. One understands the mood in which she wrote that; but a\nlittle more experience would have led her to see the contrast in a\ndifferent light. That term, the West End, includes much that is\ndespicable, but it means also the best results of civilisation. The\nCity is hateful to me, and for a reason which I only understood after\nmany an hour of depression in walking about its streets. It represents\nthe ascendency of the average man.'\n\nSidwell waited for fuller explanation.\n\n'A liberal mind,' Peak continued, 'is revolted by the triumphal\nprocession that roars perpetually through the City highways. With\nmyriad voices the City bellows its brutal scorn of everything but\nmaterial advantage. There every humanising influence is contemptuously\ndisregarded. I know, of course, that the trader may have his quiet\nhome, where art and science and humanity are the first considerations;\nbut the _mass_ of traders, corporate and victorious, crush all such\nthings beneath their heels. Take your stand (or try to do so) anywhere\nnear the Exchange; the hustling and jolting to which you are exposed\nrepresents the very spirit of the life about you. Whatever is gentle\nand kindly and meditative must here go to the wall--trampled,\nspattered, ridiculed. Here the average man has it all his own way--a\ngross utilitarian power.'\n\n'Yes, I can see that,' Sidwell replied, thoughtfully. 'And perhaps it\nalso represents the triumphant forces of our time.'\n\nHe looked keenly at her, with a smile of delight.\n\n'That also! The power which centres in the world's\nmoney-markets--plutocracy.'\n\nIn conversing with Sidwell, he had never before found an opportunity of\nuttering his vehement prejudices. The gentler side of his character had\nsometimes expressed itself, but those impulses which were vastly more\nsignificant lay hidden beneath the dissimulation he consistently\npractised. For the first time he was able to look into Sidwell's face\nwith honest directness, and what he saw there strengthened his\ndetermination to talk on with the same freedom.\n\n'You don't believe, then,' said Sidwell, 'that democracy is the proper\nname for the state into which we are passing?'\n\n'Only if one can understand democracy as the opening of social\nprivileges to free competition amongst men of trade. And social\nprivilege is everything; home politics refer to nothing else.'\n\nFanny, true to the ingenuous principle of her years, put a direct\nquestion:\n\n'Do you approve of real democracy, Mr. Peak?'\n\nHe answered with another question:\n\n'Have you read the \"Life of Phokion\" in Plutarch?'\n\n'No, I'm sorry to say.'\n\n'There's a story about him which I have enjoyed since I was your age.\nPhokion was once delivering a public speech, and at a certain point the\nmajority of his hearers broke into applause; whereupon he turned to\ncertain of his friends who stood near and asked, \"What have I said\namiss?\"'\n\nFanny laughed.\n\n'Then you despise public opinion?'\n\n'With heart and soul!'\n\nIt was to Sidwell that he directed the reply. Though overcome by the\njoy of such an utterance, he felt that, considering the opinions and\nposition of Buckland Warricombe, he was perhaps guilty of ill manners.\nBut Sidwell manifested no disapproval.\n\n'Did you know that story?' Fanny asked of her.\n\n'It's quite new to me.'\n\n'Then I'm sure you'll read the \"Life of Phokion\" as soon as possible.\nHe will just Suit you, Sidwell.'\n\nPeak heard this with a shock of surprise which thrilled in him\ndeliciously. He had the strongest desire to look again at Sidwell but\nrefrained. As no one spoke, he turned to Bertha Lilywhite and put a\ncommonplace question.\n\nA servant entered with the tea-tray, and placed it on a small table\nnear Fanny. Godwin looked at the younger girl; it seemed to him that\nthere was an excess of colour in her cheeks. Had a glance from Sidwell\nrebuked her? With his usual rapidity of observation and inference he\nmade much of this trifle.\n\nContrary to what he expected, Sidwell's next remark was in a tone of\ncheerfulness, almost of gaiety.\n\n'One advantage of our stay in London will be that home will seem more\ndelightful than ever when we return.'\n\n'I suppose you won't be back till next summer?'\n\n'I am afraid not.'\n\n'Shall you be living here then?' Fanny inquired.\n\n'It's very doubtful.'\n\nHe wished to answer with a decided negative, but his tongue refused.\nSidwell was regarding him with calm but earnest eyes, and he knew,\nwithout caring to reflect, that his latest projects were crumbling.\n\n'Have you been to see our friends at Budleigh Salterton yet?' she asked.\n\n'Not yet. I hope to in a few days.'\n\nPursuing the subject, he was able to examine her face as she spoke of\nMr. Moorhouse. His conjecture was assuredly baseless.\n\nFanny and Bertha began to talk together of domestic affairs, and\npresently, when tea-cups were laid aside, the two girls went to another\npart of the room; then they withdrew altogether. Peak was monologising\non English art as represented at the Academy, but finding himself alone\nwith Sidwell (it had never before happened) he became silent. Ought he\nto take his leave? He must already have been sitting here more than\nhalf-an-hour. But the temptation of _teae-a-teae_ was irresistible.\n\n'You had a visit from Mr. Chilvers the other day?' he remarked,\nabruptly.\n\n'Yes; did he call to see you?'\n\nHer tone gave evidence that she would not have introduced this topic.\n\n'No; I heard from Mrs. Lilywhite. He had been to the vicarage. Has he\nchanged much since he was at Whitelaw?'\n\n'So many years must make a difference at that time of life,' Sidwell\nanswered, smiling.\n\n'But does he show the same peculiarities of manner?'\n\nHe tried to put the question without insistency, in a tone quite\ncompatible with friendliness. Her answer, given with a look of\namusement, satisfied him that there was no fear of her taking Mr\nChilvers too seriously.\n\n'Yes. I think he speaks in much the same way.'\n\n'Have you read any of his publications?'\n\n'One or two. We have his lecture on _Altruism_.'\n\n'I happen to know it. There are good things in it, I think. But I\ndislike his modern interpretation of old principles.'\n\n'You think it dangerous?'\n\nHe no longer regarded her frankly, and in the consciousness of her look\nupon him he knit his brows.\n\n'I think it both dangerous and offensive. Not a few clergymen nowadays,\nwho imagine themselves free from the letter and wholly devoted to\nspirit, are doing their best in the cause of materialism. They\nsurrender the very points at issue between religion and worldliness.\nThey are so blinded by a vague humanitarian impulse as to make the New\nTestament an oracle of popular Radicalism.'\n\nSidwell looked up.\n\n'I never quite understood, Mr. Peak, how you regard Radicalism. You\nthink it opposed to all true progress?'\n\n'Utterly, as concerns any reasonable limit of time.'\n\n'Buckland, as you know, maintains that spiritual progress is only\npossible by this way.'\n\n'I can't venture to contradict him,' said Godwin; 'for it may be that\nadvance is destined only to come after long retrogression and anarchy.\nPerhaps the way _does_ lie through such miseries. But we can't foresee\nthat with certainty, and those of us who hate the present tendency of\nthings must needs assert their hatred as strongly as possible, seeing\nthat we _may_ have a more hopeful part to play than seems likely.'\n\n'I like that view,' replied Sidwell, in an undertone.\n\n'My belief,' pursued Godwin, with an earnestness very agreeable to\nhimself, for he had reached the subject on which he could speak\nhonestly, 'is that an instructed man can only hold views such as your\nbrother's--hopeful views of the immediate future--if he has never been\nbrought into close contact with the lower classes. Buckland doesn't\nknow the people for whom he pleads.'\n\n'You think them so degraded?'\n\n'It is impossible, without seeming inhumanly scornful, to give a just\naccount of their ignorance and baseness. The two things, speaking\ngenerally, go together. Of the ignorant, there are very few indeed who\ncan think purely or aspiringly. You, of course, object the teaching of\nChristianity; but the lowly and the humble of whom it speaks scarcely\nexist, scarcely can exist, in our day and country. A ludicrous pretence\nof education is banishing every form of native simplicity. In the large\ntowns, the populace sink deeper and deeper into a vicious vulgarity,\nand every rural district is being affected by the spread of contagion.\nTo flatter the proletariat is to fight against all the good that still\ncharacterises educated England--against reverence for the beautiful,\nagainst magnanimity, against enthusiasm of mind, heart, and soul.'\n\nHe quivered with vehemence of feeling, and the flush which rose to his\nhearer's cheek, the swimming brightness of her eye, proved that a\nstrong sympathy stirred within her.\n\n'I know nothing of the uneducated in towns,' she said, 'but the little\nI have seen of them in country places certainly supports your opinion.\nI could point to two or three families who have suffered distinct\ndegradation owing to what most people call an improvement in their\ncircumstances. Father often speaks of such instances, comparing the\nstate of things now with what he can remember.'\n\n'My own experience,' pursued Godwin, 'has been among the lower classes\nin London. I don't mean the very poorest, of whom one hears so much\nnowadays; I never went among them because I had no power of helping\nthem, and the sight of their vileness would only have moved me to\nunjust hatred. But the people who earn enough for their needs, and\nwhose spiritual guide is the Sunday newspaper--I know them, because for\na long time I was obliged to lodge in their houses. Only a consuming\nfire could purify the places where they dwell. Don't misunderstand me;\nI am not charging them with what are commonly held vices and crimes,\nbut with the consistent love of everything that is ignoble, with utter\ndeadness to generous impulse, with the fatal habit of low mockery. And\n_these_ are the people who really direct the democratic movement. They\nset the tone in politics; they are debasing art and literature; even\nthe homes of wealthy people begin to show the effects of their\ninfluence. One hears men and women of gentle birth using phrases which\noriginate with shopboys; one sees them reading print which is addressed\nto the coarsest million. They crowd to entertainments which are\ndeliberately adapted to the lowest order of mind. When commercial\ninterest is supreme, how can the tastes of the majority fail to lead\nand control?'\n\nThough he spoke from the depths of his conviction, and was so moved\nthat his voice rose and fell in tones such as a drawing-room seldom\nhears, he yet kept anxious watch upon Sidwell's countenance. That hint\nafforded him by Fanny was invaluable; it had enabled him to appeal to\nSidwell's nature by the ardent expression of what was sincerest in his\nown. She too, he at length understood, had the aristocratic\ntemperament. This explained her to him, supplied the key of doubts and\ndifficulties which had troubled him in her presence. It justified,\nmoreover, the feelings with which she had inspired him--feelings which\nthis hour of intimate converse had exalted to passion. His heart\nthrilled with hope. Where sympathies so profound existed, what did it\nmatter that there was variance on a few points between his intellect\nand hers? He felt the power to win her, and to defy every passing\nhumiliation that lay in his course.\n\nSidwell raised her eyes with a look which signified that she was\nshaping a question diffidently.\n\n'Have you always thought so hopelessly of our times?'\n\n'Oh, I had my stage of optimism,' he answered, smiling. 'Though I never\nput faith in the masses, I once believed that the conversion of the\neducated to a purely human religion would set things moving in the\nright way. It was ignorance of the world.'\n\nHe paused a moment, then added:\n\n'In youth one marvels that men remain at so low a stage of\ncivilisation. Later in life, one is astonished that they have advanced\nso far.'\n\nSidwell met his look with appreciative intelligence and murmured:\n\n'In spite of myself, I believe that expresses a truth.'\n\nPeak was about to reply, when Fanny and her friend reappeared. Bertha\napproached for the purpose of taking leave, and for a minute or two\nSidwell talked with her. The young girls withdrew again together.\n\nBy the clock on the mantelpiece it was nearly six. Godwin did not\nresume his seat, though Sidwell had done so. He looked towards the\nwindow, and was all but lost in abstraction, when the soft voice again\naddressed him:\n\n'But you have not chosen your life's work without some hope of doing\ngood?'\n\n'Do you think,' he asked, gently, 'that I shall be out of place in the\nChristian Church?'\n\n'No--no, I certainly don't think that. But will you tell me what you\nhave set before yourself?'\n\nHe drew nearer and leaned upon the back of a chair.\n\n'I hope for what I shall perhaps never attain. Whatever my first steps\nmay be--I am not independent; I must take the work that offers--it is\nmy ambition to become the teacher of some rural parish which is still\nunpolluted by the influences of which we have been speaking--or, at all\nevents, is still capable of being rescued. For work in crowded centres,\nI am altogether unfit; my prejudices are too strong; I should do far\nmore harm than good. But among a few simple people I think my efforts\nmightn't be useless. I can't pretend to care for anything but\nindividuals. The few whom I know and love are of more importance to me\nthan all the blind multitude rushing to destruction. I hate the word\n_majority_; it is the few, the very few, that have always kept alive\nwhatever of effectual good we see in the human race. There are\nindividuals who outweigh, in every kind of value, generations of\nordinary people. To some remote little community I hope to give the\nbest energies of my life. My teaching will avoid doctrine and\ncontroversy. I shall take the spirit of the Gospels, and labour to make\nit a practical guide. No doubt you find inconsistencies in me; but\nremember that I shall not declare myself to those I instruct as I have\ndone to you. I have been laying stress on my antipathies. In the future\nit will be a duty and a pleasure to forget these and foster my\nsympathies, which also are strong when opportunity is given them.'\n\nSidwell listened, her face bent downwards but not hidden from the\nspeaker.\n\n'My nature is intolerant,' he went on, 'and I am easily roused to an\nantagonism which destroys my peace. It is only by living apart, amid\nfriendly circumstances, that I can cultivate the qualities useful to\nmyself and others. The sense that my life was being wasted determined\nme a year ago to escape the world's uproar and prepare myself in\nquietness for this task. The resolve was taken here, in your house.'\n\n'Are you quite sure,' asked Sidwell, 'that such simple duties and\nsatisfactions'--\n\nThe sentence remained incomplete, or rather was finished in the timid\nglance she gave him.\n\n'Such a life wouldn't be possible to me,' he replied, with unsteady\nvoice, 'if I were condemned to intellectual solitude. But I have dared\nto hope that I shall not always be alone.'\n\nA parched throat would have stayed his utterance, even if words had\noffered themselves. But sudden confusion beset his mind--a sense of\nhaving been guilty of monstrous presumption--a panic which threw\ndarkness about him and made him grasp the chair convulsively. When he\nrecovered himself and looked at Sidwell there was a faint smile on her\nlips, inexpressibly gentle.\n\n'That's the rough outline of my projects,' he said, in his ordinary\nvoice, moving a few steps away. 'You see that I count much on fortune;\nat the best, it may be years before I can get my country living.'\n\nWith a laugh, he came towards her and offered his hand for good-bye.\nSidwell rose.\n\n'You have interested me very much. Whatever assistance it may be in my\nfather's power to offer you, I am sure you may count upon.'\n\n'I am already much indebted to Mr. Warricombe's kindness.'\n\nThey shook hands without further speech, and Peak went his way.\n\nFor an hour or two he was powerless to collect his thoughts. All he had\nsaid repeated itself again and again, mixed up with turbid comments,\nwith deadly fears and frantic bursts of confidence, with tumult of\npassion and merciless logic of self-criticism. Did Sidwell understand\nthat sentence: 'I have dared to hope that I shall not always be alone'?\nWas it not possible that she might interpret it as referring to some\nunknown woman whom he loved? If not, if his voice and features had\nbetrayed him, what could her behaviour mean, except distinct\nencouragement? 'You have interested me very much.' But could she have\nused such words if his meaning had been plain to her? Far more likely\nthat her frank kindness came of misconception. She imagined him the\nlover of some girl of his own 'station'--a toiling governess, or some\nsuch person; it could not enter into her mind that he 'dared' so\nrecklessly as the truth implied.\n\nBut the glow of sympathy with which she heard his immeasurable scorn:\nthere was the spirit that defies artificial distances. Why had he not\nbeen bolder? At this rate he must spend a lifetime in preparing for the\ndecisive moment. When would another such occasion offer itself?\n\nWomen are won by audacity; the poets have repeated it from age to age,\nand some truth there must be in the saying. Suspicion of self-interest\ncould not but attach to him; that was inherent in the circumstances. He\nmust rely upon the sincerity of his passion, which indeed was beginning\nto rack and rend him. A woman is sensitive to that, especially a woman\nof Sidwell's refinement. In matters of the intellect she may be misled,\nbut she cannot mistake quivering ardour for design simulating love. If\nit were impossible to see her again in private before she left Exeter,\nthen he must write to her. Half a year of complete uncertainty, and of\ncounterfeiting face to face with Bruno Chilvers, would overtax his\nresolution.\n\nThe evening went by he knew not how. Long after nightfall he was\nreturning from an aimless ramble by way of the Old Tiverton Road. At\nleast he would pass the house, and soothe or inflame his emotions by\nresting for a moment thus near to Sidwell.\n\nWhat? He had believed himself incapable of erotic madness? And he\npressed his forehead against the stones of the wall to relieve his sick\ndizziness.\n\nIt was Sidwell or death. Into what a void of hideous futility would his\nlife be cast, if this desire proved vain, and he were left to combat\nalone with the memory of his dishonour! With Sidwell the reproach could\nbe outlived. She would understand him, pardon him--and thereafter a\nglorified existence, rivalling that of whosoever has been most exultant\namong the sons of men!\n\n\n\n\nPart IV\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nEarwaker's struggle with the editor-in-chief of _The Weekly Post_ and\nthe journalist Kenyon came to its natural close about a month after\nGodwin Peak's disappearance. Only a vein of obstinacy in his character\nhad kept him so long in a position he knew to be untenable. From the\nfirst his sympathy with Mr. Runcorn's politics had been doubtful, and\nexperience of the working of a Sunday newspaper, which appealed to the\nignobly restive, could not encourage his adhesion to this form of\nRadicalism. He anticipated dismissal by retirement, and Kenyon, a man\nof coarsely vigorous fibre, at once stepped into his place.\n\nNow that he had leisure to review the conflict, Earwaker understood\nthat circumstances had but hastened his transition from a moderate\nardour in the parliamentary cause of the people, to a regretful\nneutrality regarding all political movements. Birth allied him with the\nproletarian class, and his sentiment in favour of democracy was\nunendangered by the disillusions which must come upon every\nintellectual man brought into close contact with public affairs. The\ncourse of an education essentially aristocratic (Greek and Latin can\nhave no other tendency so long as they are the privilege of the few)\nhad not affected his natural bent, nor was he the man to be driven into\nreaction because of obstacles to his faith inseparable from human\nweakness. He had learnt that the emancipation of the poor and untaught\nmust proceed more slowly than he once hoped--that was all. Restored to\ngenerous calm, he could admit that such men as Runcorn and Kenyon--the\none with his polyarchic commercialism, the other with his demagogic\nviolence--had possibly a useful part to play at the present stage of\nthings. He, however, could have no place in that camp. Too indiscreetly\nhe had hoisted his standard of idealism, and by stubborn resistance of\ninsuperable forces he had merely brought forward the least satisfactory\nelements of his own character. 'Hold on!' cried Malkin. 'Fight the\ngrovellers to the end!' But Earwaker had begun to see himself in a\nlight of ridicule. There was just time to save his self-respect.\n\nHe was in no concern for his daily bread. With narrower resources in\nthe world of print, he might have been compelled, like many another\njournalist, to swallow his objections and write as Runcorn dictated;\nfor the humble folks at home could not starve to allow him the luxury\nof conscientiousness, whatever he might have been disposed to do on his\nown account. Happily, his pen had a scope beyond politics, and by\nworking steadily for reviews, with which he was already connected, he\nwould be able to keep his finances in reasonable order until,\nperchance, some hopeful appointment offered itself. In a mood of much\ncheerfulness he turned for ever from party uproar, and focused his mind\nupon those interests of humanity which so rarely coincide with the aims\nof any league among men.\n\nHalf a year went by, and at length he granted himself a short holiday,\nthe first in a twelvemonth. It took the form of a voyage to Marseilles,\nand thence of a leisurely ramble up the Rhone. Before returning, he\nspent a day or two in Paris, for the most part beneath cafe' awnings,\nor on garden seats--an indulgence of contented laziness.\n\nOn the day of his departure, he climbed the towers of Notre Dame, and\nlingered for half-an-hour in pleasant solitude among the stone\nmonsters. His reverie was broken by an English voice, loud and animated:\n\n'Come and look at this old demon of a bird; he has always been a\nfavourite of mine.--Sure you're not tired, Miss Bella? When you want to\nrest, Miss Lily, mind you say so at once. What a day! What a sky!--When\nI was last up here I had my hat blown away. I watched it as far as\nMontmartre. A fact! Never knew such a wind in my life--unless it was\nthat tornado I told you about--Hollo! By the powers, if that isn't\nEarwaker! Confound you, old fellow! How the deuce do you do? What a\nglorious meeting! Hadn't the least idea where you were!--Let me have\nthe pleasure of introducing you to Mrs. Jacox--and to Miss Jacox--and\nto Miss Lily. They all know you thoroughly well. Now who would have\nthought of our meeting up here! Glorious!'\n\nIt was with some curiosity that Earwaker regarded the companions of his\nfriend Malkin--whose proximity was the last thing he could have\nimagined, as only a few weeks ago he had heard of the restless fellow's\ndeparting, on business unknown, for Boston, US. Mrs. Jacox, the widow\nwhose wrongs had made such an impression on Malkin, announced herself,\nin a thin, mealy face and rag-doll figure, as not less than forty,\nthough her irresponsible look made it evident that years profited her\nnothing, and suggested an explanation of the success with which she had\nbeen victimised. She was stylishly dressed, and had the air of enjoying\nan unusual treat. Her children were of more promising type, though\nEarwaker would hardly have supposed them so old as he knew them to be.\nBella, just beyond her fourteenth year, had an intelligent prettiness,\nbut was excessively shy; in giving her hand to the stranger she flushed\nover face and neck, and her bosom palpitated visibly. Her sister, two\nyears younger, was a mere child, rather self-conscious, but of laughing\ntemper. Their toilet suited ill with that of their mother; its\nplainness and negligence might have passed muster in London, but here,\nunder the lucent sky, it seemed a wrong to their budding maidenhood.\n\n'Mrs. Jacox is on the point of returning to England,' Malkin explained.\n'I happened to meet her, by chance--I'm always meeting my friends by\nchance; you, for instance, Earwaker. She is so good as to allow me to\nguide her and the young ladies to a few of the sights of Paris.'\n\n'O Mr. Malkin!' exclaimed the widow, with a stress on the exclamation\npeculiar to herself--two notes of deprecating falsetto. 'How can you\nsay it is good of me, when I'm sure there are no words for your\nkindness to us all! If only you knew our debt to your friend, Mr\nEarwaker! To our dying day we must all remember it. It is entirely\nthrough Mr. Malkin that we are able to leave that most disagreeable\nRouen--a place I shall never cease to think of with horror. O Mr\nEarwaker! you have only to think of that wretched railway station,\nstuck between two black tunnels! O Mr. Malkin!'\n\n'What are you doing?' Malkin inquired of the journalist. 'How long\nshall you be here? Why haven't I heard from you?'\n\n'I go to London to-night.'\n\n'And we to-morrow. On Friday I'll look you up. Stay, can't you dine\nwith me this evening? Anywhere you like. These ladies will be glad to\nbe rid of me, and to dine in peace at their hotel.'\n\n'O Mr. Malkin!' piped the widow, 'you know how very far that is from\nthe truth. But we shall be very glad indeed to know that you are\nenjoying yourself with Mr. Earwaker.'\n\nThe friends made an appointment to meet near the Madeleine, and\nEarwaker hastened to escape the sound of Mrs. Jacox's voice.\n\nPunctual at the rendezvous, Malkin talked with his wonted effusiveness\nas he led towards the Cafe Anglais.\n\n'I've managed it, my boy! The most complete success! I had to run over\nto Boston to get hold of a scoundrelly relative of that poor woman. You\nshould have seen how I came over him--partly dignified sternness,\npartly justifiable cajolery. The affair only wanted some one to take it\nup in earnest. I have secured her about a couple of hundred a\nyear--withheld on the most paltry and transparent pretences. They're\ngoing to live at Wrotham, in Kent, where Mrs Jacox has friends. I never\nthought myself so much of a man of business. Of course old Haliburton,\nthe lawyer, had a hand in it, but without my personal energy it would\nhave taken him a year longer. What do you think of the girls? How do\nyou like Bella?'\n\n'A pretty child.'\n\n'Child? Well, yes, yes--immature of course; but I'm rather in the habit\nof thinking of her as a young lady. In three years she'll be seventeen,\nyou know. Of course you couldn't form a judgment of her character.\nShe's quite remarkably mature for her age; and, what delights me most\nof all, a sturdy Radical! She takes the most intelligent interest in\nall political and social movements, I assure you! There's a great deal\nof democratic fire in her.'\n\n'You're sure it isn't reflected from your own fervour?'\n\n'Not a bit of it! You should have seen her excitement when we were at\nthe Bastille Column yesterday. She'll make a splendid woman, I assure\nyou. Lily's very interesting, too--profoundly interesting. But then she\nis certainly very young, so I can't feel so sure of her on the great\nquestions. She hasn't her sister's earnestness, I fancy.'\n\nIn the after-glow of dinner, Malkin became still more confidential.\n\n'You remember what I said to you long since? My mind is made\nup--practically made up. I shall devote myself to Bella's education, in\nthe hope--you understand me? Impossible to have found a girl who suited\nbetter with my aspirations. She has known the hardships of poverty,\npoor thing, and that will keep her for ever in sympathy with the\ndowntrodden classes. She has a splendid intelligence, and it shall be\ncultivated to the utmost.'\n\n'One word,' said Earwaker, soberly. 'We have heard before of men who\nwaited for girls to grow up. Be cautious, my dear fellow, both on your\nown account and hers.'\n\n'My dear Earwaker! Don't imagine for a moment that I take it for\ngranted she will get to be fond of me. My attitude is one of the most\nabsolute discretion. You must have observed how I behaved to them\nall--scrupulous courtesy, I trust; no more familiarity than any friend\nmight be permitted. I should never dream of addressing the girls\nwithout ceremonious prefix--never! I talk of Bella's education, but be\nassured that I regard my own as a matter of quite as much importance. I\nmean, that I shall strive incessantly to make myself worthy of her. No\nlaxity! For these next three years I shall live as becomes a man who\nhas his eyes constantly on a high ideal--the pure and beautiful girl\nwhom he humbly hopes to win for a wife.'\n\nThe listener was moved. He raised his wine-glass to conceal the smile\nwhich might have been misunderstood. In his heart he felt more\nadmiration than had yet mingled with his liking for this strange fellow.\n\n'And Mrs. Jacox herself,' pursued Malkin; 'she has her weaknesses, as\nwe all have. I don't think her a very strong-minded woman, to tell the\ntruth. But there's a great deal of goodness in her. If there's one\nthing I desire in people, it is the virtue of gratitude, and Mrs Jacox\nis grateful almost to excess for the paltry exertions I have made on\nher behalf. You know that kind of thing costs me nothing; you know I\nlike running about and getting things done. But the poor woman imagines\nthat I have laid her under an eternal obligation. Of course I shall\nshow her in time that it was nothing at all; that she might have done\njust as much for herself if she had known how to go about it.'\n\nEarwaker was musing, a wrinkle of uneasiness at the corner of his eye.\n\n'She isn't the kind of woman, you know, one can regard as a mother. But\nwe are the best possible friends. She _may_, perhaps, think of me as a\npossible son-in-law. Poor thing; I hope she does. Perhaps it will help\nto put her mind at rest about the girls.'\n\n'Then shall you often be down at Wrotham?' inquired the journalist,\nabstractedly.\n\n'Oh, not often--that is to say, only once a month or so, just to look\nin. I wanted to ask you: do you think I might venture to begin a\ncorrespondence with Bella?'\n\n'M--m--m! I can't say.'\n\n'It would be so valuable, you know. I could suggest books for her\nreading; I could help her in her study of politics, and so on.'\n\n'Well, think about it. But be cautious, I beg of you. Now I must be\noff. Only just time enough to get my traps to the station.'\n\n'I'll come with you. Gare du Nord? Oh, plenty of time, plenty of time!\nNothing so abominable as waiting for trains. I make a point of never\ngetting to the station more than three minutes before time. Astonishing\nwhat one can do in three minutes! I want to tell you about an adventure\nI had in Boston. Met a fellow so devilish like Peak that I _couldn't_\nbelieve it wasn't he himself. I spoke to him, but he swore that he knew\nnot the man. Never saw such a likeness!'\n\n'Curious. It may have been Peak.'\n\n'By all that's suspicious, I can't help thinking the same! He had an\nEnglish accent, too.'\n\n'Queer business, this of Peak's. I hope I may live to hear the end of\nthe story.'\n\nThey left the restaurant, and in a few hours Earwaker was again on\nEnglish soil.\n\nAt Staple Inn a pile of letters awaited him, among them a note from\nChristian Moxey, asking for an appointment as soon as possible after\nthe journalist's return. Earwaker at once sent an invitation, and on\nthe next evening Moxey came. An intimacy had grown up between the two,\nsince the mysterious retreat of their common friend. Christian was at\nfirst lost without the companionship of Godwin Peak; he forsook his\nstudies, and fell into a state of complete idleness which naturally\nfostered his tendency to find solace in the decanter. With Earwaker, he\ncould not talk as unreservedly as with Peak, but on the other hand\nthere was a tonic influence in the journalist's personality which he\nrecognised as beneficial. Earwaker was steadily making his way in the\nworld, lived a life of dignified independence. What was the secret of\nthese strong, calm natures? Might it not be learnt by studious\ninspection?\n\n'How well you look!' Christian exclaimed, on entering. 'We enjoyed your\nProvencal letter enormously. That's a ramble I have always meant to do.\nNext year perhaps.'\n\n'Why not this? Haven't you got into a dangerous habit of postponement?'\n\n'Yes, I'm afraid I have. But, by-the-bye, no news of Peak, I suppose?'\n\nEarwaker related the story he had heard from Malkin, adding:\n\n'You must remember that they met only once in London; Malkin might very\nwell mistake another man for Peak.'\n\n'Yes,' replied the other musingly. 'Yet it isn't impossible that Peak\nhas gone over there. If so, what on earth can he be up to? Why _should_\nhe hide from his friends?'\n\n'_Cherchez la femme_,' said the journalist, with a smile. 'I can devise\nno other explanation.'\n\n'But I can't see that it would be an explanation at all. Grant\neven--something unavowable, you know--are we Puritans? How could it\nharm him, at all events, to let us know his whereabouts? No such\nmystery ever came into my experience. It is too bad of Peak; it's\nconfoundedly unkind.'\n\n'Suppose he has found it necessary to assume a character wholly\nfictitious--or, let us say, quite inconsistent with his life and\nopinions as known to us?'\n\nThis was a fruitful suggestion, long in Earwaker's mind, but not\nhitherto communicated. Christian did not at once grasp its significance.\n\n'How could that be necessary? Peak is no swindler. You don't imply that\nhe is engaged in some fraud?'\n\n'Not in the ordinary sense, decidedly. But picture some girl or woman\nof conventional opinions and surroundings. What if he resolved to win\nsuch a wife, at the expense of disguising his true self?'\n\n'But what an extraordinary idea!' cried Moxey. 'Why Peak is all but a\nwoman-hater!'\n\nThe journalist uttered croaking laughter.\n\n'Have I totally misunderstood him?' asked Christian, confused and\nabashed.\n\n'I think it not impossible.'\n\n'You amaze me!--But no, no; you are wrong, Earwaker. Wrong in your\nsuggestion, I mean. Peak could never sink to that. He is too\nuncompromising'----\n\n'Well, it will be explained some day, I suppose.'\n\nAnd with a shrug of impatience, the journalist turned to another\nsubject. He, too, regretted his old friend's disappearance, and in a\nmeasure resented it. Godwin Peak was not a man to slip out of one's\nlife and leave no appreciable vacancy. Neither of these men admired\nhim, in the true sense of the word, yet had his voice sounded at the\ndoor both would have sprung up with eager welcome. He was a force--and\nhow many such beings does one encounter in a lifetime?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nIn different ways, Christian and Marcella Moxey had both been lonely\nsince their childhood. As a schoolgirl, Marcella seemed to her\ncompanions conceited and repellent; only as the result of reflection in\nafter years did Sylvia Moorhouse express so favourable an opinion of\nher. In all things she affected singularity; especially it was her\ndelight to utter democratic and revolutionary sentiments among hearers\nwho, belonging to a rigidly conservative order, held such opinions\nimpious. Arrived at womanhood, she affected scorn of the beliefs and\nhabits cherished by her own sex, and shrank from association with the\nother. Godwin Peak was the first man with whom she conversed in the\ntone of friendship, and it took a year or more before that point was\nreached. As her intimacy with him established itself, she was observed\nto undergo changes which seemed very significant in the eyes of her few\nacquaintances. Disregard of costume had been one of her\ncharacteristics, but now she moved gradually towards the opposite\nextreme, till her dresses were occasionally more noticeable for\nrichness than for good taste.\n\nChristian, for kindred reasons, was equally debarred from the pleasures\nand profits of society. At school, his teachers considered him clever,\nhis fellows for the most part looked down upon him as a sentimental\nweakling. The death of his parents, when he was still a lad, left him\nto the indifferent care of a guardian nothing akin to him. He began\nlife in an uncongenial position, and had not courage to oppose the\ndrift of circumstances. The romantic attachment which absorbed his best\nyears naturally had a debilitating effect, for love was never yet a\nsupporter of the strenuous virtues, save when it has survived fruition\nand been blessed by reason. In most men a fit of amorous mooning works\nits own cure; energetic rebound is soon inevitable. But Christian was\nso constituted that a decade of years could not exhaust his capacity\nfor sentimental languishment. He made it a point of honour to seek no\nfemale companionship which could imperil his faith. Unfortunately, this\navoidance of the society which would soon have made him a happy\nrenegade, was but too easy. Marcella and he practically encouraged each\nother in a life of isolation, though to both of them such an existence\nwas anything but congenial. Their difficulties were of the same nature\nas those which had always beset Godwin Peak; they had no relatives with\nwhom they cared to associate, and none of the domestic friends who, in\nthe progress of time, establish and extend a sphere of genuine intimacy.\n\nMost people who are capable of independent thought rapidly outgrow the\nstage when compromise is abhorred; they accept, at first reluctantly,\nbut ere long with satisfaction, that code of polite intercourse which,\nas Steele says, is 'an expedient to make fools and wise men equal'. It\nwas Marcella's ill-fate that she could neither learn tolerance nor\npersuade herself to affect it. The emancipated woman has fewer\nopportunities of relieving her mind than a man in corresponding\nposition; if her temper be aggressive she must renounce general\nsociety, and, if not content to live alone, ally herself with some\ngroup of declared militants. By correspondence, or otherwise, Marcella\nmight have brought herself into connection with women of a sympathetic\ntype, but this effort she had never made. And chiefly because of her\nacquaintance with Godwin Peak. In him she concentrated her interests;\nhe was the man to whom her heart went forth with every kind of fervour.\nSo long as there remained a hope of moving him to reciprocal feeling\nshe did not care to go in search of female companions. Year after year\nshe sustained herself in solitude by this faint hope. She had lost\nsight of the two or three schoolfellows who, though not so zealous as\nherself, would have welcomed her as an interesting acquaintance; and\nthe only woman who assiduously sought her was Mrs. Morton, the wife of\none of Christian's friends, a good-natured but silly person bent on\nmaking known that she followed the 'higher law'.\n\nGodwin's disappearance sank her in profound melancholy. Through the\nblack weeks of January and February she scarcely left the house, and on\nthe plea of illness refused to see any one but her brother. Between\nChristian and her there was no avowed confidence, but each knew the\nother's secret; their mutual affection never spoke itself in words, yet\nnone the less it was indispensable to their lives. Deprived of his\nsister's company, Christian must have yielded to the vice which had\nalready too strong a hold upon him, and have become a maudlin drunkard.\nLeft to herself, Marcella had but slender support against a grim\ntemptation already beckoning her in nights of sleeplessness. Of the\ntwo, her nature was the more tragic. Circumstances aiding, Christian\nmight still forget his melancholy, abandon the whisky bottle, and pass\na lifetime of amiable uxoriousness, varied with scientific enthusiasm.\nBut for Marcella, frustrate in the desire with which every impulse of\nher being had identified itself, what future could be imagined?\n\nWhen a day or two of sunlight (the rays through a semi-opaque\natmosphere which London has to accept with gratitude) had announced\nthat the seven-months' winter was overcome, and when the newspapers\nbegan to speak, after their fashion, of pictures awaiting scrutiny,\nChristian exerted himself to rouse his sister from her growing\nindolence. He succeeded in taking her to the Academy. Among the works\nof sculpture, set apart for the indifference of the public, was a\nfemale head, catalogued as 'A Nihilist'--in itself interesting, and\nspecially so to Marcella, because it was executed by an artist whose\nname she recognised as that of a schoolmate, Agatha Walworth. She spoke\nof the circumstance to Christian, and added:\n\n'I should like to have that. Let us go and see the price.'\n\nThe work was already sold. Christian, happy that his sister could be\naroused to this interest, suggested that a cast might be obtainable.\n\n'Write to Miss Walworth,' he urged. 'Bring yourself to her\nrecollection.--I should think she must be the right kind of woman.'\n\nThough at the time she shook her head, Marcella was presently tempted\nto address a letter to the artist, who responded with friendly\ninvitation. In this way a new house was opened to her; but,\nsimultaneously, one more illusion was destroyed. Knowing little of\nlife, and much of literature, she pictured Miss Walworth as inhabiting\na delightful Bohemian world, where the rules of conventionalism had no\nexistence, and everything was judged by the brain-standard. Modern\nFrench biographies supplied all her ideas of studio society. She\nprepared herself for the first visit with a joyous tremor, wondering\nwhether she would be deemed worthy to associate with the men and women\nwho lived for art. The reality was a shock. In a large house at\nChiswick she found a gathering of most respectable English people,\nchatting over the regulation tea-cup; not one of them inclined to\ndisregard the dictates of Mrs. Grundy in dress, demeanour, or dialogue.\nAgatha Walworth lived with her parents and her sisters like any other\nirreproachable young woman. She had a nice little studio, and worked at\nmodelling with a good deal of aptitude; but of Bohemia she knew nothing\nwhatever, save by hearsay. Her 'Nihilist' was no indication of a\nrebellious spirit; some friend had happened to suggest that a certain\nfemale model, a Russian, would do very well for such a character, and\nthe hint was tolerably well carried out--nothing more. Marcella\nreturned in a mood of contemptuous disappointment. The cast she had\ndesired to have was shortly sent to her as a gift, but she could take\nno pleasure in it.\n\nStill, she saw more of the Walworths and found them not illiberal.\nAgatha was intelligent, and fairly well read in modern authors; no need\nto conceal one's opinions in conversation with her. Marcella happened\nto be spending the evening with these acquaintances whilst her brother\nwas having his chat at Staple Inn; on her return, she mentioned to\nChristian that she had been invited to visit the Walworths in\nDevonshire a few weeks hence.\n\n'Go, by all means,' urged her brother.\n\n'I don't think I shall. They are too respectable.'\n\n'Nonsense! They seem very open-minded; you really can't expect absolute\nunconventionality. Is it desirable? Really is it, now?--Suppose I were\nto marry some day, Marcella; do you think my household would be\nunconventional?'\n\nHis voice shook a little, and he kept his eyes averted. Marcella, to\nwhom her brother's romance was anything but an agreeable subject,--the\nslight acquaintance she had with the modern Laura did not encourage her\nto hope for that lady's widowhood,--gave no heed to the question.\n\n'They are going to have a house at Budleigh Salterton; do you know of\nthe place? Somewhere near the mouth of the Exe. Miss Walworth tells me\nthat one of our old school friends is living there--Sylvia Moorhouse.\nDid I ever mention Sylvia? She had gleams of sense, I remember; but no\ndoubt society has drilled all that out of her.'\n\nChristian sighed.\n\n'Why?' he urged. 'Society is getting more tolerant than you are\ndisposed to think. Very few well-educated people would nowadays object\nto an acquaintance on speculative grounds. Some one--who was it?--was\ntelling me of a recent marriage between the daughter of some well-known\nChurch people and a man who made no secret of his agnosticism; the\nparents acquiescing cheerfully. The one thing still insisted on is\ndecency of behaviour.'\n\nMarcella's eyes flashed.\n\n'How can you say that? You know quite well that most kinds of\nimmorality are far more readily forgiven by people of the world than\nsincere heterodoxy on moral subjects.'\n\n'Well, well, I meant decency from _their_ point of view. And there\nreally must be such restrictions, you know. How very few people are\ncapable of what you call sincere heterodoxy, in morals or religion!\nYour position is unphilosophical; indeed it is. Take the world as you\nfind it, and make friends with kind, worthy people. You have suffered\nfrom a needless isolation. Do accept this opportunity of adding to your\nacquaintances!--Do, Marcella! I shall take it as a great kindness, dear\ngirl.'\n\nHis sister let her head lie back against the chair, her face averted. A\nstranger seated in Christian's place, regarding Marcella whilst her\nfeatures were thus hidden, would have thought it probable that she was\na woman of no little beauty. Her masses of tawny hair, her arms and\nhands, the pose and outline of her figure, certainly suggested a\ncountenance of corresponding charm, and the ornate richness of her\nattire aided such an impression. This thought came to Christian as he\ngazed at her; his eyes, always so gentle, softened to a tender\ncompassion. As the silence continued, he looked uneasily about him;\nwhen at length he spoke, it was as though a matter of trifling moment\nhad occurred to him.\n\n'By-the-bye, I am told that Malkin (Earwaker's friend, you know) saw\nPeak not long ago--in America.'\n\nMarcella did not change her position, but at the sound of Peak's name\nshe stirred, as if with an intention, at once checked, of bending\neagerly forward.\n\n'In America?' she asked, incredulously.\n\n'At Boston. He met him in the street--or thinks he did. There's a\ndoubt. When Malkin spoke to the man, he declared that he was not Peak\nat all--said there was a mistake.'\n\nMarcella moved so as to show her face; endeavouring to express an\nunemotional interest, she looked coldly scornful.\n\n'That ridiculous man can't be depended upon,' she said.\n\nThere had been one meeting between Marcella and Mr. Malkin, with the\nresult that each thoroughly disliked the other--an antipathy which\ncould have been foreseen.\n\n'Well, there's no saying,' replied Christian. 'But of one thing I feel\npretty sure: we have seen the last of Peak. He'll never come back to\nus.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'I can only say that I feel convinced he has broken finally with all\nhis old friends.--We must think no more of him, Marcella.'\n\nHis sister rose slowly, affected to glance at a book, and in a few\nmoments said good-night. For another hour Christian sat by himself in\ngloomy thought.\n\nAt breakfast next morning Marcella announced that she would be from\nhome the whole day; she might return in time for dinner, but it was\nuncertain. Her brother asked no questions, but said that he would lunch\nin town. About ten o'clock a cab was summoned, and Marcella, without\nleave-taking, drove away.\n\nChristian lingered as long as possible over the morning paper, unable\nto determine how he should waste the weary hours that lay before him.\nThere was no reason for his remaining in London through this brief\nseason of summer glow. Means and leisure were his, he could go whither\nhe would. But the effort of decision and departure seemed too much for\nhim. Worst of all, this lassitude (not for the first time) was\naffecting his imagination; he thought with a dull discontent of the\nideal love to which he had bound himself. Could he but escape from it,\nand begin a new life! But he was the slave of his airy obligation; for\nvery shame's sake his ten years' consistency must be that of a lifetime.\n\nThere was but one place away from London to which he felt himself\ndrawn, and that was the one place he might not visit. This morning's\nsunshine carried him back to that day when he had lain in the meadow\nnear Twybridge and talked with Godwin Peak. How distinctly he\nremembered his mood! 'Be practical--don't be led astray after\nideals--concentrate yourself;'--yes, it was he who had given that\nadvice to Peak: and had he but recked his own rede--! Poor little\nJanet! was she married? If so, her husband must be a happy man.\n\nWhy should he not go down to Twybridge? His uncle, undoubtedly still\nliving, must by this time have forgotten the old resentment, perhaps\nwould be glad to see him. In any case he might stroll about the town\nand somehow obtain news of the Moxey family.\n\nWith vague half-purpose he left the house and walked westward. The\nstream of traffic in Edgware Road brought him to a pause; he stood for\nfive minutes in miserable indecision, all but resolving to go on as far\nas Euston and look for the next northward train. But the vice in his\nwill prevailed; automaton-like he turned in another direction, and\npresently came out into Sussex Square. Here was the house to which his\nthoughts had perpetually gone forth ever since that day when Constance\ngave her hand to a thriving City man, and became Mrs. Palmer. At\npresent, he knew, it was inhabited only by domestics: Mr. Palmer,\nrecovering from illness that threatened to be fatal, had gone to\nBournemouth, where Constance of course tended him. But he would walk\npast and look up at the windows.\n\nAll the blinds were down--naturally. Thrice he went by and retraced his\nsteps. Then, still automaton-like, he approached the door, rang the\nbell. The appearance of the servant choked his voice for an instant,\nbut he succeeded in shaping an inquiry after Mr. Palmer's health.\n\n'I'm sorry to say, sir,' was the reply, 'that Mr. Palmer died last\nnight. We received the news only an hour or two ago.'\n\nChristian tottered on his feet and turned so pale that the servant\nregarded him with anxiety. For a minute or two he stared vacantly into\nthe gloomy hall; then, without a word, he turned abruptly and walked\naway.\n\nUnconscious of the intervening distance, he found himself at home, in\nhis library. The parlour-maid was asking him whether he would have\nluncheon. Scarcely understanding the question, he muttered a refusal\nand sat down.\n\nSo, it had come at last. Constance was a widow. In a year or so she\nmight think of marrying again.\n\nHe remained in the library for three or four hours. At first incapable\nof rejoicing, then ashamed to do so, he at length suffered from such a\nthrobbing of the heart that apprehension of illness recalled him to a\nnormal state of mind. The favourite decanter was within reach, and it\ngave him the wonted support. Then at length did heart and brain glow\nwith exulting fervour.\n\nPoor Constance! Noble woman! Most patient of martyrs! The hour of her\nredemption had struck. The fetters had fallen from her tender,\nsuffering body. Of _him_ she could not yet think. He did not wish it.\nThe womanhood must pay its debt to nature before she could gladden in\nthe prospect of a new life. Months must go by before he could approach\nher, or even remind her of his existence. But at last his reward was\nsure.\n\nAnd he had thought of Twybridge, of his cousin Janet! O unworthy lapse!\n\nHe shed tears of tenderness. Dear, noble Constance! It was now nearly\ntwelve years since he first looked upon her face. In those days he\nmingled freely with all the society within his reach. It was not very\nselect, and Constance Markham shone to him like a divinity among\ncreatures of indifferent clay. They said she was coquettish, that she\nplayed at the game of love with every presentable young man--envious\ncalumny! No, she was single-hearted, inexperienced, a lovely and joyous\ngirl of not yet twenty. It is so difficult for such a girl to\nunderstand her own emotions. Her parents persuaded her into wedding\nPalmer. That was all gone into the past, and now his concern--their\nconcern--was only with the blessed future.\n\nAt three o'clock he began to feel a healthy appetite. He sent for a cab\nand drove towards the region of restaurants.\n\nHad he yielded to the impulse which this morning directed him to\nTwybridge, he would have arrived in that town not very long after his\nsister.\n\nFor that was the aim of Marcella's journey. On reaching the station,\nshe dropped a light veil over her face and set forth on foot to\ndiscover the abode of Mrs. Peak. No inhabitant of Twybridge save her\nuncle and his daughters could possibly recognise her, but she shrank\nfrom walking through the streets with exposed countenance. Whether she\nwould succeed in her quest was uncertain. Godwin Peak's mother still\ndwelt here, she knew, for less than a year ago she had asked the\nquestion of Godwin himself; but a woman in humble circumstances might\nnot have a house of her own, and her name was probably unknown save to\na few friends.\n\nHowever, the first natural step was to inquire for a directory. A\nstationer supplied her with one, informing her, with pride, that he\nhimself was the author of it--that this was only the second year of its\nissue, and that its success was 'very encouraging'. Retiring to a quiet\nstreet, Marcella examined her purchase, and came upon 'Peak, Oliver;\nseedsman'--the sole entry of the name. This was probably a relative of\nGodwin's. Without difficulty she found Mr Peak's shop; behind the\ncounter stood Oliver himself, rubbing his hands. Was there indeed a\nfamily likeness between this fresh-looking young shopkeeper and the\nstern, ambitious, intellectual man whose lineaments were ever before\nher mind? Though with fear and repulsion, Marcella was constrained to\nrecognise something in the commonplace visage. With an uncertain voice,\nshe made known her business.\n\n'I wish to find Mrs. Peak--a widow--an elderly lady'----\n\n'Oh yes, madam! My mother, no doubt. She lives with her sister, Miss\nCadman--the milliner's shop in the first street to the left. Let me\npoint it out.'\n\nWith a sinking of the heart, Marcella murmured thanks and walked away.\nShe found the milliner's shop--and went past it.\n\nWhy should discoveries such as these be so distasteful to her? Her own\norigin was not so exalted that she must needs look down on trades-folk.\nStill, for the moment she all but abandoned her undertaking. Was Godwin\nPeak in truth of so much account to her? Would not the shock of meeting\nhis mother be final? Having come thus far, she must go through with it.\nIf the experience cured her of a hopeless passion, why, what more\ndesirable?\n\nShe entered the shop. A young female assistant came forward with\nrespectful smile, and waited her commands.\n\n'I wish, if you please, to see Mrs. Peak.'\n\n'Oh yes, madam! Will you have the goodness to walk this way?'\n\nToo late Marcella remembered that she ought to have gone to the\nhouse-entrance. The girl led her out of the shop into a dark passage,\nand thence into a sitting-room which smelt of lavender. Here she waited\nfor a few moments; then the door opened softly, and Mrs. Peak presented\nherself.\n\nThere was no shock. The widow had the air of a gentlewoman--walked with\nelderly grace--and spoke with propriety. She resembled Godwin, and this\ntime it was not painful to remark the likeness.\n\n'I have come to Twybridge,' began Marcella, gently and respectfully,\n'that is to say, I have stopped in passing--to ask for the address of\nMr. Godwin Peak. A letter has failed to reach him.\n\nIt was her wish to manage without either disclosing the truth about\nherself or elaborating fictions, but after the first words she felt it\nimpossible not to offer some explanation. Mrs. Peak showed a slight\nsurprise. With the courage of cowardice, Marcella continued more\nrapidly:\n\n'My name is Mrs. Ward. My husband used to know Mr. Peak, in London, a\nfew years ago, but we have been abroad, and unfortunately have lost\nsight of him. We remembered that Mr. Peak's relatives lived at\nTwybridge, and, as we wish very much to renew the old acquaintance, I\ntook the opportunity--passing by rail. I made inquiries in the town,\nand was directed to you--I hope rightly'----\n\nThe widow's face changed to satisfaction. Evidently her straightforward\nmind accepted the story as perfectly credible. Marcella, with\nbitterness, knew herself far from comely enough to suggest perils. She\nlooked old enough for the part she was playing, and the glove upon her\nhand might conceal a wedding-ring.\n\n'Yes, you were directed rightly,' Mrs. Peak made quiet answer. 'I shall\nbe very glad to give you my son's address. He left London about last\nChristmas, and went to live at Exeter.'\n\n'Exeter? We thought he might be out of England.'\n\n'No; he has lived all the time at Exeter. The address is Longbrook\nStreet'--she added the number. 'He is studying, and finds that part of\nthe country pleasant. I am hoping to see him here before very long.'\n\nMarcella did not extend the conversation. She spoke of having to catch\na train, and veiled as well as she could beneath ordinary courtesies\nher perplexity at the information she had received.\n\nWhen she again reached the house at Notting Hill, Christian was absent.\nHe came home about nine in the evening. It was impossible not to remark\nhis strange mood of repressed excitement; but Marcella did not question\nhim, and Christian had resolved to conceal the day's event until he\ncould speak of it without agitation. Before they parted for the night,\nMarcella said carelessly:\n\n'I have decided to go down to Budleigh Salterton when the time comes.'\n\n'That's right!' exclaimed her brother, with satisfaction. 'You couldn't\ndo better--couldn't possibly. It will be a very good thing for you in\nseveral ways.'\n\nAnd each withdrew to brood over a perturbing secret.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThree or four years ago, when already he had conceived the idea of\ntrying his fortune in some provincial town, Peak persuaded himself that\nit would not be difficult to make acquaintances among educated people,\neven though he had no credentials to offer. He indulged his fancy and\npictured all manner of pleasant accidents which surely, sooner or\nlater, must bring him into contact with families of the better sort.\nOne does hear of such occurrences, no doubt. In every town there is\nsome one or other whom a stranger may approach: a medical man--a local\nantiquary--a librarian--a philanthropist; and with moderate advantages\nof mind and address, such casual connections may at times be the\npreface to intimacy, with all resulting benefits. But experience of\nExeter had taught him how slight would have been his chance of getting\non friendly terms with any mortal if he had depended solely on his\npersonal qualities. After a nine months' residence, and with the\nfriendship of such people as the Warricombes, he was daily oppressed by\nhis isolation amid this community of English folk. He had done his\nutmost to adopt the tone of average polished life. He had sat at the\ntables of worthy men, and conversed freely with their sons and\ndaughters; he exchanged greetings in the highways: but this availed him\nnothing. Now, as on the day of his arrival, he was an alien--a lodger.\nWhat else had he ever been, since boyhood? A lodger in Kingsmill, a\nlodger in London, a lodger in Exeter. Nay, even as a boy he could\nscarcely have been said to 'live at home', for from the dawn of\nconscious intelligence he felt himself out of place among familiar\nthings and people, at issue with prevalent opinions. Was he never to\nwin a right of citizenship, never to have a recognised place among men\nassociated in the duties and pleasures of life?\n\nSunday was always a day of weariness and despondency, and at present he\nsuffered from the excitement of his conversation with Sidwell, followed\nas it had been by a night of fever. Extravagant hope had given place to\na depression which could see nothing beyond the immediate gloom. Until\nmid-day he lay in bed. After dinner, finding the solitude of his little\nroom intolerable, he went out to walk in the streets.\n\nNot far from his door some children had gathered in a quiet corner, and\nwere playing at a game on the pavement with pieces of chalk. As he drew\nnear, a policeman, observing the little group, called out to them in a\nstern voice:\n\n'Now then! what are you doing there? Don't you know _what day_ it is?'\n\nThe youngsters fled, conscious of shameful delinquency.\n\nThere it was! There spoke the civic voice, the social rule, the public\nsentiment! Godwin felt that the policeman had rebuked _him_, and in\ndoing so had severely indicated the cause of that isolation which he\nwas condemned to suffer. Yes, all his life he had desired to play games\non Sunday; he had never been able to understand why games on Sunday\nshould be forbidden. And the angry laugh which escaped him as he went\nby the guardian of public morals declared the impossibility of his ever\nbeing at one with communities which made this point the prime test of\nworthiness.\n\nHe walked on at a great speed, chafing, talking to himself. His way\ntook him through Heavitree (when Hooker saw the light here, how easy to\nbelieve that the Anglican Church was the noblest outcome of human\nprogress!) and on and on, until by a lane with red banks of sandstone,\nthick with ferns, shadowed with noble boughs, he came to a hamlet which\nhad always been one of his favourite resorts, so peacefully it lay amid\nthe exquisite rural landscape. The cottages were all closed and silent;\nhark for the reason! From the old church sounded an organ prelude, then\nthe voice of the congregation, joining in one of the familiar hymns.\n\nA significant feature of Godwin's idiosyncrasy. Notwithstanding his\nprofound hatred and contempt of multitudes, he could never hear the\nunion of many voices in song but his breast heaved and a choking warmth\nrose in his throat. Even where prejudice wrought most strongly with\nhim, it had to give way before this rush of emotion; he often hurried\nout of earshot when a group of Salvationists were singing, lest the\ninvoluntary sympathy of his senses should agitate and enrage him. At\npresent he had no wish to draw away. He entered the churchyard, and\nfound the leafy nook with a tombstone where he had often rested. And as\nhe listened to the rude chanting of verse after verse, tears fell upon\nhis cheeks.\n\nThis sensibility was quite distinct from religious feeling. If the note\nof devotion sounding in that simple strain had any effect upon him at\nall, it merely intensified his consciousness of pathos as he thought of\nthe many generations that had worshipped here, living and dying in a\nfaith which was at best a helpful delusion. He could appreciate the\nbeautiful aspects of Christianity as a legend, its nobility as a\nhumanising power, its rich results in literature, its grandeur in\nhistoric retrospect. But at no moment in his life had he felt it as a\nspiritual influence. So far from tending in that direction, as he sat\nand brooded here in the churchyard, he owed to his fit of tearfulness a\ncourage which determined him to abandon all religious pretences, and\nhenceforth trust only to what was sincere in him--his human passion.\nThe future he had sketched to Sidwell was impossible; the rural\npastorate, the life of moral endeavour which in his excitement had\nseemed so nearly a genuine aspiration that it might perchance become\nreality--dreams, dreams! He must woo as a man, and trust to fortune for\nhis escape from a false position. Sidwell should hear nothing more of\nclerical projects. He was by this time convinced that she held far less\ntenaciously than he had supposed to the special doctrines of the\nChurch; and, if he had not deceived himself in interpreting her\nbehaviour, a mutual avowal of love would involve ready consent on her\npart to his abandoning a career which--as he would represent it--had\nbeen adopted under a mistaken impulse. He returned to the point which\nhe had reached when he set forth with the intention of bidding good-bye\nto the Warricombes--except that in flinging away hypocrisy he no longer\nneeded to trample his desires. The change need not be declared till\nafter a lapse of time. For the present his task was to obtain one more\nprivate interview with Sidwell ere she went to London, or, if that\ncould not be, somehow to address her in unmistakable language.\n\nThe fumes were dispelled from his brain, and as he walked homeward he\nplotted and planned with hopeful energy. Sylvia Moorhouse came into his\nmind; could he not in some way make use of her? He had never yet been\nto see her at Budleigh Salterton. That he would do forthwith, and\nperchance the visit might supply him with suggestions.\n\nOn the morrow he set forth, going by train to Exmouth, and thence by\nthe coach which runs twice a day to the little seaside town. The\ndelightful drive, up hill and down dale, with its magnificent views\nover the estuary, and its ever-changing wayside beauties, put him into\nthe best of spirits. About noon, he alighted at the Rolle Arms, the\nhotel to which the coach conducts its passengers, and entered to take a\nmeal. He would call upon the Moorhouses at the conventional hour. The\nintervening time was spent pleasantly enough in loitering about the\npebbled beach. A south-west breeze which had begun to gather clouds\ndrove on the rising tide. By four o'clock there was an end of sunshine,\nand spurts of rain mingled with flying foam. Peak turned inland,\npursued the leafy street up the close-sheltered valley, and came to the\nhouse where his friends dwelt.\n\nIn crossing the garden he caught sight of a lady who sat in a room on\nthe ground floor; her back was turned to the window, and before he\ncould draw near enough to see her better she had moved away, but the\nglimpse he had obtained of her head and shoulders affected him with so\ndistinct an alarm that his steps were checked. It seemed to him that he\nhad recognised the figure, and if he were right.--But the supposition\nwas ridiculous; at all events so vastly improbable, that he would not\nentertain it. And now he descried another face, that of Miss Moorhouse\nherself, and it gave him a reassuring smile. He rang the door bell.\n\nHow happy--he said to himself--those men who go to call upon their\nfriends without a tremor! Even if he had not received that shock a\nmoment ago, he would still have needed to struggle against the\ntreacherous beating of his heart as he waited for admission. It was\nalways so when he visited the Warricombes, or any other family in\nExeter. Not merely in consequence of the dishonest part he was playing,\nbut because he had not quite overcome the nervousness which so\nanguished him in earlier days. The first moment after his entering a\ndrawing-room cost him pangs of complex origin.\n\nHis eyes fell first of all upon Mrs. Moorhouse, who advanced to welcome\nhim. He was aware of three other persons in the room. The nearest, he\ncould perceive without regarding her, was Sidwell's friend; the other\ntwo, on whom he did not yet venture to cast a glance, sat--or rather\nhad just risen--in a dim background. As he shook hands with Sylvia,\nthey drew nearer; one of them was a man, and, as his voice at once\ndeclared, no other than Buckland Warricombe. Peak returned his\ngreeting, and, in the same moment, gazed at the last of the party. Mrs.\nMoorhouse was speaking.\n\n'Mr. Peak--Miss Moxey.'\n\nA compression of the lips was the only sign of disturbance that anyone\ncould have perceived on Godwin's countenance. Already he had strung\nhimself against his wonted agitation, and the added trial did not\nsensibly enhance what he suffered. In discovering that he had rightly\nidentified the figure at the window, he experienced no renewal of the\ndread which brought him to a stand-still. Already half prepared for\nthis stroke of fate, he felt a satisfaction in being able to meet it so\nsteadily. Tumult of thought was his only trouble; it seemed as if his\nbrain must burst with the stress of its lightning operations. In three\nseconds, he re-lived the past, made several distinct anticipations of\nthe future, and still discussed with himself how he should behave this\nmoment. He noted that Marcella's face was bloodless; that her attempt\nto smile resulted in a very painful distortion of brow and lips. And he\nhad leisure to pity her. This emotion prevailed. With a sense of\nmagnanimity, which afterwards excited his wonder, he pressed the cold\nhand and said in a cheerful tone:\n\n'Our introduction took place long ago, if I'm not mistaken. I had no\nidea, Miss Moxey, that you were among Mrs. Moorhouse's friends.'\n\n'Nor I that you were, Mr. Peak,' came the answer, in a steadier voice\nthan Godwin had expected.\n\nMrs. Moorhouse and her daughter made the pleasant exclamations that\nwere called for. Buckland Warricombe, with a doubtful smile on his\nlips, kept glancing from Miss Moxey to her acquaintance and back again.\nPeak at length faced him.\n\n'I hoped we should meet down here this autumn.'\n\n'I should have looked you up in a day or two,' Buckland replied,\nseating himself. 'Do you propose to stay in Exeter through the winter?'\n\n'I'm not quite sure--but I think it likely.'\n\nGodwin turned to the neighbour of whose presence he was most conscious.\n\n'I hope your brother is well, Miss Moxey?'\n\nTheir eyes encountered steadily.\n\n'Yes, he is quite well, thank you. He often says that it seems very\nlong since he heard from you.'\n\n'I'm a bad correspondent.--Is he also in Devonshire?'\n\n'No. In London.'\n\n'What a storm we are going to have!' exclaimed Sylvia, looking to the\nwindow. 'They predicted it yesterday. I should like to be on the top of\nWestdown Beacon--wouldn't you, Miss Moxey?'\n\n'I am quite willing to go with you.'\n\n'And what pleasure do you look for up there?' asked Warricombe, in a\nblunt, matter-of-fact tone.\n\n'Now, there's a question!' cried Sylvia, appealing to the rest of the\ncompany.\n\n'I agree with Mr. Warricombe,' remarked her mother. 'It's better to be\nin a comfortable room.'\n\n'Oh, you Radicals! What a world you will make of it in time!'\n\nSylvia affected to turn away in disgust, and happening to glance\nthrough the window she saw two young ladies approaching from the road.\n\n'The Walworths--struggling desperately with their umbrellas.'\n\n'I shouldn't wonder if you think it unworthy of an artist to carry an\numbrella,' said Buckland.\n\n'Now you suggest it, I certainly do. They should get nobly drenched.'\n\nShe went out into the hall, and soon returned with her friends--Miss\nWalworth the artist, Miss Muriel Walworth, and a youth, their brother.\nIn the course of conversation Peak learnt that Miss Moxey was the guest\nof this family, and that she had been at Budleigh Salterton with them\nonly a day or two. For the time he listened and observed, endeavouring\nto postpone consideration of the dangers into which he had suddenly\nfallen. Marcella had made herself his accomplice, thus far, in\ndisguising the real significance of their meeting, and whether she\nwould betray him in her subsequent talk with the Moorhouses remained a\nmatter of doubt. Of course he must have assurance of her\ndisposition--but the issues involved were too desperate for instant\nscrutiny. He felt the gambler's excitement, an irrational pleasure in\nthe consciousness that his whole future was at stake. Buckland\nWarricombe had a keen eye upon him, and doubtless was eager to strike a\ntrain of suspicious circumstances. His face, at all events, should give\nno sign of discomposure. Indeed, he found so much enjoyment in the\nbright gossip of this assembly of ladies that the smile he wore was\nperfectly natural.\n\nThe Walworths, he gathered, were to return to London in a week's time.\nThis meant, in all probability, that Marcella's stay here would not be\nprolonged beyond that date. Perhaps he could find an opportunity of\nseeing her apart from her friends. In reply to a question from Mrs.\nMoorhouse, he made known that he proposed staying at the Rolle Arms for\nseveral days, and when he had spoken he glanced at Marcella. She\nunderstood him; he felt sure. An invitation to lunch here on the morrow\nwas of course accepted.\n\nBefore leaving, he exchanged a few words with Buckland.\n\n'Your relatives will be going to town very soon, I understand.\n\nWarricombe nodded.\n\n'Shall I see you at Exeter?' Godwin continued.\n\n'I'm not sure. I shall go over to-morrow, but it's uncertain whether I\nshall still be there when you return.'\n\nThe Radical was distinctly less amicable than even on the last occasion\nof their meeting. They shook hands in rather a perfunctory way.\n\nEarly in the evening there was a temporary lull in the storm; rain no\nlonger fell, and in spaces of the rushing sky a few stars showed\nthemselves. Unable to rest at the hotel, Peak set out for a walk\ntowards the cliff summit called Westdown Beacon; he could see little\nmore than black vacancies, but a struggle with the wind suited his\ntemper, and he enjoyed the incessant roar of surf in the darkness.\nAfter an hour of this buffeting he returned to the beach, and stood as\nclose as possible to the fierce breakers. No person was in sight. But\nwhen he began to move towards the upper shore, three female figures\ndetached themselves from the gloom and advanced in his direction. They\ncame so near that their voices were audible, and thereupon he stepped\nup to them.\n\n'Are you going to the Beacon after all, Miss Moorhouse?'\n\nSylvia was accompanied by Agatha Walworth and Miss Moxey. She explained\nlaughingly that they had stolen out, by agreement, whilst the males of\ntheir respective households still lingered at the dinner-table.\n\n'But Mr. Warricombe was right after all. We shall be blown to pieces. A\nvery little of the romantic goes a long way, nowadays.'\n\nGodwin was determined to draw Marcella aside. Seemingly she met his\nwish, for as all turned to regain the shelter of houses she fell behind\nher female companions, and stood close by him.\n\n'I want to see you before you go back to London,' he said, bending his\nhead near to hers.\n\n'I wrote a letter to you this morning,' was her reply.\n\n'A letter? To what address?'\n\n'Your address at Exeter.'\n\n'But how did you know it?'\n\n'I'll explain afterwards.'\n\n'When can I see you?'\n\n'Not here. It's impossible. I shall go to Exeter, and there write to\nyou again.'\n\n'Very well. You promise to do this?'\n\n'Yes, I promise.'\n\nThere was danger even in the exchange of these hurried sentences. Miss\nWalworth had glanced back, and might possibly have caught a phrase that\naroused curiosity. Having accompanied the girls to within view of their\ndestination, Peak said good-night, and went home to spend the rest of\nthe evening in thought which was sufficiently absorbing.\n\nThe next day he had no sight of Marcella. At luncheon the Moorhouses\nwere alone. Afterwards Godwin accepted a proposal of the mathematician\n(who was generally invisible amid his formulae) for a walk up the Otter\nvalley. Naturally they talked of Coleridge, whose metaphysical side\nappealed to Moorhouse. Peak dwelt on the human and poetical, and was\nled by that peculiar recklessness of mood, which at times relieved his\nnervous tension, to defend opium eating, as a source of pleasurable\nexperience.\n\n'You will hardly venture on that paradox in the pulpit,' remarked his\ncompanion, with laughter.\n\n'Perhaps not. But I have heard arguments from that place decidedly more\nimmoral.'\n\n'No doubt.'\n\nGodwin corrected the impression he perhaps had made by turning with\nsudden seriousness to another subject. The ironic temptation was\nterribly strong in him just now. One is occasionally possessed by a\ndesire to shout in the midst of a silent assembly; and impulse of the\nsame kind kept urging him to utter words which would irretrievably ruin\nhis prospects. The sense that life is an intolerable mummery can with\ndifficulty be controlled by certain minds, even when circumstances\noffer no keen incitement to rebellion. But Peak's position to-day\ndemanded an incessant effort to refrain from self-betrayal. What a joy\nto declare himself a hypocrite, and snap mocking fingers in the world's\nface! As a safeguard, he fixed his mind upon Sidwell, recalled her\nfeatures and her voice as clearly as possible, stamped into his heart\nthe conviction that she half loved him.\n\nWhen he was alone again, he of a sudden determined to go to Exeter. He\ncould no longer endure uncertainty as to the contents of Marcella's\nletter. As it was too late for the coach, he set off and walked five\nmiles to Exmouth, where he caught a train.\n\nThe letter lay on his table, and with it one on which he recognised his\nmother's handwriting.\n\nMarcella wrote in the simplest way, quite as if their intercourse had\nnever been disturbed. As she happened to be staying with friends at\nBudleigh Salterton, it seemed possible for her to meet him. Might she\nhope that he would call at the hotel in Exeter, if she wrote again to\nmake an appointment?\n\nWell, that needed no reply. But how had she discovered the address? Was\nhis story known in London? In a paroxysm of fury, he crushed the letter\ninto a ball and flung it away. The veins of his forehead swelled; he\nwalked about the room with senseless violence, striking his fist\nagainst furniture and walls. It would have relieved him to sob and cry\nlike a thwarted child, but only a harsh sound, half-groan,\nhalf-laughter, burst from his throat.\n\nThe fit passed, and he was able to open the letter from Twybridge, the\nfirst he had received from his mother for more than a month. He\nexpected to find nothing of interest, but his attention was soon caught\nby a passage, which ran thus:\n\n'Have you heard from some friends of yours, called Ward? Some time ago\na lady called here to ask for your address. She said her name was Mrs.\nWard, and that her husband, who had been abroad for a long time, very\nmuch wished to find you again. Of course I told her where you were to\nbe found. It was just after I had written, or I should have let you\nknow about it before.'\n\nWard? He knew no one of that name. Could it be Marcella who had done\nthis? It looked more than likely; he believed her capable of strange\nproceedings.\n\nIn the morning he returned to the seaside. Prospect of pleasure there\nwas none, but by moving about he made the time pass more quickly.\nWandering in the lanes (which would have delighted him with their\nautumnal beauties had his mind been at rest), he came upon Miss\nWalworth, busy with a water-colour sketch. Though their acquaintance\nwas so slight, he stopped for conversation, and the artist's manner\nappeared to testify that Marcella had as yet made no unfavourable\nreport of him. By mentioning that he would return home on the morrow,\nhe made sure that Marcella would be apprised of this. Perhaps she might\nshorten her stay, and his suspense.\n\nBack in Longbrook Street once more, he found another letter. It was\nfrom Mrs. Warricombe, who wrote to tell him of their coming removal to\nLondon, and added an invitation to dine four days hence. Then at all\nevents he would speak again with Sidwell. But to what purpose? Could he\nlet her go away for months, and perhaps all but forget him among the\nmany new faces that would surround her. He saw no feasible way of being\nwith her in private. To write was to run the gravest risk; things were\nnot ripe for that. To take Martin into his confidence? That asked too\nmuch courage. Deliberate avowals of this kind seemed to him ludicrous\nand humiliating, and under the circumstances--no, no; what force of\nsincerity could make him appear other than a scheming adventurer?\n\nHe lived in tumult of mind and senses. When at length, on the day\nbefore his engagement with the Warricombes, there came a note from\nMarcella, summoning him to the interview agreed upon, he could scarcely\nendure the hour or two until it was time to set forth; every minute\ncost him a throb of pain. The torment must have told upon his visage,\nfor on entering the room where Marcella waited he saw that she looked\nat him with a changing expression, as if something surprised her.\n\nThey shook hands, but without a word. Marcella pointed to a chair, yet\nremained standing. She was endeavouring to smile; her eyes fell, and\nshe coloured.\n\n'Don't let us make each other uncomfortable,' Peak exclaimed suddenly,\nin the off-hand tone of friendly intimacy. 'There's nothing tragic in\nthis affair, after all. Let us talk quietly.'\n\nMarcella seated herself.\n\n'I had reasons,' he went on, 'for going away from my old acquaintances\nfor a time. Why not, if I chose? You have found me out. Very well; let\nus talk it over as we have discussed many another moral or\npsychological question.'\n\nHe did not meditate these sentences. Something must of necessity be\nsaid, and words shaped themselves for him. His impulse was to avoid the\nemotional, to talk with this problematic woman as with an intellectual\nfriend of his own sex.\n\n'Forgive me,' were the first sounds that came from Marcella's lips. She\nspoke with bent head, and almost in a whisper.\n\n'What have I to forgive?' He sat down and leaned sideways in the easy\nchair. 'You were curious about my doings? What more natural?'\n\n'Do you know how I learnt where you were?'\n\nShe looked up for an instant.\n\n'I have a suspicion. You went to Twybridge?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'But not in your own name?'\n\n'I can hardly tell why not.'\n\nPeak laughed. He was physically and mentally at rest in comparison with\nhis state for the past few days. Things had a simpler aspect all at\nonce. After all, who would wish to interfere maliciously with him?\nWomen like to be in secrets, and probably Marcella would preserve his.\n\n'What conjectures had you made about me?' he asked, with an air of\namusement.\n\n'Many, of course. But I heard something not long ago which seemed so\nunlikely, yet was told so confidently, that at last I couldn't overcome\nmy wish to make inquiries.'\n\n'And what was that?'\n\n'Mr. Malkin has been to America, and he declared that he had met you in\nthe streets of Boston--and that you refused to admit you were yourself.'\n\nPeak laughed still more buoyantly. His mood was eager to seize on any\npoint that afforded subject for jest.\n\n'Malkin seems to have come across my Doppelganger. One mustn't pretend\nto certainty in anything, but I am disposed to think I never was in\nBoston.'\n\n'He was of course mistaken.'\n\nMarcella's voice had an indistinctness very unlike her ordinary tone.\nAs a rule she spoke with that clearness and decision which corresponds\nto qualities of mind not commonly found in women. But confidence seemed\nto have utterly deserted her; she had lost her individuality, and was\nweakly feminine.\n\n'I have been here since last Christmas,' said Godwin, after a pause.\n\n'Yes. I know.'\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\n'No doubt your friends have told you as much as they know of me?'\n\n'Yes--they have spoken of you.'\n\n'And what does it amount to?'\n\nHe regarded her steadily, with a smile of indifference.\n\n'They say'--she gazed at him as if constrained to do so--'that you are\ngoing into the Church.' And as soon as she uttered the last word, a\npainful laugh escaped her.\n\n'Nothing else? No comments?'\n\n'I think Miss Moorhouse finds it difficult to understand.'\n\n'Miss Moorhouse?' He reflected, still smiling. 'I shouldn't wonder. She\nhas a sceptical mind, and she doesn't know me well enough to understand\nme.'\n\n'Doesn't know you well enough?'\n\nShe repeated the words mechanically. Peak gave her a keen glance.\n\n'Has she led you to suppose,' he asked, 'that we are on intimate terms?'\n\n'No.' The word fell from her, absently, despondently.\n\n'Miss Moxey, would anything be gained by our discussing my position? If\nyou think it a mystery, hadn't we better leave it so?'\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n'But perhaps,' he went on, 'you have told them--the Walworths and the\nMoorhouses--that I owe my friends an explanation? When I see them\nagain, perhaps I shall be confronted with cold, questioning faces?'\n\n'I haven't said a word that could injure you,' Marcella replied, with\nsomething of her usual self-possession, passing her eyes distantly over\nhis face as she spoke.\n\n'I knew the suggestion was unjust, when I made it.'\n\n'Then why should you refuse me your confidence?'\n\nShe bent forward slightly, but with her eyes cast down. Tone and\nfeatures intimated a sense of shame, due partly to the feeling that she\noffered complicity in deceit.\n\n'What can I tell you more than you know?' said Godwin, coldly. 'I\npropose to become a clergyman, and I have acknowledged to you that my\nmotive is ambition. As the matter concerns my conscience, that must\nrest with myself; I have spoken of it to no one. But you may depend\nupon it that I am prepared for every difficulty that may spring up. I\nknew, of course, that sooner or later some one would discover me here.\nWell, I have changed my opinions, that's all; who can demand more than\nthat?'\n\nMarcella answered in a tone of forced composure.\n\n'You owe me no explanation at all. Yet we have known each other for a\nlong time, and it pains me that--to be suddenly told that we are no\nmore to each other than strangers.'\n\n'Are we talking like strangers, Marcella?'\n\nShe flushed, and her eyes gleamed as they fixed themselves upon him for\nan instant. He had never before dreamt of addressing her so familiarly,\nand least of all in this moment was she prepared for it. Godwin\ndespised himself for the impulse to which he had yielded, but its\npolicy was justified. He had taken one more step in disingenuousness--a\nsmall matter.\n\n'Let it be one of those things on which even friends don't open their\nminds to each other,' he pursued. 'I am living in solitude, and perhaps\nmust do so for several years yet. If I succeed in my purposes, you will\nsee me again on the old terms; if I fail, then too we shall be\nfriends--if you are willing.'\n\n'You won't tell me what those purposes are?'\n\n'Surely you can imagine them.'\n\n'Will you let me ask you--do you look for help to anyone that I have\nseen here?' She spoke with effort and with shame.\n\n'To no one that you have met,' he answered, shortly.\n\n'Then to some one in Exeter? I have been told that you have friends.'\n\nHe was irritated by her persistency, and his own inability to decide\nupon the most prudent way of answering.\n\n'You mean the Warricombe family, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'I think it very likely that Mr. Warricombe may be able to help me\nsubstantially.'\n\nMarcella kept silence. Then, without raising her eyes, she murmured:\n\n'You will tell me no more?'\n\n'There is nothing more to tell.'\n\nShe bit her lips, as if to compel them to muteness. Her breath came\nquickly; she glanced this way and that, like one who sought an escape.\nAfter eyeing her askance for a moment, Peak rose.\n\n'You are going?' she said.\n\n'Yes; but surely there is no reason why we shouldn't say good-bye in a\nnatural and friendly way?'\n\n'Can you forgive me for that deceit I practised?'\n\nPeak laughed.\n\n'What does it matter? We should in any case have met at Budleigh\nSalterton.'\n\n'No. I had no serious thought of accepting their invitation.'\n\nShe stood looking away from him, endeavouring to speak as though the\ndenial had but slight significance. Godwin stirred impatiently.\n\n'I should never have gone to Twybridge,' Marcella continued, 'but for\nMr. Malkin's story.'\n\nHe turned to her.\n\n'You mean that his story had a disagreeable sound?'\n\nMarcella kept silence, her fingers working together.\n\n'And is your mind relieved?' he added.\n\n'I wish you were back in London. I wish this change had never come to\npass.'\n\n'I wish that several things in my life had never come to pass. But I am\nhere, and my resolve is unalterable. One thing I must ask you--how\nshall you represent my position to your brother?'\n\nFor a moment Marcella hesitated. Then, meeting his look, she answered\nwith nervous haste:\n\n'I shall not mention you to him.'\n\nAshamed to give any sign of satisfaction, and oppressed by the feeling\nthat he owed her gratitude, Peak stood gazing towards the windows with\nan air of half-indifferent abstractedness. It was better to let the\ninterview end thus, without comment or further question; so he turned\nabruptly, and offered his hand.\n\n'Good-bye. You will hear of me, or from me.'\n\n'Good-bye!'\n\nHe tried to smile; but Marcella had a cold face, expressive of more\ndignity than she had hitherto shown. As he closed the door she was\nstill looking towards him.\n\nHe knew what the look meant. In his position, a man of ordinary fibre\nwould long ago have nursed the flattering conviction that Marcella\nloved him. Godwin had suspected it, but in a vague, unemotional way,\nnever attaching importance to the matter. What he _had_ clearly\nunderstood was, that Christian wished to inspire him with interest in\nMarcella, and on that account, when in her company, he sometimes set\nhimself to display a deliberate negligence. No difficult undertaking,\nfor he was distinctly repelled by the thought of any relations with her\nmore intimate than had been brought about by his cold intellectual\nsympathy. Her person was still as disagreeable to him as when he first\nmet her in her uncle's house at Twybridge. If a man sincerely hopes\nthat a woman does not love him (which can seldom be the case where a\nsuggestion of such feeling ever arises), he will find it easy to\nbelieve that she does not. Peak not only had the benefit of this\nprinciple; the constitution of his mind made it the opposite of natural\nfor him to credit himself with having inspired affection. That his male\nfriends held him in any warm esteem always appeared to him improbable,\nand as regards women his modesty was profound. The simplest\nexplanation, that he was himself incapable of pure devotedness, perhaps\nhits the truth. Unsympathetic, however, he could with no justice be\ncalled, and now that the reality of Marcella's love was forced upon his\nconsciousness he thought of her with sincere pity,--the emotion which\nhad already possessed him (though he did not then analyse it) when he\nunsuspectingly looked into her troubled face a few days ago.\n\nIt was so hard to believe, that, on reaching home, he sat for a long\ntime occupied with the thought of it, to the exclusion of his own\nanxieties. What! this woman had made of _him_ an ideal such as he\nhimself sought among the most exquisite of her sex? How was that\npossible? What quality of his, personal, psychical, had such magnetic\nforce? What sort of being was he in Marcella's eyes? Reflective men\nmust often enough marvel at the success of whiskered and trousered\nmortals in wooing the women of their desire, for only by a specific\nimagination can a person of one sex assume the emotions of the other.\nGodwin had neither that endowment nor the peculiar self-esteem which\nmakes love-winning a matter of course to some intelligent males. His\nnative arrogance signified a low estimate of mankind at large, rather\nthan an overweening appreciation of his own qualities, and in his most\npresumptuous moments he had never claimed the sexual refulgence which\nmany a commonplace fellow so gloriously exhibits. At most, he had hoped\nthat some woman might find him _interesting_, and so be led on to like\nhim well enough for the venture of matrimony. Passion at length\nconstrained him to believe that his ardour might be genuinely\nreciprocated, but even now it was only in paroxysms that he held this\nassurance; the hours of ordinary life still exposed him to the familiar\nself-criticism, sometimes more scathing than ever. He dreaded the\nlooking-glass, consciously avoided it; and a like disparagement of his\ninner being tortured him through the endless labyrinths of erotic\nreverie.\n\nYet here was a woman who so loved him that not even a proud temper and\nhis candid indifference could impose restraint upon her emotions. As he\nlistened to the most significant of her words he was distressed with\nshame, and now, in recalling them, he felt that he should have said\nsomething, done something, to disillusion her. Could he not easily show\nhimself in a contemptible light? But reflection taught him that the\nshame he had experienced on Marcella's behalf was blended with a\ngratification which forbade him at the moment to be altogether\nunamiable. It was not self-interest alone that prompted his use of her\nfamiliar name. In the secret places of his heart he was thankful to her\nfor a most effective encouragement. She had confirmed him in the hope\nthat he was loved by Sidwell.\n\nAnd now that he no longer feared her, Marcella was gradually dismissed\nfrom mind. For a day or two he avoided the main streets of the town,\nlest a chance meeting with her should revive disquietude; but, by the\ntime that Mrs. Warricombe's invitation permitted him once more to\nfollow his desire, he felt assured that Marcella was back in London,\nand the sense of distance helped to banish her among unrealities.\n\nThe hours had never pressed upon him with such demand for resolution.\nIn the look with which Sidwell greeted him when he met her in the\ndrawing-room, he seemed to read much more than wonted friendliness; it\nwas as though a half secret already existed between them. But no\noccasion offered for a word other than trivial. The dinner-party\nconsisted of about a score of people, and throughout the evening Peak\nfound himself hopelessly severed from the one person whose presence was\nanything but an importunity to him. He maddened with jealousy, with\nfear, with ceaseless mental manoeuvring. More than one young man of\nagreeable aspect appeared to be on dangerous terms with Sidwell,\napproaching her with that air of easy, well-bred intimacy which Godwin\nknew too well he would never be able to assume in perfection. Again he\nwas humiliated by self-comparison with social superiors, and again\nreminded that in this circle he had a place merely on sufferance. Mrs.\nWarricombe, when he chanced to speak with her, betrayed the slight\nregard in which she really held him, and Martin devoted himself to more\nimportant people. The evening was worse than lost.\n\nYet in two more days Sidwell would be beyond reach. He writhed upon his\nbed as the image of her loveliness returned again and again,--her face\nas she conversed at table, her dignity as she rose with the other\nladies, her smile when he said good-night. A smile that meant more than\ncivility; he was convinced of it. But memory would not support him\nthrough half-a-year of solitude and ill-divining passion.\n\nHe would write to her, and risk all. Two o'clock in the morning saw him\nsitting half-dressed at the table, raging over the difficulties of a\ncomposition which should express his highest self. Four o'clock saw the\nblotched letter torn into fragments. He could not write as he wished,\ncould not hit the tone of manly appeal. At five o'clock he turned\nwretchedly into bed again.\n\nA day of racking headache; then the long restful sleep which brings\ngood counsel. It was well that he had not sent a letter, nor in any\nother way committed himself. If Sidwell were ever to be his wife, the\nend could only be won by heroic caution and patience. Thus far he had\nachieved notable results; to rush upon his aim would be the most absurd\ndeparture from a hopeful scheme gravely devised and pursued. To wait,\nto establish himself in the confidence of this family, to make sure his\nprogress step by step, that was the course indicated from the first by\nhis calm reason. Other men might triumph by sudden audacity; for him\nwas no hope save in slow, persevering energy of will. Passion had all\nbut ruined him; now he had recovered self-control.\n\nSidwell's six months in London might banish him from her mind, might\nsubstitute some rival against whom it would be hopeless to contend.\nYes; but a thousand possibilities stood with menace in the front of\nevery great enterprise. Before next spring he might be dead.\n\nDefiance, then, of every foreboding, of every shame; and a life that\nmoulded itself in the ardour of unchangeable resolve.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nMartin Warricombe was reconciled to the prospect of a metropolitan\nwinter by the fact that his old friend Thomas Gale, formerly Geological\nProfessor at Whitelaw College, had of late returned from a three years'\nsojourn in North America, and now dwelt in London. The breezy man of\nscience was welcomed back among his brethren with two-fold\nfelicitation; his book on the Appalachians would have given no\ninsufficient proof of activity abroad, but evidence more generally\ninteresting accompanied him in the shape of a young and beautiful wife.\nNot every geologist whose years have entered the fifties can go forth\nand capture in second marriage a charming New England girl, thirty\nyears his junior. Yet those who knew Mr. Gale--his splendid physique,\nhis bluff cordiality, the vigour of his various talk--were scarcely\nsurprised. The young lady was no heiress; she had, in fact, been a\nschool teacher, and might have wearied through her best years in that\nuncongenial pursuit. Transplanted to the richest English soil, she\ndeveloped remarkable aptitudes. A month or two of London exhibited her\nas a type of all that is most attractive in American womanhood.\n\nBetween Mrs. Gale and the Warricombes intimacy was soon established.\nSidwell saw much of her, and liked her. To this meditative English girl\nthe young American offered an engrossing problem, for she avowed her\nindifference to all religious dogmas, yet was singularly tolerant and\ndisplayed a moral fervour which Sidwell had believed inseparable from\nChristian faith. At the Gales' house assembled a great variety of\nintellectual people, and with her father's express approval (Martin had\nhis reasons) Sidwell made the most of this opportunity of studying the\nmodern world. Only a few days after her arrival in London, she became\nacquainted with a Mr. Walsh, a brother of that heresiarch, the Whitelaw\nProfessor, whose name was still obnoxious to her mother. He was a\nwell-favoured man of something between thirty and forty, brilliant in\nconversation, personally engaging, and known by his literary\nproductions, which found small favour with conservative readers. With\nsurprise, Sidwell in a short time became aware that Mr. Walsh had a\nfrank liking for her society. He was often to be seen in Mrs.\nWarricombe's drawing-room, and at Mrs Gale's he yet more frequently\nobtained occasions of talking with her. The candour with which he\nexpressed himself on most subjects enabled her to observe a type of\nmind which at present had peculiar interest for her. Discretion often\nput restraint upon her curiosity, but none the less Mr. Walsh had\nplausible grounds for believing that his advances were not unwelcome.\nHe saw that Sidwell's gaze occasionally rested upon him with a pleasant\ngravity, and noted the mood of meditation which sometimes came upon her\nwhen he had drawn apart. The frequency of these dialogues was observed\nby Mrs Warricombe, and one evening she broached the subject to her\ndaughter rather abruptly.\n\n'I am surprised that you have taken such a liking to Mr. Walsh.'\n\nSidwell coloured, and made answer in the quiet tone which her mother\nhad come to understand as a reproof, a hint of defective delicacy:\n\n'I don't think I have behaved in a way that should cause you surprise.'\n\n'It seemed to me that you were really very--friendly with him.'\n\n'Yes, I am always friendly. But nothing more.'\n\n'Don't you think there's a danger of his misunderstanding you, Sidwell?'\n\n'I don't, mother. Mr. Walsh understands that we differ irreconcilably\non subjects of the first importance. I have never allowed him to lose\nsight of that.'\n\nIntellectual differences were of much less account to Mrs. Warricombe\nthan to her daughter, and her judgment in a matter such as this was\nconsequently far more practical.\n\n'If I may advise you, dear, you oughtn't to depend much on that. I am\nnot the only one who has noticed something--I only mention it, you\nknow.'\n\nSidwell mused gravely. In a minute or two she looked up and said in her\ngentlest voice:\n\n'Thank you, mother. I will be more careful.'\n\nPerhaps she had lost sight of prudence, forgetting that Mr. Walsh could\nnot divine her thoughts. Her interest in him was impersonal; when he\nspoke she was profoundly attentive, only because her mind would have\nbeen affected in the same way had she been reading his words instead of\nlistening to them. She could not let him know that another face was\noften more distinct to her imagination than his to her actual sight,\nand that her thoughts were frequently more busy with a remembered\ndialogue than with this in which she was engaged. She had abundantly\nsafe-guarded herself against serious misconstruction, but if gossip\nwere making her its subject, it would be inconsiderate not to regard\nthe warning.\n\nIt came, indeed, at a moment when she was very willing to rest from\nsocial activity. At the time of her last stay in London, three years\nago, she had not been ripe for reflection on what she saw. Now her mind\nwas kept so incessantly at strain, and her emotions answered so\nintensely to every appeal, that at length she felt the need of repose.\nIt was not with her as with the young women who seek only to make the\nmost of their time in agreeable ways. Sidwell's vital forces were\nconcentrated in an effort of profound spiritual significance. The\ncritical hour of her life was at hand, and she exerted every faculty in\nthe endeavour to direct herself aright.\n\nHaving heard from his brother that Sidwell had not been out for several\ndays, Buckland took an opportunity of calling at the house early one\nmorning. He found her alone in a small drawing-room, and sat down with\nan expression of weary discontent. This mood had been frequent in the\nyoung man of late. Sidwell remarked a change that was coming over him,\na gloominess unnatural to his character.\n\n'Seen the Walworths lately?' he asked, when his sister had assured him\nthat she was not seriously ailing.\n\n'We called a few days ago.'\n\n'Meet anyone there?'\n\n'Two or three people. No one that interested me.'\n\n'You haven't come across some friends of theirs called Moxey?'\n\n'Oh yes! Miss Moxey was there one afternoon about a fortnight ago.'\n\n'Did you talk to her at all?' Buckland asked.\n\n'Yes; we hadn't much to say to each other, though. How do you know of\nher? Through Sylvia, I daresay.'\n\n'Met her when I was last down yonder.'\n\nSidwell had long since heard from her friend of Miss Moxey's visit to\nBudleigh Salterton, but she was not aware that Buckland had been there\nat the same time. Sylvia had told her, however, of the acquaintance\nexisting between Miss Moxey and Peak, a point of much interest to her,\nthough it remained a mere unconnected fact. In her short conversation\nwith Marcella, she had not ventured to refer to it.\n\n'Do you know anything of the family?'\n\n'I was going to ask you the same,' returned Buckland. 'I thought you\nmight have heard something from the Walworths.'\n\nSidwell had in fact sought information, but, as her relations with the\nWalworths were formal, such inquiry as she could make from them\nelicited nothing more than she already knew from Sylvia.\n\n'Are you anxious to discover who they are?' she asked.\n\nBuckland moved uneasily, and became silent.\n\n'Oh, not particularly.'\n\n'I dined with Walsh yesterday,' he said, at length, struggling to shake\noff the obvious dreariness that oppressed him. 'He suits me; we can get\non together.'\n\n'No doubt.'\n\n'But you don't dislike him, I think?'\n\n'Implying that I dislike _you_,' said Sidwell, lightsomely.\n\n'You have no affection for my opinions.--Walsh is an honest man.'\n\n'I hope so.'\n\n'He says what he thinks. No compromise with fashionable hypocrisy.'\n\n'I despise that kind of thing quite as much as you do.'\n\nThey looked at each other. Buckland had a sullen air.\n\n'Yes, in your own way,' he replied, 'you are sincere enough, I have no\ndoubt. I wish all women were so.\n\n'What exception have you in mind?'\n\nHe did not seem inclined to answer.\n\n'Perhaps it is your understanding of them that's at fault,' added\nSidwell, gently.\n\n'Not in one case, at all events,' he exclaimed. 'Supposes you were\nasked to define Miss Moorhouse's religious opinions, how would you do\nit?'\n\n'I am not well enough acquainted with them.'\n\n'Do you imagine for a moment that she has any more faith in the\nsupernatural than I have?'\n\n'I think there is a great difference between her position and yours.'\n\n'Because she is hypocritical!' cried Buckland, angrily. 'She deceives\nyou. She hasn't the courage to be honest.'\n\nSidwell wore a pained expression.\n\n'You judge her,' she replied, 'far too coarsely. No one is called upon\nto make an elaborate declaration of faith as often as such subjects are\nspoken of. Sylvia thinks so differently from you about almost\neverything that, when she happens to agree with you, you are misled and\nmisinterpret her whole position.'\n\n'I understand her perfectly,' Buckland went on, in the same irritated\nvoice. 'There are plenty of women like her--with brains enough, but\nutter and contemptible cowards. Cowards even to themselves, perhaps.\nWhat can you expect, when society is based on rotten shams?'\n\nFor several minutes he pursued this vein of invective, then took an\nabrupt leave. Sidwell had a piece of grave counsel ready to offer him,\nbut he was clearly in no mood to listen, so she postponed it.\n\nA day or two after this, she received a letter from Sylvia. Miss\nMoorhouse was anything but a good correspondent; she often confessed\nher inability to compose anything but the briefest and driest statement\nof facts. With no little surprise, therefore, Sidwell found that the\nenvelope contained two sheets all but covered with her friend's cramped\nhandwriting. The letter began with apology for long delay in\nacknowledging two communications.\n\n'But you know well enough my dilatory disposition. I have written to\nyou mentally at least once a day, and I hope you have mentally received\nthe results--that is to say, have assured yourself of my goodwill to\nyou, and I had nothing else to send.'\n\nAt this point Sylvia had carefully obliterated two lines, blackening\nthe page into unsightliness. In vain Sidwell pored over the effaced\npassage, led to do so by a fancy that she could discern a capital P,\nwhich looked like the first letter of a name. The writer continued:\n\n'Don't trouble yourself so much about insoluble questions. Try to be\nmore positive--I don't say become a Positivist. Keep a receptive mind,\nand wait for time to shape your views of things. I see that London has\nagitated and confused you; you have lost your bearings amid the maze of\ncontradictory finger-posts. If you were here I could soothe you with\nSylvian (much the same as sylvan) philosophy, but I can't write.'\n\nHere the letter was to have ended, for on the line beneath was legible\n'Give my love to Fanny', but this again had been crossed out, and there\nfollowed a long paragraph:\n\nI have been reading a book about ants. Perhaps you know all the\nwonderful things about them, but I had neglected that branch of natural\nhistory. Their doings are astonishingly like those of an animal called\nman, and it seems to me that I have discovered one point of resemblance\nwhich perhaps has never been noted. Are you aware that at an early\nstage of their existence ants have wings? They fly--how shall I express\nit?--only for the brief time of their courtship and marriage and when\nthese important affairs are satisfactorily done with their wings wither\naway, and thenceforth they have to content themselves with running\nabout on the earth. Now isn't this a remarkable parallel to one stage\nof human life? Do not men and women also soar and flutter--at a certain\ntime? And don't their wings manifestly drop off as soon as the end of\nthat skyward movement has been achieved? If the gods had made me\npoetical, I would sonnetise on this idea. Do you know any poet with a\nfondness for the ant-philosophy? If so, offer him this suggestion with\nliberty to \"make any use of it he likes\".\n\n'But the fact of the matter is that some human beings are never winged\nat all. I am decidedly coming to the conclusion that I am one of those.\nThink of me henceforth as an apteryx--you have a dictionary at hand?\nLike the tailless fox, I might naturally maintain that my state is the\nmore gracious, but honestly I am not assured of that. It may be (I half\nbelieve it is) a good thing to soar and flutter, and at times I regret\nthat nature has forbidden me that experience. Decidedly I would never\ntry to _persuade anyone else_ to forego the use of wings. Bear this in\nmind, my dear girl. But I suspect that in time to come there will be an\nincreasing number of female human creatures who from their birth are\ncontent with _walking_. Not long ago, I had occasion to hint\nthat--though under another figure--to your brother Buckland. I hope he\nunderstood me--I think he did--and that he wasn't offended.\n\n'I had something to tell you. I have forgotten it--never mind.'\n\nAnd therewith the odd epistle was concluded. Sidwell perused the latter\npart several times. Of course she was at no loss to interpret it.\nBuckland's demeanour for the past two months had led her to surmise\nthat his latest visit to Budleigh Salterton had finally extinguished\nthe hopes which drew him in that direction. His recent censure of\nSylvia might be thus explained. She grieved that her brother's suit\nshould be discouraged, but could not persuade herself that Sylvia's\ndecision was final. The idea of a match between those two was very\npleasant to her. For Buckland she imagined it would be fraught with\ngood results, and for Sylvia, on the whole, it might be the best thing.\n\nBefore she replied to her friend nearly a month passed, and Christmas\nwas at hand. Again she had been much in society. Mr. Walsh had renewed\nhis unmistakable attentions, and, when her manner of meeting them began\nto trouble him with doubts, had cleared the air by making a formal\noffer of marriage. Sidwell's negative was absolute, much to her\nmother's relief. On the day of that event, she wrote rather a long\nletter to Sylvia, but Mr. Walsh's name was not mentioned in it.\n\n'Mother tells me [it began] that _your_ mother has written to her from\nSalisbury, and that you yourself are going there for a stay of some\nweeks. I am sorry, for on the Monday after Christmas Day I shall be in\nExeter, and hoped somehow to have seen you. We--mother and I--are going\nto run down together, to see after certain domestic affairs; only for\nthree days at most.\n\n'Your ant-letter was very amusing, but it saddened me, dear Sylvia. I\ncan't make any answer. On these subjects it is very difficult even for\nthe closest friends to open their minds to each other. I don't--and\ndon't wish to--believe in the _apteryx_ profession; that's all I must\nsay.\n\n'My health has been indifferent since I last wrote. We live in all but\ncontinuous darkness, and very seldom indeed breathe anything that can\nbe called air. No doubt this state of things has its effect on me. I\nlook forwards, not to the coming of spring, for here we shall see\nnothing of its beauties, but to the month which will release us from\nLondon. I want to smell the pines again, and to see the golden gorse in\n_our_ road.\n\n'By way of being more \"positive\", I have read much in the newspapers,\nsupplementing from them my own experience of London society. The result\nis that I am more and more confirmed in the fears with which I have\nalready worried you. Two movements are plainly going on in the life of\nour day. The decay of religious belief is undermining morality, and the\nprogress of Radicalism in politics is working to the same end by\noverthrowing social distinctions. Evidence stares one in the face from\nevery column of the papers. Of course you have read more or less about\nthe recent \"scandal\"--I mean the _most_ recent.--It isn't the kind of\nthing one cares to discuss, but we can't help knowing about it, and\ndoes it not strongly support what I say? Here is materialism sinking\ninto brutal immorality, and high social rank degrading itself by\nintimacy with the corrupt vulgar. There are newspapers that make\npolitical capital out of these \"revelations\".\n\nI have read some of them, and they make me so _fiercely_ aristocratic\nthat I find it hard to care anything at all even for the humanitarian\nefforts of people I respect. You will tell me, I know, that this is\nquite the wrong way of looking at it. But the evils are so monstrous\nthat it is hard to fix one's mind on the good that may long hence\nresult from them.\n\n'I cling to the essential (that is the _spiritual_) truths of\nChristianity as the only absolute good left in our time. I would say\nthat I care nothing for forms, but some form there must be, else one's\nfaith evaporates. It has become very easy for me to understand how men\nand women who know the world refuse to believe any longer in a\ndirecting Providence. A week ago I again met Miss Moxey at the\nWalworths', and talked with her more freely than before. This\nconversation showed me that I have become much more tolerant towards\nindividuals. But though this or that person may be supported by moral\nsense alone, the world cannot dispense with religion. If it tries\nto--and it _will_--there are dreadful times before us.\n\n'I wish I were a man! I would do something, however ineffectual. I\nwould stand on the side of those who are fighting against mob-rule and\nmob-morals. How would you like to see Exeter Cathedral converted into a\n\"coffee music-hall\"? And that will come.'\n\nReading this, Sylvia had the sense of listening to an echo. Some of the\nphrases recalled to her quite a different voice from Sidwell's. She\nsmiled and mused.\n\nOn the morning appointed for her journey to Exeter Sidwell rose early,\nand in unusually good spirits. Mrs. Warricombe was less animated by the\nprospect of five hours in a railway carriage, for London had a covering\nof black snow, and it seemed likely that more would fall. Martin\nsuggested postponement, but circumstances made this undesirable.\n\n'Let Fanny go with me,' proposed Sidwell, just after breakfast. 'I can\nsee to everything perfectly well, mother.'\n\nBut Fanny hastened to decline. She was engaged for a dance on the\nmorrow.\n\n'Then I'll run down with you myself, Sidwell,' said her father.\n\nMrs. Warricombe looked at the weather and hesitated. There were strong\nreasons why she should go, and they determined her to brave discomforts.\n\nIt chanced that the morning post had brought Mr. Warricombe a letter\nfrom Godwin Peak. It was a reply to one that he had written with\nChristmas greetings; a kindness natural in him, for he had remembered\nthat the young man was probably hard at work in his lonely lodgings. He\nspoke of it privately to his wife.\n\n'A very good letter--thoughtful and cheerful. You're not likely to see\nhim, but if you happen to, say a pleasant word.'\n\n'I shouldn't have written, if I were you,' remarked Mrs. Warricombe.\n\n'Why not? I was only thinking the other day that he contrasted very\nfavourably with the younger generation as we observe it here. Yes, I\nhave faith in Peak. There's the right stuff in him.'\n\n'Oh, I daresay. But still'----\n\nAnd Mrs. Warricombe went away with an air of misgiving.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn volunteering a promise not to inform her brother of Peak's singular\nposition, Marcella spoke with sincerity. She was prompted by\nincongruous feelings--a desire to compel Godwin's gratitude, and\ndisdain of the circumstances in which she had discovered him. There\nseemed to be little likelihood of Christian's learning from any other\nperson that she had met with Peak at Budleigh Salterton; he had,\nindeed, dined with her at the Walworths', and might improve his\nacquaintance with that family, but it was improbable that they would\never mention in his hearing the stranger who had casually been\npresented to them, or indeed ever again think of him. If she held her\npeace, the secret of Godwin's retirement must still remain\nimpenetrable. He would pursue his ends as hitherto, thinking of _her_,\nif at all, as a weak woman who had immodestly betrayed a hopeless\npassion, and who could be trusted never to wish him harm.\n\nThat was Marcella's way of reading a man's thoughts. She did not\nattribute to Peak the penetration which would make him uneasy. In spite\nof masculine proverbs, it is the habit of women to suppose that the\nother sex regards them confidingly, ingenuously. Marcella was unusually\nendowed with analytic intelligence, but in this case she believed what\nshe hoped. She knew that Peak's confidence in her must be coloured with\ncontempt, but this mattered little so long as he paid her the\ncompliment of feeling sure that she was superior to ignoble\ntemptations. Many a woman would behave with treacherous malice. It was\nin her power to expose him, to confound all his schemes, for she knew\nthe authorship of that remarkable paper in _The Critical Review_.\nBefore receiving Peak's injunction of secrecy, Earwaker had talked of\n'The New Sophistry' with Moxey and with Malkin; the request came too\nlate. In her interview with Godwin at the Exeter hotel, she had not\neven hinted at this knowledge, partly because she was unconscious that\nPeak imagined the affair a secret between himself and Earwaker, partly\nbecause she thought it unworthy of her even to seem to threaten. It\ngratified her, however, to feel that he was at her mercy, and the\nthought preoccupied her for many days.\n\nPassion which has the intellect on its side is more easily endured than\nthat which offers sensual defiance to all reasoning, but on the other\nhand it lasts much longer. Marcella was not consumed by her emotions;\nshe often thought calmly, coldly, of the man she loved. Yet he was\nseldom long out of her mind, and the instigation of circumstances at\ntimes made her suffering intense. Such an occasion was her first\nmeeting with Sidwell Warricombe, which took place at the Walworths', in\nLondon. Down in Devonshire she had learnt that a family named\nWarricombe were Peak's intimate friends; nothing more than this, for\nindeed no one was in a position to tell her more. Wakeful jealousy\ncaused her to fix upon the fact as one of significance; Godwin's\nevasive manner when she questioned him confirmed her suspicions; and as\nsoon as she was brought face to face with Sidwell, suspicion became\ncertainty. She knew at once that Miss Warricombe was the very person\nwho would be supremely attractive to Godwin Peak.\n\nAn interval of weeks, and again she saw the face that in the meantime\nhad been as present to her imagination as Godwin's own features. This\ntime she conversed at some length with Miss Warricombe. Was it merely a\nfancy that the beautiful woman looked at her, spoke to her, with some\nexceptional interest? By now she had learnt that the Moorhouses and the\nWarricombes were connected in close friendship: it was all but certain,\nthen, that Miss Moorhouse had told Miss Warricombe of Peak's visit to\nBudleigh Salterton, and its incidents. Could this in any way be\nexplanatory of the steady, searching look in those soft eyes?\n\nMarcella had always regarded the emotion of jealousy as characteristic\nof a vulgar nature. Now that it possessed her, she endeavoured to call\nit by other names; to persuade herself that she was indignant on\nabstract grounds, or anxious only with reference to Peak's true\ninterests. She could not affect surprise. So intensely sympathetic was\nher reading of Godwin's character that she understood--or at all events\nrecognised--the power Sidwell would possess over him. He did not care\nfor enlightenment in a woman; he was sensual--though in a subtle way;\nthe aristocratic vein in his temper made him subject to strong\nimpressions from trivialities of personal demeanour, of social tone.\n\nYet all was mere conjecture. She had not dared to utter Peak's name,\nlest in doing so she should betray herself. Constantly planning to make\nfurther discoveries, she as constantly tried to dismiss all thought of\nthe matter--to learn indifference. Already she had debased herself, and\nher nature must be contemptible indeed if anything could lure her\nforward on such a path.\n\nNone the less, she was assiduous in maintaining friendly relations with\nthe Walworths. Christian, too, had got into the habit of calling there;\nit was significant of the noticeable change which was come upon him--a\nchange his sister was at no loss to understand from the moment that he\ninformed her (gravely, but without expressiveness) of Mr. Palmer's\ndeath. Instead of shunning ordinary society, he seemed bent on\nextending the circle of his acquaintance. He urged Marcella to invite\nfriendly calls, to have guests at dinner. There seemed to be a general\nrevival of his energies, exhibited in the sphere of study as well as of\namusement. Not a day went by without his purchasing books or scientific\napparatus, and the house was brightened with works of art chosen in the\nstudios which Miss Walworth advised him to visit. All the amiabilities\nof his character came into free play; with Marcella he was mirthful,\naffectionate, even caressing. He grew scrupulous about his neckties,\nhis gloves, and was careful to guard his fingers against corroding\nacids when he worked in the laboratory. Such indications of hopefulness\ncaused Marcella more misgiving than pleasure; she made no remark, but\nwaited with anxiety for some light on the course of events.\n\nJust before dinner, one evening, as she sat alone in the drawing-room,\nChristian entered with a look which portended some strange\nannouncement. He spoke abruptly:\n\n'I have heard something astonishing.'\n\n'What is that?'\n\n'This afternoon I went to the matinee at the Vaudeville, and found\nmyself among a lot of our friends--the Walworths and the Hunters and\nthe Mortons. Between the acts I was talking to Hunter, when a man came\nup to us, spoke to Hunter, and was introduced to me--a Mr Warricombe.\nWhat do you think he said? \"I believe you know my friend Peak, Mr.\nMoxey?\" \"Peak? To be sure! Can you tell me what has become of him?\" He\ngave me an odd look. \"Why, I met him last, some two months ago, in\nDevonshire.\" At that moment we were obliged to go to our places, and I\ncouldn't get hold of the fellow again. Hunter told me something about\nhim; he knows the Walworths, it seems--belongs to a good Devonshire\nfamily. What on earth can Peak be doing over there?'\n\nMarcella kept silence. The event she had judged improbable had come to\npass. The chance of its doing so had of course increased since\nChristian began to associate freely with the Walworths and their\ncircle. Yet, considering the slightness of the connection between that\ngroup of people and the Warricombe family, there had seemed no great\nlikelihood of Christian's getting acquainted with the latter. She\ndebated rapidly in her troubled mind how to meet this disclosure.\nCuriosity would, of course, impel her brother to follow up the clue; he\nwould again encounter Warricombe, and must then learn all the facts of\nPeak's position. To what purpose should she dissemble her own knowledge?\n\nDid she desire that Godwin should remain in security? A tremor more\nakin to gladness than its opposite impeded her utterance. If Warricombe\nbecame aware of all that was involved in Godwin Peak's withdrawal from\namong his friends--if (as must follow) he imparted the discovery to his\nsister----\n\nThe necessity of speaking enabled her to ignore these turbulent\nspeculations, which yet were anything but new to her.\n\n'They met at Budleigh Salterton,' she said, quietly.\n\n'Who did? Warricombe and Peak?'\n\n'Yes. At the Moorhouses'. It was when I was there.'\n\nChristian stared at her.\n\n'When you were there? But--_you_ met Peak?'\n\nHis sister smiled, turning from the astonished gaze.\n\n'Yes, I met him.'\n\n'But, why the deuce----? Why didn't you tell me, Marcella?'\n\n'He asked me not to speak of it. He didn't wish you to know that--that\nhe has decided to become a clergyman.'\n\nChristian was stricken dumb. In spite of his sister's obvious\nagitation, he could not believe what she told him; her smile gave him\nan excuse for supposing that she jested.\n\n'Peak a clergyman?' He burst out laughing. 'What's the meaning of all\nthis?--Do speak intelligibly! What's the fellow up to?'\n\n'I am quite serious. He is studying for Orders--has been for this last\nyear.'\n\nIn desperation, Christian turned to another phase of the subject.\n\n'Then Malkin _was_ mistaken?'\n\n'Plainly.'\n\n'And you mean to tell me that Peak----? Give me more details. Where's\nhe living? How has he got to know people like these Warricombes?'\n\nMarcella told all that she knew, and without injunction of secrecy. The\naffair had passed out of her hands; destiny must fulfil itself. And\nagain the tremor that resembled an uneasy joy went through her frame.\n\n'But how,' asked Christian, 'did this fellow Warricombe come to know\nthat _I_ was a friend of Peak's?'\n\n'That's a puzzle to me. I shouldn't have thought he would have\nremembered my name; and, even if he had, how could he conclude----'\n\nShe broke off, pondering. Warricombe must have made inquiries, possibly\nsuggested by suspicions.\n\n'I scarcely spoke of Mr. Peak to anyone,' she added. 'People saw, of\ncourse, that we were acquaintances, but it couldn't have seemed a thing\nof any importance.'\n\n'You spoke with him in private, it seems?'\n\n'Yes, I saw him for a few minutes--in Exeter.'\n\n'And you hadn't said anything to the Walworths that--that would\nsurprise them?'\n\n'Purposely not.--Why should I injure him?'\n\nChristian knit his brows. He understood too well why his sister should\nrefrain from such injury.\n\n'You would have behaved in the same way,' Marcella added.\n\n'Why really--yes, perhaps so. Yet I don't know.--In plain English, Peak\nis a wolf in sheep's clothing!'\n\n'I don't know anything about that,' she replied, with gloomy evasion.\n\n'Nonsense, my dear girl!--Had he the impudence to pretend to you that\nhe was sincere?'\n\n'He made no declaration.'\n\n'But you are convinced he is acting the hypocrite, Marcella. You spoke\nof the risk of injuring him.--What are his motives? What does he aim\nat?'\n\n'Scarcely a bishopric, I should think,' she replied, bitterly.\n\n'Then, by Jove! Earwaker may be right!'\n\nMarcella darted an inquiring look at him.\n\n'What has he thought?'\n\n'I'm ashamed to speak of it. He suggested once that Peak might disguise\nhimself for the sake of--of making a good marriage.'\n\nThe reply was a nervous laugh.\n\n'Look here, Marcella.' He caught her hand. 'This is a very awkward\nbusiness. Peak is disgracing himself; he will be unmasked; there'll be\na scandal. It was kind of you to keep silence--when don't you behave\nkindly, dear girl?--but think of the possible results to _us_. We shall\nbe something very like accomplices.'\n\n'How?' Marcella exclaimed, impatiently. 'Who need know that we were so\nintimate with him?'\n\n'Warricombe seems to know it.'\n\n'Who can prove that he isn't sincere?'\n\n'No one, perhaps. But it will seem a very odd thing that he hid away\nfrom all his old friends. You remember, I betrayed that to Warricombe,\nbefore I knew that it mattered.'\n\nYes, and Mr. Warricombe could hardly forget the circumstance. He would\npress his investigation--knowing already, perhaps, of Peak's approaches\nto his sister Sidwell.\n\n'Marcella, a man plays games like that at his own peril. I don't like\nthis kind of thing. Perhaps he has audacity enough to face out any\ndisclosure. But it's out of the question for you and me to nurse his\nsecret. We have no right to do so.'\n\n'You propose to denounce him?'\n\nMarcella gazed at her brother with an agitated look.\n\n'Not denounce. I am fond of Peak; I wish him well. But I can't join him\nin a dishonourable plot.--Then, we mustn't endanger our place in\nsociety.'\n\n'I have no place in society,' Marcella answered, coldly.\n\n'Don't say that, and don't think it. We are both going to make more of\nour lives; we are going to think very little of the past, and a great\ndeal of the future. We are still young; we have happiness before us.'\n\n'We?' she asked, with shaken voice.\n\n'Yes--both of us! Who can say'----\n\nAgain he took her hand and pressed it warmly in both his own. Just then\nthe door opened, and dinner was announced. Christian talked on, in low\nhurried tones, for several minutes, affectionately, encouragingly.\nAfter dinner, he wished to resume the subject, but Marcella declared\nthat there was no more to be said; he must act as honour and discretion\nbade him; for herself, she should simply keep silence as hitherto. And\nshe left him to his reflections.\n\nThough with so little of ascertained fact to guide her, Marcella\ninterpreted the hints afforded by her slight knowledge of the\nWarricombes with singular accuracy. Precisely as she had imagined,\nBuckland Warricombe was going about on Peak's track, learning all he\ncould concerning the theological student, forming acquaintance with\nanyone likely to supplement his discoveries. And less than a fortnight\nafter the meeting at the theatre, Christian made known to his sister\nthat Warricombe and he had had a second conversation, this time\nuninterrupted.\n\n'He inquired after you, Marcella, and--really I had no choice but to\nask him to call here. I hardly think he'll come. He's not the kind of\nman I care for--though liberal enough, and all that.'\n\n'Wasn't it rather rash to give that invitation?'\n\n'The fact was, I so dreaded the appearance of--of seeming to avoid\nhim,' Christian pleaded, awkwardly. 'You know, that affair--we won't\ntalk any more of it; but, if there _should_ be a row about it, you are\nsure to be compromised unless we have managed to guard ourselves. If\nWarricombe calls, we must talk about Peak without the least show of\nrestraint. Let it appear that we thought his choice of a profession\nunlikely, but not impossible. Happily, we needn't know anything about\nthat anonymous _Critical_ article.--Indeed, I think I have acted\nwisely.'\n\nMarcella murmured:\n\n'Yes, I suppose you have.'\n\n'And, by the way, I have spoken of it to Earwaker. Not of your part in\nthe story, of course. I told him that I had met a man who knew all\nabout Peak.--Impossible, you see, for me to keep silence with so\nintimate a friend.'\n\n'Then Mr. Earwaker will write to him?' said Marcella, reflectively.\n\n'I couldn't give him any address.'\n\n'How does Mr. Warricombe seem to regard Mr. Peak?'\n\n'With a good deal of interest, and of the friendliest kind. Naturally\nenough; they were College friends, as you know, before I had heard of\nPeak's existence.'\n\n'He has no suspicions?'\n\nChristian thought not, but her brother's judgment had not much weight\nwith Marcella.\n\nShe at once dreaded and desired Warricombe's appearance. If he thought\nit worth while to cultivate her acquaintance, she would henceforth have\nthe opportunity of studying Peak's relations with the Warricombes; on\nthe other hand, this was to expose herself to suffering and temptation\nfrom which the better part of her nature shrank with disdain. That she\nmight seem to have broken the promise voluntarily made to Godwin was a\nsmall matter; not so the risk of being overcome by an ignoble jealousy.\nShe had no overweening confidence in the steadfastness of her\nself-respect, if circumstances were all on the side of sensual impulse.\nAnd the longer she brooded on this peril, the more it allured her. For\ntherewith was connected the one satisfaction which still remained to\nher: however little he desired to keep her constantly in mind, Godwin\nPeak must of necessity do so after what had passed between them. Had\nbut her discovery remained her own secret, then the pleasure of\ncommanding her less pure emotions, of proving to Godwin that she was\nabove the weakness of common women, might easily have prevailed. Now\nthat her knowledge was shared by others, she had lost that safeguard\nagainst lower motive. The argument that to unmask hypocrisy was in\nitself laudable she dismissed with contempt; let that be the resource\nof a woman who would indulge her rancour whilst keeping up the inward\npretence of sanctity. If _she_ erred in the ways characteristic of her\nsex, it should at all events be a conscious degradation.\n\n'Have you seen that odd creature Malkin lately?' she asked of\nChristian, a day or two after.\n\n'No, I haven't; I thought of him to make up our dinner on Sunday; but\nyou had rather not have him here, I daresay?'\n\n'Oh, he is amusing. Ask him by all means,' said Marcella, carelessly.\n\n'He may have heard about Peak from Earwaker, you know. If he begins to\ntalk before people'----\n\n'Things have gone too far for such considerations,' replied his sister,\nwith a petulance strange to her habits of speech.\n\n'Well, yes,' admitted Christian, glancing at her. 'We can't be\nresponsible.'\n\nHe reproached himself for this attitude towards Peak, but was heartily\nglad that Marcella seemed to have learnt to regard the intriguer with a\nwholesome indifference.\n\nOn the second day after Christmas, as they sat talking idly in the\ndusking twilight, the door of the drawing-room was thrown open, and a\nvisitor announced. The name answered with such startling suddenness to\nthe thought with which Marcella had been occupied that, for an instant,\nshe could not believe that she had heard aright. Yet it was undoubtedly\nMr. Warricombe who presented himself. He came forward with a slightly\nhesitating air, but Christian made haste to smooth the situation. With\nthe help of those commonplaces by which even intellectual people are at\ntimes compelled to prove their familiarity with social usages,\nconversation was set in movement.\n\nBuckland could not be quite himself. The consciousness that he had\nsought these people not at all for their own sake made him formal and\ndry; his glances, his half-smile, indicated a doubt whether the Moxeys\nbelonged entirely to the sphere in which he was at home. Hence a rather\nexcessive politeness, such as the man who sets much store on breeding\nexhibits to those who may at any moment, even in a fraction of a\nsyllable, prove themselves his inferiors. With men and women of the\nunmistakably lower orders, Buckland could converse in a genial tone\nthat recommended him to their esteem; on the borderland of refinement,\nhis sympathies were repressed, and he held the distinctive part of his\nmind in reserve.\n\nMarcella desired to talk agreeably, but a weight lay upon her tongue;\nshe was struck with the resemblance in Warricombe's features to those\nof his sister, and this held her in a troubled preoccupation,\noccasionally evident when she made a reply, or tried to diversify the\ntalk by leading to a new topic. It was rather early in the afternoon,\nand she had slight hope that any other caller would appear; a female\nface would have been welcome to her, even that of foolish Mrs. Morton,\nwho might possibly look in before six o'clock. To her relief the door\ndid presently open, but the sharp, creaking footstep which followed was\nno lady's; the servant announced Mr. Malkin.\n\nMarcella's eyes gleamed strangely. Not with the light of friendly\nwelcome, though for that it could be mistaken. She rose quietly, and\nstepped forward with a movement which again seemed to betoken eagerness\nof greeting. In presenting the newcomer to Mr. Warricombe, she spoke\nwith an uncertain voice. Buckland was more than formal. The stranger's\naspect impressed him far from favourably, and he resented as an\nimpudence the hearty hand-grip to which he perforce submitted.\n\n'I come to plead with you,' exclaimed Malkin, turning to Marcella, in\nhis abrupt, excited way. 'After accepting your invitation to dine, I\nfind that the thing is utterly and absolutely impossible. I had\nentirely forgotten an engagement of the very gravest nature. I am\nconscious of behaving in quite an unpardonable way.'\n\nMarcella laughed down his excuses. She had suddenly become so mirthful\nthat Christian looked at her in surprise, imagining that she was unable\nto restrain her sense of the ridiculous in Malkin's demeanour.\n\n'I have hurried up from Wrotham,' pursued the apologist. 'Did I tell\nyou, Moxey, that I had taken rooms down there, to be able to spend a\nday or two near my friends the Jacoxes occasionally? On the way here, I\nlooked in at Staple Inn, but Earwaker is away somewhere. What an odd\nthing that people will go off without letting one know! It's such\ncommon ill-luck of mine to find people gone away--I'm really astonished\nto find you at home, Miss Moxey.'\n\nMarcella looked at Warricombe and laughed.\n\n'You must understand that subjectively,' she said, with nervous gaiety\nwhich again excited her brother's surprise. 'Please don't be\ndiscouraged by it from coming to see us again; I am very rarely out in\nthe afternoon.'\n\n'But,' persisted Malkin, 'it's precisely my ill fortune to hit on those\nrare moments when people _are_ out!--Now, I never meet acquaintances in\nthe streets of London; but, if I happen to be abroad, as likely as not\nI encounter the last person I should expect to find. Why, you remember,\nI rush over to America for scarcely a week's stay, and there I come\nacross a man who has disappeared astonishingly from the ken of all his\nfriends!'\n\nChristian looked at Marcella. She was leaning forward, her lips\nslightly parted, her eyes wide as if in gaze at something that\nfascinated her. He saw that she spoke, but her voice was hardly to be\nrecognised.\n\n'Are you quite sure of that instance, Mr. Malkin?'\n\n'Yes, I feel quite sure, Miss Moxey. Undoubtedly it was Peak!'\n\nBuckland Warricombe, who had been waiting for a chance of escape,\nsuddenly wore a look of interest. He rapidly surveyed the trio.\nChristian, somewhat out of countenance, tried to answer Malkin in a\ntone of light banter.\n\n'It happens, my dear fellow, that Peak has not left England since we\nlost sight of him.'\n\n'What? He has been heard of? Where is he then?'\n\n'Mr. Warricombe can assure you that he has been living for a year at\nExeter.'\n\nBuckland, perceiving that he had at length come upon something\nimportant to his purposes, smiled genially.\n\n'Yes, I have had the pleasure of seeing Peak down in Devon from time to\ntime.'\n\n'Then it was really an illusion!' cried Malkin. 'I was too hasty. Yet\nthat isn't a charge that can be often brought against me, I think. Does\nEarwaker know of this?'\n\n'He has lately heard,' replied Christian, who in vain sought for a\nmeans of checking Malkin's loquacity. 'I thought he might have told\nyou.'\n\n'Certainly not. The thing is quite new to me. And what is Peak doing\ndown there, pray? Why did he conceal himself?'\n\nChristian gazed appealingly at his sister. She returned the look\nsteadily, but neither stirred nor spoke. It was Warricombe's voice that\nnext sounded:\n\n'Peak's behaviour seems mysterious,' he began, with ironic gravity. 'I\ndon't pretend to understand him. What's your view of his character, Mr.\nMalkin?'\n\n'I know him very slightly indeed, Mr. Warricombe. But I have a high\nopinion of his powers. I wonder he does so little. After that article\nof his in _The Critical_'----\n\nMalkin became aware of something like agonised entreaty on Christian's\ncountenance, but this had merely the effect of heightening his\ncuriosity.\n\n'In _The Critical_?' said Warricombe, eagerly. 'I didn't know of that.\nWhat was the subject?'\n\n'To be sure, it was anonymous,' went on Malkin, without a suspicion of\nthe part he was playing before these three excited people. 'A paper\ncalled \"The New Sophistry\", a tremendous bit of satire.'\n\nMarcella's eyes closed as if a light had flashed before them; she drew\na short sigh, and at once seemed to become quite at ease, the smile\nwith which she regarded Warricombe expressing a calm interest.\n\n'That article was Peak's?' Buckland asked, in a very quiet voice.\n\nChristian at last found his opportunity.\n\n'He never mentioned it to you? Perhaps he thought he had gone rather\ntoo far in his Broad Churchism, and might be misunderstood.'\n\n'Broad Churchism?' cried Malkin. 'Uncommonly broad, I must say!'\n\nAnd he laughed heartily; Marcella seemed to join in his mirth.\n\n'Then it would surprise you,' said Buckland, in the same quiet tone as\nbefore, 'to hear that Peak is about to take Orders?'\n\n'Orders?--For what?'\n\nChristian laughed. The worst was over; after all, it came as a relief.\n\n'Not for wines,' he replied. 'Mr. Warricombe means that Peak is going\nto be ordained.'\n\nMalkin's amazement rendered him speechless. He stared from one person\nto another, his features strangely distorted.\n\n'You can hardly believe it?' pressed Buckland.\n\nThe reply was anticipated by Christian saying:\n\n'Remember, Malkin, that you had no opportunity of studying Peak. It's\nnot so easy to understand him.'\n\n'But I don't see,' burst out the other, 'how I could possibly so\n_mis_understand him! What has Earwaker to say?'\n\nBuckland rose from his seat, advanced to Marcella, and offered his\nhand. She said mechanically, 'Must you go?' but was incapable of\nanother word. Christian came to her relief, performed the needful\ncivilities, and accompanied his acquaintance to the foot of the stairs.\nBuckland had become grave, stiff, monosyllabic; Christian made no\nallusion to the scene thus suddenly interrupted, and they parted with a\nformal air.\n\nMalkin remained for another quarter of an hour, when the muteness of\nhis companions made it plain to him that he had better withdraw. He\nwent off with a sense of having been mystified, half resentful, and\nvastly impatient to see Earwaker.\n\n\n\n\nPart V\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe cuckoo clock in Mrs. Roots's kitchen had just struck three. A wind\nroared from the north-east, and light thickened beneath a sky which\nmade threat of snow. Peak was in a mood to enjoy the crackling fire; he\nsettled himself with a book in his easy-chair, and thought with\npleasure of two hours' reading, before the appearance of the homely\nteapot.\n\nChristmas was just over--one cause of the feeling of relief and\nquietness which possessed him. No one had invited him for Christmas Eve\nor the day that followed, and he did not regret it. The letter he had\nreceived from Martin Warricombe was assurance enough that those he\ndesired to remember him still did so. He had thought of using this\nseason for his long postponed visit to Twybridge, but reluctance\nprevailed. All popular holidays irritated and depressed him; he loathed\nthe spectacle of multitudes in Sunday garb. It was all over, and the\nsense of that afforded him a brief content.\n\nThis book, which he had just brought from the circulating library, was\naltogether to his taste. The author, Justin Walsh, he knew to be a\nbrother of Professor Walsh, long ago the object of his rebellious\nadmiration. Matter and treatment rejoiced him. No intellectual delight,\nthough he was capable of it in many forms, so stirred his spirit as\nthat afforded him by a vigorous modern writer joyously assailing the\nold moralities. Justin Walsh was a modern of the moderns; at once man\nof science and man of letters; defiant without a hint of popular\ncynicism, scornful of English reticences yet never gross. '_Oui,\nrepondit Pococurante, il est beau d'ecrire ce qu 'on pense; c'est le\nprivilege de l'homme_.' This stood by way of motto on the title-page,\nand Godwin felt his nerves thrill in sympathetic response.\n\nWhat a fine fellow he must be to have for a friend! Now a man like this\nsurely had companionship enough and of the kind he wished? He wrote\nlike one who associates freely with the educated classes both at home\nand abroad. Was he married? Where would _he_ seek his wife? The fitting\nmate for him would doubtless be found among those women, cosmopolitan\nand emancipated, whose acquaintance falls only to men in easy\ncircumstances and of good social standing, men who travel much, who are\nat home in all the great centres of civilisation.\n\nAs Peak meditated, the volume fell upon his knee. Had it not lain in\nhis own power to win a reputation like that which Justin Walsh was\nachieving? His paper in _The Critical Review_, itself a decided\nsuccess, might have been followed up by others of the same tenor.\nInstead of mouldering in a dull cathedral town, he might now be living\nand working in France or Germany. His money would have served one\npurpose as well as the other, and two or three years of determined\neffort----\n\nMrs. Roots showed her face at the door.\n\n'A gentleman is asking for you, sir,--Mr. Chilvers.'\n\n'Mr. Chilvers? Please ask him to come up.'\n\nHe threw his book on to the table, and stood in expectancy. Someone\nascended the stairs with rapid stride and creaking boots. The door was\nflung open, and a cordial but affected voice burst forth in greeting.\n\n'Ha, Mr. Peak! I hope you haven't altogether forgotten me? Delighted to\nsee you again!'\n\nGodwin gave his hand, and felt it strongly pressed, whilst Chilvers\ngazed into his face with a smiling wistfulness which could only be\nanswered with a grin of discomfort. The Rev. Bruno had grown very tall,\nand seemed to be in perfect health; but the effeminacy of his brilliant\nyouth still declared itself in his attitudes, gestures, and attire. He\nwas dressed with marked avoidance of the professional pattern. A hat of\nsoft felt but not clerical, fashionable collar and tie, a sweeping\nulster, and beneath it a frock-coat, which was doubtless the pride of\nsome West End tailor. His patent-leather boots were dandiacally\ndiminutive; his glove fitted like that of a lady who lives but to be\n_bien gantee_. The feathery hair, which at Whitelaw he was wont to pat\nand smooth, still had its golden shimmer, and on his face no growth was\npermitted.\n\n'I had heard of your arrival here, of course,' said Peak, trying to\nappear civil, though anything more than that was beyond his power.\n'Will you sit down?'\n\n'This is the \"breathing time o' the day\" with you, I hope? I don't\ndisturb your work?'\n\n'I was only reading this book of Walsh's. Do you know it?'\n\nBut for some such relief of his feelings, Godwin could not have sat\nstill. There was a pleasure in uttering Walsh's name. Moreover, it\nwould serve as a test of Chilvers' disposition.\n\n'Walsh?' He took up the volume. 'Ha! Justin Walsh. I know him. A\nwonderful book! Admirable dialectic! Delicious style!'\n\n'Not quite orthodox, I fancy,' replied Godwin, with a curling of the\nlips.\n\n'Orthodox? Oh, of course not, of course not! But a rich vein of\nhumanity. Don't you find that?--Pray allow me to throw off my overcoat.\nHa, thanks!--A rich vein of humanity. Walsh is by no means to be\nconfused with the nullifidians. A very broad-hearted, large-souled man;\nat bottom the truest of Christians. Now and then he effervesces rather\ntoo exuberantly. Yes, I admit it. In a review of his last book, which I\nwas privileged to write for one of our papers, I ventured to urge upon\nhim the necessity of _restraint_; it seems to me that in this new work\nhe exhibits more self-control, an approach to the serene fortitude\nwhich I trust he may attain. A man of the broadest brotherliness. A\nmost valuable ally of renascent Christianity.'\n\nPeak was hardly prepared for this strain. He knew that Chilvers prided\nhimself on 'breadth', but as yet he had enjoyed no intercourse with the\nbroadest school of Anglicans, and was uncertain as to the limits of\nmodern latitudinarianism. The discovery of such fantastic liberality in\na man whom he could not but dislike and contemn gave him no pleasure,\nbut at least it disposed him to amusement rather than antagonism.\nChilvers' pronunciation and phraseology were distinguished by such\noriginal affectation that it was impossible not to find entertainment\nin listening to him. Though his voice was naturally thin and piping, he\nmanaged to speak in head notes which had a ring of robust utterance.\nThe sound of his words was intended to correspond with their virile\nwarmth of meaning. In the same way he had cultivated a habit of the\nmuscles which conveyed an impression that he was devoted to athletic\nsports. His arms occasionally swung as if brandishing dumb-bells, his\nchest now and then spread itself to the uttermost, and his head was\noften thrown back in an attitude suggesting self-defence.\n\n'So you are about to join us,' he exclaimed, with a look of touching\ninterest, much like that of a ladies' doctor speaking delicately of\nfavourable symptoms. Then, as if consciously returning to the virile\nnote, 'I think we shall understand each other. I am always eager to\nstudy the opinions of those among us who have scientific minds. I hear\nof you on all hands; already you have strongly impressed some of the\nthinking people in Exeter.'\n\nPeak crossed his legs and made no reply.\n\n'There is distinct need of an infusion of the scientific spirit into\nthe work of the Church. The churchman hitherto has been, as a matter of\ncourse, of the literary stamp; hence much of our trouble during the\nlast half-century. It behoves us to go in for science--physical,\neconomic--science of every kind. Only thus can we resist the morbific\ninfluences which inevitably beset an Established Church in times such\nas these. I say it boldly. Let us throw aside our Hebrew and our Greek,\nour commentators ancient and modern! Let us have done with polemics and\nwith compromises! What we have to do is to construct a spiritual\nedifice on the basis of scientific revelation. I use the word\nrevelation advisedly. The results of science are the divine message to\nour age; to neglect them, to fear them, is to remain under the old law\nwhilst the new is demanding our adherence, to repeat the Jewish error\nof bygone time. Less of St Paul, and more of Darwin! Less of Luther,\nand more of Herbert Spencer!'\n\n'Shall I have the pleasure of hearing this doctrine at St Margaret's?'\nPeak inquired.\n\n'In a form suitable to the intelligence of my parishioners, taken in\nthe mass. Were my hands perfectly free, I should begin by preaching a\nseries of sermons on _The Origin of species_. Sermons! An obnoxious\nword! One ought never to use it. It signifies everything inept, inert.'\n\n'Is it your serious belief, then, that the mass of parishioners here or\nelsewhere--are ready for this form of spiritual instruction?'\n\n'Most distinctly--given the true capacity in the teacher. Mark me; I\ndon't say that they are capable of receiving much absolute knowledge.\nWhat I desire is that their minds shall be relieved from a state of\nharassing conflict--put at the right point of view. They are not to\nthink that Jesus of Nazareth teaches faith and conduct incompatible\nwith the doctrines of Evolutionism. They are not to spend their lives\nin kicking against the pricks, and regard as meritorious the punctures\nwhich result to them. The establishment in their minds of a few\ncardinal facts--that is the first step. Then let the interpretation\nfollow--the solace, the encouragement, the hope for eternity!'\n\n'You imagine,' said Godwin, with a calm air, 'that the mind of the\naverage church-goer is seriously disturbed on questions of faith?'\n\n'How can you ignore it, my dear Peak?--Permit me this familiarity; we\nare old fellow-collegians.--The average churchgoer is the average\ncitizen of our English commonwealth,--a man necessarily aware of the\ngreat Radical movement, and all that it involves. Forgive me. There has\nbeen far too much blinking of actualities by zealous Christians whose\nfaith is rooted in knowledge. We gain nothing by it; we lose immensely.\nLet us recognise that our churches are filled with sceptics,\nendeavouring to believe in spite of themselves.'\n\n'Your experience is much larger than mine,' remarked the listener,\nsubmissively.\n\n'Indeed I have widely studied the subject.'\n\nChilvers smiled with ineffable self-content, his head twisted like that\nof a sagacious parrot.\n\n'Granting your average citizen,' said the other, 'what about the\naverage citizeness? The female church-goers are not insignificant in\nnumber.'\n\n'Ha! There we reach the core of the matter! Woman! woman! Precisely\n_there_ is the most hopeful outlook. I trust you are strong for female\nemancipation?'\n\n'Oh, perfectly sound on that question!'\n\n'To be sure! Then it must be obvious to you that women are destined to\nplay the leading part in our Christian renascence, precisely as they\ndid in the original spreading of the faith. What else is the meaning of\nthe vast activity in female education? Let them be taught, and\nforthwith they will rally to our Broad Church. A man may be content to\nremain a nullifidian; women cannot rest at that stage. They demand the\nspiritual significance of everything.--I grieve to tell you, Peak, that\nfor three years I have been a widower. My wife died with shocking\nsuddenness, leaving me her two little children. Ah, but leaving me also\nthe memory of a singularly pure and noble being. I may say, with all\nhumility, that I have studied the female mind in its noblest modern\ntype. I _know_ what can be expected of woman, in our day and in the\nfuture.'\n\n'Mrs. Chilvers was in full sympathy with your views?'\n\n'Three years ago I had not yet reached my present standpoint. In\nseveral directions I was still narrow. But her prime characteristic was\nthe tendency to spiritual growth. She would have accompanied me step by\nstep. In very many respects I must regard myself as a man favoured by\nfortune,--I know it, and I trust I am grateful for it,--but that loss,\nmy dear Peak, counterbalances much happiness. In moments of repose,\nwhen I look back on work joyously achieved, I often murmur to myself,\nwith a sudden sigh, _Excepto quod non simul esses, caetera Iaetus_!'\n\nHe pronounced his Latin in the new-old way, with Continental vowels.\nThe effect of this on an Englishman's lips is always more or less\npedantic, and in his case it was intolerable.\n\n'And when,' he exclaimed, dismissing the melancholy thought, 'do you\npresent yourself for ordination?'\n\nIt was his habit to pay slight attention to the words of anyone but\nhimself, and Peak's careless answer merely led him to talk on wide\nsubjects with renewal of energy. One might have suspected that he had\nmade a list of uncommon words wherewith to adorn his discourse, for\ncertain of these frequently recurred. 'Nullifidian', 'morbific',\n'renascent', were among his favourites. Once or twice he spoke of\n'psychogenesis', with an emphatic enunciation which seemed to invite\nrespectful wonder. In using Latin words which have become fixed in the\nEnglish language, he generally corrected the common errors of quantity:\n'_minnus_ the spiritual fervour', 'acting as his _loccum tennens_'.\nWhen he referred to Christian teachers with whom he was acquainted,\nthey were seldom or never members of the Church of England. Methodists,\nRomanists, Presbyterians appeared to stand high in his favour, and Peak\nreadily discerned that this was a way of displaying 'large-souled\ntolerance'. It was his foible to quote foreign languages, especially\npassages which came from heretical authors. Thus, he began to talk of\nFeuerbach for the sole purpose of delivering a German sentence.\n\n'He has been of infinite value to me--quite infinite value. You\nremember his definition of God? It is constantly in my mind. \"_Gott ist\neine Trane der Liebe, in tiefster Verborgenheit vergossen uber das\nmenschliche Elend_.\" Profoundly touching! I know nothing to approach\nit.'\n\nSuddenly he inquired:\n\n'Do you see much of the Exeter clergy?'\n\n'I know only the Vicar of St. Ethelreda's, Mr. Lilywhite.'\n\n'Ha! Admirable fellow! Large-minded, broad of sympathies. Has\ndistinctly the scientific turn of thought.'\n\nPeak smiled, knowing the truth. But he had hit upon a way of meeting\nthe Rev. Bruno which promised greatly to diminish the suffering\ninherent in the situation. He would use the large-souled man\ndeliberately for his mirth. Chilvers's self-absorption lent itself to\npersiflage, and by indulging in that mood Godwin tasted some\ncompensation for the part he had to play.\n\n'And I believe you know the Warricombes very well?' pursued Chilvers.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Ha! I hope to see much of them. They are people after my own heart.\nLong ago I had a slight acquaintance with them. I hear we shan't see\nthem till the summer.'\n\n'I believe not.'\n\n'Mr. Warricombe is a great geologist, I think?--Probably he frequents\npublic worship as a mere tribute to social opinion?'\n\nHe asked the question in the airiest possible way, as if it mattered\nnothing to him what the reply might be.\n\n'Mr. Warricombe is a man of sincere piety,' Godwin answered, with grave\ncountenance.\n\n'That by no means necessitates church-going, my dear Peak,' rejoined\nthe other, waving his hand.\n\n'You think not? I am still only a student, you must remember. My mind\nis in suspense on not a few points.'\n\n'Of course! Of course! Pray let me give you the results of my own\nthought on this subject.'\n\nHe proceeded to do so, at some length. When he had rounded his last\nperiod, he unexpectedly started up, swung on his toes, spread his\nchest, drew a deep breath, and with the sweetest of smiles announced\nthat he must postpone the delight of further conversation.\n\n'You must come and dine with me as soon as my house is in reasonable\norder. As yet, everything is _sens dessus-dessous_. Delightful old\ncity, Exeter! Charming! Charming!'\n\nAnd on the moment he was gone.\n\nWhat were this man's real opinions? He had brains and literature; his\npose before the world was not that of an ignorant charlatan. Vanity, no\ndoubt, was his prime motive, but did it operate to make a cleric of a\nsecret materialist, or to incite a display of excessive liberalism in\none whose convictions were orthodox? Godwin could not answer to his\nsatisfaction, but he preferred the latter surmise.\n\nOne thing, however, became clear to him. All his conscientious scruples\nabout entering the Church were superfluous. Chilvers would have smiled\npityingly at anyone who disputed his right to live by the\nEstablishment, and to stand up as an authorised preacher of the\nnational faith. And beyond a doubt he regulated his degree of 'breadth'\nby standards familiar to him in professional intercourse. To him it\nseemed all-sufficient to preach a gospel of moral progress, of\nintellectual growth, of universal fraternity. If this were the tendency\nof Anglicanism, then almost any man who desired to live a cleanly life,\nand to see others do the same, might without hesitation become a\nclergyman. The old formulae of subscription were so symbolised, so\nvolatilised, that they could not stand in the way of anyone but a\ncombative nihilist. Peak was conscious of positive ideals by no means\ninconsistent with Christian teaching, and in his official capacity\nthese alone would direct him.\n\nHe spent his evening pleasantly, often laughing as he recalled a phrase\nor gesture of the Rev. Bruno's.\n\nIn the night fell a sprinkling of snow, and when the sun rose it\ngleamed from a sky of pale, frosty blue. At ten o'clock Godwin set out\nfor his usual walk, choosing the direction of the Old Tiverton Road. It\nwas a fortnight since he had passed the Warricombes' house. At present\nhe was disposed to indulge the thoughts which a sight of it would make\nactive.\n\nHe had begun the ascent of the hill when the sound of an approaching\nvehicle caused him to raise his eyes--they were generally fixed on the\nground when he walked alone. It was only a hired fly. But, as it passed\nhim, he recognised the face he had least expected to see,--Sidwell\nWarricombe sat in the carriage, and unaccompanied. She noticed\nhim--smiled--and bent forward. He clutched at his hat, but it happened\nthat the driver had turned to look at him, and, instead of the salute\nhe had intended, his hand waved to the man to stop. The gesture was\nscarcely voluntary; when he saw the carriage pull up, his heart sank;\nhe felt guilty of monstrous impudence. But Sidwell's face appeared at\nthe window, and its expression was anything but resentful; she offered\nher hand, too. Without preface of formal phrase he exclaimed:\n\n'How delightful to see you so unexpectedly! Are you all here?'\n\n'Only mother and I. We have come for a day or two.'\n\n'Will you allow me to call? If only for a few minutes'----\n\n'We shall be at home this afternoon.'\n\n'Thank you! Don't you enjoy the sunshine after London?'\n\n'Indeed I do!'\n\nHe stepped back and signed to the driver. Sidwell bent her head and was\nout of sight.\n\nBut the carriage was visible for some distance, and even when he could\nno longer see it he heard the horse's hoofs on the hard road. Long\nafter the last sound had died away his heart continued to beat\npainfully, and he breathed as if recovering from a hard run.\n\nHow beautiful were these lanes and hills, even in mid-winter! Once more\nhe sang aloud in his joyous solitude. The hope he had nourished was not\nunreasonable; his boldness justified itself. Yes, he was one of the men\nwho succeed, and the life before him would be richer for all the\nmistakes and miseries through which he had passed. Thirty, forty,\nfifty--why, twenty years hence he would be in the prime of manhood,\nwith perhaps yet another twenty years of mental and bodily vigour. One\nof the men who succeed!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nOn the morning after her journey down from London, Mrs. Warricombe\nawoke with the conviction that she had caught a cold. Her health was in\ngeneral excellent, and she had no disposition to nurse imaginary\nailments, but when some slight disorder broke the routine of her life\nshe made the most of it, enjoying--much as children do--the importance\nwith which for the time it invested her. At such seasons she was wont\nto regard herself with a mildly despondent compassion, to feel that her\nfamily and her friends held her of slight account; she spoke in a tone\nof conscious resignation, often with a forgiving smile. When the girls\nredoubled their attentions, and soothed her with gentle words, she\nwould close her eyes and sigh, seeming to remind them that they would\nknow her value when she was no more.\n\n'You are hoarse, mother,' Sidwell said to her, when they met at\nbreakfast.\n\n'Am I, dear? You know I felt rather afraid of the journey. I hope I\nshan't be laid up.'\n\nSidwell advised her not to leave the house to-day. Having seen the\ninvalid comfortably established in an upper room, she went into the\ncity on business which could not be delayed. On her way occurred the\nmeeting with Peak, but of this, on her return, she made no mention.\nMother and daughter had luncheon upstairs, and Sidwell was full of\naffectionate solicitude.\n\n'This afternoon you had better lie down for an hour or two,' she said.\n\n'Do you think so? Just drop a line to father, and warn him that we may\nkept here for some time.'\n\n'Shall I send for Dr Endacott?'\n\n'Just as you like, dear.'\n\nBut Mrs. Warricombe had eaten such an excellent lunch, that Sidwell\ncould not feel uneasy.\n\n'We'll see how you are this evening. At all events, it will be safer\nfor you not to go downstairs. If you lie quiet for an hour or two, I\ncan look for those pamphlets that father wants.'\n\n'Just as you like, dear.'\n\nBy three o'clock the invalid was calmly slumbering. Having entered the\nbedroom on tiptoe and heard regular breathing, Sidwell went down and\nfor a few minutes lingered about the hall. A servant came to her for\ninstructions on some domestic matter; when this was dismissed she\nmentioned that, if anyone called, she would be found in the library.\n\nThe pamphlets of which her father had spoken were soon discovered. She\nlaid them aside, and seated herself by the fire, but without leaning\nback. At any sound within or outside the house she moved her head to\nlisten. Her look was anxious, but the gleam of her eyes expressed\npleasurable agitation.\n\nAt half-past three she went into the drawing-room, where all the\nfurniture was draped, and the floor bare. Standing where she could look\nfrom a distance through one of the windows, at which the blind had been\nraised, she waited for a quarter of an hour. Then the chill atmosphere\ndrove her back to the fireside. In the study, evidences of temporary\ndesertion were less oppressive, but the windows looked only upon a\nsequestered part of the garden. Sidwell desired to watch the approach\nfrom the high-road, and in a few minutes she was again in the\ndrawing-room. But scarcely had she closed the door behind her when a\nringing of the visitors' bell sounded with unfamiliar distinctness. She\nstarted, hastened from the room, fled into the library, and had time to\nseat herself before she heard the footsteps of a servant moving in\nanswer to the summons.\n\nThe door opened, and Peak was announced.\n\nSidwell had never known what it was to be thus overcome with emotion.\nShame at her inability to command the calm features with which she\nwould naturally receive a caller flushed her cheeks and neck; she\nstepped forward with downcast eyes, and only in offering her hand could\nat length look at him who stood before her. She saw at once that Peak\nwas unlike himself; he too had unusual warmth in his countenance, and\nhis eyes seemed strangely large, luminous. On his forehead were drops\nof moisture.\n\nThis sight restored her self-control, or such measure of it as\npermitted her to speak in the conventional way.\n\n'I am sorry that mother can't leave her room. She had a slight cold\nthis morning, but I didn't think it would give her any trouble.'\n\nPeak was delighted, and betrayed the feeling even whilst he constrained\nhis face into a look of exaggerated anxiety.\n\n'It won't be anything serious, I hope? The railway journey, I'm afraid.'\n\n'Yes, the journey. She has a slight hoarseness, but I think we shall\nprevent it from'----\n\nTheir eyes kept meeting, and with more steadfastness. They were\nconscious of mutual scrutiny, and, on both sides, of changes since they\nlast met. When two people have devoted intense study to each other's\nfeatures, a three months' absence not only revives the old impressions\nbut subjects them to sudden modification which engrosses thought and\nfeeling. Sidwell continued to utter commonplaces, simply as a means of\ndisguising the thoughts that occupied her; she was saying to herself\nthat Peak's face had a purer outline than she had believed, and that\nhis eyes had gained in expressiveness. In the same way Godwin said and\nreplied he knew not what, just to give himself time to observe and\nenjoy the something new--the increased animation or subtler facial\nmovements--which struck him as often as he looked at his companion.\nEach wondered what the other had been doing, whether the time had\nseemed long or short.\n\n'I hope you have kept well?' Sidwell asked.\n\nGodwin hastened to respond with civil inquiries.\n\n'I was very glad to hear from Mr. Warricombe a few days ago, he\ncontinued. Sidwell was not aware that her father had written, but her\npleased smile seemed to signify the contrary.\n\n'She looks younger,' Peak said in his mind. 'Perhaps that London dress\nand the new way of arranging her hair have something to do with it. But\nno, she looks younger in herself. She must have been enjoying the\npleasures of town.'\n\n'You have been constantly occupied, no doubt,' he added aloud, feeling\nat the same time that this was a clumsy expression of what he meant.\nThough he had unbuttoned his overcoat, and seated himself as easily as\nhe could, the absurd tall hat which he held embarrassed him; to deposit\nit on the floor demanded an effort of which he was yet incapable.\n\n'I have seen many things and heard much talk,' Sidwell was replying, in\na gay tone. It irritated him; he would have preferred her to speak with\nmore of the old pensiveness. Yet perhaps she was glad simply because\nshe found herself again talking with him?\n\n'And you?' she went on. 'It has not been all work, I hope?'\n\n'Oh no! I have had many pleasant intervals.'\n\nThis was in imitation of her vivacity. He felt the words and the manner\nto be ridiculous, but could not restrain himself. Every moment\nincreased his uneasiness; the hat weighed in his hands like a lump of\nlead, and he was convinced that he had never looked so clownish. Did\nher smile signify criticism of his attitude?\n\nWith a decision which came he knew not how, he let his hat drop to the\nfloor and pushed it aside. There, that was better; he felt less of a\nbumpkin.\n\nSidwell glanced at the glossy grotesque, but instantly averted her\neyes, and asked rather more gravely:\n\n'Have you been in Exeter all the time?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'But you didn't spend your Christmas alone, I hope?'\n\n'Oh, I had my books.'\n\nWas there not a touch of natural pathos in this? He hoped so; then\nmocked at himself for calculating such effects.\n\n'I think you don't care much for ordinary social pleasures, Mr Peak?'\n\nHe smiled bitterly.\n\n'I have never known much of them,--and you remember that I look forward\nto a life in which they will have little part. Such a life,' he\ncontinued, after a pause, 'seems to you unendurably dull? I noticed\nthat, when I spoke of it before.'\n\n'You misunderstood me.' She said it so undecidedly that he gazed at her\nwith puzzled look. Her eyes fell.\n\n'But you like society?'\n\n'If you use the word in its narrowest meaning,' she answered, 'then I\nnot only dislike society, but despise it.'\n\nShe had raised her eyebrows, and was looking coldly at him. Did she\nmean to rebuke him for the tone he had adopted? Indeed, he seemed to\nhimself presumptuous. But if they were still on terms such as these,\nwas it not better to know it, even at the cost of humiliation? One\nmoment he believed that he could read Sidwell's thoughts, and that they\nwere wholly favourable to him; at another he felt absolutely ignorant\nof all that was passing in her, and disposed to interpret her face as\nthat of a conventional woman who had never regarded him as on her own\nsocial plane. These uncertainties, these frequent reversions to a state\nof mind which at other times he seemed to have long outgrown, were a\nsingular feature of his relations with Sidwell. Could such experiences\nconsist with genuine love? Never had he felt more willing to answer the\nquestion with a negative. He felt that he was come here to act a part,\nand that the end of the interview, be it what it might, would only\naffect him superficially.\n\n'No,' he replied, with deliberation; 'I never supposed that you had any\ninterest in the most foolish class of wealthy people. I meant that you\nrecognise your place in a certain social rank, and regard intercourse\nwith your equals as an essential of happiness.'\n\n'If I understood why you ask'--she began abruptly, but ceased as she\nmet his glance. Again he thought she was asserting a distant dignity.\n\n'The question arose naturally out of a train of thought which always\noccupies me when I talk with you. I myself belong to no class whatever,\nand I can't help wondering how--if the subject ever occurred to\nyou--you would place me.'\n\nHe saw his way now, and, having said thus much, could talk on\ndefiantly. This hour must decide his fortune with Sidwell, yet his\ntongue utterly refused any of the modes of speech which the situation\nwould have suggested to an ordinary mind. He could not 'make love'.\nInstead of humility, he was prompted to display a rough arrogance;\ninstead of tender phrases, he uttered what sounded like deliberate\nrudeness. His voice was less gently tuned than Sidwell had been wont to\nhear it. It all meant that he despaired of wooing successfully, and\nmore than half wished to force some word from Sidwell which would spare\nhim the necessity of a plain avowal.\n\nBut before he had finished speaking, her face changed. A light of\nsudden understanding shone in her eyes; her lips softened to a smile of\nexquisite gentleness.\n\n'The subject never _did_ occur to me,' she answered. 'How should it? A\nfriend is a friend.'\n\nIt was not strictly true, but in the strength of her emotion she could\nforget all that contradicted it.\n\n'A friend--yes.'\n\nGodwin began with the same note of bluntness. But of a sudden he felt\nthe influence of Sidwell's smile. His voice sank into a murmur, his\nheart leapt, a thrill went through his veins.\n\n'I wish to be something more than a friend.'\n\nHe felt that it was bald, inadequate. Yet the words had come of their\nown accord, on an impulse of unimpaired sincerity. Sidwell's head was\nbent.\n\n'That is why I can't take simple things for granted,' he continued, his\ngaze fixed upon her. 'If I thought of nothing but friendship, it would\nseem rational enough that you should accept me for what I am--a man of\neducation, talking your own language. Because I have dared to hope\nsomething more, I suffer from the thought that I was not born into your\nworld, and that you must be always remembering this difference.'\n\n'Do you think me so far behind the age?' asked Sidwell, trying to laugh.\n\n'Classes are getting mixed, confused. Yes, but we are so conscious of\nthe process that we talk of class distinctions more than of anything\nelse,--talk and think of them incessantly. You have never heard me make\na profession of Radicalism; _I_ am decidedly behind the age. Be what I\nmay--and I have spiritual pride more than enough--the fact that I have\nrelatives in the lower, even the lowest, social class must necessarily\naffect the whole course of my life. A certain kind of man declares\nhimself proud of such an origin--and most often lies. Or one may be\ndriven by it into rebellion against social privilege. To me, my origin\nis simply a grave misfortune, to be accepted and, if possible,\novercome. Does that sound mean-spirited? I can't help it; I want you to\nknow me.'\n\n'I believe I know you very well,' Sidwell replied.\n\nThe consciousness that she was deceived checked the words which were\nrising to his lips. Again he saw himself in a pitiful light, and this\nself-contempt reflected upon Sidwell. He could not doubt that she was\nyielding to him; her attitude and her voice declared it; but what was\nthe value of love won by imposture? Why had she not intelligence enough\nto see through his hypocrisy, which at times was so thin a veil? How\ndefective must her sympathy be!\n\n'Yet you have seen very little of me,' he said, smiling.\n\nThere was a short silence; then he exclaimed in a voice of emotion:\n\n'How I wish we had known each other ever since that day when your\nbrother brought me to your house near Kingsmill! If we had met and\ntalked through all those years! But that was impossible for the very\nreason which makes me inarticulate now that I wish to say so much. When\nyou first saw me I was a gawky schoolboy, learning to use my brains,\nand knowing already that life had nothing to offer me but a false\nposition. Whether I remained with my kith and kin, or turned my back\nupon them in the hope of finding my equals, I was condemned to a life\nof miserable incompleteness. I was born in exile. It took a long time\nbefore I had taught myself how to move and speak like one of the class\nto which I belonged by right of intellect. I was living alone in\nLondon, in mean lodging-houses. But the day came when I felt more\nconfidence in myself. I had saved money, and foresaw that in a year or\ntwo I should be able to carry out a plan, make one serious attempt to\nwin a position among educated people.'\n\nHe stopped. Had he intended a full confession, it was thus he might\nhave begun it. Sidwell was regarding him, but with a gentle look,\nutterly unsuspecting. She was unable to realise his character and his\ntemptations.\n\n'And have you not succeeded?' she asked, in a low voice.\n\n'Have I? Let me put it to the test. I will set aside every thought of\npresumption; forget that I am a penniless student looking forward to a\ncountry curacy; and say what I wished to when we had our last\nconversation. Never mind how it sounds. I have dared to hope that some\nday I shall ask you to be my wife, and that you won't refuse.'\n\nThe word 'wife' reverberated on his ears. A whirl of emotion broke the\ndefiant calm he had supported for the last few minutes. The silence\nseemed to be endless; when he looked at Sidwell, her head was bent, the\neyes concealed by their drooping lids. Her expression was very grave.\n\n'Such a piece of recklessness,' he said at length, 'deserves no answer.'\n\nSidwell raised her eyes and spoke gently, with voice a little shaken.\n\n'Why should you call it recklessness? I have never thought of the\nthings that seem to trouble you so much. You were a friend of ours.\nWasn't that enough?'\n\nIt seemed to him an evasive reply. Doubtless it was much that she\nshowed neither annoyance nor prudish reserve. He had won the right of\naddressing her on equal terms, but she was not inclined to anticipate\nthat future day to which he pointed.\n\n'You have never thought of such things, because you have never thought\nof me as I of you. Every day of your absence in London has caused me\ntorments which were due most often to the difference between your\nsocial position and mine. You have been among people of leisure and\nrefinement and culture. Each evening you have talked with men whom it\ncost no effort to make themselves liked and respected. I think of that\nwith bitterness.'\n\n'But why? I have made many acquaintances; have met very interesting\npeople. I am glad of it; it enables me to understand you better than I\ncould before.'\n\n'You are glad on that account?'\n\n'Yes; indeed I am.'\n\n'Dare I think you mean more than a civil phrase?'\n\n'I mean quite simply all that my words imply. I have thought of you,\nthough certainly without bitterness. No one's conversation in London\ninterested me so much as yours.'\n\nSoothed with an exquisite joy, Godwin felt his eyes moisten. For a\nmoment he was reconciled to all the world, and forgot the hostilities\nof a lifetime.\n\n'And will it still be so, now, when you go back?' he asked, in a soft\ntone.\n\n'I am sure it will.'\n\n'Then it will be strange if I ever feel bitterly again.'\n\nSidwell smiled.\n\n'You could have said nothing that could please me more. Why should your\nlife be troubled by these dark moods? I could understand it if you were\nstill struggling with--with doubts, with all manner of uncertainties\nabout your course'----\n\nShe hesitated, watching his face.\n\n'You think I have chosen well?' said Godwin, meeting her look.\n\nSidwell's eyes were at once averted.\n\n'I hope,' she said, 'we may talk of that again very soon. You have told\nme much of yourself, but I have said little or nothing of my\nown--difficulties. It won't be long before we come back from London,\nand then'----\n\nOnce more their eyes met steadily.\n\n'You think,' Godwin asked, 'that I am right in aiming at a life of\nretirement?'\n\n'It is one of my doubts. Your influence would be useful anywhere; but\nmost useful, surely, among people of active mind.'\n\n'Perhaps I shan't be able to choose. Remember that I am seeking for a\nlivelihood as well as for a sphere of usefulness.'\n\nHis eyes fell as he spoke. Hitherto he had had no means of learning\nwhether Sidwell would bring her husband a dowry substantial enough to\nbe considered. Though he could not feel that she had betrothed herself\nto him, their talk was so nearly that of avowed lovers that perchance\nshe would disclose whatever might help to put his mind at rest. The\nthought revived his painful self-consciousness; it was that of a\nschemer, yet would not the curse of poverty have suggested it to any\nman?\n\n'Perhaps you won't be able to choose--at first,' Sidwell assented,\nthereby seeming to answer his unspoken question. 'But I am sure my\nfather will use whatever influence he has.'\n\nHad he been seated near enough, he would have been tempted to the\nboldness of taking her hand. What more encouragement did he await? But\nthe distance between them was enough to check his embarrassed impulses.\nHe could not even call her 'Sidwell'; it would have been easier a few\nminutes ago, before she had begun to speak with such calm friendliness.\nNow, in spite of everything, he felt that to dare such a familiarity\nmust needs call upon him the reproof of astonished eyes.\n\n'You return to-morrow?' he asked, suddenly.\n\n'I think so. You have promised me to be cheerful until we are home\nagain.'\n\n'A promise to be cheerful wouldn't mean much. But it _does_ mean much\nthat I can think of what you have said to-day.'\n\nSidwell did not speak, and her silence seemed to compel him to rise. It\nwas strange how remote he still felt from her pure, grave face, and the\nflowing outlines of her figure. Why could he not say to her, 'I love\nyou; give me your hands; give me your lips'? Such words seemed\nimpossible. Yet passion thrilled in him as he watched the grace of her\nmovements, the light and shadow upon her features. She had risen and\ncome a step or two forward.\n\n'I think you look taller--in that dress.'\n\nThe words rather escaped him than were spoken. His need was to talk of\ncommon things, of trifles, that so he might come to feel humanly.\n\nSidwell smiled with unmistakable pleasure.\n\n'Do I? Do you like the dress?'\n\n'Yes. It becomes you.'\n\n'Are you critical in such things?'\n\n'Not with understanding. But I should like to see you every day in a\nnew and beautiful dress.'\n\n'Oh, I couldn't afford it!' was the laughing reply.\n\nHe offered his hand; the touch of her warm, soft fingers fired his\nblood.\n\n'Sidwell!'\n\nIt was spoken at last, involuntarily, and he stood with his eyes on\nhers, her hand crushed in his.\n\n'Some day!' she whispered.\n\nIf their lips met, the contact was so slight as to seem accidental; it\nwas the mere timorous promise of a future kiss. And both were glad of\nthe something that had imposed restraint.\n\nWhen Sidwell went up to her mother's sitting-room, a servant had just\nbrought tea.\n\n'I hear that Mr. Peak has been,' said Mrs. Warricombe, who looked puffy\nand uncomfortable after her sleep. 'Emma was going to take tea to the\nstudy, but I thought it unnecessary. How could he know that we were\nhere?'\n\n'I met him this morning on my way into the town.'\n\n'Surely it was rather inconsiderate of him to call.'\n\n'He asked if he might.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe turned her head and examined Sidwell.\n\n'Oh! And did he stay long?'\n\n'Not very long,' replied Sidwell, who was in quiet good-humour.\n\n'I think it would have been better if you had told him by the servant\nthat I was not well enough to see callers. You didn't mention that he\nmight be coming.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe's mind worked slowly at all times, and at present she\nwas suffering from a cold.\n\n'Why didn't you speak of it, Sidwell?'\n\n'Really--I forgot,' replied the daughter, lightly.\n\n'And what had he to say?'\n\n'Nothing new, mother. Is your head better, dear?'\n\nThere was no answer. Mrs. Warricombe had conceived a vague suspicion\nwhich was so alarming that she would not press inquiries alluding to\nit. The encouragement given by her husband to Godwin Peak in the\nlatter's social progress had always annoyed her, though she could not\nframe solid objections. To be sure, to say of a man that he is about to\nbe ordained meets every possible question that society can put; but\nMrs. Warricombe's uneasiness was in part due to personal dislike.\nOftener than not, she still thought of Peak as he appeared some eleven\nyears ago--an evident plebeian, without manners, without a redeeming\ngrace. She knew the story of his relative who had opened a shop in\nKingsmill; thinking of that now, she shuddered.\n\nSidwell began to talk of indifferent matters, and Peak was not again\nmentioned.\n\nHer throat being still troublesome, Mrs. Warricombe retired very soon\nafter dinner. About nine o'clock Sidwell went to the library, and sat\ndown at her father's writing-table, purposing a letter to Sylvia. She\npenned a line or two, but soon lapsed into reverie, her head on her\nhands. Of a sudden the door was thrown open, and there stood Buckland,\nfresh from travel.\n\n'What has brought you?' exclaimed his sister, starting up anxiously,\nfor something in the young man's look seemed ominous.\n\n'Oh, nothing to trouble about. I had to come down--on business. Mother\ngone to bed?'\n\nSidwell explained.\n\n'All right; doesn't matter. I suppose I can sleep here? Let them get me\na mouthful of something; cold meat, anything will do.'\n\nHis needs were quickly supplied, and before long he was smoking by the\nlibrary fire.\n\n'I was writing to Sylvia,' said his sister, glancing at her fragmentary\nletter.\n\n'Oh!'\n\n'You know she is at Salisbury?'\n\n'Salisbury? No, I didn't.'\n\nHis carelessness proved to Sidwell that she was wrong in conjecturing\nthat his journey had something to do with Miss Moorhouse. Buckland was\nin no mood for conversation; he smoked for a quarter of an hour whilst\nSidwell resumed her writing.\n\n'Of course you haven't seen Peak?' fell from him at length.\n\nHis sister looked at him before replying.\n\n'Yes. He called this afternoon.'\n\n'But who told him you were here?'\n\nHis brows were knitted, and he spoke very abruptly. Sidwell gave the\nsame explanation as to her mother, and had further to reply that she\nalone received the caller.\n\n'I see,' was Buckland's comment.\n\nIts tone troubled Sidwell.\n\n'Has your coming anything to do with Mr. Peak?'\n\n'Yes, it has. I want to see him the first thing to-morrow.\n\n'Can you tell me what about?'\n\nHe searched her face, frowning.\n\n'Not now. I'll tell you in the morning.'\n\nSidwell saw herself doomed to a night of suspense. She could not\nconfess how nearly the mystery concerned her. Had Buckland made some\ndiscovery that irritated him against Peak? She knew he was disposed to\ncatch at anything that seemed to tell against Godwin's claims to\nrespectful treatment, and it surely must be a grave affair to hurry him\non so long a journey. Though she could imagine no ground of fear, the\nsituation was seriously disturbing.\n\nShe tried to go on with her letter, but failed. As Buckland smoked in\nsilence, she at length rose and said she would go upstairs.\n\n'All right! Shall see you at breakfast. Good-night!'\n\nAt nine next morning Mrs. Warricombe sent a message to Buckland that\nshe wished to see him in her bedroom. He entered hurriedly.\n\n'Cold better, mother? I have only just time to drink a cup of coffee. I\nwant to catch Peak before he can have left home.'\n\n'Mr. Peak? Why? I was going to speak about him.'\n\n'What were you going to say?' Buckland asked, anxiously.\n\nHis mother began in a roundabout way which threatened long detention.\nIn a minute or two Buckland had gathered enough to interrupt her with\nthe direct inquiry:\n\n'You don't mean that there's anything between him and Sidwell?'\n\n'I do hope not; but I can't imagine why she should--really, almost make\na private appointment. I am very uneasy, Buckland. I have hardly slept.\nSidwell is rather--you know'----\n\n'The deuce! I can't stop now. Wait an hour or two, and I shall have\nseen the fellow. You needn't alarm yourself. He will probably have\ndisappeared in a few days.'\n\n'What do you mean?' Mrs. Warricombe asked, with nervous eagerness.\n\n'I'll explain afterwards.'\n\nHe hurried away. Sidwell was at the breakfast-table. Her eyes seemed to\ndeclare that she had not slept well. With an insignificant word or two,\nthe young man swallowed his cup of coffee, and had soon left the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe wrath which illumined Buckland's countenance as he strode rapidly\ntowards Longbrook Street was not unmingled with joy. In the deep pocket\nof his ulster lay something heavy which kept striking against his leg,\nand every such contact spurred him with a sense of satisfaction. All\nhis suspicions were abundantly justified. Not only would his father and\nSidwell be obliged to confess that his insight had been profounder than\ntheirs, but he had the pleasure of standing justified before his own\nconscience. The philosophy by which he lived was strikingly illustrated\nand confirmed.\n\nHe sniffed the morning air, enjoyed the firmness of the frozen ground,\non which his boots made a pleasant thud. To be sure, the interview\nbefore him would have its disagreeableness, but Buckland was not one of\nthose over-civilised men who shrink from every scene of painful\nexplanation. The detection of a harmful lie was decidedly congenial to\nhim--especially when he and his had been made its victims. He was now\nat liberty to indulge that antipathetic feeling towards Godwin Peak\nwhich sundry considerations had hitherto urged him to repress. Whatever\nmight have passed between Peak and Sidwell, he could not doubt that his\nsister's peace was gravely endangered; the adventurer (with however\nmuch or little sincerity) had been making subtle love to her. Such a\nthought was intolerable. Buckland's class-prejudice asserted itself\nwith brutal vigour now that it had moral indignation for an ally.\n\nHe had never been at Peak's lodgings, but the address was long since\nnoted. Something of disdain came into his eyes as he approached the row\nof insignificant houses. Having pulled the bell, he stood at his full\nheight, looking severely at the number painted on the door.\n\nMrs. Roots opened to him, and said that her lodger was at home. He gave\nhis name, and after waiting for a moment was led to the upper floor.\nGodwin, who had breakfasted later than usual, still sat by the table.\nOn Warricombe's entrance, he pushed back his chair and rose, but with\ndeliberate movement, scarcely smiling. That Buckland made no offer of a\nfriendly hand did not surprise him. The name of his visitor had alarmed\nhim with a sudden presentiment. Hardening his features, he stood in\nexpectancy.\n\n'I want to have a talk with you,' Buckland began. 'You are at leisure,\nI hope?'\n\n'Pray sit down.'\n\nGodwin pointed to a chair near the fire, but Warricombe, having thrown\nhis hat on to a side table, seated himself by one of the windows. His\nmotions proved that he found it difficult to support a semblance of\ncourtesy.\n\n'I have come down from London on purpose to see you. Unless I am\nstrangely misinformed you have been guilty of conduct which I shouldn't\nlike to call by its proper name.'\n\nRemembering that he was in a little house, with thin partitions, he\nkept his voice low, but the effort this cost him was obvious. He looked\nstraight at Peak, who did not return the gaze.\n\n'Indeed?' said Godwin, coldly. 'What is my crime?'\n\n'I am told that you have won the confidence of my relatives by what\nlooks like a scheme of gross dishonesty.'\n\n'Indeed? Who has told you so?'\n\n'No one in so many words. But I happened to come across certain\nacquaintances of yours in London--people who know you very well indeed;\nand I find that they regard your position here as altogether\nincredible. You will remember I had much the same feeling myself. In\nsupport of their view it was mentioned to me that you had published an\narticle in _The Critical_--the date less than a year ago, observe. The\narticle was anonymous, but I remember it very well. I have re-read it,\nand I want you to tell me how the views it expresses can be reconciled\nwith those you have maintained in conversation with my father.'\n\nHe drew from his pocket the incriminating periodical, turned it back at\nthe article headed 'The New Sophistry', and held it out for inspection.\n\n'Perhaps you would like to refresh your memory.'\n\n'Needless, thank you,' returned Godwin, with a smile--in which the\nvanity of an author had its part.\n\nHad Marcella betrayed him? He had supposed she knew nothing of this\narticle, but Earwaker had perhaps spoken of it to Moxey before\nreceiving the injunction of secrecy. On the other hand, it might be\nEarwaker himself from whom Warricombe had derived his information. Not\nimpossible for the men to meet, and Earwaker's indignation might have\nled him to disregard a friend's confidence.\n\nThe details mattered little. He was face to face with the most serious\ndanger that could befall him, and already he had strung himself to\nencounter it. Yet even in the same moment he asked, 'Is it worth while?'\n\n'Did you write this?' Buckland inquired.\n\n'Yes, I wrote it.'\n\n'Then I wait for your explanation.'\n\n'You mustn't expect me to enter upon an elaborate defence,' Godwin\nreplied, taking his pipe from the mantelpiece and beginning to fill it.\n'A man charged with rascality can hardly help getting excited--and that\nexcitement, to one in your mood, seems evidence against him. Please to\nbear in mind that I have never declared myself an orthodox theologian.\nMr. Warricombe is well acquainted with my views; to you I have never\nexplained them.'\n\n'You mean to say that my father knew of this article?'\n\n'No. I have not spoken of it.'\n\n'And why not?'\n\n'Because, for one thing, I shouldn't write in that way now; and, for\nanother, the essay seems to imply more than I meant when I did write\nit.'\n\n'\"Seems to imply\"----? I understand. You wish to represent that this\nattack on M'Naughten involves no attack on Christianity?'\n\n'Not on Christianity as I understand it.'\n\nBuckland's face expressed profound disgust, but he controlled his\nspeech.\n\n'Well, I foresaw this. You attacked a new sophistry, but there is a\nnewer sophistry still, and uncommonly difficult it is to deal with. Mr.\nPeak, I have a plain word to say to you. More than a year ago you asked\nme for my goodwill, to aid you in getting a social position. Say what\nyou like, I see now that you dealt with me dishonestly. I can no longer\nbe your friend in any sense, and I shall do my best to have you\nexcluded from my parents' house. My father will re-read this essay--I\nhave marked the significant passages throughout--and will form his own\njudgment; I know what it will be.'\n\n'You are within your rights.'\n\n'Undoubtedly,' replied Buckland, with polished insolence, as he rose\nfrom his seat. 'I can't forbid you to go to the house again, but--I\nhope we mayn't meet there. It would be very unpleasant.'\n\nGodwin was still pressing down the tobacco in the bowl of his pipe. He\nsmiled, and glanced about the room. Did Warricombe know how far things\nhad gone between him and Sidwell? Whether or no, it was certain now\nthat Sidwell would be informed of this disastrous piece of\nauthorship--and the result?\n\nWhat did it matter? There is no struggling against destiny. If he and\nSidwell were ever fated to come together, why, these difficulties would\nall be surmounted. If, as seemed more than likely, he was again to be\nfoiled on the point of success--he could bear it, perhaps even enjoy\nthe comedy.\n\n'There is no possibility of arguing against determined anger,' he said,\nquietly. 'I am not at all inclined to plead for justice: one only does\nthat with a friend who desires to be just. My opinions are utterly\ndistasteful to you, and personal motives have made you regard me as--a\nscoundrel to be got rid of. Well, there's an end of it. I don't see\nwhat is to be gained by further talk.'\n\nThis was a dismissal. Godwin felt the necessity of asserting himself\nthus far.\n\n'One question,' said Warricombe, as he put the periodical back into his\npocket. 'What do you mean by my \"personal motives\"?'\n\nTheir eyes met for an instant.\n\n'I mean the motives which you have spoken of.'\n\nIt was Buckland's hope that Peak might reveal his relations with\nSidwell, but he shrank from seeming to know anything of the matter.\nClearly, no light was to be had from this source.\n\n'I am afraid,' he said, moving to the door, 'that you will find my\nmotives shared by all the people whose acquaintance you have made in\nExeter.'\n\nAnd without further leave-taking he departed.\n\nThere was a doubt in his mind. Peak's coolness might be the audacity of\nrascaldom; he preferred to understand it so; but it _might_ have\nnothing to do with baseness.\n\n'Confound it!' he muttered to himself, irritably. 'In our times life is\nso deucedly complicated. It used to be the easiest thing to convict a\nman of religious hypocrisy; nowadays, one has to bear in mind such a\nmultiplicity of fine considerations. There's that fellow Bruno\nChilvers: mightn't anyone who had personal reasons treat him precisely\nas I have treated Peak? Both of them _may_ be honest. Yet in Peak's\ncase all appearances are against him--just because he is of low birth,\nhas no means, and wants desperately to get into society. The fellow is\na scoundrel; I am convinced of it. Yet his designs may be innocent.\nHow, then, a scoundrel?----\n\n'Poor devil! Has he really fallen in love with Sidwell?----\n\n'Humbug! He wants position, and the comfort it brings. And if he hadn't\nacted like a blackguard--if he had come among us telling the truth--who\nknows? Sidwell wouldn't then have thought of him, but for my own part I\nwould willingly have given him a hand. There are plenty of girls who\nhave learned to think for themselves.'\n\nThis was an unhappy line of reflection. It led to Sylvia Moorhouse--and\nto grinding of the teeth. By the time he reached the house, Buckland\nwas again in remorseless mood.\n\nHe would have it out with Sidwell. The desire of proving to her that he\nhad been right from the first overrode all thought of the pain he might\ninflict.\n\nShe was in the library. At breakfast he had noticed her heavy eyes, and\nthat she made only a pretence of eating. She was now less unlike\nherself, but her position at the window showed that she had been\nwaiting impatiently.\n\n'Isn't mother coming down to-day?' he asked.\n\n'Yes; after luncheon she will go out for an hour, if it keeps fine.'\n\n'And to-morrow you return?'\n\n'If mother feels able to travel.'\n\nHe had _The Critical_ in his hand, and stood rustling the pages with\nhis fingers.\n\n'I have been to see Peak.'\n\n'Have you?'\n\nShe moved a few steps and seated herself sideways on a small chair.\n\n'My business with him was confoundedly unpleasant. I'm glad it's over.\nI wish I had known what I now do half a year ago.'\n\n'Let me hear what it is.'\n\n'You remember that I told you to be on your guard against Peak?'\n\nSidwell smiled faintly, and glanced at him, but made no answer.\n\n'I knew he wasn't to be trusted,' pursued her brother, with gloomy\nsatisfaction. 'And I had far better means of judging than father or\nyou; but, of course, my suspicions were ungenerous and cynical.'\n\n'Will you come to the point?' said Sidwell, in an irritated tone.\n\n'I think you read this article in _The Critical_?' He approached and\nshowed it to her. 'We spoke of it once, _a propos_ of M'Naughten's\nbook.'\n\nShe raised her eyes, and met his with a look of concern she could not\ndisguise.\n\n'What of that?'\n\n'Peak is the author of it. It seems to have been written just about the\ntime when I met him and brought him here as a visitor, and it was\npublished after he had begun to edify you with his zeal for\nChristianity.'\n\nShe held out her hand.\n\n'You remember the tone of the thing?' Buckland added. 'I'll leave it\nwith you; but just glance at one or two of the passages I have marked.\nThe Anglicanism of their writer is decidedly \"broad\", it seems to me.'\n\nHe moved apart and watched his sister as she bent over the pages. There\nwas silence for five minutes. Seeing that Sidwell had ceased to read,\nhe ejaculated, 'Well?'\n\n'Has Mr. Peak admitted the authorship?' she asked, slowly and\ndistinctly.\n\n'Yes, and with a cool impudence I hardly expected.'\n\n'Do you mean that he has made no attempt to justify himself?'\n\n'None worth listening to. Practically, he refused an explanation.'\n\nSidwell rested her forehead lightly upon the tips of her fingers; the\nperiodical slipped from her lap and lay open on the floor.\n\n'How did you find this out?'\n\n'In the simplest way. Knowing perfectly well that I had only to get\nfamiliar with some of his old friends to obtain proof that he was an\nimpostor, I followed up my acquaintance with Miss Moxey--got hold of\nher brother--called upon them. Whilst I was there, a man named Malkin\ncame in, and somehow or other he began talking of Peak. I learned at\nonce precisely what I expected, that Peak was known to all these people\nas a violent anti-Christian. Malkin refused to believe the story of his\ngoing in for the Church--it sounded to him a mere joke. Then came out\nthe fact that he had written this article. They all knew about it.'\n\nHe saw a flush of shame upon Sidwell's half-hidden face. It gratified\nhim. He was resolved to let her taste all the bitterness of her folly.\n\n'It seems pretty clear that the Moxeys--at all events Miss Moxey--knew\nthe rascally part he was playing. Whether they wished to unmask him, or\nnot, I can't say. Perhaps not. Yet I caught an odd look on Miss Moxey's\nface when that man Malkin began to talk of Peak's characteristics and\nachievements. It came out, by-the-bye, that he had given all his\nacquaintances the slip; they had completely lost sight of him--I\nsuppose until Miss Moxey met him by chance at Budleigh Salterton.\nThere's some mystery still. She evidently kept Peak's secret from the\nMoorhouses and the Walworths. A nice business, altogether!'\n\nAgain there was a long silence. Then Sidwell raised her face and said,\nabruptly:\n\n'You may be quite mistaken.'\n\n'How?'\n\n'You went to Mr. Peak in a spirit of enmity and anger. It is not likely\nhe would explain himself. You may have quite misunderstood what he\nsaid.'\n\n'Ridiculous! You mean that he was perhaps \"converted\" after writing\nthis article?--Then why did he allow it to be published?'\n\n'He did not sign it. He may have been unable to withdraw it from the\neditor's hands.'\n\n'Bosh! He didn't sign it, because the idea of this Exeter campaign came\nbetween the reception and the appearance of his paper. In the ordinary\ncourse of things, he would have been only too glad to see his name in\n_The Critical_. The scoundrelly project was conceived perhaps the very\nday that I brought him here--perhaps in that moment--at lunch, do you\nremember?--when he began to talk of the sermon at the Cathedral?'\n\n'Why did he go to the Cathedral and hear that sermon?'\n\n'To amuse a Sunday morning, I suppose.'\n\n'That is not very likely in a man who hates and ridicules religion.'\n\n'It is decidedly more probable than the idea of his conversion.'\n\nSidwell fell back again into her brooding attitude.\n\n'The reason of your mistake in judging him,' resumed Buckland, with\nemphasis, 'is that you have undervalued his intellect. I told you long\nago that a man of Peak's calibre could not possibly be a supporter of\ndogmas and churches. No amount of plausible evidence would have made me\nbelieve in his sincerity. Let me beg you to appreciate the simple fact,\nthat _no_ young man of brains and education is nowadays an honest\ndefender of mediaeval Christianity--the Christianity of your churches.\nSuch fellows may transact with their conscience, and make a more or\nless decent business of the clerical career; or, in rare cases, they\nmay believe that society is served by the maintenance of a national\nfaith, and accordingly preach with all manner of mental reserves and\nsymbolical interpretations. These are in reality politicians, not\npriests. But Peak belongs to neither class. He is an acute cynic, bent\non making the best of this world, since he believes in no other. How he\nmust have chuckled after every visit to this house! He despises you,\none and all. Believe me, he regards you with profound contempt.'\n\nBuckland's obtuseness on the imaginative side spared him the\nunderstanding of his sister's state of mind. Though in theory he\nrecognised that women were little amenable to reasoning, he took it for\ngranted that a clear demonstration of Peak's duplicity must at once\nbanish all thought of him from Sidwell's mind. Therefore he was\nunsparing in his assaults upon her delusion. It surprised him when at\nlength Sidwell looked up with flashing, tear-dewed eyes and addressed\nhim indignantly:\n\n'In all this there is not one word of truth! You know that in\nrepresenting the clergy as a body of ignorant and shallow men you speak\nout of prejudice. If you believed what you say, you would be yourself\nboth ignorant and shallow. I can't trust your judgment of anyone\nwhatever.'\n\nShe paused, but in a moment added the remark which would have come\nfirst had she spoken in the order of her thoughts.\n\n'It is because the spirit of contempt is so familiar to you that you\nare so ready to perceive it in others. I consider that habit of mind\nworse than hypocrisy--yes, worse, far worse!'\n\nBuckland was sorry for the pain he had given. The retort did not affect\nhim, but he hung his head and looked uncomfortable. His next speech was\nin a milder strain:\n\n'I feel it a duty, Sidwell, to represent this man to you in what I\nverily believe to be the true light. To be despised by one who is\nimmeasurably contemptible surely can't distress you. If a butler gets\ninto your house by means of a forged character, and then lays his plans\nfor a great burglary, no doubt he scorns you for being so easily taken\nin,--and that is an exact parallel to Peak's proceedings. He has\nsomehow got the exterior of a gentleman; you could not believe that one\nwho behaved so agreeably and talked so well was concealing an\nessentially base nature. But I must remind you that Peak belongs by\norigin to the lower classes, which is as much as to say that he lacks\nthe sense of honour generally inherited by men of our world. A powerful\nintellect by no means implies a corresponding development of the moral\nsense.'\n\nSidwell could not close her ears against the argument. But her features\nwere still set in an expression of resentment, and she kept silence\nlest her voice should sound tearful.\n\n'And don't be tempted by personal feeling,' pursued her brother, 'to\nmake light of hypocrisy--especially this kind. The man who can act such\na part as Peak's has been for the last twelve months must be capable of\nany depravity. It is difficult for you to estimate his baseness,\nbecause you are only half convinced that any one can really be an enemy\nof religious faith. You suspect a lurking belief even in the minds of\navowed atheists. But take the assurance from me that a man like Peak\n(and I am at one with him in this matter) regards with absolute\nrepugnance every form of supernaturalism. For him to affect belief in\nyour religion, is a crime against conscience. Peak has committed this\ncrime with a mercenary motive,--what viler charge could be brought\nagainst him?'\n\nWithout looking at him, his sister replied:\n\n'Whether he is guilty or not, I can't yet determine. But the motive of\nhis life here was not mercenary.'\n\n'Then how would you describe it?' Buckland asked, in astonishment.\n\n'I only know that it can't be called mercenary.'\n\n'Then the distinction you draw must be a very fine one.--He has\nabandoned the employment by which he lived, and by his own admission he\nlooks to the Church for means of support. It was necessary for him to\nmake interest with people of social position; the closer his relations\nwith them the better. From month to month he has worked skilfully to\nestablish his footing in this house, and among your friends. What do\nyou call this?'\n\nShe had no verbal answer to make, but her look declared that she held\nto another interpretation.\n\n'Well,' Buckland added, impatiently, 'we will hear father's opinion.\nHe, remember, has been deceived in a very gross and cruel way. Possibly\nhe may help you to see the thing in all its hatefulness.'\n\nSidwell turned to him.\n\n'You go to London this afternoon?'\n\n'In an hour or two,' he replied, consulting his watch.\n\n'Is it any use my asking you to keep silence about everything until I\nam back in town?'\n\nBuckland frowned and hesitated.\n\n'To mother as well as father, you mean?'\n\n'Yes. Will you do me this kindness?'\n\n'Answer me a question, Sidwell. Have you any thought of seeing Peak?'\n\n'I can't say,' she replied, in agitation. 'I must leave myself free. I\nhave a right to use my own judgment.'\n\n'Don't see him! I beg you not to see him!'\n\nHe was so earnest that Sidwell suspected some other reason in his\nrequest than regard for her dignity.\n\n'I must leave myself free,' she repeated, with shaking voice. 'In any\ncase I shall be back in London to-morrow evening--that is, if--but I am\nsure mother will wish to go. Grant me this one kindness; say nothing\nhere or there till I am back and have seen you again.'\n\nHe turned a deaf ear, for the persistency with which she resisted proof\nof Peak's dishonour had begun to alarm him. Who could say what\nmiserable folly she might commit in the next four-and-twenty hours? The\nunavoidable necessity of his own return exasperated him; he wished to\nsee her safe back in London, and under her father's care.\n\n'No,' he exclaimed, with a gesture of determination; 'I can't keep such\na thing as this secret for another hour. Mother must know at\nonce--especially as you mean to invite that fellow into the house\nagain.--I have half a mind to telegraph to Godolphin that I can't\npossibly be with him to-night.'\n\nSidwell regarded him and spoke with forced composure.\n\n'Do as seems right to you, Buckland. But don't think that by remaining\nhere you would prevent me from seeing Mr. Peak, if I wish to do so.\nThat is treating me too much like a child. You have done your\npart--doubtless your duty; now I must reflect and judge for myself.\nNeither you nor anyone else has authority over me in such\ncircumstances.'\n\n'Very well. I have no authority, as you say, but common sense bids me\nlet mother know how the case stands.'\n\nAnd angrily he left the room.\n\n_The Critical_ still lay where it had fallen. When Sidwell had stood a\nwhile in confused thought, her eye turned to it, and she went hurriedly\nto take it up. Yes, that was the first thing to be done, to read those\npages with close care. For this she must have privacy. She ran upstairs\nand shut herself in her bedroom.\n\nBut did not at once begin to read. It concerned her deeply to know\nwhether Peak had so expressed himself in this paper, that no room was\nleft for doubt as to his convictions; but another question pressed upon\nher with even more urgency--could it be true that he did not love her?\nIf Buckland were wholly right, then it mattered little in what degree\nshe had been misled by intellectual hypocrisy.\n\nIt was impossible to believe that Peak had made love to her in cold\nblood, with none but sordid impulses. The thought was so humiliating\nthat her mind resolutely rejected it; and she had no difficulty in\nrecalling numberless minutiae of behaviour--nuances of look and tone\nsuch as abide in a woman's memory--any one of which would have sufficed\nto persuade her that he felt genuine emotion. How had it come to pass\nthat a feeling of friendly interest, which did not for a moment\nthreaten her peace, changed all at once to an agitation only the more\npersistent the more she tried to subdue it,--how, if it were not that\nher heart responded to a passionate appeal, effectual as only the\nsincerest love can prove? Prior to that long talk with Godwin, on the\neve of her departure for London, she had not imagined that he loved\nher; when they said good-bye to each other, she knew by her own\nsensations all that the parting meant to him. She felt glad, instead of\nsorry, that they were not to meet again for several months; for she\nwished to think of him calmly and prudently, now that he presented\nhimself to her imagination in so new an aspect. The hand-clasp was a\nmutual assurance of fidelity.\n\n'I should never have loved him, if he had not first loved me. Of that I\nam as firmly convinced as of my own existence. It is not in my nature\nto dream romances. I never did so even as a young girl, and at this age\nI am not likely to fall into a foolish self-deception. I had often\nthought about him. He seemed to me a man of higher and more complex\ntype than those with whom I was familiar; but most surely I never\nattributed to him even a corresponding interest in me. I am neither\nvain, nor very anxious to please; I never suffered because men did not\nwoo me; I have only moderate good looks, and certainly no uncommon\nmental endowments.--If he had been attracted by Sylvia, I should have\nthought it natural; and I more than once suspected that Sylvia was\ndisposed to like him. It seemed strange at first that his choice should\nhave fallen upon me; yet when I was far away from him, and longed so to\nsit once more by him and hear him talk, I understood that it might be\nin my power to afford him the companionship he needed.--Mercenary? If I\nhad been merely a governess in the house, he would have loved me just\nthe same!'\n\nOnly by a painful effort could she remind herself that the ideal which\nhad grown so slowly was now defaced. He loved her, but it was not the\nlove of an honest man. After all, she had no need to peruse this\nwriting of his; she remembered so well how it had impressed her when\nshe read it on its first appearance, how her father had spoken of it.\nBuckland's manifold evidence was irresistible. Why should Peak have\nconcealed his authorship? Why had he disappeared from among the people\nwho thoroughly knew him?\n\nShe had loved a dream. What a task would it be to distinguish between\nthose parts of Peak's conversation which represented his real thoughts,\nand those which were mockery of his listeners! The plan of a retired\nlife which he had sketched to her--was it all falsehood? Impossible,\nfor his love was inextricably blended with the details. Did he imagine\nthat the secret of his unbelief could be preserved for a lifetime, and\nthat it would have no effect whatever upon his happiness as a man? This\nseemed a likely reading of the problem. But what a multitude of moral\nand intellectual obscurities remained! The character which had seemed\nto her nobly simple was become a dark and dread enigma.\n\nShe knew so little of his life. If only it could all be laid bare to\nher, the secret of his position would be revealed. Buckland's violence\naltogether missed its mark; the dishonour of such a man as Godwin Peak\nwas due to no gross incentive.\n\nIt was probable that, in talk with her father, he had been guilty of\nmore deliberate misrepresentation than had marked his intercourse with\nthe rest of the family. Her father, she felt sure, had come to regard\nhim as a valuable source of argument in the battle against materialism.\nDoubtless the German book, which Peak was translating, bore upon that\ndebate, and consequently was used as an aid to dissimulation. Thinking\nof this, she all but shared her brother's vehement feeling. It pained\nher to the inmost heart that her father's generous and candid nature\nshould thus have been played upon. The deceit, as it concerned herself\nalone, she could forgive; at least she could suspend judgment until the\naccused had offered his defence--feeling that the psychology of the\ncase must till then be beyond her powers of analysis. But the wrong\ndone to her father revolted her.\n\nA tap at the door caused her to rise, trembling. She remembered that by\nthis time her mother must be aware of the extraordinary disclosure, and\nthat a new scene of wretched agitation had to be gone through.\n\n'Sidwell!'\n\nIt was Mrs. Warricombe's voice, and the door opened.\n\n'Sidwell!--What _does_ all this mean? I don't understand half that\nBuckland has been telling me.'\n\nThe speaker's face was mottled, and she stood panting, a hand pressed\nagainst her side.\n\n'How very, very imprudent we have been! How wrong of father not to have\nmade inquiries! To think that such a man should have sat at our table!'\n\n'Sit down, mother; don't be so distressed,' said Sidwell, calmly. 'It\nwill all very soon be settled.'\n\n'Of course not a word must be said to anyone. How very fortunate that\nwe shall be in London till the summer! Of course he must leave Exeter.'\n\n'I have no doubt he will. Let us talk as little of it as possible,\nmother. We shall go back to-morrow'----\n\n'This afternoon! We will go back with Buckland. That is decided. I\ncouldn't sleep here another night.'\n\n'We must remain till to-morrow,' Sidwell replied, with quiet\ndetermination.\n\n'Why? What reason can there be?'\n\nMrs. Warricombe's voice was suspended by a horrible surmise.\n\n'Of course we shall go to-day, Sidwell,' she continued, in nervous\nhaste. 'To think of that man having the impudence to call and sit\ntalking with you! If I could have dreamt'----\n\n'Mother,' said Sidwell, gravely, 'I am obliged to see Mr. Peak, either\nthis evening or to-morrow morning.'\n\n'To--to _see_ him----? Sidwell! What can you mean?'\n\n'I have a reason for wishing to hear from his own lips the whole truth.'\n\n'But we _know_ the whole truth!--What can you be thinking of, dear? Who\nis this Mr. Peak that you should ask him to come and see you, under\n_any_ circumstances?'\n\nIt would never have occurred to Sidwell to debate with her mother on\nsubtle questions of character and motive, but the agitation of her\nnerves made it difficult for her to keep silence under these vapid\noutcries. She desired to be alone; commonplace discussion of the misery\nthat had come upon her was impossible. A little more strain, and she\nwould be on the point of tears, a weakness she was resolute to avoid.\n\n'Let me think quietly for an hour or two,' she said, moving away. 'It's\nquite certain that I must stay here till to-morrow. When Buckland has\ngone, we can talk again.'\n\n'But, Sidwell'----\n\n'If you insist, I must leave the house, and find a refuge somewhere\nelse.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe tossed her head.\n\n'Oh, if I am not permitted to speak to you! I only hope you won't have\noccasion to remember my warning! Such extraordinary behaviour was\nsurely never known! I should have thought'----\n\nSidwell was by this time out of the room. Safe in privacy she sat down\nas if to pen a letter. From an hour's agitated thought, the following\nlines resulted:\n\n'My brother has told me of a conversation he held with you this\nmorning. He says you admit the authorship of an article which seems\nquite inconsistent with what you have professed in our talks. How am I\nto understand this contradiction? I beg that you will write to me at\nonce. I shall anxiously await your reply.'\n\nThis, with her signature, was all. Having enclosed the note in an\nenvelope, she left it on her table and went down to the library, where\nBuckland was sitting alone in gloomy reverie. Mrs. Warricombe had told\nhim of Sidwell's incredible purpose. Recognising his sister's\nindependence, and feeling sure that if she saw Peak it could only be to\ntake final leave of him, he had decided to say no more. To London he\nmust perforce return this afternoon, but he had done his duty\nsatisfactorily, and just in time. It was plain that things had gone far\nbetween Peak and Sidwell; the latter's behaviour avowed it. But danger\nthere could be none, with 'The New Sophistry' staring her in the eyes.\nLet her see the fellow, by all means. His evasions and hair-splittings\nwould complete her deliverance.\n\n'There's a train at 1.53,' Buckland remarked, rising, 'and I shall\ncatch it if I start now. I can't stay for the discomfort of luncheon.\nYou remain here till to-morrow, I understand?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'It's a pity you are angry with me. It seems to me I have done you a\nkindness.'\n\n'I am not angry with you, Buckland,' she replied, gently. 'You have\ndone what you were plainly obliged to do.'\n\n'That's a sensible way of putting it. Let us say goodbye with\nfriendliness then.'\n\nSidwell gave her hand, and tried to smile. With a look of pained\naffection, Buckland went silently away.\n\nShortly after, Sidwell fetched her note from upstairs, and gave it to\nthe housekeeper to be delivered by hand as soon as possible. Mrs\nWarricombe remained invisible, and Sidwell went back to the library,\nwhere she sat with _The Critical_ open before her at Godwin's essay.\n\nHours went by; she still waited for an answer from Longbrook Street.\n\nAt six o'clock she went upstairs and spoke to her mother.\n\n'Shall you come down to dinner?'\n\n'No, Sidwell,' was the cold reply. 'Be so good as to excuse me.\n\nTowards eight, a letter was brought to her; it could only be from\nGodwin Peak. With eyes which endeavoured to take in all at once, and\ntherefore could at first distinguish nothing, she scanned what seemed\nto be hurriedly written lines.\n\n'I have tried to answer you in a long letter, but after all I can't\nsend it. I fear you wouldn't understand. Better to repeat simply that I\nwrote the article you speak of. I should have told you about it some\nday, but now my intentions and hopes matter nothing. Whatever I said\nnow would seem dishonest pleading. Good-bye.'\n\nShe read this so many times that at length she had but to close her\neyes to see every word clearly traced on the darkness. The meanings she\nextracted from each sentence were scarcely less numerous than her\nperusals. In spite of reason, this enigmatic answer brought her some\nsolace. He _could_ defend himself; that was the assurance she had\nlonged for. Impossible (she again and again declared to herself with\nemphasis) for their intimacy to be resumed. But in secret she could\nhold him, if not innocent, at all events not base. She had not bestowed\nher love upon a mere impostor.\n\nBut now a mournful, regretful passion began to weigh upon her heart.\nShe shed tears, and presently stole away to her room for a night of\nsorrow.\n\nWhat must be her practical course? If she went back to London without\naddressing another word to him, he must understand her silence as a\nfinal farewell. In that case his departure from Exeter would, no doubt,\nspeedily follow, and there was little likelihood that she would ever\nagain see him. Were Godwin a vulgar schemer, he would not so readily\nrelinquish the advantage he had gained; he would calculate upon the\nweakness of a loving woman, and make at least one effort to redeem his\nposition. As it was, she could neither hope nor fear that he would try\nto see her again. Yet she wished to see him, desired it ardently.\n\nAnd yet--for each impulse of ardour was followed by a cold fit of\nreasoning--might not his abandonment of the position bear a meaning\nsuch as Buckland would of course attribute to it? If he were hopeless\nof the goodwill of her parents, what profit would it be to him to\nretain her love? She was no heiress; supposing him actuated by base\nmotive, her value in his eyes came merely of his regarding her as a\nmeans to an end.\n\nBut this was to reopen the question of whether or not he truly loved\nher. No; he was forsaking her because he thought it impossible for her\nto pardon the deceit he had undeniably practised--with whatever\npalliating circumstances. He was overcome with shame. He imagined her\nindignant, scornful.\n\nWhy had she written such a short, cold note, the very thing to produce\nin his mind a conviction of her resentment?\n\nHereupon came another paroxysm of tearful misery. It was intensified by\na thought she had half consciously been repressing ever since the\nconversation with her brother. Was it true that Miss Moxey had had it\nin her power to strip Godwin of a disguise? What, then, were the\nrelations existing between him and that strangely impressive woman? How\nlong had they known each other? It was now all but certain that a\nstrong intellectual sympathy united their minds--and perhaps there had\nbeen something more.\n\nShe turned her face upon the pillow and moaned.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nAnd from the Moxeys Buckland had derived his information. What was it\nhe said--something about 'an odd look' on Miss Moxey's face when that\nfriend of theirs talked of Peak? Might not such a look signify a\nconflict between the temptation to injure and the desire to screen?\n\nSidwell constructed a complete romance. Ignorance of the past of both\npersons concerned allowed her imagination free play. There was no limit\nto the possibilities of self-torment.\n\nThe desire to see Godwin took such hold upon her, that she had already\nbegun to think over the wording of another note to be sent to him the\nfirst thing in the morning. His reply had been insufficient: simple\njustice required that she should hear him in his own defence before\nparting with him for ever. If she kept silence, he would always\nremember her with bitterness, and this would make her life-long sorrow\nharder to bear. Sidwell was one of those few women whose love, never\ndemonstrative, never exigent, only declares itself in all its profound\nsignificance when it is called upon to pardon. What was likely to be\nthe issue of a meeting with Godwin she could not foresee. It seemed all\nbut impossible for their intercourse to continue, and their coming face\nto face might result in nothing but distress to both, better avoided;\nyet judgment yielded to emotion. Yesterday--only yesterday--she had\nyielded herself to the joy of loving, and before her consciousness had\nhad time to make itself familiar with its new realm, before her eyes\nhad grown accustomed to the light suddenly shed about her, she was\nbidden to think of what had happened as only a dream. Her heart refused\nto make surrender of its hope. Though it could be held only by an\nencouragement of recognised illusion, she preferred to dream yet a\nlittle longer. Above all, she must taste the luxury of forgiving her\nlover, of making sure that her image would not dwell in his mind as\nthat of a self-righteous woman who had turned coldly from his error,\nperhaps from his repentance.\n\nA little after midnight, she rose from bed, slipped on her\ndressing-gown, and sat down by the still burning lamp to write what her\npassion dictated:\n\n\n'Why should you distrust my ability, or my willingness to understand\nyou? It would have been so much better if you had sent what you first\nwrote. These few lines do not even let me know whether you think\nyourself to blame. Why do you leave me to form a judgment of things as\nthey appear on the surface? If you _wish_ to explain, if you sincerely\nfeel that I am in danger of wronging you by misconstruction, come to me\nas soon as you have received this note. If you will not come, then at\nleast write to me--the letter you at first thought of sending. This\nafternoon (Friday) I return to London, but you know my address there.\nDon't think because I wrote so briefly that I have judged you.\n\nS. W.'\n\n\nTo have committed this to paper was a relief. In the morning she would\nread it over and consider again whether she wished to send it.\n\nOn the table lay _The Critical_. She opened it once more at the page\nthat concerned her, and glanced over the first few lines. Then, having\nput the lamp nearer to the bed, she again lay down, not to sleep but to\nread.\n\nThis essay was not so repugnant to her mind or her feelings as when she\nfirst became acquainted with it. Its bitterness no longer seemed to be\ndirected against herself. There was much in it with which she could\nhave agreed at any time during the last six months, and many strokes of\nsatire, which till the other day would have offended her, she now felt\nto be legitimate. As she read on, a kind of anger such as she had never\nexperienced trembled along her nerves. Was it not flagrantly true that\nEnglish society at large made profession of a faith which in no sense\nwhatever it could be said sincerely to hold? Was there not every reason\nto believe that thousands of people keep up an ignoble formalism,\nbecause they feared the social results of declaring their severance\nfrom the religion of the churches? This was a monstrous evil; she had\nnever till this moment understood the scope of its baneful effects. But\nfor the prevalence of such a spirit of hypocrisy, Godwin Peak would\nnever have sinned against his honour. Why was it not declared in\ntrumpet-tones of authority, from end to end of the Christian world,\nthat Christianity, as it has been understood through the ages, can no\nlonger be accepted? For that was the truth, the truth, the _truth_!\n\nShe lay back, quivering as if with terror. For an instant her soul had\nbeen filled with hatred of the religion for which she could once have\ndied. It had stood before her as a power of darkness and ignorance, to\nbe assailed, crushed, driven from the memory of man.\n\nLast night she had hardly slept, and now, though her body was numb with\nweariness, her mind kept up a feverish activity. She was bent on\nexcusing Godwin, and the only way in which she could do so was by\narraigning the world for its huge dishonesty. In a condition between\nslumber and waking, she seemed to plead for him before a circle of\nPharisaic accusers. Streams of silent eloquence rushed through her\nbrain, and the spirit which prompted her was closely akin to that of\n'The New Sophistry'. Now and then, for a few seconds, she was smitten\nwith a consciousness of extraordinary change in her habits of thought.\nShe looked about her with wide, fearful eyes, and endeavoured to see\nthings in the familiar aspect. As if with physical constraint her angry\nimagination again overcame her, until at length from the penumbra of\nsleep she passed into its profoundest gloom.\n\nTo wake when dawn was pale at the window. A choking odour reminded her\nthat she had not extinguished the lamp, which must have gone out for\nlack of oil. She opened the window, took a draught of water, and\naddressed herself to sleep again. But in recollecting what the new day\nmeant for her, she had spoilt the chances of longer rest. Her head\nached; all worldly thoughts were repulsive, yet she could not dismiss\nthem. She tried to repeat the prayers she had known since childhood,\nbut they were meaningless, and a sense of shame attached to their\nutterance.\n\nWhen the first gleam of sun told her that it was past eight o clock,\nshe made an effort and rose.\n\nAt breakfast Mrs. Warricombe talked of the departure for London. She\nmentioned an early train; by getting ready as soon as the meal was\nover, they could easily reach the station in time. Sidwell made no\ndirect reply and seemed to assent; but when they rose from the table,\nshe said, nervously:\n\n'I couldn't speak before the servants. I wish to stay here till the\nafternoon.'\n\n'Why, Sidwell?'\n\n'I have asked Mr. Peak to come and see me this morning.'\n\nHer mother knew that expostulation was useless, but could not refrain\nfrom a long harangue made up of warning and reproof.\n\n'You have very little consideration for me,' was her final remark. 'Now\nwe shan't get home till after dark, and of course my throat will be bad\nagain.'\n\nGlad of the anti-climax, Sidwell replied that the day was much warmer,\nand that with care no harm need come of the journey.\n\n'It's easy to say that, Sidwell. I never knew you to behave so\nselfishly, never!'\n\n'Don't be angry with me, mother. You don't know how grieved I am to\ndistress you so. I can't help it, dear; indeed, I can't. Won't you\nsacrifice a few hours to put my mind at rest?'\n\nMrs. Warricombe once more gave expression to her outraged feelings.\nSidwell could only listen silently with bent head.\n\nIf Godwin were coming at all, he would be here by eleven o'clock.\nSidwell had learnt that her letter was put into his hands. She asked\nhim to come at once, and nothing but a resolve not to meet her could\ndelay him more than an hour or two.\n\nAt half-past ten the bell sounded. She was sitting in the library with\nher back turned to the door. When a voice announced 'Mr. Peak', she did\nnot at once rise, and with a feeling akin to terror she heard the\nfootstep slowly approaching. It stopped at some distance from her;\nthen, overcoming a weakness which threatened to clog her as in a\nnightmare, she stood up and looked round.\n\nPeak wore neither overcoat nor gloves, but otherwise was dressed in the\nusual way. As Sidwell fixed her eyes upon him, he threw his hat into a\nchair and came a step or two nearer. Whether he had passed the night in\nsleep or vigil could not be determined; but his look was one of shame,\nand he did not hold himself so upright as was his wont.\n\n'Will you come and sit down?' said Sidwell, pointing to a chair not far\nfrom that on which one of her hands rested.\n\nHe moved forward, and was about to pass near her, when Sidwell\ninvoluntarily held her hand to him. He took it and gazed into her face\nwith a melancholy smile.\n\n'What does it mean?' she asked, in a low voice.\n\nHe relinquished her fingers, which he had scarcely pressed, and stood\nwith his arms behind his back.\n\n'Oh, it's all quite true,' was his reply, wearily spoken.\n\n'What is true?'\n\n'All that you have heard from your brother.'\n\n'All?--But how can you know what he has said?'\n\nThey looked at each other. Peak's lips were set as if in resistance of\nemotion, and a frown wrinkled his brows. Sidwell's gaze was one of fear\nand appeal.\n\n'He said, of course, that I had deceived you.'\n\n'But in what?--Was there no truth in anything you said to me?'\n\n'To you I have spoken far more truth than falsehood.'\n\nA light shone in her eyes, and her lips quivered.\n\n'Then,' she murmured, 'Buckland was not right in everything.'\n\n'I understand. He wished you to believe that my love was as much a\npretence as my religion?'\n\n'He said that.'\n\n'It was natural enough.--And you were disposed to believe it?'\n\n'I thought it impossible. But I should have thought the same of the\nother things.'\n\nPeak nodded, and moved away. Watching him, Sidwell was beset with\nconflicting impulses. His assurance had allayed her worst misgiving,\nand she approved the self-restraint with which he bore himself, but at\nthe same time she longed for a passionate declaration. As a reasoning\nwoman, she did her utmost to remember that Peak was on his defence\nbefore her, and that nothing could pass between them but grave\ndiscussion of the motives which had impelled him to dishonourable\nbehaviour. As a woman in love, she would fain have obscured the moral\nissue by indulgence of her heart's desire. She was glad that he held\naloof, but if he had taken her in his arms, she would have forgotten\neverything in the moment's happiness.\n\n'Let us sit down, and tell me--tell me all you can.'\n\nHe delayed a moment, then seated himself opposite to her. She saw now\nthat his movements were those of physical fatigue; and the full light\nfrom the window, enabling her to read his face more distinctly,\nrevealed the impress of suffering. Instead of calling upon him to atone\nin such measure as was possible for the wrong he had done her, she felt\nready to reproach herself for speaking coldly when his need of solace\nwas so great.\n\n'What can I tell you,' he said, 'that you don't know, or that you can't\nconjecture?'\n\n'But you wrote that there was so much I could not be expected to\nunderstand. And I can't, can't understand you. It still seems\nimpossible. Why did you hide the truth from me?'\n\n'Because if I had begun by telling it, I should never have won a kind\nlook or a kind thought from you.'\n\nSidwell reflected.\n\n'But what did you care for me then--when it began?'\n\n'Not so much as I do now, but enough to overthrow all the results of my\nlife up to that time. Before I met you in this house I had seen you\ntwice, and had learned who you were. I was sitting in the Cathedral\nwhen you came there with your sister and Miss Moorhouse--do you\nremember? I heard Fanny call you by your name, and that brought to my\nmind a young girl whom I had known in a slight way years before. And\nthe next day I again saw you there, at the service; I waited about the\nentrance only to see you. I cared enough for you then to conceive a\ndesign which for a long time seemed too hateful really to be carried\nout, but--at last it was, you see.\n\nSidwell breathed quickly. Nothing he could have urged for himself would\nhave affected her more deeply than this. To date back and extend the\nperiod of his love for her was a flattery more subtle than Peak\nimagined.\n\n'Why didn't you tell me that the day before yesterday?' she asked, with\ntremulous bosom.\n\n'I had no wish to remind myself of baseness in the midst of a pure joy.'\n\nShe was silent, then exclaimed, in accents of pain:\n\n'Why should you have thought it necessary to be other than yourself?\nCouldn't you see, at first meeting with us, that we were not bigoted\npeople? Didn't you know that Buckland had accustomed us to understand\nhow common it is nowadays for people to throw off the old religion?\nWould father have looked coldly on you if he had known that you\nfollowed where so many good and thoughtful men were leading?'\n\nHe regarded her anxiously.\n\n'I had heard from Buckland that your father was strongly prejudiced;\nthat you also were quite out of sympathy with the new thought.'\n\n'He exaggerated--even then.'\n\n'Exaggerated? But on what plea could I have come to live in this\nneighbourhood? How could I have kept you in sight--tried to win your\ninterest? I had no means, no position. The very thought of encouraging\nmy love for you demanded some extraordinary step. What course was open\nto me?'\n\nSidwell let her head droop.\n\n'I don't know. You might perhaps have discovered a way.'\n\n'But what was the use, when the mere fact of my heresy would have\nforbidden hope from the outset?'\n\n'Why should it have done so?'\n\n'Why? You know very well that you could never even have been friendly\nwith the man who wrote that thing in the review.'\n\n'But here is the proof how much better it is to behave truthfully! In\nthis last year I have changed so much that I find it difficult to\nunderstand the strength of my former prejudices. What is it to me now\nthat you speak scornfully of attempts to reconcile things that can't be\nreconciled? I understand the new thought, and how natural it is for you\nto accept it. If only I could have come to know you well, your opinions\nwould not have stood between us.'\n\nPeak made a slight gesture, and smiled incredulously.\n\n'You think so now.'\n\n'And I have such good reason for my thought,' rejoined Sidwell,\nearnestly, 'that when you said you loved me, my only regret in looking\nto the future was--that you had resolved to be a clergyman.'\n\nHe leaned back in the chair, and let a hand fall on his knee. The\ngesture seemed to signify a weary relinquishment of concern in what\nthey were discussing.\n\n'How could I foresee that?' he uttered, in a corresponding tone.\n\nSidwell was made uneasy by the course upon which she had entered. To\nwhat did her words tend? If only to a demonstration that fate had used\nhim as the plaything of its irony--if, after all, she had nothing to\nsay to him but 'See how your own folly has ruined you', then she had\nbetter have kept silence. She not only appeared to be offering him\nencouragement, but was in truth doing so. She wished him to understand\nthat his way of thinking was no obstacle to her love, and with that\npurpose she was even guilty of a slight misrepresentation. For it was\nonly since the shock of this disaster that she had clearly recognised\nthe change in her own mind. True, the regret of which she spoke had for\nan instant visited her, but it represented a mundane solicitude rather\nthan an intellectual scruple. It had occurred to her how much brighter\nwould be their prospect if Peak were but an active man of the world,\nwith a career before him distinctly suited to his powers.\n\nHis contention was undeniably just. The influence to which she had from\nthe first submitted was the same that her father felt so strongly.\nGodwin interested her as a self-reliant champion of the old faiths, and\nhis personal characteristics would never have awakened such sympathy in\nher but for that initial recommendation. Natural prejudice would have\nprevented her from perceiving the points of kindred between his\ntemperament and her own. His low origin, the ridiculous stories\nconnected with his youth--why had she, in spite of likelihood, been\nable to disregard these things? Only because of what she then deemed\nhis spiritual value.\n\nBut for the dishonourable part he had played, this bond of love would\nnever have been formed between them. The thought was a new apology for\nhis transgression; she could not but defy her conscience, and look\nindulgently on the evil which had borne such fruit.\n\nGodwin had begun to speak again.\n\n'This is quite in keeping with the tenor of my whole life. Whatever I\nundertake ends in frustration at a point where success seems to have\njust come within my reach. Great things and trifles--it's all the same.\nMy course at College was broken off at the moment when I might have\nassured my future. Later, I made many an effort to succeed in\nliterature, and when at length something of mine was printed in a\nleading review, I could not even sign it, and had no profit from the\nattention it excited. Now--well, you see. Laughable, isn't it?'\n\nSidwell scarcely withheld herself from bending forward and giving him\nher hand.\n\n'What shall you do?' she asked.\n\n'Oh, I am not afraid. I have still enough money left to support me\nuntil I can find some occupation of the old kind. Fortunately, I am not\none of those men whose brains have no marketable value.'\n\n'If you knew how it pains me to hear you!'\n\n'If I didn't believe that, I couldn't speak to you like this. I never\nthought you would let me see you again, and if you hadn't asked me to\ncome, I could never have brought myself to face you. But it would have\nbeen a miserable thing to go off without even knowing what you thought\nof me.'\n\n'Should you never have written to me?'\n\n'I think not. You find it hard to imagine that I have any pride, no\ndoubt; but it is there, explain it how one may.'\n\n'It would have been wrong to leave me in such uncertainty.'\n\n'Uncertainty?'\n\n'About you--about your future.'\n\n'Did you quite mean that? Hadn't your brother made you doubt whether I\nloved you at all?'\n\n'Yes. But no, I didn't doubt. Indeed, indeed, I didn't doubt! But I\nfelt such a need of hearing from your own lips that--Oh, I can't\nexplain myself!'\n\nGodwin smiled sadly.\n\n'I think I understand. But there was every reason for my believing that\n_your_ love could not bear such a test. You must regard me as quite a\ndifferent man--one utterly unknown to you.'\n\nHe had resolved to speak not a word that could sound like an appeal to\nher emotions. When he entered the room he felt a sincere indifference\nas to what would result from the interview, for to his mind the story\nwas ended, and he had only to retire with the dignity still possible to\na dishonoured man. To touch the note of pathos would be unworthy; to\nexert what influence might be left to him, a wanton cruelty. But he had\nheard such unexpected things, that it was not easy for him to remember\nhow complete had seemed the severance between him and Sidwell. The\ncharm of her presence was reasserting itself, and when avowal of\ncontinued love appeared so unmistakably in her troubled countenance,\nher broken words, he could not control the answering fervour. He spoke\nin a changed voice, and allowed his eyes to dwell longingly upon hers.\n\n'I felt so at first,' she answered. 'And it would be wrong to pretend\nthat I can still regard you as I did before.'\n\nIt cost her a great effort to add these words. When they were spoken,\nshe was at once glad and fearful.\n\n'I am not so foolish, as to think it possible,' said Peak, half turning\naway.\n\n'But that is no reason,' she pursued, 'why we should become strangers.\nYou are still so young a man; life must be so full of possibilities for\nyou. This year has been wasted, but when you leave Exeter'----\n\nAn impatient movement of Godwin's checked her.\n\n'You are going to encourage me to begin the struggle once more,' he\nsaid, bitterly. 'Where? How? It is so easy to talk of \"possibilities\".'\n\n'You are not without friends--I mean friends whose sympathy is of real\nvalue to you.'\n\nSaying this, she looked keenly at him.\n\n'Friends,' he replied, 'who perhaps at this moment are laughing over my\ndisgrace.'\n\n'How do they know of--what has happened?'\n\n'How did your brother get his information? I didn't care to ask\nhim.--No, I don't even wish you to say anything about that.'\n\n'But surely there is no reason for keeping it secret. Why may I not\nspeak freely? Buckland told me that he had heard you spoken of at the\nhouse of people named Moxey.'\n\nShe endeavoured to understand the smile which rose to his lips. 'Now it\nis clear to me,' he said. 'Yes, I suppose that was inevitable, sooner\nor later.'\n\n'You knew that he had become acquainted with the Moxeys?'\n\nHer tone was more reserved than hitherto.\n\n'Yes, I knew he had. He met Miss Moxey by chance at Budleigh Salterton,\nand I happened to be there--at the Moorhouses'--on the same day.'\n\nSidwell glanced at him inquiringly, and waited for something more.\n\n'I saw Miss Moxey in private,' he added, speaking more quickly, 'and\nasked her to keep my secret. I ought to be ashamed to tell you this,\nbut it is better you should know how far my humiliation has gone.'\n\nHe saw that she was moved with strong feeling. The low tone in which\nshe answered had peculiar significance.\n\n'Did you speak of me to Miss Moxey?'\n\n'I must forgive you for asking that,' Peak replied, coldly. 'It may\nwell seem to you that I have neither honour nor delicacy left.'\n\nThere had come a flush on her cheeks. For some moments she was absorbed\nin thought.\n\n'It seems strange to you,' he continued at length, 'that I could ask\nMiss Moxey to share such a secret. But you must understand on what\nterms we were--she and I. We have known each other for several years.\nShe has a man's mind, and I have always thought of her in much the same\nway as of my male companions.--Your brother has told you about her,\nperhaps?'\n\n'I have met her in London.'\n\n'Then that will make my explanation easier,' said Godwin, disregarding\nthe anxious questions that at once suggested themselves to him. 'Well,\nI misled her, or tried to do so. I allowed her to suppose that I was\nsincere in my new undertakings, and that I didn't wish--Oh!' he\nexclaimed, suddenly breaking off, 'Why need I go any further in\nconfession? It must be as miserable for you to hear as for me to speak.\nLet us make an end of it. I can't understand how I have escaped\ndetection so long.'\n\nRemembering every detail of Buckland's story, Sidwell felt that she had\npossibly been unjust in representing the Moxeys as her brother's\nauthority; in strictness, she ought to mention that a friend of theirs\nwas the actual source of information. But she could not pursue the\nsubject; like Godwin, she wished to put it out of her mind. What\nquestion could there be of honour or dishonour in the case of a person\nsuch as Miss Moxey, who had consented to be party to a shameful deceit?\nStrangely, it was a relief to her to have heard this. The moral\nrepugnance which threatened to estrange her from Godwin, was now\ndirected in another quarter; unduly restrained by love, it found scope\nunder the guidance of jealousy.\n\n'You have been trying to adapt yourself,' she said, 'to a world for\nwhich you are by nature unfitted. Your place is in the new order; by\nturning back to the old, you condemned yourself to a wasted life. Since\nwe have been in London, I have come to understand better the great\ndifference between modern intellectual life and that which we lead in\nthese far-away corners. You must go out among your equals, go and take\nyour part with men who are working for the future.'\n\nPeak rose with a gesture of passionate impatience.\n\n'What is it to me, new world or old? My world is where _you_ are. I\nhave no life of my own; I think only of you, live only by you.'\n\n'If I could help you!' she replied, with emotion. 'What can I do--but\nbe your friend at a distance? Everything else has become impossible.'\n\n'Impossible for the present--for a long time to come. But is there no\nhope for me?'\n\nShe pressed her hands together, and stood before him unable to answer.\n'Remember,' he continued, 'that you are almost as much changed in my\neyes as I in yours. I did not imagine that you had moved so far towards\nfreedom of mind. If my love for you was profound and absorbing, think\nwhat it must now have become! Yours has suffered by my disgrace, but is\nthere no hope of its reviving--if I live worthily--if I----?'\n\nHis voice failed.\n\n'I have said that we can't be strangers,' Sidwell murmured brokenly.\n'Wherever you go, I must hear of you.'\n\n'Everyone about you will detest my name. You will soon wish to forget\nmy existence.'\n\n'If I know myself, never!--Oh, try to find your true work! You have\nsuch abilities, powers so much greater than those of ordinary men. You\nwill always be the same to me, and if ever circumstances'----\n\n'You would have to give up so much, Sidwell. And there is little chance\nof my ever being well-to-do; poverty will always stand between us, if\nnothing else.'\n\n'It must be so long before we can think of that.'\n\n'But can I ever see you?--No, I won't ask that. Who knows? I may have\nto go too far away. But I _may_ write to you--after a time?'\n\n'I shall live in the hope of good news from you,' she replied, trying\nto smile and to speak cheerfully. 'This will always be my home. Nothing\nwill be changed.'\n\n'Then you don't think of me as irredeemably base?'\n\n'If I thought you base,' Sidwell answered, in a low voice, 'I should\nnot now be speaking with you. It is because I feel and know that you\nhave erred only--that is what makes it impossible for me to think of\nyour fault as outweighing the good in your nature.'\n\n'The good? I wonder how you understand that. What is there _good_ in\nme? You don't mean mere intellect?'\n\nHe waited anxiously for what she would say. A necessity for speaking\nout his inmost thoughts had arisen with the emotion, scarcely to be\ncalled hope, excited by Sidwell's magnanimity. Now, or never, he must\nstand before this woman as his very self, and be convinced that she\nloved him for his own sake.\n\n'No, I don't mean intellect,' she replied, with hesitation.\n\n'What then? Tell me of one quality in me strong enough to justify a\nwoman's love.'\n\nSidwell dropped her eyes in confusion.\n\n'I can't analyse your character--I only know'----\n\nShe became silent.\n\n'To myself,' pursued Godwin, with the modulated, moving voice which\nalways expressed his genuine feeling, 'I seem anything but lovable. I\ndon't underrate my powers--rather the opposite, no doubt; but what I\nalways seem to lack is the gift of pleasing--moral grace. My strongest\nemotions seem to be absorbed in revolt; for once that I feel tenderly,\nI have a hundred fierce, resentful, tempestuous moods. To be suave and\nsmiling in common intercourse costs me an effort. I have to act the\npart, and this habit makes me sceptical, whenever I am really prompted\nto gentleness. I criticise myself ceaselessly; expose without mercy all\nthose characteristics which another man would keep out of sight. Yes,\nand for this very reason, just because I think myself unlovable--the\ngift of love means far more to me than to other men. If you could\nconceive the passion of gratitude which possessed me for hours after I\nleft you the other day! You cannot!'\n\nSidwell regarded him fixedly.\n\n'In comparison with this sincerity, what becomes of the pretence you\nblame in me? If you knew how paltry it seems--that accusation of\ndishonesty! I believed the world round, and pretended to believe it\nflat: that's what it amounts to! Are you, on such an account as that,\nto consider worthless the devotion which has grown in me month by\nmonth? You--I was persuaded--thought the world flat, and couldn't think\nkindly of any man who held the other hypothesis. Very well; why not\nconcede the trifle, and so at least give myself a chance? I did\nso--that was all.'\n\nIn vain her conscience strove to assert itself. She was under the spell\nof a nature infinitely stronger than hers; she saw and felt as Godwin\ndid.\n\n'You think, Sidwell, that I stand in need of forgiveness. Then be great\nenough to forgive me, wholly--once and for all. Let your love be\nstrengthened by the trial it has passed through. That will mean that my\nwhole life is yours, directed by the ever-present thought of your\nbeauty, face and soul. Then there _will_ be good in me, thanks to you.\nI shall no longer live a life of hypocrisy, of suppressed rage and\nscorn. I know how much I am asking; perhaps it means that for my sake\nyou give up everything else that is dear to you'----\n\nThe thought checked him. He looked at her despondently.\n\n'You can trust me,' Sidwell answered, moving nearer to him, tears on\nher cheeks. 'I must hear from you, and I will write.'\n\n'I can ask no more than that.'\n\nHe took her hands, held them for a moment, and turned away. At the door\nhe looked round. Sidwell's head was bowed, and, on her raising it, he\nsaw that she was blinded with tears.\n\nSo he went forth.\n\n\n\n\nPart VI\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nFor several days after the scene in which Mr. Malkin unconsciously\nplayed an important part, Marcella seemed to be ill. She appeared at\nmeals, but neither ate nor conversed. Christian had never known her so\nsullen and nervously irritable; he did not venture to utter Peak's\nname. Upon seclusion followed restless activity. Marcella was rarely at\nhome between breakfast and dinner-time, and her brother learnt with\nsatisfaction that she went much among her acquaintances. Late one\nevening, when he had just returned from he knew not where, Christian\ntried to put an end to the unnatural constraint between them. After\ntalking cheerfully for a few minutes, he risked the question:\n\n'Have you seen anything of the Warricombes?'\n\nShe replied with a cold negative.\n\n'Nor heard anything?'\n\n'No. Have you?'\n\n'Nothing at all. I have seen Earwaker. Malkin had told him about what\nhappened here the other day.'\n\n'Of course.'\n\n'But he had no news.--Of Peak, I mean.'\n\nMarcella smiled, as if the situation amused her; but she would not\ndiscuss it. Christian began to hope that she was training herself to a\nwholesome indifference.\n\nA month of the new year went by, and Peak seemed to be forgotten.\nMarcella had returned to her studious habits, was fenced around with\nbooks, seldom left the house. Another month and the brother and sister\nwere living very much in the old way, seeing few people, conversing\nonly of intellectual things. But Christian concealed an expectation\nwhich enabled him to pass hours of retirement in the completest\nidleness. Since the death of her husband, Mrs. Palmer had been living\nabroad. Before the end of March, as he had been careful to discover,\nshe would be back in London, at the house in Sussex Square. By that\ntime he might venture, without indelicacy, to call upon her. And after\nthe first interview----\n\nThe day came, when, ill with agitation, he set forth to pay this call.\nFor two or three nights he had scarcely closed his eyes; he looked\nghastly. The weather was execrable, and on that very account he made\nchoice of this afternoon, hoping that he might find his widowed Laura\nalone. Between ringing the bell and the opening of the door, he could\nhardly support himself. He asked for Mrs. Palmer in a gasping voice\nwhich caused the servant to look at him with surprise.\n\nThe lady was at home. At the drawing-room door, before his name could\nbe announced, he caught the unwelcome sound of voices in lively\nconversation. It seemed to him that a score of persons were assembled.\nIn reality there were six, three of them callers.\n\nMrs. Palmer met him with the friendliest welcome. A stranger would have\nthought her pretty, but by no means impressive. She was short, anything\nbut meagre, fair-haired, brisk of movement, idly vivacious in look and\ntone. The mourning she wore imposed no restraint upon her humour, which\nat present was not far from gay.\n\n'Is it really Mr. Moxey?' she exclaimed. 'Why, I had all but forgotten\nyou, and positively it is your own fault! It must be a year or more\nsince you came to see me. No? Eight months?--But I have been through so\nmuch trouble, you know.' She sighed mechanically. 'I thought of you one\nday at Bordighera, when we were looking at some funny little\nsea-creatures--the kind of thing you used to know all about. How is\nyour sister?'\n\nA chill struck upon his heart. Assuredly he had no wish to find\nConstance sunk in the semblance of dolour; such hypocrisy would have\npained him. But her sprightliness was a shock. Though months had passed\nsince Mr. Palmer's decease, a decent gravity would more have become her\ncondition. He could reply only in broken phrases, and it was a relief\nto him when the widow, as if tiring of his awkwardness, turned her\nattention elsewhere.\n\nHe was at length able to survey the company. Two ladies in mourning he\nfaintly recognised, the one a sister of Mr. Palmer's, comely but of\ndull aspect; the other a niece, whose laugh was too frequent even had\nit been more musical, and who talked of athletic sports with a young\nman evidently better fitted to excel in that kind of thing than in any\npursuit demanding intelligence. This gentleman Christian had never met.\nThe two other callers, a grey-headed, military-looking person, and a\nlady, possibly his wife, were equally strangers to him.\n\nThe drawing-room was much changed in appearance since Christian's last\nvisit. There was more display, a richer profusion of ornaments not in\nthe best taste. The old pictures had given place to showily-framed\ndaubs of the most popular school. On a little table at his elbow, he\nremarked the photograph of a jockey who was just then engrossing public\naffection. What did all this mean? Formerly, he had attributed every\ngraceful feature of the room to Constance's choice. He had imagined\nthat to her Mr. Palmer was indebted for guidance on points of aesthetic\npropriety. Could it be that----?\n\nHe caught a glance which she cast in his direction, and instantly\nforgot the troublesome problem. How dull of him to misunderstand her!\nHer sportiveness had a double significance. It was the expression of a\nhope which would not be subdued, and at the same time a means of\ndisguising the tender interest with which she regarded _him_. If she\nhad been blithe before his appearance, how could she suddenly change\nher demeanour as soon as he entered? It would have challenged suspicion\nand remark. For the same reason she affected to have all but forgotten\nhim. Of course! how could he have failed to see that? 'I thought of you\none day at Bordighera'--was not that the best possible way of making\nknown to him that he had never been out of her mind?\n\nSweet, noble, long-suffering Constance!\n\nHe took a place by her sister, and began to talk of he knew not what,\nfor all his attention was given to the sound of Constance's voice.\n\n'Yes,' she was saying to the man of military appearance, 'it's very\nearly to come back to London, but I did get so tired of those foreign\nplaces.'\n\n(In other words, of being far from her Christian--thus he interpreted.)\n\n'No, we didn't make a single pleasant acquaintance. A shockingly\ntiresome lot of people wherever we went.'\n\n(In comparison with the faithful lover, who waited, waited.)\n\n'Foreigners are so stupid--don't you think so? Why should they always\nexpect you to speak _their_ language?--Oh, of course I speak French;\nbut it is such a disagreeable language--don't you think so?'\n\n(Compared with the accents of English devotion, of course.)\n\n'Do you go in for cycling, Mr. Moxey?' inquired Mrs. Palmer's laughing\nniece, from a little distance.\n\n'For cycling?' With a great effort he recovered himself and grasped the\nmeaning of the words. 'No, I--I'm sorry to say I don't. Capital\nexercise!'\n\n'Mr. Dwight has just been telling me such an awfully good story about a\nfriend of his. Do tell it again, Mr. Dwight! It'll make you laugh no\nend, Mr. Moxey.'\n\nThe young man appealed to was ready enough to repeat his anecdote,\nwhich had to do with a bold cyclist, who, after dining more than well,\nrode his machine down a steep hill and escaped destruction only by\nmiracle. Christian laughed desperately, and declared that he had never\nheard anything so good.\n\nBut the tension of his nerves was unendurable. Five minutes more of\nanguish, and he sprang up like an automaton.\n\n'Must you really go, Mr. Moxey?' said Constance, with a manner which of\ncourse was intended to veil her emotion. 'Please don't be another year\nbefore you let us see you again.'\n\nBlessings on her tender heart! What more could she have said, in the\npresence of all those people? He walked all the way to Notting Hill\nthrough a pelting rain, his passion aglow.\n\nImpossible to be silent longer concerning the brilliant future. Arrived\nat home, he flung off hat and coat, and went straight to the\ndrawing-room, hoping to find Marcella alone. To his annoyance, a\nstranger was sitting there in conversation, a very simply dressed lady,\nwho, as he entered, looked at him with a grave smile and stood up. He\nthought he had never seen her before.\n\nMarcella wore a singular expression; there was a moment of silence, for\nChristian decidedly embarrassing, since it seemed to be expected that\nhe should greet the stranger.\n\n'Don't you remember Janet?' said his sister.\n\n'Janet?' He felt his face flush. 'You don't mean to say--? But how you\nhave altered! And yet, no; really, you haven't. It's only my\nstupidity.' He grasped her hand, and with a feeling of genuine\npleasure, despite awkward reminiscences.\n\n'One does alter in eleven years,' said Janet Moxey, in a very pleasant,\nnatural voice--a voice of habitual self-command, conveying the idea of\na highly cultivated mind, and many other agreeable things.\n\n'Eleven years? Yes, yes! How very glad I am to see you! And I'm sure\nMarcella was. How very kind of you to call on us!'\n\nJanet was as far as ever from looking handsome or pretty, but it must\nhave been a dullard who proclaimed her face unpleasing. She had eyes of\nremarkable intelligence, something like Marcella's but milder, more\nbenevolent. Her lips were softly firm; they would not readily part in\nlaughter; their frequent smile meant more than that of the woman who\nsets herself to be engaging.\n\n'I am on my way home,' she said, 'from a holiday in the South,--an\nenforced holiday, I'm sorry to say.'\n\n'You have been ill?'\n\n'Overworked a little. I am practising medicine in Kingsmill.'\n\nChristian did not disguise his astonishment.\n\n'Medicine?'\n\n'You don't remember that I always had scientific tastes?'\n\nIf it was a reproach, none could have been more gently administered.\n\n'Of course--of course I do! Your botany, your skeletons of birds and\ncats and mice--of course! But where did you study?'\n\n'In London. The Women's Medical School. I have been in practice for\nnearly four years.'\n\n'And have overworked yourself.--But why are we standing? Let us sit\ndown and talk. How is your father?'\n\nMarcella was watching her brother closely, and with a curious smile.\n\nJanet remained for another hour. No reference was made to the long\nrupture of intercourse between her family and these relatives.\nChristian learnt that his uncle was still hale, and that Janet's four\nsisters all lived, obviously unmarried. To-day he was disposed to be\nalmost affectionate with anyone who showed him a friendly face: he\nexpressed grief that his cousin must leave for Twybridge early in the\nmorning.\n\n'Whenever you pass through the Midlands,' was Janet's indirect reply,\naddressed to Marcella, 'try to stop at Kingsmill.'\n\nAnd a few minutes after that she took her leave. There lingered behind\nher that peculiar fragrance of modern womanhood, refreshing,\ninspiriting, which is so entirely different from the merely feminine\nperfume, however exquisite.\n\n'What a surprising visit!' was Christian's exclamation, when he and his\nsister were alone. 'How did she find us?'\n\n'Directory, I suppose.'\n\n'A lady doctor!' he mused.\n\n'And a very capable one, I fancy,' said Marcella. 'We had nearly an\nhour's talk before you came. But she won't be able to stand the work.\nThere'll be another breakdown before long.'\n\n'Has she a large practice, then?'\n\n'Not very large, perhaps; but she studies as well. I never dreamt of\nJanet becoming so interesting a person.'\n\nChristian had to postpone till after dinner the talk he purposed about\nMrs. Palmer. When that time came, he was no longer disposed for\nsentimental confessions; it would be better to wait until he could\nannounce a settled project of marriage. Through the evening, his sister\nrecurred to the subject of Janet with curious frequency, and on the\nfollowing day her interest had suffered no diminution. Christian had\nalways taken for granted that she understood the grounds of the breach\nbetween him and his uncle; without ever unbosoming himself, he had\noccasionally, in his softer moments, alluded to the awkward subject in\nlanguage which he thought easy enough to interpret. Now at length, in\nreply to some remark of Marcella's, he said with significant accent:\n\n'Janet was very friendly to me.'\n\n'She has studied science for ten years,' was his sister's comment.\n\n'Yes, and can forgive a boy's absurdities.'\n\n'Easier to forgive, certainly, than those of a man,' said Marcella,\nwith a curl of the lip.\n\nChristian became silent, and went thoughtfully away.\n\nA week later, he was again in Mrs. Palmer's drawing-room, where again\nhe met an assemblage of people such as seemed to profane this\nsanctuary. To be sure--he said to himself--Constance could not at once\nget rid of the acquaintances forced upon her by her husband; little by\nlittle she would free herself. It was a pity that her sister and her\nniece--persons anything but intelligent and refined--should be\npermanent members of her household; for their sake, no doubt, she felt\nconstrained to welcome men and women for whose society she herself had\nlittle taste. But when the year of her widowhood was past----Petrarch's\nLaura was the mother of eleven children; Constance had had only three,\nand one of these was dead. The remaining two, Christian now learnt,\nlived with a governess in a little house at Bournemouth, which Mrs.\nPalmer had taken for that purpose.\n\n'I'm going down to see them to-morrow,' she informed Christian, 'and I\nshall stay there over the next day. It's so quiet and restful.'\n\nThese words kept repeating themselves to Christian's ear, as he went\nhome, and all through the evening. Were they not an invitation? Down\nthere at Bournemouth, Constance would be alone the day after to-morrow.\n'It is so quiet and restful;' that was to say, no idle callers would\nbreak upon her retirement; she would be able to welcome a friend, and\ntalk reposefully with him. Surely she must have meant that; for she\nspoke with a peculiar intonation--a look----\n\nBy the second morning he had worked himself up to a persuasion that\nyonder by the seaside Constance was expecting him. To miss the\nopportunity would be to prove himself dull of apprehension, a laggard\nin love. With trembling hands, he hurried through his toilet and made\nhaste downstairs to examine a railway time-table. He found it was\npossible to reach Bournemouth by about two o'clock, a very convenient\nhour; it would allow him to take refreshment, and walk to the house\nshortly after three.\n\nHis conviction strong as ever, he came to the journey's end, and in due\ncourse discovered the pleasant little house of which Constance had\nspoken. At the door, his heart failed him; but retreat could not now be\nthought of. Yes, Mrs. Palmer was at home. The servant led him into a\nsitting-room on the ground floor, took his name, and left him.\n\nIt was nearly ten minutes before Constance appeared. On her face he\nread a frank surprise.\n\n'I happened to--to be down here; couldn't resist the temptation'----\n\n'Delighted to see you, Mr. Moxey. But how did you know I was here?'\n\nHe gazed at her.\n\n'You--don't you remember? The day before yesterday--in Sussex\nSquare--you mentioned'----\n\n'Oh, did I?' She laughed. 'I had quite forgotten.'\n\nChristian sank upon his chair. He tried to convince himself that she\nwas playing a part; perhaps she thought that she had been premature in\nrevealing her wish to talk with him.\n\nMrs. Palmer was good-natured. This call evidently puzzled her, but she\ndid not stint her hospitality. When Christian asked after the children,\nthey were summoned; two little girls daintily dressed, pretty,\naffectionate with their mother. The sight of them tortured Christian,\nand he sighed deeply with relief when they left the room. Constance\nappeared rather absent; her quick glance at him signified something,\nbut he could not determine what. In agony of constraint, he rose as if\nto go.\n\n'Oh, you will have a cup of tea with me,' said Mrs. Palmer. 'It will be\nbrought in a few minutes.'\n\nThen she really wished him to stop. Was he not behaving like an obtuse\ncreature? Why, everything was planned to encourage him.\n\nHe talked recklessly of this and that, and got round to the years long\ngone by. When the tea came, he was reviving memories of occasions on\nwhich he and she had met as young people. Constance laughed merrily,\ndeclared she could hardly remember.\n\n'Oh, what a time ago!--But I was quite a child.'\n\n'No--indeed, no! You were a young lady, and a brilliant one.'\n\nThe tea seemed to intoxicate him. He noticed again that Constance\nglanced at him significantly. How good of her to allow him this\ndelicious afternoon!\n\n'Mr. Moxey,' she said, after meditating a little, 'why haven't you\nmarried? I should have thought you would have married long ago.'\n\nHe was stricken dumb. Her jerky laugh came as a shock upon his hearing.\n\n'Married----?'\n\n'What is there astonishing in the idea?'\n\n'But--I--how can I answer you?'\n\nThe pretty, characterless face betrayed some unusual feeling. She\nlooked at him furtively; seemed to suppress a tendency to laugh.\n\n'I mustn't pry into secrets,' she simpered.\n\n'But there is no secret!' Christian panted, laying down his teacup for\nfear he should drop it. 'Whom should I--could I have married?'\n\nConstance also put aside her cup. She was bewildered, and just a little\nabashed. With courage which came he knew not whence, Christian bent\nforward and continued speaking:\n\n'Whom could I marry after that day when I met you in the little\ndrawing-room at the Robinsons'?'\n\nShe stared in genuine astonishment, then was embarrassed.\n\n'You cannot--cannot have forgotten----?'\n\n'You surely don't mean to say, Mr. Moxey, that you have remembered? Oh,\nI'm afraid I was a shocking flirt in those days!'\n\n'But I mean _after_ your marriage--when I found you in tears'----\n\n'Please, please don't remind me!' she exclaimed, giggling nervously.\n'Oh how silly!--of me, I mean. To think that--but you are making fun of\nme, Mr. Moxey?'\n\nChristian rose and went to the window. He was not only shaken by his\ntender emotions--something very like repugnance had begun to affect\nhim. If Constance were feigning, it was in very bad taste; if she spoke\nwith sincerity--what a woman had he worshipped! It did not occur to him\nto lay the fault upon his own absurd romanticism. After eleven years'\npersistence in one point of view, he could not suddenly see the affair\nwith the eyes of common sense.\n\nHe turned and approached her again.\n\n'Do you not know, then,' he asked, with quiet dignity, 'that ever since\nthe day I speak of, I have devoted my life to the love I then felt? All\nthese years, have you not understood me?'\n\nMrs. Palmer was quite unable to grasp ideas such as these. Neither her\nreading nor her experience prepared her to understand what Christian\nmeant. Courtship of a married woman was intelligible enough to her; but\na love that feared to soil itself, a devotion from afar, encouraged by\nonly the faintest hope of reward other than the most insubstantial--of\nthat she had as little conception as any woman among the wealthy vulgar.\n\n'Do you really mean, Mr. Moxey, that you--have kept unmarried for _my_\nsake?'\n\n'You don't know that?' he asked, hoarsely.\n\n'How could I? How was I to imagine such a thing? Really, was it proper?\nHow could you expect me, Mr. Moxey----?'\n\nFor a moment she looked offended. But her real feelings were\nastonishment and amusement, not unmingled with an idle gratification.\n\n'I must ask you to pardon me,' said Christian, whose forehead gleamed\nwith moisture.\n\n'No, don't say that. I am really so sorry! What an odd mistake!'\n\n'And I have hoped in vain--since you were free----?'\n\n'Oh, you mustn't say such things! I shall never dream of marrying\nagain--never!'\n\nThere was a matter-of-fact vigour in the assertion which proved that\nMrs. Palmer spoke her genuine thought. The tone could not be\ninterpreted as devotion to her husband's memory; it meant, plainly and\nsimply, that she had had enough of marriage, and delighted in her\nfreedom.\n\nChristian could not say another word. Disillusion was complete. The\nvoice, the face, were those of as unspiritual a woman as he could\neasily have met with, and his life's story was that of a fool.\n\nHe took his hat, held out his hand, with 'Good-bye, Mrs. Palmer.' The\ncold politeness left her no choice but again to look offended, and with\nmerely a motion of the head she replied, 'Good-bye, Mr. Moxey.'\n\nAnd therewith permitted him to leave the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nOn calling at Earwaker's chambers one February evening, Malkin became\naware, from the very threshold of the outer door, that the domicile was\nnot as he had known it. With the familiar fragrance of Earwaker's\nspecial 'mixture' blended a suggestion of new upholstery. The little\nvestibule had somehow put off its dinginess, and an unwontedly\nbrilliant light from the sitting-room revealed changes of the interior\nwhich the visitor remarked with frank astonishment.\n\n'What the deuce! Has it happened at last? Are you going to be married?'\nhe cried, staring about him at unrecognised chairs, tables, and\nbookcases, at whitened ceiling and pleasantly papered walls, at\npictures and ornaments which he knew not.\n\nThe journalist shook his head, and smiled contentedly.\n\n'An idea that came to me all at once. My editorship seemed to inspire\nit.'\n\nAfter a year of waiting upon Providence, Earwaker had received the\noffer of a substantial appointment much more to his taste than those he\nhad previously held. He was now literary editor of a weekly review\nwhich made no kind of appeal to the untaught multitude.\n\n'I have decided to dwell here for the rest of my life,' he added,\nlooking round the walls. 'One must have a homestead, and this shall be\nmine; here I have set up my penates. It's a portion of space, you know;\nand what more can be said of Longleat or Chatsworth? A house I shall\nnever want, because I shall never have a wife. And on the whole I\nprefer this situation to any other. I am well within reach of\neverything urban that I care about, and as for the country, that is too\ngood to be put to common use; let it be kept for holiday. There's an\natmosphere in the old Inns that pleases me. The new flats are\ninsufferable. How can one live sandwiched between a music-hall singer\nand a female politician? For lodgings of any kind no sane man had ever\na word of approval. Reflecting on all these things, I have established\nmyself in perpetuity.'\n\n'Just what I can't do,' exclaimed Malkin, flinging himself into a\nbroad, deep, leather-covered chair. 'Yet I have leanings that way. Only\na few days ago I sat for a whole evening with the map of England open\nbefore me, wondering where would be the best place to settle down--a\nfew years hence, I mean, you know; when Bella is old enough.--That\nreminds me. Next Sunday is her birthday, and do you know what? I wish\nyou'd go down to Wrotham with me.'\n\n'Many thanks, but I think I had better not.'\n\n'Oh, but do! I want you to see how Bella is getting on. She's grown\nwonderfully since you saw her in Paris--an inch taller, I should think.\nI don't go down there very often, you know, so I notice these changes.\nReally, I think no one could be more discreet than I am, under the\ncircumstances. A friend of the family; that's all. Just dropping in for\na casual cup of tea now and then. Sunday will be a special occasion, of\ncourse. I say, what are your views about early marriage? Do you think\nseventeen too young?'\n\n'I should think seven-and-twenty much better.'\n\nMalkin broke into fretfulness.\n\n'Let me tell you, Earwaker, I don't like the way you habitually speak\nof this project of mine. Plainly, I don't like it. It's a very serious\nmatter indeed--eh? What? Why are you smiling?'\n\n'I agree with you as to its seriousness.'\n\n'Yes, yes; but in a very cynical and offensive way. It makes me\nconfoundedly uncomfortable, let me tell you. I don't think that's very\nfriendly on your part. And the fact is, if it goes on I'm very much\nafraid we shan't see so much of each other as we have done. I like you,\nEarwaker, and I respect you; I think you know that. But occasionally\nyou seem to have too little regard for one's feelings. No, I don't feel\nable to pass it over with a joke.--There! The deuce take it! I've\nbitten off the end of my pipe.'\n\nHe spat out a piece of amber, and looked ruefully at the broken stem.\n\n'Take a cigar,' said Earwaker, fetching a box from a cupboard.\n\n'I don't mind.--Well--what was I saying? Oh yes; I was quarrelling with\nyou. Now, look here, what fault have you to find with Bella Jacox?'\n\n'None whatever. She seemed to me a very amiable child.'\n\n'Child! Pooh! pshaw! And fifteen next Sunday, I tell you. She's a young\nlady, and to tell you the confounded plain truth, I'm in love with her.\nI am, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. If you smile, we shall\nquarrel. I warn you, Earwaker, we shall quarrel.'\n\nThe journalist, instead of smiling, gave forth his deepest laugh.\nMalkin turned very red, scowled, and threw his cigar aside.\n\n'You really wish me to go on Sunday?' Earwaker asked, in a pleasant\nvoice.\n\nThe other's countenance immediately cleared.\n\n'I shall take it as a great kindness. Mrs. Jacox will be delighted.\nMeet me at Holborn Viaduct at 1.25. No, to make sure I'll come here at\none o'clock.'\n\nIn a few minutes he was chatting as unconcernedly as ever.\n\n'Talking of settling down, my brother Tom and his wife are on the point\nof going to New Zealand. Necessity of business; may be out there for\nthe rest of their lives. Do you know that I shall think very seriously\nof following them some day? With Bella, you know. The fact of the\nmatter is, I don't believe I could ever make a solid home in England.\nWhy, I can't quite say; partly, I suppose, because I have nothing to\ndo. Now there's a good deal to be said for going out to the colonies. A\nman feels that he is helping the spread of civilisation; and that's\nsomething, you know. I should compare myself with the Greek and Roman\ncolonists--something inspiriting in that thought--what? Why shouldn't I\nfound a respectable newspaper, for instance? Yes, I shall think very\nseriously of this.'\n\n'You wouldn't care to run over with your relatives, just to have a\nlook?'\n\n'It occurred to me,' Malkin replied, thoughtfully. 'But they sail in\nten days, and--well, I'm afraid I couldn't get ready in time. And then\nI've promised to look after some little affairs for Mrs. Jacox--some\ntrifling money matters. But later in the year--who knows?'\n\nEarwaker half repented of his promise to visit the Jacox household, but\nthere was no possibility of excusing himself. So on Sunday he journeyed\nwith his friend down to Wrotham. Mrs. Jacox and her children were very\ncomfortably established in a small new house. When the companions\nentered they found the mother alone in her sitting-room, and she\nreceived them with an effusiveness very distasteful to Earwaker.\n\n'Now you shouldn't!' was her first exclamation to Malkin. 'Indeed you\nshouldn't! It's really very naughty of you. O Mr. Earwaker! Who ever\ntook so much pleasure in doing kindnesses? Do look at this _beautiful_\nbook that Mr. Malkin has sent as a present to my little Bella. O Mr.\nEarwaker!'\n\nThe journalist was at once struck with her tone and manner as she\naddressed Malkin. He remarked that phrase, 'my little Bella', and it\noccurred to him that Mrs. Jacox had been growing younger since he made\nher acquaintance on the towers of Notre Dame. When the girls presented\nthemselves, they also appeared to him more juvenile; Bella, in\nparticular, was dressed with an exaggeration of childishness decidedly\nnot becoming. One had but to look into her face to see that she\nanswered perfectly to Malkin's description; she was a young lady, and\nno child. A very pretty young lady, moreover; given to colouring, but\nwith no silly simper; intelligent about the eyes and lips; modest, in a\nnatural and sweet way. He conversed with her, and in doing so was\ndisagreeably affected by certain glances she occasionally cast towards\nher mother. One would have said that she feared censure, though it was\nhard to see why.\n\nOn the return journey Earwaker made known some of his impressions,\nthough not all.\n\n'I like the girls,' he said, 'Bella especially. But I can't say much\ngood of their mother.'\n\nThey were opposite each other in the railway carriage. Malkin leaned\nforward with earnest, anxious face.\n\n'That's my own trouble,' he whispered. 'I'm confoundedly uneasy about\nit. I don't think she's bringing them up at all in a proper way.\nEarwaker, I would pay down five thousand pounds for the possibility of\ntaking Bella away altogether.'\n\nThe other mused.\n\n'But, mind you,' pursued Malkin, 'she's not a _bad_ woman. By no means!\nThoroughly good-hearted I'm convinced; only a little weak here.' He\ntapped his forehead. 'I respect her, for all she has suffered, and her\nway of going through it. But she isn't the ideal mother, you know.'\n\nOn his way home, Malkin turned into his friend's chambers 'for five\nminutes'. At two in the morning he was still there, and his talk in the\nmeanwhile had been of nothing but schemes for protecting Bella against\nher mother's more objectionable influences. On taking leave, he asked:\n\n'Any news of Peak yet?'\n\n'None. I haven't seen Moxey for a long time.'\n\n'Do you think Peak will look you up again, if he's in London?'\n\n'No, I think he'll keep away. And I half hope he will; I shouldn't\nquite know how to behave. Ten to one he's in London now. I suppose he\ncouldn't stay at Exeter. But he may have left England.'\n\nThey parted, and for a week did not see each other. Then, on Monday\nevening, when Earwaker was very busy with a mass of manuscript, the\nwell-known knock sounded from the passage, and Malkin received\nadmission. The look he wore was appalling, a look such as only some\nfearful catastrophe could warrant.\n\n'Are you busy?' he asked, in a voice very unlike his own.\n\nEarwaker could not doubt that the trouble was this time serious. He\nabandoned his work, and gave himself wholly to his friend's service.\n\n'An awful thing has happened,' Malkin began. 'How the deuce shall I\ntell you? Oh, the ass I have made of myself! But I couldn't help it;\nthere seemed no way out of it.'\n\n'Well? What?'\n\n'It was last night, but I couldn't come to you till now. By Jove! I\nveritably thought of sending you a note, and then killing myself. Early\nthis morning I was within an ace of suicide. Believe me, old friend.\nThis is no farce.'\n\n'I'm waiting.'\n\n'Yes, yes; but I can't tell you all at once. Sure you're not busy? I\nknow I pester you. I was down at Wrotham yesterday. I hadn't meant to\ngo, but the temptation was too strong. I got there at five o'clock, and\nfound that the girls were gone to have tea with some young friends.\nWell, I wasn't altogether sorry; it was a good opportunity for a little\ntalk with their mother. And I _had_ the talk. But, oh, ass that I was!'\n\nHe smote the side of his head savagely.\n\n'Can you guess, Earwaker? Can you give a shot at what happened?'\n\n'Perhaps I might,' replied the other, gravely.\n\n'Well?'\n\n'That woman asked you to marry her.'\n\nMalkin leapt from his chair, and sank back again.\n\n'It came to that. Yes, upon my word, it came to that. She said she had\nfallen in love with me--that was the long and short of it. And I had\nnever said a word that could suggest--Oh, confound it! What a frightful\nscene it was!'\n\n'You took a final leave of her?'\n\nMalkin stared with eyes of anguish into his friend's face, and at\nlength whispered thickly:\n\n'I said I would!'\n\n'What? Take leave?'\n\n'Marry her!'\n\nEarwaker had much ado to check an impatiently remonstrant laugh. He\npaused awhile, then began his expostulation, at first treating the\naffair as too absurd for grave argument.\n\n'My boy,' he concluded, 'you have got into a preposterous scrape, and I\nsee only one way out of it. You must flee. When does your brother start\nfor the Antipodes?'\n\n'Thursday morning.'\n\n'Then you go with him; there's an end of it.'\n\nMalkin listened with the blank, despairing look of a man condemned to\ndeath.\n\n'Do you hear me?' urged the other. 'Go home and pack. On Thursday I'll\nsee you off.'\n\n'I can't bring myself to that,' came in a groan from Malkin. 'I've\nnever yet done anything to be seriously ashamed of, and I can't run\naway after promising marriage. It would weigh upon me for the rest of\nmy life.'\n\n'Humbug! Would it weigh upon you less to marry the mother, and all the\ntime be in love with the daughter? To my mind, there's something\npeculiarly loathsome in the suggestion.'\n\n'But, look here; Bella is very young, really very young indeed. It's\npossible that I have deluded myself. Perhaps I don't really care for\nher in the way I imagined. It's more than likely that I might be\ncontent to regard her with fatherly affection.'\n\n'Even supposing that, with what sort of affection do you regard Mrs\nJacox?'\n\nMalkin writhed on his chair before replying.\n\n'You mustn't misjudge her!' he exclaimed. 'She is no heartless schemer.\nThe poor thing almost cried her eyes out. It was a frightful scene. She\nreproached herself bitterly. What _could_ I do? I have a tenderness for\nher, there's no denying that. She has been so vilely used, and has\nborne it all so patiently. How abominable it would be if I dealt her\nanother blow!'\n\nThe journalist raised his eyebrows, and uttered inarticulate sounds.\n\n'Was anything said about Bella?' he asked, abruptly.\n\n'Not a word. I'm convinced she doesn't suspect that I thought of Bella\nlike that. The fact is, I have misled her. She thought all along that\nmy chief interest was in _her_.'\n\n'Indeed? Then what was the ground of her self-reproach that you speak\nof?'\n\n'How defective you are in the appreciation of delicate feeling!' cried\nMalkin frantically, starting up and rushing about the room. 'She\nreproached herself for having permitted me to get entangled with a\nwidow older than myself, and the mother of two children. What could be\nsimpler?'\n\nEarwaker began to appreciate the dangers of the situation. If he\ninsisted upon his view of Mrs. Jacox's behaviour (though it was not the\nharshest that the circumstances suggested, for he was disposed to\nbelieve that the widow had really lost her heart to her kind, eccentric\nchampion), the result would probably be to confirm Malkin in his\nresolution of self-sacrifice. The man must be saved, if possible, from\nsuch calamity, and this would not be effected by merely demonstrating\nthat he was on the highroad to ruin. It was necessary to try another\ntack.\n\n'It seems to me, Malkin,' he resumed, gravely, 'that it is you who are\ndeficient in right feeling. In offering to marry this poor woman, you\ndid her the gravest wrong.'\n\n'What? How?'\n\n'You know that it is impossible for you to love her. You know that you\nwill repent, and that she will be aware of it. You are not the kind of\nman to conceal your emotions. Bella will grow up, and--well, the state\nof things won't tend to domestic felicity. For Mrs Jacox's own sake, it\nis your duty to put an end to this folly before it has gone too far.'\n\nThe other gave earnest ear, but with no sign of shaken conviction.\n\n'Yes,' he said. 'I know this is one way of looking at it. But it\nassumes that a man can't control himself, that his sense of honour\nisn't strong enough to keep him in the right way. I don't think you\nquite understand me. I am not a passionate man; the proof is that I\nhave never fallen in love since I was sixteen. I think a great deal of\ndomestic peace, a good deal more than of romantic enthusiasm. If I\nmarry Mrs. Jacox, I shall make her a good and faithful husband,--so\nmuch I can safely say of myself.'\n\nHe waited, but Earwaker was not ready with a rejoinder.\n\n'And there's another point. I have always admitted the defect of my\ncharacter--an inability to settle down. Now, if I run away to New\nZealand, with the sense of having dishonoured myself, I shall be a mere\nWandering Jew for the rest of my life. All hope of redemption will be\nover. Of the two courses now open to me, that of marriage with Mrs.\nJacox is decidedly the less disadvantageous. Granting that I have made\na fool of myself, I must abide by the result, and make the best of it.\nAnd the plain fact is, I _can't_ treat her so disgracefully; I _can't_\nburden my conscience in this way. I believe it would end in suicide; I\ndo, indeed.'\n\n'This sounds all very well, but it is weakness and selfishness.'\n\n'How can you say so?'\n\n'There's no proving to so short-sighted a man the result of his\nmistaken course. I've a good mind to let you have your way just for the\nsatisfaction of saying afterwards, \"Didn't I tell you so?\" You propose\nto behave with abominable injustice to two people, putting yourself\naside. Doesn't it occur to you that Bella may already look upon you as\nher future husband? Haven't you done your best to plant that idea in\nher mind?'\n\nMalkin started, but quickly recovered himself.\n\n'No, I haven't! I have behaved with the utmost discretion. Bella thinks\nof me only as of a friend much older than herself.'\n\n'I don't believe it!'\n\n'Nonsense, Earwaker! A child of fifteen!'\n\n'The other day you had quite a different view, and after seeing her\nagain I agreed with you. She is a young girl, and if not already in\nlove with you, is on the way to be so.'\n\n'That will come to nothing when she hears that I am going to be her\nstep-father.'\n\n'Far more likely to develop into a grief that will waste the best part\nof her lifetime. She will be shocked and made miserable. But do as you\nlike. I am tired of arguing.'\n\nEarwaker affected to abandon the matter in disgust. For several minutes\nthere was silence, then a low voice sounded from the corner where\nMalkin stood leaning.\n\n'So it is your honest belief that Bella has begun to think of me in\nthat way?'\n\n'I am convinced of it.'\n\n'But if I run away, I shall never see her again.'\n\n'Why not? _She_ won't run away. Come back when things have squared\nthemselves. Write to Mrs. Jacox from the ends of the earth, and let her\nunderstand that there is no possibility of your marrying her.'\n\n'Tell her about Bella, you mean?'\n\n'No, that's just what I don't mean. Avoid any mention of the girl. Come\nback when she is seventeen, and, if she is willing, carry her off to be\nhappy ever after.'\n\n'But she may have fallen in love with someone else.'\n\n'I think not. You must risk it, at all events.'\n\n'Look here!' Malkin came forward eagerly. 'I'll write to Mrs. Jacox\nto-night, and make a full confession. I'll tell her exactly how the\ncase stands. She's a good woman; she'll gladly sacrifice herself for\nthe sake of her daughter.'\n\nEarwaker was firm in resistance. He had no faith whatever in the\nwidow's capacity for self-immolation, and foresaw that his friend would\nbe drawn into another 'frightful scene', resulting probably in a\nmarriage as soon as the licence could be obtained.\n\n'When are you to see her again?' he inquired.\n\n'On Wednesday.'\n\n'Will you undertake to do nothing whatever till Wednesday morning, and\nthen to have another talk with me? I'll come and see you about ten\no'clock.'\n\nIn the end Malkin was constrained into making this engagement, and not\nlong after midnight the journalist managed to get rid of him.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon arrived a distracted note. 'I shall keep my\npromise, and I won't try to see you till you come here tomorrow. But I\nam sore beset. I have received _three_ letters from Mrs. Jacox, all\nlong and horribly pathetic. She seems to have a presentiment that I\nshall forsake her. What a beast I shall be if I do! Tom comes here\nto-night, and I think I shall tell him all.'\n\nThe last sentence was a relief to the reader; he knew nothing of Mr\nThomas Malkin, but there was a fair presumption that this gentleman\nwould not see his brother bent on making such a notable fool of himself\nwithout vigorous protest.\n\nAt the appointed hour next morning, Earwaker reached his friend's\nlodgings, which were now at Kilburn. On entering the room he saw, not\nthe familiar figure, but a solid, dark-faced, black-whiskered man, whom\na faint resemblance enabled him to identify as Malkin the younger.\n\n'I was expecting you,' said Thomas, as they shook hands. 'My brother is\ncompletely floored. When I got here an hour ago, I insisted on his\nlying down, and now I think he's asleep. If you don't mind, we'll let\nhim rest for a little. I believe he has hardly closed his eyes since\nthis unfortunate affair happened.'\n\n'It rejoiced me to hear that he was going to ask your advice. How do\nmatters stand?'\n\n'You know Mrs. Jacox?'\n\nThomas was obviously a man of discretion, but less intellectual than\nhis brother; he spoke like one who is accustomed to the management of\naffairs. At first he was inclined to a polite reserve, but Earwaker's\nconversation speedily put him more at ease.\n\n'I have quite made up my mind,' he said presently, 'that we must take\nhim away with us to-morrow. The voyage will bring him to his senses.'\n\n'Of course he resists?'\n\n'Yes, but if you will give me your help, I think we can manage him. He\nis not very strong-willed. In a spasmodic way he can defy everyone, but\nthe steady pressure of common sense will prevail with him, I think.'\n\nThey had talked for half-an-hour, when the door opened and the object\nof their benevolent cares stood before them. He was clad in a\ndressing-gown, and his disordered hair heightened the look of illness\nwhich his features presented.\n\n'Why didn't you call me?' he asked his brother, irritably. 'Earwaker, I\nbeg a thousand pardons! I'm not very well; I've overslept myself.'\n\n'Yes, yes; come and sit down.'\n\nThomas made an offer to leave them.\n\n'Don't go,' said Malkin. 'No need whatever. You know why Earwaker has\nbeen so kind as to come here. We may as well talk it over together.'\n\nHe sat on the table, swinging a tassel of his dressing-gown round and\nround.\n\n'Now, what do you really think of doing?' asked the journalist, in a\nkind voice.\n\n'I don't know. I absolutely do not know. I'm unutterably wretched.'\n\n'In that case, will you let your brother and me decide for you? We have\nno desire but for your good, and we are perfectly at one in our\njudgment.'\n\n'Of course I know what you will propose!' cried the other, excitedly.\n'From the prudential point of view, you are right, I have no doubt. But\nhow can you protect me against remorse? If you had received letters\nsuch as these three,' he pulled them out of a pocket, 'you would be as\nmiserable as I am. If I don't keep my promise, I shall never know\nanother moment of peace.'\n\n'You certainly won't if you _do_ keep it,' remarked Thomas.\n\n'No,' added Earwaker, 'and one if not two other persons will be put\ninto the same case. Whereas by boldly facing these reproaches of\nconscience, you do a great kindness to the others.'\n\n'If only you could assure me of that!'\n\n'I _can_ assure you. That is to say, I can give it as my unassailable\nconviction.'\n\nAnd Earwaker once more enlarged upon the theme, stating it from every\npoint of view that served his purpose.\n\n'You're making a mountain out of a mole-heap,' was the confirmatory\nremark that came from Thomas.  'This respectable lady will get over her\nsorrows quickly enough, and some day she'll be only too glad to have you\nfor a son-in-law, if Miss Bella still pleases you.'\n\n'It's only right,' urged Earwaker, in pursuance of his subtler\nintention, 'that you should bear the worst of the suffering, for the\ntrouble has come out of your own thoughtlessness. You are fond of\nsaying that you have behaved with the utmost discretion; so far from\nthat you have been outrageously indiscreet. I foresaw that something of\nthis kind might come to pass'----\n\n'Then why the devil didn't you warn me?' shouted Malkin, in an agony of\nnervous strain.\n\n'It would have been useless. In fact, I foresaw it too late.'\n\nThe discussion continued for an hour. By careful insistence on the idea\nof self-sacrifice, Earwaker by degrees demolished the arguments his\nfriend kept putting forward. Thomas, who had gone impatiently to the\nwindow, turned round with words that were meant to be final.\n\n'It's quite decided. You begin your preparations at once, and to-morrow\nmorning you go on board with us.'\n\n'But if I don't go to Wrotham this afternoon, she'll be here either\nto-night or the first thing to-morrow. I'm sure of it!'\n\n'By four or five o'clock,' said Earwaker, 'you can have broken up the\ncamp. You've often done it at shorter notice. Go to an hotel for the\nnight.'\n\n'I must write to the poor woman.'\n\n'Do as you like about that.'\n\n'Who is to help her, if she gets into difficulties--as she's always\ndoing? Who is to advise her about Bella's education? Who is to pay--I\nmean, who will see to----? Oh, confound it!'\n\nThe listeners glanced at each other.\n\n'Are her affairs in order?' asked Earwaker. 'Has she a sufficient\nincome?'\n\n'For ordinary needs, quite sufficient. But'----\n\n'Then you needn't be in the least uneasy. Let her know where you are,\nwhen the equator is between you. Watch over her interests from a\ndistance, if you like. I can as good as promise you that Bella will\nwait hopefully to see her friend again.'\n\nMalkin succumbed to argument and exhaustion. Facing Earwaker with a\nlook of pathetic appeal, he asked hoarsely:\n\n'Will you stand by me till it's over? Have you time?'\n\n'I can give you till five o'clock.'\n\n'Then I'll go and dress. Ring the bell, Tom, and ask them to bring up\nsome beer.'\n\nBefore three had struck, the arrangements for flight were completed. A\nheavily-laden cab bore away Malkin's personal property; within sat the\nunhappy man and his faithful friend.\n\nThe next morning Earwaker went down to Tilbury, and said farewell to\nthe travellers on board the steamship Orient. Mrs. Thomas had already\ntaken her brother-in-law under her special care.\n\n'It's only three children to look after, instead of two,' she remarked,\nin a laughing aside to the journalist. 'How grateful he will be to you\nin a few days! And I'm sure _we_ are already.'\n\nMalkin's eyes were no longer quite lustreless. At the last moment he\ntalked with animation of 'two years hence', and there was vigour in the\nwaving of his hand as the vessel started seaward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nPeak lost no time in leaving Exeter. To lighten his baggage, and to get\nrid of possessions to which hateful memories attached, he sold all his\nbooks that had any bearing on theology. The incomplete translation of\n_Bibel und Natur_ he committed to the flames in Mrs Roots's kitchen,\nscattering its black remnants with savage thrusts of the poker. Whilst\nengaged in packing, he debated with himself whether or not he should\ntake leave of the few acquaintances to whom he was indebted for\nhospitality and other kindness. The question was: Had Buckland\nWarricombe already warned these people against him? Probably it had\nseemed to Buckland the wiser course to be content with driving the\nhypocrite away; and, if this were so, regard for the future dictated a\nretirement from Exeter which should in no way resemble secret flight.\nSidwell's influence with her parents would perhaps withhold them from\nmaking his disgrace known, and in a few years he might be glad that he\nhad behaved with all possible prudence. In the end, he decided to write\nto Mr. Lilywhite, saying that he was obliged to go away at a moment's\nnotice, and that he feared it would be necessary altogether to change\nthe scheme of life which he had had in view. This was the best way.\nFrom the Lilywhites, other people would hear of him, and perchance\ntheir conjectures would be charitable.\n\nWithout much hesitation he had settled his immediate plans. To London\nhe would not return, for he dreaded the temptations to which the\nproximity of Sidwell would expose him, and he had no mind to meet with\nMoxey or Earwaker. As it was now imperative that he should find work of\nthe old kind, he could not do better than go to Bristol, where, from\nthe safe ground of a cheap and obscure lodging, he might make\ninquiries, watch advertisements, and so on. He already knew of\nestablishments in Bristol where he might possibly obtain employment.\nLiving with the utmost economy, he need not fall into difficulties for\nmore than a year, and before then his good repute with the Rotherhithe\nfirm would ensure him some position or other; if not in Bristol, then\nat Newcastle, St. Helen's--any great centre of fuming and malodorous\nindustry. He was ready to work, would delight in work. Idleness was now\nthe intolerable thing.\n\nSo to Bristol he betook himself, and there made his temporary abode.\nAfter spending a few weeks in fruitless search for an engagement, he at\nlength paid his oft-postponed visit to Twybridge. In the old home he\nfelt completely a stranger, and his relatives strengthened the feeling\nby declaring him so changed in appearance that they hardly knew his\nface. With his mother only could he talk in anything like an intimate\nway, and the falsehoods with which he was obliged to answer her\nquestions all but destroyed the pleasure he would otherwise have found\nin being affectionately tended. His sister, Mrs Cusse, was happy in her\nhusband, her children, and a flourishing business. Oliver was making\nmoney, and enjoyed distinction among the shopkeeping community. His\naunt still dealt in millinery, and kept up her acquaintance with\nrespectable families. To Godwin all was like a dream dreamt for the\nsecond time. He could not acknowledge any actual connection between\nthese people and himself. But their characteristics no longer gravely\noffended him, and he willingly recognised the homespun worth which\ntheir lives displayed. It was clear to him that by no possible agency\nof circumstances could he have been held in normal relations with his\nkinsfolk. However smooth his career, it must have wafted him to an\nimmeasurable distance from Twybridge. Nature had decreed that he was to\nresemble the animals which, once reared, go forth in complete\nindependence of birthplace and the ties of blood. It was a harsh fate,\nbut in what had not fate been harsh to him? The one consolation was\nthat he alone suffered. His mother was no doubt occasionally troubled\nby solicitude on his account, but she could not divine his inward\nmiseries, and an assurance that he had no material cares sufficed to\nset her mind at ease.\n\n'You are very like your father, Godwin,' she said, with a sigh. 'He\ncouldn't rest, however well he seemed to be getting on. There was\nalways something he wanted, and yet he didn't know what it was.'\n\n'Yes, I must be like him,' Godwin replied, smiling.\n\nHe stayed five days, then returned to Bristol. A week after that, his\nmother forwarded to him a letter which had come to Twybridge. He at\nonce recognised the writing, and broke the envelope with curiosity.\n\n'If you should be in London [the note began], I beg you to let me see\nyou. There is something I have to say. To speak to you for a few\nminutes I would come any distance. Don't accuse me of behaving\ntreacherously; it was not my fault. I know you would rather avoid me,\nbut do consent to hear what I have to say. If you have no intention of\ncoming to London, will you write and let me know where you are living?\n\nWhat could Marcella have to say to him? Nothing surely that he at all\ncared to hear. No doubt she imagined that he might be in ignorance of\nthe circumstances which had led to Buckland Warricombe's discovery; she\nwished to defend herself against the suspicion of 'treachery'. He\nlaughed carelessly, and threw her note aside.\n\nTwo months passed, and his efforts to find employment were still vain,\nthough he had received conditional promises. The solitude of his life\ngrew burdensome. Several times he began a letter to Sidwell, but his\ndifficulty in writing was so great that he destroyed the attempt. In\ntruth, he knew not how to address her. The words he penned were tumid,\nmeaningless. He could not send professions of love, for his heart\nseemed to be suffering a paralysis, and the laborious artificiality of\nhis style must have been evident. The only excuse for breaking silence\nwould be to let her know that he had resumed honest work; he must wait\ntill the opportunity offered. It did not distress him to be without\nnews of her. If she wished to write, and was only withheld by ignorance\nof his whereabouts, it was well; if she had no thought of sending him a\nword, it did not matter. He loved her, and consciously nourished hope,\nbut for the present there was nothing intolerable in separation. His\nstate of mind resulted partly from nervous reaction, and in part from a\nsense that only by silent suffering could his dignity in Sidwell's eyes\nbe ultimately restored. Between the evil past and the hopeful future\nmust be a complete break.\n\nHis thoughts kept turning to London, though not because Sidwell might\nstill be there. He felt urgent need of speaking with a friend. Moxey\nwas perhaps no longer to be considered one; but Earwaker would be\ntolerant of human weaknesses. To have a long talk with Earwaker would\nhelp him to recover his mental balance, to understand himself and his\nposition better. So one morning in March, on the spur of the moment, he\ntook train and was once more in the metropolis. On his way he had\ndetermined to send a note to Earwaker before calling at Staple Inn. He\nwrote it at a small hotel in Paddington, where he took a room for the\nnight, and then spent the evening at a theatre, as the best way of\nkilling time.\n\nBy the first post next morning came a card, whereon Earwaker had\nwritten: 'Be here, if you can, at two o'clock. Shall be glad to see\nyou.'\n\n'So you have been new-furnishing!' Godwin remarked, as he was admitted\nto the chambers. 'You look much more comfortable.'\n\n'I'm glad you think so. It is the general opinion.'\n\nThey had shaken hands as though this were one of the ordinary meetings\nof old time, and their voices scarcely belied the appearance. Peak\nmoved about the study, glancing at pictures and books, Earwaker eyeing\nhim the while with not unfriendly expression. They were sincerely glad\nto see each other, and when Peak seated himself it was with an audible\nsigh of contentment.\n\n'And what are you doing?' he inquired.\n\nThe journalist gave a brief account of his affairs, and Peak brightened\nwith pleasure.\n\n'This is good news. I knew you would shake off the ragamuffins before\nlong. Give me some of your back numbers, will you? I shall be curious\nto examine your new style.'\n\n'And you?--Come to live in London?'\n\n'No; I am at Bristol, but only waiting. There's a chance of an\nanalyst's place in Lancashire; but I may give the preference to an\nopening I have heard of in Belgium. Better to go abroad, I think.'\n\n'Perhaps so.'\n\n'I have a question to ask you. I suppose you talked about that\n_Critical_ article of mine _before_ you received my request for\nsilence?'\n\n'That's how it was,' Earwaker replied, calmly.\n\n'Yes; I understood. It doesn't matter.'\n\nThe other puffed at his pipe, and moved uneasily.\n\n'I am taking for granted,' Peak continued, 'that you know how I have\nspent my time down in Devonshire.'\n\n'In outline. Need we trouble about the details?'\n\n'No. But don't suppose that I should feel any shame in talking to you\nabout them. That would be a confession of base motive. You and I have\nstudied each other, and we can exchange thoughts on most subjects with\nmutual understanding. You know that I have only followed my convictions\nto their logical issue. An opportunity offered of achieving the supreme\nend to which my life is directed, and what scruple could stand in my\nway? We have nothing to do with names and epithets. _Here_ are the\nfacts of life as I had known it; _there_ is the existence promised as\nthe reward of successful artifice. To live was to pursue the object of\nmy being. I could not feel otherwise; therefore, could not act\notherwise. You imagine me defeated, flung back into the gutter.' His\nwords came more quickly, and the muscles of his face worked under\nemotion. 'It isn't so. I have a great and reasonable hope. Perhaps I\nhave gained everything I really desired. I could tell you the strangest\nstory, but there a scruple _does_ interpose. If we live another twenty\nyears--but now I can only talk about myself.'\n\n'And this hope of which you speak,' said Earwaker, with a grave smile,\n'points you at present to sober work among your retorts and test-tubes?'\n\n'Yes, it does.'\n\n'Good. Then I can put faith in the result.'\n\n'Yet the hope began in a lie,' rejoined Peak, bitterly. 'It will always\nbe pleasant to look back upon that, won't it? You see: by no\nconceivable honest effort could I have gained this point. Life utterly\ndenied to me the satisfaction of my strongest instincts, so long as I\nplodded on without cause of shame; the moment I denied my faith, and\nput on a visage of brass, great possibilities opened before me. Of\ncourse I understand the moralist's position. It behoved me, though I\nknew that a barren and solitary track would be my only treading to the\nend, to keep courageously onward. If I can't _believe_ that any such\nduty is imposed upon me, where is the obligation to persevere, the\nmorality of doing so? That is the worst hypocrisy. I have been honest,\ninasmuch as I have acted in accordance with my actual belief.'\n\n'M--m--m,' muttered Earwaker, slowly. 'Then you have never been\ntroubled with a twinge of conscience?'\n\n'With a thousand! I have been racked, martyred. What has that to do\nwith it? Do you suppose I attach any final significance to those\ntorments? Conscience is the same in my view as an inherited disease\nwhich may possibly break out on any most innocent physical\nindulgence.--What end have I been pursuing? Is it criminal? Is it mean?\nI wanted to win the love of a woman--nothing more. To do that, I have\nhad to behave like the grovelling villain who has no desire but to fill\nhis pockets. And with success!--You understand that, Earwaker? I have\nsucceeded! What respect can I have for the common morality, after this?'\n\n'You have succeeded?' the other asked, thoughtfully. 'I could have\nimagined that you had been in appearance successful'----\n\nHe paused, and Peak resumed with vehemence:\n\n'No, not in appearance only. I can't tell you the story'----\n\n'I don't wish you to'----\n\n'But what I have won is won for ever. The triumph no longer rests on\ndeceit. What I insist upon is that by deceit only was it rendered\npossible. If a starving man succeeds in stealing a loaf of bread, the\nfood will benefit him no less than if he had purchased it; it is good,\ntrue sustenance, no matter how he got it. To be sure, the man may\nprefer starvation; he may have so strong a metaphysical faith that\ndeath is welcome in comparison with what he calls dishonour. I--I have\nno such faith; and millions of other men in this country would tell the\nblunt truth if they said the same. I have _used means_, that's all. The\nold way of candour led me to bitterness and cursing; by dissimulation I\nhave won something more glorious than tongue can tell.'\n\nIt was in the endeavour to expel the subtlest enemy of his peace that\nGodwin dwelt so defiantly upon this view of the temptation to which he\nhad yielded. Since his farewell interview with Sidwell, he knew no rest\nfrom the torment of a mocking voice which bade him bear in mind that\nall his dishonour had been superfluous, seeing that whilst he played\nthe part of a zealous Christian, Sidwell herself was drifting further\nand further from the old religion. This voice mingled with his dreams,\nand left not a waking hour untroubled. He refused to believe it, strove\nagainst the suggestion as a half-despairing man does against the\npersistent thought of suicide. If only he could obtain Earwaker's\nassent to the plan he put forward, it would support him in disregard of\nidle regrets.\n\n'It is impossible,' said the journalist, 'for anyone to determine\nwhether that is true or not--for you, as much as for anyone else. Be\nglad that you have shaken off the evil and retained the good, no use in\nsaying more than that.'\n\n'Yes,' declared the other, stubbornly, 'there is good in exposing false\nviews of life. I ought to have come utterly to grief and shame, and\ninstead'----\n\n'Instead----? Well?'\n\n'What I have told you.'\n\n'Which I interpret thus: that you have permission to redeem your\ncharacter, if possible, in the eyes of a woman you have grievously\nmisled.'\n\nGodwin frowned.\n\n'Who suggested this to you, Earwaker?'\n\n'You; no one else. I don't even know who the woman is of whom you\nspeak.'\n\n'Grant you are right. As an honest man, I should never have won her\nfaintest interest.'\n\n'It is absurd for us to talk about it. Think in the way that is most\nhelpful to you,--that, no doubt, is a reasonable rule. Let us have done\nwith all these obscurities, and come to a practical question. Can I be\nof any use to you? Would you care, for instance, to write an article\nnow and then on some scientific matter that has a popular interest? I\nthink I could promise to get that kind of thing printed for you. Or\nwould you review an occasional book that happened to be in your line?'\n\nGodwin reflected.\n\n'Thank you,' he replied, at length. 'I should be glad of such work--if\nI can get into the mood for doing it properly. That won't be just yet;\nbut perhaps when I have found a place'----\n\n'Think it over. Write to me about it.'\n\nPeak glanced round the room.\n\n'You don't know how glad I am,' he said, 'that your prosperity shows\nitself in this region of bachelordom. If I had seen you in a\ncomfortable house, married to a woman worthy of you--I couldn't have\nbeen sincere in my congratulations: I should have envied you so\nfiercely.'\n\n'You're a strange fellow. Twenty years hence--as you said just now--you\nwill one way or another have got rid of your astounding illusions. At\nfifty--well, let us say at sixty--you will have a chance of seeing\nthings without these preposterous sexual spectacles.'\n\n'I hope so. Every stage of life has its powers and enjoyments. When I\nam old, I hope to perceive and judge without passion of any kind. But\nis that any reason why my youth should be frustrated? We have only one\nlife, and I want to live mine throughout.'\n\nSoon after this Peak rose. He remembered that the journalist's time was\nvaluable, and that he no longer had the right to demand more of it than\ncould be granted to any casual caller. Earwaker behaved with all\nfriendliness, but their relations had necessarily suffered a change.\nMore than a year of separation, spent by the one in accumulating\nmemories of dishonour, had given the other an enviable position among\nmen; Earwaker had his place in the social system, his growing circle of\nfriends, his congenial labour; perhaps--notwithstanding the tone in\nwhich he spoke of marriage--his hopes of domestic happiness. All this\nwith no sacrifice of principle. He was fortunate in his temper, moral\nand intellectual; partly directing circumstances, partly guided by\ntheir pressure, he advanced on the way of harmonious development.\nNothing great would come of his endeavours, but what he aimed at he\nsteadily perfected. And this in spite of the adverse conditions under\nwhich he began his course. Nature had been kind to him; what more could\none say?\n\nWhen he went forth into the street again, Godwin felt his heart sink.\nHis solitude was the more complete for this hour of friendly dialogue.\nNo other companionship offered itself; if he lingered here, it must be\nas one of the drifting crowd, as an idle and envious spectator of the\nbusiness and pleasure rife about him. He durst not approach that\nquarter of the town where Sidwell was living--if indeed she still\nremained here. Happily, the vastness of London enabled him to think of\nher as at a great distance; by keeping to the district in which he now\nwandered he was practically as remote from her as when he walked the\nstreets of Bristol.\n\nYet there was one person who would welcome him eagerly if he chose to\nvisit her. And, after all, might it not be as well if he heard what\nMarcella had to say to him? He could not go to the house, for it would\nbe disagreeable to encounter Moxey; but, if he wrote, Marcella would\nspeedily make an appointment. After an hour or two of purposeless\nrambling, he decided to ask for an interview. He might learn something\nthat really concerned him; in any case, it was a final meeting with\nMarcella, to whom he perhaps owed this much courtesy.\n\nThe reply was as prompt as that from Earwaker. By the morning post came\na letter inviting him to call upon Miss Moxey as soon as possible\nbefore noon. She added, 'My brother is away in the country; you will\nmeet no one here.'\n\nBy eleven o'clock he was at Notting Hill; in the drawing-room, he sat\nalone for two or three minutes. Marcella entered silently, and came\ntowards him without a smile; he saw that she read his face eagerly, if\nnot with a light of triumph in her eyes. The expression might signify\nthat she rejoiced at having been an instrument of his discomfiture;\nperhaps it was nothing more than gladness at seeing him again.\n\n'Have you come to live in London?' she asked, when they had shaken\nhands without a word.\n\n'I am only here for a day or two.'\n\n'My letter reached you without delay?'\n\n'Yes. It was sent from Twybridge to Bristol. I didn't reply then, as I\nhad no prospect of being in London.'\n\n'Will you sit down? You can stay for a few minutes?'\n\nHe seated himself awkwardly. Now that he was in Marcella's presence, he\nfelt that he had acted unaccountably in giving occasion for another\nscene between them which could only end as painfully as that at Exeter.\nHer emotion grew evident; he could not bear to meet the look she had\nfixed upon him.\n\n'I want to speak of what happened in this house about Christmas time,'\nshe resumed. 'But I must know first what you have been told.'\n\n'What have _you_ been told?' he replied, with an uneasy smile. 'How do\nyou know that anything which happened here had any importance for me?'\n\n'I don't know that it had. But I felt sure that Mr. Warricombe meant to\nspeak to you about it.'\n\n'Yes, he did.'\n\n'But did he tell you the exact truth? Or were you led to suppose that I\nhad broken my promise to you?'\n\nUnwilling to introduce any mention of Sidwell, Peak preferred to\nsimplify the story by attributing to Buckland all the information he\nhad gathered.\n\n'I understood,' he replied, 'that Warricombe had come here in the hope\nof learning more about me, and that certain facts came out in general\nconversation. What does it matter how he learned what he did? From the\nday when he met you down in Devonshire, it was of course inevitable\nthat the truth should sooner or later come out. He always suspected me.'\n\n'But I want you to know,' said Marcella, 'that I had no willing part in\nit. I promised you not to speak even to my brother, and I should never\nhave done so but that Christian somehow met Mr. Warricombe, and heard\nhim talk of you. Of course he came to me in astonishment, and for your\nown interest I thought it best to tell Christian what I knew. When Mr.\nWarricombe came here, neither Christian nor I would have enlightened\nhim about--about your past. It happened most unfortunately that Mr.\nMalkin was present, and he it was who began to speak of the _Critical_\narticle--and other things. I was powerless to prevent it.'\n\n'Why trouble about it? I quite believe your account.'\n\n'You _do_ believe it? You know I would not have injured you?'\n\n'I am sure you had no wish to,' Godwin replied, in as unsentimental a\ntone as possible. And, he added after a moment's pause, 'Was this what\nyou were so anxious to tell me?'\n\n'Yes. Chiefly that.'\n\n'Let me put your mind at rest,' pursued the other, with quiet\nfriendliness. 'I am disposed to turn optimist; everything has happened\njust as it should have done. Warricombe relieved me from a false\nposition. If _he_ hadn't done so, I must very soon have done it for\nmyself. Let us rejoice that things work together for such obvious good.\nA few more lessons of this kind, and we shall acknowledge that the\nworld is the best possible.'\n\nHe laughed, but the tense expression of Marcella's features did not\nrelax.\n\n'You say you are living in Bristol?'\n\n'For a time.'\n\n'Have you abandoned Exeter?'\n\nThe word implied something that Marcella could not utter more plainly.\nHer face completed the question.\n\n'And the clerical career as well,' he answered.\n\nBut he knew that she sought more than this, and his voice again broke\nthe silence.\n\n'Perhaps you have heard that already? Are you in communication with\nMiss Moorhouse?'\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n'But probably Warricombe has told your brother----?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Oh, of his success in ridding Exeter of my objectionable presence.'\n\n'Christian hasn't seen him again, nor have I.'\n\n'I only wish to assure you that I have suffered no injury. My\nexperiment was doomed to failure. What led me to it, how I regarded it,\nwe won't discuss; I am as little prepared to do so now as when we\ntalked at Exeter. That chapter in my life is happily over. As soon as I\nam established again in a place like that I had at Rotherhithe, I shall\nbe quite contented.'\n\n'Contented?' She smiled incredulously. 'For how long?'\n\n'Who can say? I have lost the habit of looking far forward.'\n\nMarcella kept silence so long that he concluded she had nothing more to\nsay to him. It was an opportunity for taking leave without emotional\nstress, and he rose from his chair.\n\n'Don't go yet,' she said at once. 'It wasn't only this that I'----\n\nHer voice was checked.\n\n'Can I be of any use to you in Bristol?' Peak asked, determined to\navoid the trial he saw approaching.\n\n'There is something more I wanted to say,' she pursued, seeming not to\nhear him. 'You pretend to be contented, but I know that is impossible.\nYou talk of going back to a dull routine of toil, when what you most\ndesire is freedom. I want--if I can--to help you.'\n\nAgain she failed to command her voice. Godwin raised his eyes, and was\nastonished at the transformation she had suddenly undergone. Her face,\ninstead of being colourless and darkly vehement, had changed to a\nbright warmth, a smiling radiance such as would have become a happy\ngirl. His look seemed to give her courage.\n\n'Only hear me patiently. We are such old friends--are we not? We have\nso often proclaimed our scorn of conventionality, and why should a\nconventional fear hinder what I want to say? You know--don't you?--that\nI have far more money than I need or am ever likely to. I want only a\nfew hundreds a year, and I have more than a thousand.' She spoke more\nand more quickly, fearful of being interrupted. 'Why shouldn't I give\nyou some of my superfluity? Let me help you in this way. Money can do\nso much. Take some from me, and use it as you will--just as you will.\nIt is useless to _me_. Why shouldn't someone whom I wish well benefit\nby it?'\n\nGodwin was not so much surprised as disconcerted. He knew that\nMarcella's nature was of large mould, and that whether she acted for\ngood or evil its promptings would be anything but commonplace. The\nardour with which she pleaded, and the magnitude of the benefaction she\ndesired to bestow upon him, so affected his imagination that for the\nmoment he stood as if doubting what reply to make. The doubt really in\nhis mind was whether Marcella had calculated upon his weakness, and\nhoped to draw him within her power by the force of such an obligation,\nor if in truth she sought only to appease her heart with the exercise\nof generosity.\n\n'You will let me?' she panted forth, watching him with brilliant eyes.\n'This shall be a secret for ever between you and me. It imposes no debt\nof gratitude--how I despise the thought! I give you what is worthless\nto me,--except that it can do _you_ good. But you can thank me if you\nwill. I am not above being thanked.' She laughed unnaturally. 'Go and\ntravel at first, as you wished to. Write me a short letter every\nmonth--every two months, just that I may know you are enjoying your\nlife. It is agreed, isn't it?'\n\nShe held her hand to him, but Peak drew away, his face averted.\n\n'How can you give me the pain of refusing such an offer?' he exclaimed,\nwith remonstrance which was all but anger. 'You know the thing is\nutterly impossible. I should be ridiculous if I argued about it for a\nmoment.'\n\n'I can't see that it is impossible.'\n\n'Then you must take my word for it. But I have no right to speak to you\nin that way,' he added, more kindly, seeing the profound humiliation\nwhich fell upon her. 'You meant to come to my aid at a time when I\nseemed to you lonely and miserable. It was a generous impulse, and I do\nindeed thank you. I shall always remember it and be grateful to you.'\n\nMarcella's face was again in shadow. Its lineaments hardened to an\nexpression of cold, stern dignity.\n\n'I have made a mistake,' she said. 'I thought you above common ways of\nthinking.'\n\n'Yes, you put me on too high a pedestal,' Peak answered, trying to\nspeak humorously. 'One of my faults is that I am apt to mistake my own\nposition in the same way.'\n\n'You think yourself ambitious. Oh, if you knew really great ambition!\nGo back to your laboratory, and work for wages. I would have saved you\nfrom that.'\n\nThe tone was not vehement, but the words bit all the deeper for their\nunimpassioned accent. Godwin could make no reply.\n\n'I hope,' she continued, 'we may meet a few years hence. By that time\nyou will have learnt that what I offered was not impossible. You will\nwish you had dared to accept it. I know what your _ambition_ is. Wait\ntill you are old enough to see it in its true light. How you will scorn\nyourself! Surely there was never a man who united such capacity for\ngreat things with so mean an ideal. You will never win even the paltry\nsatisfaction on which you have set your mind--never! But you can't be\nmade to understand that. You will throw away all the best part of your\nlife. Meet me in a few years, and tell me the story of the interval.'\n\n'I will engage to do that, Marcella.'\n\n'You will? But not to tell me the truth. You will not dare to tell the\ntruth.'\n\n'Why not?' he asked, indifferently. 'Decidedly I shall owe it you in\nreturn for your frankness to-day. Till then--good-bye.'\n\nShe did not refuse her hand, and as he moved away she watched him with\na smile of slighting good-nature.\n\nOn the morrow Godwin was back in Bristol, and there he dwelt for\nanother six months, a period of mental and physical lassitude. Earwaker\ncorresponded with him, and urged him to attempt the work that had been\nproposed, but such effort was beyond his power.\n\nHe saw one day in a literary paper an announcement that Reusch's _Bibel\nund Natur_ was about to be published in an English translation. So\nsomeone else had successfully finished the work he undertook nearly two\nyears ago. He amused himself with the thought that he could ever have\npersevered so long in such profitless labour, and with a contemptuous\nlaugh he muttered '_Thohu wabohu_.'\n\nJust when the winter had set in, he received an offer of a post in\nchemical works at St. Helen's, and without delay travelled northwards.\nThe appointment was a poor one, and seemed unlikely to be a step to\nanything better, but his resources would not last more than another\nhalf year, and employment of whatever kind came as welcome relief to\nthe tedium of his existence. Established in his new abode, he at length\nwrote to Sidwell. She answered him at once in a short letter which he\nmight have shown to anyone, so calm were its expressions of interest,\nso uncompromising its words of congratulation. It began 'Dear Mr.\nPeak', and ended with 'Yours sincerely'. Well, he had used the same\nformalities, and had uttered his feelings with scarcely more of warmth.\nDisappointment troubled him for a moment, and for a moment only. He was\nso far from Exeter, and further still from the life that he had led\nthere. It seemed to him all but certain that Sidwell wrote coldly, with\nthe intention of discouraging his hopes. What hope was he so foolish as\nto entertain? His position poorer than ever, what could justify him in\nwriting love-letters to a girl who, even if willing to marry him, must\nnot do so until he had a suitable home to offer her?\n\nSince his maturity, he had never known so long a freedom from passion.\nOne day he wrote to Earwaker: 'I begin to your independence with regard\nto women. It would be a strange thing if I became a convert to that way\nof thinking, but once or twice of late I have imagined that it was\nhappening. My mind has all but recovered its tone, and I am able to\nread, to think--I mean really to _think_, not to muse. I get through\nbig and solid books. Presently, if your offer still hold good, I shall\nsend you a scrap of writing on something or other. The pestilent\natmosphere of this place seems to invigorate me. Last Saturday evening\nI took train, got away into the hills, and spent the Sunday\ngeologising. And a curious experience befell me,--one I had long, long\nago, in the Whitelaw days. Sitting down before some interesting strata,\nI lost myself in something like nirvana, grew so subject to the idea of\nvastness in geological time that all human desires and purposes\nshrivelled to ridiculous unimportance. Awaking for a minute, I tried to\nrealise the passion which not long ago rent and racked me, but I was\nflatly incapable of understanding it. Will this philosophic state\nendure? Perhaps I have used up all my emotional energy? I hardly know\nwhether to hope or fear it.'\n\nAbout midsummer, when his short holiday (he would only be released for\na fortnight) drew near, he was surprised by another letter from Sidwell.\n\n'I am anxious [she wrote] to hear that you are well. It is more than\nhalf a year since your last letter, and of late I have been constantly\nexpecting a few lines. The spring has been a time of trouble with us. A\ndistant relative, an old and feeble lady who has passed her life in a\nlittle Dorsetshire village, came to see us in April, and in less than a\nfortnight she was seized with illness and died. Then Fanny had an\nattack of bronchitis, from which even now she is not altogether\nrecovered. On her account we are all going to Royat, and I think we\nshall be away until the end of September. Will you let me hear from you\nbefore I leave England, which will be in a week's time? Don't refrain\nfrom writing because you think you have no news to send. Anything that\ninterests you is of interest to me. If it is only to tell me what you\nhave been reading, I shall be glad of a letter.'\n\nIt was still 'Yours sincerely'; but Godwin felt that the letter meant\nmore. In re-reading it he was pleasantly thrilled with a stirring of\nthe old emotions. But his first impulse, to write an ardent reply, did\nnot carry him away; he reflected and took counsel of the experience\ngained in his studious solitude. It was evident that by keeping silence\nhe had caused Sidwell to throw off something of her reserve. The course\ndictated by prudence was to maintain an attitude of dignity, to hold\nhimself in check. In this way he would regain what he had so\ndisastrously lost, Sidwell's respect. There was a distinct pleasure in\nthis exercise of self-command; it was something new to him; it\nflattered his pride. 'Let her learn that, after all, I am her superior.\nLet her fear to lose me. Then, if her love is still to be depended\nupon, she will before long find a way to our union. It is in her power,\nif only she wills it.'\n\nSo he sat down and wrote a short letter which seemed to him a model of\ndignified expression.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nSidwell took no one into her confidence. The case was not one for\ncounsel; whatever her future action, it must result from the maturing\nof self-knowledge, from the effect of circumstance upon her mind and\nheart. For the present she could live in silence.\n\n'We hear,' she wrote from London to Sylvia Moorhouse, 'that Mr. Peak\nhas left Exeter, and that he is not likely to carry out his intention\nof being ordained. You, I daresay, will feel no surprise.' Nothing more\nthan that; and Sylvia's comments in reply were equally brief.\n\nMartin Warricombe, after conversations with his wife and with Buckland,\nfelt it impossible not to seek for an understanding of Sidwell's share\nin the catastrophe. He was gravely perturbed, feeling that with himself\nlay the chief responsibility for what had happened. Buckland's attitude\nwas that of the man who can only keep repeating 'I told you so'; Mrs.\nWarricombe could only lament and upbraid in the worse than profitless\nfashion natural to women of her stamp. But in his daughter Martin had\nevery kind of faith, and he longed to speak to her without reserve. Two\ndays after her return from Exeter, he took Sidwell apart, and, with a\ndistressing sense of the delicacy of the situation, tried to persuade\nher to frank utterance.\n\n'I have been hearing strange reports,' he began, gravely, but without\nshow of displeasure. 'Can you help me to understand the real facts of\nthe case, Sidwell?--What is your view of Peak's behaviour?'\n\n'He has deceived you, father,' was the quiet reply.\n\n'You are convinced of that?--It allows of no----?'\n\n'It can't be explained away. He pretended to believe what he did not\nand could not believe.'\n\n'With interested motives, then?'\n\n'Yes.--But not motives in themselves dishonourable.'\n\nThere was a pause. Sidwell had spoken in a steady voice, though with\neyes cast down. Whether her father could understand a position such as\nGodwin's, she felt uncertain. That he would honestly endeavour to do\nso, there could be no doubt, especially since he must suspect that her\nown desire was to distinguish between the man and his fault. But a\nrevelation of all that had passed between her and Peak was not\npossible; she had the support neither of intellect nor of passion; it\nwould be asking for guidance, the very thing she had determined not to\ndo. Already she found it difficult to recover the impulses which had\ndirected her in that scene of parting; to talk of it would be to see\nher action in such a doubtful light that she might be led to some\npremature and irretrievable resolve. The only trustworthy counsellor\nwas time; on what time brought forth must depend her future.\n\n'Do you mean, Sidwell,' resumed her father, 'that you think it possible\nfor us to overlook this deception?'\n\nShe delayed a moment, then said:\n\n'I don't think it possible for you to regard him as a friend.'\n\nMartin's face expressed relief.\n\n'But will he remain in Exeter?'\n\n'I shouldn't think he can.'\n\nAgain a pause. Martin was of course puzzled exceedingly, but he began\nto feel some assurance that Peak need not be regarded as a danger.\n\n'I am grieved beyond expression,' he said at length. 'So deliberate a\nfraud--it seems to me inconsistent with any of the qualities I thought\nI saw in him.'\n\n'Yes--it must.'\n\n'Not--perhaps--to you?' Martin ventured, anxiously.\n\n'His nature is not base.'\n\n'Forgive me, dear.--I understand that you spoke with him after\nBuckland's call at his lodgings----?'\n\n'Yes, I saw him.'\n\n'And--he strove to persuade you that he had some motive which justified\nhis conduct?'\n\n'Excused, rather than justified.'\n\n'Not--it seems--to your satisfaction?'\n\n'I can't answer that question, father. My experience of life is too\nslight. I can only say that untruthfulness in itself is abhorrent to\nme, and that I could never try to make it seem a light thing.'\n\n'That, surely, is a sound view, think as we may on speculative points.\nBut allow me one more question, Sidwell. Does it seem to you that I\nhave no choice but to break off all communication with Mr Peak?'\n\nIt was the course dictated by his own wish, she knew. And what could be\ngained by any middle way between hearty goodwill and complete\nrepudiation? Time--time alone must work out the problem.\n\n'Yes, I think you have no choice,' she answered.\n\n'Then I must make inquiries--see if he leaves the town.'\n\n'Mr. Lilywhite will know, probably.'\n\n'I will write before long.'\n\nSo the dialogue ended, and neither sought to renew it.\n\nMartin enjoined upon his wife a discreet avoidance of the subject. The\nyounger members of the family were to know nothing of what had\nhappened, and, if possible, the secret must be kept from friends at\nExeter. When a fortnight had elapsed, he wrote to Mr. Lilywhite, asking\nwhether it was true that Peak had gone away. 'It seems that private\ncircumstances have obliged him to give up his project of taking Orders.\nPossibly he has had a talk with you?' The clergyman replied that Peak\nhad left Exeter. 'I have had a letter from him, explaining in general\nterms his change of views. It hardly surprises me that he has\nreconsidered the matter. I don't think he was cut out for clerical\nwork. He is far more likely to distinguish himself in the world of\nscience. I suspect that conscientious scruples may have something to do\nwith it; if so, all honour to him!'\n\nThe Warricombes prolonged their stay in London until the end of June.\nOn their return home, Martin was relieved to find that scarcely an\ninquiry was made of him concerning Peak. The young man's disappearance\nexcited no curiosity in the good people who had come in contact with\nhim, and who were so far from suspecting what a notable figure had\npassed across their placid vision. One person only was urgent in his\nquestioning. On an afternoon when Mrs Warricombe and her daughters were\nalone, the Rev. Bruno Chilvers made a call.\n\n'Oh!' he exclaimed, after a few minutes' conversation, 'I am so anxious\nto ask you what has become of Mr. Peak. Soon after my arrival in\nExeter, I went to see him, and we had a long talk--a most interesting\ntalk. Then I heard all at once that he was gone, and that we should see\nno more of him. Where is he? What is he doing?'\n\nThere was a barely appreciable delay before Mrs. Warricombe made answer.\n\n'We have quite lost sight of him,' she said, with an artificial smile.\n'We know only that he was called away on some urgent business--family\naffairs, I suppose.'\n\nChilvers, in the most natural way, glanced from the speaker to Sidwell,\nand instantly, without the slightest change of expression, brought his\neyes back again.\n\n'I hope most earnestly,' he went on, in his fluty tone, 'that he will\nreturn. A most interesting man! A man of _large_ intellectual scope,\nand really _broad_ sympathies. I looked forward to many a chat with\nhim. Has he, I wonder, been led to change his views? Possibly he would\nfind a secular sphere more adapted to his special powers.'\n\nMrs. Warricombe had nothing to say. Sidwell, finding that Mr Chilvers'\nsmile now beamed in her direction, replied to him with steady utterance:\n\n'It isn't uncommon, I think, nowadays, for doubts to interfere with the\ncourse of study for ordination?'\n\n'Far from uncommon!' exclaimed the Rector of St. Margaret's, with\nalmost joyous admission of the fact. 'Very far from uncommon. Such\nstudents have my profound sympathy. I know from experience exactly what\nit means to be overcome in a struggle with the modern spirit. Happily\nfor myself, I was enabled to recover what for a time I lost. But\ncharity forbid that I should judge those who think they must needs\nvoyage for ever in sunless gulfs of doubt, or even absolutely deny that\nthe human intellect can be enlightened from above.'\n\nAt a loss even to follow this rhetoric, Mrs. Warricombe, who was\ndelighted to welcome the Rev. Bruno, and regarded him as a gleaming\npillar of the Church, made haste to introduce a safer topic. After\nthat, Mr. Chilvers was seen at the house with some frequency. Not that\nhe paid more attention to the Warricombes than to his other\nacquaintances. Relieved by his curate from the uncongenial burden of\nmere parish affairs, he seemed to regard himself as an apostle at\nlarge, whose mission directed him to the households of well-to-do\npeople throughout the city. His brother clergymen held him in slight\nesteem. In private talk with Martin Warricombe, Mr. Lilywhite did not\nhesitate to call him 'a mountebank', and to add other depreciatory\nremarks.\n\n'My wife tells me--and I can trust her judgment in such things--that\nhis sole object just now is to make a good marriage. Rather\ndisagreeable stories seem to have followed him from the other side of\nEngland. He makes love to all unmarried women--never going beyond what\nis thought permissible, but doing a good deal of mischief, I fancy. One\nlady in Exeter--I won't mention names--has already pulled him up with a\ndirect inquiry as to his intentions; at her house, I imagine, he will\nno more be seen.'\n\nThe genial parson chuckled over his narrative, and Martin, by no means\npredisposed in the Rev. Bruno's favour, took care to report these\nmatters to his wife.\n\n'I don't believe a word of it!' exclaimed Mrs. Warricombe. 'All the\nclergy are jealous of Mr. Chilvers.'\n\n'What? Of his success with ladies?'\n\n'Martin! It is something new for you to be profane!--They are jealous\nof his high reputation.'\n\n'Rather a serious charge against our respectable friends.'\n\n'And the stories are all nonsense,' pursued Mrs. Warricombe. 'It's very\nwrong of Mr. Lilywhite to report such things. I don't believe any other\nclergyman would have done so.'\n\nMartin smiled--as he had been accustomed to do all through his married\nlife--and let the discussion rest there. On the next occasion of Mr.\nChilvers being at the house, he observed the reverend man's behaviour\nwith Sidwell, and was not at all pleased. Bruno had a way of addressing\nwomen which certainly went beyond the ordinary limits of courtesy. At a\nlittle distance, anyone would have concluded that he was doing his best\nto excite Sidwell's affectionate interest. The matter of his discourse\nmight be unobjectionable, but the manner of it was not in good taste.\n\nMrs. Warricombe was likewise observant, but with other emotions. To her\nit seemed a subject for pleasurable reflection, that Mr. Chilvers\nshould show interest in Sidwell. The Rev. Bruno had bright prospects.\nWith the colour of his orthodoxy she did not concern herself. He was\nticketed 'broad', a term which carried with it no disparagement; and\nSidwell's sympathies were altogether with the men of 'breadth'. The\ntime drew near when Sidwell must marry, if she ever meant to do so, and\nin comparison with such candidates as Mr Walsh and Godwin Peak, the\nRector of St. Margaret's would be an ideal husband for her. Sidwell's\nattitude towards Mr. Chilvers was not encouraging, but Mrs. Warricombe\nsuspected that a lingering regard for the impostor, so lately unmasked,\nstill troubled her daughter's mind: a new suitor, even if rejected,\nwould help the poor girl to dismiss that shocking infatuation.\n\nSidwell and her father nowadays spent much time together, and in the\nautumn days it became usual for them to have an afternoon ramble about\nthe lanes. Their talk was of science and literature, occasionally\nskirting very close upon those questions which both feared to discuss\nplainly--for a twofold reason. Sidwell read much more than had been her\nwont, and her choice of authors would alone have indicated a change in\nher ways of thinking, even if she had not allowed it to appear in the\ntenor of her talk. The questions she put with reference to Martin's\nfavourite studies were sometimes embarrassing.\n\nOne day they happened to meet Mr. Chilvers, who was driving with his\neldest child, a boy of four. The narrowness of the road made it\nimpossible--as Martin would have wished--to greet and pass on. Chilvers\nstopped the carriage and jumped out. Sidwell could not but pay some\nattention to the youthful Chilvers.\n\n'Till he is ten years old,' cried Bruno, 'I shall think much more of\nhis body than of his mind. In fact, at this age the body _is_ the mind.\nBooks, books--oh, we attach far too much importance to them. Over-study\nis one of the morbific tendencies of our time. Some one or other has\nbeen trying to frown down what he calls the excessive athleticism of\nour public schools. No, no! Let us rejoice that our lads have such an\nopportunity of vigorous physical development. The culture of the body\nis a great part of religion.' He always uttered remarks of this kind as\nif suggesting that his hearers should note them in a collection of\naphorisms. 'If to labour is to pray, so also is the practice of\nopen-air recreation.\n\nWhen they had succeeded in getting away, father and daughter walked for\nsome minutes without speaking. At length Sidwell asked, with a smile:\n\n'How does this form of Christianity strike you?'\n\n'Why, very much like a box on the ear with a perfumed glove,' replied\nMartin.\n\n'That describes it very well.'\n\nThey walked a little further, and Sidwell spoke in a more serious tone.\n\n'If Mr. Chilvers were brought before the ecclesiastical authorities and\ncompelled to make a clear statement of his faith, what sect, in all the\nhistory of heresies, would he really seem to belong to?'\n\n'I know too little of him, and too little of heresies.'\n\n'Do you suppose for a moment that he sincerely believes the dogmas of\nhis Church?'\n\nMartin bit his lip and looked uneasy.\n\n'We can't judge him, Sidwell.'\n\n'I don't know,' she persisted. 'It seems to me that he does his best to\ngive us the means of judging him. I half believe that he often laughs\nin himself at the success of his audacity.'\n\n'No, no. I think the man is sincere.'\n\nThis was very uncomfortable ground, but Sidwell would not avoid it. Her\neyes flashed, and she spoke with a vehemence such as Martin had never\nseen in her.\n\n'Undoubtedly sincere in his determination to make a figure in the\nworld. But a Christian, in any intelligible sense of that much-abused\nword,--no! He is one type of the successful man of our day. Where\nthousands of better and stronger men struggle vainly for fair\nrecognition, he and his kind are glorified. In comparison with a really\nenergetic man, he is an acrobat. The crowd stares at him and applauds,\nand there is nothing he cares for so much as that kind of admiration.'\n\nMartin kept silence, and in a few minutes succeeded in broaching a\nwholly different subject.\n\nNot long after this, Mr. Chilvers paid a call at the conventional hour.\nSidwell, hoping to escape, invited two girls to step out with her on to\nthe lawn. The sun was sinking, and, as she stood with eyes fixed upon\nit, the Rev. Bruno's voice disagreeably broke her reverie. She was\nperforce involved in a dialogue, her companions moving aside.\n\n'What a magnificent sky!' murmured Chilvers. '\"There sinks the nebulous\nstar.\" Forgive me, I have fallen into a tiresome trick of quoting. How\ndifferently a sunset is viewed nowadays from what it was in old times!\nOur impersonal emotions are on a higher plane--don't you think so? Yes,\nscientific discovery has done more for religion than all the ages of\npious imagination. A theory of Galileo or Newton is more to the soul\nthan a psalm of David.'\n\n'You think so?' Sidwell asked, coldly.\n\nIn everyday conversation she was less suave than formerly. This summer\nshe had never worn her spray of sweet-brier, and the omission might\nhave been deemed significant of a change in herself. When the occasion\noffered, she no longer hesitated to express a difference of opinion; at\ntimes she uttered her dissent with a bluntness which recalled\nBuckland's manner in private.\n\n'Does the comparison seem to you unbecoming?' said Chilvers, with\ngenial condescension. 'Or untrue?'\n\n'What do you mean by \"the soul\"?' she inquired, still gazing away from\nhim.\n\n'The principle of conscious life in man--that which understands and\nworships.'\n\n'The two faculties seem to me so different that'----She broke off. 'But\nI mustn't talk foolishly about such things.'\n\n'I feel sure you have thought of them to some purpose. I wonder whether\nyou ever read Francis Newman's book on _The Soul_?'\n\n'No, I never saw it.'\n\n'Allow me to recommend it to you. I believe you would find it deeply\ninteresting.'\n\n'Does the Church approve it?'\n\n'The Church?' He smiled. 'Ah! what Church? Churchmen there are,\nunfortunately, who detest the name of its author, but I hope you have\nnever classed me among them. The Church, rightly understood,\ncomprehends every mind and heart that is striving upwards. The age of\nintolerance will soon be as remote from us as that of persecution. Can\nI be mistaken in thinking that this broader view has your sympathy,\nMiss Warricombe?'\n\n'I can't sympathise with what I don't understand, Mr. Chilvers.'\n\nHe looked at her with tender solicitude, bending slightly from his\nusual square-shouldered attitude.\n\n'Do let me find an opportunity of talking over the whole matter with\nyou--by no means as an instructor. In my view, a clergyman may seek\ninstruction from the humblest of those who are called his flock. The\nthoughtful and high-minded among them will often assist him materially\nin his endeavour at self-development. To my \"flock\",' he continued,\nplayfully, 'you don't belong; but may I not count you one of that\ncircle of friends to whom I look for the higher kind of sympathy?'\n\nSidwell glanced about her in the hope that some one might be\napproaching. Her two friends were at a distance, talking and laughing\ntogether.\n\n'You shall tell me some day,' she replied, with more attention to\ncourtesy, 'what the doctrines of the Broad Church really are. But the\nair grows too cool to be pleasant; hadn't we better return to the\ndrawing-room?'\n\nThe greater part of the winter went by before she had again to submit\nto a tete-a-tete with the Rev. Bruno. It was seldom that she thought of\nhim save when compelled to do so by his exacting presence, but in the\nmeantime he exercised no small influence on her mental life. Insensibly\nshe was confirmed in her alienation from all accepted forms of\nreligious faith. Whether she wished it or not, it was inevitable that\nsuch a process should keep her constantly in mind of Godwin Peak. Her\ndesire to talk with him at times became so like passion that she\nappeared to herself to love him more truly than ever. Yet such a mood\nwas always followed by doubt, and she could not say whether the\nreaction distressed or soothed her. These months that had gone by\nbrought one result, not to be disguised. Whatever the true nature of\nher feeling for Godwin, the thought of marrying him was so difficult to\nface that it seemed to involve impossibilities. He himself had warned\nher that marriage would mean severance from all her kindred. It was\npractically true, and time would only increase the difficulty of such a\ndetermination.\n\nThe very fact that her love (again, if love it were) must be indulged\nin defiance of universal opinion tended to keep emotion alive. A woman\nis disposed to cling to a lover who has disgraced himself, especially\nif she can believe that the disgrace was incurred as a result of\ndevotion to her. Could love be separated from thought of marriage,\nSidwell would have encouraged herself in fidelity, happy in the\nprospect of a life-long spiritual communion--for she would not doubt of\nGodwin's upward progress, of his eventual purification. But this was a\nmere dream. If Godwin's passion were steadfast, the day would come when\nshe must decide either to cast in her lot with his, or to bid him be\nfree. And could she imagine herself going forth into exile?\n\nThere came a letter from him, and she was fortunate enough to receive\nit without the knowledge of her relatives. He wrote that he had\nobtained employment. The news gave her a troubled joy, lasting for\nseveral days. That no emotion appeared in her reply was due to a fear\nlest she might be guilty of misleading him. Perhaps already she had\ndone so. Her last whisper--'Some day!'--was it not a promise and an\nappeal? Now she had not the excuse of profound agitation, there must be\nno word her conscience could not justify. But in writing those formal\nlines she felt herself a coward. She was drawing back--preparing her\nescape.\n\nOften she had the letter beneath her pillow. It was the first she had\never received from a man who professed to love her. So long without\nromance in her life, she could not but entertain this semblance of it,\nand feel that she was still young.\n\nIt told much in Godwin's favour that he had not ventured to write\nbefore there was this news to send her. It testified to the force of\nhis character, the purity of his purpose. A weaker man, she knew, would\nhave tried to excite her compassion by letters of mournful strain,\nmight even have distressed her with attempts at clandestine meeting.\nShe had said rightly--his nature was not base. And she loved him! She\nwas passionately grateful to him for proving that her love had not been\nunworthily bestowed.\n\nWhen he wrote again, her answer should not be cowardly.\n\nThe life of the household went on as it had been wont to do for years,\nbut with the spring came events. An old lady died whilst on a visit to\nthe house (she was a half-sister of Mrs. Warricombe), and by a will\nexecuted a few years previously she left a thousand pounds, to be\nequally divided between the children of this family. Sidwell smiled\nsadly on finding herself in possession of this bequest, the first sum\nof any importance that she had ever held in her own right. If she\nmarried a man of whom all her kith and kin so strongly disapproved that\nthey would not give her even a wedding present, two hundred and fifty\npounds would be better than no dowry at all. One could furnish a house\nwith it.\n\nThen Fanny had an attack of bronchitis, and whilst she was recovering\nBuckland came down for a few days, bringing with him a piece of news\nfor which no one was prepared. As if to make reparation to his elder\nsister for the harshness with which he had behaved in the affair of\nGodwin Peak, he chose her for his first confidante.\n\n'Sidwell, I am going to be married. Do you care to hear about it?'\n\n'Certainly I do.'\n\nLong ago she had been assured of Sylvia Moorhouse's sincerity in\nrejecting Buckland's suit. That was still a grief to her, but she\nacknowledged her friend's wisdom, and was now very curious to learn who\nit was that the Radical had honoured with his transferred affections.\n\n'The lady's name,' Buckland began, 'is Miss Matilda Renshaw. She is the\nsecond daughter of a dealer in hides, tallow, and that kind of thing.\nBoth her parents are dead; she has lived of late with her married\nsister at Blackheath.'\n\nSidwell listened with no slight astonishment, and her countenance\nlooked what she felt.\n\n'That's the bald statement of the cause,' pursued her brother, seeming\nto enjoy the consternation he had excited. 'Now, let me fill up the\noutline. Miss Renshaw is something more than good-looking, has had an\nadmirable education, is five-and-twenty, and for a couple of years has\nbeen actively engaged in humanitarian work in the East End. She has\npublished a book on social questions, and is a very good public\nspeaker. Finally, she owns property representing between three and four\nthousand a year.'\n\n'The picture has become more attractive,' said Sidwell.\n\n'You imagined a rather different person? If I persuade mother to invite\nher down here presently, do you think you could be friendly with her?'\n\n'I see no reason why I should not be.'\n\n'But I must warn you. She has nothing to do with creeds and dogmas.'\n\nHe tried to read her face. Sidwell's mind was a mystery to him.\n\n'I shall make no inquiry about her religious views,' his sister\nreplied, in a dispassionate tone, which conveyed no certain meaning.\n\n'Then I feel sure you will like her, and equally sure that she will\nlike you.'\n\nHis parents had no distinct fault to find with this choice, though they\nwould both greatly have preferred a daughter-in-law whose genealogy\ncould be more freely spoken of. Miss Renshaw was invited to Exeter, and\nthe first week of June saw her arrival. Buckland had in no way\nexaggerated her qualities. She was a dark-eyed beauty, perfect from the\nsocial point of view, a very interesting talker,--in short, no ordinary\nwoman. That Buckland should have fallen in love with her, even after\nSylvia, was easily understood; it seemed likely that she would make him\nas good a wife as he could ever hope to win.\n\nSidwell was expecting another letter from the north of England. The\nsilence which during those first months had been justifiable was now a\nsource of anxiety. But whether fear or hope predominated in her\nexpectancy, she still could not decide. She had said to herself that\nher next reply should not be cowardly, yet she was as far as ever from\na courageous resolve.\n\nMental harassment told upon her health. Martin, watching her with\nsolicitude, declared that for her sake as much as for Fanny's they must\nhave a thorough holiday abroad.\n\nUrged by the approaching departure, Sidwell overcame her reluctance to\nwrite to Godwin before she had a letter to answer. It was done in a\nmood of intolerable despondency, when life looked barren before her,\nand the desire of love all but triumphed over every other\nconsideration. The letter written and posted, she would gladly have\nrecovered it--reserved, formal as it was. Cowardly still; but then\nGodwin had not written.\n\nShe kept a watch upon the postman, and again, when Godwin's reply was\ndelivered, escaped detection.\n\nHardly did she dare to open the envelope. Her letter had perchance been\nmore significant than she supposed; and did not the mere fact of her\nwriting invite a lover's frankness?\n\nBut the reply was hardly more moving than if it had come from a total\nstranger. For a moment she felt relieved; in an hour's time she\nsuffered indescribable distress. Godwin wrote--so she convinced herself\nafter repeated perusals--as if discharging a task; not a word suggested\ntenderness. Had the letter been unsolicited, she could have used it\nlike the former one; but it was the answer to an appeal. The phrases\nshe had used were still present in her mind. 'I am anxious . . . it is\nmore than half a year since you wrote . . . I have been expecting . . .\nanything that is of interest to you will interest me. . . .' How could\nshe imagine that this was reserved and formal? Shame fell upon her; she\nlocked herself from all companionship, and wept in rebellion against\nthe laws of life.\n\nA fortnight later, she wrote from Royat to Sylvia Moorhouse. It was a\nlong epistle, full of sunny descriptions, breathing renewed vigour of\nbody and mind. The last paragraph ran thus:\n\n'Yesterday was my birthday; I was twenty-eight. At this age, it is\nwisdom in a woman to remind herself that youth is over. I don't regret\nit; let it go with all its follies! But I am sorry that I have no\nserious work in life; it is not cheerful to look forward to perhaps\nanother eight-and-twenty years of elegant leisure--that is to say, of\nwearisome idleness. What can I do? Try and think of some task for me,\nsomething that will last a lifetime.'\n\n\n\n\nPart VII\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nAt the close of a sultry day in September, when factory fumes hung low\nover the town of St. Helen's, and twilight thickened luridly, and the\nair tasted of sulphur, and the noises of the streets, muffled in their\njoint effect, had individually an ominous distinctness, Godwin Peak\nwalked with languid steps to his lodgings and the meal that there\nawaited him. His vitality was at low ebb. The routine of his life\ndisgusted him; the hope of release was a mockery. What was to be the\nlimit of this effort to redeem his character? How many years before the\npast could be forgotten, and his claim to the style of honourable be\ndeemed secure? Rubbish! It was an idea out of old-fashioned romances.\nWhat he was, he was, and no extent of dogged duration at St. Helen's or\nelsewhere, could affect his personality. What, practically, was to be\nthe end? If Sidwell had no money of her own, and no expectations from\nher father, how could she ever become his wife? Women liked this kind\nof thing, this indefinite engagement to marry when something should\nhappen, which in all likelihood never would happen--this fantastic\nmutual fidelity with only the airiest reward. Especially women of a\ncertain age.\n\nA heavy cart seemed to be rumbling in the next street. No, it was\nthunder. If only a good rattling storm would sweep the bituminous\natmosphere, and allow a breath of pure air before midnight.\n\nShe could not be far from thirty. Of course there prevails much\nconventional nonsense about women's age; there are plenty of women who\nreckon four decades, and yet retain all the essential charm of their\nsex. And as a man gets older, as he begins to persuade himself that at\nforty one has scarce reached the prime of life----\n\nThe storm was coming on in earnest. Big drops began to fall. He\nquickened his pace, reached home, and rang the bell for a light.\n\nHis landlady came in with the announcement that a gentleman had called\nto see him, about an hour ago; he would come again at seven o'clock.\n\n'What name?'\n\nNone had been given. A youngish gentleman, speaking like a Londoner.\n\nIt might be Earwaker, but that was not likely. Godwin sat down to his\nplain meal, and after it lit a pipe. Thunder was still rolling, but now\nin the distance. He waited impatiently for seven o'clock.\n\nTo the minute, sounded a knock at the house-door. A little delay, and\nthere appeared Christian Moxey.\n\nGodwin was surprised and embarrassed. His visitor had a very grave\nface, and was thinner, paler, than three years ago; he appeared to\nhesitate, but at length offered his hand.\n\n'I got your address from Earwaker. I was obliged to see you--on\nbusiness.'\n\n'Business?'\n\n'May I take my coat off? We shall have to talk.'\n\nThey sat down, and Godwin, unable to strike the note of friendship lest\nhe should be met with repulse, broke silence by regretting that Moxey\nshould have had to make a second call.\n\n'Oh, that's nothing! I went and had dinner.--Peak, my sister is dead.'\n\nTheir eyes met; something of the old kindness rose to either face.\n\n'That must be a heavy blow to you,' murmured Godwin, possessed with a\nstrange anticipation which he would not allow to take clear form.\n\n'It is. She was ill for three months.' Whilst staying in the country\nlast June she met with an accident. She went for a long walk alone one\nday, and in a steep lane she came up with a carter who was trying to\nmake a wretched horse drag a load beyond its strength. The fellow was\nperhaps half drunk; he stood there beating the horse unmercifully.\nMarcella couldn't endure that kind of thing--impossible for her to pass\non and say nothing. She interfered, and tried to persuade the man to\nlighten his cart. He was insolent, attacked the horse more furiously\nthan ever, and kicked it so violently in the stomach that it fell. Even\nthen he wouldn't stop his brutality. Marcella tried to get between him\nand the animal--just as it lashed out with its heels. The poor girl was\nso badly injured that she lay by the roadside until another carter took\nher up and brought her back to the village. Three months of accursed\nsuffering, and then happily came the end.'\n\nA far, faint echoing of thunder filled the silence of their voices.\nHeavy rain splashed upon the pavement.\n\n'She said to me just before her death,' resumed Christian, '\"I have ill\nluck when I try to do a kindness--but perhaps there is one more\nchance.\" I didn't know what she meant till afterwards. Peak, she has\nleft nearly all her money to you.'\n\nGodwin knew it before the words were spoken. His heart leaped, and only\nthe dread of being observed enabled him to control his features. When\nhis tongue was released he said harshly:\n\n'Of course I can't accept it.'\n\nThe words were uttered independently of his will. He had no such\nthought, and the sound of his voice shook him with alarm.\n\n'Why can't you?' returned Christian.\n\n'I have no right--it belongs to you, or to some other relative--it\nwould be'----\n\nHis stammering broke off. Flushes and chills ran through him; he could\nnot raise his eyes from the ground.\n\n'It belongs to no one but you,' said Moxey, with cold persistence. 'Her\nlast wish was to do you a kindness, and I, at all events, shall never\nconsent to frustrate her intention. The legacy represents something\nmore than eight hundred a year, as the investments now stand. This will\nmake you independent--of everything and everybody.' He looked meaningly\nat the listener. 'Her own life was not a very happy one; she did what\nshe could to save yours from a like doom.'\n\nGodwin at last looked up.\n\n'Did she speak of me during her illness?'\n\n'She asked me once, soon after the accident, what had become of you. As\nI knew from Earwaker, I was able to tell her.'\n\nA long silence followed. Christian's voice was softer when he resumed.\n\n'You never knew her. She was the one woman in ten thousand--at once\nstrong and gentle; a fine intellect, and a heart of rare tenderness.\nBut because she had not the kind of face that'----\n\nHe checked himself.\n\n'To the end her mind kept its clearness and courage. One day she\nreminded me of Heine--how we had talked of that \"conversion\" on the\nmattress-grave, and had pitied the noble intellect subdued by disease.\n\"I shan't live long enough,\" she said, \"to incur that danger. What I\nhave thought ever since I could study, I think now, and shall to the\nlast moment.\" I buried her without forms of any kind, in the cemetery\nat Kingsmill. That was what she wished. I should have despised myself\nif I had lacked that courage.'\n\n'It was right,' muttered Godwin.\n\n'And I wear no mourning, you see. All that kind of thing is ignoble. I\nam robbed of a priceless companionship, but I don't care to go about\ninviting people's pity. If only I could forget those months of\nsuffering! Some day I shall, perhaps, and think of her only as she\nlived.'\n\n'Were you alone with her all the time?'\n\n'No. Our cousin Janet was often with us.' Christian spoke with averted\nface. 'You don't know, of course, that she has gone in for medical\nwork--practises at Kingsmill. The accident was at a village called\nLowton, ten miles or more from Kingsmill. Janet came over very often.'\n\nGodwin mused on this development of the girl whom he remembered so\nwell. He could not direct his thoughts; a languor had crept over him.\n\n'Do you recollect, Peak,' said Christian, presently, 'the talk we had\nin the fields by Twybridge, when we first met?'\n\nThe old friendliness was reappearing in his manner, He was yielding to\nthe impulse to be communicative, confidential, which had always\ncharacterised him.\n\n'I remember,' Godwin murmured.\n\n'If only my words then had had any weight with you! And if only I had\nacted upon my own advice! Just for those few weeks I was sane; I\nunderstood something of life; I saw my true way before me. You and I\nhave both gone after ruinous ideals, instead of taking the solid good\nheld out to us. Of course, I know your story in outline. I don't ask\nyou to talk about it. You are independent now, and I hope you can use\nyour freedom.--Well, and I too am free.'\n\nThe last words were in a lower tone. Godwin glanced at the speaker,\nwhose sadness was not banished, but illumined with a ray of calm hope.\n\n'Have you ever thought of me and my infatuation?' Christian asked.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'I have outlived that mawkish folly. I used to drink too much; the two\nthings went well together. It would shame me to tell you all about it.\nBut, happily, I have been able to go back about thirteen years--recover\nmy old sane self--and with it what I then threw away.'\n\n'I understand.'\n\n'Do you? Marcella knew of it, just before her death, and it made her\nglad. But the waste of years, the best part of a lifetime! It's\nincredible to me as I look back. Janet called on us one day in London.\nHeaven be thanked that she was forgiving enough to do so! What would\nhave become of me now?'\n\n'How are you going to live, then?' Godwin asked, absently.\n\n'How? My income is sufficient'----\n\n'No, no; I mean, where and how will you live in your married life?'\n\n'That's still uncertain. Janet mustn't go on with professional work. In\nany case, I don't think she could for long; her strength isn't equal to\nit. But I shouldn't wonder if we settle in Kingsmill. To you it would\nseem intolerable? But why should we live in London? At Kingsmill Janet\nhas a large circle of friends; in London we know scarcely half-a-dozen\npeople--of the kind it would give us any pleasure to live with. We\nshall have no lack of intellectual society; Janet knows some of the\nWhitelaw professors. The atmosphere of Kingsmill isn't illiberal, you\nknow; we shan't be fought shy of because we object to pass Sundays in a\nstate of coma. But the years that I have lost! The irrecoverable years!'\n\n'There's nothing so idle as regretting the past,' said Godwin, with\nsome impatience. 'Why groan over what couldn't be otherwise? The\nprobability is, Janet and you are far better suited to each other now\nthan you ever would have been if you had married long ago.'\n\n'You think that?' exclaimed the other, eagerly. 'I have tried to see it\nin that light. If I didn't feel so despicable!'\n\n'She, I take it, doesn't think you so,' Godwin muttered.\n\n'But how can she understand? I have tried to tell her everything, but\nshe refused to listen. Perhaps Marcella told her all she cared to know.'\n\n'No doubt.'\n\nEach brooded for a while over his own affairs, then Christian reverted\nto the subject which concerned them both.\n\n'Let us speak frankly. You will take this gift of Marcella's as it was\nmeant?'\n\nHow _was_ it meant? Critic and analyst as ever, Godwin could not be\ncontent to see in it the simple benefaction of a woman who died loving\nhim. Was it not rather the last subtle device of jealousy? Marcella\nknew that the legacy would be a temptation he could scarcely\nresist--and knew at the same time that, if he accepted it, he\npractically renounced his hope of marrying Sidwell Warricombe.\nDoubtless she had learned as much as she needed to know of Sidwell's\nposition. Refusing this bequest, he was as far as ever from the\npossibility of asking Sidwell to marry him. Profiting by it, he stood\nfor ever indebted to Marcella, must needs be grateful to her, and some\nday, assuredly, would reveal the truth to whatever woman became his\nwife. Conflict of reasonings and emotions made it difficult to answer\nMoxey's question.\n\n'I must take time to think of it,' he said, at length.\n\n'Well, I suppose that is right. But--well, I know so little of your\ncircumstances'----\n\n'Is that strictly true?' Peak asked.\n\n'Yes. I have only the vaguest idea of what you have been doing since\nyou left us. Of course I have tried to find out.'\n\nGodwin smiled, rather gloomily.\n\n'We won't talk of it. I suppose you stay in St. Helen's for the night?'\n\n'There's a train at 10.20. I had better go by it.'\n\n'Then let us forget everything but your own cheerful outlook. At ten,\nI'll walk with you to the station.'\n\nReluctantly at first, but before long with a quiet abandonment to the\njoy that would not be suppressed, Christian talked of his future wife.\nIn Janet he found every perfection. Her mind was something more than\nthe companion of his own. Already she had begun to inspire him with a\nhopeful activity, and to foster the elements of true manliness which he\nwas conscious of possessing, though they had never yet had free play.\nWith a sense of luxurious safety, he submitted to her influence,\nknowing none the less that it was in his power to complete her\nimperfect life. Studiously he avoided the word 'ideal'; from such\nvaporous illusions he had turned to the world's actualities; his\nlanguage dealt with concretes, with homely satisfactions, with\nprospects near enough to be soberly examined.\n\nA hurry to catch the train facilitated parting. Godwin promised to\nwrite in a few days.\n\nHe took a roundabout way back to his lodgings. The rain was over, the\nsky had become placid. He was conscious of an effect from Christian's\nconversation which half counteracted the mood he would otherwise have\nindulged,--the joy of liberty and of an outlook wholly new. Sidwell\nmight perchance be to him all that Janet was to Christian. Was it not\nthe luring of 'ideals' that prompted him to turn away from his long\nhope?\n\nThere must be no more untruthfulness. Sidwell must have all the facts\nlaid before her, and make her choice.\n\nWithout a clear understanding of what he was going to write, he sat\ndown at eleven o'clock, and began, 'Dear Miss Warricombe'. Why not\n'Dear Sidwell'? He took another sheet of paper.\n\n'Dear Sidwell,--To-night I can remember only your last word to me when\nwe parted. I cannot address you coldly, as though half a stranger. Thus\nlong I have kept silence about everything but the outward events of my\nlife; now, in telling you of something that has happened, I must speak\nas I think.\n\n'Early this evening I was surprised by a visit from Christian Moxey--a\nname you know. He came to tell me that his sister (she of whom I once\nspoke to you) was dead, and had bequeathed to me a large sum of money.\nHe said that it represented an income of eight hundred pounds.\n\n'I knew nothing of Miss Moxey's illness, and the news of her will came\nto me as a surprise. In word or deed, I never sought more than her\nsimple friendship--and even _that_ I believed myself to have forfeited.\n\n'If I were to refuse this money, it would be in consequence of a\nscruple which I do not in truth respect. Christian Moxey tells me that\nhis sister's desire was to enable me to live the life of a free man;\nand if I have any duty at all in the matter, surely it does not\nconstrain me to defeat her kindness. No condition whatever is attached.\nThe gift releases me from the necessity of leading a hopeless\nexistence--leaves me at liberty to direct my life how I will.\n\n'I wish, then, to put aside all thoughts of how this opportunity came\nto me, and to ask you if you are willing to be my wife.\n\n'Though I have never written a word of love, my love is unchanged. The\npassionate hope of three years ago still rules my life. Is _your_ love\nstrong enough to enable you to disregard all hindrances? I cannot of\ncourse know whether, in your sight, dishonour still clings to me, or\nwhether you understand me well enough to have forgiven and forgotten\nthose hateful things in the past. Is it yet too soon? Do you wish me\nstill to wait, still to prove myself? Is your interest in the free man\nless than in the slave? For my life has been one of slavery and\nexile--exile, if you know what I mean by it, from the day of my birth.\n\n'Dearest, grant me this great happiness! We can live where we will. I\nam not rich enough to promise all the comforts and refinements to which\nyou are accustomed, but we should be safe from sordid anxieties. We can\ntravel; we can make a home in any European city. It would be idle to\nspeak of the projects and ambitions that fill my mind--but surely I may\ndo something worth doing, win some position among intellectual men of\nwhich you would not be ashamed. You yourself urged me to hope that.\nWith you at my side--Sidwell grant me this chance, that I may know the\njoy of satisfied love! I am past the age which is misled by vain fancies.\nI have suffered unspeakably, longed for the calm strength, the pure,\nsteady purpose which would result to me from a happy marriage. There is\nno fatal divergence between our minds; did you not tell me that? You\nsaid that if I had been truthful from the first, you might have loved\nme with no misgiving. Forget the madness into which I was betrayed.\nThere is no soil upon my spirit. I offer you love as noble as any man\nis capable of. Think--think well--before replying to me; let your true\nself prevail. You _did_ love me, dearest.----\n\nYours ever, Godwin Peak.'\n\nAt first he wrote slowly, as though engaged on a literary composition,\nwith erasions, insertions. Facts once stated, he allowed himself to\nforget how Sidwell would most likely view them, and thereafter his pen\nhastened: fervour inspired the last paragraph. Sidwell's image had\nbecome present to him, and exercised all--or nearly all--its old\ninfluence.\n\nThe letter must be copied, because of that laboured beginning. Copying\none's own words is at all times a disenchanting drudgery, and when the\nend was reached Godwin signed his name with hasty contempt. What answer\ncould he expect to such an appeal? How vast an improbability that\nSidwell would consent to profit by the gift of Marcella Moxey!\n\nYet how otherwise could he write? With what show of sincerity could he\n_offer_ to refuse the bequest? Nay, in that case he must not offer to\ndo so, but simply state the fact that his refusal was beyond recall.\nLogically, he had chosen the only course open to him,--for to refuse\nindependence was impossible.\n\nA wheezy clock in his landlady's kitchen was striking two. For very\nfear of having to revise his letter in the morning, he put it into its\nenvelope, and went out to the nearest pillar-post.\n\nThat was done. Whether Sidwell answered with 'Yes' or with 'No', he was\na free man.\n\nOn the morrow he went to his work as usual, and on the day after that.\nThe third morning might bring a reply--but did not. On the evening of\nthe fifth day, when he came home, there lay the expected letter. He\nfelt it; it was light and thin. That hideous choking of suspense--Well,\nit ran thus:\n\n'I cannot. It is not that I am troubled by your accepting the legacy.\nYou have every right to do so, and I know that your life will justify\nthe hopes of her who thus befriended you. But I am too weak to take\nthis step. To ask you to wait yet longer, would only be a fresh\ncowardice. You cannot know how it shames me to write this. In my very\nheart I believe I love you, but what is such love worth? You must\ndespise me, and you will forget me. I live in a little world; in the\ngreater world where your place is, you will win a love very different.\n\nS. W.'\n\nGodwin laughed aloud as the paper dropped from his hand.\n\nWell, she was not the heroine of a romance. Had he expected her to\nleave home and kindred--the 'little world' so infinitely dear to\nher--and go forth with a man deeply dishonoured? Very young girls have\nbeen known to do such a thing; but a thoughtful mature woman----!\nPresent, his passion had dominated her: and perhaps her nerves only.\nBut she had had time to recover from that weakness.\n\nA woman, like most women of cool blood, temperate fancies. A domestic\nwoman; the ornament of a typical English home.\n\nMost likely it was true that the matter of the legacy did not trouble\nher. In any case she would not have consented to marry him, and\n_therefore_ she knew no jealousy. Her love! why, truly, what was it\nworth?\n\n(Much, much! of no less than infinite value. He knew it, but this was\nnot the moment for such a truth.)\n\nA cup of tea to steady the nerves. Then thoughts, planning,\nworld-building.\n\nHe was awake all night, and Sidwell's letter lay within reach.--Did\n_she_ sleep calmly? Had she never stretched out her hand for _his_\nletter, when all was silent? There were men who would not take such a\nrefusal. A scheme to meet her once more--the appeal of passion, face to\nface, heart to heart--the means of escape ready--and then the 'greater\nworld'----\n\nBut neither was he cast in heroic mould. He had not the\nself-confidence, he had not the hot, youthful blood. A critic of life,\nan analyst of moods and motives; not the man who dares and acts. The\nonly important resolve he had ever carried through was a scheme of\nignoble trickery--to end in frustration.\n\n'The greater world'. It was a phrase that had been in his own mind once\nor twice since Moxey's visit. To point him thither was doubtless the\none service Sidwell could render him. And in a day or two, that phrase\nwas all that remained to him of her letter.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon at the end of October, Godwin once more climbed\nthe familiar stairs at Staple Inn, and was welcomed by his friend\nEarwaker. The visit was by appointment. Earwaker knew all about the\nlegacy; that it was accepted; and that Peak had only a few days to\nspend in London, on his way to the Continent.\n\n'You are regenerated,' was his remark as Godwin entered.\n\n'Do I look it? Just what I feel. I have shaken off a good (or a bad)\nten years.'\n\nThe speaker's face, at all events in this moment, was no longer that of\na man at hungry issue with the world. He spoke cheerily.\n\n'It isn't often that fortune does a man such a kind turn. One often\nhears it said: If only I could begin life again with all the experience\nI have gained! That is what I _can_ do. I can break utterly with the\npast, and I have learnt how to live in the future.'\n\n'Break utterly with the past?'\n\n'In the practical sense. And even morally to a great extent.'\n\nEarwaker pushed a box of cigars across the table. Godwin accepted the\noffer, and began to smoke. During these moments of silence, the man of\nletters had been turning over a weekly paper, as if in search of some\nparagraph; a smile announced his discovery.\n\n'Here is something that will interest you--possibly you have seen it.'\n\nHe began to read aloud:\n\n'\"On the 23rd inst. was celebrated at St. Bragg's, Torquay, the\nmarriage of the Rev. Bruno Leathwaite Chilvers, late Rector of St\nMargaret's, Exeter, and the Hon. Bertha Harriet Cecilia Jute, eldest\ndaughter of the late Baron Jute. The ceremony was conducted by the Hon.\nand Rev. J. C. Jute, uncle of the bride, assisted by the Rev. F.\nMiller, the Very Rev. Dean Pinnock, the Rev. H. S. Crook, and the Rev.\nWilliam Tomkinson. The bride was given away by Lord Jute. Mr Horatio\nDukinfield was best man. The bridal dress was of white brocade, draped\nwith Brussels lace, the corsage being trimmed with lace and adorned\nwith orange blossoms. The tulle veil, fastened with three diamond\nstars, the gifts of\"----Well, shall I go on?'\n\n'The triumph of Chilvers!' murmured Godwin. 'I wonder whether the Hon.\nBertha is past her fortieth year?'\n\n'A blooming beauty, I dare say. But Lord! how many people it takes to\nmarry a man like Chilvers! How sacred the union must be!--Pray take a\nparagraph more: \"The four bridesmaids--Miss--etc., etc.--wore cream\ncrepon dresses trimmed with turquoise blue velvet, and hats to match.\nThe bridegroom's presents to them were diamond and ruby brooches.\"'\n\n'Chilvers _in excelsis_!--So he is no longer at Exeter; has no living,\nit seems. What does he aim at next, I wonder?'\n\nEarwaker cast meaning glances at his friend.\n\n'I understand you,' said Godwin, at length. 'You mean that this merely\nillustrates my own ambition. Well, you are right, I confess my\nshame--and there's an end of it.'\n\nHe puffed at his cigar, resuming presently:\n\n'But it would be untrue if I said that I regretted anything.\nConstituted as I am, there was no other way of learning my real needs\nand capabilities. Much in the past is hateful to me, but it all had its\nuse. There are men--why, take your own case. You look back on life, no\ndoubt, with calm and satisfaction.'\n\n'Rather, with resignation.'\n\nGodwin let his cigar fall, and laughed bitterly.\n\n'Your resignation has kept pace with life. I was always a rebel. My\ngood qualities--I mean what I say--have always wrecked me. Now that I\nhaven't to fight with circumstances, they may possibly be made\nsubservient to my happiness.'\n\n'But what form is your happiness to take?'\n\n'Well, I am leaving England. On the Continent I shall make no fixed\nabode, but live in the places where cosmopolitan people are to be met.\nI shall make friends; with money at command, one may hope to succeed in\nthat. Hotels, boarding-houses, and so on, offer the opportunities. It\nsounds oddly like the project of a swindler, doesn't it? There's the\ncurse I can't escape from! Though my desires are as pure as those of\nany man living, I am compelled to express myself as if I were about to\ndo something base and underhand. Simply because I have never had a\nsocial place. I am an individual merely; I belong to no class, town,\nfamily, club'----'Cosmopolitan people,' mused Earwaker. 'Your ideal is\ntransformed.'\n\n'As you know. Experience only could bring that about. I seek now only\nthe free, intellectual people--men who have done with the old\nconceptions--women who'----\n\nHis voice grew husky, and he did not complete the sentence. 'I shall\nfind them in Paris, Rome.--Earwaker, think of my being able to speak\nlike this! No day-dreams, but actual sober plans, their execution to\nbegin in a day or two. Paris, Rome! And a month ago I was a hopeless\nslave in a vile manufacturing town.--I wish it were possible for me to\npray for the soul of that poor dead woman. I don't speak to you of her;\nbut do you imagine I am brutally forgetful of her to whom I owe all\nthis?'\n\n'I do you justice,' returned the other, quietly.\n\n'I believe you can and do.'\n\n'How grand it is to go forth as I am now going!' Godwin resumed, after\na long pause. 'Nothing to hide, no shams, no pretences. Let who will\ninquire about me. I am an independent Englishman, with so and so much a\nyear. In England I have one friend only--that is you. The result, you\nsee, of all these years savage striving to knit myself into the social\nfabric.'\n\n'Well, you will invite me some day to your villa at Sorrento,' said\nEarwaker, encouragingly.\n\n'That I shall!' Godwin's eyes flashed with imaginative delight. 'And\nbefore very long. Never to a home in England!'\n\n'By-the-bye, a request. I have never had your portrait. Sit before you\nleave London.'\n\n'No. I'll send you one from Paris--it will be better done.'\n\n'But I am serious. You promise?'\n\n'You shall have the thing in less than a fortnight.'\n\nThe promise was kept. Earwaker received an admirable photograph, which\nhe inserted in his album with a curious sense of satisfaction. A face\nby which every intelligent eye must be arrested; which no two observers\nwould interpret in the same way.\n\n'His mate must be somewhere,' thought the man of letters, 'but he will\nnever find her.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nIn his acceptance of Sidwell's reply, Peak did not care to ask himself\nwhether the delay of its arrival had any meaning one way or another.\nDecency would hardly have permitted her to answer such a letter by\nreturn of post; of course she waited a day or so.\n\nBut the interval meant more than this.\n\nSylvia Moorhouse was staying with her friend. The death of Mrs\nMoorhouse, and the marriage of the mathematical brother, had left\nSylvia homeless, though not in any distressing sense; her inclination\nwas to wander for a year or two, and she remained in England only until\nthe needful arrangements could be concluded.\n\n'You had better come with me,' she said to Sidwell, as they walked\ntogether on the lawn after luncheon.\n\nThe other shook her head.\n\n'Indeed, you had better.--What are you doing here? What are you going\nto make of your life?'\n\n'I don't know.'\n\n'Precisely. Yet one ought to live on some kind of plan. I think it is\ntime you got away from Exeter; it seems to me you are finding its\natmosphere _morbific_.'\n\nSidwell laughed at the allusion.\n\n'You know,' she said, 'that the reverend gentleman is shortly to be\nmarried?'\n\n'Oh yes, I have heard all about it. But is he forsaking the Church?'\n\n'Retiring only for a time, they say.'\n\n'Forgive the question, Sidwell--did he honour you with a proposal?'\n\n'Indeed, no!'\n\n'Some one told me it was imminent, not long ago.'\n\n'Quite a mistake,' Sidwell answered, with her grave smile. 'Mr Chilvers\nhad a singular manner with women in general. It was meant, perhaps, for\nsubtle flattery; he may have thought it the most suitable return for\nthe female worship he was accustomed to receive.'\n\nMr. Warricombe was coming towards them. He brought a new subject of\nconversation, and as they talked the trio drew near to the gate which\nled into the road. The afternoon postman was just entering; Mr\nWarricombe took from him two letters.\n\n'One for you, Sylvia, and--one for you, Sidwell.'\n\nA slight change in his voice caused Sidwell to look at her father as he\nhanded her the letter. In the same moment she recognised the writing of\nthe address. It was Godwin Peak's, and undoubtedly her father knew it.\n\nWith a momentary hesitation Mr. Warricombe continued his talk from the\npoint at which he had broken off, but he avoided his daughter's look,\nand Sidwell was too well aware of an uneasiness which had fallen upon\nhim. In a few minutes he brought the chat to an end, and walked away\ntowards the house.\n\nSidwell held her letter tightly. Conversation was no longer possible\nfor her; she had a painful throbbing of the heart, and felt that her\nface must be playing traitor. Fortunately, Sylvia found it necessary to\nwrite a reply to the missive she had received, and her companion was\nsoon at liberty to seek solitude.\n\nFor more than an hour she remained alone. However unemotional the\ncontents of the letter, its arrival would have perturbed her seriously,\nas in the two previous instances; what she found on opening the\nenvelope threw her into so extreme an agitation that it was long before\nshe could subdue the anguish of disorder in all her senses. She had\ntried to believe that Godwin Peak was henceforth powerless to affect\nher in this way, write what he would. The romance of her life was over;\ntime had brought the solution of difficulties to which she looked\nforward; she recognised the inevitable, as doubtless did Godwin also.\nBut all this was self-deception. The passionate letter delighted as\nmuch as it tortured her; in secret her heart had desired this, though\nreason suppressed and denied the hope. No longer need she remember with\npangs of shame the last letter she had written, and the cold response;\nonce again things were as they should be--the lover pleading before\nher--she with the control of his fate. The injury to her pride was\nhealed, and in the thought that perforce she must answer with a final\n'No', she found at first more of solace than of distress.\n\nSubsidence of physical suffering allowed her to forget this emotion, in\nits nature unavowable. She could think of the news Godwin sent, could\ntorment herself with interpretations of Marcella Moxey's behaviour, and\nview in detail the circumstances which enabled Godwin to urge a formal\nsuit. Among her various thoughts there recurred frequently a regret\nthat this letter had not reached her, like the other two, unobserved.\nHer father had now learnt that she was in correspondence with the\ndisgraced man; to keep silence would be to cause him grave trouble; yet\nhow much better if fortune had only once more favoured her, so that the\nstory might have remained her secret, from beginning to end.\n\nFor was not this the end?----\n\nAt the usual time she went to the drawing-room, and somehow succeeded\nin conversing as though nothing had disturbed her. Mr Warricombe was\nnot seen till dinner. When he came forth, Sidwell noticed his air of\npreoccupation, and that he avoided addressing her. The evening asked\ntoo much of her self-command; she again withdrew, and only came back\nwhen the household was ready for retiring. In bidding her father\ngoodnight, she forced herself to meet his gaze; he looked at her with\ntroubled inquiry, and she felt her cheek redden.\n\n'Do you want to get rid of me?' asked Sylvia, with wonted frankness,\nwhen her friend drew near.\n\n'No. Let us go to the glass-house.'\n\nUp there on the roof Sidwell often found a retreat when her thoughts\nwere troublesome. Fitfully, she had resumed her water-colour drawing,\nbut as a rule her withdrawal to the glass-house was for reading or\nreverie. Carrying a small lamp, she led the way before Sylvia, and they\nsat down in the chairs which on one occasion had been occupied by\nBuckland Warricombe and Peak.\n\nThe wind, rarely silent in this part of Devon, blew boisterously from\nthe south-west. A far-off whistle, that of a train speeding up the\nvalley on its way from Plymouth, heightened the sense of retirement and\nquietude always to be enjoyed at night here under the stars.\n\n'Have you been thinking over my suggestion?' asked Sylvia, when there\nhad been silence awhile.\n\n'No,' was the murmured reply.\n\n'Something has happened, I think.'\n\n'Yes. I should like to tell you, Sylvia, but'----\n\n'But'----\n\n'I _must_ tell you! I can't keep it in my own mind, and you are the\nonly one'----\n\nSylvia was surprised at the agitation which suddenly revealed itself in\nher companion's look and voice. She became serious, her eyes\nbrightening with intellectual curiosity. Feminine expressions of\nsympathy were not to be expected from Miss Moorhouse; far more\nreassuring to Sidwell was the kind attentiveness with which her friend\nbent forward.\n\n'That letter father handed me to-day was from Mr. Peak.'\n\n'You hear from him?'\n\n'This is the third time--since he went away. At our last meeting'--her\nvoice dropped--'I pledged my faith to him.--Not absolutely. The future\nwas too uncertain'----\n\nThe gleam in Sylvia's eyes grew more vivid. She was profoundly\ninterested, and did not speak when Sidwell's voice failed.\n\n'You never suspected this?' asked the latter, in a few moments.\n\n'Not exactly that. What I did suspect was that Mr. Peak's departure\nresulted from--your rejection of him.'\n\n'There is more to be told,' pursued Sidwell, in tremulous accents. 'You\nmust know it all--because I need your help. No one here has learnt what\ntook place between us. Mr. Peak did not go away on that account.\nBut--you remember being puzzled to explain his orthodoxy in religion?'\n\nShe paused. Sylvia gave a nod, signifying much.\n\n'He never believed as he professed,' went on Sidwell, hurriedly. 'You\nwere justified in doubting him. He concealed the truth--pretended to\nchampion the old faiths'----\n\nFor an instant she broke off, then hastened through a description of\nthe circumstances which had brought about Peak's discovery. Sylvia\ncould not restrain a smile, but it was softened by the sincere\nkindliness of her feeling.\n\n'And it was after this,' she inquired impartially, 'that the decisive\nconversation between you took place?'\n\n'No; just before Buckland's announcement. We met again, after\nthat.--Does it seem incredible to you that I should have let the second\nmeeting end as it did?'\n\n'I think I understand. Yes, I know you well enough to follow it. I can\neven guess at the defence he was able to urge.'\n\n'You can?' asked Sidwell, eagerly. 'You see a possibility of his\ndefending himself?'\n\n'I should conjecture that it amounted to the old proverb, \"All's fair\nin love and war\". And, putting aside a few moral prejudices, one can\neasily enough absolve him.--The fact is, I had long ago surmised that\nhis motives in taking to such a career had more reference to this world\nthan the next. You know, I had several long talks with him; I told you\nhow he interested me. Now I can piece together my conclusions.'\n\n'Still,' urged Sidwell, 'you must inevitably regard him as ignoble--as\nguilty of base deceit. I must hide nothing from you, having told so\nmuch. Have you heard from anyone about his early life?'\n\n'Your mother told me some old stories.'\n\nSidwell made an impatient gesture. In words of force and ardour, such\nas never before had been at her command, she related all she knew of\nGodwin's history prior to his settling at Exeter, and depicted the\nmood, the impulses, which, by his own confession, had led to that\nstrange enterprise. Only by long exercise of an impassioned imagination\ncould she thus thoroughly have identified herself with a life so remote\nfrom her own. Peak's pleading for himself was scarcely more impressive.\nIn listening, Sylvia understood how completely Sidwell had cast off the\nbeliefs for which her ordinary conversation seemed still to betray a\ntenderness.\n\n'I know,' the speaker concluded, 'that he cannot in that first hour\nhave come to regard me with a feeling strong enough to determine what\nhe then undertook. It was not I as an individual, but all of us here,\nand the world we represented. Afterwards, he persuaded himself that he\nhad felt love for me from the beginning. And I, I tried to believe\nit--because I wished it true; for his sake, and for my own. However it\nwas, I could not harden my heart against him. A thousand considerations\nforbade me to allow him further hope; but I refused to listen--no, I\n_could_ not listen. I said I would remain true to him. He went away to\ntake up his old pursuits, and if possible to make a position for\nhimself. It was to be our secret. And in spite of everything. I hoped\nfor the future.'\n\nSilence followed, and Sidwell seemed to lose herself in distressful\nthought.\n\n'And now,' asked her friend, 'what has come to pass?'\n\n'Do you know that Miss Moxey is dead?'\n\n'I haven't heard of it.'\n\n'She is dead, and has left Mr. Peak a fortune.--His letter of today\ntells me this. And at the same time he claims my promise.'\n\nTheir eyes met. Sylvia still had the air of meditating a most\ninteresting problem. Impossible to decide from her countenance how she\nregarded Sidwell's position.\n\n'But why in the world,' she asked, 'should Marcella Moxey have left her\nmoney to Mr. Peak?'\n\n'They were friends,' was the quick reply. 'She knew all that had\nbefallen him, and wished to smooth his path.'\n\nSylvia put several more questions, and to all of them Sidwell replied\nwith a peculiar decision, as though bent on making it clear that there\nwas nothing remarkable in this fact of the bequest. The motive which\nimpelled her was obscure even to her own mind, for ever since receiving\nthe letter she had suffered harassing doubts where now she affected to\nhave none. 'She knew, then,' was Sylvia's last inquiry, 'of the\nrelations between you and Mr. Peak?'\n\n'I am not sure--but I think so. Yes, I think she must have known.'\n\n'From Mr. Peak himself, then?'\n\nSidwell was agitated.\n\n'Yes--I think so. But what does that matter?'\n\nThe other allowed her face to betray perplexity.\n\n'So much for the past,' she said at length. 'And now?'----\n\n'I have not the courage to do what I wish.'\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n'About your wish,' asked Sylvia at length, 'you are not at all\ndoubtful?'\n\n'Not for one moment.--Whether I err in my judgment of him could be\nproved only by time; but I know that if I were free, if I stood\nalone'----\n\nShe broke off and sighed. 'It would mean, I suppose,' said the other,\n'a rupture with your family?'\n\n'Father would not abandon me, but I should darken the close of his\nlife. Buckland would utterly cast me off; mother would wish to do\nso.--You see, I cannot think and act simply as a woman, as a human\nbeing. I am bound to a certain sphere of life. The fact that I have\noutgrown it, counts for nothing. I cannot free myself without injury to\npeople whom I love. To act as I wish would be to outrage every rule and\nprejudice of the society to which I belong. You yourself--you know how\nyou would regard me.'\n\nSylvia replied deliberately.\n\n'I am seeing you in a new light, Sidwell. It takes a little time to\nreconstruct my conception of you.'\n\n'You think worse of me than you did.'\n\n'Neither better nor worse, but differently. There has been too much\nreserve between us. After so long a friendship, I ought to have known\nyou more thoroughly. To tell the truth, I have thought now and then of\nyou and Mr. Peak; that was inevitable. But I went astray; it seemed to\nme the most unlikely thing that you should regard him with more than a\ndoubtful interest. I knew, of course, that he had made you his ideal,\nand I felt sorry for him.'\n\n'I seemed to you unworthy?'----\n\n'Too placid, too calmly prudent.--In plain words, Sidwell, I do think\nbetter of you.'\n\nSidwell smiled.\n\n'Only to know me henceforth as the woman who did not dare to act upon\nher best impulses.'\n\n'As for \"best\"--I can't say. I don't glorify passion, as you know; and\non the other hand I have little sympathy with the people who are always\ncrying out for self-sacrifice. I don't know whether it would be \"best\"\nto throw over your family, or to direct yourself solely with regard to\ntheir comfort.'\n\nSidwell broke in.\n\n'Yes, that is the true phrase--\"their comfort\". No higher word should\nbe used. That is the ideal of the life to which I have been brought up.\nComfort, respectability.--And has _he_ no right? If I sacrifice myself\nto father and mother, do I not sacrifice _him_ as well? He has\nforfeited all claim to consideration--that is what people say. With my\nwhole soul, I deny it! If he sinned against anyone, it was against me,\nand the sin ended as soon as I understood him. That episode in his life\nis blotted out; by what law must it condemn to imperfection the whole\nof his life and of my own? Yet because people will not, cannot, look at\na thing in a spirit of justice, I must wrong myself and him.'\n\n'Let us think of it more quietly,' said Sylvia, in her clear,\ndispassionate tones. 'You speak as though a decision must be taken at\nonce. Where is the necessity for that? Mr. Peak is now independent.\nSuppose a year or two be allowed to pass, may not things look\ndifferently?'\n\n'A year or two!' exclaimed Sidwell, with impatience. 'Nothing will be\nchanged. What I have to contend against is unchangeable. If I guide\nmyself by such a hope as that, the only reasonable thing would be for\nme to write to Mr. Peak, and ask him to wait until my father and mother\nare dead.'\n\n'Very well. On that point we are at rest, then. The step must be taken\nat once, or never.'\n\nThe wind roared, and for some minutes no other sound was audible. By\nthis [Updater's note: the word \"time\" missing?], all the inmates of the\nhouse save the two friends were in bed, and most likely sleeping.\n\n'You must think it strange,' said Sidwell, 'that I have chosen to tell\nyou all this, just when the confession is most humiliating to me. I\nwant to feel the humiliation, as one only can when another is witness\nof it. I wish to leave myself no excuse for the future.'\n\n'I'm not sure that I quite understand you. You have made up your mind\nto break with him?'\n\n'Because I am a coward.'\n\n'If my feeling in any matter were as strong as that, I should allow it\nto guide me.'\n\n'Because your will is stronger. You, Sylvia, would never (in my\nposition) have granted him that second interview. You would have known\nthat all was at an end, and have acted upon the knowledge. I knew it,\nbut yielded to temptation--at _his_ expense. I could not let him leave\nme, though that would have been kindest. I held him by a promise,\nbasely conscious that retreat was always open to me. And now I shall\nhave earned his contempt'----\n\nHer voice failed. Sylvia, affected by the outbreak of emotion in one\nwhom she had always known so strong in self-command, spoke with a\ndeeper earnestness.\n\n'Dear, do you wish me to help you against what you call your cowardice?\nI cannot take it upon me to encourage you until your own will has\nspoken. The decision must come from yourself. Choose what course you\nmay, I am still your friend. I have no idle prejudices, and no social\nbonds. You know how I wish you to come away with me; now I see only\nmore clearly how needful it is for you to breathe new air. Yes, you\nhave outgrown these conditions, just as your brothers have, just as\nFanny will--indeed has. Take to-night to think of it. If you can decide\nto travel with me for a year, be frank with Mr. Peak, and ask him to\nwait so long--till you have made up your mind. He cannot reasonably\nfind fault with you, for he knows all you have to consider. Won't this\nbe best?'\n\nSidwell was long silent.\n\n'I will go with you,' she said at last, in a low voice. 'I will ask him\nto grant me perfect liberty for a year.'\n\nWhen she came down next morning it was Sidwell's intention to seek a\nprivate interview with her father, and make known her resolve to go\nabroad with Sylvia; but Mr. Warricombe anticipated her.\n\n'Will you come to the library after breakfast, Sidwell?' he said, on\nmeeting her in the hall.\n\nShe interpreted his tone, and her heart misgave her. An hour later she\nobeyed the summons. Martin greeted her with a smile, but hardly tried\nto appear at ease.\n\n'I am obliged to speak to you,' were his first words. 'The letter you\nhad yesterday was from Mr. Peak?'\n\n'Yes, father.'\n\n'Is he'--Mr. Warricombe hesitated--'in these parts again?'\n\n'No; in Lancashire.'\n\n'Sidwell, I claim no right whatever to control your correspondence; but\nit was a shock to me to find that you are in communication with him.'\n\n'He wrote,' Sidwell replied with difficulty, 'to let me know of a\nchange that has come upon his prospects. By the death of a friend, he\nis made independent.'\n\n'For his own sake, I am glad to hear that. But how could it concern\n_you_, dear?'\n\nShe struggled to command herself.\n\n'It was at my invitation that he wrote, father.'\n\nMartin's face expressed grave concern.\n\n'Sidwell! Is this right?'\n\nShe was very pale, and kept her eyes unmovingly directed just aside\nfrom her father.\n\n'What can it mean?' Mr. Warricombe pursued, with sad remonstrance.\n'Will you not take me into your confidence, Sidwell?'\n\n'I can't speak of it,' she replied, with sudden determination. 'Least\nof all with you, father.'\n\n'Least of all?--I thought we were very near to each other.'\n\n'For that very reason, I can't speak to you of this. I must be left\nfree! I am going away with Sylvia, for a year, and for so long I _must_\nbe absolutely independent. Father, I entreat you not to'----\n\nA sob checked her. She turned away, and fought against the hysterical\ntendency; but it was too strong to be controlled. Her father\napproached, beseeching her to be more like herself. He held her in his\narms, until tears had their free course, and a measure of calmness\nreturned.\n\n'I can't speak to you about it,' she repeated, her face hidden from\nhim. 'I must write you a long letter, when I have gone. You shall know\neverything in that way.'\n\n'But, my dearest, I can't let you leave us under these circumstances.\nThis is a terrible trial to me. You cannot possibly go until we\nunderstand each other!'\n\n'Then I will write to you here--to-day or to-morrow.'\n\nWith this promise Martin was obliged to be contented, Sidwell left him,\nand was not seen, except by Sylvia, during the whole day.\n\nNor did she appear at breakfast on the morning that followed. But when\nthis meal was over, Sylvia received a message, summoning her to the\nretreat on the top of the house. Here Sidwell sat in the light and\nwarmth, a glass door wide open to the west, the rays of a brilliant sun\nsoftened by curtains which fluttered lightly in the breeze from the sea.\n\n'Will you read this?' she said, holding out a sheet of notepaper on\nwhich were a few lines in her own handwriting.\n\nIt was a letter, beginning--'I cannot.'\n\nSylvia perused it carefully, and stood in thought.\n\n'After all?' were the words with which she broke silence. They were\nneither reproachful nor regretful, but expressed grave interest.\n\n'In the night,' said Sidwell, 'I wrote to father, but I shall not give\nhim the letter. Before it was finished, I knew that I must write\n_this_. There's no more to be said, dear. You will go abroad without\nme--at all events for the present.'\n\n'If that is your resolve,' answered the other, quietly, 'I shall keep\nmy word, and only do what I can to aid it.' She sat down shielding her\neyes from the sunlight with a Japanese fan. 'After all, Sidwell,\nthere's much to be said for a purpose formed on such a morning as this;\none can't help distrusting the midnight.'\n\nSidwell was lying back in a low chair, her eyes turned to the woody\nhills on the far side of the Exe.\n\n'There's one thing I should like to say,' her friend pursued. 'It\nstruck me as curious that you were not at all affected, by what to me\nwould have been the one insuperable difficulty.'\n\n'I know what you mean--the legacy.'\n\n'Yes. It still seems to you of no significance?'\n\n'Of very little,' Sidwell answered wearily, letting her eyelids droop.\n\n'Then we won't talk about it. From the higher point of view, I believe\nyou are right; but--still let it rest.'\n\nIn the afternoon, Sidwell penned the following lines which she enclosed\nin an envelope and placed on the study table, when her father was\nabsent.\n\n'The long letter which I promised you, dear father, is needless. I have\nto-day sent Mr. Peak a reply which closes our correspondence. I am sure\nhe will not write again; if he were to do so, I should not answer.\n\n'I have given up my intention of going away with Sylvia. Later,\nperhaps, I shall wish to join her somewhere on the Continent, but by\nthat time you will be in no concern about me.'\n\nTo this Mr. Warricombe replied only with the joyous smile which greeted\nhis daughter at their next meeting. Mrs. Warricombe remained in\nignorance of the ominous shadow which had passed over her house. At\npresent, she was greatly interested in the coming marriage of the Rev.\nBruno Chilvers, whom she tried _not_ to forgive for having disappointed\nher secret hope.\n\nMartin had finally driven into the background those uneasy\nquestionings, which at one time it seemed likely that Godwin Peak would\nrather accentuate than silence. With Sidwell, he could never again\ntouch on such topics. If he were still conscious of a postponed debate,\nthe adjournment was _sine die_. Martin rested in the faith that,\nwithout effort of his own, the mysteries of life and time would ere\nlong be revealed to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nEarwaker spent Christmas with his relatives at Kingsmill. His father\nand mother both lived; the latter very infirm, unable to leave the\nhouse; the former a man of seventy, twisted with rheumatism, his face\nrugged as a countenance picked out by fancy on the trunk of a big old\noak, his hands scarred and deformed with labour. Their old age was\nrestful. The son who had made himself a 'gentleman', and who in London\nsat at the tables of the high-born, the wealthy, the famous, saw to it\nthat they lacked no comfort.\n\nA bright, dry morning invited the old man and the young to go forth\ntogether. They walked from the suburb countrywards, and their\nconversation was of the time when a struggle was being made to bear the\nexpense of those three years at Whitelaw--no bad investment, as it\nproved. The father spoke with a strong Midland accent, using words of\ndialect by no means disagreeable to the son's ear--for dialect is a\nvery different thing from the bestial jargon which on the lips of the\nLondon vulgar passes for English. They were laughing over some half\ngrim reminiscence, when Earwaker became aware of two people who were\napproaching along the pavement, they also in merry talk. One of them he\nknew; it was Christian Moxey.\n\nToo much interested in his companion to gaze about him, Christian came\nquite near before his eyes fell on Earwaker. Then he started with a\npleasant surprise, changed instantly to something like embarrassment\nwhen he observed the aged man. Earwaker was willing to smile and go by,\nhad the other consented; but a better impulse prevailed in both. They\nstopped and struck hands together.\n\n'My father,' said the man of letters, quite at his ease.\n\nChristian was equal to the occasion; he shook hands heartily with the\nbattered toiler, then turned to the lady at his side.\n\n'Janet, you guess who this is.--My cousin, Earwaker, Miss Janet Moxey.'\n\nDoubtless Janet was aware that her praises had suffered no diminution\nwhen sung by Christian to his friends. Her eyes just fell, but in a\nmoment were ready with their frank, intelligent smile. Earwaker\nexperienced a pang--ever so slight--suggesting a revision of his\nphilosophy.\n\nThey talked genially, and parted with good wishes for the New Year.\n\nTwo days later, on reaching home, Earwaker found in his letter-box a\nscrap of paper on which were scribbled a few barely legible lines.\n'Here I am!' he at length deciphered. 'Got into Tilbury at eleven this\nmorning. Where the devil are you? Write to Charing Cross Hotel.' No\nsignature, but none was needed. Malkin's return from New Zealand had\nbeen signalled in advance.\n\nThat evening the erratic gentleman burst in like a whirlwind. He was\nthe picture of health, though as far as ever from enduing the\ncomfortable flesh which accompanies robustness in men of calmer\ntemperament. After violent greetings, he sat down with abrupt gravity,\nand began to talk as if in continuance of a dialogue just interrupted.\n\n'Now, don't let us have any misunderstanding. You will please remember\nthat my journey to England is quite independent of what took place two\nyears and a half ago. It has _nothing whatever_ to do with those\ncircumstances.'\n\nEarwaker smiled.\n\n'I tell you,' pursued the other, hotly, 'that I am here to see\n_you_--and one or two other old friends; and to look after some\nbusiness matters. You will oblige me by giving credit to my assertion!'\n\n'Don't get angry. I am convinced of the truth of what you say.'\n\n'Very well! It's as likely as not that, on returning to Auckland, I\nshall marry Miss Maccabe--of whom I have written to you. I needn't\nrepeat the substance of my letters. I am not in love with her, you\nunderstand, and I needn't say that my intercourse with that family has\nbeen guided by extreme discretion. But she is a very sensible young\nlady. My only regret is that I didn't know her half-a-dozen years ago,\nso that I could have directed her education. She might have been even\nmore interesting than she is. But--you are at leisure, I hope,\nEarwaker?'\n\n'For an hour or two.'\n\n'Oh, confound it! When a friend comes back from the ends of the\nearth!--Yes, yes; I understand. You are a busy man; forgive my\nhastiness. Well now, I was going to say that I shall probably call upon\nMrs. Jacox.' He paused, and gave the listener a stern look, forbidding\nmisconstruction. 'Yes, I shall probably go down to Wrotham. I wish to\nput my relations with that family on a proper footing. Our\ncorrespondence has been very satisfactory, especially of late. The poor\nwoman laments more sincerely her--well, let us say, her folly of two\nyears and a half ago. She has outlived it; she regards me as a friend.\nBella and Lily seem to be getting on very well indeed. That governess\nof theirs--we won't have any more mystery; it was I who undertook the\ntrifling expense. A really excellent teacher, I have every reason to\nbelieve. I am told that Bella promises to be a remarkable pianist, and\nLily is uncommonly strong in languages. But my interest in them is\nmerely that of a friend; let it be understood.'\n\n'Precisely. You didn't say whether the girls have been writing to you?'\n\n'No, no, no! Not a line. I have exchanged letters only with their\nmother. Anything else would have been indiscreet. I shall be glad to\nsee them, but my old schemes are things of the past. There is not the\nfaintest probability that Bella has retained any recollection of me at\nall.'\n\n'I daresay not,' assented Earwaker.\n\n'You think so? Very well; I have acted wisely. Bella is still a child,\nyou know--compared with a man of my age. She is seventeen and a few\nmonths; quite a child! Miss Maccabe is just one-and-twenty; the proper\nage. When we are married, I think I shall bring her to Europe for a\nyear or two. Her education needs that; she will be delighted to see the\nold countries.'\n\n'Have you her portrait?'\n\n'Oh no! Things haven't got so far as that. What a hasty fellow you are,\nEarwaker! I told you distinctly'----\n\nHe talked till after midnight, and at leave-taking apologised profusely\nfor wasting his friend's valuable time.\n\nEarwaker awaited with some apprehension the result of Malkin's visit to\nWrotham. But the report of what took place on that occasion was\nsurprisingly commonplace. Weeks passed, and Malkin seldom showed\nhimself at Staple Inn; when he did so, his talk was exclusively of Miss\nMaccabe; all he could be got to say of the young ladies at Wrotham was,\n'Nice girls; very nice girls. I hope they'll marry well.' Two months\nhad gone by, and already the journalist had heard by letter of his\nfriend's intention to return to New Zealand, when, on coming home late\none night, he found Malkin sitting on the steps.\n\n'Earwaker, I have something very serious to tell you. Give me just a\nquarter of an hour.'\n\nWhat calamity did this tone portend? The eccentric man seated himself\nwith slow movement. Seen by a good light, his face was not gloomy, but\nvery grave.\n\n'Listen to me, old friend,' he began, sliding forward to the edge of\nhis chair. 'You remember I told you that my relations with the Maccabe\nfamily had been marked throughout with extreme discretion.'\n\n'You impressed that upon me.'\n\n'Good! I have never made love to Miss Maccabe, and I doubt whether she\nhas ever thought of me as a possible husband.'\n\n'Well?'\n\n'Don't be impatient. I want you to grasp the fact. It is important,\nbecause--I am going to marry Bella Jacox.'\n\n'You don't say so?'\n\n'Why not?' cried Malkin, suddenly passing to a state of excitement.\n'What objection can you make? I tell you that I am absolutely free to\nchoose'----\n\nThe journalist calmed him, and thereupon had to hear a glowing account\nof Bella's perfections. All the feeling that Malkin had suppressed\nduring these two months rushed forth in a flood of turbid eloquence.\n\n'And now,' he concluded, 'you will come down with me to Wrotham. I\ndon't mean to-night; let us say the day after tomorrow, Sunday. You\nremember our last joint visit! Ha, ha!'\n\n'Mrs. Jacox is reconciled?'\n\n'My dear fellow, she rejoices! A wonderful nobility in that poor little\nwoman! She wept upon my shoulder! But you must see Bella! I shan't take\nher to New Zealand, at all events not just yet. We shall travel about\nEurope, completing her education. Don't you approve of that?'\n\nOn Sunday, the two travelled down into Kent. This time they were\nreceived by Lily, now a pretty, pale, half-developed girl of fifteen.\nIn a few minutes her sister entered. Bella was charming; nervousness\nmade her words few, and it could be seen that she was naturally\nthoughtful, earnest, prone to reverie; her beauty had still to ripen,\nand gave much promise for the years between twenty and thirty. Last of\nall appeared Mrs. Jacox, who blushed as she shook hands with Earwaker,\nand for a time was ill at ease; but her vocatives were not long\nrestrained, and when all sat down to the tea-table she chattered away\nwith astonishing vivacity. After tea the company was joined by a lady\nof middle age, who, for about two years, had acted as governess to the\ngirls. Earwaker formed his conclusions as to the 'trifling expense'\nwhich her services represented; but it was probably a real interest in\nher pupils which had induced a person of so much refinement to bear so\nlong with the proximity of Mrs. Jacox.\n\n'A natural question occurs to me,' remarked Earwaker, as they were\nreturning. 'Who and what was Mr. Jacox?'\n\n'Ah! Bella was talking to me about him the other day. He must have been\ndistinctly an interesting man. Bella had a very clear recollection of\nhim, and she showed me two or three photographs. Engaged in some kind\nof commerce. I didn't seek particulars. But a remarkable man, one can't\ndoubt.'\n\nHe resumed presently.\n\n'Now don't suppose that this marriage entirely satisfies me. Bella has\nbeen fairly well taught, but not, you see, under my supervision. I\nought to have been able to watch and direct her month by month. As it\nis, I shall have to begin by assailing her views on all manner of\nthings. Religion, for example. Well, I have no religion, that's plain.\nI might call myself this or that for the sake of seeming respectable,\nbut it all comes to the same thing. I don't mind Bella going to church\nif she wishes, but I must teach her that there's no merit whatever in\ndoing so. It isn't an ideal marriage, but perhaps as good as this\nimperfect world allows. If I have children, I can then put my\neducational theories to the test.'\n\nBy way of novel experience, Earwaker, not long after this, converted\nhis study into a drawing-room, and invited the Jacox family to taste\nhis tea and cake. With Malkin's assistance, the risky enterprise was\nmade a great success. When Mrs. Jacox would allow her to be heard,\nBella talked intelligently, and showed eager interest in the details of\nliterary manufacture.\n\n'O Mr. Earwaker!' cried her mother, when it was time to go. 'What a\ndelightful afternoon you have given us! We must think of you from now\nas one of our very best friends. Mustn't we, Lily?'\n\nBut troubles were yet in store. Malkin was strongly opposed to a\nreligious marriage; he wished the wedding to be at a registrar's\noffice, and had obtained Bella's consent to this, but Mrs. Jacox would\nnot hear of such a thing. She wept and bewailed herself. 'How _can_ you\nthink of being married like a costermonger? O Mr. Malkin, you will\nbreak my heart, indeed you will!' And she wrote an ejaculatory letter\nto Earwaker, imploring his intercession. The journalist took his friend\nin hand.\n\n'My good fellow, don't make a fool of yourself. Women are born for one\nthing only, the Church of England marriage service. How can you seek to\ndefeat the end of their existence? Give in to the inevitable. Grin and\nbear it.'\n\n'I can't! I won't! It shall be a runaway match! I had rather suffer the\nrack than go through an ordinary wedding!'\n\nDire was the conflict. Down at Wrotham there were floods of tears. In\nthe end, Bella effected a compromise; the marriage was to be at a\nchurch, but in the greatest possible privacy. No carriages, no gala\ndresses, no invitations, no wedding feast; the bare indispensable\nformalities. And so it came to pass. Earwaker and the girl's governess\nwere the only strangers present, when, on a morning of June, Malkin and\nBella were declared by the Church to be henceforth one and indivisible.\nThe bride wore a graceful travelling costume; the bridegroom was in\ncorresponding attire.\n\n'Heaven be thanked, that's over!' exclaimed Malkin, as he issued from\nthe portal. 'Bella, we have twenty-three minutes to get to the railway\nstation. Don't cry!' he whispered to her. 'I can't stand that!'\n\n'No, no; don't be afraid,' she whispered back. 'We have said good-bye\nalready.'\n\n'Capital! That was very thoughtful of you.--Goodbye, all! Shall write\nfrom Paris, Earwaker. Nineteen minutes; we shall just manage it!'\n\nHe sprang into the cab, and away it clattered.\n\nA letter from Paris, a letter from Strasburg, from Berlin,\nMunich--letters about once a fortnight. From Bella also came an\noccasional note, a pretty contrast to the incoherent enthusiasm of her\nhusband's compositions. Midway in September she announced their\ndeparture from a retreat in Switzerland.\n\n'We are in the utmost excitement, for it is now decided that in three\ndays we start for Italy! The heat has been terrific, and we have waited\non what seems to me the threshold of Paradise until we could hope to\nenjoy the delights beyond. We go first to Milan. My husband, of course,\nknows Italy, but he shares my impatience. I am to entreat you to write\nto Milan, with as much news as possible. Especially have you heard\nanything more of Mr. Peak?'\n\nNovember the pair spent in Rome, and thence was despatched the\nfollowing in Malkin's hand:\n\n'This time I am _not_ mistaken! I have seen Peak. He didn't see me;\nperhaps wouldn't have known me. It was in Piale's reading-room. I had\nsat down to _The Times_, when a voice behind me sounded in such a\ncuriously reminding way that I couldn't help looking round. It was\nPeak; not a doubt of it. I might have been uncertain about his face,\nbut the voice brought back that conversation at your rooms too\nunmistakably--long ago as it was. He was talking to an American, whom\nevidently he had met somewhere else, and had now recognised. \"I've had\na fever,\" he said, \"and can't quite shake off the results. Been in\nIschia for the last month. I'm going north to Vienna.\" Then the two\nwalked away together. He looked ill, sallow, worn out. Let me know if\nyou hear.'\n\nOn that same day, Earwaker received another letter, with the Roman\npost-mark. It was from Peak.\n\n'I have had nothing particular to tell you. A month ago I thought I\nshould never write to you again; I got malarial fever, and lay\ndesperately ill at the _Ospedale Internazionale_ at Naples. It came of\nsome monstrous follies there's no need to speak of. A new and valuable\nexperience. I know what it is to look steadily into the eyes of Death.\n\n'Even now, I am far from well. This keeps me in low spirits. The other\nday I was half decided to start for London. I am miserably alone, want\nto see a friend. What a glorious place Staple Inn seemed to me as I lay\nin the hospital! Proof how low I had sunk: I thought longingly of\nExeter, of a certain house there--never mind!\n\n'I write hastily. An invitation from some musical people has decided me\nto strike for Vienna. Up there, I shall get my health back. The people\nare of no account--boarding-house acquaintances--but they may lead to\nbetter. I never in my life suffered so from loneliness.'\n\nThis was the eighteenth of November. On the twenty-eighth the postman\ndelivered a letter of an appearance which puzzled Earwaker. The stamp\nwas Austrian, the mark 'Wien'. From Peak, therefore. But the writing\nwas unknown, plainly that of a foreigner.\n\nThe envelope contained two sheets of paper. The one was covered with a\nlong communication in German; on the other stood a few words of\nEnglish, written, or rather scrawled, in a hand there was no\nrecognising:\n\n'Ill again, and alone. If I die, act for me. Write to Mrs. Peak,\nTwybridge.'\n\nBeneath was added, 'J. E. Earwaker, Staple Inn, London.'\n\nHe turned hurriedly to the foreign writing. Earwaker read a German book\nas easily as an English, but German manuscript was a terror to him. And\nthe present correspondent wrote so execrably that beyond _Geehrter\nHerr_, scarcely a word yielded sense to his anxious eyes. Ha! One he\nhad made out--_gestorben_.\n\nCrumpling the papers into his pocket, he hastened out, and knocked at\nthe door of an acquaintance in another part of the Inn. This was a man\nwho had probably more skill in German cursive. Between them, they\nextracted the essence of the letter.\n\nHe who wrote was the landlord of an hotel in Vienna. He reported that\nan English gentleman, named Peak, just arrived from Italy, had taken a\nbedroom at that house. In the night, the stranger became very ill, sent\nfor a doctor, and wrote the lines enclosed, the purport whereof he at\nthe same time explained to his attendants. On the second day Mr. Peak\ndied. Among his effects were found circular notes, and a sum of loose\nmoney. The body was about to be interred. Probably Mr. Earwaker would\nreceive official communications, as the British consul had been\ninformed of the matter. To whom should _bills_ be sent?\n\nThe man of letters walked slowly back to his own abode.\n\n'Dead, too, in exile!' was his thought. 'Poor old fellow!'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Born in Exile, by George Gissing\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BORN IN EXILE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4526.txt or 4526.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/5\/2\/4526\/\n\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":314,"split":"train"}
