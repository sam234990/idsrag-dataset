{"ori_id":"9e1475e4ee95eb7b4dca656e5afde2aaf5fdda8a","title":"Moonrise Kingdom","context":"Moonrise Kingdom\n In September 1965, on the fictional New England island called New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scoutmaster Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and have been pen pals since then. Their relationship having become romantic over the course of their correspondence, they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings her binoculars, six books, her kitten, and her brother's battery-powered record player. They hike, camp and fish together in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island. They are confronted by a group of Khaki Scouts who try to capture them, and during the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader, Redford, with her scissors and Camp Ivanhoe's dog is killed by a stray shot from a bow and arrow wielded by one of the Scouts. The Scouts flee and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They set up camp and go swimming. Later, while drying off, they begin dancing to Fran\u0102\u00a7oise Hardy in their underwear. As the romantic tension between them grows, they kiss repeatedly.\nSuzy's parents, Scoutmaster Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp find Sam and Suzy in their tent at the cove. Suzy's parents take her home and when Sharp contacts the foster parents he is told that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of \"Social Services\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an otherwise nameless woman with plans to place Sam in a \"juvenile refuge\" and to explore the possibility of treating him with electroshock therapy.\nThe Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help the couple. Together, they paddle to a fictional neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp located on St. Jack Wood Island and run by Commander Pierce, who is Ward's boss and views Ward as incompetent. Ben decides that the best available option is to try to get Sam and Suzy aboard a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services, but before leaving he performs a \"wedding\" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and instead are pursued by Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scoutmaster Ward, who displays great leadership after Commander Pierce is incapacitated.\nA violent hurricane and flash flood strike only three days after Sam and Suzy first ran away from home and, after many twists and turns, Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. The steeple is destroyed by lightning, but everyone survives. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, thus saving Sam from the orphanage, as well as allowing him to remain on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.\nAt Summer's End, Sam is painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner. On slipping out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, Sam tells Suzy that he will see her the following day.\n<html>\n<head><title>Moonrise Kingdom Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Moonrise Kingdom script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Moonrise Kingdom script, Moonrise Kingdom movie script, Moonrise Kingdom film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY\n<\/b>                         \n          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is\n          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide\n          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and\n          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at\n          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are\n          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.\n                         \n          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling\n          the gutters.\n                         \n          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully\n          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel\n          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He\n          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the\n          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.\n                         \n          A child's voice says over the speaker:\n                         \n<b>           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)\n<\/b>           In order to show you how a big symphony\n           orchestra is put together, Benjamin\n           Britten has written a big piece of music,\n           which is made up of smaller pieces that\n           show you all the separate parts of the\n           orchestra.\n                         \n          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their\n          bedrooms and down to the landing.\n                         \n          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is\n          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer\n          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a\n          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high\n          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is\n          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.\n                         \n          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They\n          lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their\n          fists, listening.\n                         \n          Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly\n          and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the\n          cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her\n          neck.\n                         \n          Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She\n          raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out\n          into the rain.\n<b>           2.\n<\/b>                         \n                         \n<b>          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE.

A weather vane swings\n          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The\n          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland\n          is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,\n          watching.\n                         \n<b>                         TITLES OVER:\n<\/b>                         \n          The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.\n                         \n          In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They\n          shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat\n          grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.\n                         \n          In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a\n          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed\n          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.\n          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly\n          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,\n          topless, in the kitchen sink.\n                         \n          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet\n          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker\n          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.\n          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.\n                         \n          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.\n                         \n<b>                         CUT TO:\n<\/b>                         \n          The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula\n          curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.\n          A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the\n          sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a\n          tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the\n          narrator.

Forested with old-\n           growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by\n           shallow tidal creeks. An important\n           seabird habitat. There are no paved roads\n           but instead many miles of intersecting\n           foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry\n           that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.\n           The year is 1965. We are on the far edge\n           of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the\n           ferocious and well-documented storm which\n           will strike from the east on the fifth of\n           September -- in three day's time.\n<b>           3.\n<\/b>                         \n                         \n<b>          EXT.

It\n          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow\n          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch\n          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.\n                         \n          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges\n          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.\n          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown\n          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin\n          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.\n          He is Gadge.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Morning, Gadge.\n                         \n<b>                          GADGE\n<\/b>           Morning, sir.\n                         \n          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout\n          Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and\n          rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an\n          army-shovel. He is Deluca.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Deluca. Latrine inspection.\n                         \n          Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down\n          a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and\n          a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Good.\n                         \n          Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops\n          in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a\n          stump twisting something in his fingers.

He looks\n          perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a\n          secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master\n          Ward strides away.\n                         \n          An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the\n          tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,\n          and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.\n                         \n          Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs\n          stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and\n          a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms.

Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small\n          platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two\n          scouts are sawing something in half on it.

Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward\n          strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with\n          tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be\n          contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Nickleby.

He stops in front of a work-bench covered with\n          newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel\n          into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a\n          metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of\n          the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his\n          cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           How many rockets you up to, Panagle?\n                         \n<b>                          PANAGLE\n<\/b>           Sixteen and a half.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b><b>                          (TO GADGE)\n<\/b>           That enough for the Jubilee?\n                         \n          Gadge shakes his head.

He coughs and waves\n          his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the\n          rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair.\n          He is Redford.

Scout Master Ward\n          arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a\n          magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover\n          of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.\n                         \n<b>                         INSERT:\n<\/b>                         \n          The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master-\n          in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on\n          horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature\n          below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large\n          text: \"An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg.\"\n                         \n          As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him\n          one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They\n          unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding\n          utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the\n          table. The scouts serve themselves noisily.\n                         \n          Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal\n          cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Who's missing?\n                         \n          Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names,\n          scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp:\n                         \n<b>           SCOUT MASTER WARD\n<\/b>           Shakusky! Breakfast!\n                         \n          Silence.

Silence.\n                         \n          Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his\n          cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a\n          strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and\n          walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed\n<b>           7.\n<\/b>                         \n                         \n          at the front.

He produces a wooden-\n          handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and\n          gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the\n          end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap\n          at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up\n          briskly, unzipping the tent.\n                         \n<b>          INT.

There is a foot\n          locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,\n          and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent\n          over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot\n          locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks\n          up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from\n          under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns\n          suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides\n          it aside.\n                         \n          There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a\n          basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner.

A large\n          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the\n          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir\n          loft at the back and in nooks and corners.

No one pays attention to him. He\n          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a\n          bowl and sucks on it.

Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied\n          to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks\n          with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash.

Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend\n          from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red\n          and yellow jerseys over their uniforms.\n                         \n          Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond\n          the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his\n          hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field.\n          There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the\n          ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he\n          runs past. He looks back and sees:\n<b>           84.\n<\/b>                         \n                         \n          A mob of fifty scouts chasing him.

A dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow\n          over the entire camp. Sam throws the little flag down at his\n          pursuers like a javelin. It sails in an arc and pokes down\n          into the grass. There is a thunderclap. Sam looks up into the\n          sky.\n                         \n          A bolt of lightning strikes him.\n                         \n          Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back.\n          The tennis ball can explodes nickels. The mob of scouts stops\n          with a jolt. They look terrified. Sam sits up. He is covered\n          in black soot. His shoes are on fire. He shakes them off his\n          feet.\n                         \n          Suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her\n          knees in front of Sam. She looks astonished.

Mr. Bishop looks to Mrs. Bishop.\n          They are both terrified and helpless.
