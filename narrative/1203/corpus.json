William Ashe is a rich, handsome, and successful politician, and heir to the title of Earl of Tranmore. Ashe falls for Lady Kitty Bristol, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Madam d'Estrees, whose charm draws many influential men and overcomes any questions about her reputation. Ashe proposes to her just three weeks after they meet, and she accepts though she warns him that her temper and uncontrollable nature may cause him to regret asking.\nThree years later, the couple are settled in London, with Kitty heavily involved in the London social scene. They have one son, who is physically disabled. Kitty's social activities start to affect Ashe's political career; she strains Ashe's relationship with Lord Parham, the prime minister, and also flirts with the dashing but unprincipled Geoffrey Cliffe. After their child dies, Kitty is left a physical wreck and goes with Ashe to Italy to try to recover her health. Kitty meets Cliffe in Italy and runs off with him, while Ashe is in England trying to suppress a salacious book Kitty has written. Two years later, Ashe comes upon Kitty unexpectedly at a small inn in the Alps. Kitty has had many hardships, but dies in the comfort of Ashe's presence.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Marriage of William Ashe, by Mrs. Humphry Ward\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It was a fine piece of church\nembroidery, which, seeing that it had been designed for her by no less a\nperson than young Mr. Burne Jones himself, made her the envy of her\npre-Raphaelite friends.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. You made out there was a train about twelve.\"\n\n\"Certainly. They can't have taken more than an hour to speechify after\nthe declaration of the poll. And I know William meant to catch that\ntrain if he possibly could.\"\n\n\"And take his seat this evening?\"\n\nLady Tranmore nodded. She moved restlessly about the room, fidgeting\nwith a book here and there, and evidently full of thoughts. Mary Lyster\nwatched her a little longer, then quietly took up her work again. Her\nair of well-bred sympathy, the measured ease of her movements,\ncontrasted with Lady Tranmore's impatience. Yet in truth she was\nlistening no less sharply than her companion to the sounds in the\nstreet outside.\n\nLady Tranmore made her way to the window, and stood there looking out on\nthe park. It was the week before Easter, and the plane-trees were not\nyet in leaf. But a few thorns inside the park railings were already\nlavishly green and there was a glitter of spring flowers beside the park\nwalks, not showing, however, in such glorious abundance as became the\nfashion a few years later. It was a mild afternoon and the drive was\nfull of carriages. From the bow-window of the old irregular house in\nwhich she stood, Lady Tranmore could watch the throng passing and\nrepassing, could see also the traffic in Park Lane on either side.\nLondon, from this point of sight, wore a cheerful, friendly air. The dim\nsunshine, the white-clouded sky, the touches of reviving green and\nflowers, the soft air blowing in from a farther window which was open,\nbrought with them impressions of spring, of promise, and rebirth, which\ninsensibly affected Lady Tranmore.\n\n\"Well, I wonder what William will do, this time, in Parliament!\" she\nsaid, as she dropped again into her seat by the fire and began to cut\nthe pages of a new book.\n\n\"He is sure to do extremely well,\" said Miss Lyster.\n\nLady Tranmore shrugged her shoulders. \"My dear--do you know that William\nhas been for eight years--since he left Trinity--one of the idlest young\nmen alive?\"\n\n\"He had one brief!\"\n\n\"Yes--somewhere in the country, where all the juniors get one in turn,\"\nsaid Lady Tranmore. \"That was the year he was so keen and went on\ncircuit, and never missed a sessions. Next year nothing would induce\nhim to stir out of town. What has he done with himself all these eight\nyears? I can't imagine.\"\n\n\"He has grown--uncommonly handsome,\" said Mary Lyster, with a momentary\nhesitation as she threaded her needle afresh.\n\n\"I never remember him anything else,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"All the\nartists who came here and to Narroways wanted to paint him. I used to\nthink it would make him a spoiled little ape. But nothing spoiled him.\"\n\nMiss Lyster smiled. \"You know, Cousin Elizabeth--and you may as well\nconfess it at once!--that you think him the ablest, handsomest, and\ncharmingest of men!\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said Lady Tranmore, calmly. \"I am certain,\nmoreover--now--that he will be Prime Minister. And as for idleness,\nthat, of course, is only a _fa\u00c3\u00a7on de parler_. He has worked hard enough\nat the things which please him.\"\n\n\"There--you see!\" said Mary Lyster, laughing.\n\n\"Not politics, anyway,\" said the elder lady, reflectively. \"He went\ninto the House to please me, because I was a fool and wanted to see\nhim there. But I must say when his constituents turned him out last\nyear I thought they would have been a mean-spirited set if they\nhadn't. They knew very well he'd never done a stroke for them.\nAttendances--divisions--perfectly scandalous!\"\n\n\"Well, here he is, in triumphantly for somewhere else--with all sorts of\ndelightful prospects!\"\n\nLady Tranmore sighed. Her white fingers paused in their task.\n\n\"That, of course, is because--now--he's a personage. Everything'll be\nmade easy for him now. My dear Mary, they talk of England's being a\ndemocracy!\"\n\nThe speaker raised her handsome shoulders; then, as though to shake off\nthoughts of loss and grief which had suddenly assailed her, she abruptly\nchanged the subject.\n\n\"Well--work or no work--the first thing we've got to do is to marry\nhim.\"\n\nShe looked up sharply. But not the smallest tremor could she detect in\nMary Lyster's gently moving hand. There was, however, no reply to her\nremark.\n\n\"Don't you agree, Polly?\" said Lady Tranmore, smiling.\n\nHer smile--which still gave great beauty to her face--was charming, but\na little sly, as she observed her companion.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said Miss Lyster, inclining her head to one side that\nshe might judge the effect of some green shades she had just put in.\n\"But that surely will be made easy for him, too.\"\n\n\"Well, after all, the girls can't propose! And I never saw him take any\ninterest in a girl yet--outside his own family, of course,\" added Lady\nTranmore, hastily.\n\n\"No--he does certainly devote himself to the married women,\" replied\nMiss Lyster, in the half-absent tone of one more truly interested in her\nembroidery than in the conversation.\n\n\"He would sooner have an hour with Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es than a week with the\nprettiest miss in London. That's quite true, but I vow it's the girls'\nown fault! They should stand on their dignity--snub the creatures\nmore! In my young days--\"\n\n[Illustration: LADY TRANMORE AND MARY LYSTER]\n\n\"Ah, there wasn't a glut of us then,\" said Mary, calmly. \"Listen!\"--she\nheld up her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Tranmore, springing up. \"There he is.\"\n\nShe stood waiting. The door flew open, and in came a tall young man.\n\n\"William, how late you are!\" said Lady Tranmore, as she flew into his\narms.\n\n\"Well, mother, are you pleased?\"\n\nHer son held her at arm's-length, smiling kindly upon her.\n\n\"Of course I am,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"And you--are you horribly tired?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Ah, Mary!--how do you do?\"\n\nMiss Lyster had risen, and the cousins shook hands.\n\n\"But I don't deny it's very jolly to come back--out of all that beastly\nscrimmage,\" said the new member, as he threw himself into an arm-chair\nby the fire with his hands behind his head, while Lady Tranmore prepared\nhim a cup of tea.\n\n\"I expect you've enjoyed it,\" said Miss Lyster, also moving towards the\nfire.\n\n\"Well, when you're in it there's a certain excitement in wondering how\nyou're going to come out of it! But one might say that, of course, of\nthe infernal regions.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Mary Lyster, smiling demurely.\n\n\"Polly! you _are_ a Tory. Everybody else's hell has moved--but yours!\nThank you, mother,\" as Lady Tranmore gave him tea. Then, stretching out\nhis great frame in lazy satisfaction, he turned his brown eyes from one\nlady to the other. \"I say, mother, I haven't seen anything as\ngood-looking as you--or Polly there, if she'll forgive me--for weeks.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, goose,\" said his mother, as she replenished the\nteapot. \"What--there were no pretty girls--not one?\"\n\n\"Well, they didn't come my way,\" said William, contentedly munching at\nbread-and-butter. \"I have gone through all the usual humbug--and\nperjured my soul in all the usual ways--without any consolation worth\nspeaking of.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, sir,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"You know you like\nspeaking--and you like compliments--and you've had plenty of both.\"\n\n\"You didn't read me, mother!\"\n\n\"Didn't I?\" she said, smiling. He groaned, and took another piece of\ntea-cake.\n\n\"My own family at least, don't you think, might omit that?\"\n\n\"H'm, sir--So you didn't believe a word of your own speeches?\" said Lady\nTranmore, as she stood behind him and smoothed his hair back from his\nforehead.\n\n\"Well, who does?\" He looked up gayly and kissed the tips of her fingers.\n\n\"And it's in that spirit you're going back into the House?\" Mary Lyster\nthrew him the question--with a slight pinching of the lips--as she\nresumed her work.\n\n\"Spirit? What do you mean, Polly? One plays the game, of course--and it\nhas its moments--its hot corners, so to speak--or I suppose no one would\nplay it!\"\n\n\"And the goal?\" She lifted a gently disapproving face, in a movement\nwhich showed anew the large comeliness of head and neck.\n\n\"Why--to keep the other fellows out, of course!\" He lifted an arm and\ndrew his mother down to sit on the edge of his chair.\n\n\"William, you're not to talk like that,\" said Lady Tranmore, decidedly,\nlaying her cheek, however, against his hand the while. \"It was all very\nwell when you were quite a free-lance--but now--Oh! never mind\nMary--she's discreet--and she knows all about it.\"\n\n\"What--that they're thinking of giving me Hickson's place? Parham has\njust written to me--I found the letter down-stairs--to ask me to go and\nsee him.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's come?\" said Lady Tranmore, with a start of pleasure. Lord\nParham was the Prime Minister. \"Now don't be a humbug, William, and\npretend you're not pleased. But you'll have to work, mind!\" She held up\nan admonishing finger. \"You'll have to answer letters, mind!--you'll\nhave to keep appointments, mind!\"\n\n\"Shall I?... Ah!--Hudson--\"\n\nHe turned. The butler was in the room.\n\n\"His lordship, my lady, would like to see Mr. William before dinner if\nhe could make it convenient.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Hudson, certainly,\" said the young man. \"Tell his lordship\nI'll be with him in ten minutes.\"\n\nThen, as the butler departed--\"How's father, mother?\"\n\n\"Oh! much as usual,\" said Lady Tranmore, sadly.\n\n\"And you?\"\n\nHe laid his arm boyishly round her waist, and looked up at her, his\nhandsome face all affection and life. Mary Lyster, observing them,\nthought them a remarkable pair--he in the very prime and heyday of\nbrilliant youth, she so beautiful still, in spite of the filling-out of\nmiddle life--which, indeed, was at the moment somewhat toned and\ndisguised by the deep mourning, the sweeping crape and dull silk in\nwhich she was dressed.\n\n\"I'm all right, dear,\" she said, quietly, putting her hand on his\nshoulder. \"Now, go on with your tea. Mary--feed him! I'll go and talk to\nfather till you come.\"\n\nShe disappeared, and William Ashe approached his cousin.\n\n\"She _is_ better?\" he said, with an anxiety that became him.\n\n\"Oh yes! Your election has been everything to her--and your letters. You\nknow how she adores you, William.\"\n\nAshe drew a long breath.\n\n\"Yes--isn't it bad luck?\"\n\n\"William!\"\n\n\"For her, I mean. Because, you know--I can't live up to it. I know it's\nher doing--bless her!--that old Parham's going to give me this thing.\nAnd it's a perfect scandal!\"\n\n\"What nonsense, William!\"\n\n\"It is!\" he maintained, springing up and standing before her, with his\nhands in his pockets. \"They're going to offer me the Under-Secretaryship\nfor Foreign Affairs, and I shall take it, I suppose, and be thankful.\nAnd do you know\"--he dropped out the words with emphasis--\"that I don't\nknow a word of German--and I can't talk to a Frenchman for half an hour\nwithout disgracing myself. There--that's how we're governed!\"\n\nHe stood staring at her with his bright large eyes--amused, yet\nstrangely detached--as though he had very little to do with what he was\ntalking about.\n\nMary Lyster met his look in some bewilderment, conscious all the time\nthat his neighborhood was very agreeable and stirring.\n\n\"But every one says--you speak so well on foreign subjects.\"\n\n\"Well, any fool can get up a Blue Book. Only--luckily for me--all the\nfools don't. That's how I've scored sometimes. Oh! I don't deny\nthat--I've scored!\" He thrust his hands deeper into his pockets, his\nwhole tall frame vibrant, as it seemed to her, with will and good-humor.\n\n\"And you'll score again,\" she said, smiling. \"You've got a wonderful\nopportunity, William. That's what the Bishop says.\"\n\n\"Much obliged to him!\"\n\nAshe looked down upon her rather oddly.\n\n\"He told me he had never believed you were such an idler as other people\nthought you--that he felt sure you had great endowments, and that you\nwould use them for the good of your country, and\"--she hesitated\nslightly--\"of the Church. I wish you'd talk to him sometimes, William.\nHe sees so clearly.\"\n\n\"Oh! does he?\" said Ashe.\n\nMary had dropped her work, and her face--a little too broad, with\nfeatures a trifle too strongly marked--was raised towards him. Its pale\ncolor had passed into a slight blush. But the more strenuous expression\nhad somehow not added to her charm, and her voice had taken a slightly\nnasal tone.\n\nThrough the mind of William Ashe, as he stood looking down upon her,\npassed a multitude of flying impressions. He knew perfectly well that\nMary Lyster was one of the maidens whom it would be possible for him to\nmarry. His mother had never pressed her upon him, but she would\ncertainly acquiesce. It would have been mere mock modesty on his part\nnot to guess that Mary would probably not refuse him. And she was\nhandsome, well provided, well connected--oppressively so, indeed; a man\nmight quail a little before her relations. Moreover, she and he had\nalways been good friends, even when as a boy he could not refrain from\nteasing her for a slow-coach. During his electoral weeks in the country\nthe thought of \"Polly\" had often stolen kindly upon his rare moments of\npeace. He must marry, of course. There was no particular excitement or\nromance about it. Now that his elder brother was dead and he had become\nthe heir, it simply had to be done. And Polly was very nice--quite\nsweet-tempered and intelligent. She looked well, moved well, would fill\nthe position admirably.\n\nThen, suddenly, as these half-thoughts rushed through his brain, a\nbreath of something cold and distracting--a wind from the land of\n_ennui_--seemed to blow upon them and scatter them. Was it the mention\nof the Bishop--tiresome, pompous fellow--or her slightly pedantic\ntone--or the infinitesimal hint of \"management\" that her speech implied?\nWho knows? But in that moment perhaps the scales of life inclined.\n\n\"Much obliged to the Bishop,\" he repeated, walking up and down. \"I am\nafraid, however, I don't take things as seriously as he does. Oh, I hope\nI shall behave decently--but, good Lord, what a comedy it is! You know\nthe sort of articles\"--he turned towards her--\"our papers will be\nwriting to-morrow on my appointment. They'll make me out no end of a\nfine fellow--you'll see! And, of course, the real truth is, as you and I\nknow perfectly well, that if it hadn't been for poor Freddy's death--and\nmother--and her dinners--and the chaps who come here--I might have\nwhistled for anything of the sort. And then I go down to Ledmenham and\nstand as a Liberal, and get all the pious Radicals to work for me! It's\na humbugging world--isn't it?\"\n\nHe returned to the fireplace, and stood looking down upon her--grinning.\n\nMary had resumed her embroidery. She, too, was dimly conscious of\nsomething disappointing.\n\n\"Of course, if you choose to take it like that, you can,\" she said,\nrather tartly. \"Of course, everything can be made ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a blessing, anyway!\" said Ashe, with his merry laugh. \"But\nlook here, Mary, tell me about yourself. What have you been\ndoing?--dancing--riding, eh?\"\n\nHe threw himself down beside her, and began an elder-brotherly\ncross-examination, which lasted till Lady Tranmore returned and begged\nhim to go at once to his father.\n\nWhen he returned to the drawing-room, Ashe found his mother alone. It\nwas growing dark, and she was sitting idle, her hands in her lap,\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"I must be off, dear,\" he said to her. \"You won't come down and see me\ntake my seat?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I think not. What did you think of your father?\"\n\n\"I don't see much change,\" he said, hesitating.\n\n\"No, he's much the same.\"\n\n\"And you?\" He slid down on the sofa beside her and threw his arm round\nher. \"Have you been fretting?\"\n\nLady Tranmore made no reply. She was a self-contained woman, not readily\nmoved to tears. But he felt her hand tremble as he pressed it.\n\n\"I sha'n't fret now\"--she said after a moment--\"now that you've come\nback.\"\n\nAshe's face took a very soft and tender expression.\n\n\"Mother, you know--you think a great deal too much of me--you're too\nambitious for me.\"\n\nShe gave a sound between a laugh and a sob, and, raising her hands, she\nsmoothed back his curly hair and held his face between them.\n\n\"When do you see Lord Parham?\" she asked.\n\n\"Eight o'clock--in his room at the House. I'll send you up a note.\"\n\n\"You'll be home early?\"\n\n\"No--don't wait for me.\"\n\nShe dropped her hands, after giving him a kiss on the cheek.\n\n\"I know where you're going! It's Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' evening.\"\n\n\"Well--you don't object?\"\n\n\"Object?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"So long as it amuses you--You\nwon't find _one_ woman there to-night.\"\n\n\"Last time there were two,\" he said, smiling, as he rose from the sofa.\n\n\"I know--Lady Quantock--and Mrs. Mallory. Now they've deserted her, I\nhear. What fresh gossip has turned up I don't know. Of course,\" she\nsighed, \"I've been out of the world. But I believe there have been\ndevelopments.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know anything about it--and I don't think I want to know.\nShe's very agreeable, and one meets everybody there.\"\n\n\"_Everybody_. Ungallant creature!\" she said, giving a little pull to his\ncollar, the set of which did not please her.\n\n\"Sorry! Mother!\"--his laughing eyes pursued her--\"Do you want to marry\nme off directly?--I know you do!\"\n\n\"I want nothing but what you yourself should want. Of course, you must\nmarry.\"\n\n\"The young women don't care twopence about me!\"\n\n\"William!--be a bear if you like, but not an idiot!\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" he declared; \"not the dazzlers and the high-fliers,\nanyway--the only ones it would be an excitement to carry off.\"\n\n\"You know very well,\" she said, slowly, \"that now you might marry\nanybody.\"\n\nHe threw his head back rather haughtily.\n\n\"Oh! I wasn't thinking about money, and that kind of thing. Well, give\nme time, mother--don't hurry me! And now I'd better stop talking\nnonsense, change my clothes, and be off. Good-bye, dear--you shall hear\nwhen the job's perpetrated!\"\n\n\"William, really!--don't say these things--at least to anybody but me.\nYou understand very well\"--she drew herself up rather finely--\"that if I\nhadn't known, in spite of your apparent idleness, you would do any work\nthey _set_ you to do, to your own credit and the country's, I'd never\nhave lifted a finger for you!\"\n\nWilliam Ashe laughed out.\n\n\"Oh! intriguing mother!\" he said, stooping again to kiss her. \"So you\nadmit you did it?\"\n\nHe went off gayly, and she heard him flying up-stairs three steps at a\ntime, as though he were still an untamed Eton boy, and there were no\nthree weeks' hard political fighting behind him, and no interview which\nmight decide his life before him.\n\nHe entered his own sitting-room on the second floor, shut the door\nbehind him, and glanced round him with delight. It was a large room\nlooking on a side street, and obliquely to the park. Its walls were\ncovered with books--books which almost at first sight betrayed to the\naccustomed eye that they were the familiar companions of a student.\nAlmost every volume had long paper slips inside it, and when opened\nwould have been found to contain notes and underlinings in a somewhat\nreckless and destructive abundance. A large table, also loaded untidily\nwith books and papers, stood in the centre of the room; many of them\nwere note-books, stored with evidences of the most laborious and patient\nwork; a Cambridge text lay beside them face downward, as he had left it\non departure. His mother's housekeeper, who had been one of his best\nfriends from babyhood, was the only person allowed to dust his room--but\non the strict condition that she replaced everything as she found it.\n\nHe took up the volume, and plunged a moment headlong into the Greek\nchorus that met his eye. \"_Jolly!_\" he said, putting it down with a sigh\nof regret. \"These beastly politics!\"\n\nAnd he went muttering to his dressing-room, summoning his valet almost\nwith ill-temper. Yet half his library was the library of a politician,\nadmirably chosen and exhaustively read.\n\nThe footman who answered his call understood his moods and served him at\na look. Ashe complained hotly of the brushing of his dress-clothes, and\nworked himself into a fever over the set of his tie. Nevertheless,\nbefore he left he had managed to get from the young man the whole story\nof his engagement to the under-housemaid, giving him thereupon some bits\nof advice, jocular but trenchant, which James accepted with a readiness\nquite unlike his normal behavior in the circles of his class.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nAshe took his seat, dined, and saw the Prime Minister. These things took\ntime, and it was not till past eleven that he presented himself in the\nhall of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' house in St. James's Place. Most of her guests\nwere already gathered, but he mounted the stairs together with an old\nfriend and an old acquaintance, Philip Darrell, one of the ablest\nwriters of the moment, and Louis Harman, artist and man of fashion, the\nfriend of duchesses and painter of portraits, a person much in request\nin many worlds.\n\n\"What a _cachet_ they have, these houses!\" said Harman, looking round\nhim. \"St. James's Place is the top!\"\n\n\"Where else would you expect to find Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es?\" asked Darrell,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Yes--what taste she has! However, it was I really who advised her to\ntake the house.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Darrell.\n\nHarman threw a dubious look at him, then stopped a moment, and with a\ncomplacent proprietary air straightened an engraving on the staircase\nwall.\n\n\"I suppose the dear lady has a hundred slaves of the lamp, as usual,\"\nsaid Ashe. \"You advise her about her house--somebody else helps her to\nbuy her wine--\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear fellow,\" said Harman, offended--\"as if I couldn't\ndo that!\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Darrell, as they neared the drawing-room door. \"What a\ncrowd there is!\"\n\nFor as the butler announced them, the din of talk which burst through\nthe door implied indeed a multitude--much at their ease.\n\nThey made their way in with difficulty, shaping their course towards\nthat corner in the room where they knew they should find their hostess.\nAshe was greeted on all sides with friendly words and congratulations,\nand a passage was opened for him to the famous \"blue sofa\" where Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es sat enthroned.\n\nShe looked up with animation, broke off her talk with two elderly\ndiplomats who seemed to have taken possession of her, and beckoned Ashe\nto a seat beside her.\n\n\"So you're in? Was it a hard fight?\"\n\n\"A hard fight? Oh no! One would have had to be a great fool not to get\nin.\"\n\n\"They say you spoke very well. I suppose you promised them everything\nthey wanted--from the crown downward?\"\n\n\"Yes--all the usual harmless things,\" said Ashe.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es laughed; then looked at him across the top of her fan.\n\n\"Well!--and what else?\"\n\n\"You can't wait for your newspaper?\" he said, smiling, after a moment's\npause.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders good-humoredly.\n\n\"Oh! I _know_--of course I know. Is it as good as you expected?\"\n\n\"As good as--\" The young man opened his mouth in wonder. \"What right\nhad I to expect anything?\"\n\n\"How modest! All the same, they want you--and they're very glad to get\nyou. But you can't save them.\"\n\n\"That's not generally expected of Under-Secretaries, is it?\"\n\n\"A good deal's expected of _you_. I talked to Lord Parham about you last\nnight.\"\n\nWilliam Ashe flushed a little.\n\n\"Did you? Very kind of you.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I didn't flatter you in the least. Nor did he. But they're\ngoing to give you your chance!\"\n\nShe bent forward and lightly patted the sleeve of his coat with the\nfingers of a very delicate hand. In this sympathetic aspect, Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es was no doubt exceedingly attractive. There were, of course,\nmany people who were not moved by it; to whom it was the conjuring of an\narch pretender. But these were generally of the female sex. Men, at any\nrate, lent themselves to the illusion. Ashe, certainly, had always done\nso. And to-night the spell still worked; though as her action drew his\nparticular attention to her face and expression, he was aware of slight\nchanges in her which recalled his mother's words of the afternoon. The\neyes were tired; at last he perceived in them some slight signs of years\nand harass. Up till now her dominating charm had been a kind of timeless\nsoftness and sensuousness, which breathed from her whole\npersonality--from her fair skin and hair, her large, smiling eyes. She\nput, as it were, the question of age aside. It was difficult to think of\nher as a child; it had been impossible to imagine her as an old woman.\n\n\"Well, this is all very surprising,\" said Ashe, \"considering that four\nmonths ago I did not matter an old shoe to anybody.\"\n\n\"That was your own fault. You took no trouble. And besides--there was\nyour poor brother in the way.\"\n\nAshe's brow contracted.\n\n\"No, that he never was,\" he said, with energy. \"Freddy was never in\nanybody's way--least of all in mine.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean,\" she said, hastily. \"And you know what friends he\nand I were--poor Freddy! But, after all, the world's the world.\"\n\n\"Yes--we all grow on somebody's grave,\" said Ashe. Then, just as she\nbecame conscious that she had jarred upon him, and must find a new\nopening, he himself found it. \"Tell me!\" he said, bending forward with a\nsudden alertness--\"who is that lady?\"\n\nHe pointed out a little figure in white, sitting in the opening of the\nsecond drawing-room; a very young girl apparently, surrounded by a group\nof men.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--\"I was coming to that--that's my girl\nKitty--\"\n\n\"Lady Kitty!\" said Ashe, in amazement. \"She's left school? I thought she\nwas quite a little thing.\"\n\n\"She's eighteen. Isn't she a darling? Don't you think her very pretty?\"\n\nAshe looked a moment.\n\n\"Extraordinarily bewitching!--unlike other people?\" he said, turning to\nthe mother.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es raised her eyebrows a little, in apparent amusement.\n\n\"I'm not going to describe Kitty. She's indescribable. Besides--you\nmust find her out. Do go and talk to her. She's to be half with me, half\nwith her aunt--Lady Grosville.\"\n\nAshe made some polite comment.\n\n\"Oh! don't let's be conventional!\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, flirting her\nfan with a little air of weariness--\"It's an odious arrangement. Lady\nGrosville and I, as you probably know, are not on terms. She says\natrocious things of me--and I--\" the fair head fell back a little, and\nthe white shoulders rose, with the slightest air of languid\ndisdain--\"well, bear me witness that I don't retaliate! It's not worth\nwhile. But I know that Grosville House can help Kitty. So!--\" Her\ngesture, half ironical, half resigned, completed the sentence.\n\n\"Does Lady Kitty like society?\"\n\n\"Kitty likes anything that flatters or excites her.\"\n\n\"Then of course she likes society. Anybody as pretty as that--\"\n\n\"Ah! how sweet of you!\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, softly--\"how sweet of\nyou! I like you to think her pretty. I like you to say so.\"\n\nAshe felt and looked a trifle disconcerted, but his companion bent\nforward and added--\"I don't know whether I want you to flirt with her!\nYou must take care. Kitty's the most fantastic creature. Oh! my life\nnow'll be very different. I find she takes all my thoughts and most of\nmy time!\"\n\nThere was something extravagant in the sweetness of the smile which\nemphasized the speech, and altogether, Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, in this new\nmaternal aspect, was not as agreeable as usual. Part of her charm\nperhaps had always lain in the fact that she had no domestic topics of\nher own, and so was endlessly ready for those of other people. Those,\nindeed, who came often to her house were accustomed to speak warmly of\nher \"unselfishness\"--by which they meant the easy patience with which\nshe could listen, smile, and flatter.\n\nPerhaps Ashe made this tacit demand upon her, no less than other people.\nAt any rate, as she talked cooingly on about her daughter, he would have\nfound her tiresome for once but for some arresting quality in that\nsmall, distant figure. As it was, he followed what she said with\nattention, and as soon as she had been recaptured by the impatient\nItalian Ambassador, he moved off, intending slowly to make his way to\nLady Kitty. But he was caught in many congratulations by the road, and\npresently he saw that his friend Darrell was being introduced to her by\nthe old habitu\u00c3\u00a9 of the house, Colonel Warington, who generally divided\nwith the hostess the \"lead\" of these social evenings.\n\nLady Kitty nodded carelessly to Mr. Darrell, and he sat down beside her.\n\n\"That's a cool hand for a girl of eighteen!\" thought Ashe. \"She has the\nairs of a princess--except for the chatter.\"\n\nChatter indeed! Wherever he moved, the sound of the light hurrying voice\nmade itself persistently heard through the hum of male conversation.\n\nYet once, Ashe, looking round to see if Darrell could be dislodged,\ncaught the chatterer silent, and found himself all at once invaded by a\nslight thrill, or shock.\n\nWhat did the girl's expression mean?--what was she thinking of? She was\nlooking intently at the crowded room, and it seemed to Ashe that\nDarrell's talk, though his lips moved quickly, was not reaching her at\nall. The dark brows were drawn together, and beneath them the eyes\nlooked sorely out. The delicate lips were slightly, piteously open, and\nthe whole girlish form in its young beauty appeared, as he watched, to\nshrink together. Suddenly the girl's look, so wide and searching, caught\nthat of Ashe; and he moved impulsively forward.\n\n\"Present me, please, to Lady Kitty,\" he said, catching Warington's arm.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said a low voice in his ear.\n\nAshe turned and saw Louis Harman. The tone, however--allusive, intimate,\npatronizing--in which Harman had spoken, annoyed him, and he passed on\nwithout taking any notice.\n\n\"Lady Kitty,\" said Warington, \"Mr. Ashe wishes to be presented to you.\nHe is an old friend of your mother's. Congratulate him--he has just got\ninto Parliament.\"\n\nLady Kitty drew herself up, and all trace of the look which Ashe had\nobserved disappeared. She bowed, not carelessly as she had bowed to\nDarrell, but with a kind of exaggerated stateliness, not less girlish.\n\n\"I never congratulate anybody,\" she said, shaking her head, \"till I know\nthem.\"\n\nAshe opened his eyes a little.\n\n\"How long must I wait?\" he said, smiling, as he drew a chair beside her.\n\n\"That depends. Are you difficult to know?\" She looked up at him\naudaciously, and he on his side could not take his eyes from her, so\nsingular was the small, sparkling face. The hair and skin were very\nfair, like her mother's, the eyes dark and full of fire, the neck most\ndaintily white and slender, the figure undeveloped, the feet and hands\nextremely small. But what arrested him was, so to speak, the embodied\ncontradiction of the personality--as between the wild intelligence of\nthe eyes and the extreme youth, almost childishness, of the rest.\n\nHe asked her if she had ever known any one confess to being easy, to\nknow.\n\n\"Well, I'm easy to know,\" she said, carelessly, leaning back; \"but,\nthen, I'm not worth knowing.\"\n\n\"Is one allowed to find out?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--of course! Do you know--when you were over there, I _willed_\nthat you should come and talk to me, and you came. Only,\" she sat up\nwith animation, and began to tick off her sentences on her\nfingers--\"Don't ask me how long I've been in town. Don't ask where I was\nin Paris. Don't inquire whether I like balls! You see, I warn you at\nonce\"--she looked up frankly--\"that we mayn't lose time.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I don't see how I'm ever to find out,\" said Ashe, stoutly.\n\n\"Whether I'm worth knowing?\" She considered, then bent forward eagerly.\n\"Look here! I'll just tell you everything in a lump, and then that'll\ndo--won't it? Listen. I'm just eighteen. I was sent to the Soeurs\nBlanches when I was thirteen--the year papa died. I _didn't_ like\npapa--I'm very sorry, but I didn't! However, that's by-the-way. In all\nthose years I have only seen maman once--she doesn't like children. But\nmy aunt Grosville has some French relations--very, _very_ 'comme il\nfaut,' you understand--and I used to go and stay with them for the\nholidays. Tell me!--did you ever hunt in France?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Ashe, startled and amused by the sudden glance of\nenthusiasm that lit up the face and expressed itself in the clasped\nhands.\n\n\"Oh! it's such heaven,\" she said, lifting her shoulders with an\nextravagant gesture--\"such _heaven_! First there are the old\ndresses--the men look such darlings!--and then the horns, and the old\nways they have--_si noble!--si distingu\u00c3\u00a9!_--not like your stupid English\nhunting. And then the dogs! Ah! the _dogs_\"--the shoulders went higher\nstill; \"do you know my cousin Henri actually gave me a puppy of the\ngreat breed--_the_ breed, you know--the Dogs of St. Hubert. Or at least\nhe _would_ if maman would have let me bring it over. And she wouldn't!\nJust think of that! When there are thousands of people in France who'd\ngive the eyes out of their head for one. I cried all one\nnight--Allons!--faut pas y penser!\"--she shook back the hair from her\neyes with an impatient gesture. \"My cousins have got a ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, you\nknow, in the Seine-et-Oise. They've promised to ask me next year--when\nthe Grand-Duke Paul comes--if I'll promise to behave. You see, I'm not a\nbit like French girls--I had so many affairs!\"\n\nHer eyes flashed with laughter.\n\nAshe laughed too.\n\n\"Are you going to tell me about them also?\"\n\nShe drew herself up.\n\n\"No! I play fair, always--ask anybody! Oh, I _do_ want to go back to\nFrance so badly!\" Once more she was all appeal and childishness.\n\"Anyway, I won't stay in England! I have made up my mind to that!\"\n\n\"How long has it taken?\"\n\n\"A fortnight,\" she said, slowly--\"just a fortnight.\"\n\n\"That hardly seems time enough--does it?\" said Ashe. \"Give us a little\nlonger.\"\n\n\"No--I--I hate you!\" said Lady Kitty, with a strange drop in her voice.\nHer little fingers began to drum on the table near her, and to Ashe's\nintense astonishment he saw her eyes fill with tears.\n\nSuddenly a movement towards the other room set in around them. Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es could be heard giving directions. A space was made in the\nlarge drawing-room--a little table appeared in it, and a footman placed\nthereon a glass of water.\n\nLady Kitty looked up.\n\n\"Oh, that _detestable_ man!\" she said, drawing back. \"No--I can't, I\ncan't bear it. Come with me!\" and beckoning to Ashe she fled with\nprecipitation into the farther part of the inner drawing-room, out of\nher mother's sight. Ashe followed her, and she dropped panting and elate\ninto a chair.\n\nMeanwhile the outer room gathered to hear the recitation of some _vers\nde soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9_, fondly believed by their author to be of a very pretty and\nPraedian make. They certainly amused the company, who laughed and\nclapped as each neat personality emerged. Lady Kitty passed the time\neither in a running commentary on the reciter, which occasionally\nconvulsed her companion, or else in holding her small hands over her\nears.\n\nWhen it was over, she drew a long breath.\n\n\"How maman _can!_ Oh! how _b\u00c3\u00aate_ you English are to applaud such a man!\nYou have only _one_ poet, haven't you--one living poet? Ah! I shouldn't\nhave laughed if it had been he!\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean Geoffrey Cliffe?\" said Ashe, amused. \"Nobody abroad\nseems ever to have heard of any one else.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, I just long to know him! Every one says he is so\ndangerous!--he makes all the women fall in love with him. That's\n_delicious_! He shouldn't make me! Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I knew him at Eton. We were 'swished' together,\" said Ashe.\n\nShe inquired what the phrase might mean, and when informed, flushed\nhotly, denouncing the English school system as quite unfit for gentlemen\nand men of honor. Her French cousins would sooner die than suffer such a\nthing. Then in the midst of her tirade she suddenly paused, and fixing\nAshe with her brilliant eyes, she asked him a surprising question, in a\nchanged and steady voice:\n\n\"Is Lady Tranmore not well?\"\n\nAshe was fairly startled.\n\n\"Thank you, I left her quite well. Have you--\"\n\n\"Did maman ask her to come to-night?\"\n\nIt was Ashe's turn to redden.\n\n\"I don't know. But--we are in mourning, you see, for my brother.\"\n\nHer face changed and softened instantly.\n\n\"Are you? I'm so sorry. I--I always say something stupid. Then--Lady\nTranmore used to come to maman's parties--before--\"\n\nShe had grown quite pale; it seemed to him that her hand shook. Ashe\nfelt an extraordinary pang of pity and concern.\n\n\"It's I, you see, to whom your mother has been kind,\" he said, gently.\n\"We're an independent family; we each make our own friends.\"\n\n\"No--\" she said, drawing a deep breath. \"No, it's not that. Look at that\nroom.\"\n\nFollowing her slight gesture, Ashe looked. It was an old, low-ceiled\nroom, panelled in white and gold, showing here and there an Italian\npicture--saint, or holy family, agreeable school-work--from which might\nbe inferred the tastes if not the _expertise_ of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' first\nhusband, Lord Blackwater. The floor was held by a plentiful collection\nof seats, neither too easy nor too stiff; arranged by one who understood\nto perfection the physical conditions at least which should surround the\n\"great art\" of conversation. At this moment every seat was full. A sea\nof black coats overflowed on the farther side, into the staircase\nlanding, where through the open door several standing groups could be\nseen; and in the inner room, where they sat, there was but little space\nbetween its margin and themselves. It was a remarkable sight; and in his\npast visits to the house Ashe had often said to himself that the\nelements of which it was made up were still more remarkable. Ministers\nand Opposition; ambassadors, travellers, journalists; the men of fashion\nand the men of reform; here a French republican official, and beyond\nhim, perhaps, a man whose ancestors were already of the most ancient\n_noblesse_ in Saint-Simon's day; artists, great and small, men of\nletters good and indifferent; all these had been among the guests of\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, brought to the house, each of them, for some quality's\nsake, some power of keeping up the social game.\n\nBut now, as he looked at the room, not to please himself but to obey\nLady Kitty, Ashe became aware of a new impression. The crowd was no\nless, numerically, than he had seen it in the early winter; but it\nseemed to him less distinguished, made up of coarser and commoner items.\nHe caught the face of a shady financier long since banished from Lady\nTranmore's parties; beyond him a red-faced colonel, conspicuous alike\nfor doubtful money-matters and matrimonial trouble; and in a farther\ncorner the sallow profile of a writer whose books were apt to rouse even\nthe man of the world to a healthy and contemptuous disgust. Surely these\npersons had never been there of old; he could not remember one of them.\n\nHe looked again, more closely. Was it fancy, or was the gathering itself\naware of the change which had passed over it? As a whole, it was\ncertainly noisier than of old; the shouting and laughter were incessant.\nBut within the general uproar certain groups had separated from other\ngroups, and were talking with a studied quiet. Most of the habitu\u00c3\u00a9's\nwere still there; but they held themselves apart from their neighbors.\nWere the old intimacy and solidarity beginning to break up?--and with\nthem the peculiar charm of these \"evenings,\" a charm which had so far\ndefied a social boycott that had been active from the first?\n\nHe glanced back uncertainly at Lady Kitty, and she looked at him.\n\n\"Why are there no ladies?\" she said, abruptly.\n\nHe collected his thoughts.\n\n\"It--it has always been a men's gathering. Perhaps for some men\nhere--I'm sorry there are such barbarians, Lady Kitty!--that makes the\ncharm of it. Look at that old fellow there! He is a most famous old\nboy. Everybody invites him--but he never stirs out of his den but to\ncome here. My mother can't get him--though she has tried often.\"\n\nAnd he pointed to a dishevelled, gray-haired gentleman, short in\nstature, round in figure, something, in short, like an animated egg, who\nwas addressing a group not far off.\n\nLady Kitty's face showed a variety of expressions.\n\n\"Are there many parties like this in London? Are the ladies asked, and\ndon't come? I--I don't--understand!\"\n\nAshe looked at her kindly.\n\n\"There is no other hostess in London as clever as your mother,\" he\ndeclared, and then tried to change the subject; but she paid no heed.\n\n\"The other day, at Aunt Grosville's,\" she said, slowly, \"I asked if my\ntwo cousins might come to-night, and they looked at me as though I were\nmad! Oh, _do_ talk to me!\" She came impulsively nearer, and Ashe noticed\nthat Darrell, standing against the doorway of communication, looked\nround at them in amusement. \"I liked your face--the very first moment\nwhen I saw you across the room. Do you know--you're--you're very\nhandsome!\" She drew back, her eyes fixed gravely, intently upon him.\n\nFor the first time Ashe was conscious of annoyance.\n\n\"I hope you won't mind my saying so\"--his tone was a little short--\"but\nin this country we don't say those things. They're not--quite polite.\"\n\n\"Aren't they?\" Her eyebrows arched themselves and her lips fell in\npenitence. \"I always called my French cousin, Henri la Fresnay, _beau!_\nI am sure he liked it!\" The accent was almost plaintive.\n\nAshe's natural impulse was to say that if so the French cousin must be\nan ass. But all in a moment he found himself seized with a desire to\ntake her little hands in his own and press them--she looked such a\nchild, so exquisite, and so forlorn. And he did in fact bend forward\nconfidentially, forgetting Darrell.\n\n\"I want you to come and see my mother?\" he said, smiling at her. \"Ask\nLady Grosville to bring you.\"\n\n\"May I? But--\" She searched his face, eager still to pour out the\nimpulsive, uncontrolled confidences that were in her mind. But his\nexpression stopped her, and she gave a little, resentful sigh.\n\n\"Yes--I'll come. _We_--you and I--are a little bit cousins too--aren't\nwe? We talked about you at the Grosvilles.\"\n\n\"Was our 'great-great' the same person?\" he said, laughing. \"Hope it was\na decent 'great-great.' Some of mine aren't much to boast of. Well, at\nany rate, let's _be_ cousins--whether we are or no, shall we?\"\n\nShe assented, her whole face lighting up.\n\n\"And we're going to meet--the week after next!\" she said, triumphantly,\n\"in the country.\"\n\n\"Are we?--at Grosville Park. That's delightful.\"\n\n\"And _then_ I'll ask your advice--I'll make you tell me--a hundred\nthings! That's a bargain--mind!\"\n\n\"Kitty! Come and help me with tea--there's a darling!\"\n\nLady Kitty turned. A path had opened through the crowd, and Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, much escorted, a vision of diamonds and pale-pink satin,\nappeared, leading the way to the supper-room, and the light\n\"refection,\" accompanied by much champagne, which always closed these\nevenings.\n\nThe girl rose, as did her companion also. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es threw a\nquick, half-satirical glance at Ashe, but he had eyes only for Lady\nKitty, and her transformation at the touch of her mother's voice. She\nfollowed Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es with a singular and conscious dignity, her\nwhite skirts sweeping, her delicately fine head thrown back on her thin\nneck and shoulders. The black crowd closed about her; and Ashe's eyes\npursued the slender figure till it disappeared.\n\nExtreme youth--innocence--protest--pain--was it with these touching and\npleading impressions, after all, that his first talk with Kitty Bristol\nhad left him? Yet what a little _\u00c3\u00a9tourdie_! How lacking in the reserves,\nthe natural instincts and shrinkings of the well-bred English girl!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarrell and Ashe walked home together, through a windy night which was\nbringing out April scents even from the London grass and lilac-bushes.\n\n\"Well,\" said Darrell, as they stepped into the Green Park, \"so you're\nsafely in. Congratulate you, old fellow. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes. They've offered me Hickson's place. More fools they, don't you\nthink?\"\n\n\"Good! Upon my word, Bill, you've got your foot in the stirrup now! Hope\nyou'll continue to be civil to poor devils like me.\"\n\nThe speaker looked up smiling, but neither the tone nor the smile was\nreally cordial. Ashe felt the embarrassment that he had once or twice\nfelt before in telling Darrell news of good fortune. There seemed to be\nsomething in Darrell that resented it--under an outer show of\nfelicitation.\n\nHowever, they went on talking of the political moment and its prospects,\nand of Ashe's personal affairs. As to the last, Darrell questioned, and\nAshe somewhat reluctantly replied. It appeared that his allowance was to\nbe largely raised, that his paralyzed father, in fact, was anxious to\nput him in possession of a substantial share in the income of the\nestates, that one of the country-houses was to be made over to him, and\nso on.\n\n\"Which means, of course, that they want you to marry,\" said Darrell.\n\"Well, you've only to throw the handkerchief.\"\n\nThey were passing a lamp as he spoke, and the light shone on his long,\npale face--a face of discontent--with its large sunken eyes and hollow\ncheeks.\n\nAshe treated the remark as \"rot,\" and endeavored to get away from his\nown affairs by discussing the party they had just left.\n\n\"How does she get all those people together? It's astonishing!\"\n\n\"Well, I always liked Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es well enough,\" said Darrell, \"but,\nupon my word, she has done a beastly mean thing in bringing that girl\nover.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"--Ashe hesitated--\"that her own position is too doubtful?\"\n\n\"Doubtful, my dear fellow!\" Darrell laughed unpleasantly. \"I never\nreally understood what it all meant till the other night when old Lady\nGrosville took and told me--more at any rate than I knew before. The\nGrosvilles are on the war-path, and they regard the coming of this poor\nchild as the last straw.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Ashe.\n\nDarrell gave a shrug. \"Well, you know the story of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es'\nstep-daughter--old Blackwater's daughter?\"\n\n\"Ah! by his first marriage? I knew it was something about the\nstep-daughter,\" said Ashe, vaguely.\n\nDarrell began to repeat his conversation with Lady Grosville. The tale\nthreatened presently to become a black one indeed; and at last Ashe\nstood still in the broad walk crossing the Green Park.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, resolutely, \"don't tell me any more. I don't want\nto hear any more.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Darrell, in amazement.\n\n\"Because\"--Ashe hesitated a moment. \"Well, I don't want it to be made\nimpossible for me to go to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' again. Besides, we've just\neaten her salt.\"\n\n\"You're a good friend!\" said Darrell, not without something of a sneer.\n\nAshe was ruffled by the tone, but tried not to show it. He merely\ninsisted that he knew Lady Grosville to be a bit of an old cat; that of\ncourse there was something up; but it seemed a shame for those at least\nwho accepted Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' hospitality to believe the worst. There\nwas a curious mixture of carelessness and delicacy in his remarks, very\ncharacteristic of the man. It appeared as though he was at once too\nindolent to go into the matter, and too chivalrous to talk about it.\n\nDarrell presently maintained a rather angry silence. No man likes to be\nchecked in his story, especially when the check implies something like\na snub from his best friend. Suddenly, memory brought before him the\nlittle picture of Ashe and Lady Kitty together--he bending over her, in\nhis large, handsome geniality, and she looking up. Darrell felt a twinge\nof jealousy--then disgust. Really, men like Ashe had the world too\neasily their own way. That they should pose, besides, was too much.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nRather more than a fortnight after the evening at Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es',\nWilliam Ashe found himself in a Midland train on his way to the\nCambridgeshire house of Lady Grosville. While the April country slipped\npast him--like some blanched face to which life and color are\nreturning--Ashe divided his time between an idle skimming of the\nSaturday papers and a no less idle dreaming of Kitty Bristol. He had\nseen her two or three times since his first introduction to her--once at\na ball to which Lady Grosville had taken her, and once on the terrace of\nthe House of Commons, where he had strolled up and down with her for a\nmost amusing and stimulating hour, while her mother entertained a group\nof elderly politicians. And the following day she had come alone--her\nown choice--to take tea with Lady Tranmore, on that lady's invitation,\nas prompted by her son. Ashe himself had arrived towards the end of the\nvisit, and had found a Lady Kitty in the height of the fashion, stiff\nmannered, and flushed to a deep red by her own consciousness that she\ncould not possibly be making a good impression. At sight of him she\nrelaxed, and talked a great deal, but not wisely; and when she was gone,\nAshe could get very little opinion of any kind from his mother, who had,\nhowever, expressed a wish that she should come and visit them in the\ncountry.\n\nSince then he frankly confessed to himself that in the intervals of his\nnew official and administrative work he had been a good deal haunted by\nmemories of this strange child, her eyes, her grace--even in her fits of\nproud shyness--and the way in which, as he had put her into her cab\nafter the visit to Lady Tranmore, her tiny hand had lingered in his, a\nmute, astonishing appeal. Haunted, too, by what he heard of her fortunes\nand surroundings. What was the real truth of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es'\nsituation? During the preceding weeks some ugly rumors had reached Ashe\nof financial embarrassment in that quarter, of debts risen to\nmountainous height, of crisis and possible disappearance. Then these\nrumors were met by others, to the effect that Colonel Warington, the old\nfriend and support of the d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' household, had come to the rescue,\nthat the crisis had been averted, and that the three weekly evenings, so\nwell known and so well attended, would go on; and with this phase of the\nstory there mingled, as Ashe was well aware, not the slightest breath of\nscandal, in a case where, so to speak, all was scandal.\n\nAnd meanwhile what new and dolorous truths had Lady Kitty been learning\nas to her mother's history and her mother's position? By Jove! it _was_\nhard upon the girl. Darrell was right. Why not leave her to her French\nfriends and relations?--or relinquish her to Lady Grosville? Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had seen little or nothing of her for years. She could not,\ntherefore, be necessary to her mother's happiness, and there was a real\ncruelty in thus claiming her, at the very moment of her entrance into\nsociety, where Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es could only stand in her way. For\nalthough many a man whom the girl might profitably marry was to be\nfound among the mother's guests, the influences of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es'\n\"evenings\" were certainly not matrimonial. Still the unforeseen was\nsurely the probable in Lady Kitty's case. What sort of man ought she to\nmarry--what sort of man could safely take the risks of marrying\nher--with that mother in the background?\n\nHe descended at the way-side station prescribed to him, and looked round\nhim for fellow-guests--much as the card-player examines his hand. Mary\nLyster, a cabinet minister--filling an ornamental office and handed on\nfrom ministry to ministry as a kind of necessary appendage, the public\nnever knew why--the minister's second wife, an attach\u00c3\u00a9 from the Austrian\nembassy, two members of Parliament, and a well-known journalist--Ashe\nsaid to himself flippantly that so far the trumps were not many. But he\nwas always reasonably glad to see Mary, and he went up to her, cared for\nher bag, and made her put on her cloak, with cousinly civility. In the\nomnibus on the way to the house he and Mary gossiped in a corner, while\nthe cabinet minister and the editor went to sleep, and the two members\nof Parliament practised some courageous French on the Austrian attach\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Is it to be a large party?\" he asked of his companion.\n\n\"Oh! they always fill the house. A good many came down yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not curious,\" said Ashe, \"except as to one person.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Lady Kitty Bristol.\"\n\nMary Lyster smiled.\n\n\"Yes, poor child, I heard from the Grosville girls that she was to be\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why 'poor child'?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Quite the wrong expression, I admit. It should be 'poor\nhostess.'\"\n\n\"Oh!--the Grosvilles complain?\"\n\n\"No. They're only on tenter-hooks. They never know what she will do\nnext.\"\n\n\"How good for the Grosvilles!\"\n\n\"You think society is the better for shocks?\"\n\n\"Lady Grosville can do with them, anyway. What a masterful woman! But\nI'll back Lady Kitty.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen her yet,\" said Mary. \"I hear she is a very odd-looking\nlittle thing.\"\n\n\"Extremely pretty,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Really?\" Mary lifted incredulous eyebrows. \"Well, now I shall know what\nyou admire.\"\n\n\"Oh, my tastes are horribly catholic--I admire so many people,\" said\nAshe, with a glance at the well-dressed elegance beside him. Mary\ncolored a little, unseen; and the rattle of the carriage as it entered\nthe covered porch of Grosville Park cut short their conversation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you got in,\" said Lady Grosville, in her full, loud\nvoice, \"because we are connections. But of course I regard the loss of a\nseat to our side just now as a great disaster.\"\n\n\"Very grasping, on your part!\" said Ashe. \"You've had it all your own\nway lately. Think of Portsmouth!\"\n\nLady Grosville, however, as she met his bantering look, did not find\nherself at all inclined to think of Portsmouth. She was much more\ninclined to think of William Ashe. What a good-looking fellow he had\ngrown! She heaved an inward sigh, of mingled envy and appreciation,\ndirected towards Lady Tranmore.\n\nPoor Susan indeed had suffered terribly in the death of her eldest son.\nBut the handsomer and abler of the two brothers still remained to\nher--and the estate was safe. Lady Grosville thought of her own three\ndaughters, plain and almost dowerless; and of that conceited young man,\nthe heir, whom she could hardly persuade her husband to invite, once a\nyear, for appearance sake.\n\n\"Why are we so early?\" said Ashe, looking at his watch. \"I thought I\nshould be disgracefully late.\"\n\nFor he and Lady Grosville had the library to themselves. It was a fine,\nbook-walled room, with giallo antico columns and Adam decoration; and in\nits richly colored lamp-lit space, the seated figure--stiffly erect--of\nLady Grosville, her profile, said by some to be like a horse and by\nothers to resemble Savonarola, the cap of old Venice point that crowned\nher grizzled hair, her black velvet dress, and the long-fingered, ugly,\nyet distinguished hands which lay upon her lap, told significantly;\nespecially when contrasted with the negligent ease and fresh-colored\nyouth of her companion.\n\nGrosville Park was rich in second-rate antiques; and there was a\nGreco-Roman head above the bookcase with which Ashe had been often\ncompared. As he stood now leaning against the fireplace, the close-piled\ncurls, and eyes--somewhat \"\u00c3\u00a0 fleur de t\u00c3\u00aate\"--of the bust were\nundoubtedly repeated with some closeness in the living man. Those whom\nhe had offended by some social carelessness or other said of him when\nthey wished to run him down, that he was \"floridly\" handsome; and there\nwas some truth in it.\n\n\"Didn't you get the message about dinner?\" said Lady Grosville. Then, as\nhe shook his head: \"Very remiss of Parkin. I always tell him he loses\nhis head directly the party goes into double figures. We had to put off\ndinner a quarter of an hour because of Kitty Bristol, who missed her\ntrain at St. Pancras, and only arrived half an hour ago. By-the-way, I\nsuppose you have already seen her--at that woman's?\"\n\n\"I met her a week or two ago, at Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es',\" said Ashe,\napparently preoccupied with something wrong in the set of his white\nwaistcoat.\n\n\"What did you think of her?\"\n\n\"A charming young lady,\" said Ashe, smiling. \"What else should I think?\"\n\n\"A lamb thrown to the wolves,\" said Lady Grosville, grimly. \"How that\nwoman _could_ do such a thing!\"\n\n\"I saw nothing lamblike about Lady Kitty,\" said Ashe. \"And do you\ninclude me among the wolves?\"\n\nLady Grosville hesitated a moment, then stuck to her colors.\n\n\"You shouldn't go to such a house,\" she said, boldly--\"I suppose I may\nsay that without offence, William, as I've known you from a boy.\"\n\n\"Say anything you like, my dear Lady Grosville! So you--believe evil\nthings--of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es?\"\n\nHis tone was light, but his eyes sought the distant door, as though\ninvoking some fellow-guest to appear and protect him.\n\nLady Grosville did not answer. Ashe's look returned to her, and he was\nstartled by the expression of her face. He had always known and\nunwillingly admired her for a fine Old Testament Christian, one from\nwhom the language of the imprecatory Psalms with regard to her enemies,\npersonal and political, might have flowed more naturally than from any\nother person he knew, of the same class and breeding. But this\nloathing--this passion of contempt--this heat of memory!--these were new\nindeed, and the fire of them transfigured the old, gray face.\n\n\"I have known a fair number of bad people,\" said Lady Grosville, in a\nlow voice--\"and a good many wicked women. But for meanness and vileness\ncombined, the things I know of the woman who was Blackwater's wife have\nno equal in my experience!\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause. Then Ashe said, in a voice as serious as her\nown:\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you say that, partly because I like Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, and partly--because--I was particularly attracted by Lady\nKitty.\"\n\nLady Grosville looked up sharply. \"Don't marry her, William!--don't\nmarry her! She comes of a bad stock.\"\n\nAshe recovered his gayety.\n\n\"She is your own niece. Mightn't a man dare--on that guarantee?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Lady Grosville, unappeased. \"I was a hop out of kin.\nBesides--a Methodist governess saved me; she converted me, at eighteen,\nand I owe her everything. But my brothers--and all the rest of us!\" She\nthrew up her eyes and hands. \"What's the good of being mealy mouthed\nabout it? All the world knows it. A good many of us were mad--and I\nsometimes think I see more than eccentricity in Kitty.\"\n\n\"Who was Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es?\" said Ashe. Why should he wince so at the\ngirl's name?--in that hard mouth?\n\nLady Grosville smiled.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you a good deal about that,\" she said. \"Ah!--another\ntime!\"\n\nFor the door opened, and in came a group of guests, with a gush of talk\nand a rustling of silks and satins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverybody was gathered; dinner had been announced; and the white-haired\nand gouty Lord Grosville was in a state of seething impatience that not\neven the mild-voiced Dean of the neighboring cathedral, engaged in\ncomplimenting him on his speech at the Diocesan Conference, could\nrestrain.\n\n\"Adelina, need we wait any longer?\" said the master of the house,\nturning an angry eye upon his wife.\n\n\"Certainly not--she has had ample time,\" said Lady Grosville, and rang\nthe bell beside her.\n\nSuddenly there was a whirlwind of noise in the hall, the angry barking\nof a small dog, the sound of a girl's voice laughing and scolding, the\nswish of silk skirts. A scandalized butler, obeying Lady Grosville's\nsummons, threw the door open, and in burst Lady Kitty.\n\n\"Oh! I'm so sorry,\" said the new-comer, in a tone of despair. \"But I\ncouldn't leave him up-stairs, Aunt Lina! He'd eaten one of my shoes, and\nbegun upon the other. And Julie's afraid of him. He bit her last week.\n_May_ he sit on my knee? I know I can keep him quiet!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"A SLIM GIRL IN WHITE AT THE FAR END OF THE LARGE ROOM\"]\n\nEvery conversation in the library stopped. Twenty amazed persons turned\nto look. They beheld a slim girl in white at the far end of the large\nroom struggling with a gray terrier puppy which she held under her\nleft arm, and turning appealing eyes towards Lady Grosville. The dog,\nhalf frightened, half fierce, was barking furiously. Lady Kitty's voice\ncould hardly be heard through the din, and she was crimson with the\neffort to control her charge. Her lips laughed; her eyes implored. And\nto add to the effect of the apparition, a marked strangeness of dress\nwas at once perceived by all the English eyes turned upon her. Lady\nKitty was robed in the extreme of French fashion, which at that moment\nwas a fashion of flounces; she was much _d\u00c3\u00a9collet\u00c3\u00a9e;_ and her fair,\nabundant hair, carried to a great height, and arranged with a certain\ncalculated wildness around her small face, was surmounted by a large\nscarlet butterfly which shone defiantly against the dark background of\nbooks.\n\n\"Kitty!\" said Lady Grosville, advancing indignantly, \"what a dreadful\nnoise! Pray give the dog to Parkin at once.\"\n\nLady Kitty only held the struggling animal tighter.\n\n\"_Please_, Aunt Lina!--I'm afraid he'll bite! But he'll be quite good\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Why _did_ you bring him, Kitty? We can't have such a creature at\ndinner!\" said Lady Grosville, angrily.\n\nLord Grosville advanced behind his wife.\n\n\"How do you do, Kitty? Hadn't you better put down the dog and come and\nbe introduced to Mr. Rankine, who is to take you in to dinner?\"\n\nLady Kitty shook her fair head, but advanced, still clinging to the dog,\ngave a smile and a nod to Ashe, and a bow to the young Tory member\npresented to her.\n\n\"You don't mind him?\" she said, a flash of laughter in her dark eyes.\n\"We'll manage him between us, won't we?\"\n\nThe young man, dazzled by her prettiness and her strangeness, murmured a\nhopeful assent. Lord Grosville, with the air of a man determined on\ndinner though the skies fall, offered his arm to Lady Edith Manley, the\nwife of the cabinet minister, and made for the dining-room. The stream\nof guests followed; when suddenly the puppy, perceiving on the floor a\nball of wool which had rolled out of Lady Grosville's work-table,\nescaped in an ecstasy of mischief from his mistress's arm and flew upon\nthe ball. Kitty rushed after him; the wool first unrolled, then caught;\nthe table overturned and all its contents were flung pell-mell in the\npath of Lady Grosville, who, on the arm of the amused and astonished\nminister, was waiting in restrained fury till her guests should pass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I shall never get over this,\" said Lady Kitty, as she leaned back in\nher chair, still panting, and quite incapable of eating any of the foods\nthat were being offered to her in quick succession.\n\n\"I don't know that you deserve to,\" said Ashe, turning a face upon her\nwhich was as grave as he could make it. The attention of every one else\nround the room was also in truth occupied with his companion. There was,\nindeed, a general buzz of conversation and a general pretence that Lady\nKitty's proceedings might now be ignored. But in reality every guest,\nmale or female, kept a stealthy watch on the red butterfly and the\nsparkling face beneath it; and Ashe was well aware of it.\n\n\"I vow it was not my fault,\" said Kitty, with dignity. \"I was not\nallowed to have the dog I should have had. You'd never have found a dog\nof St. Hubert condescending to bedroom slippers! But as I had to have a\ndog--and Colonel Warington gave me this one three days ago--and he has\nalready ruined half maman's things, and no one could manage him but me,\nI just had to bring him, and trust to Providence.\"\n\n\"I have been here a good many times,\" said Ashe, \"and I never yet saw a\ndog in the sanctuary. Do you know that Pitt once wrote a speech in the\nlibrary?\"\n\n\"Did he? I'm sure it never made such a stir as Ponto did.\" Kitty's face\nsuddenly broke into laughter, and she hid it a moment in her hands.\n\n\"You brazen it out,\" said Ashe; \"but how are you going to appease Lady\nGrosville?\"\n\nKitty ceased to laugh. She drew herself up, and looked seriously,\nobservantly at her aunt.\n\n\"I don't know. But I must do it somehow. I don't want any more worries.\"\n\nSo changed were her tone and aspect that Ashe turned a friendly\nexamining look upon her.\n\n\"Have you been worried?\" he said, in a lower voice.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders and made no reply. But presently she\nimpatiently reclaimed his attention, snatching him from the lady he had\ntaken in to dinner, with no scruple at all.\n\n\"Will you come a walk with me to-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"Proud,\" said Ashe. \"What time?\"\n\n\"As soon as we can get rid of these people,\" she said, her eye running\nround the table. Then as it paused and lingered on the face of Mary\nLyster opposite, she abruptly asked him who that lady might be.\n\nAshe informed her.\n\n\"Your cousin?\" she said, looking at him with a slight frown. \"Your\ncousin? I don't--well, I don't think I shall like her.\"\n\n\"That's a great pity,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"For me?\" she said, distrustfully.\n\n\"For both, of course! My mother's very fond of Miss Lyster. She's often\nwith us.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Kitty, and looked again at the face opposite. Then he heard\nher say behind her fan, half to herself and half to him:\n\n\"She does not interest me in the least! She has no ideas! I'm sure she\nhas no ideas. Has she?\"\n\nShe turned abruptly to Ashe.\n\n\"Every one calls her very clever.\"\n\nKitty looked contempt.\n\n\"That's nothing to do with it. It's not the clever people who have\nideas.\"\n\nAshe bantered her a little on the meaning of her words, till he\npresently found that she was too young and unpractised to be able to\ntake his thrusts and return them, with equanimity. She could make a\ndaring sally or reply; but it was still the raw material of\nconversation; it wanted ease and polish. And she was evidently conscious\nof it herself, for presently her cheek flushed and her manner wavered.\n\n\"I suppose you--everybody--thinks her very agreeable?\" she said,\nsharply, her eyes returning to Miss Lyster.\n\n\"She is a most excellent gossip,\" said Ashe. \"I always go to her for the\nnews.\"\n\nKitty glanced again.\n\n\"I can see that already she detests me.\"\n\n\"In half an hour?\"\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n\"She has looked at me twice--about. But she has made up her mind--and\nshe never changes.\" Then with an abrupt alteration of note she looked\nround the room. \"I suppose your English dining-rooms are all like this?\nOne might be sitting in a hearse. And the pictures--no! _Quelles\nhorreurs_!\"\n\nShe raised her shoulders again impetuously, frowning at a huge\nfull-length opposite of Lord Grosville as M.F.H., a masterpiece indeed\nof early Victorian vulgarity.\n\nThen suddenly, hastily, with that flashing softness which so often\ntransformed her expression, she turned towards him, trying to make\namends.\n\n\"But the library--that was _bien_--ah! _tr-r\u00c3\u00a8s, tr-r\u00c3\u00a8s_ bien_!\"\n\nHer r's rolled a little as she spoke, with a charming effect, and she\nlooked at him radiantly, as though to strike and to make amends were\nequally her prerogative, and she asked no man's leave.\n\n\"You've not yet seen what there is to see here,\" said Ashe, smiling.\n\"Look behind you.\"\n\nThe girl turned her slim neck and exclaimed. For behind Ashe's chair was\nthe treasure of the house. It was a \"Dance of Children,\" by one of the\nmost famous of the eighteenth-century masters. From the dark wall it\nshone out with a flower-like brilliance, a vision of color and of grace.\nThe children danced through a golden air, their bodies swaying to one of\nthose \"unheard melodies\" of art, sweeter than all mortal tunes; their\ndelicate faces alive with joy. The sky and grass and trees seemed to\ncaress them; a soft sunlight clothed them; and flowers brushed their\nfeet.\n\nKitty turned back again and was silent. Was it Ashe's fancy, or had she\ngrown pale?\n\n\"Did you like it?\" he asked her. She turned to him, and for the second\ntime in their acquaintance he saw her eyes floating in tears.\n\n\"It is too beautiful!\" she said, with an effort--almost an angry effort.\n\"I don't want to see it again.\"\n\n\"I thought it would give you pleasure,\" said Ashe, gently, suddenly\nconscious of a hope that she was not aware of the slight look of\namusement with which Mary Lyster was contemplating them both.\n\n\"So it did,\" said Kitty, furtively applying her lace handkerchief to her\ntears; \"but\"--her voice dropped--\"when one's unhappy--very\nunhappy--things like that--things like _Heaven_--hurt! Oh, what a _fool_\nI am!\" And she sat straightly up, looking round her.\n\nThere was a pause; then Ashe said, in another voice:\n\n\"Look here, you know this won't do. I thought we were to be cousins.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Kitty, indifferently, not looking at him.\n\n\"And I understood that I was to be taken into respectable cousinly\ncounsel?\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Kitty again, crumbling her bread. \"I can't do it here, can\nI?\"\n\nAshe laughed.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, we're going to sample the garden to-morrow morning,\naren't we?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Kitty. Then, after a moment, she looked at her\nright-hand neighbor, the young politician to whom as yet she had\nscarcely vouchsafed a word.\n\n\"What's his name?\" she asked, under her breath. Ashe repeated it.\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to talk to him?\"\n\n\"Of course you ought,\" said Ashe, with smiling decision, and turning to\nthe lady whom he had brought in he left her free.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the ladies rose, Lady Grosville led the way to the large\ndrawing-room, a room which, like the library, had some character, and a\nthin elegance of style, not, however, warmed and harmonized by the\ndelightful presence of books. The walls, blue and white in color, were\npanelled in stucco relief. A few family portraits, stiff handlings of\nstiff people, were placed each in the exact centre of its respective\npanel. There were a few cases of china and a few polished tables. A\ncrimson Brussels carpet, chosen by Lady Grosville for its\n\"cheerfulness,\" covered the floor, and there was a large white sheepskin\nrug before the fireplace. A few hyacinths in pots, and the bright fire\nsupplied the only gay and living notes--before the ladies arrived.\n\nStill, for an English eye, the room had a certain cold charm, was\nmoreover full of _history_. It hardly deserved at any rate the shiver\nwith which Kitty Bristol looked round it.\n\nBut she had little time to dwell upon the room and its meanings, for\nLady Grosville approached her with a manner which still showed signs of\nthe catastrophe before dinner.\n\n\"Kitty, I think you don't know Miss Lyster yet--Mary Lyster--she wants\nto be introduced to you.\"\n\nMary advanced smiling; Kitty held out a limp hand, and they exchanged a\nfew words standing in the centre of the floor, while the other guests\nfound seats.\n\n\"What a charming contrast!\" said Lady Edith Manley in Lady Grosville's\near. She nodded smiling towards the standing pair--struck by the fine\nstraight lines of Mary's satin dress, the roundness of her fine figure,\nthe oval of her head and face, and then by the little, vibrating,\ntempestuous creature beside her, so distinguished, in spite of the\nbillowing flounces and ribbons, so direct and significant, amid all the\nelaboration.\n\n\"Kitty is ridiculously overdressed,\" said Lady Grosville. \"I hope we\nshall soon change that. My girls are going to take her to their woman.\"\n\nLady Edith put up her eye-glass slowly and looked at the two Grosville\ngirls; then back at Kitty.\n\nMeanwhile a few perfunctory questions and answers were passing between\nMiss Lyster and her companion. Mary's aspect as she talked was extremely\namiable; one might have called it indulgent, perhaps even by an\nadjective that implied a yet further shade of delicate superiority.\nKitty met it by the same \"grand manner\" that Ashe had several times\nobserved in her, a manner caught perhaps from some French model, and\ncaricatured in the taking. Her eyes meanwhile took note of Mary's face\nand dress, and while she listened her small teeth tormented her\nunder-lip, as though she restrained impatience. All at once in the midst\nof some information that Miss Lyster was lucidly giving, Kitty made an\nimpetuous turn. She had caught some words on the farther side of the\nroom; and she looked hard, eagerly, at the speaker.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she inquired.\n\nMary Lyster, with a sharp sense of interruption, replied that she\nbelieved the lady in question was the Grosville's French governess. But\nin the very midst of her sentence Kitty deserted her, left her standing\nin the centre of the drawing-room, while the deserter fled across it,\nand sinking down beside the astonished mademoiselle took the\nFrenchwoman's hand by assault and held it in both her own.\n\n\"Vous parlez Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais?--vous \u00c3\u00aates Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise? Ah! \u00c3\u00a7a me fait tant de\nbien! Voyons! voyons!--causons un peu!\"\n\nAnd bending forward, she broke into a cataract of French, all the\nelements of her strange, small beauty rushing, as it were, into flame\nand movement at the swift sound and cadence of the words, like a dancer\nkindled by music. The occasion was of the slightest; the Frenchwoman\nmight well show a natural bewilderment. But into the slight occasion the\ngirl threw an animation, a passion, that glorified it. It was like the\nleap of a wild rain-stream on the mountains, that pours into the first\nchannel which presents itself.\n\n\"What beautiful French!\" said Lady Edith, softly, to Mary Lyster, who\nhad found a seat beside her.\n\nMary Lyster smiled.\n\n\"She has been at school, of course, in a French convent.\" Somehow the\ntone implied that the explanation disposed of all merit in the\nperformance.\n\n\"I am afraid these French convent schools are not at all what they\nshould be,\" said Lady Grosville.\n\nAnd rising to a pyramidal height, her ample moir\u00c3\u00a9 dress swelling behind\nher, her gray head magnificently crowned by its lace cap and black\nvelvet _bandeau_, she swept across the room to where the Dean's wife,\nMrs. Winston, sat in fascinated silence observing Lady Kitty. The\nsilence and the attention annoyed her hostess. The first thing to be\ndone with girls of this type, it seemed to Lady Grosville, was to prove\nto them that they would _not_ be allowed to monopolize society.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are natural monopolies, however, and they are not easy to deal\nwith.\n\nAs soon as the gentlemen returned, Mr. Rankine, whom she had treated so\nbadly at dinner, the young agent of the estate, the clergyman of the\nparish, the Austrian attach\u00c3\u00a9, the cabinet minister, and the Dean, all\nshowed a strong inclination to that side of the room which seemed to be\nheld in force by Lady Kitty. The Dean especially was not to be gainsaid.\nHe placed himself in the seat shyly vacated by the French governess, and\ncrossed his thin, stockinged legs with the air of one who means to take\nhis ease. There was even a certain curious resemblance between him and\nKitty, as was noticed from a distance by Ashe. The Dean, who was very\nmuch a man of the world, and came of an historic family, was, in his\nmasculine degree, planned on the same miniature scale and with the same\nfine finish as the girl of eighteen. And he carried his knee-breeches,\nhis apron, and his exquisite white head with a natural charm and energy\nakin to hers--mellowed though it were by time, and dignified by office.\nHe began eagerly to talk to her of Paris. His father had been\nambassador for a time under Louis Philippe, and he had boyish memories\nof the great house in the Faubourg St. Honor\u00c3\u00a9, and of the Orleanist\nministers and men of letters. And lo! Kitty met him at once, in a glow\nand sparkle that enchanted the old man. Moreover, it appeared that this\nmuch-beflounced young lady could talk; that she had heard of the famous\nnames and the great affairs to which the Dean made allusion; that she\npossessed indeed a native and surprising interest in matter of the sort;\nand a manner, above all, with the old, alternately soft and daring,\ncalculated, as Lady Grosville would no doubt have put it, merely to make\nfools of them.\n\nIn her cousins' house, it seemed, she had talked with old people,\nsurvivors of the Orleanist and Bourbon r\u00c3\u00a9gimes--even of the Empire; had\nsat at their feet, a small, excited hero-worshipper; and had then rushed\nblindly into the memoirs and books that concerned them. So, in this\nFrench world the child had found time for other things than hunting, and\nthe flattery of her cousin Henri? Ashe was supposed to be devoting\nhimself to the Dean's wife; but both he and she listened most of the\ntime to the sallies and the laughter of the circle where Kitty presided.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" cried the delighted Dean, \"I never find anybody\nwho can talk of these things--it is really astonishing. Ah, _now_, we\nEnglish know nothing of France--nor they of us. Why, I was a mere\nschool-boy then, and I had a passion for their society, and their\nbooks--for their _plays_--dare I confess it?\"--he lowered his voice and\nglanced at his hostess--\"their plays, above all!\"\n\nKitty clapped her hands. The Dean looked at her, and ran on:\n\n\"My mother shared it. When I came over for my Eton holidays, she and I\nlived at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. Ah, those were days! _I_ remember\nMademoiselle Mars in 'Hernani.'\"\n\nKitty bounded in her seat. Whereupon it appeared that just before she\nleft Paris she had been taken by a friend to see the reigning idol of\nthe Com\u00c3\u00a9die-Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise, the young and astonishing actress, Sarah\nBernhardt, as Do\u00c3\u00b1a Sol. And there began straightway an excited duet\nbetween her and the Dean; a comparison of old and new, a rivalry of\nheroines, a hot and critical debate that presently silenced all other\nconversation in the room, and brought Lord Grosville to stand gaping and\nastounded behind the Dean, reflecting no doubt that this was not\nprecisely the Dean of the Diocesan Conference.\n\nThe old man indeed forgot his age, the girl her youth; they met as\nequals, on poetic ground, till suddenly Kitty, springing up, and to\nprove her point, began an imitation of Sarah in the great love-scene of\nthe last act, before arresting fate, in the person of Don Ruy, breaks in\nupon the rapture of the lovers. She absolutely forgot the Grosville\ndrawing-room, the staring Grosville girls, the other faces, astonished\nor severe, neutral or friendly. Out rolled the tide of tragic verse,\nfine poetry, and high passion; and though it be not very much to say, it\nmust at least be said that never had such recitation, in such French,\nbeen heard before within the walls of Grosville Park. Nor had the lips\nof any English girl ever dealt there with a poetic diction so\nunchastened and unashamed. Lady Grosville might well feel as though the\nsolid frame of things were melting and cracking round her.\n\nKitty ceased. She fell back upon her chair, smitten with a sudden\nperception.\n\n\"You made me!\" she said, reproachfully, to the Dean.\n\nThe Dean said another \"Brava!\" and gave another clap. Then, becoming\naware of Lord Grosville's open mouth and eye, he sat up, caught his\nwife's expression, and came back to prose and the present.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" he began, \"you have the most extraordinary\ntalent--\" when Lady Grosville advanced upon him. Standing before him,\nshe majestically signalled to her husband across his small person.\n\n\"William, kindly order Mrs. Wilson's carriage.\"\n\nLord Grosville awoke from his stupor with a jerk, and did as he was\ntold. Mrs. Wilson, the agent's timid wife, who was not at all aware that\nshe had asked for her carriage, rose obediently. Then the mistress of\nthe house turned to Lady Kitty.\n\n\"You recite very well, Kitty,\" she said, with cold and stately emphasis,\n\"but another time I will ask you to confine yourself to Racine and\nCorneille. In England we have to be very careful about French writers.\nThere are, however, if I remember right, some fine passages in\n'Athalie.'\"\n\nKitty said nothing. The Austrian attach\u00c3\u00a9 who had been following the\nlittle incident with the liveliest interest, retired to a close\ninspection of the china. But the Dean, whose temper was of the quick and\nchivalrous kind, was roused.\n\n\"She recites wonderfully! And Victor Hugo is a classic, please, my\nlady--just as much as the rest of them. Ah, well, no doubt, no doubt,\nthere might be things more suitable.\" And the old man came wavering down\nto earth, as the enthusiasm which Kitty had breathed into him escaped,\nlike the gas from a balloon. \"But, do you know, Lady Kitty \"--he struck\ninto a new subject with eagerness, partly to cover the girl, partly to\nsilence Lady Grosville--\"you reminded me all the time so remarkably--in\nyour voice--certain inflections--of your sister--your step-sister, isn't\nit?--Lady Alice? You know, of course, she is close to you to-day--just\nthe other side the park--with the Sowerbys?\"\n\nThe Dean's wife sprang to her feet in despair. In general it was to her\na matter for fond complacency that her husband had no memory for gossip,\nand was in such matters as innocent and as dangerous as a child. But\nthis was too much. At the same moment Ashe came quickly forward.\n\n\"My sister?\" said Kitty. \"My sister?\"\n\nShe spoke low and uncertainly, her eyes fixed upon the Dean.\n\nHe looked at her with a sudden odd sense of something unusual, then went\non, still floundering:\n\n\"We met her at St. Pancras on our way down. If I had only known we were\nto have had the pleasure of meeting you--Do you know, I think she is\nlooking decidedly better?\"\n\nHis kindly expression as he rose expected a word of sisterly assent.\nMeanwhile even Lady Grosville was paralyzed, and the words with which\nshe had meant to interpose failed on her lips.\n\nKitty, too, rose, looking round for something, which she seemed to find\nin the face of William Ashe, for her eyes clung there.\n\n\"My sister,\" she repeated, in the same low, strained voice. \"My sister\nAlice? I--I don't know. I have never seen her.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAshe could not remember afterwards precisely how the incident closed.\nThere was a bustle of departing guests, and from the midst of it Lady\nKitty slipped away. But as he came down-stairs in smoking trim, ten\nminutes later, he overheard the injured Dean wrestling with his wife, as\nshe lit a candle for him on the landing.\n\n\"My dear, what did you look at me like that for? What did the child\nmean? And what on _earth_ is the matter?\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAfter the ladies had gone to bed, on the night of Lady Kitty's\nrecitation, William Ashe stayed up till past midnight talking with old\nLord Grosville. When relieved of the presence of his women-kind, who\nwere apt either to oppress him, in the person of his wife, or to puzzle\nhim, in the persons of his daughters, Lord Grosville was not by any\nmeans without value as a talker. He possessed that narrow but still most\nserviceable fund of human experience which the English land-owner, while\nour English tradition subsists, can hardly escape, if he will. As\nguardsman, volunteer, magistrate, lord-lieutenant, member--for the sake\nof his name and his acres--of various important commissions, as military\n_attach\u00c3\u00a9_ even, for a short space, to an important embassy, he had\nacquired, by mere living, that for which his intellectual betters had\noften envied him--a certain shrewdness, a certain instinct, as to both\nmen and affairs, which were often of more service to him than finer\nbrains to other persons. But, like most accomplishments, these also\nbrought their own conceit with them. Lord Grosville having, in his own\nopinion, done extremely well without much book education himself, had\nbut little appreciation for it in others.\n\nNevertheless he rarely missed a chance of conversation with William\nAshe, not because the younger man, in spite of his past indolence, was\ngenerally held to be both able and accomplished, but because the elder\nfound in him an invincible taste for men and women, their fortunes,\noddities, catastrophes--especially the latter--similar to his own.\n\nLike Mary Lyster, both were good gossips; but of a much more\ndisinterested type than she. Women indeed as gossips are too apt to\npursue either the damnation of some one else or the apotheosis of\nthemselves. But here the stupider no less than the abler man showed a\ncertain broad detachment not very common in women--amused by the human\ncomedy itself, making no profit out of it, either for themselves or\nmorals, but asking only that the play should go on.\n\nThe incident, or rather the heroine of the evening, had given Lord\nGrosville a topic which in the case of William Ashe he saw no reason for\navoiding; and in the peace of the smoking-room, when he was no longer\neither hungry for his dinner or worried by his responsibilities as host,\nhe fell upon his wife's family, and, as though he had been the manager\nof a puppet-show, unpacked the whole box of them for Ashe's\nentertainment.\n\nFigure after figure emerged, one more besmirched than another, till\nfinally the most beflecked of all was shaken out and displayed--Lady\nGrosville's brother and Kitty's father, the late Lord Blackwater. And on\nthis occasion Ashe did not try to escape the story which was thus a\nsecond time brought across him. Lord Grosville, if he pleased, had a\nright to tell it, and there was now a curious feeling in Ashe's mind\nwhich had been entirely absent before, that he had, in some sort, a\nright to hear it.\n\nBriefly, the outlines of it fell into something like this shape: Henry,\nfifth Earl of Blackwater, had begun life as an Irish peer, with more\nmoney than the majority of his class; an initial advantage soon undone\nby an insane and unscrupulous extravagance. He was, however, a fine,\nhandsome, voracious gentleman, born to prey upon his kind, and when he\nlooked for an heiress he was not long in finding her. His first wife, a\nvery rich woman, bore him one daughter. Before the daughter was three\nyears old, Lord Blackwater had developed a sturdy hatred of the mother,\nchiefly because she failed to present him with a son; and he could not\neven appease himself by the free spending of her money, which, so far as\nthe capital was concerned, was sharply looked after by a pair of\ntrustees, Belfast manufacturers and Presbyterians, to whom the\nBlackwater type was not at all congenial.\n\nThese restrictions presently wore out Lord Blackwater's patience. He\nleft his wife, with a small allowance, to bring up her daughter in one\nof his Irish houses, while he generously spent the rest of her large\nincome, and his own, and a great deal besides, in London and on the\nContinent.\n\nLady Blackwater, however, was not long before she obliged him by dying.\nHer girl, then twelve years old, lived for a time with one of her\nmother's trustees. But when she had reached the age of seventeen her\nfather suddenly commanded her presence in Paris, that she might make\nacquaintance with his second wife.\n\nThe new Lady Blackwater was an extremely beautiful woman, Irish, as the\nfirst had been, but like her in no other respect. Margaret Fitzgerald\nwas the daughter of a cosmopolitan pair, who after many shifts for a\nliving, had settled in Paris, where the father acted as correspondent\nfor various English papers. Her beauty, her caprices, and her \"affairs\"\nwere all well known in Paris. As to what the relations between her and\nLord Blackwater might have been before the death of the wife, Lord\nGrosville took a frankly uncharitable view. But when that event\noccurred, Blackwater was beginning to get old, and Miss Fitzgerald had\nbecome necessary to him. She pressed all her advantages, and it ended in\nhis marrying her. The new Lady Blackwater presented him with one child,\na daughter; and about two years after its birth he sent for his elder\ndaughter, Lady Alice, to join them in the sumptuous apartment in the\nPlace Vend\u00c3\u00b4me which he had furnished for his new wife, in defiance both\nof his English and Irish creditors.\n\nLady Alice arrived--a fair slip of a girl, possessed, it was plain to\nsee, by a nervous terror both of her father and step-mother. But Lady\nBlackwater received her with effusion, caressed her in public, dressed\nher to perfection, and made all possible use of the girl's presence in\nthe house for the advancement of her own social position. Within a year\nthe Belfast trustees, watching uneasily from a distance, received a\nletter from Lord Blackwater, announcing Lady Alice's runaway marriage\nwith a certain Colonel Wensleydale, formerly of the Grenadier Guards.\nLord Blackwater professed himself vastly annoyed and displeased. The\nyoung people, furiously in love, had managed the affair, however, with a\nskill that baffled all vigilance. Married they were, and without any\nsettlements, Colonel Wensleydale having nothing to settle, and Lady\nAlice, like a little fool, being only anxious to pour all that she\npossessed into the lap of her beloved. The father threw himself on the\nmercy of the trustees, reminding them that in little more than three\nyears Lady Alice would become unfettered mistress of her own fortune,\nand begging them meanwhile to make proper provision for the rash but\nhappy pair. Harry Wensleydale, after all, was a rattling good fellow,\nwith whom all the young women were in love. The thing, though naughty,\nwas natural; and the colonel would make an excellent husband.\n\nOne Presbyterian trustee left his business in Belfast and ventured\nhimself among the abominations of Paris. He was much befooled and\nbefeasted. He found a shy young wife tremulously in love; a handsome\nhusband; an amiable step-mother. He knew no one in Paris who could\nenlighten him, and was not clever enough to invent means of getting\ninformation for himself. He was induced to promise a sufficient income\nfor the moment on behalf of himself and his co-trustee; and for the rest\nwas obliged to be content with vague assurances from Colonel Wensleydale\nthat as soon as his wife came into her property fitting settlements\nshould be made.\n\nFour years passed by. The young people lived with the Blackwaters, and\ntheir income kept the establishment going. Lady Alice had a child, and\nwas at first not altogether unhappy. She was little more than a timid\nchild herself; and no doubt, to begin with, she was in love. Then came\nher majority. In defiance of all her trustees, she gave her whole\nfortune to her husband, and no power could prevent her from so doing.\n\nThe Blackwater m\u00c3\u00a9nage blazed up into a sudden splendor. Lady\nBlackwater's carriage and Lady Blackwater's jewels had never been finer;\nand amid the crowds who frequented the house, the slight figure, the\nsallow face, and absent eyes of her step-daughter attracted little\nremark. Lady Alice Wensleydale was said to be delicate and reserved; she\nmade no friends, explained herself to no one; and it was supposed that\nshe occupied herself with her little boy.\n\nThen one December she disappeared from the apartment in the Place\nVend\u00c3\u00b4me. It was said that she and the boy found the climate of Paris too\ncold in winter, and had gone for a time to Italy. Colonel Wensleydale\ncontinued to live with the Blackwaters, and their apartment was no less\nsumptuous, their dinners no less talked of, their extravagance no less\nnoisy than before. But Lady Alice did not come back with the spring; and\nsome ugly rumors began to creep about. They were checked, however, by\nthe death of Lord Blackwater, which occurred within a year of his\ndaughter's departure; by the monstrous debts he left behind him; and by\nthe sale of the contents of the famous apartment, matters, all of them,\nsufficiently ugly or scandalous in themselves to keep the tongues of\nfame busy. Lady Blackwater left Paris, and when she reappeared, it was\nin Rome as the Comtesse d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, the wife of yet another old man,\nwhose health obliged them to winter in the south and to spend the summer\nin yachting. Her _salon_ in Rome under Pio Nono became a great\nrendezvous for English and Americans, attracted by the historic names\nand titles that M. d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' connections among the Black nobility, his\nwealth, and his interest in several of the Catholic banking-houses of\nRome and Naples enabled his wife to command.\n\nColonel Wensleydale did not appear. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es let it be\nunderstood that her step-daughter was of a difficult temper, and now\nspent most of her time in Ireland. Her own daughter, her \"darling\nKitty,\" was being educated in Paris by the Soeurs Blanches, and she\npined for the day when the \"little sweet\" should join her, ready to\nspread her wings in the great world. But mothers must not be impatient,\nKitty must have all the advantages that befitted her rank; and to what\nbetter hands could the most anxious mother intrust her than to those\ncharming, aristocratic, accomplished nuns of the Soeurs Blanches?\n\nThen one January day M. d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es drove out to San Paolo fuori le Mura,\nand caught a blast from the snowy Sabines coming back. In three days he\nwas dead, and his well-provided widow had snatched the bulk of his\nfortune from the hands of his needy and embittered kindred.\n\nWithin six months of his death she had bought a house in St. James's\nPlace, and her London career had begun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is here that we come in,\" said Lord Grosville, when, with more\ndigressions and more plainness of speech with regard to his quondam\nsister-in-law than can be here reproduced, he had brought his story to\nthis point. \"Blackwater--the old ruffian--when he was dying had a moment\nof remorse. He wrote to my wife and asked her to look after his girls,\n'For God's sake, Lina, see if you can help Alice--Wensleydale's a\nperfect brute.' That was the first light we had on the situation, for\nAdelina had long before washed her hands of him; and we knew that _she_\nhated us. Well, we tried; of course we tried. But so long as her\nhusband lived Alice would have nothing to say to any of us. I suppose\nshe thought that for her boy's sake she'd better keep a bad business to\nherself as much as possible--\"\n\n\"Wensleydale--Wensleydale?\" said Ashe, who had been smoking hard and\nsilently beside his host. \"You mean the man who distinguished himself in\nthe Crimea? He died last year--at Naples, wasn't it?\"\n\nLord Grosville assented.\n\nIt appeared that during the last year of his life Lady Alice had nursed\nher husband faithfully through disease and poverty; for scarcely a\nvestige of her fortune remained, and an application for money made by\nWensleydale to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, unknown to his wife, had been\nperemptorily refused. The colonel died, and within three months of his\ndeath Lady Alice had also lost her son and only child, of\nblood-poisoning developed in Naples, whither he had been summoned from\nschool that his father might see him for the last time.\n\nThen, after seventeen years, Lady Alice came back to her kindred, who\nhad last seen her as a young girl--gentle, undeveloped, easily led, and\nrather stupid. She returned a gray-haired woman of thirty-four, who had\nlost youth, fortune, child, and husband; whose aspect, moreover,\nsuggested losses still deeper and more drear. At first she wrapped\nherself in what seemed to some a dull and to others a tragic silence.\nBut suddenly a flame leaped up in her. She became aware of the position\nof Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es in London; and one day, at a private view of the\nAcademy, her former step-mother went up to her smiling, with\nout-stretched hand. Lady Alice turned very pale; the hand dropped, and\nAlice Wensleydale walked rapidly away. But that night, in the Grosville\nhouse, she spoke out.\n\n\"She told Lina and myself the whole story. You'd have thought the woman\nwas possessed. My wife--she's not of the crying sort, nor am I. But she\ncried, and I believe--well, I can tell you it was enough to move a\nstone. And when she'd done, she just went away, and locked her door, and\nlet no one say a word to her. She has told one or two other relations\nand friends, and--\"\n\n\"And the relations and friends have told others?\"\n\n\"Well, I can answer for myself,\" said Grosville after a pause. \"This\nhappened three months ago. I never have told, and never shall tell, all\nthe details as she told them to us. But we have let enough be known--\"\n\n\"Enough?--enough to damn Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, as far as the women were concerned, she was mostly that\nalready. There are other tales going about. I expect you know them.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know them,\" said Ashe.\n\nLord Grosville's face expressed surprise. \"Well, this finished it,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said Ashe, slowly, putting down his cigarette and turning\na thoughtful look on the carpet.\n\n\"Alice?\" said Lord Grosville.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh! you mean Kitty? Yes, I had forgotten her for the moment. Yes, poor\nchild.\"\n\nThere was silence a moment, then Lord Grosville inquired:\n\n\"What do you think of her?\"\n\n\"I?\" said Ashe, with a laugh. \"I don't know. She's obviously very\npretty--\"\n\n\"And a handful!\" said Lord Grosville.\n\n\"Oh, quite plainly a handful,\" said Ashe, rather absently. Then the\nmemory of Kitty's entry recurred to them both, and they laughed.\n\n\"Not much shyness left in that young woman--eh?\" said the old man. \"She\ntells my girls such stories of her French doings--my wife's had to stop\nit. She seems to have had all sorts of love-affairs already. And, of\ncourse, she'll have any number over here--sure to. Some unscrupulous\nfellow'll get hold of her, for naturally the right sort won't marry her.\nI don't know what we can do. Adelina offered to take her altogether. But\nthat woman wouldn't hear of it. She wrote Lina rather a good letter--on\nher dignity--and that kind of thing. We gave her an opening, and, by\nJove! she took it.\"\n\n\"And meanwhile Lady Kitty has no dealings with her step-sister?\"\n\n\"You heard what she said. Extraordinary girl! to let the thing out plump\nlike that. Just like the blood. They say anything that comes into their\nheads. If we had known that Alice was to be with the Sowerbys this\nweek-end, my wife would certainly have put Kitty off. It would be\nuncommonly awkward if they were to meet--here for instance. Hullo! Is it\ngetting late?\"\n\nFor the whist-players at the end of the library had pushed back their\nchairs, and men were strolling back from the billiard-room.\n\n\"I am afraid Lady Kitty understands there is something wrong with her\nmother's position,\" said Ashe, as they rose.\n\n\"I dare say. Brought up in Paris, you see,\" said the white-haired\nEnglishman, with a shrug. \"Of course, she knows everything she\nshouldn't.\"\n\n\"Brought up in a convent, please,\" said Ashe, smiling. \"And I thought\nthe French _girl_ was the most innocent and ignorant thing alive.\"\n\nLord Grosville received the remark with derision.\n\n\"You ask my wife what she thinks about French convents. She knows--she's\nhad lots of Catholic relations. She'll tell you tales.\"\n\nAshe thought, however, that he could trust himself to see that she did\nnothing of the sort.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe smoking-room broke up late, but the new Under-secretary sat up still\nlater, reading and smoking in his bedroom. A box of Foreign Office\npapers lay on his table. He went through them with a keen sense of\npleasure, enjoying his new work and his own competence to do it, of\nwhich, notwithstanding his remarks to Mary Lyster, he was not really at\nall in doubt. Then when his comments were done, and the papers replaced\nin the order in which they would now go up to the Secretary of State, he\nfelt the spring night oppressively mild, and walking to the window, he\nthrew it wide open.\n\nHe looked out upon a Dutch garden, full of spring flowers in bloom. In\nthe midst was a small fountain, which murmured to itself through the\nnight. An orangery or conservatory, of a charming eighteenth-century\ndesign, ran round the garden in a semicircle, its flat pilasters and\nmouldings of yellow stone taking under the moonlight the color and the\ndelicacy of ivory. Beyond the terrace which bordered the garden, the\nground fell to a river, of which the reaches, now dazzling, now sombre,\nnow slipping secret under woods, and now silverly open to the gentle\nslopes of the park, brought wildness and romance into a scene that had\nelse been tame. Beyond the river on a rising ground was a village church\nwith a spire. The formal garden, the Georgian conservatory, the park,\nthe river, the church--they breathed England and the traditional English\nlife. All that they implied, of custom and inheritance, of strength and\nnarrowness, of cramping prejudice and stubborn force, was very familiar\nto Ashe, and on the whole very congenial. He was glad to be an\nEnglishman and a member of an English government. The ironic mood which\nwas tolerably constant in him did not in the least interfere with his\nnormal enjoyment of normal goods. He saw himself often as a shade among\nshadows, as an actor among actors; but the play was good all the same.\nThat a man should know himself to be a fool was in his eyes, as it was\nin Lord Melbourne's, the first of necessities. But fool or no fool, let\nhim find the occupations that suited him, and pursue them. On those\nterms life was still amply worth living, and ginger was still hot in the\nmouth.\n\nThis was his usual philosophy. Religiously he was a sceptic, enormously\ninterested in religion. Should he ever become Prime Minister, as Lady\nTranmore prophesied, he would know much more theology than the bishops\nhe might be called on to appoint. Politically, at the same time, he was\nan aristocrat, enormously interested in liberty. The absurdities of his\nown class were still more plain to him perhaps than the absurdities of\nthe populace. But had he lived a couple of generations earlier he would\nhave gone with passion for Catholic emancipation, and boggled at the\nReform Bill. And if fate had thrown him on earlier days still, he would\nnot, like Falkland, have died ingeminating peace; he would have fought;\nbut on which side, no friend of his--up till now--could have been quite\nsure. To have the reputation of an idler, and to be in truth a plodding\nand unwearied student; this, at any rate, pleased him. To avow an\nenthusiasm, or an affection, generally seemed to him an indelicacy; only\ntwo or three people in the world knew what was the real quality of his\nheart. Yet no man feigns shirking without in some measure learning to\nshirk; and there were certain true indolences and sybaritisms in Ashe of\nwhich he was fully and contemptuously aware, without either wishing or\nfeeling himself able to break the yoke of them.\n\nAt the present moment, however, he was rather conscious of much unusual\nstirring and exaltation of personality. As he stood looking out into the\nEnglish night the currents of his blood ran free and fast. Never had he\nfelt the natural appetite for living so strong in him, combined with\nwhat seemed to be at once a divination of coming change, and a thirst\nfor it. Was it the mere advancement of his fortunes--or something\ninfinitely subtler and sweeter? It was as though waves of softness and\nof yearning welled up from some unknown source, seeking an object and an\noutlet.\n\nAs he stood there dreaming, he suddenly became conscious of sounds in\nthe room overhead. Or rather in the now absolute stillness of the rest\nof the house he realized that the movements and voices above him, which\nhad really been going on since he entered his room, persisted when\neverything else had died away.\n\nTwo people were talking; or rather one voice ran on perpetually, broken\nat intervals by the other. He began to suspect to whom the voice\nbelonged; and as he did so, the window above his own was thrown open. He\nstepped back involuntarily, but not before he had caught a few words in\nFrench, spoken apparently by Lady Kitty.\n\n\"Ciel! what a night!--and how the flowers smell! And the stars--I adore\nthe stars! Mademoiselle--come here! Mademoiselle! answer me--I won't\ntell tales--now do you--_really and truly_--believe in God?\"\n\nA laugh, which was a laugh of pleasure, ran through Ashe, as he\nhurriedly put out his lights.\n\n\"Tormentor!\" he said to himself--\"must you put a woman through her\ntheological paces at this time of night? Can't you go to sleep, you\nlittle whirlwind?--What's to be done? If I shut my window the noise will\nscare her. But I can't stand eavesdropping here.\"\n\nHe withdrew softly from the window and began to undress. But Lady Kitty\nwas leaning out, and her voice carried amazingly. Heard in this way\nalso, apart from form and face, it became a separate living thing. Ashe\nstood arrested, his watch that he was winding up in his hand. He had\nknown the voice till now as something sharp and light, the sign surely\nof a chatterer and a flirt. To-night, as Kitty made use of it to expound\nher own peculiar theology to the French governess--whereof a few\nfragments now and then floated down to Ashe--nothing could have been\nmore musical, melancholy, caressing. A voice full of sex, and the spell\nof sex.\n\nWhat had she been talking of all these hours to mademoiselle? A lady\nwhom she could never have set eyes on before this visit. He thought of\nher face, in the drawing-room, as she had spoken of her sister--of her\neyes, so full of a bright feverish pain, which had hung upon his own.\n\nHad she, indeed, been confiding all her home secrets to this stranger?\nAshe felt a movement of distaste, almost of disgust. Yet he remembered\nthat it was by her unconventionality, her lack of all proper reticence,\nor, as many would have said, all delicate feeling, that she had made her\nfirst impression upon him. Ay, that had been an impression--an\nimpression indeed! He realized the fact profoundly, as he stood\nlingering in the darkness, trying not to hear the voice that thrilled\nhim.\n\nAt last!--was she going to bed?\n\n\"Ah!--but I am a pig, to keep you up like this! Allez dormir!\" (The\nsound of a kiss.) \"I? Oh no! Why should one go to bed? It is in the\nnight one begins to live.\"\n\nShe fell to humming a little French tune, then broke off.\n\n\"You remember? You promise? You have the letter?\"\n\nAsseverations apparently from mademoiselle, and a mention of eight\no'clock, followed by remorse from Kitty.\n\n\"Eight o'clock! And I keep you like this. I am a brute beast!\nAllez--allez vite!\" And quick steps scudded across the floor above,\nfollowed by the shutting of a door.\n\nKitty, however, came back to the window, and Ashe could still hear her\nsighing and talking to herself.\n\nWhat had she been plotting? A letter? Conveyed by mademoiselle? To whom?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLong after all sounds above had ceased Ashe still lay awake, thinking of\nthe story he had heard from Lord Grosville. Certainly, if he had known\nit, he would never have gone familiarly to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' house.\nLaxity, for a man of his type, is one thing; lying, meanness, and\ncruelty are another. What could be done for this poor child in her\nstrange and sinister position? He was ironically conscious of a sudden\nheat of missionary zeal. For if the creature to be saved had not\npossessed such a pair of eyes--so slim a neck--such a haunting and\nteasing personality--what then?\n\nThe question presently plunged with him into sleep. But he had not\nforgotten it when he awoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had just finished dressing next morning, when he chanced to see from\nthe front window of his room, which commanded the main stretch of the\npark, the figure of a lady on one of the paths. She seemed to be\nreturning from the farther end of a long avenue, and was evidently\nhurrying to reach the house. As she approached, however, she turned\naside into a shrubbery walk and was soon lost to view. But Ashe had\nrecognized Mademoiselle D. The matter of the letter recurred to him. He\nguessed that she had already delivered it. But where?\n\nAt breakfast Lady Kitty did not appear. Ashe made inquiries of the\nyounger Miss Grosville, who replied with some tartness that she supposed\nKitty had a cold, and hurried off herself to dress for Sunday-school. It\nwas not at all the custom for young ladies to breakfast in bed on\nSundays at Grosville Park, and Lady Grosville's brow was clouded. Ashe\nfelt it a positive effort to tell her that he was not going to church,\nand when she had marshalled her flock and carried them off, those left\nbehind knew themselves, indeed, as heathens and publicans.\n\nAshe wandered out with some official papers and a pipe into the spring\nsunshine. Mr. Kershaw, the editor, would gladly have caught him for a\npolitical talk. But Ashe would not be caught. As to the interests of\nEngland in the Persian Gulf, both they and Mr. Kershaw might for the\nmoment go hang. Would Lady Kitty meet him in the old garden at\neleven-thirty, or would she not? That was the only thing that mattered.\n\nHowever, it was still more than an hour to the time mentioned. Ashe\nspent a while in roaming a wood delicately pied with primroses and\nanemones, and then sauntered back into the gardens, which were old and\nfamous.\n\nSuddenly, as he came upon a terrace bordered by a thick yew hedge, and\ndescending by steps to a lower terrace, he became aware of voices in a\nstrange tone and key--not loud, but, as it were, intensified far beyond\nthe note of ordinary talk. Ashe stood still; for he had recognized the\nvoice of Lady Kitty. But before he had made up his mind what to do a\nlady began to ascend the steps which connected the upper terrace with\nthe lower. She came straight towards him, and Ashe looked at her with\nastonishment. She was not a member of the Grosville house party, and\nAshe had never seen her before. Yet in her pale, unhappy face there was\nsomething that recalled another person; something, too, in her gait and\nher passionate energy of movement. She swept past him, and he saw that\nshe was tall and thin, and dressed in deep mourning. Her eyes were set\non some inner vision; he felt that she scarcely saw him. She passed like\nan embodied grief--menacing and lamentable.\n\nSomething like a cry pursued her up the steps. But she did not turn. She\nwalked swiftly on, and was soon lost to sight in the trees.\n\nAshe hesitated a moment, then hurried down the steps.\n\nOn a stone seat beneath the yew hedge, Kitty Bristol lay prone. He heard\nher sobs, and they went most strangely through his heart.\n\n\"Lady Kitty!\" he said, as he stood beside her and bent over her.\n\nShe looked up, and showed no surprise. Her face was bathed in tears, but\nher hand sought his piteously and drew him towards her.\n\n\"I have seen my sister,\" she said, \"and she hates me. What have I done?\nI think I shall die of despair!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe effect of the few sobbing words, with which Kitty Bristol had\ngreeted his presence beside her, upon the feeling of William Ashe was\nboth sharp and deep, for they seemed already to imply a peculiar\nrelation, a special link between them. Had it not, indeed, begun in that\nvery moment at St. James's Place when he had first caught sight of her,\nsitting forlorn in her white dress?--when she had \"willed\" him to come\nto her, and he came? Surely--though as to this he had his qualms--she\ncould not have spoken with this abandonment to any other of her new\nEnglish acquaintances? To Darrell, for instance, who was expected at\nGrosville Park that evening. No! From the beginning she had turned to\nhim, William Ashe; she had been conscious of the same mutual\nunderstanding, the same sympathy in difference that he himself felt.\n\nIt was, at any rate, with the feeling of one whose fate has most\nstrangely, most unexpectedly overtaken him that he sat down beside her.\nHis own pulses were running at a great rate; but there was to be no sign\nof it for her. He tried, indeed, to calm her by that mere cheerful\nstrength and vitality of which he was so easily master. \"Why should you\nbe in despair?\" he said, bending towards her. \"Tell me. Let me try and\nhelp you. Was your sister unkind to you?\"\n\nKitty made no reply at once. The tears that brimmed her large eyes\nslipped down her cheeks without disfiguring her. She was looking\nabsently, intently, into a dark depth of wood as though she sought there\nfor some truth that escaped her--truth of the past or of the present.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, at last, shaking her head, \"I don't know\nwhether it was unkind. Perhaps it was only what we deserve, maman and\nI.\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Ashe.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, passionately. \"Who's going to separate between maman\nand me? If she's done mean, shocking things, the people she's done them\nto will hate me too. They _shall_ hate me! It's right.\"\n\nShe turned to him violently. She was very white, and her little hands as\nshe sat there before him, proudly erect, twisted a lace handkerchief\nbetween them that would soon be in tatters. Somehow Ashe winced before\nthe wreck of the handkerchief; what need to ruin the pretty, fragile\nthing?\n\n\"I am quite sure no one will ever hate you for what you haven't done,\"\nhe said, steadily. \"That would be abominably unfair. But, you see, I\ndon't understand--and I don't like--I don't wish--to ask questions.\"\n\n\"_Do_ ask questions!\" she cried, looking at him almost reproachfully.\n\"That's just what I want you to do--Only,\" she added, hanging her head\nin depression, \"I shouldn't know what to answer. I am played with, and\ntreated as a baby! There is something horrible the matter--and no one\ntrusts me--every one keeps me in the dark. No one ever thinks whether I\nam miserable or not.\"\n\nShe raised her hands to her eyes and vehemently wiped away her tears\nwith the tattered lace handkerchief. In all these words and actions,\nhowever, she was graceful and touching, because she was natural. She was\nnot posing or conscious, she was hiding nothing. Yet Ashe felt certain\nshe could act a part magnificently; only it would not be for the lie's\nsake, but for the sake of some romantic impulse or imagination.\n\n\"Why should you torment yourself so?\" he asked her, kindly. Her hand had\ndropped and lay beside her on the bench. To his own amazement he found\nhimself clasping it. \"Isn't it better to forget old griefs? You can't\nhelp what happened years ago--you can't undo it. You've got to live your\nown life--_happily_! And I just wish you'd set about it.\"\n\nHe smiled at her, and there were few faces more attractive than his when\nhe let his natural softness have its way, without irony. She let her\neyes be drawn to his, and as they met he saw a flush rise in her clear\nskin and spread to the pale gold of her hair. The man in him was\nmarvellously pleased by that flush--fascinated, indeed. But she gave him\nsmall time to observe it; she drew herself impatiently away.\n\n\"Of course, you don't understand a word about it,\" she said, \"or you\ncouldn't talk like that. But I'll tell you.\" Her eyes, half miserable,\nhalf audacious, returned to him. \"My sister--came here--because I sent\nfor her. I made mademoiselle go with a letter. Of course, I knew there\nwas a mystery--I knew the Grosvilles did not want us to meet--I knew\nthat she and maman hated each other. But maman will tell me nothing--and\nI have a _right_ to know.\"\n\n\"No, you have no right to know,\" said Ashe, gravely.\n\nShe looked at him wildly.\n\n\"I have--I have!\" she repeated, passionately. \"Well, I told my sister to\nmeet me here--I had forgotten, you see, all about you! My mind was so\nfull of Alice. And when she came I felt as if it was a dream--a\nhorrible, tragic dream. You know--she is _so_ like me--which means, I\nsuppose, that we are both like papa. Only her face--it's not handsome,\noh no--but it's stern--and--yes, noble! I was proud of her. I would like\nto have gone on my knee and kissed her dress. But she would not take my\nhand--she would hardly speak to me. She said she had come, because it\nwas best, now that I was in England, that we should meet once, and\nunderstand that we _couldn't_ meet--that we could never, never be\nfriends. She said that she hated my mother--that for years she had kept\nsilence, but that now she meant to punish maman--to drive her from\nLondon. And then\"--the girl's lips trembled under the memory--\"she came\nclose to me, and she looked into my eyes, and she said, 'Yes, we're like\neach other---we're like our father--and it would be better for us both\nif we had never been born--'\"\n\n\"Ah, cruel!\" cried Ashe, involuntarily, and once more his hand found\nKitty's small fingers and pressed them in his.\n\nKitty looked at him with a strange, exalted look.\n\n\"No. I think it's true. I often think I'm not made to be happy. I can't\never be happy--it's not in me.\"\n\n\"It's in you to say foolish things then!\" said Ashe, lightly, and\ncrossing his arms he tried to assume the practical elder-brotherly air,\nwhich he felt befitted the situation--if anything befitted it. For in\ntruth it seemed to him one singularly confused and ugly. Their talk\nfloated above tragic depths, guessed at by him, wholly unknown to her.\nAnd yet her youth shrank from it knew not what--\"as an animal shrinks\nfrom shadows in the twilight.\" She seemed to him to sit enwrapped in a\nvague cloud of shame, resenting and hating it, yet not able to escape\nfrom thinking and talking of it. But she must not talk of it.\n\nShe did not answer his last remark for a little while. She sat looking\nbefore her, overwhelmed, it seemed, by an inward rush of images and\nsensations. Till, with a sudden movement, she turned to him and said,\nsmiling, quite in her ordinary voice:\n\n\"Do you know why I shall never be happy? It is because I have such a bad\ntemper.\"\n\n\"Have you?\" said Ashe, smiling.\n\nShe gave him a curious look.\n\n\"You don't believe it? If you had been in the convent, you would have\nbelieved it. I'm mad sometimes--quite mad; with pride, I suppose, and\nvanity. The Soeurs said it was that.\"\n\n\"They had to explain it somehow,\" said Ashe. \"But I am quite sure that\nif I lived in a convent I should have a furious temper.\"\n\n\"You!\" she said, half contemptuously. \"You couldn't be ill-tempered\nanywhere. That's the one thing I don't like about you--you're too\ncalm--too--too satisfied. It's--Well! you said a sharp thing to me, so I\ndon't see why I shouldn't say one to you. You shouldn't look as though\nyou enjoyed your life so much. It's _bourgeois_! It is, indeed.\" And she\nfrowned upon him with a little extravagant air that amused him.\n\nBy some prescience, she had put on that morning a black dress of thin\nmaterial, made with extreme simplicity. No flounces, no fanfaronnade. A\nlittle girlish dress, that made the girlish figure seem even frailer and\nlighter than he remembered it the night before in the splendors of her\nParis gown. Her large black hat emphasized the whiteness of her brow,\nthe brilliance of her most beautiful eyes; and then all the rest was\ninsubstantial sprite and airy nothing, to be crushed in one hand. And\nyet what untamed, indomitable things breathed from it--a self surely\nmore self, more intensely, obstinately alive than any he had yet known.\n\nHer attack had brought the involuntary blood to his cheeks, which\nannoyed him. But he invited her to say why cheerfulness was a vice. She\nreplied that no one should look success--as much as he did.\n\n\"And you scorn success?\"\n\n\"Scorn it!\" She drew a long breath, clasped both her hands above her\nhead, then slowly let the thin arms fall again. \"Scorn it! What\nnonsense! But everybody who hasn't got it hates those who have.\"\n\n\"Don't hate me!\" said Ashe, quickly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, with stubbornness, \"I must. Do you know why I was such\na wild-cat at school? Because some of the other girls were more\nimportant than I--much more important--and richer--and more\nbeautiful--and people paid them more attention. And that seemed to\n_burn_ the heart in me.\" She pressed her hands to her breast with a\npassionate gesture. \"You know the French word _panache_? Well, that's\nwhat I care for --that's what I _adore_! To be the first--the best--the\nmost distinguished. To be envied--and pointed at--obeyed when I lift my\nfinger--and then to come to some great, glorious, tragic end!\"\n\nAshe moved impatiently.\n\n\"Lady Kitty, I don't like to hear you talk like this. It's wild, and\nit's also--I beg your pardon--\"\n\n\"In bad taste?\" she said, catching him up breathlessly. \"That's what you\nmeant, isn't it? You said it to me before, when I called you handsome.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" he said, in vexation. She watched him throw himself back and\nfeel for his cigarette-case; a gesture of her hand gave him leave; she\nwaited, smiling, till he had taken a few calming whiffs. Then she gently\nmoved towards him.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me!\" she said, in a sweet, low voice. \"Don't you\nunderstand how hard it is--to have that nature--and then to come here\nout of the convent--where one had lived on dreams--and find one's\nself--\"\n\nShe turned her head away. Ashe put down his new-lit cigarette.\n\n\"Find yourself?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Everybody scorns me!\" she said, her brow drooping.\n\nAshe exclaimed.\n\n\"You know it's true. My mother is not received. Can you deny that?\"\n\n\"She has many friends,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"She is _not received_. When I speak of her no one answers me. Lady\nGrosville asked me here--_me_--out of charity. It would be thought a\ndisgrace to marry me--\"\n\n\"Look here, Lady Kitty!--\"\n\n\"And I\"--she wrung her small hands, as though she clasped the necks of\nher enemies--\"I would never _look_ at a man who did not think it the\nglory of his life to win me. So you see, I shall never marry. But then\nthe dreadful thing is--\"\n\nShe let him see a white, stormy face.\n\n\"That I have no loyalty to maman--I--I don't think I even love her.\"\n\nAshe surveyed her gravely.\n\n\"You don't mean that,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I do,\" she persisted. \"I had a horrid childhood. I won't tell\ntales; but, you see, I don't _know_ maman. I know the Soeurs much\nbetter. And then for some one you don't know--to have to--to have to\nbear--this horrible thing--\"\n\nShe buried her face in her hands. Ashe looked at her in perplexity.\n\n\"You sha'n't bear anything horrible,\" he said, with energy. \"There are\nplenty of people who will take care of that. Do you mind telling\nme--have there been special difficulties just lately?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, calmly, looking up, \"awful! Maman's debts\nare--well--ridiculous. For that alone I don't think she'll be able to\nstay in London--apart from--Alice.\"\n\nThe name recalled all she had just passed through, and her face\nquivered. \"What will she do?\" she said, under her breath. \"How will she\npunish us?--and why?--for what?\"\n\nHer dread, her ignorance, her fierce, bruised vanity, her struggling\npride, her helplessness, appealed amazingly to the man beside her. He\nbegan to talk to her very gently and wisely, begging her to let the past\nalone, to think only what could be done to help the present. In the\nfirst place, would she not let his mother be of use to her?\n\nHe could answer for Lady Tranmore. Why shouldn't Lady Kitty spend the\nsummer with her in Scotland? No doubt Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es would be abroad.\n\n\"Then I must go with her,\" said Kitty.\n\nAshe hesitated.\n\n\"Of course, if she wishes it.\"\n\n\"But I don't know that she will wish it. She is not very fond of me,\"\nsaid Kitty, doubtfully. \"Yes, I would like to stay with Lady Tranmore.\nBut will your cousin be there?\"\n\n\"Miss Lyster?\"\n\nKitty nodded.\n\n\"How can I tell? Of course, she is often there.\"\n\n\"It is quite curious,\" said Kitty, after reflection, \"how we dislike\neach other. And it is so odd. You know most people like me!\"\n\nShe looked up at him without a trace of coquetry, rather with a certain\ntimidity that feared possible rebuff. \"That's always been my\ndifficulty,\" she went on, \"till now. Everybody spoils me. I always get\nmy own way. In the convent I was indulged and flattered, and then they\nwondered that I made all sorts of follies. I want a guide--that's quite\ncertain--somebody to tell me what to do.\"\n\n\"I would offer myself for the post,\" said Ashe, \"but that I feel\nperfectly sure that you would never follow anybody's advice in\nanything.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would,\" she said, wistfully. \"I would--\"\n\nAshe's face changed.\n\n\"Ah, if you would--\"\n\nShe sprang up. \"Do you see \"--she pointed to some figures on a distant\npath--\"they are coming back from church. You understand?--_nobody_ must\nknow about my sister. It will come round to Aunt Lina, of course; but I\nhope it'll be when I'm gone. If she knew now, I should go back to London\nto-day.\"\n\nAshe made it clear to her that he would be discretion itself. They left\nthe bench, but, as they began to ascend the steps, Kitty turned back.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't seen her,\" she said, in a miserable tone, the tears\nflooding once more into her eyes.\n\nAshe looked at her with great kindness, but without speaking. The moment\nof sharp pain passed, and she moved on languidly beside him. But there\nwas an infection in his strong, handsome presence, and her smiles soon\ncame back. By the time they neared the house, indeed, she seemed to be\nin wild spirits again.\n\nDid he know, she asked him, that three more guests were coming that\nafternoon--Mr. Darrell, Mr. Louis Harman, _and_--Mr. Geoffrey Cliffe?\nShe laid an emphasis on the last name, which made Ashe say, carelessly:\n\n\"You want to meet him so much?\"\n\n\"Of course. Doesn't all the world?\"\n\nAshe replied that he could only answer for himself, and as far as he was\nconcerned he could do very well without Cliffe's company at all times.\n\nWhereupon Kitty protested with fire that other men were jealous of such\na famous person because women liked him--because--\n\n\"Because the man's a coxcomb and the women spoil him?\"\n\n\"A coxcomb!\"\n\nKitty was up in arms.\n\n\"Pray, is he not a great traveller?--_a very_ great traveller?\" she\nasked, with indignation.\n\n\"Certainly, by his own account.\"\n\n\"And a most brilliant writer?\"\n\n\"Macaulayese,\" said Ashe, perversely, \"and not very good at that.\"\n\nKitty was at first struck dumb, and then began a voluble protest against\nunfairness so monstrous. Did not all intelligent people read and admire?\nIt was mere jealousy, she repeated, to deny the gentleman's claims.\n\nAshe let her talk and quote and excite herself, applying every now and\nthen a little sly touch of the goad, to make her still run on, and so\nforget the tragic hour which had overshadowed her. And meanwhile all he\ncared for was to watch the flashing of her face and eyes, and the play\nof the wind in her hair, and the springing grace with which she moved.\nPoor child!--it all came back to that--poor child!--what was to be done\nwith her?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt luncheon--the Sunday luncheon--which still, at Grosville Park, as in\nthe early Victorian days of Lord Grosville's mother, consisted of a huge\nbaronial sirloin to which all else upon the varied table appeared as\nappurtenance and appendage, Ashe allowed himself the inward reflection\nthat the Grosville Park Sundays were degenerating. Both Lord and Lady\nGrosville had been good hosts in their day; and the downrightness of the\nwife had been as much to the taste of many as the agreeable gossip of\nthe husband. But on this occasion both were silent and absent-minded.\nLady Grosville showed no generalship in placing her guests; the wrong\npeople sat next to each other, and the whole party dragged--without a\nleader.\n\nAnd certainly Kitty Bristol did nothing to enliven it. She sat very\nsilent, her black dress changing her a good deal, to Ashe's thinking,\nbringing back, as he chose to fancy, the pale convent girl. Was it so\nthat she went through her pious exercises?--by-the-way, she was, of\ncourse, a Catholic?--said her lessons, and went to her confessor? Had\nthe French cousin with whom she rode stag-hunting ever seen her like\nthis? No; Ashe felt certain that \"Henri\" had never seen her, except as a\nfashion-plate, or _en amazone_. He could have made nothing of this ghost\nin black--this distinguished, piteous, little ghost.\n\nAfter luncheon it became tolerably clear to Ashe that Lady Grosville's\npreoccupation had a cause. And presently catching him alone in the\nlibrary, whither he had retired with some official papers, she closed\nthe door with deliberate care, and stood before him.\n\n\"I see you are interested in Kitty, and I feel as if I must tell you,\nand ask your opinion. William, do you know what that child has been\ndoing?\"\n\nHe looked up from his writing.\n\n\"Ah!--what have you been discovering?\"\n\n\"Grosville told you the story last night.\"\n\nAshe nodded.\n\n\"Well--Kitty wrote to Alice this morning--and they met. Alice has kept\nher room since--prostrate--so the Sowerbys tell me. I have just had a\nnote from Mrs. Sowerby. Wasn't it an extraordinary, an indelicate thing\nto do?\"\n\nAshe studied the frowning lady a moment--so large and daunting in her\nblack silk and white lace. She seemed to suggest all those aspects of\nthe English Sunday for which he had most secret dislike--its Pharisaism\nand dulness and heavy meals. He felt himself through and through Lady\nKitty's champion.\n\n\"I should have thought it very natural,\" was his reply.\n\nLady Grosville threw up her hands.\n\n\"Natural!--when she knows--\"\n\n\"How can she know?\" cried Ashe, hotly. \"How can such a child know or\nguess anything? She only knows that there is some black charge against\nher mother, on which no one will enlighten her. How can they? But\nmeanwhile her mother is ostracized, and she feels herself dragged into\nthe disgrace, not understanding why or wherefore. Could anything be more\npathetic--more touching?\"\n\nIn his heat of feeling he got up, and began to pace up and down. Lady\nGrosville's countenance expressed first astonishment--then wavering.\n\n\"Oh--of course, it's very sad,\" she said--\"extremely sad. But I should\nhave thought Kitty was clever enough to understand at least that Alice\nmust have some grave reason for breaking with her mother--\"\n\n\"Don't you all forget what a child she is,\" said Ashe, indignantly--\"not\nyet nineteen!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" said Lady Grosville, grudgingly. \"I must confess I\nfind it difficult to judge her fairly. She's so different from my own\ngirls.\"\n\nAshe hastily agreed. Then it struck him as odd that he should have\nfallen so quickly into this position of Kitty's defender with her\nfather's family; and he drew in his horns. He resumed his work, and Lady\nGrosville sat for a while, her hands in her lap, quietly observing him.\n\nAt last she said:\n\n\"So you think, William, I had better leave Kitty alone?\"\n\n\"About what?\" Ashe raised his curly head with a laugh. \"Don't put too\nmuch responsibility on me. I know nothing about young ladies.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I do--much,\" said Lady Grosville, candidly. \"My own\ndaughters are so exceptional.\"\n\nAshe held his peace. Distant cousins as they were, he hardly knew the\nGrosville girls apart, and had never yet grasped any reason why he\nshould.\n\n\"At any rate, I see clearly,\" said Lady Grosville, after another pause,\n\"that you're very sorry for Kitty. Of course, it's very nice of you, and\nI find it's what most people feel.\"\n\n\"Hang it! dear Lady Grosville, why shouldn't they?\" said Ashe, turning\nround on his chair. \"If ever there was a forlorn little person on earth,\nI thought Lady Kitty was that person at lunch to-day.\"\n\n\"And after that absurd exhibition last night!\" said Lady Grosville, with\na shrug. \"You never know where to have her. You think she looked ill?\"\n\n\"I am sure she has got a splitting headache,\" said Ashe, boldly. \"And\nwhy you and Grosville shouldn't be as sorry for her as for Lady Alice I\ncan't imagine. _She's_ done nothing.\"\n\n\"No, that's true,\" said Lady Grosville, as she rose. Then she added:\n\"I'll go and see if she has a headache. You must consult with us,\nWilliam; you know the mother so well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm no good!\" said Ashe, with energy. \"But I'm sure that kindness\nwould pay with Lady Kitty.\"\n\nHe smiled at her, wishing to Heaven she would go.\n\nLady Grosville stared.\n\n\"I hope we are always kind to her,\" she said, with a touch of\nhaughtiness. And then the library door closed behind her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Kindness\" was indeed, that afternoon, the order of the day, as from the\nGrosvilles to Lady Kitty. Ashe wondered how she liked it. The girls\nfollowed her about with shawls. Lady Grosville installed her on a sofa\nin the back drawing-room. A bottle of sal-volatile appeared, and\nCaroline Grosville, instead of going twice to Sunday-school, devoted\nherself to fanning Kitty, though the weather--which was sunny, with a\nsharp east wind--suggested, to Ashe's thinking, fires rather than fans.\n\nHe was himself carried off for the customary Sunday walk, Mr. Kershaw\nbeing now determined to claim the sacred rights of the press. The\nwalkers left the house by a garden door, to reach which they had to pass\nthrough the farther drawing-room. Kitty, a picturesque figure on the\nsofa, nodded farewell to Ashe, and then, unseen by Caroline Grosville,\nwho sat behind her, shot him a last look which drove him to a\nprecipitate exit lest the inward laugh should out.\n\nThe walk through the flat Cambridgeshire country was long and strenuous.\nThough for at least half of it the active journalist who was Ashe's\ncompanion conceived the poorest opinion of the new minister. Ashe knew\nnothing; had no opinions; cared for nothing, except now and then for the\nstalking of an unfamiliar bird, or the antics of the dogs, or tales of\nhorse-racing, of which he talked with a fervor entirely denied to those\nhigh political topics of which Kershaw's ardent soul was full.\n\nAgain and again did the journalist put them under his nose in their most\nattractive guise. In vain; Ashe would have none of them. Till suddenly a\nchance word started an Indian frontier question, vastly important, and\ntotally unknown to the English public. Ashe casually began to talk; the\ntrickle became a stream, and presently he was holding forth with an\nimpetuosity, a knowledge, a matured and careful judgment that fairly\namazed the man beside him.\n\nThe long road, bordered by the flat fen meadows, the wide silver sky,\nthe gently lengthening day, all passed unnoticed. The journalist found\nhimself in the grip of a _mind_--strong, active, rich. He gave himself\nup with docility, yet with a growing astonishment, and when they stood\nonce more on the steps of the house he said to his companion:\n\n\"You must have followed these matters for years. Why have you never\nspoken in the House, or written anything?\"\n\nAshe's aspect changed at once.\n\n\"What would have been the good?\" he said, with his easy smile. \"The\nfellows who didn't know wouldn't have believed me; and the fellows who\nknew didn't want telling.\"\n\nA shade of impatience showed in Kershaw's aspect.\n\n\"I thought,\" he said, \"ours was government by discussion.\"\n\nAshe laughed, and, turning on the steps, he pointed to the splendid\ngardens and finely wooded park.\n\n\"Or government by country-houses--which? If you support us in this--as I\ngather you will--this walk will have been worth a debate--now won't it?\"\n\nThe flattered journalist smiled, and they entered the house. From the\ninner hall Lord Grosville perceived them.\n\n\"Geoffrey Cliffe's arrived,\" he said to Ashe, as they reached him.\n\n\"Has he?\" said Ashe, and turned to go up-stairs.\n\nBut Kershaw showed a lively interest. \"You mean the traveller?\" he asked\nof his host.\n\n\"I do. As mad as usual,\" said the old man. \"He and my niece Kitty make a\npair.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nWhen Ashe returned to the drawing-room he found it filled with the sound\nof talk and laughter. But it was a talk and laughter in which the\nGrosville family seemed to have itself but little part. Lady Grosville\nsat stiffly on an early Victorian sofa, her spectacles on her nose,\nreading the _Times_ of the preceding day, or appearing to read it. Amy\nGrosville, the eldest girl, was busy in a corner, putting the finishing\ntouches to a piece of illumination; while Caroline, seated on the floor,\nwas showing the small child of a neighbor how to put a picture-puzzle\ntogether. Lord Grosville was professedly in a farther room, talking with\nthe Austrian count; but every other minute he strolled restlessly into\nthe big drawing-room, and stood at the edge of the talk and laughter,\nonly to turn on his heel again and go back to the count--who meanwhile\nappeared in the opening between the two rooms, his hands on his hips,\neagerly watching Kitty Bristol and her companions, while waiting, as\ncourtesy bade him, for the return of his host.\n\nAshe at once divined that the Grosville family were in revolt. Nor had\nhe to look far to discover the cause.\n\nWas that astonishing young lady in truth identical with the pensive\nfigure of the morning? Kitty had doffed her black, and she wore a\n\"demi-toilette\" gown of the utmost elegance, of which the expensiveness\nhad, no doubt, already sunk deep into Lady Grosville's soul. At\nGrosville Park the new fashion of \"tea-gowns\" was not favorably\nregarded. It was thought to be a mere device of silly and extravagant\nwomen, and an \"afternoon dress,\" though of greater pretensions than a\nmorning gown, was still a sober affair, not in any way to be confounded\nwith those decorative effects that nature and sound sense reserved for\nthe evening.\n\nBut Kitty's dress was of some white silky material; and it displayed her\nslender throat and some portion of her thin white arms. The Dean's wife,\nMrs. Winston, as she secretly studied it, felt an inward satisfaction;\nfor here at last was one of those gowns she had once or twice gazed on\nwith a covetous awe in the shop-windows of the Rue de la Paix, brought\ndown to earth, and clothing a simple mortal. They were then real, and\nthey could be worn by real women; which till now the Dean's wife had\nscarcely believed.\n\nAlack! how becoming were these concoctions to minxes with fair hair and\nsylphlike frames! Kitty was radiant, triumphant; and Ashe was certain\nthat Lady Grosville knew it, however she might barricade herself behind\nthe _Times_. The girl's slim fingers gesticulated in aid of her tongue;\none tiny foot swung lightly over the other; the glistening folds of the\nsilk wrapped her in a shimmering whiteness, above which the fair\nhead--negligently thrown back--shone out on a red background, made by\nthe velvet chair in which she sat.\n\nThe Dean was placed close beside her, and was clearly enjoying himself\nenormously. And in front of her, absorbed in her, engaged, indeed, in\nhot and furious debate with her, stood the great man who had just\narrived.\n\n\"How do you do, Cliffe?\" said Ashe, as he approached.\n\nGeoffrey Cliffe turned sharply, and a perfunctory greeting passed\nbetween the two men.\n\n\"When did you arrive?\" said Ashe, as he threw himself into an arm-chair.\n\n\"Last Tuesday. But that don't matter,\" said Cliffe,\nimpatiently--\"nothing matters--except that I must somehow defeat Lady\nKitty!\"\n\nAnd he stood, looking down upon the girl in front of him, his hands on\nhis sides, his queer countenance twitching with suppressed laughter. An\nodd figure, tall, spare, loosely jointed, surmounted by a pale parchment\nface, which showed a somewhat protruding chin, a long and delicate nose,\nand fine brows under a strange overhanging mass of fair hair. He had the\ndissipated, battered look of certain Vandyck cavaliers, and certainly no\nhandsomeness of any accepted kind. But as Ashe well knew, the aspect and\npersonality of Geoffrey Cliffe possessed for innumerable men and women,\nin English \"society\" and out of it, a fascination it was easier to laugh\nat than to explain.\n\nLady Kitty had eyes certainly for no one else. When he spoke of\n\"defeating\" her, she laughed her defiance, and a glance of battle passed\nbetween her and Cliffe. Cliffe, still holding her with his look,\nconsidered what new ground to break.\n\n\"What is the subject?\" said Ashe.\n\n\"That men are vainer than women,\" said Kitty. \"It's so true, it's hardly\nworth saying--isn't it? Mr. Cliffe talks nonsense about our love of\nclothes--and of being admired. As if that were vanity! Of course it's\nonly our sense of duty.\"\n\n\"Duty?\" cried Cliffe, twisting his mustache. \"To whom?\"\n\n\"To the men, of course! If we didn't like clothes, if we didn't like\nbeing admired--where would you be?\"\n\n\"Personally, I could get on,\" said Cliffe. \"You expect us to be too much\non our knees.\"\n\n\"As if we should ever get you there if it didn't amuse you!\" said Kitty.\n\"Hypocrites! If we don't dress, paint, chatter, and tell lies for you,\nyou won't look at us--and if we do--\"\n\n\"Of course, it all depends on how well it's done,\" threw in Cliffe.\n\nKitty laughed.\n\n\"That's judging by results. I look to the motive. I repeat, if I powder\nand paint, it's not because I'm vain, but because it's my painful duty\nto give you pleasure.\"\n\n\"And if it doesn't give me pleasure?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Call me stupid then--not vain. I ought to have done it better.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said Ashe, \"it's your duty to please us?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" sighed Kitty. \"Worse luck!\"\n\nAnd she sank softly back in her chair, her eyes shining under the\nstimulus of the laugh that ran through her circle. The Dean joined in it\nuneasily, conscious, no doubt, of the sharp, crackling movements by\nwhich in the distance Lady Grosville was dumbly expressing\nherself--through the _Times_. Cliffe looked at the small figure a\nmoment, then seized a chair and sat down in front of her, astride.\n\n\"I wonder why you want to please us?\" he said, abruptly, his magnificent\nblue eyes upon her.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Kitty, throwing up her hands, \"if we only knew!\"\n\n\"You find it in the tragedy of your sex?\"\n\n\"Or comedy,\" said the Dean, rising. \"I take you at your word, Lady\nKitty. To-night it will be your duty to please _me_. Remember, you\npromised to say us some more French.\" He lifted an admonitory finger.\n\n\"I don't know any 'Athalie,'\" said Kitty, demurely, crossing her hands\nupon her knee.\n\nThe Dean smiled to himself as he crossed the room to Lady Grosville, and\nendeavored by an impartial criticism of the new curate's manner and\nvoice, as they had revealed themselves in church that morning, to\ndistract her attention from her niece.\n\nA hopeless task--for Kitty's personality was of the kind which absorbs,\nengulfs attention, do what the by-stander will. Eyes and ears were drawn\nperforce into the little whirlpool that she made, their owners yielding\nthem, now with delight, now with repulsion.\n\nMary Lyster, for instance, came in presently, fresh from a walk with\nLady Edith Manley. She, too, had changed her dress. But it was a\ndiscreet and reasonable change, and Lady Grosville looked at her soft\ngray gown with its muslin collar and cuffs--delicately embroidered, yet\nof a nunlike cut and air notwithstanding--with a hot energy of approval,\nprovoked entirely by Kitty's audacities. Mary meanwhile raised her\neyebrows gently at the sight of Kitty. She swept past the group, giving\na cool greeting to Geoffrey Cliffe, and presently settled herself in the\nfarther room, attended by Louis Harman and Darrell, who had just arrived\nby the afternoon train. Clearly she observed Kitty and observed her with\ndislike. The attitude of her companions was not so simple.\n\n\"What an amazing young woman!\" said Harman, presently, under his breath,\nyet open-mouthed. \"I suppose she and Cliffe are old friends.\"\n\n\"I believe they never met before,\" said Mary.\n\nDarrell laughed.\n\n\"Lady Kitty makes short work of the preliminaries,\" he said; \"she told\nme the other night life wasn't long enough to begin with talk about the\nweather.\"\n\n\"The weather?\" said Harman. \"At the present moment she and Cliffe seem\nto be discussing the 'Dame aux Cam\u00c3\u00a9lias.' Since when do they take young\ngirls to see that kind of thing in Paris?\"\n\nMiss Lyster gave a little cough, and bending forward said to Harman:\n\"Lady Tranmore has shown me your picture. It is a dear, delicious thing!\nI never saw anything more heavenly than the angel.\"\n\nHarman smiled a flattered smile. Mary Lyster referred to a copy of a\n\"Filippo Lippi Annunciation\" which he had just executed in water-color\nfor Lady Tranmore, to whom he was devoted. He was, however, devoted to a\ngood many peeresses, with whom he took tea, and for whom he undertook\nmany harmless and elegant services. He painted their portraits, in small\nsize, after pre-Raphaelite models, and he occasionally presented them\nwith copies--a little weak, but charming--of their favorite Italian\npictures. He and Mary began now to talk of Florence with much enthusiasm\nand many caressing adjectives. For Harman most things were \"sweet\"; for\nMary, \"interesting\" or \"suggestive.\" She talked fast and fluently; a\nsubtle observer might have guessed she wished it to be seen that for her\nLady Kitty Bristol's flirtations, be they in or out of taste, were\nsimply non-existent.\n\nDarrell listened intermittently, watched Cliffe and Lady Kitty, and\nthought a good deal. That extraordinary girl was certainly \"carrying on\"\nwith Cliffe, as she had \"carried on\" with Ashe on the night of her first\nacquaintance with him in St. James's Place. Ashe apparently took it with\nequanimity, for he was still sitting beside the pair, twisting a\npaper-knife and smiling, sometimes putting in a word, but more often\nsilent, and apparently of no account at all to either Kitty or Cliffe.\n\nDarrell knew that the new minister disliked and despised Geoffrey\nCliffe; he was aware, too, that Cliffe returned these sentiments, and\nwas not unlikely to be found attacking Ashe in public before long on\ncertain points of foreign policy, where Cliffe conceived himself to be a\nmaster. The meeting of the two men under the Grosvilles' roof struck\nDarrell as curious. Why had Cliffe been invited by these very\nrespectable and straitlaced people the Grosvilles? Darrell could only\nreflect that Lady Eleanor Cliffe, the traveller's mother, was probably\nconnected with them by some of those innumerable and ever-ramifying\nlinks that hold together a certain large group of English families; and\nthat, moreover, Lady Grosville, in spite of philanthropy and\nEvangelicalism, had always shown a rather pronounced taste in\n\"lions\"--of the masculine sort. Of the women to be met with at Grosville\nPark, one could be certain. Lady Grosville made no excuses for her own\nsex. But she was a sufficiently ambitious hostess to know that agreeable\nparties are not constructed out of the saints alone. The men, therefore,\nmust provide the sinners; and of some of the persons then most in vogue\nshe was careful not to know too much. For, socially, one must live; and\nthat being so, the strictness of to-day may have at any moment to be\npurchased by the laxity of to-morrow. Such, at any rate, was Darrell's\nanalysis of the situation.\n\nHe was still astonished, however, when all was said. For Cliffe during\nthe preceding winter, on his return from some remarkable travels in\nPersia, had paused on the Riviera, and an affair at Cannes with a French\nvicomtesse had got into the English papers. No one knew the exact truth\nof it; and a small volume of verse by Cliffe, published immediately\nafterwards--verse very distinguished, passionate, and obscure--had\noffered many clews, but no solution whatever. Nobody supposed, however,\nthat the story was anything but a bad one. Moreover, the last book of\ntravels--which had had an enormous success--contained one of the most\nmalicious attacks on foreign missions that Darrell remembered. And if\nthe missionaries had a supporter in England, it was Lady Grosville. Had\nshe designs--material designs--on behalf of Miss Amy or Miss Caroline?\nDarrell smiled at the notion. Cliffe must certainly marry money, and was\nnot to be captured by any Miss Amys--or Lady Kittys either, for the\nmatter of that.\n\nBut?--Darrell glanced at the lady beside him, and his busy thoughts took\na new turn. He had seen the greeting between Miss Lyster and Cliffe. It\nwas cold; but all the same the world knew that they had once been\nfriends. Was it some five years before that Miss Lyster, then in the\nheight of a brilliant season under the wing of Lady Tranmore, had been\nmuch seen in public with Geoffrey Cliffe? Then he had departed eastward,\nto explore the upper waters of the M\u00c3\u00a9kong, and the gossip excited had\ndied away. Of late her name had been rather coupled with that of William\nAshe.\n\nWell, so far as the world was concerned, she might mate with\neither--with the mad notoriety of Cliffe or the young distinction of\nAshe. Darrell's bitter heart contracted as he reflected that only for\nhim and the likes of him, men of the people, with average ability, and a\nscarcely average income, were maidens of Mary Lyster's dower and\npedigree out of reach. Meanwhile he revenged himself by being her very\ngood friend, and allowing himself at times much caustic plainness of\nspeech in his talks with her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are you three gossiping about?\" said Ashe, strolling in presently\nfrom the other room to join them.\n\n\"As usual,\" said Darrell. \"I am listening to perfection. Miss Lyster and\nHarman are discussing pictures.\"\n\nAshe stifled a little yawn. He threw himself down by Mary, vowing that\nthere was no more pleasure to be got out of pictures now that people\nwould try to know so much about them. Mary meanwhile raised herself\ninvoluntarily to look into the farther room, where the noise made by\nCliffe and Lady Kitty had increased.\n\n\"They are going to sing,\" said Ashe, lazily--\"and it won't be hymns.\"\n\nIn fact, Lady Kitty had opened the piano, and had begun the first bars\nof something French and operatic. At the first sound of Kitty's music,\nhowever, Lady Grosville drew herself up; she closed the volume of\nEvangelical sermons for which she had exchanged the _Times_; she\ndeposited her spectacles sharply on the table beside her.\n\n\"Amy!--Caroline!\"\n\nThose young ladies rose. So did Lady Grosville. Kitty meanwhile sat with\nsuspended fingers and laughing eyes, waiting on her aunt's movements.\n\n\"Kitty, pray don't let me interfere with your playing,\" said Lady\nGrosville, with severe politeness--\"but perhaps you would kindly put it\noff for half an hour. I am now going to read to the servants--\"\n\n\"Gracious!\" said Kitty, springing up. \"I was going to play Mr. Cliffe\nsome Offenbach.\"\n\n\"Ah, but the piano can be heard in the library, and your cousin Amy\nplays the harmonium--\"\n\n\"_Mon Dieu_!\" said Kitty. \"We will be as quiet as mice. Or\"--she made a\nquick step in pursuit of her aunt--\"shall I come and sing, Aunt Lina?\"\n\nAshe, in his shelter behind Mary Lyster, fell into a silent convulsion\nof laughter.\n\n\"No, thank you!\" said Lady Grosville, hastily. And she rustled away\nfollowed by her daughters.\n\nKitty came flying into the inner room followed by Cliffe.\n\n\"What have I done?\" she said, breathlessly, addressing Harman, who rose\nto greet her. \"Mayn't one play the piano here on Sundays?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" said Harman, \"on what you play.\"\n\n\"Who made your English Sunday?\" said Kitty, impetuously. \"Je vous\ndemande--_who_?\"\n\nShe threw her challenge to all the winds of heaven--standing tiptoe, her\nhands poised on the back of a chair, the smallest and most delicate of\nfuries.\n\n\"A breath unmakes it, as a breath has made,\" said Cliffe. \"Come and play\nbilliards, Lady Kitty. You said just now you played.\"\n\n\"Billiards!\" said Harman, throwing up his hands. \"On Sunday--_here_?\"\n\n\"Can they hear the balls?\" said Kitty, eagerly, with a gesture towards\nthe library.\n\nMary Lyster, who had been perfunctorily looking at a book, laid it down.\n\n\"It would certainly greatly distress Lady Grosville,\" she said, in a\nvoice studiously soft, but on that account perhaps all the more\nsignificant.\n\nKitty glanced at Mary, and Ashe saw the sudden red in her cheek. She\nturned provokingly to Cliffe. \"There's quite half an hour, isn't there,\nbefore one need dress--\"\n\n\"More,\" said Cliffe. \"Come along.\"\n\nAnd he made for the door, which he held open for her. It was now Mary\nLyster's turn to flush--the rebuff had been so naked and unadorned. Ashe\nrose as Kitty passed him.\n\n\"Why don't you come, too?\" she said, pausing. There was a flash from\neyes deep and dark beneath a pair of wilful brows. \"Aunt Lina would\nnever be cross with _you_!\"\n\n\"Thank you! I should be delighted to play buffer, but unfortunately I\nhave some work I must do before dinner.\"\n\n\"Must you?\" She looked at him uncertainly, then at Cliffe. In the dusk\nof the large, heavily furnished room, the pale yet brilliant gold of her\nhair, her white dress, her slim energy and elegance drew all their\neyes--even Mary Lyster's.\n\n\"I must,\" Ashe repeated, smiling. \"I am glad your headache is so much\nbetter.\"\n\n\"It is not in the least better!\"\n\n\"Then you disguise it like a heroine.\"\n\nHe stood beside her, looking down upon her, his height and strength\nmeasured against her smallness. Apparently his amused detachment, the\nslight dryness of his tone annoyed her. She made a tart reply and\nvanished through the door that Cliffe held open for her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAshe retired to his own room, dealt with some Foreign Office work, and\nthen allowed himself a meditative smoke. The click of the billiard-balls\nhad ceased abruptly about ten minutes after he had begun upon his\npapers; there had been voices in the hall, Lord Grosville's he thought\namong them; and now all was silence.\n\nHe thought of the events of the afternoon with mingled amusement and\nannoyance. Cliffe was an unscrupulous fellow, and the child's head might\nbe turned. She should be protected from him in future--he vowed she\nshould. Lady Tranmore should take it in hand. She had been a match for\nCliffe in various other directions before this.\n\nWhat brought the man, with his notorious character and antecedents, to\nGrosville Park--one of the dwindling number of country-houses in England\nwhere the old Puritan restrictions still held? It was said he was on the\nlook-out for a post--Ashe, indeed, happened to know it officially; and\nLord Grosville had a good deal of influence. Moreover, failing an\nappointment, he was understood to be aiming at Parliament and office;\nand there were two safe county-seats within the Grosville sphere.\n\n\"Yet even when he wants a thing he can't behave himself in order to get\nit,\" thought Ashe. \"Anybody else would have turned Sabbatarian for once,\nand refrained from flirting with the Grosvilles' niece. But that's\nCliffe all over--and perhaps the best thing about him.\"\n\nHe might have added that as Cliffe was supposed to desire an appointment\nunder either the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office, it might have\nbeen thought to his interest to show himself more urbane than he had in\nfact shown himself that afternoon to the new Under-Secretary for Foreign\nAffairs. But Ashe rarely or never indulged himself in reflections of\nthat kind. Besides, he and Cliffe knew each other too well for posing.\nThere was a time when they had been on very friendly terms, and when\nCliffe had been constantly in his mother's drawing-room. Lady Tranmore\nhad a weakness for \"influencing\" young men of family and ability; and\nCliffe, in fact, owed her a good deal. Then she had seen cause to think\nill of him; and, moreover, his travels had taken him to the other side\nof the world. Ashe was now well aware that Cliffe reckoned on him as a\nhostile influence and would not try either to deceive or to propitiate\nhim.\n\nHe thought Cliffe had been disagreeably surprised to see him that\nafternoon. Perhaps it was the sudden sense of antagonism acting on the\nman's excitable nature that had made him fling himself into the wild\nnonsense he had talked with Lady Kitty.\n\nAnd thenceforward Ashe's thoughts were possessed by Kitty only--Kitty in\nher two aspects, of the morning and the afternoon. He dressed in a\nreverie, and went down-stairs still dreaming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dinner he found himself responsible for Mary Lyster. Kitty was on the\nother side of the table, widely separated both from himself and Cliffe.\nShe was in a little Empire dress of blue and silver, as extravagantly\nsimple as her gown of the afternoon had been extravagantly elaborate.\n\nAshe observed the furtive study that the Grosville girls could not help\nbestowing upon her--upon her shoulder-straps and long, bare arms, upon\nher high waist and the blue and silver bands in her hair. Kitty herself\nsat in a pensive or proud silence. The Dean was beside her, but she\nscarcely spoke to him, and as to the young man from the neighborhood who\nhad taken her in, he was to her as though he were not.\n\n\"Has there been a row?\" Ashe inquired, in a low voice, of his companion.\n\nMary looked at him quietly.\n\n\"Lord Grosville asked them not to play--because of the servants.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Ashe. \"The servants were, of course, playing cards in the\nhouse-keeper's room.\"\n\n\"Not at all. They were singing hymns with Lady Grosville.\"\n\nAshe looked incredulous.\n\n\"Only the slaveys and scullery maids that couldn't help themselves.\nNever mind. Was Lady Kitty amenable?\"\n\n\"She seems to have made Lord Grosville very angry. Lady Grosville and I\nsmoothed him down.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" said Ashe. \"That was nice of you.\"\n\nMary colored a little, and did not reply. Presently Ashe resumed.\n\n\"Aren't you as sorry for her as I am?\"\n\n\"For Lady Kitty? I should think she managed to amuse herself pretty\nwell.\"\n\n\"She seems to me the most deplorable tragic little person,\" said Ashe,\nslowly.\n\nMiss Lyster laughed.\n\n\"I really don't see it,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh yes, you do,\" he persisted--\"if you think a moment. Be kind to\nher--won't you?\"\n\nShe drew herself up with a cold dignity.\n\n\"I confess that she has never attracted me in the least.\"\n\nAshe returned to his dinner, dimly conscious that he had spoken like a\nfool.\n\nWhen the ladies had withdrawn, the conversation fell on some important\nnews from the Far East contained in the Sunday papers that Geoffrey\nCliffe had brought down, and presumed to form part of the despatches\nwhich the two ministers staying in the house had received that afternoon\nby Foreign Office messenger. The government of Teheran was in one of its\nperiodical fits of ill-temper with England; had been meddling with\nAfghanistan, flirting badly with Russia, and bringing ridiculous charges\nagainst the British minister. An expedition to Bushire was talked of,\nand the Radical press was on the war-path. The cabinet minister said\nlittle. A Lord Privy Seal, reverentially credited with advising royalty\nin its private affairs, need have no views on the Persian Gulf. But Ashe\nwas appealed to and talked well. The minister at Teheran was an old\nfriend of his, and he described the personal attacks made on him for\npolitical reasons by the Shah and his ministers with a humor which kept\nthe table entertained.\n\nSuddenly Cliffe interposed. He had been listening with restlessness,\nthough Ashe, with pointed courtesy, had once or twice included him in\nthe conversation. And presently, at a somewhat dramatic moment, he met a\nstatement of Ashe's with a direct and violent contradiction. Ashe\nflushed, and a duel began between the two men of which the company were\nsoon silent spectators. Ashe had the resources of official knowledge;\nCliffe had been recently on the spot, and pushed home the advantage of\nthe eye-witness with a covert insolence which Ashe bore with surprising\ncarelessness and good-temper. In the end Cliffe said some outrageous\nthings, at which Ashe laughed; and Lord Grosville abruptly dissolved the\nparty.\n\nAshe went smiling out of the dining-room, caressing a fine white\nspaniel, as though nothing had happened. In crossing the hall Harman\nfound himself alone with the Dean, who looked serious and preoccupied.\n\n\"That was a curious spectacle,\" said Harman. \"Ashe's equanimity was\namazing.\"\n\n\"I had rather have seen him angrier,\" said the Dean, slowly.\n\n\"He was always a very tolerant, easy-going fellow.\"\n\nThe Dean shook his head.\n\n\"A touch of _soeva indignatio_ now and then would complete him.\"\n\n\"Has he got it in him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said the little Dean, with a flash of expression that\ndignified all his frail person. \"But without it he will hardly make a\ngreat man.\"\n\nMeanwhile Geoffrey Cliffe, his strange, twisted face still vindictively\naglow, made his way to Kitty Bristol's corner in the drawing-room. Mary\nLyster was conscious of it, conscious also of a certain look that Kitty\nbestowed upon the entrance of Ashe, while Cliffe was opening a battery\nof mingled chaff and compliments that did not at first have much effect\nupon her. But William Ashe threw himself into conversation with Lady\nEdith Manley, and was presently, to all appearance, happily plunged in\ngossip, his tall person wholly at ease in a deep arm-chair, while Lady\nEdith bent over him with smiles. Meanwhile there was a certain desertion\nof Kitty on the part of the ladies. Lady Grosville hardly spoke to her,\nand the girls markedly avoided her. There was a moment when Kitty,\nlooking round her, suddenly shook her small shoulders, and like a colt\nescaping from harness gave herself to riot. She and Cliffe amused\nthemselves so well and so noisily that the whole drawing-room was\npresently uneasily aware of them. Lady Grosville shot glances of wrath,\nrose suddenly at one moment and sat down again; her girls talked more\ndisjointedly than ever to the gentlemen who were civilly attending them;\nwhile, on the other hand, Miss Lyster's flow of conversation with Louis\nHarman was more softly copious than usual. At last the Dean's wife\nlooked at the Dean, a signal of kind distress, and the Dean advanced.\n\n\"Lady Kitty,\" he said, taking a seat beside the pair, \"have you\nforgotten you promised me some French?\"\n\nKitty turned on him a hot and mutinous face.\n\n\"Did I? What shall I say? Some Alfred de Musset?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Dean, \"I think not.\"\n\n\"Some--some\"--she cudgelled her memory--\"some Th\u00c3\u00a9ophile Gautier?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not!\" said the Dean, hastily.\n\n\"Well, as I don't know a word of him--\" laughed Kitty.\n\n\"That was mischievous,\" said the Dean, raising a finger. \"Let me suggest\nLamartine.\"\n\nKitty shook her head obstinately. \"I never learned one line.\"\n\n\"Then some of the old fellows,\" said the Dean, persuasively. \"I long to\nhear you in Corneille or Racine. That we should _all_ enjoy.\"\n\nAnd suddenly his wrinkled hand fell kindly on the girl's small, chilly\nringers and patted them. Their eyes met, Kitty's wild and challenging,\nthe Dean's full of that ethereal benevolence which blended so agreeably\nwith his character as courtier and man of the world. There was a bright\nsweetness in them which seemed to say: \"Poor child! I understand. But be\na _little_ good--as well as clever--and all will be well.\"\n\nSuddenly Kitty's look wavered and fell. All the harshness dissolved from\nher thin young beauty. She turned from Cliffe, and the Dean saw her\nquiver with submission.\n\n\"I think I could say some 'Polyeucte,'\" she said, gently.\n\nThe Dean clapped his hands and rose.\n\n\"Lady Grosville,\" he said, raising his voice--\"Ladies and gentlemen,\nLady Kitty has promised to say us some more French poetry. You remember\nhow admirably she recited last night. But this is Sunday, and she will\ngive us something in a different vein.\"\n\nLady Grosville, who had risen impatiently, sat down again. There was a\ngeneral movement; chairs were turned or drawn forward till a circle\nformed. Meanwhile the Dean consulted with Kitty and resumed:\n\n\"Lady Kitty will recite a scene from Corneille's beautiful tragedy of\n'Polyeucte'--the scene in which Pauline, after witnessing the martyrdom\nof her husband, who has been beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to the\ngods, returns from the place of execution so melted by the love and\nsacrifice she has beheld that she opens her heart then and there to the\nsame august faith and pleads for the same death.\"\n\nThe Dean seated himself, and Kitty stepped into the centre of the\ncircle. She thought a moment, her lips moving, as though she recalled\nthe lines. Then she looked down at her bare arms, and dress, frowned,\nand suddenly approached Lady Edith Manley.\n\n\"May I have that?\" she said, pointing to a lace cloak that lay on Lady\nEdith's knee. \"I am rather cold.\"\n\nLady Edith handed it to her, and she threw it round her.\n\n\"Actress!\" said Cliffe, under his breath, with a grin of amusement.\n\nAt any rate, her impulse served her well. Her form and dress disappeared\nunder a cloud of white. She became in a flash, so to speak,\nevangelized--a most innocent and spiritual apparition. Her beautiful\nhead, her kindled and transfigured face, her little hand on the white\nfolds, these alone remained to mingle their impression with the austere\nand moving tragedy which her lips recited. Her audience looked on at\nfirst with the embarrassed or hostile air which is the Englishman's\nnatural protection against the great things of art; then for those who\nunderstood French the high passion and the noble verse began to tell;\nwhile those who could not follow were gradually enthralled by the\ngestures and tones with which the slight, vibrating creature, whom but\nten minutes before most of them had regarded as a mere noisy flirt,\nsuggested and conveyed the finest and most compelling shades of love,\nfaith, and sacrifice.\n\nWhen she ceased, there was a moment's profound silence. Then Lady Edith,\ndrawing a long breath, expressed the welcome commonplace which restored\nthe atmosphere of daily life.\n\n\"How _could_ you remember it all?\"\n\nKitty sat down, her lip trembling scornfully.\n\n\"I had to say it every week at the convent.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Cliffe in Darrell's ear--\"that last night she was\nDo\u00c3\u00b1a Sol. An accommodating young woman.\"\n\nMeanwhile Kitty looked up to find Ashe beside her. He said,\n\"Magnificent!\"--but it did not matter to her what he said. His face told\nher that she had moved him, and that he was incapable of any foolish\nchatter about it. A smile of extraordinary sweetness sprang into her\neyes; and when Lady Grosville came up to thank her, the girl impetuously\nrose, and, in the foreign way, kissed her hand, courtesying. Lord\nGrosville said, heartily, \"Upon my word, Kitty, you ought to go on the\nstage!\" and she smiled upon him, too, in a flutter of feeling,\nforgetting his scolding and her own impertinence, before dinner. The\nrevulsion, indeed, throughout the company--with two exceptions--was\ncomplete. For the rest of the evening Kitty basked in sunshine and\nflattery. She met it with a joyous gentleness, and the little figure,\nstill bedraped in white, became the centre of the room's kindness.\n\nThe Dean was triumphant.\n\n\"My dear Miss Lyster,\" he said, presently, finding himself near that\nlady, \"did you ever hear anything better done? A most remarkable\ntalent!\"\n\nMary smiled.\n\n\"I am wondering,\" she said, \"what they teach you in French convents--and\nwhy! It is all so singular,--isn't it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLate that night Ashe entered his room--before his usual time, however.\nHe had tired even of Lord Grosville's chat, and had left the\nsmoking-room still talking. Indeed, he wished to be alone, and there was\nthat in his veins which told him that a new motive had taken possession\nof his life.\n\nHe sat beside the open window reviewing the scenes and feelings of the\nday--his interview with Kitty in the morning--the teasing coquette of\nthe afternoon--the inspired poetic child of the evening. Rapidly, but\nnone the less strongly and steadfastly, he made up his mind. He would\nask Kitty Bristol to marry him, and he would ask her immediately.\n\nWhy? He scarcely knew her. His mother, his family would think it\nmadness. No doubt it was madness. Yet, as far as he could explain his\nimpulse himself, it depended on certain fundamental facts in his own\nnature--it was in keeping with his deepest character. He had an inbred\nlove of the difficult, the unconventional in life, of all that piqued\nand stimulated his own superabundant consciousness of resource and\npower. And he had a tenderness of feeling, a gift of chivalrous pity,\nonly known to the few, which was in truth always hungrily on the watch,\nlike some starved faculty that cannot find its outlet. The thought of\nthis beautiful child, in the hands of such a mother as Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es,\nand rushing upon risks illustrated by the half-mocking attentions of\nGeoffrey Cliffe, did in truth wring his heart. With a strange\nimaginative clearness he foresaw her future, he beheld her the prey at\nonce of some bad fellow and of her own temperament. She would come to\ngrief; he saw the prescience of it in her already; and what a waste\nwould be there!\n\nNo!--he would step in--capture her before these ways and whims, now\nmerely bizarre or foolish, stiffened into what might in truth destroy\nher. His pulse quickened as he thought of the development of this\nbeauty, the ripening of this intelligence. Never yet had he seen a girl\nwhom he much wished to marry. He was easily repelled by stupidity, still\nmore by mere amiability. Some touch of acid, of roughness in the\nfruit--that drew him, in politics, thought, love. And if she married him\nhe vowed to himself, proudly, that she would find him no tyrant. Many a\nman might marry her who would then fight her and try to break her. All\nthat was most fastidious and characteristic in Ashe revolted from such a\nnotion. With him she should have _freedom_--whatever it might cost. He\nasked himself deliberately, whether after marriage he could see her\nflirting with other men, as she had flirted that day with Cliffe, and\nstill refrain from coercing her. And his question was answered, or\nrather put aside, first by the confidence of nascent love--he would love\nher so well and so loyally that she would naturally turn to him for\ncounsel; and then by the clear perception that she was a creature of\nmind rather than sense, governed mainly by the caprices and curiosities\nof the _intelligence_, combined with a rather cold, indifferent\ntemperament. One moment throwing herself wildly into a dangerous or\nexciting intimacy, the next, parting with a laugh, and without a\nregret--it was thus he saw her in the future, even as a wife. \"She may\nscandalize half the world,\" he said to himself, stubbornly--\"I shall\nunderstand her!\"\n\nBut his mother?--his friends?--his colleagues? He knew well his mother's\nambitions for him, and the place that he held in her heart. Could he\nwithout cruelty impose upon her such a daughter as Kitty Bristol?\nWell!--his mother had a very large experience of life, and much natural\nindependence of mind. He trusted her to see the promise in this untamed\nand gifted creature; he counted on the sense of power that Lady Tranmore\npossessed, and which would but find new scope in the taming of Kitty.\n\nBut Kitty's mother? Kitty must, of course, be rescued from Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--must find a new and truer mother in Lady Tranmore. But money\nwould do it; and money must be lavished.\n\nThen, almost for the first time, Ashe felt a conscious delight in wealth\nand birth. _Panache_? He could give it her--the little, wild, lovely\nthing! Luxury, society, adoration--all should be hers. She should be so\nloved and cherished, she must needs love in turn.\n\nHis dreams were delicious; and the sudden fear into which he fell at the\nend lest after all Kitty should mock and turn from him, was only in\ntruth another pleasure. No delay! Circumstances might develop at any\nmoment and sweep her from him. Now or never must he snatch her from\ndifficulty and disgrace--let hostile tongues wag as they pleased--and\nmake her his.\n\nHis political future? He knew well the influence which, in these days of\nuniversal publicity, a man's private affairs may have on his public\ncareer. And in truth his heart was in that career, and the thought of\nendangering it hurt him. Certainly it would recommend him to nobody that\nhe should marry Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' daughter. On the other hand, what\nfavor did he want of anybody? save what work and \"knowing more than the\nother fellows\" might compel? The cynic in him was well aware that he had\nalready what other men fought for--family, money, and position. Society\nmust accept his wife; and Kitty, once mellowed by happiness and praise,\nmight live, laugh, and rattle as she pleased.\n\nAs to strangeness and caprice, the modern world delights in them; \"the\nviolent take it by force.\" There is, indeed, a dividing-line; but it was\na love-marriage that should keep Kitty on the safe side of it.\n\nHe stood lost in a very ecstasy of resolve, when suddenly there was a\nsharp movement outside, and a flash of white among the yew hedges\nbordering the formal garden on which his windows looked. The night\noutside was still and veiled, but of the flash of white he was\ncertain--and of a step on the gravel.\n\nSomething fell beside him, thrown from outside. He picked it up, and\nfound a flower weighted by a stone, tied into a fold of ribbon.\n\n\"Madcap!\" he said to himself, his heart beating to suffocation.\n\nThen he stole out of his room, and down a small, winding staircase which\nled directly to the garden and a door beside the orangery. He had to\nunbolt the door, and as he did so a dog in one of the basement rooms\nbegan to bark. But there could be no flinching, though the whole thing\nwas of an imprudence which pricked his conscience. To slip along the\nshadowed side of the orangery, to cross the space of clouded light\nbeyond, and gain the darkness of the ilex avenue beyond was soon done.\nThen he heard a soft laugh, and a little figure fled before him. He\nfollowed and overtook.\n\nKitty Bristol turned upon him.\n\n\"Didn't I throw straight?\" she said, triumphantly. \"And they say girls\ncan't throw.\"\n\n\"But why did you throw at all?\" he said, capturing her hand.\n\n\"Because I wanted to talk to you. And I was restless and couldn't sleep.\nWhy did you never come and talk to me this afternoon? And why\"--she beat\nher foot angrily--\"did you let me go and play billiards alone with Mr.\nCliffe?\"\n\n\"Let you!\" cried Ashe. \"As if anybody could have prevented you!\"\n\n\"One sees, of course, that you detest Mr. Cliffe,\" said the whiteness\nbeside him.\n\n\"I didn't come here to talk about Geoffrey Cliffe. I _won't_ talk about\nhim! Though, of course, you must know--\"\n\n\"That I flirted with him abominably all the afternoon? _C'est\nvrai--c'est ab-sol-ument vrai!_ And I shall always want to flirt with\nhim, wherever I am--and whatever I may be doing.\"\n\n\"Do as you please,\" said Ashe, dryly, \"but I think you will get tired.\"\n\n\"No, no--he excites me! He is bad, false, selfish, but he excites me. He\ntalks to very few women--one can see that. And all the women want to\ntalk to him. He used to admire Miss Lyster, and now he dislikes her. But\nshe doesn't dislike him. No! she would marry him to-morrow if he asked\nher.\"\n\n\"You are very positive,\" said Ashe. \"Allow me to say that I entirely\ndisagree with you.\"\n\n\"You don't know anything about her,\" said the teasing voice.\n\n\"She is my cousin, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? I know much more than you do, though I have only\nseen her two days. I know that--well, I am afraid of her!\"\n\n\"Afraid of her? Did you come out--may I ask--determined to talk\nnonsense?\"\n\n\"I came out--never mind! I _am_ afraid of her. She hates me. I\nthink\"--he felt a shiver in the air--will do me harm if she can.\"\n\n\"No one shall do you harm,\" said Ashe, his tone changing, \"if you will\nonly trust yourself--\"\n\nShe laughed merrily.\n\n\"To you? Oh! you'd soon throw it up.\"\n\n\"Try me!\" he said, approaching her. \"Lady Kitty, I have something to say\nto you.\"\n\nSuddenly she shrank away from him. He could not see her face, and had\nnothing to guide him.\n\n\"I haven't yet known you three weeks,\" he said, over-mastered by\nsomething passionate and profound. \"I don't know what you will\nsay--whether you can put up with me. But I know my own mind--I shall not\nchange. I--I love you. I ask you to marry me.\"\n\nA silence. The night seemed to have grown darker. Then a small hand\nseized his, and two soft lips pressed themselves upon it. He tried to\ncapture her, but she evaded him.\n\n\"You--you really and actually--want to marry me?\"\n\n\"I do, Kitty, with all my heart.\"\n\n\"You remember about my mother--about Alice?\"\n\n\"I remember everything. We would face it together.\"\n\n\"And--you know what I told you about my bad temper?\"\n\n\"Some nonsense, wasn't it? But I should be bored by the domestic dove. I\nwant the hawk, Kitty, with its quick wings and its daring bright eyes.\"\n\nShe broke from him with a cry.\n\n\"You must listen. I _have_--a wicked, odious, ungovernable temper. I\nshould make you miserable.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Ashe. \"I should take it very calmly. I am made that\nway.\"\n\n\"And then--I don't know how to put it--but I have fancies--overpowering\nfancies--and I must follow them. I have one now for Geoffrey Cliffe.\"\n\nAshe laughed.\n\n\"Oh, that won't last.\"\n\n\"Then some other will come after it. And I can't help it. It is my\nhead\"--she tapped her forehead lightly--\"that seems on fire.\"\n\nAshe at last slipped his arm round her.\n\n\"But it is your heart--you will give me.\"\n\nShe pushed him away from her and held him at arm's-length.\n\n\"You are very rich, aren't you?\" she said, in a muffled voice.\n\n\"I am well off. I can give you all the pretty things you want.\"\n\n\"And some day you will be Lord Tranmore?\"\n\n\"Yes, when my poor father dies,\" he said, sighing. He felt her fingers\ncaress his hand again. It was a spirit touch, light and tender.\n\n\"And every one says you are so clever--you have such prospects. Perhaps\nyou will be Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no saying,\" he threw out, laughing--\"if you'll come and\nhelp.\"\n\nHe heard a sob.\n\n\"Help! I should be the ruin of you. I should spoil everything. You don't\nknow the mischief I can do. And I can't help it, it's in my blood.\"\n\n\"You would like the game of politics too much to spoil it, Kitty.\" His\nvoice broke and lingered on the name. \"You would want to be a great lady\nand lead the party.\"\n\n\"Should I? Could you ever teach me how to behave?\"\n\n\"You would learn by nature. Do you know, Kitty, how clever you are?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she sighed. \"I am clever. But there is always something that\nhinders--that brings failure.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\" he said, laughing. \"Eighteen--or eighty?\"\n\nSuddenly he put out his arms, enfolding her. And she, still sobbing,\nraised her hands, clasped them round his neck, and clung to him like a\nchild.\n\n\"Oh! I knew--I knew--when I first saw your face. I had been so miserable\nall day--and then you looked at me--and I wanted to tell you all. Oh, I\nadore you--I adore you!\" Their faces met. Ashe tasted a moment of\nrapture; and knew himself free at last of the great company of poets and\nof lovers.\n\nThey slipped back to the house, and Ashe saw her disappear by a door on\nthe farther side of the orangery--noiselessly, without a sound. Except\nthat just at the last she drew him to her and breathed a sacred whisper\nin his ear.\n\n\"Oh! what--what will Lady Tranmore say?\"\n\nThen she fled. But she left her question behind her, and when the dawn\ncame Ashe found that he had spent half the night in trying anew to frame\nsome sort of an answer to it.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nTHREE YEARS AFTER\n\n\"The world an ancient murderer is.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n\"Her ladyship will be in before six, my lady. I was to be sure and ask\nyou to wait, if you came before, and to tell you that her ladyship had\ngone to Madame Fanchette about her dress for the ball.\"\n\nSo said Lady Kitty's maid. Lady Tranmore hesitated, then said she would\nwait, and asked that Master Henry might be brought down.\n\nThe maid went for the child, and Lady Tranmore entered the drawing-room.\nThe Ashes had been settled since their marriage in a house in Hill\nStreet--a house to which Kitty had lost her heart at first sight. It was\nold and distinguished, covered here and there with eighteenth-century\ndecoration, once, no doubt, a little florid and coarse beside the finer\nwork of the period, but now agreeably blunted and mellowed by time.\nKitty had had her impetuous and decided way with the furnishing of it;\nand, though Lady Tranmore professed to admire it, the result was, in\ntruth, too French and too pagan for her taste. Her own room reflected\nthe rising worship of Morris and Burse-Jones, of which, indeed, she had\nbeen an adept from the beginning. Her walls were covered by the\nwell-known pomegranate or jasmine or sunflower patterns; her hangings\nwere of a mystic greenish-blue; her pictures were drawn either from the\nItalian primitives or their modern followers. Celtic romance, Christian\nsymbolism, all that was touching, other-worldly, and obscure--our late\nEnglish form, in fact, of the great Romantic reaction--it was amid\ninfluences of this kind that Lady Tranmore lived and fed her own\nimagination. The dim, suggestive, and pathetic; twilight rather than\ndawn, autumn rather than spring; yearning rather than fulfilment; \"the\ngleam\" rather than noon-day: it was in this half-lit, richly colored\nsphere that she and most of her friends saw the tent of Beauty pitched.\n\nBut Kitty would have none of it. She quoted French sceptical remarks\nabout the legs and joints of the Burne-Jones knights; she declared that\nso much pattern made her dizzy; and that the French were the only nation\nin the world who understood a _salon_, whether as upholstery or\nconversation. Accordingly, in days when these things were rare, the girl\nof eighteen made her new husband provide her with white-panelled walls,\nlightly gilt, and with a Persian carpet of which the mass was of a\nplain, blackish gray, and only the border was allowed to flower. A few\nLouis-Quinze girandoles on the walls, a Vernis-Martin screen, an old\nFrench clock, two or three inlaid cabinets, and a collection of lightly\nbuilt chairs and settees in the French mode--this was all she would\nallow; and while Lady Tranmore's room was always crowded, Kitty's, which\nwas much smaller, had always an air of space. French books were\nscattered here and there; and only one picture was admitted. That was a\nWatteau sketch of a group from \"L'Embarquement pour Cyth\u00c3\u00a8re.\" Kitty\nadored it; Lady Tranmore thought it absurd and disagreeable.\n\nAs she entered the room now, on this May afternoon, she looked round it\nwith her usual distaste. On several of the chairs large illustrated\nbooks were lying. They contained pictures of seventeenth and eighteenth\ncentury costume--one of them displayed a colored engraving of a\nbrilliant Madame de Pompadour, by Boucher.\n\nThe maid who followed her into the room began to remove the books.\n\n\"Her ladyship has been choosing her costume, my lady,\" she explained, as\nshe closed some of the volumes.\n\n\"Is it settled?\" said Lady Tranmore.\n\nThe maid replied that she believed so, and, bringing a volume which had\nbeen laid aside with a mark in it, she opened on a fantastic plate of\nMadame de Longueville, as Diana, in a gorgeous hunting-dress.\n\nLady Tranmore looked at it in silence; she thought it unseemly, with its\nbare ankles and sandalled feet, and likely to be extremely expensive.\nFor this Diana of the Fronde sparkled with jewels from top to toe, and\nLady Tranmore felt certain that Kitty had already made William promise\nher the counterpart of the magnificent diamond crescent that shone in\nthe coiffure of the goddess.\n\n\"It really seemed to be the only one that suited her ladyship,\" said the\nmaid, in a deprecating voice.\n\n\"I dare say it will look very well,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"And Fanchette\nis to make it?\"\n\n\"If her ladyship is not too late,\" said the maid, smiling. \"But she has\ntaken such a long time to make up her mind--\"\n\n\"And Fanchette, of course, is driven to death. All the world seems to\nhave gone mad about this ball.\"\n\nLady Tranmore shrugged her shoulders in a slight disgust. She was not\ngoing. Since her elder son's death she had had no taste for spectacles\nof the kind. But she knew very well that fashionable London was talking\nand thinking of nothing else; she heard that the print-room of the\nBritish Museum was every day besieged by an eager crowd of fair ladies,\nclaiming the services of the museum officials from dewy morn till eve;\nthat historic costumes and famous jewels were to be lavished on the\naffair; that those who were not invited had not even the resource of\ncontempt, so unquestioned and indubitable was the prospect of a really\nmagnificent spectacle; and that the dress-makers of Paris and London, if\nthey survived the effort, would reap a marvellous harvest.\n\n\"And Mr. Ashe--do you know if he is going, after all?\" she asked of the\nmaid as the latter was retreating.\n\n\"Mr. Ashe says he will, if he may wear just court-dress,\" said the maid,\nsmiling. \"Not unless. And her ladyship's afraid it won't be allowed.\"\n\n\"She'll make him go in costume,\" thought Lady Tranmore. \"And he will do\nit, or anything, to avoid a scene.\"\n\nThe maid retired, and Lady Tranmore was left alone. As she sat waiting,\na thought occurred to her. She rang for the butler.\n\n\"Where is the _Times_?\" she asked, when he appeared. The man replied\nthat it was no doubt in Mr. Ashe's room, and he would bring it.\n\n\"Kitty has probably not looked at it,\" thought the visitor. When the\npaper arrived she turned at once to the Parliamentary report. It\ncontained an important speech by Ashe in the House the night before.\nLady Tranmore had been disturbed in the reading of it that morning, and\nhad still a few sentences to finish. She read them with pride, then\nglanced again at the leading article on the debate, and at the\nflattering references it contained to the knowledge, courtesy, and\ndebating power of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\n\n\"Mr. Ashe,\" said the _Times_, \"has well earned the promotion he is now\nsure to receive before long. In those important rearrangements of some\nof the higher offices which cannot be long delayed, Mr. Ashe is clearly\nmarked out for a place in the cabinet. He is young, but he has already\ndone admirable service; and there can be no question that he has a great\nfuture before him.\"\n\nLady Tranmore put down the paper and fell into a reverie. A great\nfuture? Yes--if Kitty permitted--if Kitty could be managed. At present\nit appeared to William's mother that the caprices of his wife were\nendangering the whole development of his career. There were wheels\nwithin wheels, and the newspapers knew very little about them.\n\nThree years, was it, since the marriage? She looked back to her dismay\nwhen William brought her the news, though it seemed to her that in some\nsort she had foreseen it from the moment of his first mention of Kitty\nBristol--with its eager appeal to her kindness, and that new and\nindefinable something in voice and manner which put her at once on the\nalert.\n\nOught she to have opposed it more strongly? She had, indeed, opposed it;\nand for a whole wretched week she who had never yet gainsaid him in\nanything had argued and pleaded with her son, attempting at the same\ntime to bring in his uncles to wrestle with him, seeing that his poor\nparalyzed father was of no account, and so to make a stubborn family\nfight of it. But she had been simply disarmed and beaten down by\nWilliam's sweetness, patience, and good-humor. Never had he been so\ndetermined, and never so lovable.\n\nIt had been made abundantly plain to her that no wife, however exacting\nand adorable, should ever rob her, his mother, of one tittle of his old\naffection--nay, that, would she only accept Kitty, only take the little\nforlorn creature into the shelter of her motherly arms, even a more\ntender and devoted attention than before, on the part of her son, would\nbe surely hers. He spoke, moreover, the language of sound sense about\nhis proposed bride. That he was in love, passionately in love, was\nevident; but there were moments when he could discuss Kitty, her family,\nher bringing-up, her gifts and defects, with the same cool acumen, the\nsame detachment, apparently, he might have given, say, to the Egyptian\nor the Balkan problem. Lady Tranmore was not invited to bow before a\ndivinity; she was asked to accept a very gifted and lovely child, often\ntroublesome and provoking, but full of a glorious promise which only\npersons of discernment, like herself and Ashe, could fully realize. He\ntold her, with a laugh, that she could never have behaved even tolerably\nto a stupid daughter-in-law. Whereas, let London and society and a few\nyears of love and living do their work, and Kitty would make one of the\nleading women of her time, as Lady Tranmore had been before her. \"You'll\nhelp her, you'll train her, you'll put her in the way,\" he had said,\nkissing his mother's hand. \"And you'll see that in the end we shall both\nof us be so conceited to have had the making of her there'll be no\nholding us.\"\n\nWell, she had yielded--of course she had yielded. She had explained the\nmatter, so far as she could, to the dazed wits of her paralyzed husband.\nShe had propitiated the family on both sides; she had brought Kitty to\nstay with her, and had advised on the negotiations which banished Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es from London and the British Isles, in return for a handsome\nallowance and the payment of her debts; and, finally, she had with\ndifficulty allowed the Grosvilles to provide the trousseau and arrange\nthe marriage from Grosville Park, so eager had she grown in her accepted\ntask.\n\nAnd there had been many hours of high reward. Kitty had thrown herself\nat first upon William's mother with all the effusion possible. She had\nbeen docile, caressing, brilliant. Lady Tranmore had become almost as\nproud of her gifts, her social effect, and her fast advancing beauty as\nAshe himself. Kitty's whims and humors; her passion for this person, and\nher hatred of that; her love of splendor and indifference to debt; her\ncontempt of opinion and restraint, seemed to her, as to Ashe, the mere\ncrude growth of youth. When she looked at Ashe, so handsome, agreeable,\nand devoted, at his place and prestige in the world, his high\nintelligence and his personal attraction, Ashe's mother must needs think\nthat Kitty's mere cleverness would soon reveal to her her extraordinary\ngood-fortune; and that whereas he was now at her feet, she before long\nwould be at his.\n\nThree years! Lady Tranmore looked back upon them with feelings that\nwavered like smoke before a wind. A year of excitement, a year of\nillness, a year of extravagance, shaken moreover by many strange gusts\nof temper and caprice, it was so she might have summarized them. First,\na most promising d\u00c3\u00a9but in London. Kitty welcomed on all hands with\nenthusiasm as Ashe's wife and her own daughter-in-law, f\u00c3\u00aated to the top\nof her bent, smiled on at Court, flattered by the country-houses, always\nexquisitely dressed, smiling and eager, apparently full of ambition for\nAshe no less than for herself, a happy, notorious, busy little person,\nwith a touch of wildness that did but give edge to her charm and keep\nthe world talking.\n\nThen, the birth of the boy, and Kitty's passionate, ungovernable recoil\nfrom the deformity that showed itself almost immediately after his\nbirth--a form of infantile paralysis involving a slight but incurable\nlameness. Lady Tranmore could recall weeks of remorseful fondling,\nalternating with weeks of neglect; continued illness and depression on\nKitty's part, settling after a while into a petulant melancholy for\nwhich the baby's defect seemed but an inadequate cause; Ashe's tender\nanxiety, his willingness to throw up Parliament, office, everything,\nthat Kitty might travel and recover; and those huge efforts by which she\nand his best friends in the House had held him back--when Kitty, it\nseemed, cared little or nothing whether he sacrificed his future or not.\nFinally, she herself, with the assistance of a new friend of Kitty's,\nhad become Kitty's nurse, had taken her abroad when Ashe could not be\nspared, had watched over her, and humored her, and at last brought her\nback--so the doctors said--restored.\n\nWas it really recovery? At any rate, Lady Tranmore was often inclined to\nthink that since the return to London--now about a twelvemonth\nsince--both she and William had had to do with a different Kitty. Young\nas she still was, the first exquisite softness of the expanding life was\ngone; things harder, stranger, more inexplicable than any which those\nwho knew her best had yet perceived, seemed now and then to come to the\nsurface, like wreckage in a summer sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe opening door disturbed these ponderings. The nurse appeared,\ncarrying the little boy. Lady Tranmore took him on her knee and caressed\nhim. He was a piteous, engaging child, generally very docile, but liable\nat times to storms of temper out of all proportion to the fragility of\nhis small person. His grandmother was inclined to look upon his passions\nas something external and inflicted--the entering-in of the Blackwater\ndevil to plague a tiny creature that, normally, was of a divine and\nclinging sweetness. She would have taught him religion, as his only\nshield against himself; but neither his father nor his mother was\nreligious; and Harry was likely to grow up a pagan.\n\nHe leaned now against her breast, and she, whose inmost nature was\nmaternity, delighted in the pressure of the tiny body, crooning songs to\nhim when they were left alone, and pausing now and then to pity and kiss\nthe little shrunken foot that hung beside the other.\n\nShe was interrupted by a soft entrance and the rustle of a dress.\n\n\"Ah, Margaret!\" she said, looking round and smiling.\n\nThe girl who had come in approached her, shook hands, and looked down at\nthe baby. She was fair-haired and wore spectacles; her face was round\nand childish, her eyes round and blue, with certain lines about them,\nhowever, which showed that she was no longer in her first youth.\n\n\"I came to see if I could do anything to-day for Kitty. I know she is\nvery busy about the ball--\"\n\n\"Head over ears apparently,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"Everybody has lost\ntheir wits. I see Kitty has chosen her dress.\"\n\n\"Yes, if Fanchette can make it all right. Poor Kitty! She has been in\nsuch a state of mind. I think I'll go on with these invitations.\"\n\nAnd, taking off her gloves and hat, Margaret French went to the\nwriting-table like one intimately acquainted with the room and its\naffairs, took up a pile of cards and envelopes which lay upon it, and,\nbringing them to Lady Tranmore's side, began to work upon them.\n\n\"I did about half yesterday,\" she explained; \"but I see Kitty hasn't\nbeen able to touch them, and it is really time they were out.\"\n\n\"For their party next week?\"\n\n\"Yes. I hope Kitty won't tire herself out. It has been a rush lately.\"\n\n\"Does she ever rest?\"\n\n\"Never--as far as I can see. And I am afraid she has been very much\nworried.\"\n\n\"About that silly affair with Prince Stephan?\" said Lady Tranmore.\n\nMargaret French nodded. \"She vows that she meant no harm, and did no\nharm, and that it has been all malice and exaggeration. But one can see\nshe has been hurt.\"\n\n\"Well, if you ask me,\" said Lady Tranmore, in a low voice, \"I think she\ndeserved to be.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, the girl's full of a half-smiling, half-soft\nconsideration. Lady Tranmore, on the other hand, had flushed proudly, as\nthough the mere mention of the matter to which she had referred had been\ngalling to her. Kitty, in fact, had just been guilty of an escapade\nwhich had set the town talking, and even found its way here and there in\nthe newspapers. The heir to a European monarchy had been recently\nvisiting London. A romantic interest surrounded him; for a lady, not of\na rank sufficiently high to mate with his, had lately drowned herself\nfor love of him, and the young man's melancholy good looks, together\nwith the magnificent apathy of his manner, drew after him a chain of\ngossip. Kitty failed to meet him in society; certain invitations that\nfor once she coveted did not arrive; and in a fit of pique she declared\nthat she would make acquaintance with him in her own way. On a certain\noccasion, when the Princeling was at the play, his attention was drawn\nto a small and dazzling creature in a box opposite his own. Presently,\nhowever, there was a commotion in this box. The dazzling creature had\nfainted; and rumor sent round the name of Lady Kitty Ashe. The Prince\ndespatched an equerry to make inquiries, and the inquiries were repeated\nthat evening in Hill Street. Recovery was prompt, and the Prince let it\nbe known that he wished to meet the lady. Invitations from high quarters\ndescended upon Kitty; she bore herself with an engaging carelessness,\nand the melancholy youth was soon spending far more pains upon her than\nhe had yet been known to spend upon any other English beauties presented\nto him. Ashe and Kitty's friends laughed; the old general in charge of\nthe Princeling took alarm. And presently Kitty's audacities, alack,\ncarried away her discretion; she began, moreover, to boast of her ruse.\nWhispers crept round; and the general's ears were open. In a few days\nKitty's triumph went the way of all earthly things. At a Court ball, to\nwhich her vanity had looked forward, unwarned, the Prince passed her\nwith glassy eyes, returning the barest bow to her smiling courtesy. She\nbetrayed nothing; but somehow the thing got out, and set in motion a\nperfect hurricane of talk. It was rumored that the old Prime Minister,\nLord Parham, had himself said a caustic word to Lady Kitty, that Royalty\nwas annoyed, and that William Ashe had for once scolded his wife\nseriously.\n\nLady Tranmore was well aware that there was, at any rate, no truth in\nthe last report; but she also knew that there was a tone of sharpness in\nthe London chatter that was new with regard to Kitty. It was as though a\ncertain indulgence was wearing out, and what had been amusement was\npassing into criticism.\n\nShe and Margaret French discussed the matter a little, _sotto voce_,\nwhile Margaret went on with the invitations and Lady Tranmore made a\nFrench toy dance and spin for the babe's amusement. Their tone was one\nof close and friendly intimacy, an intimacy based clearly upon one\ncommon interest--their relation to Kitty. Margaret French was one of\nthose beings in whom, for our salvation, this halting, hurried world of\nours is still on the whole rich. She was unmarried, thirty-five, and\npoor. She lived with her brother, a struggling doctor, and she had come\nacross Kitty in the first months of Kitty's married life, on some\nfashionable Soldiers' Aid Committee, where Margaret had done the work\nand Kitty with the other great ladies had reaped the fame. Kitty had\ndeveloped a fancy for her, and presently could not live without her. But\nMargaret, though it soon became evident that she had taken Kitty and, in\ndue time, the child--Ashe, too, for the matter of that--deep into her\ngenerous heart, preserved a charming measure in the friendship offered\nher. She would owe Kitty nothing, either socially or financially. When\nKitty's smart friends appeared, she vanished. Nobody in her own world\never heard her mention the name of Lady Kitty Ashe, largely as that name\nwas beginning to figure in the gossip of the day. But there were few\nthings concerning the Hill Street m\u00c3\u00a9nage that Lady Tranmore could not\nsafely and rightly discuss with her; and even Ashe himself went to her\nfor counsel.\n\n\"I am afraid this has made things worse than ever with the Parhams,\"\nsaid Lady Tranmore, presently.\n\nMargaret shook her head anxiously.\n\n\"I hope Kitty won't throw over their dinner next week.\"\n\n\"She is talking of it!\"\n\n\"Yesterday she had almost made up her mind,\" said Margaret, reluctantly.\n\"Perhaps you will persuade her. But she has been terribly angry with\nLord Parham--and with Lady P., too.\"\n\n\"And it was to be a reconciliation dinner, after the old nonsense\nbetween her and Lady Parham,\" sighed Lady Tranmore. \"It was planned for\nKitty entirely. And she is to act something, isn't she, with that young\nDe La Rivi\u00c3\u00a8re from the embassy? I believe the Princess is\ncoming--expressly to meet her. I have been hearing of it on all sides.\nShe _can't_ throw it over!\"\n\nMargaret shrugged her shoulders. \"I believe she will.\"\n\nThe older lady's face showed a sudden cloud of indignation.\n\n\"William must really put his foot down,\" she said, in a low, decided\nvoice. \"It is, of course, most important--just now--\"\n\nShe said no more, but Margaret French looked up, and they exchanged\nglances.\n\n\"Let's hope,\" said Margaret, \"that Mr. Ashe will be able to pacify her.\nAh, there she is.\"\n\nFor the front door closed heavily, and instantly the house was aware\nfrom top to toe of a flutter of talk and a frou-frou of skirts. Kitty\nran up the stairs and into the drawing-room, still talking, apparently,\nto the footman behind her, and stopped short at the sight of Lady\nTranmore and Margaret. A momentary shadow passed across her face; then\nshe came forward all smiles.\n\n\"Why, they never told me down-stairs!\" she said, taking a hand of each\ncaressingly, and slipping into a seat between them. \"Have I lost much of\nyou?\"\n\n\"Well, I must soon be off,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"Harry has been\nentertaining me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harry; is he there?\" said Kitty, in another voice, perceiving the\nchild behind his grandmother's dress as he sat on the floor, where Lady\nTranmore had just deposited him.\n\nThe baby turned towards his beautiful mother, and, as he saw her, a\nlittle wandering smile began to spread from his uncertain lips to his\ndeep-brown eyes, till his whole face shone, held to hers as to a magnet,\nin a still enchantment.\n\n\"Come!\" said Kitty, holding out her hands.\n\nWith difficulty the child pulled himself towards her, moving in sideway\nfashion along the floor, and dragging the helpless foot after him. Again\nthe shadow crossed Kitty's face. She caught him up, kissed him, and\nmoved to ring the bell.\n\n\"Shall I take him up-stairs?\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Why, he seems to have only just come down!\" said Lady Tranmore. \"Must\nhe go?\"\n\n\"He can come down again afterwards,\" said Kitty. \"I want to talk to you.\nTake him, Margaret.\"\n\nThe babe went without a whimper, still following his mother with his\neyes.\n\n\"He looks rather frail,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"I hope you'll soon be\nsending him to the country, Kitty.\"\n\n\"He's very well,\" said Kitty. Then she took off her hat and looked at\nthe invitations Margaret had been writing.\n\n\"Heavens, I had forgotten all about them! What an angel is Margaret! I\nreally can't remember these things. They ought to do themselves by\nclock-work. And now Fanchette and this ball are enough to drive one\nwild.\"\n\nShe lifted her hands to her face and pressed back the masses of fair\nhair that were tumbling round it, with a gesture of weariness.\n\n\"Fanchette can make your dress?\"\n\n\"She says she will, but I couldn't make her understand anything I\nwanted. She is off her head! They all are. By-the-way, did you hear of\nMadeleine Alcot's. telegram to Worth?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nKitty laughed--a laugh musical but malicious. Mrs. Alcot, married in the\nsame month as herself, had been her companion and rival from the\nbeginning. They called each other \"Kitty\" and \"Madeleine,\" and saw each\nother frequently; why, Lady Tranmore could never discover, unless on the\nprinciple that it is best to keep your enemy under observation.\n\n\"She telegraphed to Worth as soon as her invitation arrived, 'Envoyez\ntout de suite costume V\u00c3\u00a9nus. R\u00c3\u00a9ponse.' The answer came at dinner--she\nhad a dinner-party--and she read it aloud: 'Remerc\u00c3\u00aements. Il n'y en a\npas.' Isn't it delightful?\"\n\n\"Very neat,\" said Lady Tranmore, smiling. \"When did you invent that?\nYou, I hear, are to be Diana?\"\n\nKitty made a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Ask Fanchette--it depends on her. There is no one but she in London who\ncan do it. Oh, by-the-way, what's Mary going to be? I suppose a Madonna\nof sorts.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Lady Tranmore, dryly; \"she has chosen a Sir Joshua\ncostume I found for her.\"\n\n\"A vocation missed,\" said Kitty, shaking her head. \"She ought to have\nbeen a 'Vestal Virgin' at least.... Do you know that you look _such_ a\nduck this afternoon!\" The speaker put up two small hands and pulled and\npatted at the black lace strings of Lady Tranmore's hat, which were tied\nunder the delicately wrinkled white of her very distinguished chin.\n\n\"This hat suits you so--you are such a _grande dame_ in it. Ah! Je\nt'adore!\"\n\nAnd Kitty softly took the chin aforesaid into her hands, and dropped a\nkiss on Lady Tranmore's cheek, which reddened a little under the sudden\ncaress.\n\n\"Don't be a goose, Kitty.\" But Elizabeth Tranmore stooped forward all\nthe same and returned the kiss heartily. \"Now tell me what you're going\nto wear at the Parhams'.\"\n\nKitty rose deliberately, went to the bell and rang it.\n\n\"It must be quite time for tea.\"\n\n\"You haven't answered my question, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" The butler entered. \"Tea, please, Wilson, at once.\"\n\n\"Kitty!--\"\n\nLady Kitty seated herself defiantly a short distance from her\nmother-in-law and crossed her hands on her lap.\n\n\"I am not going to the Parhams'.\"\n\n\"Kitty!--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am not going to the Parhams',\" repeated Kitty, slowly. \"They should\nbehave a little more considerately to me if they want to get me to amuse\ntheir guests for them.\"\n\nAt this moment Margaret French re-entered the room. Lady Tranmore turned\nto her with a gesture of distress.\n\n\"Oh, Margaret knows,\" said Kitty. \"I told her yesterday.\"\n\n\"The Parhams?\" said Margaret.\n\nKitty nodded. Margaret paused, with her hand on the back of Lady\nTranmore's chair, and there was a short silence. Then Lady Tranmore\nbegan, in a tone that endeavored not to be too serious:\n\n\"I don't know how you're going to get out of it, my dear. Lady Parham\nhas asked the Princess, first because she wished to come, secondly as an\nolive-branch to you. She has taken the greatest pains about the dinner;\nand afterwards there is to be an evening party to hear you, just the\nright size, and just the right people.\"\n\n\"Cela m'est \u00c3\u00a9gal,\" said Kitty, \"par-faite-ment \u00c3\u00a9gal! I am not going.\"\n\n\"What possible excuse can you invent?\"\n\n\"I shall have a cold, the most atrocious cold imaginable. I take to my\nbed just two hours before it is time to dress. My letter reaches Lady\nParham on the stroke of eight.\"\n\n\"Kitty, you would be doing a thing perfectly unheard of--most rude--most\nunkind!\"\n\nThe stiff, slight figure, like a strained wand, did not waver for a\nmoment before the grave indignation of the older woman.\n\n\"I should for once be paying off a score that has run on too long.\"\n\n\"You and Lady Parham had agreed to make friends, and let bygones be\nbygones.\"\n\n\"That was before last week.\"\n\n\"Before Lord Parham said--what annoyed you?\"\n\nKitty's eyes flamed.\n\n\"Before Lord Parham humiliated me in public--or tried to.\"\n\n\"Dear Kitty, he was annoyed, and said a sharp thing; but he is an old\nman, and for William's sake, surely, you can forgive it. And Lady Parham\nhad nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"She has not written to me to apologize,\" said Kitty, with a most\nvenomous calm. \"Don't talk about it, mother. It will hurt you, and I am\ndetermined. Lady Parham has patronized or snubbed me ever since I\nmarried--when she hasn't been setting my best friends against me. She is\nfalse, false, _false_!\" Kitty struck her hands together with an emphatic\ngesture. \"And Lord Parham said a thing to me last week I shall never\nforgive. Voil\u00c3\u00a0! Now I mean to have done with it!\"\n\n\"And you choose to forget altogether that Lord Parham is William's\npolitical chief--that William's affairs are in a critical state, and\neverything depends on Lord Parham--that it is not seemly, not possible,\nthat William's wife should publicly slight Lady Parham, and through her\nthe Prime Minister--at this moment of all moments.\"\n\nLady Tranmore breathed fast.\n\n\"William will not expect me to put up with insults,\" said Kitty, also\nbeginning to show emotion.\n\n\"But can't you see that--just now especially--you ought to think of\nnothing--_nothing_--but William's future and William's career?\"\n\n\"William will never purchase his career at my expense.\"\n\n\"Kitty, dear, listen,\" cried Lady Tranmore, in despair, and she threw\nherself into arguments and appeals to which Kitty listened quite unmoved\nfor some twenty minutes. Margaret French, feeling herself an\nuncomfortable third, tried several times to steal away. In vain. Kitty's\nperemptory hand retained her. She could not escape, much as she wished\nit, from the wrestle between the two women--on the one side the mother,\nnoble, already touched with age, full of dignity and protesting\naffection; on the other the wife, still little more than a child in\nyears, vibrating through all her slender frame with passion and\ninsolence, more beautiful than usual by virtue of the very fire which\npossessed her--a m\u00c3\u00a6nad at bay.\n\nLady Tranmore had just begun to waver in a final despair when the door\nopened and William Ashe entered.\n\nHe looked in astonishment at his mother and wife. Then in a flash he\nunderstood, and, with an involuntary gesture of fatigue, he turned to\ngo.\n\n\"William!\" cried his mother, hurrying after him, \"don't go. Kitty and I\nwere disputing; but it is nothing, dear! Don't go, you look so tired.\nCan you stay for dinner?\"\n\n\"Well, that was my intention,\" said Ashe, with a smile, as he allowed\nhimself to be brought back. \"But Kitty seems in the clouds.\"\n\nFor Kitty had not moved an inch to greet him. She sat in a high-back\nchair, one foot crossed over the other, one hand supporting her cheek,\nlooking straight before her with shining eyes.\n\nLady Tranmore laid a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"We won't talk any more about it now, Kitty, will we?\"\n\nKitty's pinched lips opened enough to emit the words:\n\n\"Perhaps William had better understand--\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" cried Ashe. \"Is it the Parhams? Send them, Kitty, if you\nplease, to ten thousand _diables_! You won't go to their dinner? Well,\ndon't go! Please yourself--and hang the expense! Come and give me some\ndinner--there's a dear.\"\n\nHe bent over her and kissed her hair.\n\nLady Tranmore began to speak; then, with a mighty effort, restrained\nherself and began to look for her parasol. Kitty did not move. Lady\nTranmore said a muffled good-bye and went. And this time Margaret French\ninsisted on going with her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Ashe returned to the drawing-room, he found his wife still in the\nsame position, very pale and very wild.\n\n\"I have told your mother, William, what I intend to do about the\nParhams.\"\n\n\"Very well, dear. Now she knows.\"\n\n\"She says it will ruin your career.\"\n\n\"Did she? We'll talk about that presently. We have had a nasty scene in\nthe House with the Irishmen, and I'm famished. Go and change, there's a\ndear. Dinner's just coming in.\"\n\nKitty went reluctantly. She came down in a white, flowing garment, with\na small green wreath in her hair, which, together with the air of a\nstorm which still enwrapped her, made her more m\u00c3\u00a6nad-like than ever.\nAshe took no notice, gave her a laughing account of what had passed in\nthe House, and ate his dinner.\n\nAfterwards, when they were alone, and he was just about to return to the\nHouse, she made a swift rush across the dining-room, and caught his coat\nwith both hands.\n\n\"William, I can't go to that dinner--it would kill me!\"\n\n\"How you repeat yourself, darling!\" he said, with a smile. \"I suppose\nyou'll give Lady Parham decent notice. What'll you do? Get a doctor's\ncertificate and go away?\"\n\nKitty panted. \"Not at all. I shall not tell her till an hour before.\"\n\nAshe whistled.\n\n\"War? I see. Open war. Very well. Then we shall get to Venice for\nEaster.\"\n\nKitty fell back.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Very plain, isn't it? But what does it matter? Venice will be\ndelightful, and there are plenty of good men to take my place.\"\n\n\"Lord Parham would pass you over?\"\n\n\"Not at all. But I can't work in public with a man whom I must cut in\nprivate. It wouldn't amuse me. So if you're decided, Kitty, write to\nDanieli's for rooms.\"\n\nHe lit his cigarette, and went out with a perfect nonchalance and\ngood-temper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty was to have gone to a ball. She countermanded her maid's\npreparations, and sent the maid to bed. In due time all the servants\nwent to bed, the front door being left on the latch as usual for Ashe's\nlate return. About midnight a little figure slipped into the child's\nnursery. The nurse was fast asleep. Kitty sat beside the child,\nmotionless, for an hour, and when Ashe let himself into the house about\ntwo o'clock he heard a little rustle in the hall, and there stood Kitty,\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"Kitty, what are you about?\" he said, in pretended amazement. But in\nreality he was not astonished at all. His life for months past had been\npitched in a key of extravagance and tumult. He had been practically\ncertain that he should find Kitty in the hall.\n\nWith great tenderness he half led, half carried her up-stairs. She clung\nto him as passionately as, before dinner, she had repulsed him. When\nthey reached their room, the tired man, dropping with sleep, after a\nParliamentary wrestle in which every faculty had been taxed to the\nutmost, took his wife in his arms; and there Kitty sobbed and talked\nherself into a peace of complete exhaustion. In this state she was one\nof the most exquisite of human beings, with words, tone, and gestures of\na heavenly softness and languor. The evil spirit went out of her, and\nshe was all ethereal tenderness, sadness, and remorse. For more than two\nyears, scenes like this had, in Ashe's case, melted into final delight\nand intoxication which more than effaced the memory of what had gone\nbefore. Now for several months he had dreaded the issue of the crisis,\nno less than the crisis itself. It left him unnerved as though some\nmorbid sirocco had passed over him.\n\nWhen Kitty at last had fallen asleep, Ashe stood for some time beside\nhis dressing-room window, looking absently into the cloudy night, too\ntired even to undress. A gusty northwest wind tore down the street and\nbeat against the windows. The unrest without increased the tension of\nhis mind and body. Like Lady Tranmore, he had, as it were, stepped back\nfrom his life, and was looking at it--the last three years of it in\nparticular--as a whole. What was the net result of those years? Where\nwas he? Whither were he and Kitty going? A strange pang shot through\nhim. The mere asking of the question had been as the lifting of the lamp\nof Psyche.\n\nThe scene that night in the House of Commons had been for him a scene of\nconflict; in the main, also, of victory. His virile powers, capacities,\nand ambitions had been at their height. He had felt the full spell of\nthe English political life, with all its hard fighting joy, the\nexhilaration which flows from the vastness of the interests on which it\nturns, and the intricate appeal it makes, in the case of a man like\nhimself, to a hundred inherited aptitudes, tastes, and traditions.\n\nAnd here he stood in the darkness, wondering whether indeed the best of\nhis life were not over--the prey of forebodings as strong and vagrant as\nthe gusts outside.\n\nBirds of the night! He forced himself to bed, and slept heavily. When he\nwoke up, the May sun was shining into his room. Kitty, in the freshest\nof morning dresses, was sitting on his bed like a perching bird, waiting\nimpatiently till his eyes should open and she could ask him his opinion\non her dress for the ball. The savor and joy of life returned upon him\nin a flood. Kitty was the prettiest thing ever seen; he had scored off\nthose Tory fellows the night before; the Parhams' dinner was all right;\nand life was once more kind, manageable, and full of the most agreeable\npossibilities. A certain indolent impatience in him recoiled from the\nmere recollection of the night before. The worry was over; why think of\nit again?\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nMeanwhile Lady Tranmore had reached home, and after one of those\npathetic hours in her husband's room which made the secret and sacred\nfoundation of her daily life, she expected Mary Lyster, who was to dine\nat Tranmore House before the two ladies presented themselves at a\nmusical party given by the French Ambassadress. Before her guest's\narrival, Lady Tranmore wandered about her rooms, unable to rest, unable\neven to read the evening papers on Ashe's speech, so possessed was she\nstill by her altercation with Kitty, and by the foreboding sense of what\nit meant. William's future was threatened; and the mother whose whole\nproud heart had been thrown for years into every successful effort and\nevery upward step of her son, was up in arms.\n\nMary Lyster arrived to the minute. She came in, a tall gliding woman,\nher hair falling in rippled waves on either side of her face, which in\nits ample comeliness and placidity reminded the Italianate Lady Tranmore\nof many faces well known to her in early Siennese or Florentine art.\nMary's dress to-night was of a noble red, and the glossy brown of her\nhair made a harmony both with her dress and with the whiteness of her\nneck that contented the fastidious eye of her companion. \"Polly\" was now\nthirty, in the prime of her good looks. Lady Tranmore's affection for\nher, which had at one time even included the notion that she might\npossibly become William Ashe's wife, did not at all interfere with a\nshrewd understanding of her limitations. But she was daughterless\nherself; her family feeling was strong; and Mary's society was an old\nand pleasant habit one could ill have parted with. In her company,\nmoreover, Mary was at her best.\n\nElizabeth Tranmore never discussed her daughter-in-law with her cousin.\nLoyalty to William forbade it, no less than a strong sense of family\ndignity. For Mary had spoken once--immediately after the\nengagement--with energy--nay, with passion; prophesying woe and\ncalamity. Thenceforward it was tacitly agreed between them that all\nroot-and-branch criticism of Kitty and her ways was taboo. Mary was,\nindeed, on apparently good terms with her cousin's wife. She dined\noccasionally at the Ashes', and she and Kitty met frequently under the\nwing of Lady Tranmore. There was no cordiality between them, and Kitty\nwas often sharply or sulkily certain that Mary was to be counted among\nthose hostile forces with which, in some of her moods, the world seemed\nto her to bristle. But if Mary kept, in truth, a very sharp tongue for\nmany of her intimates on the subject of Kitty, Lady Tranmore at least\nwas determined to know nothing about it.\n\nOn this particular evening, however, Lady Tranmore's self-control failed\nher, for the first time in three years. She had not talked five minutes\nwith her guest before she perceived that Mary's mind was, in truth,\nbrimful of gossip--the gossip of many drawing-rooms--as to Kitty's\nescapade with the Prince, Kitty's relations to Lady Partham, Kitty's\nparties, and Kitty's whims. The temptation was too great; her own guard\nbroke down.\n\n\"I hear Kitty is furious with the Parhams,\" said Mary, as the two ladies\nsat together after their rapid dinner. It was a rainy night, and the\nfire to which they had drawn up was welcome.\n\nLady Tranmore shook her head sadly.\n\n\"I don't know where it is to end,\" she said, slowly.\n\n\"Lady Parham told me yesterday--you don't mind my repeating it?\"--Mary\nlooked up with a smile--\"she was still dreadfully afraid that Kitty\nwould play her some trick about next Friday. She knows that Kitty\ndetests her.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Lady Tranmore, in a vague voice, \"Kitty\ncouldn't--impossible!\"\n\nMary turned an observant eye upon her companion's conscious and troubled\nair, and drew conclusions not far from the truth.\n\n\"And it's all so awkward, isn't it?\" she said, with sympathy, \"when\napparently Lady Parham is as much Prime Minister as he is.\"\n\nFor in those days certain great houses and political ladies, though not\nat the zenith of their power, were still, in their comparative decline,\nvery much to be reckoned with. When Lady Parham talked longer than usual\nwith the French Ambassador, his Austrian and German colleagues wrote\nanxious despatches to their governments; when a special mission to the\nEast of great importance had to be arranged, nobody imagined that Lord\nParham had very much to do with the appointment of the commissioner, who\nhappened to have just engaged himself to Lady Parham's second girl. No\nyoung member on the government side, if he wanted office, neglected\nLady Parham's invitations, and admission to her more intimate dinners\nwas still almost as much coveted as similar favors had been a generation\nbefore in the case of Lady Jersey, or still earlier, in that of Lady\nHolland. She was a small old woman, with a shrewish face, a waxen\ncomplexion, and a brown wig. In spite of short sight, she saw things\nthat escaped most other people; her tongue was rarely at a loss; she\nwas, on the whole, a good friend, though never an unreflecting one; and\nwhat she forgave might be safely reckoned as not worth resenting.\n\nElizabeth Tranmore received Mary's remark with reluctant consent. Lady\nParham--from the English aristocratic stand-point--was not well-born.\nShe had been the daughter of a fashionable music-master, whose blood was\ncertainly not Christian. And there were many people beside Lady Tranmore\nwho resented her domination.\n\n\"It will be so perfectly easy when the moment comes to invent some\nexcuse or other for shelving William's claims,\" sighed Ashe's mother.\n\"Nobody is indispensable, and if that old woman is provoked, she will be\ncapable of any mischief.\"\n\n\"What do you want for William?\" said Mary, smiling.\n\n\"He ought, of course, to have the Home Office!\" replied Lady Tranmore,\nwith fire.\n\nMary vowed that he would certainly have it. \"Kitty is so clever, she\nwill understand how important discretion is, before things go too far.\"\n\nLady Tranmore made no answer. She gazed into the fire, and Miss Lyster\nthought her depressed.\n\n\"Has William ever interfered?\" she asked, cautiously.\n\nLady Tranmore hesitated.\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" she said, at last. \"Nor will he ever--in the sense\nin which any ordinary husband would interfere.\"\n\n\"I know! It is as though he had a kind of superstition about it. Isn't\nthere a fairy story, in which an elf marries a mortal on condition that\nif he ever ill-treats her, her people will fetch her back to fairyland?\nOne day the husband lost his temper and spoke crossly; instantly there\nwas a crash of thunder and the elf-wife vanished.\"\n\n\"I don't remember the story. But it's like that--exactly. He said to me\nonce that he would never have asked her to marry him if he had not been\nable to make up his mind to let her have her own way--never to coerce\nher.\"\n\nBut having said this, Lady Tranmore repented. It seemed to her she had\nbeen betraying William's affairs. She drew her chair back from the fire,\nand rang to ask if the carriage had arrived. Mary took the hint. She\narrayed herself in her cloak, and chatted agreeably about other things\ntill the moment for their departure came.\n\nAs they drove through the streets, Lady Tranmore stole a glance at her\ncompanion.\n\n\"She is really very handsome,\" she thought--\"much better-looking than\nshe was at twenty. What are the men about, not to marry her?\"\n\nIt was indeed a puzzle. For Mary was increasingly agreeable as the years\nwent on, and had now quite a position of her own in London, as a\ncharming woman without angles or apparent egotisms; one of the\ninitiated besides, whom any dinner-party might be glad to capture. Her\nrelations, near and distant, held so many of the points of vantage in\nEnglish public life that her word inevitably carried weight. She talked\npolitics, as women of her class must talk them to hold their own; she\nsupported the Church; and she was elegantly charitable, in that popular\nsense which means that you subscribe to your friends' charities without\nsetting up any of your own. She was rich also--already in possession of\na considerable fortune, inherited from her mother, and prospective\nheiress of at least as much again from her father, old Sir Richard\nLyster, whose house in Somersetshire she managed to perfection. In the\nseason she stayed with various friends, or with Lady Tranmore, Sir\nRichard being now infirm, and preferring the country. There was a\nyounger sister, who was known to have married imprudently, and against\nher father's wishes, some five or six years before this. Catharine was\npoor, the wife of a clergyman with young children. Lady Tranmore\nsometimes wondered whether Mary was quite as good to her as she might\nbe. She herself sent Catharine various presents in the course of the\nyear for the children.\n\n--Yes, it was certainly surprising that Mary had not married. Lady\nTranmore's thoughts were running on this tack when of a sudden her eyes\nwere caught by the placard of one of the evening papers.\n\n\"Interview with Mr. Cliffe. Peace assured.\" So ran one of the lines.\n\n\"Geoffrey Cliffe home again!\" Lady Tranmore's tone betrayed a shade of\ncontemptuous amusement.\n\n\"We shall have to get on without our daily telegram. Poor London!\"\n\nIf at that moment it had occurred to her to look at her companion, she\nwould have seen a quick reddening of Mary's cheeks.\n\n\"He has had a great success, though, with his telegrams!\" replied Miss\nLyster. \"I should have thought one couldn't deny that.\"\n\n\"Success! Only with the people who don't matter,\" said Lady Tranmore,\nwith a shrug. \"Of what importance is it to anybody that Geoffrey Cliffe\nshould telegraph his doings and his opinions every morning to the\nEnglish public?\"\n\nWe were in the midst of a disagreement with America. A whirlwind was\nunloosed, and as it happened Geoffrey Cliffe was riding it. For that\ngentleman had not succeeded in the designs which were occupying his mind\nwhen he had first made Kitty's acquaintance in the Grosvilles'\ncountry-house. He had desired an appointment in Egypt; but it had not\nbeen given him, and after some angry restlessness at home, he had once\nmore taken up a pilgrim's staff and departed on fresh travels, bound\nthis time for the Pamirs and Thibet. After nearly three years, during\nwhich he had never ceased, through the newspapers and periodicals, to\nkeep his opinions and his personality before the public, he had been\nheard of in China, and as returning home by America. He arrived at San\nFrancisco just as the dispute had broken out, was at once captured by an\nEnglish paper, and sent to New York, with _carte blanche_. He had risen\nwith alacrity to the situation. Thenceforward for some three weeks,\nEngland found a marvellous series of large-print telegrams, signed\n\"Geoffrey Cliffe,\" awaiting her each morning on her breakfast-table.\n\n\"'The President and I met this morning'--'The President considers, and I\nagree with him'--'I told the President'--etc.--'The President this\nmorning signed and sealed a memorable despatch. He said to me\nafterwards'\"--etc.\n\nTwo diverse effects seemed to have been produced by these proceedings. A\ncertain section of Radical opinion, which likes to see affairs managed\n_sans c\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9monie_, and does not understand what the world wants with\ndiplomatists when journalists are to be had, applauded; the\nold-fashioned laughed.\n\nIt was said that Cliffe was going into the House immediately; the young\nbloods of the party in power enjoyed the prospect, and had already\nstored up the _ego et Rex meus_ details of his correspondence for future\nuse.\n\n\"How could a man make such a fool of himself!\" continued Lady Tranmore,\nthe malice in her voice expressing not only the old aristocratic dislike\nof the press, but also the jealousy natural to the mother of an official\nson.\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said Mary, after a pause. \"I don't quite agree\nwith you, Cousin Elizabeth--indeed, I know there are many people who\nthink that he has certainly done good.\"\n\nLady Tranmore turned in astonishment. She had expected Mary's assent to\nher original remark as a matter of course. Mary's old flirtation with\nGeoffrey Cliffe, and the long breach between them which had followed it,\nwere things well known to her. They had coincided, moreover, with her\nown dropping of the man whom for various reasons she had come to regard\nas unscrupulous and unsafe.\n\n\"Good!\" she echoed--\"_good_?--with that boasting, and that\n_fanfaronnade_. Polly!\"\n\nBut Miss Lyster held her ground.\n\n\"We must allow everybody their own ways of doing things, mustn't we? I\nam quite sure he has meant well--all through.\"\n\nLady Tranmore shrugged her shoulders. \"Lord Parham told me he had had\nthe most grotesque letters from him!--and meant henceforward to put them\nin the fire.\"\n\n\"Very foolish of Lord Parham,\" said Mary, promptly. \"I should have\nthought that a Prime Minister would welcome information--from all sides.\nAnd of course Mr. Cliffe thinks that the government has been _very_\nbadly served.\"\n\nLady Tranmore's wonder broke out. \"You don't mean--that--you hear from\nhim?\"\n\nShe turned and looked full at her companion. Mary's color was still\nraised, but otherwise she betrayed no embarrassment.\n\n\"Yes, dear Cousin Elizabeth. I have heard from him regularly for the\nlast six months. I have often wished to tell you, but I was afraid you\nmight misunderstand me, and--my courage failed me!\" The speaker,\nsmiling, laid her hand on Lady Tranmore's. \"The fact is, he wrote to me\nlast autumn from Japan. You remember that poor cousin of mine who died\nat Tokio? Mr. Cliffe had seen something of him, and he very kindly wrote\nboth to his mother and me afterwards. Then--\"\n\n\"You didn't forgive him!\" cried Lady Tranmore.\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"Was there anything to forgive? We were both young and foolish. Anyway,\nhe interests me--and his letters are splendid.\"\n\n\"Did you ever tell William you were corresponding with him?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! But I want very much to make them understand each other\nbetter. Why shouldn't the government make use of him? He doesn't wish at\nall to be thrown into the arms of the other side. But they treat him so\nbadly--\"\n\n\"My dear Mary! are we governed by the proper people, or are we not?\"\n\n\"It is no good ignoring the press,\" said Mary, holding herself\ngracefully erect. \"And the Bishop quite agrees with me.\"\n\nLady Tranmore sank back in her seat.\n\n\"You discussed it with the Bishop?\" It was now some time since Mary had\nlast brought the family Bishop--her cousin, and Lady Tranmore's--to bear\nupon an argument between them. But Elizabeth knew that his appearance in\nthe conversation invariably meant a _fait accompli_ of some sort.\n\n\"I read him some of Mr. Cliffe's letters,\" said Mary, modestly. \"He\nthought them most remarkable.\"\n\n\"Even when he mocks at missionaries?\"\n\n\"Oh! but he doesn't mock at them any more. He has learned wisdom--I\nassure you he has!\"\n\nLady Tranmore's patience almost departed, Mary's look was so penetrated\nwith indulgence for the prejudices of a dear but unreasonable relation.\nBut she managed to preserve it.\n\n\"And you knew he was coming home?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\" said Mary. \"I meant to have told you at dinner. But something\nput it out of my head--Kitty, of course! I shouldn't wonder if he were\nat the embassy to-night.\"\n\n\"Polly! tell me--\"--Lady Tranmore gripped Miss Lyster's hand with some\nforce--\"are you going to marry him?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" was the smiling reply. \"Don't you think I'm old\nenough by now to have a man friend?\"\n\n\"And you expect me to be civil to him!\"\n\n\"Well, dear Cousin Elizabeth--you know--you never did break with him,\nquite.\"\n\nLady Tranmore, in her bewilderment, reflected that she had certainly\nmeant to complete the process whenever she and Mr. Cliffe should meet\nagain. Aloud she could only say, rather stiffly:\n\n\"I can't forget that William disapproves of him strongly.\"\n\n\"Oh no--excuse me--I don't think he does!\" said Mary, quickly. \"He said\nto me, the other day, that he should be very glad to pick his brains\nwhen he came home. And then he laughed and said he was a 'deuced clever\nfellow'--excuse the adjective--and it was a great thing to be 'as free\nas that chap was'--'without all sorts of boring colleagues and\nresponsibilities.' Wasn't it like William?\"\n\nLady Tranmore sighed.\n\n\"William shouldn't say those things.\"\n\n\"Of course, dear, he was only in fun. But I'll lay you a small wager,\nCousin Elizabeth, that Kitty will ask Mr. Cliffe to lunch as soon as she\nknows he is in town.\"\n\nLady Tranmore turned away.\n\n\"I dare say. No one can answer for what Kitty will do. But Geoffrey\nCliffe has said scandalous things of William.\"\n\n\"He won't say them again,\" said Mary, soothingly. \"Besides, William\nnever minds being abused a bit--does he?\"\n\n\"He should mind,\" said Lady Tranmore, drawing herself up. \"In my young\ndays, our enemies were our enemies and our friends our friends. Nowadays\nnothing seems to matter. You may call a man a scoundrel one day and ask\nhim to dinner the next. We seem to use words in a new sense--and I\nconfess I don't like the change. Well, Mary, I sha'n't, of course, be\nrude to any friend of yours. But don't expect me to be effusive. And\nplease remember that my acquaintance with Geoffrey Cliffe is older than\nyours.\"\n\nMary made a caressing reply, and gave her mind for the rest of the drive\nto the smoothing of Lady Tranmore's ruffled plumes. But it was not easy.\nAs that lady made her way up the crowded staircase of the French\nEmbassy, her fine face was still absent and a little stern.\n\nMary could only reflect that she had at least got through a first\nexplanation which was bound to be made. Then for a few minutes her mind\nsurrendered itself wholly to the question, \"Will he be here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rooms of the French Embassy were already crowded. An ambassador,\nshort, stout, and somewhat morose, his plain features and snub nose\nemerging with difficulty from his thick, fair hair, superabundant beard,\nand mustache--with an elegant and smiling ambassadress, personifying\namid the English crowd that Paris from which through every fibre she\nfelt herself a pining exile--received the guests. The scene was ablaze\nwith uniforms, for the Speaker had been giving a dinner, and Royalty was\nexpected. But, as Lady Tranmore perceived at once, very few members of\nthe House of Commons were present. A hot debate on some detail of the\nnaval estimates had been sprung on ministers, and the whips on each side\nhad been peremptorily keeping their forces in hand.\n\n\"I don't see either William or Kitty,\" said Mary, after a careful\nscrutiny not, in truth, directed to the discovery of the Ashes.\n\n\"No. I suppose William was kept, and Kitty did not care to come alone.\"\n\nMary said nothing. But she was well aware that Kitty was never\nrestrained from going into society by the mere absence of her husband.\nMeanwhile Lady Tranmore was lost in secret anxieties as to what might\nhave happened in Hill Street. Had there been a quarrel? Something\ncertainly had gone wrong, or Kitty would be here.\n\n\"Lady Kitty not arrived?\" said a voice, like a macaw's, beside her.\n\nElizabeth turned and shook hands with Lady Parham. That extraordinary\nwoman, followed everywhere by the attentive observation of the crowd,\nhad never asserted herself more sharply in dress, manner, and coiffure\nthan on this particular evening--so it seemed, at least, to Lady\nTranmore. Her ample figure was robed in the white satin of a bride, her\nwrinkled neck disappeared under a weight of jewels, and her bright\nchestnut wig, to which the diamond tiara was fastened, positively\nattacked the spectator, so patent was it and unashamed. Unashamed, too,\nwere the bold, tyrannous eyes, the rouge-spots on either cheek, the\nstrength of the jaw, the close-shut ability of the mouth. Elizabeth\nTranmore looked at her with a secret passion of dislike. Her English\npride of race, no less than the prejudices of her taste and training,\ncould hardly endure the fact that, for William's sake, she must make\nherself agreeable to Lady Parham.\n\nAgreeable, however, she tried to be. Kitty had seemed to her tired in\nthe afternoon, and had, no doubt, gone to bed--so she averred.\n\nLady Parham laughed.\n\n\"Well, she mustn't be tired the night of my party next week--or the\nskies will fall. I never took so much trouble before about anything in\nmy life.\"\n\n\"No, she must take care,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"Unfortunately, she is not\nstrong, and she does too much.\"\n\nLady Parham threw her a sharp look.\n\n\"Not strong? I should have thought Lady Kitty was made on wires. Well,\nif she fails me, I shall go to bed--with small-pox. There will be\nnothing else to be done. The Princess has actually put off another\nengagement to come--she has heard so much of Lady Kitty's reciting. But\nyou'll help me through, won't you?\"\n\nAnd the wrinkled face and harsh lips fell into a contortion meant for a\nconfidential smile; while through it all the eyes, wholly independent,\nstudied the face beside her--closely, suspiciously--until the owner of\nit in her discomfort could almost have repeated aloud the words that\nwere ringing in her mind--\"I shall _not_ go to Lady Parham's! My note\nwill reach her on the stroke of eight.\"\n\n\"Certainly--I will keep an eye on her!\" she said, lightly. \"But you\nknow--since her illness--\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Lady Parham, impatiently, \"she is very well--very well\nindeed. I never saw her look so radiant. By-the-way, did you hear your\nson's speech the other night? I did not see you in the gallery. A great\npity if you missed it. It was admirable.\"\n\nLady Tranmore replied regretfully that she had not been there, and that\nshe had not been able to have a word with him about it since.\n\n\"Oh, he knows he did well,\" said Lady Parham, carelessly. \"They all do.\nLord Parham was delighted. He could do nothing but talk about it at\ndinner. He says they were in a very tight place, and Mr. Ashe got them\nout.\"\n\nLady Tranmore expressed her gratification with all the dignity she could\ncommand, conscious meanwhile that her companion was not listening to a\nword, absorbed as she was in a hawklike examination of the room through\na pair of gold-rimmed eye-glasses.\n\nSuddenly the eye-glasses fell with a rattle.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" cried Lady Parham. \"Do you see who that is talking to\nMr. Loraine?\"\n\nLady Tranmore looked, and at once perceived Geoffrey Cliffe in close\nconversation with the leader of the Opposition. The lady beside her gave\nan angry laugh.\n\n\"If Mr. Cliffe thinks he has done himself any good by these ridiculous\ntelegrams of his, he will find himself mistaken! People are perfectly\nfurious about them.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"Only that it is a pity to take him\nseriously.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. He has his following; unfortunately, some of our own\nmen are inclined to think that Parham should conciliate him. Ignore him,\nI say. Behave as though he didn't exist. Ah! by-the-way\"--the speaker\nraised herself on tiptoe, and said, in an audacious undertone--\"is it\ntrue that he may possibly marry your cousin, Miss Lyster?\"\n\nLady Tranmore kept a smiling composure. \"Is it true that Lord Parham may\npossibly give him an appointment?\"\n\nLady Parham turned away in annoyance. \"Is that one of the inventions\ngoing about?\"\n\n\"There are so many,\" said Lady Tranmore.\n\nAt that moment, however, to her infinite relief, her companion abruptly\ndeserted her. She was free to observe the two distant figures in\nconversation--Geoffrey Cliffe and Mr. Loraine, the latter a man now\nverging on old age, white-haired and wrinkled, but breathing still\nthrough every feature and every movement the scarcely diminished energy\nof his magnificent prime. He stood with bent head, listening\nattentively, but, as Lady Tranmore thought, coldly, to the arguments\nthat Cliffe was pouring out upon him. Once he looked up in a sudden\nrecoil, and there was a flash from an eye famous for its power of\nmajestic or passionate rebuke. Cliffe, however, took no notice, and\ntalked on, Loraine still listening.\n\n\"Look at them!\" said Lady Parham, venomously, in the ear of one of her\nintimates. \"We shall have all this out in the House to-morrow. The\nOpposition mean to play that man for all he's worth. Mr. Loraine,\ntoo--with his puritanical ways! I know what he thinks of Cliffe. He\nwouldn't _touch_ him in private. But in public--you'll see--he'll\nswallow him whole--just to annoy Parham. There's your politician.\"\n\nAnd stiff with the angry virtue of the \"ins,\" denouncing the faction of\nthe \"outs,\" Lady Parham passed on.\n\nElizabeth Tranmore meanwhile turned to look for Mary Lyster. She found\nher close behind, engaged in a perfunctory conversation, which evidently\nleft her quite free to follow things more exciting. She, too, was\nwatching; and presently it seemed to Lady Tranmore that her eyes met\nwith those of Cliffe. Cliffe paused; abruptly lost the thread of his\nconversation with Mr. Loraine, and began to make his way through the\ncrowded room. Lady Tranmore watched his progress with some attention. It\nwas the progress, clearly, of a man much in the eye and mouth of the\npublic. Whether the atmosphere surrounding him in these rooms was more\nhostile or more favorable, Lady Tranmore could not be quite sure.\nCertainly the women smiled upon him; and his strange face, thinner,\nbrowner, more weather-beaten and life-beaten than ever, under its crest\nof grizzling hair, had the old arrogant and picturesque power, but, as\nit seemed to her, with something added--something subtler, was it, more\nromantic than of yore? which arrested the spectator. Had he really been\nin love with that French woman? Lady Tranmore had heard it rumored that\nshe was dead.\n\nIt was not towards Mary Lyster, primarily, that he was moving, Elizabeth\nsoon discovered; it was towards herself. She braced herself for the\nencounter.\n\nThe greeting was soon over. After she herself had said the appropriate\nthings, Lady Tranmore had time to notice that Mary Lyster, whose turn\ncame next, did not attempt to say them. She looked, indeed, unusually\nhandsome and animated; Lady Tranmore was certain that Cliffe had noticed\nas much, at his first sight of her. But the remarks she omitted showed\nhow minute and recent was their knowledge of each other's movements.\nCliffe himself gave a first impression of high spirits. He declared that\nLondon was more agreeable than he had ever known it, and that after his\nthree years' absence nobody looked a day older. Then he inquired after\nAshe.\n\nLady Tranmore replied that William was well, but hard-worked; she hoped\nto persuade him to get a few days abroad at Whitsuntide. Her manner was\nquiet, without a trace of either discourtesy or effusion. Cliffe began\nto twist his mustache, a sign she knew well. It meant that he was in\ntruth both irritable and nervous.\n\n\"You think they'll last till Whitsuntide?\"\n\n\"The government?\" she said, smiling. \"Certainly--and beyond.\"\n\n\"I give them three weeks,\" said Cliffe, twisting anew, with a vigor that\ngave her a positive physical sympathy with the tortured mustache. \"There\nwill be some papers out to-morrow that will be a bomb-shell.\"\n\n\"About America? Oh, they have been blown up so often! You, for instance,\nhave been doing your best--for months.\"\n\nHis perfunctory laugh answered the mockery of her charming eyes.\n\n\"Well--I wish I could make William hear reason.\"\n\nLady Tranmore held herself stiffly. The Christian name seemed to her an\noffence. It was true that in old days he and Cliffe had been on those\nterms. Now--it was a piece of bad taste.\n\n\"Probably what is reason to you is folly to him,\" she said, dryly.\n\n\"No, no!--he _knows_,\" said Cliffe, with impatience. \"The others don't.\nParham is more impossible--more crassly, grossly ignorant!\" He lifted\nhands and eyes in protest. \"But Ashe, of course, is another matter\naltogether.\"\n\n\"Well, go and see him--go and talk to him!\" said Lady Tranmore, still\nmocking. \"There are no lions in the way.\"\n\n\"None,\" said Cliffe. \"As a matter of fact, Lady Kitty has asked me to\nluncheon. But does one find Ashe himself in the middle of the day?\"\n\nAt the mention of her daughter-in-law Elizabeth made an involuntary\nmovement. Mary, standing beside her, turned towards her and smiled.\n\n\"Not often.\" The tone was cold. \"But you could always find him at the\nHouse.\" And Lady Tranmore moved away.\n\n\"Is there a quiet corner anywhere?\" said Cliffe to Mary. \"I have such\nheaps to tell you.\"\n\nSo while some Polish gentleman in the main drawing-room, whose name\nended in _ski_, challenged his violin to the impossible, Cliffe and Mary\nretired from observation into a small room thrown open with the rest of\nthe suite, which was in truth the morning-room of the ambassadress.\n\nAs soon as they found themselves alone, there was a pause in their\nconversation; each involuntarily looked at the other. Mary certainly\nrecognized that these years of absence had wrought a noticeable change\nin the man before her. He had aged. Hard living and hard travelling had\nleft their marks. But, like Lady Tranmore, she also perceived another\ndifference. The eyes bent upon her were indeed, as before, the eyes of a\nman self-centred, self-absorbed. There was no chivalrous softness in\nthem, no consideration. The man who owned them used them entirely for\nhis own purposes; they betrayed none of that changing instinctive\nrelation towards the human being--any human being--within their range,\nwhich makes the charm of so many faces. But they were sadder, more\nsombre, more restless; they thrilled her more than they had already\nthrilled her once, in the first moment of her youth.\n\nWhat was he going to say? From the moment of his first letter to her\nfrom Japan, Mary had perfectly understood that he had some fresh purpose\nin his mind. She was not anxious, however, to precipitate the moment of\nexplanation. She was no longer the young girl whose equilibrium is upset\nby the mere approach of the man who interests her. Moreover, there was a\npast between herself and Cliffe, the memory of which might indeed point\nher to caution. Did he now, after all, want to marry her--because she\nwas rich, and he was comparatively poor, and could only secure an\nEnglish career at the cost of a well-stored wife? Well, all that should\nbe thought over; by herself no less than by him. Meanwhile her vanity\nglowed within her, as she thus held him there, alone, to the\ndiscomfiture of other women more beautiful and more highly placed than\nherself; as she remembered his letters in her desk at home; and the\nsecrets she imagined him to have told her. Then again she felt a rush of\nsudden disquiet, caused by this new aspect--wavering and remote--as\nthough some hidden grief emerged and vanished. He had the haggard air of\na man who scarcely sleeps. All that she had ever heard of the French\naffair rushed through her mind, stirring there an angry curiosity.\n\nThese impressions took, however, but a few minutes, while they exchanged\nsome conventionalities. Then Cliffe said, scrutinizing the face and form\nbeside him with that intentness which, from him, was more generally\ntaken as compliment than offence:\n\n\"Will you excuse the remark? There are no women who keep their first\nfreshness like Englishwomen.\"\n\n\"Thank you. If we feel fresh, I suppose we look it. As for you, you\nclearly want a rest.\"\n\n\"No time to think of it, then; I have come home to fight--all I know; to\nmake myself as odious as possible.\"\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"You have been doing that so long. Why not try the opposite?\"\n\nCliffe looked at her sharply.\n\n\"You think I have made a failure of it?\"\n\n\"Not at all. You have made everybody furiously uncomfortable, and you\nsee how civil even the Radical papers are to you.\"\n\n\"Yes. What fools!\" said Cliffe, shortly. \"They'll soon leave that off.\nJust now I'm a stick to beat the government with. But you don't believe\nI shall carry my point?\"\n\nThe point concerned a particular detail in a pending negotiation with\nthe United States. Cliffe had been denouncing the government for what he\nconceived to be their coming retreat before American demands. America,\naccording to him, had been playing the bully; and English interests were\nbeing betrayed.\n\nMary considered.\n\n\"I think you will have to change your tactics.\"\n\n\"Dictate them, then.\"\n\nHe bent forward, with that sudden change of manner, that courteous\nsweetness of tone and gesture, which few women could resist. Mary's\nheart, seasoned though it were, felt a charming flutter. She talked, and\nshe talked well. She had no independence of mind, and very little real\nknowledge; but she had an excellent reporter's ability; she knew what to\nremember, and how to tell it. Cliffe listened to her attentively,\nacknowledging to himself the while that she had certainly gained. She\nwas a far more definite personality than she had been when he last knew\nher; and her self-possession, her trained manner, rested him. Thank\nHeaven, she was not a clever woman--how he detested the breed! But she\nwas a useful one. And the smiling commonplace into which she fell so\noften was positively welcome to him. He had known what it was to court a\nwoman who was more than his equal both in mind and passion; and it had\nleft him bitter and broken.\n\n\"Well, all this is most illuminating,\" he said at last. \"I owe you\nimmense thanks.\" And he put out a pair of hands, thin, brown, and\nweather-stained as his face, and pressed one of hers. \"We're very old\nfriends, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Are we?\" said Mary, drawing back.\n\n\"So far as any one can be the friend of a chap like me,\" he said,\nhastily. \"Tell me, are you with Lady Tranmore?\"\n\n\"No. I go to her in a few days--till I leave London.\"\n\n\"Don't go away,\" he said, suddenly and insistently. \"Don't go away.\"\n\nMary could not help a slight wavering in the eyes that perforce met his.\nThen he said, abruptly, as she rose:\n\n\"By-the-way, they tell me Ashe is a great man.\"\n\nShe caught the note of incredulous contempt in his voice and laughed.\n\n\"They say he'll be in the cabinet directly.\"\n\n\"And Lady Kitty, I understand, is a scandal to gods and men, and the\nmost fashionable person in town?\"\n\n\"Oh, not now,\" said Mary. \"That was last year.\"\n\n\"You mean people are tired of her?\"\n\n\"Well, after a time, you know, a naughty child--\"\n\n\"Becomes a bore. Is she a bore? I doubt; I very much doubt.\"\n\n\"Go and see,\" said Mary. \"When do you lunch there?\"\n\n\"I think to-morrow. Shall I find you?\"\n\n\"Oh no. I am not at all intimate with Lady Kitty.\"\n\nCliffe's slight smile, as he followed her into the large drawing-room,\ndied under his mustache. He divined at once the relation between the\ntwo, or thought he did.\n\nAs for Mary, she caught her last sight of Cliffe, standing bareheaded on\nthe steps of the embassy, his lean distinction, his ugly good looks\nmarking him out from the men around him. Then, as they drove away she\nwas glad that the darkness hid her from Lady Tranmore. For suddenly she\ncould not smile. She was filled with the perception that if Geoffrey\nCliffe did not now ask her to marry him, life would utterly lose its\nsavor, its carefully cherished and augmented savor, and youth would\nabandon her. At the same time she realized that she would have to make a\nfight of it, with every weapon she could muster.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n\"Wasn't I expected?\" said Darrell, with a chilly smile.\n\n\"Oh yes, sir--yes, sir!\" said the Ashes' butler, as he looked\ndistractedly round the drawing-room. \"I believe her ladyship will be in\ndirectly. Will you kindly take a seat?\"\n\nThe man's air of resignation convinced Darrell that Lady Kitty had\nprobably gone out without any orders to her servants, and had now\nforgotten all about her luncheon-party--a state of things to which the\nHill Street household was, no doubt, well accustomed.\n\n\"I shall claim some lunch,\" he thought to himself, \"whatever happens.\nThese young people want keeping in their place. Ah!\"\n\nFor he had observed, placed on a small easel, the print of Madame de\nLongueville in costume, and he put up his eye-glass to look at it. He\nguessed at once that its appearance there was connected with the fancy\nball which was now filling London with its fame, and he examined it with\nsome closeness. \"Lady Kitty will make a stir in it--no doubt of that!\"\nhe said to himself, as he turned away. \"She has the keenest _flair_ of\nthem all for what produces an effect. None of the others can touch\nher--Mrs. Alcot--none of them!\"\n\nHe was thinking of the other members of a certain group, at that time\nwell known in London society--a group characterized chiefly by the\nbeauty, extravagance, and audacity of the women belonging to it. It was\nby no means a group of mere fashionables. It contained a large amount of\nability and accomplishment; some men of aristocratic family, who were\nalso men of high character, with great futures before them; some persons\nfrom the literary or artistic world, who possessed, besides their\nliterary or artistic gifts, a certain art of agreeable living, and some\nfew others--especially young girls--admitted generally for some peculiar\nquality of beauty or manner outside the ordinary canons. Money was\nreally presupposed by the group as a group. The life they belonged to\nwas a life of the rich, the houses they met in were rich houses. But\nmoney as such had no power whatever to buy admission to their ranks; and\nthe members of the group were at least as impatient of the claims of\nmere wealth as they were of those of mere virtue.\n\nOn the whole the group was an element of ferment and growth in the\nsociety that had produced it. Its impatience of convention and\nrestraint, the exaltation of intellectual or artistic power which\nprevailed in it, and even the angry opposition excited by its\npretensions and its exclusiveness, were all, perhaps, rather profitable\nthan harmful at that moment of our social history. Old customs were much\nshaken; the new were shaping themselves, and this daring coterie of\nyoung and brilliant people, living in one another's houses, calling one\nanother by their Christian names, setting a number of social rules at\ndefiance, discussing books, making the fame of artists, and, now and\nthen, influencing politics, were certainly helping to bring the new\nworld to birth. Their foes called them \"The Archangels,\" and they\nthemselves had accepted the name with complacency.\n\nKitty, of course, was an Archangel, so was Mrs. Alcot. Cliffe had\nbelonged to them before his travels began. Louis Harman was more or less\nof their tribe, and Lady Tranmore, though not herself an Archangel,\nentertained the set in London and in the country. Like various older\nwomen connected with the group, she was not of them, but she \"harbored\"\nthem.\n\nDarrell was well aware that he did not belong to them, though personally\nhe was acquainted with almost all the members of the group. He was not\ncompletely indifferent to his exclusion; and this fact annoyed him more\nthan the exclusion itself.\n\nHe had scarcely finished his inspection of the print when the door again\nopened and Geoffrey Cliffe entered. Darrell had not yet seen him since\nhis return and since his attack on the government had made him the hero\nof the hour. Of the newspaper success Darrell was no less jealous and\ncontemptuous than Lady Tranmore, though for quite other reasons. But he\nknew better than she the intellectual quality of the man, and his\ndisdain for the journalist was tempered by his considerable though\nreluctant respect for the man of letters.\n\nThey greeted each other coolly, while Cliffe, not seeing his hostess,\nlooked round him with annoyance.\n\n\"Well, we shall probably entertain each other,\" said Darrell, as they\nsat down. \"Lady Kitty often forgets her engagements.\"\n\n\"Does she?\" said Cliffe, coldly, pretending to glance through a book\nbeside him. It touched his vanity that his hostess was not present, and\nstill more that Darrell should suppose him a person to be forgotten.\nDarrell, however, who had no mind for any discomfort that might be\navoided, made a few dexterous advances, Cliffe's brow relaxed, and they\nwere soon in conversation.\n\nThe position of the ministry naturally presented itself as a topic. Two\nor three retirements were impending, the whole position was precarious.\nWould the cabinet be reconstructed without a dissolution, or must there\nbe an appeal to the country?\n\nCliffe was passionately in favor of the latter course. The party\nfortunes could not possibly be retrieved without a general shuffling of\nthe cards, and an opportunity for some wholly fresh combination\ninvolving new blood.\n\n\"In any case,\" said Cliffe, \"I suppose our friend here is sure of one or\nother of the big posts?\"\n\n\"William Ashe? Oh, I suppose so, unless some intrigue gets in the way.\"\nDarrell dropped his voice. \"Parham doesn't, in truth, hit it off with\nhim very well. Ashe is too clever, and Parham doesn't understand his\nparadoxes.\"\n\n\"Also I gather,\" said Cliffe, with a smile, \"that Lady Parham has her\nsay?\"\n\nDarrell shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It sounds incredible that one should still have to reckon with that\nkind of thing at this time of day. But I dare say it's true.\"\n\n\"However, I imagine Lady Kitty--by-the-way, how much longer shall we\ngive her?\"--Cliffe looked at his watch with a frown--\"may be trusted to\ntake care of that.\"\n\nDarrell merely raised his eyebrows, without replying. \"What, not a\nmatch for one Lady Parham?\" said Cliffe, with a laugh. \"I should have\nthought--from my old recollections of her--she would have been a match\nfor twenty?\"\n\n\"Oh, if she cared to try.\"\n\n\"She is not ambitious?\"\n\n\"Certainly; but not always for the same thing.\"\n\n\"She is trying to run too many horses abreast?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not a great friend,\" said Darrell, smiling. \"I should never\ndream of analyzing Lady Kitty. Ah!\"--he turned his head--\"are we not\nforgotten, or just remembered--which?\"\n\nFor a rapid step approached, the door opened, and a lady appeared on the\nthreshold. It was not Kitty, however. The new-comer advanced, putting up\na pair of fashionable eye-glasses, and looking at the two men in a kind\nof languid perplexity, intended, as Darrell immediately said to himself,\nmerely to prolong the moment and the effect of her entry. Mrs. Alcot was\nvery tall, and inordinately thin. Her dark head on its slim throat, the\npoetic lines of the brow, her half-shut eyes, the gleam of her white\nteeth, and all the delicate detail of her dress, and, one might even\nsay, of her manner, gave an impression of beauty, though she was not, in\ntruth, beautiful. But she had grace and she had daring--the two\nessential qualities of an Archangel; she was also a remarkable artist,\nand no small critic.\n\n\"Mr. Cliffe,\" she said, with a start of what was evidently agreeable\nsurprise, \"Kitty never told me. When did you come?\"\n\n\"I arrived a few days ago. Why weren't you at the embassy last night?\"\n\n\"Because I was much better employed. I have given up crushes. But I\nwould have come--to meet you. Ah, Mr. Darrell!\" she added, in another\ntone, holding out an indifferent hand. \"Where is Kitty?\" She looked\nround her.\n\n\"Shall we order lunch?\" said Darrell, who had given her a greeting as\ncareless as her own.\n\n\"Kitty is really too bad; she is never less than an hour late,\" said\nMrs. Alcot, seating herself. \"Last time she dined with us I asked her\nfor seven-thirty. She thought something very special must be happening,\nand arrived--breathless--at half-past eight. Then she was furious with\nme because she was not the last. But one can't do it twice.\nWell\"--addressing herself to Cliffe--\"are you come home to stay?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" said Cliffe, \"on whether England makes itself agreeable\nto me.\"\n\n\"What are your deserts? Why should England be agreeable to you?\" she\nreplied, with a smiling sharpness. \"You do nothing but croak about\nEngland.\"\n\nThus challenged, Cliffe sat down beside her and they fell into a\nbantering conversation. Darrell, though inwardly wounded by the small\ntrouble they took to include him, let nothing appear, put in a word now\nand then, or turned over the pages of the illustrated books.\n\nAfter five minutes a fresh guest arrived. In walked the little Dean, Dr.\nWinston, who had originally made acquaintance with Lady Kitty at\nGrosville Park. He came in overflowing with spirits and enthusiasm. He\nhad been spending the morning in Westminster Abbey with another Dean\nmore famous though not more charming than himself, and with yet another\ncongenial spirit, one of the younger historians, all of them passionate\nlovers of the rich human detail of the past, the actual men and women,\nkings, queens, bishops, executioners, and all the shreds and tatters\nthat remained of them. Together they had opened a royal tomb, and the\nDean's eyes were sparkling as though the ghost of the queen whose ashes\nhe had been handling still walked and talked with him.\n\nHe passed in his light, disinterested way through most sections of\nEnglish society, though the slave of none; and he greeted Darrell and\nMrs. Alcot as acquaintances. Mrs. Alcot introduced Cliffe to him, and\nthe small Dean bowed rather stiffly. He was a supporter of the\ngovernment, and he thought Cliffe's campaign against them vulgar and\nunfair.\n\n\"Is there no hope of Lady Kitty?\" he said to Mrs. Alcot.\n\n\"Not much. Shall we go down to lunch?\"\n\n\"Without our hostess?\" The Dean opened his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, Kitty expects it,\" said Mrs. Alcot, with affected resignation, \"and\nthe servants are quite prepared. Kitty asks everybody to lunch--then\nsomebody asks her--and she forgets. It's quite simple.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Cliffe, buttoning up his coat, \"but I think I shall go to\nthe club.\"\n\nHe was looking for his hat, when again there was a commotion on the\nstairs--a high voice giving orders--and in burst Kitty. She stood still\nas soon as she saw her guests, talking so fast and pouring out such a\nflood of excuses that no one could get in a word. Then she flew to each\nguest in turn, taking them by both hands--Darrell only excepted--and\nshowing herself so penitent, amusing, and charming that everybody was\npropitiated. It was Fanchette, of course--Fanchette the criminal, the\nincomparable. Her dress for the ball. Kitty raised eyes and hands to\nheaven--it would be a marvel, a miracle. Unless, indeed, she were lying\ncold and quiet in her little grave before the time came to wear it. But\nFanchette's tempers--Fanchette's caprices--no! Kitty began to mimic the\ngreat dressmaker torn to pieces by the crowd of fashionable ladies,\nstopping abruptly in the middle to say to Cliffe:\n\n\"You were going away? I saw you take up your hat.\"\n\n\"I despaired of my hostess,\" said Cliffe, with a smile. Then as he\nperceived that Mrs. Alcot had taken up the theme and was holding the\nothers in play, he added in a lower voice, \"and I was in no mood for\nsecond-best.\"\n\nKitty's eyes twinkled a moment as she turned them on Madeleine Alcot.\n\n\"Ah, _I_ remember--at Grosville Park--what a bad temper you had. You\nwould have gone away furious.\"\n\n\"With disappointment--yes,\" said Cliffe, as he looked at her with an\nadmiration he scarcely endeavored to conceal. Kitty was in black, but a\nlarge hat of white tulle, in the most extravagant fashion of the day,\nmade a frame for her hair and eyes, and increased the general lightness\nand fantasy of her appearance. Cliffe tried to recall her as he had\nfirst seen her at Grosville Park, but his recollection of the young girl\ncould not hold its own against the brilliant and emphatic reality before\nhim.\n\nAt luncheon it chafed him that he must divide her with the Dean. Yet she\nwas charming with the old man, who chatted history, art, and Paris to\nher, with a delightful innocence and ignorance of all that made Lady\nKitty Ashe the talk of the town, and an old-fashioned deference besides,\nthat insensibly curbed her manner and her phrases as she answered him.\nYet when the Dean left her free she returned to Cliffe, as though in\nsome sort they two had really been talking all the time, through all the\napparent conversation with other people.\n\n\"I have read all your telegrams,\" she said. \"Why did you attack William\nso fiercely?\"\n\nCliffe was taken by surprise, but he felt no embarrassment--her tone was\nnot that of the wife in arms.\n\n\"I attacked the official--not the man. William knows that.\"\n\n\"He is coming in to-day if possible. He wanted to see you.\"\n\n\"Good news! William knows that he would have hit just as hard in my\nplace.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would,\" said Kitty, calmly. \"He is so generous.\"\n\nThe color rushed to Cliffe's face.\n\n\"Well scored! I wish I had a wife to play these strokes for me. I shall\nargue that a keen politician has no right to be generous. He is at war.\"\n\nKitty took no notice. She leaned her little chin on her hand, and her\neyes perused the face of her companion.\n\n\"Where have you been--all the time--before America?\"\n\n\"In the deserts--fighting devils,\" said Cliffe, after a moment.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" she asked, wondering.\n\n\"Read my new book. That will tell you about the deserts.\"\n\n\"And the devils?\"\n\n\"Ah, I keep them to myself.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" she said, softly. \"I have just read your poems over again.\"\n\nCliffe gave a slight start, then looked indifferent.\n\n\"Have you? But they were written three years ago. Dieu merci, one finds\nnew devils like new acquaintances.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked her, half amused, half arrested.\n\n\"They are always the old,\" she said, in a low voice. Their eyes met. In\nhers was the same veiled, restless melancholy as in his own. Together\nwith the dazzling air of youth that surrounded her, the cherished,\nflattered, luxurious existence that she and her house suggested, they\nmade a strange impression upon him. \"Does she mean me to understand that\nshe is not happy?\" he thought to himself. But the next moment she was\nengaged in a merry chatter with the Dean, and all trace of the mood she\nhad thus momentarily shown him had vanished.\n\nHalf-way through the luncheon, Ashe came in. He appeared, fresh and\nsmiling, irreproachably dressed, and showing no trace whatever of the\nhard morning of official work he had just passed through, nor of the\nmany embarrassments which, as every one knew, were weighing on the\nForeign Office. The Dean, with his keen sense for the dramatic, watched\nthe meeting between him and Cliffe with some closeness, having in mind\nthe almost personal duel between the two men--a duel of letters,\ntelegrams, or speeches, which had been lately carried on in the sight of\nEurope and America. For Ashe now represented the Foreign Office in the\nHouse of Commons, and had been much badgered by the Tory extremists who\nfollowed Cliffe.\n\nNaturally, being Englishmen, they met as though nothing had happened and\nthey had parted the day before in Pall Mall. A \"Hullo, Ashe!\" and\n\"Hullo, Cliffe! glad to see you back again,\" completed the matter. The\nDean enjoyed it as a specimen of English \"phlegm,\" recalling with\namusement his last visit to the Paris of the Second Empire--Paris torn\nbetween government and opposition, the _salons_ of the one divided from\nthe _salons_ of the other by a sulphurous gulf, unless when some Lazarus\nof the moment, some well-known novelist or poet, cradled in the\nAbraham's bosom of Liberalism, passed amid shrieks of triumph or howls\nof treason into the official inferno.\n\nNot that there was any avoiding of topics in this English case. Ashe had\nno sooner slipped into his seat than he began to banter Cliffe upon a\nletter of a supporter which had appeared in that morning's _Times_. It\nwas written by Lord S., who had played the part of public \"fool\" for\nhalf a generation. To be praised by him was disaster, and Cliffe's flush\nshowed at once that the letter had caused him acute annoyance. He and\nAshe fell upon the writer, vying with each other in anecdotes that left\nhim presently close-plucked and bare.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said Kitty, amid the laughter which greeted the\nlast tale, \"but he never told _you_ how he proposed to the second Lady\nS.\"\n\nAnd lifting a red strawberry, which she held poised against her red,\nlaughing lips, she waited a moment--looking round her. \"Go on, Kitty,\"\nsaid Ashe, approvingly; \"go on.\"\n\nThus permitted, Kitty gave one of the little \"scenes,\" arranged from\nsome experience of her own, which were very famous among her intimates.\nAshe called them her \"parlor tricks,\" and was never tired of making her\nexhibit them. And now, just as at Grosville Park, she held her audience.\nShe spoke without a halt, her small features answering perfectly to\nevery impulse of her talent, each touch of character or dialogue as\ntelling as a malicious sense of comedy could make it; arms, hands,\nshoulders all aiding in the final result--a table swept by a very storm\nof laughter, in the midst of which Kitty quietly finished her\nstrawberry.\n\n\"Well done, Kitty!\" Ashe, who sat opposite to her, stretched his hand\nacross, and patted hers.\n\n\"Does she love him?\" Cliffe asked himself, and could not make up his\nmind, closely as he tried to observe their relations. He was more and\nmore conscious of the exciting effect she produced on himself, doubly\nso, indeed, because of that sudden stroke of melancholy wherewith--like\na Rembrandt shadow, she had thrown into relief the gayety and frivolity\nof her ordinary mood.\n\nThe stimulus, whatever it was, played upon his vanity. He, too, sought\nan opening and found it. Soon it was he who was monopolizing the\nconversation with an account of two days spent with Bismarck in a\nPrussian country-house, during the triumphant days of the winter which\nfollowed on Sadowa. The story was brilliantly told, and of some\npolitical importance. But it was disfigured by arrogance and\naffectation, and Ashe's eyes began to dance a little. Cliffe meanwhile\ncould not forget that he was in the presence of a rival and an official,\ncould not refrain after a while from a note of challenge here and there.\nThe conversation diverged from the tale into matters of current foreign\npolitics. Ashe, lounging and smoking, at first knew nothing, had heard\nof nothing, as usual. Then a comment or correction dropped out; Cliffe\nrepeated himself vehemently--only to provoke another. Presently, no one\nknew how, the two men were measured against each other _corps \u00c3\u00a0\ncorps_--the wide knowledge and trained experience of the minister\nagainst the originality, the force, the fantastic imagination of the\nwriter.\n\nThe Dean watched it with delight. He was very fond of Ashe, and liked to\nsee him getting the better of \"the newspaper fellow.\" Kitty's lovely\nbrown eyes travelled from one to the other. Now it seemed to the Dean\nthat she was proud of Ashe, now that she sympathized with Cliffe. Soon,\nhowever, like the god at Philippi, she swept upon the poet and bore him\nfrom the field.\n\n\"Not a word more politics!\" she said, peremptorily, to Ashe, holding up\nher hand. \"_I_ want to talk to Mr. Cliffe about the ball.\"\n\nCliffe was not very ready to obey. He had an angry sense of having been\nsomehow shown to disadvantage, and would like to have challenged his\nhost again. But Kitty poured balm into his wounds. She drew him apart a\nlittle, using the play of her beautiful eyes for him only, and talking\nto him in a new voice of deference.\n\n\"You're going, of course? Lady M. told me the other day she _must_ have\nyou.\"\n\nCliffe, still a little morose, replied that his invitation had been\nwaiting for him at his London rooms. He gave the information carelessly,\nas though it did not matter to him a straw. In reality, as soon as,\nwhile still in America, he had seen the announcement of the ball in one\nof the New York papers, he had written at once to the Marchioness who\nwas to give it--an old acquaintance of his--practically demanding an\ninvitation. It had been sent indeed with alacrity, and without waiting\nfor its arrival Cliffe had ordered his dress in Paris. Kitty inquired\nwhat it was to be.\n\n\"I told my man to copy a portrait of Alva.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's right,\" said Kitty, nodding--\"that's right. Only it would\nhave been better if it had been Torquemada.\"\n\nRather nettled, Cliffe asked what there might be about him that so\nforcibly suggested the Grand Inquisitor. Kitty, cigarette in hand, with\nhalf-shut eyes, did not answer immediately. She seemed to be perusing\nhis face with difficulty.\n\n\"Strength, I suppose,\" she said at last, slowly. Cliffe waited, then\nburst into a laugh.\n\n\"And cruelty?\" She nodded.\n\n\"Who are my victims?\"\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n\"Whose tales have you been listening to, Lady Kitty?\"\n\nShe mentioned the name of a French lady. Cliffe changed countenance.\n\n\"Ah, well, if you have been talking to her,\" he said, haughtily, \"you\nmay well expect to see me appear as Diabolus in person.\"\n\n\"No. But it's since then that I've read the poems again. You see, you\ntell the public so much--\"\n\n\"That you think you have the right to guess the rest?\" He paused, then\nadded, with impatience, \"Don't guess, Lady Kitty. You have everything\nthat life can give you. Let my secrets alone.\"\n\nThere was silence. Kitty looking round her saw that Madeleine Alcot was\nentertaining her other guests, and that she and Cliffe were unobserved.\nSuddenly Cliffe bent towards her, and said, with roughness, his face\nstruggling to conceal the feeling behind it:\n\n\"You heard--and you believed--that I tormented her--that I killed her?\"\n\nThe anguish in his eyes seemed to strike a certain answering fire from\nKitty's.\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"I didn't think it very strange--\"\n\nCliffe watched her closely.\n\n\"--that a man should be--an inhuman beast--if he were jealous--and\ndesperate. You can sympathize with these things?\"\n\nShe drew a long breath, and threw away the cigarette she had been\nholding suspended in her small fingers.\n\n\"I don't know anything about them.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he hesitated, \"your own life has been so happy?\"\n\nShe evaded him. \"Don't you think that jealousy will soon be as dead\nas--saying your prayers and going to church? I never meet anybody that\ncares enough--to be jealous.\"\n\nShe spoke first with passionate force, then with contempt, glancing\nacross the room at Madeleine Alcot. Cliffe saw the look, and remembered\nthat Mrs. Alcot's husband, a distinguished treasury official, had been\nfor years the intimate friend of a very noble and beautiful woman,\nherself unhappily married. There was no scandal in the matter, though\nmuch talk. Mrs. Alcot meanwhile had her own affairs; her husband and she\nwere apparently on friendly terms; only neither ever spoke of the other;\nand their relations remained a mystery.\n\nCliffe bent over to Kitty.\n\n\"And yet you said you could understand?--such things didn't seem strange\nto you.\"\n\nShe gave a little, reckless laugh.\n\n\"Did I? It's like the people who think they could act or sing, if they\nonly had the chance. I choose to think I could feel. And of course I\ncouldn't. We've lost the power. All the old, horrible, splendid things\nare dead and done with.\"\n\n\"The old passions, you mean?\"\n\n\"And the old poems! _You'll_ never write like that again.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said Cliffe, under his breath. Then as Kitty rose he\nfollowed her with his eyes. \"Lady Kitty, you've thrown me a challenge\nthat you hardly understand. Some day I must answer it.\"\n\n\"Don't answer it,\" said Kitty, hastily.\n\n\"Yes, if I can drag the words out,\" he said, sombrely. She met his look\nin a kind of fascination, excited by the memory of the story which had\nbeen told her, by her own audacity in speaking of it, by the presence of\nthe dead passion she divined lying shrouded and ghastly in the mind of\nthe man beside her. Even the ugly things of which he was accused did but\nadd to the interest of his personality for a nature like hers, greedy of\nexperience, and discontented with the real.\n\nWhile he on his side was nattered and astonished by her attitude towards\nhim, as Ashe's wife, she would surely dislike and try to trample on him.\nThat was what he had expected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hear you are an Archangel, Lady Kitty,\" said the Dean, who, having\nobstinately outstayed all the other guests, had now settled his small\nperson and his thin legs into a chair beside his hostess with a view to\nfive agreeable minutes. He was the most harmless of social epicures, was\nthe Dean, and he felt that Lady Kitty had defrauded him at lunch in\nfavor of that great, ruffling, Byronic fellow Cliffe, who ought to have\nbetter taste than to come lunching with the Ashes.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Kitty, who had thrown herself into the corner of a sofa,\nand sat curled up there in an attitude which the Dean thought charming,\nthough it would not, he was aware, \"have become Mrs. Winston.\n\n\"Well, you know best,\" said the Dean. \"But, at any rate, be good and\nexplain to me what is an Archangel.\"\n\n\"Somebody whom most men and all women dislike,\" said Kitty, promptly.\n\n\"Yet they seem to be numerous,\" remarked the Dean.\n\n\"Not at all!\" cried Kitty, with an air of offence; \"not at all! If they\nwere numerous they would, of course, be popular.\"\n\n\"And in fact they are rare--and detested? What other characteristics\nhave they?\"\n\n\"Courage,\" said Kitty, looking up.\n\n\"Courage to break rules? I hear they all call one another by their\nChristian names, and live in one another's rooms, and borrow one\nanother's money, and despise conventionalities. I am sorry you are an\nArchangel, Lady Kitty.\"\n\n\"I didn't admit that I was,\" said Kitty, \"but if I am, why are you\nsorry?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the Dean, smiling, \"I thought you were too clever to\ndespise conventionalities.\"\n\nKitty sat up with revived energy, and joined battle. She flew into a\ntirade as to the dulness and routine of English life, the stupidity of\ngood people, and the tyranny of English hypocrisy. The Dean listened\nwith amusement, then with a shade of something else. At last he got up\nto go.\n\n\"Well, you know, we have heard all that before. My point of view is so\nmuch more interesting--subtle--romantic! Anybody can attack Mrs. Grundy,\nbut only a person of originality can adore her. Try it, Lady Kitty. It\nwould be really worth your while.\"\n\nKitty mocked and exclaimed.\n\n\"Do you know what that phrase--that name of abomination--always recalls\nto me?\" pursued the old man.\n\n\"It bores me, even to guess,\" was Kitty's petulant reply.\n\n\"Does it? I think of some of the noblest people I have ever known--brave\nmen--beautiful women--who fought Mrs. Grundy, and perished.\"\n\nThe Dean stood looking down upon her, with an eager, sensitive\nexpression. Tales that he had heeded very little when he had first\nheard them ran through his mind; he had thought Lady Kitty's intimate\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with her husband's assailant in the press disagreeable and\nunseemly; and as for Mrs. Alcot, he had disliked her particularly.\n\nKitty looked up unquelled.\n\n     \"''Tis better to have fought and lost\n     Than never to have fought at all--'\"\n\nshe quoted, with one of her most radiant and provoking smiles.\n\n\"Incorrigible!\" cried the Dean, catching up his hat. \"I see! Once an\nArchangel--always an Archangel.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Kitty. \"There may be 'war in heaven.'\"\n\n\"Well, don't take Mrs. Alcot for a leader, that's all,\" said the Dean,\nas he held out a hand of farewell.\n\n\"And now I understand!\" cried Kitty, triumphantly. \"You detest my best\nfriend.\"\n\nThe Dean laughed, protested, and went. Ashe, who had been writing\nletters while Kitty and the Dean were talking, escorted the old man to\nthe door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he returned he found Kitty sitting with her hands in her lap, lost\napparently in thought.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said, looking at his watch, \"I must be off directly, but I\nshould like to see the boy.\"\n\nKitty started. She rang, and the child was brought down. He sat on\nKitty's knee, and Ashe coming to the sofa, threw an arm round them both.\n\n\"You are not a bad-looking pair,\" he said, kissing first Kitty and then\nthe baby. \"But he's rather pale, Kitty. I think he wants the country.\"\n\nKitty said nothing, but she lifted the little white embroidered frock\nand looked at the twisted foot. Then Ashe felt her shudder.\n\n\"Dear, don't be morbid!\" he cried, resentfully. \"He will have so much\nbrains that nobody will remember that. Think of Byron.\"\n\nKitty did not seem to have heard.\n\n\"I remember so well when I first saw his foot--after your mother told\nme--and they brought him to me,\" she said, slowly. \"It seemed to me it\nwas the end--\"\n\n\"The end of what?\"\n\n\"Of my dream.\"\n\n\"What _do_ you mean, Kitty!\"\n\n\"Do you remember the mask in the 'Tempest'? First Iris, with saffron\nwings, and rich Ceres, and great Juno--\"\n\nShe half closed her eyes.\n\n\"Then the nymphs and the reapers--dancing together on 'the short-grassed\ngreen,' the sweetest, gayest show--\"\n\nShe breathed the words out softly. \"Then, suddenly--\"\n\nShe sat up stiffly and struck her small hands together:\n\n\"Prospero starts and speaks. And in a moment--without warning--with 'a\nstrange, hollow, and confused noise'\"--she dragged the words\ndrearily--\"_they heavily vanish_. That\"--she pointed, shuddering, to the\nchild's foot--\"was for me the sign of Prospero.\"\n\nAshe looked at her with anxiety, finding it indeed impossible to laugh\nat her.\n\nShe was very pale, her breath came with difficulty, and she trembled\nfrom head to foot. He tried to draw her into his arms, but she held him\naway.\n\n\"That first year I had been so happy,\" she continued, in the same voice.\n\"Everything was so perfect, so glorious. Life was like a great pageant,\nin a palace. All the old terrors went. I often had fears as a\nchild--fears I couldn't put into words, but that overshadowed me. Then\nwhen I saw Alice--the shadow came nearer. But that was all gone. I\nthought God was reconciled to me, and would always be kind to me now.\nAnd then I saw that foot, and I knew that He hated me still. He had\nburned His mark into my baby's flesh. And I was never to be quite happy\nagain, but always in fear, fear of pain--and death--and grief--\"\n\nShe paused. Her large eyes gazed into vacancy, and her whole slight\nframe showed the working of some mysterious and pitiful distress.\n\nA wave of poignant alarm swept through Ashe's mind, coupled also with a\ncurious sense of something foreseen. He had never witnessed precisely\nthis mood in her before; but now that it was thus revealed, he was\nsuddenly aware \"that something like it had been for long moving\nobscurely below the surface of her life. He took the child and laid him\non the floor, where he rolled at ease, cooing to himself. Then he came\nback to Kitty, and soothed her with extraordinary tenderness and skill.\nPresently she looked at him, as though some obscure trouble of which she\nhad been the victim had released her, and she were herself again.\n\n\"Don't go away just yet,\" she said, in a voice which was still low and\nshaken. He came close to her, again put his arms round her, and held her\non his breast in silence.\n\n\"That is heavenly!\" he heard her say to herself after a while, in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Kitty!\" His eyes grew dim and he stooped to kiss her.\n\n\"Heavenly--\" she went on, still as though following out her own thought\nrather than speaking to him, \"because one _yields_--_yields_! Life is\nsuch tension--always.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes quickly, and he watched the beautiful lashes lying\nstill upon her cheek. With an emotion he could not explain--for it was\nnot an emotion of the senses, just as her yielding had not been a\nyielding of the senses but a yielding of the soul--he continued to hold\nher in his arms, her life, her will given to him wholly, sighed out upon\nhis heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen gradually she recovered her balance; the normal Kitty came back.\nShe put out her hand and touched his face.\n\n\"You must go back to the House, William.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you are all right.\"\n\nShe sat up, and began to rearrange some of her hair that had slipped\ndown.\n\n\"You have carried us both into such heights and depths, darling!\" said\nAshe, after he had watched her a little in silence, \"that I have\nforgotten to tell you the gossip I brought back from mother this\nmorning.\"\n\nKitty paused, interrogatively. She was still pale.\n\n\"Do you know that mother is convinced Mary Lyster has made up her mind\nto marry Cliffe?\"\n\nThere was a pause, then Kitty said, with incredulous contempt: \"He would\nnever _dream_ of marrying her!\"\n\n\"Not so sure! She has a great deal of money, and Cliffe wants money\nbadly.\"\n\nAshe began to put his papers together. Kitty questioned him a little\nmore, intermittently, as to what his mother had said. When he had left\nher, she sat for long on the sofa, playing with some flowers she had\ntaken from her dress, or sombrely watching the child, as it lay on the\nfloor beside her.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\"My lady! It's come!\"\n\nThe maid put her head in just to convey the good news. Kitty was in her\nbedroom walking up and down in a fury which was now almost speechless.\n\nThe housemaid was waiting on the stairs. The butler was waiting in the\nhall. Till that hurried knock was heard at the front door, and the\nmuch-tried Wilson had rushed to open it, the house had been wrapped in a\nsort of storm silence. It was ten o'clock on the night of the ball. Half\nKitty's costume lay spread out upon her bed. The other half--although\nsince seven o'clock all Kitty's servants had been employed in rushing to\nFanchette's establishment in New Bond Street, at half-hour intervals, in\nthe fastest hansoms to be found--had not yet appeared.\n\nHowever, here at last was the end of despair. A panting boy dragged the\nbox into the hall, the butler and footman carried it up-stairs and into\ntheir mistress's room, where Kitty in a white peignoir stood waiting,\nwith the brow of Medea.\n\n\"The boy that brought it looked just fit to drop, my lady!\" said the\nmaid, as she undid the box. She was a zealous servant, but she was glad\nsometimes to chasten these great ones of the land by insisting on the\nseamy side of their pleasures.\n\nKitty paused in the eager task of superintendence, and turned to the\nunder-housemaid, who stood by, gazing open-mouthed at the splendors\nemerging from the box.\n\n\"Run down and tell Wilson to give him some wine and cake!\" she said,\nperemptorily. \"It's all Fanchette's fault--odious creature!--running it\nto the last like this--after all her promises!\"\n\nThe housemaid went, and soon sped back. For no boy on earth would she\nhave been long defrauded of the sight of her ladyship's completed gown.\n\n\"Did Wilson feed him?\" Kitty flung her the question as she bent,\nalternately frowning and jubilant, over the creation before her.\n\n\"Yes, my lady. It was quite a little fellow. He said his legs were just\nrun off his feet,\" said the girl, growing confused as the moon-robe\nunfolded.\n\n\"Poor wretch!\" said Kitty, carelessly. \"I'm glad I'm not an\nerrand--Blanche! you know Fanchette may be an old demon, but she _has_\ngot taste! Just look at these folds, and the way she's put on the\npearls! Now then--make haste!\"\n\nOff flew the peignoir, and, with the help of the excited maids, Kitty\nslipped into her dress. Ten times, over did she declare that it was\nhopeless, that it didn't fit in the least, that it wasn't one bit what\nshe had ordered, that she couldn't and wouldn't go out in it, that it\nwas simply scandalous, and Fanchette should never be paid a penny. Her\nmaids understood her, and simply went on pulling, patting, fastening, as\nquickly as their skilled fingers could work, till the last fold fell\ninto its place, and the under-housemaid stepped back with clasped hands\nand an \"Oh, my lady!\" couched in a note of irrepressible ecstasy.\n\n\"Well?\" said Kitty, still frowning--\"eh, Blanche?\"\n\nThe maid proper would have scorned to show emotion; but she nodded\napproval. \"If you ask me, my lady, I think you have never looked so well\nin anything.\"\n\nKitty's brow relaxed at last, as she stood gazing at the reflection in\nthe large glass before her. She saw herself as Artemis--\u00c3\u00a1 la Madame de\nLongueville--in a hunting-dress of white silk, descending to the ankles,\nembroidered from top to toe in crescents of seed pearls and silver, and\nheld at the waist by a silver girdle. Her throat was covered with\nmagnificent pearls, a Tranmore family possession, lent by Lady Tranmore\nfor the occasion. The slim ankles and feet were cased in white silk,\ncross-gartered with silver and shod with silver sandals. Her belt held\nher quiver of white-winged arrows; her bow of ivory inlaid with silver\nwas slung at her shoulder, while across her breast, the only note of\ncolor in the general harmony of white, fell a scarf of apple-green\nholding the horn, also of ivory and silver, which, like the belt and\nbow, had been designed for her in Madame de Longueville's Paris.\n\nBut neither she nor her model would have been finally content with an\nadornment so delicately fanciful and minute. Both Kitty and the goddess\nof the Fronde knew that they must hold their own in a crowd. For this\nthere must be diamonds. The sleeves, therefore, on the white arms fell\nback from diamond clasps; the ivory spear in her right hand was topped\nby a small genius with glittering wings; and in the masses of her fair\nhair, bound with pearl fillets, shone the large diamond crescent that\nLady Tranmore had foreseen, with one small attendant star at either\nside.\n\n[Illustration: THE FINISHING TOUCHES]\n\n\"Well, upon my word, Kitty!\" said a voice from her husband's\ndressing-room.\n\nKitty turned impetuously.\n\n\"Do you like it?\" she cried. Ashe approached. She lifted her horn to her\nmouth and stood tiptoe. The movement was enchanting; it had in it the\nyouth and freshness of spring woods; it suggested mountain distances and\nthe solitudes of high valleys. Intoxication spoke in Ashe's pulses; he\nwished the maids had been far away that he might have taken the goddess\nin his very human arms. Instead of which he stood lazily smiling.\n\n\"What Endymion are you calling?\" he asked her. \"Kitty, you are a dream!\"\n\nKitty pirouetted, then suddenly stopped short and held out a foot.\n\n\"Look at those silk things, sir. Nobody but Fanchette could have made\nthem look anything but a botch. But they spoil the dress. And all to\nplease mother and Mrs. Grundy!\"\n\n\"I like them. I suppose--the nearest you could get to buskins? You would\nhave preferred ankles _au naturel_? I don't think you'd have been\nadmitted, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't I? And so few people have feet they can show!\" sighed Kitty,\nregretfully.\n\nAshe's eyes met those of the maid, who was trying to hide her smiles,\nand he and she both laughed.\n\n\"What do you think about it, eh, Blanche?\"\n\n\"I think her ladyship is much better as she is,\" said the maid,\ndecidedly. \"She'd have felt very strange when she got there.\"\n\nKitty turned upon her like a whirlwind. \"Go to bed!\" she said, putting\nboth hands on the shoulders of the maid. \"Go to bed at once! Esther can\ngive me my cloak. Do you know, William, she was awake all last night\nthinking of her brother?\"\n\n\"The brother who has had an operation? But I thought there was good\nnews?\" said Ashe, kindly.\n\n\"He's much better,\" put in Kitty. \"She heard this afternoon. She won't\nbe such a goose as to lie awake, I Should hope, to-night. Don't let me\ncatch you here when I get back!\" she said, releasing the girl, whose\neyes had filled with tears. \"Mr. Ashe will help me, and if he pulls the\nstrings into knots, I shall just cut them--so there! Go away, get your\nsupper, and go to bed. Such a life as I've led them all to-day!\" She\nthrew up her hands in a perfunctory penitence.\n\nThe maid was forced to go, and the housemaid also returned to the hall\nwith Kitty's Opera-cloak and fan, till it should please her mistress to\ndescend. Both of them were dead tired, but they took a genuine\ndisinterested pleasure in Kitty's beauty and her fine frocks. She was\nnot by any means always considerate of them; but still, with that\nwonderful generosity that the poor show every day to the rich, they\nliked her; and to Ashe every servant in the house was devoted.\n\nKitty meanwhile had driven Ashe to his own toilette, and was walking\nabout the room, now studying herself in the glass, and now chattering to\nhim through the open door.\n\n\"Have you heard anything more about Tuesday?\" she asked him, presently.\n\n\"Oh yes!--compliments by the dozen. Old Parham overtook me as I was\nwalking away from the House, and said all manner of civil things.\"\n\n\"And I met Lady Parham in Marshall's,\" said Kitty. \"She does thank so\nbadly! I should like to show her how to do it. Dear me!\" Kitty sighed.\n\"Am I henceforth to live and die on Lady Parham's ample breast?\"\n\nShe sat with one foot beating the floor, deep in meditation.\n\n\"And shall I tell you what mother said?\" shouted Ashe through the door.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe repeated--so far as dressing would let him a number of the charming\nand considered phrases in which Lady Tranmore, full of relief, pleasure,\nand a secret self-reproach, had expressed to him the effect produced\nupon herself and a select public by Kitty's performance at the Parhams'.\nKitty had indeed behaved like an angel--an angel _en toilette de bal_,\nreciting a scene from Alfred de Musset. Such politeness to Lady Parham,\nsuch smiles, sometimes a shade malicious, for the Prime Minister, who on\nhis side did his best to efface all memory of his speech of the week\nbefore from the mind of his fascinating guest; smiles from the Princess,\napplause from the audience; an evening, in fact, all froth and\nsweetstuff, from which Lady Parham emerged grimly content, conscious at\nthe same time that she was henceforward very decidedly, and rather\ndisagreeably, in the Ashes' debt; while Elizabeth Tranmore went home in\na tremor of delight, happily persuaded that Ashe's path was now clear.\n\nKitty listened, sometimes pleased, sometimes inclined to be critical or\nscornful of her mother-in-law's praise. But she did love Lady Tranmore,\nand on the whole she smiled. Smiles, indeed, had been Kitty's portion\nsince that evening of strange emotion, when she had found herself\nsobbing in William's arms for reasons quite beyond her own defining. It\nwas as if, like the prince in the fairy tale, some iron band round her\nheart had given way. She seemed to dance through the house; she devoured\nher child with kisses; and she was even willing sometimes to let William\ntell her what his mother suspected of the progress of Mary's affair with\nGeoffrey Cliffe, though she carefully avoided speaking directly to Lady\nTranmore about it. As to Cliffe himself, she seemed to have dropped him\nout of her thoughts. She never mentioned him, and Ashe could only\nsuppose she had found him disenchanting.\n\n\"Well, darling! I hope I have made a sufficient fool of myself to please\nyou!\"\n\nAshe had thrown the door wide, and stood on the threshold, arrayed in\nthe brocade and fur of a Venetian noble. He was a somewhat magnificent\napparition, and Kitty, who had coaxed or driven him into the dress, gave\na scream of delight. She saw him before her own glass, and the crimson\nsenator made eyes at the white goddess as they posed triumphantly\ntogether.\n\n\"You're a very rococo sort of goddess, you know, Kitty!\" said Ashe. \"Not\nmuch Greek about you!\"\n\n\"Quite as much as I want, thank you,\" said Kitty, courtesying to her own\nreflection in the glass. \"Fanchette could have taught them a thing or\ntwo! Now come along! Ah! Wait!\"\n\nAnd, gathering up her possessions, she left the room. Ashe, following\nher, saw that she was going to the nursery, a large room on the back\nstaircase. At the threshold she turned back and put her finger to her\nlip. Then she slipped in, reappearing a moment afterwards to say, in a\nwhisper, \"Nurse is not in bed. You may come in.\" Nurse, indeed, knew\nmuch better than to be in bed. She had been sitting up to see her\nladyship's splendors, and she rose smiling as Ashe entered the room.\n\n\"A parcel of idiots, nurse, aren't we?\" he said, as he, too, displayed\nhimself, and then he followed Kitty to the child's bedside. She bent\nover the baby, removed a corner of the cot-blanket that might tease his\ncheek, touched the mottled hand softly, removed a light that seemed to\nher too near--and still stood looking.\n\n\"We must go, Kitty.\"\n\n\"I wish he were a little older,\" she said, discontentedly, under her\nbreath, \"that he might wake up and see us both! I should like him to\nremember me like this.\"\n\n\"Queen and huntress, come away!\" said Ashe, drawing her by the hand.\n\nOutside the landing was dimly lighted. The servants were all waiting in\nthe hall below.\n\n\"Kitty,\" said Ashe, passionately, \"give me one kiss. You're so sweet\nto-night--so sweet!\"\n\nShe turned.\n\n\"Take care of my dress!\" she smiled, and then she held out her face\nunder its sparkling crescent, held it with a dainty deliberation, and\nlet her lips cling to his.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAshe and Kitty were soon wedged into one of the interminable lines of\ncarriages that blocked all the approaches to St. James's Square. The\nball had been long expected, and there was a crowd in the streets, kept\nback by the police. The brougham went at a foot's pace, and there was\nample time either for reverie or conversation. Kitty looked out\nincessantly, exclaiming when she caught sight of a costume or an\nacquaintance. Ashe had time to think over the latest phase of the\nnegotiations with America, and to go over in his mind the sentences of a\nletter he had addressed to the _Times_ in answer to one of great\nviolence from Geoffrey Cliffe. His own letter had appeared that morning.\nAshe was proud of it. He made bold to think that it exposed Cliffe's\nexaggerations and insincerities neatly, and perhaps decisively. At any\nrate, he hummed a cheerful tune as he thought of it.\n\nThen suddenly and incongruously a recollection occurred to him.\n\n\"Kitty, do you know that I had a letter from your mother, this morning?\"\n\n\"Had you?\" said Kitty, turning to him with reluctance. \"I suppose she\nwanted some money.\"\n\n\"She did. She says she is very hard up. If I cared to use it, I have an\neasy reply.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I might say,' D---n it, we are, too!'\"\n\nKitty laughed uneasily.\n\n\"Don't begin to talk money matters now, William, _please_.\"\n\n\"No, dear, I won't. But we shall really have to draw in.\"\n\n\"You _will_ pay so many debts!\" said Kitty, frowning.\n\nAshe went into a fit of laughter.\n\n\"That's my extravagance, isn't it? I assure you I go on the most\napproved principles. I divide our available money among the greatest\nnumber of hungry claimants it will stretch to. But, after all, it goes a\nbeggarly short way.\"\n\n\"I know mother will think my diamond crescent a horrible extravagance,\"\nsaid Kitty, pouting. \"But you are the only son, William, and we must\nbehave like other people.\"\n\n\"Dear, don't trouble your little head,\" he said; \"I'll manage it,\nsomehow.\"\n\nIndeed, he knew very well that he could never bring his own indolent and\neasy-going temper in such matters to face any real struggle with Kitty\nover money. He must go to his mother, who now--his father being a\nhopeless invalid--managed the estates with his own and the agent's help.\nIt was, of course, right that she should preach to Kitty a little; but\nshe would be sensible and help them out. After all, there was plenty of\nmoney. Why shouldn't Kitty spend it?\n\nAny one who knew him well might have observed a curious contrast between\nhis private laxity in these matters and the strictness of his public\npractice. He was scruple and delicacy itself in all financial matters\nthat touched his public life--directorships, investments, and the like,\nno less than in all that concerned interest and patronage. He would have\nbeen a bold man who had dared to propose to William Ashe any expedient\nwhatever by which his public place might serve his private gain. His\nproud and fastidious integrity, indeed, was one of the sources of his\ngrowing power. But as to private debts--and the tradesmen to whom they\nwere owed--his standards were still essentially those of the Whigs from\nwhom he descended, of Fox, the all-indebted, or of Melbourne, who has\nleft an amusing disquisition on the art of dividing a few loaves and\nfishes in the shape of bank-notes among a multitude of creditors.\n\nNot that affairs were as yet very bad. Far from it. But there was little\nto spare for Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, who ought, indeed, to want nothing; and\nAshe was vaguely meditating his reply to that lady when a face in a\ncarriage near them, which was trying to enter the line, caught his\nattention.\n\n\"Mary!\" he said, \"\u00c3\u00a0 la Sir Joshua--and mother. They don't see us. Query,\nwill Cliffe take the leap to-night? Mother reports a decided increase of\nardor on his part. Sorry you don't approve of it, darling!\"\n\n\"It's just like lighting a lamp to put it out--that's all!\" said Kitty,\nwith vivacity. \"The man who marries Mary is done for.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Mary's money will give him the pedestal he wants, and trust\nCliffe to take care of his own individuality afterwards! Now, if you'll\ntransfer your alarms to _Mary_, I'm with you!\"\n\n\"Oh! of _course_ he'll be unkind to her. She may lay her account for\nthat. But it's the _marrying_ her!\" And Kitty's upper-lip curled under a\nslow disdain.\n\nWilliam laughed out.\n\n\"Kitty, really!--you remind me, please, of Miss Jane Taylor:\n\n     \"'I did not think there could be found--a little heart so hard!'\n\nMary is thirty; she would like to be married. And why not? She'll give\nquite as good as she gets.\"\n\n\"Well, she won't get--anything. Geoffrey Cliffe thinks of no one but\nhimself.\"\n\nAshe's eyebrows went up.\n\n\"Oh, well, all men are selfish--and the women don't mind.\"\n\n\"It depends on how it's done,\" said Kitty.\n\nAshe declared that Cliffe was just an ordinary person, \"l'homme sensuel\nmoyen\"--with a touch of genius. Except for that, no better and no worse\nthan other people. What then?--the world was not made up of persons of\nenormous virtue like Lord Althorp and Mr. Gladstone. If Mary wanted him\nfor a husband, and could capture him, both, in his opinion, would have\npretty nearly got their deserts.\n\nKitty, however, fell into a reverie, after which she let him see a face\nof the same startling sweetness as she had several times shown him of\nlate.\n\n\"Do you want me to be nice to her?\" She nestled up to him.\n\n\"Bind her to your chariot wheels, madam! You can!\" said Ashe, slipping a\nhand round hers.\n\nKitty pondered.\n\n\"Well, then, I won't tell her that I _know_ he's still in love with the\nFrenchwoman. But it's on the tip of my tongue.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" cried Ashe. \"The Vicomtesse D---, the lady of the poems? But\nshe's dead! I thought that was over long ago.\"\n\nKitty was silent for a moment, then said, with low-voiced emphasis:\n\n\"That any one could write those poems, and then _think_ of Mary!\"\n\n\"Yes, the poems were fine,\" said Ashe, \"but make-believe!\"\n\nKitty protested indignantly. Ashe bantered her a little on being one of\nthe women who were the making of Cliffe.\n\n\"Say what you like!\" she said, drawing a quick breath. \"But, often and\noften, he says divine things--divinely! I feel them there!\" And she\nlifted both hands to her breast with an impulsive gesture.\n\n\"Goddess!\" said Ashe, kissing her hand because enthusiasm became her so\nwell. \"And to think that I should have dared to roast the divine one in\na _Times_ letter this morning!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hall and staircase of Yorkshire House were already filled with a\nmotley and magnificent crowd when Ashe and Kitty arrived. Kitty, still\nshrouded in her cloak, pushed her way through, exchanging greetings with\nfriends, shrieking a little now and then for the safety of her bow and\nquiver, her face flushed with pleasure and excitement. Then she\ndisappeared into the cloak-room, and Ashe was left to wonder how he was\ngoing to endure his robes through the heat of the evening, and to\nexchange a laughing remark or two with the Parliamentary Secretary to\nthe Admiralty, into whose company he had fallen.\n\n\"What are we doing it for?\" he asked the young man, whose thin person\nwas well set off by a Tudor dress.\n\n\"Oh, don't be superior!\" said the other. \"I'm going to enjoy myself like\na school-boy!\"\n\nAnd that, indeed, seemed to be the attitude of most of the people\npresent. And not only of the younger members of the dazzling company.\nWhat struck Ashe particularly, as he mingled with the crowd, was the\nalacrity of the elder men. Here was a famous lawyer already nearing the\nseventies, in the Lord Chancellor's garb of a great ancestor; here an\nex-Viceroy of Ireland with a son in the government, magnificent in an\nElizabethan dress, his fair bushy hair and reddish beard shining above a\ndoublet on which glittered a jewel given to the founder of his house by\nElizabeth's own hand; next to him, a white-haired judge in the robes of\nJudge Gascoyne; a peer, no younger, at his side, in the red and blue of\nMazarin: and showing each and all in their gay complacent looks a clear\nrevival of that former masculine delight in splendid clothes which came\nso strangely to an end with that older world on the ruins of which\nNapoleon rose. So with the elder women. For this night they were young\nagain. They had been free to choose from all the ages a dress that\nsuited them; and the result of this renewal of a long-relinquished\neagerness had been in many cases to call back a bygone self, and the\ntones and gestures of those years when beauty is its own chief care.\n\nAs for the young men, the young women, and the girls, the zest and\npleasure of the show shone in their eyes and movements, and spread\nthrough the hall and up the crowded staircase, like a warm, contagious\natmosphere. At all times, indeed, and in all countries, an aristocracy\nhas been capable of this sheer delight in its own splendor, wealth, good\nlooks, and accumulated treasure; whether in the Venice that Petrarch\nvisited; or in the Rome of the Renaissance popes; in the Versailles of\nthe Grand Monarque; or in the Florence of to-day, which still at moments\nof _festa_ reproduces in its midst all the costumes of the Cinque-cento.\n\nIn this English case there was less dignity than there would have been\nin a Latin country, and more personal beauty; less grace, perhaps, and\nyet a something richer and more romantic.\n\nAt the top of the stairs stood a marquis in a dress of the Italian\nRenaissance, a Gonzaga who had sat for Titian; beside him a fair-haired\nwife in the white satin and pearls of Henrietta Maria; while up the\nmarble stairs, watched by a laughing multitude above, streamed\nGainsborough girls and Reynolds women, women from the courts of\nElizabeth, or Henri Quatre, of Maria Theresa, or Marie Antoinette, the\nfigures of Holbein and Vandyck, Florentines of the Renaissance, the\nyouths of Carpaccio, the beauties of Titian and Veronese.\n\n\"Kitty, make haste!\" cried a voice in front, as Kitty began to mount the\nstairs. \"Your quadrille is just called.\"\n\nKitty smiled and nodded, but did not hurry her pace by a second. The\nstaircase was not so full as it had been, and she knew well as she\nmounted it, her slender figure drawn to its full height, her eyes\nflashing greeting and challenge to those in the gallery, the diamond\ngenius on her spear glittering above her, that she held the stage, and\nthat the play would not begin without her.\n\nAnd indeed her dress, her brilliance, and her beauty let loose a hum of\nconversation--not always friendly.\n\n\"What is she?\" \"Oh, something mythological! She's in the next\nquadrille.\" \"My dear, she's Diana! Look at her bow and quiver, and the\nmoon in her hair.\" \"Very incorrect!--she ought to have the towered\ncrown!\" \"Absurd, such a little thing to attempt Diana! I'd back Act\u00c3\u00a6on!\"\n\nThe latter remark was spoken in the ear of Louis Harman, who stood in\nthe gallery looking down. But Harman shook his head.\n\n\"You don't understand. She's not Greek, of course; but she's fairyland.\nA child of the Renaissance, dreaming in a wood, would have seen Artemis\nso--dressed up and glittering, and fantastic--as the Florentines saw\nVenus. Small, too, like the fairies!--slipping through the leaves; small\nhounds, with jewelled collars, following her!\"\n\nHe smiled at his own fancy, still watching Kitty with his painter's\neyes.\n\n\"She has seen a French print somewhere,\" said Cliffe, who stood close\nby. \"More Versailles in it than fairyland, I think!\"\n\n\"It is _she_ that is fairyland,\" said Harman, still fascinated.\n\nCliffe's expression showed the sarcasm of his thought. Fairy,\nperhaps!--with the touch of malice and inhuman mischief that all\ntradition attributes to the little people. Why, after that first\nmeeting, when the conversation of a few minutes had almost swept them\ninto the deepest waters of intimacy, had she slighted him so, in other\ndrawing-rooms and on other occasions? She had actually neglected and\navoided him--after having dared to speak to him of his secret! And now\nAshe's letter of the morning had kindled afresh his sense of rancor\nagainst a pair of people, too prosperous and too arrogant. The stroke\nin the _Times_ had, he knew, gone home; his vanity writhed under it, and\nthe wish to strike back tormented him, as he watched Ashe mounting\nbehind his wife, so handsome, careless, and urbane, his jewelled cap\ndangling in his hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe quadrille of gods and goddesses was over. Kitty had been dancing\nwith a fine clumsy Mars, in ordinary life an honest soldier and\ndeer-stalker, the heir to a Scotch dukedom; having as her _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_\nMadeleine Alcot--as the Flora of Botticelli's \"Spring\"--and slim as\nMercury in fantastic Renaissance armor. All the divinities of the\nPantheon, indeed, were there, but in Gallicized or Italianate form;\nscarcely a touch of the true antique, save in the case of one beautiful\ngirl who wore a Juno dress of white whereof the clinging folds had been\narranged for her by a young Netherlands painter, Mr. Alma Tadema, then\nnewly settled in this country. Kitty at first envied her; then decided\nthat she herself could have made no effect in such a gown, and threw her\nthe praises of indifference.\n\nWhen, to Kitty's sharp regret, the music stopped and the glittering crew\nof immortals melted into the crowd, she found behind her a row of\ndancers waiting for the quadrille which was to follow. This was to\nconsist entirely of English pictures revived--Reynolds, Gainsborough,\nand Romney--and to be danced by those for whose families they had been\noriginally painted. As she drew back, looking eagerly to right and left,\nshe came across Mary Lyster. Mary wore her hair high and powdered--a\nblack silk scarf over white satin, and a blue sash.\n\n\"Awfully becoming!\" said Kitty, nodding to her. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My great-great aunt!\" said Mary, courtesying. \"You, I see, go even\nfarther back.\"\n\n\"Isn't it fun?\" said Kitty, pausing beside her. \"Have you seen William?\nPoor dear! he's so hot. How do you do?\" This last careless greeting was\naddressed to Cliffe, whom she now perceived standing behind Mary.\n\nCliffe bowed stiffly.\n\n\"Excuse me. I did not see you. I was absorbed in your dress. You are\nArtemis, I see--with additions.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am an 'article de Paris,'\" said Kitty. \"But it seems odd that\nsome people should take me for Joan of Arc.\" Then she turned to Mary. \"I\nthink your dress is quite lovely!\" she said, in that warm, shy voice she\nrarely used except for a few intimates, and had never yet been known to\nwaste on Mary. \"Don't you admire it enormously, Mr. Cliffe?\"\n\n\"Enormously,\" said Cliffe, pulling at his mustache. \"But by now my\ncompliments are stale.\"\n\n\"Is he cross about William's letter?\" thought Kitty. \"Well, let's leave\nthem to themselves.\"\n\nThen, as she passed him, something in the silent personality of the man\narrested her. She could not forbear a look at him over her shoulder.\n\"Are you--Oh! of course, I remember--\" for she had recognized the dress\nand cap of the Spanish grandee.\n\nCliffe did not reply for a moment, but the harsh significance of his\nface revived in her the excitable interest she had felt in him on the\nday of his luncheon in Hill Street; an interest since effaced and\ndispersed, under the influence of that serenity and home peace which\nhad shone upon her since that very day.\n\n\"I should apologize, no doubt, for not taking your advice,\" he said,\nlooking her in the eyes. Their expression, half bitter, half insolent,\nreminded her.\n\n\"Did I give you any advice?\" Kitty wrinkled up her white brows. \"I don't\nrecollect.\"\n\nMary looked at her sharply, suspiciously. Kitty, quite conscious of the\nlook, was straightway pricked by an elfish curiosity. Could she carry\nhim off--trouble Mary's possession there and then? She believed she\ncould. She was well aware of a certain relation between herself and\nCliffe, if, at least, she chose to develop it. Should she? Her vanity\ninsisted that Mary could not prevent it.\n\nHowever, she restrained herself and moved on. Presently looking back,\nshe saw them still together, Cliffe leaning against the pedestal of a\nbust, Mary beside him. There was an animation in her eyes, a rose of\npleasure on her cheek which stirred in Kitty a queer, sudden sympathy.\n\"I _am_ a little beast!\" she said to herself. \"Why shouldn't she be\nhappy?\"\n\nThen, perceiving Lady Tranmore at the end of the ballroom, she made her\nway thither surrounded by a motley crowd of friends. She walked as\nthough on air, \"raining influence.\" And as Lady Tranmore caught the\nglitter of the diamond crescent, and beheld the small divinity beneath\nit, she, too, smiled with pleasure, like the other spectators on Kitty's\nmarch. The dress was monstrously costly. She knew that. But she forgot\nthe inroad on William's pocket, and remembered only to be proud of\nWilliam's wife. Since the Parhams' party, indeed, the unlooked-for\nsubmission of Kitty, and the clearing of William's prospects, Lady\nTranmore had been sweetness itself to her daughter-in-law.\n\nBut her fine face and brow were none the less inclined to frown. She\nherself as Katharine of Aragon would have shed a dignity on any scene,\nbut she was in no sympathy with what she beheld.\n\n\"We shall soon all of us be ashamed of this kind of thing,\" she declared\nto Kitty. \"Just as people now are beginning to be ashamed of enormous\nhouses and troops of servants.\"\n\n\"No, please! Only bored with them!\" said Kitty. \"There are so many other\nways now of amusing yourself--that's all.\"\n\n\"Well, this way will die out,\" said Lady Tranmore. \"The cost of it is\ntoo scandalous--people's consciences prick them.\"\n\nKitty vowed she did not believe there was a conscience in the room; and\nthen, as the music struck up, she carried off her companion to some\nsteps overlooking the great marble gallery, where they had a better view\nof the two lines of dancers.\n\nIt is said that as a nation the English have no gift for pageants. Yet\nevery now and then--as no doubt in the Elizabethan mask--they show a\nstrange felicity in the art. Certainly the dance that followed would\nhave been difficult to surpass even in the ripe days and motherlands of\npageantry. To the left, a long line, consisting mainly of young girls in\ntheir first bloom, dressed as Gainsborough and his great contemporaries\ndelighted to paint these flowers of England--the folds of plain white\nmuslin crossed over the young breast, a black velvet at the throat, a\nrose in the hair, the simple skirt showing the small pointed feet, and\nsometimes a broad sash defining the slender waist. Here were Stanleys,\nHowards, Percys, Villierses, Butlers, Osbornes--soft slips of girls\nbearing the names of England's rough and turbulent youth, bearing\nthemselves to-night with a shy or laughing dignity, as though the touch\nof history and romance were on them. And facing them, the youths of the\nsame families, no less handsome than their sisters and brides--in\nRomney's blue coats, or the splendid red of Reynolds and Gainsborough.\n\nTo and fro swayed the dancers, under the innumerable candles that filled\nthe arched roof and upper walls of the ballroom; and each time the lines\nparted they disclosed at the farther end another pageant, to which that\nof the dance was in truth subordinate--a dais hung with blue and silver,\nand upon it a royal lady whose beauty, then in its first bloom, has been\na national possession, since as, the \"sea-king's daughter\" she brought\nit in dowry to her adopted country. To-night she blazed in jewels as a\nValois queen, with her court around her, and as the dancers receded,\neach youth and maiden seemed instinctively to turn towards her as roses\nto the sun.\n\n\"Oh, beautiful, beautiful world!\" said Kitty to herself, in an ecstasy,\npressing her small hands together; \"how I love you!--_love_ you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile Darrell and Harman stood side by side near the doorway of the\nballroom, looking in when the crowd allowed.\n\n\"A strange sight,\" said Harman. \"Perhaps they take it too seriously.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is our English upper class,\" said Darrell, with a sneer. \"Is\nthere anything they take lightly?--_par exemple!_ It seems to me they\ncarry off this amusement better than most. They may be stupid, but they\nare good-looking. I say, Ashe\"--he turned towards the new-comer who had\njust sauntered up to them--\"on this exceptional occasion, is it allowed\nto congratulate you on Lady Kitty's gown?\"\n\nFor Kitty, raised upon her step, was at the moment in full view.\n\nAshe made some slight reply, the slightest of which indeed annoyed the\nthin-skinned and morbid Darrell, always on the lookout for affronts. But\nLouis Harman, who happened to observe the Under-Secretary's glance at\nhis wife, said to himself, \"By George! that queer marriage is turning\nout well, after all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Tudor and Marie Antoinette quadrilles had been danced. There was a\nrumor of supper in the air.\n\n\"William!\" said Kitty, in his ear, as she came across him in one of the\ndrawing-rooms, \"Lord Hubert takes me in to supper. Poor me!\" She made an\nextravagant face of self-pity and swept on. Lord Hubert was one of the\nsons of the house, a stupid and inarticulate guardsman, Kitty's butt and\ndetestation. Ashe smiled to himself over her fate, and went back to the\nballroom in search of his own lady.\n\nMeanwhile Kitty paused in the next drawing-room, and dismissed her\nfollowing.\n\n\"I promised to wait here for Lord Hubert,\" she said. \"You go on, or\nyou'll get no tables.\"\n\nAnd she waved them peremptorily away. The drawing-room, one of a suite\nwhich looked on the garden, thinned temporarily. In a happy fatigue,\nKitty leaned dreamily over the ledge of one of the open windows, looking\nat the illuminated space below her. Amid the colored lights, figures of\ndream and fantasy walked up and down. In the midst flashed a\nflame-colored fountain. The sounds of a Strauss waltz floated in the\nair. And beyond the garden and its trees rose the dull roar of London.\n\nA silk curtain floated out into the room under the westerly breeze,\nthen, returning, sheathed Kitty in its folds. She stood there hidden,\namusing herself like a child with the thought of startling that great\nheavy goose, Lord Hubert.\n\nSuddenly a pair of voices that she knew caught her ear. Two persons,\npassing through, lingered, without perceiving her. Kitty, after a first\nmovement of self-disclosure, caught her own name and stood motionless.\n\n\"Well, of course you've heard that we got through,\" said Lady Parham.\n\"For once Lady Kitty behaved herself!\"\n\n\"You were lucky!\" said Mary Lyster. \"Lady Tranmore was dreadfully\nanxious--\"\n\n\"Lest she should cut us at the last?\" cried Lady Parham. \"Well, of\ncourse, Lady Kitty is 'capable de tout.'\" She laughed. \"But perhaps as\nyou are a cousin I oughtn't to say these things.\"\n\n\"Oh, say what you like,\" said Mary. \"I am no friend of Kitty's, and\nnever pretended to be.\"\n\nLady Parham came closer, apparently, and said, confidentially: \"What on\nearth made that man marry her? He might have married anybody. She had\nno money, and worse than no position.\"\n\n\"She worked upon his pity, of course, a good deal. I saw them in the\nearly days at Grosville Park. She played her cards very cleverly. And\nthen, it was just the right moment. Lady Tranmore had been urging him to\nmarry.\"\n\n\"Well, of course,\" said Lady Parham, \"there's no denying the beauty.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" said Mary, as though in wonder. \"Well, I never could see\nit. And now she has so much gone off.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you. Many people think her the star to-night. Mr.\nCliffe, I am told, admires her.\"\n\nKitty could not see how the eyes of the speaker, under a Sir Joshua\nturban, studied the countenance of Miss Lyster, as she threw out the\nwords.\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"Poor Kitty! She tried to flirt with him long ago--just after she\narrived in London, fresh out of the convent. It was so funny! He told me\nafterwards he never was so embarrassed in his life--this baby making\neyes at him! And now--oh no!\"\n\n\"Why not now? Lady Kitty's very much the rage, and Mr. Cliffe likes\nnotoriety.\"\n\n\"But a notoriety with--well, with some style, some distinction! Kitty's\nsort is so cheap and silly.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, she's not to be despised,\" said Lady Parham. \"She's as clever\nas she can be. But her husband will have to keep her in order.\"\n\n\"Can he?\" said Mary. \"Won't she always be in his way?\"\n\n\"Always, I should think. But he must have known what he was about. Why\ndidn't his mother interfere? Such a family!--such a history!\"\n\n\"She did interfere,\" said Mary. \"We all did our best\"--she dropped her\nvoice--\"I know I did. But it was no use. If men like spoiled children\nthey must have them, I suppose. Let's hope he'll learn how to manage\nher. Shall we go on? I promised to meet my supper-partner in the\nlibrary.\"\n\nThey moved away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor some minutes Kitty stood looking out, motionless, but the beating of\nher heart choked her. Strange ancestral things--things of evil--things\nof passion--had suddenly awoke, as it were, from sleep in the depths of\nher being, and rushed upon the citadel of her life. A change had passed\nover her from head to foot. Her veins ran fire.\n\nAt that moment, turning round, she saw Geoffrey Cliffe enter the room in\nwhich she stood. With an impetuous movement she approached him.\n\n\"Take me down to supper, Mr. Cliffe. I can't wait for Lord Hubert any\nmore, I'm _so_ hungry!\"\n\n\"Enchanted!\" said Cliffe, the color leaping into his tanned face as he\nlooked down upon the goddess. \"But I came to find--\"\n\n\"Miss Lyster? Oh, she is gone in with Mr. Darrell. Come with me. I have\na ticket for the reserved tent. We shall have a delicious corner to\nourselves.\"\n\nAnd she took from her glove the little coveted paste-board,\nwhich--handed about in secret to a few intimates of the house--gave\naccess to the sanctum sanctorum of the evening.\n\nCliffe wavered. Then his vanity succumbed. A few minutes later the\nsupper guests in the tent of the _\u00c3\u00a9lite_ saw the entrance of a darkly\nsplendid Duke of Alva, with a little sandalled goddess. All compact, it\nseemed, of ivory and fire, on his arm.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThe spring freshness of London, had long since departed. A crowded\nseason; much animation in Parliament, where the government, to its own\namazement, had rather gained than lost ground; industrial trouble at\nhome, and foreign complications abroad; and in London the steady growth\nof a new plutocracy, the result, so far, of American wealth and American\nbrides. In the first week of July, the outward things of the moment\nmight have been thus summed up by any careful observer.\n\nOn a certain Tuesday night, the debate on a private member's bill\nunexpectedly collapsed, and the House rose early. Ashe left the House\nwith his secretary, but parted from him at the corner of Birdcage Walk,\nand crossed the park alone. He meant to join Kitty at a party in\nPiccadilly; there was just time to go home and dress; and he walked at a\nquick pace.\n\nTwo members sitting on the same side of the House with himself were also\ngoing home. One of them noticed the Under-Secretary.\n\n\"A very ineffective statement Ashe made to-night--don't you think so?\"\nhe said to his companion.\n\n\"Very! Really, if the government can't take up a stronger line, the\ngeneral public will begin to think there's something in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you only shriek long enough and sharp enough in England\nsomething's sure to come of it. Cliffe and his group have been playing a\nvery shrewd game. The government will get their agreement approved all\nright, but Cliffe has certainly made some people on our side uneasy.\nHowever--\"\n\n\"However, what?\" said the other, after a moment.\n\n\"I wish I thought that were the only reason for Ashe's change of tone,\"\nsaid the first speaker, slowly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe two were intimate personal friends, belonging, moreover, to a group\nof evangelical families well known in English life; but even so, the\nanswer came with reluctance:\n\n\"Well, you see, it's not very easy to grapple in public with the man\nwhose name all smart London happens to be coupling with that of your\nwife!\"\n\n\"I say\"--the other stood still, in genuine consternation and\ndistress--\"you don't mean to say that there's that in it!\"\n\n\"You notice that the difference is not in _what_ Ashe says, but in _how_\nhe says it. He avoids all personal collision with Cliffe. The government\nstick to their case, but Ashe mentions everybody but Cliffe, and\nconfutes all arguments but his. And meanwhile, of course, the truth is\nthat Cliffe is the head and front of the campaign, and if he threw up\nto-morrow, everything would quiet down.\"\n\n\"And Lady Kitty is flirting with him at this particular moment? Damned\nbad taste and bad feeling, to say the least of it!\"\n\n\"You won't find one of the Bristol lot consider that kind of thing when\ntheir blood is up!\" said the other. \"You remember the tales of old Lord\nBlackwater?\"\n\n\"But is there really any truth in it? Or is it mere gossip?\"\n\n\"Well, I hear that the behavior of both of them at Grosville Park last\nweek was such that Lady Grosville vows she will never ask either of them\nagain. And at Ascot, at Lord's, the opera, Lady Kitty sits with him,\ntalks with him, walks with him, the whole time, and won't look at any\none else. They must be asked together or neither will come--and\n'society,' as far as I can make out, thinks it a good joke and is always\nmaking plans to throw them together.\"\n\n\"Can't Lady Tranmore do anything?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They say she is very unhappy about it. Certainly she\nlooks ill and depressed.\"\n\n\"And Ashe?\"\n\nHis companion hesitated. \"I don't like to say it, but, of course, you\nknow there are many people who will tell you that Ashe doesn't care\ntwopence what his wife does so long as she is nice to him, and he can\nread his books and carry on his politics as he pleases!\"\n\n\"Ashe always strikes me as the soul of honor,\" said the other,\nindignantly.\n\n\"Of course--for himself. But a more fatalist believer in liberty than\nAshe doesn't exist--liberty especially to damn yourself--if you must and\nwill.\"\n\n\"It would be hard to extend that doctrine to a wife,\" said the other,\nwith a grave, uncomfortable laugh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile the man whose affairs they had been discussing walked home,\nwrapped in solitary and disagreeable thought. As he neared the\nMarlborough House corner a carriage passed him. It was delayed a moment\nby other carriages, and as it halted beside him Ashe recognized Lady\nM----, the hostess of the fancy ball, and a very old friend of his\nparents. He took off his hat. The lady within recognized him and\ninclined slightly--very slightly and stiffly. Ashe started a little and\nwalked on.\n\nThe meeting vividly recalled the ball, the _terminus a quo_ indeed from\nwhich the meditation in which he had been plunged since entering the\npark had started. Between six and seven weeks ago, was it? It might have\nbeen a century. He thought of Kitty as she was that night--Kitty\npirouetting in her glittering dress, or bending over the boy, or holding\nher face to his as he kissed her on the stairs. Never since had she\nshown him the smallest glimpse of such a mood. What was wrong with her\nand with himself? Something, since May, had turned their life\ntopsy-turvy, and it seemed to Ashe that in the general unprofitable rush\nof futile engagements he had never yet had time to stop and ask himself\nwhat it might be.\n\nWhy, at any rate, was _he_ in this chafing irritation and discomfort?\nWhy could he not deal with that fellow Cliffe as he deserved? And what\nin Heaven's name was the reason why old friends like Lady M---- were\nbeginning to look at him coldly, and avoid his conversation?\n\nHis mother, too! He gathered that quite lately there had been some\ndisagreeable scene between her and Kitty. Kitty had resented some\nremonstrance of hers, and for some days now they had not met. Nor had\nAshe seen his mother alone. Did she also avoid him, shrink from speaking\nout her real mind to him?\n\nWell, it was all monstrously absurd!--a great coil about nothing, as far\nas the main facts were concerned, although the annoyance and worry of\nthe thing were indeed becoming serious. Kitty had no doubt taken a wild\nliking to Geoffrey Cliffe--\n\n\"And, by George!\" said Ashe, pausing in his walk, \"she warned me.\"\n\nAnd there rose in his memory the formal garden at Grosville Park, the\nlittle figure at his side, and Kitty's franknesses--\"I shall take mad\nfancies for people. I sha'n't be able to help it. I have one now, for\nGeoffrey Cliffe.\"\n\nHe smiled. There was the difficulty! If only the people whose envious\ntongues were now wagging could see Kitty as she was, could understand\nwhat a gulf lay between her and the ordinary \"fast\" woman, there would\nbe an end of this silly, ill-natured talk. Other women might be of the\nearth earthy. Kitty was a sprite, with all the irresponsibility of such\nincalculable creatures. The men and women--women especially--who\ngossiped and lied about her, who sent abominable paragraphs to\nscurrilous papers--he had one now in his pocket which had reached him at\nthe House from an anonymous correspondent--spoke out of their own vile\nexperience, judged her by their own standards. His mother, at any\nrate--he proudly thought--ought to know better than to be misled by them\nfor a moment.\n\nAt the same time, something must be done. It could not be denied that\nKitty had been behaving like a romantic, excitable child with this\nunscrupulous man, whose record with regard to women was probably wholly\nunknown to her, however foolishly she might idealize the _liaison_\ncommemorated in his poems. What had Kitty, indeed, been doing with\nherself this six weeks? Ashe tried to recall them in detail. Ascot,\nLord's, innumerable parties in London and in the country, to some of\nwhich he had not been able to accompany her, owing to the stress of\nParliamentary and official work. Grosville Park, for instance--he had\nbeen stopped at the last moment from going down there by the arrival of\nsome important foreign news, and Kitty had gone alone. She had\nreappeared on the Monday, pale and furious, saying that she and her aunt\nhad quarrelled, and that she would never go near the Grosvilles either\nin town or country again. She had not volunteered any further\nexplanation, and Ashe had refrained from inquiry. There were in him\ncertain disgusts and disdains, belonging to his general epicurean\nconception of existence, which not even his love for Kitty could\novercome. One was a disdain for the quarrels of women. He supposed they\nwere inevitable; he saw, by-the-way, that Kitty and Lady Parham were\nonce more at daggers drawn; and Kitty seemed to enjoy it. Well, it was\nher own affair; but while there was a Greek play, or a Shakespeare\nsonnet, or even a Blue Book to read, who could expect him to listen?\n\nWhat had old Lady Grosville been about? He understood that Cliffe had\nbeen of the party. And Kitty must have done something to bring down upon\nher the wrath of the Puritanical mistress of the house.\n\nWell, what was he to do? It was now July. The session would last\ncertainly till the middle of August, and though the American business\nwould be disposed of directly, there was fresh trouble in the Balkan\nPeninsula, and an anxious situation in Egypt. Impossible that he should\nthink of leaving his post. And as for the chance of a dissolution, the\ngovernment was now a good deal stronger than it had been before\nEaster--worse luck!\n\nOf course he ought to take Kitty away. But short of resignation how was\nit to be done? And what, even, would resignation do--supposing, _per\nimpossibile_, it could be thought of--but give to gnawing gossip a\nbigger bone, and probably irritate Kitty to the point of rebellion? Yet\nhow induce her to go with any one else? Lady Tranmore was out of the\nquestion. Margaret French, perhaps?\n\nThen, suddenly, Ashe was assailed by an inner laughter, hollow and\ndiscomfortable. Things were come to a pretty pass when he must even\ndream of resigning because a man whom he despised would haunt his house,\nand absorb the company of his wife; when, moreover, he could not even\nthink of a remedy for such a state of things without falling back\ndismayed from the certainty of Kitty's temper--Kitty's wild and furious\ntemper.\n\nFor during the last fortnight, as it seemed to Ashe, all the winds of\ntempest had been blowing through his house. Himself, the servants, even\nMargaret, even the child, had all suffered. He also had lost his temper\nseveral times--such a thing had scarcely happened to him since his\nchildhood. He thought of it as of a kind of physical stain or weakness.\nTo keep an even and stoical mind, to laugh where one could not\nconquer--this had always seemed to him the first condition of decent\nexistence. And now to be wrangling over an expenditure, an engagement, a\nletter, the merest nothing--whether it was a fine day or it\nwasn't--could anything be more petty, degrading, intolerable?\n\nHe vowed that this should stop. Whatever happened, he and Kitty should\nnot degenerate into a pair of scolds--besmirch their life with quarrels\nas ugly as they were silly. He would wrestle with her, his beloved,\nunreasonable, foolish Kitty; he ought, of course, to have done so\nbefore. But it was only within the last week or so that the horizon had\nsuddenly darkened--the thing grown serious. And now this beastly\nparagraph! But, after all, what did such garbage matter? It would of\ncourse be a comfort to thrash the editor. But our modern life breeds\nsuch creatures, and they have to be borne.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe let himself into a silent house. His letters lay on the hall-table.\nAmong them was a handwriting which arrested him. He remembered, yet\ncould not put a name to it. Then he turned the envelope. \"H'm. Lady\nGrosville!\" He read it, standing there, then thrust it into his pocket,\nthinking angrily that there seemed to be a good many fools in this world\nwho occupied themselves with other people's business. Exaggeration, of\ncourse, damnable _parti pris_! When did she ever see Kitty except with a\njaundiced eye? \"I wonder Kitty condescends to go to the woman's house!\nShe must know that everything she does is seen there _en noir_.\nPharisaical, narrow-minded Philistines!\"\n\nThe letter acted as a tonic. Ashe was positively grateful to the \"old\ngorgon\" who wrote it. He ran up-stairs, his pulses tingling in defence\nof Kitty. He would show Lady Grosville that she could not write to him,\nat any rate, in that strain, with impunity.\n\nHe took a candle from the landing, and opened his wife's door in order\nto pass through her room to his own. As he did so, he ran against\nKitty's maid, Blanche, who was coming out. She shrank back as she saw\nhim, but not before the light of his candle had shone full upon her. Her\nface was disfigured with tears, which were, indeed, still running down\nher cheeks.\n\n\"Why, Blanche!\" he said, standing still--then in the kind voice which\nendeared him to the servants--\"I am afraid your brother is worse?\"\n\nFor the poor brother in hospital had passed through many vicissitudes\nsince his operation, and the little maid's spirits had fluctuated\naccordingly.\n\n\"Oh no, sir--no, sir!\" said Blanche, drying her eyes and retreating into\nthe shadows of the room, where only a faint flame of gas was burning.\n\"It's not that, sir, thank you. I was just putting away her ladyship's\nthings,\" she said, inconsequently, looking round the room.\n\n\"That was hardly what caused the tears, was it?\" said Ashe, smiling. \"Is\nthere anything in which Lady Kitty or I could help you?\"\n\nThe girl, who had always seemed to him on excellent terms with Kitty,\ngave a sudden sob.\n\n\"Thank you, sir; I've just given her ladyship warning.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Ashe, gravely. \"I'm sorry for that. I thought you got on\nhere very well.\"\n\n\"I used to, sir, but this last few weeks there's nothing pleases her\nladyship; you can't do anything right. I'm sure I've worked my hands\noff. But I can't do any more. Perhaps her ladyship will find some one\nelse to suit her better.\"\n\n\"Didn't her ladyship try to persuade you to stay?\"\n\n\"Yes--but--I gave warning once before, and then I stayed. And it's no\ngood. It seems as if you must do wrong. And I don't sleep, sir. It gets\non your nerves so. But I didn't mean to complain. Good-night, sir.\"\n\n\"Good-night. Don't sit up for your mistress. You look tired out. I'll\nhelp her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the maid, in a depressed voice, and went.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later, Ashe mounted the staircase of a well-known house in\nPiccadilly. The evening party was beginning to thin, but in a side\ndrawing-room a fine Austrian band was playing Strauss, and some of the\nintimates of the house were dancing.\n\nAshe at once perceived his wife. She was dancing with a clever Cambridge\nlad, a cousin of Madeleine Alcot's, who had long been one of her\nadorers. And so charming was the spectacle, so exhilarating were the\nyouth and beauty of the pair, that Ashe presently suspected what was\nindeed the truth, that most of the persons gathering in the room were\nthere to watch Kitty dance, rather than to dance themselves. He himself\nwatched her, though he professed to be talking to his hostess, a woman\nof middle age, with honest eyes and a brow of command.\n\n\"It is a delight to see Lady Kitty dance,\" she said to him, smiling.\n\"But she is tired. I am sure she wants the country.\"\n\n\"Like my boy,\" said Ashe. \"I wish to goodness they'd both go.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it's hard to leave the husband toiling in town!\" said his\ncompanion, who, as the daughter, wife, and mother of politicians, had\nhad a long experience of official life.\n\nAshe glanced at her--at her face moulded by kind and scrupulous\nliving--with a sudden relief from tension. Clearly no gossip had reached\nher. He lingered beside her, for the sheer pleasure of talking to her.\nBut their _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ was soon interrupted by the approach of Lady\nParham, with a daughter--a slim and silent girl, to whom, it was\nwhispered, her mother was giving \"a last chance\" this season, before\nsending her into the country as a failure, and bringing out her younger\nsister.\n\nLady Parham greeted the hostess with effusion. It was a rich house, and\nthese small, informal dances were said to be more helpful to matrimonial\ndevelopment than larger affairs. Then she perceived Ashe, and her whole\nmanner changed. There was a very evident bristling, and she gave him a\ngreeting deliberately careless.\n\n\"Confound the woman!\" thought Ashe, and his own pride rose.\n\n\"Working as hard as usual, Lady Parham?\" he asked her, with a smile.\n\n\"If you like to put it so,\" was the stiff reply. \"There is, of course, a\ngood deal of going out.\"\n\n\"I hope, if I may say so, you don't allow Lord Parham to do too much of\nit.\"\n\n\"Lord Parham never was better in his life,\" said Lord Parham's spouse,\nwith the air of putting down an impertinence.\n\n\"That's good news. I must say when I saw him this afternoon I thought he\nseemed to be feeling his work a good deal.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's worried,\" said Lady Parham, sharply. \"Worried about a good\nmany things.\" She turned suddenly, and looked at her companion--an\ninsolent and deliberate look.\n\n\"Ah, that's where the wives come in!\" replied Ashe, unperturbed. \"Look\nat Mrs. Loraine. She has the art to perfection--hasn't she? The way she\ncushions Loraine is something wonderful to see.\"\n\nLady Parham flushed angrily. The suggested comparison between herself,\nand that incessant rattle and blare of social event through which she\ndragged her husband--conducting thereby a vulgar campaign of her own, as\narduous as his and far more ambitious--and the ways and character of\ngentle Mrs. Loraine, absorbed in the man she adored, scatter-brained and\nabsent-minded towards the rest of the world, but for him all eyes and\nears, an angel of shelter and protection--this did not now reach the\nPrime Minister's wife for the first time. But she had no opportunity to\nlaunch a retort, even supposing she had one ready, for the music ceased,\nand the tide of dancers surged towards the doors. It brought Kitty\nabruptly face to face with Lady Parham.\n\n\"Oh! how d'you do?\" said Kitty, in a tone that was already an offence,\nand she held out a small hand with an indescribably regal air.\n\nLady Parham just touched it, glanced at the owner from top to toe, and\nwalked away. Kitty slipped in beside Ashe for a moment, with her back to\nthe wall, laughing and breathless.\n\n\"I say, Kitty,\" said Ashe, bending over her and speaking in her small\near, \"I thought Lady Parham was eternally obliged to us. What's wrong\nwith her?\"\n\n\"Only that I can't stand her,\" said Kitty. \"What's the good of trying?\"\nShe looked up, a flame of mutiny in her cheeks.\n\n\"What, indeed?\" said Ashe, feeling as reckless as she. \"Her manners are\nbeyond the bounds. But look here, Kitty, don't you think you'll come\nhome? You know you do look uncommonly tired.\"\n\nKitty frowned.\n\n\"Home? Why, I'm only just beginning to enjoy myself! Take me into the\ncool, please,\" she said to the boy who had been dancing with her, and\nwho still hovered near, in case his divinity might allow him yet a few\nmore minutes. But as she put out her hand to take his arm, Ashe saw her\nwaver and look suddenly across the room.\n\nA group parted that had been clustering round a farther door, and Ashe\nperceived Cliffe, leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed. He\nwas surrounded by pretty women, with whom he seemed to be carrying on a\nbantering warfare. Involuntarily Ashe watched for the recognition\nbetween him and Kitty. Did Kitty's lips move? Was there a signal? If so,\nit passed like a flash; Kitty hurried away, and Ashe was left, haughtily\nfurious with himself that, for the first time in his life, he had played\nthe spy.\n\nHe turned in his discomfort to leave the dancing-room. He himself\nenjoyed society frankly enough. Especially since his marriage had he\nfound the companionship of agreeable women delightful. He went\ninstinctively to seek it, and drive out this nonsense from his mind.\nJust inside the larger drawing-room, however, he came across Mary\nLyster, sitting in a corner apparently alone. Mary greeted him, but\nwith an evident coldness. Her manner brought back all the preoccupations\nof his walk from the House. In spite of her small cordiality, he sat\ndown beside her, wondering with a vicarious compunction at what point\nher fortunes might be, and how Kitty's proceedings might have already\naffected them. But he had not yet succeeded in thawing her when a voice\nbehind him said:\n\n\"This is my dance, I think, Miss Lyster. Where shall we sit it out?\"\n\nAshe moved at once. Mary looked up, hesitated visibly, then rose and\ntook Geoffrey Cliffe's arm.\n\n\"Just read your remarks this evening,\" said Cliffe to Ashe. \"Well, now,\nI suppose to-morrow will see your ship in port?\"\n\nFor it was reasonably expected that the morrow would see the American\nagreement ratified by a substantial ministerial majority.\n\n\"Certainly. But you may at least reflect that you have lost us a deal of\ntime.\"\n\n\"And now you slay us,\" said Cliffe. \"Ah, well--'_dulce et decorum est_,'\netcetera.\"\n\n\"Don't imagine that you'll get many of the honors of martyrdom,\" laughed\nAshe--in Cliffe's eyes an offensive and triumphant figure, as he leaned\ncarelessly upon a marble pedestal that carried a bust of Horace Walpole.\n\n\"Why?\" Cliffe's hand had gone instinctively to his mustache. Mary had\ndropped his arm, and now stood quietly beside him, pale and somewhat\njaded, her fine eyes travelling between the speakers.\n\n\"Why? Because the heresies have no martyrs. The halo is for the true\nChurch!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Cliffe, with a reflective sneer. \"I suppose you mean for the\nsuccessful?\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said Ashe, with nonchalance. \"Aren't the true Church the people\nwho are justified by the event?\"\n\n\"The orthodox like to think so,\" said Cliffe. \"But the heretics have a\nway of coming out top.\"\n\n\"Does that mean you chaps are going to win at the next election? I\ndevoutly hope you may--_we_'re all as stale as ditch-water--and as for\nplaces, anybody's welcome to mine!\" And so saying, Ashe lounged away,\nattracted by the bow and smile of a pretty Frenchwoman, with whom it was\nalways agreeable to chat.\n\n\"Ashe trifles it as usual,\" said Cliffe, as he and Mary forced a passage\ninto one of the smaller rooms. \"Is there anything in the world that he\nreally cares about?\"\n\nMary looked at him with a start. It was almost on her lips to say, \"Yes!\nhis wife.\" She only just succeeded in driving the words back.\n\n\"His not caring is a pretence,\" she said. \"At least, Lady Tranmore\nthinks so. She believes that he is becoming absorbed in politics--much\nmore ambitious than she ever thought he would be.\"\n\n\"That's the way of mothers,\" said Cliffe, with a sarcastic lip. \"They\nhave got to make the best of their sons. Tell me what you are going to\ndo this summer.\"\n\nHe had thrown one arm round the back of a chair, and sat looking down\nupon her, his colorless fair hair falling thick upon his brow, and\ngiving by contrast a strange inhuman force to the dark and singular eyes\nbeneath. He had a way of commanding a woman's attention by flashes of\nbrusquerie, melting when he chose into a homage that had in it the note\nof an older world, a world that had still leisure for, passion and its\nrefinements, a world still within sight of that other which had produced\nthe _Carte du tendre_. Perhaps it was this, combined with the\nvirilities, not to be questioned, of his aspect, the signs of hard\nphysical endurance in the face burned by desert suns, and the\nsuggestions of a frame too lean and gaunt for drawing-rooms, that gave\nhim his spell and preserved it.\n\nMary's conversation with him consisted at first of much cool fencing on\nher part, which gradually slipped back, as he intended it should, into\nsome of the tones of intimacy. Each meanwhile was conscious of a secret\nrange of thoughts--hers concerned with the effort and struggle, the\nbitter disappointments and disillusions of the past six weeks; and his\nwith the schemes he had cherished in the East and on the way home, of\nmarrying Mary Lyster, or more correctly, Mary Lyster's money, and so\nresigning himself to the inevitable boredoms of an English existence.\nFor her the mental horizon was full of Kitty--Kitty insolent,\nKitty triumphant. For him, too, Kitty made the background of\nthought--environed, however, with clouds of indecision and resistance\nthat would have raised happiness in Mary could she have divined them.\n\nFor he was now not easy to capture. There had been enough and more than\nenough of women in his life. The game of politics must somehow replace\nthem henceforth, if, indeed, anything were still worth while, except the\nlong day in the saddle and the dawn of new mornings in untrodden lands.\n\nMingled, all these, with hot dislike of Ashe, with the fascination of\nKitty, and a kind of venomous pleasure in the commotion produced by his\npursuit of her; inter penetrated, moreover, through and through with the\nmemory of his one true feeling, and of the woman who had died, alienated\nfrom and despising him. He and Mary passed a profitless half-hour. He\nwould have liked to propitiate her, but he had no notion what he should\ndo with the propitiation, if it were reached. He wanted her money, but\nhe was beginning to feel with restlessness that he could not pay the\ncost. The poet in him was still strong, crossed though it were by the\nadventurer.\n\nHe took her back to the dancing-room. Mary walked beside him with a\ndull, fierce sense of wrong. It was Kitty, of course, who had done\nit--Kitty who had taken him away from her.\n\n\"That's finished,\" said Cliffe to himself, with a long breath of relief,\nas he delivered her into the hands of her partner. \"Now for the other!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThenceforward, no one saw Kitty and no one danced with her. She spent\nher time in beflowered corners, or remote drawing-rooms, with Geoffrey\nCliffe. Ashe heard her voice in the distance once or twice, answering a\nvoice he detested; he looked into the supper-room with a lady on his\narm, and across it he saw Kitty, with her white elbow on the table and\nher hand propping a face that was turned--half mocking and yet wholly\nabsorbed--to Cliffe. He saw her flitting across vistas or disappearing\nthrough far doorways, but always with that sinister figure in\nattendance.\n\nHis mind was divided between a secret fury--roused in him by the pride\nof a man of high birth and position, who has always had the world at\ncommand, and now sees an impertinence offered him which he does not know\nhow to punish--and a mood of irony. Cliffe's persecution of Kitty was a\npiece of confounded bad manners. But to look at it with the round,\nhypocritical eyes some of these people were bringing to bear on it was\nreally too much! Let them look to their own affairs--they needed it.\n\nAt last the party broke up. Kitty touched him on the shoulder as he was\nstanding on the stairs, apparently absorbed in a teasing skirmish with a\ncharming child in her first season, who thought him the most delightful\nof men.\n\n\"I'm ready, William.\"\n\nHe turned sharply, and saw that she was alone.\n\n\"Come along, then! In five minutes more I should have been asleep on the\nstairs.\"\n\nThey descended. Kitty went for her cloak. Ashe sent for the carriage. As\nhe was standing on the steps Cliffe pushed past him and called for a\nhansom. It came in the rear of two or three carriages already under the\nportico. He ran along the pavement and jumped in. The doors were just\nbeing shut by the linkman when a little figure in a white cloak flew\ndown the steps of the house and held up a hand to the driver of the\nhansom.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" said Lady Parham, in a voice of suppressed but\ncontemptuous amazement, as she turned to Mary Lyster, who was driving\nhome with her. \"Call my carriage, please!\" she said, imperiously, to one\nof the footmen at the door. Her carriage, as it happened, was\nimmediately behind the hansom; but the hansom could not move because of\nthe small lady who had jumped upon the step and was leaning eagerly\nforward.\n\nThere was a clamor of shouting voices: \"Move on, cabby! Move on!\" \"Stand\nclear, ma'am, please,\" said the driver, while Cliffe opened the door of\nthe cab, and seemed about to jump down again.\n\n\"Who is it?\" said an impatient judge behind Lady Parham. \"What's the\nmatter?\"\n\nLady Parham shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"It's Lady Kitty Ashe,\" whispered the _d\u00c3\u00a9butante_, who was the judge's\ndaughter, \"talking to Mr. Cliffe. Isn't she pretty?\"\n\nA sudden silence fell upon the group in the porch. Kitty's high, clear\nlaugh seemed to ring back into the house. Then Ashe ran down the steps.\n\n\"Kitty, don't stop the way.\" He peremptorily drew her back.\n\nCliffe raised his hat, fell back into the hansom, and the man whipped up\nhis horse.\n\nKitty came back to the outer hall with Ashe. Her cheeks had a rose\nflush, her wild eyes laughed at the crowd on the steps, without really\nseeing them.\n\n\"Are you going with Lady Parham?\" she said, absently, to Mary Lyster.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nKitty looked up and Ashe saw the two faces as she and Mary confronted\neach other--the contempt in Mary's, the startled wrath in Kitty's.\n\n\"Come, Miss Lyster!\" said Lady Parham, and pushing past the Ashes\nwithout a good-night, she hurried to her carriage, drawing up the glass\nwith a hasty hand, though the night was balmy.\n\nFor a few moments none of those left on the steps spoke, except to fret\nin undertones for an absent carriage. Then Ashe saw his own groom, and\nstormed at him for delay. In another minute he and Kitty were in the\ncarriage, and the figures under the porch dropped out of sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Better not do that again, Kitty, I think,\" said Ashe.\n\nKitty glanced at him. But both voice and manner were as usual. \"Why\nshouldn't I?\" she said, haughtily; he saw that she had grown very white.\n\"I was telling Geoffrey where to find me at Lord's.\"\n\nAshe winced at the \"Archangelism\" of the Christian name.\n\n\"You kept Lady Parham waiting.\"\n\n\"What does that matter?\" said Kitty, with an angry laugh.\n\n\"And you did Cliffe too much honor,\" said Ashe. \"It's the men who should\nstand on the steps--not the women!\"\n\nKitty sat erect. \"What do you mean?\" she said, in a low, menacing voice.\n\n\"Just what I say,\" was the laughing reply.\n\nKitty threw herself back in her corner, and could not be induced to open\nher lips or look at her companion till they reached home.\n\nOn the landing, however, outside her bedroom, she turned and said:\n\"Don't, please, say impertinent things to me again!\" And drawn up to her\nfull height, the most childish and obstinate of tragedy queens, she\nswept into her room.\n\nAshe went into his dressing-room. And almost immediately afterwards he\nheard the key turn in the lock which separated his room from Kitty's.\n\nFor the first time since their marriage! He threw himself on his bed,\nand passed some sleepless hours. Then fatigue had its way. When he\nawoke, there was a gray dawn in the room, and he was conscious of\nsomething pressing against his bed. Half asleep, he raised himself and\nsaw Kitty, in a long white dressing-gown, sitting curled up on the\nfloor, or rather on a pillow, her head resting on the edge of the bed.\nIn a glass opposite he saw the languid grace of her slight form and the\ncloud of her hair.\n\n\"Kitty\"--he tried to shake himself into full consciousness--\"do go to\nbed!\"\n\n\"Lie down,\" said Kitty, lifting her arm and pressing him down, \"and\ndon't say anything. I shall go to sleep.\"\n\nHe lay down obediently. Presently he felt that her cheek was resting on\none of his hands, and in his semi-consciousness he laid the other on her\nhair. Then they both fell asleep.\n\nHis dreams were a medley of the fancy ball and of some pageant scene in\nwhich Iris and Ceres appeared, and there was a rustic dance of maidens\nand shepherds. Then a murmur as of thunder ran through the scene,\nfollowed by darkness. He half woke, in a hot distress, but the soft\ncheek was still there, his hand still felt the silky curls, and sleep\nrecaptured him.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nWhen Ashe woke up in earnest he was alone. He sprang up in bed and\nlooked round the darkened room, ashamed of his long sleep; but there was\nno sign of Kitty.\n\nAfter dressing, he knocked, as usual, at Kitty's door.\n\n\"Oh, come in,\" cried Kitty's lightest voice. \"Margaret's here; but if\nyou don't mind her, she won't mind you.\"\n\nAshe entered. Kitty, as was her wont four days out of the seven, was\nbreakfasting in bed. Margaret French was beside her with a batch of\nnotes, mostly bills and unanswered invitations, with which she was\ntrying to make Kitty cope.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Ashe,\" Margaret lifted a smiling face. \"I had to be out\non business for my brother all day, so I thought I'd come early and\nremind Kitty of some of these tiresome things while there was still a\nchance of finding her.\"\n\n\"I don't know why guardian angels excuse themselves,\" said Ashe, as they\nshook hands.\n\n\"Oh, dear, what a lot of them there are!\" said Kitty, tossing over the\nnotes with a bored air. \"Refuse them all, Margaret; I'm tired to death\nof dining out.\"\n\n\"Not all, I think,\" pleaded Margaret. \"Here's that nice woman--you\nremember--who wanted to thank Mr. Ashe for what he'd done for her son.\nYou promised to dine with her.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" Kitty wriggled with annoyance. \"Well, then, I suppose we must.\nWhat did William do for her? When I ask him to do something for the\nnicest boys in the world, he won't lift a finger.\"\n\n\"I gave him some introductions in Berlin,\" laughed Ashe. \"What you\ngenerally want me to do, Kitty, is to stuff the public service with\ngood-looking idiots. And there I really can't oblige you.\"\n\n\"Every one knows that corruption gets the best men,\" said Kitty. \"Hullo,\nwhat's that?\" and she lifted a dinner-card, and looked at it strangely.\n\n\"My dear Kitty! when did it come?\" exclaimed Margaret French, in dismay.\n\nIt was a dinner-card, whereby Lord and Lady Parham requested the honor\nof Mr. and Lady Kitty Ashe's company at dinner, on a date somewhere\nwithin the first week of July.\n\nAshe bent over to look at it.\n\n\"I think that came ten days ago,\" he said, quietly. \"I imagined Kitty\naccepted it.\"\n\n\"I never thought of it from that day to this,\" said Kitty, who had\nclasped her hands behind her head and was staring at the ceiling. \"Say,\nplease, that\"--she spaced out the words deliberately--\"Mr. and Lady\nKitty Ashe--are unable to accept--Lord and Lady Parham's\ninvitation--etc.--\"\n\n\"Kitty!\" said Margaret, firmly, \"there must be a 'regret' and a 'kind.'\nThink! Ten days! The party is next week!\"\n\n\"No 'regret,' and no 'kind'!\" said Kitty, still staring overhead. \"It's\nmy affair, please, Margaret, altogether. And I'll see the note before it\ngoes, or you'll be putting in civilities.\"\n\nMargaret, in despair, looked entreatingly at Ashe. He and she had often\nconspired before this to soften down Kitty's enormities. But he said\nnothing--made not the smallest sign.\n\nWith difficulty Margaret got a few more directions out of Kitty, over\nwhom a shade of sombre taciturnity had now fallen. Then, saying she\nwould write the notes down-stairs and come back, she gathered up her\nbasketful of letters and departed.\n\nAs soon as she was alone with Ashe, Kitty took up a novel beside her,\nand pretended to be absorbed in it.\n\nHe hesitated a moment, then he stooped over her and took her hand.\n\n\"Why did you come in to visit me, Kitty?\" he said, in a low voice.\n\n\"I don't know,\" was her indifferent reply, and her hand pulled itself\naway, though not with violence.\n\n\"I wish I could understand you, Kitty.\" His tone was not quite steady.\n\n\"Well, I don't understand myself!\" said Kitty, shortly, reaching out for\na bunch of roses that Margaret had just brought her, and burying her\nface among them.\n\n\"Perhaps, if you submitted the problem to me,\" said Ashe, laughing, \"we\nmight be able to thresh it out together!\"\n\nHe folded his arms and leaned against the foot of the bed, delighting\nhis eyes with the vision of her amid the folds of muslin and lace, and\nall the costly refinements of pillow and coverlet with which she liked\nto surround herself at that hour of the morning. She might have been a\nFrench princess of the old regime, receiving her court.\n\nKitty shook her head. The roses fell idly from her hands, and made\nbright patches of blush pink about her. Ashe went on:\n\n\"Anyway, dear, don't give silly tongues _too_ good a handle!\"\n\nHe threw her a gay comrade's look, as though to say that they both knew\nthe folly of the world, but he perhaps the better, as he was the elder.\n\n\"You mean,\" said Kitty, calmly, \"that I am not to talk so much to\nGeoffrey Cliffe?\"\n\n\"Is he worth it?\" said Ashe. \"That's what I want to know--worth the fuss\nthat some people make?\"\n\n\"It's the fuss and the people that drive one on,\" said Kitty, under her\nbreath.\n\n\"You flatter them too much, darling! Do you think you were quite kind to\nme last night?--let's put it that way. I looked a precious fool, you\nknow, standing on those steps, while you were keeping old Mother Parham\nand the whole show waiting!\"\n\nShe looked at him a moment in silence, at his heightened color and\ninsistent eyes.\n\n\"I can't think what made you marry me,\" she said, slowly.\n\nAshe laughed, and came nearer.\n\n\"And I can't think,\" he said, in a lower voice, \"what made you come--if\nyou weren't a little bit sorry--and lean your dear head against me like\nthat, last night.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sorry--I couldn't sleep,\" was her quick reply, while her eyes\nstrove to keep up their war with his.\n\nA knock was heard at the door. Ashe moved hastily away. Kitty's maid\nentered.\n\n\"I was to tell you, sir, that your breakfast was ready. And Lady\nTranmore's servant has brought this note.\"\n\nAshe took it and thrust it into his pocket.\n\n\"Get my things ready, please,\" said Kitty to her maid. Ashe felt himself\ndismissed and went.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, Kitty sprang out of bed, threw on a\ndressing-gown, and ran across to Blanche, who was bending over a chest\nof drawers. \"Why did you say those foolish things to me yesterday?\" she\ndemanded, taking the girl impetuously by the arm, and so startling her\nthat she nearly dropped the clothes she held.\n\n\"They weren't foolish, my lady,\" said Blanche, sullenly, with averted\neyes.\n\n\"They were!\" cried Kitty. \"Of course, I'm a vixen--I always was. But you\nknow, Blanche, I'm not always as bad as I have been lately. Very soon I\nshall be quite charming again--you'll see!\"\n\n\"I dare say, my lady.\" Blanche went on sorting and arranging the\n_lingerie_ she had taken out of the drawer.\n\nKitty sat down beside her, nursing a bare foot which was crossed over\nthe other.\n\n\"You know how I abused you about my hair, Blanche? Well, Mrs. Alcot\nsaid, that very night, she never saw it so well done. She thought it\nmust be Pierrefitte's best man. Wasn't it hellish of me? I knew quite\nwell you'd done it beautifully.\"\n\nThe maid said nothing, but a tear fell on one of Kitty's night-dresses.\n\n\"And you remember the green garibaldi--last week? I just loathed\nit--because you'd forgotten that little black rosette.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Blanche, looking up; \"your ladyship had never ordered it.\"\n\n\"I did--I did! But never mind. Two of my friends have wanted to copy it,\nBlanche. They wouldn't believe it was done by a maid. They said it had\nsuch style. One of them would engage you to-morrow if you really want to\ngo--\"\n\nA silence.\n\n\"But you won't go, Blanchie, will you?\" said Kitty's silver voice. \"I'm\na horrid fiend, but I did get Mr. Ashe to help your young man--and I did\ncare about your poor brother--and--and--\" she stroked the girl's arm--\"I\ndo look rather nice when I'm dressed, don't I? You wouldn't like a great\ngawk to dress, would you?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't want to leave your ladyship,\" said the girl, choking.\n\"But I can't have no more--\"\n\n\"No more ructions?\" said Kitty, meditating. \"H'm, of course that's\nserious, because I'm made so. Well, now, look here, Blanchie, you won't\ngive me warning again for a fortnight, whatever I do, mind. And if by\nthen I'm past praying for, you may. And I'll import a Russian--or a\nChoctaw--who won't understand when I call her names. Is that a bargain,\nBlanchie?\"\n\nThe maid hesitated.\n\n\"Just a fortnight!\" said Kitty, in her most seductive tones.\n\n\"Very well, my lady.\"\n\nKitty jumped up, waltzed round the room, the white silk skirts of her\ndressing-gown floating far and wide, then thrust her feet into her\nslippers, and began to dress as though nothing had happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut when her toilette was accomplished, Kitty having dismissed her maid,\nsat for some time in front of her mirror in a brown study.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter with me?\" she thought. \"William is an angel, and I\nlove him. And I can't do what he wants--I _can't_!\" She drew a long,\ntroubled breath. The lips of the face reflected in the glass were dry\nand colorless, the eyes had a strange, shrinking expression. \"People\n_are_ possessed--I know they are. They can't help themselves. I began\nthis to punish Mary--and now--when I don't see Geoffrey, everything is\nodious and dreary. I can't care for anything. Of course, I ought to care\nfor William's politics. I expect I've done him harm--I know I have.\nWhat's wrong with me?\"\n\nBut suddenly, in the very midst of her self-examination, the emotion and\nexcitement that she had felt of late in her long conversations with\nCliffe returned upon her, filling her at once with poignant memory and a\nkeen expectation to which she yielded herself as a wild sea-bird to the\nrocking of the sea. They had started--those conversations--from her\nattempt to penetrate the secret history of the man whose poems had\nfilled her with a thrilling sense of feelings and passions beyond her\nken--untrodden regions, full, no doubt, of shadow and of poison, but\ninfinitely alluring to one whose nature was best summed up in the two\nwords, curiosity and daring. She had not found it quite easy. Cliffe, as\nwe know, had resented the levity of her first attempt. But when she\nrenewed it, more seriously and sweetly, combining with it a number of\nsubtle flatteries, the flattery of her beauty and her position, of the\nprivate interest she could not help showing in the man who was her\nhusband's public antagonist, and of an admiration for his poems which\nwas not so much mere praise as an actual covetous sharing in them, a\nmaking their ideas and their music her own--Cliffe could not in the end\nresist her. After all, so far, she only asked him to talk of himself,\nand for a man of his type the process is the very breath of his being,\nthe stimulus and liberation of all his powers.\n\nSo that before they knew they were in the midst of the most burning\nsubjects of human discussion--at first in a manner comparatively veiled\nand general, then with the sharpest personal reference to Cliffe's own\nstory, as the intimacy between them grew. Jealousy, suffering, the \"hard\ncases\" of passion--why men are selfish and exacting, why women mislead\nand torment--the ugly waste and crudity of death--it was among these\ngreat themes they found themselves. Death above all--it was to a thought\nof death that Cliffe's harsh face owed its chief spell perhaps in\nKitty's eyes. A woman had died for love of him, crushed by his jealousy\nand her own self-scorn. So Kitty had been told; and Cliffe's tortured\nvanity would not deny it. How could she have cared so much? That was the\npuzzle.\n\nBut this vicarious relation had now passed into a relation of her own.\nCliffe was to Kitty a problem--and a problem which, beyond a certain\npoint, defied her. The element of sex, of course, entered in, but only\nas intensifying the contrasts and mysteries of imagination. And he made\nher feel these contrasts and mysteries as she had never yet felt them;\nand so he enlarged the world for her, he plunged her, if only by\ncontact with his own bitter and irritable genius, into new regions of\nsentiment and feeling. For in spite of the vulgar elements in him there\nwere also elements of genius. The man was a poet and a thinker, though\nhe were at the same time, in some sense, an adventurer. His mind was\nstored with eloquent and beautiful imagery, the poetry of others, and\npoetry of his own. He could pursue the meanest personal objects in an\nunscrupulous way; but he had none the less passed through a wealth of\ntragic circumstance; he had been face to face with his own soul in the\nwilds of the earth; he had met every sort of physical danger with\ncontempt; and his arrogant, imperious temper was of the kind which\nattracts many women, especially, perhaps, women physically small and\nintellectually fearless, like Kitty, who feel in it a challenge to their\npower and their charm.\n\nHis society, then, had in these six weeks become, for Kitty, a\npassion--a passion of the imagination. For the man himself, she would\nprobably have said that she felt more repulsion than anything else. But\nit was a repulsion that held her, because of the constant sense of\nreaction, of on-rushing life, which it excited in herself.\n\nAdd to these the elements of mischief and defiance in the situation, the\nsnatching him from Mary, her enemy and slanderer, the defiance of Lady\nGrosville and all other hypocritical tyrants, the pride of dragging at\nher chariot wheels a man whom most people courted even when they loathed\nhim, who enjoyed, moreover, an astonishing reputation abroad, especially\nin that France which Kitty adored, as a kind of modern Byron, the only\nEnglishman who could still display in public the \"pageant of a bleeding\nheart,\" without making himself ridiculous, and perhaps enough has been\nheaped together to explain the infatuation that now, like a wild spring\ngust on a shining lake, was threatening to bring Kitty's light bark into\ndangerous waters.\n\n\"I don't care for him,\" she said to herself, as she sat thinking alone,\n\"but I must see him--I _will_! And I will talk to him as I please, and\nwhere I please!\"\n\nHer small frame stiffened under the obstinacy of her resolution. Kitty's\nwill at a moment of this kind was a fatality--so strong was it, and so\nirrational.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, down-stairs, Ashe himself was wrestling with another phase of\nthe same situation. Lady Tranmore's note had said: \"I shall be with you\nalmost immediately after you receive this, as I want to catch you before\nyou go to the Foreign Office.\"\n\nAccordingly, they were in the library, Ashe on the defensive, Lady\nTranmore nervous, embarrassed, and starting at a sound. Both of them\nwatched the door. Both looked for and dreaded the advent of Kitty.\n\n\"Dear William,\" said his mother at last, stretching her hand across a\nsmall table which stood between them and laying it on her son's, \"you'll\nforgive me, won't you?--even if I do seem to you prudish and absurd. But\nI am afraid you _ought_ to tell Kitty some of the unkind things people\nare saying! You know I've tried, and she wouldn't listen to me. And you\nought to beg her--yes, William, indeed you ought!--not to give any\nfurther occasion for them.\"\n\nShe looked at him anxiously, full Of that timidity which haunts the\ndeepest and tenderest affections. She had just given him to read a\nletter from Lady Grosville to herself. Ashe ran through it, then laid it\ndown with a gesture of scorn.\n\n\"Kitty apparently enjoyed a moonlight walk with Cliffe. Why shouldn't\nshe? Lady Grosville thinks the moon was made to sleep by--other people\ndon't.\"\n\n\"But, William!--at night--when everybody had gone to bed--escaping from\nthe house--they two alone!\"\n\nLady Tranmore looked at him entreatingly, as though driven to protest,\nand yet hating the sound of her own words.\n\nAshe laughed. He was smoking with an air so nonchalant that his mother's\nheart sank. For she divined that criticism in the society around her\nwhich she was never allowed to hear. Was it true, indeed, that his\nnatural indolence could not rouse itself even to the defence of a young\nwife's reputation?\n\n\"All the fault of the Grosvilles,\" said Ashe, after a moment, lighting\nanother cigarette, \"in shutting up their great heavy house, and drawing\ntheir great heavy curtains on a May night, when all reasonable people\nwant to be out-of-doors. My dear mother, what's the good of paying any\nattention to what people like Lady Grosville say of people like Kitty?\nYou might as well expect Deborah to hit it off with Ariel!\"\n\n\"William, don't laugh!\" said his mother, in distress. \"Geoffrey Cliffe\nis not a man to be trusted. You and I know that of old. He is a boaster,\nand--\"\n\n\"And a liar!\" said Ashe, quietly. \"Oh! I know that.\"\n\n\"And yet he has this power over women--one ought to look it in the\nface. William, dearest William!\" she leaned over and clasped his hand\nclose in both hers, \"do persuade Kitty to go away from London now--at\nonce!\"\n\n\"Kitty won't go,\" said Ashe, quietly, \"I am sorry, dear mother. I hate\nthat you should be worried. But there's the fact. Kitty won't go!\"\n\n\"Then use your authority,\" said Lady Tranmore.\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"William!\" Ashe rose from his seat, and began to walk up and down. His\naspect of competence and dignity, as of a man already accustomed to\ncommand and destined to a high experience, had never been more marked\nthan at the very moment of this helpless utterance. His mother looked at\nhim with mingled admiration and amazement.\n\nPresently he paused beside her.\n\n\"I should like you to understand me, mother. I cannot fight with Kitty.\nBefore I asked her to marry me, I made up my mind to that. I knew then\nand I know now that nothing but disaster could come of it. She must be\nfree, and I shall not attempt to coerce her.\"\n\n\"Or to protect her!\" cried his mother.\n\n\"As to that, I shall do what I can. But I clearly foresaw when we\nmarried that we should scandalize a good many of the weaker brethren.\"\n\nHe smiled, but, as it seemed to his mother, with some effort.\n\n\"William! as a public man--\"\n\nHe interrupted her.\n\n\"If I can be both Kitty's husband and a public man, well and good. If\nnot, then I shall be--\"\n\n\"Kitty's husband?\" cried Lady Tranmore, with an accent of bitterness,\nalmost of sarcasm, of which she instantly repented her. She changed her\ntone.\n\n\"It is, of course, Kitty, first and foremost, who is concerned in your\npublic position,\" she said, more gently. \"Dearest William--she is so\nyoung still--she probably doesn't quite understand, in spite of her\ngreat cleverness. But she _does_ care--she _must_ care--and she ought to\nknow what slight things may sometimes affect a man's prospects and\nfuture in this country.\"\n\nAshe said nothing. He turned on his heel and resumed his pacing. Lady\nTranmore looked at him in perplexity.\n\n\"William, I heard a rumor last night--\"\n\nHe held his cigarette suspended.\n\n\"Lord Crashaw told me that the resignations would certainly be in the\npapers this week, and that the ministry would go on--after a\nrearrangement of posts. Is it true?\"\n\nAshe resumed his cigarette.\n\n\"True--as to the facts--so far as I know. As to the date, Lord Crashaw\nknows, I think, no more than I do. It may be this week, it may be next\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Then I hear--thank goodness I never see her,\" Elizabeth went on,\nreluctantly--\"that that dreadful woman, Lady Parham, is more infuriated\nthan ever--\"\n\n\"With Kitty? Let her be! It really doesn't matter an old shoe, either to\nKitty or me.\"\n\n\"She can be a most bitter enemy, William. And she certainly influences\nLord Parham.\"\n\nAshe smoked and smiled. Lady Tranmore saw that his pride, too, had been\naroused, and that here he was likely to prove as obstinate as Kitty.\n\n\"I wish I could get her out of my mind!\" she sighed.\n\nAshe glanced at her kindly.\n\n\"I daresay we shall hold our own. Xanthippe is not beloved, and I don't\nbelieve Parham will let her interfere with what he thinks best for the\nparty. Will it pay to put me in the cabinet or not?--that's what he'll\nask. I shall be strongly backed, too, by most of our papers.\"\n\nA number of thoughts ran through Lady Tranmore's brain. With her long\nexperience of London, she knew well what the sudden lowering of a man's\n\"consideration\"--to use a French word--at a critical moment may mean. A\ncooling of the general regard--a breath of detraction coming no one\nknows whence--and how soon new claims emerge, and the indispensable of\nyesterday becomes the negligible of to-day!\n\nBut even if she could have brought herself to put any of these anxieties\ninto words, she had no opportunity. Kitty's voice was in the hall; the\nhandle turned, and she ran in.\n\n\"William! Ah!--I didn't know mother was here.\"\n\nShe went up to Elizabeth, and lightly kissed that lady's cheek.\n\n\"Good-morning. William, I just came to tell you that I may be late for\ndinner, so perhaps you had better dine at the House. I am going on the\nriver.\"\n\n\"Are you?\" said Ashe, gathering up his papers. \"Wish I was.\"\n\n\"Are you going with the Crashaw's party?\" asked Elizabeth. \"I know they\nhave one.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!\" said Kitty. \"I hate a crowd on the river. I am going\nwith Geoffrey Cliffe.\"\n\nAshe bent over his desk. Lady Tranmore's eyebrows went up, and she could\nnot restrain the word:\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"_Naturellement_!\" laughed Kitty. \"He reads me French poetry, and we\ntalk French. We let Madeleine Alcot come once, but her accent was so\nshocking that Geoffrey wouldn't have her again!\"\n\nLady Tranmore flushed deeply. The \"Geoffrey\" seemed to her intolerable.\nKitty, arrayed in the freshest of white gowns, walked away to the\nfarther end of the library to consult a _Bradshaw_. Elizabeth, looking\nup, caught her son's eyes--and the mingled humor and vexation in them,\nwherewith he appealed to her, as it were, to see the whole silly\nbusiness as he himself did. Lady Tranmore felt a moment's strong\nreaction. Had she indeed been making a foolish fuss about nothing?\n\nYet the impression left by the miserable meditations of her night was\nstill deep enough to make her say--with just a signal from eye and lips,\nso that Kitty neither saw nor heard--\"Don't let her go!\"\n\nAshe shook his head. He moved towards the door, and stood there\ndespatch-box in hand, throwing a last look at his wife.\n\n\"Don't be late, Kitty--or I shall be nervous. I don't trust Cliffe on\nthe river. And please make it a rule that, in locks, he stops quoting\nFrench poetry.\"\n\nKitty turned round, startled and apparently annoyed by his tone.\n\n\"He is an excellent oar,\" she said, shortly.\n\n\"Is he? At Oxford we tried him for the Torpids--\" Ashe's shrug completed\nhis remark. Then, still disregarding another imploring look from Lady\nTranmore, he left the room.\n\nKitty had flushed angrily. The belittling, malicious note in Ashe's\nmanner had been clear enough. She braced herself against it, and Lady\nTranmore's chance was lost. For when, summoning all her courage, and\nquite uncertain whether her son would approve or blame her, Elizabeth\napproached her daughter-in-law affectionately, trying in timid and\napologetic words to unburden her own heart and reach Kitty's, Kitty met\nher with one of those outbursts of temper that women like Elizabeth\nTranmore cannot cope with. Their moral recoil is too great. It is the\nrecoil of the spiritual aristocrat; and between them and the children of\npassion the links are few, the antagonism eternal.\n\nShe left the house, pale, dignified, the tears in her eyes. Kitty ran\nup-stairs, humming an air from \"Faust,\" as though she would tear it to\npieces, put on a flame-colored hat that gave a still further note of\nextravagance to her costume, ordered a hansom, and drove away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhether Kitty got much joy out of the three weeks which followed must\nremain uncertain. She had certainly routed Mary Lyster, if there were\nany final satisfaction in that. Mary had left town early, and was now in\nSomersetshire helping her father to entertain, in order, said the\nmalicious, to put the best face possible on a defeat which this time had\nbeen serious. And instead of devoting himself to the wooing of a\nnorthern constituency where he had been adopted as the candidate of a\nnew Tory group, Cliffe lingered obstinately in town, endangering his\nchances and angering his supporters. Kitty's influence over his actions\nwas, indeed, patent and undenied, whatever might be the general opinion\nas to her effect upon his heart. Some of Kitty's intimates at any rate\nwere convinced that his absorption in the matter was by now, to say the\nleast, no less eager and persistent than hers. At this point it was by\nno means still a relation of flattery on Kitty's side and a pleased\nself-love on his. It had become a duel of two personalities, or rather\ntwo imaginations. In fact, as Kitty, learning the ways of his character,\nbecame more proudly mistress of herself and him, his interest in her\nvisibly increased. It might almost be said that she was beginning to\nhold back, and he for the first time pursued.\n\nOnce or twice he had the grace to ask himself where it was all to end.\nWas he in love with her? An absurd question! He had paid his heavy\ntribute to passion if any man ever had, and had already hung up his\nvotive tablet and his garments wet from shipwreck in the temple of the\ngod. But it seemed that, after all said and done, the society of a\nwoman, young, beautiful, and capricious, was still the best thing which\nthe day--the London day, at all events--had to bring. At Kitty's\nsuggestion he was collecting and revising a new volume of his poems. He\nand she quarrelled over them perpetually. Sometimes there was not a line\nwhich pleased her; and then, again, she would delight him with the\nhomage of sudden tears in her brown eyes, and a praise so ardent and so\nrefined that it almost compared--as Kitty meant it should--with that of\nthe dead. In the shaded drawing-room, where every detail pleased his\ntaste, Cliffe's harsh voice thundered or murmured verse which was\nbeyond dispute the verse of a poet, and thereby sensuous and\npassionate. Ostensibly the verse concerned another woman; in truth, the\nslight and lovely figure sitting on the farther side of the flowered\nhearth, the delicate head bent, the finger-tips lightly joined, entered\nday by day more directly into the consciousness of the poet. What harm?\nAll he asked was intelligence and response. As to her heart, he made no\nclaim upon it whatever. Ashe, by-the-way, was clearly not jealous--a\nsensible attitude, considering Lady Kitty's strength of will.\n\nInto Cliffe's feeling towards Ashe there entered, indeed, a number of\nevil things, determined by quite other relations between the two\nmen--the relation of the man who wants to the man who has, of the man\nbeaten by the restlessness of ambition to the man who possesses all that\nthe other desires, and affects to care nothing about it--of the\ncombatant who fights with rage to the combatant who fights with a smile.\nCliffe could often lash himself into fury by the mere thought of Ashe's\nopportunities and Ashe's future, combined with the belief that Ashe's\nmood towards himself was either contemptuous or condescending. And it\nwas at such moments that he would fling himself with most resource into\nthe establishing of his ascendency over Kitty.\n\nThe two men met when they did meet--which was but seldom--on perfectly\ncivil terms. If Ashe arrived unexpectedly from the House in the late\nafternoon to find Cliffe in the drawing-room reading aloud to Kitty, the\npolitics of the moment provided talk enough till Cliffe could decently\ntake his departure. He never dined with them alone, Kitty having no mind\nwhatever for the discomforts of such a party; and in the evenings when\nhe and Kitty met at a small number of houses, where the flirtation was\nwatched nightly with a growing excitement, Ashe's duties kept him at\nWestminster, and there was nothing to hinder that flow of small and yet\nsignificant incident by which situations of this kind are developed.\n\nAshe set his teeth. He had made up his mind finally that it was a plague\nand a tyranny which would pass, and could only be magnified by\nopposition. But his temper suffered. There were many small quarrels\nduring these weeks between himself and Kitty, quarrels which betrayed\nthe tension produced in him by what was--in essentials--an iron\nself-control. But they made daily life a sordid, unlovely thing, and\nthey gave Kitty an excuse for saying that William was as violent as\nherself, and for seeking refuge in the exaltations of feeling or of\nfancy provided by Cliffe's companionship.\n\nPerhaps of all the persons in the drama, Lady Tranmore was the most to\nbe pitied. She sat at home, having no heart to go to Hill Street, and\nmore tied indeed than usual by the helpless illness of her husband.\nNever, in all these days, did Ashe miss his daily visit to his father.\nHe would come in, apparently his handsome, good-humored self, ready to\nread aloud for twenty minutes, or merely to sit in silence by the sick\nman, his eyes making affectionate answer every now and then to the dumb\nlooks of Lord Tranmore. Only his mother sought and found that slight\nhabitual contraction of the brow which bore witness to some equally\npersistent disquiet of the mind. But he kept her at arm's-length on the\nsubject of Kitty. She dared not tell him any of the gossip which\nreached her.\n\nMeanwhile these weeks meant for her not only the dread of disgrace, but\nthe disappointment of a just ambition, the humiliation of her mother's\npride. The political crisis approached rapidly, and Ashe's name was less\nand less to the front. Lady Parham was said to be taking an active part\nin the consultations and intrigues that surrounded her husband, and it\nwas well known by now to the inner circle that her hostility to the\nAshes, and her insistence on the fact that cabinet ministers must be\nbeyond reproach, and their wives persons to whose houses the party can\ngo without demeaning themselves, were likely to be of importance.\nMoreover, Ashe's success in the House of Commons was no longer what it\nhad been earlier in the session. The party papers had cooled. Elizabeth\nTranmore felt a blight in the air. Yet William, with his position in the\ncountry, his high ability, and the social weight belonging to the heir\nof the Tranmore peerage and estates, was surely not a person to be\nlightly ignored! Would Lord Parham venture it?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last the resignations of the two ministers were in the _Times_; there\nwere communications between the Queen and the Premier, and London\nplunged with such ardor as is possible in late July into the throes of\ncabinet-making. Kitty insisted petulantly that of course all would be\nwell; William's services were far too great to be ignored; though Lord\nParham would no doubt slight him if he dared. But the party and the\npublic would see to that. The days were gone by when vulgar old women\nlike Lady Parham could have any real influence on political\nappointments. Otherwise, who would condescend to politics?\n\nAshe brought her amusing reports from the House or the clubs of the\nvarious intrigues going on, and, as to his own chances, refused to\ndiscuss them seriously. Once or twice when Kitty, in his presence,\ninsisted on speaking of them to some political intimate, only to provoke\nan evident embarrassment, Ashe suffered the tortures which proud men\nknow. But he never lost his tone of light detachment, and the conclusion\nof his friends was that, as usual, \"Ashe didn't care a button.\"\n\nThe hours passed, however, and no sign came from the Prime Minister.\nEverything was still uncertain; but Ashe had realized that at least he\nwas not to be taken into the inner counsels of the party. The hopes and\nfears, the heartburnings and rivalries of such a state of things are\nproverbial. Ashe wondered impatiently when the beastly business would be\nover, and he could get off to Scotland for the air and sport of which he\nwas badly in need.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a Friday, in the first week of August. Ashe was leaving the\nAthen\u00c3\u00a6um with another member of the House when a newspaper boy rushing\nalong with a fresh bundle of papers passed them with the cry, \"New\ncabinet complete! Official list!\" They caught him up, snatched a paper,\nand read. Two men of middle age, conspicuous in Parliament, but not\nhitherto in office, one of them of great importance as a lawyer, the\nother as a military critic, were appointed, the one to the Home Office,\nthe other to the Ministry of War; there had been some shuffling in the\nminor offices, and a new Privy Seal had dawned upon the world. For the\nrest, all was as before, and in the formal list the name of the\nHonorable William Travers Ashe still remained attached to the\nUnder-Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs.\n\nAshe's friend shrugged his shoulders, and avoided looking at his\ncompanion. \"A bomb-shell, to begin with,\" he said; \"otherwise the\nflattest thing out.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" laughed Ashe. \"Parham has shown a wonderful amount of\noriginality. If you and I are taken by surprise, what will the public\nbe? And they'll like him all the better--you'll see. He has shown\ncourage and gone for new men--that's what they'll say. _Vive_ Parham!\nWell, good-bye. Now, please the Lord, we shall get off--and I may be\namong the grouse this day week.\"\n\nHe stopped on his way out of the club to discuss the list with the men\ncoming in. He was conscious that some would have avoided him. But he had\nno mind to be avoided, and his caustic, good-humored talk carried off\nthe situation. Presently he was walking homeward, swinging his stick\nwith the gayety of a school-boy expecting the holidays.\n\nAs he mounted St. James's Street a carriage descended. Ashe mechanically\ntook off his hat to the half-recognized face within, and as he did so\nperceived the icy bow and triumphant eyes of Lady Parham.\n\nHe hurried along, fighting a curious sensation, as of a physical\nbruising and beating. The streets were full of the news, and he was\nstopped many times by mere acquaintances to talk of it. In Savile Row he\nturned into a small literary club of which he was a member, and wrote a\nletter to his mother. In very affectionate and amusing terms it begged\nher not to take the disappointment too seriously. \"I think I won't come\nround to-night. But expect me first thing to-morrow.\"\n\nHe sent the note by messenger and walked home. When he reached Hill\nStreet it was close on eight. Outside the house he suddenly asked\nhimself what line he was going to take with Kitty.\n\nKitty, however, was not at home. As far as he could remember she had\ngone coaching with the Alcots into Surrey, Geoffrey Cliffe, of course,\nbeing of the party. Presently, indeed, he discovered a hasty line from\nher on his study table, to say that they were to dine at Richmond, and\n\"Madeleine\" supposed they would get home between ten and eleven. Not a\nword more. Like all strong men, Ashe despised the meditations of\nself-pity. But the involuntary reflection that on this evening of\nhumiliation Kitty was not with him--did not apparently care enough about\nhis affairs and his ambitions to be with him--brought with it a soreness\nwhich had to be endured.\n\nThe next moment, he was inclined to be glad of her absence. Such things,\nespecially in the first shock of them, are best faced alone. If, indeed,\nthere were any shock in the matter. He had for some time had his own\nshrewd previsions, and he was aware of a strong inner belief that his\ndefeat was but temporary.\n\nProbably, when she had time to remember such trifles, Kitty would feel\nthe shock more than he did. Lady Parham had certainly won this round of\nthe rubber!\n\nHe settled to his solitary dinner, but in the middle of it put down\nKitty's Aberdeen terrier, which, for want of other company, he was\nstuffing atrociously, and ran up to the nursery. The nurse was at her\nsupper, and Harry lay fast asleep, a pretty little fellow, flushed into\na semblance of health, and with a strong look of Kitty.\n\nAshe bent down and put his whiskered cheek to the boy's. \"Never mind,\nold man!\" he murmured, \"better luck next time!\"\n\nThen raising himself with a smile, he looked affectionately at the\nchild, noticed with satisfaction his bright color and even breathing,\nand stole away.\n\nHe ran through the comments of the evening papers on the new cabinet\nlist, finding in only two or three any reference to himself, then threw\nthem aside, and seized upon a pile of books and reviews that were lying\non his table. He carried them up to the drawing-room, hesitated between\na theological review and a new edition of Horace, and finally plunged\nwith avidity into the theological review.\n\nFor some two hours he sat enthralled by an able summary of the chief\nT\u00c3\u00bcbingen positions; then suddenly threw himself back with a stretch and\na laugh.\n\n\"Wonder what the chap's doing that's got my post! Not reading theology,\nI'll be bound.\"\n\nThe reflection followed that were he at that moment Home Secretary and\nin the cabinet, he would not probably be reading it either--nor left to\na solitary evening. Friends would be dropping in to congratulate--the\nmodern equivalent of the old \"turba clientium.\"\n\nAs his thoughts wandered, the drawing-room clock struck eleven. He rose,\nastonished and impatient. Where was Kitty?\n\nBy midnight she had not arrived. Ashe heard the butler moving in the\nhall and summoned him.\n\n\"There may have been some mishap to the coach, Wilson. Perhaps they have\nstayed at Richmond. Anyway, go to bed. I'll wait for her ladyship.\"\n\nHe returned to his arm-chair and his books, but soon drew Kitty's\n_couvre-pied_ over him and went to sleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, daylight was in the room. \"What has happened to them?\" he\nasked himself, in a sudden anxiety.\n\nAnd amid the silence of the dawn he paced up and down, a prey for the\nfirst time to black depression. He was besieged by memories of the last\ntwo months, their anxieties and quarrels--the waste of time and\nopportunity--the stabs to feeling and self-respect. Once he found\nhimself groaning aloud, \"Kitty! Kitty!\"\n\nWhen this huge, distracting London was left behind, when he had her to\nhimself amid the Scotch heather and birch, should he find her\nagain--conquer her again--as in the exquisite days after their marriage?\nHe thought of Cliffe with a kind of proud torment, disdaining to be\njealous or afraid. Kitty had amused herself--had tested her freedom, his\npatience, to the utmost. Might she now be content, and reward him a\nlittle for a self-control, a philosophy, which had not been easy!\n\nA French novel on Kitty's little table drew his attention. He thought\nnot without a discomfortable humor of what a French husband would have\nmade of a similar situation--recalling the remark of a French\nacquaintance on some case illustrating the freedom of English wives. \"Il\ny a un \u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9ment turc dans le mari fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, qui nous rendrait ces\nmoeurs-l\u00c3\u00a0 impossibles!\"\n\n_\u00c3\u0080 la bonne heure_! Let the Frenchman keep up his seraglio\nstandards as he pleased. An Englishman trusts both his wife and his\ndaughter--scorns, indeed, to consider whether he trusts them or no! And\nwho comes worst off? Not the Englishman--if, at least, we are to believe\nthe French novel on the French _m\u00c3\u00a9nage!_\n\nHe paced thus up and down for an hour, defying his unseen critics--his\nmother--his own heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he went to bed and slept a little. But with the post next morning\nthere was no letter from Kitty. There might be a hundred explanations of\nthat. Yet he felt a sudden need of caution.\n\n\"Her ladyship comes up this morning by train,\" he said to Wilson, as\nthough reading from a note. \"There seems to have been a mishap.\"\n\nThen he took a hansom and drove to the Alcots.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Alcot at home?\" he asked the butler. \"Can I have an answer to\nthis note?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Alcot has been in her room since yesterday morning, sir. She was\ntaken ill just before the coach was coming round, and the horses had to\nbe sent back. But the doctor last night hoped it would be nothing\nserious.\"\n\nAshe turned and went home. Then Kitty was not with Madeleine Alcot--not\non the coach! Where was she, and with whom?\n\nHe shut himself into his library and fell to wondering, in bewilderment,\nwhat he had better do. A tide of rage and agony was mounting within him.\nHow to master it--and keep his brain clear!\n\nHe was sitting in front of his writing-table staring at the floor, his\nhands hanging before him, when the door opened and shut. He turned.\nThere, with her back to the door, stood Kitty. Her aspect startled him\nto his feet. She looked at him, trembling--her little face haggard and\nwhite, with a touch of something in it which had blurred its youth.\n\n\"William!\" She put both her hands to her breast, as though to support\nherself. Then she flew forward. \"William! I have done nothing\nwrong--nothing--nothing! William--look at me!\"\n\nHe sternly put out his hand, protecting himself.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" he said, in a low voice--\"and with whom?\"\n\nKitty fell into a chair and burst into wild tears.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThere was silence for a few moments except for Kitty's crying. Ashe\nstill stood beside his writing-table, his hand resting upon it, his eyes\non Kitty. Once or twice he began to speak, and stopped. At last he said,\nwith obvious difficulty:\n\n\"It's cruel to keep me waiting, Kitty.\"\n\n\"I sent you a telegram first thing this morning.\" The voice was choked\nand passionate.\n\n\"I never got it.\"\n\n\"Horrid little fiend!\" cried Kitty, sitting up and dashing back her hair\nfrom her tear-stained cheeks. \"I gave a boy half a crown this morning to\nbe at the station with it by eight o'clock. And I couldn't possibly\neither write or telegraph last night--it was too late.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\" said Ashe, slowly. \"I went to the Alcots' this\nmorning, and--\"\n\n\"--the butler told you Madeleine was in bed? So she is. She was ill\nyesterday morning. There was no coach and no party. I went with\nGeoffrey.\"\n\nKitty held herself erect; her eyes, from which the tears were\ninvoluntarily dropping, were fixed on her husband.\n\n\"Of course I guessed that,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"It was Geoffrey brought me the news--here, just as I was starting to go\nto the Alcots'. Then he said he had something to read me--and it would\nbe delicious to go to Pangbourne--spend the day on the river--and come\nback from Windsor--at night--by train. And I had a horrid headache--and\nit was so hot--and you were at the office\"--her lip quivered--\"and I\nwanted to hear Geoffrey's poems--and so--\"\n\nShe interrupted herself, and once more broke down--hiding her face\nagainst the chair. But the next moment she felt herself roughly drawn\nforward, as Ashe knelt beside her.\n\n\"Kitty!--look at me! That man behaved to you like a villain?\"\n\nShe looked up--she saw the handsome, good-humored face transformed--and\nwrenched herself away.\n\n\"He did,\" she said, bitterly--\"like a villain.\" She began to twist and\ntorment her handkerchief as Ashe had seen her do once before, the small\nwhite teeth pressed upon the lower lip--then suddenly she turned upon\nhim--\n\n\"I suppose you want me to tell you the story?\"\n\nAll Kitty in the words! Her frankness, her daring, and the impatient,\nrealistic tone she was apt to impose upon emotion--they were all there.\n\nAshe rose and began to walk up and down.\n\n\"Tell me your part in it,\" he said, at last--\"and as little of that\nfellow as may be.\"\n\nKitty was silent. Ashe, looking at her, saw a curious shade of reverie,\na kind of dreamy excitement steal over her face.\n\n\"Go on, Kitty!\" he said, sharply. Then, restraining himself, he added,\nwith all his natural courtesy--\"I beg your pardon, Kitty, but the sooner\nwe get through with this the better.\"\n\nThe mist in which her expression had been for a moment wrapped fell\naway. She flushed deeply.\n\n\"I told you I had done nothing vile!\" she said, passionately. \"Did you\nbelieve me?\"\n\nTheir eyes met in a shock of challenge and reply.\n\n\"Those things are not to be asked between you and me,\" he said, with\nvehemence, and he held out his hand. She just touched it--proudly. Then\nshe drew a long breath.\n\n\"The day was--just like other days. He read me his poems--in a cool\nplace we found under the bank. I thought he was rather absurd now and\nthen--and different from what he had been. He talked of our going\naway--and his not seeing me--and how lonely he was. And of course I was\nawfully sorry for him. But it was all right till--\"\n\nShe paused and looked at Ashe.\n\n\"You remember the inn near Hamel Weir--a few miles from Windsor--that\nlonely little place.\"\n\nAshe nodded.\n\n\"We dined there. Afterwards we were to row to Windsor and come home by a\ntrain about ten. We finished dinner early. By-the-way, there were two\nother people there--Lady Edith Manley and her boy. They had rowed down\nfrom somewhere--\"\n\n\"Did Lady Edith--\"\n\n\"Yes--she spoke to me. She was going back to town--to the Holland House\nparty--\"\n\n\"Where she probably met mother?\"\n\n\"She did meet her!\" cried Kitty. She pointed to a letter which she had\nthrown down as she entered. \"Your mother sent round this note to me this\nmorning--to ask when I should be at home. And Wilson sent word--There!\nOf course I know she thinks I'm capable of anything.\"\n\nShe looked at him, defiant, but very miserable and pale.\n\n\"Go on, please,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"We finished dinner early. There was a field behind the inn, and then a\nwood. We strolled into the wood, and then Geoffrey--well, he went mad!\nHe--\"\n\nShe bit her lip fiercely, struggling for composure--and words.\n\n\"He proposed to you to throw me over?\" said Ashe, as white as she.\n\nWith a sudden gesture she held out her arms--like a piteous child.\n\n\"Oh! don't stand there--and look at me like that--I can't bear it.\"\n\nAshe came--unwillingly. She perceived the reluctance, and with a flaming\nface she motioned him back, while she controlled herself enough to pour\nout her story. Presently Ashe was able to reconstruct with tolerable\nclearness what had occurred. Cliffe, intoxicated by the long day of\nintimacy and of solitude, by Kitty's beauty and Kitty's folly, aware\nthat parting was near at hand, and trusting to the wildness of Kitty's\ntemperament, had suddenly assumed the language of the lover--and a lover\nby no means uncertain of his ultimate answer. So long as they understood\neach other--that, indeed, for the present, was all he asked. But she\nmust know that she had broken off his marriage with Mary Lyster, and\nreopened in his nature all the old founts of passion and of storm. It\nhad been her sovereign will that he should love her; it had been\nachieved. For her sake--knowing himself for the seared and criminal\nbeing that he was--for Ashe's sake--he had tried to resist her spell. In\nvain. A fatal fusion of their two natures--imaginations--sympathies--had\ncome about. Each was interpenetrated by the other; and retreat was\nimpossible.\n\nA kind of sombre power, indeed--the power of the poet and the\ndreamer--seemed to have spoken from Cliffe's strange wooing. He had\ntaken no particular pains to flatter her, or to conceal his original\nhesitation. He put her own action in a hard, almost a brutal light. It\nwas plain that he thought she had treated her husband badly; that he\nwarned her of a future of treachery and remorse. At the same time he let\nher see that he could not doubt but that she would face it. They still\nhad the last justifying cards in their hands--passion, and the courage\nto go where passion leads. When those were played, they might look each\nother and the world in the face. Till then they were but triflers--mean\nsouls--fit neither for heaven nor for hell.\n\nAshe's whole being was soon in a tumult of rage under the sting of this\nreport, as he was able to piece it out from Kitty. But he kept his\nself-command, and by dint of it he presently arrived at some notion of\nher own share in the scene. Horror, recoil, disavowal--a wild resentment\nof the charges heaped upon her, of the pitiless interpretation of her\nbehavior which broke from those harsh lips, of the incredulity passing\ninto something like contempt with which Cliffe had endured her wrath and\nreceived her protestations--then a blind flight through the fields to\nthe little wayside station, where she hoped to catch the last train;\nthe arrival and departure of the train while she was still half a mile\nfrom the line, and her shelter at a cottage for the night; these things\nstood out plainly, whatever else remained in obscurity. How far she had\nprovoked her own fate, and how far even now she was delivered from the\nmorbid spell of Cliffe's personality, Ashe would not allow himself to\nask. As she neared the end of her story, it was as though the great\ntempest wave in which she had been struggling died down, and with a\nmerciful rush bore him to a shore of deliverance. She was there beside\nhim; and she was still his own.\n\nHe had been leaning over the side of a chair, his chin on his hand, his\neyes fixed upon her, while she told her tale. It ended in a burst of\nself-pity, as she remembered her collapse in the cottage, the\nimpossibility of finding any carriage in the small hamlet of which it\nmade part, the faint weariness of the night--\n\n\"I never slept,\" she said, piteously. \"I got up at eight for the first\ntrain, and now I feel\"--she fell back in her chair, and whispered\ndesolately with shut eyes--\"as if I should like to die!\"\n\nAshe knelt down beside her.\n\n\"It's my fault, too, Kitty. I ought to have held you with a stronger\nhand. I hated quarrelling with you. But--oh, my dear, my dear--\"\n\nShe met the cry in silence, the tears running over her cheeks. Roughly,\nimpetuously, he gathered her in his arms and kissed her, as though he\nwould once more re-knit and reconsecrate the bond between them. She lay\npassively against him, the tangle of her fair hair spread over his\nshoulder--too frail and too exhausted for response.\n\n\"This won't do,\" he said, presently, disengaging himself; \"you must have\nsome food and rest. Then we'll think what shall be done.\"\n\nShe roused herself suddenly as he went to the door.\n\n\"Why aren't you at the Foreign Office?\"\n\n\"I sent a message early. Lawson came\"--Lawson was his private\nsecretary--\"but I must go down in an hour.\"\n\n\"William!\"\n\nKitty had raised herself, and her eyes shone large and startled in the\nsmall, tear-stained face.\n\n\"Yes.\" He paused a moment.\n\n\"William, is the list out?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nKitty tottered to her feet.\n\n\"Is it all right?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he said, slowly. \"It doesn't affect me.\"\n\nAnd then, without waiting, he went into the hall and closed the door\nbehind him. He wrote a note to the Foreign Office to say that he should\nnot be at the office till the afternoon, and that important papers were\nto be sent up to him. Then he told Wilson to bring wine and sandwiches\ninto the library for Lady Kitty, who had been detained by an accident on\nthe river the night before, and was much exhausted. No visitors were to\nbe admitted, except, of course, Lady Tranmore or Miss French.\n\nWhen he returned to the library he found Kitty with crimson cheeks, her\nhands locked behind her, walking up and down. As soon as she saw him she\nmotioned to him imperiously.\n\n[Illustration: \"HE GATHERED HER IN HIS ARMS\"]\n\n\"Shut the door, William. I have something very important to say to you.\"\n\nHe obeyed her, and she walked up to him deliberately. He saw the\nfluttering of her heart beneath her white dress--the crushed, bedraggled\ndress, which still in its soft elegance, its small originalities, spoke\nKitty from head to foot. But her manner was quite calm and collected.\n\n\"William, we must separate! You must send me away.\"\n\nHe started.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What I say. It is--it is intolerable--that I should ruin your life like\nthis.\"\n\n\"Don't, please, exaggerate, Kitty! There is no question of ruin. I shall\nmake my way when the time comes, and Lady Parham will have nothing to\nsay to it!\"\n\n\"No! Nothing will ever go well--while I'm there--like a millstone round\nyour neck. William\"--she came closer to him--\"take my advice--do it! I\nWarned you when you married me. And now you see--it was true.\"\n\n\"You foolish child,\" he answered, slowly, \"do you think I could forget\nyou for an hour, wherever you were?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, steadily, \"I know you would forget me--- if I wasn't\nhere. I'm sure of it. You're very ambitious, William--more than you\nknow. You'll soon care--\"\n\n\"More for politics than for you? Another of your delusions, Kitty.\nNothing of the sort. Moreover, if you will only let me advise you--trust\nyour husband a little--think both for him and yourself. I see nothing\neither in politics or in our life together that cannot be retrieved.\"\n\nHe spoke with manly kindness and reasonableness. Not a trace of his\nhabitual indolence or indifference. Kitty, listening, was conscious of\nthe most tempestuous medley of feelings--love, remorse, shame, and a\nstrange gnawing desolation. What else, what better _could_ she have\nasked of him? And yet, as she looked at him, she thought suddenly of the\nmoonlit garden at Grosville Park, and of that young, headlong chivalry\nwith which he had thrown himself at her feet. This man before her, so\nmuch older and maturer, counting the cost of his marriage with her in\nthe light of experience, and magnanimously, resolutely paying it--Kitty,\nin a flash, realized his personality as she had never yet done, his\nmoral independence of her, his separateness as a human being. Her\npassionate self-love instinctively, unconsciously, had made of his life\nthe appendage of hers. And now--? His devotion had never been so plain,\nso attested; and all the while bitter, terrifying voices rang upon the\ninner ear, voices of fate, vague and irrevocable.\n\nShe dropped into a chair beside his table, trembling and white.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said, drawing her handkerchief across her eyes, with a\ngesture of childish misery, \"it's all been a--a horrid mistake. Your\nmother was quite right. Of course she hated your marrying me--and\nnow--now she'll see what I've done. I guess perfectly what she's\nthinking about me to-day! And I can't help it--I shall go on--if you let\nme stay with you. There's a twist--a black drop in me. I'm not like\nother people.\"\n\nHer voice, which was very quiet, gave Ashe intolerable pain.\n\n\"You poor, tired, starved child,\" he said, kneeling down beside her.\n\"Put your arms round my neck. Let me carry you up-stairs.\"\n\nWith a sob she did as she was told. Ashe's library a comparatively late\naddition to the rambling, old-fashioned house, communicated by a small\nstaircase at the back with his dressing-room above. He lifted the small\nfigure with ease, and half-way up-stairs he impetuously kissed the\ndelicate cheek.\n\n\"I'm glad you're not Polly Lyster, darling!\"\n\nKitty laughed through her tears. Presently he deposited her on the large\nsofa in her own room, and stood beside her, panting a little.\n\n\"It's all very well,\" said Kitty, as she nestled down among the pillows,\n\"but we're _none_ of us feathers!\"\n\nHer eyes were beginning to recover a little of their sparkle. She looked\nat him with attention.\n\n\"You look horribly tired. What--what did you do--last night?\" She turned\naway from him.\n\n\"I sat up reading--then went to sleep down-stairs. I thought the coach\nhad come to grief, and you were somewhere with the Alcots.\"\n\n\"If I had known that,\" she murmured, \"_I_ might have gone to sleep. Oh,\nit was so horrible--the little stuffy room, and the dirty blankets.\" She\ngave a shiver of disgust. \"There was a poor baby, too, with\nwhooping-cough. Lucky I had some money. I gave the woman a sovereign.\nBut she wasn't at all nice--she never smiled once. I know she thought I\nwas a bad lot.\"\n\nThen she sprang up.\n\n\"Sit there!\" She pointed to the foot of the sofa. Ashe obeyed her.\n\n\"When did you know?\"\n\n\"About the ministry? Between six and seven. I saw Lady Parham afterwards\ndriving in St. James's Street. She never enjoyed anything so much in her\nlife as the bow she gave me.'\"\n\nKitty groaned, and subsided again, a little crumpled form among her\ncushions.\n\n\"Tell me the names.\"\n\nAshe gave her the list of the ministry. She made one or two shrewd or\nbitter comments upon it. He fully understood that in her inmost mind she\nwas registering a vow of vengeance against the Parhams; but she made no\nspoken threat. Meanwhile, in the background of each mind there lay that\ndarker and more humiliating fact, to which both shrank from returning,\nwhile yet both knew that it must be faced.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and Blanche appeared with the tray which\nhad been ordered down-stairs. She glanced in astonishment at her\nmistress.\n\n\"We had an accident on the river last night, Blanche,\" said Kitty. \"Come\nback in half an hour. I'm too tired to change just yet.\"\n\nShe kept her face hidden from the maid, but when Blanche had departed,\nAshe saw that her cheeks were flaming.\n\n\"I hate lying!\" she said, with a kind of physical disgust--\"and now I\nsuppose it will be my chief occupation for weeks.\"\n\nIt was true that she hated lying, and Ashe was well aware of it. Of such\na battle-stroke, indeed, as she had played at the ball, when her prompt\nfalsehood snatched Cliffe from Mary Lyster, she was always capable. But\nin general her pride, her very egotism and quick temper kept her true.\n\nPerhaps the fact represented one of those deep sources whence the well\nof Ashe's tenderness was fed. At any rate, consciously or not, it was at\nthis moment one of his chief motives for not finding the past\nintolerable or the future without hope. He took some wine and a sandwich\nfrom the tray, and began to feed her. In the middle, she pushed his\nhands away, and her eyes brimmed again with tears.\n\n\"Put it down,\" she commanded. And when he had done so, she raised his\nhands deliberately, one after the other, and kissed them, crying:\n\n\"William!--I have been a horrible wife to you!\"\n\n\"Don't be a goose, Kitty. You know very well that--till this last\nbusiness--And don't imagine that I feel myself a model, either!\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, with a long sigh. \"Of course, you ought to have beaten\nme.\"\n\nHe smiled, with an unsteady lip.\n\n\"Perhaps I might still try it.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Too late. I am not a child any more.\"\n\nThen throwing her soft arms round his neck, she clung to him, saying the\nmost adorable and poignant things, dissolved, indeed, in a murmuring\nanguish of remorse; until, with the same unexpectedness as before, she\nagain disengaged herself--urging, insisting that he should send her\naway.\n\n\"Let me go and live at Haggart, baby and I.\" (Haggart was one of the\nTranmore \"places,\" recently handed over to the young people.) \"You can\ncome and see me sometimes. I'll garden--and write books. Half the smart\nwomen I know write stories--or plays. Why shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed? Meanwhile, madam, I take you to Scotland--next week.\"\n\n\"Scotland?\" She pressed her hands over her eyes.\n\"'Anywhere--anywhere--out of the world!'\"\n\n\"Kitty!\" Startled by the abandonment of her words, Ashe caught her hands\nand held them. \"Kitty!--- you regret--\"\n\n\"That man? Do I?\" She opened her eyes, frowning. \"I loathe him! When I\nthink of yesterday, I could drown myself. If I could pile the whole\nworld between him and me--I would. But\"--she shivered--\"but yet--if he\nwere sitting there--\"\n\n\"You would be once more under the spell?\" said Ashe, bitterly.\n\n\"Spell!\" she repeated, with scorn. Then snatching her hands from his,\nshe threw back the hair from her temples with a wild gesture. \"I warned\nyou,\" she said--\"I warned you.\"\n\n\"A man doesn't pay much attention to those warnings, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Then it is not my fault. I don't know what's wrong with me,\" she said,\nsombrely; \"but I remember saying to you that sometimes my brain was on\nfire. I seem to be always in a hurry--in a desperate, desperate\nhurry!--to know or to feel something--while there is still time--before\none dies. There is always a passion--always an effort. More life--_more\nlife_!--even if it lead to pain--and agony--and tears.\"\n\nShe raised her strange, beautiful eyes, which had at the moment almost a\nlook of delirium, and fixed them on his face. But Ashe's impression was\nthat she did not see him.\n\nHe was conscious of the same pang, the same sudden terror that he had\nfelt on that never-to-be-forgotten evening when she had talked to him of\nthe mask in the \"Tempest.\" He thought of the Blackwater stories he had\nheard from Lord Grosville. \"_Mad, my dear fellow, mad!_\"--the old man's\nfrequent comment ran through his memory. Was there, indeed, some unsound\nspot in Kitty?\n\nHe sat dumb and paralyzed for a moment; then, recovering himself, he\nsaid, as he recaptured the cold little hands:\n\n\"'More _light_,' Kitty, was what Goethe said, in dying. A better prayer,\ndon't you think?\"\n\nThere was a strong, even a stern insistence in his manner which quieted\nKitty. Her face as it came back to full consciousness was exquisitely\nsweet and mournful.\n\n\"That's the prayer of the _calm_,\" she said, in a whisper, \"and my\nnature is hunger and storm. And Geoffrey Cliffe is the same. That's why\nI couldn't help being--\"\n\nShe sprang up.\n\n\"William, don't let's talk nonsense. I can't ever see that man again.\nHow's it to be done?\"\n\nShe moved up and down--all practical energy and impatience--her mood\nwholly altered. His own adapted itself to hers.\n\n\"For the present, fear nothing,\" he said, dryly. \"For his own sake\nCliffe will hold his tongue and leave London. And as to the future--I\ncan get some message conveyed to him--by a man he won't disregard. Leave\nit to me.\"\n\n\"You can't write to him, William!\" cried Kitty, passionately.\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" he repeated. \"Then suppose you take the boy--and\nMargaret French--to Haggart till I can join you?\"\n\n\"And your mother?\" she said, timidly, coming to stand beside him and\nlaying a hand on each shoulder.\n\n\"Leave that also to me.\"\n\n\"How she'll hate the sight of me,\" she said, under her breath. Then,\nwith another tone of voice--\"How long, William, do you give the\ngovernment?\"\n\n\"Six months, perhaps--perhaps less. I don't see how they can last beyond\nFebruary.\"\n\n\"And then--we'll _fight_!\" said Kitty, with a long breath, smoothing\nback the hair from his brow.\n\n\"Allow me, please, to command the forces! Well, now then, I must be\noff!\" He tried to rise, but she still held him.\n\n\"Did you have any breakfast, William?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Sit still and eat one of my sandwiches.\" She divided one into strips,\nand standing over him began to feed him. A knock at the door arrested\nher.\n\n\"Don't move!\" she said, peremptorily, before she ran to open the door.\n\n\"Please, my lady,\" said Blanche, \"Lady Tranmore would like to see you.\"\n\nKitty started and flushed. She looked round uncertainly at Ashe.\n\n\"Ask her ladyship to come up,\" said Ashe, quietly.\n\nThe maid departed.\n\n\"Feed me if you want to, Kitty,\" said Ashe, still seated.\n\nKitty returned, her breath hurried, her step wavering. She looked\ndoubtfully at Ashe--then her eyes sparkled--as she understood. She\ndropped on her knees beside him, kissing the sleeve of his coat, against\nwhich her cheek was pressed--in a passion of repentance.\n\nHe bent towards her, touching her hair, murmuring over her. His mind\nmeanwhile was torn with feelings which, so to speak, observed each\nother. This thing which had happened was horribly serious--important. It\nmight easily have wrecked two lives. Had he dealt with it as he\nought--made Kitty feel the gravity of it?\n\nThen the optimist in him asked impatiently what was \"the good of\nexaggerating the damned business\"? That fellow has got his lesson--could\nbe driven headlong out of his life and Kitty's henceforward. And how\ncould _he_ doubt the love shown in this clinging penitence, these soft\nkisses? How would the Turk theory of marriage, please, have done any\nbetter? Kitty had had her own wild way. No fiat from without had bound\nher; but love had brought her to his feet. There was something in him\nwhich triumphed alike in her revolt and her submission.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, in the cool drawing-room to which the green _persiennes_ gave\na pleasant foreign look, Lady Tranmore had been waiting for the maid's\nreturn. She shrank from every sound in the house; from her own\nreflection in Kitty's French mirrors; from her own thoughts most of all.\n\nLady Edith Manley--at Holland House--had been the most innocent of\ngossips. A little lady who did no wrong herself--and thought no wrong of\nothers; as white-minded and unsuspicious as a convent child. \"Poor Lady\nKitty! Something seemed to have gone wrong with the Alcots' coach, and\nthey were somehow divided from all their party. I can't remember exactly\nwhat it was they said, but Mr. Cliffe was confident they would catch\ntheir train. Though my boy--you remember my boy? they've just put him in\nthe eight!--thought they were running it _rather_ fine.\"\n\nThen, five minutes later, in the supper-room, Lady Tranmore had run\nacross Madeleine Alcot's husband, who had given her in passing the whole\nstory of the frustrated expedition--Mrs. Alcot's chill, and the despatch\nof Cliffe to Hill Street. \"Horrid bore to have to put it off! Hope he\ngot there in time to stop Lady Kitty getting ready. Oh, thanks,\nMadeleine's all right.\"\n\nAnd then no more, as the rush of the crowd swept them apart.\n\nAfter that, sleep had wholly deserted Lady Tranmore--if, indeed, after\nthe publication of the cabinet list in the afternoon, and William's\nletter following upon it, any had been still possible. And in the early\nmorning she had sent her note to Kitty--a _ballon d'essai_, despatched\nin a horror of great fear.\n\n\"Her ladyship has not yet returned.\" The message from Hill Street,\ndelivered by the footman's indifferent mouth, struck Lady Tranmore with\ntrembling.\n\n\"Where is William?\" she said to herself, in anguish. \"I must find\nhim--but--what shall I say to him?\" Then she went up-stairs, and,\nwithout calling for her maid, put on her walking things with shaking\nhands.\n\nShe slipped out unobserved by her household, and took a hansom from the\ncorner of Grosvenor Street. In the hansom she carefully drew down her\nveil, with the shrinking of one on whom disgrace--the long pursuing,\nlong expected--has seized at last. All the various facts, statements,\nindications as to Kitty's behavior, which through the most diverse\nchannels had been flowing steadily towards her for weeks past, were now\nsurging through her mind and memory--a grievous, damning host. And every\nnow and then, as she caught the placards in the streets, her heart\ncontracted anew. Her son, her William, in what should have been the\nheyday of his gifts and powers, baffled, tripped up, defeated!--by his\nown wife, the selfish, ungrateful, reckless child on whom he had\nlavished the undeserved treasures of the most generous and untiring\nlove. And had she not only checked or ruined his career--was he to be\nalso dishonored, struck to the heart?\n\nShe could scarcely stand as she rang the bell at Hill Street, and it was\nonly with a great effort that she could ask her question:\n\n\"Is Mr. Ashe at home?\"\n\n\"Mr. Ashe, my lady, is, I believe, just going out,\" said Wilson. \"Her\nladyship arrived just about an hour ago, and that detained him.\"\n\nElizabeth betrayed nothing. The training of her class held good.\n\n\"Are they in the library?\" she asked--\"or up-stairs?\"\n\nWilson replied that he believed her ladyship was in her room, and Mr.\nAshe with her.\n\n\"Please ask Mr. Ashe if I can see him for a few minutes.\"\n\nWilson disappeared, and Lady Tranmore stood motionless, looking round at\nWilliam's books and tables. She loved everything that his hand had\ntouched, every sign of his character--the prize books of his college\ndays, the pictures on the wall, many of which had descended from his\nEton study, the photographs of his favorite hunter, the drawing she\nherself had made for him of his first pony.\n\nOn his writing-table lay a despatch-box from the Foreign Office. Lady\nTranmore turned away from it. It reminded her intolerably of the shock\nand defeat of the day before. During the past six months she had become\nmore rejoicingly conscious than ever before of his secret, deepening\nambition, and her own heart burned with the smart of his disappointment.\nNo one else, however, should guess at it through her. No sooner had she\nreceived his letter from the club than, after many weeks of withdrawal\nfrom society, she had forced herself to go to the Holland House party,\nthat no one might say she hid herself, that no one might for an instant\nsuppose that any hostile act of such a man as Lord Parham, or any malice\nof that low-minded woman, could humiliate her son or herself.\n\nSuddenly she saw Kitty's gloves--Kitty's torn and soiled gloves--lying\non the floor. She clasped her trembling hands, trying to steady herself.\nHusband and wife were together. What tragedy was passing between them?\n\nOf course there _might_ have been an accident; her thoughts might be all\nmistake and illusion. But Lady Tranmore hardly allowed herself to\nencourage the alternative of hope. It was like Kitty's audacity to have\ncome back. Incredible!--unfathomable!--like all she did.\n\n\"Her ladyship says, my lady, would you please go up to her room?\"\n\nThe message was given in Blanche's timid voice. Lady Tranmore started,\nlooked at the girl, longed to question her, and had not the courage. She\nfollowed mechanically, and in silence. Could she, must she face it?\nYes--for her son's sake. She prayed inwardly that she might meet the\nordeal before her with Christian strength and courage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door opened. She saw two figures in the pretty, bright-colored room,\nWilliam sat astride upon a chair in front of Kitty, who, like some small\nmother-bird, hovered above him, holding what seemed to be a tiny strip\nof bread-and-butter, which she was dropping with dainty deliberation\ninto his mouth. Her face, in spite of the red and swollen eyes, was\nalive with fun, and Ashe's laugh reflected hers. The domesticity, the\nintimate affection of the scene--before these things Elizabeth Tranmore\nstood gasping.\n\n\"Dearest mother!\" cried Ashe, starting up.\n\nKitty turned. At sight of Lady Tranmore she hung back; her smiles\ndeparted; her lip quivered.\n\n\"William!\"--she pursued him and touched him on the shoulder. \"I--I\ncan't--I'm afraid. If mother ever means to speak to me again--come and\ntell me.\"\n\nAnd, hiding her face, Kitty escaped like a whirlwind. The dressing-room\ndoor closed behind her, and mother and son were left alone.\n\n\"Mother!\" said Ashe, coming up to her gayly, both hands out-stretched.\n\"Ask me nothing, dear. Kitty has been a silly child--but things will go\nbetter now. And as for the Parhams--what does it matter?--come and help\nme send them to the deuce!\"\n\nLady Tranmore recoiled. For once the good-humor of that handsome\nface--pale as the face was--seemed to her an offence--nay, a disgrace.\nThat what had happened had been no mere _contretemps_, no mere accident\nof trains and coaches, was plain enough from Kitty's eyes--from all that\nWilliam did _not_ say, no less than from what he said. And still this\nlevity!--this inconceivable levity! Was it true, as she knew was said,\nthat William had no high sense of honor, that he failed in delicacy and\ndignity?\n\nIn reality, it was the same cry as the Dean's--upon another and smaller\noccasion. But in this case it was unspoken. Lady Tranmore dropped into a\nchair, one hand abandoned to her son, the other hiding her face. He\ntalked fast and tenderly, asking her help--neither of them quite knew\nfor what--her advice as to the move to Haggart--and so forth. Lady\nTranmore said little. But it was a bitter silence; and if Ashe himself\nfailed in indignation, his mother's protesting heart supplied it amply.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\n\n\"Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille, Sich ein Character in dem\nStrom, der Welt.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\n\"What does Lady Kitty do with herself here?\" said Darrell, looking round\nhim. He had just arrived from town on a visit to the Ashes, to find the\nHaggart house and garden completely deserted, save for Mrs. Alcot, who\nwas lounging in solitude, with a cigarette and a novel, on the wide lawn\nwhich surrounded the house on three sides.\n\nAs he spoke he lifted a chair and placed it beside her, under one of the\ncedars which made deep shade upon the grass.\n\n\"She plays at Lady Bountiful,\" said Mrs. Alcot. \"She doesn't do it well,\nbut--\"\n\n\"--The wonder is, in Johnsonian phrase, that she should do it at all.\nAnything else?\"\n\n\"I understand--she is writing a book--a novel.\"\n\nDarrell threw back his head and laughed long and silently.\n\n\"Il ne manquait que cela,\" he said--\"that Lady Kitty should take to\nliterature!\"\n\nMrs. Alcot looked at him rather sharply.\n\n\"Why not? We frivolous people are a good deal cleverer than you think.\"\n\nThe languid arrogance of the lady's manner was not at all unbecoming.\nDarrell made an inclination.\n\n\"No need to remind me, madam!\" A recent exhibition at an artistic club\nof Mrs. Alcot's sketches had made a considerable mark. \"Very soon you\nwill leave us poor professionals no room to live.\"\n\nThe slight disrespect of his smile annoyed his companion, but the day\nwas hot and she had no repartee ready. She only murmured as she threw\naway her cigarette:\n\n\"Kitty is much disappointed in the village.\"\n\n\"They are greater brutes than she thought?\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary. There are no poachers--and no murders. The girls\nprefer to be married, and the Tranmores give so much away that no one\nhas the smallest excuse for starvation. Kitty gets nothing out of them\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"In the way of literary material?\"\n\nMrs. Alcot nodded.\n\n\"Last week she was so discouraged that she was inclined to give up\nfiction and take to journalism.\"\n\n\"Heavens! Political?\"\n\n\"Oh, _la haute politique_, of course.\"\n\n\"H'm. The wives of cabinet ministers have often inspired articles. I\ndon't remember an instance of their writing them.\"\n\n\"Well, Kitty is inclined to try.\"\n\n\"With Ashe's sanction?\"\n\n\"Goodness, no! But Kitty, as you are aware\"--Mrs. Alcot threw a prudent\nglance to right and left--\"goes her own way. She believes she can be of\ngreat service to her husband's policy.\"\n\nDarrell's lip twitched.\n\n\"If you were in Ashe's position, would you rather your wife neglected or\nsupported your political interests?\"\n\nMrs. Alcot shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Kitty made a considerable mess of them last year.\"\n\n\"No doubt. She forgot they existed. But I think if I were Ashe, I should\nbe more afraid of her remembering. By-the-way--the glass here seems to\nbe at 'Set Fair'?\"\n\nHis interrogative smile was not wholly good-natured. But mere\nbenevolence was not what the world asked of Philip Darrell--even in the\ncase of his old friends.\n\n\"Astonishing!\" said Mrs. Alcot, with lifted brows. \"Kitty is immensely\nproud of him--and immensely ambitious. That, of course, accounts for\nLord Parham's visit.\"\n\n\"Lord Parham!\" cried Darrell, bounding on his seat. \"Lord\nParham!--coming here?\"\n\n\"He arrives to-morrow. On his way from Scotland--to Windsor.\"\n\nMrs. Alcot enjoyed the effect of her communication on her companion. He\nsat open-mouthed, evidently startled out of all self-command.\n\n\"Why, I thought that Lady Kitty--\"\n\n\"Had vowed vengeance? So, in a sense, she has. It is understood that she\nand Lady Parham don't meet, except--\"\n\n\"On formal occasions, and to take in the groundlings,\" said Darrell, too\nimpatient to let her finish her sentence. \"Yes, that I gathered. But you\nmean that _Lord_ Parham is to be allowed to make his peace?\"\n\nMadeleine Alcot lay back and laughed.\n\n\"Kitty wishes to try her hand at managing him.\"\n\nDarrell joined her in mirth. The notion of the white-haired,\nbullet-headed, shrewd, and masterful man who at that moment held the\nPremiership of England managed by Kitty, or any other daughter of\nEve--always excepting his wife--must needs strike those who had the\nslightest acquaintance with Lord Parham as a delicious absurdity.\n\nSuddenly Darrell checked himself, and bent forward.\n\n\"Where--if I may ask--is the poet?\"\n\n\"Geoffrey? Somewhere in the Balkans, isn't he?--making a revolution.\"\n\nDarrell nodded.\n\n\"I remember. They say he is with the revolutionary committee at\nMarinitza. Meanwhile there is a new volume of poems out--to-day,\" said\nDarrell, glancing at a newspaper thrown down beside him.\n\n\"I have seen it. The 'portrait' at the end--\"\n\n\"Is Lady Kitty.\" They spoke under their breaths.\n\n\"Unmistakable, I think,\" said Kitty's best friend. \"As poetry, it seems\nto me the best thing in the book, but the audacity of it!\" She raised\nher eyebrows in a half-unwilling, half-contemptuous admiration.\n\n\"Has she seen it?\"\n\nMrs. Alcot replied that she had not noticed any copy in the house, and\nthat Kitty had not spoken of it, which, given the Kitty-nature, she\nprobably would have done, had it reached her.\n\nThen they both fell into reverie, from which Darrell emerged with the\nremark:\n\n\"I gather that last year some very important person interfered?\"\n\nThis opened another line of gossip, in which, however, Mrs. Alcot showed\nherself equally well informed. It was commonly reported, at any rate,\nthat the old Duke of Morecambe, the head of Lady Eleanor Cliffe's\nfamily, the great Tory evangelical of the north, who was a sort of\npatriarch in English political and aristocratic life, had been induced\nby some undefined pressure to speak very plainly to his kinsman on the\nsubject of Lady Kitty Ashe. Cliffe had expectations from the duke which\nwere not to be trifled with. He had, accordingly, swallowed the lecture,\nand, after the loss of his election, had again left England with an\nimportant newspaper commission to watch events in the Balkans.\n\n\"May he stay there!\" said Darrell. \"Of course, the whole thing was\nabsurdly exaggerated.\"\n\n\"Was it?\" said Mrs. Alcot, coolly. \"Kitty richly deserved most of what\nwas said.\" Then--on his start--\"Don't misunderstand me, of course. If\ntwenty actions for divorce were given against Kitty, I should believe\nnothing--_nothing_!\" The words were as emphatic as voice and gesture\ncould make them. \"But as for the tales that people who hate her tell of\nher, and will go on telling of her--\"\n\n\"They are merely the harvest of what she has sown?\"\n\n\"Naturally. Poor Kitty!\"\n\nMadeleine Alcot rested her thin cheek on a still frailer hand and looked\npensively out into the darkness of the cedars. Her tone was neither\npatronizing nor unkind; rather, the shade of ironic tenderness which it\nexpressed suited the subject, and that curious intimacy which had of\nlate sprung up between herself and Darrell. She had begun, as we have\nseen, by treating him _de haut en bas_. He had repaid her with manner of\nthe same type; in this respect he was a match for any Archangel. Then\nsome accident--perhaps the publication by the man of a volume of essays\nwhich expressed to perfection his acid and embittered talent--perhaps a\ncasual meeting at a northern country-house, where the lady had found the\nman of letters her only resource amid a crowd of uncongenial\nnonentities--had shown them their natural compatibility. Both were in a\nsecret revolt against circumstance and their own lives; but whereas the\nreasons for the man's attitude--his jealousies, defeats, and\nambitions--were fairly well understood by the woman, he was almost as\nmuch in the dark about her as when their friendship began.\n\nHe knew her husband slightly--an eager, gifted fellow, of late years a\nstrong High Churchman, and well known in a certain group as the friend\nof Mrs. Armagh, that muse--fragile, austere, and beautiful--of several\ngreat men, and great Christians, among the older generation. Mrs. Alcot\nhad her own intimates, generally men; but she tired of them and changed\nthem often. Mr. Alcot spent part of every year within reach of the\nCornish home of Mrs. Armagh; and during that time his wife made her\nround of visits.\n\nMeanwhile her thin lips were sealed as to her own affairs. Certainly she\nmade the impression of an unhappy woman, and Darrell was convinced of\nsome tragic complication. But neither he nor any one of whom he had yet\ninquired had any idea what it might be.\n\n\"By-the-way--where is Lady Kitty?--and are there many people here?\"\n\nDarrell turned, as he spoke, to scrutinize the house and its approaches.\nHaggart Hall was a large and commonplace mansion, standing in the midst\nof spreading \"grounds\" and dull plantations, beyond which could be\nsometimes seen the tall chimneys of neighboring coal-mines. It wore an\nair of middle-class Tory comfort which brought a smile to Darrell's\ncountenance as he surveyed it.\n\n\"Kitty is at the Agricultural Show--with a party.\"\n\n\"Playing the great lady? _What_ a house!\"\n\n\"Yes. Kitty abhors it. But it will do very well for the party\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Half the county--that kind of thing?\"\n\n\"_All_ the county--some royalties--and Lord Parham.\"\n\n\"Lord Parham being the end and aim? I thought I heard wheels.\"\n\nMrs. Alcot rose, and they strolled back towards the house.\n\n\"And the party?\" resumed Darrell.\n\n\"Not particularly thrilling. Lord Grosville--\"\n\n\"Also, I presume, _en gar\u00c3\u00a7on_.\"\n\nMrs. Alcot smiled.\n\n\"--the Manleys, Lady Tranmore, Miss French, the Dean of Milford and his\nwife, Eddie Helston--\"\n\n\"That, I understand, is Lady Kitty's undergraduate adorer?\"\n\n\"It's no use talking to you--you know all the gossip. And some county\nbig-wigs, whose names I can't remember--come to dinner to-night.\" Mrs.\nAlcot stifled a yawn.\n\n\"I am very curious to see how Ashe takes his triumph,\" said Darrell, as\nthey paused half-way.\n\n\"He is just the same. No!\" said Madeleine Alcot, correcting\nherself--\"no--not quite. He _meant_ to triumph, and he _knows_ that he\nhas done so.\"\n\n\"My dear lady!\" cried Darrell--\"a quite _enormous_ difference! Ashe\nnever took stock of himself or his prospects in his life before.\"\n\n\"Well, now--you will find he takes stock of a good many things.\"\n\n\"Including Lady Kitty?\"\n\nHis companion smiled.\n\n\"He won't let her interfere again.\"\n\n\"_L'homme propose_,\" said Darrell. \"You mean he has grown ambitious?\"\n\nMrs. Alcot seemed to find it difficult to cope with these high things.\nFanning herself, she languidly supposed that the English political\npassion, so strong and unspent still in the aristocratic families, had\nlaid serious hold at last on William Ashe. He had great schemes of\nreform, and, do what he might to conceal it, his heart was in them. His\nwife, therefore, was no longer his occupation, but--\n\nMrs. Alcot hesitated for a word.\n\n\"Scarcely his repose?\" laughed Darrell.\n\n\"I really won't discuss Kitty any more,\" said Mrs. Alcot, impatiently.\n\"Here they are! Hullo! What has Kitty got hold of now?\"\n\nThree carriages were driving up the long approach, one behind the other.\nIn the first sat Kitty, a figure beside her in the dress of a nurse, and\nopposite to them both an indistinguishable bundle, which presently\nrevealed a head. The carriage drew up at the steps. Kitty jumped down,\nand she and the nurse lifted the bundle out. Footmen appeared; some\nguests from the next carriage went to help; there was a general movement\nand agitation, in the midst of which Kitty and her companions\ndisappeared into the house.\n\nLady Edith Manley and Lord Grosville began to cross the lawn.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Mrs. Alcot, as they converged.\n\n\"Kitty ran over a boy,\" said Lord Grosville, in evident annoyance. \"The\nrascal hadn't a scratch, but Kitty must needs pick him up and drive him\nhome with a nurse. 'I ain't hurt, mum,' says the boy. 'Oh! but you must\nbe,' said Kitty. I offered to take him to his mother and give him half a\ncrown. 'It's my duty to look after him,' says Kitty. And she lifted him\nup herself--dirty little vagabond!--and put him in the carriage. There\nwere some laborers and grooms standing near, and one of them sang out,\n'Three cheers for Lady Kitty Ashe!' Such a ridiculous scene as you never\nsaw!\"\n\nThe old man shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.\n\n\"Lady Kitty is always so kind,\" said the amicable Lady Edith. \"But her\npretty dress--I _was_ sorry!\"\n\n\"Oh no--only an excuse for a new one,\" said Mrs. Alcot.\n\nThe Dean and Lady Tranmore approached--behind them again Ashe and Mrs.\nWinston.\n\n\"Well, old fellow!\" said Ashe, clapping a hand on Darrell's shoulder.\n\"Uncommonly glad to see you. You look as though that damned London had\nbeen squeezing the life out of you. Come for a stroll before dinner?\"\n\nThe two men accordingly left the talkers on the lawn, and struck into\nthe park. Ashe, in a straw hat and light suit, made his usual impression\nof strength and good-humor. He was gay, friendly, amusing as ever. But\nDarrell was not long in discovering or imagining signs of change. Any\none else would have thought Ashe's talk frankness--nay,\nindiscretion--itself. Darrell at once divined or imagined in it shades\nof official reserve, tracts of reticence, such as an old friend had a\nright to resent.\n\n\"One can see what a personage he feels himself!\"\n\nYet Darrell would have been the first to own that Ashe had some right to\nfeel himself a personage. The sudden revelation of his full intellectual\npower, and of his influence in the country, for which the general\nelection of the preceding winter had provided the opportunity, was still\nan exciting memory among journalists and politicians. He had gone into\nthe election a man slightly discredited, on whose future nobody took\nmuch trouble to speculate. He had emerged from it--after a series of\nspeeches laying down the principles and vindicating the action of his\nparty--one of the most important men in England, with whom Lord Parham\nhimself must henceforth treat on quasi-equal terms. Ashe was now Home\nSecretary, and, if Lord Parham's gout should take an evil turn, there\nwas no saying to what height fortune might not soon conduct him.\n\nThe will--the iron purpose--with which it had all been done--that was\nthe amazing part of it. The complete independence, moreover. Darrell\nimagined that Lord Parham must often have regretted the small intrigue\nby which Ashe's promotion had been barred in the crisis of the summer.\nIt had roused an indolent man to action, and freed him from any\nparticular obligation towards the leader who had ill-treated him. Ashe's\ncampaign had not been in all respects convenient; but Lord Parham had\nhad to put up with it.\n\nThe summer evening broadened as the two men sauntered on through the\npark, beside a small stream fringed with yellow flags. Even the dingy\nMidland landscape, with its smoke-blackened woods and lifeless grass,\nassumed a glory of great light; the soft, interlacing clouds parted\nbefore the dying sun; the water received the golden flood, and each coot\nand water-hen shone jet and glossy in the blaze. A few cries of birds,\nthe distant shouts of harvesters, the rustling of the water-flags along\nthe stream, these were the only sounds--traditional sounds of English\npeace.\n\n\"Jolly, isn't it?\" said Ashe, looking round him--\"even this spoiled\ncountry! Why did we go and stifle in that beastly show!\"\n\nThe sensuous pleasure and relaxation of his mood communicated itself to\nDarrell. They talked more intimately, more freely than they had done for\nmonths. Darrell's gnawing consciousness of his own meaner fortunes, as\ncontrasted with the brilliant and expanding career of his school-friend,\nsoftened and relaxed. He almost forgave Ashe the successes of the\nwinter, and that subtly heightened tone of authority and self-confidence\nwhich here and there bore witness to them in the manner or talk of the\nminister. They scarcely touched on politics, however. Both were tired,\nand their talk drifted into the characteristic male gossip--\"What's ----\ndoing now?\" \"Do you ever see So-and-so?\" \"You remember that fellow at\nUniv.?\"--and the like, to the agreeable accompaniment of Ashe's best\ncigars.\n\nSo pleasant was the half-hour, so strongly had the old college intimacy\nreasserted itself, that suddenly a thought struck upward in Darrell's\nmind. He had not come to Haggart bent merely on idle holiday--far from\nit. At the moment he was weary of literature as a profession, and\nsharply conscious that the time for vague ambitions had gone by. A post\nhad presented itself, a post of importance, in the gift of the Home\nOffice. It meant, no doubt, the abandonment of more brilliant things;\nDarrell was content to abandon them. His determination to apply for it\nseemed, indeed, to himself an act of modesty--almost of sacrifice. As to\nthe technical qualifications required, he was well aware there might be\nother men better equipped than himself. But, after all, to what may not\ngeneral ability aspire--general ability properly stiffened with\ninterest?\n\nAnd as to interest, when was it ever to serve him if not now--through\nhis old friendship with Ashe? Chivalry towards a much-solicited mortal,\nalso your friend--even the subtler self-love--might have counselled\nsilence--or at least approaches more gradual. It had been far from his\npurpose, indeed, to speak so promptly. But here were the hour and the\nman! And there, in a distant country town, a woman--whereof the mere\nexistence was unsuspected by Darrell's country-house acquaintance--sat\nwaiting, in whose eyes the post in question loomed as a\ncondition--perhaps indispensable. Darrell's secret eagerness could not\nwithstand the temptation.\n\nSo, with a nervous beginning--\"By-the-way, I wished to consult you about\na personal matter. Of course, answer or not, as you like. Naturally, I\nunderstand the difficulties!\"--the plunge was taken, and the petitioner\nsoon in full career.\n\nAfter a first start--a lifted brow of astonishment--Ashe was\nuncomfortably silent--till suddenly, in a pause of Darrell's eloquence,\nhis face changed, and with a burst of his old, careless freedom and\naffection, he flung an arm along Darrell's shoulder, with an impetuous--\n\n\"I say, old fellow--don't--don't be a damned fool!\"\n\nAn ashen white overspread the countenance of the man thus addressed. His\nlips twitched. He walked on in silence. Ashe looked at him--stammered:\n\n\"Why, my dear Philip, it would be the extinguishing of you!\"\n\nDarrell said nothing. Ashe, still holding his friend captive, descanted\nhurriedly on the disadvantages of the post \"for a man of your gifts,\"\nthen--more cautiously--on its special requirements, not one of which did\nDarrell possess--hinted at the men applying for it, at the scientific\nand professional influences then playing upon himself, at his strong\nsense of responsibility--\"Too bad, isn't it, that a duffer like me\nshould have to decide these things\"--and so on.\n\nIn vain. Darrell laughed, recovered himself, changed the subject; but as\nthey walked quickly back to the house, Ashe knew, perchance, that he had\nlost a friend; and Darrell's smarting soul had scored another reckoning\nagainst a day to come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they neared the house they found a large group still lingering on the\nlawn, and Kitty just emerging from a garden door. She came out\naccompanied by the handsome Cambridge lad who had been her partner at\nLady Crashaw's dance. He was evidently absorbed in her society, and they\napproached in high spirits, laughing and teasing each other.\n\n\"Well, Kitty, how's the bruised one?\" said Ashe, as he sank into a chair\nbeside Mrs. Alcot.\n\n\"Doing finely,\" said Kitty. \"I shall send him home to-night.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, have you put him up in my dressing-room? I only ask for\ninformation.\"\n\n\"There wasn't another corner,\" said Kitty.\n\n\"There!\" Ashe appealed to gods and men. \"How do you expect me to dress\nfor dinner?\"\n\n\"Oh, now, William, don't be tiresome!\" said Kitty, impatiently. \"He was\nbruised black and blue\"--(\"Serve him right for getting in the way,\"\ngrumbled Lord Grosville)--\"and nurse and I have done him up in arnica.\"\n\nShe came to stand by Ashe, talking in an undertone and as fast as\npossible. The little Dean, who never could help watching her, thought\nher more beautiful--and wilder--than ever. Her eyes--it was hardly\nenough to say they shone--they glittered--in her delicate face; her\ngestures were more extravagant than he remembered them; her movements\nrestlessness itself.\n\nAshe listened with patience--then said:\n\n\"I can't help it, Kitty--you really must have him removed.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" she said, her cheek flaming.\n\n\"I'll go and talk to Wilson; he'll manage it,\" said Ashe, getting up.\n\nKitty pursued him, arguing incessantly.\n\nHe lounged along, turning every now and then to look at her, smiling and\ndemurring, his hat on the back of his head.\n\n\"You see the difference,\" said Mrs. Alcot, in Darrell's ear. \"Last year\nKitty would have got her way. This year she won't.\"\n\nDarrell shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"These domesticities should be kept out of sight, don't you think?\"\n\nMadeleine Alcot looked at him curiously.\n\n\"Did you have a pleasant walk?\" she said.\n\nDarrell made a little face.\n\n\"The great man was condescending.\"\n\nMadeleine Alcot's face was still interrogative.\n\n\"A touch of the _folie des grandeurs?_\"\n\n\"Well, who escapes it?\" said Darrell, bitterly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMost of the party had dispersed. Only Lady Tranmore and Margaret French\nwere on the lawn. Margaret was writing some household notes for Kitty;\nLady Tranmore sat in meditation, with a book before her which she was\nnot reading. Miss French glanced at her from time to time. Ashe's mother\nwas beginning to show the weight of years far more plainly than she had\nyet done. In these last three years the face had perceptibly altered; so\nhad the hair. The long strain of nursing, and that pathetic change which\nmakes of the husband who has been a woman's pride and shelter her\nhalf-conscious dependent, had, no doubt, left deep marks upon a beauty\nwhich had so long resisted time. And yet Margaret French believed it was\nrather with her son than with her husband that the constant and wearing\nanxiety of Lady Tranmore's life should be connected. All the ambition,\nthe pride of race and history which had been disappointed in her husband\nhad poured themselves into her devotion to her son. She lived now for\nhis happiness and success. And both were constantly threatened by the\npersonality and the presence of Kitty.\n\nSuch, at least, as Margaret French well knew, was the inmost\npersuasion--fast becoming a fanaticism--of Ashe's mother. William might,\nindeed, for the moment have triumphed over the consequences of Kitty's\nbygone behavior. But the reckless, untamed character was there still at\nhis side, preparing Heaven knew what pitfalls and catastrophes. Lady\nTranmore lived in fear. And under the outward sweetness and dignity of\nher manner was there not developing something worse than fear--that\nhatred which is one of the strange births of love?\n\nIf so, was it just? There were many moments when Margaret would have\nindignantly denied it.\n\nIt was true, indeed, that Kitty's eccentricity seemed to develop with\nevery month that passed. The preceding winter had been marked, first by\na mad folly of table-turning--involving the pursuit of a particular\nmedium whose proceedings had ultimately landed him in the dock; then by\na headlong passion for hunting, accompanied by a series of new\nflirtations, each more unseemly than its predecessor, as it seemed to\nLady Tranmore. Afterwards--during the general election--a political\nphase! Kitty had most unfortunately discovered that she could speak in\npublic, and had fallen in love with the sound of her own voice. In\nAshe's own contest, her sallies and indiscretions had already begun to\ndo mischief when Lady Tranmore had succeeded in enticing her to London\nby the bait of a French _clairvoyante_, with whom Kitty nightly tempted\nthe gods who keep watch over the secrets of fate--till William's poll\nhad been declared.\n\nAll this was deplorably true. And yet no one could say that Kitty in\nthis checkered year had done her husband much harm. Ashe was no longer\nher blind slave; and his career had carried him to heights with which\neven his mother might have been satisfied. Sometimes Margaret was\ninclined to think that Kitty had now less influence with him and his\nmother more than was the just due of each. She--the younger woman--felt\nthe tragedy of Ashe's new and growing emancipation. Secretly--often--she\nsided with Kitty!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Margaret!\"\n\nThe voice was Kitty's. She came running out, her pale-pink skirts flying\nround her. \"Have you seen the babe?\"\n\nMargaret replied that he and his nurse were just in sight.\n\nKitty fled over the lawn to meet the child's perambulator. She lifted\nhim out, and carried him in her arms towards Margaret and Lady Tranmore.\n\n\"Isn't it piteous?\" said Margaret, under her breath, as the mother and\nchild approached. Lady Tranmore gave her a sad, assenting look.\n\nFor during the last six months the child had shown signs of brain\nmischief--a curious apathy, broken now and then by fits of temper. The\ndoctors were not encouraging. And Kitty varied between the most\npassionate attempts to rouse the child's failing intelligence and\ndays--even weeks--when she could hardly bring herself to see him at all.\n\nShe brought him now to a seat beside Lady Tranmore. She had been trying\nto make him take notice of a new toy. But the child looked at her with\nblank and glassy eyes, and the toy fell from his hand.\n\n\"He hardly knows me,\" said Kitty, in a low voice of misery, as she\nclasped her hands round the baby of three, and looked into his face, as\nthough she would drag from it some sign of mind and recognition.\n\nBut the blue eyes betrayed no glimmer of response, till suddenly, with a\ngesture as of infinite fatigue, the child threw itself back against her,\nlaying its fair head upon her breast with a long sigh.\n\nKitty gave a sob, and bent over him, kissing--and kissing him.\n\n\"Dear Kitty!\" said Lady Tranmore, much moved. \"I think--partly--he is\ntired with the heat.\"\n\nKitty shook her head.\n\n\"Take him!\" she said to the nurse--\"take him! I can't bear it.\"\n\nThe nurse took him from her, and Kitty dried her tears with a kind of\nfierceness.\n\n\"There is the post!\" she said, springing up, as though determined to\nthrow off her grief as quickly as possible, while the nurse carried the\nchild away.\n\nThe footman brought the letters across the lawn. There were some for\nLady Tranmore and for Margaret French. In the general opening and\nreading that ensued, neither lady noticed Kitty for a while. Suddenly\nMargaret French looked up. She saw Kitty sitting motionless with a book\non her lap, a book of which the wrapper lay on the grass beside her. Her\nfinger kept a page; her eyes, full of excitement, were fixed on the\ndistant horizon of the park; the hurried breathing was plainly\nnoticeable under the thin bodice.\n\n\"Kitty--time to dress!\" said Margaret, touching her.\n\nKitty rose, without a word to either of them, and walked quickly away,\nher hands, still holding the book, dropped in front of her, her eyes on\nthe ground.\n\n\"Oh, Kitty!\" cried Margaret, in laughing protest, as she stooped to pick\nup the litter of Kitty's letters, some of them still unopened, which lay\nscattered on the grass, as they had fallen unheeded from her lap.\n\nBut the little figure in the trailing skirts was already out of hearing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dinner Kitty was in her wildest spirits--a sparkling vision of\ndiamonds and lace, much beyond--so it seemed to Lord Grosville--what the\noccasion required. \"Dressed out like a comedy queen at a fair!\" was his\ninward comment, and he already rolled the phrases in which he should\ndescribe the whole party to his wife. Like the expected Lord Parham, he\nwas there in sign of semi-reconciliation. Nothing would have induced\nKitty to invite her aunt; the memory of a certain Sunday was too strong.\nOn her side, Lady Grosville averred that nothing would have induced her\nto sit at Kitty's board. As to this, her husband cherished a certain\nscepticism. However, her resolution was not tried. It was Ashe, in fact,\nwho had invited Lord Grosville, and Lord Grosville, who was master in\nhis own house, and had no mind to break with William Ashe just as that\ngentleman's company became even better worth having than usual, had\naccepted the invitation.\n\nBut his patience was sorely tried by Kitty. After dinner she insisted on\ntable-turning, and Lord Grosville was dragged breathless through the\ndrawing-room window, in pursuit of a table that broke a chair and\nfinally danced upon a flower-bed. His theology was harassed by these\nproceedings and his digestion upset. The Dean took it with smiles; but\nthen the Dean was a Latitudinarian.\n\nAfterwards Kitty and the Cambridge boy--Eddie Helston--performed a\nduologue in French for the amusement of the company. Whatever could be\nunderstood in it had better not have been understood--such at least was\nLord Grosville's impression. He wondered how Ashe--who laughed\nimmoderately--could allow his wife to do such things; and his only\nconsolation was that, for once, the Dean--whose fancy for Kitty was\nridiculous!--seemed to be disturbed. He had at any rate walked away to\nthe library in the middle of the piece. Kitty was, of course, making a\nfool of the boy all through. Any one could see that he was head over\nears in love with her. And she seemed to have all sorts of mysterious\nunderstandings with him. Lord Grosville was certain they passed each\nother notes, and made assignations. And one night, on going up himself\nto bed very late, he had actually come upon the pair pacing up and down\nthe long passage after midnight!--Kitty in such a _neglig\u00c3\u00a9e_ as only an\nactress should wear, with her hair about her ears--and the boy out of\nhis wits and off his balance, as any one could see. Kitty, indeed, had\nbeen quite unabashed--trying even to draw _him_ into their unseemly talk\nabout some theatrical nonsense or other; and such blushes as there were\nhad been entirely left to the boy.\n\nHe supposed there was no harm in it. The lad was not a Geoffrey Cliffe,\nand it was no doubt Kitty's mad love of excitement which impelled her\nto these defiances of convention. But Ashe should put his foot down;\nthere was no knowing with a creature so wild and so lovely where these\nthings might end. And after the scandal of last year--\n\nAs to that scandal, Lord Grosville, as a man of the world, by no means\nendorsed the lurid imaginations of his wife. Kitty and Cliffe had\ncertainly behaved badly at Grosville Park--that is to say, judged by any\nordinary standards. And the gossip of the season had apparently gathered\nand culminated round some incident of a graver character than the\nrest--though nobody precisely knew what it might be. But it seemed that\nAshe had at last asserted himself; and if in Kitty's abrupt departure to\nthe country, and the sudden dissolution of the intimacy between herself\nand Cliffe, those who loved her not had read what dark things they\npleased, her uncle by marriage was quite content to see in it a mere\ndisciplinary act on the part of the husband.\n\nLord Grosville believed that some rumors as to Cliffe's private\ncharacter had entered into the decisive defeat--in a constituency\nlargely Nonconformist--which had befallen that gentleman at the polls.\nPoor Lady Tranmore! He saw her anxieties in her face, and was truly\nsorry for her. At the same time, inveterate gossip that he was, he\nregarded her with a kind of hunger. If she only _would_ talk things over\nwith him! So far, however, she had given him very little opening. If she\never did, he would certainly advise her to press something like a\ntemporary separation on her son. Why should not Lady Kitty be left at\nHaggart when the next session began? Lord Grosville, who had been a\nfriend of Melbourne's, recalled the early history of that great man.\nWhen Lady Caroline Lamb had become too troublesome to a political\nhusband, she had been sent to Brocket. And then Mr. Lamb was only Irish\nSecretary--without a seat in the cabinet. How was it possible to take an\nimportant share in steering the ship of state, and to look after a giddy\nwife at the same time?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAshe and his guests lingered late below-stairs. When, somewhere about\none o'clock, he entered his dressing-room, he was suddenly alarmed by a\nsmell of burning. It seemed to come from Kitty's room. He knocked\nhastily at her door.\n\n\"Kitty!\"\n\nNo answer. He opened the door, and stood arrested.\n\nThe room was in complete darkness save for some weird object in the\ncentre of it, on which a fire was burning, sending up a smoke which hung\nabout the room. Ashe recognized an old Spanish brazier of beaten copper,\nstanding on iron feet, which had been a purchase of his own in days when\nhe trifled with _bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac_. Upon it, a heap of some light material,\nwhich fluttered and crackled as it burned, was blazing and smoking away,\nwhile beside it--her profile set and waxen amid the drifts of smoke, her\nfair hair blanched to whiteness by the strange illumination from below,\nand all her slight form, checkered with the light and shade of the fire,\ndrawn into a curve of watchfulness, vindictive and intent--stood Kitty.\n\n\"What in the name of fortune are you doing, Kitty?\" cried Ashe.\n\nShe made no answer, and he approached. Then he saw that in the centre\nof the pile, and propped up against some small pieces of wood, a\nphotograph of Geoffrey Cliffe was consuming slow and dismally. The fire\nhad just sent a line across his cheek. The lower limbs were already\ncharred, and the right hand was shrivelling.\n\nAll around were letters, mostly consumed; while at the top of the pile\nabove the culprit's head, stuck in a cleft stick, and just beginning to\nbe licked by the flames, was what seemed to be a leaf torn out of a\nbook. The book from which it had apparently been wrenched lay open on a\nchair near.\n\nKitty drew a long breath as Ashe came near her.\n\n\"Keep off!\" she said--\"don't touch it!\"\n\n\"You little goose!\" cried Ashe--\"what are you about?\"\n\n\"Burning a coward in effigy,\" said Kitty, between her teeth.\n\nAshe thrust his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"I wish to God you'd forget the creature, instead of flattering him with\nthese attentions!\"\n\nKitty made no reply, but as she drew the fire together Ashe captured her\nhand.\n\n\"What's he been doing now, Kitty?\"\n\n\"There are his poems,\" said Kitty, pointing to the chair. \"The last one\nis about me.\"\n\n\"May I be allowed to see it?\"\n\n\"It isn't there.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see. You've topped the pile with it. With your leave, I'll delay\nits doom.\" He snatched the leaf from its stick, and bending down read it\nby the light of the burning paper. Kitty watched him, frowning, her hand\non her hip, the white wrap she wore over her night-dress twining round\nher in close folds a slender, brooding sorceress, some Canidia or\nSimaetha, interrupted in her ritual of hate.\n\nBut Ashe was in no mood for literary reminiscence. His lip was\ncontemptuous, his brow angry as he replaced the leaf in its cleft stick,\nwhither the flames immediately pursued it.\n\n\"Wretched stuff, and damned impertinence!--that's all there is to say.\nFor Heaven's sake, Kitty, don't let any one suppose you mind the\nthing--for an instant!\"\n\nShe looked at him with strange eyes. \"But if I do mind it?\"\n\nHis face darkened to the shade of hers. \"Does that mean--that you still\nthink of him--still wish to see him?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Kitty, slowly. The fire had died away. Nothing but\na few charred remnants remained in the brazier. Ashe lit the gas, and\ndisclosed a tragic Kitty, flushed by the audacity of her last remark. He\ntook her masterfully in his arms.\n\n\"That was bravado,\" he said, kissing her. \"You love _me_! And I may be a\npoor stick, but I'm worth a good many Cliffes. Defy me--and I'll write\nyou a better poem, too!\"\n\nThe color leaped afresh in Kitty's cheek. She pushed him away, and,\nholding him, perused his handsome, scornful face, and all the manly\nstrength of form and attitude. Her own lids wavered.\n\n\"What a silly scene!\" she said, and fell--a little, soft, yielding\nform--into his arms.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nThe church clock of Haggart village had just struck half-past six. A\nwhite, sunny mist enwrapped the park and garden. Voices and shouts rang\nthrough the mist; little could yet be seen, but the lawns and the park\nseemed to be pervaded with bustle and preparation, and every now and\nthen as the mist drifted groups of workmen could be distinguished,\nmarquees emerged, flags floated, and carts laden with benches and\ntrestle-tables rumbled slowly over the roads and tracks of the park.\n\nThe house itself was full of gardeners, arranging banks of magnificent\nflowers in the hall and drawing-rooms, and superintended by the head\ngardener, a person of much greater dignity than Ashe himself, who swore\nat any underling making a noise, as though the slumbers of the \"quality\"\nin the big house overhead and the danger of disturbing them were the\ndearest interests of a burdened life.\n\nAs to the mistress of the house, at any rate, there was no need for\ncaution. The clocks of the house had barely followed the church clock in\nstriking the half-hour when the workmen on the ground floor saw Lady\nKitty come down-stairs and go through the drawing-room window into the\ngarden. There she gave her opinion on the preparations, pushing on\nafterwards into the park, where she astounded the various contractors\nand their workmen by her appearance at such an hour, and by the vigor\nand decision of her orders. Finally she left the park behind, just as\nits broad, scorched surfaces began everywhere to shake off the mist, and\nentered one of the bordering woods.\n\nShe had a basket on her arm, and, when she had found for herself a mossy\nseat amid the roots of a great oak, she unpacked it. It contained a mass\nof written pages, some fresh scribbling-paper, ink and pens, and a small\nportfolio. When they were all lying on the moss beside her, Kitty turned\nover the sheets with a loving hand, reading here and there.\n\n\"It is good!\" she said to herself. \"I vow it is!\"\n\nDipping her pen in the ink, she began upon corrections. The sun filtered\nthrough the thick leafage overhead, touching her white dress, her small\nshoes, and the masses of her hair. She wore a Leghorn garden-hat, tied\nwith pink ribbons under her chin, and in her morning freshness and\ndaintiness she looked about seventeen. The hours of sleep had calmed the\nrestlessness of the wide, brown eyes; they were full now of gentleness\nand mirth.\n\n\"I wonder if he'll come?\"\n\nShe looked up and listened. And as she did so, her eyes and sense were\nseized with the beauty of the wood. The mystery of early solitary hours\nseemed to be still upon it; both in the sunlight and the shadow there\nwas a magic unknown to the later day. In a clearing before her spread a\nlake of willow-herb, of a pure bright pink, hemmed in by a golden shore\nof ragwort. The splash of color gave Kitty a passionate delight.\n\n\"Dear, dear world!\" She stretched out her hands to it in a childish\ngreeting.\n\nThen the joy died sharply from her eyes. \"How many years left--to enjoy\nit in--before one dies--or one's heart dies?\"\n\nInvariably, now, her moments of sensuous pleasure ended in this dread of\nsomething beyond--of a sudden drowning of beauty and delight--of a\nfuture unknown and cruel, coming to meet her, like some armed assassin\nin a narrow path.\n\nWilliam! When it came could William save her? \"William is a _darling_!\"\nshe said to herself, her face full of yearning.\n\nAs for that other--it gave her an intense pleasure to think of the\nflames creeping up the form and face of the photograph. Should she hear,\nperhaps, in a week or two that he had been seized with some mysterious\nillness, like the witch-victims of old? A shiver ran through her, a\nthrill of repentance--till the bitter lines of the poem came back to\nmemory--lines describing a woman with neither the courage for sin nor\nthe strength for virtue, a \"light woman\" indeed, whom the great passions\npassed eternally by, whom it was a humiliation to court and a mere\nweakness to regret. Then she laughed, and began again with passionate\nzest upon the sheets before her.\n\nA sound of approaching footsteps on the wood-path. She half rose,\nsmiling.\n\nThe branches parted, and Darrell appeared. He paused to survey the oread\nvision of Lady Kitty.\n\n\"Am I not to the minute?\" He held up his watch in front of her.\n\n\"So you got my note?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I was immensely flattered.\" He threw himself down on the\nmoss beside her, his sallow, long-chinned face and dark eyes toned to a\nmorning cheerfulness, his dress much fresher and more exact than usual.\n\"But he is one of the men who look so much better in their old clothes!\"\nthought Kitty.\n\n\"Well, what can I do for you, Lady Kitty?\" he resumed, smiling.\n\n\"I wanted your advice,\" said Kitty--not altogether sure, now that he was\nthere beside her, that she did want it.\n\n\"About your literary work?\"\n\nShe threw him a quick glance.\n\n\"Do you know? How do you know? I have been writing a book!\"\n\n\"So I imagined--\"\n\n\"And--and--\" She broke now into eagerness, bending forward, \"I want you\nto help me get it published. It is a deadly secret. Nobody knows--\"\n\n\"Not even William?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she repeated. \"And I can't tell you about it, or show you a\nline of it, unless you vow and swear to me--\"\n\n\"Oh! I swear,\" said Darrell, tranquilly--\"I swear.\"\n\nKitty looked at him doubtfully a moment--then resumed:\n\n\"I have written it at all sorts of times--when William was away--in the\nmiddle of the night--out in the woods. _Nobody_ knows. You see\"--her\nlittle fingers plucked at the moss--\"I have a good many advantages. If\npeople want 'Society' with a big S, I can give it them!\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Darrell.\n\n\"And it always amuses people--doesn't it?\"\n\nKitty clasped her hands round her knees and looked at him with candor.\n\n\"Does it?\" said Darrell. \"It has been done a good deal.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" said Kitty, impatiently, \"mine's not the proper thing.\nYou don't imagine I should try and write like Thackeray, do you? Mine's\n_real_ people--_real_ things that happened--with just the names\naltered.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Darrell, sitting up--\"that sounds exciting. Is it libellous?\"\n\n\"Well, that's just what I want to know,\" said Kitty, slowly. \"Of course,\nI've made a kind of story out of it. But you'd have to be a great fool\nnot to guess. I've put myself in, and--\"\n\n\"And Ashe?\"\n\nKitty nodded. \"All the novels that are written about politics\nnowadays--except Dizzy's--are such nonsense, aren't they? I just wanted\nto describe--from the inside--how a real statesman\"--she threw up her\nhead proudly--\"lives, and what he does.\"\n\n\"Excellent subject,\" said Darrell. \"Well--anybody else?\"\n\nKitty flushed. \"You'll see,\" she said, uncertainly.\n\nDarrell's involuntary smile was hidden by a bunch of honeysuckle at\nwhich he was sniffing. \"May I look?\" he asked, stretching out a hand for\nthe sheets.\n\nShe pushed them towards him, half unwilling, half eager, and he began to\nturn them over. Apparently it had a thread of story--both slender and\nextravagant. And on the thread--Hullo!--here was the fancy ball; he\npounced upon it. A portrait of Lady Parham--Ye powers! he chuckled as he\nread. On the next page the Chancellor of the Exchequer--snub-nosed\n_parvenu_ and Puritan--admirably caught. Further on a speech of Ashe's\nin the House--with caricature to right and caricature to left ... Ah! the\npoet!--at last! He bent over the page till Kitty coughed and fidgeted,\nand he thought it best to hurry on. But it was war, he perceived--open,\nundignified, feminine war. On the next page, the Archbishop of\nCanterbury--with Lady Kitty's views on the Athanasian Creed! Heavens!\nwhat a book! Next, Royalty itself, not too respectfully handled. Then\nAshe again--Ashe glorified, Ashe explained, Ashe intrigued against, and\nAshe triumphant--everywhere the centre of the stage, and everywhere, of\ncourse, all unknown to the author, the fool of the piece. Political\nindiscretions also, of the most startling kind, as coming from the wife\nof a cabinet minister. Allusions, besides, scattered broadcast, to the\nscandals of the day--material as far as he could see for a dozen libel\nactions. And with it all, much fantastic ability, flashes of wit and\nromance, enough to give the book wings beyond its first personal\naudience--enough, in fact, to secure to all its scandalous matter the\nwidest possible chance of fame.\n\n\"Well!\"\n\nHe rolled over on his elbows, and lay staring at the sheets before\nhim--dumb. What was he to say?\n\nA thought struck him. As far as he could perceive, there was an empty\nniche.\n\n\"And Lord Parham?\"\n\nA smile of mischief broadened on Kitty's lips.\n\n\"That'll come,\" she said--and checked herself. Darrell bowed his face on\nhis hands and laughed, unseen. To what sacrificial rite was the\nunconscious victim hurrying--at that very moment--in the express train\nwhich was to land him at Haggart Station that afternoon?\n\n\"Well!\" said Kitty, impatiently--\"what do you think? Can you help me?\"\n\nDarrell looked up.\n\n\"You know, Lady Kitty, that book can't be published like that. Nobody\nwould risk it.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose they'll tell me what to cut out.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Darrell, slowly, caught by many reflections--\"no doubt some\nclever fellow will know how near the wind it's possible to sail. But,\nanyway, trim it as you like, the book will make a scandal.\"\n\n\"Will it?\" Kitty's eyes flashed. She sat up radiant, her breath quick\nand defiant.\n\n\"I don't see,\" he resumed, \"how you can publish it without consulting\nAshe.\"\n\nKitty gave a cry of protest.\n\n\"No, no, _no_! Of course he'd disapprove. But then--he soon forgives a\nthing, if he thinks it clever. And it is clever, isn't it?--some of it.\nHe'd laugh--and then it would be all right. _He'd_ never pay out his\nenemies, but he couldn't help enjoying it if some one else did--could\nhe?\" She pleaded like a child.\n\n\"'No need to forgive them,'\" murmured Darrell, as he rolled over on his\nback and put his hat over his eyes--\"for you would have 'shot them\nall.'\"\n\nUnder the shelter of his hat he tried to think himself clear. What\n_really_ were her motives? Partly, no doubt, a childish love of\nexcitement--partly revenge? The animus against the Parhams was clear in\nevery page. Cliffe, too, came badly out of it--a fantastic Byronic\nmixture of libertine and cad. Lady Kitty had better beware! As far as\nhe knew, Cliffe had never yet been struck, with impunity to the striker.\n\nIf these precious sheets ever appeared, Ashe's position would certainly\nbe shaken. Poor wretch!--endeavoring to pursue a serious existence,\nyoked to such an impish sprite as this! His own fault, after all. That\nfirst night, at Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es', was not her madness written in her\neyes?\n\n\"Now tell me, Lady Kitty\"--he roused himself to look at her with some\nattention--\"what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"To find me a publisher, and\"--she stooped towards him with a laughing\nshyness--\"to get me some money.\"\n\n\"Money!\"\n\n\"I've been so awfully extravagant lately,\" said Kitty, frankly.\n\"Something really will have to be done. And the book's worth some money,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"A good deal,\" said Darrell. Then he added, with emphasis--\"I really\ncan't be responsible for it in any way, Lady Kitty.\"\n\n\"Of course not. I will never, _never_ say I told you! But, you see, I'm\nnot literary--I don't know in the least how to set about it. If you\nwould just put me in communication?\"\n\nDarrell pondered. None of the well-known publishers, of course, would\nlook at it. But there were plenty of people who would--and give Lady\nKitty a large sum of money for it, too.\n\nWhat part, however, could he--Darrell--play in such a transaction?\n\n\"I am bound to warn you,\" he said, at last, looking up, \"that your\nhusband will probably strongly disapprove this book, and that it may do\nhim harm.\"\n\nKitty bit her lip.\n\n\"But if I tell nobody who wrote it--and you tell nobody?\"\n\n\"Ashe would know at once. Everybody would know.\"\n\n\"William would know,\" his companion admitted, unwillingly. \"But I don't\nsee why anybody else should. You see, I've put myself in--I've said the\nmost shocking things!\"\n\nDarrell replied that she would not find that device of much service to\nher.\n\n\"However--I can no doubt get an opinion for you.\"\n\nKitty, all delight, thanked him profusely.\n\n\"You shall have the whole of it before you go--Friday, isn't it?\" she\nsaid, eagerly gathering it up.\n\nDarrell was certainly conscious of no desire to burden himself with the\nhorrid thing. But he was rarely able to refuse the request of a pretty\nand fashionable woman, and it flattered his conceit to be the sole\nrecipient of what might very well turn out to be a political secret of\nsome importance. Not that he meant to lay himself open to any just\nreproach whatever in the matter. He would show it to some fitting\nperson--to pacify Lady Kitty--write a letter of strong protest to her\nafterwards--and wash his hands of it. What might happen then was not his\nbusiness.\n\nMeanwhile his inner mind was full of an acrid debate which turned\nentirely upon his interview with Ashe of the day before. No doubt, as an\nold friend, aware of Lady Kitty's excitable character, he might have\nfelt it his duty to go straight to Ashe, _co\u00c3\u00bbte que co\u00c3\u00bbte_, and warn\nhim of what was going on. But what encouragement had been given him to\nplay so Quixotic a part? Why should he take any particular thought for\nAshe's domestic peace, or Ashe's public place? What consideration had\nAshe shown for _him_? \"Tu l'as voulu, Georges Dandin!\"\n\nSo it ended in his promising to take the MS. to London with him, and let\nLady Kitty know the result of his inquiries. Kitty's dancing step as\nthey returned to the house betrayed the height of her spirits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rumor flew round the house towards the middle of the day that Harry,\nthe little heir, was worse. Kitty did not appear at luncheon, and the\ndoctor was sent for. Before he came, it was known only to Margaret\nFrench that Kitty had escaped by herself from the house and could not be\nfound. Ashe and Lady Tranmore saw the doctor, who prescribed, and would\nnot admit that there was any cause for alarm. The heat had tried the\nchild, and Lady Kitty--he looked round the nursery for her in some\nperplexity--might be quite reassured.\n\nMargaret found her, wandering in the park--very wild and pale--told her\nthe doctor's verdict, and brought her home. Kitty said little or\nnothing, and was presently persuaded to change her dress for Lord\nParham's arrival. By the time the operation was over she was full as\nusual of smiles and chatter, with no trace apparently of the mood which\nhad gone before.\n\nLord Parham found the house-party assembled on the lawn, with Kitty in a\nthree-cornered hat, fantastically garnished at the side with a great\nplume of white cock's feathers, presiding at the tea-table.\n\n\"Ah!\" thought the Premier, as he approached--\"now for the tare in Ashe's\nwheat!\"\n\nNothing, however, could have been more gracious than Kitty's reception\nof him, or more effusive than his response. He took his seat beside her,\na solid and impressive figure, no less closely observed by such of the\nhabitual guests of the political country-houses as happened to be\npresent, than by the sprinkling of local clergy and country neighbors to\nwhom Kitty was giving tea. Lord Parham, though now in the fourth year of\nhis Premiership, was still something of a mystery to his countrymen;\nwhile for the inner circle it was an amusement and an event that he\nshould be seen without his wife.\n\nFor some time all went well. Kitty's manners and topics were alike\nbeyond reproach. When presently she inquired politely as to the success\nof his Scottish tour, Lord Parham hoped he had not altogether disgraced\nhimself. But, thank Heaven, it was done. Meanwhile Ashe, he supposed,\nhad been enjoying the pursuits of a scholar and a gentleman?--lucky\nfellow!\n\n\"He has been reading the Bible,\" said Kitty, carelessly, as she handed\ncake. \"Just now he's in the Acts. That's why, I suppose, he didn't hear\nthe carriage. John!\" She called a footman. \"Tell Mr. Ashe that Lord\nParham has arrived!\"\n\nThe Premier opened astonished eyes.\n\n\"Does Ashe generally study the Scriptures of an afternoon?\"\n\nKitty nodded--with her most confiding smile. \"When he can. He says\"--she\ndropped her voice to a theatrical whisper--\"the Bible is such a 'd----d\ninteresting' book!\"\n\nLord Parham started in his seat. Ashe and some of his friends still\nfaintly recalled, in their too familiar and public use of this\nparticular naughty word, the lurid vocabulary of the Peel and Melbourne\ngeneration. But in a lady's mouth the effect was prodigious. Lord\nGrosville frowned sternly and walked away; Eddie Helston smothered a\nburst of laughter; the Dean, startled, broke off a conversation with a\ngroup of archaeological clergymen and came to see what he could do to\nkeep Lady Kitty in order; while Lady Tranmore flushed deeply, and began\na hasty conversation with Lady Edith Manley. Meanwhile Kitty,\nquite unconscious, \"went on cutting\"--or rather, dispensing\n\"bread-and-butter\"; and Lord Parham changed the subject.\n\n\"What a charming house!\" he said, unwarily, waving his hand towards the\nHaggart mansion. He was short-sighted, and, in truth, saw only that it\nwas big.\n\nKitty looked at him in wonder--a friendly and amiable wonder. She said\nit was very kind of him to try and spare her feelings, but, really,\nanybody might say what they liked of Haggart. She and William weren't\nresponsible.\n\nLord Parham, rather nettled, put on his eye-glass, and, being an\nobstinate man, still maintained that he saw no reason at all to be\ndissatisfied with Haggart, from the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic point of view. Kitty said\nnothing, but for the first time a gleam of mockery showed itself in her\nchanging look.\n\nLady Tranmore, always nervously on the watch, moved forward at this\npoint, and Lord Parham, with marked and pompous suavity, transferred his\nconversation to her.\n\nThus assured, as he thought, of a good listener, and delivered from his\nuncomfortable hostess, Lord Parham crossed his legs and began to talk at\nhis ease. The guests round the various tea-tables converged, some\nstanding and some sitting, and made a circle about the great man. About\nKitty, too, who sat, equally conspicuous, dipping a biscuit in milk, and\nteasing her small dog with it. Lord Parham meanwhile described to Lady\nTranmore--at wearisome length--the demonstrations which had attended his\njourney south, the railway-station crowds, addresses, and so forth. He\nhandled the topic in a tone of jocular humility, which but slightly\nconcealed the vast complacency beneath. Kitty's lip twitched; she fed\nPonto hastily with all possible cakes.\n\n\"No one, of course, can keep any count of what he says on these\noccasions,\" resumed Lord Parham, with a gracious smile. \"I hope I talked\nsome sense--\"\n\n\"Oh, but why?\" said Kitty, looking up, her large fawn's eyes bent on the\nspeaker.\n\n\"Why?\" repeated Lord Parham, suddenly stiffening. \"I don't follow you,\nLady Kitty.\"\n\n\"Anybody can talk sense!\" said Kitty, throwing a big bit of muffin at\nPonto's nose. \"It's the other thing that's hard--isn't it?\"\n\n\"Lady Kitty,\" said the Dean, lifting a finger, \"you are plagiarizing\nfrom Mr. Pitt.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" said Kitty. \"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"I imagine that Mr. Pitt talked sense sometimes,\" said Lord Parham,\nshortly.\n\n\"Ah, that was when he was drunk!\" said Kitty. \"Then he wasn't\nresponsible.\"\n\nLord Parham and the circle laughed--though the Premier's laugh was a\nlittle dry and perfunctory.\n\n\"So you worship nonsense, Lady Kitty?\"\n\nKitty nodded sweetly.\n\n\"And so does William. Ah, here he is!\"\n\nFor Ashe appeared, hurrying over the lawn, and Lord Parham rose to greet\nhis host.\n\n\"Upon my word, Ashe, how well you look! _You_ have had some holiday!\"\n\n\"Which is more than can be said of yourself,\" said Ashe, with smiling\nsympathy. \"Well!--how have the speeches gone? Is there anything left of\nyou? Edinburgh was magnificent!\"\n\nHe wore his most radiant aspect as he sat down beside his guest; and\nKitty watching him, and already conscious of a renewed and excitable\ndislike for her guest, thought William was overdoing it absurdly, and\ngrew still more restive.\n\nThe Premier brought the tips of his fingers lightly together, as he\nresumed his seat.\n\n\"Oh! my dear fellow, people were very kind--too much so! Yes--I think it\ndid good--it did good. I should now rest and be thankful--if it weren't\nfor the Bishops!\"\n\n\"The Bishops!\" said the Rector of the parish standing near. \"What have\nthe Bishops been doing, my lord?\"\n\n\"Dying,\" said Kitty, as she fell into an attitude which commanded both\nWilliam and Lord Parham. \"They do it on purpose.\"\n\n\"Another this morning!\" said Ashe, throwing up his hands.\n\n\"Oh! they die to plague me,\" said the Prime Minister, with the air of\none on whom the universe weighs heavy. \"There never was such a\nconspiracy!\"\n\n\"You should let William appoint them,\" said Kitty, leaning her chin upon\nher hands and studying Lord Parham with eyes all the more brilliant for\nthe dark circles which fatigue, or something else, had drawn round them.\n\n\"Ah, to be sure!\" said Lord Parham, affably. \"I had forgotten that Ashe\nwas our theologian. Take me a walk before dinner!\" he added, addressing\nhis host.\n\n\"But you won't take his advice,\" said Kitty, smiling.\n\nThe Premier turned rather sharply.\n\n\"How do you know that, Lady Kitty?\"\n\nKitty hesitated--then said, with the prettiest, slightest laugh:\n\n\"Lady Parham has such strong views--hasn't she?--on Church questions!\"\n\nLord Parham's feeling was that a more insidiously impertinent question\nhad never been put to him. He drew himself up.\n\n\"If she has, Lady Kitty, I can only say I know very little about them!\nShe very wisely keeps them to herself.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Kitty, as her lovely eyebrows lifted, \"that shows how little\npeople know.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" said Lord Parham. \"To what do you allude,\nLady Kitty?\"\n\nKitty laughed. She raised her eyes to the Rector, a spare High\nChurchman, who had retreated uncomfortably behind Lady Tranmore.\n\n\"Some one--said to me last week--that Lady Parham had saved the\nChurch!\"\n\nThe Prime Minister rose. \"I must have a little exercise before dinner.\nYour gardens, Ashe--is there time?\"\n\nAshe, scarlet with discomfort and annoyance, carried his visitor off. As\nhe did so, he passed his wife. Kitty turned her little head, looked at\nhim half shyly, half defiantly. The Dean saw the look; saw also that\nAshe deliberately avoided it.\n\nThe party presently began to disperse. The Dean found himself beside his\nhostess--strolling over the lawn towards the house. He observed her\nattentively--vexed with her, and vexed for her! Surely she was thinner\nthan he had ever seen her. A little more, and her beauty would suffer\nseriously. Coming he knew not whence, there lit upon him the sudden and\npainful impression of something undermined, something consumed from\nwithin.\n\n\"Lady Kitty, do you ever rest?\" he asked her, unexpectedly.\n\n\"Rest!\" she laughed. \"Why should I?\"\n\n\"Because you are wearing yourself out.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Do you ever lie down--alone--and read a book?\" persisted the Dean.\n\n\"Yes. I have just finished Renan's _Vie de J\u00c3\u00a9sus_!\"\n\nHer glance, even with him, kept its note of audacity, but much softened\nby a kind of wistfulness.\n\n\"Ah! my dear Lady Kitty, let Renan alone,\" cried the Dean--then with a\nchange of tone--\"but are you speaking truth--or naughtiness?\"\n\n\"Truth,\" said Kitty. \"But--of course--I am in a temper.\"\n\nThe Dean laughed.\n\n\"I see Lord Parham is not a favorite of yours.\"\n\nKitty compressed her small lips.\n\n\"To think that William should have to take his orders from that man!\"\nshe said, under her breath.\n\n\"Bear it--for William's sake,\" said the Dean, softly, \"and,\nmeanwhile--take my advice--and don't read any more Renan!\"\n\nKitty looked at him curiously.\n\n\"I prefer to see things as they are.\"\n\nThe Dean sighed.\n\n\"That none of us can do, my dear Lady Kitty. No one can satisfy his\n_intelligence_. But religion speaks to the _will_--and it is the only\nthing between us and the void. Don't tamper with it! It is soon gone.\"\n\nA satirical expression passed over the face of his companion.\n\n\"Mine was gone before we had been a month married. William killed it.\"\n\nThe Dean exclaimed:\n\n\"I hear always of his interest in religious matters!\"\n\n\"He cares for nothing so much--and he doesn't believe one single word of\nanything! I was brought up in a convent, you know--but William laughed\nit all out of me.\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Kitty!\"\n\nKitty nodded. \"And now, of course, I know there's nothing in it. Oh! I\n_do_ beg your pardon!\" she said, eagerly. \"I never meant to say anything\nrude to _you._ And I must go!\" She looked up at an open window on the\nsecond floor of the house. The Dean supposed it was the nursery, and\nbegan to ask after the boy. But before he could frame his question she\nwas gone, flying over the grass with a foot that scarcely seemed to\ntouch it.\n\n\"Poor child, poor child!\" murmured the Dean, in a most genuine distress.\nBut it was not the boy he was thinking of.\n\nPresently, however, he was overtaken by Miss French, of whom he inquired\nhow the baby was.\n\nMargaret hesitated. \"He seems to lose strength,\" she said, sadly. \"The\ndoctor declares there is no danger, unless--\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Oh! but it's so unlikely!\" was her hasty reply. \"Don't let's think of\nit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty was just giving a last look at herself in the large mirror which\nlined half one of the sides of her room when Ashe invaded her. She\nglanced at him askance a little, and when the maid had gone Kitty\nhurriedly gathered up gloves and fan and prepared to follow her.\n\n\"Kitty--one word!\"\n\nHe caught her in his arm, and held her while he looked down upon her\nsparkling dress and half-reluctant face. \"Kitty, do be nice to that old\nfellow to-night! It's only for two nights. Take him in the right way,\nand make a conquest of him--for good. He's been very decent to me in our\nwalk--though you did say such extraordinary things to him this\nafternoon. I believe he really wants to make amends.\"\n\n\"I do hate his white eyelashes so,\" said Kitty, slowly.\n\n\"What does it matter,\" cried Ashe, angrily, \"whether he were a\nblue-faced baboon!--for two nights? Just listen to him a little,\nKitty--that's all he wants. And--don't be offended!--but hold your own\nsmall tongue--just a little!\"\n\nKitty pulled herself away.\n\n\"I believe I shall do something dreadful,\" she said, quietly.\n\nA sternness to which Ashe's good-humored face was almost wholly strange\nshowed itself in his expression.\n\n\"Why should you do anything dreadful, please? Lord Parham is your guest,\nand my political chief. Is there any woman in England who would not do\nher best to be civil to him under the circumstances?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Kitty, with deliberation. \"No, I don't think there\ncan be.\"\n\n\"Kitty!\"\n\nFor the first time Ashe was conscious of real exasperation. What was to\nbe done with a temperament and a disposition like this?\n\n\"Do you never think that you have it in your power to help me or to ruin\nme?\" he said, with vehemence.\n\n\"Oh yes--often. I mean--to help you--in my own way.\"\n\nAshe's laugh was a sound of pure annoyance.\n\n\"But please understand, it would be _infinitely_ better if you would\nhelp me, in _my_ way--in the natural, accepted way--the way that\neverybody understands.\"\n\n\"The way Lord Parham recommends?\" Kitty looked at him quietly. \"Never\nmind, William. I _am_ trying to help you.\"\n\nHer eyes shone with the strangest glitter. Ashe was conscious of another\nof those sudden stabs of anxiety about her which he had felt at\nintervals through the preceding year. His face softened.\n\n\"Dear, don't let's talk nonsense! Just look at me sometimes at dinner,\nand say to yourself, 'William asks me--for his sake--to be nice to Lord\nParham.'\"\n\nHe again drew her to him, but she repulsed him almost with violence.\n\n\"Why is he here? Why have we people dining? We ought to be alone--in the\ndark!\"\n\nHer face had become a white mask. Her breast rose and fell, as though\nshe fought with sobs.\n\n\"Kitty--what do you mean?\" He recoiled in dismay.\n\n\"Harry!\"--she just breathed the word between her closed lips.\n\n\"My darling!\" cried Ashe, \"I saw Dr. Rotherham myself this afternoon. He\ngave the most satisfactory account, and Margaret told me she had\nrepeated everything to you. The child will soon be himself again.\"\n\n\"He is _dying_!\" said Kitty, in the same low, remote voice, her gaze\nstill fixed on Ashe.\n\n\"Kitty! Don't say such things--don't think them!\" Ashe had himself grown\npale. \"At any rate\"--he turned on her reproachfully--\"tell me _why_ you\nthink them. Confide in me, Kitty. Come and talk to me about the boy. But\nthree-fourths of the time you behave as though there were nothing the\nmatter with him--you won't even see the doctor--and then you say a thing\nlike this!\"\n\nShe was silent a moment; then with a wild gesture of the head and\nshoulders, as of one shaking off a weight, she moved away--drew on her\nlong gloves--and going to the dressing-table, gave a touch of rouge to\nher cheeks.\n\n\"Kitty, why did you say that?\" Ashe followed her entreatingly.\n\n\"I don't know. At least, I couldn't explain. Now, shall we go down?\"\n\nAshe drew a long breath. His frail son held the inmost depths of his\nheart.\n\n\"You have made the party an abomination to me!\" he said, with energy.\n\n\"Don't believe me, then--believe the doctor,\" said Kitty, her face\nchanging. \"And as for Lord Parham, I'll try, William--I'll try.\"\n\nShe passed him--the loveliest of visions--flung him a hand to kiss--and\nwas gone.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nThere could be no question that in all external matters Lord Parham was\nthat evening magnificently entertained by the Home Secretary and Lady\nKitty Ashe. The chef was extravagantly good; the wines, flowers, and\nservice lavish to a degree which made both Ashe and Lady Tranmore\nsecretly uncomfortable. Lady Tranmore in particular detested \"show,\"\ninfluenced as much by aristocratic instinct as by moral qualms; and\nthere was to her mind a touch of vulgarity in the entertaining at\nHaggart, which might be tolerated in the case of financiers and\n_nouveaux riches_, while, as connected with her William and his wife,\nwho had no need whatever to bribe society, it was unbecoming and\nundignified. Moreover, the winter had been marked by a financial crisis\ncaused entirely by Kitty's extravagance. A large sum of money had had to\nbe raised from the Tranmore estates; times were not good for the landed\ninterest, and the head agent had begun to look grave.\n\nIf only William would control his wife! But Haggart contained one of\nthose fine, slowly gathered libraries which make the distinction of so\nmany English country-houses; and in the intervals of his official work,\nwhich even in holiday time was considerable, Ashe could not be beguiled\nfrom the beloved company of his books to help Kitty sign checks, or\nscold her about expenditure.\n\nSo Kitty signed and signed; and the smaller was Ashe's balance, the\nmore, it seemed, did Kitty spend. Then, of course, every few months,\nthere were deficits which had to be made good. And as to the debts which\naccumulated, Lady Tranmore preferred not to think about them. It all\nmeant future trouble and clipping of wings for William; and it all\nentered into that deep and hidden resentment, half anxious love, half\nalien temperament, which Elizabeth Tranmore felt towards Ashe's wife.\n\nHowever--to repeat--Lord Parham, as far as the fleshpots went, was\nfinely treated. Kitty was in full force, glittering in a spangled dress,\nher dazzling face and neck, and the piled masses of her hair, thrown out\nin relief against the panelled walls of the dining-room with a\nbrilliance which might have tempted a modern Rembrandt to paint an\nEnglish Saskia. Eddie Helston, on her left, could not take his eyes from\nher. And even Lord Parham, much as he disliked her, acknowledged, during\nthe early courses, that she was handsome, and in her own way--thank God!\nit was not the way of any womankind belonging to him--good company.\n\nHe saw, too, or thought he saw, that she was anxious to make him amends\nfor her behavior of the afternoon. She restrained herself, and talked\npolitics. And within the lines he always observed when talking to women,\nlines dictated by a contempt innate and ineradicable, Lord Parham was\nquite ready to talk politics too. Then--it suddenly struck him that she\nwas pumping him, and with great adroitness. Ashe, he knew, wanted an\nearly place in the session for a particular measure in which he was\ninterested. Lord Parham had no mind to give him the precedence that he\nwanted; was, in fact, determined on something quite different. But he\nwas well aware by now that Ashe was a person to be reckoned with; and he\nhad so far taken refuge in vagueness--an amiable vagueness, by which\nAshe, on their walk before dinner, had been much taken in, misled no\ndoubt by the strength of his own wishes.\n\nAnd now here was Lady Kitty--whom, by-the-way, it was not at all easy to\ntake in--trying to \"manage\" him, to pin him to details, to wheedle him\nout of a pledge!\n\nLord Parham, presently, looked at her with cold, smiling eyes.\n\n\"Ah! you are interested in these things, Lady Kitty? Well--tell me your\nviews. You women have such an instinct--\"\n\n--whereby the moth was kept hovering round the flame. Till, in a flash,\nKitty awoke to the fact that while she had been listening happily to her\nown voice, taking no notice whatever of the signals which William\nendeavored to send her from the other end of the table--while she had\nbeen tripping gayly through one indiscretion after another, betraying\ninnumerable things as to William's opinions and William's plans that she\nhad infinitely better not have betrayed--Lord Parham had said nothing,\nbetrayed nothing, promised nothing. A quiet smile--a courteous nod--and\npresently a shade of mockery in the lips--the meaning of them, all in a\nmoment, burst on Kitty.\n\nHer face flamed. Thenceforward it would be difficult to describe the\ndinner. Conversationally, at Kitty's end it became an uproar. She\nstarted the wildest topics, and Lord Parham had afterwards a bruised\nrecollection as of one who has been dragged or driven, Caliban-like,\nthrough brake and thicket, pinched and teased and pelted by elfish\nfingers, without one single uncivil speech or act of overt offence to\nwhich an angry guest could point. With each later course, the Prime\nMinister grew stiffer and more silent. Endurance was written in every\nline of his fighting head and round, ungraceful shoulders, in his veiled\neyes and stolid mouth. Lady Tranmore gave a gasp of relief when at last\nKitty rose from her seat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe evening went no better. Lord Parham was set down to cards with\nKitty, Eddie Helston, and Lord Grosville. Lord Grosville, his partner,\nplayed, to the Premier's thinking, like an idiot, and Lady Kitty and the\nyoung man chattered and sparred, so that all reasonable play became\nimpossible. Lord Parham lost more than he at all liked to lose, and at\nhalf-past ten he pleaded fatigue, refused to smoke, and went to his\nroom.\n\nAshe was perfectly aware of the failure of the evening, and the\ndiscomfort of his guest. But he said nothing, and Kitty avoided his\nneighborhood. Meanwhile, between him and his mother a certain tacit\nunderstanding began to make itself felt. They talked quietly, in\ncorners, of the arrangements for the speech and f\u00c3\u00aate of the morrow. So\nfar, they had been too much left to Kitty. Ashe promised his mother to\nlook into them. He and she combined for the protection of Lord Parham.\n\nWhen about one o'clock Ashe went to bed, Kitty either was or pretended\nto be fast asleep. The room was in darkness save for the faint\nillumination of a night-light, which just revealed to Ashe the delicate\nfigure of his wife, lying high on her pillows, her cheek and brow hidden\nin the confusion of her hair.\n\nOne window was wide open to the night, and once more Ashe stood lost in\n\"recollection\" beside it, as on that night in Hill Street, more than a\nyear before. But the thoughts which on that former occasion had been\nstill as tragic and unfamiliar guests in a mind that repelled them had\nnow, alack, lost their strangeness; they entered habitually,\nunannounced--frequent, irritating, deplorable.\n\nHad the relation between himself and Kitty ever, in truth, recovered the\nshock of that incident on the river--of his night of restlessness, his\nmorning of agonized alarm, and the story to which he listened on her\nreturn? It had been like some physical blow or wound, easily healed or\nconquered for the moment, which then, as time goes on, reveals a hidden\nseries of consequences.\n\nConsequences, in this case, connected above all with Kitty's own nature\nand temperament. The excitement of Cliffe's declaration, of her own\nresistance and dramatic position, as between her husband and her lover,\nhad worked ever since, as a poison in Kitty's mind--Ashe was becoming\ndismally certain of it. The absurd incident of the night before with the\nphotograph had been enough to prove it.\n\nWell, the thing, he supposed, would right itself in time. Meanwhile,\nCliffe had been dismissed, and this foolish young fellow Eddie Helston\nmust soon follow him. Ashe had viewed the affair so far with an amused\ntolerance; if Kitty liked to flirt with babes it was her affair, not\nhis. But he perceived that his mother was once more becoming restless,\nunder the general _inconvenance_ of it; and he had noticed distress and\ndisapproval in the little Dean, Kitty's stanchest friend.\n\nLuckily, no difficulty there! The lad was almost as devoted to\nhim--Ashe--as he was to Kitty. He was absurd, affected, vain; but there\nwas no vice in him, and a word of remonstrance would probably reduce him\nto abject regret and self-reproach. Ashe intended that his mother should\nspeak it, and as he made up his mind to ask her help, he felt for the\nsecond time the sharp humiliation of the husband who cannot secure his\nown domestic peace, but must depend on the aid of others. Yet how could\nhe himself go to young Helston? Some men no doubt could have handled\nsuch an incident with dignity. Ashe, with his critical sense for ever\nplaying on himself and others; with the touch of moral shirking that\nbelonged to his inmost nature; and, above all, with his half-humorous,\nhalf-bitter consciousness that whoever else might be a hero, he was\nnone: Ashe, at least, could and would do nothing of the sort. That he\nshould begin now to play the tyrannous or jealous husband would make him\nridiculous both in his own eyes and other people's.\n\nAnd yet Kitty must somehow be protected from herself!... Then--as to\npolitics? Once, in talking with his mother, he had said to her that he\nwas Kitty's husband first, and a public man afterwards. Was he prepared\nnow to make the statement with the same simplicity, the same\nwhole-heartedness?\n\nInvoluntarily he moved closer to the bed and looked down on Kitty.\nLittle, delicate face!--always with something mournful and fretful in\nrepose.\n\nHe loved her surely as much as ever--ah! yes, he loved her. His whole\nnature yearned over her, as the wife of his youth, the mother of his\npoor boy. Yet, as he remembered the mood in which he had proposed to\nher, that defiance of the world and life which had possessed him when he\nhad made her marry him, he felt himself--almost with bitterness--another\nand a meaner man. No!--he was _not_ prepared to lose the world for\nher--the world of high influence and ambition upon which he had now\nentered as a conqueror. She _must_ so control herself that she did not\nruin all his hopes--which, after all, were hers--and the work he might\ndo for his country.\n\nWhat incredible perversity and caprice she had shown towards Lord\nParham! How was he to deal with it--he, William Ashe, with his ironic\ntemper and his easy standards? What could he say to her but \"Love me,\nKitty!--love yourself!--and don't be a little fool! Life might be so\namusing if you would only bridle your fancies and play the game!\"\n\nAs for loftier things, \"self-reverence, self-knowledge,\nself-control\"--duty--and the passion of high ideals--who was he to prate\nabout them? The little Dean, perhaps!--most spiritual of worldlings.\nAshe knew himself to be neither spiritual nor a hypocrite. A certain\nmeasure, a certain order and harmony in life--laughter and good-humor\nand affection--and, for the fight that makes and welds a man, those\ngreat political and social interests in the midst of which he found\nhimself--he asked no more, and with these he would have been abundantly\ncontent.\n\nHe sighed and frowned, his muscles stiffening unconsciously. Yes, for\nboth their sakes he must try and play the master with Kitty, ridiculous\nas it seemed.\n\n... He turned away, remembering his sick child--and went noiselessly to\nthe nursery. There, along the darkened passages, he found a night-nurse,\nsitting working beside a shaded lamp. The child was sleeping, and the\nreport was good. Ashe stole on tiptoe to look at him, holding his\nbreath, then returned to his dressing-room. But a faint call from Kitty\npursued him. He opened the door, and saw her sitting up in bed.\n\n\"How is he?\"\n\nShe was hardly awake, but her expression struck him as very wild and\npiteous. He went to her and took her in his arms.\n\n\"Sleeping quietly, darling--so must you!\"\n\nShe sank back on her pillows, his arm still round her.\n\n\"I was there an hour ago,\" she murmured. \"I shall soon wake up--\"\n\nBut for the moment she was asleep again, her fair head lying against his\nshoulder. He sat down beside her, supporting her. Suddenly, as he looked\ndown upon her with mingled passion, tenderness, and pain, a sharp\nperception assailed him. How thin she was--a mere feather's weight! The\nface was smaller than ever--the hands skin and bone! Margaret French had\nonce or twice bade him notice this, had spoken with anxiety. He bent\nover his wife and observed her attentively. It was merely the effect of\na hot summer, surely, and of a constant nervous fatigue? He would take\nher abroad for a fortnight in September, if his official work would let\nhim, and perhaps leave her in north Italy, or Switzerland, with Margaret\nFrench.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great day was half-way through, and the throng in Haggart Park and\ngrounds was at its height. A flower-show in the morning; then a tenants'\ndinner with a speech from Ashe; and now, in a marquee erected for the\noccasion, Lord Parham was addressing his supporters in the county.\nAround him on the platform sat the Whig gentry, the Radical\nmanufacturers, the town wire-pullers and local agents on whom a great\nparty depended; in front of him stretched a crowded meeting drawn in\nalmost equal parts from the coal-mining districts to the north of\nHaggart and from the agricultural districts to the south....\n\nThe August air was stifling; perspiration shone on the broad brows and\ncheeks of the farmers sitting in the front half of the audience; Lord\nParham's gray face was almost white; his harsh voice labored against the\nacoustic difficulties of the tent; effort and heat, discomfort and ennui\nbreathed from the packed benches, and from the short-necked,\nlarge-headed figure of the Premier.\n\nAshe sat to the speaker's right, outwardly attentive, inwardly ashamed\nof his party and his chief. He himself belonged to a new generation, for\nwhom formul\u00c3\u00a6 that had satisfied their fathers were empty and dead. But\nwith these formulas Lord Parham was stuffed. A man of average intriguing\nability, he had been raised, at a moment of transition, to the place he\nheld, by a consummate command of all the meaner arts of compromise and\nmanagement, no less than by an invaluable power of playing to the\ngallery. He led a party who despised him--and he complacently imagined\nthat he was the party. His speech on this occasion bristled with\nhimself, and had, in truth, no other substance; the I's swarmed out upon\nthe audience like wasps.\n\nAshe groaned in spirit, \"We have the ideas,\" he thought, \"but they are\ndamned little good to us--it is the Tories who have the men! Ye gods!\nmust we all talk like this at last?\"...\n\nSuddenly, on the other side of the platform, behind Lord Parham, he\nnoticed that Kitty and Eddie Helston were exchanging signs. Kitty drew\nout a tablet, wrote upon it, and, leaning over some white-frocked\nchildren of the Lord Lieutenant who sat behind her, handed the torn leaf\nto Helston. But from some clumsiness he let it drop; at the moment a\ndoor opened at the back of the platform, and the leaf, caught by the\ndraught, was blown back across the bench where Kitty and the house-party\nwere sitting, and fluttered down to a resting-place on the piece of red\nbaize wheron Lord Parham was standing--close beside his left foot.\n\nAshe saw Kitty's start of dismay, her scarlet flush, her involuntary\nmovement. But Lord Parham had started on his peroration. The rustics\ngaped, the gentry sat expressionless, the reporters toiled after the\ngreat man. Kitty all the time kept her eyes fixed on the little white\npaper; Ashe no less. Between him and Lord Parham there was first the\nLord Lieutenant, a portly man, very blind and extremely deaf--then a\ntable with a Liberal peer behind it for chairman.\n\nLord Parham had resumed his seat. The tent was shaken with cheers, and\nthe smiling chairman had risen.\n\n\"Can you ask Lord Parham to hand me on that paper on the floor,\" said\nAshe, in the ear of the Lord Lieutenant, \"it seems to have dropped from\nmy portfolio.\"\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant, bending backward behind the chairman as the next\nspeaker rose, tried to attract Lord Parham's attention. Eddie Helston\nwas, at the same time, endeavoring to make his way forward through the\ncrowded seats behind the Prime Minister.\n\nMeanwhile Lord Parham had perceived the paper, raised it, and adjusted\nhis spectacles. He thought it was a communication from the audience--a\nquestion, perhaps, that he was expected to answer.\n\n\"Lord Parham!\" cried the Lord Lieutenant again, \"would you--\"\n\n\"Silence, please! Speak up!\"--from the audience, who had so far failed\nto catch a word of what the new speaker was saying.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter? You really can't get through here!\" said a\ngray-haired dowager crossly to Eddie Helston.\n\nLord Parham looked at the paper in mystification. It contained these\nwords:\n\n\"Hope you've been counting the 'I's.' I make it fifty-seven.--K.\"\n\nAnd in the corner of the paper a thumb-nail sketch of himself,\nperorating, with a garland of capital I's round his neck.\n\nThe Premier's face became brick-red, then gray again. He folded up the\npaper and put it in his waistcoat-pocket.\n\nThe meeting had broken up. For the common herd, it was to be followed by\nsports in the park and refreshments in big tents. For the gentry, Lady\nKitty had a garden-party to which Royalty was coming. And as her guests\nstreamed out of the marquee, Lord Parham approached his hostess.\n\n\"I think this belongs to you, Lady Kitty.\" And taking from his pocket a\nfolded slip of paper he offered it to her.\n\nKitty looked at him. Her color was high, her eyes sparkled.\n\n\"Nothing to do with me!\" she said, gayly, as she glanced at it. \"But\nI'll look for the owner.\"\n\n\"Sorry to give you the trouble,\" said Lord Parham, with a ceremonious\ninclination. Then, turning to Ashe, he remarked that he was extremely\ntired--worn out, in fact--and would ask his host's leave to desert the\ngarden-party while he attended to some most important letters. Ashe\noffered to escort him to the house. \"On the contrary, look after your\nguests,\" said the Premier, dryly, and, beckoning to the Liberal peer who\nhad been his chairman, he engaged him in conversation, and the two\npresently vanished through a window open to the terrace.\n\nKitty had been joined meanwhile by Eddie Helston, and the two stood\ntalking together, a flushed, excited pair. Ashe overtook them.\n\n\"May I speak to you a moment, Kitty?\"\n\nEddie Helston glanced at the fine form and stiffened bearing of his\nhost, understood that his presence counted for something in the\nannoyance of Ashe's expression, and departed abashed.\n\n\"I should like to see that paper, Kitty, if you don't mind.\"\n\nHis frown and straightened lip brought fresh wildness into Kitty's\nexpression.\n\n\"It is my property.\" She kept one hand behind her.\n\n\"I heard you just disavow that.\"\n\nKitty laughed angrily.\n\n\"Yes--that's the worst of Lord Parham--one has to tell so many lies for\nhis _beaux yeux_!\"\n\n\"You must give it me, please,\" said Ashe, quietly. \"I ought to know\nwhere I am with Lord Parham. He is clearly bitterly offended--by\nsomething, and I shall have to apologize.\"\n\nKitty breathed fast.\n\n\"Well, don't let's quarrel before the county!\" she said, as she turned\naside into a shrubbery walk edged by clipped yews and hidden from the\nbig lawn. There she paused and confronted him. \"How did you know I wrote\nit?\"\n\n\"I saw you write it and throw it.\"\n\nHe stretched out his hand. Kitty hesitated, then slowly unclosed her\nown, and held out the small, white palm on which lay the crumpled slip.\n\nAshe read it and tore it up.\n\n\"That game, Kitty, was hardly worth the candle!\"\n\n\"It was a perfectly harmless remark--and only meant for Eddie! Any one\nelse than Lord Parham would have laughed. _Then_ I might have begged his\npardon.\"\n\n\"It is what you ought to do now,\" said Ashe. \"A little note from you,\nKitty--you could write it to perfection--\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Kitty, hastily, locking her hands behind her.\n\n\"You prefer to have failed in hospitality and manners,\" he said,\nbitterly. \"Well, I'm afraid if you don't feel any disgrace in it I do.\nLord Parham in our _guest_!\"\n\nAnd Ashe turned on his heel and would have left her, when Kitty caught\nhim by the arm.\n\n\"William!\"\n\nShe had grown very pale.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You've never spoken to me like that before, William--never! But--as I\ntold you long ago, you can stop it all if you like--in a moment.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, Kitty--but we mustn't stay arguing here any\nlonger--\"\n\n\"No!--but--don't you remember? I told you, you can always send me away.\nThen I shouldn't be putting spokes in your wheel.\"\n\n\"I don't deny,\" said Ashe, slowly, \"it might be wisest if, next spring,\nyou stayed here, for part at least of the session--or abroad. It is\ncertainly difficult carrying on politics under these conditions. I\ncould, of course, come backward and forward--\"\n\nKitty's brown eyes that were fixed upon his face wavered a little, and\nshe grew even whiter.\n\n\"Very well. That would be a kind of separation, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"There would be no need to call it by any such name. Oh! Kitty!\" cried\nAshe, \"why can't you behave like a reasonable woman?\"\n\n\"Separation,\" she repeated, steadily. \"I know that's what your mother\nwants.\"\n\nA wave of sound reached them amid the green shadow of the yews. The\ncheers that heralded Royalty had begun.\n\n\"Come!\" said Kitty.\n\nAnd she flew across the grass, reaching her place by the central tent\njust as the Royalties drove up.\n\nThe Prime Minister sulked in-doors; and Kitty, with the most engaging\nsmiles, made his apologies. The heat--the fatigue of the speech--a\ncrushing headache, and a doctor's order!--he begged their Royal\nHighnesses to excuse him. The Royal Highnesses were at first astonished,\ninclined, perhaps, to take offence. But the party was so agreeable, and\nLady Kitty so charming a hostess, that the Premier's absence was soon\nforgotten, and as the day cooled to a delicious evening, and the most\ncostly bands from town discoursed a melting music, as garlanded boats\nappeared upon the river inviting passengers, and, with the dusk,\nfireworks began to ascend from a little hill; as the trees shone green\nand silver and rose-color in the Bengal lights, and amid the sweeping\nclouds of smoke the wide stretches of the park, the close-packed groups\nof human beings, appeared and vanished like the country and creatures of\na dream--the success of Lady Kitty's f\u00c3\u00aate, the fame of her gayety and\nher beauty, filled the air. She flashed hither and thither, in a dress\nembroidered with wild roses and a hat festooned with them--attended\nalways by Eddie Helston, by various curates who cherished a hopeless\nattachment to her, and by a fat German grand-duke, who had come in the\nwake of the Royalties.\n\nHer cleverness, her resource, her organizing power were lauded to the\nskies, Royalty was gracious, and the grand-duke resentfully asked an\naide-de-camp on the way home why he had not been informed that such a\npretty person awaited him.\n\n\"I should den haf looked beforehand--as vel as tinking behind,\" said the\ngrand-duke, as he wrapped himself sentimentally in his military cloak,\nto meditate on Lady Kitty's brown eyes.\n\nMeanwhile Lord Parham remained closeted in his sitting-room with his\nsecretary. Ashe tried to gain admittance, but in vain. Lord Parham\npleaded great fatigue and his letters; and asked for a _Bradshaw_.\n\n\"His lordship has inquired if there is a train to-night,\" said the\nlittle secretary, evidently much flustered.\n\nAshe protested. And, indeed, as it turned out, there was no train worth\nthe taking. Then Lord Parham sent a message that he hoped to appear at\ndinner.\n\nKitty locked her door while she was dressing, and Ashe, whose mind was a\nconfusion of many feelings--anger, compunction, and that fascination\nwhich in her brilliant moods she exercised over him no less than over\nothers--could get no speech with her.\n\nThey met on the threshold of the child's room, she coming out, he going\nin. But she wrenched herself from him and would say nothing. The report\nof the little boy was good; he smiled at his father, and Ashe felt a\ncooling balm in the touch of his soft hands and lips. He descended--in a\nmore philosophical mind; inclined, at any rate, to \"damn\" Lord Parham.\nWhat a fool the man must be! Why couldn't he have taken it with a laugh,\nand so turned the tables on Kitty?\n\nWas there any good to be got out of apologizing? Ashe supposed he must\nattempt it some time that night. A precious awkward business! But\nrelations had got to be restored somehow.\n\nLady Tranmore overtook him on the way down-stairs. In the press of the\nafternoon they had hardly seen each other.\n\n\"What is really wrong with Lord Parham, William?\" she asked him,\nanxiously. Ashe hesitated, then whispered a word or two in her ear,\nbegging her to keep the great man in play for the evening. He was to\ntake her in, while Kitty would fall to the Bishop of the diocese.\n\n\"She gets on perfectly with the clergy,\" said Lady Tranmore, with an\ninvoluntary sigh. Then, as the sense of humor was strong in both, they\nlaughed. But it was a chilly and perfunctory laughter.\n\nThey had no sooner passed into the main hall than Kitty came running\ndown-stairs, with a large packet in her hand.\n\n\"Mr. Darrell!\"\n\n\"At your service!\" said Darrell, emerging from the shadows of one of the\nbroad corridors of the ground-floor.\n\n\"Take it, please!\" said Kitty, panting a little, as she gave the packet\ninto his hands. \"If I look at it any more, I _might_ burn it!\"\n\n\"Suppose you do!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Kitty, pushing the bundle away, as he laughingly tendered\nit. \"I must see what happens!\"\n\n\"Is the gap filled?\"\n\nShe laid her finger on her lips. Her eyes danced. Then she hurried on to\nthe drawing-room.\n\nWhether it were the soothing presence of the clergy or no, certainly\nKitty was no less triumphant at dinner than she had been in the\nafternoon. The chorus of fun and pleasure that surrounded her, while he\nhimself sat, tired and bored, between Lady Edith Manley and Lady\nTranmore, did but make her offence the greater in the eyes of Lord\nParham. He had so far buried it in a complete and magnificent silence.\nThe meeting between him and his hostess before dinner had been marked by\na strict conformity to all the rules. Kitty had inquired after his\nheadache; Lord Parham expressed his regrets that he had missed so\nbrilliant a party; and Kitty, flirting her fan, invented messages from\nthe Royalties which, as most of those present knew, the Royalties had\nbeen far too well amused to think of. Then after this _pas seul_, in the\npresence of the crowded drawing-room, had been duly executed, Kitty\nretired to her Bishop, and Lord Parham led forth Lady Tranmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What a lovely moon!\" said Lady Edith Manley to the Dean. \"It makes even\nthis house look romantic.\"\n\nThey were walking outside the drawing-room windows, on a terrace which\nwas, indeed, the only feature of the Haggart fa\u00c3\u00a7ade which possessed some\narchitectural interest. A low balustrade of terra-cotta, copied from a\nfamous Italian villa, ran round it, broken by large terra-cotta pots now\nfilled with orange-trees. Here and there between the orange-trees were\nstatues transported from Naples in the late eighteenth century by a\nformer Lord Tranmore. There was a Ceres and a Diana, a Vestal Virgin, an\nAthlete, and an Antinous, now brought into strange companionship under\nthe windows of this ugly English house. Chipped and blackened as they\nwere, and, to begin with, of a mere decorative importance, they still\nbreathed into the English evening a note of Italy or Greece, of things\nlovely and immortal. The lamps in the sitting-rooms streamed out through\nthe widely opened windows upon the terrace, checkering the marble\nfigures, which now emerged sharply in the light, and now withdrew in the\ngloom; while at one point they shone plainly upon an empty pedestal\nbefore which the Dean and his companion paused.\n\nThe Dean looked at the inscription. \"What a pity! This once held a\nstatue of Hebe holding a torch. It was struck by lightning fifty years\nago.\"\n\n\"Lady Kitty might stand for her to-night,\" said Edith Manley.\n\nFor Kitty, the capricious, had appeared at dinner in a _quasi_-Greek\ndress, white, soft, and flowing, without an ornament. The Dean\nacquiesced, but rather sadly.\n\n\"I wish she had the bloom of Hebe! My dear Lady Edith, our hostess looks\n_ill_!\"\n\n\"Does she? I can't tell--I admire her so!\" said the woman beside him,\nupon whose charming eyes some fairy had breathed kindness and optimism\nfrom her cradle.\n\n\"_Ouf!_\" cried Kitty, as she sprang across the sill of the window behind\nthem. \"They're _all_ gone! The Bishop wishes me to become a\nvice-president of the Women's Diocesan Association. And I've promised\nthree curates to open bazaars. _Ah, mon Dieu!_\" She raised her white\narms with a wild gesture, and then beckoned to Eddie Helston, who was\nclose beside her.\n\n\"Shall we try our dance?\"\n\nThe young men of the house, a group of young guardsmen and diplomats,\ngathered round, laughing and clapping. Kitty's dancing had become famous\nduring the winter as one of her many extravagances. She no longer\nrecited; literature bored her; motion was the only poetry. So she had\nbeen carefully instructed by a _danseuse_ from the Opera, and in many\npoints, so the enthusiasts declared, had bettered her instructions. She\nwas now in love with a tempestuous Spanish dance, taught her by a gypsy\n_se\u00c3\u00b1orita_ who had been one of the sensations of the London season. It\nrequired a partner, and she had been practising it with young Helston,\nfor several mornings past, in the empty ballroom. Helston had spread its\npraises abroad; and all Haggart desired to see it.\n\n\"There!\" said Kitty, pointing her partner to a particular spot on the\nterrace. \"I think that will do. Where are the castanets, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Kitty!\" said a voice behind her. Ashe emerged from the drawing-room.\n\n\"Kitty, please! It is nearly midnight. Everybody is tired--and you\nyourself must be worn out! Say good-night, and let us all go to bed.\"\n\nShe turned. Willam's voice was low, but peremptory. She shook back her\nhair from her temples and neck, with the gesture he had learned to\ndread.\n\n\"Nobody's tired--and nobody wants to go to bed. Please stand out of the\nway, William. I want plenty of room for my steps.\"\n\nAnd she began pirouetting, as though to try the capacities of the space,\nhumming to herself.\n\n\"Helston--this must be, please, for another night,\" said Ashe,\nresolutely, in the young man's ear. \"Lady Kitty is much too tired.\"\nThen to Lady Edith, and the Dean--\"Lady Edith, it would be very kind of\nyou to persuade my wife to go to bed. She never knows when she is done!\"\n\nLady Edith warmly acquiesced, and, hurrying up to Kitty, she tried to\npersuade her in soft, caressing phrases.\n\n\"I stand on my rights!\" said the Dean, following her. \"If my hostess is\nused up to-night, there'll be no hostess for me to-morrow.\"\n\nKitty looked at them all, silent--her head bending forward, a curious\n_m\u00c3\u00a9chant_ look in the eyes that shone beneath the slightly frowning\nbrows. Meanwhile, by her previous order, a footman had brought out two\nsilver lamps and placed them on a small table a little way behind her.\nWhether it was from some instinctive sense of the beauty of the small\nfigure in the slender, floating dress under the deep blue of the night\nsky and amid the romantic shadows and lights of the terrace--or from\nsome divination of things significant and hidden--it would be hard to\nsay; but the group of spectators had fallen back a little from Kitty, so\nthat she stood alone, a picture lit from the left by the lamps just\nbrought in.\n\nThe Dean looked at her--troubled by her wild aspect and the evident\nconflict between her and Ashe. Then an idea flashed into his mind,\nfilled always, like that of an innocent child, with the images of poetry\nand romance.\n\n\"One moment!\" he said, raising his hand. \"Lady Kitty, you spoil us!\nAfter amusing us all day, now you would dance for us all night. But your\nguests won't let you! We love you too well, and we want a bit of you\nleft for to-morrow. Never mind! You offered us a dance--you bring us a\nvision--and a poem!--Friends!\"\n\nHe turned to those crowding round him, his white hair glistening in the\nlamplight, his delicate face, so old and yet so eager, the smile on his\nkind lips, and all the details of his Dean's dress--apron and\nknee-breeches, slender legs and silver buckles--thrown out in sharp\nrelief upon the dark....\n\n\"Friends! you see this pedestal. Once Hebe, the cup-bearer of the gods,\nstood there. Then--ungrateful Zeus smote her, and she fell! But the\nHours and the Graces bore her safe away, into a golden land, and now\nthey bring her back again. Behold her!--Hebe reborn!\"\n\nHe bowed, his courtly hand upon his breast, and a wave of laughter and\napplause ran through the young group round him as their eyes turned from\nthe speaker to the exquisite figure of Kitty. Lady Edith smiled kindly,\nclapping her soft hands. Mrs. Winston, the Dean's wife, had eyes only\nfor the Dean. In the background Lady Tranmore watched every phase of\nKitty's looks, and Lord Grosville walked back into the dining-room,\ngrowling unutterable things to Darrell as he passed.\n\nKitty raised her head to reply. But the Dean checked her. Advancing a\nstep or two, he saluted her again--profoundly.\n\n\"Dear Lady Kitty!--dear bringer of light and ambrosia!--rest, and\ngood-night! Your guests thank you by me, with all their hearts. You have\nbeen the life of their day, the spirit of their mirth. Good-night to\nHebe!--and three cheers for Lady Kitty!\"\n\nEddie Helston led them, and they rang against the old house. Kitty with\na fluttering smile kissed her hand for thanks, and the Dean saw her look\nround--dart a swift glance at Ashe. He stood against the window-frame,\nin shadow, motionless, his arms folded.\n\nThen suddenly Kitty sprang forward.\n\n\"Give me that lamp!\" she said to the young footman behind her.\n\nAnd in a second she had leaped upon the low wall of the terrace and on\nthe vacant pedestal. The lad to whom she had spoken lost his head and\nobeyed her. He raised the lamp. She stooped and took it. Ashe, who was\nnow standing in the open window with his back to the terrace, turned\nround, saw, and rushed forward.\n\n\"Kitty!--put it down!\"\n\n\"Lady Kitty!\" cried the Dean, in dismay, while all behind him held their\nbreath.\n\n\"Stand back!\" said Kitty, \"or I shall drop it!\" She held up the lamp,\nstraight and steady. Ashe paused--in an agony of doubt what to do, his\nwhole soul concentrated on the slender arm and on the brightly burning\nlamp.\n\n\"If you make me speeches,\" said Kitty, \"I must reply, mustn't I? (Keep\nback, William!--I'm all right.) Hebe thanks you, please--_mille fois_!\nShe herself hasn't been happy--and she's afraid she hasn't been good!\n_N'importe!_ It's all done--and finished. The play's over!--and the\nlights go out!\"\n\nShe waved the lamp above her head.\n\n\"Kitty! for God's sake!\" cried Ashe, rushing to her.\n\n\"She is mad!\" said Lord Parham, standing at the back. \"I always knew\nit!\"\n\nThe other spectators passed through a second of anguish. The bright\nfigure on the pedestal wavered; one moment, and it seemed as though the\nlamp must descend crashing upon the head and neck and the white dress\nbeneath it; the next, it had fallen from Kitty's hand--fallen away from\nher--wide and safe--into the depths of the garden below. A flash of wild\nlight rose from the burning oil and from the dry shrubs amid which it\nfell. Kitty, meanwhile, swayed--and dropped--heavily--unconscious--into\nWilliam Ashe's arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty barely recovered life and sense during the night that followed.\nAnd while she was still unconscious her boy passed away. The poor babe,\nall ignorant of the straits in which his mother lay, was seized with\nconvulsions in the dawn, and gave up his frail life gathered to his\nfather's breast.\n\nSome ten weeks later, towards the end of October, society knew that the\nHome Secretary and Lady Kitty had started for Italy--bound first of all\nfor Venice. It was said that Lady Kitty was a wreck, and that it was\ndoubtful whether she would ever recover the sudden and tragic death of\nher only child.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\nSTORM\n\n     \"Myself, arch-traitor to myself;\n     My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe,\n     My clog whatever road I go.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\n\"'Among the numerous daubs with which Tintoret, to his everlasting\nshame, has covered this church--'\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!--what does the man mean?--or is he talking of another\nchurch?\" said Ashe, raising his head and looking in bewilderment, first\nat the magnificent Tintoret in front of him, and then at the lines he\nhad just been reading.\n\n\"William!\" cried Kitty, \"_do_ put that fool down and come here; one sees\nit splendidly!\"\n\nShe was standing in one of the choir-stalls of San Giorgio Maggiore,\nsomewhat raised above the point where Ashe had been studying his German\nhand-book.\n\n\"My dear, if this man doesn't know, who does!\" cried Ashe, flourishing\nhis volume in front of him as he obeyed her.\n\n\"'Dans le royaume des aveugles,'\" said Kitty, contemptuously. \"As if any\nGerman could even begin to understand Tintoret! But--don't talk!\"\n\nAnd clasping both hands round Ashe's arm, she stood leaning heavily upon\nhim, her whole soul gazing from the eyes she turned upon the picture,\nher lips quivering, as though, from some physical weakness, she could\nonly just hold back the tears with which, indeed, the face was charged.\n\nShe and Ashe were looking at that \"Last Supper\" of Tintoret's which\nhangs in the choir of San Giorgio Maggiore at Venice.\n\nIt is a picture dear to all lovers of Tintoret, breathing in every line\nand group the passionate and mystical fancy of the master.\n\nThe scene passes, it will be remembered, in what seems to be the\nspacious guest-chamber of an inn. The Lord and His disciples are\ngathered round the last sacred meal of the Old Covenant, the first of\nthe New. On the left, a long table stretches from the spectator into the\ndepths of the picture; the disciples are ranged along one side of it;\nand on the other sits Judas, solitary and accursed. The young Christ has\nrisen; He holds the bread in His lifted hands and is about to give it to\nthe beloved disciple, while Peter beyond, rising from his seat in his\neagerness, presses forward to claim his own part in the Lord's body.\n\nThe action of the Christ has in it a very ecstasy of giving; the bending\nform, indeed, is love itself, yearning and triumphant. This is further\nexpressed in the light which streams from the head of the Lord, playing\nupon the long line of faces, illuminating the vehement gesture of Peter,\nthe adoring and radiant silence of St. John--and striking even to the\nfarthest corners of the room, upon a woman, a child, a playing dog.\nMeanwhile, from the hanging lamps above the supper-party there glows\nanother and more earthly light, mingled with fumes of smoke which darken\nthe upper air. But such is the power of the divine figure that from this\nvery darkness breaks adoration. The smoke-wreaths change under the\ngazer's eye into hovering angels, who float round the head of the\nSaviour, and look down with awe upon the first Eucharist; while the\nlamp-light, interpenetrated by the glory which issues from the Lord,\nsearches every face and fold and surface, displays the figures of the\nserving men and women in the background, shines on the household stuff,\nthe vases and plates, the black and white of the marble floor, the beams\nof the old Venetian ceiling. Everywhere the double ray, the two-fold\nmagic! Steeped in these \"majesties of light,\" the immortal scene lives\nupon the quiet wall. Year after year the slender, thought-worn Christ\nraises His hands of blessing; the disciples strain towards Him; the\nangels issue from the darkness; the friendly domestic life, happy,\nnatural, unconscious, frames the divine mystery. And among those who\ncome to look there are, from time to time, men and women who draw from\nit that restlessness of vague emotion which Kitty felt as she hung now,\ngazing, on Ashe's arm.\n\nFor there is in it an appeal which torments them--like the winding of a\nmystic horn, on purple heights, by some approaching and unseen\nmessenger. Ineffable beauty, offering itself--and in the human soul, the\neternal human discord: what else makes the poignancy of art--the passion\nof poetry?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's enough!\" said Kitty, at last, turning abruptly away.\n\n\"You like it?\" said Ashe, softly, detaining her, while he pressed the\nlittle hand upon his arm. His heart was filled with a great pity for his\nwife in these days.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" was Kitty's impatient reply.\n\n\"It haunts me. There's still another to see--in a chapel. The\nsacristan's making signs to us.\"\n\n\"Is there?\" Ashe stifled a yawn. He asked Margaret French, who had come\nup with them, whether Kitty had not had quite enough sight-seeing. He\nhimself must go to the Piazza, and get the news before dinner. As an\nEnglish cabinet minister, he had been admitted to the best club of the\nVenice residents. Telegrams were to be seen there; and there was anxious\nnews from the Balkans.\n\nKitty merely insisted that she could not and would not go without her\nremaining Tintoret, and the others yielded to her at once, with that\nindulgent tenderness one shows to the wilfulness of a sick child. She\nand Margaret followed the sacristan. Ashe lingered behind in a passage\nof the church, surreptitiously reading an Italian newspaper. He had the\nordinary cultivated pleasure in pictures; but this ardor which Kitty was\nthrowing into her pursuit of Tintoret--the Wagner of painting--left him\ncold. He did not attempt to keep up with her.\n\nTwo ladies were already in the cloister chapel, with a gentleman. As\nKitty and her friend entered, these persons had just finished their\ninspection of the damaged but most beautiful \"Piet\u00c3\u00a0\" which hangs over\nthe altar, and their faces were towards the entrance.\n\n\"Maman!\" cried Kitty, in amazement.\n\nThe lady addressed started, put up a gold-rimmed eye-glass, exclaimed,\nand hurried forward.\n\nKitty and she embraced, amid a torrent of laughter and interjections\nfrom the elder lady, and then Kitty, whose pale cheeks had put on\nscarlet, turned to Margaret French.\n\n\"Margaret!--my mother, Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es.\"\n\nMiss French, who found herself greeted with effusion by the strange\nlady, saw before her a woman of fifty, marvellously preserved. Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had grown stout; so much time had claimed; but the elegant\ngray dress with its floating chiffon and lace skilfully concealed the\nfact; and for the rest, complexion, eyes, lips were still defiant of the\nyears. If it were art that had achieved it, nature still took the\ncredit; it was so finely done, the spectator could only lend himself and\nadmire. Under the pretty hat of gray tulle, whereof the strings were\ntied bonnet-fashion under the plump chin, there looked out, indeed, a\nface gay, happy, unconcerned, proof one might have thought of an\ninnocent past and a good conscience.\n\nKitty, who had drawn back a little, eyed her mother oddly.\n\n\"I thought you were in Paris. Your letter said you wouldn't be able to\nmove for weeks--\"\n\n\"_Ma ch\u00c3\u00a8re!_--_un miracle!_\" cried Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, blushing, however,\nunder her thin white veil. \"When I wrote to you, I was at death's\ndoor--wasn't I?\" She appealed to her companion, without waiting for an\nanswer. \"Then some one told me of a new doctor, and in ten days, _me\nvoici_! They insisted on my going away--this dear woman--Donna Laura\nVercelli--my daughter, Lady Kitty Ashe!--knew of an apartment here\nbelonging to some relations of hers. And here we are--charmingly\n_install\u00c3\u00a9es_!--and really _nothing_ to pay!\"--Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es\nwhispered, smiling, in Kitty's ear--\"nothing, compared to the hotels.\nI'm economizing splendidly. Laura looks after every sou. Ah! my dear\nWilliam!\"\n\nFor Ashe, puzzled by the voices within, had entered the chapel, and\nstood in his turn, open-mouthed.\n\n\"Why, we thought you were an invalid.\"\n\nFor, some three weeks before, a letter had reached him at Haggart, so\nfull of melancholy details as to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' health and\ncircumstances that even Kitty had been moved. Money had been sent;\ninquiries had been made by telegraph; and but for a hasty message of a\nmore cheerful character, received just before they started, the Ashes,\ninstead of journeying by Brussels and Cologne, would have gone by Paris\nthat Kitty might see her mother. They had intended to stop there on\ntheir way back. Ashe was not minded that Kitty should see more of Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es than necessity demanded; but on this occasion he would have\nfelt it positively brutal to make difficulties.\n\nAnd now here was this moribund lady, this forsaken of gods and men,\ndisporting herself at Venice, evidently in the pink of health and\nattired in the freshest of Paris toilettes! As he coldly shook hands,\nAshe registered an inner vow that Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' letters henceforward\nshould receive the attention they deserved.\n\nAnd beside her was her somewhat mysterious friend of London days, the\nColonel Warington who had been so familiar a figure in the gatherings of\nSt. James's Place--grown much older, almost white-haired, and as\ngentlemanly as ever. Who was the lady? Ashe was introduced, was aware of\na somewhat dark and Jewish cast of face, noticed some fine jewels, and\ncould only suppose that his mother-in-law had picked up some one to\nfinance her, and provide her with creature comforts in return for the\nsocial talents that Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es still possessed in some abundance.\nHe had more than once noticed her skill in similar devices; but, indeed,\nthey were indispensable, for while he allowed Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es one\nthousand a year, she was, it seemed, firmly determined to spend a\nminimum of three.\n\nHe and Warington looked at each other with curiosity. The bronzed face\nand honest eyes of the soldier betrayed nothing. \"Are you going to marry\nher at last?\" thought Ashe. \"Poor devil!\"\n\nMeanwhile Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es chattered away as though nothing could be\nmore natural than their meeting, or more perfect than the relations\nbetween herself and her daughter and son-in-law.\n\nAs they all strolled down the church she looked keenly at Kitty.\n\n\"My dear child, how ill you look!--and your mourning! Ah, yes, of\ncourse!\"--she bit her lip--\"I remember--the poor, poor boy--\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Kitty, hastily. \"I got your letter--thank you very\nmuch. Where are you staying? We've got rooms on the Grand Canal.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Kitty!\" cried Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--\"I was so sorry for you!\"\n\n\"Were you?\" said Kitty, under her breath. \"Then, please, never speak of\nhim to me again!\"\n\nStartled and offended, Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es looked at her daughter. But what\nshe saw disarmed her. For once even she felt something like the pang of\na mother. \"You're _dreadfully_ thin, Kitty!\"\n\nKitty frowned with annoyance.\n\n\"It's not my fault,\" she said, pettishly. \"I live on cream, and it's no\ngood. Of course, I know I'm an object and a scarecrow; but I'd rather\npeople didn't tell me.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, _ch\u00c3\u00a9re enfant!_ You're much prettier than you ever\nwere.\"\n\nA wild and fugitive radiance swept across the face beside her.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Kitty, smiling. \"That's all right! If I had died it\nwouldn't matter, of course. But--\"\n\n\"Died! What do you mean, Kitty?\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, in bewilderment.\n\"When William wrote to me I thought he meant you had overtired\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, the doctors said it was touch and go,\" said Kitty,\nindifferently. \"But, of course, it wasn't. I'm much too tough. And then\nthey fussed about one's heart. And that's all nonsense, too. I couldn't\ndie if I tried.\"\n\nBut Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es pondered--the bright, intermittent color, the\nemaciation, the hollowness of the eyes. The effect, so far, was to add\nto Kitty's natural distinction, to give, rather, a touch of pathos to a\nface which even in its wildest mirth had in it something alien and\nremote. But she, too, reflected that a little more, a very little more,\nand--in a night--the face would have dropped its beauty, as a rose its\npetals.\n\nThe group stood talking awhile on the steps outside the church. Kitty\nand her mother exchanged addresses, Donna Laura opened her mouth once or\ntwice, and produced a few contorted smiles for Kitty's benefit, while\nColonel Warington tipped the sacristan, found the gondolier, and studied\nthe guide-book.\n\nAs Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es stepped into her gondola, assisted by him, she\ntapped him on the arm.\n\n\"Are you coming, Markham?\"\n\nThe low voice was pitched in a very intimate note. Kitty turned with a\nstart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"A casa!\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, and she and her friend made for one of\nthe canals that pierce the Zattere, while Colonel Warington went off for\na walk along the Giudecca.\n\nKitty and Ashe bade their gondoliers take them to the Piazzetta, and\npresently they were gliding across waters of flame and silver, where the\nwhite front and red campanile of San Giorgio--now blazing under the\nsunset--mirrored themselves in the lagoon. The autumn evening was fresh\nand gay. A light breeze was on the water; lights that only Venice knows\nshone on the tawny sails of fishing-boats making for the Lido, on the\nwhite sides of an English yacht, on the burnished prows of the gondolas,\non the warm reddish-white of the Ducal Palace. The air blowing from the\nAdriatic breathed into their faces the strength of the sea; and in the\nfar distance, above that line of buildings where lies the heart of\nVenice, the high ghosts of the Friulian Alps glimmered amid the sweeping\nregiments and purple shadows of the land-hurrying clouds.\n\n\"This does you good, darling!\" said Ashe, stooping down to look into his\nwife's face, as she nestled beside him on the soft cushions of the\ngondola.\n\nKitty gave him a slight smile, then said, with a furrowed brow:\n\n\"Who could ever have thought we should find maman here!\"\n\n\"Don't have her on your mind!\" said Ashe, with some sharpness. \"I can't\nhave anything worrying you.\"\n\nShe slipped her hand into his.\n\n\"Is that man going to marry her--at last? She called him 'Markham.'\nThat's new.\"\n\n\"Looks rather like it,\" said Ashe. \"Then _he'll_ have to look after the\ndebts!\"\n\nThey began to piece together what they knew of Colonel Warington and his\nrelation to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es. It was not much. But Ashe believed that\noriginally Warington had not been in love with her at all. There had\nbeen a love-affair between her and Warington's younger brother, a smart\nartillery officer, when she was the widowed Lady Blackwater. She had\nbehaved with more heart and scruple than she had generally been known to\ndo in these matters, and the young officer adored her--hoped, indeed, to\nmarry her. But he was called on--in Paris--to fight a duel on her\naccount, and was killed. Before fighting, he had commended Lady\nBlackwater to the care of his much older brother, also a soldier,\nbetween whom and himself there existed a rare and passionate devotion;\nand ever since the poor lad's death, Markham Warington had been the\nfriend and quasi-guardian of the lady--through her second marriage,\nthrough the checkered years of her existence in London, and now through\nthe later years of her residence on the Continent, a residence forced\nupon her by her agreement with the Tranmores. Again and again he had\nsaved her from bankruptcy, or from some worse scandal which would have\nwrecked the last remnants of her fame.\n\nBut, all the time, he was himself bound by strong ties of gratitude and\naffection to an elder sister who had brought him up, with whom he lived\nin Scotland during half the year. And this stout Puritan lady detested\nthe very name of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\n\"But she's dead,\" said Ashe. \"I remember noticing her death in the\n_Times_ some three months ago. That, of course, explains it. Now he's\nfree to marry.\"\n\n\"And so maman will settle down, and be happy ever afterwards!\" said\nKitty, with a sarcastic lifting of the brow. \"Why should anybody be\ngood?\"\n\nThe bitterness of her look struck Ashe disagreeably. That any child\nshould speak so of a mother was a tragic and sinister thing. But he was\nwell aware of the causes.\n\n\"Were you very unhappy when you were a child, Kitty?\" He pressed the\nhand he held.\n\n\"No,\" said Kitty, shortly. \"I'm too like maman. I suppose, really, at\nbottom, I liked all the debts, and the excitement, and the shady\npeople!\"\n\n\"That wasn't the impression you gave me, in the first days of our\nacquaintance!\" said Ashe, laughing.\n\n\"Oh, then I was grown up--and there were drawbacks. But I'm made of the\nsame stuff as maman,\" she said, obstinately--\"except that I can't tell\nso many fibs. That's really why we didn't get on.\"\n\nHer brown eyes held him with that strange, unspoken defiance it seemed\nso often beyond her power to hide. It was like the fluttering of some\ncaged thing hungering for it knows not what. Then, as they scanned the\npatient good-temper of his face, they melted; and her little fingers\nsqueezed his; while Margaret French kept her eyes fixed on the two\ncolumns of the Piazzetta.\n\n\"How strange to find her here!\" said Kitty, under her breath. \"Now, if\nit had been Alice--my sister Alice!\"\n\nWilliam nodded. It had been known to them for some time that Lady Alice\nWensleydale, to whom Italy had become a second country, had settled in a\nvilla near Treviso, where she occupied herself with a lace school for\nwomen and girls.\n\nThe mention of her sister threw Kitty into what seemed to be a\ndisagreeable reverie. The flush brought by the sea-wind faded. Ashe\nlooked at her with anxiety.\n\n\"You have done too much, Kitty--as usual!\"\n\nHis voice was almost angry.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"What does it matter? You know very well it would be much better for you\nif--\"\n\n\"If what?\"\n\n\"If I followed Harry.\" The words were just breathed, and her eyes shrank\nfrom meeting his. Ashe, on the other hand, turned and looked at her\nsteadily.\n\n\"Are you quite determined I sha'n't get _any_ joy out of my holiday?\"\n\nShe shook her head uncertainly. Then, almost immediately, she began to\nchatter to Margaret French about the sights of the lagoon, with her\nnatural trenchancy and fun. But her hand, hidden under the folds of her\nblack cloak, still clung to William's.\n\n\"It is her illness,\" he said to himself, \"and the loss of the child.\"\n\nAnd at the remembrance of his little son, a wave of sore yearning filled\nhis own heart. Deep under the occupations and interests of the mind lay\nthis passionate regret, and at any moment of pause or silence its\n\"buried life\" arose and seized him. But he was a busy politician,\nabsorbed even in these days of holiday by the questions and problems of\nthe hour. And Kitty was a delicate woman--with no defence against the\ntorture of grief.\n\nHe thought of those first days after the child's death, when in spite of\nthe urgency of the doctors it had been impossible to keep the news from\nKitty; of the ghastly effect of it upon nerves and brain already\nimperilled by causes only half intelligible; of those sudden flights\nfrom her nurses, when the days of convalescence began, to the child's\nroom, and, later, to his grave. There was stinging pain in these\nrecollections. Nor was he, in truth, much reassured by his wife's more\nrecent state. It was impossible, indeed, that he should give it the same\nconstant thought as a woman might--or a man of another and more\nemotional type. At this moment, perhaps, he had literally no _time_ for\nthe subtleties of introspective feeling, even had his temperament\ninclined him to them, which was, in truth, not the case. He knew that\nKitty had suddenly and resolutely ceased to talk about the boy, had\nthrown herself with the old energy into new pursuits, and, since she\ncame to Venice in particular, had shown a feverish desire to fill every\nhour with movement and sight-seeing.\n\nBut was she, in truth, much better--in body or soul?--poor child! The\ndoctors had explained her illness as nervous collapse, pointing back to\na long preceding period of overstrain and excitement. There had been\nsuspicions of tubercular mischief, but no precise test was then at\ncommand; and as Kitty had improved with rest and feeding the idea had\nbeen abandoned. But Ashe was still haunted by it, though quite\nready--being a natural optimist--to escape from it, and all other\nincurable anxieties, as soon as Kitty herself should give the signal.\n\nAs to the moral difficulties and worries of those months at Haggart,\nAshe remembered them as little as might be. Kitty's illness, indeed, had\nshown itself in more directions than one, as an amending and appeasing\nfact. Even Lord Parham had been moved to compassion and kindness by the\nimmediate results of that horrible scene on the terrace. His\nleave-taking from Ashe on the morning afterwards had been almost\ncordial--almost intimate. And as to Lady Tranmore, whenever she had been\nable to leave her paralyzed husband she had been with Kitty, nursing her\nwith affectionate wisdom night and day. While on the other members of\nthe Haggart party the sheer pity of Kitty's condition had worked with\nsurprising force. Lord Grosville had actually made his wife offer\nGrosville Park for Kitty's convalescence--Kitty got her first laugh out\nof the proposal. The Dean had journeyed several times from his distant\ncathedral town, to see and sit with Kitty; Eddie Helston's flowers had\nbeen almost a nuisance; Mrs. Alcot had shown herself quite soft and\nhuman.\n\nThe effect, indeed, of this general sympathy on Lord Parham's relations\nto the chief member of his cabinet had been but small and passing. Ashe\ndisliked and distrusted him more than ever; and whatever might have\nhappened to the Premier's resentment of a particular offence, there\ncould be no doubt that a visit from which Ashe had hoped much had ended\nin complete failure, that Parham was disposed to cross his powerful\nhenchman where he could, and that intrigue was busy in the cabinet\nitself against the reforming party of which Ashe was the head Ashe,\nindeed, felt his own official position, outwardly so strong, by no means\nsecure. But the game of politics was none the less exhilarating for\nthat.\n\nAs to Kitty's relation to himself--and life's most intimate and tender\nthings--in these days, did he probe his own consciousness much\nconcerning them? Probably not. Was he aware that, when all was said and\ndone, in spite of her misdoings, in spite of his passion of anxiety\nduring her illness, in spite of the pity and affection of his daily\nattitude, Kitty occupied, in truth, much less of his mind than she had\never yet occupied?--that a certain magic--primal, incommunicable--had\nceased to clothe her image in his thoughts?\n\nAgain--probably not. For these slow changes in a man's inmost\npersonality are like the ebb and flow of summer tides over estuary\nsands. Silent, the main creeps in, or out; and while we dream, the great\nbasin fills, and the fishing-boats come in--or the gentle, pitiless\nwaters draw back into the bosom of ocean, and the sea-birds run over the\nwide, untenanted flats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey landed at the Piazzetta as the lamps were being lit. The soft\nOctober darkness was falling fast, and on the ledges of St. Mark's and\nthe Ducal Palace the pigeons had begun to roost. An animated crowd was\nwalking up and down in the Piazza where a band was playing; and on the\ngolden horses of St. Mark's there shone a pale and mystical light, the\nlast reflection from the western sky. Under the colonnades the jewellers\nand glass-shops blazed and sparkled, and the warm sea-wind fluttered\nthe Italian flags on the great flag-staffs that but so recently had\nborne the Austrian eagle.\n\nAshe walked with his head thrown back, thinking absently, in this centre\nof Venice, of English politics, and of a phrase of Metternich's he had\ncome across in a volume of memoirs he had been lately reading on the\njourney:\n\n\"Le jour qui court n'a aucune valeur pour moi, except\u00c3\u00a9 comme la veille\ndu lendemain. C'est toujours avec le lendemain que mon esprit lutte.\"\n\nThe phrase pleased him particularly.\n\nHe, too, was wrestling with the morrow, though in another sense than\nMetternich's. His mind was alive with projects; an exultant\nconsciousness both of capacity and opportunity possessed him.\n\n\"Why, you've passed the club, William!\" said Kitty.\n\nAshe awoke with a start, smiled at her, and with a wave of the hand\ndisappeared in a stairway to the right.\n\nMargaret French lingered in a bead-shop to make some purchases. Kitty\nwalked home alone, and Margaret, whose watchful affection never failed,\nknew that she preferred it, and let her go her way.\n\nThe Ashes had rooms on the first bend of the Grand Canal looking south.\nTo reach them by land from the Piazza, Kitty had to pass through a\nseries of narrow streets, or _calles_, broken by _campos_, or small\nsquares, in which stood churches. As she passed one of these churches\nshe was attracted by the sound of gay music and by the crowd about the\nentrance. Pushing aside the leathern curtain over the door, she found\nherself in a great rococo nave, which blazed with lights and\ndecorations. Lines of huge wax candles were fixed in temporary holders\nalong the floor. The pillars were swathed in rose-colored damask, and\nthe choir was ablaze with flowers, and even more brilliantly lit, if\npossible, than the rest of the church.\n\nKitty's Catholic training told her that an exposition of the Blessed\nSacrament was going on. Mechanically she dipped her fingers into the\nholy water, she made her genuflection to the altar, and knelt down in\none of the back rows.\n\nHow rich and sparkling it was--the lights, the bright colors, the\ndancing music! \"_Dolce Sacramento! Santo Sacramento!_\" these words of an\nItalian hymn or litany recurred again and again, with endless iteration.\nKitty's sensuous, excitable nature was stirred with delight. Then,\nsuddenly, she remembered her child, and the little face she had seen for\nthe last time in the coffin. She began to cry softly, hiding her face in\nher black veil. An unbearable longing possessed her. \"I shall never have\nanother child,\" she thought. \"_That's_ all over.\"\n\nThen her thoughts wandered back to the party at Haggart, to the scene on\nthe terrace, and to that rush of excitement which had mastered her, she\nscarcely knew how or why. She could still hear the Dean's voice--see the\nlamp wavering above her head. \"What possessed me! I didn't care a straw\nwhether the lamp set me on fire--whether I lived or died. I wanted to\ndie.\"\n\nWas it because of that short conversation with William in the\nafternoon?--because of the calmness with which he had taken that word\n\"separation,\" which she had thrown at him merely as a child boasts and\nthreatens, never expecting for one moment to be taken at its word? She\nhad proposed it to him before, after the night at Hamel Weir; she had\nbeen serious then, it had been an impulse of remorse, and he had laughed\nat her. But at Haggart it had been an impulse of temper, and he had\ntaken it seriously. How the wound had rankled, all the afternoon, while\nshe was chattering to the Royalties! And as she jumped on the pedestal,\nand saw his face of horror, there was the typical womanish triumph that\nshe had made him _feel_--would make him feel yet more.\n\nHow good, how tender he had been to her in her illness! And yet--yet?\n\n\"He cares for politics, for his plans--not for me. He will never trust\nme again--as he did once. He'll never ask me to help him--he'll find\nways not to--though he'll be very sweet to me all the time.\"\n\nAnd the thought of her nullity with him in the future, her\ninsignificance in his life, tortured her.\n\nWhy had she treated Lord Parham so? \"I can be a lady when I choose,\" she\nsaid, mockingly, to herself. \"I wasn't even a lady.\"\n\nThen suddenly there flashed on her memory a little picture of Lord\nParham, standing spectacled and bewildered, peering into her slip of\npaper. She bent her head on her hands and laughed, a stifled, hysterical\nlaugh, which scandalized the woman kneeling beside her.\n\nBut the laugh was soon quenched again in restless pain. William's\naffection had been her only refuge in those weeks of moral and physical\nmisery she had just passed through.\n\n\"But it's only because he's so terribly sorry for me. It's all quite\ndifferent. And I can't ever make him love me again in the old way.... It\nwasn't my fault. It's something born in me--that catches me by the\nthroat.\"\n\nAnd she had the actual physical sense of some one strangled by a\npossessing force.\n\n\"_Dolce Sacramento! Santo Sacramento!_\"... The music swayed and echoed\nthrough the church. Kitty uncovered her eyes and felt a sudden\nexhilaration in the blaze of light. It reminded her of the bending\nChrist in the picture of San Giorgio. Awe and beauty flowed in upon her,\nin spite of the poor music and the tawdry church. What if she tried\nreligion?--recalled what she had been taught in the convent?--gave\nherself up to a director?\n\nShe shivered and recoiled. How would she ever maintain her faith against\nWilliam--William, who knew so much more than she?\n\nThen, into the emptiness of her heart there stole the inevitable\ntemptations of memory. Where was Geoffrey? She knew well that he was a\nviolent and selfish man; but he understood much in her that William\nwould never understand. With a morbid eagerness she recalled the play of\nfeeling between them, before that mad evening at Hamel Weir. What\nperpetual excitement--no time to think--or regret!\n\nDuring her weeks of illness she had lost all count of his movements. Had\nhe been still writing during the summer for the newspaper which had sent\nhim out? Had there not been rumors of his being wounded--or attacked by\nfever? Her memory, still vague and weak, struggled painfully with\nmemories it could not recapture.\n\nThe Italian paper of that morning--she had spelled it out for herself at\nbreakfast--had spoken of a defeat of the insurrectionary forces, and of\ntheir withdrawal into the highlands of Bosnia. There would be a lull in\nthe fighting. Would he come home? And all this time had he been the mere\nspectator and reporter, or fighting, himself? Her pulses leaped as she\nthought of him leading down-trodden peasants against the Turk.\n\nBut she knew nothing. Surely during the last few months he had purposely\nmade a mystery of his doings and his whereabouts. The only sign of him\nwhich seemed to have reached England had been that volume of poems--with\nthose hateful lines! Her lip quivered. She was like a weak child--unable\nto bear the thought of anything hostile and unkind.\n\nIf he had already turned homeward? Perhaps he would come through Venice!\nAnyway, he was not far off. The day before she and Margaret had made\ntheir first visit to the Lido. And as Kitty stood fronting the Adriatic\nwaves, she had dreamed that somewhere, beyond the farther coast, were\nthose Bosnian mountains in which Geoffrey had passed the winter.\n\nThen she started at her own thoughts, rose--loathing herself--drew down\nher veil, and moved towards the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs she reached the leathern curtain which hung over the doorway, a lady\nin front who was passing through held the curtain aside that Kitty might\nfollow. Kitty stepped into the street and looked up to say a mechanical\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nBut the word died on her lips. She gave a stifled cry, which was echoed\nby the woman before her.\n\nBoth stood motionless, staring at each other.\n\nKitty recovered herself first.\n\n\"It's not my fault that we've met,\" she said, panting a little. \"Don't\nlook at me so--so unkindly. I know you don't want to see me. Why--why\nshould we speak at all? I'm going away.\" And she turned with a gesture\nof farewell.\n\nAlice Wensleydale laid a detaining hand on Kitty's arm.\n\n\"No! stay a moment. You are in black. You look ill.\"\n\nKitty turned towards her. They had moved on instinctively into the\nshelter of one of the narrow streets.\n\n\"My boy died--two months ago,\" she said, holding herself proudly aloof.\n\nLady Alice started.\n\n\"I hadn't heard. I'm very sorry for you. How old was he?\"\n\n\"Three years old.\"\n\n\"Poor baby!\" The words were very low and soft. \"My boy--was fourteen.\nBut you have other children?\"\n\n\"No--and I don't want them. They might die, too.\"\n\nLady Alice paused. She still held her half-sister by the arm, towering\nabove her. She was quite as thin as Kitty, but much taller and more\nlargely built; and, beside the elaborate elegance of Kitty's mourning,\nAlice's black veil and dress had a severe, conventual air. They were\nalmost the dress of a religious.\n\n\"How are you?\" she said, gently. \"I often think of you. Are you happy in\nyour marriage?\"\n\nKitty laughed.\n\n\"We're such a happy lot, aren't we? We understand it so well. Oh, don't\ntrouble about me. You know you said you couldn't have anything to do\nwith me. Are you staying in Venice?\"\n\n\"I came in from Treviso for a day or two, to see a friend--\"\n\n\"You had better not stay,\" said Kitty, hastily. \"Maman is here. At\nleast, if you don't want to run across her.\"\n\nLady Alice let go her hold.\n\n\"I shall go home to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThey moved on a few steps in silence, then Alice paused. Kitty's\ndelicate face and cloud of hair made a pale, luminous spot in the\ndarkness of the _calle_. Alice looked at her with emotion.\n\n\"I want to say something to you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If you are ever in trouble--if you ever want me, send for me. Address\nTreviso, and it will always find me.\"\n\nKitty made no reply. They had reached a bridge over a side canal, and\nshe stopped, leaning on the parapet.\n\n\"Did you hear what I said?\" asked her companion.\n\n\"Yes. I'll remember. I suppose you think it your duty. What do you do\nwith yourself?\"\n\n\"I have two orphan children I bring up. And there is my lace-school. It\ndoesn't get on much; but it occupies me.\"\n\n\"Are you a Catholic?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Wish I was!\" said Kitty. She hung over the marble balustrade in\nsilence, looking at the crescent moon that was just peering over the\neastern palaces of the canal. \"My husband is in politics, you know. He's\nHome Secretary.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard. Do you help him?\"\n\n\"No--just the other thing.\"\n\nKitty lifted up a pebble and let it drop into the water.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that,\" said Alice Wensleydale, coldly.\n\"If you don't help him you'll be sorry--when it's too late to be sorry.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\" said Kitty. Then she moved restlessly. \"I must go in.\nGood-night.\" She held out her hand.\n\nLady Alice took it.\n\n\"Good-night. And remember!\"\n\n\"I sha'n't want anybody,\" said Kitty. \"_Addio!_\" She waved her hand, and\nAlice Wensleydale, whose way lay towards the Piazza, saw her disappear,\na small tripping shadow, between the high, close-piled houses.\n\nKitty was in so much excitement after this conversation that when she\nreached the Campo San Maurizio, where she should have turned abruptly to\nthe left, she wandered awhile up and down the campo, looking at the\ngondolas on the Traghetto between it and the Accademia, at the Church of\nSan Maurizio, at the rising moon, and the bright lights in some of the\nshop windows of the small streets to the north. The sea-wind was still\nwarm and gusty, and the waves in the Grand Canal beat against the marble\nfeet of its palaces.\n\nAt last she found her way through narrow passages, past hidden and\nhistoric buildings, to the back of the palace on the Grand Canal in\nwhich their rooms were. A door in a small court opened to her ring. She\nfound herself in a dark ground-floor--empty except for the _felze_ or\nblack top of a gondola--of which the farther doors opened on the canal.\nA cheerful Italian servant brought lights, and on the marble stairs was\nher maid waiting for her. In a few minutes she was on her sofa by a\nbright wood fire, while Blanche hovered round her with many small\nattentions.\n\n\"Have you seen your letters, my lady?\" and Blanche handed her a pile.\nUpon a parcel lying uppermost Kitty pounced at once with avidity. She\ntore it open--pausing once, with scarlet cheeks, to look round her at\nthe door, as though she were afraid of being seen.\n\nA book--fresh and new--emerged. _Politics and the Country Houses_; so\nran the title on the back. Kitty looked at it frowning. \"He might have\nfound a better name!\" Then she opened it--looked at a page here and a\npage there--laughed, shivered--and at last bethought her to read the\nnote from the publisher which accompanied it.\n\n\"'Much pleasure--the first printed copy--three more to follow--sure to\nmake a sensation'--hateful wretch!--'if your ladyship will let us\nknow how many presentation copies--' Goodness!--not _one_!\nOh--well!--Madeleine, perhaps--and, of course, Mr. Darrell.\"\n\nShe opened a little despatch-box in which she kept her letters, and\nslipped the book in.\n\n\"I won't show it to William to-night--not--not till next week.\" The book\nwas to be out on the 20th, a week ahead--three months from the day when\nshe had given the MS. into Darrell's hands. She had been spared all the\ntrouble of correcting proofs, which had been done for her by the\npublisher's reader, on the plea of her illness. She had received and\ndestroyed various letters from him--almost without reading them--during\na short absence of William's in the north.\n\nSuddenly a start of terror ran through her. \"No, no!\" she said,\nwrestling with herself--\"he'll scold me, perhaps--at first; of course I\nknow he'll do that. And then, I'll make him laugh! He can't--he can't\nhelp laughing. I _know_ it'll amuse him. He'll see how I meant it, too.\nAnd nobody need ever find out.\"\n\nShe heard his step outside, hastily locked her despatch-box, threw a\nshawl over it, and lay back languidly on her pillows, awaiting him.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThe following morning, early, a note was brought to Kitty from Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es:\n\n     \"Darling Kitty,--Will you join us to-night in an expedition? You\n     know that Princess Margherita is staying on the Grand Canal?--in\n     one of the Mocenigo palaces. There is to be a serenata in her honor\n     to-night--not one of those vulgar affairs which the hotels get up,\n     but really good music and fine voices--money to be given to some\n     hospital or other. Do come with us. I suppose you have your own\n     gondola, as we have. The gondolas who wish to follow meet at the\n     Piazzetta, weather permitting, eight o'clock. I know, of course,\n     that you are not going out. But this is _only_ music!--and for a\n     charity. One just sits in one's gondola, and follows the music up\n     the canal. Send word by bearer. Your fond mother,\n\n     \"Marguerite d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es.\"\n\nKitty tossed the note over to Ashe. \"Aren't you dining out somewhere\nto-night?\"\n\nHer voice was listless. And as Ashe lifted his head from the cabinet\npapers which had just reached him by special messenger, his attention\nwas disagreeably recalled from high matters of state to the very evident\ndelicacy of his wife. He replied that he had promised to dine with\nPrince S---- at Danieli's, in order to talk Italian politics. \"But I can\nthrow it over in a moment, if you want me. I came to Venice for _you_,\ndarling,\" he said, as he rose and joined her on the balcony which\ncommanded a fine stretch of the canal.\n\n\"No, no! Go and dine with your prince. I'll go with maman--Margaret and\nI. At least, Margaret must, of course, please herself!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and then added, \"Maman's probably in the\npink of society here. Venice doesn't take its cue from people like Aunt\nLina!\"\n\nAshe smiled uncomfortably. He was in truth by this time infinitely\nbetter acquainted with the incidents of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es's past career\nthan Kitty was. He had no mind whatever that Kitty should become less\nignorant, but his knowledge sometimes made conversation difficult.\n\nKitty was perfectly aware of his embarrassment.\n\n\"You never tell me--\" she said, abruptly. \"Did she really do such\ndreadful things?\"\n\n\"My dear Kitty!--why talk about it?\"\n\nKitty flushed, then threw a flower into the water below with a defiant\ngesture.\n\n\"What does it matter? It's all so long ago. I have nothing to do with\nwhat I did ten years ago--nothing!\"\n\n\"A convenient doctrine!\" laughed Ashe. \"But it cuts both ways. You get\nneither the good of your good nor the bad of your bad.\"\n\n\"I have no good,\" said Kitty, bitterly.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, miladi?\" said Ashe, half scolding, half\ntender. \"You growl over my remarks as though you were your own small dog\nwith a bone. Come here and let me tell you the news.\"\n\nAnd drawing the sofa up to the open window which commanded the\nmarvellous waterway outside, with its rows of palaces on either hand, he\nmade her lie down while he read her extracts from his letters.\n\nMargaret French, who was writing at the farther side of the room,\nglanced at them furtively from time to time. She saw that Ashe was\ntrying to charm away the languor of his companion by that talk of his,\nshrewd, humorous, vehement, well informed, which made him so welcome to\nthe men of his own class and mode of life. And when he talked to a woman\nas he was accustomed to talk to men, that woman felt it a compliment.\nUnder the stimulus of it, Kitty woke up, laughed, argued, teased, with\nsomething of her natural animation.\n\nPresently, indeed, the voices had sunk so much and the heads had drawn\nso close together that Margaret French slipped away, under the\nimpression that they were discussing matters to which she was not meant\nto listen.\n\nShe had hardly closed the door when Kitty drew herself away from Ashe,\nand holding his arm with both hands looked strangely into his eyes.\n\n\"You're awfully good to me, William. But, you know--you don't tell me\nsecrets!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, darling?\"\n\n\"You don't tell me the real secrets--what Lord Palmerston used to tell\nto Lady Palmerston!\"\n\n\"How do you know what he used to tell her?\" said Ashe, with a laugh. But\nhis forehead had reddened.\n\n\"One hears--and one guesses--from the letters that have been published.\nOh, I understand quite well! You can't trust me!\"\n\nAshe turned aside and began to gather up his papers.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Kitty, a little hoarsely, \"I know it's my own fault,\nbecause you used to tell me much more. I suppose it was the way I\nbehaved to Lord Parham?\"\n\nShe looked at him rather tremulously. It was the first time since her\nillness began that she had referred to the incidents at Haggart.\n\n\"Look here!\" said Ashe, in a tone of decision; \"I shall _really_ give up\ntalking politics to you if it only reminds you of disagreeable things.\"\n\nShe took no notice.\n\n\"Is Lord Parham behaving well to you--now--William?\"\n\nAshe colored hotly. As a matter of fact, in his own opinion, Lord Parham\nwas behaving vilely. A measure of first-rate importance for which he was\nresponsible was already in danger of being practically shelved, simply,\nas it seemed to him, from a lack of elementary trustworthiness in Lord\nParham. But as to this he had naturally kept his own counsel with Kitty.\n\n\"He is not the most agreeable of customers,\" he said, gayly. \"But I\nshall get through. Pegging away does it.\"\n\n\"And then to see how our papers flatter him!\" cried Kitty. \"How little\npeople know, who think they know! It would be amusing to show the world\nthe real Lord Parham.\"\n\nShe looked at her husband with an expression that struck him\ndisagreeably. He threw away his cigarette, and his face changed.\n\n\"What we have to do, my dear Kitty, is simply to hold our tongues.\"\n\nKitty sat up in some excitement.\n\n\"That man never hears the truth!\"\n\nAshe shrugged his shoulders. It seemed to him incredible that she should\npursue this particular topic, after the incidents at Haggart.\n\n\"That's not the purpose for which Prime Ministers exist. Anyway, _we_\ncan't tell it him.\"\n\nUndaunted, however, by his tone, and with what seemed to him\nextraordinary excitability of manner, Kitty reminded him of an incident\nin the life of a bygone administration, when the near relative of an\nEnglish statesman, staying at the time in the statesman's house, had\nsent a communication to one of the quarterlies attacking his policy and\nbelittling his character, by means of information obtained in the\nintimacy of a country-house party.\n\n\"One of the most treacherous things ever done!\" said Ashe, indignantly.\n\"Fair fight, if you like! But if that kind of thing were to spread, I\nfor one should throw up politics to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Every one said it did a vast deal of good,\" persisted Kitty.\n\n\"A precious sort of good! Yes--I believe Parham in particular profited\nby it--more shame to him! If anybody ever tried to help me in that sort\nof way--anybody, that is, for whom I felt the smallest responsibility--I\nknow what I should do.\"\n\n\"What?\" Kitty fell back on her cushions, but her eye still held him.\n\n\"Send in my resignation by the next post--and damn the fellow that did\nit! Look here, Kitty!\" He came to stand over her--a fine formidable\nfigure, his hands in his pockets. \"Don't you ever try that kind of\nthing--there's a darling.\"\n\n\"Would you damn me?\"\n\nShe smiled at him--with a tremor of the lip.\n\nHe caught up her hand and kissed it. \"Blow out my own brains, more\nlike,\" he said, laughing. Then he turned away. \"What on earth have we\ngot into this beastly conversation for? Let's get out of it. The Parhams\nare there--male and female--aren't they?--and we've got to put up with\nthem. Well, I'm going to the Piazza. Any commissions? Oh,\nby-the-way\"--he looked back at a letter in his hands--\"mother says Polly\nLyster will probably be here before we go--she seems to be touring\naround with her father.\"\n\n\"Charming prospect!\" said Kitty. \"Does mother expect me to chaperon\nher?\"\n\nAshe laughed and went. As soon as he was gone, Kitty sprang from the\nsofa, and walked up and down the room in a passionate preoccupation. A\ntremor of great fear was invading her; an agony of unavailing regret.\n\n\"What can I do?\" she said to herself, as her upper lip twisted and\ntortured the lower one.\n\nPresently she caught up her purse, went to her room, where she put on\nher walking things without summoning Blanche, and stealing down the\nstairs, so as to be unheard by Margaret, she made her way to the back\ngate of the Palazzo, and so to the streets leading to the Piazza.\nWilliam had taken the gondola to the Piazzetta, so she felt herself\nsafe.\n\nShe entered the telegraphic office at the western end of the Piazza, and\nsent a telegram to England that nearly emptied her purse of francs. When\nshe came out she was as pale as she had been flushed before--a little,\nterror-stricken figure, passing in a miserable abstraction through the\nintricate backways which took her home.\n\n\"It won't be published for ten days. There's time. It's only a question\nof money,\" she said to herself, feverishly--\"only a question of money!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the rest of the day, Kitty was at once so restless and so languid\nthat to amuse her was difficult. Ashe was quite grateful to his amazing\nmother-in-law for the plan of the evening.\n\nAs night fell, Kitty started at every sound in the old Palazzo. Once or\ntwice she went half-way to the door--eagerly--with hand\nout-stretched--as though she expected a letter.\n\n\"No other English post to-night, Kitty!\" said Ashe, at last, raising his\nhead from the finely printed _Poet\u00c3\u00a6 Minores_ he had just purchased at\nOngania's. \"You don't mean to say you're not thankful!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe evening arrived--clear and mild, but moonless. Ashe went off to dine\nwith his prince, in the ordinary gondola of commerce, hired at the\nTraghetto; while Margaret and Kitty followed a little later in one which\nhad already drawn the attention of Venice, owing to the two handsome\ngondoliers, habited in black from head to foot, who were attached to it.\nThey turned towards the Piazzetta, where they were to meet with Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' party.\n\nKitty, in her deep mourning, sank listlessly into the black cushions of\nthe gondola. Yet almost as they started, as the first strokes carried\nthem past the famous palace which is now the Prefecture, the spell of\nVenice began to work.\n\nCity of rest!--as it seems to our modern senses--how is it possible that\nso busy, so pitiless, and covetous a life as history shows us should\nhave gone to the making and the fashioning of Venice! The easy passage\nof the gondola through the soft, imprisoned wave; the silence of wheel\nand hoof, of all that hurries and clatters; the tide that comes and\ngoes, noiseless, indispensable, bringing in the freshness of the sea,\ncarrying away the defilements of the land; the narrow winding ways, now\nfirm earth, now shifting sea, that bind the city into one social whole,\nwhere the industrial and the noble alike are housed in palaces, equal\noften in beauty as in decay; the marvellous quiet of the nights, save\nwhen the northeast wind, Hadria's stormy leader, drives the furious\nwaves against the palace fronts in the darkness, with the clamor of an\nattacking host; the languor of the hot afternoons, when life is a dream\nof light and green water, when the play of mirage drowns the foundations\nof the _lidi_ in the lagoon, so that trees and buildings rise out of the\nsea as though some strong Amphion-music were but that moment calling\nthem from the deep; and when day departs, that magic of the swiftly\nfalling dusk, and that white foam and flower of St. Mark's upon the\npurple intensity of the sky!--through each phase of the hours and the\nseasons, _rest_ is still the message of Venice, rest enriched with\nendless images, impressions, sensations, that cost no trouble and breed\nno pain.\n\nIt was this spell of rest that descended for a while on Kitty as they\nglided downward to the Piazzetta. The terror of the day relaxed. Her\ntelegram would be in time; or, if not, she would throw herself into\nWilliam's arms, and he _must_ forgive her!--because she was so foolish\nand weak, so tired and sad. She slipped her hand into Margaret's; they\ntalked in low voices of the child, and Kitty was all appealing\nmelancholy and charm.\n\nAt the Piazzetta there was already a crowd of gondolas, and at their\nhead the _barca_, which carried the musicians.\n\n\"You are late, Kitty!\" cried Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, waving to them. \"Shall we\ndraw out and come to you?--or will you just join on where you are?\"\n\nFor the Vercelli gondola was already wedged into a serried line of boats\nin the wake of the _barca_.\n\n\"Never mind us,\" said Kitty. \"We'll tack on somehow.\"\n\nAnd inwardly she was delighted to be thus separated from her mother and\nthe chattering crowd by which Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es seemed to be surrounded.\nKitty and Margaret bade their men fall in, and they presently found\nthemselves on the Salute side of the floating audience, their prow\npointing to the canal.\n\nThe _barca_ began to move, and the mass of gondolas followed. Round\nthem, and behind them, other boats were passing and repassing, each with\nits slim black body, its swanlike motion, its poised oarsman, and its\ntwinkling light. The lagoon towards the Guidecca was alive with these\nlights; and a magnificent white steamer adorned with flags and\nlanterns--the yacht, indeed, of a German prince--shone in the\nmid-channel.\n\nOn they floated. Here were the hotels, with other illuminated boats in\nfront of their steps, whence spoiled voices shouted, \"Santa Lucia,\" till\neven Venice and the Grand Canal became a vulgarity and a weariness.\nThese were the \"serenate publiche,\" common and commercial affairs, which\nthe private serenata left behind in contempt, steering past their\nflaring lights for the dark waters of romance which lay beyond.\n\nSuddenly Kitty's sadness gave way; her starved senses clamored; she woke\nto poetry and pleasure. All round her, stretching almost across the\ncanal, the noiseless flock of gondolas--dark, leaning figures impelling\nthem from behind, and in front the high prows and glow-worm lights; in\nthe boats, a multitude of dim, shrouded figures, with not a face\nvisible; and in their midst the _barca_, temple of light and music,\nbuilt up of flowers, and fluttering scarves, and many-colored lanterns,\na sparkling fantasy of color, rose and gold and green, shining on the\nbosom of the night. To either side, the long, dark lines of\nthrice-historic palaces; scarcely a poor light here and there at their\nwater-gates; and now and then the lamps of the Traghetti.... Otherwise,\ndarkness, soundless motion, and, overhead, dim stars.\n\n\"Margaret! Look!\"\n\nKitty caught her companion's arm in a mad delight.\n\nSome one for the amusement of the guests of Venice was experimenting on\nthe top of the campanile of St. Mark's with those electric lights which\nwere then the toys of science, and are now the eyes and tools of war. A\nsearch-light was playing on the basin of St. Mark's and on the mouth of\nthe canal. Suddenly it caught the Church of the Salute--and the whole\nvast building, from the Queen of Heaven on its topmost dome down to the\nwater's brim, the figures of saints and prophets and apostles which\ncrowd its steps and ledges, the white whorls, like huge sea-shells, that\nmake its buttresses, the curves and volutes of its cornices and\ndoorways, rushed upon the eye in a white and blinding splendor, making\nthe very darkness out of which the vision sprang alive and rich. Not a\nChristian church, surely, but a palace of Poseidon! The bewildered gazer\nsaw naiads and bearded sea-gods in place of angels and saints, and must\nneeds imagine the champing of Poseidon's horses at the marble steps,\nstraining towards the sea.\n\nThe vision wavered, faded, reappeared, and finally died upon the night.\nThen the wild beams began to play on the canal, following the serenata,\nlighting up now the palaces on either hand, now some single gondola,\nrevealing every figure and gesture of the laughing English or Americans\nwho filled it, in a hard white flash.\n\n\"Oh! listen, Kitty!\" said Margaret. \"Some one is going to sing 'Ch\u00c3\u00a9\nfaro.'\"\n\nMiss French was very musical, and she turned in a trance of pleasure\ntowards the _barca_ whence came the first bars of the accompaniment.\n\nShe did not see meanwhile that Kitty had made a hurried movement, and\nwas now leaning over the side of the gondola, peering with arrested\nbreath into the scattered group of boats on their left hand. The\nsearch-light flashed here and there among them. A gondola at the very\nedge of the serenata contained one figure beside the gondolier, a man in\na large cloak and slouch hat, sitting very still with folded arms. As\nKitty looked, hearing the beating of her heart, their own boat was\nsuddenly lit up. The light passed in a second, and while it lasted those\nin the flash could see nothing outside it. When it withdrew all was in\ndarkness. The black mass of boats floated on, soundless again, save for\nan occasional plash of water or the hoarse cry of a gondolier--and in\nthe distance the wail for Eurydice.\n\nKitty fell back in her seat. An excitement, from which she shrank in a\nkind of terror, possessed her. Her thoughts were wholly absorbed by the\ngondola and the figure she could no longer distinguish--for which,\nwhenever a group of lamps threw their reflections on the water, she\nsearched the canal in vain. If what she madly dreamed were true, had she\nherself been seen--and recognized?\n\nThe serenata in honor of Italy's beautiful princess duly made its way to\nthe Grand Canal. The princess came to her balcony, while the \"Jewel\nSong\" in \"Faust\" was being sung below, and there was a demonstration\nwhich echoed from palace to palace and died away under the arch of the\nRialto. Then the gondolas dispersed. That of Lady Kitty Ashe had some\ndifficulty in making its way home against a force of wind and tide\ncoming from the lagoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty was apparently asleep when Ashe returned. He had sat late with his\nhosts--men prominent in the Risorgimento and in the politics of the new\nkingdom--discussing the latest intricacies of the Roman situation and\nthe prospects of Italian finance. His mind was all alert and vigorous,\nranging over great questions and delighting in its own strength. To come\nin contact with these able foreigners, not as the mere traveller but as\nan important member of an English government, beginning to be spoken of\nby the world as one of the two or three men of the future--this was a\nnew experience and a most agreeable one. Doors hitherto closed had\nopened before him; information no casual Englishman could have commanded\nhad been freely poured out for him; last, but not least, he had at\nlength made himself talk French with some fluency, and he looked back on\nhis performance of the evening with a boy's complacency.\n\nFor the rest, Venice was a mere trial of his patience! As his gondola\nbrought him home, struggling with wind and wave, Ashe had no eye\nwhatever for the beauty of this Venice in storm. His mind was in\nEngland, in London, wrestling with a hundred difficulties and\npossibilities. The old literary and speculative habit was fast\ndisappearing in the stress of action and success. His well-worn Plato or\nHorace still lay beside his bedside; but when he woke early, and lit a\ncandle carefully shaded from Kitty, it was not to the poets and\nphilosophers that he turned; it was to a heap of official documents and\nreports, to the letters of political friends, or an unfinished letter of\nhis own, the phrases of which had perhaps been running through his\ndreams. The measures for which he was wrestling against the intrigues of\nLord Parham and Lord Parham's clique filled all his mind with a lively\nardor of battle. They were the children--the darlings--of his thoughts.\n\nNevertheless, as he entered his wife's dim-lit room the eager arguments\nand considerations that were running through his head died away. He\nstood beside her, overwhelmed by a rush of feeling, alive through all\nhis being to the appeal of her frail sweetness, the helplessness of her\nsleep, the dumb significance of the thin, blue-veined hand--eloquent at\nonce of character and of physical weakness--which lay beside her. Her\nface was hidden, but the beautiful hair with its childish curls and\nripples drew him to her--touched all the springs of tenderness.\n\nIt was a loveliness so full, it seemed, of meaning and of promise. Hand,\nbrow, mouth--they were the signs of no mere empty and insipid beauty.\nThere was not a movement, not a feature, that did not speak of\nintelligence and mind.\n\nAnd yet, were he to wake her now and talk to her of the experience of\nhis evening, how little joy would either get out of it.\n\nWas it because she had no intellectual disinterestedness? Well, what\nwoman had! But other women, even if they saw everything in terms of\npersonality, had the power of pursuing an aim, steadily, persistently,\nfor the sake of a person. He thought of Lady Palmerston--of Princess\nLieven fighting Guizot's battles--and sighed.\n\nBy Jove! the women could do most things, if they chose. He recalled\nKitty's triumph in the great party gathered to welcome Lord Parham,\ncontrasting it with her wilful and absurd behavior to the man himself.\nThere was something bewildering in such power--combined with such folly.\nIn a sense, it was perfectly true that she had insulted her husband's\nchief, and jeopardized her husband's policy, because she could not put\nup with Lord Parham's white eyelashes.\n\nWell, let him make his account with it! How to love her, tend her, make\nher happy--and yet carry on himself the life of high office--there was\nthe problem! Meanwhile he recognized, fully and humorously, that she had\nmarried a political sceptic--and that it was hard for her to know what\nto do with the enthusiast who had taken his place.\n\nPoor, pretty, incalculable darling! He would coax her to stay abroad\npart of the Parliamentary season--and then, perhaps, lure her into the\ncountry, with the rebuilding and refurnishing of Haggart. She must be\nmanaged and kept from harm--and afterwards indulged and spoiled and\n_f\u00c3\u00aated_ to her heart's content.\n\nIf only the fates would give them another child!--a child brilliant and\nlovely like herself, then surely this melancholy which overshadowed her\nwould disperse. That look--that tragic look--she had given him on the\nday of the _f\u00c3\u00aate_, when she spoke of \"separation\"! The wild adventure\nwith the lamp had been her revenge--her despair. He shuddered as he\nthought of it.\n\nHe fell asleep, still pondering restlessly over her future and his own.\nAmid all his anxieties he never stooped to recollect the man who had\nendangered her name and peace. His optimism, his pride, the sanguine\nperfunctoriness of much of his character were all shown in the omission.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty, however, was not asleep while Ashe was beside her. And she slept\nbut little through the hours that followed. Between three and four she\nwas finally roused by the sounds of storm in the canal. It was as though\na fleet of gigantic steamers--in days when Venice knew but the\ngondola--were passing outside, sending a mountainous \"wash\" against the\nwalls of the old palace in which they lodged. In this languid autumnal\nVenice the sudden noise and crash were startling. Kitty sprang softly\nout of bed, flung on a dressing-gown and fur cloak, and slipped through\nthe open window to the balcony.\n\nA strange sight! Beneath, livid waves, lashing the marble walls; above,\na pale moonlight, obscured by scudding clouds. Not a sign of life on\nthe water or in the dark palaces opposite. Venice looked precisely as\nshe might have looked on some wild sixteenth-century night in the years\nof her glorious decay, when her palaces were still building and her\nstate tottering. Opposite, at the Traghetto of the Accademia, there were\nlamps, and a few lights in the gondolas; and through the storm-noises\none could hear the tossed boats grinding on their posts.\n\nThe riot of the air was not cold; there was still a recollection of\nsummer in the gusts that beat on Kitty's fair hair and wrestled with her\ncloak. As she clung to the balcony she pictured to herself the tumbling\nwaves on the Lido; the piled storm-clouds parting like a curtain above a\ndead Venice; and behind, the gleaming eternal Alps, sending their\nchallenge to the sea--the forces that make the land, to the forces that\nengulf it.\n\nHer wild fancy went out to meet the tumult of blast and wave. She felt\nherself, as it were, anchored a moment at sea, in the midst of a war of\nelements, physical and moral.\n\nYes, yes!--it was Geoffrey. Once, under the skipping light, she had seen\nthe face distinctly. Paler than of old--gaunt, unhappy, absent. It was\nthe face of one who had suffered--in body and mind. But--she trembled\nthrough all her slight frame!--the old harsh power was there unchanged.\n\nHad he seen and recognized her--slipping away afterwards into the mouth\nof a side canal, or dropping behind in the darkness? Was he ashamed to\nface her--or angered by the reminder of her existence? No doubt it\nseemed to him now a monstrous absurdity that he should ever have said he\nloved her! He despised her--thought her a base and coward soul. Very\nlikely he would make it up with Mary Lyster now, accept her nursing and\nher money.\n\nHer lip curled in scorn. No, _that_ she didn't believe! Well, then, what\nwould be his future? His name had been but little in the newspapers\nduring the preceding year; the big public seemed to have forgotten him.\nA cloud had hung for months over the struggle of races and of faiths now\npassing in the Balkans. Obscure fighting in obscure mountains; massacre\nhere, revolt there; and for some months now hardly an accredited voice\nfrom Turk or Christian to tell the world what was going on.\n\nBut Geoffrey had now emerged--and at a moment when Europe was beginning\nperforce to take notice of what she had so far wilfully ignored. _\u00c3\u0080 lui\nla parole!_ No doubt he was preparing it, the bloody, exciting story\nwhich would bring him before the foot-lights again, and make him once\nmore the lion of a day. More social flatteries, more doubtful\nlove-affairs! Fools like herself would feel his spell, would cherish and\ncaress him, only to be stung and scathed as she had been. The bitter\nlines of his \"portrait\" rung in her ears--blackening and discrowning her\nin her own eyes.\n\nShe abhorred him!--but the thought that he was in Venice burned deep\ninto senses and imagination. Should she tell William she had seen him?\nNo, no! She would stand by herself, protect herself!\n\nSo she stole back to bed, and lay there wakeful, starting guiltily at\nWilliam's every movement. If he knew what had happened!--what she was\nthinking of! Why on earth should he? It would be monstrous to harass\nhim on his holiday--with all these political affairs on his mind.\n\nThen suddenly--by an association of ideas--she sat up shivering, her\nhands pressed to her breast. The telegram--the book! Oh, but _of course_\nshe had been in time!--_of course_! Why, she had offered the man two\nhundred pounds! She lay down laughing at herself--forcing herself to try\nand sleep.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nSir Richard Lyster unfolded his _Times_ with a jerk.\n\n\"A beastly rheumatic hole I call this,\" he said, looking angrily at the\nwindow of his hotel sitting-room, which showed drops from a light shower\nthen passing across the lagoon. \"And the dilatoriness of these Italian\nposts is, upon my soul, beyond bearing! This _Times_ is _three_ days\nold.\"\n\nMary Lyster looked up from the letter she was writing.\n\n\"Why don't you read the French papers, papa? I saw a _Figaro_ of\nyesterday in the Piazza this morning.\"\n\n\"Because I can't!\" was the indignant reply. \"There wasn't the same\namount of money squandered on _my_ education, my dear, that there has\nbeen on yours.\"\n\nMary smiled a little, unseen. Her father had been, of course, at Eton.\nShe had been educated by a succession of small and hunted governesses,\nmostly Swiss, whose remuneration had certainly counted among the\nfrugalities rather than the extravagances of the family budget.\n\nSir Richard read his _Times_ for a while. Mary continued to write checks\nfor the board wages of the servants left at home, and to give directions\nfor the beating of carpets and cleaning of curtains. It was dull work,\nand she detested it.\n\nPresently Sir Richard rose, with a stretch. He was a tall old man, with\na shock of white hair and very black eyes. A victim to certain obscure\nforms of gout, he was in character neither stupid nor inhuman, but he\nsuffered from the usual drawbacks of his class--too much money and too\nfew ideas. He came abroad every year, reluctantly. He did not choose to\nbe left behind by county neighbors whose wives talked nonsense about\nBotticelli. And Mary would have it. But Sir Richard's tours were\ngenerally one prolonged course of battle between himself and all foreign\ninstitutions; and if it was Mary who drove him forth, it was Mary also\nwho generally hurried him home.\n\n\"Who was it you saw last night in that ridiculous singing affair?\" he\nasked, as he put the fire together.\n\n\"Kitty Ashe--and her mother,\" said Mary--after a moment--still writing.\n\n\"Her mother!--what, that disreputable woman?\"\n\n\"They weren't in the same gondola.\"\n\n\"Ashe will be a great fool if he lets his wife see much of that woman!\nBy all accounts Lady Kitty is quite enough of a handful already.\nBy-the-way, have you found out where they are?\"\n\n\"On the Grand Canal. Shall we call this afternoon?\"\n\n\"I don't mind. Of course, I think Ashe is doing an immense amount of\nharm.\"\n\n\"Well, you can tell him so,\" said Mary.\n\nSir Richard frowned. His daughter's manners seemed to him at times\nabrupt.\n\n\"Why do you see so little now of Elizabeth Tranmore?\" he asked her, with\na sharp look. \"You used to be always there. And I don't believe you even\nwrite to her much now.\"\n\n\"Does she see much of anybody?\"\n\n\"Because, you mean, of Tranmore's condition? What good can she be to him\nnow? He knows nobody.\"\n\n\"She doesn't seem to ask the question,\" said Mary, dryly.\n\nA queer, soft look came over Sir Richard's old face.\n\n\"No, the women don't,\" he said, half to himself, and fell into a little\nreverie. He emerged from it with the remark--accompanied by a smile, a\nlittle sly but not unkind:\n\n\"I always used to hope, Polly, that you and Ashe would have made it up!\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know why,\" said Mary, fastening up her envelopes. As\nshe did so it crossed her father's mind that she was still very\ngood-looking. Her dress of dark-blue cloth, the plain fashion of her\nbrown hair, her oval face and well-marked features, her plump and pretty\nhands, were all pleasant to look upon. She had rather a hard way with\nher, though, at times. The servants were always giving warning. And,\npersonally, he was much fonder of his younger daughter, whom Mary\nconsidered foolish and improvident. But he was well aware that Mary made\nhis life easy.\n\n\"Well, you were always on excellent terms,\" he said, in answer to her\nlast remark. \"I remember his saying to me once that you were very good\ncompany. The Bishop, too, used to notice how he liked to talk to you.\"\n\nWhen Mary and her father were together, \"the Bishop\" was Sir Richard's\nproperty. He only fell to Mary's share in the old man's absence.\n\nMary colored slightly.\n\n\"Oh yes, we got on,\" she said, counting her letters the while with a\nquick hand.\n\n\"Well, I hope that young woman whom he _did_ marry is now behaving\nherself. It was that fellow Cliffe with whom the scandal was last year,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"There was a good deal of talk,\" said Mary.\n\n\"A rum fellow, that Cliffe! A man at the club told me last week it is\nbelieved he has been fighting for these Bosnian rebels for months.\nShocking bad form I call it. If the Turks catch him, they'll string him\nup. And quite right, too. What's he got to do with other people's\nquarrels?\"\n\n\"If the Turks will be such brutes--\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear! Don't you believe any of this radical stuff. The\nTurks are awfully fine fellows--fight like bull-dogs. And as for the\n'atrocities,' they make them up in London. Oh, of course, what Cliffe\nwants is notoriety--we all know that. Well, I'm going out to see if I\ncan find another English paper. Beastly climate!\"\n\nBut as Sir Richard turned again to the window, he was met by a burst of\nsunshine, which hit him gayly in the face like a child's impertinence.\nHe grumbled something unintelligible as Mary put him into his Inverness\ncape, took hat and stick, and departed.\n\nMary sat still beside the writing-table, her hands crossed on her lap,\nher eyes absently bent upon them.\n\nShe was thinking of the serenata. She had followed it with an\nacquaintance from the hotel, and she had seen not only Kitty and Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, but also--the solitary man in the heavy cloak. She knew quite\nwell that Cliffe was in Venice; though, true to her secretive temper,\nshe had not mentioned the fact to her father.\n\nOf course he was in Venice on Kitty's account. It would be too absurd to\nsuppose that he was here by mere coincidence. Mary believed that nothing\nbut the intervention of Cliffe's mighty kinsman from the north had saved\nthe situation the year before. Kitty would certainly have betrayed her\nhusband but for the _force majeure_ arrayed against her. And now the\nmagnate who had played Providence slumbered in the family vault. He had\npassed away in the spring, full of years and honors, leaving Cliffe some\nmoney. The path was clear. As for the escapade in the Balkans, Geoffrey\nwas, of course, tired of it. A sensational book, hurried out to meet the\npublic appetite for horrors--and the pursuance of his intrigue with Lady\nKitty Ashe--Mary was calmly certain that these were now his objects. He\nwas, no doubt, writing his book and meeting Kitty where he could. Ashe\nwould soon have to go home. And then! As if that girl Margaret French\ncould stop it!\n\nWell, William had only got his deserts! But as her thoughts passed from\nKitty or Cliffe to William Ashe, their quality changed. Hatred and\nbitterness, scorn or wounded vanity, passed into something gentler. She\nfell into recollections of Ashe as he had appeared on that bygone\nafternoon in May when he came back triumphant from his election, with\nthe world before him. If he had never seen Kitty Bristol!--\n\n\"I should have made him a good wife,\" she said to herself. \"_I_ should\nhave known how to be proud of him.\"\n\nAnd there emerged also the tragic consciousness that if the fates had\ngiven him to her she might have been another woman--taught by happiness,\nby love, by motherhood.\n\nIt was that little, heartless creature who had snatched them both from\nher--William and Geoffrey Cliffe--the higher and the lower--the man who\nmight have ennobled her--and the man, half charlatan, half genius, whom\nshe might have served and raised, by her fortune and her abilities. Her\nlife might have been so full, so interesting! And it was Kitty that had\nmade it flat, and cold, and futureless.\n\nPoor William! Had he really liked her, in those boy-and-girl days? She\ndreamed over their old cousinly relations--over the presents he had\nsometimes given her.\n\nThen a thought, like a burning arrow, pierced her. Her hands locked,\nstraining one against the other. If this intrigue were indeed\nrenewed--if Geoffrey succeeded in tempting Kitty from her husband--why\nthen--then--\n\nShe shivered before the images that were passing through her mind, and,\nrising, she put away her letters and rang for the waiter, to order\ndinner.\n\n\"Where shall we go?\" said Kitty, languidly, putting down the French\nnovel she was reading.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mr. Ashe suggested San Lazzaro.\" Margaret looked up from her writing as\nKitty moved towards her. \"The rain seems to have all cleared off.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter where,\" said Kitty, and was turning\naway; but Margaret caught her hand and caressed it.\n\n\"Naughty Kitty! why this sea air can't put some more color into your\ncheeks I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I'm _not_ pale!\" cried Kitty, pouting. \"Margaret, you do croak about me\nso! If you say any more I'll go and rouge till you'll be ashamed to go\nout with me--there! Where's William?\"\n\nWilliam opened the door as she spoke, the _Gazetta di Venezia_ in one\nhand and a telegram in the other.\n\n\"Something for you, darling,\" he said, holding it out to Kitty. \"Shall I\nopen it?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Kitty, hastily. \"Give it me. It's from my Paris woman.\"\n\n\"Ah--ha!\" laughed Ashe. \"Some extravagance you want to keep to yourself,\nI'll be bound. I've a good mind to see!\"\n\nAnd he teasingly held it up above her head. But she gave a little jump,\ncaught it, and ran off with it to her room.\n\n     \"Much regret impossible stop publication. Fifty copies distributed\n     already. Writing.\"\n\nShe dropped speechless on the edge of her bed, the crumpled telegram in\nher hand. The minutes passed.\n\n\"When will you be ready?\" said Ashe, tapping at the door.\n\n\"Is the gondola there?\"\n\n\"Waiting at the steps.\"\n\n\"Five minutes!\" Ashe departed. She rose, tore the telegram into little\nbits, and began with deliberation to put on her mantle and hat.\n\n\"You've got to go through with it,\" she said to the white face in the\nglass, and she straightened her small shoulders defiantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were bound for the Armenian convent. It was a misty day, with\nshafts of light on the lagoon. The storm had passed, but the water was\nstill rough, and the clouds seemed to be withdrawing their forces only\nto marshal them again with the darkness. A day of sudden bursts of\nwatery light, of bands of purple distance struck into enchanting beauty\nby the red or orange of a sail, of a wild salt breath in air that seemed\nto be still suffused with spray. The Alps were hidden; but what sun\nthere was played faintly on the Euganean hills.\n\n\"I say, Margaret, at last she does us some credit!\" said Ashe, pointing\nto his wife.\n\nMargaret started. Was it rouge?--or was it the strong air? Kitty's\nlanguor had entirely disappeared; she was more cheerful and more\ntalkative than she had been at any time since their arrival. She\nchattered about the current scandals of Venice--the mysterious contessa\nwho lived in the palace opposite their own, and only went out, in deep\nmourning, at night, because she had been the love of a Russian\ngrand-duke, and the grand-duke was dead; of the Carlist pretender and\nhis wife, who had been very popular in Venice until they took it into\ntheir heads to require royal honors, and Venice, taking time to think,\nhad lazily decided the game was not worth the candle--so now the sulky\npair went about alone in a fine gondola, turning glassy eyes on their\nformer acquaintance; of the needy marchese who had sold a Titian to the\nLouvre, and had then found himself boycotted by all his kinsfolk in\nVenice who were not needy and had no Titians to sell--all these tales\nKitty reeled out at length till the handsome gondoliers marvelled at the\nlittle lady's vivacity and the queer brightness of her eyes.\n\n\"Gracious, Kitty, where do you get all these stories from?\" cried Ashe,\nwhen the chatter paused for a moment.\n\nHe looked at her with delight, rejoicing in her gayety, the slight\ntouches of white which to-day for the first time relieved the sombreness\nof her dress, the return of her color. And Margaret wondered again how\nmuch of it was rouge.\n\nAt the Armenian convent a handsome young monk took charge of them. As\nGeorge Sand and Lamennais had done before them, they looked at the\nprinting-press, the garden, the cloister, the church; they marvelled\nlazily at the cleanliness and brightness of the place; and finally they\nclimbed to the library and museum, and the room close by where Byron\nplayed at grammar-making. In this room Ashe fell suddenly into a\npolitical talk with the young monk, who was an ardent and patriotic son\nof the most unfortunate of nations, and they passed out and down the\nstairs, followed by Margaret French, not noticing that Kitty had\nlingered behind.\n\nKitty stood idly by the window of Byron's room, thinking restlessly of\nverses that were not Byron's, though there was in them, clothed in forms\nof the new age, the spirit of Byronic passion, and more than a touch of\nByronic affectation--thinking also of the morning's telegram. Supposing\nDarrell's prophecy, which had seemed to her so absurd, came true, that\nthe book did William harm, not good--that he ceased to love her--that he\ncast her off?...\n\n... A plash of water outside, and a voice giving directions. From the\nlagoon towards Malamocco a gondola approached. A gentleman and lady were\nseated in it. The lady--a very handsome Italian, with a loud laugh and\nbrilliant eyes--carried a scarlet parasol. Kitty gave a stifled cry as\nshe drew back. She fled out of the room and overtook the other two.\n\n\"May we go back into the garden a little?\" she said, hurriedly, to the\nmonk who was talking to William. \"I should like to see the view towards\nVenice.\"\n\nWilliam held up a watch, to show that there was but just time to get\nback to the Piazza, for lunch. Kitty persisted, and the monk,\nunderstanding what the impetuous young lady wished, good-naturedly\nturned to obey her.\n\n\"We must be _very_ quick!\" said Kitty. \"Take us please, to the edge,\nbeyond the trees.\"\n\nAnd she herself hurried through the garden to its farther side, where it\nwas bounded by the lagoon.\n\nThe others followed her, rather puzzled by her caprice.\n\n\"Not much to be seen, darling!\" said Ashe, as they reached the\nwater--\"and I think this good man wants to get rid of us!\"\n\nAnd, indeed, the monk was looking backward across the intervening trees\nat a party which had just entered the garden.\n\n\"Ah, they have found another brother!\" he said, politely, and he began\nto point out to Kitty the various landmarks visible, the arsenal, the\ntwo asylums, San Pietro di Castello.\n\nThe new-comers just glanced at the garden apparently, as the Ashes had\ndone on arrival, and promptly followed their guide back into the\nconvent.\n\nKitty asked a few more questions, then led the way in a hasty return to\nthe garden door, the entrance-hall, and the steps where their gondola\nwas waiting. Nothing was to be seen of the second party. They had passed\non into the cloisters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnimation, oddity, inconsequence, all these things Margaret observed in\nKitty during luncheon in a restaurant of the Merceria, and various\nincidents connected with it; animation above all. The Ashes fell in with\nacquaintance--a fashionable and harassed mother, on the fringe of the\nArchangels, accompanied by two daughters, one pretty and one plain, and\nsore pressed by their demands, real or supposed. The parents were not\nrich, but the girls had to be dressed, taken abroad, produced at\ncountry-houses, at Ascot, and the opera, like all other girls. The\neldest girl, a considerable beauty, was an accomplished egotist at\nnineteen, and regarded her mother as a rather inefficient _dame de\ncompagnie_. Kitty understood this young lady perfectly, and after\nluncheon, over her cigarette, her little, sharp, probing questions gave\nthe beauty twenty minutes' annoyance. Then appeared a young man,\nill-dressed, red-haired, and shy. Carelessly as he greeted the mother\nand daughters, his entrance, however, transformed them. The mother\nforgot fatigue; the beauty ceased to yawn; the younger girl, who had\nbeen making surreptitious notes of Kitty's costume in the last leaf of\nher guide-book, developed a charming gush. He was the owner of the\nMagellan estates and the historic Magellan Castle; a professed hater of\n\"absurd womankind,\" and, in general, a hunted and self-conscious person.\nKitty gave him one finger, looked him up and down, asked him whether he\nwas yet engaged, and when he laughed an embarrassed \"No,\" told him that\nhe would certainly die in the arms of the Magellan housekeeper.\n\nThis got a smile out of him. He sat down beside her, and the two laughed\nand talked with a freedom which presently drew the attention of the\nneighboring tables, and made Ashe uncomfortable. He rose, paid the bill,\nand succeeded in carrying the whole party off to the Piazza, in search\nof coffee. But here again Kitty's extravagances, the provocation of her\nlight loveliness, as she sat toying with a fresh cigarette and\n\"chaffing\" Lord Magellan, drew a disagreeable amount of notice from the\nItalians passing by.\n\n\"Mother, let's go!\" said the angry beauty, imperiously, in her mother's\near. \"I don't like to be seen with Lady Kitty! She's impossible!\"\n\nAnd with cold farewells the three ladies departed. Then Kitty sprang up\nand threw away her cigarette.\n\n\"How those girls bully their mother!\" she said, with scorn. \"However, it\nserves her right. I'm sure she bullied hers. Well, now we must go and do\nsomething. Ta-ta!\"\n\nLord Magellan, to whom she offered another casual finger, wanted to know\nwhy he was dismissed. If they were going sight-seeing, might he not come\nwith them?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Kitty, calmly. \"Sight--seeing with people you don't really\nknow is too trying to the temper. Even with one's best friend it's\nrisky.\"\n\n\"Where are you? May I call?\" said the young man.\n\n\"We're always out,\" was Kitty's careless reply. \"But--\"\n\nShe considered--\n\n\"Would you like to see the Palazzo Vercelli?\"\n\n\"That magnificent place on the Grand Canal? Very much.\"\n\n\"Meet me there to-morrow afternoon,\" said Kitty. \"Four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Delighted!\" said Lord Magellan, making a note on his shirt-cuff. \"And\nwho lives there?\"\n\n\"My mother,\" said Kitty, abruptly, and walked away.\n\nAshe followed her in discomfort. This young man was the son of a certain\nLady Magellan, an intimate friend of Lady Tranmore's--one of the noblest\nwomen of her generation, pure, high-minded, spiritual, to whom neither\nan ugly word nor thought was possible. It annoyed him that either he or\nKitty should be introducing _her_ son to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\nIt was really tiresome of Kitty! Rich young men with characters yet\nindeterminate were not to be lightly brought in contact with Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es. Kitty could not be ignorant of it--poor child! It had been\none of her reckless strokes, and Ashe was conscious of a sharp\nannoyance.\n\nHowever, he said nothing. He followed his companions from church to\nchurch, till pictures became an abomination to him. Then he pleaded\nletters, and went to the club.\n\n\"Will you call on maman to-morrow?\" said Kitty, as he turned away,\nlooking at him a little askance.\n\nShe knew that he had disapproved of her invitation to Lord Magellan. Why\nhad she given it? She didn't know. There seemed to be a kind of revived\nmischief and fever in the blood, driving her to these foolish and\nill-considered things.\n\nAshe met her question with a shake of the head and the remark, in a\ndecided tone, that he should be too busy.\n\nPrivately he thought it a piece of impertinence that Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es\nshould expect either Kitty or himself to appear in her drawing-room at\nall. That this implied a complete transformation of his earlier attitude\nhe was well aware; he accepted it with a curious philosophy. When he and\nKitty first met he had never troubled his head about such things. If a\nwoman amused or interested him in society, so long as his taste was\nsatisfied she might have as much or as little character as she pleased.\nIt stirred his mocking sense of English hypocrisy that the point should\nbe even raised. But now--how can any individual, he asked himself, with\npolitical work to do, affect to despise the opinions and prejudices of\nsociety? A politician with great reforms to put through will make no\nfriction round him that he can avoid--unless he is a fool. It weighed\nsorely, therefore, on his present mind that Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es was in\nVenice--that she was a person of blemished repute--that he must be and\nwas ashamed of her. It would have been altogether out of consonance with\nhis character to put any obstacle in the way of Kitty's seeing her\nmother. But he chafed as he had never yet chafed under the humiliation\nof his relationship to the notorious Margaret Fitzgerald of the forties,\nwho had been old Blackwater's _ch\u00c3\u00a8re amie_ before she married him, and,\nas Lady Blackwater, had sacrificed her innocent and defenceless\nstep-daughter to one of her own lovers, in order to secure for him the\nstep-daughter's fortune--black and dastardly deed!\n\nWas it all part of the general growth and concentration that any shrewd\nobserver might have read in William Ashe?--the pressure--enormous,\nunseen--of the traditional English ideals, English standards, asserting\nitself at last in a brilliant and paradoxical nature? It had been\nso--conspicuously--in the case of one of his political predecessors.\nLord Melbourne had begun his career as a person of idle habits and\nimprudent adventures, much given to coarse conversation, and unable to\nsay the simplest thing without an oath. He ended it as the man of\nscrupulous dignity, tact, and delicacy, who moulded the innocent youth\nof a girl-queen, to his own lasting honor and England's gratitude. In\nways less striking, the same influence of vast responsibilities was\nperhaps acting upon William Ashe. It had already made him a sterner,\ntougher, and--no doubt--a greater man.\n\nThe defection of William only left Kitty, it seemed, still more greedy\nof things to see and do. Innumerable sacristans opened all possible\ndoors and unveiled all possible pictures. Bellini succeeded Tintoret,\nand Carpaccio Bellini. The two sable gondoliers wore themselves out in\nKitty's service, and Margaret's kind, round face grew more and more\npuzzled and distressed. And whence this strange impression that the\nwhole experience was a _flight_ on Kitty's part?--or, rather, that\nthroughout it she was always eagerly expecting, or eagerly escaping from\nsome unknown, unseen pursuer? A glance behind her--a start--a sudden\nshivering gesture in the shadows of dark churches--these things\nsuggested it, till Margaret herself was caught by the same suppressed\nexcitement that seemed to be alive in Kitty. Did it all point merely to\nsome mental state--to the nervous effects of her illness and her loss?\n\nWhen they reached home about five o'clock, Kitty was naturally tired\nout. Margaret put her on the sofa, gave her tea, and tended her, hoping\nthat she might drop asleep before dinner. But just as tea was over, and\nKitty was lying curled up, silent and white, with that brooding look\nwhich kept Margaret's anxiety about her constantly alive, there was a\nsudden sound of voices in the anteroom outside.\n\n\"Margaret!\" cried Kitty, starting up in dismay--\"say I'm not at home.\"\n\nToo late! Their smiling Italian housemaid threw the door open, with the\nair of one bringing good-fortune. And behind her appeared a tall lady,\nand an old gentleman hat in hand.\n\n\"May we come in, Kitty?\" said Mary Lyster, advancing. \"Cousin Elizabeth\ntold us you were here.\"\n\nKitty had sprung up. The disorder of her fair hair, her white cheeks,\nand the ghostly thinness of her small, black-robed form drew the curious\neyes of Sir Richard. And the oddness of her manner as she greeted them\nonly confirmed the old man's prejudice against her.\n\nHowever, greeted they were, in some sort of fashion; and Miss French\ngave them tea. She kept Sir Richard entertained, while Kitty and Mary\nconversed. They talked perfunctorily of ordinary topics--Venice, its\nsights, its hotels, and the people staying in them--of Lady Tranmore and\nvarious Ashe relations. Meanwhile the inmost thought of each was busy\nwith the other.\n\nKitty studied the lines of Mary's face and the fashion of her dress.\n\n\"She looks much older. And she's not enjoying her life a bit. That's my\nfault. I spoiled all her chances with Geoffrey--and she knows it. She\n_hates_ me. Quite right, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean that nonsensical thing last night?\" Sir Richard was saying\nto Margaret French. \"Oh no, I didn't go. But Mary, of course, thought\nshe must go. Somebody invited her.\"\n\nKitty started.\n\n\"You were at the serenata?\" she said to Mary.\n\n\"Yes, I went with a party from the hotel.\"\n\nKitty looked at her. A sudden flush had touched her pale cheeks, and she\ncould not conceal the trembling of her hands.\n\n\"That was marvellous, that light on the Salute, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Wonderful!--and on the water, too. I saw two or three people I\nknew--just caught their faces for a second.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" said Kitty. And thoughts ran fast through her head. \"Did she\nsee Geoffrey?--and does she mean me to understand that she did? How she\ndetests me! If she did see him, of course she supposes that I know all\nabout it, and that he's here for me. Why don't I ask her, straight out,\nwhether she saw him, and make her understand that I don't care\ntwopence?--that she's welcome to him--as far as I'm concerned?\"\n\nBut some hidden feeling tied her tongue. Mary continued to talk about\nthe serenata, and Kitty was presently conscious that her every word and\ngesture in reply was closely watched. \"Yes, yes, she saw him. Perhaps\nshe'll tell William--or write home to mother?\"\n\nAnd in her excitement she began to chatter fast and loudly, mostly to\nSir Richard--repeating some of the Venice tales she had told in the\ngondola--with much inconsequence and extravagance. The old man listened,\nhis hands on his stick, his eyes on the ground, the expression on his\nstrong mouth hostile or sarcastic. It was a relief to everybody when\nAshe's step was heard stumbling up the dark stairs, and the door opened\non his friendly and courteous presence.\n\n\"Why, Polly!--and Cousin Richard! I wondered where you had hidden\nyourselves.\"\n\nMary's bright, involuntary smile transformed her. Ashe sat down beside\nher, and they were soon deep in all sorts of gossip--relations,\nacquaintance, politics, and what not. All Mary's stiffness disappeared.\nShe became the elegant, agreeable woman, of whom dinner-parties were\nglad. Ashe plunged into the pleasant malice of her talk, which ranged\nthrough the good and evil fortunes--mostly the latter--of half his\nacquaintance; discussed the debts, the love-affairs, and the follies of\nhis political colleagues or Parliamentary foes; how the Foreign\nSecretary had been getting on at Balmoral--how so-and-so had been ruined\nat the Derby and restored to sanity and solvency by the Oaks--how Lady\nParham, at Hatfield, had been made to know her place by the French\nAmbassador--and the like; passing thereby a charming half-hour.\n\nMeanwhile Kitty, Margaret French, and Sir Richard kept up intermittent\nremarks, pausing at every other phrase to gather the crumbs that fell\nfrom the table of the other two.\n\nKitty was very weary, and a dead weight had fallen on her spirits. If\nSir Richard had thought her bad form ten minutes before, his unspoken\nmind now declared her stupid. Meanwhile Kitty was saying to herself, as\nshe watched her husband and Mary:\n\n\"I used to amuse William just as well--last year!\"\n\nWhen the door closed on them, Kitty fell back on her cushions with an\n\"ouf!\" of relief. William came back in a few minutes from showing the\nvisitors the back way to their hotel, and stood beside his wife with an\nanxious face.\n\n\"They were too much for you, darling. They stayed too long.\"\n\n\"How you and Mary chattered!\" said Kitty, with a little pout. But at the\nsame moment she slipped an appealing hand into his.\n\nAshe clasped the hand, and laughed.\n\n\"I always told you she was an excellent gossip.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSir Richard and Mary pursued their way through the narrow _calles_ that\nled to the Piazza. Sir Richard was expatiating on Ashe's folly in\nmarrying such a wife.\n\n\"She looks like an actress!--and as to her conversation, she began by\ntelling me outrageous stories and ended by not having a word to say\nabout anything. The bad blood of the Bristols, it seems to me, without\ntheir brains.\"\n\n\"Oh no, papa! Kitty is very clever. You haven't heard her recite. She\nwas tired to-night.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to flatter you, my dear!\" said the old man,\ntestily, \"but I thought it was pathetic--the way in which Ashe enjoyed\nyour conversation. It showed he didn't get much of it at home.\"\n\nMary smiled uncertainly. Her whole nature was still aglow from that\ncontact with Ashe's delightful personality. After months of depression\nand humiliation, her success with him had somehow restored those\nillusions on which cheerfulness depends.\n\nHow ill Kitty looked--and how conscious! Mary was impetuously certain\nthat Kitty had betrayed her knowledge of Cliffe's presence in Venice;\nand equally certain that William knew nothing. Poor William!\n\nWell, what can you expect of such a temperament--such a race? Mary's\nthoughts travelled confusedly towards--and through--some big and\ndreadful catastrophe.\n\nAnd then? After it?\n\nIt seemed to her that she was once more in the Park Lane drawing-room;\nthe familiar Morris papers and Burne-Jones drawings surrounded her; and\nshe and Elizabeth Tranmore sat, hand in hand, talking of William--a\nWilliam once more free, after much folly and suffering, to reconstruct\nhis life....\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Sir Richard Lyster, moving down a dark passage\ntowards the brightly lit doorway of their hotel.\n\nWith a start--as of one taken red-handed--Mary awoke from her dream.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es and her friend, Donna Laura, occupied the _mezzanin_ of\nthe vast Vercelli palace. The palace itself belonged to the head of the\nVercelli family. It was a magnificent erection of the late seventeenth\ncentury, at this moment half furnished, dilapidated, and forsaken. But\nthe _entresol_ on the eastern side of the _cortile_ was in good\ncondition, and comfortably fitted up for the occasional use of the\nPrincipe. As he was wintering in Paris, he had let his rooms at an\nordinary commercial rent to his kinswoman, Donna Laura. She, a soured\nand melancholy woman, unmarried in a Latin society which has small use\nor kindness for spinsters, had seized on Marguerite d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--whose\nacquaintance she had made in a Mont d'Or hotel--and was now keeping her\nlike a caged canary that sings for its food.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es was quite willing. So long as she had a sofa on which\nto sit enthroned, a sufficiency of new gowns, a maid, cigarettes,\nbreakfast in bed, and a supply of French novels, she appeared the most\nharmless and engaging of mortals. Her youth had been cruel, disorderly,\nand vicious. It had lasted long; but now, when middle age stood at last\nconfessed, she was lapsing, it seemed, into amiability and good\nbehavior. She was, indeed, fast forgetting her own history, and soon the\nrecital of it would surprise no one so much as herself.\n\nIt was five o'clock. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had just established herself in\nthe silk-panelled drawing-room of Donna Laura's apartment, expectant of\nvisitors, and, in particular, of her daughter.\n\nIn begging Kitty to come on this particular afternoon, she had not\nthought fit to mention that it would be Donna Laura's \"day.\" Had she\ndone so, Kitty, in consideration of her mourning, would perhaps have\ncried off. Whereas, really--poor, dear child!--what she wanted was\ndistraction and amusement.\n\nAnd what Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es wanted was the presence beside her, in public,\nof Lady Kitty Ashe. Kitty had already visited her mother privately, and\nhad explored the antiquities of the Vercelli palace. But Madame\nd'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es was now intent on something more and different.\n\nFor in the four years which had now elapsed since the Ashe's marriage\nthis lively lady had known adversity. She had been forced to leave\nLondon, as we have seen, by the pressure of certain facts in her past\nhistory so ancient and far removed when their true punishment began that\nshe no doubt felt it highly unjust that she should be punished for them\nat all. Her London debts had swallowed up what then remained to her of\nfortune; and, afterwards, the allowance from the Ashes was all she had\nto depend on. Banished to Paris, she fell into a lower stratum of life,\nat a moment when her faithful and mysterious friend, Markham Warington,\nwas held in Scotland by the first painful symptoms of his sister's last\nillness, and could do but little for her. She had, in fact, known the\nsordid shifts and straits of poverty, though the smallest moral effort\nwould have saved her from them. She had kept disreputable company, she\nhad been miserable, and base; and although shame is not easy to persons\nof her temperament, it may perhaps be said that she was ashamed of this\nperiod of her existence. Appeals to the Ashes yielded less and less, and\nWarington seemed to have forsaken her. She awoke at last to a\npanic-stricken fear of darker possibilities and more real suffering than\nany she had yet known, and under the stress of this fear she collapsed\nphysically, writing both to Warington and to the Ashes in a tone of\nmingled reproach and despair.\n\nThe Ashes sent money, and, though Kitty was at the moment not fit to\ntravel, prepared to come. Warington, who had just closed the eyes of his\nsister, went at once. He was now the last of his family, without any\nties that he could not lawfully break. Within two days of his arrival in\nParis, Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had promised to marry him in three months, to\nbreak off all her Paris associations, and to give her life henceforward\ninto his somewhat stern hands. The visit to Venice was part of the price\nthat he had had to pay for her decision. Marguerite pleaded, with a\nshudder, that she must have a little amusement before she went to live\nin Dumfriesshire; and he had been obliged to acquiesce in her\narrangement with Donna Laura--stipulating only that he should be their\nescort and guardian.\n\nWhat had moved him to such an act? His reasons can only be guessed at.\nWarington was a man of religion, a Calvinist by education and\ninheritance, and of a silent and dreamy temperament. He had been\nintimate with very few women in his life. His sister had been a second\nmother to him, and both of them had been the guardians of their younger\nbrother. When this adored brother fell shot through the lungs in the\nhopeless defence of Lady Blackwater's reputation, it would have been\nnatural enough that Markham should hate the woman who had been the\noccasion of such a calamity. The sister, a pious and devoted Christian,\nhad indeed hated her, properly and duly, thenceforward. Markham, on the\ncontrary, accepted his brother's last commission without reluctance. In\nthis matter at least Lady Blackwater had not been directly to blame; his\nmind acquitted her; and her soft, distressed beauty touched his heart.\nBefore he knew where he was she had made an impression upon him that was\nto be life-long.\n\nThen gradually he awoke to a full knowledge of her character. He\nsuffered, but otherwise it made no difference. Finding it was then\nimpossible to persuade her to marry him, he watched over her as best he\ncould for some years, passing through phases of alternate hope and\ndisgust. His sister's affection for him was clouded by his strange\nrelation to the Jezebel who in her opinion had destroyed their brother.\nHe could not help it; he could only do his best to meet both claims upon\nhim. During her lingering passage to the grave, his sister had nearly\nsevered him from Marguerite d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es. She died, however, just in time,\nand now here he was in Venice, passing through what seemed to him one of\nthe ante-rooms of life, leading to no very radiant beyond. But, radiant\nor no, his path lay thither. And at the same time he saw that although\nMarguerite felt him to be her only refuge from poverty and disgrace, she\nwas painfully afraid of him, and afraid of the life into which he was\nleading her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first guest of the afternoon proved to be Louis Harman, the painter\nand dilettante, who had been in former days one of the _habitu\u00c3\u00a9s_ of the\nhouse in St. James's Place. This perfectly correct yet tolerant\ngentleman was wintering in Venice in order to copy the Carpaccios in San\nGiorgio dei Schiavoni. His copies were not good, but they were all\npromised to artistic fair ladies, and the days which the painter spent\nupon them were happy and harmless.\n\nHe came in gayly, delighted to see Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es in flourishing\ncircumstances again, delivered apparently from the abyss into which he\nhad found her sliding on the occasion of various chance visits of his\nown to Paris. Warington's doing, apparently--queer fellow!\n\n\"Well!--I saw Lady Kitty in the Piazza this afternoon,\" he said, as he\nsat down beside his hostess. Donna Laura had not yet appeared. \"Very\nthin and fragile! But, by Jove! how these English beauties hold their\nown.\"\n\n\"Irish, if you please,\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, smiling.\n\nHarman bowed to her correction, admiring at the same time both the\ntoilette and the good looks of his companion. Dropping his voice, he\nasked, with a gingerly and sympathetic air, whether all was now well\nwith the Ashe m\u00c3\u00a9nage. He had been sorry to hear certain gossip of the\nyear before.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es laughed. Yes, she understood that Kitty had behaved\nlike a little goose with that _poseur_ Cliffe. But that was all\nover--long ago.\n\n\"Why, the silly child has everything she wants! William is devoted to\nher--and it can't be long before he succeeds.\"\n\n\"No need to go trifling with poets,\" said Harman, smiling. \"By-the-way,\ndo you know that Geoffrey Cliffe is in Venice?\"\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es opened her eyes. \"Est-il possible? Oh! but Kitty has\nforgotten all about him.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Harman. \"I am told he has been seen with the Ricci.\"\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es raised her shoulders this time in addition to her eyes.\nThen her face clouded.\n\n\"I believe,\" she said, slowly, \"that woman may come here this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Is she a friend of yours?\" Harman's tone expressed his surprise.\n\n\"I knew her in Paris,\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, with some hesitation,\n\"when she was a student at the Conservatoire. She and I had some common\nacquaintance. And now--frankly, I daren't offend her. She has the most\nappalling temper!--and she sticks at nothing.\"\n\nHarman wondered what the exact truth of this might be, but did not\ninquire. And as guests--including Colonel Warington--began to arrive,\nand Donna Laura appeared and began to dispense tea, the _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_\nwas interrupted.\n\nDonna Laura's _salon_ was soon well filled, and Harman watched the\ngathering with curiosity. As far as it concerned Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--and\nshe was clearly the main attraction which had brought it together--it\nrepresented, he saw, a phase of social recovery. A few prominent\nEnglishmen, passing through Venice, came in without their wives, making\nperfunctory excuse for the absence of these ladies. But the\ncosmopolitans of all kinds, who crowded in--Anglo-Italians, foreign\ndiplomats, travellers of many sorts, and a few restless Venetians,\nbearing the great names of old, to whom their own Venice was little more\nthan a place of occasional sojourn--made satisfactory amends for these\npersons of too long memories. In all these travellers' towns, Venice,\nRome, and Florence, there is indeed a society, and a very agreeable\nsociety, which is wholly irresponsible, and asks few or no questions.\nThe elements of it meet as strangers, and as strangers they mostly part.\nBut between the meeting and the parting there lies a moment, all the\ngayer, perhaps, because of its social uncertainty and freedom.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es was profiting by it to the full. She was in excellent\nspirits and talk; bright-rose carnations shone in the bosom of her\ndress; one white arm, bared to the elbow, lay stretched carelessly on\nthe fine cut-velvet which covered the gilt sofa--part of a suite of\nVenetian Louis Quinze, clumsily gorgeous--on which she sat; the other\nhand pulled the ears of a toy spaniel. On the ceiling above her, Tiepolo\nhad painted a headlong group of sensuous forms, alive with vulgar\nmovement and passion; the _putti_ and the goddesses, peering through\na\u00c3\u00abrial balustrades, looked down complacently on Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\nMeanwhile there stood behind her--a silent, distinguished figure--the\nman of whom Harman saw that she was always nervously and sometimes\ntimidly conscious. Harman had been reading Moli\u00c3\u00a8re's _Don Juan_. The\nsentinel figure of Warington mingled in his imagination with the statue\nof the Commander.\n\nOr, again, he was tickled by a vision of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es grown old,\nliving in a Scotch house, turreted and severe, tended by servants of the\n\"Auld Licht,\" or shivering under a faithful minister on Sundays. Had she\nany idea of the sort of fold towards which Warington--at once Covenanter\nand man of the world--was carrying his lost sheep?\n\nThe sheep, however, was still gambolling at large. Occasionally a guest\nappeared who proved it. For instance, at a certain tumultuous entrance,\nbillowing skirts, vast hat, and high-pitched voice all combining in the\neffect, Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es flushed violently, and Warington's stiffness\nredoubled. On the threshold stood the young actress, Mademoiselle Ricci,\na Marseillaise, half French, half Italian, who was at the moment the\ntalk of Venice. Why, would take too long to tell. It was by no means\nmostly due to her talent, which, however, was displayed at the Apollo\ntheatre two or three times a week, and was no doubt considerable. She\nwas a flamboyant lady, with astonishing black eyes, a too transparent\nwhite dress, over which was slung a small black mantilla, a scarlet hat\nand parasol, and a startling fan of the same color. Both before and\nafter her greeting of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es--whom she called her \"ch\u00c3\u00a9rie\" and\nher \"belle Marguerite\"--she created a whirlwind in the _salon_. She was\nnoisy, rude, and false; it could only be said on the other side that she\nwas handsome--for those who admired the kind of thing; and famous--more\nor less. The intimacy of the party was broken up by her, for wherever\nshe was she brought uproar, and it was impossible to forget her. And\nthis uneasy attention which she compelled was at its height when the\ndoor was once more thrown open for the entrance of Lady Kitty Ashe.\n\n\"Ah, my darling Kitty!\" cried Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, rising in a soft\nenthusiasm.\n\nKitty came in slowly, holding herself very erect, a delicate and\ndistinguished figure, in her deep mourning. She frowned as she saw the\ncrowd in the room.\n\n\"I'll come another time!\" she said, hastily, to her mother, beginning to\nretreat.\n\n\"Oh, Kitty!\" cried Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, in distress, holding her fast.\n\nAt that moment Harman, who was watching them both with keenness, saw\nthat Kitty had perceived Mademoiselle Ricci. The actress had paused in\nher chatter to stare at the new-comer. She sat fronting the entrance,\nher head insolently thrown back, knees crossed, a cigarette poised in\nthe plump and dimpled hand.\n\nA start ran through Kitty's small person. She allowed her mother to lead\nher in and introduce her to Donna Laura.\n\n\"Ah-ha, my lady!\" said Harman, to himself. \"Are you, perhaps, interested\nin the Ricci? Is it possible even that you have seen her before?\"\n\nKitty, however, betrayed herself to no one else. To other people it was\nonly evident that she did not mean to be introduced to the actress. She\npointedly and sharply avoided it. This was interpreted as aristocratic\n_hauteur_, and did her no harm. On the contrary, she was soon chattering\nFrench with a group of diplomats, and the centre of the most animated\ngroup in the room. All the new-comers who could attached themselves to\nit, and the actress found herself presently almost deserted. She put up\nher eye-glass, studied Kitty impertinently, and asked a man sitting near\nher for the name of the strange lady.\n\n\"Isn't she lovely, my little Kitty!\" said Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, in the ears\nof a Bavarian baron, who was also much occupied in staring at the small\nbeauty in black. \"I may say it, though I am her mother. And my\nson-in-law, too. Have you seen him? Such a handsome fellow!--and _such_\na dear!--so kind to me. They _say_, you know, that he will be Prime\nMinister.\"\n\nThe baron bowed, ironically, and inquired who the gentleman might be. He\nhad not caught Kitty's name, and Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had been for some time\nlabelled in his mind as something very near to an adventuress.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es eagerly explained, and he bowed again, with a\ndifference. He was a man of great intelligence, acquainted with English\npolitics. So that was _really_ the wife of the man to whose personality\nand future the London correspondent of the _Allgemeine Zeitung_ had\nwithin the preceding week devoted a particularly interesting article,\nwhich he had read with attention. His estimate of Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es'\nplace in the world altered at once. Yet it was strange that she--or,\nrather, Donna Laura--should admit such a person as Mademoiselle Ricci to\ntheir _salon_.\n\nThe mother, indeed, that afternoon had much reason to be socially\ngrateful to the daughter. Curious contrast with the days when Kitty had\nbeen the mere troublesome appendage of her mother's life! It was clear\nto Marguerite d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es now that if she was to accept restraint and\nvirtuous living, if she was to submit to this marriage she dreaded, yet\nsaw no way to escape, her best link with the gay world in the future\nmight well be through the Ashes. Kitty could do a great deal for her;\nlet her cultivate Kitty; and begin, perhaps, by convincing William Ashe\non this present occasion that for once she was not going to ask him for\nmoney.\n\nIn the height of the party, Lord Magellan appeared. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es at\nfirst looked at him with bewilderment, till Kitty, shaking herself free,\ncame hastily forward to introduce him. At the name the mother's face\nflashed into smiles. The ramifications of two or three aristocracies\nrepresented the only subject she might be said to know. Dear Kitty!\n\nLord Magellan, after Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es had talked to him about his family\nin a few light and skilful phrases, which suggested knowledge, while\navoiding flattery, was introduced to the Bavarian baron and a French\nnaval officer. But he was not interesting to them, nor they to him;\nKitty was surrounded and unapproachable; and a flood of new arrivals\ndistracted Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es' attention. The Ricci, who had noticed the\nrestrained _empressement_ of his reception, pounced on the young man,\ntaming her ways and gestures to what she supposed to be his English\nprudery, and produced an immediate effect upon him. Lord Magellan, who\nwas only dumb with English marriageable girls, allowed himself to be\namused, and threw himself into a low chair by the actress--a capture\napparently for the afternoon.\n\nLouis Harman was sitting behind Kitty, a little to her right. He saw her\nwatching the actress and her companion; noticed a compression of the\nlip, a flash in the eye. She sprang up, said she must go home, and\npractically dissolved the party.\n\nMademoiselle Ricci, who had also risen, proposed to Lord Magellan that\nshe should take him in her gondola to the shop of a famous dealer on the\nCanal.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Lord Magellan, irresolute, and he looked at\nKitty. The look apparently decided him, for he immediately added that he\nhad unfortunately an engagement in the opposite direction. The actress\nangrily drew herself up, and proposed a later appointment. Then Kitty\ncarelessly intervened.\n\n\"Do you remember that you promised to see me home?\" she said to the\nyoung man. \"Don't if it bores you!\"\n\nLord Magellan eagerly protested. Kitty moved away, and he followed her.\n\n\"Ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame, will you present me to your daughter?\" said the Ricci, in\nan unnecessarily loud voice.\n\nMadame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, with a flurried gesture, touched Kitty on the arm.\n\n\"Kitty, Mademoiselle Ricci.\"\n\nKitty took no notice. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es said, quickly, in a low,\nimploring voice:\n\n\"Please, dear Kitty. I'll explain.\"\n\nKitty turned abruptly, looked at her mother, and at the woman to whom\nshe was to be introduced.\n\n\"Ah! comme elle est charmante!\" cried the actress, with an inflection of\nirony in her strident voice. \"Miladi, il faut absolument que nous nous\nconnaissions. Je connais votre ch\u00c3\u00a8re m\u00c3\u00a8re depuis si longtemps! \u00c3\u0080 Paris,\nl'hiver pass\u00c3\u00a9 c'\u00c3\u00a9tait une amiti\u00c3\u00a9 des plus tendres!\"\n\nThe nasal drag she gave to the words was partly natural, partly\ninsolent. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es bit her lip.\n\n\"Oui?\" said Kitty, indifferently. \"Je n'en avais jamais entendu parler.\"\n\nHer brilliant eyes studied the woman before her. \"She has some hold on\nmaman,\" she said to herself, in disgust. \"She knows of something shady\nthat maman has done.\" Then another thought stung her; and with the most\nindifferent bow, triumphing in the evident offence that she was giving,\nshe turned to Lord Magellan.\n\n\"You'd like to see the Palazzo?\"\n\nWarington at once offered himself as a guide.\n\nBut Kitty declared she knew the way, would just show Lord Magellan the\n_piano nobile_, dismiss him at the grand staircase, and return. Lord\nMagellan made his farewells.\n\nAs Kitty passed through the door of the _salon_, while the young man\nheld back the velvet _porti\u00c3\u00a8re_ which hung over it, she was aware that\nMademoiselle Ricci was watching her. The Marseillaise was leaning\nheavily on a _fauteuil_, supported by a hand behind her. A slow,\ndisdainful smile played about her lips, some evil threatening thought\nexpressed itself through every feature of her rounded, coarsened beauty.\nKitty's sharp look met hers, and the curtain dropped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Don't, please, let that woman take you anywhere--to see anything!\" said\nKitty, with energy, to her companion, as they walked through the rooms\nof the _mezzanino_.\n\nLord Magellan laughed. \"What's the matter with her?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\" said Kitty, impatiently, \"except that she's wicked--and\ncommon--and a snake--and your mother would have a fit if she knew you\nhad anything to do with her.\"\n\nThe red-haired youth looked grave.\n\n\"Thank you, Lady Kitty,\" he said, quietly. \"I'll take your advice.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, what a nice boy you are!\" cried Kitty, impulsively, laying a\nhand a moment on his shoulder. And then, as though his filial instinct\nhad awakened hers, she added, with hasty falsehood: \"Maman, of course,\nknows nothing about her. That was just bluff what she said. But Donna\nLaura oughtn't to ask such people. There--that's the way.\"\n\nAnd she pointed to a small staircase in the wall, whereof the trap-door\nat the top was open. They climbed it, and found themselves at once in\none of the great rooms of the _piano nobile_, to which this quick and\neasy access from the inhabited _entresol_ had been but recently\ncontrived.\n\n\"What a marvellous place!\" cried Lord Magellan, looking round him.\n\nThey were in the principal apartment of the famous Vercelli palace, a\nlegacy from one of those classical architects whose work may be seen in\nthe late seventeenth-century buildings of Venice. The rooms, enormously\nhigh, panelled here and there in tattered velvets and brocades, or\nfrescoed in fast-fading scenes of old Venetian life, stretched in\nbewildering succession on either side of a central passage or broad\ncorridor, all of them leading at last on the northern side to a vast\nhall painted in architectural perspective by the pupils of Tiepolo, and\noverarched by a ceiling in which the master himself had massed a\nmultitude of forms equal to Rubens in variety and facility of design,\nexpressed in a thin trenchancy of style. Figures recalling the ancient\ntriumphs and possessions of Venice, in days when she sat dishonored and\ndespoiled, crowded the coved roof, the painted cornices and pediments.\nGayly colored birds hovered in blue skies; philosophers and poets in\ngrisaille made a strange background for large-limbed beauties couched on\nroses, or young warriors amid trophies of shining arms; and while all\nthis garrulous commonplace lived and breathed above, the walls below,\ncold in color and academic in treatment, maintained as best they could\nthe dignity of the vast place, thus given up to one of the greatest of\nartists and emptiest of minds.\n\nOn the floor of this magnificent hall stood a few old and broken chairs.\nBut the candelabra of glass and ormolu, hanging from the ceiling, were\nvery nearly of the date of the palace, and superb. Meanwhile, through a\nfaded taffeta of a golden-brown shade, the afternoon light from the high\nwindows to the southwest poured into the stately room.\n\n\"How it dwarfs us!\" said Lord Magellan, looking at his companion. \"One\nfeels the merest pygmy! From the age of decadence indeed!\" He glanced at\nthe guide-book in his hand. \"Good Heavens!--if this was their decay,\nwhat was their bloom?\"\n\n\"Yes--it's big--and jolly. I like it,\" said Kitty, absently. Then she\nrecollected herself. \"This is your way out. Federigo!\" she called to an\nold man, the _custode_ of the palace, who appeared at the magnificent\ndoor leading to the grand staircase.\n\n\"Commanda, eccellenza!\" The old man, bent and feeble, approached. He\ncarried a watering-pot wherewith he was about to minister to some\nstraggling flowers in the windows fronting the Grand Canal. A thin cat\nrubbed itself against his legs. As he stood in his shabbiness under the\nhigh, carved door, the only permanent denizen of the building, he seemed\nan embodiment of the old shrunken Venetian life, still haunting a city\nit was no longer strong enough to use.\n\n\"Will you show this signor the way out?\" said Kitty, in tourists'\nItalian. \"Are you soon shutting up?\"\n\nFor the main palazzo, which during the day was often shown to\nsightseers, was locked at half-past five, only the two _entresols_--one\ntenanted by Donna Laura, the other by the _custode_--remaining\naccessible.\n\nThe old man murmured something which Kitty did not understand, pointing\nat the same time to a door leading to the interior of the _piano\nnobile_. Kitty thought that he asked her to be quick, if she wished\nstill to go round the palace. She tried to explain that he might lock up\nif he pleased; her way of retreat to the _mezzanino_, down the small\nstaircase, was always open. Federigo looked puzzled, again said\nsomething in unintelligible Venetian, and led the way to the grand\nstaircase followed by Lord Magellan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA heavy door clanged below. Kitty was alone. She looked round her, at\nthe stretches of marble floor, and the streaks of pale sunshine that lay\nupon its black and white, at the lofty walls painted with a dim superb\narchitecture, at the crowded ceiling, the gorgeous candelabra. With its\ncostly decoration, the great room suggested a rich and festal life;\nthronging groups below answering to the Tiepolo groups above; beauties\npatched and masked; gallants in brocaded coats; splendid senators, robed\nlike William at the fancy ball.\n\nSuddenly she caught sight of herself in one of the high and narrow\nmirrors that filled the spaces between the windows. In her mourning\ndress, with the light behind her, she made a tiny spectre in the immense\nhall. The image of her present self--frail, black-robed--recalled the\ntwo figures in the glass of her Hill Street room--the sparkling white of\nher goddess dress, and William's smiling face above hers, his arm round\nher waist.\n\nHow happy she had been that night! Even her wild fury with Mary Lyster\nseemed to her now a kind of happiness. How gladly would she have\nexchanged for it either of the two terrors that now possessed her!\n\nWith a shiver she crossed the hall, and pushed her way into the suite of\nrooms on the northern side. She felt herself in absolute possession of\nthe palace. Federigo no doubt had locked up; her mother and a few guests\nwere still talking in the _salon_ of the _mezzanine_, expecting her to\nreturn. She would return--soon; but the solitariness and wildness of\nthis deserted place drew her on.\n\nRoom after room opened before her--bare, save for a few worm-eaten\nchairs, a fragment of tapestry on the wall, or some tattered portraits\nin the Longhi manner, indifferent to begin with, and long since ruined\nby neglect. Yet here and there a young face looked out, roses in the\nhair and at the breast; or a Doge's cap--and beneath it phantom features\nstill breathing even in the last decay of canvas and paint the violence\nand intrigue of the living man--the ghost of character held there by\nthe ghost of art. Or a lad in slashed brocade, for whom even in this\nsilent palace, and in spite of the gaping crack across his face, life\nwas still young; a cardinal; a nun; a man of letters in clerical dress,\nthe Abb\u00c3\u00a9 Pr\u00c3\u00a9vost of his day....\n\nPresently she found herself in a wide corridor, before a high, closed\ndoor. She tried it, and saw a staircase mounting and descending. A\npassion of curiosity that was half romance, half restlessness, drove her\non. She began to ascend the marble steps, hearing only the echo of her\nown movements, a little afraid of the cold spaces of the vast house, and\nyet delighting in the fancies that crowded upon her. At the top of the\nflight she found, of course, another apartment, on the same plan as the\none below, but smaller and less stately. The central hall entered from a\ndoor supported by marble caryatids, was flagged in yellow marble, and\nfrescoed freely with faded eighteenth-century scenes--cardinals walking\nin stiff gardens, a pope alighting from his coach, surrounded by\npeasants on their knees, and behind him fountains and obelisk and the\ntowering fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of St. Peter's. At the moment, thanks to a last glow of\nlight coming in through a west window at the farther end, it was a place\nbeautiful though forlorn. But the rooms into which she looked on either\nside were wreck and desolation itself, crowded with broken furniture,\nmany of them shuttered and dark.\n\nAs she closed the last door, her attention was caught by a strange bust\nplaced on a pedestal above the entrance. What was wrong with it? An\naccident? An injury? She went nearer, straining her eyes to see.\nNo!--there was no injury. The face indeed was gone. Or, rather, where\nthe face should have been there now descended a marble veil from brow to\nbreast, of the most singular and sinister effect. Otherwise the bust was\nthat of a young and beautiful woman. A pleasing horror seized on Kitty\nas she looked. Her fancy hunted for the clew. A faithless wife, blotted\nfrom her place?--made infamous forever by the veil which hid from human\neye the beauty she had dishonored? Or a beloved mistress, on whom the\nmourning lover could no longer bear to look--the veil an emblem of\nundying and irremediable grief?\n\nKitty stood enthralled, striving to pierce the ghastly meaning of the\nbust, when a sound--a distant sound--a shock through her. She heard a\nstep overhead, in the topmost apartment, or _mansarde_ of the palace, a\nstep that presently traversed the whole length of the floor immediately\nabove her head and began to descend the stair.\n\nStrange! Federigo must have shut the great gates by this time--as she\nhad bade him? He himself inhabited the smaller _entresol_ on the farther\nside of the palace, far away. Other inhabitants there were none; so\nDonna Laura had assured her.\n\nThe step approached, resonant in the silence. Kitty, seized with nervous\nfright, turned and ran down the broad staircase by which she had come,\nthrough the series of deserted rooms in the _piano nobile_, till she\nreached the great hall.\n\nThere she paused, panting, curiosity and daring once more getting the\nupperhand. The door she had just passed through, which gave access to\nthe staircase, opened again and shut. The stranger who had entered came\nleisurely towards the hall, lingering apparently now and then to look at\nobjects on the way. Presently a voice--an exclamation.\n\nKitty retreated, caught at the arm of a chair for support, clung to it\ntrembling. A man entered, holding his hat in one hand and a small white\nglove in the other.\n\nAt sight of the lady in black, standing on the other side of the hall,\nhe started violently--and stopped. Then, just as Kitty, who had so far\nmade neither sound nor movement, took the first hurried step towards the\nstaircase by which she had entered, Geoffrey Cliffe came forward.\n\n\"How do you do, Lady Kitty? Do not, I beg of you, let me disturb you. I\nhad half an hour to spare, and I gave the old man down-stairs a franc or\ntwo, that he might let me wander over this magnificent old place by\nmyself for a bit. I have always had a fancy for deserted houses. You, I\ngather, have it, too. I will not interfere with you for a moment. Before\nI go, however, let me return what I believe to be your property.\"\n\nHe came nearer, with a studied, deliberate air, and held out the white\nglove. She saw it was her own and accepted it.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nShe bowed with all the haughtiness she could muster, though her limbs\nshook under her. Then as she walked quickly towards the door of exit,\nCliffe, who was nearer to it than she, also moved towards it, and threw\nit open for her. As she approached him he said, quietly:\n\n\"This is not the first time we have met in Venice, Lady Kitty.\"\n\nShe wavered, could not avoid looking at him, and stood arrested. That\nalmost white head!--that furrowed brow!--those haggard eyes! A slight,\ninvoluntary cry broke from her lips.\n\nCliffe smiled. Then he straightened his tall figure.\n\n\"You see, perhaps, that I have not grown younger. You are quite right. I\nhave left my youth--what remained of it--among those splendid fellows\nwhom the Turks have been harrying and torturing. Well!--they were worth\nit. I would give it them again.\"\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\nThe eyes of each perused the other's face. Kitty began some words, and\nleft them unfinished. Cliffe resumed--in another tone--while the door he\nheld swung gently backward, his hand following it.\n\n\"I spent last winter, as perhaps you know, with the Bosnian insurgents\nin the mountains. It was a tough business--hardships I should never have\nhad the pluck to face if I had known what was before me. Then, in July,\nI got fever. I had to come away, to find a doctor, and I was a long time\nat Cattaro pulling round. And, meanwhile, the Turks--God blast\nthem!--have been at their fiends' work. Half my particular friends, with\nwhom I spent the winter, have been hacked to pieces since I left them.\"\n\nShe wavered, held by his look, by the coercion of that mingled passion\nand indifference with which he spoke. There was in his manner no\nsuggestion whatever of things behind, no reference to herself or to the\npast between them. His passion, it seemed, was for his comrades; his\nindifference for her. What had he to do with her any more? He had been\namong the realities of battle and death, while she had been mincing and\nambling along the usual feminine path. That was the utterance, it\nseemed, of the man's whole manner and personality, and nothing could\nhave more effectually recalled Kitty's wild nature to the lure.\n\n\"Are you going back?\" She had turned from him and was pulling at the\nfingers of the glove he had picked up.\n\n\"Of course! I am only kicking my heels here till I can collect the money\nand stores--ay, and the _men_--I want. I give my orders in London, and I\nmust be here to see to the transshipment of stores and the embarkation\nof my small force! Not meant for the newspapers, you see, Lady\nKitty--these little details!\"\n\nHe drew himself up smiling, his worn aspect expressing just that\nmingling of dare-devil adventure with subtler and more self-conscious\nthings which gave edge and power to his personality.\n\n\"I heard you were wounded,\" said Kitty, abruptly.\n\n\"So I was--badly. We were defending a _polje_--one of their high\nmountain valleys, against a Beg and his troops. My left arm\"--he pointed\nto the black sling in which it was still held--\"was nearly cut to\npieces. However, it is practically well.\"\n\nHe took it out of the sling and showed that he could use it. Then his\nexpression changed. He stepped back to the door, and opened it\nceremoniously.\n\n\"Don't, however, let me delay you, Lady Kitty--by my chatter.\"\n\nKitty's cheeks were crimson. Her momentary yielding vanished in a\npassion of scorn. What!--he knew that she had seen him before, seen him\nwith that woman--and he dared to play the mere shattered hero, kept in\nVenice by these crusader's reasons!\n\n\"Have you another volume on the way?\" she asked him, as she advanced. \"I\nread your last.\"\n\nHer smile was the smile of an enemy. He eyed her strangely.\n\n\"Did you? That was waste of time.\"\n\n\"I think you intended I should read it.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Lady Kitty, those things are very far away. I can't defend myself--for\nthey seem wiped out.\" He had crossed his arms, and was leaning back\nagainst the open door, a fine, rugged figure, by no means repentant.\n\nKitty laughed.\n\n\"You overstate the difference!\"\n\n\"Between the past and the present? What does that mean?\"\n\nShe dropped her eyes a moment, then raised them.\n\n\"Do you often go to San Lazzaro?\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"I had a suspicion that the vision at the window--though it was there\nonly an instant--was you! So you saw Mademoiselle Ricci?\"\n\nHis tone was assurance itself. Kitty disdained to answer. Her slight\ngesture bade him let her pass through; but he ignored it.\n\n\"I find her kind, Lady Kitty. She listens to me--I get sympathy from\nher.\"\n\n\"And you want sympathy?\"\n\nHer tone stung him. \"As a hungry man wants food --as an artist wants\nbeauty. But I know where I shall _not_ get it.\"\n\n\"That is always a gain!\" said Kitty, throwing back her little head. \"Mr.\nCliffe, pray let me bid you good-bye.\"\n\nHe suddenly made a step forward. \"Lady Kitty!\"--his deep-set, imperious\neyes searched her face--\"I can't restrain myself. Your look--your\nexpression--go to my heart. Laugh at me if you like. It's true. What\nhave you been doing with yourself?\"\n\nHe bent towards her, scrutinizing every delicate feature, and, as it\nseemed, shaken with agitation. She breathed fast.\n\n\"Mr. Cliffe, you must know that any sympathy from you to me--is an\ninsult! Kindly let me pass.\"\n\nHe, too, flushed deeply.\n\n\"Insult is a hard word, Lady Kitty. I regret that poem.\"\n\nShe swept forward in silence, but he still stood in the way.\n\n\"I wrote it--almost in delirium. Ah, well\"--he shook his head\nimpatiently--\"if you don't believe me, let it be. I am not the man I\nwas. The perspective of things is altered for me.\" His voice fell.\n\"Women and children in their blood--heroic trust--and brute hate--the\nstars for candles--the high peaks for friends--those things have come\nbetween me and the past. But you are right; we had better not talk any\nmore. I hear old Federigo coming up the stairs. Good-night, Lady\nKitty--good-night!\"\n\nHe opened the door. She passed him, and, to her own intense annoyance, a\nbunch of pale roses she carried at her belt brushed against the\ndoorway, so that one broke and fell. She turned to pick it up, but it\nwas already in Cliffe's hand. She held out hers, threateningly.\n\n\"I think not.\" He put it in his pocket. \"Here is Federigo. Good-night.\"\n\nIt was quite dark when Kitty reached home. She groped her way up-stairs\nand opened the door of the _salon_. So weary was she that she dropped\ninto the first chair, not seeing at first that any one was in the room.\nThen she caught sight of a brown-paper parcel, apparently just\nunfastened, on the table, and within it three books, of similar shape\nand size. A movement startled her.\n\n\"William!\"\n\nAshe rose slowly from the deep chair in which he had been sitting. His\naspect seemed to her terrified eyes utterly and wholly changed. In his\nhand he held a book like those on the table, and a paper-cutter. His\nface expressed the remote abstraction of a man who has been wrestling\nhis way through some hard contest of the mind.\n\nShe ran to him. She wound her arms round him.\n\n\"William, William! I didn't mean any harm! I didn't! Oh, I have been so\nmiserable! I tried to stop it--I did all I could. I have hardly slept at\nall--since we talked--you remember? Oh, William, look at me! Don't be\nangry with me!\"\n\nAshe disengaged himself.\n\n\"I have asked Blanche to pack for me to-night, Kitty. I go home by the\nearly train to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Home!\"\n\nShe stood petrified; then a light flashed into her face.\n\n\"You'll buy it all up? You'll stop it, William?\"\n\nAshe drew himself together.\n\n\"I am going home,\" he said, with slow decision, \"to place my resignation\nin the hands of Lord Parham.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nKitty fell back in silence, staring at William. She loosened her mantle\nand threw it off, then she sat down in a chair near the wood fire, and\nbent over it, shivering.\n\n\"Of course you didn't mean that, William?\" she said, at last.\n\nAshe turned.\n\n\"I should not have said it unless I had meant every word of it. It is,\nof course, the only thing to be done.\"\n\nKitty looked at him miserably. \"But you _can't_ mean that--that you'll\nresign because of that book?\"\n\nShe pulled it towards her and turned over the pages with a hand that\ntrembled. \"That would be too foolish!\"\n\nAshe made no reply. He was standing before the fire, with his hands in\nhis pockets, and a face half absent, half ironical, as though his mind\nfollowed the sequences of a far distant future.\n\n\"William!\" She caught the sleeve of his coat with a little cry. \"I wrote\nthat book because I thought it would help you.\"\n\nHis attention came back to her.\n\n\"Yes, Kitty, I believe you did.\"\n\nShe gulped down a sob. His tone was so odd, so remote.\n\n\"Many people have done such things. I know they have. Why--why, it was\nonly meant--as a skit--to make people laugh! There's _no_ harm in it,\nWilliam.\"\n\nAshe, without speaking, took up the book and looked back at certain\npages, which he seemed to have marked. Kitty's feeling as she watched\nhim was the feeling of the condemned culprit, held dumb and strangled in\nthe grip of his own sense of justice, and yet passionately conscious how\nmuch more he could say for himself than anybody is ever likely to say\nfor him.\n\n\"When did you have the first idea of this book, Kitty?\"\n\n\"About a year ago,\" she said, in a low voice.\n\n\"In October? At Haggart?\"\n\nKitty nodded.\n\nAshe thought. Her admission took him back to the autumn weeks at\nHaggart, after the Cliffe crisis and the rearrangement of the ministry\nin the July of that year. He well remembered that those weeks had been\nweeks of special happiness for both of them. Afterwards, the winter had\nbrought many renewed qualms and vexations. But in that period, between\nthe storms of the session and Kitty's escapades in the hunting-field,\nmemory recalled a tender, melting time--a time rich in hidden and\nexquisite hours, when with Kitty on his breast, lip to lip and heart to\nheart, he had reaped, as it seemed to him, the fruits of that indulgence\nwhich, as he knew, his mother scorned. And at that very moment, behind\nhis back, out of his sight, she had begun this atrocious thing.\n\nHe looked at her again--the bitterness almost at his lips, almost beyond\nhis control.\n\n\"I wish I knew what could have been your possible object in writing\nit?\"\n\nShe sat up and confronted him. The color flamed back again into her pale\ncheeks.\n\n\"You know I told you--when we had that talk in London--that I wanted to\nwrite. I thought it would be good for me--would take my thoughts\noff--well, what had happened. And I began to write this--and it amused\nme to find I could do it--and I suppose I got carried away. I loved\ndescribing you, and glorifying you--and I loved making caricatures of\nLady Parham--and all the people I hated. I used to work at it whenever\nyou were away--or I was dull and there was nothing to do.\n\n\"Did it never occur to you,\" said Ashe, interrupting, \"that it might get\nyou--get us both--into trouble, and that you ought to tell me?\"\n\nShe wavered.\n\n\"No!\" she said, at last. \"I never did mean to tell you, while I was\nwriting it. You know I don't tell lies, William! The real fact is, I was\nafraid you'd stop it.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" He threw up his hands with a sound of amazement, then thrust\nthem again into his pockets and began to pace up and down.\n\n\"But then\"--she resumed--\"I thought you'd soon get over it, and that it\nwas funny--and everybody would laugh--and you'd laugh--and there would\nbe an end of it.\"\n\nHe turned and stared at her. \"Frankly, Kitty--I don't understand what\nyou can be made of! You imagined that that sketch of Lord Parham\"--he\nstruck the open page--\"a sketch written by _my wife_, describing my\nofficial chief--when he was my guest--under my own roof--with all sorts\nof details of the most intimate and offensive kind--mocking his\nspeech--his manners--his little personal ways--charging him with being\nthe corrupt tool of Lady Parham, disloyal to his colleagues, a man not\nto be trusted--and justifying all this by a sort of evidence that you\ncould only have got as my wife and Lord Parham's hostess--you actually\nsupposed that you could write and publish _that!_--without in the first\nplace its being plain to every Tom, Dick, and Harry that you had written\nit--and in the next, without making it impossible for your husband to\nremain a colleague of the man you had treated in such a way? Kitty!--you\nare not a stupid woman! Do you really mean to say that you could write\nand publish this book without _knowing_ that you were doing a wrong\naction--which, so far from serving me, could only damage my career\nirreparably? Did nothing--did no one warn you--if you were determined to\nkeep such a secret from your husband, whom it most concerned?\"\n\nHe had come to stand beside her, both hands on the back of a\nchair--stooping forward to emphasize his words--the lines of his fine\nface and noble brow contracted by anger and pain.\n\n\"Mr. Darrell warned me,\" said Kitty, in a low voice, as though those\nimperious eyes compelled the truth from her--\"but of course I didn't\nbelieve him.\"\n\n\"Darrell!\" cried Ashe, in amazement--\"Darrell! You confided in him?\"\n\n\"I told him all about it. It was he who took it to a publisher.\"\n\n\"Hound!\" said Ashe, between his teeth. \"So that was his revenge.\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't blame him too much,\" said Kitty, proudly, not\nunderstanding the remark. \"He wrote to me not long ago to say it was\nhorribly unwise--and that he washed his hands of it.\"\n\n\"Ay--when he'd done the deed! When did you show it him?\" said Ashe,\nimpetuously.\n\n\"At Haggart--in August.\"\n\n\"_Et tu, Brute!_\" said Ashe, turning away. \"Well, that's done with. Now\nthe only thing to do is to face the music. I go home. Whatever can be\ndone to withdraw the book from circulation I shall, of course, do; but I\ngather from this precious letter\"--he held up the note which had been\nenclosed in the parcel--\"that some thousands of copies have already been\nordered by the booksellers, and a few distributed to 'persons in high\nplaces.'\"\n\n\"William,\" she said, in despair, catching his arm again--\"listen! I\noffered the man two hundred pounds only yesterday to stop it.\"\n\nAshe laughed.\n\n\"What did he reply?\"\n\n\"He said it was impossible. Fifty copies had been already issued.\"\n\n\"The review copies, no doubt. By next week there will be, I should say,\nfive thousand in the shops. Your man understands his business, Kitty.\nThis is the kind of puff preliminary he has been scattering about.\"\n\nAnd with sparkling eyes he handed to her a printed slip containing an\noutline of the book for the information of the booksellers.\n\nIt drew attention to the extraordinary interest of the production as a\npainting of the upper class by the hand of one belonging to its inmost\ncircle. \"People of the highest social and political importance will be\nrecognized at once; the writer handles cabinet ministers and their wives\nwith equal freedom, and with a touch betraying the closest and most\nintimate knowledge. Details hitherto quite unknown to the public of\nministerial combinations and intrigues--especially of the feminine\ninfluences involved--will be found here in their lightest and most\namusing form. A certain famous fancy ball will be identified without\ndifficulty. Scathing as some of the portraits are, the writer is by no\nmeans merely cynical. The central figure of the book is a young and\nrising statesman, whose aim and hopes are touched with a loving\nhand--the charm of the portrait being only equalled by the venom with\nwhich the writer assails those who have thwarted or injured his hero.\nBut our advice is simply--'Buy and Read!' Conjecture will run wild about\nthe writer. All we can say is that the most romantic or interesting\nsurmise that can possibly be formed will fall far short of the reality.\"\n\n\"The beast is a shrewd beast!\" said Ashe, as he raised himself from the\nstooping position in which he had been following the sentences over\nKitty's shoulder. \"He knows that the public will rush for his wares! How\nmuch money did he offer you, Kitty?\"\n\nHe turned sharply on his heel to wait for her reply.\n\n\"A hundred pounds,\" said Kitty, almost inaudibly--\"and a hundred more if\nfive thousand sold.\" She had returned again to her crouching attitude\nover the fire.\n\n\"Generous!--upon my word!\" said Ashe, scornfully turning over the two\nthick-leaved, loosely printed Mudie volumes. \"A guinea to the public, I\nsuppose--fifteen shillings to the trade. Darrell didn't exactly advise\nyou to advantage, Kitty.\"\n\nKitty kept silence. The sarcastic violence of his tone fell on her like\na blow. She seemed to shrink together; while Ashe resumed his walk to\nand fro.\n\nPresently, however, she looked up, to ask, in a voice that tried for\nsteadiness:\n\n\"What do you mean to do--exactly--William?\"\n\n\"I shall, of course, buy up all I can; I shall employ some lawyer\nfellow, and appeal to the good feelings of the newspapers. There will be\nno trouble with the respectable ones. But some copies will get out, and\nsome of the Opposition newspapers will make capital out of them.\nNaturally!--they'd be precious fools if they didn't.\"\n\nA momentary hope sprang up in Kitty.\n\n\"But if you buy it up--and stop all the papers that matter,\" she\nfaltered--\"why should you resign, William? There won't be--such great\nharm done.\"\n\nFor answer he opened the book, and without speaking pointed to two\npassages--the first, an account full of point and malice of the\nnegotiations between himself and Lord Parham at the time when he entered\nthe cabinet, the conditions he himself had made, and the confidential\ncomments of the Premier on the men and affairs of the moment.\n\n\"Do you remember the night when I told you those things, Kitty?\"\n\nYes, Kitty remembered well. It was a night of intimate talk between man\nand wife, a night when she had shown him her sweetest, tenderest mood,\nand he--incorrigible optimist!--had persuaded himself that she was\ngrowing as wise as she was lovely.\n\nHer lip trembled. Then he pointed to the second--to the pitiless picture\nof Lord Parham at Haggart.\n\n\"You wrote that--when he was under our roof--there by our pressing\ninvitation! You couldn't have written it--unless he had so put himself\nin your power. A wandering Arab, Kitty, will do no harm to the man who\nhas eaten and drunk in his tent!\"\n\nShe looked up, and as she read his face she understood at last how what\nshe had done had outraged in him all the natural and all the inherited\ninstincts of a generous and fastidious nature. The \"great gentleman,\" so\nstrong in him as in all the best of English statesmen, whether they\nspring from the classes or the masses, was up in arms.\n\nShe sprang to her feet with a cry. \"William, you can't give up politics!\nIt would make you miserable.\"\n\n\"That can't be helped. And I couldn't go on like this, Kitty--even if\nthis affair of the book could be patched up. The strain's too great.\"\n\nThey were but a yard apart, and yet she seemed to be looking at him\nacross a gulf.\n\n\"You have been so happy in your work!\" This time the sob escaped her.\n\n\"Oh, don't let's talk about that,\" he said, abruptly, as he walked away.\n\"There'll be a certain relief in giving up the impossible. I'll go back\nto my books. We can travel, I suppose, and put politics out of our\nheads.\"\n\n\"But--you won't resign your seat?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, after a pause--\"no. As far as I can see at present, I\nsha'n't resign my seat, though my constituents, of course, will be very\nsick. But I doubt whether I shall stand again.\"\n\nEvery phrase fell as though with a thud on Kitty's ear. It was the wreck\nof a man's life, and she had done it.\n\n\"Shall you--shall you go and see Lord Parham?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\n\"I shall write to him first. I imagine\"--he pointed to the letter lying\non the table--\"that creature has already sent him the book. Then later I\ndaresay I shall see him.\"\n\nShe looked up.\n\n\"If I wrote and told him it was all my doing, William?--if I grovelled\nto him?\"\n\n\"The responsibility is mine,\" he said, sternly. \"I had no business to\ntell even you the things printed there. I told them at my own risk. If\nanything I say has any weight with you, Kitty, you will write nothing.\"\n\nShe spread out her hands to the fire again, and he heard her say, as\nthough to herself:\n\n\"The thing is--the awful thing is, that I'm mad--I must be mad. I never\nthought of all this when I was writing it. I wrote it in a kind of\ndream. In the first place, I wanted to glorify you--\"\n\nHe broke into an exclamation.\n\n\"Your _taste_, Kitty!--where was your taste? That a wife should praise a\nhusband in public! You could only make us both laughing-stocks.\"\n\nHis handsome features quivered a little. He felt this part of it the\nmost galling, the most humiliating of all; and she understood. In his\neyes she had shown herself not only reckless and treacherous, but\nindelicate, vulgar, capable of besmirching the most sacred and intimate\nof relations.\n\nShe rose from her seat.\n\n\"I must go and take my things off,\" she said, in \"a vague voice,\" and as\nshe moved she tottered a little. He turned to look at her. Amid his own\ncrushing sense of defeat and catastrophe, his natural and righteous\nindignation, he remembered that she had been ill--he remembered their\nchild. But whether from the excitement, first of the meeting in the\nVercelli palace, and now of this scene--or merely from the heat of the\nfire over which she had been hanging, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes\nblazed. Her beauty had never been more evident; but it made little\nappeal to him; it was the wild, ungovernable beauty from which he had\nsuffered. He saw that she was excited, but there was an air also of\nreturning physical vigor; and the nascent feeling which might have been\nstrengthened by pallor and prostration died away.\n\nKitty moved as though to pass him and go to her room, which opened out\nof the _salon_. But as she neared him she suddenly caught him by the\narm.\n\n\"William!--William! don't do it!--don't resign! Let me apologize!\"\n\nHe was angered by her persistence, and merely said, coldly:\n\n\"I have given you my reasons, Kitty, why such a course is impossible.\"\n\n\"And--and you start to-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"By the early train. Please let me go, Kitty. There are many things to\narrange. I must order the gondola, and see if the people here can cash\nme a check.\"\n\n\"You mean--to leave me alone?\" The words had a curious emphasis.\n\n\"I had a few words with Miss French before you came in. The packet\narrived by the evening post, and seeing that it was books--for you--I\nopened it. After about an hour\"--he turned and walked away again--\"I saw\nmy bearings. Then I called Miss French, told her I should have to go\nto-morrow, and asked her how long she could stay with you.\"\n\n\"William!\" cried Kitty again, leaning heavily on the table beside\nher--\"don't go!--don't leave me!\"\n\nHis face darkened.\n\n\"So you would prevent me from taking the only honorable, the only decent\nway out of this thing that remains to me?\"\n\nShe made no immediate reply. She stood--wrapped apparently in painful\nabstraction--a creature lovely and distraught. The masses of her fair\nhair loosened by the breeze on the canal had fallen about her cheeks and\nshoulders; her black hat framed the white brow and large, feverish eyes;\nand the sable cape she had worn in the gondola had slipped down over the\nthin, sloping shoulders, revealing the young figure and the slender\nwaist. She might have been a child of seventeen, grieving over the death\nof her goldfinch.\n\nAshe gathered together his official letters and papers, found his\ncheck-book, and began to write. While he wrote he explained that Miss\nFrench could keep her company at least another fortnight, that he could\nleave with them four or five circular notes for immediate expenses, and\nwould send more from home directly he arrived.\n\nIn the middle of his directions Kitty once more appealed to him in a\npassionate, muffled voice not to go. This time he lost his temper, and\nwithout answering her he hastily left the room to arrange his packing\nwith his valet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he returned to the _salon_ Kitty was not there. He and Miss\nFrench--who knew only that something tragic had happened in which Kitty\nwas concerned--kept up a fragmentary conversation till dinner was\nannounced and Kitty entered. She had evidently been weeping, but with\npowder and rouge she had tried to conceal the traces of her tears; and\nat dinner she sat silent, hardly answering when Margaret French spoke to\nher.\n\nAfter dinner Ashe went out with his cigar towards the Piazza. He was in\na smarting, dazed state, beginning, however, to realize the blow more\nthan he had done at first. He believed that Parham himself would not be\nat all sorry to be rid of him. He and his friends formed a powerful\ngroup both in the cabinet and out of it. But they were forcing the pace,\nand the elements of resistance and reaction were strong. He pictured the\ndismay of his friends, the possible breakdown of the reforming party. Of\ncourse they might so stand by him--and the suppression of the book might\nbe so complete--\n\nAt this moment he caught sight of a newspaper contents bill displayed at\nthe door of the only shop in the Piazza which sold English newspapers.\nOne of the lines ran, \"Anonymous attack on the Premier.\" He started,\nwent in and bought the paper. There, in the \"London Topics\" column, was\nthe following paragraph:\n\n\"A string of extracts from a forthcoming book, accompanied by a somewhat\nstartling publisher's statement, has lately been sent round to the\npress. We are asked not to print them before the day of publication, but\nthey have already roused much attention, if not excitement. They\ncertainly contain a very gross attack on the Prime Minister, based\napparently on first-hand information, and involving indiscretions\npersonal and political of an unusually serious character. The wife of a\ncabinet minister is freely named as the writer, and even if no violation\nof cabinet secrecy is concerned, it is clear that the book outrages the\nconfidential relations which ought to subsist between a Premier and his\ncolleagues, if government on our English system is to be satisfactorily\ncarried on. The statements it makes with every appearance of authority\nboth as to the relations between Lord Parham and some of the most\nimportant members of his cabinet, and as to the Premier's intentions\nwith regard to one or two of the most vital questions now before the\ncountry, are calculated seriously to embarrass the government. We fear\nthe book will have a veritable _succ\u00c3\u00a8s de scandale_.\"\n\n\"That fellow at least has done his best to kick the ball, damn him!\"\nthought Ashe, with contempt, as he thrust the paper into his pocket.\n\nIt was no more than he expected; but it put an end to all thoughts of a\nmore hopeful kind. He walked up and down the _Piazza_ smoking, till\nmidnight, counting the hours till he could reach London, and revolving\nthe phrases of a telegram to be sent to his solicitor before starting.\n\nKitty made no sign or sound when he entered her room. Her fair head was\nturned away from him, and all was dark. He could hardly believe that she\nwas asleep; but it was a relief to him to accept her pretence of it, and\nto escape all further conversation. He himself slept but little. The\nmere profundity of the Venetian silence teased him; it reminded him how\nfar he was from home.\n\nTwo images pursued him--of Kitty writing the book, while he was away\nelectioneering or toiling at his new office--and then, of his returns to\nHaggart--tired or triumphant--on many a winter evening, of her glad rush\ninto his arms, her sparkling face on his breast.\n\nOr again, he conjured up the scene when the MS. had been shown to\nDarrell--his pretence of disapproval, his sham warnings, and the smile\non his sallow face as he walked off with it. Ashe looked back to the\nearly days of his friendship with Darrell, when he, Ashe, was one of the\nleaders at Eton, popular with the masters in spite of his incorrigible\nidleness, and popular with the boys because of his bodily prowess, and\nDarrell had been a small, sickly, bullied colleger. Scene after scene\nrecurred to him, from their later relations at Oxford also. There was a\nkind of deliberation in the way in which he forced his thoughts into\nthis channel; it made an outlet for a fierce bitterness of spirit, which\nsome imperious instinct forbade him to spend on Kitty.\n\nHe dozed in the later hours of the night, and was roused by something\ntouching his hand, which lay outside the bedclothes. Again the little\nhead!--and the soft curls. Kitty was there--crouched beside\nhim--weeping. There flashed into his mind an image of the night in\nLondon when she had come to him thus; and unwelcome as the whole\nremembrance was, he was conscious of a sudden swelling wave of pity and\npassion. What if he sprang up, caught her in his arms, forgave her, and\nbade the world go hang!\n\nNo! The impulse passed, and in his turn he feigned sleep. The thought of\nher long deceit, of the selfish wilfulness wherewith she had requited\ndeep love and easy trust, was too much; it seared his heart. And there\nwas another and a subtler influence. To have forgiven so easily would\nhave seemed treachery to those high ambitions and ideals from which--as\nhe thought, only too certainly--she had now cut him off. It was part of\nhis surviving youth that the catastrophe seemed to him so absolute. Any\nthought of the fresh efforts which would be necessary for the\nreconquering of his position was no less sickening to him than that of\nthe immediate discomforts and humiliations to be undergone. He would go\nback to books and amusement; and in the idling of the future there would\nbe plenty of time for love-making.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, when all preparations were made, the gondoliers waiting\nbelow, Ashe's telegram sent, and the circular notes handed over to\nMargaret French, who had discreetly left the room, William approached\nhis wife.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" said Kitty, and gave him her hand, with a strange look and\nsmile.\n\nAshe, however, drew her to him and kissed her--against her will. \"I'll\ndo my best, Kitty,\" he said, in a would-be cheery voice--\"to pull us\nthrough. Perhaps--I don't know!--things may turn out better than I\nthink. Good-bye. Take care of yourself. I'll write, of course. Don't\nhurry home. You'll want a fortnight or three weeks yet.\"\n\nKitty said not a word, and in another minute he was gone. The Italian\nservants congregated below at the water-gate sent laughing \"A\nrivederlas\" after the handsome, good-tempered Englishman, whom they\nliked and regretted; the gondola moved off; Kitty heard the plash of the\nwater. But she held back from the window.\n\nHalf-way to the bend of the canal beyond the Accademia, Ashe turned and\ngave a long look at the balcony. No one was there. But just as the\ngondola was passing out of sight, Kitty slipped onto the balcony. She\ncould see only the figure of Piero, the gondolier, and in another second\nthe boat was gone. She stayed there for many minutes, clinging to the\nbalustrade and staring, as it seemed, at the sparkle of autumnal sun\nwhich danced on the green water and on the red palace to her right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the morning Kitty on her sofa pretended to write letters. Margaret\nFrench, working or reading behind her, knew that she scarcely got\nthrough a single note, that her pen lay idle on the paper, while her\neyes absently watched the palace windows on the other side of the canal.\nMiss French was quite certain that some tragic cause of difference\nbetween the husband and wife had arisen. Kitty, the indiscreet, had for\nonce kept her own counsel about the book, and Ashe had with his own\nhands packed away the volumes which had arrived the night before; so\nthat she could only guess, and from that delicacy of feeling restrained\nher as much as possible.\n\nOnce or twice Kitty seemed on the point of unburdening herself. Then\novermastering tears would threaten; she would break off and begin to\nwrite. At luncheon her look alarmed Miss French, so white was the little\nface, so large and restless the eyes. Ought Mr. Ashe to have left her,\nand left her apparently in anger? No doubt he thought her much better.\nBut Margaret remembered the worst days of her illness, the anxious looks\nof the doctors, and the anguish that Kitty had suffered in the first\nweeks after her child's death. She seemed now, indeed, to have forgotten\nlittle Harry, so far as outward expression went; but who could tell what\nwas passing in her strange, unstable mind? And it often seemed to\nMargaret that the signs of the past summer were stamped on her\nindelibly, for those who had eyes to see.\n\nWas it the perception of this pity beside her that drove Kitty to\nsolitude and flight? At any rate, she said after luncheon that she would\ngo to Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es, and did not ask Miss French to accompany her.\n\nShe set out accordingly with the two gondoliers. But she had hardly\npassed the Accademia before she bid her men take a cross-cut to the\nGiudecca. On these wide waters, with their fresher air and fuller\nsunshine, a certain physical comfort seemed to breathe upon her.\n\n\"Piero, it is not rough! Can we go to the Lido?\" she asked the gondolier\nbehind her.\n\nPiero, who was all smiles and complaisance, as well he might be with a\nlady who scattered _lire_ as freely as Kitty did, turned the boat at\nonce for that channel \"Del Orfano\" where the bones of the vanquished\ndead lie deep amid the ooze.\n\nThey passed San Giorgio, and were soon among the piles and sand-banks of\nthe lagoon. Kitty sat in a dream which blotted the sunshine from the\nwater. It seemed to her that she was a dead creature, floating in a dead\nworld. William had ceased to love her. She had wrecked his career and\ndestroyed her own happiness. Her child had been taken from her. Lady\nTranmore's affection had been long since alienated. Her own mother was\nnothing to her; and her friends in society, like Madeleine Alcot, would\nonly laugh and gloat over the scandal of the book.\n\nNo--everything was finished! As her fingers hanging over the side of the\ngondola felt the touch of the water, her morbid fancy, incredibly quick\nand keen, fancied herself drowned, or poisoned--lying somehow white and\ncold on a bed where William might see and forgive her.\n\nThen with a start of memory which brought the blood rushing to her face,\nshe thought of Cliffe standing beside the door of the great hall in the\nVercelli palace--she seemed to be looking again into those deep,\nexpressive eyes, held by the irony and the passion with which they were\ninfused. Had the passion any reference to her?--or was it merely part of\nthe man's nature, as inseparable from it as flame from the volcano? If\nWilliam had cast her off, was there still one man--wild and bad, indeed,\nlike herself, but poet and hero nevertheless--who loved her?\n\nShe did not much believe it; but still the possibility of it lured her,\nlike some dark gulf that promised her oblivion from this pain--pain\nwhich tortured one so impatient of distress, so hungry for pleasure and\npraise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn those days the Lido was still a noble and solitary shore, without the\ndegradations of to-day.\n\nKitty walked fast and furiously across the sandy road, and over the\nshingles, turning, when she reached the firm sand, southward towards\nMalamocco. It was between four and five, and the autumn afternoon was\nfast declining. A fresh breeze was on the sea, and the short waves,\nintensely blue under a wide, clear heaven, broke in dazzling foam on the\nred-brown sand.\n\nShe seemed to be alone between sea and sky, save for two figures\napproaching from the south--a fisher-boy with a shrimping-net and a man\nwalking bareheaded. She noticed them idly. A mirage of sun was between\nher and them, and the agony of remorse and despair which held her\nblunted all perceptions.\n\nThus it was that not till she was close upon him did her dazzled sight\nrecognize Geoffrey Cliffe.\n\nHe saw her first, and stopped in motionless astonishment on the edge of\nthe sand. She almost ran against him, when his voice arrested her.\n\n\"Lady Kitty!\"\n\nShe put her hand to her breast, wavered, and came to a stand-still. He\nsaw a little figure in black between him and those \"gorgeous towers and\ncloud-capped palaces\" of Alpine snow, which dimly closed in the north;\nand beneath the drooping hat a face even more changed and tragic than\nthat which had haunted him since their meeting of the day before.\n\n[Illustration: \"SHE THOUGHT OF CLIFFE STANDING BESIDE THE DOOR OF THE\nGREAT HALL.\"]\n\n\"How do you do?\" she said, mechanically, and would have passed him.\nBut he stood in her path. As he stared at her an impulse of rage ran\nthrough him, resenting the wreck of anything so beautiful--rage against\nAshe, who must surely be somehow responsible.\n\n\"Aren't you wandering too far, Lady Kitty?\" His voice shook under the\nrestraint he put upon it. \"You seem tired--very tired--and you are\nperhaps farther from your gondola than you think.\"\n\n\"I am not tired.\"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Might I walk with you a little, or do you forbid me?\"\n\nShe said nothing, but walked on. He turned and accompanied her. One or\ntwo questions that he put to her--Had she companions?--Where had she\nleft her gondola?--remained unanswered. He studied her face, and at last\nhe laid a strong hand upon her arm.\n\n\"Sit down. You are not fit for any more walking.\"\n\nHe drew her towards some logs of driftwood on the upper sand, and she\nsank down upon them. He found a place beside her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" he said, abruptly, with a harsh\nauthority. \"You are in trouble.\"\n\nA tremor shook her--as of the prisoner who feels on his limbs the first\ntouch of the fetter.\n\n\"No, no!\" she said, trying to rise; \"it is nothing. I--I didn't know it\nwas so far. I must go home.\"\n\nHis hand held her.\n\n\"Kitty!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Her voice was scarcely audible.\n\n\"Tell me what hurts you! Tell me why you are here, alone, with a face\nlike that! Don't be afraid of me! Could I lift a finger to harm a\nmother that has lost her child? Give me your hands.\" He gathered both\nhers into the warm shelter of his own. \"Look at me--trust me! My heart\nhas grown, Kitty, since you knew me last. It has taken into itself so\nmany griefs--so many deaths. Tell me your griefs, poor child!--tell me!\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed her hands--most tenderly, most gravely.\n\nTears rushed into her eyes. The wild emotions that were her being were\nroused beyond control. Bending towards him she began to pour out, first\nbrokenly, then in a torrent, the wretched, incoherent story, of which\nthe mere telling, in such an ear, meant new treachery to William and new\nruin for herself.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nOn a certain cloudy afternoon, some ten days later, a fishing-boat, with\na patched orange sail, might have been seen scudding under a light\nnorthwesterly breeze through the channels which connect the island of\nSan Francesco with the more easterly stretches of the Venetian lagoon.\nThe boat presently neared the shore of one of the cultivated\n_lidi_--islands formed out of the silt of many rivers by the travail of\ncenturies, some of them still mere sand or mud banks, others covered by\nvineyards and fruit orchards--which, with the _murazzi_ or sea-walls of\nVenice, stand sentinel between the city and the sea. On the _lido_ along\nwhich the boat was coasting, the vintage was long since over and the\nfruit gathered; the last yellow and purple leaves in the orchards, \"a\npestilent-stricken multitude,\" were to-day falling fast to earth, under\nthe sighing, importunate wind. The air was warm; November was at its\nmildest. But all color and light were drowned in floating mists, and\ndarkness lay over the distant city. It was one of those drear and\nghostly days which may well have breathed into the soul of Shelley that\nsuperb vision of the dead generations of Venice, rising, a phantom host\nfrom the bosom of the sunset, and sweeping in \"a rapid mask of death\"\nover the shadowed waters that saw the birth and may yet furnish the tomb\nof so vast a fame.\n\nTwo persons were in the boat--Kitty, wrapped in sables, her straying\nhair held close by a cap of the same fur--and Geoffrey Cliffe. They had\nbeen wandering in the lagoons all day, in order to escape from Venice\nand observers--first at Torcello, then at San Francesco, and now they\nwere ostensibly coming home in a wide sweep along the northern _lidi_\nand _murazzi_, that Cliffe might show his companion, from near by, the\nPorto del Lido, that exit from the lagoons where the salt lakes grow\ninto the sea.\n\nA certain wildness and exaltation, drawn from the solitudes around them\nand from their _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, could be read in both the man and the\nwoman. Cliffe watched his companion incessantly. As he lay against the\nside of the boat at her feet, he saw her framed in the curving sides of\nthe stern, and could read her changing expressions. Not a happy\nface!--that he knew! A face haunted by shadows from an underworld of\nthought--pursuing furies of remorse and fear. Not the less did he\ntriumph that he had it _there_, in his power; nor had the flashes of\nterror and wavering will which he discerned in any way diminished its\nbeauty.\n\n\"How long have you known--that woman?\" Kitty asked him, suddenly, after\na pause broken only by the playing of the wind with the sail.\n\nCliffe laughed.\n\n\"The Ricci? Why do you want to know, madame?\"\n\nShe made a contemptuous lip.\n\n\"I knew her first,\" said Cliffe, \"some years ago in Milan. She was then\nat La Scala--walking on--paid for her good looks. Then somebody sent her\nto Paris to the Conservatoire, which she only left this spring. This is\nher first Italian engagement. Her people are shopkeepers here--in the\nMerceria--which helped her. She is as vain as a peacock and as dangerous\nas a pet panther.\"\n\n\"Dangerous!\" Kitty's scorn had passed into her voice.\n\n\"Well, Italy is still the country of the knife,\" said Cliffe,\nlightly--\"and I could still hire a bravo or two--in Venice--if I wanted\nthem.\"\n\n\"Does the Ricci hire them?\"\n\nCliffe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"She'd do it without winking, if it suited her.\" Then, after a\npause--\"Do you still wonder why I should have chosen her society?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Kitty, hastily. \"You told me.\"\n\n\"As much as a _friend_ cares to know?\"\n\nShe nodded, flushing, and dropped the subject.\n\nCliffe's mouth still smiled, but his eyes studied her with a veiled and\nsinister intensity.\n\n\"I have not seen the lady for a week,\" he resumed. \"She pesters me with\nnotes. I promised to go and see her in a new play to-morrow night,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Oh, go!\" said Kitty--\"by all means go!\"\n\n\"'Ruy Blas' in Italian? I think not. Ah! did you see that gleam on the\nCampanile?--marvellous!... Miladi, I have a question to ask you.\"\n\n\"_Dites!_\" said Kitty.\n\n\"Did you put me into your book?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What kind of things did you say?\"\n\n\"The worst I could!\"\n\n\"Ah! How shall I get a copy?\" said Cliffe, musing.\n\nShe made no answer, but she was conscious of a sudden movement--was it\nof terror? At the bottom of her soul was she, indeed, afraid of the man\nbeside her?\n\n\"By-the-way,\" he resumed, \"you promised to tell me your news of this\nmorning. But you haven't told me a word!\"\n\nShe turned away. She had gathered her furs around her, and her face was\nalmost hidden by them.\n\n\"Nothing is settled,\" she said, in a cold, reluctant voice.\n\n\"Which means that you won't tell me anything more?\"\n\nShe was silent. Her lip had a proud line which piqued him.\n\n\"You think I am not worthy to know?\"\n\nHer eye gleamed.\n\n\"What does it matter to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing! I should have been glad to hear that all was well, and\nAshe's mind at rest about his prospects.\"\n\n\"His prospects!\" she repeated, with a scorn which stung. \"How _dare_ we\nmention his name here at all?\"\n\nCliffe reddened.\n\n\"I dare,\" he said, calmly.\n\nKitty looked at him--a quivering defiance in face and frame; then bent\nforward.\n\n\"Would you like to know--who is the best--the noblest--the\nhandsomest--the most generous--the most delightful man I have ever met?\"\n\nEach word came out winged and charged with a strange intensity of\npassion.\n\n\"Do I?\" said Cliffe, raising his eyebrows--\"do I want to know?\"\n\nHer look held him.\n\n\"My husband, William Ashe!\"\n\nAnd she fell back, flushed and breathless, like one who throws out a\nrebel and challenging flag.\n\nCliffe was silent a moment, observing her.\n\n\"Strange!\" he said, at last. \"It is only when you are miserable you are\nkind. I could wish you miserable again, _ch\u00c3\u00a9rie_.\"\n\nTone and look broke into a sombre wildness before which she shrank. Her\nown violence passed away. She leaned over the side of the boat,\nstruggling with tears.\n\n\"Then you have your wish,\" was her muffled answer.\n\nThe three bronzed Venetians, a father and two sons, who were working the\n_bragozzo_ glanced curiously at the pair. They were persuaded that these\ncharterers of their boat were lovers flying from observation, and the\nunknown tongue did but stimulate guessing.\n\nCliffe raised himself impatiently.\n\nThey were nearing a point where the line of _murazzi_ they had been\nfollowing--low breakwaters of great strength--swept away from them\noutward and eastward towards a distant opening. On the other side of the\nchannel was a low line of shore, broadening into the Lido proper, with\nits scattered houses and churches, and soon lost in the mist as it\nstretched towards the south.\n\n\"Ecco!--il Porto del Lido!\" said the older boatman, pointing far away to\na line of deeper color beneath a dark and lowering sky.\n\nKitty bent over the side of the boat staring towards the dim spot he\nshowed her--where was the mouth of the sea.\n\n\"Kitty!\" said Cliffe's voice beside her, hoarse and hurried--\"one word,\nand I tell these fellows to set their helm for Trieste. This boat will\ncarry us well--and the wind is with us.\"\n\nShe turned and looked him in the face.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then? We'll think it out together, Kitty--together!\" He bent his lips\nto her hand, bending so as to conceal the action from the sailors. But\nshe drew her hand away.\n\n\"You and I,\" she said, fiercely--\"would tire of each other in a week!\"\n\n\"Have the courage to try! No!--you should not tire of me in a week! I\nwould find ways to keep you mine, Kitty--cradled, and comforted, and\nhappy.\"\n\n\"Happy!\" Her slight laugh was the forlornest thing. \"Take me out to\nsea--and drop me there--with a stone round my neck. That might be worth\ndoing--perhaps.\"\n\nHe surveyed her unmoved.\n\n\"Listen, Kitty! This kind of thing can't go on forever.\"\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" she said, tauntingly. \"You ought to have\ngone last week.\"\n\n\"I am not going,\" he said, raising himself by a sudden movement--\"till\nyou come with me!\"\n\nKitty started, her eyes riveted to his.\n\n\"And yet go I will! Not even you shall stop me, Kitty. I'll take the\nhelp I've gathered back to those poor devils--if I die for it. But\nyou'll come with me--you'll come!\"\n\nShe drew back--trembling under an impression she strove to conceal.\n\n\"If you will talk such madness, I can't help it,\" she said, with\nshortened breath.\n\n\"Yes--you'll come!\" he said, nodding. \"What have you to do with Ashe,\nKitty, any longer? You and he are already divided. You have tried life\ntogether and what have you made of it? You're not fit for this mincing,\ntripping London life--nor am I? And as for morals--- I'll tell you a\nstrange thing, Kitty.\" He bent forward and grasped her hands with a\nforce which hurt--from which she could not release herself. \"I\nbelieve--yes, by God, I believe!--that I am a better man than I was\nbefore I started on this adventure. It's been like drinking at last at\nthe very source of life--living, not talking about it. One bitter night\nlast February, for instance, I helped a man--one of the insurgents--who\nhad taken to the mountains with his wife and children--to carry his\nwife, a dying woman, over a mountain-pass to the only place where she\ncould possibly get help and shelter. We carried her on a litter, six men\ntaking turns. The cold and the fatigue were such that I shudder now when\nI think of it. Yet at the end I seemed to myself a man reborn. I was\nhappier than I had ever been in my life. Some mystic virtue had flowed\ninto me. Among those men and women, instead of being the selfish beast\nI've been all these years, I can forget myself. Death seems\nnothing--brotherhood--liberty!--everything! And yet--\"\n\nHis face relaxed, became ironical, reflective. But he held the hands\nclose, his grasp of them hidden by the folds of fur which hung about\nher.\n\n\"And _yet_--I can say to you without a qualm--put this marriage which\nhas already come to naught behind you--and come with me! Ashe cramps\nyou. He blames you--you blame yourself. What _reality_ has all that? It\nmakes you miserable--it wastes life. _I_ accept your nature--I don't ask\nyou to be anything else than yourself--your wild, vain, adorable self!\nAshe asks you to put restraint on yourself--to make painful efforts--to\nbe good for his sake--the sake of something outside. _I_ say--come and\nlook at the elemental things--death and battle--hatred, solitude, love.\n_They'll_ sweep us out of ourselves!--no need to strive and cry for\nit--into the great current of the world's being--bring us close to the\nforces at the root of things--the forces which create--and destroy. Dip\nyour heart in that stream, Kitty, and feel it grow in your breast. Take\na nurse's dress--put your hand in mine--and come! I can't promise you\nluxuries or ease. You've had enough of those. Come and open another door\nin the House of Life! Take starving women and hunted children into your\narms--- feel with them--weep with them--look with them into the face of\ndeath! Make friends with nature--with rocks, forests, torrents--with\nnight and dawn, which you've never seen, Kitty! They'll love\nyou--they'll support you--the rough people--and the dark forests.\nThey'll draw nature's glamour round you--they'll pour her balm into your\nsoul. And I shall be with you--beside you!--your guardian--your\nlover--your _lover_, Kitty--till death do us part.\"\n\nHe looked at her with the smile which was his only but sufficient\nbeauty; the violent, exciting words flowed in her ear, amid the sound of\nrising waves and the distant talk of the fishermen. His hand crushed\nhers; his mad, imploring eyes repelled and constrained her. The wild\nhungers and curiosities of her being rushed to meet him; she heard the\necho of her own words to Ashe: \"More life--more _life_!--even though it\nlead to pain--and agony--and tears!\"\n\nThen she wrenched herself away--suddenly, contemptuously.\n\n\"Of course, that's all nonsense--romantic nonsense. You've perhaps\nforgotten that I am one of the women who don't stir without their maid.\"\n\nCliffe's expression changed. He thrust his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"Oh, well, if you must have a maid,\" he said, dryly, \"that settles it. A\nmaid would be the deuce. And yet--I think I could find you a Bosnian\ngirl--strong and faithful--\"\n\nTheir eyes met--his already full of a kind of ownership, tender,\nconfident, humorous even--hers alive with passionate anger and\nresistance.\n\n\"_Without a qualm_!\" she repeated, in a low voice--\"without a qualm! Mon\nDieu!\"\n\nShe turned and looked towards the Adriatic.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she said, imperiously.\n\nFor a gesture of command on Cliffe's part, unseen by her, had sent the\nboat eastward, spinning before the wind. The lagoon was no longer\ntranquil. It was covered with small waves; and the roar of the outer\nsea, though still far off, was already in their ears. The mist lifting\nshowed white, distant crests of foam on a tumbling field of water, and\nto the north, clothed in tempestuous purple, the dim shapes of\nmountains.\n\nKitty raised herself, and beckoned towards the captain of the\n_bragozzo_.\n\n\"Giuseppe!\"\n\n\"Commanda, Eccellenza!\"\n\nThe man came forward.\n\nWith a voice sharp and clear, she gave the order to return at once to\nVenice. Cliffe watched her, the veins on his forehead swelling. She knew\nthat he debated with himself whether he should give a counter-order or\nno.\n\n\"A Venezia!\" said Kitty, waving her hand towards the sailors, her eyes\nshining under the tangle of her hair.\n\nThe helm was put round, and beneath a tacking sail the boat swept\nsouthward.\n\nWith an awkward laugh Cliffe fell back into his seat, stretching his\nlong limbs across the boat. He had spoken under a strong and genuine\nimpulse. His passion for her had made enormous strides in these few wild\ndays beside her. And yet the fantastic poet's sense responded at a touch\nto the new impression. He shook off the heroic mood as he had doffed his\nBosnian cloak. In a few minutes, though the heightened color remained,\nhe was chatting and laughing as though nothing had happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe, exhausted physically and morally by her conflict with him, hardly\nspoke on the way home. He entertained her, watching her all the time--a\nhundred speculations about her passing through his brain. He understood\nperfectly how the insight which she had allowed him into her grief and\nher remorse had broken down the barriers between them. Her incapacity\nfor silence, and reticence, had undone her. Was he a villain to have\ntaken advantage of it?\n\nWhy? With a strange, half-cynical clearness he saw her, as the obstacle\nthat she was, in Ashe's life and career. For Ashe--supposing he, Cliffe,\npersuaded her--there would be no doubt a first shock of wrath and\npain--then a sense of deliverance. For her, too, deliverance! It excited\nhis artist's sense to think of all the further developments through\nwhich he might carry that eager, plastic nature. There would be a new\nKitty, with new capacities and powers. Wasn't that justification enough?\nHe felt himself a sculptor in the very substance of life, moulding a\nliving creature afresh, disengaging it from harsh and hindering\nconditions. What was there vile in that?\n\nThe argument pursued itself.\n\n\"The modern judges for himself--makes his own laws, as a god, knowing\ngood and evil. No doubt in time a new social law will emerge--with new\nsanctions. Meanwhile, here we are, in a moment of transition,\nmanufacturing new types, exploring new combinations--by which let those\nwho come after profit!\"\n\nLittle delicate, distinguished thing!--every aspect of her, angry or\nsweet, sad or wilful, delighted his taste and sense. Moreover, she was\n_his_ deliverance, too--from an ugly and vulgar entanglement of which he\nwas ashamed. He shrank impatiently from memories which every now and\nthen pursued him of the Ricci's coarse beauty and exacting ways. Kitty\nhad just appeared in time! He felt himself rehabilitated in his own\neyes. Love may trifle as it pleases with what people call \"law\"; but\nthere are certain \u00c3\u00a6sthetic limits not to be transgressed.\n\nThe Ricci, of course, was wild and thirsting for revenge. Let her!\nAnxieties far more pressing disturbed him. What if he tempted Kitty to\nthis escapade--and the rough life killed her? He saw clearly how frail\nshe was.\n\nBut it was the artificiality of her life, the innumerable burdens of\ncivilization, which had brought her to this! Women were not the\nweaklings they seemed, or believed themselves to be. For many of them,\nprobably for Kitty, a rude and simple life would mean not only fresh\nmental but fresh physical strength. He had seen what women could endure,\nfor love's or patriotism's sake! Make but appeal to the spirit--the\nproud and tameless spirit--and how the flesh answered! He knew that his\npower with Kitty came largely from a certain stoicism, a certain\nhardness, mingled, as he would prove to her, with a boundless devotion.\nLet him carry it through--without fears--and so enlarge her being and\nhis own! And as to responsibilities beyond, as to their later lives--let\ntime take care of its own births. For the modern determinist of Cliffe's\ntype there _is_ no responsibility. He waits on life, following where it\nleads, rejoicing in each new feeling, each fresh reaction of\nconsciousness on experience, and so links his fatalist belief to that\nNietzsche doctrine of self-development at all costs, and the coming man,\nin which Cliffe's thought anticipated the years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKitty meanwhile listened to his intermittent talk of Venice, or Bosnia,\nwith all its suggestions of new worlds and far horizons, and scarcely\nsaid a word.\n\nBut through the background of the brain there floated with her, as with\nhim, a procession of unspoken thoughts. She had received three letters\nfrom William. Immediately on his arrival he had tendered his\nresignation. Lord Parham had asked him to suspend the matter for ten\ndays. Only the pressure of his friends, it seemed, and the consternation\nof his party had wrung from Ashe a reluctant consent. Meanwhile, all\ncopies of the book had been bought up; the important newspapers had\nreadily lent themselves to the suppression of the affair; private wraths\nhad been dealt with by conciliatory lawyers; and in general a far more\ncomplete hushing-up had been attained than Ashe had ever imagined\npossible. There was no doubt infinite gossip in the country-houses. But\nsympathy for Kitty in her grief, for Ashe himself, and Lady Tranmore,\nhad done much to keep it within bounds. The little Dean especially,\nbeloved of all the world, had been incessantly active on behalf of peace\nand oblivion.\n\nAll this Kitty read or guessed from William's letters. After all, then,\nthe harm had not been so great! Why such a panic!--such a hurry to leave\nher!--when she was ill--and sorry? And now how curtly, how measuredly he\nwrote! Behind the hopefulness of his tone she read the humiliation and\nsoreness of his mind--and said to herself, with a more headlong\nconviction than ever, that he would never forgive her.\n\nNo, _never!_--and especially now that she had added a thousandfold to\nthe original offence. She had never written to him since his departure.\nMargaret French, too, was angry with her--had almost broken with her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey left their boat on the Riva, and walked to the _Piazza_, through\nthe now starry dusk. As they passed the great door of St. Mark's, two\npersons came out of the church. Kitty recognized Mary Lyster and Sir\nRichard. She bowed slightly; Sir Richard put his hand to his hat in a\nflurried way; but Mary, looking them both in the face, passed without\nthe smallest sign, unless the scorn in face and bearing might pass for\nrecognition.\n\nKitty gasped.\n\n\"She cut me!\" she said, in a shaking voice.\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Cliffe. \"She didn't see you in the dark.\"\n\nKitty made no reply. She hurried along the northern side of the Piazza,\navoiding the groups which were gathered in the sunset light round the\nflocks of feeding pigeons, brushing past the tables in front of the\ncafe's, still well filled on this mild evening.\n\n\"Take care!\" said Cliffe, suddenly, in a low, imperative voice.\n\nKitty looked up. In her abstraction she saw that she had nearly come\ninto collision with a woman sitting at a caf\u00c3\u00a9 table and surrounded by a\nnoisy group of men.\n\nWith a painful start Kitty perceived the mocking eyes of Mademoiselle\nRicci. The Ricci said something in Italian, staring the while at the\nEnglish lady; and the men near her laughed, some furtively, some loudly.\n\nCliffe's face set. \"Walk quickly!\" he said in her ear, hurrying her\npast.\n\nWhen they had reached one of the narrow streets behind the Piazza, Kitty\nlooked at him--white and haughtily tremulous. \"What did that mean?\"\n\n\"Why should you deign to ask?\" was Cliffe's impatient reply. \"I have\nceased to go and see her. I suppose she guesses why.\"\n\n\"I will have no rivalry with Mademoiselle Ricci!\" cried Kitty.\n\n\"You can't help it,\" said Cliffe, calmly. \"The powers of light are\nalways in rivalry with the powers of darkness.\"\n\nAnd without further pleading or excuse he stalked on, his gaunt form and\nstriking head towering above the crowded pavement. Kitty followed him\nwith difficulty, conscious of a magnetism and a force against which she\nstruggled in vain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout a week afterwards Kitty shut herself up one evening in her room to\nwrite to Ashe. She had just passed through an agitating conversation\nwith Margaret French, who had announced her intention of returning to\nEngland at once, alone, if Kitty would not accompany her. Kitty's hands\nwere trembling as she began to write.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am glad--oh! so glad, William--that you _have_ withdrawn your\nresignation--that people have come forward so splendidly, and _made_ you\nwithdraw it--that Lord Parham is behaving decently--and that you have\nbeen able to get hold of all those copies of the book. I always hoped it\nwould not be quite so bad as you thought. But I know you must have gone\nthrough an awful time--and I'm _sorry_.\n\n\"William, I want to tell you something--for I can't go on lying to\nyou--or even just hiding the truth. I met Geoffrey Cliffe here--before\nyou left--and I never told you. I saw him first in a gondola the night\nof the serenata--and then at the Armenian convent. Do you remember my\nhurrying you and Margaret into the garden? That was to escape meeting\nhim. And that same afternoon when I was in the unused rooms of the\nPalazzo Vercelli--the rooms they show to tourists--he suddenly\nappeared--and somehow I spoke to him, though I had never meant to do so\nagain.\n\n\"Then when you left me I met him again--that afternoon--and he found out\nI was very miserable and made me tell him everything. I know I had no\nright to do so--they were your secrets as well as mine. But you know how\nlittle I can control myself--it's wretched, but it's true.\n\n\"William, I don't know what will happen. I can't make out from Margaret\nwhether she has written to you or not--she won't tell me. If she has,\nthis letter will not be much news to you. But, mind, I write it of my\nown free will, and not because Margaret may have forced my hand. I\nshould have written it anyway. Poor old darling!--she thinks me mad and\nbad, and to-night she tells me she can't take the responsibility of\nlooking after me any longer. Women like her can never understand\ncreatures like me--and I don't want her to. She's a dear saint, and as\ntrue as steel--not like your Mary Lysters! I could go on my knees to\nher. But she can't control or save me. Not even you could, William.\nYou've tried your best, and in spite of you I'm going to perdition, and\nI can't stop myself.\n\n\"For, William, there's something broken forever between you and me. I\nknow it was I who did the wrong, and that you had no choice but to leave\nme when you did. But yet you _did_ leave me, though I implored you not.\nAnd I know very well that you don't love me as you used to--why should\nyou?--and that you never can love me in the same way again. Every letter\nyou write tells me that. And though I have deserved it all, I can't\nbear it. When I think of coming home to England, and how you would try\nto be nice to me--how good and dear and magnanimous you would be, and\nwhat a beast I should feel--I want to drown myself and have done.\n\n\"It all seems to me so hopeless. It is my own nature--- the stuff out of\nwhich I am cut--that's all wrong. I may promise my breath away that I\nwill be discreet and gentle and well behaved, that I'll behave properly\nto people like Lady Parham, that I'll keep secrets, and not make absurd\nfriendships with absurd people, that I'll try and keep out of debt, and\nso on. But what's the use? It's the _will_ in me--the something that\ndrives, or ought to drive--that won't work. And nobody ever taught me or\nshowed me, that I can remember, till I met you. In Paris at the Place\nVend\u00c3\u00b4me, half the time I used to live with maman and papa, be hideously\nspoiled, dressed absurdly, eat off silver plate, and make myself sick\nwith rich things--and then for days together maman would go out or away,\nforget all about me, and I used to storm the kitchen for food. She\neither neglected me or made a show of me; she was my worst enemy, and I\nhated and fought her--till I went to the convent at ten. When I was\nfourteen maman asked a doctor about me. He said I should probably go\nmad--and at the convent they thought the same. Maman used to throw this\nat me when she was cross with me.\n\n\"Well, I don't repeat this to make you excuse me and think better of\nme--- it's all too late for that--but because I am such a puzzle to\nmyself, and I try to explain things. I _did_ love you, William--I\nbelieve I do still--but when I think of our living together again, my\narms drop by my side and I feel like a dead creature. Your life is too\ngreat a thing for me. Why should I spoil or hamper it? If you loved me,\nas you did once--if you still thought _everything_ worth while, then, if\nI had a spark of decency left, I might kill myself to free you, but I\nshould never do--what I may do now. But, William, you'll forget me soon.\nYou'll pass great laws, and make great speeches, and the years when I\ntormented you--and all my wretched ways--will seem such a small, small\nthing.\n\n\"Geoffrey says he loves me. And I think he does, though how long it will\nlast, or may be worth, no one can tell. As for me, I don't know whether\nI love him. I have no illusion about him. But there are moments when he\nabsolutely holds me--when my will is like wax in his hands. It is\nbecause, I think, of a certain grandness--_grandeur_ seems too\nstrong--in his character. It was always there; because no one could\nwrite such poems as his without it. But now it's more marked, though I\ndon't know that it makes him a better man. He thinks it does; but we all\ndeceive ourselves. At any rate, he is often superb, and I feel that I\ncould die, if not for him, at least with him. And he is not unlikely to\ndie in some heroic way. He went out as you know simply as correspondent\nand to distribute relief, but lately he has been fighting for these\npeople--of course he has!--and when he goes back he is to be one of\ntheir regular leaders. When he talks of it he is noble, transformed. It\nreminds me of Byron--his wicked life here--and then his death at\nMissolonghi. Geoffrey can do such base, cruel things--and yet--\n\n\"But I haven't yet told you. He asks me to go with him, back to the\nfighting-lines in upper Bosnia. There seems to be a great deal that\nwomen can do. I shall wear a nurse's uniform, and probably nurse at a\nlittle hospital he founded--high up in one of the mountain valleys. I\nknow this will almost make you laugh. You will think of me, not knowing\nhow to put on a button without Blanche--and wanting to be waited on\nevery moment. But you'll see; there'll be nothing of that sort. I wonder\nwhether it's hardship I've been thirsting for all my life--even when I\nseemed such a selfish, luxurious little ape?\n\n\"At the same time, I think it will kill me--and that would be the best\nend of all. To have some great, heroic experience, and then--'cease upon\nthe midnight with no pain!...'\n\n\"Oh, if I thought you'd care very, _very_ much, I should have\npain--horrible pain. But I know you won't. Politics have taken my place.\nThink of me sometimes, as I was when we were first married--and of\nHarry--my little, little fellow!\n\n\"--Maman and I have had a ghastly scene. She came to scold me for my\nbehavior--to say I was the talk of Venice. _She!_ Of course I know what\nshe means. She thinks if I am divorced she will lose her allowance--and\nshe can't bear the thought of that, though Markham Warington is quite\nrich. My heart just _boiled_ within me. I told her it is the poison of\nher life that works in me, and that whatever I do, _she_ has no right to\nreproach me. Then she cried--and I was like ice--and at last she went.\nWarington, good fellow, has written to me, and asked to see me. But what\nis the use?\n\n\"I know you'll leave me the \u00c2\u00a3500 a year that was settled on me. It'll be\nso good for me to be poor--and dressed in serge--and trying to do\nsomething else with these useless hands than writing books that break\nyour heart. I am giving away all my smart clothes. Blanche is going\nhome. Oh, William, William! I'm going to shut this, and it's like the\ngood-bye of death--a mean and ugly--_death_.\n\n\"... Later. They have just brought me a note from Danieli's. So Margaret\ndid write to you, and your mother has come. Why did you send her,\nWilliam? She doesn't love me--and I shall only stab and hurt her. Though\nI'll try not--for your sake.\"\n\nTwo days later Ashe received almost by the same post which brought him\nthe letter from Kitty, just quoted, the following letter from his\nmother:\n\n     \"My DEAREST WILLIAM,--I have seen Kitty. With some difficulty she\n     consented to let me go and see her yesterday evening about nine\n     o'clock.\n\n     \"I arrived between six and seven, having travelled straight through\n     without a break, except for an hour or two at Milan, and\n     immediately on arriving I sent a note to Margaret French. She came\n     in great distress, having just had a fresh scene with Kitty. Oh, my\n     dear William, her report could not well be worse. Since she wrote\n     to us Kitty seems to have thrown over all precautions. They used to\n     meet in churches or galleries, and go out for long days in the\n     gondola or a fishing-boat together, and Kitty would come home alone\n     and lie on the sofa through the evening, almost without speaking\n     or moving. But lately he comes in with her, and stays hours,\n     reading to her, or holding her hand, or talking to her in a low\n     voice, and Margaret cannot stop it.\n\n     \"Yet she has done her best, poor girl! Knowing what we all knew\n     last year, it filled her with terror when she first discovered that\n     he was in Venice and that they had met. But it was not till it had\n     gone on about a week, with the strangest results on Kitty's spirits\n     and nerves, that she felt she must interfere. She not only spoke to\n     Kitty, but she spoke and wrote to him in a very firm, dignified\n     way. Kitty took no notice--only became very silent and secretive.\n     And he treated poor Margaret with a kind of courteous irony which\n     made her blood boil, and against which she could do nothing. She\n     says that Kitty seems to her sometimes like a person moving in\n     sleep--only half conscious of what she is doing; and at others she\n     is wildly excitable, irritable with everybody, and only calming\n     down and becoming reasonable when this man appears.\n\n     \"There is much talk in Venice. They seem to have been seen together\n     by various London friends who knew--about the difficulties last\n     year. And then, of course, everybody is aware that you are not\n     here--and the whole story of the book goes from mouth to mouth--and\n     people say that a separation has been arranged--and so on. These\n     are the kind of rumors that Margaret hears, especially from Mary\n     Lyster, who is staying in this hotel with her father, and seems to\n     have a good many friends here.\n\n     \"Dearest William--I have been lingering on these things because it\n     is so hard to have to tell you what passed between me and Kitty.\n     Oh! my dear, dear son, take courage. Even now everything is not\n     lost. Her conscience may awaken at the last moment; this bad man\n     may abandon his pursuit of her; I may still succeed in bringing her\n     back to you. But I am in terrible fear--and I must tell you the\n     whole truth.\n\n     \"Kitty received me alone. The room was very dark--only one lamp\n     that gave a bad light--so that I saw her very indistinctly. She was\n     in black, and, as far as I could see, extremely pale and weary. And\n     what struck me painfully was her haggard, careless look. All the\n     little details of her dress and hair seemed so neglected. Blanche\n     says she is far too irritable and impatient in the mornings to let\n     her hair be done as usual. She just rolls it into one big knot\n     herself and puts a comb in it. She wears the simplest clothes, and\n     changes as little as possible. She says she is soon going to have\n     done with all that kind of thing, and she must get used to it. My\n     own impression is that she is going through great agony of\n     mind--above all, that she is ill--ill in body and soul.\n\n     \"She told me quite calmly, however, that she had made up her mind\n     to leave you; she said that she had written to you to tell you so.\n     I asked her if it was because she had ceased to love you. After a\n     pause she said 'No.' Was it because some one else had come between\n     you? She threw up her head proudly, and said it was best to be\n     quite plain and frank. She had met Geoffrey Cliffe again, and she\n     meant henceforward to share his life. Then she went into the\n     wildest dreams about going back with him to the Balkans, and\n     nursing in a hospital, and dying--she hopes!--of hard work and\n     privations. And all this in a torrent of words--and her eyes\n     blazing, with that look in them as though she saw nothing but the\n     scenes of her own imagination. She talked of devotion--and of\n     forgetting herself in other people. I could only tell her, of\n     course, that all this sounded to me the most grotesque sophistry\n     and perversion. She was forgetting her first duty, breaking her\n     marriage vow, and tearing your life asunder. She shook her head,\n     and said you would soon forget her. 'If he had loved me he would\n     never have left me!' she said, again and again, with a passion I\n     shall never forget.\n\n     \"Of course that made me very angry, and I described what the\n     situation had been when you reached London--Lord Parham's state of\n     mind--and the consternation caused everywhere by the wretched book.\n     I tried to make her understand what there was at stake--the hopes\n     of all who follow you in the House and the country--the great\n     reforms of which you are the life and soul--your personal and\n     political honor. I impressed on her the endless trouble and\n     correspondence in which you had been involved--and how meanwhile\n     all your Home Office and cabinet work had to be carried on as\n     usual, till it was decided whether your resignation should be\n     withdrawn or no. She listened with her head on her hands. I think\n     with regard to the book she is most genuinely ashamed and\n     miserable. And yet all the time there is this unreasonable, this\n     monstrous feeling that you should not have left her!\n\n     \"As to the scandalous references to private persons, she said that\n     Madeleine Alcot had written to her about the country-house gossip.\n     That wretched being, Mr. Darrell, seems also to have written to\n     her, trying to save himself through her. And the only time I saw\n     her laugh was when she spoke of having had a furious letter from\n     Lady Grosville about the references to Grosville Park. It was like\n     the laugh of a mischievous, unhappy child.\n\n     \"Then we came back to the main matter, and I implored her to let me\n     take her home. First I gave her your letter. She read it, flushed\n     up, and threw it away from her. 'He commands me!' she said,\n     fiercely. 'But I am no one's chattel.' I replied that you had only\n     summoned her back to her duty and her home, and I asked her if she\n     could really mean to repay your unfailing love by bringing anguish\n     and dishonor upon you? She sat dumb, and her stubbornness moved me\n     so that I fear I lost my self-control and said more, much more--in\n     denunciation of her conduct--than I had meant to do. She heard me\n     out, and then she got up and looked at me very bitterly and\n     strangely. I had never loved her, she said, and so I could not\n     judge her. Always from the beginning I had thought her unfit to be\n     your wife, and she had known it, and my dislike of her, especially\n     during the past year, had made her hard and reckless. It had seemed\n     no use trying. I just wanted her dead, that you might marry a wife\n     who would be a help and not a stumbling-block. Well, I should have\n     my wish, for she would soon be as good as dead, both to you and to\n     me.\n\n     \"All this hurt me deeply, and I could not restrain myself from\n     crying. I felt so helpless, and so doubtful whether I had not done\n     more harm than good. Then she softened a little, and asked me to\n     let her go to bed--she would think it all over and write to me in\n     the morning....\n\n     \"So, my dear William, I can only pray and wait. I am afraid there\n     is but little hope, but God is merciful and strong. He may yet save\n     us all.\n\n     \"But whatever happens, remember that you have nothing to reproach\n     yourself with--that you have done all that man could do. I should\n     telegraph to you in the morning to say, 'Come, at all hazards,' but\n     that I feel sure all will be settled to-morrow one way or the\n     other. Either Kitty will start with me--or she will go with\n     Geoffrey Cliffe. You could do nothing--absolutely nothing. God help\n     us! She seems to have some money, and she told me that she counted\n     on retaining her jointure.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the night following her interview with Lady Tranmore, Kitty went from\none restless, tormented dream into another, but towards morning she fell\ninto one of a different kind. She dreamed she was in a country of great\nmountains. The peaks were snow-crowned, vast glaciers filled the chasms\non their flanks, forests of pines clothed the lower sides of the hills,\nand the fields below were full of spring flowers. She saw a little\nAlpine village, and a church with an old and slender campanile. A plain\nstone building stood by--it seemed to be an inn of the old-fashioned\nsort--and she entered it. The dinner-table was ready in the low-roofed\n_salle-\u00c3\u00a0-manger_, and as she sat down to eat she saw that two other\nguests were at the same table. She glanced at them, and perceived that\none was William and the other her child, Harry, grown older--and\ntransfigured. Instead of the dull and clouded look which had wrung her\nheart in the old days, against which she had striven, patiently and\nimpatiently, in vain, the blue eyes were alive with mind and affection.\nIt was as if the child beheld his mother for the first time and she him.\nAs he recognized her he gave a cry of joy, waving one hand towards her\nwhile with the other he touched his father on the arm. William raised\nhis head. But when he saw his wife his face changed. He rose from his\nseat, and drawing the little boy into his arms he walked away. Kitty saw\nthem disappear into a long passage, indeterminate and dark. The child's\nface over his father's shoulder was turned in longing towards his\nmother, and as he was carried away he stretched out his little hands to\nher in lamentation.\n\nKitty woke up bathed in tears. She sprang out of bed and threw the\nwindow nearest to her open to the night. The winter night was mild, and\na full moon sailed the southern sky. Not a sound on the water, not a\nlight in the palaces; a city of ebony and silver, Venice slept in the\nmoonlight. Kitty gathered a cloak and some shawls round her, and sank\ninto a low chair, still crying and half conscious. At his inn, some few\nhundred yards away, between her and the Piazzetta, was Geoffrey Cliffe\nwaking too?--making his last preparations? She knew that all his stores\nwere ready, and that he proposed to ship them and the twenty young\nfellows, Italians and Dalmatians, who were going with him to join the\ninsurgents, that morning, by a boat leaving for Cattaro. He himself was\nto follow twenty-four hours later, and it was his firm and confident\nexpectation that Kitty would go with him--passing as his wife. And,\nindeed, Kitty's own arrangements were almost complete, her money in her\npurse, the clothes she meant to take with her packed in one small trunk,\nsome of the Tranmore jewels which she had been recently wearing ready\nto be returned on the morrow to Lady Tranmore's keeping, other jewels,\nwhich she regarded as her own, together with the remainder of her\nclothes, put aside, in order to be left in the custody of the landlord\nof the apartment till Kitty should claim them again.\n\nOne more day--which would probably see the departure of Margaret\nFrench--one more wrestle with Lady Tranmore, and all the links with the\nold life would be torn away. A bare, stripped soul, dependent henceforth\non Geoffrey Cliffe for every crumb of happiness, treading in unknown\npaths, suffering unknown things, probing unknown passions and\nexcitements--it was so she saw herself; not without that corroding\ndouble consciousness of the modern, that it was all very interesting,\nand as such to be forgiven and admired.\n\nNotwithstanding what she had said to Ashe, she did believe--with a\nclinging and desperate faith--that Cliffe loved her. Had she really\ndoubted it, her conduct would have been inexplicable, even to herself,\nand he must have seemed a madman. What else could have induced him to\nburden himself with a woman on such an errand and at such a time? She\nhad promised, indeed, to be his lieutenant and comrade--and to return to\nVenice if her health should be unequal to the common task. But in spite\nof the sternness with which he put that task first--a sternness which\nwas one of his chief attractions for Kitty--she knew well that her\ncoming threw a glamour round it which it had never yet possessed, that\nthe passion she had aroused in him, and the triumph of binding her to\nhis fate, possessed him--for the moment at any rate--heart and soul. He\nhad the poet's resources, too, and a mind wherewith to organize and\ngovern. She shrank from him still, but she already envisaged the time\nwhen her being would sink into and fuse with his, and like two colliding\nstars they would flame together to one fiery death.\n\nThoughts like these ran in her mind. Yet all the time she saw the high\nmountains of her dream, the old inn, the receding face of her child on\nWilliam's shoulder; and the tears ran down her cheeks. The letter from\nWilliam that Lady Tranmore had given her lay on a table near. She took\nit up, and lit a candle to read it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Kitty--I bid you come home. I should have started for Venice an hour\nago, after reading Miss French's letter, but that honor and public duty\nkeep me here. But mother is going, and I implore and command you, as\nyour husband, to return with her. Oh, Kitty, have I ever failed\nyou?--have I ever been hard with you?--that you should betray our love\nlike this? Was I hard when we parted--a month ago? If I was, forgive me,\nI was sore pressed. Come home, you poor child, and you shall hear no\nreproaches from me. I think I have nearly succeeded in undoing your rash\nwork. But what good will that be to me if you are to use my absence for\nthat purpose to bring us both to ruin? Kitty, the grass is not yet green\non our child's grave. I was at Haggart last Sunday, and I went over in\nthe dusk to put some flowers upon it. I thought of you without a\nmoment's bitterness, and prayed for us both, if such as I may pray. Then\nnext morning came Miss French's letter. Kitty, have you no heart--and no\nconscience? Will you bring disgrace on that little grave? Will you dig\nbetween us the gulf which is irreparable, across which your hand and\nmine can never touch each other any more? I cannot and I will not\nbelieve it. Come back to me--come back!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe reread it with a melting heart--with deep, shaking sobs. When she\nfirst glanced through it the word \"command\" had burned into her proud\nsense; the rest passed almost unnoticed. Now the very strangeness in it\nas coming from William--the strangeness of its grave and deep\nemotion--held and grappled with her.\n\nSuddenly--some tension of the whole being seemed to give way. Her head\nsank back on the chair, she felt herself weak and trembling, yet happy\nas a soul new-born into a world of light. Waking dreams passed through\nher brain in a feverish succession, reversing the dream of the\nnight--images of peace and goodness and reunion.\n\nMinutes--hours--passed. With the first light she got up feebly, found\nink and paper, and began to write.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_From Lady Tranmore to William Ashe_:\n\n\n\"Oh! my dearest William--at last a gleam of hope.\n\n\"No letter this morning. I was in despair. Margaret reported that Kitty\nrefused to see any one--had locked her door, and was writing. Yet no\nletter came. I made an attempt to see Geoffrey Cliffe, who is staying at\nthe 'Germania,' but he refused. He wrote me the most audacious letter to\nsay that an interview could only be very painful, that he and Kitty must\ndecide for themselves, that he was waiting every hour for a final word\nfrom Kitty. It rested with her, and with her only. Coercion in these\nmatters was no longer possible, and he did not suppose that either you\nor I would attempt it.\n\n\"And now comes this blessed note--a respite at least! '_I am going to\nVerona to-night with Blanche. Please let no one attempt to follow me. I\nwish to have two days alone--absolutely alone. Wait here. I will write.\nK_.'\n\n\"... Margaret French, too, has just been here. She was almost hysterical\nwith relief and joy--and you know what a calm, self-controlled person\nshe is. But her dear, round face has grown white, and her eyes behind\nher spectacles look as though she had not slept for nights. She says\nthat Kitty will not see her. She sent her a note by Blanche to ask her\nto settle all the accounts, and told her that she should not say\ngood-bye--it would be too agitating for them both. In two days she\nshould hear. Meanwhile the maid Blanche is certainly going with Kitty;\nand the gondola is ordered for the Milan train this evening.\n\n\"Two P.M. There is one thing that troubles me, and I must confess it. I\ndid not see that across Kitty's letter in the corner was written 'Tell\n_nobody_ about this letter.' And Polly Lyster happened to be with me\nwhen it came. She has been _au courant_ of the whole affair for the last\nfortnight--that is, as an on-looker. She and Kitty have only met once or\ntwice since Mary reached Venice; but in one way or another she has been\nextraordinarily well informed. And, as I told you, she came to see me\ndirectly I arrived and told me all she knew. You know her old friendship\nfor us, William? She has many weaknesses, and of late I have thought her\nmuch changed, grown very hard and bitter. But she is always _very_\nloyal to you and me--and I could not help betraying my feeling when\nKitty's note reached me. Mary came and put her arms round me, and I said\nto her, 'Oh, Mary, thank God!--she's broken with him! She's going to\nVerona to-night on the way home!' And she kissed me and seemed so glad.\nAnd I was very grateful to her for her sympathy, for I am beginning to\nfeel my age, and this has been rather a strain. But I oughtn't to have\ntold her!--or anybody! I see, of course, what Kitty meant. It is\nincredible that Mary should breathe a word--or if she did that it should\nreach that man. But I have just sent her a note to Danieli's to warn her\nin the strongest way.\n\n\"Beloved son--if, indeed, we save her--we will be very good to her, you\nand I. We will remember her bringing up and her inheritance. I will be\nmore loving--more like Christ. I hope He will forgive me for my\nharshness in the past.... My William!--I love you so! God be merciful to\nyou and to your poor Kitty!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Will the signora have her dinner outside or in the _salle-\u00c3\u00a0-manger?\"_\n\nThe question was addressed to Kitty by a little Italian waiter belonging\nto the Albergo San Zeno at Verona, who stood bent before her, his white\nnapkin under his arm.\n\n\"Out here, please--and for my maid also.\"\n\nThe speaker moved wearily towards the low wall which bounded the foaming\nAdige, and looked across the river. Far away the Alps that look down on\nGarda glistened under the stars; the citadel on its hill, the houses\nacross the river were alive with lights; to the left the great medi\u00c3\u00a6val\nbridge rose, a dark, ponderous mass, above the torrents of the Adige.\nOverhead, the little outside restaurant was roofed with twining\nvine-stems from which the leaves had fallen; colored lights twinkled\namong them and on the white tables underneath. The night was mild and\nstill, and a veiled moon was just rising over the town of Juliet.\n\n\"Blanche!\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady?\"\n\n\"Bring a chair, Blanchie, and come and sit by me.\"\n\nThe little maid did as she was told, and Kitty slipped her hand into\nhers with a long sigh.\n\n\"Are you very tired, my lady?\"\n\n\"Yes--but don't talk!\"\n\nThe two sat silent, clinging to each other.\n\nA step on the cobble-stones disturbed them. Blanche looked up, and saw a\ngentleman issuing from a lane which connected the narrow quay whereon\nstood the old Albergo San Zeno with one of the main streets of Verona.\n\nThere was a cry from Kitty. The stranger paused--looked--advanced. The\nlittle maid rose, half fierce, half frightened.\n\n\"Go, Blanche, go!\" said Kitty, panting; \"go back into the hotel.\"\n\n\"Not unless your ladyship wishes me to leave you,\" said the girl,\nfirmly.\n\n\"Go at once!\" Kitty repeated, with a peremptory gesture. She herself\nrose from her seat, and with one hand resting on the table awaited the\nnew-comer. Blanche looked at her--hesitated--and went.\n\nGeoffrey Cliffe came to Kitty's side. As he approached her his eyes\nfastened on the loveliness of her attitude, her fair head. In his own\nexpression there was a visionary, fantastic joy; it was the look of the\ndreamer who, for once, finds in circumstance and the real, poetry\nadequate and overflowing.\n\n\"Kitty!--why did you do this?\" he said to her, passionately, as he\ncaught her hand.\n\nKitty snatched it away, trembling under his look. She began the answer\nshe had devised while he was crossing the flagged quay towards her. But\nCliffe paid no heed. He laid a hand on her shoulder, and she sank back\npowerless into her chair as he bent over her.\n\n\"Cruel--cruel child, to play with me so! Did you mean to put me to a\nlast test?--or did your hard little heart misgive you at the last\nmoment? I cross-examined your landlady--I bribed the servants--the\ngondoliers. Not a word! They were loyal--or you had paid them better. I\nwent back to my hotel in black despair. Oh, you artist!--you plotter!\nKitty--you shall pay me this some day! And there--there on my table--all\nthe time--lay your little crumpled note!\"\n\n\"What note?\" she gasped--\"what note?\"\n\n\"Actress!\" he said, with an amused laugh.\n\nAnd cautiously, playfully, lest she should snatch it from him, he\nunfolded it before her.\n\nWithout signature and without date, the soiled half-sheet contained this\nmessage, written in Italian and in a disguised handwriting:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Too many spectators. Come to Verona to-night.\n                                       \"K.\"\n\nKitty looked at it, and then at the face beside her--infused with a\ntriumphant power and passion. She seemed to shrink upon herself, and her\nhead fell back against one of the supports of the _pergola_. One of the\nblue lights from above fell with ghastly effect upon the delicate tilted\nface and closed eyes. Cliffe bent over her in a sharp alarm, and saw\nthat she had fainted away.\n\n\n\n\nPART V\n\nREQUIESCAT\n\n\n     \"Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens,\n     Dusk the hall with yew!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\n\"How strange!\" thought the Dean, as he once more stepped back into the\nstreet to look at the front of the Home Secretary's house in Hill\nStreet. \"He is certainly in town.\"\n\nFor, according to the _Times_, William Ashe the night before had been\nhotly engaged in the House of Commons fighting an important bill, of\nwhich he was in charge, through committee. Yet the blinds of the house\nin Hill Street were all drawn, and the Dean had not yet succeeded in\ngetting any one to answer the bell.\n\nHe returned to the attack, and this time a charwoman appeared. At sight\nof the Dean's legs and apron, she dropped a courtesy, or something like\none, informing him that they had workmen in the house and Mr. Ashe was\n\"staying with her ladyship.\"\n\nThe Dean took the Tranmores' number in Park Lane and departed thither,\nnot without a sad glance at the desolate hall behind the charwoman and\nat the darkened windows of the drawing-room overhead. He thought of that\nMay day two years before when he had dropped in to lunch with Lady\nKitty; his memory, equally effective whether it summoned the detail of\nan English chronicle or the features of a face once seen, placed firm\nand clear before him the long-chinned fellow at Lady Kitty's left, to\nwhose villany that empty and forsaken house bore cruel witness. And the\nlittle lady herself--what a radiant and ethereal beauty! Ah me! ah me!\n\nHe walked on in meditation, his hands behind his back. Even in this May\nLondon the little Dean was capable of an abstracted spirit, and he had\nstill much to think over. He had his appointment with Ashe. But Ashe had\nwritten--evidently in a press of business--from the House, and had\nomitted to mention his temporary change of address. The Dean regretted\nit. He would rather have done his errand with Lady Kitty's injured\nhusband on some neutral ground, and not in Lady Tranmore's house.\n\nAt Park Lane, however, he was immediately admitted.\n\n\"Mr. Ashe will be down directly, sir,\" said the butler, as he ushered\nthe visitor into the commodious library on the ground-floor, which had\nwitnessed for so long the death-in-life of Lord Tranmore. But now Lord\nTranmore was bedridden up-stairs, with two nurses to look after him, and\nto judge from the aspect of the tables piled with letters and books, and\nfrom the armful of papers which a private secretary carried off with him\nas he disappeared before the Dean, Ashe was now fully at home in the\nroom which had been his father's.\n\nThere was still a fire in the grate, and the small Dean, who was a\nchilly mortal, stood on the rug looking nervously about him. Lord\nTranmore had been in office himself, and the room, with its bookshelves\nfilled with volumes in worn calf bindings, its solid writing-tables and\nleather sofas, its candlesticks and inkstands of old silver, slender and\nsimple in pattern, its well-worn Turkey carpet, and its political\nportraits--\"the Duke,\" Johnny Russell, Lord Althorp, Peel,\nMelbourne--seemed, to the observer on the rug, steeped in the typical\nhabit and reminiscence of English public life.\n\nWell, if the father, poor fellow, had been distinguished in his day, the\nson had gone far beyond him. The Dean ruminated on a conversation\nwherewith he had just beguiled his cup of tea at the Athen\u00c3\u00a6um--a\nconversation with one of the shrewdest members of Lord Parham's cabinet,\na \"new man,\" and an enthusiastic follower of Ashe.\n\n\"Ashe is magnificent! At last our side has found its leader. Oh! Parham\nwill disappear with the next appeal to the country. He is getting too\ninfirm! Above all, his eyes are nearly gone; his oculist, I hear, gives\nhim no more than six months' sight, unless he throws up. Then Ashe will\ntake his proper place, and if he doesn't make his mark on English\nhistory, I'm a Dutchman. Oh! of course that affair last year was an\nawful business--the two affairs! When Parliament opened in February\nthere were some of us who thought that Ashe would never get through the\nsession. A man so changed, so struck down, I have seldom seen. You\nremember what a handsome boy he was, up to last year even! Now he's a\nmiddle-aged man. All the same, he held on, and the House gave him that\nquiet sympathy and support that it can give when it likes a fellow. And\ngradually you could see the life come back into him--and the ambition.\nBy George! he did well in that trade-union business before Easter; and\nthe bill that's on now--it's masterly, the way in which he's piloting it\nthrough! The House positively likes to be managed by him; it's a sight\nworthy of our best political traditions. Oh yes, Ashe will go far; and,\nthank God, that wretched little woman--what has become of her,\nby-the-way?--has neither crushed his energy nor robbed England of his\nservices. But it was touch and go.\"\n\nTo all of which the Dean had replied little or nothing. But his heart\nhad sunk within him; and the doubtfulness of a certain enterprise in\nwhich he was engaged had appeared to him in even more startling colors\nthan before.\n\nHowever, here he was. And suddenly, as he stood before the fire, he\nbowed his white head, and said to himself a couple of verses from one of\nthe Psalms for the day:\n\n     \"Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?\n     Oh, be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.\"\n\nThe door opened, and the Dean straightened himself impetuously, every\nnerve tightening to its work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How do you do, my dear Dean?\" said Ashe, enclosing the frail, ascetic\nhand in both his own. \"I trust I have not kept you waiting. My mother\nwas with me. Sit there, please; you will have the light behind you.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I prefer standing a little, if you don't mind--and I like\nthe fire.\"\n\nAshe threw himself into a chair and shaded his eyes with his hand. The\nDean noticed the strains of gray in his curly hair, and that aspect, as\nof something withered and wayworn, which had invaded the man's whole\npersonality, balanced, indeed, by an intellectual dignity and\ndistinction which had never been so commanding. It was as though the\nstern and constant wrestle of the mind had burned away all lesser\nthings--the old, easy grace, the old, careless pleasure in life.\n\n\"I think you know,\" began the Dean, clearing his throat, \"why I asked\nyou to see me?\"\n\n\"You wished, I think, to speak to me--about my wife,\" said Ashe, with\ndifficulty.\n\nUnder his sheltering hand, his eyes looked straight before him into the\nfire.\n\nThe Dean fidgeted a moment, lifted a small Greek vase on the\nmantel-piece, and set it down--then turned round.\n\n\"I heard from her ten days ago--the most piteous letter. As you know, I\nhad always a great regard for her. The news of last year was a sharp\nsorrow to me--as though she had been a daughter. I felt I must see her.\nSo I put myself into the train and went to Venice.\"\n\nAshe started a little, but said nothing.\n\n\"Or, rather, to Treviso, for, as I think you know, she is there with\nLady Alice.\"\n\n\"Yes, that I had heard.\"\n\nThe Dean paused again, then moved a little nearer to Ashe, looking down\nupon him.\n\n\"May I ask--stop me if I seem impertinent--how much you know of the\nhistory of the winter?\"\n\n\"Very little!\" said Ashe, in a low voice. \"My mother got some\ninformation from the English consul at Trieste, who is a friend of\nhers--to whom, it seems, Lady Kitty applied; but it did not amount to\nmuch.\"\n\nThe Dean drew a small note-book from a breast-pocket and looked at some\nentries in it.\n\n\"They seem to have reached Marinitza in November If I understood aright,\nLady Kitty had no maid with her?\"\n\n\"No. The maid Blanche was sent home from Verona.\"\n\n\"How Lady Kitty ever got through the journey!--or the winter!\" said the\nDean, throwing up his hands. \"Her health, of course, is irreparably\ninjured. But that she did not die a dozen times over, of hardship and\nmisery, is the most astonishing thing! They were in a wretched village,\nnearly four thousand feet up, a village of wooden huts, with a wooden\nhospital. All the winter nearly they were deep in snow, and Lady Kitty\nworked as a nurse. Cliffe seems to have been away fighting, very often,\nand at other times came back to rest and see to supplies.\"\n\n\"I understand she passed as his wife?\" said Ashe.\n\nThe Dean made a sign of reluctant assent.\n\n\"They lived in a little house near the hospital. She tells me that after\nthe first two months she began to loathe him, and she moved into the\nhospital to escape him. He tried at first to melt and propitiate her;\nbut when he found that it was no use, and that she was practically lost\nto him, he changed his temper, and he might have behaved to her like the\ntyrant he is but that her hold over the people among whom they were\nliving, both on the fighting-men and the women, had become by this time\ngreater than his own. They adored her, and Cliffe dared not ill-treat\nher. And so it went on through the winter. Sometimes they were on more\nfriendly terms than at others. I gather that when he showed his\ndare-devil, heroic side she would relent to him, and talk as though she\nloved him. But she would never go back--to live with him; and that after\na time alienated him completely. He was away more and more; and at last\nshe tells me there was a handsome Bosnian girl, and--well, you can\nimagine the rest. Lady Kitty was so ill in March that they thought her\ndying, but she managed to write to this consul you spoke of at Trieste,\nand he sent up a doctor and a nurse. But this you probably know?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ashe, hoarsely. \"I heard that she was apparently very ill\nwhen she reached Treviso, but that she had rallied under Alice's\nnursing. Lady Alice wrote to my mother.\"\n\n\"Did she tell Lady Tranmore anything of Lady Kitty's state of mind?\"\nsaid the Dean, after a pause.\n\nAshe also was slow in answering. At last he said:\n\n\"I understand there has been great regret for the past.\"\n\n\"Regret!\" cried the Dean. \"If ever there was a terrible case of the\ndealings of God with a human soul--\"\n\nHe began to walk up and down impetuously, wrestling with emotion.\n\n\"Did she give you any explanation,\" said Ashe, presently, in a voice\nscarcely audible--\"of their meeting at Verona? You know my mother\nbelieved--that she had broken with him--that all was saved. Then came a\nletter from the maid, written at Kitty's direction, to say that she had\nleft her mistress--and they had started for Bosnia.\"\n\n\"No; I tried. But she seemed to shrink with horror from everything to do\nwith Verona. I have always supposed that fellow in some way got the\ninformation he wanted--bought it no doubt--and pursued her. But that\nshe honestly meant to break with him I have no doubt at all.\"\n\nAshe said nothing.\n\n\"Think,\" said the Dean, \"of the effect of that man's sudden\nappearance--of his romantic and powerful personality--your wife alone,\nmiserable--doubting your love for her--\"\n\nAshe raised his hand with a gesture of passion.\n\n\"If she had had the smallest love left for me she could have protected\nherself! I had written to her--she knew--\"\n\nHis voice broke. The Dean's face quivered.\n\n\"My dear fellow--God knows--\" He broke off. When he recovered composure\nhe said:\n\n\"Let us go back to Lady Kitty. Regret is no word to express what I saw.\nShe is consumed by remorse night and day. She is also still--as far as\nmy eyes can judge--desperately ill. There is probably lung trouble\ncaused by the privations of the winter. And the whole nervous system is\nshattered.\"\n\nAshe looked up. His aspect showed the effect of the words.\n\n\"Every provision shall be made for her,\" he said, in a voice muffled and\ndifficult. \"Lady Alice has been told already to spare no expense--to do\neverything that can be done.\"\n\n\"There is only one thing that can be done for her,\" said the Dean.\n\nAshe did not speak.\n\n\"There is only one thing that you or any one else could do for her,\" the\nDean repeated, slowly, \"and that is to love--and forgive her!\" His\nvoice trembled.\n\n\"Was it her wish that you should come to me?\" said Ashe, after a moment.\n\n\"Yes. I found her at first very despairing--and extremely difficult to\nmanage. She regretted she had written to me, and neither Lady Alice nor\nI could get her to talk. But one day\"--the old man turned away, looking\ninto the fire, with his back to Ashe, and with difficulty pursued his\nstory--\"one day, whether it was, the sight of a paralyzed child that\nused to come to Lady Alice's lace-class, or some impression from the\nservice of the mass to which she often goes in the early mornings with\nher sister, I don't know, but she sent for me--and--and broke down\nentirely. She implored me to see you, and to ask you if she might live\nat Haggart, near the child's grave. She told me that according to every\ndoctor she has seen she is doomed, physically. But I don't think she\nwants to work upon your pity. She herself declares that she has much\nmore vitality than people think, and that the doctors may be all wrong.\nSo that you are not to take that into account. But if you will so far\nforgive her as to let her live at Haggart, and occasionally to go and\nsee her, that would be the only happiness to which she could now look\nforward, and she promises that she will follow your wishes in every\nrespect, and will not hinder or persecute you in any way.\"\n\nAshe threw up his hands in a melancholy gesture. The Dean understood it\nto mean a disbelief in the ability of the person promising to keep such\nan engagement. His face flushed--he looked uncertainly at Ashe.\n\n\"For my part,\" he said, quickly, \"I am not going to advise you for a\nmoment to trust to any such promise.\"\n\nRising from his seat, Ashe began to pace the room. The Dean followed him\nwith his eyes, which kindled more and more.\n\n\"But,\" he resumed, \"I none the less urge and implore you to grant Lady\nKitty's prayer.\"\n\nAshe slightly shook his head. The little Dean drew himself together.\n\n\"May I speak to you--with a full frankness? I have known and loved you\nfrom a boy. And\"--he stopped a moment, then said, simply--\"I am a\nChristian minister.\"\n\nAshe, with a sad and charming courtesy, laid his hand on the old man's\narm.\n\n\"I can only be grateful to you,\" he said, and stood waiting.\n\n\"At least you will understand me,\" said the Dean. \"You are not one of\nthe small souls. Well--here it is! Lady Kitty has been an unfaithful\nwife. She does not attempt to deny or cover it. But in my belief she\nloves you still, and has always loved you. And when you married her, you\nmust, I think, have realized that you were running no ordinary risks.\nThe position and antecedents of her mother--the bringing up of the poor\nchild herself--the wildness of her temperament, and the absence of\nanything like self-discipline and self-control, must surely have made\nyou anxious? I certainly remember that Lady Tranmore was full of fears.\"\n\nHe looked for a reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ashe, \"I was anxious. Or, rather, I saw the risks clearly.\nBut I was in love, and I thought that love could do everything.\"\n\nThe Dean looked at him curiously--hesitated--and at last said:\n\n\"Forgive me. Did you take your task seriously enough?--did you give Lady\nKitty all the help you might?\"\n\nThe blue eyes scanned Ashe's face. Ashe turned away, as though the words\nhad touched a sore.\n\n\"I know very well,\" he said, unsteadily, \"that I seemed to you and\nothers a weak and self-indulgent fool. All I can say is, it was not in\nme to play the tutor and master to my wife.\"\n\n\"She was so young, so undisciplined,\" said the Dean, earnestly. \"Did you\nguard her as you might?\"\n\nA touch of impatience appeared in Ashe.\n\n\"Do you really think, my dear Dean,\" he said, as he resumed his walk up\nand down, \"that one human being has, ultimately, any decisive power over\nanother? If so, I am more of a believer in--fate--or liberty--I am not\nsure which--than you.\"\n\nThe Dean sighed.\n\n\"That you were infinitely good and loving to her we all know.\"\n\n\"'Good'--'loving'?\" said Ashe, under his breath, with a note of scorn.\n\"I--\"\n\nHe restrained himself, hiding his face as he hung over the fire.\n\nThere was a silence, till the Dean once more placed himself in Ashe's\npath. \"My dear friend--you saw the risks, and yet you took them! You\nmade the vow 'for better, for worse.' My friend, you have, so to speak,\nlost your venture! But let me urge on you that the obligation remains!\"\n\n\"What obligation?\"\n\n\"The obligation to the life you took into your own hands--to the soul\nyou vowed to cherish,\" said the Dean, with an apostolic and passionate\nearnestness.\n\nAshe stood before him, pale, and charged with resolution.\n\n\"That obligation--has been cancelled--by the laws of your own Christian\nfaith, no less than by the ordinary laws of society.\"\n\n\"I do not so read it!\" cried the Dean, with vivacity. \"Men say so, 'for\nthe hardness of their hearts.' But the divine pity which transformed\nmen's idea of marriage could never have meant to lay it down that in\nmarriage alone there was to be no forgiveness.\"\n\n\"You forget your text,\" said Ashe, steadily. \"Saving for the cause--'\"\nHis voice failed him.\n\n\"Permissive!\" was the Dean's eager reply--\"permissive only. There are\ncases, I grant you--cases of impenitent wickedness--where the higher law\nis suspended, finds no chance to act--where relief from the bond is\nitself mercy and justice. But the higher law is always there. You know\nthe formula--'It was said by them of old time. But _I_ say unto you--'\nAnd then follows the new law of a new society. And so in marriage. If\nlove has the smallest room to work--if forgiveness can find the\nnarrowest foothold--love and forgiveness are imposed on--demanded\nof--the Christian!--here as everywhere else. Love and forgiveness--_not_\npenalty and hate!\"\n\n\"There is no question of hate--and--I doubt whether I am a Christian,\"\nsaid Ashe, quietly, turning away.\n\nThe Dean looked at him a little askance--breathing fast.\n\n\"But you are a _heart_, William!\" he said, using the privilege, of his\nwhite hairs, speaking as he might have spoken to the Eton boy of twenty\nyears before--\"ay, and one of the noblest. You gathered that poor thing\ninto your arms--knowing what were the temptations of her nature, and she\nbecame the mother of your child. Now--alas! those temptations have\nconquered her. But she still turns to you--she still clings to you--and\nshe has no one else. And if you reject her she will go down unforgiven\nand despairing to the grave.\"\n\nFor the first time Ashe's lips trembled. But his speech was very quiet\nand collected.\n\n\"I must try and explain myself,\" he said. \"Why should we talk of\nforgiveness? It is not a word that I much understand, or that means much\nto men of my type and generation. I see what has happened in this way.\nKitty's conduct last year hit me desperately hard. It destroyed my\nprivate happiness, and but for the generosity of the best friends ever\nman had it would have driven me out of public life. I warned her that\nthe consequences of the Cliffe matter would be irreparable, and she\nstill carried it through. She left me for that man--and at a time when\nby her own action it was impossible for me to defend either her or\nmyself. What course of action remained to me? I _did_ remember her\ntemperament, her antecedents, and the certainty that this man, whatever\nmight be his moments of heroism, was a selfish and incorrigible brute in\nhis dealings with women. So I wrote to her, through this same consul at\nTrieste. I let her know that if she wished it, and if there were any\nchance of his marrying her, I would begin divorce proceedings at once.\nShe had only to say the word. If she did not wish it, I would spare her\nand myself the shame and scandal of publicity. And if she left him, I\nwould make additional provision for her which would insure her every\ncomfort. She never sent a word of reply, and I have taken no steps. But\nas soon as I heard she was at Treviso, I wrote again--or, rather, this\ntime my lawyers wrote, suggesting that the time had come for the extra\nprovision I had spoken of, which I was most ready and anxious to make.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"And this,\" said the Dean, \"is all? This is, in fact, your answer to\nme?\"\n\nAshe made a sign of assent.\n\n\"Except,\" he added, with emotion, \"that I have heard, only to-day, that\nif Kitty wishes it, her old friend Miss French will go out to her at\nonce, nurse her, and travel with her as long as she pleases. Miss\nFrench's brother has just married, and she is at liberty. She is most\ndeeply attached to Kitty, and as soon as she heard Lady Alice's\nreport of her state she forgot everything else. Can you not\npersuade--Kitty\"--he looked up urgently--\"to accept her offer?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said the Dean, sadly. \"There is only one thing she pines\nfor, and without it she will be a sick child crossed. Ah! well--well! So\nto allow her to share your life again--however humbly and\nintermittently--is impossible?\"\n\nIt seemed to the Dean that a shudder passed through the man beside him.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Ashe, sharply. \"But not only for private reasons.\"\n\n\"You mean your public duty stands in the way?\"\n\n\"Kitty left me of her own free will. I have put my hand to the plough\nagain--and I cannot turn back. You can see for yourself that I am not at\nmy own disposal--I belong to my party, to the men with whom I act, who\nhave behaved to me with the utmost generosity.\"\n\n\"Of course Lady Kitty could no longer share your public life. But at\nHaggart--in seclusion?\"\n\n\"You know what her personality is--how absorbing--how impossible to\nforget! No--if she returned to me, on any terms whatever, all the old\nconditions would begin again. I should inevitably have to leave\npolitics.\"\n\n\"And that--you are not prepared to do?\"\n\nThe Dean wondered at his own audacity, and a touch of proud surprise\nexpressed itself in Ashe.\n\n\"I should have preferred to put it that I have accepted great tasks and\nheavy responsibilities--and that I am not my own master.\"\n\nThe Dean watched him closely. Across the field of imagination there\npassed the figure of one who \"went away sorrowful, having\ngreat possessions,\" and his heart--the heart of a child or a\nknight-errant--burned within him.\n\nBut before he could speak again the door of the room opened and a lady\nin black entered. Ashe turned towards her.\n\n\"Do you forbid me, William?\" she said, quietly--\"or may I join your\nconversation?\"\n\nAshe held out his hand and drew her to him. Lady Tranmore greeted her\nold friend the Dean, and he looked at her overcome with emotion and\ndoubt.\n\n\"You have come to us at a critical moment,\" he said--\"and I am afraid\nyou are against me.\"\n\nShe asked what they had been discussing, though, indeed, as she said,\nshe partly guessed. And the Dean, beginning to be shaken in his own\ncause, repeated his pleadings with a sinking heart. They sounded to him\nstranger and less persuasive than before. In doing what he had done he\nhad been influenced by an instinctive feeling that Ashe would not treat\nthe wrong done him as other men might treat it; that, to put it at the\nleast, he would be able to handle it with an ethical originality, to\nseparate himself in dealing with it from the mere weight of social\ntradition. Yet now as he saw the faces of mother and son together--the\nmother leaning on the son's arm--and realized all the strength of the\nsocial ideas which they represented, even though, in Ashe's case, there\nhad been a certain individual flouting of them, futile and powerless in\nthe end--the Dean gave way.\n\n\"There--there!\" he said, as he finished his plea, and Lady Tranmore's\nsad gravity remained untouched. \"I see you both think me a dreamer of\ndreams!\"\n\n\"Nay, dear friend!\" said Lady Tranmore, with the melancholy smile which\nlent still further beauty to the refined austerity of her face; \"these\nthings seem possible to you, because you are the soul of goodness--\"\n\n\"And a pious old fool to boot!\" said the Dean, impatiently. \"But I am\nwilling--like St. Paul and my betters--to be a fool for Christ's sake.\nLady Tranmore, are you or are you not a Christian?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" she said, with composure, while her cheek flushed. \"But our\nLord did not ask impossibilities. He knew there were limits to human\nendurance--and human pardon--though there might be none to God's.\"\n\n\"'Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,'\" cried\nthe Dean. \"Where are the limits there?\"\n\n\"There are other duties in life besides that to a wife who has betrayed\nher husband,\" she said, steadily. \"You ask of William what he has not\nthe strength to give. His life was wrecked, and he has pieced it\ntogether again. And now he has given it to his country. That poor,\nguilty child has no claim upon it.\"\n\n\"But understand,\" said Ashe, interposing, with an energy that seemed to\nexpress the whole man--\"while I live, _everything_--short of what you\nask--that can be done to protect or ease her, shall be done. Tell her\nthat.\"\n\nHis features worked painfully. The Dean took up his hat and stick.\n\n\"And may I tell her, too,\" he said, pausing--\"that you forgive her?\"\n\nAshe hesitated.\n\n\"I do not believe,\" he said, at last, \"that she would attach any more\nmeaning to that word than I do. She would think it unreal. What's done\nis done.\"\n\nThe Dean's heart leaped up in the typical Christian challenge to the\nfatal and the irrevocable. While life lasts the lost sheep can always be\nsought and found; and love, the mystical wine, can always be poured into\nthe wounds of the soul, healing and recreating! But he said no more. He\nfelt himself humiliated and defeated.\n\nAshe and Lady Tranmore took leave of him with an extreme gentleness and\naffection. He would almost rather they had treated him ill. Yes, he was\nan optimist and a dreamer!--one who had, indeed, never grappled in his\nown person with the worst poisons and corrosions of the soul. Yet still,\nas he passed along the London streets--marked here and there by the\nnewspaper placards which announced Ashe's committee triumphs of the\nnight before--he was haunted anew by the immortal words:\n\n\"One thing thou lackest,\" ... and \"Come, follow me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAh!--could he have done such a thing himself? or was he merely the\nscribe carelessly binding on other men's shoulders things grievous to be\nborne? The answering passion of his faith mounted within him--joined\nwith a scorn for the easy conditions and happy, scholarly pursuits of\nhis own life, and a thirst which in the early days of Christendom would\nhave been a thirst for witness and for martyrdom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree days later the Dean--a somewhat shrunken and diminished figure, in\nordinary clerical dress, without the buckles and silk stockings that\ntypically belonged to him--stood once more at the entrance of a small\nvilla outside the Venetian town of Treviso.\n\nHe was very weary, and as he sought disconsolately through all his\npockets for the wherewithal to pay his fly, while the spring rain\npattered on his wide-awake, he produced an impression as of some\ndelicate, draggled thing, which would certainly have gone to the heart\nof his adoring wife could she have beheld it. The Dean's ways were not\nsybaritic. He pecked at food and drink like a bird; his clothes never\ncaused him a moment's thought; and it seemed to him a waste of the night\nto use it for sleeping. But none the less did he go through life finely\nlooked after. Mrs. Winston dressed him, took his tickets and paid his\ncabs, and without her it was an arduous matter for the Dean to arrive at\nany destination whatever. As it was, in the journey from Paris he had\nlost one of the two bags which Mrs. Winston had packed for him, and he\nlooked remorsefully at the survivor as it was deposited on the steps\nbeside him.\n\nIt did not, however, remain on the steps. For when Lady Alice's\nmaid-housekeeper appeared, she informed the Dean, with a certain flurry\nof manner, that the ladies were not at home. They had gone off that\nmorning--suddenly--to Venice, leaving a letter for him, should he\narrive.\n\n\"_Fermate!_\" cried the Dean, turning towards the cab, which was trailing\naway, and the man, who had been scandalously overpaid, came back with\nalacrity, while the Dean stepped in to read the letter.\n\nWhen he came out again he was very pale and in a great haste. He bade\nthe man replace the bag and drive him at once to the railway-station.\n\nOn the way thither he murmured to himself, \"Horrible!--horrible!\"--and\nboth the letter and a newspaper which had been enclosed in it shook in\nhis hands.\n\nHe had half an hour to wait before the advent of the evening train for\nVenice, and he spent it in a quiet corner poring over the newspaper. And\nnot that newspaper only, for he presently became aware that all the\nsmall, ill-printed sheets offered him by an old newsvender in the\nstation were full of the same news, and some with later detail--nay,\nthat the people walking up and down in the station were eagerly talking\nof it.\n\nAn Englishman had been assassinated in Venice. It seemed that a body had\nbeen discovered early on the preceding morning floating in one of the\nsmall canals connecting the Fondamente Nuove with the Grand Canal. It\nhad been stabbed in three places; two of the wounds must have been\nfatal. The papers in the pocket identified the murdered man as the\nfamous English traveller, poet, and journalist, Mr. Geoffrey Cliffe. Mr.\nCliffe had just returned from an arduous winter in the Balkans, where he\nhad rendered superb service to the cause of the Bosnian insurgents. He\nwas well known in Venice, and the terrible event had caused a profound\nsensation there. No clew to the outrage had yet been obtained. But Mr.\nCliffe's purse and watch had not been removed.\n\nThe Dean arrived in Venice by the midnight train, and went to the hotel\non the Riva whither Lady Alice had directed him. She was still up,\nwaiting to see him, and in the dark passage outside Kitty's door she\ntold him what she knew of the murder. It appeared that late that night a\nstartling arrest had been made--of no less a person than the Signorina\nRicci, the well-known actress of the Apollo Theatre, and of two men\nsupposed to have been hired by her for the deed. This news was still\nunknown to Kitty--she was in bed, and her companion had kept it from\nher.\n\n\"How is she?\" asked the Dean.\n\n\"Frightfully excited--or else dumb. She let me give her something to\nmake her sleep. Strangely enough, she said to me this morning on the\nway from Treviso: 'It is a woman--and I know her!'\"\n\nThe following day, when the Dean entered the dingy hotel sitting-room, a\nthin figure in black came hurriedly out of the bedroom beside it, and\nKitty caught him by the hand.\n\n\"Isn't it horrible?\" she said, staring at him with her changed,\ndark-rimmed eyes. \"She tried once, in Bosnia. One of the Italians who\ncame out with us--she had got hold of him. Do you think--he suffered?\"\n\nHer voice was quite quiet. The Dean shuddered.\n\n\"One of the stabs was in the heart,\" he said. \"But try and put it from\nyou, Lady Kitty. Sit down.\" He touched her gently on the shoulder.\n\nKitty nodded.\n\n\"Ah, then,\" she said--\"_then_ he couldn't have suffered--could he? I'm\nglad.\"\n\nShe let the Dean put her in a chair, and, clasping her hands round her\nknees, she seemed to pursue her own thoughts.\n\nHer aspect affected him almost beyond bearing. Ashe's brilliant\nwife?--London's spoiled child?--this withered, tragic little creature,\nof whom it was impossible to believe that, in years, she was not yet\ntwenty-four? So bewildered in mind, so broken in nerve was she, that it\nwas not till he had sat with her some time, now entering perforce into\nthe cloud of horror that brooded over her, now striving to drag her from\nit, that she asked him about his visit to England.\n\nHe told her in a faltering voice.\n\nShe received it very quietly, even with a little, queer, twisting\nlaugh.\n\n\"I thought he wouldn't. Was Lady Tranmore there?\"\n\nThe Dean replied that Lady Tranmore had been there.\n\n\"Ah, then, of course there was no chance,\" said Kitty. \"When one is as\ngood as that, one never forgives.\"\n\nShe looked up quickly. \"Did William say he forgave me?\"\n\nThe Dean hesitated.\n\n\"He said a great deal that was kind and generous.\"\n\nA slight spasm passed over Kitty's face.\n\n\"I suppose he thought it ridiculous to talk of forgiving. So did\nI--once.\"\n\nShe covered her eyes with her hands--removing them to say, impatiently:\n\n\"One can't go on being sorry every moment of the day. No, one can't! Why\nare we made so? William would agree with me there.\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Kitty!\" said the Dean, tenderly--\"God forgives--and with Him\nthere is always hope, and fresh beginning.\"\n\nKitty shook her head.\n\n\"I don't know what that means,\" she said. \"I wonder whether\"--she looked\nat him with a certain piteous and yet affectionate malice--\"if you'd\nbeen as deep as I, whether _you_'d know.\"\n\nThe Dean flushed. The hidden wound stung again. Had he, then, no right\nto speak? He felt himself the elder son of the parable--and hated\nhimself anew.\n\nBut he was a Christian, on his Master's business. He must obey orders,\neven though he could feel no satisfaction, or belief in himself--though\nhe seem to himself such a shallow and perfunctory person. So he did his\ntender best for Kitty. He spent his loving, enthusiastic, pitiful soul\nupon her; and while he talked to her she sat with her hands crossed on\nher lap, and her eyes wandering through the open window to the forests\nof masts outside and the dancing wavelets of the lagoon. When at last he\nspoke of the further provision Ashe wished to make for her, when he\nimplored her to summon Margaret French, she shook her head. \"I must\nthink what I shall do,\" she said, quietly; and a minute afterwards, with\na flash of her old revolt--\"He cannot prevent my going to Harry's\ngrave!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly the following morning the murdered man was carried to the cemetery\nat San Michele. In spite of some attempt on the part of the police to\nkeep the hour secret, half Venice followed the black-draped barca, which\nbore that flawed poet and dubious hero to his rest.\n\nIt was a morning of exceeding beauty. On the mean and solitary front of\nthe Casa dei Spiriti there shone a splendor of light; the lagoon was\nazure and gold; the main-land a mist of trees in their spring leaf;\nwhile far away the cypresses of San Francesco, the slender tower of\nTorcello, and the long line of Murano--and farther still the majestic\nwall of silver Alps--greeted the eyes that loved them, as the ear is\nsoothed by the notes of a glorious and yet familiar music.\n\nAmid the crowd of gondolas that covered the shallow stretch of lagoon\nbetween the northernmost houses of Venice and the island graveyard,\nthere was one which held two ladies. Alice Wensleydale was there against\nher will, and her pinched and tragic face showed her repulsion and\nirritation. She had endeavored in vain to dissuade Kitty from coming;\nbut in the end she had insisted on accompanying her. Possibly, as the\nboat glided over the water amid a crowd of laughing, chattering\nItalians, the silent Englishwoman was asking herself what was to be the\nfuture of the trust she had taken on herself. Kitty in her extremity had\nremembered her half-sister's promise, and had thrown herself upon it.\nBut a few weeks' experience had shown that they were strange and\nuncongenial to each other. There was no true affection between\nthem--only a certain haunting instinct of kindred. And even this was\nweakened or embittered by those memories in Alice's mind which Kitty\ncould never approach and Alice never forget. What was she to do with her\nhalf-sister, stranded and dishonored as she was?--How content or comfort\nher?--How live her own life beside her?\n\nKitty sat silent, her eyes fixed upon the barca which held the coffin\nunder its pall. Her mind was the scene of an infinite number of floating\nand fragmentary recollections; of the day when she and Cliffe had\nfollowed the _murazzi_ towards the open sea; of the meeting at Verona;\nof the long winter, with its hardship and its horror; and that hatred\nand contempt which had sprung up between them. Could she love no one,\ncling faithfully to no one? And now the restless brain, the vast\nprojects, the mixed nature, the half-greatness of the man had been\nsilenced--crushed--in a moment, by the stroke of a knife. He had been\nkilled by a jealous woman--because of his supposed love for another\nwoman, whose abhorrence, in truth, he had earned in a few short weeks.\nThere was something absurd mingled with the horror--as though one\nwatched the prank of a demon.\n\nHer sensuous nature was tormented by the thought of the last moment. Had\nhe had time to feel despair--the thirst for life? She prayed not. She\nthought of the Sunday afternoon at Grosville Park when they had tried to\nplay billiards, and Lord Grosville had come down on them; or she saw him\nsitting opposite to her, at supper, on the night of the fancy ball, in\nthe splendid Titian dress, while she gloated over the thoughts of the\ntrick she had played on Mary Lyster--or bending over her when she woke\nfrom her swoon at Verona. Had she ever really loved him for one\nhour?--and if not, what possible excuse, before gods or men, was there\nfor this ugly, self-woven tragedy into which she had brought herself and\nhim, merely because her vanity could not bear that William had not been\nable to love her, for long, far above all her deserts?\n\nWilliam! Her heart leaped in her breast. He was thirty-six--and she not\ntwenty-four. A strange and desolate wonder overtook her as the thought\nseized her of the years they might still spend on the same\nearth--members of the same country, breathing the same air--and yet\nforever separate. Never to see him--or speak to him again!--the thought\nstirred her imagination, as it were, while it tortured her; there was in\nit a certain luxury and romance of pain.\n\nThus, as she followed Cliffe to his last blood-stained rest, did her\nmind sink in dreams of Ashe--and in the dismal reckoning up of all that\nshe had so lightly and inconceivably lost. Sometimes she found herself\nabsorbed in a kind of angry marvelling at the strength of the old moral\ncommonplaces.\n\nIt had been so easy and so exciting to defy them. Stones which the\nbuilders of life reject--do they still avenge themselves in the old way?\nThere was a kind of rage in the thought.\n\nOn the way home Kitty expressed a wish to go into St. Mark's alone. Lady\nAlice left her there, and in the shadow of the atrium Kitty looked at\nher strangely, and kissed her.\n\nAn hour after Lady Alice had reached the hotel a letter was brought to\nher. In it Kitty bade her--and the Dean--farewell, and asked that no\neffort should be made to track her. \"I am going to friends--where I\nshall be safe and at peace. Thank you both with all my heart. Let no one\nthink about me any more.\"\n\nOf course they disobeyed her. They made what search in Venice they\ncould, without rousing a scandal, and Ashe rushed out to join it, using\nthe special means at a minister's disposal. But it was fruitless. Kitty\nvanished like a wraith in the dawn; and the living world of action and\naffairs knew her no more.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\n\"Well, I must have a carriage!\" said William Ashe to the landlord of one\nof the coaching inns of Domo Dossola--\"and if you can't give me one for\nless, I suppose I shall have to pay this most ridiculous charge. Tell\nthe man to put to at once.\"\n\nThe landlord who owned the carriages, and would be sitting snugly at\nhome while the peasant on the box faced the elements in consideration of\na large number of extra francs to his master, retired with a deferential\nsmile, and told Emilio to bring the horses.\n\nMeanwhile Ashe finished an indifferent dinner, paid a large bill, and\nwent out to survey the preparations for departure, so far as the pelting\nrain in the court-yard would let him. He was going over the Simplon,\nstarting rather late in the day, and the weather was abominable. His\nvalet, Richard Dell, kept watch over the luggage and encouraged the\nostlers, with a fairly stoical countenance. He was an old traveller, and\nthough he would have preferred not to travel in a deluge, he disliked\nItaly, as a country of sour wine, and would be glad to find himself\nacross the Alps. Moreover, he knew the decision of his master's\ncharacter, and, being a man of some ability and education, he took a\npride in the loftiness of the affairs on which Ashe was generally\nengaged. If Mr. Ashe said that he _must_ get to Geneva the following\nmorning, and to London the morning after, on important business--why, he\n_must_, and it was no good talking about weather.\n\nThey rattled off through the streets of Domo Dossola, Dell in front with\nthe driver, under a waterproof hood and apron, Ashe in the closed landau\nbehind, with a plentiful supply of books, newspapers, and cigars to\nwhile away the time.\n\nAt Isella, the frontier village, he took advantage of the custom-house\nformalities and of a certain lull in the storm to stroll a little in\nfront of the inn. On the Italian side, looking east, there was a certain\nwild lifting of the clouds, above the lower course of the stream\ndescending from the Gondo ravine; upon the distant meadows and mountain\nslopes that marked the opening of the Tosa valley, storm-lights came and\nwent, like phantom deer chased by the storm-clouds; beside him the\nswollen river thundered past, seeking a thirsty Italy; and behind, over\nthe famous Gondo cleft, lay darkness, and a pelting tumult of rain.\n\nAshe turned back to the carriage, bidding a silent farewell to a country\nhe did not love--a country mainly significant to him of memories which\nrose like a harsh barrier between his present self and a time when he,\ntoo, fleeted life carelessly, like other men, and found every hour\ndelightful. Never, as long as he lived, should he come willingly to\nItaly. But his mother this year had fallen into such an exhaustion of\nbody and mind, caused by his father's long agony, that he had persuaded\nher to let him carry her over the Alps to Stresa--a place she had known\nas a girl and of which she often spoke--for a Whitsuntide holiday. He\nhimself was no longer in office. A coalition between the Tories and\ncertain dissident Liberals had turned out Lord Parham's government in\nthe course of a stormy autumn session, some eight months before. It had\nbeen succeeded by a weak administration, resting on two or three loosely\nknit groups--with Ashe as leader of the Opposition. Hence his\ncomparative freedom, and the chance to be his mother's escort.\n\nBut at Stresa he had been overtaken by some startling political\nnews--news which seemed to foreshadow an almost immediate change of\nministry; and urgent telegrams bade him return at once. The coalition on\nwhich the government relied had broken down; the resignation of its\nchief, a \"transient and embarrassed phantom,\" was imminent; and it was\npractically certain, in the singular dearth of older men on his own\nside, since the retirement of Lord Parham, that within a few weeks, if\nnot days, Ashe would be called upon to form an administration....\n\nThe carriage was soon on its way again, and presently, in the darkness\nof the superb ravine that stretches west and north from Gondo, the\ntumult of wind and water was such that even Ashe's slackened pulses felt\nthe excitement of it. He left the carriage, and, wrapped in a waterproof\ncape, breasted the wind along the water's edge. Wordsworth's magnificent\nlines in the \"Prelude,\" dedicated to this very spot, came back to him,\nas to one who in these later months had been able to renew some of the\nliterary habits and recollections of earlier years\n\n     \"--Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light!\"\n\nBut here on this wild night were only tumult and darkness; and if Nature\nin this aspect were still to be held, as Wordsworth makes her, the Voice\nand Apocalypse of God, she breathed a power pitiless and terrible to\nman. The fierce stream below, the tiny speck made by the carriage and\nhorses straining against the hurricane of wind, the forests on the\nfarther bank climbing to endless heights of rain, the flowers in the\nrock crannies lashed and torn, the gloom and chill which had thus\nblotted out a June evening: all these impressions were impressions of\nwar, of struggle and attack, of forces unfriendly and overwhelming.\n\nA certain restless and melancholy joy in the challenge of the storm,\nindeed, Ashe felt, as many another strong man has felt before him, in a\nsimilar emptiness of heart. But it was because of the mere provocation\nof physical energy which it involved; not, as it would have been with\nhim in youth, because of the infinitude and vastness of nature,\nbreathing power and expectation into man:\n\n     \"Effort, and expectation and desire--\n     And something evermore about to be!\"\n\nHe flung the words upon the wind, which scattered them as soon as they\nwere uttered, merely that he might give them a bitter denial, reject for\nhimself, now and always, the temper they expressed. He had known it\nwell, none better!--gone to bed, and risen up with it--the mere joy in\nthe \"mere living.\" It had seasoned everything, twined round everything,\ngreat and small--a day's trout-fishing or deer-stalking; a new book, a\nfriend, a famous place; then politics, and the joys of power.\n\nGone! Here he was, hurrying back to England, to take perhaps in his\nstill young hand the helm of her vast fortunes; and of all the old\n\"expectation and desire,\" the old passion of hope, the old sense of the\nmagic that lies in things unknown and ways untrodden, he seemed to\nhimself now incapable. He would do his best, and without the political\nwrestle life would be too trifling to be borne; but the relish and the\nsavor were gone, and all was gray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAh!--he remembered one or two storm-walks with Kitty in their engaged or\nearly married days--in Scotland chiefly. As he trudged up this Swiss\npass he could see stretches of Scotch heather under drifting mist, and\nfeel a little figure in its tweed dress flung suddenly by the wind and\nits own soft will against his arm. And then, the sudden embrace, and the\nwet, fragrant cheek, and her Voice--mocking and sweet!\n\nOh, God! where was she now? The shock of her disappearance from Venice\nhad left in some ways a deeper mark upon him than even the original\ncatastrophe. For who that had known her could think of such a being,\nalone, in a world of strangers, without a peculiar dread and anguish?\nThat she was alive he knew, for her five hundred a year--and she had\nnever accepted another penny from him since her flight--was still drawn\non her behalf by a banking firm in Paris. His solicitors, since the\nfailure of their first efforts to trace her after Cliffe's death, had\nmade repeated inquiries; Ashe had himself gone to Paris to see the\nbankers in question. But he was met by their solemn promise to Kitty to\nkeep her secret inviolate. Madame d'Estr\u00c3\u00a9es supplied him with the name\nof the convent in which Kitty had been brought up; but the mother\nsuperior denied all knowledge of her. Meanwhile no course of action on\nKitty's part could have restored her so effectually to her place in\nAshe's imagination. She haunted his days and nights. So also did his\nmemory of the Dean's petition. Insensibly, without argument, the whole\nattitude of his mind thereto had broken down; since he had been out of\noffice, and his days and nights were no longer absorbed in the detail of\nadministration and Parliamentary leadership, he had been the defenceless\nprey of grief; yearning and pity and agonized regret, rising from the\ndeep subconscious self, had overpowered his first recoil and\ndetermination; and in the absence of all other passionate hope, the one\ndesire and dream which still lived warm and throbbing at his heart was\nthe dream that still in some crowd, or loneliness, he might again,\nbefore it was too late, see Kitty's face and the wildness of Kitty's\neyes.\n\nAnd he believed much the same process had taken place in his mother's\nfeeling. She rarely spoke of Kitty; but when she did the doubt and\nsoreness of her mind were plain. Her own life had grown very solitary.\nAnd in particular the old friendship between her and Polly Lyster had\nentirely ceased to be. Lady Tranmore shivered when she was named, and\nwould never herself speak of her if she could help it. Ashe had tried in\nvain to make her explain herself. Surely it was incredible that she\ncould in any way blame Mary for the incident at Verona? Ashe, of course,\nremembered the passage in his mother's letter from Venice, and they had\nthe maid Blanche's report to Lady Tranmore, of Kitty's intentions when\nshe left Venice, of her terror when Cliffe appeared--of her swoon. But\nhe believed with the Dean that any treacherous servant could have\nbrought about the catastrophe. Vincenzo, one of the gondoliers who took\nKitty to the station, had seen the luggage labelled for Verona; no doubt\nCliffe had bribed him; and this explanation was, indeed, suggested to\nLady Tranmore by the maid. His mother's suspicion--if indeed she\nentertained it--was so hideous that Ashe, finding it impossible to make\nhis own mind harbor it for an instant, was harrowed by the mere\npossibility of its existence; as though it represented some hidden sore\nof consciousness that refused either to be probed or healed.\n\nAs he labored on against the storm all thought of his present life and\nactivities dropped away from him; he lived entirely in the past. \"What\nis it in me,\" he thought, \"that has made the difference between my life\nand that of other men I know--that weakened me so with Kitty?\" He\ncanvassed his own character, as a third person might have done.\n\nThe Christian, no doubt, would say that his married life had failed\nbecause God had been absent from it, because there had been in it no\nconsciousness of higher law, of compelling grace.\n\nAshe pondered what such things might mean. \"The Christian--in\nspeculative belief--fails under the challenge of life as often as other\nmen. Surely it depends on something infinitely more primitive and\nfundamental than Christianity?--something out of which Christianity\nitself springs? But this something--does it really exist--or am I only\ncheating myself by fancying it? Is it, as all the sages have said, the\npursuit of some eternal good, the identification of the self with\nit--the 'dying to live'? And is this the real meaning at the heart of\nChristianity?--at the heart of all religion?--the everlasting meaning,\nlet science play what havoc it please with outward forms and\nstatements?\"\n\nHad he, perhaps, _doubted the soul?_\n\nHe groaned aloud. \"O my God, what matter that I should grow wise--if\nKitty is lost and desolate?\"\n\nAnd he trampled on his own thoughts--feeling them a mere hypocrisy and\noffence.\n\nAs they left the Gondo ravine and began to climb the zigzag road to the\nSimplon inn, the storm grew still wilder, and the driver, with set lips\nand dripping face, urged his patient beasts against a deluge. The road\nran rivers; each torrent, carefully channelled, that passed beneath it\nbrought down wood and soil in choking abundance; and Ashe watched the\ndownward push of the rain on the high, exposed banks above the carriage.\nOnce they passed a fragment of road which had been washed away; the\ndriver pointing to it said something sulkily about \"_frane\"_ on the\n\"other side.\"\n\nThis bad moment, however, proved to be the last and worst, and when they\nemerged upon the high valley in which stands the village of Simplon, the\nrain was already lessening and the clouds rolling up the great sides and\npeaks of the Fletschhorn. Ashe promised himself a comparatively fine\nevening and a rapid run down to Brieg.\n\nOutside the old Simplon posting-house, however, they presently came upon\na crowd of vehicles of every description, of which the drivers were\nstanding in groups with dripping rugs across their shoulders--shouting\nand gesticulating.\n\nAnd as they drove up the news was thundered at them in every possible\ntongue. Between the hospice and B\u00c3\u00a9rizal two hundred metres of road had\nbeen completely washed away. The afternoon diligence had just got\nthrough by a miracle an hour before the accident occurred; before\nanything else could pass it would take at least ten or twelve hours'\nhard work, through the night, before the laborers now being\nrequisitioned by the commune could possibly provide even a temporary\npassage.\n\nAshe in despair went into the inn to speak with the landlord, and found\nthat unless he was prepared to abandon books and papers, and make a push\nfor it over mountain paths covered deep in fresh snow, there was no\npossible escape from the dilemma. He must stay the night. The navvies\nwere already on their way; and as soon as ever the road was passable he\nshould know. For not even a future Prime Minister of England could Herr\nLudwig do more.\n\nHe and Dell went gloomily up the narrow stone stairs of the inn to look\nat the bedrooms, which were low-roofed and primitive, penetrated\neverywhere by the roar of a stream which came down close behind the inn.\nThrough the open door of one of the rooms Ashe saw the foaming mass,\nframed as it were in a window, and almost in the house.\n\nHe chose two small rooms looking on the street, and bade Dell get a fire\nlit in one of them, a bed moved out, an arm-chair moved in, and as large\na table set for him as the inn could provide, while he took a stroll\nbefore dinner. He had some important letters to answer, and he pointed\nout to Dell the bag which contained them.\n\nThen he stepped out into the muddy street, which was still a confusion\nof horses, vehicles, and men, and, turning up a path behind the inn, was\nsoon in solitude. An evening of splendor! Nature was still in a tragic,\ndeclamatory mood--sending piled thunder-clouds of dazzling white across\na sky extravagantly blue, and throwing on the high snow-fields and\ncraggy tops a fierce, flame-colored light. The valley was resonant with\nangry sound, and the village, now in shadow, with its slender, crumbling\ncampanile, seemed like a cowering thing over which the eagle has passed.\n\nThe grandeur and the freshness, the free, elemental play of stream and\nsky and mountain, seized upon a man in whom the main impulses of life\nwere already weary, and filled him with an involuntary physical delight.\nHe noticed the flowers at his feet, in the drenched grass which was\nalready lifting up its battered stalks, and along the margins of the\nstreams--deep blue colombines, white lilies, and yellow anemones.\nIncomparable beauty lived and breathed in each foot of pasture; and when\nhe raised his eyes from the grass they fed on visionary splendors of\nsnow and rock, stretching into the heavens.\n\nNo life visible--except a line of homing cattle, led by a little girl\nwith tucked-up skirt and bare feet. And--in the distance--the slender\nfigure of a woman walking--stopping often to gather a flower--or to\nrest? Not a woman of the valley, clearly. No doubt a traveller,\nweather-bound like himself at the inn. He watched the figure a little,\nfor some vague grace of movement that seemed to enter into and make a\npart of that high beauty in which the scene was steeped; but it\ndisappeared behind a fold of pasture, and he did not see it again.\n\nIn spite of the multitude of vehicles gathered about the inn there were\nnot so many guests in the _salle-\u00c3\u00a0-manger_, when Ashe entered it, as he\nhad expected. He supposed that a majority of these vehicles must be\nreturn carriages from Brieg. Still there was much clatter of talk and\nplates, and German seemed to be the prevailing tongue. Except for a\ncouple whom Ashe took to be a Genevese professor and his wife, there was\nno lady in the room.\n\nHe lingered somewhat late at table, toying with his orange, and reading\na _Journal de Gen\u00c3\u00a8ve_, captured from a neighbor, which contained an\nexcellent \"London letter.\" The room emptied. The two Swiss handmaidens\ncame in to clear away soiled linen and arrange the tables for the\nmorning's coffee. Only, at a farther table, a _couvert_ for one person,\nset by itself, remained still untouched.\n\nHe happened to be alone in the room when the door again opened and a\nlady entered. She did not see him behind his newspaper, and she walked\nlanguidly to the farther table and sat down. As she did so she was\nseized with a fit of coughing, and when it was over she leaned her head\non her hands, gasping.\n\nAshe had half risen--the newspaper was crushed in his hand--when the\nSwiss waitress whom the men of the inn called Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna--who was,\nindeed, the daughter of the landlord--came back.\n\n\"How are you, madame?\" she said, with a smile, and in a slow English of\nwhich she was evidently proud.\n\n\"I'm better to-day,\" said the other, hastily. \"I shall start to-morrow.\nWhat a noise there is to-night!\" she added, in a tone both fretful and\nweary.\n\n\"We are so full--it is the accident to the road, madame. Will madame\nhave a _th\u00c3\u00a9 complet_ as before?\"\n\nThe lady nodded, and Fr\u00c3\u00a3ulein Anna, who evidently knew her ways, brought\nin the tea at once, stayed chatting beside her for a minute, and then\ndeparted, with a long, disapproving look at the gentleman in the corner\nwho was so long over his coffee and would not let her clear away.\n\nAshe made a fierce effort to still the thumping in his breast and decide\nwhat he should do. For the guests there was only one door of entrance or\nexit, and to reach it he must pass close beside the new-comer.\n\nHe laid down his newspaper. She heard the rustling, and involuntarily\nlooked round.\n\nThere was a slight sound--an exclamation. She rose. He heard and saw her\ncoming, and sat tranced and motionless, his eyes bent upon her. She came\ntottering, clinging to the chairs, her hand on her side, till she\nreached the corner where he was.\n\n\"William!\" she said, with a little, glad sob, under her\nbreath--\"William!\"\n\nHe himself could not speak. He stood there gazing at her, his lips\nmoving without sound. It seemed to him that she turned her head a\nmoment, as though to look for some one beside him--with an exquisite\ntremor of the mouth.\n\n\"Isn't it strange?\" she said, in the same guarded voice. \"I had a dream\nonce--a valley--and mountains--and an inn. You sat here--just like\nthis--and--\"\n\nShe put up her hands to her eyes a moment, shivered, and withdrew them.\nFrom her expression she seemed to be waiting for him to speak. He moved\nand stood beside her.\n\n\"Where can we talk?\" he said, with difficulty. She shook her head\nvaguely, looking round her with that slight frown, complaining and yet\nsweet, which was like a touch of fire on memory.\n\nThe waitress came back into the room.\n\n\"It _is_ odd to have met you here!\" said Kitty, in a laughing voice.\n\"Let us go into the _salon de lecture_. The maids want to clear away.\nPlease bring your newspaper.\"\n\nFr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna looked at them with a momentary curiosity, and went on\nwith her work. They passed into the passage-way outside, which was full\nof smokers overflowing from the crowded room beyond, where the humbler\nfrequenters of the inn ate and drank.\n\nKitty glanced round her in bewilderment. \"The _salon de lecture_ will be\nfull, too. Where shall we go?\" she said, looking up.\n\nAshe's hand clinched as it hung beside him. The old gesture--and the\ndrawn, emaciated face--they pierced the heart.\n\n\"I told my servant to arrange me a sitting-room up-stairs,\" he said,\nhurriedly, in her ear. \"Will you go up first?--number ten.\"\n\nShe nodded, and began slowly to mount the stairs, coughing as she went.\nThe man whom Ashe had taken for a Genevese professor looked after her,\nglanced at his neighbor, and shrugged his shoulders. \"Phthisique,\" he\nsaid, with a note of pity. The other nodded. \"Et d'un type tr\u00c3\u00a8s avanc\u00c3\u00a9!\"\n\nThey moved towards the door and stood looking into the night, which was\ndark with intermittent rain. Ashe studied a map of the commune which\nhung on the wall beside him, till at a moment when the passage had\nbecome comparatively clear he turned and went up-stairs.\n\nThe door of his improvised _salon_ was ajar. Beyond it his valet was\ncoming out of his bedroom with wet clothes over his arm. Ashe hesitated.\nBut the man had been with him through the greater part of his married\nlife, and was a good heart. He beckoned him back into the room he was\nleaving, and the two stepped inside.\n\n\"Dell, my good fellow, I want your help. I have just met my wife\nhere--Lady Kitty. You understand. Neither of us, of course,\nhad any idea. Lady Kitty is very ill. We wish to have a\nconversation--uninterrupted. I trust you to keep guard.\"\n\nThe young man, son of one of the Haggart gardeners, started and flushed,\nthen gave his master a look of sympathy.\n\n\"I'll do my best, sir.\"\n\nAshe nodded and went back to the next room. He closed the door behind\nhim. Kitty, who was sitting by the fire, half rose. Their eyes met. Then\nwith a stifled cry he flung himself down, kneeling beside her, and she\nsank into his arms. His tears fell on her face, anguish and pity\noverwhelmed him.\n\n\"You may!\" she said, brokenly, putting up her hand to his cheek, and\nkissing him--\"you may! I'm not mad or wicked now--and I'm dying!\"\n\nAgonized murmurs of love, pardon, self-abasement passed between them. It\nwas as though a great stream bore them on its breast; an awful and\nmajestic power enwrapped them, and made each word, each kiss, wonderful,\nsacramental. He drew himself away at last, holding her hair back from\nher brow and temples, studying her features, his own face convulsed.\n\n\"Where have you been? Why did you hide from me?\"\n\n\"You forbade me,\" she said, stroking his hair. \"And it was quite right.\nThe dear Dean told me--and I quite understood. If I'd gone to Haggart\nthen there'd have been more trouble. I should have tried to get my old\nplace back. And now it's all over. You can give me all I want, because I\ncan't live. It's only a question of months, perhaps weeks. Nobody could\nblame you, could they? People don't laugh when--it's death. It\nsimplifies things so--doesn't it?\"\n\nShe smiled, and nestled to him again.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he said, almost violently. \"Why are you so ill?\"\n\n\"It was Bosnia first, and then--being miserable--I suppose. And Poitiers\nwas very cold--and the nuns very stuffy, bless them--they wouldn't let\nme have air enough.\"\n\nHe groaned aloud while he remembered his winter in London, in the\nforlorn luxury of the Park Lane house.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Oh! I went to the Soeurs Blanches--you remember?--where I used to be.\nYou went there, didn't you?\"--he made a sign of miserable assent--\"but I\nmade them promise not to tell! There was an old mistress of novices\nthere still who used to be very fond of me. She got one of the houses of\nthe Sacr\u00c3\u00a9 Coeur to take me in--at Poitiers. They thought they were\ngathering a stray sheep back into the fold, you understand, as I was\nbrought up a Catholic--of sorts. And I didn't mind!\" The familiar\nintonation, soft, complacent, humorous, rose like a ghost between them.\n\"I used to like going to mass. But this Easter they wanted to make me\n'go to my duties'--you know what it means?--and I wouldn't. I wanted to\nconfess.\" She shuddered and drew his face down to hers again--\"but only\nonce--to--you--and then, well then, to die, and have done with it. You\nsee, I knew one can't get on long with three-quarters of a lung. And\nthey were rather tiresome--they didn't understand. So three weeks ago I\ndrew some money out and said good-bye to them. Oh! they were very kind,\nand very sorry for me. They wanted me to take a maid, and I meant to.\nBut the one they found wouldn't come with me when she saw how ill I\nwas--and it all lingered on--so one day I just walked out to the\nrailway-station and went to Paris. But Paris was rainy--and I felt I\nmust see the sun again. So I stayed two nights at a little hotel maman\nused to go to--horrid place!--and each night I read your speeches in the\nreading-room--and then I got my things from Poitiers, and started--\"\n\nA fit of coughing stopped her, coughing so terrible and destructive that\nhe almost rushed for help. But she restrained him. She made him\nunderstand that she wanted certain remedies from her own room across the\ncorridor. He went for them. The door of this room had been shut by the\nobservant Dell, who was watching the passage from his own bedroom\nfarther on. When Ashe had opened it he found himself face to face as it\nwere with the foaming stream outside. The window, as he had seen it\nbefore, was wide open to the water-fall just beyond it, and the\ntemperature was piercingly cold and damp. The furniture was of the\nroughest, and a few of Kitty's clothes lay scattered about. As he\nfumbled for a light, there hovered before his eyes the remembrance of\ntheir room in Hill Street, strewn with chiffons and all the elegant and\ncostly trifles that made the natural setting of its mistress.\n\nHe found the medicines and hurried back. She feebly gave him directions.\n\"Now the strychnine!--and some brandy.\"\n\nHe did all he could. He drew some chairs together before the fire, and\nmade a couch for her with pillows and rugs. She thanked him with smiles,\nand her eyes followed his every movement.\n\n\"Tell your man to get some milk! And listen\"--she caught his hand. \"Lock\nmy door. That nice woman down-stairs will come to look after me, and\nshe'll think I'm asleep.\"\n\nIt was done as she wished. Ashe took in the milk from Dell's hands, and\na fresh supply of wood. Then he turned the key in his own door and came\nback to her. She was lying quiet, and seemed revived.\n\n\"How cosey!\" she said, with a childish pleasure, looking round her at\nthe bare white walls and scoured boards warmed with the fire-light. The\nbitter tears swam in Ashe's eyes. He fell into a chair on the other side\nof the fire, and stared--seeing nothing--at the burning logs.\n\n\"You needn't suppose that I don't get people to look after me!\" she went\non, smiling at him again, one shadowy hand propping her cheek. And she\nprattled on about the kindness of the chambermaids at Vevey and Brieg,\nand how one of them had wanted to come with her as her maid. \"Oh! I\nshall find one at Florence if I get there--or a nurse. But just for\nthese few days I wanted to be free! In the winter there were so many\npeople about--so many eyes! I just pined to cheat them--get quit of\nthem. A maid would have bothered me to stay in bed and see doctors--and\nyou know, William, with this illness of mine you're so _restless_!\"\n\n\"Where were you going to?\" he said, without looking up.\n\n\"Oh! to Italy somewhere--just to see some flowers again--and the sun.\nOnly not to Venice!\"\n\nThere was a silence, which she broke by a sudden cry as she drew him\ndown to her.\n\n\"William! you know--I was coming home to you, when that man--found me.\"\n\n\"I know. If it had only been I who killed him!\"\n\n\"I'm just--_Kitty_!\" she said, choking--\"as bad as bad can be. But I\ncouldn't have done what Mary Lyster did.\"\n\n\"Kitty--for God's sake!\"\n\n\"Oh, I know it,\" she said, almost with triumph--\"now I _know_ it. I\ndetermined to know--and I got people in Venice to find out. She sent the\nmessage--that told him where I was--and I know the man who took it. I\nsuppose it would be pathetic if I sent her word that I had forgiven her.\nBut I _haven't_!\"\n\nAshe cried out that it was wholly and utterly inconceivable.\n\n[Illustration: \"HE DREW SOME CHAIRS TOGETHER BEFORE THE FIRE\"]\n\n\"Oh no!--she hated me because I had robbed her of Geoffrey. I had killed\nher life, I suppose--she killed mine. It was what I deserved, of\ncourse; only just at that moment--If there is a God, William, how could\nHe have let it happen so?\"\n\nThe tears choked her. He left his seat, and, kneeling beside her, he\nraised her in his arms, while she murmured broken and anguished\nconfessions.\n\n\"I was so weak--and frightened. And _he_ said, it was no good trying to\ngo back to you. Everybody knew I had gone to Verona--and he had followed\nme--No one would ever believe--And he wouldn't go--wouldn't leave me. It\nwould be mere cruelty and desertion, he said. My real life was--with\nhim. And I seemed--paralyzed. Who _had_ sent that message? It never\noccurred to me--I felt as if some demon held me--and I couldn't\nescape--\"\n\nAnd again the sighs and tears, which wrung his heart--with which his own\nmingled. He tried to comfort her; but what comfort could there be? They\nhad been the victims of a crime as hideous as any murder; and\nyet--behind the crime--there stretched back into the past the\npreparations and antecedents by which they themselves, alack, had\ncontributed to their own undoing. Had they not both trifled with the\nmysterious test of life--he no less than she? And out of the dark had\ncome the axe-stroke that ends weakness, and crushes the unsteeled,\ninconstant will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter long silence, she began to talk in a rambling, delirious way of\nher months in Bosnia. She spoke of the _cold_--of the high mountain\nloneliness--of the terrible sights she had seen--till he drew her,\nshuddering, closer into his arms. And yet there was that in her talk\nwhich amazed him; flashes of insight, of profound and passionate\nexperience, which seemed to fashion her anew before his eyes. The hard\npeasant life, in contact with the soil and natural forces; the elemental\nfacts of birth and motherhood, of daily toil and suffering; what it\nmeans to fight oppressors for freedom, and see your dearest--son, lover,\nwife, betrothed--die horribly amid the clash of arms; into this caldron\nof human fate had Kitty plunged her light soul; and in some ways Ashe\nscarcely knew her again.\n\nShe recurred often to the story of a youth, handsome and beardless, who\nhad been wounded by a stray Turkish shot in the course of the long climb\nto the village where she nursed. He had managed to gain the height, and\nthen, killed by the march as much as by the shot, he had sunk down to\ndie on the ground-floor of the house where Kitty lived.\n\n\"He was a stranger--no one knew him in the village--no one cared. They\nhad their own griefs. I dressed his wound--and gave him water. He\nthought I was his mother, and asked me to kiss him. I kissed him,\nWilliam--and he smiled once--before the last hemorrhage. If you had seen\nthe cold, dismal room--and his poor face!\"\n\nAshe gathered her to his breast. And after a while she said, with closed\neyes:\n\n\"Oh, what pain there is in the world, William!--what _pain_! That's\nwhat--I never knew.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe evening wore on. All the noises ceased down-stairs. One by one the\nguests came up the stone stairs and along the creaking corridor. Boots\nwere thrown out; the doors closed. The strokes of eleven o'clock rang\nout from the village campanile; and amid the quiet of the now drizzling\nrain the echoes of the bell lingered on the ear. Last of all a woman's\nstep passed the door--stopped at the door of Kitty's room, as though\nsome one listened, and then gently returned. \"Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna!\" said\nKitty--\"she's a good soul.\"\n\nSoon nothing was heard but the roar of the flooded stream on one side of\nthe old narrow building and the dripping of rain on the other. Their low\nvoices were amply covered by these sounds. The night lay before them,\nsafe and undisturbed. Candles burned on the mantel-piece, and on a table\nbehind Kitty's head was a paraffine lamp. She seemed to have a craving\nfor light.\n\n\"Kitty!\" said Ashe, suddenly bending over her--\"understand! I shall\nnever leave you again.\"\n\nShe started, her head fell back on his arm, and her brown eyes\nconsidered him:\n\n\"William! I saw the _Standard_ at Geneva. Aren't you going home--because\nof politics?\"\n\n\"A few telegrams will settle that. I shall take you to Geneva to-morrow.\nWe shall get doctors there.\"\n\nA little smile played about her mouth--a smile which did not seem to\nhave any reference to his words or to her next question.\n\n\"Nobody thinks of the book now, do they, William?\"\n\n\"No, Kitty, no! It's all forgotten, dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was abominable!\" She drew a long breath. \"But I can't help it--I\ndid get a horrid pleasure out of writing it--till Venice--till you left\noff loving me. Oh, William! William!--what a good thing it is I'm\ndying!\"\n\n\"Hush, Kitty--hush.\"\n\n\"It gives one such an unfair advantage, though, doesn't it? You can't\never be angry with me again. There won't be time. William, dear!--I\nhaven't had a brain like other people. I know it. It's only since I've\nbeen so ill--that I've been sane! It's a strange feeling--as though one\nhad been _bled_--and some poison had drained away. But it would never do\nfor me to take a turn and live! Oh no!--people like me are better safely\nunder the grass. Oh, my beloved! my beloved! I just want to say that all\nthe time, and nothing else--I've hungered so to say it!\"\n\nHe answered her with all the anguish, all the passionate, fruitless\ntenderness and vain comfortings that rise from the human heart in such a\nstrait. But when he asked her pardon for his hardness towards the Dean's\npetition, when he said that his conscience had tormented him\nthenceforward, she would scarcely hear a word.\n\n\"You did quite right,\" she said, peremptorily--\"quite right.\"\n\nThen she raised herself on her arm and looked at him.\n\n\"William!\" she said, with a strange, kindled expression. \"I--I don't\nthink I can live any more! I think--I'm dying--here--now!\"\n\nShe fell back on her pillows, and he sprang to his feet, crying that he\nmust go for Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna and a doctor. But she held him feebly,\nmotioning towards the brandy and strychnine. \"That's all--you can do.\"\n\nHe gave them to her, and again she revived and smiled at him.\n\n\"Don't be frightened. It was a sudden feeling--it came over me--that\nthis dear little room--and your arms--would be the end. Oh, how much\nbest! There!--that was foolish!--I'm better. It isn't only the lungs,\nyou see; they say the heart's worst. I nearly went at Vevey, one night.\nIt was such a long faint.\"\n\nThen she lay quiet, with her hand in his, in a dreamy, peaceful\nstate, and his panic subsided. Once she sent messages to Lady\nTranmore--messages full of sorrow, touched also--by a word here, a look\nthere--by the charm of the old Kitty.\n\n\"I don't deserve to die like this,\" she said, once, with a\nhalf-impatient gesture. \"Nothing can prevent it's being beautiful--and\ntouching--you know; our meeting like this--and your goodness to me. Oh,\nI'm glad! But I don't want to glorify--what I've done. _Shame! Shame!\"_\n\nAnd again her face contracted with the old habitual agony, only to be\nsoothed away gradually by his tone and presence, the spending of his\nwhole being in the broken words of love.\n\nTowards the morning, when, as it seemed to him, she had been sleeping\nfor a time, and he had been, if not sleeping, at least dreaming awake\nbeside her, he heard a little, low laugh, and looked round. Her brown\neyes were wide open, till they seemed to fill the small, blighted face;\nand they were fixed on an empty chair the other side of the fire.\n\n\"It's so strange--in this illness,\" she whispered--\"that it makes one\ndream--and generally kind dreams. It's fever--but it's nice.\" She turned\nand looked at him. \"Harry was there, William--sitting in that chair. Not\na baby any more--but a little fellow--and so lively, and strong, and\nquick. I had you both--_both_.\"\n\nLooking back afterwards, also, he remembered that she spoke several\ntimes of religious hopes and beliefs--especially of the hope in another\nlife--and that they seemed to sustain her. Most keenly did he recollect\nthe delicacy with which she had refrained from asking his opinion upon\nthem, lest it should trouble him not to be able to uphold or agree with\nher; while, at the same time, she wished him to have the comfort of\nremembering that she had drawn strength and calm, in these last hours,\nfrom religious thoughts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor they proved, indeed, to be the last hours. About three the morning\nbegan to dawn, clear and rosy, with rich lights striking on the snow.\nSuddenly Kitty sat up, disengaged herself from her wraps, and tottered\nto her feet.\n\n\"I'll go back to my room,\" she said, in bewilderment. \"I'd rather.\"\n\nAnd as she clung to him, with a startled yet half-considering look, she\ngazed round her, at the bright fire, the morning light, the chair from\nwhich he had risen--his face.\n\nHe tried to dissuade her. But she would go. Her aspect, however, was\ndeathlike, and as he softly undid the doors, and half-helped,\nhalf-carried her across the passage, he said to her that he must go and\nwaken Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna and find a doctor.\n\n\"No--no.\" She grasped him with all her remaining strength; \"stay with\nme.\"\n\nThey entered the little room, which seemed to be in a glory of light,\nfor the sun striking across the low roof of the inn had caught the foamy\nwater-fall beyond, and the reflection of it on the white walls and\nceiling was dazzling.\n\nBeside the bed she swayed and nearly fell.\n\n\"I won't undress,\" she murmured--\"I'll just lie down.\"\n\nShe lay down with his help, turning her face to make a fond, hardly\narticulate sound, and press her cheek against his. In a few minutes it\nseemed to him that she was sleeping again. He softly went out of the\nroom and down-stairs. There, early as it was, he found Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Anna,\nwho looked at him with amazement.\n\n\"Where can I find a doctor?\" he asked her; and they talked for a few\nminutes, after which she went up-stairs beside him, trembling and\nflushed.\n\nThey found Kitty lying on her side, her face hidden entirely in the\ncurls which had fallen across it, and one arm hanging. There was that in\nher aspect which made them both recoil. Then Ashe rushed to her with a\ncry, and as he passionately kissed her cold cheek he heard the clamor of\nthe frightened girl behind him. \"Ach, Gott!--Ach Gott!\"--and the voices\nof others, men and women, who began to crowd into the narrow room.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Marriage of William Ashe, by Mrs. Humphry Ward\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARRIAGE OF WILLIAM ASHE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14126-8.txt or 14126-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/4\/1\/2\/14126\/\n\nProduced by Andrew Templeton, Juliet Sutherland, Charlie Kirschner\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1203,"split":"test"}
