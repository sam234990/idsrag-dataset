Though deserted by most of his friends and embarrassed by deteriorating living conditions, he has maintained his reputation in Ujjayini as an honest and upright man with a rare gift of wisdom and many important men continue to seek his counsel.\nThough happily married and the recent father of a young son, Rohasena, Ch\u0101rudatta is enamored of Vasantasen\u0101, a courtesan of great wealth and reputation. At a chance encounter at the temple of K\u0101ma she returns his affection, though the matter is complicated when Vasantasen\u0101 finds herself pursued by Samsth\u0101naka, a half-mad brother-in-law of King P\u0101laka, and his retinue. When the men threaten violence, Vasantasen\u0101 flees, seeking safety with Ch\u0101rudatta. Their love blossoms following the clandestine meeting, and the courtesan entrusts her new lover with a casket of jewelry in an attempt to ensure a future meeting.\nHer plan is thwarted, however, when a thief, Sarvilaka, enters Ch\u0101rudatta\u2019s home and steals the jewels in an elaborate scheme to buy the freedom of his lover, Madanik\u0101, who is Vasantasen\u0101\u2019s slave and confidant. The courtesan recognizes the jewelry, but she accepts the payment anyway and frees Madanik\u0101 to marry. She then attempts to contact Ch\u0101rudatta and inform him of the situation, but before she can make contact he panics and sends Vasantasen\u0101 a rare pearl necklace that had belonged to his wife, a gift in great excess of the value of the stolen jewelry. In recognition of this, Ch\u0101rudatta's friend, Maitreya, cautions the Brahmin against further association, fearing that Vasantasen\u0101 is, at worst, scheming to take from Ch\u0101rudatta the few possessions he still has and, at best, a good-intentioned bastion of bad luck and disaster.\nRefusing to take this advice, Ch\u0101rudatta makes Vasantasen\u0101 his mistress and she eventually meets his young son. During the encounter, the boy is distressed because he has recently enjoyed playing with a friend's toy cart of solid gold and no longer wants his own clay cart that his nurse has made for him. Taking pity on him in his sadness, Vasantasen\u0101 fills his little clay cart with her own jewelry, heaping his humble toy with a mound of gold before departing to meet Ch\u0101rudatta in a park outside the city for a day\u2019s outing. There she enters a fine carriage, but soon discovers that she is in a gharry belonging to Samsth\u0101naka, who remains enraged by her previous affront and is madly jealous of the love and favor she shows to Ch\u0101rudatta. Unable to persuade his henchmen to kill her, Samsth\u0101naka sends his retinue away and proceeds to strangle Vasantasen\u0101 and hide her body beneath a pile of leaves. Still seeking vengeance, he promptly accuses Ch\u0101rudatta of the crime.\nThough the Ch\u0101rudatta proclaims his innocence, his presence in the park along with his son's possession of Vasantasen\u0101's jewels implicate the poverty-stricken man, and he is found guilty and condemned to death by King P\u0101laka. Unbeknownst to all, however, the body identified as Vasantasen\u0101\u2019s was actually another woman. Vasantasen\u0101 had been revived and befriended by a Buddhist monk who nursed her back to health in a nearby village.\nJust as Ch\u0101rudatta faces execution, Vasantasen\u0101 appears and, seeing the excited crowd, intervenes in time to save him from execution and his wife from throwing herself onto the funeral pyre. Together the three declare themselves a family. Reaching the courts, Vasantasen\u0101 tells the story of her near death and, following her testimony, Samsth\u0101naka is arrested and the good Prince \u0100ryaka deposes the wicked King P\u0101laka. His first acts as the newly declared sovereign is to restore Ch\u0101rudatta\u2019s fortune and give him an important position at court. Following this good will, Ch\u0101rudatta demonstrates in the final act his enduring virtue and charity, appealing to the King for pardon on behalf of Samsth\u0101naka who is subsequently declared free.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Little Clay Cart, by (Attributed To) King Shudraka\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Whatever the\noutcome of the negotiations for peace, one thing is sure: for better,\nfor worse, and whether we will or no, the West must know the East, and\nthe East must know the West. With that knowledge will inevitably come\nan interchange of potent influences, of influences that will affect\nprofoundly the religion and morals, the philosophy, the literature,\nthe art, in short, all the elements that make up the civilizations of\nthe two hemispheres. It is a part of the responsibility resting upon\nthe molders and leaders of the thought and life of our time, and upon\nour Universities in particular, to see to it that these new forces,\nmighty for good or for evil, are directed aright._\n\n_The fruitfulness of those scions of Western civilization which the\nJapanese have grafted upon their own stock is to-day the admiration\nof the world. In our wonder, let us not forget that that stock is the\ngrowth of centuries, and that it is rooted in a soil of racial character\ninformed by ethical ideals which we are wont to regard, with\narrogant self-complacency, as exclusively proper to Christianity, but\nwhich were, in fact, inculcated twenty-four centuries ago through\nprecept and example by Gotama the Enlightened, or, as the Hindus\ncalled him, Gotama the Buddha. It has often been said that India\nhas never influenced the development of humanity as a whole. Be that\nas it may, it now seems no less probable than strange that she is yet\ndestined to do so, on the one hand, indirectly, through the influence\nof Indian Buddhism upon Japan, and, on the other, directly, by the\ndiffusion in the West of a knowledge of her sacred writings, especially\nthose of Vedantism and Buddhism. To judge the East aright,\nwe must know not only what she is, but also how she has become what\nshe is; know, in short, some of the principal phases of her spiritual\nhistory as they are reflected in her ancient literature, especially that\nof India. To interpret to the West the thought of the East, to bring\nher best and noblest achievements to bear upon our life_,--_that is to-day\nthe problem of Oriental philology._\n\n_The Harvard Oriental Series embodies an attempt to present to Western\nscholars, in trustworthy texts and translations, some of the greatest\nworks of the Hindu literature and philosophy and religion, together\nwith certain instruments, such as the Vedic Concordance or the History\nof the Beast-fable, for their critical study or elucidation. Some\naccount of the volumes completed or in progress may be found at the\nend of this book. Dr. Ryder, passing by for the present the more\nmomentous themes of religion and philosophy, has in this volume\nattempted to show what the Indian genius, in its strength and in its\nweakness, could do in the field of literature pure and simple. The\ntimeliness of the Series as a whole is an eloquent tribute to the\ndiscernment of my loved and unforgotten pupil and friend, Henry Clarke\nWarren. In him were united not only the will and the ability to\nestablish such a publication as this, but also the learning and\ninsight which enabled him to forecast in a general way its\npossibilities of usefulness. He knew that the East had many a lesson\nto teach the West; but whether the lesson be repose of spirit or\nhygiene of the soldier in the field, whether it be the divine\nimmanence or simplicity of life or the overcoming of evil with good,\nhe knew that the first lesson to be taught us was the teachable habit\nof mind._\n\nC. R. L.\n\nJune, 1905\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThe text chosen as the basis of this translation is that given in the\nedition of Parab,[1] and I have chosen it for the following reasons.\nParab's edition is the most recent, and its editor is a most admirable\nSanskrit scholar, who, it seems to me, has in several places\nunderstood the real meaning of the text better than his predecessors.\nThis edition contains the comment of P\u00e1\u00b9\u009bthv\u00c4\u00abdhara; it is far freer from\nmisprints than many texts printed in India, and, in respect to\narrangement and typography, it is clear and convenient. Besides, it is\neasily obtainable and very cheap. This last consideration may prove to\nbe of importance, if the present translation should be found helpful\nin the class-room. For the sake of cataloguers, I note that the proper\ntransliteration of the Sanskrit names of this title according to the\nrules laid down by the American Library Association in its Journal for\n1885, is as follows: M\u00e1\u00b9\u009bcchaka\u00e1\u00b9\u00adika; \u00c3\u0087\u00c5\u00abdraka; P\u00e1\u00b9\u009bthv\u00c4\u00abdhara; K\u00c4\u0081\u00c3\u00a7\u00c4\u00abn\u00c4\u0081tha\nP\u00c4\u0081\u00e1\u00b9\u0087\u00e1\u00b8\u008duran\u00cc\u0084ga Paraba; Nir\u00e1\u00b9\u0087aya-S\u00c4\u0081gara.\n\nThe verse-numeration of each act follows the edition of Parab;\nfortunately, it is almost identical with the numeration in the editions\nof Godabole and J\u00c4\u00abv\u00c4\u0081nanda. For the convenience of those\nwho may desire to consult this book in connection with Stenzler's\nedition, I have added references at the top of the page to that edition\nas well as to the edition of Parab. In these references, the\nletter P. stands for Parab, the letter S. for Stenzler.\n\nThere are a few passages in which I have deviated from Parab's\ntext. A list of such passages is given on page 177. From this list\nI have omitted a few minor matters, such as slight misprints and\nwhat seem to me to be errors in the _ch\u00c4\u0081y\u00c4\u0081_; these matters, and the\npassages of unusual interest or difficulty, I shall treat in a series\nof notes on the play, which I hope soon to publish in the Journal\nof the American Oriental Society. It is hardly necessary to give\nreasons for the omission of the passage inserted by N\u00c4\u00ablaka\u00e1\u00b9\u0087\u00e1\u00b9\u00adha\nin the tenth act (Parab. 288.3-292.9). This passage is explicitly\ndeclared by tradition to be an interpolation by another hand, and\nit is clearly shown to be such by internal evidence. It will be noticed\nthat the omission of this passage causes a break in the verse-numeration\nof the tenth act, where the verse-number 54 is followed\nby the number 58.\n\nOf the books which have been useful to me in the present work,\nI desire to mention especially the editions of Stenzler, Godabole,\nJ\u00c4\u00abv\u00c4\u0081nanda Vidy\u00c4\u0081s\u00c4\u0081gara, and Parab; the commentaries of P\u00e1\u00b9\u009bthv\u00c4\u00abdhara,\nLall\u00c4\u0081d\u00c4\u00abk\u00e1\u00b9\u00a3ita, and J\u00c4\u00abv\u00c4\u0081nanda; further, the translations of\nWilson, Regnaud, and B\u00c3\u00b6htlingk.\n\nA number of friends were kind enough to read my manuscript,\nand each contributed something. I wish to mention especially my\nfriend and pupil, Mr. Walter E. Clark, of Harvard University,\nwhose careful reading of both text and translation was fruitful of\nmany good suggestions.\n\nBut by far my greatest personal indebtedness is to Professor\nLanman, whose generous interest in my work has never flagged\nfrom the day when I began the study of Sanskrit under his guidance.\nHe has criticized this translation with the utmost rigor; indeed,\nthe pages are few which have not witnessed some improvement\nfrom his hand. It is to him also that I owe the accuracy\nand beauty which characterize the printed book: nothing has been\nhard enough to weary him, nothing small enough to escape him.\nAnd more than all else, I am grateful to him for the opportunity\nof publishing in the Harvard Oriental Series; for this series is that\nenterprise which, since the death of Professor Whitney, most\nhonorably upholds in this country the standards of accurate scholarship\nset by the greatest of American Sanskritists.\n\nARTHUR W.

THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY\n\n\nConcerning the life, the date, and the very identity[2] of\nKing Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka, the reputed author of The Little Clay Cart,\nwe are curiously ignorant. No other work is ascribed to him, and\nwe have no direct information about him, beyond the somewhat\nfanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to be\nsure, many tales which cluster about the name of King Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka,\nbut none of them represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of\ninformation may prove, to some extent at least, a disguised blessing.\nFor our ignorance of external fact compels a closer study of\nthe text, if we would find out what manner of man it was who\nwrote the play. And the case of King Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka is by no means\nunique in India; in regard to every great Sanskrit writer,--so bare\nis Sanskrit literature of biography,--we are forced to concentrate\nattention on the man as he reveals himself in his works. First, however,\nit may be worth while to compare Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka with two other\ngreat dramatists of India, and thus to discover, if we may, in what\nways he excels them or is excelled by them.\n\nK\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa, Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka, Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti--assuredly, these are the greatest\nnames in the history of the Indian drama. So different are these\nmen, and so great, that it is not possible to assert for any one of\nthem such supremacy as Shakspere holds in the English drama.\nIt is true that K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa's dramatic masterpiece, the Shakuntal\u00c4\u0081,\nis the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that the\ntender and elegant K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate\nenthusiasm, the \"Shakspere of India.\" But this rather exclusive\nadmiration of the Shakuntal\u00c4\u0081 results from lack of information\nabout the other great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due\nto the accident that only the Shakuntal\u00c4\u0081 became known in translation\nat a time when romantic Europe was in full sympathy with\nthe literature of India.\n\nBhavabh\u00c5\u00abti, too, is far less widely known than K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa; and for this\nthe reason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti's style, his\nlack of humor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his\nbeing a truly popular poet. With reference to K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa, he holds a\nposition such as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will\nalways seem to minds that sympathize with his grandeur[3] the greatest\nof Indian poets; while by other equally discerning minds of another\norder he will be admired, but not passionately loved.\n\nYet however great the difference between K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa, \"the grace\nof poetry,\"[4] and Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti, \"the master of eloquence,\"[5] these two\nauthors are far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of\nthem with the author of The Little Clay Cart. K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa and Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti\nare Hindus of the Hindus; the Shakuntal\u00c4\u0081 and the Latter\nActs of R\u00c4\u0081ma could have been written nowhere save in India:\nbut Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka, alone in the long line of Indian dramatists, has a\ncosmopolitan character. Shakuntal\u00c4\u0081 is a Hindu maid, M\u00c4\u0081dhava is\na Hindu hero; but Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka and Maitreya and Madanik\u00c4\u0081 are\ncitizens of the world. In some of the more striking characteristics of\nSanskrit literature--in its fondness for system, its elaboration of\nstyle, its love of epigram--K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa and Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti are far truer\nto their native land than is Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka. In Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka we find few\nof those splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese[6] say, \"it is only\nthe words which stop, the sense goes on,\"--phrases like K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa's[7]\n\"there are doors of the inevitable everywhere,\" or Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti's[8] \"for\ncauseless love there is no remedy.\" As regards the predominance of\nswift-moving action over the poetical expression of great truths,\nThe Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of R\u00c4\u0081ma as\nMacbeth does to Hamlet. Again, Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka's style is simple and direct,\na rare quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages\nof higher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka\ncannot infuse into mere language the charm which we find in K\u00c4\u0081lid\u00c4\u0081sa\nor the majesty which we find in Bhavabh\u00c5\u00abti.\n\nYet Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka's limitations in regard to stylistic power are not\nwithout their compensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality\nand enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved the\ndeath of Sanskrit literature. Now just at this point, where other\nHindu writers are weak, Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka stands forth pre\u00c3\u00abminent. Nowhere\nelse in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such variety,\nand such drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart;\nand nowhere else, in the drama at least, is there such humor. Let\nus consider, a little more in detail, these three characteristics of\nour author; his variety, his skill in the drawing of character, his\nhumor.\n\nTo gain a rough idea of Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka's variety, we have only to recall\nthe names of the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who\nGambled and The Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The\nStorm; and The Swapping of the Bullock-carts is closely succeeded\nby The Strangling of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081. From farce to tragedy, from\nsatire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian.\nHere we have philosophy:\n\n    _The lack of money is the root of all evil._                 (_i. 14_)\n\nAnd pathos:\n\n    _My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;\n      My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;\n    Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;\n    For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,\n      And for the fragrant incense of my blood._                 (_x. 3_)\n\nAnd nature description:\n\n    _But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend,\n                  This golden cord that trembles on the breast\n                  Of great Air\u00c4\u0081vata; upon the crest\n                    Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;\n                  This lamp tn Indra's palace; but most blest\n                    As telling where your most belov\u00c3\u00a8d stays._   (_v. 33_)\n\nAnd genuine bitterness:\n\n    _Pride and tricks and lies and fraud\n      Are in your face;\n    False playground of the lustful god,\n      Such is your face;\n    The wench's stock in trade, in fine,\n    Epitome of joys divine,\n      I mean your face--\n    For sale! the price is courtesy.\n    I trust you'll find a man to buy\n      Your face._                                                (_v. 36_)\n\nIt is natural that Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka should choose for the expression of\nmatters so diverse that type of drama which gives the greatest\nscope to the author's creative power. This type is the so-called\n\"drama of invention,\"[9] a category curiously subordinated in India\nto the heroic drama, the plot of which is drawn from history or\nmythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama\nwhich fulfils the spirit of the drama of invention, as defined by the\nSanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of the \"M\u00c4\u0081lat\u00c4\u00ab and M\u00c4\u0081dhava,\"\nor of the \"Mallik\u00c4\u0081 and M\u00c4\u0081ruta,\" is in no true sense the invention\nof the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama\nof invention which is \"full of rascals.\"[10]\n\nBut a spirit so powerful as that of King Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka could not be\nconfined within the strait-jacket of the minute, and sometimes\npuerile, rules of the technical works. In the very title of the drama,\nhe has disregarded the rule[11] that the name of a drama of invention\nshould be formed by compounding the names of heroine and hero.[12]\nAgain, the books prescribe[13] that the hero shall appear in every act;\nyet Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And\nfurther, various characters, Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081, Maitreya, the courtier,\nand others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too\nclosely to the technical definitions.\n\nThe characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even\nwhen the type makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case\nof Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, the character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta[14]\nor even R\u00c4\u0081ma[15] can hardly be said to live. Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka's men are better\nindividualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates him\nsharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws on every class of\nsociety, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and the\nhousemaid.\n\nHis greatest character is unquestionably Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka, this\ncombination of ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater\nthan Cloten, who, after strangling an innocent woman, can say:[16]\n\"Oh, come! Let's go and play in the pond.\" Most attractive characters\nare the five[17] conspirators, men whose home is \"east of Suez\nand the ten commandments.\" They live from hand to mouth, ready\nat any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution,\nand preserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their\nirresistible conceit. And side by side with them moves the hero\nCh\u00c4\u0081rudatta, the Buddhist beau-ideal of manhood,\n\n    _A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow_,\n    _Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low_.                   (_i. 48_)\n\nTo him, life itself is not dear, but only honor.[18] He values wealth\nonly as it supplies him with the means of serving others. We may,\nwith some justice, compare him with Antonio in The Merchant\nof Venice. There is some inconsistency, from our point of view,\nin making such a character the hero of a love-drama; and indeed,\nit is Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 who does most of the love-making.[19]\n\nVasantasen\u00c4\u0081 is a character with neither the girlish charm of\nShakuntal\u00c4\u0081[20] nor the mature womanly dignity of S\u00c4\u00abt\u00c4\u0081.[21] She is\nmore admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her\nlove as true as steel; this too, in a social position which makes such\nconstancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a great character; she\ndoes not seem so true to life as her clever maid, Madanik\u00c4\u0081. In\nmaking the heroine of his play a courtezan, Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka follows a\nsuggestion of the technical works on the drama; he does not\nthereby cast any imputation of ill on Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's character. The\ncourtezan class in India corresponded roughly to the het\u00c3\u00a6r\u00c3\u00a6 of\nancient Greece or the geishas of Japan; it was possible to be a\ncourtezan and retain one's self-respect. Yet the inherited[22] way of\nlife proves distasteful to Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081; her one desire is to escape\nits limitations and its dangers by becoming a legal wife.[23]\n\nIn Maitreya, the Vid\u00c5\u00abshaka, we find an instance of our author's\nmasterly skill in giving life to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition.\nThe Vid\u00c5\u00abshaka is a stock character who has something in\ncommon with a jester; and in Maitreya the essential traits of the\ncharacter--eagerness for good food and other creature comforts,\nand blundering devotion to his friend--are retained, to be sure,\nbut clarified and elevated by his quaint humor and his readiness\nto follow Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta even in death. The grosser traits of the typical\nVid\u00c5\u00abshaka are lacking. Maitreya is neither a glutton nor a fool,\nbut a simple-minded, whole-hearted friend.\n\nThe courtier is another character suggested by the technical\nworks, and transformed by the genius of Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka. He is a man\nnot only of education and social refinement, but also of real nobility\nof nature. But he is in a false position from the first, this\ntrue gentleman at the wretched court of King P\u00c4\u0081laka; at last he\nfinds the courage to break away, and risks life, and all that makes\nlife attractive, by backing Aryaka. Of all the conspirators, it is he\nwho runs the greatest risk. To his protection of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 is\nadded a touch of infinite pathos when we remember that he was\nhimself in love with her.[24] Only when Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 leaves him[25] without\na thought, to enter Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house, does he realize how\nmuch he loves her; then, indeed, he breaks forth in words of the\nmost passionate jealousy. We need not linger over the other characters,\nexcept to observe that each has his marked individuality,\nand that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society that\nseems at first so remote.\n\nSh\u00c5\u00abdraka's humor is the third of his vitally distinguishing qualities.\nThis humor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its\nsituations. The plays on words can seldom be adequately reproduced in\ntranslation, but the situations are independent of language. And\nSh\u00c5\u00abdraka's humor runs the whole gamut, from grim to farcical, from\nsatirical to quaint. Its variety and keenness are such that King\nSh\u00c5\u00abdraka need not fear a comparison with the greatest of Occidental\nwriters of comedies.\n\nIt remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously,\nit is too long. More than this, the main action halts through acts ii.\nto v., and during these episodic acts we almost forget that the main\nplot concerns the love of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 and Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. Indeed, we have in\nThe Little Clay Cart the material for two plays. The larger part of act\ni. forms with acts vi. to x. a consistent and ingenious plot; while the\nremainder of act i. might be combined with acts iii. to v. to make a\npleasing comedy of lighter tone. The second act, clever as it is, has\nlittle real connection either with the main plot or with the story of\nthe gems. The breadth of treatment which is observable in this play is\nfound in many other specimens of the Sanskrit drama, which has set\nitself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The lack of\ndramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by lyrical\nbeauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we\nmight not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than\nas dramas. In The Little Clay Cart, at any rate, we could ill afford to\nspare a single scene, even though the very richness and variety of the\nplay remove it from the class of the world's greatest dramas.\n\n\nII. THE TRANSLATION\n\nThe following translation is sufficiently different from previous\ntranslations of Indian plays to require a word of explanation. The\ndifference consists chiefly in the manner in which I have endeavored to\npreserve the form of the original. The Indian plays are written in\nmingled prose and verse; and the verse portion forms so large a part of\nthe whole that the manner in which it is rendered is of much importance.\nNow this verse is not analogous to the iambic trimeter of Sophocles or\nthe blank verse of Shakspere, but roughly corresponds to the Greek\nchoruses or the occasional rhymed songs of the Elizabethan stage. In\nother words, the verse portion of a Sanskrit drama is not narrative; it\nis sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: each stanza sums up\nthe emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue has made\nupon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form of\nthe rhymed stanza; and so, although rhymed verse is very rarely employed\nin classical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate vehicle for the\ntranslation of the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we\noccasionally find stanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank\nverse, and, more frequently, stanzas which are so prosaic as not to\ndeserve a rendering in English verse at all.[26] But, as the present\ntranslation may be regarded as in some sort an experiment, I have\npreferred to hold rigidly to the distinction found in the original\nbetween simple prose and types of stanza which seem to me to correspond\nto English rhymed verse.\n\nIt is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into\nrhymed verse, cannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this\ndisadvantage I have used my best pains to minimize. I hope it\nmay be said that nothing of real moment has been omitted from\nthe verses; and where lack of metrical skill has compelled expansion,\nI have striven to make the additions as insignificant as\npossible.\n\nThere is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to\nimitate the original; this is the difference in the dialects used by the\nvarious characters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other Indian dramas,\nsome of the characters speak Sanskrit, others Pr\u00c4\u0081krit. Now Pr\u00c4\u0081krit is\nthe generic name for a number of dialects derived from the Sanskrit and\nclosely akin to it. The inferior personages of an Indian play, and, with\nrare exceptions, all the women, speak one or another of these Pr\u00c4\u0081krits.\nOf the thirty characters of this play, for example, only five\n(Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, the courtier, Aryaka, Sharvilaka, and the judge) speak\nSanskrit;[27] the others speak various Pr\u00c4\u0081krit dialects. Only in the\ncase of Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka have I made a rude attempt to suggest the dialect by\nsubstituting sh for s as he does. And the grandiloquence of Sharvilaka's\nSanskrit in the satirical portion of the third act I have endeavored to\nimitate.\n\nWhenever the language of the original is at all technical, the\ntranslator labors under peculiar difficulty. Thus the legal terms\nfound in the ninth act are inadequately rendered, and, to some extent\nat least, inevitably so; for the legal forms, or lack of forms,\npictured there were never contemplated by the makers of the English\nlegal vocabulary. It may be added here that in rendering from a\nliterature so artificial as the Sanskrit, one must lose not only the\nsensuous beauty of the verse, but also many plays on words.\n\nIn regard to the not infrequent repetitions found in the text, I\nhave used my best judgment. Such repetitions have been given in\nfull where it seemed to me that the force or unity of the passage\ngained by such treatment, or where the original repeats in full, as\nin the case of v. 7, which is identical with iii. 29. Elsewhere, I have\nmerely indicated the repetition after the manner of the original.\n\nThe reader will notice that there was little effort to attain realism\nin the presentation of an Indian play. He need not be surprised\ntherefore to find (page 145) that V\u00c4\u00abraka leaves the court-room,\nmounts a horse, rides to the suburbs, makes an investigation\nand returns--all within the limits of a stage-direction. The\nsimplicity of presentation also makes possible sudden shifts of\nscene. In the first act, for example, there are six scenes, which take\nplace alternately in Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house and in the street outside.\nIn those cases where a character enters \"seated\" or \"asleep,\" I have\nsubstituted the verb \"appear\" for the verb \"enter\"; yet I am not\nsure that this concession to realism is wise.\n\nThe system of transliteration which I have adopted is intended to render\nthe pronunciation of proper names as simple as may be to the English\nreader. The consonants are to be pronounced as in English,[28] the\nvowels as in Italian. Diacritical marks have been avoided, with the\nexception of the macron. This sign has been used consistently[29] to\nmark long vowels except _e_ and _o_, which are always long.\nThree rules suffice for the placing of the accent. A long penult is\naccented: Maitr\u00c3\u00a9ya, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. If the penult is short, the antepenult\nis accented provided it be long: Sanstha\u00cc\u0084\u00cc\u0081naka. If both penult and\nantepenult of a four-syllabled word are short, the pre-antepenultimate\nreceives the accent: M\u00c3\u00a1danik\u00c4\u0081, Stha\u00cc\u0084\u00cc\u0081varaka.\n\n\nIII. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT\n\nACT I., entitled _The Gems are left Behind_. Evening of the first\nday.--After the prologue, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, who is within his house, converses\nwith his friend Maitreya, and deplores his poverty. While they are\nspeaking, Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 appears in the street outside. She is pursued by\nthe courtier and Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka; the latter makes her degrading offers of\nhis love, which she indignantly rejects. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta sends Maitreya from\nthe house to offer sacrifice, and through the open door Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081\nslips unobserved into the house. Maitreya returns after an altercation\nwith Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka, and recognizes Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081. Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 leaves a\ncasket of gems in the house for safe keeping and returns to her home.\n\nACT II., entitled _The Shampooer who Gambled_. Second day.--The\nact opens in Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house. Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 confesses to her\nmaid Madanik\u00c4\u0081 her love for Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. Then a shampooer appears\nin the street, pursued by the gambling-master and a gambler, who\ndemand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gambling-house.\nAt this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-master\nand the gambler in an angry discussion, during which the\nshampooer escapes into Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house. When Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081\nlearns that the shampooer had once served Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, she pays his\ndebt; the grateful shampooer resolves to turn monk. As he leaves\nthe house he is attacked by a runaway elephant, and saved by\nKarnap\u00c5\u00abraka, a servant of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081.\n\nACT III., entitled _The Hole in the Wall_. The night following the\nsecond day.--Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta and Maitreya return home after midnight\nfrom a concert, and go to sleep. Maitreya has in his hand the\ngem-casket which Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 has left behind. Sharvilaka enters.\nHe is in love with Madanik\u00c4\u0081, a maid of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's, and is\nresolved to acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He\nmakes a hole in the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket\nof gems which Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 had left. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta wakes to find\ncasket and thief gone. His wife gives him her pearl necklace with\nwhich to make restitution.\n\nACT IV., entitled _Madanik\u00c4\u0081 and Sharvilaka_. Third day.--Sharvilaka\ncomes to Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house to buy Madanik\u00c4\u0081's freedom.\nVasantasen\u00c4\u0081 overhears the facts concerning the theft of her gem-casket\nfrom Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house, but accepts the casket, and gives\nMadanik\u00c4\u0081 her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he hears\nthat his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has\nescaped and is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him.\nMaitreya comes from Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay\nVasantasen\u00c4\u0081 for the gem-casket. She accepts the necklace also, as\ngiving her an excuse for a visit to Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\nACT V., entitled _The Storm_. Evening of the third day.--Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta\nappears in the garden of his house. Here he receives a servant\nof Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081, who announces that Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 is on her\nway to visit him. Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 then appears in the street with the\ncourtier; the two describe alternately the violence and beauty of the\nstorm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 dismisses the courtier,\nenters the garden, and explains to Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta how she has\nagain come into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm\nhas so increased in violence that she is compelled to spend the night\nat Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house.\n\nACT VI., entitled _The Swapping of the Bullock-carts_. Morning of\nthe fourth day.--Here she meets Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's little son, Rohasena.\nThe boy is peevish because he can now have only a little clay cart\nto play with, instead of finer toys. Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 gives him her\ngems to buy a toy cart of gold. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's servant drives up to\ntake Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 in Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's bullock-cart to the park, where\nshe is to meet Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta; but while Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 is making ready,\nhe drives away to get a cushion. Then Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka's servant drives\nup with his master's cart, which Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 enters by mistake.\nSoon after, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's servant returns with his cart. Then the\nescaped prisoner Aryaka appears and enters Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's cart.\nTwo policemen come on the scene; they are searching for Aryaka.\nOne of them looks into the cart and discovers Aryaka, but agrees\nto protect him. This he does by deceiving and finally maltreating\nhis companion.\n\nACT VII., entitled _Aryaka's Escape_. Fourth day.--Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta\nis awaiting Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 in the park. His cart, in which Aryaka lies\nhidden, appears. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta discovers the fugitive, removes his\nfetters, lends him the cart, and leaves the park.\n\nACT VIII., entitled _The Strangling of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081_. Fourth\nday.--A Buddhist monk, the shampooer of the second act, enters\nthe park. He has difficulty in escaping from Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka, who\nappears with the courtier. Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka's servant drives in with the\ncart which Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 had entered by mistake. She is discovered\nby Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love.\nWhen she repulses him, Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka gets rid of all witnesses,\nstrangles her, and leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters\nagain, revives Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081, and conducts her to a monastery.\n\nACT IX., entitled _The Trial_. Fifth day.--Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka accuses\nCh\u00c4\u0081rudatta of murdering Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 for her money. In the course\nof the trial, it appears that Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 had spent the night of the\nstorm at Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house; that she had left the house the next\nmorning to meet Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta in the park; that there had been a\nstruggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a\nwoman. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which\nVasantasen\u00c4\u0081 had left to buy Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's son a toy cart of gold.\nThese gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and\nSansth\u00c4\u0081naka. In view of Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's poverty, this seems to establish\nthe motive for the crime, and Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta is condemned to\ndeath.\n\nACT X., entitled _The End_. Sixth day.--Two headsmen are conducting\nCh\u00c4\u0081rudatta to the place of execution. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta takes\nhis last leave of his son and his friend Maitreya. But Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka's\nservant escapes from confinement and betrays the truth; yet he is\nnot believed, owing to the cunning displayed by his master. The\nheadsmen are preparing to execute Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, when Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081\nherself appears upon the scene, accompanied by the Buddhist\nmonk. Her appearance puts a summary end to the proceedings.\nThen news is brought that Aryaka has killed and supplanted the\nformer king, that he wishes to reward Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, and that he has\nby royal edict freed Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 from the necessity of living as a\ncourtezan. Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka is brought before Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta for sentence,\nbut is pardoned by the man whom he had so grievously injured.\nThe play ends with the usual Epilogue.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 2: For an illuminating discussion of these matters, the reader\nis referred to Sylvain L\u00c3\u00a9vi's admirable work, Le Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Indien, Paris,\n1890, pages 196-211.]\n\n[Footnote 3: In his M\u00c4\u0081lat\u00c4\u00abm\u00c4\u0081dhava, i. 8, he says: \"Whoever they may be\nwho now proclaim their contempt for me,--they know something, but this\nwork was not for them.

Let me then most reverently salute\nthe honorable gentlemen, and announce our intention to produce\na drama called \"The Little Clay Cart.\" Its author was a man\n\n    Who vied with elephants in lordly grace;\n      Whose eyes were those of the chakora bird\n    That feeds on moonbeams; glorious his face\n      As the full moon; his person, all have heard,\n    Was altogether lovely. First in worth\n      Among the twice-born was this poet, known\n    As Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka far over all the earth,\n      His virtue's depth unfathomed and alone.                   3\n\n[1.14. S.\n\nAnd again:\n\n    The S\u00c4\u0081maveda, the Rigveda too,\n    The science mathematical, he knew;\n    The arts wherein fair courtezans excel,\n    And all the lore of elephants as well.\n    Through Shiva's grace, his eye was never dim;\n    He saw his son a king in place of him.\n    The difficult horse-sacrifice he tried\n    Successfully; entered the fiery tide,\n    One hundred years and ten days old, and died.                4\n\nAnd yet again:\n\n    Eager for battle; sloth's determined foe;\n      Of scholars chief, who to the Veda cling;\n    Rich in the riches that ascetics know;\n    Glad, gainst the foeman's elephant to show\n      His valor;--such was Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka, the king.                   5\n\nAnd in this work of his,\n\n    Within the town, Avanti named,\n    Dwells one called Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, famed\n    No less for youth than poverty;\n    A merchant's son and Brahman, he.\n\n    His virtues have the power to move\n    Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's inmost love;\n    Fair as the springtime's radiancy,\n    And yet a courtezan is she.                                  6\n\n    So here king Sh\u00c5\u00abdraka the tale imparts\n    Of love's pure festival in these two hearts,\n    Of prudent acts, a lawsuit's wrong and hate,\n    A rascal's nature, and the course of fate.                   7\n\n[_He walks about and looks around him._] Why, this music-room of\nours is empty. I wonder where the actors have gone. [_Reflecting._]\nAh, I understand.\n\nP. 4.7]\n\n    Empty his house, to whom no child was born;\n      Thrice empty his, who lacks true friends and sure;\n    To fools, the world is empty and forlorn;\n      But all that is, is empty to the poor.                     8\n\nI have finished the concert. And I've been practising so long that\nthe pupils of my eyes are dancing, and I'm so hungry that my eyes\nare crackling like a lotus-seed, dried up by the fiercest rays of the\nsummer sun. I'll just call my wife and ask whether there is anything\nfor breakfast or not.\n\nHello! here I am--but no! Both the particular occasion and the\ngeneral custom demand that I speak Pr\u00c4\u0081krit. [_Speaking in Pr\u00c4\u0081krit._]\nConfound it! I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry that\nmy limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Suppose I go home\nand see whether my good wife has got anything ready or not. [_He\nwalks about and looks around him._] Here I am at home. I'll just go\nin. [_He enters and looks about._] Merciful heavens! Why in the world\nis everything in our house turned upside down? A long stream of\nrice-water is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black\nwhere the iron kettle has been rubbed clean, is as lovely as a girl\nwith the beauty-marks of black cosmetic on her face. It smells so\ngood that my hunger seems to blaze up and hurts me more than\never. Has some hidden treasure come to light? or am I hungry\nenough to think the whole world is made of rice? There surely isn't\nany breakfast in our house, and I'm starved to death. But everything\nseems topsyturvy here. One girl is preparing cosmetics, another\nis weaving garlands of flowers. [_Reflecting._] What does it all\nmean? Well, I'll call my good wife and learn the truth. [_He looks\ntoward the dressing-room._] Mistress, will you come here a moment?\n\n[_Enter an actress._]\n\n_Actress._ Here I am, sir.\n\n_Director._ You are very welcome, mistress.\n\n_Actress._ Command me, sir.

Is there anything\nto eat in the house or not?\n\n_Actress._ There's everything, sir.\n\n_Director._ Well, what?\n\n_Actress._ For instance--there's rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled\nmilk, rice; and, all together, it makes you a dish fit for\nheaven. May the gods always be thus gracious to you!\n\n_Director._ All that in our house? or are you joking?\n\n_Actress._ [_Aside._] Yes, I will have my joke. [_Aloud._] It's in the\nmarket-place, sir.\n\n_Director._ [_Angrily._] You wretched woman, thus shall your own\nhope be cut off! And death shall find you out! For my expectations,\nlike a scaffolding, have been raised so high, only to fall again.\n\n_Actress._ Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a joke.\n\n_Director._ But what do these unusual preparations mean? One girl\nis preparing cosmetics, another is weaving garlands, and the very\nground is adorned with sacrificial flowers of five different colors.\n\n_Actress._ This is a fast day, sir.\n\n_Director._ What fast?\n\n_Actress._ The fast for a handsome husband.\n\n_Director._ In this world, mistress, or the next?\n\n_Actress._ In the next world, sir.\n\n_Director._ [_Wrathfully._] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing\nmy food to get herself a husband in the next world.\n\n_Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that you\nmay be my husband in my next birth, too.\n\n_Director._ But who suggested this fast to you?\n\n_Actress._ Your own dear friend J\u00c5\u00abrnavriddha.\n\n_Director._ [_Angrily._] Ah, J\u00c5\u00abrnavriddha, son of a slave-wench!\nWhen, oh, when shall I see King P\u00c4\u0081laka angry with you? Then\nyou will be parted, as surely as the scented hair of some young\nbride.\n\nP. 8.10]\n\n_Actress._ Don't be angry, sir. It is only that I may have you in the\nnext world that I celebrate this fast. [_She falls at his feet._]\n\n_Director._ Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this\nfast.\n\n_Actress._ Some Brahman of our own sort whom we must invite.\n\n_Director._ You may go then. And I will invite some Brahman of\nour own sort.\n\n_Actress._ Very well, sir.                              [_Exit._\n\n_Director._ [_Walking about._] Good heavens! In this rich city of\nUjjayin\u00c4\u00ab how am I to find a Brahman of our own sort? [_He looks\nabout him._] Ah, here comes Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's friend Maitreya. Good!\nI'll ask him. Maitreya, you must be the first to break bread in\nour house to-day.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes._ You must invite some other Brahman.\nI am busy.\n\n_Director._ But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself.\nBesides, you shall have a present.\n\n_The voice._ I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me?\n\n_Director._ He says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman.\n\n                                                         [_Exit._\n\nEND OF THE PROLOGUE\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FIRST\n\nTHE GEMS ARE LEFT BEHIND\n\n\n[_Enter, with a cloak in his hand, Maitreya._]\n\n_Maitreya._\n\n\"You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy.\" And yet I really ought\nto be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of\naffairs! When good Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill\nof the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with\nthe greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I\nwas surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his\npaint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them\naside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And\nnow he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and\ncome home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this\njasmine-scented cloak, which Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's good friend J\u00c5\u00abrnavriddha has\nsent him. He bade me give it to Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, as soon as he had finished\nhis devotions. So now I will look for Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. [_He walks about and\nlooks around him._] Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta has finished his devotions, and here he\ncomes with an offering for the divinities of the house.\n\n[_Enter Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta as described, and Radanik\u00c4\u0081._]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Looking up and sighing wearily._]\n\n    Upon my threshold, where the offering\n      Was straightway seized by swans and flocking cranes,\n    The grass grows now, and these poor seeds I fling\n      Fall where the mouth of worms their sweetness stains.      9\n\n[_He walks about very slowly and seats himself._]\n\n_Maitreya_. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta is here. I must go and speak to him.\n[_Approaching._] My greetings to you. May happiness be yours.\n\nP. 13.1]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very\nwelcome, my friend. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya._ Thank you. [_He seats himself._] Well, comrade, here is a\njasmine-scented cloak which your good friend J\u00c5\u00abrnavriddha has\nsent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions.\n[_He presents the cloak. Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta takes it and remains\nsunk in thought._] Well, what are you thinking about?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ My good friend,\n\n    A candle shining through the deepest dark\n      Is happiness that follows sorrow's strife;\n    But after bliss when man bears sorrow's mark,\n      His body lives a very death-in-life.                       10\n\n_Maitreya._ Well, which would you rather, be dead or be poor?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Ah, my friend,\n\n    Far better death than sorrows sure and slow;\n    Some passing suffering from death may flow,\n    But poverty brings never-ending woe.                         11\n\n_Maitreya._ My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has\nbeen conveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has\nyielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an added\ncharm.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Comrade, I do not grieve for my ruined fortunes. But\n\n    This is my sorrow. They whom I\n    Would greet as guests, now pass me by.\n    \"This is a poor man's house,\" they cry.\n\n    As flitting bees, the season o'er,\n    Desert the elephant, whose store\n    Of ichor[30] spent, attracts no more.                        12\n\n_Maitreya._ Oh, confound the money! It is a trifle not worth thinking\nabout. It is like a cattle-boy in the woods afraid of wasps; it\ndoesn't stay anywhere where it is used for food.\n\n[8.5. S.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rud._ Believe me, friend. My sorrow does not spring\n\n      From simple loss of gold;\n    For fortune is a fickle, changing thing,\n      Whose favors do not hold;\n    But he whose sometime wealth has taken wing,\n      Finds bosom-friends grow cold.                             13\n\nThen too:\n\n    A poor man is a man ashamed; from shame\n    Springs want of dignity and worthy fame;\n    Such want gives rise to insults hard to bear;\n    Thence comes despondency; and thence, despair;\n    Despair breeds folly; death is folly's fruit--\n    Ah! the lack of money is all evils root!                     14\n\n_Maitreya._ But just remember what a trifle money is, after all, and\nbe more cheerful.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ My friend, the poverty of a man is to him\n\n    A home of cares, a shame that haunts the mind,\n    Another form of warfare with mankind;\n    The abhorrence of his friends, a source of hate\n    From strangers, and from each once-loving mate;\n    But if his wife despise him, then 't were meet\n    In some lone wood to seek a safe retreat.\n    The flame of sorrow, torturing his soul,\n    Burns fiercely, yet contrives to leave him whole.            15\n\nComrade, I have made my offering to the divinities of the house.\nDo you too go and offer sacrifice to the Divine Mothers at a place\nwhere four roads meet.\n\n_Maitreya._ No!\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Why not?\n\n_Maitreya._ Because the gods are not gracious to you even when\nthus honored. So what is the use of worshiping?\n\nP. 16.8]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Not so, my friend, not so! This is the constant duty\nof a householder.\n\n    The gods feel ever glad content\n    In the gifts, and the self-chastisement,\n    The meditations, and the prayers,\n    Of those who banish worldly cares.                           16\n\nWhy then do you hesitate? Go and offer sacrifice to the Mothers.\n\n_Maitreya._ No, I'm not going. You must send somebody else. Anyway,\neverything seems to go wrong with me, poor Brahman that\nI am! It's like a reflection in a mirror; the right side becomes the\nleft, and the left becomes the right. Besides, at this hour of the\nevening, people are abroad upon the king's highway--courtezans,\ncourtiers, servants, and royal favorites. They will take me now for\nfair prey, just as the black-snake out frog-hunting snaps up the\nmouse in his path. But what will you do sitting here?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Good then, remain; and I will finish my devotions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Voices behind the scenes._ Stop, Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081, stop!\n\n[_Enter Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081, pursued by the courtier, by Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka, and the\nservant._]\n\n_Courtier._ Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081!

The\nothers beat him with all their might._]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ There [_drawing the gamblers ring_] you're bound by\nthe gamblers' ring.\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Rises. Despairingly._] What! bound by the gamblers'\nring? Confound it! That is a limit which we gamblers can't pass.\nWhere can I get the money to pay him?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Well then, you must give surety.\n\n_Shampooer._ I have an idea. [_He nudges the gambler._] I'll give you\nhalf, if you'll forgive me the other half.\n\n_Gambler._ All right.\n\n_Shampooer._ [_To M\u00c4\u0081thura._] I'll give you surety for a half. You\nmight forgive me the other half.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ All right. Where's the harm?\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Aloud._] You forgave me a half, sir?\n\n[31.24. S.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Yes.\n\n_Shampooer._ [_To the gambler._] And you forgave me a half?\n\n_Gambler._ Yes.\n\n_Shampooer._ Then I think I'll be going.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Pay me my ten gold-pieces! Where are you going?\n\n_Shampooer._ Look at this, gentlemen, look at this! Here I just gave\nsurety to one of them for a half, and the other forgave me a half.\nAnd even after that he is dunning me, poor helpless me!\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ [_Seizing him._] My name is M\u00c4\u0081thura, the clever swindler,\nand you're not going to swindle me this time. Pay up, jail-bird,\nevery bit of my money, and this minute, too.\n\n_Shampooer._ How can I pay?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Sell your father and pay.\n\n_Shampooer._ Where can I get a father?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Sell your mother and pay.\n\n_Shampooer._ Where can I get a mother?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Sell yourself and pay.\n\n_Shampooer._ Have mercy! Lead me to the king's highway.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Go ahead.\n\n_Shampooer._ If it must be. [_He walks about._] Gentlemen, will you\nbuy me for ten gold-pieces from this gambling-master? [_He sees\na passer-by and calls out._] What is that? You wish to know what\nI can do? I will be your house-servant. What! he has gone without\neven answering. Well, here's another. I'll speak to him. [_He repeats\nhis offer._] What! this one too takes no notice of me. He is\ngone. Confound it! I've had hard luck ever since Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta lost\nhis fortune.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Will you pay?\n\n_Shampooer._ How can I pay? [_He falls down. M\u00c4\u0081thura drags him\nabout._] Good gentlemen, save me, save me! [_Enter Darduraka._]\n\nP. 61.5]\n\n_Darduraka._ Yes, gambling is a kingdom without a throne.\n\n    You do not mind defeat at all;\n    Great are the sums you spend and win;\n    While kingly revenues roll in,\n    Rich men, like slaves, before you fall.                      7\n\nAnd again:\n\n    You earn your coin by gambling,\n    Your friends and wife by gambling,\n    Your gifts and food by gambling;\n    Your last cent goes by gambling.                             8\n\nAnd again:\n\n    My cash was taken by the trey;\n    The deuce then took my health away;\n    The ace then set me on the street;\n    The four completed my defeat.                                9\n\n[_He looks before him._] Here comes M\u00c4\u0081thura, our sometime\ngambling-master. Well, as I can't escape, I think I'll put on my veil.\n[_He makes any number of gestures with his cloak, then examines it._]\n\n    This cloth is sadly indigent in thread;\n    This lovely cloth lets in a lot of light;\n    This cloth's protective power is nearly fled;\n    This cloth is pretty when it's rolled up tight.              10\n\nYet after all, what more could a poor saint do? For you see,\n\n    One foot I've planted in the sky,\n    The other on the ground must lie.[41]\n    The elevation's rather high,\n    But the sun stands it. Why can't I?                          11\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Pay, pay!\n\n_Shampooer._ How can I pay? [_M\u00c4\u0081thura drags him about._]\n\n_Darduraka._ Well, well, what is this I see? [_He addresses a bystander._]\nWhat did you say, sir? \"This shampooer is being maltreated\nby the gambling-master, and no one will save him\"? I'll\nsave him myself. [_He presses forward._] Stand back, stand back!\n\n[33.25. S.\n\n[_He takes a look._] Well, if this isn't that swindler M\u00c4\u0081thura. And\nhere is the poor saintly shampooer; a saint to be sure,\n\n    Who does not hang with bended head\n      Rigid till set of sun,\n    Who does not rub his back with sand\n      Till boils begin to run,\n    Whose shins dogs may not browse upon,\n      As they pass him in their rambling.[42]\n    Why should this tall and dainty man\n      Be so in love with gambling?                               12\n\nWell, I must pacify M\u00c4\u0081thura. [_He approaches._] How do you do,\nM\u00c4\u0081thura? [_M\u00c4\u0081thura returns the greeting._]\n\n_Darduraka._ What does this mean?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ He owes me ten gold-pieces.\n\n_Darduraka._ A mere bagatelle!\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ [_Pulling the rolled-up cloak from under Darduraka's\narm._] Look, gentlemen, look! The man in the ragged cloak calls\nten gold-pieces a mere bagatelle.\n\n_Darduraka._ My good fool, don't I risk ten gold-pieces on a cast\nof the dice? Suppose a man has money--is that any reason why\nhe should put it in his bosom and show it? But you,\n\n    You'll lose your caste, you'll lose your soul,\n    For ten gold-pieces that he stole,\n    To kill a man that's sound and whole,\n      With five good senses in him.                              13\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Ten gold-pieces may be a mere bagatelle to you, sir. To\nme they are a fortune.\n\n_Darduraka._ Well then, listen to me. Just give him ten more, and\nlet him go to gambling again.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ And what then?\n\n_Darduraka._ If he wins, he will pay you.\n\nP. 63.12]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ And if he doesn't win?\n\n_Darduraka._ Then he won't pay you.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ This is no time for nonsense. If you say that, you can\ngive him the money yourself. My name is M\u00c4\u0081thura. I'm a swindler\nand I play a crooked game, and I'm not afraid of anybody. You\nare an immoral scoundrel.\n\n_Darduraka._ Who did you say was immoral?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ You're immoral.\n\n_Darduraka._ Your father is immoral. [_He gives the shampooer a\nsign to escape._]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ You cur! That is just the way that you gamble.\n\n_Darduraka._ That is the way I gamble?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Come, shampooer, pay me my ten gold-pieces.\n\n_Shampooer._ I'll pay you this very day. I'll pay at once. [_M\u00c4\u0081thura\ndrags him about._]\n\n_Darduraka._ Fool! You may maltreat him when I am away, but\nnot before my eyes.\n\n[_M\u00c4\u0081thura seizes the shampooer and hits him on the nose. The shampooer\nbleeds, faints, and falls flat. Darduraka approaches and interferes.\nM\u00c4\u0081thura strikes Darduraka, and Darduraka strikes back._]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Oh, oh, you accurs\u00c3\u00a8d hound! But I'll pay you for this.\n\n_Darduraka._ My good fool, I was walking peaceably along the\nstreet, and you struck me. If you strike me to-morrow in court,\nthen you will open your eyes.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Yes, I'll open my eyes.\n\n_Darduraka._ How will you open your eyes?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ [_Opening his eyes wide._] This is the way I'll open my\neyes.\n\n[_Darduraka throws dust in M\u00c4\u0081thura's eyes, and gives the shampooer\na sign to escape. M\u00c4\u0081thura shuts his eyes and falls down. The shampooer\nescapes._]\n\n[35.20. S.\n\n_Darduraka._ [_Aside._] I have made an enemy of the influential\ngambling-master M\u00c4\u0081thura. I had better not stay here. Besides, my\ngood friend Sharvilaka told me that a young herdsman named\nAryaka has been designated by a soothsayer as our future king.\nNow everybody in my condition is running after him. I think I\nwill join myself to him.                               [_Exit._\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Trembles as he walks away and looks about him._] Here\nis a house where somebody has left the side-door open. I will go\nin. [_He enters and perceives Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._] Madam, I throw myself\nupon your protection.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ He who throws himself upon my protection shall be\nsafe. Close the door, girl. [_The maid does so._]\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ What do you fear?\n\n_Shampooer._ A creditor, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ You may open the door now, girl.\n\n_Shampooer._ [_To himself._] Ah! Her reasons for not fearing a creditor\nare in proportion to her innocence. The proverb is right:\n\n    The man who knows his strength and bears a load\n    Proportioned to that strength, not more nor less,\n    Is safe from stumbling and from sore distress,\n    Although he wander on a dreary road.                         14\n\nThat means me.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ [_Wiping his eyes. To the gambler._] Pay, pay!\n\n_Gambler._ While we were quarreling with Darduraka, sir, the\nman escaped.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ I broke that shampooer's nose for him with my fist\nCome on! Let's trace him by the blood. [_They do so._]\n\n_Gambler._ He went into Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house, sir.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ Then that is the end of the gold-pieces.\n\n_Gambler._ Let's go to court and lodge a complaint.\n\nP. 67.1]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ The swindler would leave the house and escape. No, we\nmust besiege him and so capture him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 gives Madanik\u00c4\u0081 a sign._]\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son\nare you, sir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?\n\n_Shampooer._ Listen, madam. My birthplace is P\u00c4\u0081taliputra, madam.\nI am the son of a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ It is a very dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.\n\n_Shampooer._ Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a\nmere trade.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.\n\n_Shampooer._ Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers\ntell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And\nwhen I had come here to Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab, I became the servant of a noble\ngentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money\naway, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long\nstory short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the\npossession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his\nprotection.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Who may it be that adorns Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab with the virtues\nwhich he has stolen from the object of my mistress' desires?\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ But to continue, sir--\n\n_Shampooer._ Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that\nnow--\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ His riches have vanished?\n\n_Shampooer._ I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom\nkeep company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there\nis so much the more water.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ But sir, what is his name?\n\n[37.23. S.\n\n_Shampooer._ Madam, who does not know the name of this moon\nof the whole world? He lives in the merchants' quarter. He whose\nname is worthy of all honor is named Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Joyfully rising from her seat._] Sir, this house is your\nown. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is\nweary. [_Madanik\u00c4\u0081 does as she is bid._]\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Aside._] What! so much honor because I mentioned\nCh\u00c4\u0081rudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta! You are the\nonly man in the world who really lives. All others merely breathe.\n[_He falls at Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's feet._] Enough, madam, enough. Pray\nbe seated, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Seating herself._] Where is he who is so richly your\ncreditor, sir?\n\n_Shamp._\n\n    The good man's wealth consists in kindly deeds;\n    All other wealth is vain and quickly flies.\n    The man who honors not his neighbor's needs,\n    Does that man know what honor signifies?                     15\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ But to continue--\n\n_Shampooer._ So I became a servant in his employ. And when his\nwealth was reduced to his virtue, I began to live by gambling. But\nfate was cruel, and I lost ten gold-pieces.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ I am ruined! I am robbed!\n\n_Shampooer._ There are the gambling-master and the gambler, looking\nfor me. You have heard my story, madam. The rest is your\naffair.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Madanik\u00c4\u0081, the birds fly everywhither when the tree\nis shaken in which they have their nests. Go, girl, and give the\ngambling-master and the gambler this bracelet. And tell them that\nthis gentleman sends it. [_She removes a bracelet from her arm, and\ngives it to Madanik\u00c4\u0081._]\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ [_Receiving the bracelet._] Yes, mistress. [_She goes out._]\n\nP. 71.2]\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ I am ruined! I am robbed!\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Inasmuch as these two are looking up to heaven, and\nsighing, and chattering, and fastening their eyes on the door, I\nconclude that they must be the gambling-master and the gambler.\n[_Approaching._] I salute you, sir.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ May happiness be yours.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Sir, which of you is the gambling-master?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081th._\n\n    O maiden, fair but something less than shy,\n    With red lip wounded in love's ardent play,\n    On whom is bent that sweet, coquettish eye?\n    For whom that lisp that steals the heart away?               16\n\n_I_ haven't got any money. You'll have to look somewhere else.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ You are certainly no gambler, if you talk that way.\nIs there any one who _owes_ you money?\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ There is. He owes ten gold-pieces. What of him?\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ In his behalf my mistress sends you this bracelet. No,\nno! He sends it himself.\n\n_M\u00c4\u0081thura._ [_Seizing it joyfully._] Well, well, you may tell the noble\nyouth that his account is squared. Let him come and seek delight\nagain in gambling.                   [_Exeunt M\u00c4\u0081thura and the gambler._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ [_Returning to Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._] Mistress, the gambling-master\nand the gambler have gone away well-pleased.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Go, sir, and comfort your kinsfolk.\n\n_Shampooer._ Ah, madam, if it may be, these hands would gladly\npractise their art in your service.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ But sir, he for whose sake you mastered the art,\nwho first received your service, he should have your service still.\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Aside._] A very pretty way to decline my services. How\nshall I repay her kindness? [_Aloud._] Madam, thus dishonored as a\ngambler, I shall become a Buddhist monk. And so, madam, treasure these\nwords in your memory: \"He was a shampooer, a gambler, a Buddhist monk.\"\n\n[40.1. S.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Sir, you must not act too precipitately.\n\n_Shampooer._ Madam, my mind is made up. [_He walks about._]\n\n    I gambled, and in gambling I did fall,\n      Till every one beheld me with dismay.\n    Now I shall show my honest face to all,\n      And walk abroad upon the king's highway.                   17\n\n[_Tumultuous cries behind the scenes._]\n\n_Shampooer._ [_Listening._] What is this? What is this? [_Addressing\nsome one behind the scenes._] What did you say? \"Post-breaker,\nVasantasen\u00c4\u0081's rogue elephant, is at liberty!\" Hurrah! I must go\nand see the lady's best elephant. No, no! What have I to do with\nthese things? I must hold to my resolution.                 [_Exit._\n\n[_Then enter hastily Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka, highly delighted, wearing a gorgeous\nmantle._]\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Where is she? Where is my mistress?\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Insolent! What can it be that so excites you? You do\nnot see your mistress before your very eyes.\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ [_Perceiving Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._] Mistress, my service to\nyou.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka, your face is beaming. What is it?\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ [_Proudly._] Oh, mistress! You missed it! You didn't\nsee Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka's heroism to-day!\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ What, Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka, what?\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Listen. Post-breaker, my mistress' rogue elephant,\nbroke the stake he was tied to, killed his keeper, and ran into the\nstreet, making a terrible commotion. You should have heard the\npeople shriek,\n\n    Take care of the babies, as quick as you can.\n      And climb up a roof or a tree!\n    The elephant rogue wants the blood of a man.\n      Escape! Run away! Can't you see?                           18\n\nP. 74.14]\n\nAnd:\n\n    How they lose their ankle-rings!\n    Girdles, set with gems and things,\n    Break away from fastenings!\n\n    As they stumble, trip, and blunder,\n    See the bracelets snap asunder,\n    Each a tangled, pearly wonder!                               19\n\nAnd that rogue of an elephant dives with his trunk and his feet\nand his tusks into the city of Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab, as if it were a lotus-pond\nin full flower. At last he comes upon a Buddhist monk.[43] And\nwhile the man's staff and his water-jar and his begging-bowl fly\nevery which way, he drizzles water over him and gets him between\nhis tusks. The people see him and begin to shriek again,\ncrying \"Oh, oh, the monk is killed!\"\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Anxiously._] Oh, what carelessness, what carelessness!\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Don't be frightened. Just listen, mistress. Then,\nwith a big piece of the broken chain dangling about him, he picked\nhim up, picked up the monk between his tusks, and just then\nKarnap\u00c5\u00abraka saw him, _I_ saw him, no, no! the slave who grows\nfat on my mistress' rice-cakes saw him, stumbled with his left\nfoot over a gambler's score, grabbed up an iron pole out of a shop,\nand challenged the mad elephant--\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Go on! Go on!\n\n_Karnap._\n\n    I hit him--in a fit of passion, too--\n      He really looked like some great mountain peak.\n    And from between those tusks of his I drew\n      The sacred hermit meek.                                    20\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Splendid, splendid! But go on!\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Then, mistress, all Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab tipped over to one side,\nlike a ship loaded unevenly, and you could hear nothing but \"Hurrah,\nhurrah for Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka!\" Then, mistress, a man touched the\nplaces where he ought to have ornaments, and, finding that he\nhadn't any, looked up, heaved a long sigh, and threw this mantle\nover me.\n\n[41.19. S.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Find out, Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka, whether the mantle is perfumed\nwith jasmine or not.\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Mistress, the elephant perfume is so strong that I\ncan't tell for sure.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Then look at the name.\n\n_Karnap\u00c5\u00abraka._ Here is the name. You may read it, mistress. [_He\nhands her the mantle._]\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Reads._] Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.

S\n\n_Maitreya._ There are just two things that always make me laugh.\nOne is a woman talking Sanskrit, and the other is a man who tries\nto sing soft and low. Now when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like\na heifer with a new rope through her nose; all you hear is \"soo,\nsoo, soo.\" And when a man tries to sing soft and low, he reminds\nme of an old priest muttering texts, while the flowers in his chaplet\ndry up. No, I don't like it!\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully\nthis evening. And still you are not satisfied.\n\n    The notes of love, peace, sweetness, could I trace,\n      The note that thrills, the note of passion too,\n    The note of woman's loveliness and grace--\n      Ah, my poor words add nothing, nothing new!\n    But as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,\n    I thought it was my hidden love who sang.                    4\n\n    The melody of song, the stricken strings\n    In undertone that half-unconscious clings,\n    More clearly sounding when the passions rise,\n    But ever sweeter as the music dies.\n    Words that strong passion fain would say again,\n    Yet checks their second utterance--in vain;\n    For music sweet as this lives on, until\n    I walk as hearing sweetest music still.                      5\n\n_Maitreya._ But see, my friend! The very dogs are sound asleep in\nthe shops that look out on the market. Let us go home. [_He looks\nbefore him._] Look, look! The bless\u00c3\u00a8d moon seems to give place to\ndarkness, as she descends from her palace in heaven.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ True.\n\n    The moon gives place to darkness as she dips\n    Behind the western mountain; and the tips\n    Of her uplifted horns alone appear,\n    Like two sharp-pointed tusks uplifted clear,\n    Where bathes an elephant in waters cool,\n    Who shows naught else above the jungle pool.                 6\n\nP. 89.1]\n\n_Maitreya._ Well, here is our house.

Do you bring the water. [_Maitreya\ndoes so. Vardham\u00c4\u0081naka washes Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's feet, then moves away._]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Let water be brought for the Brahman's feet.\n\n_Maitreya._ What good does water do my feet? I shall have to roll\nin the dirt again, like a beaten ass.\n\n_Vardham\u00c4\u0081naka._ Maitreya, you are a Brahman.\n\n_Maitreya._ Yes, like a slow-worm among all the other snakes, so\nam I a Brahman among all the other Brahmans.\n\n_Vardham\u00c4\u0081naka._ Maitreya, I will wash your feet after all.

S.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rud._\n\n    Such lax attention we can ill afford.\n      If we are trusted by a courtezan,\n      Then, Brahman, prove yourself an honest man,\n    And guard it safely, till it be restored.                    7\n\n[_He nods, repeating the stanza_ \"The melody of song, the stricken\nstrings:\" _page_ 44.]\n\n_Maitreya._ Are you going to sleep?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Yes, so it seems.\n\n    For conquering sleep, descending on mine eyes,\n      First smites the brow with unresisted blow;\n    Unseen, elusive, like old age, she tries\n      To gather strength by weakening her foe.                   8\n\n_Maitreya._ Then let's go to sleep.

Joyfully._] See! The bless\u00c3\u00a8d moon is setting.\nFor well I know,\n\n    My trade would fain from watchmen's eyes be shrouded;\n      Valiant, I force the dwelling of another.\n    But see, the stars in deepest dark are clouded,\n      And the night shields me like a careful mother.            10\n\nI made a breach in the orchard wall and entered. And now I must force my\nway into the inner court as well.\n\n    Yes, let men call it vulgar, if they will,\n      The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;\n    Yes, knavery, not bravery, call it still,\n      To overreach confiding folk a-bed.\n\nP. 86.9]\n\n    Far better blame and hissing, fairly won.\n      Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;\n    This antique path was trod by Drona's son,\n      Who slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.                 11\n\nBut where shall I make the breach?\n\n    Where is the spot which falling drops decayed?\n      For each betraying sound is deadened there.\n    No yawning breach should in the walls be made,\n      So treatises on robbery declare.\n    Where does the palace crumble? Where the place\n      That niter-eaten bricks false soundness wear?\n    Where shall I 'scape the sight of woman's face?\n      Fulfilment of my wishes waits me there.                    12\n\n[_He feels the wall._] Here is a spot weakened by constant sun and\nsprinkling and eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt\nthrown up by a mouse. Now heaven be praised! My venture prospers.\nThis is the first sign of success for Skanda's[46] sons. Now first\nof all, how shall I make the breach? The bless\u00c3\u00a8d Bearer of the\nGolden Lance[47] has prescribed four varieties of breach, thus: if\nthe bricks are baked, pull them out; if they are unbaked, cut\nthem; if they are made of earth, wet them; if they are made of\nwood, split them. Here we have baked bricks; ergo, pull out the\nbricks.\n\n    Now what shall be the shape I give the breach?\n      A \"lotus,\" \"cistern,\" \"crescent moon,\" or \"sun\"?\n    \"Oblong,\" or \"cross,\" or \"bulging pot\"? for each\n      The treatises permit. Which one? which one?\n    And where shall I display my sovereign skill,\n    That in the morning men may wonder still?                    13\n\nIn this wall of baked bricks, the \"bulging pot\" would be effective. I\nwill make that.\n\n[47.16. S.\n\n    At other walls that I have pierced by night,\n      And at my less successful ventures too,\n    The crowd of neighbors gazed by morning light,\n      Assigning praise or blame, as was my due.                  14\n\nPraise to the boon-conferring god, to Skanda of immortal youth!\nPraise to him, the Bearer of the Golden Lance, the Brahman's\ngod, the pious! Praise to him, the Child of the Sun! Praise to him,\nthe teacher of magic, whose first pupil I am! For he found pleasure\nin me and gave me magic ointment,\n\n    With which so I anointed be,\n    No watchman's eye my form shall see;\n    And edged sword that falls on me\n    From cruel wounds shall leave me free.                       15\n\n[_He anoints himself._] Alas, I have forgotten my measuring line.\n[_Reflecting._] Aha! This sacred cord[48] shall be my measuring line.\nYes, the sacred cord is a great blessing to a Brahman, especially to one\nlike me. For, you see,\n\n    With this he measures, ere he pierce a wall,\n      And picks the lock, when jewels are at stake.\n    It serves as key to bolted door and hall,\n      As tourniquet for bite of worm and snake.                  16\n\nThe measuring is done. I begin my task. [_He does so, then takes a\nlook._] My breach lacks but a single brick. Alas, I am bitten by a\nsnake. [_He binds his finger with the sacred cord, and manifests the\nworkings of poison._] I have applied the remedy, and now I am restored.\n[_He continues his work, then gazes._] Ah, there burns a candle.\nSee!\n\n    Though jealous darkness hems it round,\n      The golden-yellow candle from its place\n    Shines through the breach upon the ground,\n      Like a streak of gold upon the touchstone's face.          17\n\nP. 87.9]\n\n[_He returns to his work._] The breach is finished. Good! I enter.\nBut no, I will not enter yet. I will shove a dummy in. [_He does\nso._] Ah, no one is there. Praise be to Skanda! [_He enters and looks\nabout._] See! Two men asleep. Come, for my own protection I will\nopen the door. But the house is old and the door squeaks. I must\nlook for water. Now where might water be? [_He looks about, finds\nwater, and sprinkles the door. Anxiously._] I hope it will not fall\nupon the floor and make a noise. Come, this is the way. [_He puts\nhis back against the door and opens it cautiously._] Good! So much\nfor that. Now I must discover whether these two are feigning\nsleep, or whether they are asleep in the fullest meaning of the\nterm. [_He tries to terrify them, and notes the effect._] Yes, they must\nbe asleep in the fullest meaning of the term. For see!\n\n    Their breath first calmly rises, ere it sink;\n      Its regularity all fear defies.\n      Unmoving in their socket-holes, the eyes\n    Are tightly closed, and never seem to wink.\n    The limbs relaxed, at ease the bodies lie,\n      I see their feet beyond the bedstead peep,\n    The lighted candle vexes not the eye;\n      It would, if they were only feigning sleep.                18\n\n[_He looks about him._] What! a drum? And here is a flute. And\nhere, a snare-drum. And here, a lute. And reed-pipes. And yonder,\nmanuscripts. Is this the house of a dancing-master? But no!\nWhen I entered, I was convinced that this was a palatial residence.\nNow then, is this man poor in the fullest meaning of the term, or,\nfrom fear of the king or of thieves, does he keep his property\nburied? Well, my own property is buried, too. But I will scatter\nthe seeds that betray subterranean gold. [_He does so._] The scattered\nseeds nowhere swell up. Ah, he is poor in the fullest meaning\nof the term. Good! I go.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Talking in his sleep._] Look, man. I see something like\na hole in the wall. I see something like a thief. You had better\ntake this golden casket.\n\n[49.7. S\n\n_Sharvilaka._ I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered,\nand is showing off his poverty in order to make fun of me.\nShall I kill him, or is the poor devil talking in his sleep? [_He takes\na look._] But see! This thing wrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now\nthat I inspect it by the light of my candle, is in truth a jewel-casket\nSuppose I take it. But no! It is hardly proper to rob a\nman of good birth, who is as poor as I am. I go.\n\n_Maitreya._ My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans[49] I conjure\nyou to take this golden casket.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and\nthe wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the\ncandle. I keep about me a moth for the express purpose of extinguishing\ncandles. I will let him enter the flame. This is his place\nand hour. May this moth which I here release, depart to flutter\nabove the flame in varying circles. The breeze from the insect's\nwings has translated the flame into accurs\u00c3\u00a8d darkness. Or shall I\nnot rather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic\nfamily? For my father was a man who knew the four Vedas, who\nwould not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman,\nI am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl\nMadanik\u00c4\u0081. Now I will grant the Brahman's wish. [_He reaches out\nfor the casket._]\n\n_Maitreya._ How cold your fingers are, man!\n\n_Sharvilaka._ What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching\nwater. Well, I will put my hand in my armpit [_He warms his left hand\nand takes the casket._]\n\n_Maitreya._ Have you got it?\n\n_Sharvilaka._ I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.\n\nP. 80.9]\n\n_Maitreya._ Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has\nsold his wares.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a\nBrahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake\nof Madanik\u00c4\u0081, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged\nin darkness.\n\n    A curse on poverty, I say!\n      'T is stranger to the manly will;\n    This act that shuns the light of day\n      I curse indeed, but do it still.                           19\n\nWell then, I must go to Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house to buy Madanik\u00c4\u0081's\nfreedom. [_He walks about and looks around him._] Ah, I think I\nhear footsteps. I hope they are not those of policemen. Never mind.\nI will pretend to be a pillar, and wait. But after all, do policemen\nexist for me, for Sharvilaka? Why, I am\n\n    A cat for crawling, and a deer for flight,\n    A hawk for rending, and a dog for sight\n    To judge the strength of men that wake or sleep,\n    A snake, when 't is advisable to creep,\n    Illusion's self, to seem a saint or rogue,\n    Goddess of Speech in understanding brogue;\n    A light in blackest night, in holes a lizard I can be,\n    A horse on terra firma, and a ship upon the sea.             20\n\nAnd again:\n\n    Quick as a snake, and steady as a hill;\n    In flight the prince of birds can show no greater skill;\n    In searching on the ground I am as keen as any hare,\n    In strength I am a lion, and a wolf to rend and tear.        21\n\n_Radanik\u00c4\u0081._ [_Entering._] Dear me! Vardham\u00c4\u0081naka went to sleep\nin the outer court, and now he is not there. Well, I will call\nMaitreya. [_She walks about._]\n\n[51.1.

Stop your joking. Don't you see it?\n\n_Maitreya._ What do you mean, wench? \"It looks as if a second\ndoor had been thrown open\"? Get up, friend Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, get up!\nA thief has made a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Yes, yes! A truce to your jests!\n\n_Maitreya._ But it isn't a jest. Look!\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Where?\n\n_Maitreya._ Why, here.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Gazing._] What a very remarkable hole!\n\n    The bricks are drawn away below, above;\n      The top is narrow, but the center wide;\n      As if the great house-heart had burst with pride,\n    Fearing lest the unworthy share its love.                    22\n\nTo think that science should be expended on a task like this!\n\n_Maitreya._ My friend, this hole must have been made by one of\ntwo men; either by a stranger, or else for practice by a student\nof the science of robbery. For what man here in Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab does\nnot know how much wealth there is in our house?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rud._\n\n    Stranger he must have been who made the breach,\n      His customed harvest in my house to reap;\n    He has not learned that vanished riches teach\n      A calm, untroubled sleep.\n\n    He saw the sometime greatness of my home\n      And forced an entrance; for his heart did leap\n    With short-lived hope; now he must elsewhere roam,\n      And over broken hopes must sorely weep.                    23\n\nJust think of the poor fellow telling his friends: \"I entered the\nhouse of a merchant's son, and found--nothing.\"\n\nP. 92.4]\n\n_Maitreya._ Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks\nhe--\"Here's a great house. Here's the place to carry off a jewel-casket\nor a gold-casket.\" [_He remembers the casket. Despondently. Aside._]\nWhere _is_ that golden casket? [_He remembers the events of the night.\nAloud._] Look, man! You are always saying \"Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya\nis no scholar.\" But I certainly acted wisely in handing over that golden\ncasket to you. If I hadn't, the son of a slave would have carried it\noff.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ A truce to your jests!\n\n_Maitreya._ Just because I'm a fool, do you suppose I don't even\nknow the place and time for a jest?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ But when did this happen?\n\n_Maitreya._ Why, when I told you that your fingers were cold.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ It might have been. [_He searches about. Joyfully._]\nMy friend, I have something pleasant to tell you.\n\n_Maitreya._ What? Wasn't it stolen?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Yes.\n\n_Maitreya._ What is the pleasant news, then?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ The fact that he did not go away disappointed.\n\n_Maitreya._ But it was only entrusted to our care.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ What! entrusted to our care? [_He swoons._]\n\n_Maitreya._ Come to yourself, man. Is the fact that a thief stole what\nwas entrusted to you, any reason why you should swoon?\n\n53.5.

Who gave anybody\nanything? who received anything from anybody? who was a witness?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ And shall I tell a falsehood now?\n\n    No! I will beg until I earn\n      The wherewithal my debt to pay.\n    Ignoble falsehood I will spurn.\n      That steals the character away.                            26\n\n_Radanik\u00c4\u0081._ I will go and tell his good wife.

When you\ndid what you ought not to have done for my sake, you didn't kill\nanybody or hurt anybody in that house?\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Madanik\u00c4\u0081, Sharvilaka does not strike a terrified man\nor a man asleep. I did not kill anybody nor hurt anybody.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Really?\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Really.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Recovering consciousness._] Ah, I breathe again.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Thank heaven!\n\n_Sharvilaka._ [_Jealously._] What does this \"Thank heaven\" mean,\nMadanik\u00c4\u0081?\n\n    I sinned for you, when love had made me pine,\n      Although my house was good since time began;\n    Love took my virtue, but my pride is mine.\n      _You_ call me friend and love another man?                 9\n\n[_Meaningly._]\n\n    A noble youth is like a goodly tree;\n      His wealth, the fruit so fair;\n    The courtezan is like a bird; for she\n      Pecks him and leaves him bare.                             10\n\n    Love is a fire, whose flame is lust,\n      Whose fuel is gallantry,\n    Wherein our youth and riches must\n      Thus sacrific\u00c3\u00a8d be.                                        11\n\n[62.16.

Surely, he did this thing in\nignorance.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ What is to be done now, Madanik\u00c4\u0081?\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Your own wit should tell you that.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ No. For you must remember,\n\n    Nature herself gives women wit;\n    Men learn from books a little bit.                           19\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ Sharvilaka, if you will take my advice, restore the\njewels to that righteous man.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ But Madanik\u00c4\u0081, what if he should prosecute me?\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ No cruel heat comes from the moon.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Good, Madanik\u00c4\u0081, good!\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Madanik\u00c4\u0081,\n\n    For what I did, I feel no grief nor fear:\n      Why tell me of this good man's virtues high?\n    Shame for my baseness touches me more near;\n      What can this king do to such rogues as I?                 20\n\nNevertheless, your suggestion is inconsistent with prudence.

Trusting to\nthis prophecy, and alarmed thereat, King P\u00c4\u0081laka has taken him\nfrom his hamlet, and thrown him into strict confinement. Therefore\nbe watchful, and every man at his post.\"\n\n_Sharvilaka._ [_Listening._] What! King P\u00c4\u0081laka has imprisoned my\ngood friend Aryaka? And here I am, a married man. Confound it!\nBut no,\n\n    Two things alone--his friend, his wife--\n      Deserve man's love below;\n    A hundred brides may forfeit life\n      Ere he should suffer so.                                   25\n\nGood! I will get out [_He does so._]\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081._ [_Folding her hands. Tearfully._] My lord, if you must,\nat least bring me first to your parents.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Yes, my love. I will. I had the same thought in mind.\n[_To the servant._] My good fellow, do you know the house of the\nmerchant Rebhila?\n\n_Servant._ Certainly.\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Bring my wife thither.\n\n_Servant._ Yes, sir.\n\n_Madanik\u00c4\u0081_. If you desire it, dear. But dear, you must be very\ncareful.                                         [_Exit._\n\nP. 113.6]\n\n_Sharvilaka._ Now as for me,\n\n    I'll rouse my kin, the kitchen cabinet.\n      Those high in fame by strength of good right arm,\n    And those who with the king's contempt have met,\n      And royal slaves, to save my friend from harm:\n        Like old Yaugandhar\u00c4\u0081yana\n        For the good king Udayana.                               26\n\nAnd again:\n\n    My friend has causeless been confined\n    By wicked foes of timid kind;\n    I fly, I fly to free him soon,\n    Like the eclipse-oppress\u00c3\u00a8d moon.                [_Exit._]    27\n\n_Maid._ [_Entering._] Mistress, I congratulate you. A Brahman has\ncome with a message from Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Ah, this is a joyful day. Show him every mark of\nrespect, girl, and have him conducted hither by one of the pages.\n\n_Maid._ Yes, mistress.                               [_Exit._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[_Enter Maitreya with a page._]\n\n_Maitreya._ Well! R\u00c4\u0081vana, the king of the demons, travels with his\nchariot that they call the \"Blossom.\" He earned it by his penances.\nNow I am a Brahman, and though I never performed any penances,\nI travel with another sort of a blossom--a woman of the town.\n\n_Maid._ Sir, will you inspect our gateway.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Gazes admiringly._] It has just been sprinkled and\ncleaned and received a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty\nas a picture with the offerings of all sorts of fragrant flowers. It\nstretches up its head as if it wanted to peep into the sky. It is\nadorned with strings of jasmine garlands that hang down and toss\nabout like the trunk of the heavenly elephant. It shines with its\nhigh ivory portal. It is lovely with any number of holiday banners\nthat gleam red as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as\nthey flutter in the breeze and seem to invite me to enter. Both\nsides are decorated with holiday water-jars of crystal, which are\ncharming with their bright-green mango twigs, and are set at the\nfoot of the pillars that sustain the portal. The doors are of gold,\nthickly set with diamonds as hard to pierce as a giant's breast.\nIt actually wearies a poor devil's envy. Yes, Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's house-door\nis a beautiful thing. Really, it forcibly challenges the attention\nof a man who doesn't care about such things.\n\n[68.16. S.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the first court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the first court\nare rows of balconies brilliant as the moon, or as sea-shells, or as\nlotus-stalks; whitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them;\ngleaming with golden stairways inlaid with all sorts of gems: they\nseem to gaze down on Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab with their round faces, the crystal\nwindows, from which strings of pearls are dangling. The porter sits\nthere and snoozes as comfortably as a professor. The crows which\nthey tempt with rice-gruel and curdled milk will not eat the\noffering, because they can't distinguish it from the mortar. Show\nme the way, madam.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the second court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the second\ncourt the cart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouthfuls of\ngrass and pulse-stalks which are brought them, right and left, by\neverybody. Their horns are smeared with oil. And here is another,\na buffalo, snorting like a gentleman insulted. And here is a ram[53]\nhaving his neck rubbed, like a prize-fighter after the fight. And\nhere are others, horses having their manes put in shape. And here\nin a stall is another, a monkey, tied fast like a thief. [_He looks in\nanother direction._] And here is an elephant, taking from his drivers\na cake of rice and drippings and oil. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the third court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the third court\nare these seats, prepared for young gentlemen to sit on. A half-read\nbook is lying on the gaming-table. And the table itself has\nits own dice, made out of gems. And here, again, are courtezans\nand old hangers-on at court, past masters in the war and peace of\nlove, wandering about and holding in their fingers pictures painted\nin many colors. Show me the way, madam.\n\nP. 117.4]\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the fourth court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the fourth\ncourt the drums that maiden fingers beat are booming like the\nthunder; the cymbals are falling, as the stars fall from heaven when\ntheir merit is exhausted;[54] the pipe is discoursing music as sweet\nas the humming of bees. And here, again, is a lute that somebody\nis holding on his lap like a girl who is excited by jealousy and\nlove, and he is stroking it with his fingers. And here, again, are\ncourtezan girls that sing as charmingly as honey-drunken bees,\nand they are made to dance and recite a drama with love in it.\nAnd water-coolers are hanging in the windows so as to catch the\nbreeze. Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the fifth court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the fifth court\nthe overpowering smell of asafetida and oil is attractive enough\nto make a poor devil's mouth water. The kitchen is kept hot all\nthe time, and the gusts of steam, laden with all sorts of good\nsmells, seem like sighs issuing from its mouth-like doors. The\nsmell of the preparation of all kinds of foods and sauces makes me\nsmack my lips. And here, again, is a butcher's boy washing a mess\nof chitterlings as if it were an old loin-cloth. The cook is preparing\nevery kind of food. Sweetmeats are being constructed, cakes\nare being baked. [_To himself._] I wonder if I am to get a chance to\nwash my feet and an invitation to eat what I can hold. [_He looks\nin another direction._] There are courtezans and bastard pages,\nadorned with any number of jewels, just like Gandharvas[55] and\nApsarases.[56] Really, this house is heaven. Tell me, who are you\nbastards anyway?\n\n[70.13. S.\n\n_Pages._ Why, we are bastard pages--\n\n    Petted in a stranger's court.\n      Fed on stranger's food,\n    Stranger's money makes us sport--\n      Not so very good.\n    Stranger women gave us birth.\n      Stranger men begot;\n    Baby elephants in mirth,\n      We're a bastard lot.                                       28\n\n_Maitreya._ Show me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the sixth court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the sixth\ncourt they are working in gold and jewels. The arches set with\nsapphires look as if they were the home of the rainbow. The jewelers\nare testing the lapis lazuli, the pearls, the corals, the topazes,\nthe sapphires, the cat's-eyes, the rubies, the emeralds, and all the\nother kinds of gems. Rubies are being set in gold. Golden ornaments\nare being fashioned. Pearls are being strung on a red cord.\nPieces of lapis lazuli are being cleverly polished. Shells are being\npierced. Corals are being ground. Wet bundles of saffron are being\ndried. Musk is being moistened. Sandalwood is being ground\nto make sandal-water. Perfumes are being compounded. Betel-leaves\nand camphor are being given to courtezans and their lovers.\nCoquettish glances are being exchanged. Laughter is going on.\nWine is being drunk incessantly with sounds of glee. Here are\nmen-servants, here are maid-servants, and here are men who forget\nchild and wife and money. When the courtezans, who have\ndrunk the wine from the liquor-jars, give them the mitten, they--drink.\nShow me the way, madam.\n\nP. 121.5]\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the seventh court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the seventh\ncourt the mated doves are sitting comfortably in their snug dovecotes,\nbilling and cooing and nothing else, and perfectly happy.\nAnd there is a parrot in a cage, chanting like a Brahman with a\nbellyful of curdled milk and rice. And here, again, is a talking\nthrush, chattering like a housemaid who spreads herself because\nsomebody noticed her. A cuckoo, her throat still happy from tasting\nall sorts of fruit-syrups, is cooing like a procuress. Rows of\ncages are hanging from pegs. Quails are being egged on to fight.\nPartridges are being made to talk. Caged pigeons are being provoked.\nA tame peacock that looks as if he was adorned with all\nsorts of gems is dancing happily about, and as he flaps his wings,\nhe seems to be fanning the roof which is distressed by the rays\nof the sun. [_He looks in another direction._] Here are pairs of flamingos\nlike moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after\npretty girls, as if they wanted to learn how to walk gracefully.\nAnd here, again, are tame cranes, walking around like ancient\neunuchs. Well, well! This courtezan keeps a regular menagerie of\nbirds. Really, the courtezan's house seems to me like Indra's heaven.\nShow me the way, madam.\n\n_Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the eighth court.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Madam, who is this in the\nsilk cloak, adorned with such astonishingly tautologous ornaments,\nwho wanders about, stumbling and stretching his limbs?\n\n_Maid._ Sir, this is my mistress' brother.\n\n_Maitreya._ What sort of ascetic exercises does a man have to perform,\nin order to be born as Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's brother? But no,\n\n    He may be shiny, may be greasy,\n      And perfumed may he be.\n    And yet I warn you to go easy;\n      He's a graveyard champak-tree.                             29\n\n[_He looks in another direction._] But madam, who is that in the\nexpansive garment, sitting on the throne? She has shoes on her\ngreasy feet.\n\n[72.9. S.\n\n_Maid._ Sir, that is my mistress' mother.\n\n_Maitreya._ Lord! What an extensive belly the dirty old witch has\ngot! I suppose they couldn't put that superb portal on the house\ntill after they had brought the idol in?\n\n_Maid._ Rascal! You must not make fun of our mother so. She is\npining away under a quartan ague.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Bursts out laughing._] O thou bless\u00c3\u00a8d quartan ague!\nLook thou upon a Brahman, even upon me, with this thy favor!\n\n_Maid._ Rascal! May death strike you.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Bursts out laughing._] Why, wench, a pot-belly like\nthat is better dead.\n\n    Drinking brandy, rum, and wine,\n      Mother fell extremely ill.\n    If mother now should peak and pine,\n      A jackal-pack would have its fill.                         30\n\nWell, I have seen Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's palace with its many incidents\nand its eight courts, and really, it seems as if I had seen the triple\nheaven in a nut-shell. I haven't the eloquence to praise it. Is this\nthe house of a courtezan, or a piece of Kubera's[57] palace? Where's\nyour mistress?\n\n_Maid._ She is here in the orchard. Enter, sir.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! What a beautiful orchard!\nThere are any number of trees planted here, and they are\ncovered with the most wonderful flowers. Silken swings are hung\nunder the thick-set trees, just big enough for a girl to sit in. The\ngolden jasmine, the sheph\u00c4\u0081lik\u00c4\u0081, the white jasmine, the jessamine,\nthe navamallik\u00c4\u0081, the amaranth, the spring creeper, and all the other\nflowers have fallen of themselves, and really, it makes Indra's heaven\nlook dingy. [_He looks in another direction._] And the pond here\nlooks like the morning twilight, for the lilies and red lotuses are\nas splendid as the rising sun. And again:\n\n    The ashoka-tree, whose twigs so merry\n      And crimson flowers have just appeared,\n    Seems like a battling mercenary,\n      With clotting crimson gore besmeared.                      31\n\nGood! Now where's your mistress?\n\nP. 126.7]\n\n_Maid._ If you would stop star-gazing, sir, you would see her.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Perceives Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 and approaches._] Heaven bless\nyou!\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Speaking in Sanskrit._[58]] Ah, Maitreya! [_Rising._] You\nare very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya._ When you are seated, madam. [_They both seat themselves._]\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Is the merchant's son well?\n\n_Maitreya._ Well, madam.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Tell me, good Maitreya,\n\n    Do friends, like birds, yet seek a shelter free\n    Beneath the modest boughs of this fair tree,\n    Whose leaves are virtues, confidence its root,\n    Its blossoms honor, good its precious fruit?                 32\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Aside._] A good description by a naughty woman.\n[_Aloud._] They do, indeed.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?\n\n_Maitreya._ Listen, madam. The excellent Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta folds his\nhands[59] and requests--\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Folding her hands._] And commands--\n\n_Maitreya._ He says he imagined that that golden casket was his\nown and gambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master\nhas gone, for he is employed in the king's business.\n\n[74.9. S.\n\n_Maid._ Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman has turned\ngambler.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Aside._] It was stolen by a thief, and he is so proud\nthat he says he gambled it away. I love him for that.\n\n_Maitreya._ He requests that you will therefore be good enough to\naccept in its place this necklace of pearls.\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Aside._] Shall I show him the jewels? [_Reflecting._]\nNo, not yet.\n\n_Maitreya._ Why don't you take this necklace?\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ [_Laughs and looks at her friend._] Why should I not\ntake the necklace, Maitreya? [_She takes it and lays it away. Aside._]\nHow is it possible that drops of honey fall from the mango-tree,\neven after its blossoms are gone? [_Aloud._] Sir, pray tell the worthy\ngambler Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta in my name that I shall pay him a visit this\nevening.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Aside._] What else does she expect to get out of a visit\nto our house? [_Aloud._] Madam, I will tell him--[_Aside_ to have\nnothing more to do with this courtezan.                      [_Exit._\n\n_Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081._ Take these jewels, girl. Let us go and bring cheer\nto Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n_Maid._ But mistress, see! An untimely storm is gathering.\n\n_Vasant._\n\n    The clouds may come, the rain may fall forever,\n      The night may blacken in the sky above;\n    For this I care not, nor I will not waver;\n      My heart is journeying to him I love.                      33\n\nTake the necklace, girl, and come quickly.

For see!\n    The peacocks gaze and lift their fans on high;\n      The swans forget their purpose to depart;\n    The untimely storm afflicts the blackened sky,\n      And the wistful lover's heart.                             1\n\nAnd again:\n\n    The wet bull's belly wears no deeper dye;\n      In flashing lightning's golden mantle clad,\n      While cranes, his buglers, make the heaven glad,\n    The cloud, a second Vishnu,[61] mounts the sky.              2\n\nAnd yet again:\n\n    As dark as Vishnu's form, with circling cranes\n    To trumpet him, instead of bugle strains,\n      And garmented in lightning's silken robe.\n    Approaches now the harbinger of rains.                       3\n\n    When lightning's lamp is lit, the silver river\n      Impetuous falls from out the cloudy womb;\n      Like severed lace from heaven-cloaking gloom,\n    It gleams an instant, then is gone forever.                  4\n\n    Like shoaling fishes, or like dolphins shy,\n    Or like to swans, toward heaven's vault that fly,\n      Like paired flamingos, male and mate together,\n    Like mighty pinnacles that tower on high.\n      In thousand forms the tumbling clouds embrace,\n      Though torn by winds, they gather, interlace,\n    And paint the ample canvas of the sky.                       5\n\n    The sky is black as Dhritar\u00c4\u0081shtra's face;\n    Proud as the champion of Kuru's race.\n      The haughty peacock shrills his joy abroad;\n    The cuckoo, in Yudhishthira's sad case,\n      Is forced to wander if he would not die;\n      The swans must leave their forest-homes and fly,\n    Like P\u00c4\u0081ndu's sons, to seek an unknown place.                 6\n\n[_Reflecting._] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081.\nAnd even yet he does not come.      [_Enter Maitreya._]\n\n[76.20. S.\n\n_Maitreya._ Confound the courtezan's avarice and her incivility! To\nthink of her making so short a story of it! Over and over she\nrepeats something about the affection she feels, and then without\nmore ado she pockets the necklace. She is rich enough so that\nshe might at least have said: \"Good Maitreya, rest a little. You\nmust not go until you have had a cup to drink.\" Confound the\ncourtezan! I hope I 'll never set eyes on her again. [_Wearily._]\nThe proverb is right. \"It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a\nroot, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who never steals,\na village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan without avarice.\"\nWell, I 'll find my friend and persuade him to have nothing\nmore to do with this courtezan. [_He walks about until he discovers\nCh\u00c4\u0081rudatta._] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard. I 'll\ngo to him. [_Approaching._] Heaven bless you! May happiness be\nyours.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Looking up._] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned.\nYou are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.\n\n_Maitreya._ Thank you.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Tell me of your errand, my friend.\n\n_Maitreya._ My errand went all wrong.\n\nP. 132.8]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ What! did she not accept the necklace?\n\n_Maitreya._ How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put\nher lotus-tender hands to her brow,[62] and took it.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Then why do you say \"went wrong\"?\n\n_Maitreya._ Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride\nof the four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before\nwe had a bite or a drink out of it?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Not so, my friend.\n\n    She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;\n    The price of confidence has no less measure.                 7\n\n_Maitreya._ Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped\nher friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress,\nand laughed at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall\non my face before you and beg you not to have anything more\nto do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any amount\nof damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts\nbefore you get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan,\nan elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an\nass--where these dwell, not even rogues are born.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My\npoverty of itself prevents me. For consider:\n\n    The horse would gladly hasten here and there,\n      But his legs fail him, for his breath departs.\n    So men's vain wishes wander everywhere,\n      Then, weary grown, return into their hearts.               8\n\nThen too, my friend:\n\n    If wealth is thine, the maid is thine,\n      For maids are won by gold;\n\n[_Aside._ And not by virtue cold. _Aloud._]\n\n    But wealth is now no longer mine,\n    And her I may not hold.                                      9\n\n[78.23. S.\n\n_Maitreya._ [_Looks down. Aside._] From the way he looks up and\nsighs, I conclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased\nhis longing. The proverb is right. \"You can't reason with\na lover.\" [_Aloud._] Well, she told me to tell you that she would\nhave to come here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with\nthe necklace and is coming to look for something else.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.\n                                           [_Enter Kumbh\u00c4\u00ablaka._]\n\n_Kumbh\u00c4\u00ablaka._ Listen, good people.\n\n    The more it rains in sheets,\n      The more my skin gets wet;\n    The more the cold wind beats,\n      The more I shake and fret.                                 10\n\n[_He bursts out laughing._]\n\n    I make the sweet flute speak from seven holes,\n      I make the loud lute speak on seven strings;\n    In singing, I essay the donkey's r\u00c3\u00b4les:\n      No god can match my music when he sings.                   11\n\nMy mistress Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 said to me \"Kumbh\u00c4\u00ablaka, go and tell Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta\nthat I am coming.\" So here I am, on my way to Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's house.

[_He returns to\nSansth\u00c4\u0081naka._] Jackass, there is indeed a witch who makes her\nhome in the cart.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ But shir, if a witch is living there, why are n't you\nrobbed? And if it 's a thief, why are n't you eaten alive?\n\n_Courtier._ Why try to determine that? But if we should go back\non foot through the gardens until we came to the city, to Ujjayin\u00c4\u00ab,\nwhat harm would that do?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ And if we did, what then?\n\n[121.7.

[_He does so._]\n\n[_Enter the judge, accompanied by a gild-warden, a clerk, and others._]\n\n_Judge._ Gild-warden and clerk!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ We await your bidding.\n\n_Judge._ A trial depends to such an extent upon others that the task\nof the magistrates--the reading of another's thoughts--is most\ndifficult.\n\n    Men often speak of deeds that no man saw,\n    Matters beyond the province of the law;\n    Passion so rules the parties that their lies,\n    Hide their offenses from judicial eyes;\n    This side and that exaggerate a thing,\n    Until at last it implicates the king;\n    To sum it up: false blame is easy won,\n    A true judge little praised, or praised by none.             3\n\nAnd again:\n\n    Men often point to sins that no man saw,\n    And in their anger scorn the patient law;\n    In court-rooms even the righteous with their lies\n    Hide their offenses from judicial eyes;\n    And those who did the deed are lost to view,\n    Who sinned with plaintiff and defendant too;\n    To sum it up: false blame is easy won,\n    A true judge little praised, or praised by none.             4\n\nFor the judge must be\n\n    Learn\u00c3\u00a8d, and skilled in tracing fraud's sly path,\n    And eloquent, insensible to wrath;\n    To friend, foe, kinsman showing equal grace,\n    Reserving judgment till he know the case;\n    Untouched by avarice, in virtue sound.\n    The weak he must defend, the knave confound;\n    An open door to truth, his heart must cling\n    To others' interests, yet shun each thing\n    That might awake the anger of the king.                      5\n\n[137.94. S.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ And do men speak of defects in your\nvirtue? If so, then they speak of darkness in the moonlight.\n\n_Judge._ My good beadle, conduct me to the court-room.\n\n_Beadle._ Follow me, Your Honor. [_They walk about._] Here is the\ncourt-room. May the magistrates be pleased to enter. [_All enter._]\n\n_Judge._ My good beadle, do you go outside and learn who desires\nto present a case.\n\n_Beadle._ Yes, sir. [_He goes out._] Gentlemen, the magistrates ask if\nthere is any here who desires to present a case.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Gleefully._] The magishtrates are here. [_He struts\nabout._] I desire to present a cashe, I, an arishtocrat, a man, a\nV\u00c4\u0081sudeva, the royal brother-in-law, the brother-in-law of the king.\n\n_Beadle._ [_In alarm._] Goodness! The king's brother-in-law is the first\nwho desires to present a case. Well! Wait a moment, sir. I will inform\nthe magistrates at once. [_He approaches the magistrates._] Gentlemen,\nhere is the king's brother-in-law who has come to court,\ndesiring to present a case.\n\n_Judge._ What! the king's brother-in-law is the first who desires to\npresent a case? Like an eclipse at sunrise, this betokens the ruin\nof some great man. Beadle, the court will doubtless be very busy\nto-day. Go forth, my good man, and say \"Leave us for to-day.\nYour suit cannot be considered.\"\n\n_Beadle._ Yes, Your Honor. [_He goes out, and approaches Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._]\nSir, the magistrates send word that you are to leave them for to-day;\nthat your suit cannot be considered.\n\nP. 229.13]\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Wrathfully._] Confound it! Why can't my shuit be\nconshidered? If it is n't conshidered, then I 'll tell my brother-in-law,\nKing P\u00c4\u0081laka, my shishter's husband, and I 'll tell my shishter\nand my mother too, and I 'll have thish judge removed, and another\njudge appointed. [_He starts to go away._]\n\n_Beadle._ Oh, sir! Brother-in-law of the king! Wait a moment. I\nwill inform the magistrates at once. [_He returns to the Judge._] The\nbrother-in-law of the king is angry, and says--[_He repeats Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka's\nwords._]\n\n_Judge._ This fool might do anything. My good man, tell him to\ncome hither, that his suit will be considered.\n\n_Beadle._ [_Approaching Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._] Sir, the magistrates send\nword that you are to come in, that your suit will be considered.\nPray enter, sir.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Firsht they shay it won't be conshidered, then they\nshay it will be conshidered. The magishtrates are shcared. Whatever\nI shay, I 'll make 'em believe it. Good! I 'll enter. [_He enters\nand approaches the magistrates._] I am feeling very well, thank you.\nWhether you feel well or not--that depends on me.\n\n_Judge._ [_Aside._] Well, well! We seem to have a highly cultivated\nplaintiff. [_Aloud._] Pray be seated.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Well! Thish floor belongs to me. I 'll sit down wherever\nI like. [_To the gild-warden._] I'll sit here. [_To the beadle._]\nWhy should n't I sit here? [_He lays his hand on the Judge's head._]\nI 'll sit here. [_He sits down on the floor._]\n\n_Judge._ You desire to present a case?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Of courshe.\n\n_Judge._ Then state the case.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ I 'll whishper it. I was born in the great family of\na man as glorioush as a wine-glass.\n\n    My father's father of the king--in law;\n    The king, he is my daddy's son-in-law;\n    And I am brother to the king--in law;\n    And the husband of my shishter is the king.                  6\n\n[140.1. S.\n\n_Judge._ All this we know.\n\n    Why should you boast of this your noble birth?\n    'T is character that makes the man of worth;\n    But thorns and weeds grow rank in fertile earth.             7\n\nState your case.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ I will, but even if I was guilty, he wouldn't do\nanything to me. Well, my shishter's husband liked me, and gave\nme the besht garden there is, the old garden Pushpakaranda, to\nplay in and look after. And there I go every day to look at it, to\nkeep it dry, to keep it clean, to keep it blosshoming, to keep it\ntrimmed. But fate decreed that I shaw--or rather, I didn't _shee_--the\nproshtrate body of a woman.\n\n_Judge._ Do you know who the unfortunate woman was?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Hello, magishtrates! Why shouldn't I know? A\nwoman like that! the pearl of the city! adorned with a hundred\ngolden ornaments! Shomebody's unworthy shon enticed her into\nthe old garden Pushpakaranda when it was empty, and for a\nmere trifle--for her money!--shtrangled Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 and killed\nher. But _I_ didn't--[_He breaks off, and puts his hand over his\nmouth._]\n\n_Judge._ What carelessness on the part of the city police! Gild-warden\nand clerk, write down the words \"I didn't,\" as the first\narticle in the case.\n\n_Clerk._ Yes, sir. [_He does so._] Sir, it is written.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Aside._] Goodnessh! Now I've ruined myshelf, like\na man that shwallows a cake of rice and milk in a hurry. Well,\nI'll get out of it thish way. [_Aloud._] Well, well, magishtrates! I\nwas jusht remarking that I didn't shee it happen. What are you\nmaking thish hullabaloo about? [_He wipes out the written words\nwith his foot._]\n\nP. 233.3]\n\n_Judge._ How do you know that she was strangled--and for her\nmoney?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Hello! Why shouldn't I think sho, when her neck\nwas shwollen and bare, and the places where you wear jewels\ndid n't have any gold on them?\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ That seems plausible.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Aside._] Thank heaven! I breathe again. Hooray!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Upon whom does the conduct of this\ncase depend?\n\n_Judge._ The case has a twofold aspect.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ How so?\n\n_Judge._ We have to consider the allegations, then the facts. Now\nthe investigation of the allegations depends upon plaintiff and defendant.\nBut the investigation of the facts must be carried out by\nthe wisdom of the judge.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Then the conduct of the case depends\nupon the presence of Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's mother?\n\n_Judge._ Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's mother,\nwithout, however, giving her cause for anxiety.\n\n_Beadle._ Yes, Your Honor. [_He goes out, and returns with the\nmother of the courtezan._] Follow me, madam.\n\n_Mother._ My daughter went to the house of a friend to enjoy her\nyouth. But now comes this gentleman--long life to him!--and\nsays \"Come! The judge summons you.\" I find myself quite bewildered.\nMy heart is palpitating. Sir, will you conduct me to the\ncourt-room?\n\n_Beadle._ Follow me, madam. [_They walk about._] Here is the court-room.\nPray enter, madam. [_They enter._]\n\n_Mother._ [_Approaching._] Happiness be yours, most worthy gentlemen.\n\n_Judge._ My good woman, you are very welcome. Pray be seated.\n\n[141.24. S.\n\n_Mother._ Thank you. [_She seats herself._]\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Abusively._] You 're here, are you, you old bawd?\n\n_Judge._ Tell me. Are you Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's mother?\n\n_Mother._ I am.\n\n_Judge._ Whither has Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 gone at this moment?\n\n_Mother._ To the house of a friend.\n\n_Judge._ What is the name of her friend?\n\n_Mother._ [_Aside._] Dear me! Really, this is very embarrassing.\n[_Aloud._] Any one else might ask me this, but not a judge.\n\n_Judge._ Pray do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts\nthe question.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ The conduct of the case puts the question.\nYou incur no fault. Speak.\n\n_Mother._ What! the conduct of the case? If that is so, then listen,\nworthy gentlemen. There lives in the merchants' quarter the\ngrandson of the merchant Vinayadatta, the son of S\u00c4\u0081garadatta,\na man whose name is a good omen in itself--that name is Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\nIn his house my daughter enjoys her youth.\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Did you hear that? Write those words down. My\ncontention is with Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ It is no sin for Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta to be her\nfriend.\n\n_Judge._ The conduct of this case demands the presence of Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Exactly.\n\n_Judge._ Dhanadatta, write as the first article in the case \"Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081\nwent to the house of Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\" But must we summon the\nworthy Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta also? No, the conduct of the case summons\nhim. Go, my good beadle, summon Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta,--but gently, without\nhaste, without giving him cause for anxiety, respectfully, as it\nwere incidentally,--with the words \"The judge wishes to see you.\"\n\nP. 236.11]\n\n_Beadle._ Yes, Your Honor. [_He goes out, then returns with Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._]\nFollow me, sir.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Thoughtfully._]\n\n    My character and kin are known\n      Unto the king who rules our state;\n    And in this summons there is shown\n      A doubt begotten of my wretched fate.                      8\n\n[_Reflectively. Aside._]\n\n    Ah! Were there those, the man to recognize\n      Who met me on the road, from bondage freed?\n    Or did the king, who sees through cunning spies,\n      Learn that my cart was lent him in his need?\n    Why should I else be forced to tread the street,\n    Like one accused of crime, my judge to meet?                 9\n\nBut why consider thus? I must go to the court-room. My good\nbeadle, conduct me to the court.\n\n_Beadle._ Follow me, sir. [_They walk about._]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Apprehensively._] And what means this?\n\n    Hear how the gloomy raven hoarsely croaks;\n      The slaves of justice summon me again;\n    My left eye twitches; these repeated strokes\n      Of threatened evil frighten me and pain.                   10\n\n_Beadle._ Follow me, sir, gently and without haste.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Walks about and looks before him._]\n\n    Upon the withered tree, a crow\n      Turns to the sun;\n    His left eye falls on me. Ah, woe!\n      My doubt is done.                                          11\n\n[_He looks in another direction._] But see! a snake!\n\n    His eye is fixed upon me; and his back\n    Flashes like antimony's lustrous black;\n    His long tongue quivers; four white fangs appear;\n    His belly swells and coils. He slumbered here,\n    This prince of serpents, till I crossed his path,\n    And now he darts upon me in his wrath.                       12\n\n[143.21. S.\n\nAnd more than this:\n\n    I slip, although the ground has felt no rain;\n    My left eye, and my left arm throb again;\n    Another bird is screaming overhead;\n    All bodes a cruel death, and hope is fled.                   13\n\nSurely, the gods will grant that all may yet be well.\n\n_Beadle._ Follow me, sir. Here is the court-room. Pray enter.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Enters and looks about._] How wonderfully splendid\nis the court-room. For it seems an ocean,\n\n    Whose waters are the king's advisers, deep\n    In thought; as waves and shells it seems to keep\n    The attorneys; and as sharks and crocodiles\n    It has its spies that stand in waiting files;\n    Its elephants and horses[83] represent\n    The cruel ocean-fish on murder bent;\n    As if with herons of the sea, it shines\n    With screaming pettifoggers' numerous lines;\n    While in the guise of serpents, scribes are creeping\n      Upon its statecraft-trodden shore: the court\n    The likeness of an ocean still is keeping,\n      To which all harmful-cruel beasts resort.                  14\n\nCome! [_As he enters, he strikes his head against the door. Reflectively._]\nAlas! This also?\n\n    My left eye throbs; a raven cries;\n      A serpent coils athwart my path.\n    My safety now with heaven lies.                              15\n\nBut I must enter. [_He does so._]\n\nP. 238.16]\n\n_Judge._ This is Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\n\n    A countenance like his, with clear-cut nose,\n    Whose great, wide-opened eye frank candor shows,\n      Is not the home of wantonness;\n    With elephants, with horses, and with kine,\n    The outer form is inner habit's sign;\n      With men no less.                                          16\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ My greetings to the officers of justice. Officials, I salute\nyou.\n\n_Judge._ [_Betraying his agitation._] You are very welcome, sir. My\ngood beadle, give the gentleman a seat.\n\n_Beadle._ [_Brings a seat._] Here is a seat. Pray be seated, sir.\n[_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta seats himself._]\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Angrily._] You're here, are you, you woman-murderer?\nWell! Thish is a fine trial, thish is a jusht trial, where they\ngive a sheat to thish woman-murderer. [_Haughtily._] But it's all\nright. They can give it to him.\n\n_Judge._ Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, have you any attachment, or affection, or\nfriendship, with this lady's daughter?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ What lady?\n\n_Judge._ This lady. [_He indicates Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081's mother._]\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Rising._] Madam, I salute you.\n\n_Mother._ Long life to you, my son! [_Aside._] So this is Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.\nMy daughter's youth is in good hands.\n\n_Judge._ Sir, is the courtezan your friend? [_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta betrays his\nembarrassment._]\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._\n\n    He tries to hide the deed he did;\n      He lies, from shame or fear;\n    He murdered her, of her got rid\n    For gold, and thinks the deed is hid;\n      Not sho his mashter here.                                  17\n\n[145.18. S.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Speak, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. Do not be ashamed.\nThis is a lawsuit.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_In embarrassment._] Officials, how can I testify that\na courtezan is my friend? But at worst, it is youth that bears the\nblame, not character.\n\n_Judge._\n\n    The case is hard; then banish shame,\n      Though it oppress your heart;\n    Speak truth with fortitude, and aim\n      To set deceit apart.                                       18\n\nDo not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the question.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Officer, with whom have I a lawsuit?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ [_Arrogantly._] With me!\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ A lawsuit with you is unendurable!\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Well, well, woman-murderer! You murder a woman\nlike Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081 who used to wear a hundred gems, and now you\ntry deceitful deceivings to hide it!\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ You are a fool.\n\n_Judge._ Enough of him, good Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. Speak the truth. Is the\ncourtezan your friend?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ She is.\n\n_Judge._ Sir, where is Vasantasen\u00c4\u0081?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ She has gone home.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ How did she go? When did she go? Who\naccompanied her?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ [_Aside._] Shall I say that she went unobserved?\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk._ Speak, sir.\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ She went home. What more shall I say?\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ She was enticed into my old garden Pushpakaranda,\nand was shtrangled for her money. Now will you shay that she\nwent home?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ Man, you are crazy.\n\n    The very clouds of heaven wet not you;\n      Your lips are like the blue-jay's wing-tip worn,\n    Yes, full as fickle with their speech untrue,\n      And like the winter lotus lustre-lorn.                     19\n\nP. 241.19]\n\n_Judge._ [_Aside._]\n\n    Take the Himalayan hills within your hand,\n    And swim from ocean strand to ocean strand,\n    And hold within your grasp the fleeting wind:\n    Then may you think that Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta sinned.                   20\n\n[_Aloud._] This is the noble Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta. How could he commit this crime?\n[_He repeats the verse_ \"A countenance like his:\" _page 141._]\n\n_Sansth\u00c4\u0081naka._ Why thish partiality in a lawshuit?\n\n_Judge._ Away, you fool!\n\n    Illiterate, you gloss the Sacred Law,\n      And still your tongue uninjured find?\n    The midday sun with steadfast eye you saw,\n      And are not straightway stricken blind?\n    You thrust your hand into the blazing fire,\n      And draw it forth, unscathed and sound?\n    Drag Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta's virtue in the mire,\n      Nor sink beneath this yawning ground?                      21\n\nHow could the noble Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta commit a crime?\n\n    Of all the riches of the mighty sea\n      Only the swelling waters now are left,\n    Because, without consideration, he--\n      For others' good--himself of all has reft.\n    And should this high-souled man, this store-house where\n      All gems of virtue gather and unite,\n    For lucre's sake, so foul a trespass dare\n      That in it even his foe could not delight?                 22\n\n_Mother._ You scoundrel! When the golden casket that was left\nwith him as a pledge was stolen by thieves at night, he gave in\nplace of it a pearl necklace that was the pride of the four seas.\nAnd he should now, for a mere trifle--for her money!--do this\nsin? Oh, my child, come back to me, my daughter! [_She weeps._]\n\n[147.16. S.\n\n_Judge._ Noble Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta, did she go on foot, or in a bullock-cart?\n\n_Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta._ I did not see her when she went. Therefore I do not\nknow whether she went on foot, or in a bullock-cart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[_Enter V\u00c4\u00abraka, in anger._]\n\n_V\u00c4\u00abraka._\n\n    My anger was so prodded to the quick,\n    By that dishonoring, insulting kick,\n    And so I brooded, till at last the night\n    Unwilling yielded to the dawning light.                      23\n\nSo now I will go to the court-room. [_He enters._] May happiness\nbe the lot of these honorable gentlemen.\n\n_Judge._ Ah, it is V\u00c4\u00abraka, the captain of the guard. V\u00c4\u00abraka, what\nis the purpose of your coming?\n\n_V\u00c4\u00abraka._ Well! I was looking for Aryaka, in all the excitement\nabout his escape from prison. I had my suspicions about a covered\nbullock-cart that was coming, and wanted to look in. \"You 've\nmade one inspection, man, I must make another,\" said I, and then\nI was kicked by the highly respectable Chandanaka. You have\nheard the matter, gentlemen. The rest is your affair.\n\n_Judge._ My good man, do you know to whom the bullock-cart\nbelonged?\n\n_V\u00c4\u00abraka._ To this gentleman here, Ch\u00c4\u0081rudatta.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":761,"split":"train"}
