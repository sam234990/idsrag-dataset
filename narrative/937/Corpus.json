This upsets his family and particularly his lady friend, Julia Dallow, a beautiful but demanding woman deeply involved in political campaigns. But Nick's old Oxford friend Gabriel Nash encourages him to follow his desire to become an artist. Despite his misgivings Nick goes through an election campaign and wins a seat in Parliament. He proposes marriage to Julia but they agree to wait.\nMeanwhile, Nick's cousin Peter Sherringham, a rising young man in the British diplomatic service, encounters a young actress, Miriam Rooth, in Paris. He falls in love with Miriam, who shows great energy but is a woefully raw talent. Peter introduces Miriam to French acting coach Madame Carre, and Miriam begins to improve her acting technique greatly.\nNick at last tires completely of politics and resigns from Parliament. He thus loses a large bequest from his political patron, Mr. Carteret. Nick becomes a full-time painter, and when Miriam comes to London in search of theatrical success, she sits to Nick for her portrait as \"the tragic muse.\" Julia finds the two together in the studio. Although nothing improper is going on, Julia suddenly and bitterly realizes that Nick is dedicated to art and will never return to politics.\nMiriam eventually triumphs as an actress, especially as Juliet. Peter proposes marriage to her, but she refuses and instead marries Basil Dashwood, her business manager. Peter accepts a diplomatic assignment in Central America. He returns to London on leave and becomes engaged to Biddy Dormer, Nick's sister. The novel ends with a suggestion that Nick and Julia may eventually marry, after all.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Tragic Muse, by Henry James\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

If it be ever of interest and\nprofit to put one's finger on the productive germ of a work of art, and\nif in fact a lucid account of any such work involves that prime\nidentification, I can but look on the present fiction as a poor\nfatherless and motherless, a sort of unregistered and unacknowledged\nbirth. I fail to recover my precious first moment of consciousness of\nthe idea to which it was to give form; to recognise in it--as I like to\ndo in general--the effect of some particular sharp impression or\nconcussion. I call such remembered glimmers always precious, because\nwithout them comes no clear vision of what one may have intended, and\nwithout that vision no straight measure of what one may have succeeded\nin doing. What I make out from furthest back is that I must have had\nfrom still further back, must in fact practically have always had, the\nhappy thought of some dramatic picture of the \"artist-life\" and of the\ndifficult terms on which it is at the best secured and enjoyed, the\ngeneral question of its having to be not altogether easily paid for. To\n\"do something about art\"--art, that is, as a human complication and a\nsocial stumbling-block--must have been for me early a good deal of a\nnursed intention, the conflict between art and \"the world\" striking me\nthus betimes as one of the half-dozen great primary motives. I remember\neven having taken for granted with this fond inveteracy that no one of\nthese pregnant themes was likely to prove under the test more full of\nmatter. This being the case, meanwhile, what would all experience have\ndone but enrich one's conviction?--since if, on the one hand, I had\ngained a more and more intimate view of the nature of art and the\nconditions therewith imposed, so the world was a conception that clearly\nrequired, and that would for ever continue to take, any amount of\nfilling-in. The happy and fruitful truth, at all events, was that there\nwas opposition--why there _should_ be was another matter--and that the\nopposition would beget an infinity of situations. What had doubtless\noccurred in fact, moreover, was that just this question of the essence\nand the reasons of the opposition had shown itself to demand the light\nof experience; so that to the growth of experience, truly, the treatment\nof the subject had yielded. It had waited for that advantage.\n\nYet I continue to see experience giving me its jog mainly in the form of\nan invitation from the gentle editor of the _Atlantic_, the late Thomas\nBailey Aldrich, to contribute to his pages a serial that should run\nthrough the year. That friendly appeal becomes thus the most definite\nstatement I can make of the \"genesis\" of the book; though from the\nmoment of its reaching me everything else in the matter seems to live\nagain. What lives not least, to be quite candid, is the fact that I was\nto see this production make a virtual end, for the time, as by its\nsinister effect--though for reasons still obscure to me--of the pleasant\nold custom of the \"running\" of the novel. Not for many years was I to\nfeel the practice, for my benefit, confidingly revive. The influence of\n_The Tragic Muse_ was thus exactly other than what I had all earnestly\n(if of course privately enough) invoked for it, and I remember well the\nparticular chill, at last, of the sense of my having launched it in a\ngreat grey void from which no echo or message whatever would come back.\nNone, in the event, ever came, and as I now read the book over I find\nthe circumstance make, in its name, for a special tenderness of charity;\neven for that finer consideration hanging in the parental breast about\nthe maimed or slighted, the disfigured or defeated, the unlucky or\nunlikely child--with this hapless small mortal thought of further as\nsomehow \"compromising.\" I am thus able to take the thing as having quite\nwittingly and undisturbedly existed for itself alone, and to liken it to\nsome aromatic bag of gathered herbs of which the string has never been\nloosed; or, better still, to some jar of potpourri, shaped and\noverfigured and polished, but of which the lid, never lifted, has\nprovided for the intense accumulation of the fragrance within. The\nconsistent, the sustained, preserved _tone_ of _The Tragic Muse_, its\nconstant and doubtless rather fine-drawn truth to its particular sought\npitch and accent, are, critically speaking, its principal merit--the\ninner harmony that I perhaps presumptuously permit myself to compare to\nan unevaporated scent.\n\nAfter which indeed I may well be summoned to say what I mean, in such a\nbusiness, by an appreciable \"tone\" and how I can justify my claim to\nit--a demonstration that will await us later. Suffice it just here that\nI find the latent historic clue in my hand again with the easy recall of\nmy prompt grasp of such a chance to make a story about art. _There_ was\nmy subject this time--all mature with having long waited, and with the\nblest dignity that my original perception of its value was quite lost in\nthe mists of youth. I must long have carried in my head the notion of a\nyoung man who should amid difficulty--the difficulties being the\nstory--have abandoned \"public life\" for the zealous pursuit of some\nsupposedly minor craft; just as, evidently, there had hovered before me\nsome possible picture (but all comic and ironic) of one of the most\nsalient London \"social\" passions, the unappeasable curiosity for the\nthings of the theatre; for every one of them, that is, except the drama\nitself, and for the \"personality\" of the performer (almost any performer\nquite sufficiently serving) in particular. This latter, verily, had\nstruck me as an aspect appealing mainly to satiric treatment; the only\nadequate or effective treatment, I had again and again felt, for most of\nthe distinctively social aspects of London: the general artlessly\nhistrionised air of things caused so many examples to spring from behind\nany hedge. What came up, however, at once, for my own stretched canvas,\nwas that it would have to be ample, give me really space to turn round,\nand that a single illustrative case might easily be meagre fare. The\nyoung man who should \"chuck\" admired politics, and of course some other\nadmired object with them, would be all very well; but he wouldn't be\nenough--therefore what should one say to some other young man who would\nchuck something and somebody else, admired in their way too?\n\nThere need never, at the worst, be any difficulty about the things\nadvantageously chuckable for art; the question is all but of choosing\nthem in the heap. Yet were I to represent a struggle--an interesting\none, indispensably--with the passions of the theatre (as a profession,\nor at least as an absorption) I should have to place the theatre in\nanother light than the satiric. This, however, would by good luck be\nperfectly possible too--without a sacrifice of truth; and I should\ndoubtless even be able to make my theatric case as important as I might\ndesire it. It seemed clear that I needed big cases--small ones would\npractically give my central idea away; and I make out now my still\nlabouring under the illusion that the case of the sacrifice for art\n_can_ ever be, with truth, with taste, with discretion involved,\napparently and showily \"big.\" I daresay it glimmered upon me even then\nthat the very sharpest difficulty of the victim of the conflict I should\nseek to represent, and the very highest interest of his predicament,\ndwell deep in the fact that his repudiation of the great obvious, great\nmoral or functional or useful character, shall just have to consent to\nresemble a surrender for absolutely nothing. Those characters are all\nlarge and expansive, seated and established and endowed; whereas the\nmost charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade\nabroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to\nfalsify and vulgarise it; that as a preference attended with the honours\nof publicity it is indeed nowhere; that in fact, under the rule of its\nsincerity, its only honours are those of contradiction, concentration\nand a seemingly deplorable indifference to everything but itself.\nNothing can well figure as less \"big,\" in an honest thesis, than a\nmarked instance of somebody's willingness to pass mainly for an ass. Of\nthese things I must, I say, have been in strictness aware; what I\nperhaps failed of was to note that if a certain romantic glamour (even\nthat of mere eccentricity or of a fine perversity) may be flung over the\nact of exchange of a \"career\" for the esthetic life in general, the\nprose and the modesty of the matter yet come in with any exhibition of\nthe particular branch of esthetics selected. Then it is that the\nattitude of hero or heroine may look too much--for the romantic\neffect--like a low crouching over proved trifles. Art indeed has in our\nday taken on so many honours and emoluments that the recognition of its\nimportance is more than a custom, has become on occasion almost a fury:\nthe line is drawn--especially in the English world--only at the\nimportance of heeding what it may mean.\n\nThe more I turn my pieces over, at any rate, the more I now see I must\nhave found in them, and I remember how, once well in presence of my\nthree typical examples, my fear of too ample a canvas quite dropped. The\nonly question was that if I had marked my political case, from so far\nback, for \"a story by itself,\" and then marked my theatrical case for\nanother, the joining together of these interests, originally seen as\nseparate, might, all disgracefully, betray the seam, show for mechanical\nand superficial. A story was a story, a picture a picture, and I had a\nmortal horror of two stories, two pictures, in one. The reason of this\nwas the clearest--my subject was immediately, under that disadvantage,\nso cheated of its indispensable centre as to become of no more use for\nexpressing a main intention than a wheel without a hub is of use for\nmoving a cart. It was a fact, apparently, that one _had_ on occasion\nseen two pictures in one; were there not for instance certain sublime\nTintorettos at Venice, a measureless Crucifixion in especial, which\nshowed without loss of authority half-a-dozen actions separately taking\nplace? Yes, that might be, but there had surely been nevertheless a\nmighty pictorial fusion, so that the virtue of composition had somehow\nthereby come all mysteriously to its own. Of course the affair would be\nsimple enough if composition could be kept out of the question; yet by\nwhat art or process, what bars and bolts, what unmuzzled dogs and\npointed guns, perform that feat? I had to know myself utterly inapt for\nany such valour and recognise that, to make it possible, sundry things\nshould have begun for me much further back than I had felt them even in\ntheir dawn. A picture without composition slights its most precious\nchance for beauty, and is, moreover, not composed at all unless the\npainter knows _how_ that principle of health and safety, working as an\nabsolutely premeditated art, has prevailed. There may in its absence be\nlife, incontestably, as _The Newcomes_ has life, as _Les Trois\nMousquetaires_, as Tolstoi's _Peace and War_, have it; but what do such\nlarge, loose, baggy monsters, with their queer elements of the\naccidental and the arbitrary, artistically _mean_? We have heard it\nmaintained, we well remember, that such things are \"superior to art\";\nbut we understand least of all what _that_ may mean, and we look in vain\nfor the artist, the divine explanatory genius, who will come to our aid\nand tell us. There is life and life, and as waste is only life\nsacrificed and thereby prevented from \"counting,\" I delight in a\ndeep-breathing economy and an organic form. My business was accordingly\nto \"go in\" for complete pictorial fusion, some such common interest\nbetween my two first notions as would, in spite of their birth under\nquite different stars, do them no violence at all.\n\nI recall with this confirmed infatuation of retrospect that through the\nmild perceptions I here glance at there struck for _The Tragic Muse_ the\nfirst hour of a season of no small subjective felicity; lighted mainly,\nI seem to see, by a wide west window that, high aloft, looked over near\nand far London sunsets, a half-grey, half-flushed expanse of London\nlife. The production of the thing, which yet took a good many months,\nlives for me again all contemporaneously in that full projection, upon\nmy very table, of the good fog-filtered Kensington mornings; which had a\nway indeed of seeing the sunset in and which at the very last are merged\nto memory in a different and a sharper pressure, that of an hotel\nbedroom in Paris during the autumn of 1889, with the Exposition du\nCentenaire about to end--and my long story, through the usual\ndifficulties, as well. The usual difficulties--and I fairly cherish the\nrecord as some adventurer in another line may hug the sense of his\ninveterate habit of just saving in time the neck he ever\nundiscourageably risks--were those bequeathed as a particular vice of\nthe artistic spirit, against which vigilance had been destined from the\nfirst to exert itself in vain, and the effect of which was that again\nand again, perversely, incurably, the centre of my structure would\ninsist on placing itself _not_, so to speak, in the middle. It mattered\nlittle that the reader with the idea or the suspicion of a structural\ncentre is the rarest of friends and of critics--a bird, it would seem,\nas merely fabled as the phoenix: the terminational terror was none the\nless certain to break in and my work threaten to masquerade for me as an\nactive figure condemned to the disgrace of legs too short, ever so much\ntoo short, for its body. I urge myself to the candid confession that in\nvery few of my productions, to my eye, _has_ the organic centre\nsucceeded in getting into proper position.\n\nTime after time, then, has the precious waistband or girdle, studded and\nbuckled and placed for brave outward show, practically worked itself,\nand in spite of desperate remonstrance, or in other words essential\ncounterplotting, to a point perilously near the knees--perilously I mean\nfor the freedom of these parts. In several of my compositions this\ndisplacement has so succeeded, at the crisis, in defying and resisting\nme, has appeared so fraught with probable dishonour, that I still turn\nupon them, in spite of the greater or less success of final\ndissimulation, a rueful and wondering eye. These productions have in\nfact, if I may be so bold about it, specious and spurious centres\naltogether, to make up for the failure of the true. As to which in my\nlist they are, however, that is another business, not on any terms to be\nmade known. Such at least would seem my resolution so far as I have\nthus proceeded. Of any attention ever arrested by the pages forming the\nobject of this reference that rigour of discrimination has wholly and\nconsistently failed, I gather, to constitute a part. In which fact there\nis perhaps after all a rough justice--since the infirmity I speak of,\nfor example, has been always but the direct and immediate fruit of a\npositive excess of foresight, the overdone desire to provide for future\nneed and lay up heavenly treasure against the demands of my climax. If\nthe art of the drama, as a great French master of it has said, is above\nall the art of preparations, that is true only to a less extent of the\nart of the novel, and true exactly in the degree in which the art of the\nparticular novel comes near that of the drama. The first half of a\nfiction insists ever on figuring to me as the stage or theatre for the\nsecond half, and I have in general given so much space to making the\ntheatre propitious that my halves have too often proved strangely\nunequal. Thereby has arisen with grim regularity the question of\nartfully, of consummately masking the fault and conferring on the false\nquantity the brave appearance of the true.\n\nBut I am far from pretending that these desperations of ingenuity have\nnot--as through seeming _most_ of the very essence of the problem--their\nexasperated charm; so far from it that my particular supreme predicament\nin the Paris hotel, after an undue primary leakage of time, no doubt,\nover at the great river-spanning museum of the Champ de Mars and the\nTrocadero, fairly takes on to me now the tender grace of a day that is\ndead. Re-reading the last chapters of _The Tragic Muse_ I catch again\nthe very odour of Paris, which comes up in the rich rumble of the Rue de\nla Paix--with which my room itself, for that matter, seems\nimpregnated--and which hangs for reminiscence about the embarrassed\neffort to \"finish,\" not ignobly, within my already exceeded limits; an\neffort prolonged each day to those late afternoon hours during which the\ntone of the terrible city seemed to deepen about one to an effect\nstrangely composed at once of the auspicious and the fatal. The \"plot\"\nof Paris thickened at such hours beyond any other plot in the world, I\nthink; but there one sat meanwhile with another, on one's hands,\nabsolutely requiring precedence. Not the least imperative of one's\nconditions was thus that one should have really, should have finely and\n(given one's scale) concisely treated one's subject, in spite of there\nbeing so much of the confounded irreducible quantity still to treat. If\nI spoke just now, however, of the \"exasperated\" charm of supreme\ndifficulty, that is because the challenge of economic representation so\neasily becomes, in any of the arts, intensely interesting to meet. To\nput all that is possible of one's idea into a form and compass that will\ncontain and express it only by delicate adjustments and an exquisite\nchemistry, so that there will at the end be neither a drop of one's\nliquor left nor a hair's breadth of the rim of one's glass to\nspare--every artist will remember how often that sort of necessity has\ncarried with it its particular inspiration. Therein lies the secret of\nthe appeal, to his mind, of the successfully _foreshortened_ thing,\nwhere representation is arrived at, as I have already elsewhere had\noccasion to urge, not by the addition of items (a light that has for its\nattendant shadow a possible dryness) but by the art of figuring\nsynthetically, a compactness into which the imagination may cut thick,\nas into the rich density of wedding-cake. The moral of all which indeed,\nI fear, is, perhaps too trivially, but that the \"thick,\" the false, the\ndissembling second half of the work before me, associated throughout\nwith the effort to weight my dramatic values as heavily as might be,\nsince they had to be so few, presents that effort as at the very last a\nquite convulsive, yet in its way highly agreeable, spasm. Of such mild\nprodigies is the \"history\" of any specific creative effort composed!\n\nBut I have got too much out of the \"old\" Kensington light of twenty\nyears ago--a lingering oblique ray of which, to-day surely quite\nextinct, played for a benediction over my canvas. From the moment I made\nout, at my high-perched west window, my lucky title, that is from the\nmoment Miriam Rooth herself had given it me, so this young woman had\ngiven me with it her own position in the book, and so that in turn had\ngiven me my precious unity, to which no more than Miriam was either Nick\nDormer or Peter Sherringham to be sacrificed. Much of the interest of\nthe matter was immediately, therefore, in working out the detail of that\nunity and--always entrancing range of questions--the order, the reason,\nthe relation, of presented aspects. With three _general_ aspects, that\nof Miriam's case, that of Nick's and that of Sherringham's, there was\nwork in plenty cut out; since happy as it might be to say, \"My several\nactions beautifully become one,\" the point of the affair would be in\n_showing_ them beautifully become so--without which showing foul failure\nhovered and pounced. Well, the pleasure of handling an action (or,\notherwise expressed, of a \"story\") is at the worst, for a storyteller,\nimmense, and the interest of such a question as for example keeping Nick\nDormer's story his and yet making it also and all effectively in a large\npart Peter Sherringham's, of keeping Sherringham's his and yet making it\nin its high degree his kinsman's too, and Miriam Rooth's into the\nbargain; just as Miriam Rooth's is by the same token quite operatively\nhis and Nick's, and just as that of each of the young men, by an equal\nlogic, is very contributively hers--the interest of such a question, I\nsay, is ever so considerably the interest of the system on which the\nwhole thing is done. I see to-day that it was but half a system to say,\n\"Oh Miriam, a case herself, is the _link_ between the two other cases\";\nthat device was to ask for as much help as it gave and to require a good\ndeal more application than it announced on the surface. The sense of a\nsystem saves the painter from the baseness of the _arbitrary_ stroke,\nthe touch without its reason, but as payment for that service the\nprocess insists on being kept impeccably the right one.\n\nThese are intimate truths indeed, of which the charm mainly comes out\nbut on experiment and in practice; yet I like to have it well before me\nhere that, after all, _The Tragic Muse_ makes it not easy to say which\nof the situations concerned in it predominates and rules. What has\nbecome in that imperfect order, accordingly, of the famous centre of\none's subject? It is surely not in Nick's consciousness--since why, if\nit be, are we treated to such an intolerable dose of Sherringham's? It\ncan't be in Sherringham's--we have for that altogether an excess of\nNick's. How, on the other hand, can it be in Miriam's, given that we\nhave no direct exhibition of hers whatever, that we get at it all\ninferentially and inductively, seeing it only through a more or less\nbewildered interpretation of it by others. The emphasis is all on an\nabsolutely objective Miriam, and, this affirmed, how--with such an\namount of exposed subjectivity all round her--can so dense a medium be a\ncentre? Such questions as those go straight--thanks to which they are, I\nprofess, delightful; going straight they are of the sort that makes\nanswers possible. Miriam _is_ central then to analysis, in spite of\nbeing objective; central in virtue of the fact that the whole thing has\nvisibly, from the first, to get itself done in dramatic, or at least in\nscenic conditions--though scenic conditions which are as near an\napproach to the dramatic as the novel may permit itself and which have\nthis in common with the latter, that they move in the light of\n_alternation_. This imposes a consistency other than that of the novel\nat its loosest, and, for one's subject, a different view and a different\nplacing of the centre. The charm of the scenic consistency, the\nconsistency of the multiplication of _aspects_, that of making them\namusingly various, had haunted the author of _The Tragic Muse_ from far\nback, and he was in due course to yield to it all luxuriously, too\nluxuriously perhaps, in _The Awkward Age_, as will doubtless with the\nextension of these remarks be complacently shown.\n\nTo put himself at any rate as much as possible under the protection of\nit had been ever his practice (he had notably done so in _The Princess\nCasamassima_, so frankly panoramic and processional); and in what case\ncould this protection have had more price than in the one before us? No\ncharacter in a play (any play not a mere monologue) has, for the right\nexpression of the thing, a _usurping_ consciousness; the consciousness\nof others is exhibited exactly in the same way as that of the \"hero\";\nthe prodigious consciousness of Hamlet, the most capacious and most\ncrowded, the moral presence the most asserted, in the whole range of\nfiction, only takes its turn with that of the other agents of the story,\nno matter how occasional these may be. It is left, in other words, to\nanswer for itself equally with theirs: wherefore (by a parity of\nreasoning if not of example) Miriam's might without inconsequence be\nplaced on the same footing; and all in spite of the fact that the \"moral\npresence\" of each of the men most importantly concerned with her--or\nwith the second of whom she at least is importantly concerned--_is_\nindependently answered for. The idea of the book being, as I have said,\na picture of some of the personal consequences of the art-appetite\nraised to intensity, swollen to voracity, the heavy emphasis falls where\nthe symbol of some of the complications so begotten might be made (as I\njudged, heaven forgive me!) most \"amusing\": amusing I mean in the best\nvery modern sense. I never \"go behind\" Miriam; only poor Sherringham\ngoes, a great deal, and Nick Dormer goes a little, and the author, while\nthey so waste wonderment, goes behind _them_: but none the less she is\nas thoroughly symbolic, as functional, for illustration of the idea, as\neither of them, while her image had seemed susceptible of a livelier and\n\"prettier\" concretion. I had desired for her, I remember, all manageable\nvividness--so ineluctable had it long appeared to \"do the actress,\" to\ntouch the theatre, to meet that connexion somehow or other, in any free\nplunge of the speculative fork into the contemporary social salad.\n\nThe late R. L. Stevenson was to write to me, I recall--and precisely on\nthe occasion of _The Tragic Muse_--that he was at a loss to conceive how\none could find an interest in anything so vulgar or pretend to gather\nfruit in so scrubby an orchard; but the view of a creature of the stage,\nthe view of the \"histrionic temperament,\" as suggestive much less,\nverily, in respect to the poor stage _per se_ than in respect to \"art\"\nat large, affected me in spite of that as justly tenable. An objection\nof a more pointed order was forced upon me by an acute friend later on\nand in another connexion: the challenge of one's right, in any pretended\nshow of social realities, to attach to the image of a \"public\ncharacter,\" a supposed particular celebrity, a range of interest, of\nintrinsic distinction, greater than any such display of importance on\nthe part of eminent members of the class as we see them about us. There\n_was_ a nice point if one would--yet only nice enough, after all, to be\neasily amusing. We shall deal with it later on, however, in a more\nurgent connexion. What would have worried me much more had it dawned\nearlier is the light lately thrown by that admirable writer M. Anatole\nFrance on the question of any animated view of the histrionic\ntemperament--a light that may well dazzle to distress any ingenuous\nworker in the same field. In those parts of his brief but inimitable\n_Histoire Comique_ on which he is most to be congratulated--for there\nare some that prompt to reserves--he has \"done the actress,\" as well as\nthe actor, done above all the mountebank, the mummer and the _cabotin_,\nand mixed them up with the queer theatric air, in a manner that\npractically warns all other hands off the material for ever. At the same\ntime I think I saw Miriam, and without a sacrifice of truth, that is of\nthe particular glow of verisimilitude I wished her most to benefit by,\nin a complexity of relations finer than any that appear possible for the\ngentry of M. Anatole France.\n\nHer relation to Nick Dormer, for instance, was intended as a superior\ninterest--that of being (while perfectly sincere, sincere for _her_, and\ntherefore perfectly consonant with her impulse perpetually to perform\nand with her success in performing) the result of a touched imagination,\na touched pride for \"art,\" as well as of the charm cast on other\nsensibilities still. Dormer's relation to herself is a different matter,\nof which more presently; but the sympathy she, poor young woman, very\ngenerously and intelligently offers him where most people have so\nstinted it, is disclosed largely at the cost of her egotism and her\npersonal pretensions, even though in fact determined by her sense of\ntheir together, Nick and she, postponing the \"world\" to their conception\nof other and finer decencies. Nick can't on the whole see--for I have\nrepresented him as in his day quite sufficiently troubled and\nanxious--why he should condemn to ugly feebleness his most prized\nfaculty (most prized, at least, by himself) even in order to keep his\nseat in Parliament, to inherit Mr. Carteret's blessing and money, to\ngratify his mother and carry out the mission of his father, to marry\nJulia Dallow in fine, a beautiful imperative woman with a great many\nthousands a year. It all comes back in the last analysis to the\nindividual vision of decency, the critical as well as the passionate\njudgement of it under sharp stress; and Nick's vision and judgement, all\non the esthetic ground, have beautifully coincided, to Miriam's\nimagination, with a now fully marked, an inspired and impenitent, choice\nof her own: so that, other considerations powerfully aiding indeed, she\nis ready to see their interest all splendidly as one. She is in the\nuplifted state to which sacrifices and submissions loom large, but loom\nso just because they must write sympathy, write passion, large. Her\nmeasure of what she would be capable of for him--capable, that is, of\n_not_ asking of him--will depend on what he shall ask of _her_, but she\nhas no fear of not being able to satisfy him, even to the point of\n\"chucking\" for him, if need be, that artistic identity of her own which\nshe has begun to build up. It will all be to the glory, therefore, of\ntheir common infatuation with \"art\": she will doubtless be no less\nwilling to serve his than she was eager to serve her own, purged now of\nthe too great shrillness.\n\nThis puts her quite on a different level from that of the vivid monsters\nof M. France, whose artistic identity is the last thing _they_ wish to\nchuck--their only dismissal is of all material and social over-draping.\nNick Dormer in point of fact asks of Miriam nothing but that she shall\nremain \"awfully interesting to paint\"; but that is _his_ relation,\nwhich, as I say, is quite a matter by itself. He at any rate, luckily\nfor both of them it may be, doesn't put her to the test: he is so busy\nwith his own case, busy with testing himself and feeling his reality.\nHe has seen himself as giving up precious things for an object, and that\nobject has somehow not been the young woman in question, nor anything\nvery nearly like her. She, on the other hand, has asked everything of\nPeter Sherringham, who has asked everything of _her_; and it is in so\ndoing that she has really most testified for art and invited him to\ntestify. With his professed interest in the theatre--one of those deep\nsubjections that, in men of \"taste,\" the Com\u00c3\u00a9die Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise used in old\ndays to conspire for and some such odd and affecting examples of which\nwere to be noted--he yet offers her his hand and an introduction to the\nvery best society if she will leave the stage. The power--and her having\nthe sense of the power--to \"shine\" in the world is his highest measure\nof her, the test applied by him to her beautiful human value; just as\nthe manner in which she turns on him is the application of her own\nstandard and touchstone. She is perfectly sure of her own; for--if there\nwere nothing else, and there is much--she has tasted blood, so to speak,\nin the form of her so prompt and auspicious success with the public,\nleaving all probations behind (the whole of which, as the book gives it,\nis too rapid and sudden, though inevitably so: processes, periods,\nintervals, stages, degrees, connexions, may be easily enough and barely\nenough named, may be unconvincingly stated, in fiction, to the deep\ndiscredit of the writer, but it remains the very deuce to _represent_\nthem, especially represent them under strong compression and in brief\nand subordinate terms; and this even though the novelist who doesn't\nrepresent, and represent \"all the time,\" is lost, exactly as much lost\nas the painter who, at his work and given his intention, doesn't paint\n\"all the time\").\n\nTurn upon her friend at any rate Miriam does; and one of my main points\nis missed if it fails to appear that she does so with absolute\nsincerity and with the cold passion of the high critic who knows, on\nsight of them together, the more or less dazzling false from the\ncomparatively grey-coloured true. Sherringham's whole profession has\nbeen that he rejoices in her as she is, and that the theatre, the\norganised theatre, will be, as Matthew Arnold was in those very days\npronouncing it, irresistible; and it is the promptness with which he\nsheds his pretended faith as soon as it feels in the air the breath of\nreality, as soon as it asks of him a proof or a sacrifice, it is this\nthat excites her doubtless sufficiently arrogant scorn. Where is the\nvirtue of his high interest if it has verily never _been_ an interest to\nspeak of and if all it has suddenly to suggest is that, in face of a\nserious call, it shall be unblushingly relinquished? If he and she\ntogether, and her great field and future, and the whole cause they had\narmed and declared for, have not been serious things they have been base\nmake-believes and trivialities--which is what in fact the homage of\nsociety to art always turns out so soon as art presumes not to be vulgar\nand futile. It is immensely the fashion and immensely edifying to listen\nto, this homage, while it confines its attention to vanities and frauds;\nbut it knows only terror, feels only horror, the moment that, instead of\nmaking all the concessions, art proceeds to ask for a few. Miriam is\nnothing if not strenuous, and evidently nothing if not \"cheeky,\" where\nSherringham is concerned at least: these, in the all-egotistical\nexhibition to which she is condemned, are the very elements of her\nfigure and the very colours of her portrait. But she is mild and\ninconsequent for Nick Dormer (who demands of her so little); as if\ngravely and pityingly embracing the truth that _his_ sacrifice, on the\nright side, is probably to have very little of her sort of recompense. I\nmust have had it well before me that she was all aware of the small\nstrain a great sacrifice to Nick would cost her--by reason of the strong\neffect on her of his own superior logic, in which the very intensity of\nconcentration was so to find its account.\n\nIf the man, however, who holds her personally dear yet holds her\nextremely personal message to the world cheap, so the man capable of a\nconsistency and, as she regards the matter, of an honesty so much higher\nthan Sherringham's, virtually cares, \"really\" cares, no straw for his\nfellow-struggler. If Nick Dormer attracts and all-indifferently holds\nher it is because, like herself and unlike Peter, he puts \"art\" first;\nbut the most he thus does for her in the event is to let her see how she\nmay enjoy, in intimacy, the rigour it has taught him and which he\ncultivates at her expense. This is the situation in which we leave her,\nthough there would be more still to be said about the difference for her\nof the two relations--that to each of the men--could I fondly suppose as\nmuch of the interest of the book \"left over\" for the reader as for\nmyself. Sherringham, for instance, offers Miriam marriage, ever so\n\"handsomely\"; but if nothing might lead me on further than the question\nof what it would have been open to us--us novelists, especially in the\nold days--to show, \"serially,\" a young man in Nick Dormer's quite\ndifferent position as offering or a young woman in Miriam's as taking,\nso for that very reason such an excursion is forbidden me. The trade of\nthe stage-player, and above all of the actress, must have so many\ndetestable sides for the person exercising it that we scarce imagine a\nfull surrender to it without a full surrender, not less, to every\nimmediate compensation, to every freedom and the largest ease within\nreach: which presentment of the possible case for Miriam would yet have\nbeen condemned--and on grounds both various and interesting to trace--to\nremain very imperfect.\n\nI feel, moreover, that I might still, with space, abound in remarks\nabout Nick's character and Nick's crisis suggested to my present more\nreflective vision. It strikes me, alas, that he is not quite so\ninteresting as he was fondly intended to be, and this in spite of the\nmultiplication, within the picture, of his pains and penalties; so that\nwhile I turn this slight anomaly over I come upon a reason that affects\nme as singularly charming and touching and at which indeed I have\nalready glanced. Any presentation of the artist _in triumph_ must be\nflat in proportion as it really sticks to its subject--it can only\nsmuggle in relief and variety. For, to put the matter in an image, all\nwe then--in his triumph--see of the charm-compeller is the back he turns\nto us as he bends over his work. \"His\" triumph, decently, is but the\ntriumph of what he produces, and that is another affair. His romance is\nthe romance he himself projects; he eats the cake of the very rarest\nprivilege, the most luscious baked in the oven of the gods--therefore he\nmayn't \"have\" it, in the form of the privilege of the hero, at the same\ntime. The privilege of the hero--that is, of the martyr or of the\ninteresting and appealing and comparatively floundering _person_--places\nhim in quite a different category, belongs to him only as to the artist\ndeluded, diverted, frustrated or vanquished; when the \"amateur\" in him\ngains, for our admiration or compassion or whatever, all that the expert\nhas to do without. Therefore I strove in vain, I feel, to embroil and\nadorn this young man on whom a hundred ingenious touches are thus\nlavished: he has insisted in the event on looking as simple and flat as\nsome mere brass check or engraved number, the symbol and guarantee of a\nstored treasure. The better part of him is locked too much away from us,\nand the part we see has to pass for--well, what it passes for, so\nlamentedly, among his friends and relatives. No, accordingly, Nick\nDormer isn't \"the best thing in the book,\" as I judge I imagined he\nwould be, and it contains nothing better, I make out, than that\npreserved and achieved unity and quality of tone, a value in itself,\nwhich I referred to at the beginning of these remarks. What I mean by\nthis is that the interest created, and the expression of that interest,\nare things kept, as to kind, genuine and true to themselves. The appeal,\nthe fidelity to the prime motive, is, with no little art, strained clear\n(even as silver is polished) in a degree answering--at least by\nintention--to the air of beauty. There is an awkwardness again in having\nthus belatedly to point such features out; but in that wrought\nappearance of animation and harmony, that effect of free movement and\nyet of recurrent and insistent reference, _The Tragic Muse_ has struck\nme again as conscious of a bright advantage.\n\nHENRY JAMES.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe people of France have made it no secret that those of England, as a\ngeneral thing, are to their perception an inexpressive and speechless\nrace, perpendicular and unsociable, unaddicted to enriching any bareness\nof contact with verbal or other embroidery. This view might have derived\nencouragement, a few years ago, in Paris, from the manner in which four\npersons sat together in silence, one fine day about noon, in the garden,\nas it is called, of the Palais de l'Industrie--the central court of the\ngreat glazed bazaar where, among plants and parterres, gravelled walks\nand thin fountains, are ranged the figures and groups, the monuments and\nbusts, which form in the annual exhibition of the Salon the department\nof statuary. The spirit of observation is naturally high at the Salon,\nquickened by a thousand artful or artless appeals, but it need have put\nforth no great intensity to take in the characters I mention. As a\nsolicitation of the eye on definite grounds these visitors too\nconstituted a successful plastic fact; and even the most superficial\nobserver would have marked them as products of an insular neighbourhood,\nrepresentatives of that tweed-and-waterproof class with which, on the\nrecurrent occasions when the English turn out for a holiday--Christmas\nand Easter, Whitsuntide and the autumn--Paris besprinkles itself at a\nnight's notice. They had about them the indefinable professional look\nof the British traveller abroad; the air of preparation for exposure,\nmaterial and moral, which is so oddly combined with the serene\nrevelation of security and of persistence, and which excites, according\nto individual susceptibility, the ire or the admiration of foreign\ncommunities. They were the more unmistakable as they presented mainly\nthe happier aspects of the energetic race to which they had the honour\nto belong. The fresh diffused light of the Salon made them clear and\nimportant; they were finished creations, in their way, and, ranged there\nmotionless on their green bench, were almost as much on exhibition as if\nthey had been hung on the line.\n\nThree ladies and a young man, they were obviously a family--a mother,\ntwo daughters and a son; a circumstance which had the effect at once of\nmaking each member of the group doubly typical and of helping to account\nfor their fine taciturnity. They were not, with each other, on terms of\nceremony, and also were probably fatigued with their course among the\npictures, the rooms on the upper floor. Their attitude, on the part of\nvisitors who had superior features even if they might appear to some\npassers-by to have neglected a fine opportunity for completing these\nfeatures with an expression, was after all a kind of tribute to the\nstate of exhaustion, of bewilderment, to which the genius of France is\nstill capable of reducing the proud.\n\n\"En v'l\u00c3\u00a0 des abrutis!\" more than one of their fellow-gazers might have\nbeen heard to exclaim; and certain it is that there was something\ndepressed and discouraged in this interesting group, who sat looking\nvaguely before them, not noticing the life of the place, somewhat as if\neach had a private anxiety. It might have been finely guessed, however,\nthat though on many questions they were closely united this present\nanxiety was not the same for each. If they looked grave, moreover, this\nwas doubtless partly the result of their all being dressed in such\nmourning as told of a recent bereavement. The eldest of the three ladies\nhad indeed a face of a fine austere mould which would have been moved to\ngaiety only by some force more insidious than any she was likely to\nrecognise in Paris. Cold, still, and considerably worn, it was neither\nstupid nor hard--it was firm, narrow and sharp. This competent matron,\nacquainted evidently with grief but not weakened by it, had a high\nforehead to which the quality of the skin gave a singular polish--it\nglittered even when seen at a distance; a nose which achieved a high\nfree curve; and a tendency to throw back her head and carry it well\nabove her, as if to disengage it from the possible entanglements of the\nrest of her person. If you had seen her walk you would have felt her to\ntread the earth after a fashion suggesting that in a world where she had\nlong since discovered that one couldn't have one's own way one could\nnever tell what annoying aggression might take place, so that it was\nwell, from hour to hour, to save what one could. Lady Agnes saved her\nhead, her white triangular forehead, over which her close-crinkled\nflaxen hair, reproduced in different shades in her children, made a\nlooped silken canopy like the marquee at a garden-party. Her daughters\nwere as tall as herself--that was visible even as they sat there--and\none of them, the younger evidently, altogether pretty; a straight,\nslender, grey-eyed English girl of the sort who show \"good\" figures and\nfresh complexions. The sister, who was not pretty, was also straight and\nslender and grey-eyed. But the grey in this case was not so pure, nor\nwere the straightness and the slenderness so maidenly. The brother of\nthese young ladies had taken off his hat as if he felt the air of the\nsummer day heavy in the great pavilion. He was a lean, strong,\nclear-faced youth, with a formed nose and thick light-brown hair which\nlay continuously and profusely back from his forehead, so that to smooth\nit from the brow to the neck but a single movement of the hand was\nrequired. I cannot describe him better than by saying that he was the\nsort of young Englishman who looks particularly well in strange lands\nand whose general aspect--his inches, his limbs, his friendly eyes, the\nmodulation of his voice, the cleanness of his flesh-tints and the\nfashion of his garments--excites on the part of those who encounter him\nin far countries on the ground of a common speech a delightful sympathy\nof race. This sympathy may sometimes be qualified by the seen limits of\nhis apprehension, but it almost revels as such horizons recede. We shall\nsee quickly enough how accurate a measure it might have taken of\nNicholas Dormer. There was food for suspicion perhaps in the wandering\nblankness that sat at moments in his eyes, as if he had no attention at\nall, not the least in the world, at his command; but it is no more than\njust to add without delay that this discouraging symptom was known among\nthose who liked him by the indulgent name of dreaminess. By his mother\nand sisters, for instance, his dreaminess was constantly noted. He is\nthe more welcome to the benefit of such an interpretation as there is\nalways held to be something engaging in the combination of the muscular\nand the musing, the mildness of strength.\n\nAfter some time, an interval during which these good people might have\nappeared to have come, individually, to the Palais de l'Industrie much\nless to see the works of art than to think over their domestic affairs,\nthe young man, rousing himself from his reverie, addressed one of the\ngirls.\n\n\"I say, Biddy, why should we sit moping here all day? Come and take a\nturn about with me.\"\n\nHis younger sister, while he got up, leaned forward a little, looking\nround her, but she gave for the moment no further sign of complying with\nhis invitation.\n\n\"Where shall we find you, then, if Peter comes?\" asked the other Miss\nDormer, making no movement at all.\n\n\"I daresay Peter won't come. He'll leave us here to cool our heels.\"\n\n\"Oh Nick dear!\" Biddy exclaimed in a small sweet voice of protest. It\nwas plainly her theory that Peter would come, and even a little her fond\nfear that she might miss him should she quit that spot.\n\n\"We shall come back in a quarter of an hour. Really I must look at these\nthings,\" Nick declared, turning his face to a marble group which stood\nnear them on the right--a man with the skin of a beast round his loins,\ntussling with a naked woman in some primitive effort of courtship or\ncapture.\n\nLady Agnes followed the direction of her son's eyes and then observed:\n\"Everything seems very dreadful. I should think Biddy had better sit\nstill. Hasn't she seen enough horrors up above?\"\n\n\"I daresay that if Peter comes Julia'll be with him,\" the elder girl\nremarked irrelevantly.\n\n\"Well then he can take Julia about. That will be more proper,\" said Lady\nAgnes.\n\n\"Mother dear, she doesn't care a rap about art. It's a fearful bore\nlooking at fine things with Julia,\" Nick returned.\n\n\"Won't you go with him, Grace?\"--and Biddy appealed to her sister.\n\n\"I think she has awfully good taste!\" Grace exclaimed, not answering\nthis inquiry.\n\n\"_Don't_ say nasty things about her!\" Lady Agnes broke out solemnly to\nher son after resting her eyes on him a moment with an air of reluctant\nreprobation.\n\n\"I say nothing but what she'd say herself,\" the young man urged. \"About\nsome things she has very good taste, but about this kind of thing she\nhas no taste at all.\"\n\n\"That's better, I think,\" said Lady Agnes, turning her eyes again to the\n\"kind of thing\" her son appeared to designate.\n\n\"She's awfully clever--awfully!\" Grace went on with decision.\n\n\"Awfully, awfully!\" her brother repeated, standing in front of her and\nsmiling down at her.\n\n\"You are nasty, Nick. You know you are,\" said the young lady, but more\nin sorrow than in anger.\n\nBiddy got up at this, as if the accusatory tone prompted her to place\nherself generously at his side. \"Mightn't you go and order lunch--in\nthat place, you know?\" she asked of her mother. \"Then we'd come back\nwhen it was ready.\"\n\n\"My dear child, I can't order lunch,\" Lady Agnes replied with a cold\nimpatience which seemed to intimate that she had problems far more\nimportant than those of victualling to contend with.\n\n\"Then perhaps Peter will if he comes. I'm sure he's up in everything of\nthat sort.\"\n\n\"Oh hang Peter!\" Nick exclaimed. \"Leave him out of account, and _do_\norder lunch, mother; but not cold beef and pickles.\"\n\n\"I must say--about _him_--you're not nice,\" Biddy ventured to remark to\nher brother, hesitating and even blushing a little.\n\n\"You make up for it, my dear,\" the young man answered, giving her\nchin--a very charming, rotund, little chin--a friendly whisk with his\nforefinger.\n\n\"I can't imagine what you've got against him,\" her ladyship said\ngravely.\n\n\"Dear mother, it's disappointed fondness,\" Nick argued. \"They won't\nanswer one's notes; they won't let one know where they are nor what to\nexpect. 'Hell has no fury like a woman scorned'; nor like a man\neither.\"\n\n\"Peter has such a tremendous lot to do--it's a very busy time at the\nembassy; there are sure to be reasons,\" Biddy explained with her pretty\neyes.\n\n\"Reasons enough, no doubt!\" said Lady Agnes--who accompanied these words\nwith an ambiguous sigh, however, as if in Paris even the best reasons\nwould naturally be bad ones.\n\n\"Doesn't Julia write to you, doesn't she answer you the very day?\" Grace\nasked, looking at Nick as if she were the bold one.\n\nHe waited, returning her glance with a certain severity. \"What do you\nknow about my correspondence? No doubt I ask too much,\" he went on; \"I'm\nso attached to them. Dear old Peter, dear old Julia!\"\n\n\"She's younger than you, my dear!\" cried the elder girl, still resolute.\n\n\"Yes, nineteen days.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you know her birthday.\"\n\n\"She knows yours; she always gives you something,\" Lady Agnes reminded\nher son.\n\n\"Her taste is good _then_, isn't it, Nick?\" Grace Dormer continued.\n\n\"She makes charming presents; but, dear mother, it isn't _her_ taste.\nIt's her husband's.\"\n\n\"How her husband's?\"\n\n\"The beautiful objects of which she disposes so freely are the things he\ncollected for years laboriously, devotedly, poor man!\"\n\n\"She disposes of them to you, but not to others,\" said Lady Agnes. \"But\nthat's all right,\" she added, as if this might have been taken for a\ncomplaint of the limitations of Julia's bounty. \"She has to select among\nso many, and that's a proof of taste,\" her ladyship pursued.\n\n\"You can't say she doesn't choose lovely ones,\" Grace remarked to her\nbrother in a tone of some triumph.\n\n\"My dear, they're all lovely. George Dallow's judgement was so sure, he\nwas incapable of making a mistake,\" Nicholas Dormer returned.\n\n\"I don't see how you can talk of him, he was dreadful,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"My dear, if he was good enough for Julia to marry he's good enough for\nus to talk of.\"\n\n\"She did him a very great honour.\"\n\n\"I daresay, but he was not unworthy of it. No such enlightened\ncollection of beautiful objects has been made in England in our time.\"\n\n\"You think too much of beautiful objects!\" Lady Agnes sighed.\n\n\"I thought you were just now lamenting that I think too little.\"\n\n\"It's very nice--his having left Julia so well off,\" Biddy interposed\nsoothingly, as if she foresaw a tangle.\n\n\"He treated her _en grand seigneur_, absolutely,\" Nick went on.\n\n\"He used to look greasy, all the same\"--Grace bore on it with a dull\nweight. \"His name ought to have been Tallow.\"\n\n\"You're not saying what Julia would like, if that's what you are trying\nto say,\" her brother observed.\n\n\"Don't be vulgar, Grace,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"I know Peter Sherringham's birthday!\" Biddy broke out innocently, as a\npacific diversion. She had passed her hand into Nick's arm, to signify\nher readiness to go with him, while she scanned the remoter reaches of\nthe garden as if it had occurred to her that to direct their steps in\nsome such sense might after all be the shorter way to get at Peter.\n\n\"He's too much older than you, my dear,\" Grace answered without\nencouragement.\n\n\"That's why I've noticed it--he's thirty-four. Do you call that too\nold? I don't care for slobbering infants!\" Biddy cried.\n\n\"Don't be vulgar,\" Lady Agnes enjoined again.\n\n\"Come, Bid, we'll go and be vulgar together; for that's what we are, I'm\nafraid,\" her brother said to her. \"We'll go and look at all these low\nworks of art.\"\n\n\"Do you really think it's necessary to the child's development?\" Lady\nAgnes demanded as the pair turned away. And then while her son, struck\nas by a challenge, paused, lingering a moment with his little sister on\nhis arm: \"What we've been through this morning in this place, and what\nyou've paraded before our eyes--the murders, the tortures, all kinds of\ndisease and indecency!\"\n\nNick looked at his mother as if this sudden protest surprised him, but\nas if also there were lurking explanations of it which he quickly\nguessed. Her resentment had the effect not so much of animating her cold\nface as of making it colder, less expressive, though visibly prouder.\n\"Ah dear mother, don't do the British matron!\" he replied\ngood-humouredly.\n\n\"British matron's soon said! I don't know what they're coming to.\"\n\n\"How odd that you should have been struck only with the disagreeable\nthings when, for myself, I've felt it to be most interesting, the most\nsuggestive morning I've passed for ever so many months!\"\n\n\"Oh Nick, Nick!\" Lady Agnes cried with a strange depth of feeling.\n\n\"I like them better in London--they're much less unpleasant,\" said Grace\nDormer.\n\n\"They're things you can look at,\" her ladyship went on. \"We certainly\nmake the better show.\"\n\n\"The subject doesn't matter, it's the treatment, the treatment!\" Biddy\nprotested in a voice like the tinkle of a silver bell.\n\n\"Poor little Bid!\"--her brother broke into a laugh.\n\n\"How can I learn to model, mamma dear, if I don't look at things and if\nI don't study them?\" the girl continued.\n\nThis question passed unheeded, and Nicholas Dormer said to his mother,\nmore seriously, but with a certain kind explicitness, as if he could\nmake a particular allowance: \"This place is an immense stimulus to me;\nit refreshes me, excites me--it's such an exhibition of artistic life.\nIt's full of ideas, full of refinements; it gives one such an impression\nof artistic experience. They try everything, they feel everything. While\nyou were looking at the murders, apparently, I observed an immense deal\nof curious and interesting work. There are too many of them, poor\ndevils; so many who must make their way, who must attract attention.\nSome of them can only _taper fort_, stand on their heads, turn\nsomersaults or commit deeds of violence, to make people notice them.\nAfter that, no doubt, a good many will be quieter. But I don't know;\nto-day I'm in an appreciative mood--I feel indulgent even to them: they\ngive me an impression of intelligence, of eager observation. All art is\none--remember that, Biddy dear,\" the young man continued, smiling down\nfrom his height. \"It's the same great many-headed effort, and any ground\nthat's gained by an individual, any spark that's struck in any province,\nis of use and of suggestion to all the others. We're all in the same\nboat.\"\n\n\"'We,' do you say, my dear? Are you really setting up for an artist?\"\nLady Agnes asked.\n\nNick just hesitated. \"I was speaking for Biddy.\"\n\n\"But you _are_ one, Nick--you are!\" the girl cried.\n\nLady Agnes looked for an instant as if she were going to say once more\n\"Don't be vulgar!\" But she suppressed these words, had she intended\nthem, and uttered sounds, few in number and not completely articulate,\nto the effect that she hated talking about art. While her son spoke she\nhad watched him as if failing to follow; yet something in the tone of\nher exclamation hinted that she had understood him but too well.\n\n\"We're all in the same boat,\" Biddy repeated with cheerful zeal.\n\n\"Not me, if you please!\" Lady Agnes replied. \"It's horrid messy work,\nyour modelling.\"\n\n\"Ah but look at the results!\" said the girl eagerly--glancing about at\nthe monuments in the garden as if in regard even to them she were,\nthrough that unity of art her brother had just proclaimed, in some\ndegree an effective cause.\n\n\"There's a great deal being done here--a real vitality,\" Nicholas Dormer\nwent on to his mother in the same reasonable informing way. \"Some of\nthese fellows go very far.\"\n\n\"They do indeed!\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"I'm fond of young schools--like this movement in sculpture,\" Nick\ninsisted with his slightly provoking serenity.\n\n\"They're old enough to know better!\"\n\n\"Mayn't I look, mamma? It _is_ necessary to my development,\" Biddy\ndeclared.\n\n\"You may do as you like,\" said Lady Agnes with dignity.\n\n\"She ought to see good work, you know,\" the young man went on.\n\n\"I leave it to your sense of responsibility.\" This statement was\nsomewhat majestic, and for a moment evidently it tempted Nick, almost\nprovoked him, or at any rate suggested to him an occasion for some\npronouncement he had had on his mind. Apparently, however, he judged the\ntime on the whole not quite right, and his sister Grace interposed with\nthe inquiry--\n\n\"Please, mamma, are we never going to lunch?\"\n\n\"Ah mother, mother!\" the young man murmured in a troubled way, looking\ndown at her with a deep fold in his forehead.\n\nFor Lady Agnes also, as she returned his look, it seemed an occasion;\nbut with this difference that she had no hesitation in taking advantage\nof it. She was encouraged by his slight embarrassment, for ordinarily\nNick was not embarrassed. \"You used to have so _much_ sense of\nresponsibility,\" she pursued; \"but sometimes I don't know what has\nbecome of it--it seems all, _all_ gone!\"\n\n\"Ah mother, mother!\" he exclaimed again--as if there were so many things\nto say that it was impossible to choose. But now he stepped closer, bent\nover her and in spite of the publicity of their situation gave her a\nquick expressive kiss. The foreign observer whom I took for granted in\nbeginning to sketch this scene would have had to admit that the rigid\nEnglish family had after all a capacity for emotion. Grace Dormer indeed\nlooked round her to see if at this moment they were noticed. She judged\nwith satisfaction that they had escaped.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nNick Dormer walked away with Biddy, but he had not gone far before he\nstopped in front of a clever bust, where his mother, in the distance,\nsaw him playing in the air with his hand, carrying out by this gesture,\nwhich presumably was applausive, some critical remark he had made to his\nsister. Lady Agnes raised her glass to her eyes by the long handle to\nwhich rather a clanking chain was attached, perceiving that the bust\nrepresented an ugly old man with a bald head; at which her ladyship\nindefinitely sighed, though it was not apparent in what way such an\nobject could be detrimental to her daughter. Nick passed on and quickly\npaused again; this time, his mother discerned, before the marble image\nof a strange grimacing woman. Presently she lost sight of him; he\nwandered behind things, looking at them all round.\n\n\"I ought to get plenty of ideas for my modelling, oughtn't I, Nick?\" his\nsister put to him after a moment.\n\n\"Ah my poor child, what shall I say?\"\n\n\"Don't you think I've any capacity for ideas?\" the girl continued\nruefully.\n\n\"Lots of them, no doubt. But the capacity for applying them, for putting\nthem into practice--how much of that have you?\"\n\n\"How can I tell till I try?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by trying, Biddy dear?\"\n\n\"Why you know--you've seen me.\"\n\n\"Do you call that trying?\" her brother amusedly demanded.\n\n\"Ah Nick!\" she said with sensibility. But then with more spirit: \"And\nplease what do you call it?\"\n\n\"Well, this for instance is a good case.\" And her companion pointed to\nanother bust--a head of a young man in terra-cotta, at which they had\njust arrived; a modern young man to whom, with his thick neck, his\nlittle cap and his wide ring of dense curls, the artist had given the\nair of some sturdy Florentine of the time of Lorenzo.\n\nBiddy looked at the image a moment. \"Ah that's not trying; that's\nsucceeding.\"\n\n\"Not altogether; it's only trying seriously.\"\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't I be serious?\"\n\n\"Mother wouldn't like it. She has inherited the fine old superstition\nthat art's pardonable only so long as it's bad--so long as it's done at\nodd hours, for a little distraction, like a game of tennis or of whist.\nThe only thing that can justify it, the effort to carry it as far as one\ncan (which you can't do without time and singleness of purpose), she\nregards as just the dangerous, the criminal element. It's the oddest\nhind-part-before view, the drollest immorality.\"\n\n\"She doesn't want one to be professional,\" Biddy returned as if she\ncould do justice to every system.\n\n\"Better leave it alone then. There are always duffers enough.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a duffer,\" Biddy said. \"But I thought you encouraged\nme.\"\n\n\"So I did, my poor child. It was only to encourage myself.\"\n\n\"With your own work--your painting?\"\n\n\"With my futile, my ill-starred endeavours. Union is strength--so that\nwe might present a wider front, a larger surface of resistance.\"\n\nBiddy for a while said nothing and they continued their tour of\nobservation. She noticed how he passed over some things quickly, his\nfirst glance sufficing to show him if they were worth another, and then\nrecognised in a moment the figures that made some appeal. His tone\npuzzled but his certainty of eye impressed her, and she felt what a\ndifference there was yet between them--how much longer in every case she\nwould have taken to discriminate. She was aware of how little she could\njudge of the value of a thing till she had looked at it ten minutes;\nindeed modest little Biddy was compelled privately to add \"And often not\neven then.\" She was mystified, as I say--Nick was often mystifying, it\nwas his only fault--but one thing was definite: her brother had high\nability. It was the consciousness of this that made her bring out at\nlast: \"I don't so much care whether or no I please mamma, if I please\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh don't lean on me. I'm a wretched broken reed--I'm no use _really_!\"\nhe promptly admonished her.\n\n\"Do you mean you're a duffer?\" Biddy asked in alarm.\n\n\"Frightful, frightful!\"\n\n\"So that you intend to give up your work--to let it alone, as you advise\n_me_?\"\n\n\"It has never been my work, all that business, Biddy. If it had it would\nbe different. I should stick to it.\"\n\n\"And you _won't_ stick to it?\" the girl said, standing before him\nopen-eyed.\n\nHer brother looked into her eyes a moment, and she had a compunction;\nshe feared she was indiscreet and was worrying him. \"Your questions are\nmuch simpler than the elements out of which my answer should come.\"\n\n\"A great talent--what's simpler than that?\"\n\n\"One excellent thing, dear Biddy: no talent at all!\"\n\n\"Well, yours is so real you can't help it.\"\n\n\"We shall see, we shall see,\" said Nick Dormer. \"Let us go look at that\nbig group.\"\n\n\"We shall see if your talent's real?\" Biddy went on as she accompanied\nhim.\n\n\"No; we shall see if, as you say, I can't help it. What nonsense Paris\nmakes one talk!\" the young man added as they stopped in front of the\ncomposition. This was true perhaps, but not in a sense he could find\nhimself tempted to deplore. The present was far from his first visit to\nthe French capital: he had often quitted England and usually made a\npoint of \"putting in,\" as he called it, a few days there on the outward\njourney to the Continent or on the return; but at present the feelings,\nfor the most part agreeable, attendant upon a change of air and of scene\nhad been more punctual and more acute than for a long time before, and\nstronger the sense of novelty, refreshment, amusement, of the hundred\nappeals from that quarter of thought to which on the whole his attention\nwas apt most frequently, though not most confessedly, to stray. He was\nfonder of Paris than most of his countrymen, though not so fond perhaps\nas some other captivated aliens: the place had always had the virtue of\nquickening in him sensibly the life of reflexion and observation. It was\na good while since his impressions had been so favourable to the city by\nthe Seine; a good while at all events since they had ministered so to\nexcitement, to exhilaration, to ambition, even to a restlessness that\nwas not prevented from being agreeable by the excess of agitation in it.\nNick could have given the reason of this unwonted glow, but his\npreference was very much to keep it to himself. Certainly to persons not\ndeeply knowing, or at any rate not deeply curious, in relation to the\nyoung man's history the explanation might have seemed to beg the\nquestion, consisting as it did of the simple formula that he had at last\ncome to a crisis. Why a crisis--what was it and why had he not come to\nit before? The reader shall learn these things in time if he cares\nenough for them.\n\nOur young man had not in any recent year failed to see the Salon, which\nthe general voice this season pronounced not particularly good. None the\nless it was the present exhibition that, for some cause connected with\nhis \"crisis,\" made him think fast, produced that effect he had spoken of\nto his mother as a sense of artistic life. The precinct of the marbles\nand bronzes spoke to him especially to-day; the glazed garden, not\nflorally rich, with its new productions alternating with perfunctory\nplants and its queer, damp smell, partly the odour of plastic clay, of\nthe studios of sculptors, put forth the voice of old associations, of\nother visits, of companionships now ended--an insinuating eloquence\nwhich was at the same time somehow identical with the general sharp\ncontagion of Paris. There was youth in the air, and a multitudinous\nnewness, for ever reviving, and the diffusion of a hundred talents,\ningenuities, experiments. The summer clouds made shadows on the roof of\nthe great building; the white images, hard in their crudity, spotted the\nplace with provocations; the rattle of plates at the restaurant sounded\nsociable in the distance, and our young man congratulated himself more\nthan ever that he had not missed his chance. He felt how it would help\nhim to settle something. At the moment he made this reflexion his eye\nfell upon a person who appeared--just in the first glimpse--to carry out\nthe idea of help. He uttered a lively ejaculation, which, however, in\nits want of finish, Biddy failed to understand; so pertinent, so\nrelevant and congruous, was the other party to this encounter.\n\nThe girl's attention followed her brother's, resting with it on a young\nman who faced them without seeing them, engaged as he was in imparting\nto two companions his ideas about one of the works exposed to view. What\nBiddy remarked was that this young man was fair and fat and of the\nmiddle stature; he had a round face and a short beard and on his crown a\nmere reminiscence of hair, as the fact that he carried his hat in his\nhand permitted to be observed. Bridget Dormer, who was quick, placed him\nimmediately as a gentleman, but as a gentleman unlike any other\ngentleman she had ever seen. She would have taken him for very foreign\nbut that the words proceeding from his mouth reached her ear and imposed\nthemselves as a rare variety of English. It was not that a foreigner\nmight not have spoken smoothly enough, nor yet that the speech of this\nyoung man was not smooth. It had in truth a conspicuous and aggressive\nperfection, and Biddy was sure no mere learner would have ventured to\nplay such tricks with the tongue. He seemed to draw rich effects and\nwandering airs from it--to modulate and manipulate it as he would have\ndone a musical instrument. Her view of the gentleman's companions was\nless operative, save for her soon making the reflexion that they were\npeople whom in any country, from China to Peru, you would immediately\nhave taken for natives. One of them was an old lady with a shawl; that\nwas the most salient way in which she presented herself. The shawl was\nan ancient much-used fabric of embroidered cashmere, such as many ladies\nwore forty years ago in their walks abroad and such as no lady wears\nto-day. It had fallen half off the back of the wearer, but at the moment\nBiddy permitted herself to consider her she gave it a violent jerk and\nbrought it up to her shoulders again, where she continued to arrange and\nsettle it, with a good deal of jauntiness and elegance, while she\nlistened to the talk of the gentleman. Biddy guessed that this little\ntransaction took place very frequently, and was not unaware of its\ngiving the old lady a droll, factitious, faded appearance, as if she\nwere singularly out of step with the age. The other person was very much\nyounger--she might have been a daughter--and had a pale face, a low\nforehead, and thick dark hair. What she chiefly had, however, Biddy\nrapidly discovered, was a pair of largely-gazing eyes. Our young friend\nwas helped to the discovery by the accident of their resting at this\nmoment for a time--it struck Biddy as very long--on her own. Both these\nladies were clad in light, thin, scant gowns, giving an impression of\nflowered figures and odd transparencies, and in low shoes which showed a\ngreat deal of stocking and were ornamented with large rosettes. Biddy's\nslightly agitated perception travelled directly to their shoes: they\nsuggested to her vaguely that the wearers were dancers--connected\npossibly with the old-fashioned exhibition of the shawl-dance. By the\ntime she had taken in so much as this the mellifluous young man had\nperceived and addressed himself to her brother. He came on with an\noffered hand. Nick greeted him and said it was a happy chance--he was\nuncommonly glad to see him.\n\n\"I never come across you--I don't know why,\" Nick added while the two,\nsmiling, looked each other up and down like men reunited after a long\ninterval.\n\n\"Oh it seems to me there's reason enough: our paths in life are so\ndifferent.\" Nick's friend had a great deal of manner, as was evinced by\nhis fashion of saluting Biddy without knowing her.\n\n\"Different, yes, but not so different as that. Don't we both live in\nLondon, after all, and in the nineteenth century?\"\n\n\"Ah my dear Dormer, excuse me: I don't live in the nineteenth century.\n_Jamais de la vie_!\" the gentleman declared.\n\n\"Nor in London either?\"\n\n\"Yes--when I'm not at Samarcand! But surely we've diverged since the old\ndays. I adore what you burn, you burn what I adore.\" While the stranger\nspoke he looked cheerfully, hospitably, at Biddy; not because it was\nshe, she easily guessed, but because it was in his nature to desire a\nsecond auditor--a kind of sympathetic gallery. Her life was somehow\nfilled with shy people, and she immediately knew she had never\nencountered any one who seemed so to know his part and recognise his\ncues.\n\n\"How do you know what I adore?\" Nicholas Dormer asked.\n\n\"I know well enough what you used to.\"\n\n\"That's more than I do myself. There were so many things.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are many things--many, many: that's what makes life so\namusing.\"\n\n\"Do you find it amusing?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, _c'est \u00c3\u00a0 se tordre_. Don't you think so? Ah it was high\ntime I should meet you--I see. I've an idea you need me.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I think I do!\" Nick said in a tone which struck his sister\nand made her wonder still more why, if the gentleman was so important as\nthat, he didn't introduce him.\n\n\"There are many gods and this is one of their temples,\" the mysterious\npersonage went on. \"It's a house of strange idols--isn't it?--and of\nsome strange and unnatural sacrifices.\"\n\nTo Biddy as much as to her brother this remark might have been offered;\nbut the girl's eyes turned back to the ladies who for the moment had\nlost their companion. She felt irresponsive and feared she should pass\nwith this easy cosmopolite for a stiff, scared, English girl, which was\nnot the type she aimed at; but wasn't even ocular commerce overbold so\nlong as she hadn't a sign from Nick? The elder of the strange women had\nturned her back and was looking at some bronze figure, losing her shawl\nagain as she did so; but the other stood where their escort had quitted\nher, giving all her attention to his sudden sociability with others. Her\narms hung at her sides, her head was bent, her face lowered, so that she\nhad an odd appearance of raising her eyes from under her brows; and in\nthis attitude she was striking, though her air was so unconciliatory as\nalmost to seem dangerous. Did it express resentment at having been\nabandoned for another girl? Biddy, who began to be frightened--there was\na moment when the neglected creature resembled a tigress about to\nspring--was tempted to cry out that she had no wish whatever to\nappropriate the gentleman. Then she made the discovery that the young\nlady too had a manner, almost as much as her clever guide, and the rapid\ninduction that it perhaps meant no more than his. She only looked at\nBiddy from beneath her eyebrows, which were wonderfully arched, but\nthere was ever so much of a manner in the way she did it. Biddy had a\nmomentary sense of being a figure in a ballet, a dramatic ballet--a\nsubordinate motionless figure, to be dashed at to music or strangely\ncapered up to. It would be a very dramatic ballet indeed if this young\nperson were the heroine. She had magnificent hair, the girl reflected;\nand at the same moment heard Nick say to his interlocutor: \"You're not\nin London--one can't meet you there?\"\n\n\"I rove, drift, float,\" was the answer; \"my feelings direct me--if such\na life as mine may be said to have a direction. Where there's anything\nto feel I try to be there!\" the young man continued with his confiding\nlaugh.\n\n\"I should like to get hold of you,\" Nick returned.\n\n\"Well, in that case there would be no doubt the intellectual adventure.\nThose are the currents--any sort of personal relation--that govern my\ncareer.\"\n\n\"I don't want to lose you this time,\" Nick continued in a tone that\nexcited Biddy's surprise. A moment before, when his friend had said that\nhe tried to be where there was anything to feel, she had wondered how he\ncould endure him.\n\n\"Don't lose me, don't lose me!\" cried the stranger after a fashion which\naffected the girl as the highest expression of irresponsibility she had\never seen. \"After all why should you? Let us remain together unless I\ninterfere\"--and he looked, smiling and interrogative, at Biddy, who\nstill remained blank, only noting again that Nick forbore to make them\nacquainted. This was an anomaly, since he prized the gentleman so.\nStill, there could be no anomaly of Nick's that wouldn't impose itself\non his younger sister.\n\n\"Certainly, I keep you,\" he said, \"unless on my side I deprive those\nladies--!\"\n\n\"Charming women, but it's not an indissoluble union. We meet, we\ncommunicate, we part! They're going--I'm seeing them to the door. I\nshall come back.\" With this Nick's friend rejoined his companions, who\nmoved away with him, the strange fine eyes of the girl lingering on\nBiddy's brother as well as on Biddy herself as they receded.\n\n\"Who _is_ he--who _are_ they?\" Biddy instantly asked.\n\n\"He's a gentleman,\" Nick made answer--insufficiently, she thought, and\neven with a shade of hesitation. He spoke as if she might have supposed\nhe was not one, and if he was really one why didn't he introduce him?\nBut Biddy wouldn't for the world have put this question, and he now\nmoved to the nearest bench and dropped upon it as to await the other's\nreturn. No sooner, however, had his sister seated herself than he said:\n\"See here, my dear, do you think you had better stay?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to go back to mother?\" the girl asked with a lengthening\nvisage.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" He asked it indeed gaily enough.\n\n\"Is your conversation to be about--about private affairs?\"\n\n\"No, I can't say that. But I doubt if mother would think it the sort of\nthing that's 'necessary to your development.'\"\n\nThis assertion appeared to inspire her with the eagerness with which she\nagain broke out: \"But who are they--who are they?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the ladies. I never saw them before. The man's a\nfellow I knew very well at Oxford. He was thought immense fun there.\nWe've diverged, as he says, and I had almost lost sight of him, but not\nso much as he thinks, because I've read him--read him with interest. He\nhas written a very clever book.\"\n\n\"What kind of a book?\"\n\n\"A sort of novel.\"\n\n\"What sort of novel?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know--with a lot of good writing.\" Biddy listened to this\nso receptively that she thought it perverse her brother should add: \"I\ndaresay Peter will have come if you return to mother.\"\n\n\"I don't care if he has. Peter's nothing to me. But I'll go if you wish\nit.\"\n\nNick smiled upon her again and then said: \"It doesn't signify. We'll all\ngo.\"\n\n\"All?\" she echoed.\n\n\"He won't hurt us. On the contrary he'll do us good.\"\n\nThis was possible, the girl reflected in silence, but none the less the\nidea struck her as courageous, of their taking the odd young man back to\nbreakfast with them and with the others, especially if Peter should be\nthere. If Peter was nothing to her it was singular she should have\nattached such importance to this contingency. The odd young man\nreappeared, and now that she saw him without his queer female appendages\nhe seemed personally less weird. He struck her moreover, as generally a\ngood deal accounted for by the literary character, especially if it were\nresponsible for a lot of good writing. As he took his place on the bench\nNick said to him, indicating her, \"My sister Bridget,\" and then\nmentioned his name, \"Mr. Gabriel Nash.\"\n\n\"You enjoy Paris--you're happy here?\" Mr. Nash inquired, leaning over\nhis friend to speak to the girl.\n\nThough his words belonged to the situation it struck her that his tone\ndidn't, and this made her answer him more dryly than she usually spoke.\n\"Oh yes, it's very nice.\"\n\n\"And French art interests you? You find things here that please?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I like some of them.\"\n\nMr. Nash considered her kindly. \"I hoped you'd say you like the Academy\nbetter.\"\n\n\"She would if she didn't think you expected it,\" said Nicholas Dormer.\n\n\"Oh Nick!\" Biddy protested.\n\n\"Miss Dormer's herself an English picture,\" their visitor pronounced in\nthe tone of a man whose urbanity was a general solvent.\n\n\"That's a compliment if you don't like them!\" Biddy exclaimed.\n\n\"Ah some of them, some of them; there's a certain sort of thing!\" Mr.\nNash continued. \"We must feel everything, everything that we can. We're\nhere for that.\"\n\n\"You do like English art then?\" Nick demanded with a slight accent of\nsurprise.\n\nMr. Nash indulged his wonder. \"My dear Dormer, do you remember the old\ncomplaint I used to make of you? You had formulas that were like walking\nin one's hat. One may see something in a case and one may not.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Nick, \"I don't know any one who was fonder of a\ngeneralisation than you. You turned them off as the man at the\nstreet-corner distributes hand-bills.\"\n\n\"They were my wild oats. I've sown them all.\"\n\n\"We shall see that!\"\n\n\"Oh there's nothing of them now: a tame, scanty, homely growth. My only\ngood generalisations are my actions.\"\n\n\"We shall see _them_ then.\"\n\n\"Ah pardon me. You can't see them with the naked eye. Moreover, mine are\nprincipally negative. People's actions, I know, are for the most part\nthe things they do--but mine are all the things I _don't_ do. There are\nso many of those, so many, but they don't produce any effect. And then\nall the rest are shades--extremely fine shades.\"\n\n\"Shades of behaviour?\" Nick inquired with an interest which surprised\nhis sister, Mr. Nash's discourse striking her mainly as the twaddle of\nthe under-world.\n\n\"Shades of impression, of appreciation,\" said the young man with his\nexplanatory smile. \"All my behaviour consists of my feelings.\"\n\n\"Well, don't you show your feelings? You used to!\"\n\n\"Wasn't it mainly those of disgust?\" Nash asked. \"Those operate no\nlonger. I've closed that window.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you like everything?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no! But I look only at what I do like.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you've lost the noble faculty of disgust?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea. I never try it. My dear fellow,\" said Gabriel\nNash, \"we've only one life that we know anything about: fancy taking it\nup with disagreeable impressions! When then shall we go in for the\nagreeable?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the agreeable?\" Nick demanded.\n\n\"Oh the happy moments of our consciousness--the multiplication of those\nmoments. We must save as many as possible from the dark gulf.\"\n\nNick had excited surprise on the part of his sister, but it was now\nBiddy's turn to make him open his eyes a little. She raised her sweet\nvoice in appeal to the stranger.\n\n\"Don't you think there are any wrongs in the world--any abuses and\nsufferings?\"\n\n\"Oh so many, so many! That's why one must choose.\"\n\n\"Choose to stop them, to reform them--isn't that the choice?\" Biddy\nasked. \"That's Nick's,\" she added, blushing and looking at this\npersonage.\n\n\"Ah our divergence--yes!\" Mr. Nash sighed. \"There are all kinds of\nmachinery for that--very complicated and ingenious. Your formulas, my\ndear Dormer, your formulas!\"\n\n\"Hang 'em, I haven't got any!\" Nick now bravely declared.\n\n\"To me personally the simplest ways are those that appeal most,\" Mr.\nNash went on. \"We pay too much attention to the ugly; we notice it, we\nmagnify it. The great thing is to leave it alone and encourage the\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"You must be very sure you get hold of the beautiful,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Ah precisely, and that's just the importance of the faculty of\nappreciation. We must train our special sense. It's capable of\nextraordinary extension. Life's none too long for that.\"\n\n\"But what's the good of the extraordinary extension if there is no\naffirmation of it, if it all goes to the negative, as you say? Where are\nthe fine consequences?\" Dormer asked.\n\n\"In one's own spirit. One is one's self a fine consequence. That's the\nmost important one we have to do with. _I_ am a fine consequence,\" said\nGabriel Nash.\n\nBiddy rose from the bench at this and stepped away a little as to look\nat a piece of statuary. But she had not gone far before, pausing and\nturning, she bent her eyes on the speaker with a heightened colour, an\nair of desperation and the question, after a moment: \"Are you then an\n\u00c3\u00a6sthete?\"\n\n\"Ah there's one of the formulas! That's walking in one's hat! I've _no_\nprofession, my dear young lady. I've no _\u00c3\u00a9tat civil_. These things are a\npart of the complicated ingenious machinery. As I say, I keep to the\nsimplest way. I find that gives one enough to do. Merely to be is such a\n_m\u00c3\u00a9tier_; to live such an art; to feel such a career!\"\n\nBridget Dormer turned her back and examined her statue, and her brother\nsaid to his old friend: \"And to write?\"\n\n\"To write? Oh I shall never do it again!\"\n\n\"You've done it almost well enough to be inconsistent. That book of\nyours is anything but negative; it's complicated and ingenious.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I'm extremely ashamed of that book,\" said Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"Ah call yourself a bloated Buddhist and have done with it!\" his\ncompanion exclaimed.\n\n\"Have done with it? I haven't the least desire to have done with it. And\nwhy should one call one's self anything? One only deprives other people\nof their dearest occupation. Let me add that you don't _begin_ to have\nan insight into the art of life till it ceases to be of the smallest\nconsequence to you what you may be called. That's rudimentary.\"\n\n\"But if you go in for shades you must also go in for names. You must\ndistinguish,\" Nick objected. \"The observer's nothing without his\ncategories, his types and varieties.\"\n\n\"Ah trust him to distinguish!\" said Gabriel Nash sweetly. \"That's for\nhis own convenience; he has, privately, a terminology to meet it. That's\none's style. But from the moment it's for the convenience of others the\nsigns have to be grosser, the shades begin to go. That's a deplorable\nhour! Literature, you see, is for the convenience of others. It requires\nthe most abject concessions. It plays such mischief with one's style\nthat really I've had to give it up.\"\n\n\"And politics?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"Well, what about them?\" was Mr. Nash's reply with a special cadence as\nhe watched his friend's sister, who was still examining her statue.\nBiddy was divided between irritation and curiosity. She had interposed\nspace, but she had not gone beyond ear-shot. Nick's question made her\ncuriosity throb as a rejoinder to his friend's words.\n\n\"That, no doubt you'll say, is still far more for the convenience of\nothers--is still worse for one's style.\"\n\nBiddy turned round in time to hear Mr. Nash answer: \"It has simply\nnothing in life to do with shades! I can't say worse for it than that.\"\n\nBiddy stepped nearer at this and drew still further on her courage.\n\"Won't mamma be waiting? Oughtn't we to go to luncheon?\"\n\nBoth the young men looked up at her and Mr. Nash broke out: \"You ought\nto protest! You ought to save him!\"\n\n\"To save him?\" Biddy echoed.\n\n\"He had a style, upon my word he had! But I've seen it go. I've read his\nspeeches.\"\n\n\"You were capable of that?\" Nick laughed.\n\n\"For you, yes. But it was like listening to a nightingale in a brass\nband.\"\n\n\"I think they were beautiful,\" Biddy declared.\n\nHer brother got up at this tribute, and Mr. Nash, rising too, said with\nhis bright colloquial air: \"But, Miss Dormer, he had eyes. He was made\nto see--to see all over, to see everything. There are so few like that.\"\n\n\"I think he still sees,\" Biddy returned, wondering a little why Nick\ndidn't defend himself.\n\n\"He sees his 'side,' his dreadful 'side,' dear young lady. Poor man,\nfancy your having a 'side'--you, you--and spending your days and your\nnights looking at it! I'd as soon pass my life looking at an\nadvertisement on a hoarding.\"\n\n\"You don't see me some day a great statesman?\" said Nick.\n\n\"My dear fellow, it's exactly what I've a terror of.\"\n\n\"Mercy! don't you admire them?\" Biddy cried.\n\n\"It's a trade like another and a method of making one's way which\nsociety certainly condones. But when one can be something better--!\"\n\n\"Why what in the world is better?\" Biddy asked.\n\nThe young man gasped and Nick, replying for him, said: \"Gabriel Nash is\nbetter! You must come and lunch with us. I must keep you--I must!\" he\nadded.\n\n\"We shall save him yet,\" Mr. Nash kept on easily to Biddy while they\nwent and the girl wondered still more what her mother would make of\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAfter her companions left her Lady Agnes rested for five minutes in\nsilence with her elder daughter, at the end of which time she observed:\n\"I suppose one must have food at any rate,\" and, getting up, quitted the\nplace where they had been sitting. \"And where are we to go? I hate\neating out of doors,\" she went on.\n\n\"Dear me, when one comes to Paris--!\" Grace returned in a tone\napparently implying that in so rash an adventure one must be prepared\nfor compromises and concessions. The two ladies wandered to where they\nsaw a large sign of \"Buffet\" suspended in the air, entering a precinct\nreserved for little white-clothed tables, straw-covered chairs and\nlong-aproned waiters. One of these functionaries approached them with\neagerness and with a _\"Mesdames sont seules?\"_ receiving in return from\nher ladyship the slightly snappish announcement _\"Non; nous sommes\nbeaucoup!\"_ He introduced them to a table larger than most of the\nothers, and under his protection they took their places at it and began\nrather languidly and vaguely to consider the question of the repast. The\nwaiter had placed a _carte_ in Lady Agnes's hands and she studied it,\nthrough her eye-glass, with a failure of interest, while he enumerated\nwith professional fluency the resources of the establishment and Grace\nwatched the people at the other tables. She was hungry and had already\nbroken a morsel from a long glazed roll.\n\n\"Not cold beef and pickles, you know,\" she observed to her mother. Lady\nAgnes gave no heed to this profane remark, but dropped her eye-glass and\nlaid down the greasy document. \"What does it signify? I daresay it's all\nnasty,\" Grace continued; and she added inconsequently: \"If Peter comes\nhe's sure to be particular.\"\n\n\"Let him first be particular to come!\" her ladyship exclaimed, turning a\ncold eye upon the waiter.\n\n_\"Poulet chasseur, filets mignons sauce bearnaise,\"_ the man suggested.\n\n\"You'll give us what I tell you,\" said Lady Agnes; and she mentioned\nwith distinctness and authority the dishes of which she desired that the\nmeal should be composed. He interjected three or four more suggestions,\nbut as they produced absolutely no impression on her he became silent\nand submissive, doing justice apparently to her ideas. For Lady Agnes\nhad ideas, and, though it had suited her humour ten minutes before to\nprofess herself helpless in such a case, the manner in which she imposed\nthem on the waiter as original, practical, and economical, showed the\nhigh executive woman, the mother of children, the daughter of earls, the\nconsort of an official, the dispenser of hospitality, looking back upon\na lifetime of luncheons. She carried many cares, and the feeding of\nmultitudes--she was honourably conscious of having fed them decently, as\nshe had always done everything--had ever been one of them. \"Everything's\nabsurdly dear,\" she remarked to her daughter as the waiter went away. To\nthis remark Grace made no answer. She had been used for a long time back\nto hearing that everything was very dear; it was what one always\nexpected. So she found the case herself, but she was silent and\ninventive about it, and nothing further passed, in the way of\nconversation with her mother, while they waited for the latter's orders\nto be executed, till Lady Agnes reflected audibly: \"He makes me unhappy,\nthe way he talks about Julia.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think he does it to torment one. One can't mention her!\"\nGrace responded.\n\n\"It's better not to mention her, but to leave it alone.\"\n\n\"Yet he never mentions her of himself.\"\n\n\"In some cases that's supposed to show that people like people--though\nof course something more's required to prove it,\" Lady Agnes continued\nto meditate. \"Sometimes I think he's thinking of her, then at others I\ncan't fancy _what_ he's thinking of.\"\n\n\"It would be awfully suitable,\" said Grace, biting her roll.\n\nHer companion had a pause, as if looking for some higher ground to put\nit upon. Then she appeared to find this loftier level in the\nobservation: \"Of course he must like her--he has known her always.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be plainer than that she likes him,\" Grace opined.\n\n\"Poor Julia!\" Lady Agnes almost wailed; and her tone suggested that she\nknew more about that than she was ready to state.\n\n\"It isn't as if she wasn't clever and well read,\" her daughter went on.\n\"If there were nothing else there would be a reason in her being so\ninterested in politics, in everything that he is.\"\n\n\"Ah what Nick is--that's what I sometimes wonder!\"\n\nGrace eyed her parent in some despair: \"Why, mother, isn't he going to\nbe like papa?\" She waited for an answer that didn't come; after which\nshe pursued: \"I thought you thought him so like him already.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't,\" said Lady Agnes quietly.\n\n\"Who is then? Certainly Percy isn't.\"\n\nLady Agnes was silent a space. \"There's no one like your father.\"\n\n\"Dear papa!\" Grace handsomely concurred. Then with a rapid transition:\n\"It would be so jolly for all of us--she'd be so nice to us.\"\n\n\"She's that already--in her way,\" said Lady Agnes conscientiously,\nhaving followed the return, quick as it was. \"Much good does it do her!\"\nAnd she reproduced the note of her bitterness of a moment before.\n\n\"It does her some good that one should look out for her. I do, and I\nthink she knows it,\" Grace declared. \"One can at any rate keep other\nwomen off.\"\n\n\"Don't meddle--you're very clumsy,\" was her mother's not particularly\nsympathetic rejoinder. \"There are other women who are beautiful, and\nthere are others who are clever and rich.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not all in one: that's what's so nice in Julia. Her fortune\nwould be thrown in; he wouldn't appear to have married her for it.\"\n\n\"If he does he won't,\" said Lady Agnes a trifle obscurely.\n\n\"Yes, that's what's so charming. And he could do anything then, couldn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"Well, your father had no fortune to speak of.\"\n\n\"Yes, but didn't Uncle Percy help him?\"\n\n\"His wife helped him,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"Dear mamma!\"--the girl was prompt. \"There's one thing,\" she added:\n\"that Mr. Carteret will always help Nick.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'always'?\"\n\n\"Why whether he marries Julia or not.\"\n\n\"Things aren't so easy,\" Lady Agnes judged. \"It will all depend on\nNick's behaviour. He can stop it to-morrow.\"\n\nGrace Dormer stared; she evidently thought Mr. Carteret's beneficence a\npart of the scheme of nature. \"How could he stop it?\"\n\n\"By not being serious. It isn't so hard to prevent people giving you\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Serious?\" Grace repeated. \"Does he want him to be a prig like Lord\nEgbert?\"\n\n\"Yes--that's exactly what he wants. And what he'll do for him he'll do\nfor him only if he marries Julia.\"\n\n\"Has he told you?\" Grace inquired. And then, before her mother could\nanswer, \"I'm delighted at that!\" she cried.\n\n\"He hasn't told me, but that's the way things happen.\" Lady Agnes was\nless optimistic than her daughter, and such optimism as she cultivated\nwas a thin tissue with the sense of things as they are showing through.\n\"If Nick becomes rich Charles Carteret will make him more so. If he\ndoesn't he won't give him a shilling.\"\n\n\"Oh mamma!\" Grace demurred.\n\n\"It's all very well to say that in public life money isn't as necessary\nas it used to be,\" her ladyship went on broodingly. \"Those who say so\ndon't know anything about it. It's always intensely necessary.\"\n\nHer daughter, visibly affected by the gloom of her manner, felt impelled\nto evoke as a corrective a more cheerful idea. \"I daresay; but there's\nthe fact--isn't there?--that poor papa had so little.\"\n\n\"Yes, and there's the fact that it killed him!\"\n\nThese words came out with a strange, quick, little flare of passion.\nThey startled Grace Dormer, who jumped in her place and gasped, \"Oh\nmother!\" The next instant, however, she added in a different voice, \"Oh\nPeter!\" for, with an air of eagerness, a gentleman was walking up to\nthem.\n\n\"How d'ye do, Cousin Agnes? How d'ye do, little Grace?\" Peter\nSherringham laughed and shook hands with them, and three minutes later\nwas settled in his chair at their table, on which the first elements of\nthe meal had been placed. Explanations, on one side and the other, were\ndemanded and produced; from which it appeared that the two parties had\nbeen in some degree at cross-purposes. The day before Lady Agnes and her\ncompanions travelled to Paris Sherringham had gone to London for\nforty-eight hours on private business of the ambassador's, arriving, on\nhis return by the night-train, only early that morning. There had\naccordingly been a delay in his receiving Nick Dormer's two notes. If\nNick had come to the embassy in person--he might have done him the\nhonour to call--he would have learned that the second secretary was\nabsent. Lady Agnes was not altogether successful in assigning a motive\nto her son's neglect of this courteous form; she could but say: \"I\nexpected him, I wanted him to go; and indeed, not hearing from you, he\nwould have gone immediately--an hour or two hence, on leaving this\nplace. But we're here so quietly--not to go out, not to seem to appeal\nto the ambassador. Nick put it so--'Oh mother, we'll keep out of it; a\nfriendly note will do.' I don't know definitely what he wanted to keep\nout of, unless anything like gaiety. The embassy isn't gay, I know. But\nI'm sure his note was friendly, wasn't it? I daresay you'll see for\nyourself. He's different directly he gets abroad; he doesn't seem to\ncare.\" Lady Agnes paused a moment, not carrying out this particular\nelucidation; then she resumed: \"He said you'd have seen Julia and that\nyou'd understand everything from her. And when I asked how she'd know he\nsaid, 'Oh she knows everything!'\"\n\n\"He never said a word to me about Julia,\" Peter Sherringham returned.\nLady Agnes and her daughter exchanged a glance at this: the latter had\nalready asked three times where Julia was, and her ladyship dropped that\nthey had been hoping she would be able to come with Peter. The young man\nset forth that she was at the moment at an hotel in the Rue de la Paix,\nbut had only been there since that morning; he had seen her before\nproceeding to the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. She had come up to Paris by an early\ntrain--- she had been staying at Versailles, of all places in the world.\nShe had been a week in Paris on her return from Cannes--her stay there\nhad been of nearly a month: fancy!--and then had gone out to Versailles\nto see Mrs. Billinghurst. Perhaps they'd remember her, poor Dallow's\nsister. She was staying there to teach her daughters French--she had a\ndozen or two!--and Julia had spent three days with her. She was to\nreturn to England about the twenty-fifth. It would make seven weeks she\nmust have been away from town--a rare thing for her; she usually stuck\nto it so in summer.\n\n\"Three days with Mrs. Billinghurst--how very good-natured of her!\" Lady\nAgnes commented.\n\n\"Oh they're very nice to her,\" Sherringham said.\n\n\"Well, I hope so!\" Grace Dormer exhaled. \"Why didn't you make her come\nhere?\"\n\n\"I proposed it, but she wouldn't.\" Another eye-beam, at this, passed\nbetween the two ladies and Peter went on: \"She said you must come and\nsee her at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Hollande.\"\n\n\"Of course we'll do that,\" Lady Agnes declared. \"Nick went to ask about\nher at the Westminster.\"\n\n\"She gave that up; they wouldn't give her the rooms she wanted, her\nusual set.\"\n\n\"She's delightfully particular!\" Grace said complacently. Then she\nadded: \"She _does_ like pictures, doesn't she?\"\n\nPeter Sherringham stared. \"Oh I daresay. But that's not what she has in\nher head this morning. She has some news from London--she's immensely\nexcited.\"\n\n\"What has she in her head?\" Lady Agnes asked.\n\n\"What's her news from London?\" Grace added.\n\n\"She wants Nick to stand.\"\n\n\"Nick to stand?\" both ladies cried.\n\n\"She undertakes to bring him in for Harsh. Mr. Pinks is dead--the\nfellow, you know, who got the seat at the general election. He dropped\ndown in London--disease of the heart or something of that sort. Julia\nhas her telegram, but I see it was in last night's papers.\"\n\n\"Imagine--Nick never mentioned it!\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"Don't you know, mother?--abroad he only reads foreign papers.\"\n\n\"Oh I know. I've no patience with him,\" her ladyship continued. \"Dear\nJulia!\"\n\n\"It's a nasty little place, and Pinks had a tight squeeze--107 or\nsomething of that sort; but if it returned a Liberal a year ago very\nlikely it will do so again. Julia at any rate believes it can be made\nto--if the man's Nick--and is ready to take the order to put him in.\"\n\n\"I'm sure if she can do it she will,\" Grace pronounced.\n\n\"Dear, dear Julia! And Nick can do something for himself,\" said the\nmother of this candidate.\n\n\"I've no doubt he can do anything,\" Peter Sherringham returned\ngood-naturedly. Then, \"Do you mean in expenses?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Ah I'm afraid he can't do much in expenses, poor dear boy! And it's\ndreadful how little we can look to Percy.\"\n\n\"Well, I daresay you may look to Julia. I think that's her idea.\"\n\n\"Delightful Julia!\" Lady Agnes broke out. \"If poor Sir Nicholas could\nhave known! Of course he must go straight home,\" she added.\n\n\"He won't like that,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Then he'll have to go without liking it.\"\n\n\"It will rather spoil _your_ little excursion, if you've only just\ncome,\" Peter suggested; \"to say nothing of the great Biddy's, if she's\nenjoying Paris.\"\n\n\"We may stay perhaps--with Julia to protect us,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"Ah she won't stay; she'll go over for her man.\"\n\n\"Her man----?\"\n\n\"The fellow who stands, whoever he is--especially if he's Nick.\" These\nlast words caused the eyes of Peter Sherringham's companions to meet\nagain, and he went on: \"She'll go straight down to Harsh.\"\n\n\"Wonderful Julia!\" Lady Agnes panted. \"Of course Nick must go straight\nthere too.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose he must see first if they'll have him.\"\n\n\"If they'll have him? Why how can he tell till he tries?\"\n\n\"I mean the people at headquarters, the fellows who arrange it.\"\n\nLady Agnes coloured a little. \"My dear Peter, do you suppose there will\nbe the least doubt of their 'having' the son of his father?\"\n\n\"Of course it's a great name, Cousin Agnes--a very great name.\"\n\n\"One of the greatest, simply,\" Lady Agnes smiled.\n\n\"It's the best name in the world!\" said Grace more emphatically.\n\n\"All the same it didn't prevent his losing his seat.\"\n\n\"By half-a-dozen votes: it was too odious!\" her ladyship cried.\n\n\"I remember--I remember. And in such a case as that why didn't they\nimmediately put him in somewhere else?\"\n\n\"How one sees you live abroad, dear Peter! There happens to have been\nthe most extraordinary lack of openings--I never saw anything like\nit--for a year. They've had their hand on him, keeping him all ready. I\ndaresay they've telegraphed him.\"\n\n\"And he hasn't told you?\"\n\nLady Agnes faltered. \"He's so very odd when he's abroad!\"\n\n\"At home too he lets things go,\" Grace interposed. \"He does so\nlittle--takes no trouble.\" Her mother suffered this statement to pass\nunchallenged, and she pursued philosophically: \"I suppose it's because\nhe knows he's so clever.\"\n\n\"So he is, dear old man. But what does he do, what has he been doing, in\na positive way?\"\n\n\"He has been painting.\"\n\n\"Ah not seriously!\" Lady Agnes protested.\n\n\"That's the worst way,\" said Peter Sherringham. \"Good things?\"\n\nNeither of the ladies made a direct response to this, but Lady Agnes\nsaid: \"He has spoken repeatedly. They're always calling on him.\"\n\n\"He speaks magnificently,\" Grace attested.\n\n\"That's another of the things I lose, living in far countries. And he's\ndoing the Salon now with the great Biddy?\"\n\n\"Just the things in this part. I can't think what keeps them so long,\"\nLady Agnes groaned. \"Did you ever see such a dreadful place?\"\n\nSherringham stared. \"Aren't the things good? I had an idea----!\"\n\n\"Good?\" cried Lady Agnes. \"They're too odious, too wicked.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" laughed Peter, \"that's what people fall into if they live abroad.\nThe French oughtn't to live abroad!\"\n\n\"Here they come,\" Grace announced at this point; \"but they've got a\nstrange man with them.\"\n\n\"That's a bore when we want to talk!\" Lady Agnes sighed.\n\nPeter got up in the spirit of welcome and stood a moment watching the\nothers approach. \"There will be no difficulty in talking, to judge by\nthe gentleman,\" he dropped; and while he remains so conspicuous our eyes\nmay briefly rest on him. He was middling high and was visibly a\nrepresentative of the nervous rather than of the phlegmatic branch of\nhis race. He had an oval face, fine firm features, and a complexion that\ntended to the brown. Brown were his eyes, and women thought them soft;\ndark brown his hair, in which the same critics sometimes regretted the\nabsence of a little undulation. It was perhaps to conceal this plainness\nthat he wore it very short. His teeth were white, his moustache was\npointed, and so was the small beard that adorned the extremity of his\nchin. His face expressed intelligence and was very much alive; it had\nthe further distinction that it often struck superficial observers with\na certain foreignness of cast. The deeper sort, however, usually felt it\nlatently English enough. There was an idea that, having taken up the\ndiplomatic career and gone to live in strange lands, he cultivated the\nmask of an alien, an Italian or a Spaniard; of an alien in time\neven--one of the wonderful ubiquitous diplomatic agents of the sixteenth\ncentury. In fact, none the less, it would have been impossible to be\nmore modern than Peter Sherringham--more of one's class and one's\ncountry. But this didn't prevent several stray persons--Bridget Dormer\nfor instance--from admiring the hue of his cheek for its olive richness\nand his moustache and beard for their resemblance to those of Charles I.\nAt the same time--she rather jumbled her comparisons--she thought he\nrecalled a Titian.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nPeter's meeting with Nick was of the friendliest on both sides,\ninvolving a great many \"dear fellows\" and \"old boys,\" and his salutation\nto the younger of the Miss Dormers consisted of the frankest \"Delighted\nto see you, my dear Bid!\" There was no kissing, but there was cousinship\nin the air, of a conscious, living kind, as Gabriel Nash doubtless\nquickly noted, hovering for a moment outside the group. Biddy said\nnothing to Peter Sherringham, but there was no flatness in a silence\nwhich heaved, as it were, with the fairest physiognomic portents. Nick\nintroduced Gabriel Nash to his mother and to the other two as \"a\ndelightful old friend\" whom he had just come across, and Sherringham\nacknowledged the act by saying to Mr. Nash, but as if rather less for\nhis sake than for that of the presenter: \"I've seen you very often\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Ah repetition--recurrence: we haven't yet, in the study of how to live,\nabolished that clumsiness, have we?\" Mr. Nash genially inquired. \"It's a\npoverty in the supernumeraries of our stage that we don't pass once for\nall, but come round and cross again like a procession or an army at the\ntheatre. It's a sordid economy that ought to have been managed better.\nThe right thing would be just _one_ appearance, and the procession,\nregardless of expense, for ever and for ever different.\" The company was\noccupied in placing itself at table, so that the only disengaged\nattention for the moment was Grace's, to whom, as her eyes rested on\nhim, the young man addressed these last words with a smile. \"Alas, it's\na very shabby idea, isn't it? The world isn't got up regardless of\nexpense!\"\n\nGrace looked quickly away from him and said to her brother: \"Nick, Mr.\nPinks is dead.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pinks?\" asked Gabriel Nash, appearing to wonder where he should\nsit.\n\n\"The member for Harsh; and Julia wants you to stand,\" the girl went on.\n\n\"Mr. Pinks, the member for Harsh? What names to be sure!\" Gabriel mused\ncheerfully, still unseated.\n\n\"Julia wants me? I'm much obliged to her!\" Nick absently said. \"Nash,\nplease sit by my mother, with Peter on her other side.\"\n\n\"My dear, it isn't Julia\"--Lady Agnes spoke earnestly. \"Every one wants\nyou. Haven't you heard from your people? Didn't you know the seat was\nvacant?\"\n\nNick was looking round the table to see what was on it. \"Upon my word I\ndon't remember. What else have you ordered, mother?\"\n\n\"There's some _boeuf brais\u00c3\u00a9_, my dear, and afterwards some galantine.\nHere's a dish of eggs with asparagus-tips.\"\n\n\"I advise you to go in for it, Nick,\" said Peter Sherringham, to whom\nthe preparation in question was presented.\n\n\"Into the eggs with asparagus-tips? _Donnez m'en s'il vous pla\u00c3\u00aet_. My\ndear fellow, how can I stand? how can I sit? Where's the money to come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"The money? Why from Jul----!\" Grace began, but immediately caught her\nmother's eye.\n\n\"Poor Julia, how you do work her!\" Nick exclaimed. \"Nash, I recommend\nyou the asparagus-tips. Mother, he's my best friend--do look after him.\"\n\n\"I've an impression I've breakfasted--I'm not sure,\" Nash smiled.\n\n\"With those beautiful ladies? Try again--you'll find out.\"\n\n\"The money can be managed; the expenses are very small and the seat's\ncertain,\" Lady Agnes pursued, not apparently heeding her son's\ninjunction in respect to Nash.\n\n\"Rather--if Julia goes down!\" her elder daughter exclaimed.\n\n\"Perhaps Julia won't go down!\" Nick answered humorously.\n\nBiddy was seated next to Mr. Nash, so that she could take occasion to\nask, \"Who are the beautiful ladies?\" as if she failed to recognise her\nbrother's allusion. In reality this was an innocent trick: she was more\ncurious than she could have given a suitable reason for about the odd\nwomen from whom her neighbour had lately separated.\n\n\"Deluded, misguided, infatuated persons!\" Mr. Nash replied,\nunderstanding that she had asked for a description. \"Strange eccentric,\nalmost romantic, types. Predestined victims, simple-minded sacrificial\nlambs!\"\n\nThis was copious, yet it was vague, so that Biddy could only respond:\n\"Oh all that?\" But meanwhile Peter Sherringham said to Nick: \"Julia's\nhere, you know. You must go and see her.\"\n\nNick looked at him an instant rather hard, as if to say: \"You too?\" But\nPeter's eyes appeared to answer, \"No, no, not I\"; upon which his cousin\nrejoined: \"Of course I'll go and see her. I'll go immediately. Please to\nthank her for thinking of me.\"\n\n\"Thinking of you? There are plenty to think of you!\" Lady Agnes said.\n\"There are sure to be telegrams at home. We must go back--we must go\nback!\"\n\n\"We must go back to England?\" Nick Dormer asked; and as his mother made\nno answer he continued: \"Do you mean I must go to Harsh?\"\n\nHer ladyship evaded this question, inquiring of Mr. Nash if he would\nhave a morsel of fish; but her gain was small, for this gentleman,\nstruck again by the unhappy name of the bereaved constituency, only\nbroke out: \"Ah what a place to represent! How can you--how can you?\"\n\n\"It's an excellent place,\" said Lady Agnes coldly. \"I imagine you've\nnever been there. It's a very good place indeed. It belongs very largely\nto my cousin, Mrs. Dallow.\"\n\nGabriel partook of the fish, listening with interest. \"But I thought we\nhad no more pocket-boroughs.\"\n\n\"It's pockets we rather lack, so many of us. There are plenty of\nHarshes,\" Nick Dormer observed.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Lady Agnes said to Nash with considerable\nmajesty.\n\nPeter Sherringham also addressed him with an \"Oh it's all right; they\ncome down on you like a shot!\" and the young man continued ingenuously:\n\n\"Do you mean to say you've to pay money to get into that awful\nplace--that it's not _you_ who are paid?\"\n\n\"Into that awful place?\" Lady Agnes repeated blankly.\n\n\"Into the House of Commons. That you don't get a high salary?\"\n\n\"My dear Nash, you're delightful: don't leave me--don't leave me!\" Nick\ncried; while his mother looked at him with an eye that demanded: \"Who in\nthe world's this extraordinary person?\"\n\n\"What then did you think pocket-boroughs were?\" Peter Sherringham asked.\n\nMr. Nash's facial radiance rested on him. \"Why, boroughs that filled\nyour pocket. To do that sort of thing without a bribe--_c'est trop\nfort!_\"\n\n\"He lives at Samarcand,\" Nick Dormer explained to his mother, who\nflushed perceptibly. \"What do you advise me? I'll do whatever you say,\"\nhe went on to his old acquaintance.\n\n\"My dear, my dear----!\" Lady Agnes pleaded.\n\n\"See Julia first, with all respect to Mr. Nash. She's of excellent\ncounsel,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\nMr. Nash smiled across the table at his host. \"The lady first--the lady\nfirst! I've not a word to suggest as against any idea of hers.\"\n\n\"We mustn't sit here too long, there'll be so much to do,\" said Lady\nAgnes anxiously, perceiving a certain slowness in the service of the\n_boeuf brais\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\nBiddy had been up to this moment mainly occupied in looking, covertly\nand in snatches, at Peter Sherringham; as was perfectly lawful in a\nyoung lady with a handsome cousin whom she had not seen for more than a\nyear. But her sweet voice now took license to throw in the words: \"We\nknow what Mr. Nash thinks of politics: he told us just now he thinks\nthem dreadful.\"\n\n\"No, not dreadful--only inferior,\" the personage impugned protested.\n\"Everything's relative.\"\n\n\"Inferior to what?\" Lady Agnes demanded.\n\nMr. Nash appeared to consider a moment. \"To anything else that may be in\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Nothing else is in question!\" said her ladyship in a tone that would\nhave been triumphant if it had not been so dry.\n\n\"Ah then!\" And her neighbour shook his head sadly. He turned after this\nto Biddy. \"The ladies whom I was with just now and in whom you were so\ngood as to express an interest?\" Biddy gave a sign of assent and he went\non: \"They're persons theatrical. The younger one's trying to go upon the\nstage.\"\n\n\"And are you assisting her?\" Biddy inquired, pleased she had guessed so\nnearly right.\n\n\"Not in the least--I'm rather choking her off. I consider it the lowest\nof the arts.\"\n\n\"Lower than politics?\" asked Peter Sherringham, who was listening to\nthis.\n\n\"Dear no, I won't say that. I think the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais a greater\ninstitution than the House of Commons.\"\n\n\"I agree with you there!\" laughed Sherringham; \"all the more that I\ndon't consider the dramatic art a low one. It seems to me on the\ncontrary to include all the others.\"\n\n\"Yes--that's a view. I think it's the view of my friends.\"\n\n\"Of your friends?\"\n\n\"Two ladies--old acquaintances--whom I met in Paris a week ago and whom\nI've just been spending an hour with in this place.\"\n\n\"You should have seen them; they struck me very much,\" Biddy said to her\ncousin.\n\n\"I should like to see them if they really have anything to say to the\ntheatre.\"\n\n\"It can easily be managed. Do you believe in the theatre?\" asked Gabriel\nNash.\n\n\"Passionately,\" Sherringham confessed. \"Don't you?\"\n\nBefore Nash had had time to answer Biddy had interposed with a sigh.\n\"How I wish I could go--but in Paris I can't!\"\n\n\"I'll take you, Biddy--I vow I'll take you.\"\n\n\"But the plays, Peter,\" the girl objected. \"Mamma says they're worse\nthan the pictures.\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll arrange that: they shall do one at the Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais on purpose\nfor a delightful little yearning English girl.\"\n\n\"Can you make them?\"\n\n\"I can make them do anything I choose.\"\n\n\"Ah then it's the theatre that believes in _you_,\" said Mr. Nash.\n\n\"It would be ungrateful if it didn't after all I've done for it!\"\nSherringham gaily opined.\n\nLady Agnes had withdrawn herself from between him and her other guest\nand, to signify that she at least had finished eating, had gone to sit\nby her son, whom she held, with some importunity, in conversation. But\nhearing the theatre talked of she threw across an impersonal challenge\nto the paradoxical young man. \"Pray should you think it better for a\ngentleman to be an actor?\"\n\n\"Better than being a politician? Ah, comedian for comedian, isn't the\nactor more honest?\"\n\nLady Agnes turned to her son and brought forth with spirit: \"Think of\nyour great father, Nicholas!\"\n\n\"He was an honest man,\" said Nicholas. \"That's perhaps why he couldn't\nstand it.\"\n\nPeter Sherringham judged the colloquy to have taken an uncomfortable\ntwist, though not wholly, as it seemed to him, by the act of Nick's\nqueer comrade. To draw it back to safer ground he said to this\npersonage: \"May I ask if the ladies you just spoke of are English--Mrs.\nand Miss Rooth: isn't that the rather odd name?\"\n\n\"The very same. Only the daughter, according to her kind, desires to be\nknown by some _nom de guerre_ before she has even been able to enlist.\"\n\n\"And what does she call herself?\" Bridget Dormer asked.\n\n\"Maud Vavasour, or Edith Temple, or Gladys Vane--some rubbish of that\nsort.\"\n\n\"What then is her own name?\"\n\n\"Miriam--Miriam Rooth. It would do very well and would give her the\nbenefit of the prepossessing fact that--to the best of my belief at\nleast--she's more than half a Jewess.\"\n\n\"It is as good as Rachel Felix,\" Sherringham said.\n\n\"The name's as good, but not the talent. The girl's splendidly stupid.\"\n\n\"And more than half a Jewess? Don't you believe it!\" Sherringham\nlaughed.\n\n\"Don't believe she's a Jewess?\" Biddy asked, still more interested in\nMiriam Rooth.\n\n\"No, no--that she's stupid, really. If she is she'll be the first.\"\n\n\"Ah you may judge for yourself,\" Nash rejoined, \"if you'll come\nto-morrow afternoon to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, Rue de Constantinople, _\u00c3\u00a0\nl'entresol_.\"\n\n\"Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9? Why, I've already a note from her--I found it this\nmorning on my return to Paris--asking me to look in at five o'clock and\nlisten to a _jeune Anglaise_.\"\n\n\"That's my arrangement--I obtained the favour. The ladies want an\nopinion, and dear old Carr\u00c3\u00a9 has consented to see them and to give one.\nMaud Vavasour will recite, and the venerable artist will pass\njudgement.\"\n\nSherringham remembered he had his note in his pocket and took it out to\nlook it over. \"She wishes to make her a little audience--she says she'll\ndo better with that--and she asks me because I'm English. I shall make a\npoint of going.\"\n\n\"And bring Dormer if you can: the audience will be better. Will you\ncome, Dormer?\" Mr. Nash continued, appealing to his friend--\"will you\ncome with me to hear an English amateur recite and an old French actress\npitch into her?\"\n\nNick looked round from his talk with his mother and Grace. \"I'll go\nanywhere with you so that, as I've told you, I mayn't lose sight of\nyou--may keep hold of you.\"\n\n\"Poor Mr. Nash, why is he so useful?\" Lady Agnes took a cold freedom to\ninquire.\n\n\"He steadies me, mother.\"\n\n\"Oh I wish you'd take _me_, Peter,\" Biddy broke out wistfully to her\ncousin.\n\n\"To spend an hour with an old French actress? Do _you_ want to go upon\nthe stage?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"No, but I want to see something--to know something.\"\n\n\"Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's wonderful in her way, but she's hardly company for a\nlittle English girl.\"\n\n\"I'm not little, I'm only too big; and _she_ goes, the person you speak\nof.\"\n\n\"For a professional purpose and with her good mother,\" smiled Mr. Nash.\n\"I think Lady Agnes would hardly venture----!\"\n\n\"Oh I've seen her good mother!\" said Biddy as if she had her impression\nof what the worth of that protection might be.\n\n\"Yes, but you haven't heard her. It's then that you measure her.\"\n\nBiddy was wistful still. \"Is it the famous Honorine Carr\u00c3\u00a9, the great\ncelebrity?\"\n\n\"Honorine in person: the incomparable, the perfect!\" said Peter\nSherringham. \"The first artist of our time, taking her altogether. She\nand I are old pals; she has been so good as to come and 'say'\nthings--which she does sometimes still _dans le monde_ as no one else\n_can_--- in my rooms.\"\n\n\"Make her come then. We can go _there_!\"\n\n\"One of these days!\"\n\n\"And the young lady--Miriam, Maud, Gladys--make her come too.\"\n\nSherringham looked at Nash and the latter was bland. \"Oh you'll have no\ndifficulty. She'll jump at it!\"\n\n\"Very good. I'll give a little artistic tea--with Julia too of course.\nAnd you must come, Mr. Nash.\" This gentleman promised with an\ninclination, and Peter continued: \"But if, as you say, you're not for\nhelping the young lady, how came you to arrange this interview with the\ngreat model?\"\n\n\"Precisely to stop her short. The great model will find her very bad.\nHer judgements, as you probably know, are Rhadamanthine.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate creature!\" said Biddy. \"I think you're cruel.\"\n\n\"Never mind--I'll look after them,\" Sherringham laughed.\n\n\"And how can Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 judge if the girl recites English?\"\n\n\"She's so intelligent that she could judge if she recited Chinese,\"\nPeter declared.\n\n\"That's true, but the _jeune Anglaise_ recites also in French,\" said\nGabriel Nash.\n\n\"Then she isn't stupid.\"\n\n\"And in Italian, and in several more tongues, for aught I know.\"\n\nSherringham was visibly interested. \"Very good--we'll put her through\nthem all.\"\n\n\"She must be _most_ clever,\" Biddy went on yearningly.\n\n\"She has spent her life on the Continent; she has wandered about with\nher mother; she has picked up things.\"\n\n\"And is she a lady?\" Biddy asked.\n\n\"Oh tremendous! The great ones of the earth on the mother's side. On the\nfather's, on the other hand, I imagine, only a Jew stockbroker in the\nCity.\"\n\n\"Then they're rich--or ought to be,\" Sherringham suggested.\n\n\"Ought to be--ah there's the bitterness! The stockbroker had too short a\ngo--he was carried off in his flower. However, he left his wife a\ncertain property, which she appears to have muddled away, not having the\nsafeguard of being herself a Hebrew. This is what she has lived on till\nto-day--this and another resource. Her husband, as she has often told\nme, had the artistic temperament: that's common, as you know, among _ces\nmessieurs_. He made the most of his little opportunities and collected\nvarious pictures, tapestries, enamels, porcelains, and similar gewgaws.\nHe parted with them also, I gather, at a profit; in short he carried on\na neat little business as a _brocanteur_. It was nipped in the bud, but\nMrs. Rooth was left with a certain number of these articles in her\nhands; indeed they must have formed her only capital. She was not a\nwoman of business; she turned them, no doubt, to indifferent account;\nbut she sold them piece by piece, and they kept her going while her\ndaughter grew up. It was to this precarious traffic, conducted with\nextraordinary mystery and delicacy, that, five years ago, in Florence, I\nwas indebted for my acquaintance with her. In those days I used to\ncollect--heaven help me!--I used to pick up rubbish which I could ill\nafford. It was a little phase--we have our little phases, haven't we?\"\nMr. Nash asked with childlike trust--\"and I've come out on the other\nside. Mrs. Rooth had an old green pot and I heard of her old green pot.\nTo hear of it was to long for it, so that I went to see it under cover\nof night. I bought it and a couple of years ago I overturned and smashed\nit. It was the last of the little phase. It was not, however, as you've\nseen, the last of Mrs. Rooth. I met her afterwards in London, and I\nfound her a year or two ago in Venice. She appears to be a great\nwanderer. She had other old pots, of other colours, red, yellow, black,\nor blue--she could produce them of any complexion you liked. I don't\nknow whether she carried them about with her or whether she had little\nsecret stores in the principal cities of Europe. To-day at any rate they\nseem all gone. On the other hand she has her daughter, who has grown up\nand who's a precious vase of another kind--less fragile I hope than the\nrest. May she not be overturned and smashed!\"\n\nPeter Sherringham and Biddy Dormer listened with attention to this\nhistory, and the girl testified to the interest with which she had\nfollowed it by saying when Mr. Nash had ceased speaking: \"A Jewish\nstockbroker, a dealer in curiosities: what an odd person to marry--for a\nperson who was well born! I daresay he was a German.\"\n\n\"His name must have been simply Roth, and the poor lady, to smarten it\nup, has put in another _o_,\" Sherringham ingeniously suggested.\n\n\"You're both very clever,\" said Gabriel, \"and Rudolf Roth, as I happen\nto know, was indeed the designation of Maud Vavasour's papa. But so far\nas the question of derogation goes one might as well drown as\nstarve--for what connexion is _not_ a misalliance when one happens to\nhave the unaccommodating, the crushing honour of being a Neville-Nugent\nof Castle Nugent? That's the high lineage of Maud's mamma. I seem to\nhave heard it mentioned that Rudolf Roth was very versatile and, like\nmost of his species, not unacquainted with the practice of music. He had\nbeen employed to teach the harmonium to Miss Neville-Nugent and she had\nprofited by his lessons. If his daughter's like him--and she's not like\nher mother--he was darkly and dangerously handsome. So I venture rapidly\nto reconstruct the situation.\"\n\nA silence, for the moment, had fallen on Lady Agnes and her other two\nchildren, so that Mr. Nash, with his universal urbanity, practically\naddressed these last remarks to them as well as to his other auditors.\nLady Agnes looked as if she wondered whom he was talking about, and\nhaving caught the name of a noble residence she inquired: \"Castle\nNugent--where in the world's that?\"\n\n\"It's a domain of immeasurable extent and almost inconceivable\nsplendour, but I fear not to be found in any prosaic earthly geography!\"\nLady Agnes rested her eyes on the tablecloth as if she weren't sure a\nliberty had not been taken with her, or at least with her \"order,\" and\nwhile Mr. Nash continued to abound in descriptive suppositions--\"It must\nbe on the banks of the Manzanares or the Guadalquivir\"--Peter\nSherringham, whose imagination had seemingly been kindled by the sketch\nof Miriam Rooth, took up the argument and reminded him that he had a\nshort time before assigned a low place to the dramatic art and had not\nyet answered the question as to whether he believed in the theatre.\nWhich gave the speaker a further chance. \"I don't know that I understand\nyour question; there are different ways of taking it. Do I think it's\nimportant? Is that what you mean? Important certainly to managers and\nstage-carpenters who want to make money, to ladies and gentlemen who\nwant to produce themselves in public by limelight, and to other ladies\nand gentlemen who are bored and stupid and don't know what to do with\ntheir evening. It's a commercial and social convenience which may be\ninfinitely worked. But important artistically, intellectually? How _can_\nit be--so poor, so limited a form?\"\n\n\"Upon my honour it strikes me as rich and various! Do _you_ think it's a\npoor and limited form, Nick?\" Sherringham added, appealing to his\nkinsman.\n\n\"I think whatever Nash thinks. I've no opinion to-day but his.\"\n\nThis answer of the hope of the Dormers drew the eyes of his mother and\nsisters to him and caused his friend to exclaim that he wasn't used to\nsuch responsibilities--so few people had ever tested his presence of\nmind by agreeing with him. \"Oh I used to be of your way of feeling,\"\nNash went on to Sherringham. \"I understand you perfectly. It's a phase\nlike another. I've been through it--_j'ai \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 comme \u00c3\u00a7a._\"\n\n\"And you went then very often to the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, and it was there\nI saw you. I place you now.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I noticed none of the other spectators,\" Nash explained. \"I\nhad no attention but for the great Carr\u00c3\u00a9--she was still on the stage.\nJudge of my infatuation, and how I can allow for yours, when I tell you\nthat I sought her acquaintance, that I couldn't rest till I had told her\nhow I hung upon her lips.\"\n\n\"That's just what _I_ told her,\" Sherringham returned.\n\n\"She was very kind to me. She said: '_Vous me rendez des forces_.'\"\n\n\"That's just what she said to me!\"\n\n\"And we've remained very good friends.\"\n\n\"So have we!\" laughed Sherringham. \"And such perfect art as hers--do you\nmean to say you don't consider _that_ important, such a rare dramatic\nintelligence?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you read the _feuilletons_. You catch their phrases\"--Nash\nspoke with pity. \"Dramatic intelligence is never rare; nothing's more\ncommon.\"\n\n\"Then why have we so many shocking actors?\"\n\n\"Have we? I thought they were mostly good; succeeding more easily and\nmore completely in that business than in anything else. What could they\ndo--those people generally--if they didn't do that poor thing? And\nreflect that the poor thing enables them to succeed! Of course, always,\nthere are numbers of people on the stage who are no actors at all, for\nit's even easier to our poor humanity to be ineffectively stupid and\nvulgar than to bring down the house.\"\n\n\"It's not easy, by what I can see, to produce, completely, any artistic\neffect,\" Sherringham declared; \"and those the actor produces are among\nthe most momentous we know. You'll not persuade me that to watch such an\nactress as Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 wasn't an education of the taste, an enlargement\nof one's knowledge.\"\n\n\"She did what she could, poor woman, but in what belittling, coarsening\nconditions! She had to interpret a character in a play, and a character\nin a play--not to say the whole piece: I speak more particularly of\nmodern pieces--is such a wretchedly small peg to hang anything on! The\ndramatist shows us so little, is so hampered by his audience, is\nrestricted to so poor an analysis.\"\n\n\"I know the complaint. It's all the fashion now. The _raffin\u00c3\u00a9s_ despise\nthe theatre,\" said Peter Sherringham in the manner of a man abreast with\nthe culture of his age and not to be captured by a surprise. \"_Connu,\nconnu_!\"\n\n\"It will be known better yet, won't it? when the essentially brutal\nnature of the modern audience is still more perceived, when it has been\nproperly analysed: the _omnium gatherum_ of the population of a big\ncommercial city at the hour of the day when their taste is at its\nlowest, flocking out of hideous hotels and restaurants, gorged with\nfood, stultified with buying and selling and with all the other sordid\npreoccupations of the age, squeezed together in a sweltering mass,\ndisappointed in their seats, timing the author, timing the actor,\nwishing to get their money back on the spot--all before eleven o'clock.\nFancy putting the exquisite before such a tribunal as that! There's not\neven a question of it. The dramatist wouldn't if he could, and in nine\ncases out of ten he couldn't if he would. He has to make the basest\nconcessions. One of his principal canons is that he must enable his\nspectators to catch the suburban trains, which stop at 11.30. What would\nyou think of any other artist--the painter or the novelist--whose\ngoverning forces should be the dinner and the suburban trains? The old\ndramatists didn't defer to them--not so much at least--and that's why\nthey're less and less actable. If they're touched--the large loose\nmen--it's only to be mutilated and trivialised. Besides, they had a\nsimpler civilisation to represent--societies in which the life of man\nwas in action, in passion, in immediate and violent expression. Those\nthings could be put upon the playhouse boards with comparatively little\nsacrifice of their completeness and their truth. To-day we're so\ninfinitely more reflective and complicated and diffuse that it makes all\nthe difference. What can you do with a character, with an idea, with a\nfeeling, between dinner and the suburban trains? You can give a gross,\nrough sketch of them, but how little you touch them, how bald you leave\nthem! What crudity compared with what the novelist does!\"\n\n\"Do you write novels, Mr. Nash?\" Peter candidly asked.\n\n\"No, but I read them when they're extraordinarily good, and I don't go\nto plays. I read Balzac for instance--I encounter the admirable portrait\nof Val\u00c3\u00a9rie Marneffe in _La Cousine Bette_.\"\n\n\"And you contrast it with the poverty of Emile Augier's S\u00c3\u00a9raphine in\n_Les Lionnes Pauvres_? I was awaiting you there. That's the _cheval de\nbataille_ of you fellows.\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary discussion! What dreadful authors!\" Lady Agnes\nmurmured to her son. But he was listening so attentively to the other\nyoung men that he made no response, and Peter Sherringham went on:\n\n\"I've seen Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 in things of the modern repertory, which she has\nmade as vivid to me, caused to abide as ineffaceably in my memory, as\nVal\u00c3\u00a9rie Marneffe. She's the Balzac, as one may say, of actresses.\"\n\n\"The miniaturist, as it were, of whitewashers!\" Nash offered as a\nsubstitute.\n\nIt might have been guessed that Sherringham resented his damned freedom,\nyet could but emulate his easy form. \"You'd be magnanimous if you\nthought the young lady you've introduced to our old friend would be\nimportant.\"\n\nMr. Nash lightly weighed it. \"She might be much more so than she ever\nwill be.\"\n\nLady Agnes, however, got up to terminate the scene and even to signify\nthat enough had been said about people and questions she had never so\nmuch as heard of. Every one else rose, the waiter brought Nicholas the\nreceipt of the bill, and Sherringham went on, to his interlocutor:\n\"Perhaps she'll be more so than you think.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--if you take an interest in her!\"\n\n\"A mystic voice seems to exhort me to do so, to whisper that though I've\nnever seen her I shall find something in her.\" On which Peter appealed.\n\"What do you say, Biddy--shall I take an interest in her?\"\n\nThe girl faltered, coloured a little, felt a certain embarrassment in\nbeing publicly treated as an oracle. \"If she's not nice I don't advise\nit.\"\n\n\"And if she _is_ nice?\"\n\n\"You advise it still less!\" her brother exclaimed, laughing and putting\nhis arm round her.\n\nLady Agnes looked sombre--she might have been saying to herself: \"Heaven\nhelp us, what chance has a girl of mine with a man who's so agog about\nactresses?\" She was disconcerted and distressed; a multitude of\nincongruous things, all the morning, had been forced upon her\nattention--displeasing pictures and still more displeasing theories\nabout them, vague portents of perversity on Nick's part and a strange\neagerness on Peter's, learned apparently in Paris, to discuss, with a\nperson who had a tone she never had been exposed to, topics irrelevant\nand uninteresting, almost disgusting, the practical effect of which was\nto make light of her presence. \"Let us leave this--let us leave this!\"\nshe grimly said. The party moved together toward the door of departure,\nand her ruffled spirit was not soothed by hearing her son remark to his\nterrible friend: \"You know you don't escape me; I stick to you!\"\n\nAt this Lady Agnes broke out and interposed. \"Pardon my reminding you\nthat you're going to call on Julia.\"\n\n\"Well, can't Nash also come to call on Julia? That's just what I\nwant--that she should see him.\"\n\nPeter Sherringham came humanely to his kinswoman's assistance. \"A better\nway perhaps will be for them to meet under my auspices at my 'dramatic\ntea.' This will enable me to return one favour for another. If Mr. Nash\nis so good as to introduce me to this aspirant for honours we estimate\nso differently, I'll introduce him to my sister, a much more positive\nquantity.\"\n\n\"It's easy to see who'll have the best of it!\" Grace Dormer declared;\nwhile Nash stood there serenely, impartially, in a graceful detached way\nwhich seemed characteristic of him, assenting to any decision that\nrelieved him of the grossness of choice and generally confident that\nthings would turn out well for him. He was cheerfully helpless and\nsociably indifferent; ready to preside with a smile even at a\ndiscussion of his own admissibility.\n\n\"Nick will bring you. I've a little corner at the embassy,\" Sherringham\ncontinued.\n\n\"You're very kind. You must bring _him_ then to-morrow--Rue de\nConstantinople.\"\n\n\"At five o'clock--don't be afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" Biddy wailed as they went on again and Lady Agnes, seizing\nhis arm, marched off more quickly with her son. When they came out into\nthe Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es Nick Dormer, looking round, saw his friend had\ndisappeared. Biddy had attached herself to Peter, and Grace couldn't\nhave encouraged Mr. Nash.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nLady Agnes's idea had been that her son should go straight from the\nPalais de l'Industrie to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Hollande, with or without his\nmother and his sisters as his humour should seem to recommend. Much as\nshe desired to see their valued Julia, and as she knew her daughters\ndesired it, she was quite ready to put off their visit if this sacrifice\nshould contribute to a speedy confrontation for Nick. She was anxious he\nshould talk with Mrs. Dallow, and anxious he should be anxious himself;\nbut it presently appeared that he was conscious of no pressure of\neagerness. His view was that she and the girls should go to their cousin\nwithout delay and should, if they liked, spend the rest of the day in\nher society. He would go later; he would go in the evening. There were\nlots of things he wanted to do meanwhile.\n\nThis question was discussed with some intensity, though not at length,\nwhile the little party stood on the edge of the Place de la Concorde, to\nwhich they had proceeded on foot; and Lady Agnes noticed that the \"lots\nof things\" to which he proposed to give precedence over an urgent duty,\na conference with a person who held out full hands to him, were implied\nsomehow in the friendly glance with which he covered the great square,\nthe opposite bank of the Seine, the steep blue roofs of the quay, the\nbright immensity of Paris. What in the world could be more important\nthan making sure of his seat?--so quickly did the good lady's\nimagination travel. And now that idea appealed to him less than a ramble\nin search of old books and prints--since she was sure this was what he\nhad in his head. Julia would be flattered should she know it, but of\ncourse she mustn't know it. Lady Agnes was already thinking of the least\ninjurious account she could give of the young man's want of\nprecipitation. She would have liked to represent him as tremendously\noccupied, in his room at their own hotel, in getting off political\nletters to every one it should concern, and particularly in drawing up\nhis address to the electors of Harsh. Fortunately she was a woman of\ninnumerable discretions, and a part of the worn look that sat in her\nface came from her having schooled herself for years, in commerce with\nher husband and her sons, not to insist unduly. She would have liked to\ninsist, nature had formed her to insist, and the self-control had told\nin more ways than one. Even now it was powerless to prevent her\nsuggesting that before doing anything else Nick should at least repair\nto the inn and see if there weren't some telegrams.\n\nHe freely consented to do as much as this, and, having called a cab that\nshe might go her way with the girls, kissed her again as he had done at\nthe exhibition. This was an attention that could never displease her,\nbut somehow when he kissed her she was really the more worried: she had\ncome to recognise it as a sign that he was slipping away from her, and\nshe wished she might frankly take it as his clutch at her to save him.\nShe drove off with a vague sense that at any rate she and the girls\nmight do something toward keeping the place warm for him. She had been a\nlittle vexed that Peter had not administered more of a push toward the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de Hollande, clear as it had become to her now that there was a\nforeignness in Peter which was not to be counted on and which made him\nspeak of English affairs and even of English domestic politics as local\nand even \"funny.\" They were very grandly local, and if one recalled, in\npublic life, an occasional droll incident wasn't that, liberally viewed,\njust the warm human comfort of them? As she left the two young men\nstanding together in the middle of the Place de la Concorde, the grand\ncomposition of which Nick, as she looked back, appeared to have paused\nto admire--as if he hadn't seen it a thousand times!--she wished she\nmight have thought of Peter's influence with her son as exerted a little\nmore in favour of localism. She had a fear he wouldn't abbreviate the\nboy's ill-timed _fl\u00c3\u00a2nerie_. However, he had been very nice: he had\ninvited them all to dine with him that evening at a convenient caf\u00c3\u00a9,\npromising to bring Julia and one of his colleagues. So much as this he\nhad been willing to do to make sure Nick and his sister should meet. His\nwant of localism, moreover, was not so great as that if it should turn\nout that there _was_ anything beneath his manner toward Biddy--! The\nupshot of this reflexion might have been represented by the circumstance\nof her ladyship's remarking after a minute to her younger daughter, who\nsat opposite her in the _voiture de place_, that it would do no harm if\nshe should get a new hat and that the search might be instituted that\nafternoon.\n\n\"A French hat, mamma?\" said Grace. \"Oh do wait till she gets home!\"\n\n\"I think they're really prettier here, you know,\" Biddy opined; and Lady\nAgnes said simply: \"I daresay they're cheaper.\" What was in her mind in\nfact was: \"I daresay Peter thinks them becoming.\" It will be seen she\nhad plenty of inward occupation, the sum of which was not lessened by\nher learning when she reached the top of the Rue de la Paix that Mrs.\nDallow had gone out half an hour before and had left no message. She was\nmore disconcerted by this incident than she could have explained or than\nshe thought was right, as she had taken for granted Julia would be in a\nmanner waiting for them. How could she be sure Nick wasn't coming? When\npeople were in Paris a few days they didn't mope in the house, but she\nmight have waited a little longer or have left an explanation. Was she\nthen not so much in earnest about Nick's standing? Didn't she recognise\nthe importance of being there to see him about it? Lady Agnes wondered\nif her behaviour were a sign of her being already tired of the way this\nyoung gentleman treated her. Perhaps she had gone out because an\ninstinct told her that the great propriety of their meeting early would\nmake no difference with him--told her he wouldn't after all come. His\nmother's heart sank as she glanced at this possibility that their\nprecious friend was already tired, she having on her side an intuition\nthat there were still harder things in store. She had disliked having to\ntell Mrs. Dallow that Nick wouldn't see her till the evening, but now\nshe disliked still more her not being there to hear it. She even\nresented a little her kinswoman's not having reasoned that she and the\ngirls would come in any event, and not thought them worth staying in\nfor. It came up indeed that she would perhaps have gone to their hotel,\nwhich was a good way up the Rue de Rivoli, near the Palais Royal--on\nwhich the cabman was directed to drive to that establishment.\n\nAs he jogged along she took in some degree the measure of what that\nmight mean, Julia's seeking a little to avoid them. Was she growing to\ndislike them? Did she think they kept too sharp an eye on her, so that\nthe idea of their standing in a still closer relation wouldn't be\nenticing? Her conduct up to this time had not worn such an appearance,\nunless perhaps a little, just a very little, in the matter of her ways\nwith poor Grace. Lady Agnes knew she wasn't particularly fond of poor\nGrace, and could even sufficiently guess the reason--the manner in which\nGrace betrayed most how they wanted to make sure of her. She remembered\nhow long the girl had stayed the last time she had been at Harsh--going\nfor an acceptable week and dragging out her visit to a month. She took a\nprivate heroic vow that Grace shouldn't go near the place again for a\nyear; not, that is, unless Nick and Julia were married within the time.\nIf that were to happen she shouldn't care. She recognised that it wasn't\nabsolutely everything Julia should be in love with Nick; it was also\nbetter she should dislike his mother and sisters after a probable\npursuit of him than before. Lady Agnes did justice to the natural rule\nin virtue of which it usually comes to pass that a woman doesn't get on\nwith her husband's female belongings, and was even willing to be\nsacrificed to it in her disciplined degree. But she desired not to be\nsacrificed for nothing: if she was to be objected to as a mother-in-law\nshe wished to be the mother-in-law first.\n\nAt the hotel in the Rue de Rivoli she had the disappointment of finding\nthat Mrs. Dallow had not called, and also that no telegrams had come.\nShe went in with the girls for half an hour and then straggled out with\nthem again. She was undetermined and dissatisfied and the afternoon was\nrather a problem; of the kind, moreover, that she disliked most and was\nleast accustomed to: not a choice between different things to do--her\nlife had been full of that--but a want of anything to do at all. Nick\nhad said to her before they separated: \"You can knock about with the\ngirls, you know; everything's amusing here.\" That was easily said while\nhe sauntered and gossiped with Peter Sherringham and perhaps went to\nsee more pictures like those in the Salon. He was usually, on such\noccasions, very good-natured about spending his time with them; but this\nepisode had taken altogether a perverse, profane form. She had no desire\nwhatever to knock about and was far from finding everything in Paris\namusing. She had no aptitude for aimlessness, and moreover thought it\nvulgar. If she had found Julia's card at the hotel--the sign of a hope\nof catching them just as they came back from the Salon--she would have\nmade a second attempt to see her before the evening; but now certainly\nthey would leave her alone. Lady Agnes wandered joylessly with the girls\nin the Palais Royal and the Rue de Richelieu, and emerged upon the\nBoulevard, where they continued their frugal prowl, as Biddy rather\nirritatingly called it. They went into five shops to buy a hat for\nBiddy, and her ladyship's presumptions of cheapness were woefully\nbelied.\n\n\"Who in the world's your comic friend?\" Peter Sherringham was meanwhile\nasking of his kinsman as they walked together.\n\n\"Ah there's something else you lost by going to Cambridge--you lost\nGabriel Nash!\"\n\n\"He sounds like an Elizabethan dramatist,\" Sherringham said. \"But I\nhaven't lost him, since it appears now I shan't be able to have you\nwithout him.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, wait a little. I'm going to try him again, but I don't\nknow how he wears. What I mean is that you've probably lost his\nfreshness, which was the great thing. I rather fear he's becoming\nconventional, or at any rate serious.\"\n\n\"Bless me, do you call that serious?\"\n\n\"He used to be so gay. He had a real genius for playing with ideas. He\nwas a wonderful talker.\"\n\n\"It seems to me he does very well now,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\n\"Oh this is nothing. He had great flights of old, very great flights;\none saw him rise and rise and turn somersaults in the blue--one wondered\nhow far he could go. He's very intelligent, and I should think it might\nbe interesting to find out what it is that prevents the whole man from\nbeing as good as his parts. I mean in case he isn't so good.\"\n\n\"I see you more than suspect that. Mayn't it be simply that he's too\ngreat an ass?\"\n\n\"That would be the whole--I shall see in time--but it certainly isn't\none of the parts. It may be the effect, but it isn't the cause, and it's\nfor the cause I claim an interest. Do you think him an ass for what he\nsaid about the theatre--his pronouncing it a coarse art?\"\n\n\"To differ from you about him that reason would do,\" said Sherringham.\n\"The only bad one would be one that shouldn't preserve our difference.\nYou needn't tell me you agree with him, for frankly I don't care.\"\n\n\"Then your passion still burns?\" Nick Dormer asked.\n\n\"My passion--?\"\n\n\"I don't mean for any individual exponent of the equivocal art: mark the\nguilty conscience, mark the rising blush, mark the confusion of mind! I\nmean the old sign one knew you best by; your permanent stall at the\nFran\u00c3\u00a7ais, your inveterate attendance at _premi\u00c3\u00a8res_, the way you\n'follow' the young talents and the old.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's still my little hobby, my little folly if you like,\"\nSherringham said. \"I don't find I get tired of it. What will you have?\nStrong predilections are rather a blessing; they're simplifying. I'm\nfond of representation--the representation of life: I like it better, I\nthink, than the real thing. You like it too, you'd be ready in other\nconditions to go in for it, in your way--so you've no right to cast the\nstone. You like it best done by one vehicle and I by another; and our\npreference on either side has a deep root in us. There's a fascination\nto me in the way the actor does it, when his talent--ah he must have\nthat!--has been highly trained. Ah it must _be_ that! The things he can\ndo in this effort at representation, with the dramatist to back him,\nseem to me innumerable--he can carry it to a point!--and I take great\npleasure in observing them, in recognising and comparing them. It's an\namusement like another--I don't pretend to call it by any exalted name,\nbut in this vale of friction it will serve. One can lose one's self in\nit, and it has the recommendation--in common, I suppose, with the study\nof the other arts--that the further you go in it the more you find. So I\ngo rather far, if you will. But is it the principal sign one knows me\nby?\" Peter abruptly asked.\n\n\"Don't be ashamed of it,\" Nick returned--\"else it will be ashamed of\nyou. I ought to discriminate. You're distinguished among my friends and\nrelations by your character of rising young diplomatist; but you know I\nalways want the final touch to the picture, the last fruit of analysis.\nTherefore I make out that you're conspicuous among rising young\ndiplomatists for the infatuation you describe in such pretty terms.\"\n\n\"You evidently believe it will prevent my ever rising very high. But\npastime for pastime is it any idler than yours?\"\n\n\"Than mine?\"\n\n\"Why you've half-a-dozen while I only allow myself the luxury of one.\nFor the theatre's my sole vice, really. Is this more wanton, say, than\nto devote weeks to the consideration of the particular way in which your\nfriend Mr. Nash may be most intensely a twaddler and a bore? That's not\nmy ideal of choice recreation, but I'd undertake to satisfy you about\nhim sooner. You're a young statesman--who happens to be an _en\ndisponibilit\u00c3\u00a9_ for the moment--but you spend not a little of your time\nin besmearing canvas with bright-coloured pigments. The idea of\nrepresentation fascinates you, but in your case it's representation in\noils--or do you practise water-colours and pastel too? You even go much\nfurther than I, for I study my art of predilection only in the works of\nothers. I don't aspire to leave works of my own. You're a painter,\npossibly a great one; but I'm not an actor.\" Nick Dormer declared he\nwould certainly become one--he was so well on the way to it; and\nSherringham, without heeding this charge, went on: \"Let me add that,\nconsidering you _are_ a painter, your portrait of the complicated Nash\nis lamentably dim.\"\n\n\"He's not at all complicated; he's only too simple to give an account\nof. Most people have a lot of attributes and appendages that dress them\nup and superscribe them, and what I like Gabriel for is that he hasn't\nany at all. It makes him, it keeps him, so refreshingly cool.\"\n\n\"By Jove, you match him there! Isn't it an appendage and an attribute to\nescape kicking? How does he manage that?\" Sherringham asked.\n\n\"I haven't the least idea--I don't know that he doesn't rouse the\nkicking impulse. Besides, he can kick back and I don't think any one has\never seen him duck or dodge. His means, his profession, his belongings\nhave never anything to do with the question. He doesn't shade off into\nother people; he's as neat as an outline cut out of paper with scissors.\nI like him, therefore, because in dealing with him you know what you've\ngot hold of. With most men you don't: to pick the flower you must break\noff the whole dusty, thorny, worldly branch; you find you're taking up\nin your grasp all sorts of other people and things, dangling accidents\nand conditions. Poor Nash has none of those encumbrances: he's the\nsolitary-fragrant blossom.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you'd be better for a little of the same pruning!\"\nSherringham retorted; and the young men continued their walk and their\ngossip, jerking each other this way and that, punching each other here\nand there, with an amicable roughness consequent on their having, been\nboys together. Intimacy had reigned of old between the little\nSherringhams and the little Dormers, united in the country by ease of\nneighbouring and by the fact that there was first cousinship, not\nneglected, among the parents, Lady Agnes standing in this plastic\nrelation to Lady Windrush, the mother of Peter and Julia as well as of\nother daughters and of a maturer youth who was to inherit, and who since\nthen had inherited, the ancient barony. Many things had altered later\non, but not the good reasons for not explaining. One of our young men\nhad gone to Eton and the other to Harrow--the scattered school on the\nhill was the tradition of the Dormers--and the divergence had rather\ntaken its course in university years. Bricket, however, had remained\naccessible to Windrush, and Windrush to Bricket, to which estate\nPercival Dormer had now succeeded, terminating the interchange a trifle\nrudely by letting out that pleasant white house in the midlands--its\nexpropriated inhabitants, Lady Agnes and her daughters, adored it--to an\nAmerican reputed rich, who in the first flush of his sense of contrasts\nconsidered that for twelve hundred a year he got it at a bargain.\nBricket had come to the late Sir Nicholas from his elder brother, dying\nwifeless and childless. The new baronet, so different from his\nfather--though recalling at some points the uncle after whom he had\nbeen named--that Nick had to make it up by cultivating conformity,\nroamed about the world, taking shots which excited the enthusiasm of\nsociety, when society heard of them, at the few legitimate creatures of\nthe chase the British rifle had up to that time spared. Lady Agnes\nmeanwhile settled with her girls in a gabled, latticed house in a\nmentionable quarter, though it still required a little explaining, of\nthe temperate zone of London. It was not into her lap, poor woman, that\nthe revenues of Bricket were poured. There was no dower-house attached\nto that moderate property, and the allowance with which the estate was\ncharged on her ladyship's behalf was not an incitement to grandeur.\n\nNick had a room under his mother's roof, which he mainly used to dress\nfor dinner when dining in Calcutta Gardens, and he had \"kept on\" his\nchambers in the Temple; for to a young man in public life an independent\naddress was indispensable. Moreover, he was suspected of having a studio\nin an out-of-the-way district, the indistinguishable parts of South\nKensington, incongruous as such a retreat might seem in the case of a\nmember of Parliament. It was an absurd place to see his constituents\nunless he wanted to paint their portraits, a kind of \"representation\"\nwith which they would scarce have been satisfied; and in fact the only\nquestion of portraiture had been when the wives and daughters of several\nof them expressed a wish for the picture of their handsome young member.\nNick had not offered to paint it himself, and the studio was taken for\ngranted rather than much looked into by the ladies in Calcutta Gardens.\nToo express a disposition to regard whims of this sort as extravagance\npure and simple was known by them to be open to correction; for they\nwere not oblivious that Mr. Carteret had humours which weighed against\nthem in the shape of convenient cheques nestling between the inside\npages of legible letters of advice. Mr. Carteret was Nick's providence,\njust as Nick was looked to, in a general way, to be that of his mother\nand sisters, especially since it had become so plain that Percy, who was\nnot subtly selfish, would operate, mainly with a \"six-bore,\" quite out\nof that sphere. It was not for studios certainly that Mr. Carteret sent\ncheques; but they were an expression of general confidence in Nick, and\na little expansion was natural to a young man enjoying such a luxury as\nthat. It was sufficiently felt in Calcutta Gardens that he could be\nlooked to not to betray such confidence; for Mr. Carteret's behaviour\ncould have no name at all unless one were prepared to call it\nencouraging. He had never promised anything, but he was one of the\ndelightful persons with whom the redemption precedes or dispenses with\nthe vow. He had been an early and lifelong friend of the late right\nhonourable gentleman, a political follower, a devoted admirer, a stanch\nsupporter in difficult hours. He had never married, espousing nothing\nmore reproductive than Sir Nicholas's views--he used to write letters to\nthe _Times_ in favour of them--and had, so far as was known, neither\nchick nor child; nothing but an amiable little family of eccentricities,\nthe flower of which was his odd taste for living in a small, steep,\nclean country town, all green gardens and red walls with a girdle of\nhedge-rows, all clustered about an immense brown old abbey. When Lady\nAgnes's imagination rested upon the future of her second son she liked\nto remember that Mr. Carteret had nothing to \"keep up\": the inference\nseemed so direct that he would keep up Nick.\n\nThe most important event in the life of this young man had been\nincomparably his success, under his father's eyes, more than two years\nbefore, in the sharp contest for Crockhurst--a victory which his\nconsecrated name, his extreme youth, his ardour in the fray, the marked\npersonal sympathy of the party, and the attention excited by the fresh\ncleverness of his speeches, tinted with young idealism and yet sticking\nsufficiently to the question--the burning question which has since\nburned out--had made quite splendid. There had been leaders in the\nnewspapers about it, half in compliment to her husband, who was known to\nbe failing so prematurely--he was almost as young to die, and to die\nfamous, for Lady Agnes regarded it as famous, as his son had been to\nstand--tributes the boy's mother religiously preserved, cut out and tied\ntogether with a ribbon, in the innermost drawer of a favourite cabinet.\nBut it had been a barren, or almost a barren triumph, for in the order\nof importance in Nick's history another incident had run it, as the\nphrase is, very close: nothing less than the quick dissolution of the\nParliament in which he was so manifestly destined to give symptoms of a\nfuture. He had not recovered his seat at the general election, for the\nsecond contest was even sharper than the first and the Tories had put\nforward a loud, vulgar, rattling, bullying, money-spending man. It was\nto a certain extent a comfort that poor Sir Nicholas, who had been\nwitness of the bright hour, should have passed away before the darkness.\nHe died with all his hopes on his second son's head, unconscious of near\ndisappointment, handing on the torch and the tradition, after a long,\nsupreme interview with Nick at which Lady Agnes had not been present,\nbut which she knew to have been a thorough paternal dedication, an\naugust communication of ideas on the highest national questions (she had\nreason to believe he had touched on those of external as well as of\ndomestic and of colonial policy) leaving on the boy's nature and manner\nfrom that moment the most unmistakable traces. If his tendency to\nreverie increased it was because he had so much to think over in what\nhis pale father had said to him in the hushed dim chamber, laying on him\nthe great mission that death had cut short, breathing into him with\nunforgettable solemnity the very accents--Sir Nicholas's voice had been\nwonderful for richness--that he was to sound again. It was work cut out\nfor a lifetime, and that \"co-ordinating power in relation to detail\"\nwhich was one of the great characteristics of the lamented statesman's\nhigh distinction--the most analytic of the weekly papers was always\ntalking about it--had enabled him to rescue the prospect from any shade\nof vagueness or of ambiguity.\n\nFive years before Nick Dormer went up to be questioned by the electors\nof Crockhurst Peter Sherringham had appeared before a board of examiners\nwho let him off much less easily, though there were also some flattering\nprejudices in his favour; such influences being a part of the copious,\nlight, unembarrassing baggage with which each of the young men began\nlife. Peter passed, however, passed high, and had his reward in prompt\nassignment to small, subordinate, diplomatic duties in Germany. Since\nthen he had had his professional adventures, which need not arrest us,\ninasmuch as they had all paled in the light of his appointment, nearly\nthree years previous to the moment of our making his acquaintance, to a\nsecretaryship of embassy in Paris. He had done well and had gone fast\nand for the present could draw his breath at ease. It pleased him better\nto remain in Paris as a subordinate than to go to Honduras as a\nprincipal, and Nick Dormer had not put a false colour on the matter in\nspeaking of his stall at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais as a sedative to his\nambition. Nick's inferiority in age to his cousin sat on him more\nlightly than when they had been in their teens; and indeed no one can\nvery well be much older than a young man who has figured for a year,\nhowever imperceptibly, in the House of Commons. Separation and diversity\nhad made them reciprocally strange enough to give a price to what they\nshared; they were friends without being particular friends; that further\ndegree could always hang before them as a suitable but not oppressive\ncontingency, and they were both conscious that it was in their interest\nto keep certain differences to \"chaff\" each other about--so possible was\nit that they might have quarrelled if they had had everything in common.\nPeter, as being wide-minded, was a little irritated to find his cousin\nalways so intensely British, while Nick Dormer made him the object of\nthe same compassionate criticism, recognised in him a rare knack with\nforeign tongues, but reflected, and even with extravagance declared,\nthat it was a pity to have gone so far from home only to remain so\nhomely. Moreover, Nick had his ideas about the diplomatic mind, finding\nin it, for his own sympathy, always the wrong turn. Dry, narrow, barren,\npoor he pronounced it in familiar conversation with the clever\nsecretary; wanting in imagination, in generosity, in the finest\nperceptions and the highest courage. This served as well as anything\nelse to keep the peace between them; it was a necessity of their\nfriendly intercourse that they should scuffle a little, and it scarcely\nmattered what they scuffled about. Nick Dormer's express enjoyment of\nParis, the shop-windows on the quays, the old books on the parapet, the\ngaiety of the river, the grandeur of the Louvre, every fine feature of\nthat prodigious face, struck his companion as a sign of insularity; the\nappreciation of such things having become with Sherringham an\nunconscious habit, a contented assimilation. If poor Nick, for the\nhour, was demonstrative and lyrical, it was because he had no other way\nof sounding the note of farewell to the independent life of which the\nterm seemed now definitely in sight--the sense so pressed upon him that\nthese were the last moments of his freedom. He would waste time till\nhalf-past seven, because half-past seven meant dinner, and dinner meant\nhis mother solemnly attended by the strenuous shade of his father and\nre-enforced by Julia.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nWhen he arrived with the three members of his family at the restaurant\nof their choice Peter Sherringham was already seated there by one of the\nimmaculate tables, but Mrs. Dallow was not yet on the scene, and they\nhad time for a sociable settlement--time to take their places and unfold\ntheir napkins, crunch their rolls, breathe the savoury air, and watch\nthe door, before the usual raising of heads and suspension of forks, the\nsort of stir that accompanied most of this lady's movements, announced\nher entrance. The _dame de comptoir_ ducked and re-ducked, the people\nlooked round, Peter and Nick got up, there was a shuffling of\nchairs--Julia had come. Peter was relating how he had stopped at her\nhotel to bring her with him and had found her, according to her custom,\nby no means ready; on which, fearing his guests would arrive first at\nthe rendezvous and find no proper welcome, he had come off without her,\nleaving her to follow. He had not brought a friend, as he intended,\nhaving divined that Julia would prefer a pure family party if she wanted\nto talk about her candidate. Now she stood looking down at the table and\nher expectant kinsfolk, drawing off her gloves, letting her brother draw\noff her jacket, lifting her hands for some rearrangement of her hat. She\nlooked at Nick last, smiling, but only for a moment. She said to Peter:\n\"Are we going to dine here? Oh dear, why didn't you have a private\nroom?\"\n\nNick had not seen her at all for several weeks and had seen her but\nlittle for a year, but her off-hand cursory manner had not altered in\nthe interval. She spoke remarkably fast, as if speech were not in itself\na pleasure--to have it over as soon as possible; and her _brusquerie_\nwas of the dark shade friendly critics account for by pleading shyness.\nShyness had never appeared to him an ultimate quality or a real\nexplanation of anything; it only explained an effect by another effect,\nneither with a cause to boast of. What he suspected in Julia was that\nher mind was less pleasing than her person; an ugly, a really blighting\nidea, which as yet he had but half accepted. It was a case in which she\nwas entitled to the benefit of every doubt and oughtn't to be judged\nwithout a complete trial. Nick meanwhile was afraid of the trial--this\nwas partly why he had been of late to see her so little--because he was\nafraid of the sentence, afraid of anything that might work to lessen the\ncharm it was actually in the power of her beauty to shed. There were\npeople who thought her rude, and he hated rude women. If he should\nfasten on that view, or rather if that view should fasten on him, what\ncould still please and what he admired in her would lose too much of its\nsweetness. If it be thought odd that he had not yet been able to read\nthe character of a woman he had known since childhood the answer is that\nthis character had grown faster than Nick's observation. The growth was\nconstant, whereas the observation was but occasional, though it had\nbegun early. If he had attempted inwardly to phrase the matter, as he\nprobably had not, he might have pronounced the effect she produced upon\nhim too much a compulsion; not the coercion of design, of importunity,\nnor the vulgar pressure of family expectation, a betrayed desire he\nshould like her enough to marry her, but a mixture of divers urgent\nthings; of the sense that she was imperious and generous--probably more\nthe former than the latter--and of a certain prevision of doom, the\ninfluence of the idea that he should come to it, that he was\npredestined.\n\nThis had made him shrink from knowing the worst about her; not the wish\nto get used to it in time, but what was more characteristic of him, the\nwish to interpose a temporary illusion. Illusions and realities and\nhopes and fears, however, fell into confusion whenever he met her after\na separation. The separation, so far as seeing her alone or as\ncontinuous talk was concerned, had now been tolerably long; had lasted\nreally ever since his failure to regain his seat. An impression had come\nto him that she judged that failure rather stiffly, had thought, and had\nsomewhat sharply said, that he ought to have done better. This was a\npart of her imperious way, and a part not _all_ to be overlooked on a\nmere present basis. If he were to marry her he should come to an\nunderstanding with her: he should give her his own measure as well as\ntake hers. But the understanding might in the actual case suggest too\nmuch that he _was_ to marry her. You could quarrel with your wife\nbecause there were compensations--for her; but you mightn't be prepared\nto offer these compensations as prepayment for the luxury of\nquarrelling.\n\nIt was not that such a luxury wouldn't be considerable, our young man\nnone the less thought as Julia Dallow's fine head poised itself before\nhim again; a high spirit was of course better than a mawkish to be\nmismated with, any day in the year. She had much the same colour as her\nbrother, but as nothing else in her face was the same the resemblance\nwas not striking. Her hair was of so dark a brown that it was commonly\nregarded as black, and so abundant that a plain arrangement was required\nto keep it in natural relation to the rest of her person. Her eyes were\nof a grey sometimes pronounced too light, and were not sunken in her\nface, but placed well on the surface. Her nose was perfect, but her\nmouth was too small; and Nick Dormer, and doubtless other persons as\nwell, had sometimes wondered how with such a mouth her face could have\nexpressed decision. Her figure helped it, for she appeared tall--being\nextremely slender--yet was not; and her head took turns and positions\nwhich, though a matter of but half an inch out of the common this way or\nthat, somehow contributed to the air of resolution and temper. If it had\nnot been for her extreme delicacy of line and surface she might have\nbeen called bold; but as it was she looked refined and quiet--refined by\ntradition and quiet for a purpose. And altogether she was beautiful,\nwith the gravity of her elegant head, her hair like the depths of\ndarkness, her eyes like its earlier clearing, her mouth like a rare pink\nflower.\n\nPeter said he had not taken a private room because he knew Biddy's\ntastes; she liked to see the world--she had told him so--the curious\npeople, the coming and going of Paris. \"Oh anything for Biddy!\" Julia\nreplied, smiling at the girl and taking her place. Lady Agnes and her\nelder daughter exchanged one of their looks, and Nick exclaimed jocosely\nthat he didn't see why the whole party should be sacrificed to a\npresumptuous child. The presumptuous child blushingly protested she had\nnever expressed any such wish to Peter, upon which Nick, with broader\nhumour, revealed that Peter had served them so out of stinginess: he had\npitchforked them together in the public room because he wouldn't go to\nthe expense of a _cabinet_. He had brought no guest, no foreigner of\ndistinction nor diplomatic swell, to honour them, and now they would see\nwhat a paltry dinner he would give them. Peter stabbed him indignantly\nwith a long roll, and Lady Agnes, who seemed to be waiting for some\nmanifestation on Mrs. Dallow's part which didn't come, concluded, with a\ncertain coldness, that they quite sufficed to themselves for privacy as\nwell as for society. Nick called attention to this fine phrase of his\nmother's and said it was awfully neat, while Grace and Biddy looked\nharmoniously at Julia's clothes. Nick felt nervous and joked a good deal\nto carry it off--a levity that didn't prevent Julia's saying to him\nafter a moment: \"You might have come to see me to-day, you know. Didn't\nyou get my message from Peter?\"\n\n\"Scold him, Julia--scold him well. I begged him to go,\" said Lady Agnes;\nand to this Grace added her voice with an \"Oh Julia, do give it to him!\"\nThese words, however, had not the effect they suggested, since Mrs.\nDallow only threw off for answer, in her quick curt way, that that would\nbe making far too much of him. It was one of the things in her that Nick\nmentally pronounced ungraceful, the perversity of pride or of shyness\nthat always made her disappoint you a little if she saw you expected a\nthing. She snubbed effusiveness in a way that yet gave no interesting\nhint of any wish to keep it herself in reserve. Effusiveness, however,\ncertainly, was the last thing of which Lady Agnes would have consented\nto be accused; and Nick, while he replied to Julia that he was sure he\nshouldn't have found her, was not unable to perceive the operation on\nhis mother of that shade of manner. \"He ought to have gone; he owed you\nthat,\" she went on; \"but it's very true he would have had the same luck\nas we. I went with the girls directly after luncheon. I suppose you got\nour card.\"\n\n\"He might have come after I came in,\" said Mrs. Dallow.\n\n\"Dear Julia, I'm going to see you to-night. I've been waiting for that,\"\nNick returned.\n\n\"Of course _we_ had no idea when you'd come in,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. You must come to-morrow. I hate calls at night,\" Julia\nserenely added.\n\n\"Well then, will you roam with me? Will you wander through Paris on my\narm?\" Nick asked, smiling. \"Will you take a drive with me?\"\n\n\"Oh that would be perfection!\" cried Grace.\n\n\"I thought we were all going somewhere--to the Hippodrome, Peter,\" Biddy\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh not all; just you and me!\" laughed Peter.\n\n\"I'm going home to my bed. I've earned my rest,\" Lady Agnes sighed.\n\n\"Can't Peter take _us_?\" demanded Grace. \"Nick can take you home, mamma,\nif Julia won't receive him, and I can look perfectly after Peter and\nBiddy.\"\n\n\"Take them to something amusing; please take them,\" Mrs. Dallow said to\nher brother. Her voice was kind, but had the expectation of assent in\nit, and Nick observed both the good nature and the pressure. \"You're\ntired, poor dear,\" she continued to Lady Agnes. \"Fancy your being\ndragged about so! What did you come over for?\"\n\n\"My mother came because I brought her,\" Nick said. \"It's I who have\ndragged her about. I brought her for a little change. I thought it would\ndo her good. I wanted to see the Salon.\"\n\n\"It isn't a bad time. I've a carriage and you must use it; you must use\nnothing else. It shall take you everywhere. I'll drive you about\nto-morrow.\" Julia dropped these words with all her air of being able\nrather than of wanting; but Nick had already noted, and he noted now\nafresh and with pleasure, that her lack of unction interfered not a bit\nwith her always acting. It was quite sufficiently manifest to him that\nfor the rest of the time she might be near his mother she would do for\nher numberless good turns. She would give things to the girls--he had a\nprivate adumbration of that; expensive Parisian, perhaps not perfectly\nuseful, things.\n\nLady Agnes was a woman who measured outlays and returns, but she was\nboth too acute and too just not to recognise the scantest offer from\nwhich an advantage could proceed. \"Dear Julia!\" she exclaimed\nresponsively; and her tone made this brevity of acknowledgment adequate.\nJulia's own few words were all she wanted. \"It's so interesting about\nHarsh,\" she added. \"We're immensely excited.\"\n\n\"Yes, Nick looks it. _Merci, pas de vin_. It's just the thing for you,\nyou know,\" Julia said to him.\n\n\"To be sure he knows it. He's immensely grateful. It's really very kind\nof you.\"\n\n\"You do me a very great honour, Julia,\" Nick hastened to add.\n\n\"Don't be tiresome, please,\" that lady returned.\n\n\"We'll talk about it later. Of course there are lots of points,\" Nick\npursued. \"At present let's be purely convivial. Somehow Harsh is such a\nfalse note here. _Nous causerons de \u00c3\u00a7a_.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you've caught exactly the tone of Mr. Gabriel Nash,\"\nPeter Sherringham declared on this.\n\n\"Who's Mr. Gabriel Nash?\" Mrs. Dallow asked.\n\n\"Nick, is he a gentleman? Biddy says so,\" Grace Dormer interposed before\nthis inquiry was answered.\n\n\"It's to be supposed that any one Nick brings to lunch with us--!\" Lady\nAgnes rather coldly sighed.\n\n\"Ah Grace, with your tremendous standard!\" her son said; while Peter\nSherringham explained to his sister that Mr. Nash was Nick's new Mentor\nor oracle--whom, moreover, she should see if she would come and have tea\nwith him.\n\n\"I haven't the least desire to see him,\" Julia made answer, \"any more\nthan I have to talk about Harsh and bore poor Peter.\"\n\n\"Oh certainly, dear, you'd bore me,\" her brother rang out.\n\n\"One thing at a time then. Let us by all means be convivial. Only you\nmust show me how,\" Mrs. Dallow went on to Nick. \"What does he mean,\nCousin Agnes? Does he want us to drain the wine-cup, to flash with\nrepartee?\"\n\n\"You'll do very well,\" said Nick. \"You're thoroughly charming to-night.\"\n\n\"Do go to Peter's, Julia, if you want something exciting. You'll see a\nwonderful girl,\" Biddy broke in with her smile on Peter.\n\n\"Wonderful for what?\"\n\n\"For thinking she can act when she can't,\" said the roguish Biddy.\n\n\"Dear me, what people you all know! I hate Peter's theatrical people.\"\n\n\"And aren't you going home, Julia?\" Lady Agnes inquired.\n\n\"Home to the hotel?\"\n\n\"Dear, no, to Harsh--to see about everything.\"\n\n\"I'm in the midst of telegrams. I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"I suppose there's no doubt they'll have him,\" Lady Agnes decided to\npursue.\n\n\"Who'll have whom?\"\n\n\"Why, the local people and the party managers. I'm speaking of the\nquestion of my son's standing.\"\n\n\"They'll have the person I want them to have, I daresay. There are so\nmany people in it, in one way or another--it's dreadful. I like the way\nyou sit there,\" Julia went on to Nick.\n\n\"So do I,\" he smiled back at her; and he thought she _was_ charming now,\nbecause she was gay and easy and willing really, though she might plead\nincompetence, to understand how jocose a dinner in a pothouse in a\nforeign town might be. She was in good humour or was going to be, and\nnot grand nor stiff nor indifferent nor haughty nor any of the things\npeople who disliked her usually found her and sometimes even a little\nmade him believe her. The spirit of mirth in some cold natures manifests\nitself not altogether happily, their effort of recreation resembles too\nmuch the bath of the hippopotamus; but when Mrs. Dallow put her elbows\non the table one felt she could be trusted to get them safely off again.\n\nFor a family in mourning the dinner was lively; the more so that before\nit was half over Julia had arranged that her brother, eschewing the\ninferior spectacle, should take the girls to the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. It\nwas her idea, and Nick had a chance to observe how an idea was apt to be\nnot successfully controverted when it was Julia's. Even the programme\nappeared to have been prearranged to suit it, just the thing for the\ncheek of the young person--_Il ne Faut Jurer de Rien_ and _Mademoiselle\nde la Seigli\u00c3\u00a8re_. Peter was all willingness, but it was Julia who\nsettled it, even to sending for the newspaper--he was by a rare accident\nunconscious of the evening's bill--and to reassuring Biddy, who was\nhappy but anxious, on the article of their being too late for good\nplaces. Peter could always get good places: a word from him and the best\nbox was at his disposal. She made him write the word on a card and saw a\nmessenger despatched with it to the Rue de Richelieu; and all this\nwithout loudness or insistence, parenthetically and authoritatively. The\nbox was bespoken and the carriage, as soon as they had had their coffee,\nfound to be in attendance. Peter drove off in it with the girls,\nunderstanding that he was to send it back, and Nick waited for it over\nthe finished repast with the two ladies. After this his mother was\nescorted to it and conveyed to her apartments, and all the while it had\nbeen Julia who governed the succession of events. \"Do be nice to her,\"\nLady Agnes breathed to him as he placed her in the vehicle at the door\nof the caf\u00c3\u00a9; and he guessed it gave her a comfort to have left him\nsitting there with Mrs. Dallow.\n\nHe had every disposition to be nice to his charming cousin; if things\nwent as she liked them it was the proof of a certain fine force in\nher--the force of assuming they would. Julia had her differences--some\nof them were much for the better; and when she was in a mood like this\nevening's, liberally dominant, he was ready to encourage most of what\nshe took for granted. While they waited for the return of the carriage,\nwhich had rolled away with his mother, she sat opposite him with her\nelbows on the table, playing first with one and then with another of the\nobjects that encumbered it; after five minutes of which she exclaimed,\n\"Oh I say, well go!\" and got up abruptly, asking for her jacket. He said\nsomething about the carriage and its order to come back for them, and\nshe replied, \"Well, it can go away again. I don't want a carriage,\" she\nadded: \"I want to walk\"--and in a moment she was out of the place, with\nthe people at the tables turning round again and the _caissi\u00c3\u00a8re_ swaying\nin her high seat. On the pavement of the boulevard she looked up and\ndown; there were people at little tables by the door; there were people\nall over the broad expanse of the asphalt; there was a profusion of\nlight and a pervasion of sound; and everywhere, though the establishment\nat which they had been dining was not in the thick of the fray, the\ntokens of a great traffic of pleasure, that night-aspect of Paris which\nrepresents it as a huge market for sensations. Beyond the Boulevard des\nCapucines it flared through the warm evening like a vast bazaar, and\nopposite the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Durand the Madeleine rose theatrical, a high artful\n_d\u00c3\u00a9cor_ before the footlights of the Rue Royale. \"Where shall we go,\nwhat shall we do?\" Mrs. Dallow asked, looking at her companion and\nsomewhat to his surprise, as he had supposed she wanted but to go home.\n\n\"Anywhere you like. It's so warm we might drive instead of going\nindoors. We might go to the Bois. That would be agreeable.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it wouldn't be walking. However, that doesn't matter. It's\nmild enough for anything--for sitting out like all these people. And\nI've never walked in Paris at night. It would amuse me.\"\n\nNick hesitated. \"So it might, but it isn't particularly recommended to\nladies.\"\n\n\"I don't care for that if it happens to suit me.\"\n\n\"Very well then, we'll walk to the Bastille if you like.\"\n\nJulia hesitated, on her side, still looking about. \"It's too far; I'm\ntired; we'll sit here.\" And she dropped beside an empty table on the\n\"terrace\" of M. Durand. \"This will do; it's amusing enough and we can\nlook at the Madeleine--that's respectable. If we must have something\nwe'll have a _mad\u00c3\u00a8re_--is that respectable? Not particularly? So much\nthe better. What are those people having? _Bocks_? Couldn't we have\n_bocks_? Are they very low? Then I shall have one. I've been so\nwonderfully good--I've been staying at Versailles: _je me dois bien\ncela_.\"\n\nShe insisted, but pronounced the thin liquid in the tall glass very\ndisgusting when it was brought. Nick was amazed, reflecting that it was\nnot for such a discussion as this that his mother had left him with\nhands in his pockets. He had been looking out, but as his eloquence\nflowed faster he turned to his friend, who had dropped upon a sofa with\nher face to the window. She had given her jacket and gloves to her maid,\nbut had kept on her hat; and she leaned forward a little as she sat,\nclasping her hands together in her lap and keeping her eyes on him. The\nlamp, in a corner, was so thickly veiled that the room was in tempered\nobscurity, lighted almost equally from the street and the brilliant\nshop-fronts opposite. \"Therefore why be sapient and solemn about it,\nlike an editorial in a newspaper?\" Nick added with a smile.\n\nShe continued to look at him after he had spoken, then she said: \"If you\ndon't want to stand you've only to say so. You needn't give your\nreasons.\"\n\n\"It's too kind of you to let me off that! And then I'm a tremendous\nfellow for reasons; that's my strong point, don't you know? I've a lot\nmore besides those I've mentioned, done up and ready for delivery. The\nodd thing is that they don't always govern my behaviour. I rather think\nI do want to stand.\"\n\n\"Then what you said just now was a speech,\" Julia declared.\n\n\"A speech?\"\n\n\"The 'rot,' the humbug of the hustings.\"\n\n\"No, those great truths remain, and a good many others. But an inner\nvoice tells me I'm in for it. And it will be much more graceful to\nembrace this opportunity, accepting your co-operation, than to wait for\nsome other and forfeit that advantage.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to help you anywhere,\" she went on.\n\n\"Thanks awfully,\" he returned, still standing there with his hands in\nhis pockets. \"You'd do it best in your own place, and I've no right to\ndeny myself such a help.\"\n\nJulia calmly considered. \"I don't do it badly.\"\n\n\"Ah you're so political!\"\n\n\"Of course I am; it's the only decent thing to be. But I can only help\nyou if you'll help yourself. I can do a good deal, but I can't do\neverything. If you'll work I'll work with you; but if you're going into\nit with your hands in your pockets I'll have nothing to do with you.\"\nNick instantly changed the position of these members and sank into a\nseat with his elbows on his knees. \"You're very clever, but you must\nreally take a little trouble. Things don't drop into people's mouths.\"\n\n\"I'll try--I'll try. I've a great incentive,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Of course you have.\"\n\n\"My mother, my poor mother.\" Julia breathed some vague sound and he went\non: \"And of course always my father, dear good man. My mother's even\nmore political than you.\"\n\n\"I daresay she is, and quite right!\" said Mrs. Dallow.\n\n\"And she can't tell me a bit more than you can what she thinks, what she\nbelieves, what she wants.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I can tell you perfectly. There's one thing I always\nimmensely want--to keep out a Tory.\"\n\n\"I see. That's a great philosophy.\"\n\n\"It will do very well. And I desire the good of the country. I'm not\nashamed of that.\"\n\n\"And can you give me an idea of what it is--the good of the country?\"\n\n\"I know perfectly what it isn't. It isn't what the Tories want to do.\"\n\n\"What do they want to do?\"\n\n\"Oh it would take me long to tell you. All sorts of trash.\"\n\n\"It would take you long, and it would take them longer! All they want\nto do is to prevent _us_ from doing. On our side we want to prevent them\nfrom preventing us. That's about as clearly as we all see it. So on both\nsides it's a beautiful, lucid, inspiring programme.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in you,\" Mrs. Dallow replied to this, leaning back on\nher sofa.\n\n\"I hope not, Julia, indeed!\" He paused a moment, still with his face\ntoward her and his elbows on his knees; then he pursued: \"You're a very\naccomplished woman and a very zealous one; but you haven't an idea, you\nknow--not to call an idea. What you mainly want is to be at the head of\na political salon; to start one, to keep it up, to make it a success.\"\n\n\"Much you know me!\" Julia protested; but he could see, through the\ndimness, that her face spoke differently.\n\n\"You'll have it in time, but I won't come to it,\" Nick went on.\n\n\"You can't come less than you do.\"\n\n\"When I say you'll have it I mean you've already got it. That's why I\ndon't come.\"\n\n\"I don't think you know what you mean,\" said Mrs. Dallow. \"I've an idea\nthat's as good as any of yours, any of those you've treated me to this\nevening, it seems to me--the simple idea that one ought to do something\nor other for one's country.\"\n\n\"'Something or other' certainly covers all the ground. There's one thing\none can always do for one's country, which is not to be afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\nNick Dormer waited a little, as if his idea amused him, but he presently\nsaid, \"I'll tell you another time. It's very well to talk so glibly of\nstanding,\" he added; \"but it isn't absolutely foreign to the question\nthat I haven't got the cash.\"\n\n\"What did you do before?\" she asked.\n\n\"The first time my father paid.\"\n\n\"And the other time?\"\n\n\"Oh Mr. Carteret.\"\n\n\"Your expenses won't be at all large; on the contrary,\" said Julia.\n\n\"They shan't be; I shall look out sharp for that. I shall have the great\nHutchby.\"\n\n\"Of course; but you know I want you to do it well.\" She paused an\ninstant and then: \"Of course you can send the bill to me.\"\n\n\"Thanks awfully; you're tremendously kind. I shouldn't think of that.\"\nNick Dormer got up as he spoke, and walked to the window again, his\ncompanion's eyes resting on him while he stood with his back to her. \"I\nshall manage it somehow,\" he wound up.\n\n\"Mr. Carteret will be delighted,\" said Julia.\n\n\"I daresay, but I hate taking people's money.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense--when it's for the country. Isn't it for _them_?\"\n\n\"When they get it back!\" Nick replied, turning round and looking for his\nhat. \"It's startlingly late; you must be tired.\" Mrs. Dallow made no\nresponse to this, and he pursued his quest, successful only when he\nreached a duskier corner of the room, to which the hat had been\nrelegated by his cousin's maid. \"Mr. Carteret will expect so much if he\npays. And so would you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm bound to say I should! I should expect a great\ndeal--everything.\" And Mrs. Dallow emphasised this assertion by the way\nshe rose erect. \"If you're riding for a fall, if you're only going in to\nmiss it, you had better stay out.\"\n\n\"How can I miss it with _you_?\" the young man smiled. She uttered a\nword, impatiently but indistinguishably, and he continued: \"And even if\nI do it will have been immense fun.\"\n\n\"It is immense fun,\" said Julia. \"But the best fun is to win. If you\ndon't----!\"\n\n\"If I don't?\" he repeated as she dropped.\n\n\"I'll never speak to you again.\"\n\n\"How much you expect even when you don't pay!\"\n\nMrs. Dallow's rejoinder was a justification of this remark, expressing\nas it did the fact that should they receive on the morrow information on\nwhich she believed herself entitled to count, information tending to\nshow how hard the Conservatives meant to fight, she should look to him\nto be in the field as early as herself. Sunday was a lost day; she\nshould leave Paris on Monday.\n\n\"Oh they'll fight it hard; they'll put up Kingsbury,\" said Nick,\nsmoothing his hat. \"They'll all come down--all that can get away. And\nKingsbury has a very handsome wife.\"\n\n\"She's not so handsome as your cousin,\" Julia smiled.\n\n\"Oh dear, no--a cousin sooner than a wife any day!\" Nick laughed as soon\nas he had said this, as if the speech had an awkward side; but the\nreparation perhaps scarcely mended it, the exaggerated mock-meekness\nwith which he added: \"I'll do any blessed thing you tell me.\"\n\n\"Come here to-morrow then--as early as ten.\" She turned round, moving to\nthe door with him; but before they reached it she brought out: \"Pray\nisn't a gentleman to do anything, to be anything?\"\n\n\"To be anything----?\"\n\n\"If he doesn't aspire to serve the State.\"\n\n\"Aspire to make his political fortune, do you mean? Oh bless me, yes,\nthere are other things.\"\n\n\"What other things that can compare with that?\"\n\n\"Well, I for instance, I'm very fond of the arts.\"\n\n\"Of the arts?\" she echoed.\n\n\"Did you never hear of them? I'm awfully fond of painting.\"\n\nAt this Julia stopped short, and her fine grey eyes had for a moment the\nair of being set further forward in her head. \"Don't be odious!\nGood-night,\" she said, turning away and leaving him to go.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nPeter Sherringham reminded Nick the next day that he had promised to be\npresent at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's interview with the ladies introduced to her by\nGabriel Nash; and in the afternoon, conformably to this arrangement, the\ntwo men took their way to the Rue de Constantinople. They found Mr. Nash\nand his friends in the small beflounced drawing-room of the old actress,\nwho, as they learned, had sent in a request for ten minutes' grace,\nhaving been detained at a lesson--a rehearsal of the _com\u00c3\u00a9die de salon_\nabout to be given for a charity by a fine lady, at which she had\nconsented to be present as an adviser. Mrs. Rooth sat on a black satin\nsofa with her daughter beside her while Gabriel Nash, wandering about\nthe room, looked at the votive offerings which converted the little\npanelled box, decorated in sallow white and gold, into a theatrical\nmuseum: the presents, the portraits, the wreaths, the diadems, the\nletters, framed and glazed, the trophies and tributes and relics\ncollected by Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 during half a century of renown. The profusion\nof this testimony was hardly more striking than the confession of\nsomething missed, something hushed, which seemed to rise from it all and\nmake it melancholy, like a reference to clappings which, in the nature\nof things, could now only be present as a silence: so that if the place\nwas full of history it was the form without the fact, or at the most a\nredundancy of the one to a pinch of the other--the history of a mask,\nof a squeak, of a series of vain gestures.\n\nSome of the objects exhibited by the distinguished artist, her early\nportraits, in lithograph or miniature, represented the costume and\nembodied the manner of a period so remote that Nick Dormer, as he\nglanced at them, felt a quickened curiosity to look at the woman who\nreconciled being alive to-day with having been alive so long ago. Peter\nSherringham already knew how she managed this miracle, but every visit\nhe paid her added to his amused, charmed sense that it _was_ a miracle\nand that his extraordinary old friend had seen things he should never,\nnever see. Those were just the things he wanted to see most, and her\nduration, her survival, cheated him agreeably and helped him a little to\nguess them. His appreciation of the actor's art was so systematic that\nit had an antiquarian side, and at the risk of representing him as\nattached to an absurd futility it must be said that he had as yet hardly\nknown a keener regret for anything than for the loss of that antecedent\nworld, and in particular for his having belatedly missed the great\n_com\u00c3\u00a9dienne_, the light of the French stage in the early years of the\ncentury, of whose example and instruction Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 had had the\ninestimable benefit. She had often described to him her rare\npredecessor, straight from whose hands she had received her most\ncelebrated parts and of whom her own manner was often a religious\nimitation; but her descriptions troubled him more than they consoled,\nonly confirming his theory, to which so much of his observation had\nalready ministered, that the actor's art in general was going down and\ndown, descending a slope with abysses of vulgarity at its foot, after\nhaving reached its perfection, more than fifty years ago, in the talent\nof the lady in question. He would have liked to dwell for an hour\nbeneath the meridian.\n\nGabriel Nash introduced the new-comers to his companions; but the\nyounger of the two ladies gave no sign of lending herself to this\ntransaction. The girl was very white; she huddled there, silent and\nrigid, frightened to death, staring, expressionless. If Bridget Dormer\nhad seen her at this moment she might have felt avenged for the\ndiscomfiture of her own spirit suffered at the Salon, the day before,\nunder the challenging eyes of Maud Vavasour. It was plain at the present\nhour that Miss Vavasour would have run away had she not regarded the\npersons present as so many guards and keepers. Her appearance made Nick\nfeel as if the little temple of art in which they were collected had\nbeen the waiting-room of a dentist. Sherringham had seen a great many\nnervous girls tremble before the same ordeal, and he liked to be kind to\nthem, to say things that would help them to do themselves justice. The\nprobability in a given case was almost overwhelmingly in favour of their\nhaving any other talent one could think of in a higher degree than the\ndramatic; but he could rarely refrain from some care that the occasion\nshouldn't be, even as against his conscience, too cruel. There were\noccasions indeed that could scarce be too cruel to punish properly\ncertain examples of presumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what Mr. Nash\nhad said about this blighted maiden, and perceived that though she might\nbe inept she was now anything but presumptuous. Gabriel fell to talking\nwith Nick Dormer while Peter addressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was\nno use as yet for any direct word to the girl, who was too scared even\nto hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her shawl fluttering about her, nestled\nagainst her daughter, putting out her hand to take one of Miriam's\nsoothingly. She had pretty, silly, near-sighted eyes, a long thin nose,\nand an upper lip which projected over the under as an ornamental cornice\nrests on its support. \"So much depends--really everything!\" she said in\nanswer to some sociable observation of Sherringham's. \"It's either\nthis,\" and she rolled her eyes expressively about the room, \"or it's--I\ndon't know what!\"\n\n\"Perhaps we're too many,\" Peter hazarded to her daughter. \"But really\nyou'll find, after you fairly begin, that you'll do better with four or\nfive.\"\n\nBefore she answered she turned her head and lifted her fine eyes. The\nnext instant he saw they were full of tears. The words she spoke,\nhowever, though uttered as if she had tapped a silver gong, had not the\nnote of sensibility: \"Oh, I don't care for _you_!\" He laughed at this,\ndeclared it was very well said and that if she could give Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\nsuch a specimen as that----! The actress came in before he had finished\nhis phrase, and he observed the way the girl ruefully rose to the\nencounter, hanging her head a little and looking out from under her\nbrows. There was no sentiment in her face--only a vacancy of awe and\nanguish which had not even the merit of being fine of its kind, for it\nspoke of no spring of reaction. Yet the head was good, he noted at the\nsame moment; it was strong and salient and made to tell at a distance.\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 scarcely heeded her at first, greeting her only in her\norder among the others and pointing to seats, composing the circle with\nsmiles and gestures, as if they were all before the prompter's box. The\nold actress presented herself to a casual glance as a red-faced, raddled\nwoman in a wig, with beady eyes, a hooked nose, and pretty hands; but\nNick Dormer, who had a sense for the over-scored human surface, soon\nobserved that these comparatively gross marks included a great deal of\ndelicate detail--an eyebrow, a nostril, a flitting of expressions, as if\na multitude of little facial wires were pulled from within. This\naccomplished artist had in particular a mouth which was visibly a rare\ninstrument, a pair of lips whose curves and fine corners spoke of a\nlifetime of \"points\" unerringly made and verses exquisitely spoken,\nhelping to explain the purity of the sound that issued from them. Her\nwhole countenance had the look of long service--of a thing infinitely\nworn and used, drawn and stretched to excess, with its elasticity\noverdone and its springs relaxed, yet religiously preserved and kept in\nrepair, even as some valuable old timepiece which might have quivered\nand rumbled but could be trusted to strike the hour. At the first words\nshe spoke Gabriel Nash exclaimed endearingly: _\"Ah la voix de\nC\u00c3\u00a9lim\u00c3\u00a8ne!\"_ C\u00c3\u00a9lim\u00c3\u00a8ne, who wore a big red flower on the summit of her\ndense wig, had a very grand air, a toss of the head, and sundry little\nmajesties of manner; in addition to which she was strange, almost\ngrotesque, and to some people would have been even terrifying, capable\nof reappearing, with her hard eyes, as a queer vision of the darkness.\nShe excused herself for having made the company wait, and mouthed and\nmimicked in the drollest way, with intonations as fine as a flute, the\nperformance and the pretensions of the _belles dames_ to whom she had\njust been endeavouring to communicate a few of the rudiments. _\"Mais\ncelles-l\u00c3\u00a0, c'est une plaisanterie,\"_ she went on to Mrs. Rooth; \"whereas\nyou and your daughter, _ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_--I'm sure you are quite another\nmatter.\"\n\nThe girl had got rid of her tears, and was gazing at her, and Mrs. Rooth\nleaned forward and said portentously: \"She knows four languages.\"\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 gave one of her histrionic stares, throwing back her head.\n\"That's three too many. The thing's to do something proper with one.\"\n\n\"We're very much in earnest,\" continued Mrs. Rooth, who spoke excellent\nFrench.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it--_il n'y a que \u00c3\u00a7a. La t\u00c3\u00aate est bien_--the head's\nvery good,\" she said as she looked at the girl. \"But let us see, my dear\nchild, what you've got in it!\" The young lady was still powerless to\nspeak; she opened her lips, but nothing came. With the failure of this\neffort she turned her deep sombre eyes to the three men. \"_Un beau\nregard_--it carries well.\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 further commented. But even as\nshe spoke Miss Rooth's fine gaze was suffused again and the next moment\nshe had definitely begun to weep. Nick Dormer sprung up; he felt\nembarrassed and intrusive--there was such an indelicacy in sitting there\nto watch a poor working-girl's struggle with timidity. There was a\nmomentary confusion; Mrs. Rooth's tears were seen also to flow; Mr. Nash\ntook it gaily, addressing, however, at the same time, the friendliest,\nmost familiar encouragement to his companions, and Peter Sherringham\noffered to retire with Nick on the spot, should their presence incommode\nthe young lady. But the agitation was over in a minute; Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\nmotioned Mrs. Rooth out of her seat and took her place beside the girl,\nand Nash explained judiciously to the other men that she'd be worse\nshould they leave her. Her mother begged them to remain, \"so that there\nshould be at least some English\"; she spoke as if the old actress were\nan army of Frenchwomen. The young heroine of the occasion quickly came\nround, and Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, on the sofa beside her, held her hand and\nemitted a perfect music of reassurance. \"The nerves, the nerves--they're\nhalf our affair. Have as many as you like, if you've got something else\ntoo. _Voyons_--do you know anything?\"\n\n\"I know some pieces.\"\n\n\"Some pieces of the _r\u00c3\u00a9pertoire_?\"\n\nMiriam Rooth stared as if she didn't understand. \"I know some poetry.\"\n\n\"English, French, Italian, German,\" said her mother.\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 gave Mrs. Rooth a look which expressed irritation at the\nrecurrence of this announcement. \"Does she wish to act in all those\ntongues? The phrase-book isn't the comedy!\"\n\n\"It's only to show you how she has been educated.\"\n\n\"Ah, _ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_, there's no education that matters! I mean save the\nright one. Your daughter must have a particular form of speech, like me,\nlike _ces messieurs_.\"\n\n\"You see if I can speak French,\" said the girl, smiling dimly at her\nhostess. She appeared now almost to have collected herself.\n\n\"You speak it in perfection.\"\n\n\"And English just as well,\" said Miss Rooth.\n\n\"You oughtn't to be an actress--you ought to be a governess.\"\n\n\"Oh don't tell us that: it's to escape from that!\" pleaded Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"I'm very sure your daughter will escape from that,\" Peter Sherringham\nwas moved to interpose.\n\n\"Oh if _you_ could help her!\" said the lady with a world of longing.\n\n\"She has certainly all the qualities that strike the eye,\" Peter\nreturned.\n\n\"You're _most_ kind, sir!\" Mrs. Rooth declared, elegantly draping\nherself.\n\n\"She knows C\u00c3\u00a9lim\u00c3\u00a8ne; I've heard her do C\u00c3\u00a9lim\u00c3\u00a8ne,\" Gabriel Nash said to\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\".\n\n\"And she knows Juliet, she knows Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra,\" added Mrs.\nRooth.\n\n\"_Voyons_, my dear child, do you wish to work for the French stage or\nfor the English?\" the old actress demanded.\n\n\"Ours would have sore need of you, Miss Rooth,\" Sherringham gallantly\nthrew off.\n\n\"Could you speak to any one in London--could you introduce her?\" her\nmother eagerly asked.\n\n\"Dear madam, I must hear her first, and hear what Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 says.\"\n\n\"She has a voice of rare beauty, and I understand voices,\" said Mrs.\nRooth.\n\n\"Ah then if she has intelligence she has every gift.\"\n\n\"She has a most poetic mind,\" the old lady went on.\n\n\"I should like to paint her portrait; she's made for that,\" Nick Dormer\nventured to observe to Mrs. Rooth; partly because struck with the girl's\nsuitability for sitting, partly to mitigate the crudity of inexpressive\nspectatorship.\n\n\"So all the artists say. I've had three or four heads of her, if you\nwould like to see them: she has been done in several styles. If you were\nto do her I'm sure it would make her celebrated.\"\n\n\"And me too,\" Nick easily laughed.\n\n\"It would indeed--a member of Parliament!\" Nash declared.\n\n\"Ah, I have the honour----?\" murmured Mrs. Rooth, looking gratified and\nmystified.\n\nNick explained that she had no honour at all, and meanwhile Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\nhad been questioning the girl \"_Ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_, I can do nothing with\nyour daughter: she knows too much!\" she broke out. \"It's a pity, because\nI like to catch them wild.\"\n\n\"Oh she's wild enough, if that's all! And that's the very point, the\nquestion of where to try,\" Mrs. Rooth went on. \"Into what do I launch\nher--upon what dangerous stormy sea? I've thought of it so anxiously.\"\n\n\"Try here--try the French public: they're so much the most serious,\"\nsaid Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"Ah no, try the English: there's such a rare opening!\" Sherringham urged\nin quick opposition.\n\n\"Oh it isn't the public, dear gentlemen. It's the private side, the\nother people--it's the life, it's the moral atmosphere.\"\n\n\"_Je ne connais qu'une sc\u00c3\u00a8ne,--la n\u00c3\u00b4tre_,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 declared. \"I'm\nassured by every one who knows that there's no other.\"\n\n\"Very correctly assured,\" said Mr. Nash. \"The theatre in our countries\nis puerile and barbarous.\"\n\n\"There's something to be done for it, and perhaps mademoiselle's the\nperson to do it,\" Sherringham contentiously suggested.\n\n\"Ah but, _en attendant_, what can it do for her?\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 asked.\n\n\"Well, anything I can help to bring about,\" said Peter Sherringham, more\nand more struck with the girl's rich type. Miriam Rooth sat in silence\nwhile this discussion went on, looking from one speaker to the other\nwith a strange dependent candour.\n\n\"Ah, if your part's marked out I congratulate you, mademoiselle!\"--and\nthe old actress underlined the words as she had often underlined others\non the stage. She smiled with large permissiveness on the young\naspirant, who appeared not to understand her. Her tone penetrated,\nhowever, to certain depths in the mother's nature, adding another stir\nto agitated waters.\n\n\"I feel the responsibility of what she shall find in the life, the\nstandards, of the theatre,\" Mrs. Rooth explained. \"Where is the purest\ntone--where are the highest standards? That's what I ask,\" the good lady\ncontinued with a misguided intensity which elicited a peal of\nunceremonious but sociable laughter from Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"The purest tone--_qu'est-ce que c'est que \u00c3\u00a7a_?\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 demanded\nin the finest manner of modern comedy.\n\n\"We're very, _very_ respectable,\" Mrs. Rooth went on, but now smiling\nand achieving lightness too.\n\n\"What I want is to place my daughter where the conduct--and the picture\nof conduct in which she should take part--wouldn't be quite absolutely\ndreadful. Now, _ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_, how about all that; how about _conduct_\nin the French theatre--all the things she should see, the things she\nshould hear, the things she should learn?\"\n\nHer hostess took it, as Sherringham felt, _de tr\u00c3\u00a8s-haut_. \"I don't think\nI know what you're talking about. They're the things she may see and\nhear and learn everywhere; only they're better done, they're better\nsaid, above all they're better taught. The only conduct that concerns\nan, actress, it seems to me, is her own, and the only way for her to\nbehave herself is not to be a helpless stick. I know no other conduct.\"\n\n\"But there are characters, there are situations, which I don't think I\nshould like to see _her_ undertake.\"\n\n\"There are many, no doubt, which she would do well to leave alone!\"\nlaughed the Frenchwoman.\n\n\"I shouldn't like to see her represent a very bad woman--a _really_ bad\none,\" Mrs. Rooth serenely pursued.\n\n\"Ah in England then, and in your theatre, every one's immaculately good?\nYour plays must be even more ingenious than I supposed!\"\n\n\"We haven't any plays,\" said Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"People will write them for Miss Rooth--it will be a new era,\"\nSherringham threw in with wanton, or at least with combative, optimism.\n\n\"Will _you_, sir--will you do something? A sketch of one of our grand\nEnglish ideals?\" the old lady asked engagingly.\n\n\"Oh I know what you do with our pieces--to show your superior virtue!\"\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 cried before he had time to reply that he wrote nothing\nbut diplomatic memoranda. \"Bad women? _Je n'ai jou\u00c3\u00a9 que \u00c3\u00a7a, madame_.\n'Really' bad? I tried to make them real!\"\n\n\"I can say 'L'Aventuri\u00c3\u00a8re,'\" Miriam interrupted in a cold voice which\nseemed to hint at a want of participation in the maternal solicitudes.\n\n\"Allow us the pleasure of hearing you then. Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 will give you\nthe _r\u00c3\u00a9plique_,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\n\"Certainly, my child; I can say it without the book,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\nresponded. \"Put yourself there--move that chair a little away.\" She\npatted her young visitor, encouraging her to rise, settling with her the\nscene they should take, while the three men sprang up to arrange a place\nfor the performance. Miriam left her seat and looked vaguely about her;\nthen having taken off her hat and given it to her mother she stood on\nthe designated spot with her eyes to the ground. Abruptly, however,\ninstead of beginning the scene, Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 turned to the elder lady\nwith an air which showed that a rejoinder to this visitor's remarks of a\nmoment before had been gathering force in her breast.\n\n\"You mix things up, _ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_, and I have it on my heart to tell\nyou so. I believe it's rather the case with you other English, and I've\nnever been able to learn that either your morality or your talent is the\ngainer by it. To be too respectable to go where things are done best is\nin my opinion to be very vicious indeed; and to do them badly in order\nto preserve your virtue is to fall into a grossness more shocking than\nany other. To do them well is virtue enough, and not to make a mess of\nit the only respectability. That's hard enough to merit Paradise.\nEverything else is base humbug! _Voil\u00c3\u00a0, ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_, the answer I have\nfor your scruples!\"\n\n\"It's admirable--admirable; and I am glad my friend Dormer here has had\nthe great advantage of hearing you utter it!\" Nash exclaimed with a free\ndesignation of Nick.\n\nThat young man thought it in effect a speech denoting an intelligence of\nthe question, yet he rather resented the idea that Gabriel should assume\nit would strike him as a revelation; and to show his familiarity with\nthe line of thought it indicated, as well as to play his part\nappreciatively in the little circle, he observed to Mrs. Rooth, as if\nthey might take many things for granted: \"In other words, your daughter\nmust find her safeguard in the artistic conscience.\" But he had no\nsooner spoken than he was struck with the oddity of their discussing so\npublicly, and under the poor girl's handsome nose, the conditions which\nMiss Rooth might find the best for the preservation of her personal\nintegrity. However, the anomaly was light and unoppressive--the echoes\nof a public discussion of delicate questions seemed to linger so\nfamiliarly in the egotistical little room. Moreover, the heroine of the\noccasion evidently was losing her embarrassment; she was the priestess\non the tripod, awaiting the afflatus and thinking only of that. Her\nbared head, of which she had changed the position, holding it erect,\nwhile her arms hung at her sides, was admirable; her eyes gazed straight\nout of the window and at the houses on the opposite side of the Rue de\nConstantinople.\n\nMrs. Rooth had listened to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 with startled, respectful\nattention, but Nick, considering her, was very sure she hadn't at all\ntaken in the great artist's little lesson. Yet this didn't prevent her\nfrom exclaiming in answer to himself: \"Oh a fine artistic life--what\nindeed is more beautiful?\"\n\nPeter Sherringham had said nothing; he was watching Miriam and her\nattitude. She wore a black dress which fell in straight folds; her face,\nunder her level brows, was pale and regular--it had a strange, strong,\ntragic beauty. \"I don't know what's in her,\" he said to himself;\n\"nothing, it would seem, from her persistent vacancy. But such a face as\nthat, such a head, is a fortune!\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 brought her to book,\ngiving her the first line of the speech of Clorinde: \"_Vous ne me fuyez\npas, mon enfant, aujourd'hui_.\" But still the girl hesitated, and for an\ninstant appeared to make a vain, convulsive effort. In this convulsion\nshe frowned portentously; her low forehead overhung her eyes; the eyes\nthemselves, in shadow, stared, splendid and cold, and her hands clinched\nthemselves at her sides. She looked austere and terrible and was during\nthis moment an incarnation the vividness of which drew from Sherringham\na stifled cry. \"_Elle est bien belle--ah \u00c3\u00a7a_,\" murmured the old\nactress; and in the pause which still preceded the issue of sound from\nthe girl's lips Peter turned to his kinsman and said in a low tone: \"You\nmust paint her just like that.\"\n\n\"Like that?\"\n\n\"As the Tragic Muse.\"\n\nShe began to speak; a long, strong, colourless voice quavered in her\nyoung throat. She delivered the lines of Clorinde in the admired\ninterview with C\u00c3\u00a9lie, the gem of the third act, with a rude monotony,\nand then, gaining confidence, with an effort at modulation which was not\naltogether successful and which evidently she felt not to be so. Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9 sent back the ball without raising her hand, repeating the\nspeeches of C\u00c3\u00a9lie, which her memory possessed from their having so often\nbeen addressed to her, and uttering the verses with soft, communicative\nart. So they went on through the scene, which, when it was over, had not\nprecisely been a triumph for Miriam Rooth. Sherringham forbore to look\nat Gabriel Nash, and Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 said: \"I think you've a voice, _ma\nfille_, somewhere or other. We must try and put our hand on it.\" Then\nshe asked her what instruction she had had, and the girl, lifting her\neyebrows, looked at her mother while her mother prompted her.\n\n\"Mrs. Delamere in London; she was once an ornament of the English stage.\nShe gives lessons just to a very few; it's a great favour. Such a very\nnice person! But above all, Signor Ruggieri--I think he taught us most.\"\nMrs. Rooth explained that this gentleman was an Italian tragedian, in\nRome, who instructed Miriam in the proper manner of pronouncing his\nlanguage and also in the art of declaiming and gesticulating.\n\n\"Gesticulating I'll warrant!\" declared their hostess. \"They mimic as for\nthe deaf, they emphasise as for the blind. Mrs. Delamere is doubtless an\nepitome of all the virtues, but I never heard of her. You travel too\nmuch,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 went on; \"that's very amusing, but the way to study\nis to stay at home, to shut yourself up and hammer at your scales.\" Mrs.\nRooth complained that they had no home to stay at; in reply to which the\nold actress exclaimed: \"Oh you English, you're _d'une l\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a8ret\u00c3\u00a9 \u00c3\u00a0 faire\nfr\u00c3\u00a9mir._ If you haven't a home you must make, or at least for decency\npretend to, one. In our profession it's the first requisite.\"\n\n\"But where? That's what I ask!\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"Why not here?\" Sherringham threw out.\n\n\"Oh here!\" And the good lady shook her head with a world of sad\nsignificance.\n\n\"Come and live in London and then I shall be able to paint your\ndaughter,\" Nick Dormer interposed.\n\n\"Is that all it will take, my dear fellow?\" asked Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"Ah, London's full of memories,\" Mrs. Rooth went on. \"My father had a\ngreat house there--we always came up. But all that's over.\"\n\n\"Study here and then go to London to appear,\" said Peter, feeling\nfrivolous even as he spoke.\n\n\"To appear in French?\"\n\n\"No, in the language of Shakespeare.\"\n\n\"But we can't study that here.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sherringham means that he will give you lessons,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\nexplained. \"Let me not fail to say it--he's an excellent critic.\"\n\n\"How do you know that--you who're beyond criticism and perfect?\" asked\nSherringham: an inquiry to which the answer was forestalled by the\ngirl's rousing herself to make it public that she could recite the\n\"Nights\" of Alfred de Musset.\n\n\"Diable!\" said the actress: \"that's more than I can! By all means give\nus a specimen.\"\n\nThe girl again placed herself in position and rolled out a fragment of\none of the splendid conversations of Musset's poet with his muse--rolled\nit loudly and proudly, tossed it and tumbled it about the room. Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9 watched her at first, but after a few moments she shut her eyes,\nthough the best part of the business was to take in her young\ncandidate's beauty. Sherringham had supposed Miriam rather abashed by\nthe flatness of her first performance, but he now saw how little she\ncould have been aware of this: she was rather uplifted and emboldened.\nShe made a mush of the divine verses, which in spite of certain\nsonorities and cadences, an evident effort to imitate a celebrated\nactress, a comrade of Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, whom she had heard declaim them, she\nproduced as if she had been dashing blindfold at some playfellow she was\nto \"catch.\" When she had finished Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 passed no judgement, only\ndropping: \"Perhaps you had better say something English.\" She suggested\nsome little piece of verse--some fable if there were fables in English.\nShe appeared but scantily surprised to hear that there were not--it was\na language of which one expected so little. Mrs. Rooth said: \"She knows\nher Tennyson by heart. I think he's much deeper than La Fontaine\"; and\nafter some deliberation and delay Miriam broke into \"The Lotus-Eaters,\"\nfrom which she passed directly, almost breathlessly, to \"Edward Gray.\"\nSherringham had by this time heard her make four different attempts, and\nthe only generalisation very present to him was that she uttered these\ndissimilar compositions in exactly the same tone--a solemn, droning,\ndragging measure suggestive of an exhortation from the pulpit and\nadopted evidently with the \"affecting\" intention and from a crude idea\nof \"style.\" It was all funereal, yet was artlessly rough. Sherringham\nthought her English performance less futile than her French, but he\ncould see that Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 listened to it even with less pleasure. In\nthe way the girl wailed forth some of her Tennysonian lines he detected\na faint gleam as of something pearly in deep water. But the further she\nwent the more violently she acted on the nerves of Mr. Gabriel Nash:\nthat also he could discover from the way this gentleman ended by\nslipping discreetly to the window and leaning there with his head out\nand his back to the exhibition. He had the art of mute expression; his\nattitude said as clearly as possible: \"No, no, you can't call me either\nill-mannered or ill-natured. I'm the showman of the occasion, moreover,\nand I avert myself, leaving you to judge. If there's a thing in life I\nhate it's this idiotic new fashion of the drawing-room recitation and of\nthe insufferable creatures who practise it, who prevent conversation,\nand whom, as they're beneath it, you can't punish by criticism.\nTherefore what I'm doing's only too magnanimous--bringing these\nbenighted women here, paying with my person, stifling my just\nrepugnance.\"\n\nWhile Sherringham judged privately that the manner in which Miss Rooth\nhad acquitted herself offered no element of interest, he yet remained\naware that something surmounted and survived her failure, something that\nwould perhaps be worth his curiosity. It was the element of outline and\nattitude, the way she stood, the way she turned her eyes, her head, and\nmoved her limbs. These things held the attention; they had a natural\nauthority and, in spite of their suggesting too much the school-girl in\nthe _tableau-vivant_, a \"plastic\" grandeur. Her face, moreover, grew as\nhe watched it; something delicate dawned in it, a dim promise of variety\nand a touching plea for patience, as if it were conscious of being able\nto show in time more shades than the simple and striking gloom which had\nas yet mainly graced it. These rather rude physical felicities formed in\nshort her only mark of a vocation. He almost hated to have to recognise\nthem; he had seen them so often when they meant nothing at all that he\nhad come at last to regard them as almost a guarantee of incompetence.\nHe knew Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 valued them singly so little that she counted them\nout in measuring an histrionic nature; when deprived of the escort of\nother properties which helped and completed them she almost held them a\npositive hindrance to success--success of the only kind she esteemed.\nFar oftener than himself she had sat in judgement on young women for\nwhom hair and eyebrows and a disposition for the statuesque would have\nworked the miracle of sanctifying their stupidity if the miracle were\nworkable. But that particular miracle never was. The qualities she rated\nhighest were not the gifts but the conquests, the effects the actor had\nworked hard for, had dug out of the mine by unwearied study.\nSherringham remembered to have had in the early part of their\nacquaintance a friendly dispute with her on this subject, he having been\nmoved at that time to defend doubtless to excess the cause of the gifts.\nShe had gone so far as to say that a serious comedian ought to be\nashamed of them--ashamed of resting his case on them; and when\nSherringham had cited the great Rachel as a player whose natural\nendowment was rich and who had owed her highest triumphs to it, she had\ndeclared that Rachel was the very instance that proved her point;--a\ntalent assisted by one or two primary aids, a voice and a portentous\nbrow, but essentially formed by work, unremitting and ferocious work. \"I\ndon't care a straw for your handsome girls,\" she said; \"but bring me one\nwho's ready to drudge the tenth part of the way Rachel drudged, and I'll\nforgive her her beauty. Of course, _notez bien_, Rachel wasn't a _grosse\nb\u00c3\u00aate_: that's a gift if you like!\"\n\nMrs. Rooth, who was evidently very proud of the figure her daughter had\nmade--her daughter who for all one could tell affected their hostess\nprecisely as a _grosse b\u00c3\u00aate_--appealed to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 rashly and\nserenely for a verdict; but fortunately this lady's voluble _bonne_ came\nrattling in at the same moment with the tea-tray. The old actress busied\nherself in dispensing this refreshment, an hospitable attention to her\nEnglish visitors, and under cover of the diversion thus obtained, while\nthe others talked together, Sherringham put her the question: \"Well, is\nthere anything in my young friend?\"\n\n\"Nothing I can see. She's loud and coarse.\"\n\n\"She's very much afraid. You must allow for that.\"\n\n\"Afraid of me, immensely, but not a bit afraid of her authors--nor of\nyou!\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 smiled.\n\n\"Aren't you prejudiced by what that fellow Nash has told you?\"\n\n\"Why prejudiced? He only told me she was very handsome.\"\n\n\"And don't you think her so?\"\n\n\"Admirable. But I'm not a photographer nor a dressmaker nor a coiffeur.\nI can't do anything with 'back hair' nor with a mere big stare.\"\n\n\"The head's very noble,\" said Peter Sherringham. \"And the voice, when\nshe spoke English, had some sweet tones.\"\n\n\"Ah your English--possibly! All I can say is that I listened to her\nconscientiously, and I didn't perceive in what she did a single\n_nuance_, a single inflexion or intention. But not one, _mon cher_. I\ndon't think she's intelligent.\"\n\n\"But don't they often seem stupid at first?\"\n\n\"Say always!\"\n\n\"Then don't some succeed--even when they're handsome?\"\n\n\"When they're handsome they always succeed--in one way or another.\"\n\n\"You don't understand us English,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 drank her tea; then she replied: \"Marry her, my son, and\ngive her diamonds. Make her an ambassadress; she'll look very well.\"\n\n\"She interests you so little that you don't care to do anything for\nher?\"\n\n\"To do anything?\"\n\n\"To give her a few lessons.\"\n\nThe old actress looked at him a moment; after which, rising from her\nplace near the table on which the tea had been served, she said to\nMiriam Rooth: \"My dear child, I give my voice for the _sc\u00c3\u00a8ne anglaise_.\nYou did the English things best.\"\n\n\"Did I do them well?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"You've a great deal to learn; but you've rude force. The main things\n_sont encore a d\u00c3\u00a9gager_, but they'll come. You must work.\"\n\n\"I think she has ideas,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"She gets them from you,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 replied.\n\n\"I must say that if it's to be _our_ theatre I'm relieved. I do think\nours safer,\" the good lady continued.\n\n\"Ours is dangerous, no doubt.\"\n\n\"You mean you're more severe,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Your mother's right,\" the actress smiled; \"you have ideas.\"\n\n\"But what shall we do then--how shall we proceed?\" Mrs. Rooth made this\nappeal, plaintively and vaguely, to the three gentlemen; but they had\ncollected a few steps off and were so occupied in talk that it failed to\nreach them.\n\n\"Work--work--work!\" exclaimed the actress.\n\n\"In English I can play Shakespeare. I want to play Shakespeare,\" Miriam\nmade known.\n\n\"That's fortunate, as in English you haven't any one else to play.\"\n\n\"But he's so great--and he's so pure!\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"That indeed seems the saving of you,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 returned.\n\n\"You think me actually pretty bad, don't you?\" the girl demanded with\nher serious face.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu, que vous dirai-je?_ Of course you're rough; but so was I at\nyour age. And if you find your voice it may carry you far. Besides, what\ndoes it matter what I think? How can I judge for your English public?\"\n\n\"How shall I find my voice?\" asked Miriam Rooth.\n\n\"By trying. _Il n'y a que \u00c3\u00a7a_. Work like a horse, night and day.\nBesides, Mr. Sherringham, as he says, will help you.\"\n\nThat gentleman, hearing his name, turned round and the girl appealed to\nhim. \"Will you help me really?\"\n\n\"To find her voice,\" said Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"The voice, when it's worth anything, comes from the heart; so I suppose\nthat's where to look for it,\" Gabriel Nash suggested.\n\n\"Much you know; you haven't got any!\" Miriam retorted with the first\nscintillation of gaiety she had shown on this occasion.\n\n\"Any voice, my child?\" Mr. Nash inquired.\n\n\"Any heart--or any manners!\"\n\nPeter Sherringham made the secret reflexion that he liked her better\nlugubrious, as the note of pertness was not totally absent from her mode\nof emitting these few words. He was irritated, moreover, for in the\nbrief conference he had just had with the young lady's introducer he had\nhad to meet the rather difficult call of speaking of her hopefully. Mr.\nNash had said with his bland smile, \"And what impression does my young\nfriend make?\"--in respect to which Peter's optimism felt engaged by an\nawkward logic. He answered that he recognised promise, though he did\nnothing of the sort;--at the same time that the poor girl, both with the\nexaggerated \"points\" of her person and the vanity of her attempt at\nexpression, constituted a kind of challenge, struck him as a subject for\ninquiry, a problem, an explorable tract. She was too bad to jump at and\nyet too \"taking\"--perhaps after all only vulgarly--to overlook,\nespecially when resting her tragic eyes on him with the trust of her\ndeep \"Really?\" This note affected him as addressed directly to his\nhonour, giving him a chance to brave verisimilitude, to brave ridicule\neven a little, in order to show in a special case what he had always\nmaintained in general, that the direction of a young person's studies\nfor the stage may be an interest of as high an order as any other\nartistic appeal.\n\n\"Mr. Nash has rendered us the great service of introducing us to Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9, and I'm sure we're immensely indebted to him,\" Mrs. Rooth said to\nher daughter with an air affectionately corrective.\n\n\"But what good does that do us?\" the girl asked, smiling at the actress\nand gently laying her finger-tips upon her hand. \"Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 listens\nto me with adorable patience, and then sends me about my business--ah in\nthe prettiest way in the world.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you're not so rough; the tone of that's very _juste. A la\nbonne heure_; work--work!\" the actress cried. \"There was an inflexion\nthere--or very nearly. Practise it till you've got it.\"\n\n\"Come and practise it to _me_, if your mother will be so kind as to\nbring you,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\n\"Do you give lessons--do you understand?\" Miriam asked.\n\n\"I'm an old play-goer and I've an unbounded belief in my own judgement.\"\n\n\"'Old,' sir, is too much to say,\" Mrs. Rooth remonstrated. \"My daughter\nknows your high position, but she's very direct. You'll always find her\nso. Perhaps you'll say there are less honourable faults. We'll come to\nsee you with pleasure. Oh I've been at the embassy when I was her age.\nTherefore why shouldn't she go to-day? That was in Lord Davenant's\ntime.\"\n\n\"A few people are coming to tea with me to-morrow. Perhaps you'll come\nthen at five o'clock.\"\n\n\"It will remind me of the dear old times,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"Thank you; I'll try and do better to-morrow,\" Miriam professed very\nsweetly.\n\n\"You do better every minute!\" Sherringham returned--and he looked at\ntheir hostess in support of this declaration.\n\n\"She's finding her voice,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 acknowledged.\n\n\"She's finding a friend!\" Mrs. Rooth threw in.\n\n\"And don't forget, when you come to London, my hope that you'll come and\nsee _me_,\" Nick Dormer said to the girl. \"To try and paint you--that\nwould do me good!\"\n\n\"She's finding even two,\" said Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"It's to make up for one I've lost!\" And Miriam looked with very good\nstage-scorn at Gabriel Nash. \"It's he who thinks I'm bad.\"\n\n\"You say that to make me drive you home; you know it will,\" Nash\nreturned.\n\n\"We'll all take you home; why not?\" Sherringham asked.\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 looked at the handsome girl, handsomer than ever at this\nmoment, and at the three young men who had taken their hats and stood\nready to accompany her. A deeper expression came for an instant into her\nhard, bright eyes. \"_Ah la jeunesse_!\" she sighed. \"You'd always have\nthat, my child, if you were the greatest goose on earth!\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nAt Peter Sherringham's the next day Miriam had so evidently come with\nthe expectation of \"saying\" something that it was impossible such a\npatron of the drama should forbear to invite her, little as the\nexhibition at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's could have contributed to render the\ninvitation prompt. His curiosity had been more appeased than stimulated,\nbut he felt none the less that he had \"taken up\" the dark-browed girl\nand her reminiscential mother and must face the immediate consequences\nof the act. This responsibility weighed upon him during the twenty-four\nhours that followed the ultimate dispersal of the little party at the\ndoor of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne.\n\nOn quitting Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 the two ladies had definitely declined Mr.\nNash's offered cab and had taken their way homeward on foot and with the\ngentlemen in attendance. The streets of Paris at that hour were bright\nand episodical, and Sherringham trod them good-humouredly enough and not\ntoo fast, leaning a little to talk with Miriam as he went. Their pace\nwas regulated by her mother's, who advanced on the arm of Gabriel Nash\n(Nick Dormer was on her other side) in refined deprecation. Her sloping\nback was before them, exempt from retentive stillness in spite of her\nrigid principles, with the little drama of her lost and recovered shawl\nperpetually going on.\n\nSherringham said nothing to the girl about her performance or her\npowers; their talk was only of her manner of life with her mother--their\ntravels, their _pensions_, their economies, their want of a home, the\nmany cities she knew well, the foreign tongues and the wide view of the\nworld she had acquired. He guessed easily enough the dolorous type of\nexile of the two ladies, wanderers in search of Continental cheapness,\ninured to queer contacts and compromises, \"remarkably well connected\" in\nEngland, but going out for their meals. The girl was but indirectly\ncommunicative; though seemingly less from any plan of secrecy than from\nthe habit of associating with people whom she didn't honour with her\nconfidence. She was fragmentary and abrupt, as well as not in the least\nshy, subdued to dread of Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 as she had been for the time. She\ngave Sherringham a reason for this fear, and he thought her reason\ninnocently pretentious. \"She admired a great artist more than anything\nin the world; and in the presence of art, of _great_ art, her heart beat\nso fast.\" Her manners were not perfect, and the friction of a varied\nexperience had rather roughened than smoothed her. She said nothing that\nproved her intelligent, even though he guessed this to be the design of\ntwo or three of her remarks; but he parted from her with the suspicion\nthat she was, according to the contemporary French phrase, a \"nature.\"\n\nThe H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne was in a small unrenovated street in which the\ncobble-stones of old Paris still flourished, lying between the Avenue de\nl'Op\u00c3\u00a9ra and the Place de la Bourse. Sherringham had occasionally\ntraversed the high dimness, but had never noticed the tall, stale\n_maison meubl\u00c3\u00a9e_, the aspect of which, that of a third-rate provincial\ninn, was an illustration of Mrs. Rooth's shrunken standard. \"We would\nask you to come up, but it's quite at the top and we haven't a\nsitting-room,\" the poor lady bravely explained. \"We had to receive Mr.\nNash at a caf\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nNick Dormer declared that he liked caf\u00c3\u00a9s, and Miriam, looking at his\ncousin, dropped with a flash of passion the demand: \"Do you wonder I\nshould want to do something--so that we can stop living like pigs?\"\n\nPeter recognised the next day that though it might be boring to listen\nto her it was better to make her recite than to let her do nothing, so\neffectually did the presence of his sister and that of Lady Agnes, and\neven of Grace and Biddy, appear, by a strange tacit opposition, to\ndeprive hers, ornamental as it was, of a reason. He had only to see them\nall together to perceive that she couldn't pass for having come to\n\"meet\" them--even her mother's insinuating gentility failed to put the\noccasion on that footing--and that she must therefore be assumed to have\nbeen brought to show them something. She was not subdued, not colourless\nenough to sit there for nothing, or even for conversation--the sort of\nconversation that was likely to come off--so that it was inevitable to\ntreat her position as connected with the principal place on the carpet,\nwith silence and attention and the pulling together of chairs. Even when\nso established it struck him at first as precarious, in the light, or\nthe darkness, of the inexpressive faces of the other ladies, seated in\ncouples and rows on sofas--there were several in addition to Julia and\nthe Dormers; mainly the wives, with their husbands, of Sherringham's\nfellow-secretaries--scarcely one of whom he felt he might count upon for\na modicum of gush when the girl should have finished.\n\nMiss Rooth gave a representation of Juliet drinking the potion,\naccording to the system, as her mother explained, of the famous Signor\nRuggieri--a scene of high fierce sound, of many cries and contortions:\nshe shook her hair (which proved magnificent) half-down before the\nperformance was over. Then she declaimed several short poems by Victor\nHugo, selected among many hundred by Mrs. Rooth, as the good lady was\ncareful to make known. After this she jumped to the American lyre,\nregaling the company with specimens, both familiar and fresh, of\nLongfellow, Lowell, Whittier, Holmes, and of two or three poetesses now\nrevealed to Sherringham for the first time. She flowed so copiously,\nkeeping the floor and rejoicing visibly in her luck, that her host was\nmainly occupied with wondering how he could make her leave off. He was\nsurprised at the extent of her repertory, which, in view of the\ncircumstance that she could never have received much encouragement--it\nmust have come mainly from her mother, and he didn't believe in Signor\nRuggieri--denoted a very stiff ambition and a blundering energy. It was\nher mother who checked her at last, and he found himself suspecting that\nGabriel Nash had intimated to the old woman that interference was\nnecessary. For himself he was chiefly glad Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 hadn't come. It\nwas present to him that she would have judged the exhibition, with its\nbadness, its impudence, the absence of criticism, wholly indecent.\n\nHis only new impression of the heroine of the scene was that of this\nsame high assurance--her coolness, her complacency, her eagerness to go\non. She had been deadly afraid of the old actress but was not a bit\nafraid of a cluster of _femmes du monde_, of Julia, of Lady Agnes, of\nthe smart women of the embassy. It was positively these personages who\nwere rather in fear; there was certainly a moment when even Julia was\nscared for the first time he had ever remarked it. The space was too\nsmall, the cries, the convulsions and rushes of the dishevelled girl\nwere too near. Lady Agnes wore much of the time the countenance she\nmight have shown at the theatre during a play in which pistols were\nfired; and indeed the manner of the young reciter had become more\nspasmodic and more explosive. It appeared, however, that the company in\ngeneral thought her very clever and successful; which showed, to\nSherringham's sense, how little they understood the matter. Poor Biddy\nwas immensely struck; she grew flushed and absorbed in proportion as\nMiriam, at her best moments, became pale and fatal. It was she who spoke\nto her first, after it was agreed that they had better not fatigue her\nany more; she advanced a few steps, happening to be nearest--she\nmurmured: \"Oh thank you so much. I never saw anything so beautiful, so\ngrand.\"\n\nShe looked very red and very pretty as she said this, and Peter\nSherringham liked her enough to notice her more and like her better when\nshe looked prettier than usual. As he turned away he heard Miriam make\nanswer with no great air of appreciation of her tribute: \"I've seen you\nbefore--two days ago at the Salon with Mr. Dormer. Yes, I know he's your\nbrother. I've made his acquaintance since. He wants to paint my\nportrait. Do you think he'll do it well?\" He was afraid the girl was\nsomething of a brute--also somewhat grossly vain. This impression would\nperhaps have been confirmed if a part of the rest of the short\nconversation of the two young women had reached his ear. Biddy ventured\nto observe that she herself had studied modelling a little and that she\ncould understand how any artist would think Miss Rooth a splendid\nsubject. If indeed _she_ could attempt her head, that would be a chance\nindeed.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miriam with a laugh as of high comedy. \"I think I had\nrather not _passer par toute la famille_!\" Then she added: \"If your\nbrother's an artist I don't understand how he's in Parliament.\"\n\n\"Oh he isn't in Parliament now--we only hope he will be.\"\n\n\"Ah I see.\"\n\n\"And he isn't an artist either,\" Biddy felt herself conscientiously\nbound to state.\n\n\"Then he isn't anything,\" said Miss Rooth.\n\n\"Well--he's immensely clever.\"\n\n\"Ah I see,\" Miss Rooth again replied. \"Mr. Nash has puffed him up so.\"\n\n\"I don't know Mr. Nash,\" said Biddy, guilty of a little dryness as well\nas of a little misrepresentation, and feeling rather snubbed.\n\n\"Well, you needn't wish to.\"\n\nBiddy stood with her a moment longer, still looking at her and not\nknowing what to say next, but not finding her any less handsome because\nshe had such odd manners. Biddy had an ingenious little mind, which\nalways tried as much as possible to keep different things separate. It\nwas pervaded now by the reflexion, attended with some relief, that if\nthe girl spoke to her with such unexpected familiarity of Nick she said\nnothing at all about Peter. Two gentlemen came up, two of Peter's\nfriends, and made speeches to Miss Rooth of the kind Biddy supposed\npeople learned to make in Paris. It was also doubtless in Paris, the\ngirl privately reasoned, that they learned to listen to them as this\nstriking performer listened. She received their advances very\ndifferently from the way she had received Biddy's. Sherringham noticed\nhis young kinswoman turn away, still very red, to go and sit near her\nmother again, leaving Miriam engaged with the two men. It appeared to\nhave come over her that for a moment she had been strangely spontaneous\nand bold, and that she had paid a little of the penalty. The seat next\nher mother was occupied by Mrs. Rooth, toward whom Lady Agnes's head had\ninclined itself with a preoccupied tolerance. He had the conviction\nMrs. Rooth was telling her about the Neville-Nugents of Castle Nugent\nand that Lady Agnes was thinking it odd she never had heard of them. He\nsaid to himself that Biddy was generous. She had urged Julia to come in\norder that they might see how bad the strange young woman would be, but\nnow that the event had proved dazzling she forgot this calculation and\nrejoiced in what she innocently supposed to be the performer's triumph.\nShe kept away from Julia, however; she didn't even look at her to invite\nher also to confess that, in vulgar parlance, they had been sold. He\nhimself spoke to his sister, who was leaning back with a detached air in\nthe corner of a sofa, saying something which led her to remark in reply:\n\"Ah I daresay it's extremely fine, but I don't care for tragedy when it\ntreads on one's toes. She's like a cow who has kicked over the\nmilking-pail. She ought to be tied up.\"\n\n\"My poor Julia, it isn't extremely fine; it isn't fine at all,\"\nSherringham returned with some irritation.\n\n\"Pardon me then. I thought that was why you invited us.\"\n\n\"I imagined she was different,\" Peter said a little foolishly.\n\n\"Ah if you don't care for her so much the better. It has always seemed\nto me you make too awfully much of those people.\"\n\n\"Oh I do care for her too--rather. She's interesting.\" His sister gave\nhim a momentary, mystified glance and he added: \"And she's dreadful.\" He\nfelt stupidly annoyed and was ashamed of his annoyance, as he could have\nassigned no reason for it. It didn't grow less for the moment from his\nseeing Gabriel Nash approach Julia, introduced by Nick Dormer. He gave\nplace to the two young men with some alacrity, for he had a sense of\nbeing put in the wrong in respect to their specimen by Nash's very\npresence. He remembered how it had been a part of their bargain, as it\nwere, that he should present that gentleman to his sister. He was not\nsorry to be relieved of the office by Nick, and he even tacitly and\nironically wished his kinsman's friend joy of a colloquy with Mrs.\nDallow. Sherringham's life was spent with people, he was used to people,\nand both as host and as guest he carried the social burden in general\nlightly. He could observe, especially in the former capacity, without\nuneasiness and take the temperature without anxiety. But at present his\ncompany oppressed him; he felt worried and that he showed it--which was\nthe thing in the world he had ever held least an honour to a gentleman\ndedicated to diplomacy. He was vexed with the levity that had made him\ncall his roomful together on so poor a pretext, and yet was vexed with\nthe stupidity that made the witnesses so evidently find the pretext\nsufficient. He inwardly groaned at the delusion under which he had\nsaddled himself with the Tragic Muse--a tragic muse who was strident and\npert--and yet wished his visitors would go away and leave him alone with\nher.\n\nNick Dormer said to Mrs. Dallow that he wanted her to know an old friend\nof his, one of the cleverest men he knew; and he added the hope that she\nwould be gentle and encouraging with him; he was so timid and so easily\ndisconcerted. Mr. Nash hereupon dropped into a chair by the arm of her\nsofa, their companion went away, and Mrs. Dallow turned her glance upon\nher new acquaintance without a perceptible change of position. Then she\nemitted with rapidity the remark: \"It's very awkward when people are\ntold one's clever.\"\n\n\"It's only awkward if one isn't,\" Gabriel smiled.\n\n\"Yes, but so few people are--enough to be talked about.\"\n\n\"Isn't that just the reason why such a matter, such an exception, ought\nto be mentioned to them?\" he asked. \"They mightn't find it out for\nthemselves. Of course, however, as you say, there ought to be a\ncertainty; then they're surer to know it. Dormer's a dear fellow, but\nhe's rash and superficial.\"\n\nMrs. Dallow, at this incitement, turned her glance a second time on her\nvisitor; but during the rest of the conversation she rarely repeated the\nmovement. If she liked Nick Dormer extremely--and it may without more\ndelay be communicated to the reader that she did--her liking was of a\nkind that opposed no difficulty whatever to her not liking, in case of\nsuch a complication, a person attached or otherwise belonging to him. It\nwas not in her nature to \"put up\" with others for the sake of an\nindividual she loved: the putting up was usually consumed in the loving,\nand with nothing left over. If the affection that isolates and\nsimplifies its object may be distinguished from the affection that seeks\ncommunications and contracts for it, Julia Dallow's was quite of the\nencircling, not to say the narrowing sort. She was not so much jealous\nas essentially exclusive. She desired no experience for the familiar and\nyet partly unsounded kinsman in whom she took an interest that she\nwouldn't have desired for herself; and indeed the cause of her interest\nin him was partly the vision of his helping her to the particular\nextensions she did desire--the taste and thrill of great affairs and of\npublic action. To have such ambitions for him appeared to her the\nhighest honour she could do him; her conscience was in it as well as her\ninclination, and her scheme, to her sense, was noble enough to varnish\nover any disdain she might feel for forces drawing him another way. She\nhad a prejudice, in general, against his existing connexions, a\nsuspicion of them, and a supply of off-hand contempt in waiting. It was\na singular circumstance that she was sceptical even when, knowing her as\nwell as he did, he thought them worth recommending to her: the\nrecommendation indeed mostly confirmed the suspicion.\n\nThis was a law from which Gabriel Nash was condemned to suffer, if\nsuffering could on any occasion be predicated of Gabriel Nash. His\npretension was in truth that he had purged his life of such\npossibilities of waste, though probably he would have admitted that if\nthat fair vessel should spring a leak the wound in its side would have\nbeen dealt by a woman's hand. In dining two evenings before with her\nbrother and with the Dormers Mrs. Dallow had been moved to exclaim that\nPeter and Nick knew the most extraordinary people. As regards Peter the\nattitudinising girl and her mother now pointed that moral with\nsufficient vividness; so that there was little arrogance in taking a\nsimilar quality for granted of the conceited man at her elbow, who sat\nthere as if he might be capable from one moment to another of leaning\nover the arm of her sofa. She had not the slightest wish to talk with\nhim about himself, and was afraid for an instant that he was on the\npoint of passing from the chapter of his cleverness to that of his\ntimidity. It was a false alarm, however, for he only animadverted on the\npleasures of the elegant extract hurled--literally _hurl\u00c3\u00a9_ in\ngeneral--from the centre of the room at one's defenceless head. He\nintimated that in his opinion these pleasures were all for the\nperformers. The auditors had at any rate given Miss Rooth a charming\nafternoon; that of course was what Mrs. Dallow's kind brother had mainly\nintended in arranging the little party. (Julia hated to hear him call\nher brother \"kind\": the term seemed offensively patronising.) But he\nhimself, he related, was now constantly employed in the same\nbeneficence, listening two-thirds of his time to \"intonations\" and\nshrieks. She had doubtless observed it herself, how the great current of\nthe age, the adoration of the mime, was almost too strong for any\nindividual; how it swept one along and dashed one against the rocks. As\nshe made no response to this proposition Gabriel Nash asked her if she\nhadn't been struck with the main sign of the time, the preponderance of\nthe mountebank, the glory and renown, the personal favour, he enjoyed.\nHadn't she noticed what an immense part of the public attention he held\nin London at least? For in Paris society was not so pervaded with him,\nand the women of the profession, in particular, were not in every\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Mrs. Dallow said. \"I know nothing of any\nsuch people.\"\n\n\"Aren't they under your feet wherever you turn--their performances,\ntheir portraits, their speeches, their autobiographies, their names,\ntheir manners, their ugly mugs, as the people say, and their idiotic\npretensions?\"\n\n\"I daresay it depends on the places one goes to. If they're\neverywhere\"--and she paused a moment--\"I don't go everywhere.\"\n\n\"I don't go anywhere, but they mount on my back at home like the Old Man\nof the Sea. Just observe a little when you return to London,\" Mr. Nash\nwent on with friendly instructiveness. Julia got up at this--she didn't\nlike receiving directions; but no other corner of the room appeared to\noffer her any particular reason for crossing to it: she never did such a\nthing without a great inducement. So she remained standing there as if\nshe were quitting the place in a moment, which indeed she now\ndetermined to do; and her interlocutor, rising also, lingered beside\nher unencouraged but unperturbed. He proceeded to remark that Mr.\nSherringham was quite right to offer Miss Rooth an afternoon's sport;\nshe deserved it as a fine, brave, amiable girl. She was highly educated,\nknew a dozen languages, was of illustrious lineage, and was immensely\nparticular.\n\n\"Immensely particular?\" Mrs. Dallow repeated.\n\n\"Perhaps I should say rather that her mother's so on her behalf.\nParticular about the sort of people they meet--the tone, the standard.\nI'm bound to say they're like _you_: they don't go everywhere. That\nspirit's not so common in the mob calling itself good society as not to\ndeserve mention.\"\n\nShe said nothing for a moment; she looked vaguely round the room, but\nnot at Miriam Rooth. Nevertheless she presently dropped as in forced\nreference to her an impatient shake. \"She's dreadfully vulgar.\"\n\n\"Ah don't say that to my friend Dormer!\" Mr. Nash laughed.\n\n\"Are you and he such great friends?\" Mrs. Dallow asked, meeting his\neyes.\n\n\"Great enough to make me hope we shall be greater.\"\n\nAgain for a little she said nothing, but then went on: \"Why shouldn't I\nsay to him that she's vulgar?\"\n\n\"Because he admires her so much. He wants to paint her.\"\n\n\"To paint her?\"\n\n\"To paint her portrait.\"\n\n\"Oh I see. I daresay she'd do for that.\"\n\nMr. Nash showed further amusement. \"If that's your opinion of her you're\nnot very complimentary to the art he aspires to practise.\"\n\n\"He aspires to practise?\" she echoed afresh.\n\n\"Haven't you talked with him about it? Ah you must keep him up to it!\"\n\nJulia Dallow was conscious for a moment of looking uncomfortable; but it\nrelieved her to be able to demand of her neighbour with a certain\nmanner: \"Are you an artist?\"\n\n\"I try to be,\" Nash smiled, \"but I work in such difficult material.\"\n\nHe spoke this with such a clever suggestion of mysterious things that\nshe was to hear herself once more pay him the attention of taking him\nup. \"Difficult material?\"\n\n\"I work in life!\"\n\nAt this she turned away, leaving him the impression that she probably\nmisunderstood his speech, thinking he meant that he drew from the living\nmodel or some such platitude: as if there could have been any likelihood\nhe would have dealings with the dead. This indeed would not fully have\nexplained the abruptness with which she dropped their conversation.\nGabriel, however, was used to sudden collapses and even to sudden\nruptures on the part of those addressed by him, and no man had more the\nsecret of remaining gracefully with his conversational wares on his\nhands. He saw Mrs. Dallow approach Nick Dormer, who was talking with one\nof the ladies of the embassy, and apparently signify that she wished to\nspeak to him. He got up and they had a minute's talk, after which he\nturned and took leave of his fellow-visitors. She said a word to her\nbrother, Nick joined her, and they then came together to the door. In\nthis movement they had to pass near Nash, and it gave her an opportunity\nto nod good-bye to him, which he was by no means sure she would have\ndone if Nick hadn't been with her. The young man just stopped; he said\nto Nash: \"I should like to see you this evening late. You must meet me\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Well take a walk--I should like that,\" Nash replied. \"I shall smoke a\ncigar at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the corner of the Place de l'Op\u00c3\u00a9ra--you'll find me\nthere.\" He prepared to compass his own departure, but before doing so he\naddressed himself to the duty of a few civil words to Lady Agnes. This\neffort proved vain, for on one side she was defended by the wall of the\nroom and on the other rendered inaccessible by Miriam's mother, who\nclung to her with a quickly-rooted fidelity, showing no symptom of\ndesistance. Nash declined perforce upon her daughter Grace, who said to\nhim: \"You were talking with my cousin Mrs. Dallow.\"\n\n\"To her rather than with her,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Ah she's very charming,\" Grace said.\n\n\"She's very beautiful.\"\n\n\"And very clever,\" the girl continued.\n\n\"Very, very intelligent.\" His conversation with Miss Dormer went little\nbeyond this, and he presently took leave of Peter Sherringham, remarking\nto him as they shook hands that he was very sorry for him. But he had\ncourted his fate.\n\n\"What do you mean by my fate?\" Sherringham asked.\n\n\"You've got them for life.\"\n\n\"Why for life, when I now clearly and courageously recognise that she\nisn't good?\"\n\n\"Ah but she'll become so,\" said Gabriel Nash.\n\n\"Do you think that?\" Sherringham brought out with a candour that made\nhis visitor laugh.\n\n\"_You_ will--that's more to the purpose!\" the latter declared as he went\naway.\n\nTen minutes later Lady Agnes substituted a general, vague assent for all\nfurther particular ones, drawing off from Mrs. Rooth and from the rest\nof the company with her daughters. Peter had had very little talk with\nBiddy, but the girl kept her disappointment out of her pretty eyes and\nsaid to him: \"You told us she didn't know how--but she does!\" There was\nno suggestion of disappointment in this.\n\nSherringham held her hand a moment. \"Ah it's you who know how, dear\nBiddy!\" he answered; and he was conscious that if the occasion had been\nmore private he would have all lawfully kissed her.\n\nPresently three more of his guests took leave, and Mr. Nash's assurance\nthat he had them for life recurred to him as he observed that Mrs. Rooth\nand her damsel quite failed to profit by so many examples. The Lovicks\nremained--a colleague and his sociable wife--and Peter gave them a hint\nthat they were not to plant him there only with the two ladies. Miriam\nquitted Mrs. Lovick, who had attempted, with no great subtlety, to\nengage her, and came up to her host as if she suspected him of a design\nof stealing from the room and had the idea of preventing it.\n\n\"I want some more tea: will you give me some more? I feel quite faint.\nYou don't seem to suspect how this sort of thing takes it out of one.\"\n\nPeter apologised extravagantly for not having seen to it that she had\nproper refreshment, and took her to the round table, in a corner, on\nwhich the little collation had been served. He poured out tea for her\nand pressed bread and butter on her and _petits fours_, of all which she\nprofusely and methodically partook. It was late; the afternoon had faded\nand a lamp been brought in, the wide shade of which shed a fair glow on\nthe tea-service and the plates of pretty food. The Lovicks sat with Mrs.\nRooth at the other end of the room, and the girl stood at the table,\ndrinking her tea and eating her bread and butter. She consumed these\narticles so freely that he wondered if she had been truly in want of a\nmeal--if they were so poor as to have to count with that sort of\nprivation. This supposition was softening, but still not so much so as\nto make him ask her to sit down. She appeared indeed to prefer to stand:\nshe looked better so, as if the freedom, the conspicuity of being on her\nfeet and treading a stage were agreeable to her. While Sherringham\nlingered near her all vaguely, his hands in his pockets and his mind now\nvoid of everything but a planned evasion of the theatrical\nquestion--there were moments when he was so plentifully tired of it--she\nbroke out abruptly: \"Confess you think me intolerably bad!\"\n\n\"Intolerably--no.\"\n\n\"Only tolerably! I find that worse.\"\n\n\"Every now and then you do something very right,\" Sherringham said.\n\n\"How many such things did I do to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh three or four. I don't know that I counted very carefully.\"\n\nShe raised her cup to her lips, looking at him over the rim of it--a\nproceeding that gave her eyes a strange expression. \"It bores you and\nyou think it disagreeable,\" she then said--\"I mean a girl always talking\nabout herself.\" He protested she could never bore him and she added: \"Oh\nI don't want compliments--I want the hard, the precious truth. An\nactress has to talk about herself. What else can she talk about, poor\nvain thing?\"\n\n\"She can talk sometimes about other actresses.\"\n\n\"That comes to the same thing. You won't be serious. I'm awfully\nserious.\" There was something that caught his attention in the note of\nthis--a longing half hopeless, half argumentative to be believed in. \"If\none really wants to do anything one must worry it out; of course\neverything doesn't come the first day,\" she kept on. \"I can't see\neverything at once; but I can see a little more--step by step--as I go;\ncan't I?\"\n\n\"That's the way--that's the way,\" he gently enough returned. \"When you\nsee the things to do the art of doing them will come--if you hammer\naway. The great point's to see them.\"\n\n\"Yes; and you don't think me clever enough for that.\"\n\n\"Why do you say so when I've asked you to come here on purpose?\"\n\n\"You've asked me to come, but I've had no success.\"\n\n\"On the contrary; every one thought you wonderful.\"\n\n\"Oh but they don't know!\" said Miriam Rooth. \"You've not said a word to\nme. I don't mind your not having praised me; that would be too banal.\nBut if I'm bad--and I know I'm dreadful--I wish you'd talk to me about\nit.\"\n\n\"It's delightful to talk to you,\" Peter found himself saying.\n\n\"No, it isn't, but it's kind\"; and she looked away from him.\n\nHer voice had with this a quality which made him exclaim: \"Every now and\nthen you 'say' something--!\"\n\nShe turned her eyes back to him and her face had a light. \"I don't want\nit to come by accident.\" Then she added: \"If there's any good to be got\nfrom trying, from showing one's self, how can it come unless one hears\nthe simple truth, the truth that turns one inside out? It's all for\nthat--to know what one is, if one's a stick!\"\n\n\"You've great courage, you've rare qualities,\" Sherringham risked. She\nhad begun to touch him, to seem different: he was glad she had not gone.\n\nBut for a little she made no answer, putting down her empty cup and\nyearning over the table as for something more to eat. Suddenly she\nraised her head and broke out with vehemence: \"I will, I will, I will!\"\n\n\"You'll do what you want, evidently.\"\n\n\"I _will_ succeed--I _will_ be great. Of course I know too little, I've\nseen too little. But I've always liked it; I've never liked anything\nelse. I used to learn things and do scenes and rant about the room when\nI was but five years old.\" She went on, communicative, persuasive,\nfamiliar, egotistical (as was necessary), and slightly common, or\nperhaps only natural; with reminiscences, reasons, and anecdotes, an\nunexpected profusion, and with an air of comradeship, of freedom in any\nrelation, which seemed to plead that she was capable at least of\nembracing that side of the profession she desired to adopt. He noted\nthat if she had seen very little, as she said, she had also seen a great\ndeal; but both her experience and her innocence had been accidental and\nirregular. She had seen very little acting--the theatre was always too\nexpensive. If she could only go often--in Paris for instance every night\nfor six months--to see the best, the worst, everything, she would make\nthings out, would observe and learn what to do, what not to do: it would\nbe a school of schools. But she couldn't without selling the clothes off\nher back. It was vile and disgusting to be poor, and if ever she were to\nknow the bliss of having a few francs in her pocket she would make up\nfor it--that she could promise! She had never been acquainted with any\none who could tell her anything--if it was good or bad or right or\nwrong--except Mrs. Delamere and poor Ruggieri. She supposed they had\ntold her a great deal, but perhaps they hadn't, and she was perfectly\nwilling to give it up if it was bad. Evidently Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 thought so;\nshe thought it was horrid. Wasn't it perfectly divine, the way the old\nwoman had said those verses, those speeches of C\u00c3\u00a9lie? If she would only\nlet her come and listen to her once in a while like that it was all she\nwould ask. She had got lots of ideas just from that half-hour; she had\npractised them over, over, and over again, the moment she got home. He\nmight ask her mother--he might ask the people next door. If Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\ndidn't think she could work, she might have heard, could she have\nlistened at the door, something that would show her. But she didn't\nthink her even good enough to criticise--since that wasn't criticism,\ntelling her her head was good. Of course her head was good--she needn't\ntravel up to the _quartiers excentriques_ to find that out. It was her\nmother, the way she talked, who gave the idea that she wanted to be\nelegant and moral and a _femme du monde_ and all that sort of trash. Of\ncourse that put people off, when they were only thinking of the real\nright way. Didn't she know, Miriam herself, that this was the one thing\nto think of? But any one would be kind to her mother who knew what a\ndear she was. \"She doesn't know when any thing's right or wrong, but\nshe's a perfect saint,\" said the girl, obscuring considerably her\nvindication. \"She doesn't mind when I say things over by the hour,\ndinning them into her ears while she sits there and reads. She's a\ntremendous reader; she's awfully up in literature. She taught me\neverything herself. I mean all that sort of thing. Of course I'm not so\nfond of reading; I go in for the book of life.\" Sherringham wondered if\nher mother had not at any rate taught her that phrase--he thought it\nhighly probable. \"It would give on _my_ nerves, the life I lead her,\"\nMiriam continued; \"but she's really a delicious woman.\"\n\nThe oddity of this epithet made Peter laugh, and altogether, in a few\nminutes, which is perhaps a sign that he abused his right to be a man of\nmoods, the young lady had produced in him a revolution of curiosity, set\nhis sympathy in motion. Her mixture, as it spread itself before him, was\nan appeal and a challenge: she was sensitive and dense, she was\nunderbred and fine. Certainly she was very various, and that was rare;\nquite not at this moment the heavy-eyed, frightened creature who had\npulled herself together with such an effort at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's, nor the\nelated \"phenomenon\" who had just been declaiming, nor the rather\naffected and contradictious young person with whom he had walked home\nfrom the Rue de Constantinople. Was this succession of phases a sign she\nwas really a case of the celebrated artistic temperament, the nature\nthat made people provoking and interesting? That Sherringham himself was\nof this shifting complexion is perhaps proved by his odd capacity for\nbeing of two different minds very nearly at the same time. Miriam was\npretty now, with felicities and graces, with charming, unusual eyes.\nYes, there were things he could do for her; he had already forgotten the\nchill of Mr. Nash's irony, of his prophecy. He was even scarce conscious\nhow little in general he liked hints, insinuations, favours asked\nobliquely and plaintively: that was doubtless also because the girl was\nsuddenly so taking and so fraternising. Perhaps indeed it was unjust to\nqualify as roundabout the manner in which Miss Rooth conveyed that it\nwas open to him not only to pay for her lessons, but to meet the expense\nof her nightly attendance with her mother at instructive exhibitions of\ntheatrical art. It was a large order, sending the pair to all the plays;\nbut what Peter now found himself thinking of was not so much its\nlargeness as the possible interest of going with them sometimes and\npointing the moral--the technical one--of showing her the things he\nliked, the things he disapproved. She repeated her declaration that she\nrecognised the fallacy of her mother's view of heroines impossibly\nvirtuous and of the importance of her looking out for such tremendously\nproper people. \"One must let her talk, but of course it creates a\nprejudice,\" she said with her eyes on Mr. and Mrs. Lovick, who had got\nup, terminating their communion with Mrs. Rooth. \"It's a great muddle, I\nknow, but she can't bear anything coarse or nasty--and quite right too.\nI shouldn't either if I didn't have to. But I don't care a sou where I\ngo if I can get to act, or who they are if they'll help me. I want to\nact--that's what I want to do; I don't want to meddle in people's\naffairs. I can look out for myself--I'm all right!\" the girl exclaimed\nroundly, frankly, with a ring of honesty which made her crude and pure.\n\"As for doing the bad ones I'm not afraid of that.\"\n\n\"The bad ones?\"\n\n\"The bad women in the plays--like Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. I'll do any vile\ncreature.\"\n\n\"I think you'll do best what you are\"--and Sherringham laughed for the\ninterest of it. \"You're a strange girl.\"\n\n\"_Je crois bien_! Doesn't one have to be, to want to go and exhibit\none's self to a loathsome crowd, on a platform, with trumpets and a big\ndrum, for money--to parade one's body and one's soul?\"\n\nHe looked at her a moment: her face changed constantly; now it had a\nfine flush and a noble delicacy. \"Give it up. You're too good for it,\"\nhe found himself pleading. \"I doubt if you've an idea of what girls have\nto go through.\"\n\n\"Never, never--never till I'm pelted!\" she cried.\n\n\"Then stay on here a bit. I'll take you to the theatres.\"\n\n\"Oh you dear!\" Miriam delightedly exclaimed. Mr. and Mrs. Lovick,\naccompanied by Mrs. Rooth, now crossed the room to them, and the girl\nwent on in the same tone: \"Mamma dear, he's the best friend we've ever\nhad--he's a great deal nicer than I thought.\"\n\n\"So are you, mademoiselle,\" said Peter Sherringham.\n\n\"Oh, I trust Mr. Sherringham--I trust him infinitely,\" Mrs. Rooth\nreturned, covering him with her mild, respectable, wheedling eyes. \"The\nkindness of every one has been beyond everything. Mr. and Mrs. Lovick\ncan't say enough. They make the most obliging offers. They want you to\nknow their brother.\"\n\n\"Oh I say, he's no brother of mine,\" Mr. Lovick protested\ngood-naturedly.\n\n\"They think he'll be so suggestive, he'll put us up to the right\nthings,\" Mrs. Rooth went on.\n\n\"It's just a little brother of mine--such a dear, amusing, clever boy,\"\nMrs. Lovick explained.\n\n\"Do you know she has got nine? Upon my honour she has!\" said her\nhusband. \"This one is the sixth. Fancy if I had to take them all over!\"\n\n\"Yes, it makes it rather awkward,\" Mrs. Lovick amiably conceded. \"He has\ngone on the stage, poor darling--but he acts rather well.\"\n\n\"He tried for the diplomatic service, but he didn't precisely dazzle his\nexaminers,\" Mr. Lovick further mentioned.\n\n\"Edmund's very nasty about him. There are lots of gentlemen on the\nstage--he's not the first.\"\n\n\"It's such a comfort to hear that,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you. Has he got a theatre?\" Miriam asked.\n\n\"My dear young lady, he hasn't even got an engagement,\" replied the\nyoung man's terrible brother-in-law.\n\n\"He hasn't been at it very long, but I'm sure he'll get on. He's\nimmensely in earnest and very good-looking. I just said that if he\nshould come over to see us you might rather like to meet him. He might\ngive you some tips, as my husband says.\"\n\n\"I don't care for his looks, but I should like his tips,\" Miriam\nliberally smiled.\n\n\"And is he coming over to see you?\" asked Sherringham, to whom, while\nthis exchange of remarks, which he had not lost, was going on, Mrs.\nRooth had in lowered accents addressed herself.\n\n\"Not if I can help it I think!\" But Mr. Lovick was so gaily rude that it\nwasn't embarrassing.\n\n\"Oh sir, I'm sure you're fond of him,\" Mrs. Rooth remonstrated as the\nparty passed together into the antechamber.\n\n\"No, really, I like some of the others--four or five of them; but I\ndon't like Arty.\"\n\n\"We'll make it up to him, then; _we_'ll like him,\" Miriam answered with\nspirit; and her voice rang in the staircase--Sherringham attended them a\nlittle way--with a charm which her host had rather missed in her\nloudness of the day before.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nNick Dormer found his friend Nash that evening at the place of their\ntryst--smoking a cigar, in the warm bright night, on the terrace of the\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9 forming one of the angles of the Place de l'Op\u00c3\u00a9ra. He sat down with\nhim, but at the end of five minutes uttered a protest against the crush\nand confusion, the publicity and vulgarity of the place, the shuffling\nprocession of the crowd, the jostle of fellow-customers, the perpetual\nbrush of waiters. \"Come away; I want to talk to you and I can't talk\nhere. I don't care where we go. It will be pleasant to walk; well stroll\naway to the _quartiers s\u00c3\u00a9rieux_. Each time I come to Paris I at the end\nof three days take the Boulevard, with its conventional grimace, into\ngreater aversion. I hate even to cross it--I go half a mile round to\navoid it.\"\n\nThe young men took their course together down the Rue de la Paix to the\nRue de Rivoli, which they crossed, passing beside the gilded rails of\nthe Tuileries. The beauty of the night--the only defect of which was\nthat the immense illumination of Paris kept it from being quite night\nenough, made it a sort of bedizened, rejuvenated day--gave a charm to\nthe quieter streets, drew our friends away to the right, to the river\nand the bridges, the older, duskier city. The pale ghost of the palace\nthat had perished by fire hung over them a while, and, by the passage\nnow open at all times across the garden of the Tuileries, they came out\nupon the Seine. They kept on and on, moving slowly, smoking, talking,\npausing, stopping to look, to emphasise, to compare. They fell into\ndiscussion, into confidence, into inquiry, sympathetic or satiric, and\ninto explanations which needed in turn to be explained. The balmy night,\nthe time for talk, the amusement of Paris, the memory of younger\npassages, gave a lift to the occasion. Nick had already forgotten his\nlittle brush with Julia on his leaving Peter's tea-party at her side,\nand that he had been almost disconcerted by the asperity with which she\ndenounced the odious man he had taken it into his head to force upon\nher. Impertinent and fatuous she had called him; and when Nick began to\nplead that he was really neither of these things, though he could\nimagine his manner might sometimes suggest them, she had declared that\nshe didn't wish to argue about him or ever to hear of him again. Nick\nhadn't counted on her liking Gabriel Nash, but had thought her not\nliking him wouldn't perceptibly matter. He had given himself the\ndiversion, not cruel surely to any one concerned, of seeing what she\nwould make of a type she had never before met. She had made even less\nthan he expected, and her intimation that he had played her a trick had\nbeen irritating enough to prevent his reflecting that the offence might\nhave been in some degree with Nash. But he had recovered from his\nresentment sufficiently to ask this personage, with every possible\ncircumstance of implied consideration for the lady, what had been the\nimpression made by his charming cousin.\n\n\"Upon my word, my dear fellow, I don't regard that as a fair question,\"\nGabriel said. \"Besides, if you think Mrs. Dallow charming what on earth\nneed it matter to you what I think? The superiority of one man's\nopinion over another's is never so great as when the opinion's about a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"It was to help me to find out what I think of yourself,\" Nick returned.\n\n\"Oh, that you'll never do. I shall bewilder you to the end. The lady\nwith whom you were so good as to make me acquainted is a beautiful\nspecimen of the English garden-flower, the product of high cultivation\nand much tending; a tall, delicate stem with the head set upon it in a\nmanner which, as a thing seen and remembered, should doubtless count for\nus as a gift of the gods. She's the perfect type of the object _raised_\nor bred, and everything about her hangs together and conduces to the\neffect, from the angle of her elbow to the way she drops that vague,\nconventional, dry little 'Oh!' which dispenses with all further\nperformance. That degree of completeness is always satisfying. But I\ndidn't satisfy her, and she didn't understand me. I don't think they\nusually understand.\"\n\n\"She's no worse than I then.\"\n\n\"Ah she didn't try.\"\n\n\"No, she doesn't try. But she probably thought you a monster of conceit,\nand she would think so still more if she were to hear you talk about her\ntrying.\"\n\n\"Very likely--very likely,\" said Gabriel Nash. \"I've an idea a good many\npeople think that. It strikes me as comic. I suppose it's a result of my\nlittle system.\"\n\n\"What little system?\"\n\n\"Oh nothing more wonderful than the idea of being just the same to every\none. People have so bemuddled themselves that the last thing they can\nconceive is that one should be simple.\"\n\n\"Lord, do you call yourself simple?\" Nick ejaculated.\n\n\"Absolutely; in the sense of having no interest of my own to push, no\nnostrum to advertise, no power to conciliate, no axe to grind. I'm not a\nsavage--ah far from it!--but I really think I'm perfectly independent.\"\n\n\"Well, that's always provoking!\" Nick knowingly returned.\n\n\"So it would appear, to the great majority of one's fellow-mortals; and\nI well remember the pang with which I originally made that discovery. It\ndarkened my spirit at a time when I had no thought of evil. What we\nlike, when we're unregenerate, is that a new-comer should give us a\npassword, come over to our side, join our little camp or religion, get\ninto our little boat, in short, whatever it is, and help us to row it.\nIt's natural enough; we're mostly in different tubs and cockles,\npaddling for life. Our opinions, our convictions and doctrines and\nstandards, are simply the particular thing that will make the boat\ngo--_our boat_, naturally, for they may very often be just the thing\nthat will sink another. If you won't get in people generally hate you.\"\n\n\"Your metaphor's very lame,\" said Nick. \"It's the overcrowded boat that\ngoes to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Oh I'll give it another leg or two! Boats can be big, in the infinite\nof space, and a doctrine's a raft that floats the better the more\npassengers it carries. A passenger jumps over from time to time, not so\nmuch from fear of sinking as from a want of interest in the course or\nthe company. He swims, he plunges, he dives, he dips down and visits the\nfishes and the mermaids and the submarine caves; he goes from craft to\ncraft and splashes about, on his own account, in the blue, cool water.\nThe regenerate, as I call them, are the passengers who jump over in\nsearch of better fun. I jumped over long ago.\"\n\n\"And now of course you're at the head of the regenerate; for, in your\nturn\"--Nick found the figure delightful--\"you all form a select school\nof porpoises.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, and I know nothing about heads--in the sense you mean. I've\ngrown a tail if you will; I'm the merman wandering free. It's the\njolliest of trades!\"\n\nBefore they had gone many steps further Nick Dormer stopped short with a\nquestion. \"I say, my dear fellow, do you mind mentioning to me whether\nyou're the greatest humbug and charlatan on earth, or a genuine\nintelligence, one that has sifted things for itself?\"\n\n\"I do lead your poor British wit a dance--I'm so sorry,\" Nash replied\nbenignly. \"But I'm very sincere. And I _have_ tried to straighten out\nthings a bit for myself.\"\n\n\"Then why do you give people such a handle?\"\n\n\"Such a handle?\"\n\n\"For thinking you're an--for thinking you're a mere _farceur_.\"\n\n\"I daresay it's my manner: they're so unused to any sort of candour.\"\n\n\"Well then why don't you try another?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"One has the manner that one can, and mine moreover's a part of my\nlittle system.\"\n\n\"Ah if you make so much of your little system you're no better than any\none else,\" Nick returned as they went on.\n\n\"I don't pretend to be better, for we're all miserable sinners; I only\npretend to be bad in a pleasanter, brighter way--by what I can see. It's\nthe simplest thing in the world; just take for granted our right to be\nhappy and brave. What's essentially kinder and more helpful than that,\nwhat's more beneficent? But the tradition of dreariness, of stodginess,\nof dull, dense, literal prose, has so sealed people's eyes that they've\nended by thinking the most natural of all things the most perverse. Why\nso keep up the dreariness, in our poor little day? No one can tell me\nwhy, and almost every one calls me names for simply asking the question.\nBut I go on, for I believe one can do a little good by it. I want so\nmuch to do a little good,\" Gabriel Nash continued, taking his\ncompanion's arm. \"My persistence is systematic: don't you see what I\nmean? I won't be dreary--no, no, no; and I won't recognise the\nnecessity, or even, if there be any way out of it, the accident, of\ndreariness in the life that surrounds me. That's enough to make people\nstare: they're so damned stupid!\"\n\n\"They think you so damned impudent,\" Nick freely explained.\n\nAt this Nash stopped him short with a small cry, and, turning his eyes,\nNick saw under the lamps of the quay that he had brought a flush of pain\ninto his friend's face. \"I don't strike you that way?\"\n\n\"Oh 'me!' Wasn't it just admitted that I don't in the least make you\nout?\"\n\n\"That's the last thing!\" Nash declared, as if he were thinking the idea\nover, with an air of genuine distress. \"But with a little patience we'll\nclear it up together--if you care enough about it,\" he added more\ncheerfully. Letting his companion proceed again he continued: \"Heaven\nhelp us all, what do people mean by impudence? There are many, I think,\nwho don't understand its nature or its limits; and upon my word I've\nliterally seen mere quickness of intelligence or of perception, the jump\nof a step or two, a little whirr of the wings of talk, mistaken for it.\nYes, I've encountered men and women who thought you impudent if you\nweren't simply so stupid as they. The only impudence is unprovoked, or\neven mere dull, aggression, and I indignantly protest that I'm never\nguilty of _that_ clumsiness. Ah for what do they take one, with _their_\nbeastly presumption? Even to defend myself sometimes I've to make\nbelieve to myself that I care. I always feel as if I didn't successfully\nmake others think so. Perhaps they see impudence in that. But I daresay\nthe offence is in the things that I take, as I say, for granted; for if\none tries to be pleased one passes perhaps inevitably for being pleased\nabove all with one's self. That's really not my case--I find my capacity\nfor pleasure deplorably below the mark I've set. This is why, as I've\ntold you, I cultivate it, I try to bring it up. And I'm actuated by\npositive benevolence; I've that impudent pretension. That's what I mean\nby being the same to every one, by having only one manner. If one's\nconscious and ingenious to that end what's the harm--when one's motives\nare so pure? By never, _never_ making the concession, one may end by\nbecoming a perceptible force for good.\"\n\n\"What concession are you talking about, in God's name?\" Nick demanded.\n\n\"Why, that we're here all for dreariness. It's impossible to grant it\nsometimes if you wish to deny it ever.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean then by dreariness? That's modern slang and\nterribly vague. Many good things are dreary--virtue and decency and\ncharity, and perseverance and courage and honour.\"\n\n\"Say at once that life's dreary, my dear fellow!\" Gabriel Nash\nexclaimed.\n\n\"That's on the whole my besetting impression.\"\n\n\"_Cest l\u00c3\u00a0 que je vous attends!_ I'm precisely engaged in trying what can\nbe done in taking it the other way. It's my little personal experiment.\nLife consists of the personal experiments of each of us, and the point\nof an experiment is that it shall succeed. What we contribute is our\ntreatment of the material, our rendering of the text, our style. A sense\nof the qualities of a style is so rare that many persons should\ndoubtless be forgiven for not being able to read, or at all events to\nenjoy, us; but is that a reason for giving it up--for not being, in this\nother sphere, if one possibly can, an Addison, a Ruskin, a Renan? Ah we\nmust write our best; it's the great thing we can do in the world, on the\nright side. One has one's form, _que diable_, and a mighty good thing\nthat one has. I'm not afraid of putting all life into mine, and without\nunduly squeezing it. I'm not afraid of putting in honour and courage and\ncharity--without spoiling them: on the contrary I shall only do them\ngood. People may not read you at sight, may not like you, but there's a\nchance they'll come round; and the only way to court the chance is to\nkeep it up--always to keep it up. That's what I do, my dear man--if you\ndon't think I've perseverance. If some one's touched here and there, if\nyou give a little impression of truth and charm, that's your reward;\nbesides of course the pleasure for yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't you think your style's a trifle affected?\" Nick asked for further\namusement.\n\n\"That's always the charge against a personal manner: if you've any at\nall people think you've too much. Perhaps, perhaps--who can say? The\nlurking unexpressed is infinite, and affectation must have begun, long\nago, with the first act of reflective expression--the substitution of\nthe few placed articulate words for the cry or the thump or the hug. Of\ncourse one isn't perfect; but that's the delightful thing about art,\nthat there's always more to learn and more to do; it grows bigger the\nmore one uses it and meets more questions the more they come up. No\ndoubt I'm rough still, but I'm in the right direction: I make it my\nbusiness to testify for the fine.\"\n\n\"Ah the fine--there it stands, over there!\" said Nick Dormer. \"I'm not\nso sure about yours--I don't know what I've got hold of. But Notre Dame\n_is_ truth; Notre Dame _is_ charm; on Notre Dame the distracted mind can\nrest. Come over with me and look at her!\"\n\nThey had come abreast of the low island from which the great cathedral,\ndisengaged to-day from her old contacts and adhesions, rises high and\nfair, with her front of beauty and her majestic mass, darkened at that\nhour, or at least simplified, under the stars, but only more serene and\nsublime for her happy union far aloft with the cool distance and the\nnight. Our young men, fantasticating as freely as I leave the reader to\nestimate, crossed the wide, short bridge which made them face toward the\nmonuments of old Paris--the Palais de Justice, the Conciergerie, the\nholy chapel of Saint Louis. They came out before the church, which looks\ndown on a square where the past, once so thick in the very heart of\nParis, has been made rather a blank, pervaded however by the everlasting\nfreshness of the vast cathedral-face. It greeted Nick Dormer and Gabriel\nNash with a kindness the long centuries had done nothing to dim. The\nlamplight of the old city washed its foundations, but the towers and\nbuttresses, the arches, the galleries, the statues, the vast\nrose-window, the large full composition, seemed to grow clearer while\nthey climbed higher, as if they had a conscious benevolent answer for\nthe upward gaze of men.\n\n\"How it straightens things out and blows away one's vapours--anything\nthat's _done_!\" said Nick; while his companion exclaimed blandly and\naffectionately:\n\n\"The dear old thing!\"\n\n\"The great point's to do something, instead of muddling and questioning;\nand, by Jove, it makes me want to!\"\n\n\"Want to build a cathedral?\" Nash inquired.\n\n\"Yes, just that.\"\n\n\"It's you who puzzle _me_ then, my dear fellow. You can't build them out\nof words.\"\n\n\"What is it the great poets do?\" asked Nick.\n\n\"_Their_ words are ideas--their words are images, enchanting\ncollocations and unforgettable signs. But the verbiage of parliamentary\nspeeches--!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nick with a candid, reflective sigh, \"you can rear a great\nstructure of many things--not only of stones and timbers and painted\nglass.\" They walked round this example of one, pausing, criticising,\nadmiring, and discussing; mingling the grave with the gay and paradox\nwith contemplation. Behind and at the sides the huge, dusky vessel of\nthe church seemed to dip into the Seine or rise out of it, floating\nexpansively--a ship of stone with its flying buttresses thrown forth\nlike an array of mighty oars. Nick Dormer lingered near it in joy, in\nsoothing content, as if it had been the temple of a faith so dear to him\nthat there was peace and security in its precinct. And there was comfort\ntoo and consolation of the same sort in the company at this moment of\nNash's equal appreciation, of his response, by his own signs, to the\ngreat effect. He took it all in so and then so gave it all out that Nick\nwas reminded of the radiance his boyish admiration had found in him of\nold, the easy grasp of everything of that kind. \"Everything of that\nkind\" was to Nick's sense the description of a wide and bright domain.\n\nThey crossed to the farther side of the river, where the influence of\nthe Gothic monument threw a distinction even over the Parisian\nsmartnesses--the municipal rule and measure, the importunate\nsymmetries, the \"handsomeness\" of everything, the extravagance of\ngaslight, the perpetual click on the neat bridges. In front of a quiet\nlittle caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the left bank Gabriel Nash said, \"Let's sit down\"--he was\nalways ready to sit down. It was a friendly establishment and an\nunfashionable quarter, far away from the caravan-series; there were the\nusual little tables and chairs on the quay, the muslin curtains behind\nthe glazed front, the general sense of sawdust and of drippings of\nwatery beer. The place was subdued to stillness, but not extinguished,\nby the lateness of the hour; no vehicles passed, only now and then a\nlight Parisian foot. Beyond the parapet they could hear the flow of the\nSeine. Nick Dormer said it made him think of the old Paris, of the great\nRevolution, of Madame Roland, _quoi_! Gabriel said they could have\nwatery beer but were not obliged to drink it. They sat a long time; they\ntalked a great deal, and the more they said the more the unsaid came up.\nPresently Nash found occasion to throw out: \"I go about my business like\nany good citizen--that's all.\"\n\n\"And what is your business?\"\n\n\"The spectacle of the world.\"\n\nNick laughed out. \"And what do you do with that?\"\n\n\"What does any one do with spectacles? I look at it. I see.\"\n\n\"You're full of contradictions and inconsistencies,\" Nick however\nobjected. \"You described yourself to me half an hour ago as an apostle\nof beauty.\"\n\n\"Where's the inconsistency? I do it in the broad light of day, whatever\nI do: that's virtually what I meant. If I look at the spectacle of the\nworld I look in preference at what's charming in it. Sometimes I've to\ngo far to find it--very likely; but that's just what I do. I go far--as\nfar as my means permit me. Last year I heard of such a delightful little\nspot; a place where a wild fig-tree grows in the south wall, the outer\nside, of an old Spanish city. I was told it was a deliciously brown\ncorner--the sun making it warm in winter. As soon as I could I went\nthere.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I lay on the first green grass--I liked it.\"\n\n\"If that sort of thing's all you accomplish you're not encouraging.\"\n\n\"I accomplish my happiness--it seems to me that's something. I have\nfeelings, I have sensations: let me tell you that's not so common. It's\nrare to have them, and if you chance to have them it's rare not to be\nashamed of them. I go after them--when I judge they won't hurt any one.\"\n\n\"You're lucky to have money for your travelling expenses,\" said Nick.\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt; but I do it very cheap. I take my stand on my\nnature, on my fortunate character. I'm not ashamed of it, I don't think\nit's so horrible, my character. But we've so befogged and befouled the\nwhole question of liberty, of spontaneity, of good humour and\ninclination and enjoyment, that there's nothing that makes people stare\nso as to see one natural.\"\n\n\"You're always thinking too much of 'people.'\"\n\n\"They say I think too little,\" Gabriel smiled.\n\n\"Well, I've agreed to stand for Harsh,\" said Nick with a roundabout\ntransition.\n\n\"It's you then who are lucky to have money.\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" Nick explained. \"My expenses are to be paid.\"\n\n\"Then you too must think of 'people.'\"\n\nNick made no answer to this, but after a moment said: \"I wish very much\nyou had more to show for it.\"\n\n\"To show for what?\"\n\n\"Your little system--the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic life.\"\n\nNash hesitated, tolerantly, gaily, as he often did, with an air of being\nembarrassed to choose between several answers, any one of which would be\nso right. \"Oh having something to show's such a poor business. It's a\nkind of confession of failure.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're more affected than anything else,\" said Nick impatiently.\n\n\"No, my dear boy, I'm more good-natured: don't I prove it? I'm rather\ndisappointed to find you not more accessible to esoteric doctrine. But\nthere is, I confess, another plane of intelligence, honourable, and very\nhonourable, in its way, from which it may legitimately appear important\nto have something to show. If you must confine yourself to that plane I\nwon't refuse you my sympathy. After all that's what I have to show! But\nthe degree of my sympathy must of course depend on the nature of the\ndemonstration you wish to make.\"\n\n\"You know it very well--you've guessed it,\" Nick returned, looking\nbefore him in a conscious, modest way which would have been called\nsheepish had he been a few years younger.\n\n\"Ah you've broken the scent with telling me you're going back to the\nHouse of Commons,\" said Nash.\n\n\"No wonder you don't make it out! My situation's certainly absurd\nenough. What I really hanker for is to be a painter; and of portraits,\non the whole, I think. That's the abject, crude, ridiculous fact. In\nthis out-of-the-way corner, at the dead of night, in lowered tones, I\nventure to disclose it to you. Isn't that the \u00c3\u00a6sthetic life?\"\n\n\"Do you know how to paint?\" asked Nash.\n\n\"Not in the least. No element of burlesque is therefore wanting to my\nposition.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference. I'm so glad.\"\n\n\"So glad I don't know how?\"\n\n\"So glad of it all. Yes, that only makes it better. You're a delightful\ncase, and I like delightful cases. We must see it through. I rejoice I\nmet you again.\"\n\n\"Do you think I can do anything?\" Nick inquired.\n\n\"Paint good pictures? How can I tell without seeing some of your work?\nDoesn't it come back to me that at Oxford you used to sketch very\nprettily? But that's the last thing that matters.\"\n\n\"What does matter then?\" Nick asked with his eyes on his companion.\n\n\"To be on the right side--on the side of the 'fine.'\"\n\n\"There'll be precious little of the 'fine' if I produce nothing but\ndaubs.\"\n\n\"Ah you cling to the old false measure of success! I must cure you of\nthat. There'll be the beauty of having been disinterested and\nindependent; of having taken the world in the free, brave, personal\nway.\"\n\n\"I shall nevertheless paint decently if I can,\" Nick presently said.\n\n\"I'm almost sorry! It will make your case less clear, your example less\ngrand.\"\n\n\"My example will be grand enough, with the fight I shall have to make.\"\n\n\"The fight? With whom?\"\n\n\"With myself first of all. I'm awfully against it.\"\n\n\"Ah but you'll have me on the other side,\" Nash smiled.\n\n\"Well, you'll have more than a handful to meet--everything, every one\nthat belongs to me, that touches me near or far; my family, my blood, my\nheredity, my traditions, my promises, my circumstances, my prejudices;\nmy little past--such as it is; my great future--such as it has been\nsupposed it may be.\"\n\n\"I see, I see. It's splendid!\" Nash exclaimed. \"And Mrs. Dallow into the\nbargain,\" he added.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Dallow if you like.\"\n\n\"Are you in love with her?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Well, she is with you--so I understood.\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" said Nick Dormer with sudden sternness.\n\n\"Ah you are, you are!\" his companion pronounced, judging apparently from\nthis accent.\n\n\"I don't know _what_ I am--heaven help me!\" Nick broke out, tossing his\nhat down on his little tin table with vehemence. \"I'm a freak of nature\nand a sport of the mocking gods. Why should they go out of their way to\nworry me? Why should they do everything so inconsequent, so improbable,\nso preposterous? It's the vulgarest practical joke. There has never been\nanything of the sort among us; we're all Philistines to the core, with\nabout as much esthetic sense as that hat. It's excellent soil--I don't\ncomplain of it--but not a soil to grow that flower. From where the devil\nthen has the seed been dropped? I look back from generation to\ngeneration; I scour our annals without finding the least little\nsketching grandmother, any sign of a building or versifying or\ncollecting or even tulip-raising ancestor. They were all as blind as\nbats, and none the less happy for that. I'm a wanton variation, an\nunaccountable monster. My dear father, rest his soul, went through life\nwithout a suspicion that there's anything in it that can't be boiled\ninto blue-books, and became in that conviction a very distinguished\nperson. He brought me up in the same simplicity and in the hope of the\nsame eminence. It would have been better if I had remained so. I think\nit's partly your fault that I haven't,\" Nick went on. \"At Oxford you\nwere very bad company for me--my evil genius: you opened my eyes, you\ncommunicated the poison. Since then, little by little, it has been\nworking within me; vaguely, covertly, insensibly at first, but during\nthe last year or two with violence, pertinacity, cruelty. I've resorted\nto every antidote in life; but it's no use--I'm stricken. _C'est V\u00c3\u00a9nus\ntoute enti\u00c3\u00a8re \u00c3\u00a0 sa proie attach\u00c3\u00a9e_--putting Venus for 'art.' It tears me\nto pieces as I may say.\"\n\n\"I see, I follow you,\" said Nash, who had listened to this recital with\nradiant interest and curiosity. \"And that's why you are going to stand.\"\n\n\"Precisely--it's an antidote. And at present you're another.\"\n\n\"Another?\"\n\n\"That's why I jumped at you. A bigger dose of you may disagree with me\nto that extent that I shall either die or get better.\"\n\n\"I shall control the dilution,\" said Nash. \"Poor fellow--if you're\nelected!\" he added.\n\n\"Poor fellow either way. You don't know the atmosphere in which I live,\nthe horror, the scandal my apostasy would provoke, the injury and\nsuffering it would inflict. I believe it would really kill my mother.\nShe thinks my father's watching me from the skies.\"\n\n\"Jolly to make him jump!\" Nash suggested.\n\n\"He'd jump indeed--come straight down on top of me. And then the\ngrotesqueness of it--to _begin_ all of a sudden at my age.\"\n\n\"It's perfect indeed, it's too lovely a case,\" Nash raved.\n\n\"Think how it sounds--a paragraph in the London papers: 'Mr. Nicholas\nDormer, M. P. for Harsh and son of the late Right Honourable and so\nforth and so forth, is about to give up his seat and withdraw from\npublic life in order to devote himself to the practice of\nportrait-painting--and with the more commendable perseverance by reason\nof all the dreadful time he has lost. Orders, in view of this,\nrespectfully solicited.'\"\n\n\"The nineteenth century's a sweeter time than I thought,\" said Nash.\n\"It's the portrait then that haunts your dreams?\"\n\n\"I wish you could see. You must of course come immediately to my place\nin London.\"\n\n\"Perfidious wretch, you're capable of having talent--which of course\nwill spoil everything!\" Gabriel wailed.\n\n\"No, I'm too old and was too early perverted. It's too late to go\nthrough the mill.\"\n\n\"You make _me_ young! Don't miss your election at your peril. Think of\nthe edification.\"\n\n\"The edification--?\"\n\n\"Of your throwing it all up the next moment.\"\n\n\"That would be pleasant for Mr. Carteret,\" Nick brooded.\n\n\"Mr. Carteret--?\"\n\n\"A dear old family friend who'll wish to pay my agent's bill.\"\n\n\"Serve him right for such depraved tastes.\"\n\n\"You do me good,\" said Nick as he rose and turned away.\n\n\"Don't call me useless then.\"\n\n\"Ah but not in the way you mean. It's only if I don't get in that I\nshall perhaps console myself with the brush,\" Nick returned with\nhumorous, edifying elegance while they retraced their steps.\n\n\"For the sake of all the muses then don't stand. For you _will_ get in.\"\n\n\"Very likely. At any rate I've promised.\"\n\n\"You've promised Mrs. Dallow?\"\n\n\"It's her place--she'll _put_ me in,\" Nick said.\n\n\"Baleful woman! But I'll pull you out!\" cried Gabriel Nash.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nFor several days Peter Sherringham had business in hand which left him\nneither time nor freedom of mind to occupy himself actively with the\nladies of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne. There were moments when they brushed\nacross his memory, but their passage was rapid and not lighted with\ncomplacent attention; for he shrank from bringing to the proof the\nquestion of whether Miriam would be an interest or only a bore. She had\nleft him after their second meeting with a quickened sympathy, but in\nthe course of a few hours that flame had burned dim. Like most other men\nhe was a mixture of impulse and reflexion, but was peculiar in this,\nthat thinking things over almost always made him think less\nconveniently. He found illusions necessary, so that in order to keep an\nadequate number going he often forbade himself any excess of that\nexercise. Mrs. Rooth and her daughter were there and could certainly be\ntrusted to make themselves felt. He was conscious of their anxiety and\ntheir calculations as of a frequent oppression, and knew that whatever\nresults might ensue he should have to do the costly thing for them. An\nidea of tenacity, of worrying feminine duration, associated itself with\ntheir presence; he would have assented with a silent nod to the\nproposition--enunciated by Gabriel Nash--that he was saddled with them.\nRemedies hovered before him, but these figured also at the same time as\ncomplications; ranging vaguely from the expenditure of money to the\ndiscovery that he was in love. This latter accident would be\nparticularly tedious; he had a full perception of the arts by which the\ngirl's mother might succeed in making it so. It wouldn't be a\ncompensation for trouble, but a trouble which in itself would require\ncompensations. Would that balm spring from the spectacle of the young\nlady's genius? The genius would have to be very great to justify a\nrising young diplomatist in making a fool of himself.\n\nWith the excuse of pressing work he put off Miss Rooth from day to day,\nand from day to day he expected to hear her knock at his door. It would\nbe time enough when they ran him to earth again; and he was unable to\nsee how after all he could serve them even then. He had proposed\nimpetuously a course of the theatres; but that would be a considerable\npersonal effort now that the summer was about to begin--a free bid for\nbad air, stale pieces, and tired actors. When, however, more than a week\nhad elapsed without a reminder of his neglected promise it came over him\nthat he must himself in honour give a sign. There was a delicacy in such\nunexpected and such difficult discretion--he was touched by being let\nalone. The flurry of work at the embassy was over and he had time to ask\nhimself what in especial he should do. He wanted something definite to\nsuggest before communicating with the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne.\n\nAs a consequence of this speculation he went back to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 to ask\nher to reconsider her stern judgement and give the young English\nlady--to oblige him--a dozen lessons of the sort she knew so well how to\ngive. He was aware that this request scarcely stood on its feet; for in\nthe first place Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 never reconsidered when once she had got\nher impression, and in the second never wasted herself on subjects whom\nnature had not formed to do her honour. He knew his asking her to strain\na point to please him would give her a false idea--save that for that\nmatter she had it already--of his relations, actual or prospective, with\nthe girl; but he decided he needn't care for this, since Miriam herself\nprobably wouldn't care. What he had mainly in mind was to say to the old\nactress that she had been mistaken--the _jeune Anglaise_ wasn't such a\n_grue_. This would take some courage, but it would also add to the\namusement of his visit.\n\nHe found her at home, but as soon as he had expressed his conviction she\nbegan: \"Oh, your _jeune Anglaise_, I know a great deal more about her\nthan you! She has been back to see me twice; she doesn't go the longest\nway round. She charges me like a grenadier and asks me to give\nher--guess a little what!--private recitations all to herself. If she\ndoesn't succeed it won't be for want of knowing how to thump at doors.\nThe other day when I came in she was waiting for me; she had been there\ntwo hours. My private recitations--have you an idea what people pay for\nthem?\"\n\n\"Between artists, you know, there are easier conditions,\" Sherringham\nlaughed.\n\n\"How do I know if she's an artist? She won't open her mouth to me; what\nshe wants is to make me say things to _her_. She does make me--I don't\nknow how--and she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes. They look\nlike open pockets!\"\n\n\"I daresay she'll profit by it,\" said Sherringham.\n\n\"I daresay _you_ will! Her face is stupid while she watches me, and when\nshe has tired me out she simply walks away. However, as she comes\nback--!\"\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 paused a moment, listened and then cried: \"Didn't I tell\nyou?\"\n\nSherringham heard a parley of voices in the little antechamber, and the\nnext moment the door was pushed open and Miriam Rooth bounded into the\nroom. She was flushed and breathless, without a smile, very direct.\n\n\"Will you hear me to-day? I know four things,\" she immediately broke\nout. Then seeing Sherringham she added in the same brisk, earnest tone,\nas if the matter were of the highest importance: \"Oh how d'ye do? I'm\nvery glad you're here.\" She said nothing else to him than this, appealed\nto him in no way, made no allusion to his having neglected her, but\naddressed herself to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 as if he had not been there; making no\nexcuses and using no flattery; taking rather a tone of equal\nauthority--all as if the famous artist had an obvious duty toward her.\nThis was another variation Peter thought; it differed from each of the\nattitudes in which he had previously seen her. It came over him suddenly\nthat so far from there being any question of her having the histrionic\nnature she simply had it in such perfection that she was always acting;\nthat her existence was a series of parts assumed for the moment, each\nchanged for the next, before the perpetual mirror of some curiosity or\nadmiration or wonder--some spectatorship that she perceived or imagined\nin the people about her. Interested as he had ever been in the\nprofession of which she was potentially an ornament, this idea startled\nhim by its novelty and even lent, on the spot, a formidable, a really\nappalling character to Miriam Rooth. It struck him abruptly that a woman\nwhose only being was to \"make believe,\" to make believe she had any and\nevery being you might like and that would serve a purpose and produce a\ncertain effect, and whose identity resided in the continuity of her\npersonations, so that she had no moral privacy, as he phrased it to\nhimself, but lived in a high wind of exhibition, of figuration--such a\nwoman was a kind of monster in whom of necessity there would be nothing\nto \"be fond\" of, because there would be nothing to take hold of. He felt\nfor a moment how simple he had been not to have achieved before this\nanalysis of the actress. The girl's very face made it vivid to him\nnow--the discovery that she positively had no countenance of her own,\nbut only the countenance of the occasion, a sequence, a variety--capable\npossibly of becoming immense--of representative movements. She was\nalways trying them, practising them, for her amusement or profit,\njumping from one to the other and extending her range; and this would\ndoubtless be her occupation more and more as she acquired ease and\nconfidence. The expression that came nearest belonging to her, as it\nwere, was the one that came nearest being a blank--an air of inanity\nwhen she forgot herself in some act of sincere attention. Then her eye\nwas heavy and her mouth betrayed a commonness; though it was perhaps\njust at such a moment that the fine line of her head told most. She had\nlooked slightly _b\u00c3\u00aate_ even when Sherringham, on their first meeting at\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's, said to Nick Dormer that she was the image of the Tragic\nMuse.\n\nNow, at any rate, he seemed to see that she might do what she liked with\nher face. It was an elastic substance, an element of gutta-percha, like\nthe flexibility of the gymnast, the lady at the music-hall who is shot\nfrom the mouth of a cannon. He winced a little at this coarser view of\nthe actress; he had somehow always looked more poetically at that\npriestess of art. Yet what was she, the priestess, when one came to\nthink of it, but a female gymnast, a mountebank at higher wages? She\ndidn't literally hang by her heels from a trapeze and hold a fat man in\nher teeth, but she made the same use of her tongue, of her eyes, of the\nimitative trick, that her muscular sister made of leg and jaw. It was an\nodd circumstance that Miss Rooth's face seemed to him to-day a finer\ninstrument than old Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's. It was doubtless that the girl's was\nfresh and strong and had a future in it, while poor Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's was\nworn and weary and had only a past.\n\nThe old woman said something, half in jest, half in real resentment,\nabout the brutality of youth while Miriam went to a mirror and quickly\ntook off her hat, patting and arranging her hair as a preliminary to\nmaking herself heard. Sherringham saw with surprise and amusement that\nthe keen Frenchwoman, who had in her long life exhausted every\nadroitness, was in a manner helpless and coerced, obliging all in spite\nof herself. Her young friend had taken but a few days and a couple of\nvisits to become a successful force; she had imposed herself, and Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9, while she laughed--yet looked terrible too, with such high\nartifices of eye and gesture--was reduced to the last line of defence;\nthat of pronouncing her coarse and clumsy, saying she might knock her\ndown, but that this proved nothing. She spoke jestingly enough not to\noffend, but her manner betrayed the irritation of an intelligent woman\nwho at an advanced age found herself for the first time failing to\nunderstand. What she didn't understand was the kind of social product\nthus presented to her by Gabriel Nash; and this suggested to Sherringham\nthat the _jeune Anglaise_ was perhaps indeed rare, a new type, as Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9 must have seen innumerable varieties. He saw the girl was\nperfectly prepared to be abused and that her indifference to what might\nbe thought of her discretion was a proof of life, health, and spirit,\nthe insolence of conscious resources.\n\nWhen she had given herself a touch at the glass she turned round, with a\nrapid \"_Ecoutez maintenant_!\" and stood leaning a moment--slightly\nlowered and inclined backward, her hands behind her and supporting\nher--on the _console_ before the mirror. She waited an instant, turning\nher eyes from one of her companions to the other as to take possession\nof them--an eminently conscious, intentional proceeding, which made\nSherringham ask himself what had become of her former terror and if that\nand her tears had all been a comedy: after which, abruptly straightening\nherself, she began to repeat a short French poem, an ingenious thing of\nthe day, that she had induced Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 to say over to her. She had\nlearned it, practised it, rehearsed it to her mother, and had now been\nchildishly eager to show what she could do with it. What she mainly did\nwas to reproduce with a crude fidelity, but in extraordinary detail, the\nintonations, the personal quavers and cadences of her model.\n\n\"How bad you make me seem to myself and if I were you how much better I\nshould say it!\" was Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's first criticism.\n\nMiriam allowed her, however, little time to develop it, for she broke\nout, at the shortest intervals, with the several other specimens of\nverse to which the old actress had handed her the key. They were all\nfine lyrics, of tender or ironic intention, by contemporary poets, but\ndepending for effect on taste and art, a mastery of the rare shade and\nthe right touch, in the interpreter. Miriam had gobbled them up, and she\ngave them forth in the same way as the first, with close, rude,\naudacious mimicry. There was a moment for Sherringham when it might have\nbeen feared their hostess would see in the performance a designed\nburlesque of her manner, her airs and graces, her celebrated simpers and\ngrimaces, so extravagant did it all cause these refinements to appear.\nWhen it was over the old woman said, \"Should you like now to hear how\n_you_ do?\" and, without waiting for an answer, phrased and trilled the\nlast of the pieces, from beginning to end, exactly as her visitor had\ndone, making this imitation of an imitation the drollest thing\nconceivable. If she had suffered from the sound of the girl's echo it\nwas a perfect revenge. Miriam had dropped on a sofa, exhausted, and she\nstared at first, flushed and wild; then she frankly gave way to\npleasure, to interest and large laughter. She said afterwards, to defend\nherself, that the verses in question, and indeed all those she had\nrecited, were of the most difficult sort: you had to do them; they\ndidn't do themselves--they were things in which the _gros moyens_ were\nof no avail.\n\n\"Ah my poor child, your means are all _gros moyens_; you appear to have\nno others,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 replied. \"You do what you can, but there are\npeople like that; it's the way they're made. They can never come nearer\nto fine truth, to the just indication; shades don't exist for them, they\ndon't see certain differences. It was to show you a difference that I\nrepeated that thing as you repeat it, as you represent my doing it. If\nyou're struck with the little the two ways have in common so much the\nbetter. But you seem to me terribly to _alourdir_ everything you touch.\"\n\nPeter read into this judgement a deep irritation--Miriam clearly set the\nteeth of her instructress on edge. She acted on her nerves, was made up\nof roughnesses and thicknesses unknown hitherto to her fine,\nfree-playing finger-tips. This exasperation, however, was a degree of\nflattery; it was neither indifference nor simple contempt; it\nacknowledged a mystifying reality in the _jeune Anglaise_ and even a\nshade of importance. The latter remarked, serenely enough, that the\nthings she wanted most to do were just those that were not for the\n_gros moyens_, the vulgar obvious dodges, the starts and shouts that any\none could think of and that the _gros public_ liked. She wanted to do\nwhat was most difficult, and to plunge into it from the first; and she\nexplained as if it were a discovery of her own that there were two kinds\nof scenes and speeches: those which acted themselves, of which the\ntreatment was plain, the only way, so that you had just to take it; and\nthose open to interpretation, with which you had to fight every step,\nrendering, arranging, doing the thing according to your idea. Some of\nthe most effective passages and the most celebrated and admired, like\nthe frenzy of Juliet with her potion, were of the former sort; but it\nwas the others she liked best.\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 received this revelation good-naturedly enough, considering\nits want of freshness, and only laughed at the young lady for looking so\nnobly patronising while she gave it. Her laughter appeared partly\naddressed to the good faith with which Miriam described herself as\npreponderantly interested in the subtler problems of her art.\nSherringham was charmed with the girl's pluck--if it was pluck and not\nmere density; the stout patience with which she submitted, for a\npurpose, to the old woman's rough usage. He wanted to take her away, to\ngive her a friendly caution, to advise her not to become a bore, not to\nexpose herself. But she held up her beautiful head as to show how little\nshe cared at present for any exposure, and that (it was half\ncoarseness--Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 was so far right--and half fortitude) she had\nno intention of coming away so long as; there was anything to be picked\nup. She sat and still she sat, challenging her hostess with every sort\nof question--some reasonable, some ingenious, some strangely futile and\nsome highly indiscreet; but all with the effect that, contrary to\nPeter's expectation, their distinguished friend warmed to the work of\nanswering and explaining, became interested, was content to keep her and\nto talk. Yes, she took her ease; she relieved herself, with the rare\ncynicism of the artist--all the crudity, the irony and intensity of a\ndiscussion of esoteric things--of personal mysteries, of methods and\nsecrets. It was the oddest hour our young man had ever spent, even in\nthe course of investigations which had often led him into the _cuisine_,\nthe distillery or back shop, of the admired profession. He got up\nseveral times to come away; then he remained, partly in order not to\nleave Miriam alone with her terrible initiatress, partly because he was\nboth amused and edified, and partly because Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 held him by the\nappeal of her sharp, confidential, old eyes, addressing her talk to\nhimself, with Miriam but a pretext and subject, a vile illustration. She\nundressed this young lady, as it were, from head to foot, turned her\ninside out, weighed and measured and sounded her: it was all, for\nSherringham, a new revelation of the point to which, in her profession\nand nation, an intelligence of the business, a ferocious analysis, had\nbeen carried and a special vocabulary developed. What struck him above\nall was the way she knew her grounds and reasons, so that everything was\nsharp and clear in her mind and lay under her hand. If she had rare\nperceptions she had traced them to their source; she could give an\naccount of what she did; she knew perfectly why, could explain it,\ndefend it, amplify it, fight for it: all of which was an intellectual\njoy to her, allowing her a chance to abound and insist and discriminate.\nThere was a kind of cruelty or at least of hardness in it all, to poor\nPeter's shy English sense, that sense which can never really reconcile\nitself to any question of method and form, and has extraneous sentiments\nto \"square,\" to pacify with compromises and superficialities, the\ngeneral plea for innocence in everything and often the flagrant proof of\nit. In theory there was nothing he valued more than just such a logical\npassion as Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's, but it was apt in fact, when he found himself\nat close quarters with it, to appear an ado about nothing.\n\nIf the old woman was hard it was not that many of her present\nconclusions about the _jeune Anglaise_ were not indulgent, but that she\nhad a vision of the great manner, of right and wrong, of the just and\nthe false, so high and religious that the individual was nothing before\nit--a prompt and easy sacrifice. It made our friend uncomfortable, as he\nhad been made uncomfortable by certain _feuilletons_, reviews of the\ntheatres in the Paris newspapers, which he was committed to thinking\nimportant but of which, when they were very good, he was rather ashamed.\nWhen they were very good, that is when they were very thorough, they\nwere very personal, as was inevitable in dealing with the most personal\nof the arts: they went into details; they put the dots on the _i_'s;\nthey discussed impartially the qualities of appearance, the physical\ngifts of the poor aspirant, finding them in some cases reprehensibly\ninadequate Peter could never rid himself of a dislike to these\npronouncements; in the case of the actresses especially they struck him\nas brutal and offensive--unmanly as launched by an ensconced,\nmoustachioed critic over a cigar. At the same time he was aware of the\ndilemma (he hated it; it made him blush still more) in which his\nobjection lodged him. If one was right in caring for the actor's art one\nought to have been interested in every honest judgement of it, which,\ngiven the peculiar conditions, would be useful in proportion as it\nshould be free. If the criticism that recognised frankly these\nconditions seemed an inferior or an unholy thing, then what was to be\nsaid for the art itself? What an implication, if the criticism was\ntolerable only so long as it was worthless--so long as it remained vague\nand timid! This was a knot Peter had never straightened out: he\ncontented himself with feeling that there was no reason a theatrical\ncritic shouldn't be a gentleman, at the same time that he often dubbed\nit an odious trade, which no gentleman could possibly follow. The best\nof the fraternity, so conspicuous in Paris, were those who didn't follow\nit--those who, while pretending to write about the stage, wrote about\neverything else.\n\nIt was as if Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, in pursuance of her inflamed sense that the\nart was everything and the individual nothing save as he happened to\nserve it, had said: \"Well, if she _will_ have it she shall; she shall\nknow what she's in for, what I went through, battered and broken in as\nwe all have been--all who are worthy, who have had the honour. She shall\nknow the real point of view.\" It was as if she were still beset with\nMrs. Rooth's twaddle and muddle, her hypocrisy, her idiotic\nscruples--something she felt all need to belabour, to trample on. Miriam\ntook it all as a bath, a baptism, with shuddering joy and gleeful\nsplashes; staring, wondering, sometimes blushing and failing to follow,\nbut not shrinking nor wounded; laughing, when convicted, at her own\nexpense and feeling evidently that this at last was the high cold air of\nart, an initiation, a discipline that nothing could undo. Sherringham\nsaid he would see her home--he wanted to talk to her and she must walk\naway with him. \"And it's understood then she may come back,\" he added to\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. \"It's _my_ affair of course. You'll take an interest in\nher for a month or two; she'll sit at your feet.\"\n\nThe old actress had an admirable shrug. \"Oh I'll knock her about--she\nseems stout enough!\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nWhen they had descended to the street Miriam mentioned to Peter that she\nwas thirsty, dying to drink something: upon which he asked her if she\nshould have an objection to going with him to a caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Objection? I've spent my life in caf\u00c3\u00a9s! They're warm in winter and you\nget your lamplight for nothing,\" she explained. \"Mamma and I have sat in\nthem for hours, many a time, with a _consommation_ of three sous, to\nsave fire and candles at home. We've lived in places we couldn't sit in,\nif you want to know--where there was only really room if we were in bed.\nMamma's money's sent out from England and sometimes it usedn't to come.\nOnce it didn't come for months--for months and months. I don't know how\nwe lived. There wasn't any to come; there wasn't any to get home. That\nisn't amusing when you're away in a foreign town without any friends.\nMamma used to borrow, but people wouldn't always lend. You needn't be\nafraid--she won't borrow of _you_. We're rather better now--something\nhas been done in England; I don't understand what. It's only fivepence a\nyear, but it has been settled; it comes regularly; it used to come only\nwhen we had written and begged and waited. But it made no\ndifference--mamma was always up to her ears in books. They served her\nfor food and drink. When she had nothing to eat she began a novel in\nten volumes--the old-fashioned ones; they lasted longest. She knows\nevery _cabinet de lecture_ in every town; the little, cheap, shabby\nones, I mean, in the back streets, where they have odd volumes and only\nask a sou and the books are so old that they smell like close rooms. She\ntakes them to the caf\u00c3\u00a9s--the little, cheap, shabby caf\u00c3\u00a9s too--and she\nreads there all the evening. That's very well for her, but it doesn't\nfeed me. I don't like a diet of dirty old novels. I sit there beside her\nwith nothing to do, not even a stocking to mend; she doesn't think that\n_comme il faut_. I don't know what the people take me for. However,\nwe've never been spoken to: any one can see mamma's a great lady. As for\nme I daresay I might be anything dreadful. If you're going to be an\nactress you must get used to being looked at. There were people in\nEngland who used to ask us to stay; some of them were our cousins--or\nmamma says they were. I've never been very clear about our cousins and I\ndon't think they were at all clear about us. Some of them are dead; the\nothers don't ask us any more. You should hear mamma on the subject of\nour visits in England. It's very convenient when your cousins are\ndead--that explains everything. Mamma has delightful phrases: 'My family\nis almost extinct.' Then your family may have been anything you like.\nOurs of course was magnificent. We did stay in a place once where there\nwas a deer-park, and also private theatricals. I played in them; I was\nonly fifteen years old, but I was very big and I thought I was in\nheaven. I'll go anywhere you like; you needn't be afraid; we've been in\nplaces! I've learned a great deal that way--sitting beside mamma and\nwatching people, their faces, their types, their movements. There's a\ngreat deal goes on in caf\u00c3\u00a9s: people come to them to talk things over,\ntheir private affairs, their complications; they have important\nmeetings. Oh I've observed scenes between men and women--very quiet,\nterribly quiet, but awful, pathetic, tragic! Once I saw a woman do\nsomething that I'm going to do some day when I'm great--if I can get the\nsituation. I'll tell you what it is sometime--I'll do it for you. Oh it\nis the book of life!\"\n\nSo Miriam discoursed, familiarly, disconnectedly, as the pair went their\nway down the Rue de Constantinople; and she continued to abound in\nanecdote and remark after they were seated face to face at a little\nmarble table in an establishment Peter had selected carefully and where\nhe had caused her, at her request, to be accommodated with _sirop\nd'orgeat_. \"I know what it will come to: Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 will want to keep\nme.\" This was one of the felicities she presently threw off.\n\n\"To keep you?\"\n\n\"For the French stage. She won't want to let you have me.\" She said\nthings of that kind, astounding in self-complacency, the assumption of\nquick success. She was in earnest, evidently prepared to work, but her\nimagination flew over preliminaries and probations, took no account of\nthe steps in the process, especially the first tiresome ones, the hard\ntest of honesty. He had done nothing for her as yet, given no\nsubstantial pledge of interest; yet she was already talking as if his\nprotection were assured and jealous. Certainly, however, she seemed to\nbelong to him very much indeed as she sat facing him at the Paris caf\u00c3\u00a9\nin her youth, her beauty, and her talkative confidence. This degree of\npossession was highly agreeable to him and he asked nothing more than to\nmake it last and go further. The impulse to draw her out was\nirresistible, to encourage her to show herself all the way; for if he\nwas really destined to take her career in hand he counted on some good\nequivalent--such for instance as that she should at least amuse him.\n\n\"It's very singular; I know nothing like it,\" he said--\"your equal\nmastery of two languages.\"\n\n\"Say of half-a-dozen,\" Miriam smiled.\n\n\"Oh I don't believe in the others to the same degree. I don't imagine\nthat, with all deference to your undeniable facility, you'd be judged\nfit to address a German or an Italian audience in their own tongue. But\nyou might a French, perfectly, and they're the most particular of all;\nfor their idiom's supersensitive and they're incapable of enduring the\n_baragouinage_ of foreigners, to which we listen with such complacency.\nIn fact your French is better than your English--it's more conventional;\nthere are little queernesses and impurities in your English, as if you\nhad lived abroad too much. Ah you must work that.\"\n\n\"I'll work it with _you_. I like the way you speak.\"\n\n\"You must speak beautifully; you must do something for the standard.\"\n\n\"For the standard?\"\n\n\"Well, there isn't any after all.\" Peter had a drop. \"It has gone to the\ndogs.\"\n\n\"Oh I'll bring it back. I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"No one knows, no one cares; the sense is gone--it isn't in the public,\"\nhe continued, ventilating a grievance he was rarely able to forget, the\nvision of which now suddenly made a mission full of possible sanctity\nfor his companion. \"Purity of speech, on our stage, doesn't exist. Every\none speaks as he likes and audiences never notice; it's the last thing\nthey think of. The place is given up to abominable dialects and\nindividual tricks, any vulgarity flourishes, and on top of it all the\nAmericans, with every conceivable crudity, come in to make confusion\nworse confounded. And when one laments it people stare; they don't know\nwhat one means.\"\n\n\"Do you mean the grand manner, certain pompous pronunciations, the style\nof the Kembles?\"\n\n\"I mean any style that _is_ a style, that's a system, a consistency, an\nart, that contributes a positive beauty to utterance. When I pay ten\nshillings to hear you speak I want you to know how, _que diable_! Say\nthat to people and they're mostly lost in stupor; only a few, the very\nintelligent, exclaim: 'Then you want actors to be affected?'\"\n\n\"And do you?\" asked Miriam full of interest.\n\n\"My poor child, what else under the sun should they be? Isn't their\nwhole art the affectation _par excellence_? The public won't stand that\nto-day, so one hears it said. If that be true it simply means that the\ntheatre, as I care for it, that is as a personal art, is at an end.\"\n\n\"Never, never, never!\" the girl cried in a voice that made a dozen\npeople look round.\n\n\"I sometimes think it--that the personal art is at an end and that\nhenceforth we shall have only the arts, capable no doubt of immense\ndevelopment in their way--indeed they've already reached it--of the\nstage-carpenter and the costumer. In London the drama is already\nsmothered in scenery; the interpretation scrambles off as it can. To get\nthe old personal impression, which used to be everything, you must go to\nthe poor countries, and most of all to Italy.\"\n\n\"Oh I've had it; it's very personal!\" said Miriam knowingly.\n\n\"You've seen the nudity of the stage, the poor, painted, tattered screen\nbehind, and before that void the histrionic figure, doing everything it\nknows how, in complete possession. The personality isn't our English\npersonality and it may not always carry us with it; but the direction's\nright, and it has the superiority that it's a human exhibition, not a\nmechanical one.\"\n\n\"I can act just like an Italian,\" Miriam eagerly proclaimed.\n\n\"I'd rather you acted like an Englishwoman if an Englishwoman would only\nact.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll show you!\"\n\n\"But you're not English,\" said Peter sociably, his arms on the table.\n\n\"I beg your pardon. You should hear mamma about our 'race.'\"\n\n\"You're a Jewess--I'm sure of that,\" he went on.\n\nShe jumped at this, as he was destined to see later she would ever jump\nat anything that might make her more interesting or striking; even at\nthings that grotesquely contradicted or excluded each other. \"That's\nalways possible if one's clever. I'm very willing, because I want to be\nthe English Rachel.\"\n\n\"Then you must leave Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 as soon as you've got from her what\nshe can give.\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't fear; you shan't lose me,\" the girl replied with\ncharming gross fatuity. \"My name's Jewish,\" she went on, \"but it was\nthat of my grandmother, my father's mother. She was a baroness in\nGermany. That is, she was the daughter of a baron.\"\n\nPeter accepted this statement with reservations, but he replied: \"Put\nall that together and it makes you very sufficiently of Rachel's tribe.\"\n\n\"I don't care if I'm of her tribe artistically. I'm of the family of the\nartists--_je me fiche_ of any other! I'm in the same style as that\nwoman--I know it.\"\n\n\"You speak as if you had seen her,\" he said, amused at the way she\ntalked of \"that woman.\" \"Oh I know all about her--I know all about all\nthe great actors. But that won't prevent me from speaking divine\nEnglish.\"\n\n\"You must learn lots of verse; you must repeat it to me,\" Sherringham\nwent on. \"You must break yourself in till you can say anything. You must\nlearn passages of Milton, passages of Wordsworth.\"\n\n\"Did _they_ write plays?\"\n\n\"Oh it isn't only a matter of plays! You can't speak a part properly\ntill you can speak everything else, anything that comes up, especially\nin proportion as it's difficult. That gives you authority.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'm going in for authority. There's more chance in English,\"\nthe girl added in the next breath. \"There are not so many others--the\nterrible competition. There are so many here--not that I'm afraid,\" she\nchattered on. \"But we've got America and they haven't. America's a great\nplace.\"\n\n\"You talk like a theatrical agent. They're lucky not to have it as we\nhave it. Some of them do go, and it ruins them.\"\n\n\"Why, it fills their pockets!\" Miriam cried.\n\n\"Yes, but see what they pay. It's the death of an actor to play to big\npopulations that don't understand his language. It's nothing then but\nthe _gros moyens_; all his delicacy perishes. However, they'll\nunderstand _you_.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall be too affected,\" she said.\n\n\"You won't be more so than Garrick or Mrs. Siddons or John Kemble or\nEdmund Kean. They understood Edmund Kean. All reflexion is affectation,\nand all acting's reflexion.\"\n\n\"I don't know--mine's instinct,\" Miriam contended.\n\n\"My dear young lady, you talk of 'yours'; but don't be offended if I\ntell you that yours doesn't exist. Some day it will--if the thing comes\noff. Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's does, because she has reflected. The talent, the\ndesire, the energy are an instinct; but by the time these things become\na performance they're an instinct put in its place.\"\n\n\"Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's very philosophic. I shall never be like her.\"\n\n\"Of course you won't--you'll be original. But you'll have your own\nideas.\"\n\n\"I daresay I shall have a good many of yours\"--and she smiled at him\nacross the table.\n\nThey sat a moment looking at each other. \"Don't go in for coquetry,\"\nPeter then said. \"It's a waste of time.\"\n\n\"Well, that's civil!\" the girl cried.\n\n\"Oh I don't mean for me, I mean for yourself I want you to be such good\nfaith. I'm bound to give you stiff advice. You don't strike me as\nflirtatious and that sort of thing, and it's much in your favour.\"\n\n\"In my favour?\"\n\n\"It does save time.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it saves too much. Don't you think the artist ought to have\npassions?\"\n\nPeter had a pause; he thought an examination of this issue premature.\n\"Flirtations are not passions,\" he replied. \"No, you're simple--at least\nI suspect you are; for of course with a woman one would be clever to\nknow.\"\n\nShe asked why he pronounced her simple, but he judged it best and more\nconsonant with fair play to defer even a treatment of this branch of the\nquestion; so that to change the subject he said: \"Be sure you don't\nbetray me to your friend Mr. Nash.\"\n\n\"Betray you? Do you mean about your recommending affectation?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no; he recommends it himself. That is, he practises it, and on\na scale!\"\n\n\"But he makes one hate it.\"\n\n\"He proves what I mean,\" said Sherringham: \"that the great comedian's\nthe one who raises it to a science. If we paid ten shillings to listen\nto Mr. Nash we should think him very fine. But we want to know what it's\nsupposed to be.\"\n\n\"It's too odious, the way he talks about us!\" Miriam cried assentingly.\n\n\"About 'us'?\"\n\n\"Us poor actors.\"\n\n\"It's the competition he dislikes,\" Peter laughed.\n\n\"However, he's very good-natured; he lent mamma thirty pounds,\" the girl\nadded honestly. Our young man, at this information, was not able to\nrepress a certain small twinge noted by his companion and of which she\nappeared to mistake the meaning. \"Of course he'll get it back,\" she went\non while he looked at her in silence a little. Fortune had not supplied\nhim profusely with money, but his emotion was caused by no foresight of\nhis probably having also to put his hand in his pocket for Mrs. Rooth.\nIt was simply the instinctive recoil of a fastidious nature from the\nidea of familiar intimacy with people who lived from hand to mouth,\ntogether with a sense that this intimacy would have to be defined if it\nwas to go much further. He would wish to know what it was supposed to\nbe, like Nash's histrionics. Miriam after a moment mistook his thought\nstill more completely, and in doing so flashed a portent of the way it\nwas in her to strike from time to time a note exasperatingly, almost\nconsciously vulgar, which one would hate for the reason, along with\nothers, that by that time one would be in love with her. \"Well then, he\nwon't--if you don't believe it!\" she easily laughed. He was saying to\nhimself that the only possible form was that they should borrow only\nfrom him. \"You're a funny man. I make you blush,\" she persisted.\n\n\"I must reply with the _tu quoque_, though I've not that effect on you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You're an extraordinary young lady.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm horrid. Well, I daresay I am. But I'm better when you know\nme.\"\n\nHe made no direct rejoinder to this, but after a moment went on: \"Your\nmother must repay that money. I'll give it her.\"\n\n\"You had better give it _him_!\" cried Miriam. \"If once mamma has it--!\"\nShe interrupted herself and with another and a softer tone, one of her\nprofessional transitions, remarked: \"I suppose you've never known any\none that was poor.\"\n\n\"I'm poor myself. That is, I'm very far from rich. But why receive\nfavours--?\" And here he in turn checked himself with the sense that he\nwas indeed taking a great deal on his back if he pretended already--he\nhad not seen the pair three times--to regulate their intercourse with\nthe rest of the world. But the girl instantly carried out his thought\nand more than his thought.\n\n\"Favours from Mr. Nash? Oh he doesn't count!\"\n\nThe way she dropped these words--they would have been admirable on the\nstage--made him reply with prompt ease: \"What I meant just now was that\nyou're not to tell him, after all my swagger, that I consider that you\nand I are really required to save our theatre.\"\n\n\"Oh if we can save it he shall know it!\" She added that she must\npositively get home; her mother would be in a state: she had really\nscarce ever been out alone. He mightn't think it, but so it was. Her\nmother's ideas, those awfully proper ones, were not all talk. She _did_\nkeep her! Sherringham accepted this--he had an adequate and indeed an\nanalytic vision of Mrs. Rooth's conservatism; but he observed at the\nsame time that his companion made no motion to rise. He made none\neither; he only said:\n\n\"We're very frivolous, the way we chatter. What you want to do to get\nyour foot in the stirrup is supremely difficult. There's everything to\novercome. You've neither an engagement nor the prospect of an\nengagement.\"\n\n\"Oh you'll get me one!\" Her manner presented this as so certain that it\nwasn't worth dilating on; so instead of dilating she inquired abruptly a\nsecond time: \"Why do you think I'm so simple?\"\n\n\"I don't then. Didn't I tell you just now that you were extraordinary?\nThat's the term, moreover, that you applied to yourself when you came to\nsee me--when you said a girl had to be a kind of monster to wish to go\non the stage. It remains the right term and your simplicity doesn't\nmitigate it. What's rare in you is that you have--as I suspect at\nleast--no nature of your own.\" Miriam listened to this as if preparing\nto argue with it or not, only as it should strike her as a sufficiently\nbrave picture; but as yet, naturally, she failed to understand. \"You're\nalways at concert pitch or on your horse; there are no intervals. It's\nthe absence of intervals, of a _fond_ or background, that I don't\ncomprehend. You're an embroidery without a canvas.\"\n\n\"Yes--perhaps,\" the girl replied, her head on one side as if she were\nlooking at the pattern of this rarity. \"But I'm very honest.\"\n\n\"You can't be everything, both a consummate actress and a flower of the\nfield. You've got to choose.\"\n\nShe looked at him a moment. \"I'm glad you think I'm so wonderful.\"\n\n\"Your feigning may be honest in the sense that your only feeling is your\nfeigned one,\" Peter pursued. \"That's what I mean by the absence of a\nground or of intervals. It's a kind of thing that's a labyrinth!\"\n\n\"I know what I am,\" she said sententiously.\n\nBut her companion continued, following his own train. \"Were you really\nso frightened the first day you went to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's?\"\n\nShe stared, then with a flush threw back her head. \"Do you think I was\npretending?\"\n\n\"I think you always are. However, your vanity--if you had any!--would be\nnatural.\"\n\n\"I've plenty of that. I'm not a bit ashamed to own it.\"\n\n\"You'd be capable of trying to 'do' the human peacock. But excuse the\naudacity and the crudity of my speculations--it only proves my interest.\nWhat is it that you know you are?\"\n\n\"Why, an artist. Isn't that a canvas?\"\n\n\"Yes, an intellectual, but not a moral.\"\n\n\"Ah it's everything! And I'm a good girl too--won't that do?\"\n\n\"It remains to be seen,\" Sherringham laughed. \"A creature who's\nabsolutely _all_ an artist--I'm curious to see that.\"\n\n\"Surely it has been seen--in lots of painters, lots of musicians.\"\n\n\"Yes, but those arts are not personal like yours. I mean not so much so.\nThere's something left for--what shall I call it?--for character.\"\n\nShe stared again with her tragic light. \"And do you think I haven't a\ncharacter?\" As he hesitated she pushed back her chair, rising rapidly.\n\nHe looked up at her an instant--she seemed so \"plastic\"; and then rising\ntoo answered: \"Delightful being, you've a hundred!\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe summer arrived and the dense air of the Paris theatres became in\nfact a still more complicated mixture; yet the occasions were not few on\nwhich Sherringham, having placed a box near the stage (most often a\nstuffy, dusky _baignoire_) at the disposal of Mrs. Rooth and her\ndaughter, found time just to look in, as he said, to spend a part of the\nevening with them and point the moral of the performance. The pieces,\nthe successes of the winter, had entered the automatic phase: they went\non by the force of the impetus acquired, deriving little fresh life from\nthe interpretation, and in ordinary conditions their strong points, as\nrendered by the actors, would have been as wearisome to this student as\nan importunate repetition of a good story. But it was not long before he\nbecame aware that the conditions couldn't be taken for ordinary. There\nwas a new infusion in his consciousness--an element in his life which\naltered the relations of things. He was not easy till he had found the\nright name for it--a name the more satisfactory that it was simple,\ncomprehensive, and plausible. A new \"distraction,\" in the French sense,\nwas what he flattered himself he had discovered; he could recognise that\nas freely as possible without being obliged to classify the agreeable\nresource as a new entanglement. He was neither too much nor too little\ndiverted; he had all his usual attention to give to his work: he had\nonly an employment for his odd hours which, without being imperative,\nhad over various others the advantage of a certain continuity.\n\nAnd yet, I hasten to add, he was not so well pleased with it but that\namong his friends he maintained for the present a rich reserve about it.\nHe had no irresistible impulse to describe generally how he had\ndisinterred a strange, handsome girl whom he was bringing up for the\ntheatre. She had been seen by several of his associates at his rooms,\nbut was not soon to be seen there again. His reserve might by the\nill-natured have been termed dissimulation, inasmuch as when asked by\nthe ladies of the embassy what had become of the young person who had\namused them that day so cleverly he gave it out that her whereabouts was\nuncertain and her destiny probably obscure; he let it be supposed in a\nword that his benevolence had scarcely survived an accidental, a\ncharitable occasion. As he went about his customary business, and\nperhaps even put a little more conscience into the transaction of it,\nthere was nothing to suggest to others that he was engaged in a private\nspeculation of an absorbing kind. It was perhaps his weakness that he\ncarried the apprehension of ridicule too far; but his excuse may have\ndwelt in his holding it unpardonable for a man publicly enrolled in the\nservice of his country to be markedly ridiculous. It was of course not\nout of all order that such functionaries, their private situation\npermitting, should enjoy a personal acquaintance with stars of the\ndramatic, the lyric, or even the choregraphic stage: high diplomatists\nhad indeed not rarely, and not invisibly, cultivated this privilege\nwithout its proving the sepulchre of their reputation. That a gentleman\nwho was not a fool should consent a little to become one for the sake of\na celebrated actress or singer--_cela s'\u00c3\u00a9tait vu_, though it was not\nperhaps to be recommended. It was not a tendency that was encouraged at\nheadquarters, where even the most rising young men were not incited to\nbelieve they could never fall. Still, it might pass if kept in its\nplace; and there were ancient worthies yet in the profession--though not\nthose whom the tradition had helped to go furthest--who held that\nsomething of the sort was a graceful ornament of the diplomatic\ncharacter. Sherringham was aware he was very \"rising\"; but Miriam Rooth\nwas not yet a celebrated actress. She was only a young artist in\nconscientious process of formation and encumbered with a mother still\nmore conscientious than herself. She was a _jeune Anglaise_--a \"lady\"\nwithal--very earnest about artistic, about remunerative problems. He had\naccepted the office of a formative influence; and that was precisely\nwhat might provoke derision. He was a ministering angel--his patience\nand good nature really entitled him to the epithet and his rewards would\ndoubtless some day define themselves; but meanwhile other promotions\nwere in precarious prospect, for the failure of which these would not\neven in their abundance, be a compensation. He kept an unembarrassed eye\non Downing Street, and while it may frankly be said for him that he was\nneither a pedant nor a prig he remembered that the last impression he\nought to wish to produce there was that of a futile estheticism.\n\nHe felt the case sufficiently important, however, when he sat behind\nMiriam at the play and looked over her shoulder at the stage; her\nobservation being so keen and her comments so unexpected in their\nvivacity that his curiosity was refreshed and his attention stretched\nbeyond its wont. If the exhibition before the footlights had now lost\nmuch of its annual brilliancy the fashion in which she followed it was\nperhaps exhibition enough. The attendance of the little party was,\nmoreover, in most cases at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais; and it has been\nsufficiently indicated that our friend, though the child of a sceptical\nage and the votary of a cynical science, was still candid enough to take\nthe serious, the religious view of that establishment the view of M.\nSarcey and of the unregenerate provincial mind. \"In the trade I follow\nwe see things too much in the hard light of reason, of calculation,\" he\nonce remarked to his young charge; \"but it's good for the mind to keep\nup a superstition or two; it leaves a margin--like having a second horse\nto your brougham for night-work. The arts, the amusements, the esthetic\npart of life, are night-work, if I may say so without suggesting that\nthey're illicit. At any rate you want your second horse--your\nsuperstition that stays at home when the sun's high--to go your rounds\nwith. The Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais is my second horse.\"\n\nMiriam's appetite for this interest showed him vividly enough how rarely\nin the past it had been within her reach; and she pleased him at first\nby liking everything, seeing almost no differences and taking her deep\ndraught undiluted. She leaned on the edge of the box with bright\nvoracity; tasting to the core, yet relishing the surface, watching each\nmovement of each actor, attending to the way each thing was said or done\nas if it were the most important thing, and emitting from time to time\napplausive or restrictive sounds. It was a charming show of the critical\nspirit in ecstasy. Sherringham had his wonder about it, as a part of the\nattraction exerted by this young lady was that she caused him to have\nhis wonder about everything she did. Was it in fact a conscious show, a\nline taken for effect, so that at the Com\u00c3\u00a9die her own display should be\nthe most successful of all? That question danced attendance on the\nliberal intercourse of these young people and fortunately as yet did\nlittle to embitter Sherringham's share of it. His general sense that she\nwas personating had its especial moments of suspense and perplexity, and\nadded variety and even occasionally a degree of excitement to their\ncommerce. At the theatre, for the most part, she was really flushed with\neagerness; and with the spectators who turned an admiring eye into the\ndim compartment of which she pervaded the front she might have passed\nfor a romantic or at least an insatiable young woman from the country.\n\nMrs. Rooth took a more general view, but attended immensely to the\nstory, in respect to which she manifested a patient good faith which had\nits surprises and its comicalities for her daughter's patron. She found\nno play too tedious, no _entr'acte_ too long, no _baignoire_ too hot, no\ntissue of incidents too complicated, no situation too unnatural and no\nsentiments too sublime. She gave him the measure of her power to sit and\nsit--an accomplishment to which she owed in the struggle for existence\nsuch superiority as she might be said to have achieved. She could\nout-sit everybody and everything; looking as if she had acquired the\npractice in repeated years of small frugality combined with large\nleisure--periods when she had nothing but hours and days and years to\nspend and had learned to calculate in any situation how long she could\nstay. \"Staying\" was so often a saving--a saving of candles, of fire and\neven (as it sometimes implied a scheme for stray refection) of food.\nPeter saw soon enough how bravely her shreds and patches of gentility\nand equanimity hung together, with the aid of whatever casual pins and\nother makeshifts, and if he had been addicted to studying the human\nmixture in its different combinations would have found in her an\ninteresting compendium of some of the infatuations that survive a hard\ndiscipline. He made indeed without difficulty the reflexion that her\nlife might have taught her something of the real, at the same time that\nhe could scarce help thinking it clever of her to have so persistently\ndeclined the lesson. She appeared to have put it by with a deprecating,\nladylike smile--a plea of being too soft and bland for experience.\n\nShe took the refined, sentimental, tender view of the universe,\nbeginning with her own history and feelings. She believed in everything\nhigh and pure, disinterested and orthodox, and even at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la\nGaronne was unconscious of the shabby or the ugly side of the world. She\nnever despaired: otherwise what would have been the use of being a\nNeville-Nugent? Only not to have been one--that would have been\ndiscouraging. She delighted in novels, poems, perversions,\nmisrepresentations, and evasions, and had a capacity for smooth,\nsuperfluous falsification which made our young man think her sometimes\nan amusing and sometimes a tedious inventor. But she wasn't dangerous\neven if you believed her; she wasn't even a warning if you didn't. It\nwas harsh to call her a hypocrite, since you never could have resolved\nher back into her character, there being no reverse at all to her\nblazonry. She built in the air and was not less amiable than she\npretended, only that was a pretension too. She moved altogether in a\nworld of elegant fable and fancy, and Sherringham had to live there with\nher for Miriam's sake, live there in sociable, vulgar assent and despite\nhis feeling it rather a low neighbourhood. He was at a loss how to take\nwhat she said--she talked sweetly and discursively of so many\nthings--till he simply noted that he could only take it always for\nuntrue. When Miriam laughed at her he was rather disagreeably affected:\n\"dear mamma's fine stories\" was a sufficiently cynical reference to the\nimmemorial infirmity of a parent. But when the girl backed her up, as\nhe phrased it to himself, he liked that even less.\n\nMrs. Rooth was very fond of a moral and had never lost her taste for\nedification. She delighted in a beautiful character and was gratified to\nfind so many more than she had supposed represented in the contemporary\nFrench drama. She never failed to direct Miriam's attention to them and\nto remind her that there is nothing in life so grand as a sublime act,\nabove all when sublimely explained. Peter made much of the difference\nbetween the mother and the daughter, thinking it singularly marked--the\nway one took everything for the sense, or behaved as if she did, caring\nonly for the plot and the romance, the triumph or defeat of virtue and\nthe moral comfort of it all, and the way the other was alive but to the\nmanner and the art of it, the intensity of truth to appearances. Mrs.\nRooth abounded in impressive evocations, and yet he saw no link between\nher facile genius and that of which Miriam gave symptoms. The poor lady\nnever could have been accused of successful deceit, whereas the triumph\nof fraud was exactly what her clever child achieved. She made even the\ntrue seem fictive, while Miriam's effort was to make the fictive true.\nSherringham thought it an odd unpromising stock (that of the\nNeville-Nugents) for a dramatic talent to have sprung from, till he\nreflected that the evolution was after all natural: the figurative\nimpulse in the mother had become conscious, and therefore higher,\nthrough finding an aim, which was beauty, in the daughter. Likely enough\nthe Hebraic Mr. Rooth, with his love of old pots and Christian\naltar-cloths, had supplied in the girl's composition the esthetic\nelement, the sense of colour and form. In their visits to the theatre\nthere was nothing Mrs. Rooth more insisted on than the unprofitableness\nof deceit, as shown by the most distinguished authors--the folly and\ndegradation, the corrosive effect on the spirit, of tortuous ways. Their\ncompanion soon gave up the futile task of piecing together her\nincongruous references to her early life and her family in England. He\nrenounced even the doctrine that there was a residuum of truth in her\nclaim of great relationships, since, existent or not, he cared equally\nlittle for her ramifications. The principle of this indifference was at\nbottom a certain desire to disconnect and isolate Miriam; for it was\ndisagreeable not to be independent in dealing with her, and he could be\nfully so only if she herself were.\n\nThe early weeks of that summer--they went on indeed into August--were\ndestined to establish themselves in his memory as a season of pleasant\nthings. The ambassador went away and Peter had to wait for his own\nholiday, which he did during the hot days contentedly enough--waited in\nspacious halls and a vast, dim, bird-haunted garden. The official world\nand most other worlds withdrew from Paris, and the Place de la Concorde,\na larger, whiter desert than ever, became by a reversal of custom\nexplorable with safety. The Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es were dusty and rural, with\nlittle creaking booths and exhibitions that made a noise like\ngrasshoppers; the Arc de Triomphe threw its cool, thick shadow for a\nmile; the Palais de l'Industrie glittered in the light of the long days;\nthe cabmen, in their red waistcoats, dozed inside their boxes, while\nSherringham permitted himself a \"pot\" hat and rarely met a friend. Thus\nwas Miriam as islanded as the chained Andromeda, and thus was it\npossible to deal with her, even Perseus-like, in deep detachment. The\ntheatres on the boulevard closed for the most part, but the great temple\nof the Rue de Richelieu, with an esthetic responsibility, continued\nimperturbably to dispense examples of style. Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 was going to\nVichy, but had not yet taken flight, which was a great advantage for\nMiriam, who could now solicit her attention with the consciousness that\nshe had no engagements _en ville_.\n\n\"I make her listen to me--I make her tell me,\" said the ardent girl, who\nwas always climbing the slope of the Rue de Constantinople on the shady\nside, where of July mornings a smell of violets came from the moist\nflower-stands of fat, white-capped _bouqueti\u00c3\u00a8res_ in the angles of\ndoorways. Miriam liked the Paris of the summer mornings, the clever\nfreshness of all the little trades and the open-air life, the cries, the\ntalk from door to door, which reminded her of the south, where, in the\nmultiplicity of her habitations, she had lived; and most of all, the\ngreat amusement, or nearly, of her walk, the enviable baskets of the\nlaundress piled up with frilled and fluted whiteness--the certain\nluxury, she felt while she passed with quick prevision, of her own dawn\nof glory. The greatest amusement perhaps was to recognise the pretty\nsentiment of earliness, the particular congruity with the hour, in the\nstudied, selected dress of the little tripping women who were taking the\nday, for important advantages, while it was tender. At any rate she\nmostly brought with her from her passage through the town good humour\nenough--with the penny bunch of violets she always stuck in the front of\nher dress--for whatever awaited her at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's. She declared to\nher friend that her dear mistress was terribly severe, giving her the\nmost difficult, the most exhausting exercises, showing a kind of rage\nfor breaking her in.\n\n\"So much the better,\" Sherringham duly answered; but he asked no\nquestions and was glad to let the preceptress and the pupil fight it out\ntogether. He wanted for the moment to know as little as possible about\ntheir ways together: he had been over-dosed with that knowledge while\nattending at their second interview. He would send Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 her\nmoney--she was really most obliging--and in the meantime was certain\nMiriam could take care of herself. Sometimes he remarked to her that she\nneedn't always talk \"shop\" to him: there were times when he was mortally\ntired of shop--of hers. Moreover, he frankly admitted that he was tired\nof his own, so that the restriction was not brutal. When she replied,\nstaring, \"Why, I thought you considered it as such a beautiful,\ninteresting art!\" he had no rejoinder more philosophic than \"Well, I do;\nbut there are moments when I'm quite sick of it all the same,\" At other\ntimes he put it: \"Oh yes, the results, the finished thing, the dish\nperfectly seasoned and served: not the mess of preparation--at least not\nalways--not the experiments that spoil the material.\"\n\n\"I supposed you to feel just these questions of study, of the artistic\neducation, as you've called it to me, so fascinating,\" the girl\npersisted. She was sometimes so flatly lucid.\n\n\"Well, after all, I'm not an actor myself,\" he could but impatiently\nsigh.\n\n\"You might be one if you were serious,\" she would imperturbably say. To\nthis her friend replied that Mr. Gabriel Nash ought to hear this; which\nmade her promise with a certain grimness that she would settle _him_ and\nhis theories some day. Not to seem too inconsistent--for it was cruel to\nbewilder her when he had taken her up to enlighten--Peter repeated over\nthat for a man like himself the interest of the whole thing depended on\nits being considered in a large, liberal way and with an intelligence\nthat lifted it out of the question of the little tricks of the trade,\ngave it beauty and elevation. But she hereupon let him know that Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9 held there were no _little_ tricks, that everything had its\nimportance as a means to a great end, and that if you were not willing\nto try to _approfondir_ the reason why, in a given situation, you should\nscratch your nose with your left hand rather than with your right, you\nwere not worthy to tread any stage that respected itself.\n\n\"That's very well, but if I must go into details read me a little\nShelley,\" groaned the young man in the spirit of a high _raffin\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\n\"You're worse than Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9; you don't know what to invent; between\nyou you'll kill me!\" the girl declared. \"I think there's a secret league\nbetween you to spoil my voice, or at least to weaken my _souffle_,\nbefore I get it. But _\u00c3\u00a0 la guerre comme \u00c3\u00a0 la guerre_! How can I read\nShelley, however, when I don't understand him?\"\n\n\"That's just what I want to make you do. It's a part of your general\ntraining. You may do without that of course--without culture and taste\nand perception; but in that case you'll be nothing but a vulgar\n_cabotine_, and nothing will be of any consequence.\" He had a theory\nthat the great lyric poets--he induced her to read, and recite as well,\nlong passages of Wordsworth and Swinburne--would teach her many of the\nsecrets of the large utterance, the mysteries of rhythm, the\ncommunicableness of style, the latent music of the language and the art\nof \"composing\" copious speeches and of retaining her stores of free\nbreath. He held in perfect sincerity that there was a general sense of\nthings, things of the mind, which would be of the highest importance to\nher and to which it was by good fortune just in his power to contribute.\nShe would do better in proportion as she had more knowledge--even\nknowledge that might superficially show but a remote connexion with her\nbusiness. The actor's talent was essentially a gift, a thing by itself,\nimplanted, instinctive, accidental, equally unconnected with intellect\nand with virtue--Sherringham was completely of that opinion; but it\nstruck him as no _b\u00c3\u00aatise_ to believe at the same time that\nintellect--leaving virtue for the moment out of the question--might be\nbrought into fruitful relation with it. It would be a bigger thing if a\nbetter mind were projected upon it--projected without sacrificing the\nmind. So he lent his young friend books she never read--she was on\nalmost irreconcilable terms with the printed page save for spouting\nit--and in the long summer days, when he had leisure, took her to the\nLouvre to admire the great works of painting and sculpture. Here, as on\nall occasions, he was struck with the queer jumble of her taste, her\nmixture of intelligence and puerility. He saw she never read what he\ngave her, though she sometimes would shamelessly have liked him to\nsuppose so; but in the presence of famous pictures and statues she had\nremarkable flashes of perception. She felt these things, she liked them,\nthough it was always because she had an idea she could use them. The\nbelief was often presumptuous, but it showed what an eye she had to her\nbusiness. \"I could look just like that if I tried.\" \"That's the dress I\nmean to wear when I do Portia.\" Such were the observations apt to drop\nfrom her under the suggestion of antique marbles or when she stood\nbefore a Titian or a Bronzino.\n\nWhen she uttered them, and many others besides, the effect was sometimes\nirritating to her adviser, who had to bethink himself a little that she\nwas no more egotistical than the histrionic conscience required. He\nwondered if there were necessarily something vulgar in the histrionic\nconscience--something condemned only to feel the tricky, personal\nquestion. Wasn't it better to be perfectly stupid than to have only one\neye open and wear for ever in the great face of the world the expression\nof a knowing wink? At the theatre, on the numerous July evenings when\nthe Com\u00c3\u00a9die Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise exhibited the repertory by the aid of exponents\ndetermined the more sparse and provincial audience should have a taste\nof the tradition, her appreciation was tremendously technical and showed\nit was not for nothing she was now in and out of Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's\ninnermost counsels. But there were moments when even her very acuteness\nseemed to him to drag the matter down, to see it in a small and\nsuperficial sense. What he flattered himself he was trying to do for\nher--and through her for the stage of his time, since she was the\ninstrument, and incontestably a fine one, that had come to his hand--was\nprecisely to lift it up, make it rare, keep it in the region of\ndistinction and breadth. However, she was doubtless right and he was\nwrong, he eventually reasoned: you could afford to be vague only if you\nhadn't a responsibility. He had fine ideas, but she was to act them out,\nthat is to apply them, and not he; and application was of necessity a\nvulgarisation, a smaller thing than theory. If she should some day put\nforth the great art it wasn't purely fanciful to forecast for her, the\nmatter would doubtless be by that fact sufficiently transfigured and it\nwouldn't signify that some of the onward steps should have been lame.\n\nThis was clear to him on several occasions when she recited or motioned\nor even merely looked something for him better than usual; then she\nquite carried him away, making him wish to ask no more questions, but\nonly let her disembroil herself in her own strong fashion. In these\nhours she gave him forcibly if fitfully that impression of beauty which\nwas to be her justification. It was too soon for any general estimate of\nher progress; Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 had at last given her a fine understanding as\nwell as a sore, personal, an almost physical, sense of how bad she was.\nShe had therefore begun on a new basis, had returned to the alphabet and\nthe drill. It was a phase of awkwardness, the splashing of a young\nswimmer, but buoyancy would certainly come out of it. For the present\nthere was mainly no great alteration of the fact that when she did\nthings according to her own idea they were not, as yet and seriously\njudged, worth the devil, as Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 said, and when she did them\naccording to that of her instructress were too apt to be a gross parody\nof that lady's intention. None the less she gave glimpses, and her\nglimpses made him feel not only that she was not a fool--this was small\nrelief--but that he himself was not.\n\nHe made her stick to her English and read Shakespeare aloud to him. Mrs.\nRooth had recognised the importance of apartments in which they should\nbe able to receive so beneficent a visitor, and was now mistress of a\nsmall salon with a balcony and a rickety flower-stand--to say nothing of\na view of many roofs and chimneys--a very uneven waxed floor, an empire\nclock, an _armoire \u00c3\u00a0 glace_, highly convenient for Miriam's posturings,\nand several cupboard doors covered over, allowing for treacherous gaps,\nwith the faded magenta paper of the wall. The thing had been easily\ndone, for Sherringham had said: \"Oh we must have a sitting-room for our\nstudies, you know, and I'll settle it with the landlady,\" Mrs. Rooth had\nliked his \"we\"--indeed she liked everything about him--and he saw in\nthis way that she heaved with no violence under pecuniary obligations so\nlong as they were distinctly understood to be temporary. That he should\nhave his money back with interest as soon as Miriam was launched was a\ncomfort so deeply implied that it only added to intimacy. The window\nstood open on the little balcony, and when the sun had left it Peter and\nMiriam could linger there, leaning on the rail and talking above the\ngreat hum of Paris, with nothing but the neighbouring tiles and tall\ntubes to take account of. Mrs. Rooth, in limp garments much ungirdled,\nwas on the sofa with a novel, making good her frequent assertion that\nshe could put up with any life that would yield her these two\nconveniences. There were romantic works Peter had never read and as to\nwhich he had vaguely wondered to what class they were addressed--the\nearlier productions of M. Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Sue, the once-fashionable compositions\nof Madame Sophie Gay--with which Mrs. Rooth was familiar and which she\nwas ready to enjoy once more if she could get nothing fresher. She had\nalways a greasy volume tucked under her while her nose was bent upon the\npages in hand. She scarcely looked up even when Miriam lifted her voice\nto show their benefactor what she could do. These tragic or pathetic\nnotes all went out of the window and mingled with the undecipherable\nconcert of Paris, so that no neighbour was disturbed by them. The girl\nshrieked and wailed when the occasion required it, and Mrs. Rooth only\nturned her page, showing in this way a great esthetic as well as a great\npersonal trust.\n\nShe rather annoyed their visitor by the serenity of her confidence--for\na reason he fully understood only later--save when Miriam caught an\neffect or a tone so well that she made him in the pleasure of it forget\nher parent's contiguity. He continued to object to the girl's English,\nwith its foreign patches that might pass in prose but were offensive in\nthe recitation of verse, and he wanted to know why she couldn't speak\nlike her mother. He had justly to acknowledge the charm of Mrs. Rooth's\nvoice and tone, which gave a richness even to the foolish things she\nsaid. They were of an excellent insular tradition, full both of natural\nand of cultivated sweetness, and they puzzled him when other indications\nseemed to betray her--to refer her to more common air. They were like\nthe reverberation of some far-off tutored circle.\n\nThe connexion between the development of Miriam's genius and the\nnecessity of an occasional excursion to the country--the charming\ncountry that lies in so many directions beyond the Parisian\n_banlieue_--would not have been immediately apparent to a superficial\nobserver; but a day, and then another, at Versailles, a day at\nFontainebleau and a trip, particularly harmonious and happy, to\nRambouillet, took their places in our young man's plan as a part of the\nindirect but contributive culture, an agency in the formation of taste.\nIntimations of the grand manner for instance would proceed in abundance\nfrom the symmetrical palace and gardens of Louis XIV. Peter \"adored\"\nVersailles and wandered there more than once with the ladies of the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne. They chose quiet hours, when the fountains were\ndry; and Mrs. Rooth took an armful of novels and sat on a bench in the\npark, flanked by clipped hedges and old statues, while her young\ncompanions strolled away, walked to the Trianon, explored the long,\nstraight vistas of the woods. Rambouillet was vague and vivid and sweet;\nthey felt that they found a hundred wise voices there; and indeed there\nwas an old white chateau which contained nothing but ghostly sounds.\nThey found at any rate a long luncheon, and in the landscape the very\nspirit of silvery summer and of the French pictorial brush.\n\nI have said that in these days Sherringham wondered about many things,\nand by the time his leave of absence came this practice had produced a\nparticular speculation. He was surprised that he shouldn't be in love\nwith Miriam Rooth and considered at moments of leisure the causes of his\nexemption. He had felt from the first that she was a \"nature,\" and each\ntime she met his eyes it seemed to come to him straighter that her\nbeauty was rare. You had to get the good view of her face, but when\nyou did so it was a splendid mobile mask. And the wearer of this\nhigh ornament had frankness and courage and variety--no end of the\nunusual and the unexpected. She had qualities that seldom went\ntogether--impulses and shynesses, audacities and lapses, something\ncoarse, popular, and strong all intermingled with disdains and languors\nand nerves. And then above all she was _there_, was accessible, almost\nbelonged to him. He reflected ingeniously that he owed his escape to a\npeculiar cause--to the fact that they had together a positive outside\nobject. Objective, as it were, was all their communion; not personal and\nselfish, but a matter of art and business and discussion. Discussion had\nsaved him and would save him further, for they would always have\nsomething to quarrel about. Sherringham, who was not a diplomatist for\nnothing, who had his reasons for steering straight and wished neither to\ndeprive the British public of a rising star nor to exchange his actual\nsituation for that of a yoked _impresario_, blessed the beneficence, the\nsalubrity, the pure exorcism of art. At the same time, rather\ninconsistently and feeling that he had a completer vision than before of\nthat oddest of animals the artist who happens to have been born a woman,\nhe felt warned against a serious connexion--he made a great point of the\n\"serious\"--with so slippery and ticklish a creature. The two ladies had\nonly to stay in Paris, save their candle-ends and, as Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 had\nenjoined, practise their scales: there were apparently no autumn visits\nto English country-houses in prospect for Mrs. Rooth. Peter parted with\nthem on the understanding that in London he would look as thoroughly as\npossible into the question of an engagement. The day before he began his\nholiday he went to see Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, who said to him, \"_Vous devriez\nbien nous la laisser_.\"\n\n\"She _has_ something then----?\"\n\n\"She has most things. She'll go far. It's the first time in my life of\nmy beginning with a mistake. But don't tell her so. I don't flatter her.\nShe'll be too puffed up.\"\n\n\"Is she very conceited?\" Sherringham asked.\n\n\"_Mauvais sujet!_\" said Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nIt was on the journey to London that he indulged in some of those\nquestionings of his state that I have mentioned; but I must add that by\nthe time he reached Charing Cross--he smoked a cigar deferred till after\nthe Channel in a compartment by himself--it had suddenly come over him\nthat they were futile. Now that he had left the girl a subversive,\nunpremeditated heart-beat told him--it made him hold his breath a minute\nin the carriage--that he had after all not escaped. He _was_ in love\nwith her: he had been in love with her from the first hour.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nThe drive from Harsh to the Place, as it was called thereabouts, could\nbe achieved by swift horses in less than ten minutes; and if Mrs.\nDallow's ponies were capital trotters the general high pitch of the\noccasion made it all congruous they should show their speed. The\noccasion was the polling-day an hour after the battle. The ponies had\nkept pace with other driven forces for the week before, passing and\nrepassing the neat windows of the flat little town--Mrs. Dallow had the\ncomplacent belief that there was none in the kingdom in which the\nflower-stands looked more respectable between the stiff muslin\ncurtains--with their mistress behind them on her all but silver wheels.\nVery often she was accompanied by the Liberal candidate, but even when\nshe was not the equipage seemed scarce less to represent his easy,\nfriendly confidence. It moved in a radiance of ribbons and hand-bills\nand hand-shakes and smiles; of quickened commerce and sudden intimacy;\nof sympathy which assumed without presuming and gratitude which promised\nwithout soliciting. But under Julia's guidance the ponies pattered now,\nwith no indication of a loss of freshness, along the firm, wide avenue\nwhich wound and curved, to make up in large effect for not undulating,\nfrom the gates opening straight on the town to the Palladian mansion,\nhigh, square, grey, and clean, which stood among terraces and fountains\nin the centre of the park. A generous steed had been sacrificed to bring\nthe good news from Ghent to Aix, but no such extravagance was after all\nnecessary for communicating with Lady Agnes.\n\nShe had remained at the house, not going to the Wheatsheaf, the Liberal\ninn, with the others; preferring to await in privacy and indeed in\nsolitude the momentous result of the poll. She had come down to Harsh\nwith the two girls in the course of the proceedings. Julia hadn't\nthought they would do much good, but she was expansive and indulgent now\nand had generously asked them. Lady Agnes had not a nice canvassing\nmanner, effective as she might have been in the character of the high,\nbenignant, affable mother--looking sweet participation but not\ninterfering--of the young and handsome, the shining, convincing,\nwonderfully clever and certainly irresistible aspirant. Grace Dormer had\nzeal without art, and Lady Agnes, who during her husband's lifetime had\nseen their affairs follow the satisfactory principle of a tendency to\ndefer to supreme merit, had never really learned the lesson that voting\ngoes by favour. However, she could pray God if, she couldn't make love\nto the cheesemonger, and Nick felt she had stayed at home to pray for\nhim. I must add that Julia Dallow was too happy now, flicking her whip\nin the bright summer air, to say anything so ungracious even to herself\nas that her companion had been returned in spite of his nearest female\nrelatives. Besides, Biddy _had_ been a rosy help: she had looked\npersuasively pretty, in white and blue, on platforms and in recurrent\ncarriages, out of which she had tossed, blushing and making people feel\nthey would remember her eyes, several words that were telling for their\nvery simplicity.\n\nMrs. Dallow was really too glad for any definite reflexion, even for\npersonal exultation, the vanity of recognising her own large share of\nthe work. Nick was in and was now beside her, tired, silent, vague,\nbeflowered and beribboned, and he had been splendid from beginning to\nend, beautifully good-humoured and at the same time beautifully\nclever--still cleverer than she had supposed he could be. The sense of\nher having quickened his cleverness and been repaid by it or by his\ngratitude--it came to the same thing--in a way she appreciated was not\nassertive and jealous: it was lost for the present in the general happy\nbreak of the long tension. So nothing passed between them in their\nprogress to the house; there was no sound in the park but the pleasant\nrustle of summer--it seemed an applausive murmur--and the swift roll of\nthe vehicle.\n\nLady Agnes already knew, for as soon as the result was declared Nick had\ndespatched a mounted man to her, carrying the figures on a scrawled\ncard. He himself had been far from getting away at once, having to\nrespond to the hubbub of acclamation, to speak yet again, to thank his\nelectors individually and collectively, to chaff the Tories without\ncheap elation, to be carried hither and yon, and above all to pretend\nthat the interest of the business was now greater for him than ever. If\nhe had said never a word after putting himself in Julia's hands to go\nhome it was partly perhaps because the consciousness had begun to\nglimmer within him, on the contrary, of some sudden shrinkage of that\ninterest. He wanted to see his mother because he knew she wanted to fold\nhim close in her arms. They had been open there for this purpose the\nlast half-hour, and her expectancy, now no longer an ache of suspense,\nwas the reason of Julia's round pace. Yet this very impatience in her\nsomehow made Nick wince a little. Meeting his mother was like being\nelected over again.\n\nThe others had not yet come back, and Lady Agnes was alone in the\nlarge, bright drawing-room. When Nick went in with Julia he saw her at\nthe further end; she had evidently been walking up and down the whole\nlength of it, and her tall, upright, black figure seemed in possession\nof the fair vastness after the manner of an exclamation-point at the\nbottom of a blank page. The room, rich and simple, was a place of\nperfection as well as of splendour in delicate tints, with precious\nspecimens of French furniture of the last century ranged against walls\nof pale brocade, and here and there a small, almost priceless picture.\nGeorge Dallow had made it, caring for these things and liking to talk\nabout them--scarce ever about anything else; so that it appeared to\nrepresent him still, what was best in his kindly, limited nature, his\nfriendly, competent, tiresome insistence on harmony--on identity of\n\"period.\" Nick could hear him yet, and could see him, too fat and with a\ncongenital thickness in his speech, lounging there in loose clothes with\nhis eternal cigarette. \"Now my dear fellow, _that_'s what I call form: I\ndon't know what you call it\"--that was the way he used to begin. All\nround were flowers in rare vases, but it looked a place of which the\nbeauty would have smelt sweet even without them.\n\nLady Agnes had taken a white rose from one of the clusters and was\nholding it to her face, which was turned to the door as Nick crossed the\nthreshold. The expression of her figure instantly told him--he saw the\ncreased card he had sent her lying on one of the beautiful bare\ntables--how she had been sailing up and down in a majesty of\nsatisfaction. The inflation of her long plain dress and the brightened\ndimness of her proud face were still in the air. In a moment he had\nkissed her and was being kissed, not in quick repetition, but in tender\nprolongation, with which the perfume of the white rose was mixed. But\nthere was something else too--her sweet smothered words in his ear: \"Oh\nmy boy, my boy--oh your father, your father!\" Neither the sense of\npleasure nor that of pain, with Lady Agnes--as indeed with most of the\npersons with whom this history is concerned--was a liberation of\nchatter; so that for a minute all she said again was, \"I think of Sir\nNicholas and wish he were here\"; addressing the words to Julia, who had\nwandered forward without looking at the mother and son.\n\n\"Poor Sir Nicholas!\" said Mrs. Dallow vaguely.\n\n\"Did you make another speech?\" Lady Agnes asked.\n\n\"I don't know. Did I?\" Nick appealed.\n\n\"I don't know!\"--and Julia spoke with her back turned, doing something\nto her hat before the glass.\n\n\"Oh of course the confusion, the bewilderment!\" said Lady Agnes in a\ntone rich in political reminiscence.\n\n\"It was really immense fun,\" Mrs. Dallow went so far as to drop.\n\n\"Dearest Julia!\" Lady Agnes deeply breathed. Then she added: \"It was you\nwho made it sure.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of people coming to dinner,\" said Julia.\n\n\"Perhaps you'll have to speak again,\" Lady Agnes smiled at her son.\n\n\"Thank you; I like the way you talk about it!\" cried Nick. \"I'm like\nIago: 'from this time forth I never will speak word!'\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Nick,\" said his mother gravely.\n\n\"Don't be afraid--he'll jabber like a magpie!\" And Julia went out of the\nroom.\n\nNick had flung himself on a sofa with an air of weariness, though not of\ncompletely extinct cheer; and Lady Agnes stood fingering her rose and\nlooking down at him. His eyes kept away from her; they seemed fixed on\nsomething she couldn't see. \"I hope you've thanked Julia handsomely,\"\nshe presently remarked.\n\n\"Why of course, mother.\"\n\n\"She has done as much as if you hadn't been sure.\"\n\n\"I wasn't in the least sure--and she has done everything.\"\n\n\"She has been too good--but _we_'ve done something. I hope you don't\nleave out your father,\" Lady Agnes amplified as Nick's glance appeared\nfor a moment to question her \"we.\"\n\n\"Never, never!\" Nick uttered these words perhaps a little mechanically,\nbut the next minute he added as if suddenly moved to think what he could\nsay that would give his mother most pleasure: \"Of course his name has\nworked for me. Gone as he is he's still a living force.\" He felt a good\ndeal of a hypocrite, but one didn't win such a seat every day in the\nyear. Probably indeed he should never win another.\n\n\"He hears you, he watches you, he rejoices in you,\" Lady Agnes opined.\n\nThis idea was oppressive to Nick--that of the rejoicing almost as much\nas of the watching. He had made his concession, but, with a certain\nimpulse to divert his mother from following up her advantage, he broke\nout: \"Julia's a tremendously effective woman.\"\n\n\"Of course she is!\" said Lady Agnes knowingly.\n\n\"Her charming appearance is half the battle\"--Nick explained a little\ncoldly what he meant. But he felt his coldness an inadequate protection\nto him when he heard his companion observe with something of the same\nsapience:\n\n\"A woman's always effective when she likes a person so much.\"\n\nIt discomposed him to be described as a person liked, and so much, and\nby a woman; and he simply said abruptly: \"When are you going away?\"\n\n\"The first moment that's civil--to-morrow morning. _You_'ll stay on I\nhope.\"\n\n\"Stay on? What shall I stay on for?\"\n\n\"Why you might stay to express your appreciation.\"\n\nNick considered. \"I've everything to do.\"\n\n\"I thought everything was done,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"Well, that's just why,\" her son replied, not very lucidly. \"I want to\ndo other things--quite other things. I should like to take the next\ntrain,\" And he looked at his watch.\n\n\"When there are people coming to dinner to meet you?\"\n\n\"They'll meet _you_--that's better.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry any one's coming,\" Lady Agnes said in a tone unencouraging to\na deviation from the reality of things. \"I wish we were alone--just as a\nfamily. It would please Julia to-day to feel that we _are_ one. Do stay\nwith her to-morrow.\"\n\n\"How will that do--when she's alone?\"\n\n\"She won't be alone, with Mrs. Gresham.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Gresham doesn't count.\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I want you to stop. And her cousin, almost her\nbrother: what an idea that it won't do! Haven't you stayed here before\nwhen there has been no one?\"\n\n\"I've never stayed much, and there have always been people. At any rate\nit's now different.\"\n\n\"It's just because it's different. Besides, it isn't different and it\nnever was,\" said Lady Agnes, more incoherent in her earnestness than it\noften happened to her to be. \"She always liked you and she likes you now\nmore than ever--if you call _that_ different!\" Nick got up at this and,\nwithout meeting her eyes, walked to one of the windows, where he stood\nwith his back turned and looked out on the great greenness. She watched\nhim a moment and she might well have been wishing, while he appeared to\ngaze with intentness, that it would come to him with the same force as\nit had come to herself--very often before, but during these last days\nmore than ever--that the level lands of Harsh, stretching away before\nthe window, the French garden with its symmetry, its screens and its\nstatues, and a great many more things of which these were the\nsuperficial token, were Julia's very own to do with exactly as she\nliked. No word of appreciation or envy, however, dropped from the young\nman's lips, and his mother presently went on: \"What could be more\nnatural than that after your triumphant contest you and she should have\nlots to settle and to talk about--no end of practical questions, no end\nof urgent business? Aren't you her member, and can't her member pass a\nday with her, and she a great proprietor?\"\n\nNick turned round at this with an odd expression. \"_Her_ member--am I\nhers?\"\n\nLady Agnes had a pause--she had need of all her tact. \"Well, if the\nplace is hers and you represent the place--!\" she began. But she went no\nfurther, for Nick had interrupted her with a laugh.\n\n\"What a droll thing to 'represent,' when one thinks of it! And what does\n_it_ represent, poor stupid little borough with its strong, though I\nadmit clean, smell of meal and its curiously fat-faced inhabitants? Did\nyou ever see such a collection of fat faces turned up at the hustings?\nThey looked like an enormous sofa, with the cheeks for the gathers and\nthe eyes for the buttons.\"\n\n\"Oh well, the next time you shall have a great town,\" Lady Agnes\nreturned, smiling and feeling that she _was_ tactful.\n\n\"It will only be a bigger sofa! I'm joking, of course?\" Nick pursued,\n\"and I ought to be ashamed of myself. They've done me the honour to\nelect me and I shall never say a word that's not civil about them, poor\ndears. But even a new member may blaspheme to his mother.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd be serious to your mother\"--and she went nearer him.\n\n\"The difficulty is that I'm two men; it's the strangest thing that ever\nwas,\" Nick professed with his bright face on her. \"I'm two quite\ndistinct human beings, who have scarcely a point in common; not even the\nmemory, on the part of one, of the achievements or the adventures of the\nother. One man wins the seat but it's the other fellow who sits in it.\"\n\n\"Oh Nick, don't spoil your victory by your perversity!\" she cried as she\nclasped her hands to him.\n\n\"I went through it with great glee--I won't deny that: it excited me,\ninterested me, amused me. When once I was in it I liked it. But now that\nI'm out of it again----!\"\n\n\"Out of it?\" His mother stared. \"Isn't the whole point that you're in?\"\n\n\"Ah _now_ I'm only in the House of Commons.\"\n\nFor an instant she seemed not to understand and to be on the point of\nlaying her finger quickly to her lips with a \"Hush!\"--as if the late Sir\nNicholas might have heard the \"only.\" Then while a comprehension of the\nyoung man's words promptly superseded that impulse she replied with\nforce: \"You'll be in the Lords the day you determine to get there.\"\n\nThis futile remark made Nick laugh afresh, and not only laugh, but kiss\nher, which was always an intenser form of mystification for poor Lady\nAgnes and apparently the one he liked best to inflict; after which he\nsaid: \"The odd thing is, you know, that Harsh has no wants. At least\nit's not sharply, not articulately conscious of them. We all pretended\nto talk them over together, and I promised to carry them in my heart of\nhearts. But upon my honour I can't remember one of them. Julia says the\nwants of Harsh are simply the national wants--rather a pretty phrase for\nJulia. She means _she_ does everything for the place; _she_'s really\ntheir member and this house in which we stand their legislative chamber.\nTherefore the _lacunae_ I've undertaken to fill out are the national\nwants. It will be rather a job to rectify some of them, won't it? I\ndon't represent the appetites of Harsh--Harsh is gorged. I represent the\nideas of my party. That's what Julia says.\"\n\n\"Oh never mind what Julia says!\" Lady Agnes broke out impatiently. This\nimpatience made it singular that the very next word she uttered should\nbe: \"My dearest son, I wish to heaven you'd marry her. It would be so\nfitting now!\" she added.\n\n\"Why now?\" Nick frowned.\n\n\"She has shown you such sympathy, such devotion.\"\n\n\"Is it for that she has shown it?\"\n\n\"Ah you might _feel_--I can't tell you!\" said Lady Agnes reproachfully.\n\nHe blushed at this, as if what he did feel was the reproach. \"Must I\nmarry her because you like her?\"\n\n\"I? Why we're _all_ as fond of her as we can be.\"\n\n\"Dear mother, I hope that any woman I ever may marry will be a person\nagreeable not only to you, but also, since you make a point of it, to\nGrace and Biddy. But I must tell you this--that I shall marry no woman\nI'm not unmistakably in love with.\"\n\n\"And why are you not in love with Julia--charming, clever, generous as\nshe is?\" Lady Agnes laid her hands on him--she held him tight. \"Dearest\nNick, if you care anything in the world to make me happy you'll stay\nover here to-morrow and be nice to her.\"\n\nHe waited an instant. \"Do you mean propose to her?\"\n\n\"With a single word, with the glance of an eye, the movement of your\nlittle finger\"--and she paused, looking intensely, imploringly up into\nhis face--\"in less time than it takes me to say what I say now, you may\nhave it all.\" As he made no answer, only meeting her eyes, she added\ninsistently: \"You know she's a fine creature--you know she is!\"\n\n\"Dearest mother, what I seem to know better than anything else in the\nworld is that I love my freedom. I set it far above everything.\"\n\n\"Your freedom? What freedom is there in being poor?\" Lady Agnes fiercely\ndemanded. \"Talk of that when Julia puts everything she possesses at your\nfeet!\"\n\n\"I can't talk of it, mother--it's too terrible an idea. And I can't talk\nof _her_, nor of what I think of her. You must leave that to me. I do\nher perfect justice.\"\n\n\"You don't or you'd marry her to-morrow,\" she passionately argued.\n\"You'd feel the opportunity so beautifully rare, with everything in the\nworld to make it perfect. Your father would have valued it for you\nbeyond everything. Think a little what would have given _him_ pleasure.\nThat's what I meant when I spoke just now of us all. It wasn't of Grace\nand Biddy I was thinking--fancy!--it was of him. He's with you always;\nhe takes with you, at your side, every step you take yourself. He'd\nbless devoutly your marriage to Julia; he'd feel what it would be for\nyou and for us all. I ask for no sacrifice and he'd ask for none. We\nonly ask that you don't commit the crime----!\"\n\nNick Dormer stopped her with another kiss; he murmured \"Mother, mother,\nmother!\" as he bent over her. He wished her not to go on, to let him\noff; but the deep deprecation in his voice didn't prevent her saying:\n\n\"You know it--you know it perfectly. All and more than all that I can\ntell you you know.\" He drew her closer, kissed her again, held her as he\nwould have held a child in a paroxysm, soothing her silently till it\ncould abate. Her vehemence had brought with it tears; she dried them as\nshe disengaged herself. The next moment, however, she resumed, attacking\nhim again: \"For a public man she'd be the perfect companion. She's made\nfor public life--she's made to shine, to be concerned in great things,\nto occupy a high position and to help him on. She'd back you up in\neverything as she has backed you in this. Together there's nothing you\ncouldn't do. You can have the first house in England--yes, the very\nfirst! What freedom _is_ there in being poor? How can you do anything\nwithout money, and what money can you make for yourself--what money will\never come to you? That's the crime--to throw away such an instrument of\npower, such a blessed instrument of good.\"\n\n\"It isn't everything to be rich, mother,\" said Nick, looking at the\nfloor with a particular patience--that is with a provisional docility\nand his hands in his pockets. \"And it isn't so fearful to be poor.\"\n\n\"It's vile--it's abject. Don't I know?\"\n\n\"Are you in such acute want?\" he smiled.\n\n\"Ah don't make me explain what you've only to look at to see!\" his\nmother returned as if with a richness of allusion to dark elements in\nher fate.\n\n\"Besides,\" he easily went on, \"there's other money in the world than\nJulia's. I might come by some of that.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Mr. Carteret's?\" The question made him laugh as her feeble\nreference five minutes before to the House of Lords had done. But she\npursued, too full of her idea to take account of such a poor substitute\nfor an answer: \"Let me tell you one thing, for I've known Charles\nCarteret much longer than you and I understand him better. There's\nnothing you could do that would do you more good with him than to marry\nJulia. I know the way he looks at things and I know exactly how that\nwould strike him. It would please him, it would charm him; it would be\nthe thing that would most prove to him that you're in earnest. You need,\nyou know, to do something of that sort,\" she said as for plain speaking.\n\n\"Haven't I come in for Harsh?\" asked Nick.\n\n\"Oh he's very canny. He likes to see people rich. _Then_ he believes in\nthem--then he's likely to believe more. He's kind to you because you're\nyour father's son; but I'm sure your being poor takes just so much off.\"\n\n\"He can remedy that so easily,\" said Nick, smiling still. \"Is my being\nkept by Julia what you call my making an effort for myself?\"\n\nLady Agnes hesitated; then \"You needn't insult Julia!\" she replied.\n\n\"Moreover, if I've _her_ money I shan't want his,\" Nick unheedingly\nremarked.\n\nAgain his mother waited before answering; after which she produced: \"And\npray wouldn't you wish to be independent?\"\n\n\"You're delightful, dear mother--you're very delightful! I particularly\nlike your conception of independence. Doesn't it occur to you that at a\npinch I might improve my fortune by some other means than by making a\nmercenary marriage or by currying favour with a rich old gentleman?\nDoesn't it occur to you that I might work?\"\n\n\"Work at politics? How does that make money, honourably?\"\n\n\"I don't mean at politics.\"\n\n\"What do you mean then?\"--and she seemed to challenge him to phrase it\nif he dared. This demonstration of her face and voice might have\naffected him, for he remained silent and she continued: \"Are you elected\nor not?\"\n\n\"It seems a dream,\" he rather flatly returned.\n\n\"If you are, act accordingly and don't mix up things that are as wide\nasunder as the poles!\" She spoke with sternness and his silence appeared\nagain to represent an admission that her sternness counted for him.\nPossibly she was touched by it; after a few moments, at any rate, during\nwhich nothing more passed between them, she appealed to him in a gentler\nand more anxious key, which had this virtue to touch him that he knew it\nwas absolutely the first time in her life she had really begged for\nanything. She had never been obliged to beg; she had got on without it\nand most things had come to her. He might judge therefore in what a\nlight she regarded this boon for which in her bereft old age she humbled\nherself to be a suitor. There was such a pride in her that he could feel\nwhat it cost her to go on her knees even to her son. He did judge how it\nwas in his power to gratify her; and as he was generous and imaginative\nhe was stirred and shaken as it came over him in a wave of figurative\nsuggestion that he might make up to her for many things. He scarcely\nneeded to hear her ask with a pleading wail that was almost tragic:\n\"Don't you see how things have turned out for us? Don't you know how\nunhappy I am, don't you know what a bitterness----?\" She stopped with a\nsob in her voice and he recognised vividly this last tribulation, the\nunhealed wound of her change of life and her lapse from eminence to\nflatness. \"You know what Percival is and the comfort I have of him. You\nknow the property and what he's doing with it and what comfort I get\nfrom _that_! Everything's dreary but what you can do for us.\nEverything's odious, down to living in a hole with one's girls who don't\nmarry. Grace is impossible--I don't know what's the matter with her; no\none will look at her, and she's so conceited with it--sometimes I feel\nas if I could beat her! And Biddy will never marry, and we're three\ndismal women in a filthy house, and what are three dismal women, more or\nless, in London?\"\n\nSo with an unexpected rage of self-exposure she poured out her\ndisappointments and troubles, tore away the veil from her sadness and\nsoreness. It almost scared him to see how she hated her life, though at\nanother time it might have been amusing to note how she despised her\ngardenless house. Of course it wasn't a country-house, and she couldn't\nget used to that. Better than he could do--for it was the sort of thing\ninto which in any case a woman enters more than a man--she felt what a\nlift into brighter air, what a regilding of his sisters' possibilities,\nhis marriage to Julia would effect for them. He couldn't trace the\ndifference, but his mother saw it all as a shining picture. She hung the\nbright vision before him now--she stood there like a poor woman crying\nfor a kindness. What was filial in him, all the piety he owed,\nespecially to the revived spirit of his father, more than ever present\non a day of such public pledges, became from one moment to the other as\nthe very handle to the door of the chamber of concessions. He had the\nimpulse, so embarrassing when it is a question of consistent action, to\nsee in a touching, an interesting light any forcibly presented side of\nthe life of another: such things effected a union with something in\n_his_ life, and in the recognition of them was no soreness of sacrifice\nand no consciousness of merit.\n\nRapidly, at present, this change of scene took place before his\nspiritual eye. He found himself believing, because his mother\ncommunicated the belief, that it depended but on his own conduct richly\nto alter the social outlook of the three women who clung to him and who\ndeclared themselves forlorn. This was not the highest kind of motive,\nbut it contained a spring, it touched into life again old injunctions\nand appeals. Julia's wide kingdom opened out round him and seemed\nsomehow to wear the face of his own possible future. His mother and\nsisters floated in the rosy element as if he had breathed it about them.\n\"The first house in England\" she had called it; but it might be the\nfirst house in Europe, the first in the world, by the fine air and the\nhigh humanities that should fill it. Everything beautiful in his actual,\nhis material view seemed to proclaim its value as never before; the\nhouse rose over his head as a museum of exquisite rewards, and the image\nof poor George Dallow hovered there obsequious, expressing that he had\nonly been the modest, tasteful organiser, or even upholsterer, appointed\nto set it all in order and punctually retire. Lady Agnes's tone in fine\npenetrated further than it had done yet when she brought out with\nintensity: \"Don't desert us--don't desert us.\"\n\n\"Don't desert you----?\"\n\n\"Be great--be great. I'm old, I've lived, I've seen. Go in for a great\nmaterial position. That will simplify everything else.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can for you--anything, everything I can. Trust me--leave\nme alone,\" Nick went on.\n\n\"And you'll stay over--you'll spend the day with her?\"\n\n\"I'll stay till she turns me out!\"\n\nHis mother had hold of his hand again now: she raised it to her lips\nand kissed it. \"My dearest son, my only joy!\" Then: \"I don't see how you\ncan resist her,\" she added.\n\n\"No more do I!\"\n\nShe looked about--there was so much to look at--with a deep exhalation.\n\"If you're so fond of art, what art is equal to all this? The joy of\nliving in the midst of it--of seeing the finest works every day! You'll\nhave everything the world can give.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what was just passing in my own mind. It's too much,\"\nNick reasoned.\n\n\"Don't be selfish!\"\n\n\"Selfish?\" he echoed.\n\n\"Unselfish then. You'll share it with us.\"\n\n\"And with Julia a little, I hope,\" he said.\n\n\"God bless you!\" cried his mother, looking up at him. Her eyes were\ndetained by the sudden sense of something in his own that was not clear\nto her; but before she could challenge it he asked abruptly:\n\n\"Why do you talk so of poor Biddy? Why won't she marry?\"\n\n\"You had better ask Peter Sherringham,\" said Lady Agnes.\n\n\"What has he to do with it?\"\n\n\"How odd of you not to know--when it's so plain how she thinks of him\nthat it's a matter of common gossip.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you will--we've made it so, and she takes it as an angel. But\nPeter likes her.\"\n\n\"Does he? Then it's the more shame to him to behave as he does. He had\nbetter leave his wretched actresses alone. That's the love of art too!\"\nmocked Lady Agnes.\n\nBut Nick glossed it all over. \"Biddy's so charming she'll easily marry\nsome one else.\"\n\n\"Never, if she loves him. However, Julia will bring it about--Julia\nwill help her,\" his mother pursued more cheerfully. \"That's what you'll\ndo for us--that _she'll_ do everything!\"\n\n\"Why then more than now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because we shall be yours.\"\n\n\"You're mine already.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she isn't. However, she's as good!\" Lady Agnes exulted.\n\n\"She'll turn me out of the house,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Come and tell me when she does! But there she is--go to her!\" And she\ngave him a push toward one of the windows that stood open to the\nterrace. Their hostess had become visible outside; she passed slowly\nalong the terrace with her long shadow. \"Go to her,\" his mother\nrepeated--\"she's waiting for you.\"\n\nNick went out with the air of a man as ready to pass that way as\nanother, and at the same moment his two sisters, still flushed with\nparticipation, appeared in a different quarter.\n\n\"We go home to-morrow, but Nick will stay a day or two,\" Lady Agnes said\nto them.\n\n\"Dear old Nick!\" Grace ejaculated looking at her with intensity.\n\n\"He's going to speak,\" she went on. \"But don't mention it.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it?\" Biddy asked with a milder stare. \"Hasn't he spoken\nenough, poor fellow?\"\n\n\"I mean to Julia,\" Lady Agnes replied.\n\n\"Don't you understand, you goose?\"--and Grace turned on her sister.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThe next morning brought the young man many letters and telegrams, and\nhis coffee was placed beside him in his room, where he remained until\nnoon answering these communications. When he came out he learned that\nhis mother and sisters had left the house. This information was given\nhim by Mrs. Gresham, whom he found dealing with her own voluminous\nbudget at one of the tables in the library. She was a lady who received\nthirty letters a day, the subject-matter of which, as well as of her\npunctual answers in a hand that would have been \"ladylike\" in a\nmanageress, was a puzzle to those who observed her.\n\nShe told Nick that Lady Agnes had not been willing to disturb him at his\nwork to say good-bye, knowing she should see him in a day or two in\ntown. He was amused at the way his mother had stolen off--as if she\nfeared further conversation might weaken the spell she believed herself\nto have wrought. The place was cleared, moreover, of its other visitors,\nso that, as Mrs. Gresham said, the fun was at an end. This lady\nexpressed the idea that the fun was after all rather a bore. At any rate\nnow they could rest, Mrs. Dallow and Nick and she, and she was glad Nick\nwas going to stay for a little quiet. She liked Harsh best when it was\nnot _en f\u00c3\u00aate_: then one could see what a sympathetic old place it was.\nShe hoped Nick was not dreadfully fagged--she feared Julia was\ncompletely done up. Julia, however, had transported her exhaustion to\nthe grounds--she was wandering about somewhere. She thought more people\nwould be coming to the house, people from the town, people from the\ncountry, and had gone out so as not to have to see them. She had not\ngone far--Nick could easily find her. Nick intimated that he himself was\nnot eager for more people, whereupon Mrs. Gresham rather archly smiled.\n\"And of course you hate _me_ for being here.\" He made some protest and\nshe added: \"But I'm almost part of the house, you know--I'm one of the\nchairs or tables.\" Nick declared that he had never seen a house so well\nfurnished, and Mrs. Gresham said: \"I believe there _are_ to be some\npeople to dinner; rather an interference, isn't it? Julia lives so in\npublic. But it's all for you.\" And after a moment she added: \"It's a\nwonderful constitution.\" Nick at first failed to seize her allusion--he\nthought it a retarded political reference, a sudden tribute to the great\nunwritten instrument by which they were all governed and under the happy\noperation of which his fight had been so successful. He was on the point\nof saying, \"The British? Wonderful!\" when he gathered that the intention\nof his companion had been simply to praise Mrs. Dallow's fine\nrobustness. \"The surface so delicate, the action so easy, yet the frame\nof steel.\"\n\nHe left Mrs. Gresham to her correspondence and went out of the house;\nwondering as he walked if she wanted him to do the same thing his mother\nwanted, so that her words had been intended for a prick--whether even\nthe two ladies had talked over their desire together. Mrs. Gresham was a\nmarried woman who was usually taken for a widow, mainly because she was\nperpetually \"sent for\" by her friends, who in no event sent for Mr.\nGresham. She came in every case, with her air of being _r\u00c3\u00a9pandue_ at\nthe expense of dingier belongings. Her figure was admired--that is it\nwas sometimes mentioned--and she dressed as if it was expected of her to\nbe smart, like a young woman in a shop or a servant much in view. She\nslipped in and out, accompanied at the piano, talked to the neglected\nvisitors, walked in the rain, and after the arrival of the post usually\nhad conferences with her hostess, during which she stroked her chin and\nlooked familiarly responsible. It was her peculiarity that people were\nalways saying things to her in a lowered voice. She had all sorts of\nacquaintances and in small establishments sometimes wrote the _menus_.\nGreat ones, on the other hand, had no terrors for her--she had seen too\nmany. No one had ever discovered whether any one else paid her. People\nonly knew what _they_ did.\n\nIf Lady Agnes had in the minor key discussed with her the propriety of a\nunion between the mistress of Harsh and the hope of the Dormers this\nlast personage could take the circumstance for granted without\nirritation and even with cursory indulgence; for he was got unhappy now\nand his spirit was light and clear. The summer day was splendid and the\nworld, as he looked at it from the terrace, offered no more worrying\nambiguity than a vault of airy blue arching over a lap of solid green.\nThe wide, still trees in the park appeared to be waiting for some daily\ninspection, and the rich fields, with their official frill of hedges, to\nrejoice in the light that smiled upon them as named and numbered acres.\nNick felt himself catch the smile and all the reasons of it: they made\nup a charm to which he had perhaps not hitherto done justice--something\nof the impression he had received when younger from showy \"views\" of\nfine country-seats that had pressed and patted nature, as by the fat\nhands of \"benches\" of magistrates and landlords, into supreme\nrespectability and comfort. There were a couple of peacocks on the\nterrace, and his eye was caught by the gleam of the swans on a distant\nlake, where was also a little temple on an island; and these objects\nfell in with his humour, which at another time might have been ruffled\nby them as aggressive triumphs of the conventional.\n\nIt was certainly a proof of youth and health on his part that his\nspirits had risen as the plot thickened and that after he had taken his\njump into the turbid waters of a contested election he had been able to\ntumble and splash not only without a sense of awkwardness but with a\nconsiderable capacity for the frolic. Tepid as we saw him in Paris he\nhad found his relation to his opportunity surprisingly altered by his\nlittle journey across the Channel, had seen things in a new perspective\nand breathed an air that set him and kept him in motion. There had been\nsomething in it that went to his head--an element that his mother and\nhis sisters, his father from beyond the grave, Julia Dallow, the Liberal\nparty and a hundred friends, were both secretly and overtly occupied in\npumping into it. If he but half-believed in victory he at least liked\nthe wind of the onset in his ears, and he had a general sense that when\none was \"stuck\" there was always the nearest thing at which one must\npull. The embarrassment, that is the revival of scepticism, which might\nproduce an inconsistency shameful to exhibit and yet difficult to\nconceal, was safe enough to come later. Indeed at the risk of presenting\nour young man as too whimsical a personage I may hint that some such\nsickly glow had even now begun to tinge one quarter of his inward\nhorizon.\n\nI am afraid, moreover, that I have no better excuse for him than the one\nhe had touched on in that momentous conversation with his mother which\nI have thought it useful to reproduce in full. He was conscious of a\ndouble nature; there were two men in him, quite separate, whose leading\nfeatures had little in common and each of whom insisted on having an\nindependent turn at life. Meanwhile then, if he was adequately aware\nthat the bed of his moral existence would need a good deal of making\nover if he was to lie upon it without unseemly tossing, he was also\nalive to the propriety of not parading his inconsistencies, not letting\nhis unregulated passions become a spectacle to the vulgar. He had none\nof that wish to appear deep which is at the bottom of most forms of\nfatuity; he was perfectly willing to pass for decently superficial; he\nonly aspired to be decently continuous. When you were not suitably\nshallow this presented difficulties; but he would have assented to the\nproposition that you must be as subtle as you can and that a high use of\nsubtlety is in consuming the smoke of your inner fire. The fire was the\ngreat thing, not the chimney. He had no view of life that counted out\nthe need of learning; it was teaching rather as to which he was\nconscious of no particular mission. He enjoyed life, enjoyed it\nimmensely, and was ready to pursue it with patience through as many\nchannels as possible. He was on his guard, however, against making an\nass of himself, that is against not thinking out his experiments before\ntrying them in public. It was because, as yet, he liked life in general\nbetter than it was clear to him he liked particular possibilities that,\non the occasion of a constituency's holding out a cordial hand to him\nwhile it extended another in a different direction, a certain bloom of\nboyhood that was on him had not paled at the idea of a match.\n\nHe had risen to the fray as he had risen to matches at school, for his\nboyishness could still take a pleasure in an inconsiderate show of\nagility. He could meet electors and conciliate bores and compliment\nwomen and answer questions and roll off speeches and chaff\nadversaries--he could do these things because it was amusing and\nslightly dangerous, like playing football or ascending an Alp, pastimes\nfor which nature had conferred on him an aptitude not so very different\nin kind from a due volubility on platforms. There were two voices to\nadmonish him that all this was not really action at all, but only a\npusillanimous imitation of it: one of them fitfully audible in the\ndepths of his own spirit and the other speaking, in the equivocal\naccents of a very crabbed hand, from a letter of four pages by Gabriel\nNash. However, Nick carried the imitation as far as possible, and the\nflood of sound floated him. What more could a working faith have done?\nHe had not broken with the axiom that in a case of doubt one should hold\noff, for this applied to choice, and he had not at present the slightest\npretension to choosing. He knew he was lifted along, that what he was\ndoing was not first-rate, that nothing was settled by it and that if\nthere was a hard knot in his life it would only grow harder with\nkeeping. Doing one's sum to-morrow instead of to-day doesn't make the\nsum easier, but at least makes to-day so.\n\nSometimes in the course of the following fortnight it seemed to him he\nhad gone in for Harsh because he was sure he should lose; sometimes he\nforesaw that he should win precisely to punish him for having tried and\nfor his want of candour; and when presently he did win he was almost\nscared at his success. Then it appeared to him he had done something\neven worse than not choose--he had let others choose for him. The beauty\nof it was that they had chosen with only their own object in their eye,\nfor what did they know about his strange alternative? He was rattled\nabout so for a fortnight--Julia taking care of this--that he had no time\nto think save when he tried to remember a quotation or an American\nstory, and all his life became an overflow of verbiage. Thought couldn't\nhear itself for the noise, which had to be pleasant and persuasive, had\nto hang more or less together, without its aid. Nick was surprised at\nthe airs he could play, and often when, the last thing at night, he shut\nthe door of his room, found himself privately exclaiming that he had had\nno idea he was such a mountebank.\n\nI must add that if this reflexion didn't occupy him long, and if no\nmeditation, after his return from Paris, held him for many moments,\nthere was a reason better even than that he was tired, that he was busy,\nthat he appreciated the coincidence of the hit and the hurrah, the\nhurrah and the hit. That reason was simply Mrs. Dallow, who had suddenly\nbecome a still larger fact in his consciousness than his having turned\nactively political. She _was_ indeed his being so--in the sense that if\nthe politics were his, how little soever, the activity was hers. She had\nbetter ways of showing she was clever than merely saying clever\nthings--which in general only prove at the most that one would be clever\nif one could. The accomplished fact itself was almost always the\ndemonstration that Mrs. Dallow could; and when Nick came to his senses\nafter the proclamation of the victor and the drop of the uproar her\nfigure was, of the whole violent dance of shadows, the only thing that\ncame back, that stayed. She had been there at each of the moments,\npassing, repassing, returning, before him, beside him, behind him. She\nhad made the business infinitely prettier than it would have been\nwithout her, added music and flowers and ices, a finer charm, converting\nit into a kind of heroic \"function,\" the form of sport most dangerous.\nIt had been a garden-party, say, with one's life at stake from pressure\nof the crowd. The concluded affair had bequeathed him thus not only a\nseat in the House of Commons, but a perception of what may come of women\nin high embodiments and an abyss of intimacy with one woman in\nparticular.\n\nShe had wrapped him up in something, he didn't know what--a sense of\nfacility, an overpowering fragrance--and they had moved together in an\nimmense fraternity. There had been no love-making, no contact that was\nonly personal, no vulgarity of flirtation: the hurry of the days and the\nsharpness with which they both tended to an outside object had made all\nthat irrelevant. It was as if she had been too near for him to see her\nseparate from himself; but none the less, when he now drew breath and\nlooked back, what had happened met his eyes as a composed picture--a\npicture of which the subject was inveterately Julia and her ponies:\nJulia wonderfully fair and fine, waving her whip, cleaving the crowd,\nholding her head as if it had been a banner, smiling up into\nsecond-storey windows, carrying him beside her, carrying him to his\ndoom. He had not reckoned at the time, in the few days, how much he had\ndriven about with her; but the image of it was there, in his consulted\nconscience, as well as in a personal glow not yet chilled: it looked\nlarge as it rose before him. The things his mother had said to him made\na rich enough frame for it all, and the whole impression had that night\nkept him much awake.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nWhile, after leaving Mrs. Gresham, he was hesitating which way to go and\nwas on the point of hailing a gardener to ask if Mrs. Dallow had been\nseen, he noticed, as a spot of colour in an expanse of shrubbery, a\nfar-away parasol moving in the direction of the lake. He took his course\ntoward it across the park, and as the bearer of the parasol strolled\nslowly it was not five minutes before he had joined her. He went to her\nsoundlessly, on the grass--he had been whistling at first, but as he got\nnearer stopped--and it was not till he was at hand that she looked\nround. He had watched her go as if she were turning things over in her\nmind, while she brushed the smooth walks and the clean turf with her\ndress, slowly made her parasol revolve on her shoulder and carried in\nthe other hand a book which he perceived to be a monthly review.\n\n\"I came out to get away,\" she said when he had begun to walk with her.\n\n\"Away from me?\"\n\n\"Ah that's impossible.\" Then she added: \"The day's so very nice.\"\n\n\"Lovely weather,\" Nick dropped. \"You want to get away from Mrs. Gresham,\nI suppose.\"\n\nShe had a pause. \"From everything!\"\n\n\"Well, I want to get away too.\"\n\n\"It has been such a racket. Listen to the dear birds.\"\n\n\"Yes, our noise isn't so good as theirs,\" said Nick. \"I feel as if I had\nbeen married and had shoes and rice thrown after me,\" he went on. \"But\nnot to you, Julia--nothing so good as that.\"\n\nJulia made no reply; she only turned her eyes on the ornamental water\nstretching away at their right. In a moment she exclaimed, \"How nasty\nthe lake looks!\" and Nick recognised in her tone a sign of that odd\nshyness--a perverse stiffness at a moment when she probably but wanted\nto be soft--which, taken in combination with her other qualities, was so\nfar from being displeasing to him that it represented her nearest\napproach to extreme charm. _He_ was not shy now, for he considered this\nmorning that he saw things very straight and in a sense altogether\nsuperior and delightful. This enabled him to be generously sorry for his\ncompanion--if he were the reason of her being in any degree\nuncomfortable, and yet left him to enjoy some of the motions, not in\nthemselves without grace, by which her discomfort was revealed. He\nwouldn't insist on anything yet: so he observed that her standard in\nlakes was too high, and then talked a little about his mother and the\ngirls, their having gone home, his not having seen them that morning,\nLady Agnes's deep satisfaction in his victory, and the fact that she\nwould be obliged to \"do something\" for the autumn--take a house or\nsomething or other.\n\n\"I'll lend her a house,\" said Mrs. Dallow.\n\n\"Oh Julia, Julia!\" Nick half groaned.\n\nBut she paid no attention to his sound; she only held up her review and\nsaid: \"See what I've brought with me to read--Mr. Hoppus's article.\"\n\n\"That's right; then _I_ shan't have to. You'll tell me about it.\" He\nuttered this without believing she had meant or wished to read the\narticle, which was entitled \"The Revision of the British Constitution,\"\nin spite of her having encumbered herself with the stiff, fresh\nmagazine. He was deeply aware she was not in want of such inward\noccupation as periodical literature could supply. They walked along and\nhe added: \"But is that what we're in for, reading Mr. Hoppus? Is it the\nsort of thing constituents expect? Or, even worse, pretending to have\nread him when one hasn't? Oh what a tangled web we weave!\"\n\n\"People are talking about it. One has to know. It's the article of the\nmonth.\"\n\nNick looked at her askance. \"You say things every now and then for which\nI could really kill you. 'The article of the month,' for instance: I\ncould kill you for that.\"\n\n\"Well, kill me!\" Mrs. Dallow returned.\n\n\"Let me carry your book,\" he went on irrelevantly. The hand in which she\nheld it was on the side of her on which he was walking, and he put out\nhis own hand to take it. But for a couple of minutes she forbore to give\nit up, so that they held it together, swinging it a little. Before she\nsurrendered it he asked where she was going.\n\n\"To the island,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, I'll go with you--and I'll kill you there.\"\n\n\"The things I say are the right things,\" Julia declared.\n\n\"It's just the right things that are wrong. It's because you're so\npolitical,\" Nick too lightly explained. \"It's your horrible ambition.\nThe woman who has a salon should have read the article of the month. See\nhow one dreadful thing leads to another.\"\n\n\"There are some things that lead to nothing,\" said Mrs. Dallow.\n\n\"No doubt--no doubt. And how are you going to get over to your island?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a boat?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nNick had paused to look round for the boat, but his hostess walked on\nwithout turning her head. \"Can you row?\" he then asked.\n\n\"Don't you know I can do everything?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure. That's why I want to kill you. There's the boat.\"\n\n\"Shall you drown me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh let me perish with you!\" Nick answered with a sigh. The boat had\nbeen hidden from them by the bole of a great tree which rose from the\ngrass at the water's edge. It was moored to a small place of embarkation\nand was large enough to hold as many persons as were likely to wish to\nvisit at once the little temple in the middle of the lake, which Nick\nliked because it was absurd and which Mrs. Dallow had never had a\nparticular esteem for. The lake, fed by a natural spring, was a liberal\nsheet of water, measured by the scale of park scenery; and though its\nprincipal merit was that, taken at a distance, it gave a gleam of\nabstraction to the concrete verdure, doing the office of an open eye in\na dull face, it could also be approached without derision on a sweet\nsummer morning when it made a lapping sound and reflected candidly\nvarious things that were probably finer than itself--the sky, the great\ntrees, the flight of birds. A man of taste, coming back from Rome a\nhundred years before, had caused a small ornamental structure to be\nraised, from artificial foundations, on its bosom, and had endeavoured\nto make this architectural pleasantry as nearly as possible a\nreminiscence of the small ruined rotunda which stands on the bank of the\nTiber and is pronounced by _ciceroni_ once sacred to Vesta. It was\ncircular, roofed with old tiles, surrounded by white columns and\nconsiderably dilapidated. George Dallow had taken an interest in it--it\nreminded him not in the least of Rome, but of other things he liked--and\nhad amused himself with restoring it. \"Give me your hand--sit there and\nI'll ferry you,\" Nick said.\n\nJulia complied, placing herself opposite him in the boat; but as he took\nup the paddles she declared that she preferred to remain on the\nwater--there was too much malice prepense in the temple. He asked her\nwhat she meant by that, and she said it was ridiculous to withdraw to an\nisland a few feet square on purpose to meditate. She had nothing to\nmeditate about that required so much scenery and attitude.\n\n\"On the contrary, it would be just to change the scene and the _pose_.\nIt's what we have been doing for a week that's attitude; and to be for\nhalf an hour where nobody's looking and one hasn't to keep it up is just\nwhat I wanted to put in an idle irresponsible day for. I'm not keeping\nit up now--I suppose you've noticed,\" Nick went on as they floated and\nhe scarcely dipped the oars.\n\n\"I don't understand you\"--and Julia leaned back in the boat.\n\nHe gave no further explanation than to ask in a minute: \"Have you people\nto dinner to-night?\"\n\n\"I believe there are three or four, but I'll put them off if you like.\"\n\n\"Must you _always_ live in public, Julia?\" he continued.\n\nShe looked at him a moment and he could see how she coloured. \"We'll go\nhome--I'll put them off.\"\n\n\"Ah no, don't go home; it's too jolly here. Let them come, let them\ncome, poor wretches!\"\n\n\"How little you know me,\" Julia presently broke out, \"when, ever so\nmany times, I've lived here for months without a creature!\"\n\n\"Except Mrs. Gresham, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I have had to have the house going, I admit.\"\n\n\"You're perfect, you're admirable, and I don't criticise you.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you!\" she tossed back.\n\n\"That only adds to the generosity of what you've done for me,\" Nick\nreturned, beginning to pull faster. He bent over the oars and sent the\nboat forward, keeping this up for a succession of minutes during which\nthey both remained silent. His companion, in her place, motionless,\nreclining--the seat in the stern was most comfortable--looked only at\nthe water, the sky, the trees. At last he headed for the little temple,\nsaying first, however, \"Shan't we visit the ruin?\"\n\n\"If you like. I don't mind seeing how they keep it.\"\n\nThey reached the white steps leading up to it. He held the boat and his\ncompanion got out; then, when he had made it fast, they mounted together\nto the open door. \"They keep the place very well,\" Nick said, looking\nround. \"It's a capital place to give up everything in.\"\n\n\"It might do at least for you to explain what you mean.\" And Julia sat\ndown.\n\n\"I mean to pretend for half an hour that I don't represent the burgesses\nof Harsh. It's charming--it's very delicate work. Surely it has been\nretouched.\"\n\nThe interior of the pavilion, lighted by windows which the circle of\ncolumns was supposed outside and at a distance to conceal, had a vaulted\nceiling and was occupied by a few pieces of last-century furniture,\nspare and faded, of which the colours matched with the decoration of the\nwalls. These and the ceiling, tinted and not exempt from indications of\ndamp, were covered with fine mouldings and medallions. It all made a\nvery elegant little tea-house, the mistress of which sat on the edge of\na sofa rolling her parasol and remarking, \"You ought to read Mr.\nHoppus's article to me.\"\n\n\"Why, is _this_ your salon?\" Nick smiled.\n\n\"What makes you always talk of that? My salon's an invention of your\nown.\"\n\n\"But isn't it the idea you're most working for?\"\n\nSuddenly, nervously, she put up her parasol and sat under it as if not\nquite sensible of what she was doing. \"How much you know me! I'm not\n'working' for anything--that you'll ever guess.\"\n\nNick wandered about the room and looked at various things it\ncontained--the odd volumes on the tables, the bits of quaint china on\nthe shelves. \"They do keep it very well. You've got charming things.\"\n\n\"They're supposed to come over every day and look after them.\"\n\n\"They must come over in force.\"\n\n\"Oh no one knows.\"\n\n\"It's spick and span. How well you have everything done!\"\n\n\"I think you've some reason to say so,\" said Mrs. Dallow. Her parasol\nwas now down and she was again rolling it tight.\n\n\"But you're right about my not knowing you. Why were you so ready to do\nso much for me?\"\n\nHe stopped in front of her and she looked up at him. Her eyes rested\nlong on his own; then she broke out: \"Why do you hate me so?\"\n\n\"Was it because you like me personally?\" Nick pursued as if he hadn't\nheard her. \"You may think that an odd or positively an odious question;\nbut isn't it natural, my wanting to know?\"\n\n\"Oh if you don't know!\" Julia quite desperately sighed.\n\n\"It's a question of being sure.\"\n\n\"Well then if you're not sure----!\"\n\n\"Was it done for me as a friend, as a man?\"\n\n\"You're not a man--you're a child,\" his hostess declared with a face\nthat was cold, though she had been smiling the moment before.\n\n\"After all I was a good candidate,\" Nick went on.\n\n\"What do I care for candidates?\"\n\n\"You're the most delightful woman, Julia,\" he said as he sat down beside\nher, \"and I can't imagine what you mean by my hating you.\"\n\n\"If you haven't discovered that I like you, you might as well.\"\n\n\"Might as well discover it?\"\n\nShe was grave--he had never seen her so pale and never so beautiful. She\nhad stopped rolling her parasol; her hands were folded in her lap and\nher eyes bent on them. Nick sat looking at them as well--a trifle\nawkwardly. \"Might as well have hated me,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got on so beautifully together all these days: why shouldn't we\nget on as well for ever and ever?\" he brought out. She made no answer,\nand suddenly he said: \"Ah Julia, I don't know what you've done to me,\nbut you've done it. You've done it by strange ways, but it will serve.\nYes, I hate you,\" he added in a different tone and with his face all\nnearer.\n\n\"Dear Nick, dear Nick----!\" she began. But she stopped, feeling his\nnearness and its intensity, a nearness now so great that his arm was\nround her, that he was really in possession of her. She closed her eyes\nbut heard him ask again, \"Why shouldn't it be for ever, for ever?\" in a\nvoice that had for her ear a vibration none had ever had.\n\n\"You've done it, you've done it,\" Nick repeated.\n\n\"What do you want of me?\" she appealed.\n\n\"To stay with me--this way--always.\"\n\n\"Ah not this way,\" she answered softly, but as if in pain and making an\neffort, with a certain force, to detach herself.\n\n\"This way then--or this!\" He took such pressing advantage of her that he\nhad kissed her with repetition. She rose while he insisted, but he held\nher yet, and as he did so his tenderness turned to beautiful words. \"If\nyou'll marry me, why shouldn't it be so simple, so right and good?\" He\ndrew her closer again, too close for her to answer. But her struggle\nceased and she rested on him a minute; she buried her face in his\nbreast.\n\n\"You're hard, and it's cruel!\" she then exclaimed, shaking herself free.\n\n\"Hard--cruel?\"\n\n\"You do it with so little!\" And with this, unexpectedly to Nick, Julia\nburst straight into tears. Before he could stop her she was at the door\nof the pavilion as if she wished to get immediately away. There,\nhowever, he stayed her, bending over her while she sobbed, unspeakably\ngentle with her.\n\n\"So little? It's with everything--with everything I have.\"\n\n\"I've done it, you say? What do you accuse me of doing?\" Her tears were\nalready over.\n\n\"Of making me yours; of being so precious, Julia, so exactly what a man\nwants, as it seems to me. I didn't know you could,\" he went on, smiling\ndown at her. \"I didn't--no, I didn't.\"\n\n\"It's what I say--that you've always hated me.\"\n\n\"I'll make it up to you!\" he laughed.\n\nShe leaned on the doorway with her forehead against the lintel. \"You\ndon't even deny it.\"\n\n\"Contradict you _now_? I'll admit it, though it's rubbish, on purpose to\nlive it down.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she said slowly; \"for however much you might have\nliked me you'd never have done so half as much as I've cared for you.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm so poor!\" Nick murmured cheerfully.\n\nWith her eyes looking at him as in a new light she slowly shook her\nhead. Then she declared: \"You never can live it down.\"\n\n\"I like that! Haven't I asked you to marry me? When did you ever ask\nme?\"\n\n\"Every day of my life! As I say, it's hard--for a proud woman.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're too proud even to answer me.\"\n\n\"We must think of it, we must talk of it.\"\n\n\"Think of it? I've thought of it ever so much.\"\n\n\"I mean together. There are many things in such a question.\"\n\n\"The principal thing is beautifully to give me your word.\"\n\nShe looked at him afresh all strangely; then she threw off: \"I wish I\ndidn't adore you!\" She went straight down the steps.\n\n\"You don't adore me at all, you know, if you leave me now. Why do you\ngo? It's so charming here and we're so delightfully alone.\"\n\n\"Untie the boat; we'll go on the water,\" Julia said.\n\nNick was at the top of the steps, looking down at her. \"Ah stay a\nlittle--_do_ stay!\" he pleaded.\n\n\"I'll get in myself, I'll pull off,\" she simply answered.\n\nAt this he came down and bent a little to undo the rope. He was close to\nher and as he raised his head he felt it caught; she had seized it in\nher hands and she pressed her lips, as he had never felt lips pressed,\nto the first place they encountered. The next instant she was in the\nboat.\n\nThis time he dipped the oars very slowly indeed; and, while for a period\nthat was longer than it seemed to them they floated vaguely, they mainly\nsat and glowed at each other as if everything had been settled. There\nwere reasons enough why Nick should be happy; but it is a singular fact\nthat the leading one was the sense of his having escaped a great and\nugly mistake. The final result of his mother's appeal to him the day\nbefore had been the idea that he must act with unimpeachable honour. He\nwas capable of taking it as an assurance that Julia had placed him under\nan obligation a gentleman could regard but in one way. If she herself\nhad understood it so, putting the vision, or at any rate the\nappreciation, of a closer tie into everything she had done for him, the\ncase was conspicuously simple and his course unmistakably plain. That is\nwhy he had been gay when he came out of the house to look for her: he\ncould be gay when his course was plain. He could be all the gayer,\nnaturally, I must add, that, in turning things over as he had done half\nthe night, what he had turned up oftenest was the recognition that Julia\nnow had a new personal power with him. It was not for nothing that she\nhad thrown herself personally into his life. She had by her act made him\nlive twice as intensely, and such an office, such a service, if a man\nhad accepted and deeply tasted it, was certainly a thing to put him on\nhis honour. He took it as distinct that there was nothing he could do in\npreference that wouldn't be spoiled for him by any deflexion from that\npoint. His mother had made him uncomfortable by bringing it so heavily\nup that Julia was in love with him--he didn't like in general to be told\nsuch things; but the responsibility seemed easier to carry and he was\nless shy about it when once he was away from other eyes, with only\nJulia's own to express that truth and with indifferent nature all\nabout. Besides, what discovery had he made this morning but that he also\nwas in love?\n\n\"You've got to be a very great man, you know,\" she said to him in the\nmiddle of the lake. \"I don't know what you mean about my salon, but I\n_am_ ambitious.\"\n\n\"We must look at life in a large, bold way,\" he concurred while he\nrested his oars.\n\n\"That's what I mean. If I didn't think you could I wouldn't look at\nyou.\"\n\n\"I could what?\"\n\n\"Do everything you ought--everything I imagine, I dream of. You _are_\nclever: you can never make me believe the contrary after your speech on\nTuesday, Don't speak to me! I've seen, I've heard, and I know what's in\nyou. I shall hold you to it. You're everything you pretend not to be.\"\n\nNick looked at the water while she talked. \"Will it always be so\namusing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Will what always be?\"\n\n\"Why my career.\"\n\n\"Shan't I make it so?\"\n\n\"Then it will be yours--it won't be mine,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Ah don't say that--don't make me out that sort of woman! If they should\nsay it's me I'd drown myself.\"\n\n\"If they should say what's you?\"\n\n\"Why your getting on. If they should say I push you and do things for\nyou. Things I mean that you can't do yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, won't you do them? It's just what I count on.\"\n\n\"Don't be dreadful,\" Julia said. \"It would be loathsome if I were\nthought the cleverest. That's not the sort of man I want to marry.\"\n\n\"Oh I shall make you work, my dear!\"\n\n\"Ah _that_----!\" she sounded in a tone that might come back to a man\nafter years.\n\n\"You'll do the great thing, you'll make my life the best life,\" Nick\nbrought out as if he had been touched to deep conviction. \"I daresay\nthat will keep me in heart.\"\n\n\"In heart? Why shouldn't you be in heart?\" And her eyes, lingering on\nhim, searching him, seemed to question him still more than her lips.\n\n\"Oh it will be all right!\" he made answer.\n\n\"You'll like success as well as any one else. Don't tell me--you're not\nso ethereal!\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall like success.\"\n\n\"So shall I! And of course I'm glad you'll now be able to do things,\"\nJulia went on. \"I'm glad you'll have things. I'm glad I'm not poor.\"\n\n\"Ah don't speak of that,\" Nick murmured. \"Only be nice to my mother. We\nshall make her supremely happy.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be for your mother I'd do it--yet I'm glad I like your\npeople,\" Mrs. Dallow rectified. \"Leave them to me!\"\n\n\"You're generous--you're noble,\" he stammered.\n\n\"Your mother must live at Broadwood; she must have it for life. It's not\nat all bad.\"\n\n\"Ah Julia,\" her companion replied, \"it's well I love you!\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you?\" she laughed; and after this no more was said\nbetween them till the boat touched shore. When she had got out she\nrecalled that it was time for luncheon; but they took no action in\nconsequence, strolling in a direction which was not that of the house.\nThere was a vista that drew them on, a grassy path skirting the\nfoundations of scattered beeches and leading to a stile from which the\ncharmed wanderer might drop into another division of Mrs. Dallow's\nproperty. She said something about their going as far as the stile, then\nthe next instant exclaimed: \"How stupid of you--you've forgotten Mr.\nHoppus!\"\n\nNick wondered. \"We left him in the temple of Vesta. Darling, I had other\nthings to think of there.\"\n\n\"I'll send for him,\" said Julia.\n\n\"Lord, can you think of him now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course I can--more than ever.\"\n\n\"Shall we go back for him?\"--and he pulled up.\n\nShe made no direct answer, but continued to walk, saying they would go\nas far as the stile. \"Of course I know you're fearfully vague,\" she\npresently resumed.\n\n\"I wasn't vague at all. But you were in such a hurry to get away.\"\n\n\"It doesn't signify. I've another at home.\"\n\n\"Another summer-house?\" he more lightly suggested.\n\n\"A copy of Mr. Hoppus.\"\n\n\"Mercy, how you go in for him! Fancy having two!\"\n\n\"He sent me the number of the magazine, and the other's the one that\ncomes every month.\"\n\n\"Every month; I see\"--but his manner justified considerably her charge\nof vagueness. They had reached the stile and he leaned over it, looking\nat a great mild meadow and at the browsing beasts in the distance.\n\n\"Did you suppose they come every day?\" Julia went on.\n\n\"Dear no, thank God!\" They remained there a little; he continued to look\nat the animals and before long added: \"Delightful English pastoral\nscene. Why do they say it won't paint?\"\n\n\"Who says it won't?\"\n\n\"I don't know--some of them. It will in France; but somehow it won't\nhere.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Mrs. Dallow demanded.\n\nHe appeared unable to satisfy her on this point; instead of answering\nher directly he at any rate said: \"Is Broadwood very charming?\"\n\n\"Have you never been there? It shows how you've treated me. We used to\ngo there in August. George had ideas about it,\" she added. She had never\naffected not to speak of her late husband, especially with Nick, whose\nkinsman he had in a manner been and who had liked him better than some\nothers did.\n\n\"George had ideas about a great many things.\"\n\nYet she appeared conscious it would be rather odd on such an occasion to\ntake this up. It was even odd in Nick to have said it. \"Broadwood's just\nright,\" she returned at last. \"It's neither too small nor too big, and\nit takes care of itself. There's nothing to be done: you can't spend a\npenny.\"\n\n\"And don't you want to use it?\"\n\n\"We can go and stay with _them_,\" said Julia.\n\n\"They'll think I bring them an angel.\" And Nick covered her white hand,\nwhich was resting on the stile, with his own large one.\n\n\"As they regard you yourself as an angel they'll take it as natural of\nyou to associate with your kind.\"\n\n\"Oh _my_ kind!\" he quite wailed, looking at the cows.\n\nBut his very extravagance perhaps saved it, and she turned away from him\nas if starting homeward, while he began to retrace his steps with her.\nSuddenly she said: \"What did you mean that night in Paris?\"\n\n\"That night----?\"\n\n\"When you came to the hotel with me after we had all dined at that place\nwith Peter.\"\n\n\"What did I mean----?\"\n\n\"About your caring so much for the fine arts. You seemed to want to\nfrighten me.\"\n\n\"Why should you have been frightened? I can't imagine what I had in my\nhead: not now.\"\n\n\"You _are_ vague,\" said Julia with a little flush.\n\n\"Not about the great thing.\"\n\n\"The great thing?\"\n\n\"That I owe you everything an honest man has to offer. How can I care\nabout the fine arts now?\"\n\nShe stopped with lighted eyes on him. \"Is it because you think you _owe_\nit--\" and she paused, still with the heightened colour in her cheek,\nthen went on--\"that you've spoken to me as you did there?\" She tossed\nher head toward the lake.\n\n\"I think I spoke to you because I couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"You _are_ vague!\" And she walked on again.\n\n\"You affect me differently from any other woman.\"\n\n\"Oh other women----! Why shouldn't you care about the fine arts now?\"\nshe added.\n\n\"There'll be no time. All my days and my years will be none too much for\nwhat you expect of me.\"\n\n\"I don't expect you to give up anything. I only expect you to do more.\"\n\n\"To do more I must do less. I've no talent.\"\n\n\"No talent?\"\n\n\"I mean for painting.\"\n\nJulia pulled up again. \"That's odious! You _have_--you must.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing. \"You're altogether delightful. But how little you\nknow about it--about the honourable practice of any art!\"\n\n\"What do you call practice? You'll have all our things--you'll live in\nthe midst of them.\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall enjoy looking at them, being so near them.\"\n\n\"Don't say I've taken you away then.\"\n\n\"Taken me away----?\"\n\n\"From the love of art. I like them myself now, poor George's treasures.\nI didn't of old so much, because it seemed to me he made too much of\nthem--he was always talking.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't always talk,\" said Nick.\n\n\"You may do as you like--they're yours.\"\n\n\"Give them to the nation,\" Nick went on.\n\n\"I like that! When we've done with them.\"\n\n\"We shall have done with them when your Vandykes and Moronis have cured\nme of the delusion that I may be of _their_ family. Surely that won't\ntake long.\"\n\n\"You shall paint _me_,\" said Julia.\n\n\"Never, never, never!\" He spoke in a tone that made his companion\nstare--then seemed slightly embarrassed at this result of his emphasis.\nTo relieve himself he said, as they had come back to the place beside\nthe lake where the boat was moored, \"Shan't we really go and fetch Mr.\nHoppus?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"You may go; I won't, please.\"\n\n\"That's not what I want.\"\n\n\"Oblige me by going. I'll wait here.\" With which she sat down on the\nbench attached to the little landing.\n\nNick, at this, got into the boat and put off; he smiled at her as she\nsat there watching him. He made his short journey, disembarked and went\ninto the pavilion; but when he came out with the object of his errand he\nsaw she had quitted her station, had returned to the house without him.\nHe rowed back quickly, sprang ashore and followed her with long steps.\nApparently she had gone fast; she had almost reached the door when he\novertook her.\n\n\"Why did you basely desert me?\" he asked, tenderly stopping her there.\n\n\"I don't know. Because I'm so happy.\"\n\n\"May I tell mother then?\"\n\n\"You may tell her she shall have Broadwood.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nHe lost no time in going down to see Mr. Carteret, to whom he had\nwritten immediately after the election and who had answered him in\ntwelve revised pages of historical parallel. He used often to envy Mr.\nCarteret's leisure, a sense of which came to him now afresh, in the\nsummer evening, as he walked up the hill toward the quiet house where\nenjoyment had ever been mingled for him with a vague oppression. He was\na little boy again, under Mr. Carteret's roof--a little boy on whom it\nhad been duly impressed that in the wide, plain, peaceful rooms he was\nnot to \"touch.\" When he paid a visit to his father's old friend there\nwere in fact many things--many topics--from which he instinctively kept\nhis hands. Even Mr. Chayter, the immemorial blank butler, who was so\nlike his master that he might have been a twin brother, helped to remind\nhim that he must be good. Mr. Carteret seemed to Nick a very grave\nperson, but he had the sense that Chayter thought him rather frivolous.\n\nOur young man always came on foot from the station, leaving his\nportmanteau to be carried: the direct way was steep and he liked the\nslow approach, which gave him a chance to look about the place and smell\nthe new-mown hay. At this season the air was full of it--the fields were\nso near that it was in the clean, still streets. Nick would never have\nthought of rattling up to Mr. Carteret's door, which had on an old\nbrass plate the proprietor's name, as if he had been the principal\nsurgeon. The house was in the high part, and the neat roofs of other\nhouses, lower down the hill, made an immediate prospect for it, scarcely\ncounting, however, since the green country was just below these,\nfamiliar and interpenetrating, in the shape of small but thick-tufted\ngardens. Free garden-growths flourished in all the intervals, but the\nonly disorder of the place was that there were sometimes oats on the\npavements. A crooked lane, with postern doors and cobble-stones, opened\nnear Mr. Carteret's house and wandered toward the old abbey; for the\nabbey was the secondary fact of Beauclere--it came after Mr. Carteret.\nMr. Carteret sometimes went away and the abbey never did; yet somehow\nwhat was most of the essence of the place was that it could boast of the\nresident in the squarest of the square red houses, the one with the\nfinest of the arched hall-windows, in three divisions, over the widest\nof the last-century doorways. You saw the great church from the\ndoorstep, beyond gardens of course, and in the stillness you could hear\nthe flutter of the birds that circled round its huge short towers. The\ntowers had been finished only as time finishes things, by lending\nassurances to their lapses. There is something right in old monuments\nthat have been wrong for centuries: some such moral as that was usually\nin Nick's mind as an emanation of Beauclere when he saw the grand line\nof the roof ride the sky and draw out its length.\n\nWhen the door with the brass plate was opened and Mr. Chayter appeared\nin the middle distance--he always advanced just to the same spot, as a\nprime minister receives an ambassador--Nick felt anew that he would be\nwonderfully like Mr. Carteret if he had had an expression. He denied\nhimself this freedom, never giving a sign of recognition, often as the\nyoung man had been at the house. He was most attentive to the visitor's\nwants, but apparently feared that if he allowed a familiarity it might\ngo too far. There was always the same question to be asked--had Mr.\nCarteret finished his nap? He usually had not finished it, and this left\nNick what he liked--time to smoke a cigarette in the garden or even to\ntake before dinner a turn about the place. He observed now, every time\nhe came, that Mr. Carteret's nap lasted a little longer. There was each\nyear a little more strength to be gathered for the ceremony of dinner:\nthis was the principal symptom--almost the only one--that the\nclear-cheeked old gentleman gave of not being so fresh as of yore. He\nwas still wonderful for his age. To-day he was particularly careful:\nChayter went so far as to mention to Nick that four gentlemen were\nexpected to dinner--an exuberance perhaps partly explained by the\ncircumstance that Lord Bottomley was one of them.\n\nThe prospect of Lord Bottomley was somehow not stirring; it only made\nthe young man say to himself with a quick, thin sigh, \"This time I _am_\nin for it!\" And he immediately had the unpolitical sense again that\nthere was nothing so pleasant as the way the quiet bachelor house had\nits best rooms on the big garden, which seemed to advance into them\nthrough their wide windows and ruralise their dulness.\n\n\"I expect it will be a lateish eight, sir,\" said Mr. Chayter,\nsuperintending in the library the production of tea on a large scale.\nEverything at Mr. Carteret's seemed to Nick on a larger scale than\nanywhere else--the tea-cups, the knives and forks, the door-handles, the\nchair-backs, the legs of mutton, the candles, and the lumps of coal:\nthey represented and apparently exhausted the master's sense of pleasing\neffect, for the house was not otherwise decorated. Nick thought it\nreally hideous, but he was capable at any time of extracting a degree of\namusement from anything strongly characteristic, and Mr. Carteret's\ninterior expressed a whole view of life. Our young man was generous\nenough to find in it a hundred instructive intimations even while it\ncame over him--as it always did at Beauclere--that this was the view he\nhimself was expected to take. Nowhere were the boiled eggs at breakfast\nso big or in such big receptacles; his own shoes, arranged in his room,\nlooked to him vaster there than at home. He went out into the garden and\nremembered what enormous strawberries they should have for dinner. In\nthe house was a great deal of Landseer, of oilcloth, of woodwork painted\nand \"grained.\"\n\nFinding there would be time before the evening meal or before Mr.\nCarteret was likely to see him he quitted the house and took a stroll\ntoward the abbey. It covered acres of ground on the summit of the hill,\nand there were aspects in which its vast bulk reminded him of the ark\nleft high and dry upon Ararat. It was the image at least of a great\nwreck, of the indestructible vessel of a faith, washed up there by a\nstorm centuries before. The injury of time added to this appearance--the\ninfirmities round which, as he knew, the battle of restoration had begun\nto be fought. The cry had been raised to save the splendid pile, and the\ncounter-cry by the purists, the sentimentalists, whatever they were, to\nsave it from being saved. They were all exchanging compliments in the\nmorning papers.\n\nNick sauntered about the church--it took a good while; he leaned against\nlow things and looked up at it while he smoked another cigarette. It\nstruck him as a great pity such a pile should be touched: so much of the\npast was buried there that it was like desecrating, like digging up a\ngrave. Since the years were letting it down so gently why jostle the\nelbow of slow-fingering time? The fading afternoon was exquisitely pure;\nthe place was empty; he heard nothing but the cries of several children,\nwhich sounded sweet, who were playing on the flatness of the very old\ntombs. He knew this would inevitably be one of the topics at dinner, the\nrestoration of the abbey; it would give rise to a considerable deal of\norderly debate. Lord Bottomley, oddly enough, would probably oppose the\nexpensive project, but on grounds that would be characteristic of him\neven if the attitude were not. Nick's nerves always knew on this spot\nwhat it was to be soothed; but he shifted his position with a slight\nimpatience as the vision came over him of Lord Bottomley's treating a\nquestion of esthetics. It was enough to make one want to take the other\nside, the idea of having the same taste as his lordship: one would have\nit for such different reasons.\n\nDear Mr. Carteret would be deliberate and fair all round and would, like\nhis noble friend, exhibit much more architectural knowledge than he,\nNick, possessed: which would not make it a whit less droll to our young\nman that an artistic idea, so little really assimilated, should be\nbroached at that table and in that air. It would remain so outside of\ntheir minds and their minds would remain so outside of it. It would be\ndropped at last, however, after half an hour's gentle worrying, and the\nconversation would incline itself to public affairs. Mr. Carteret would\nfind his natural level--the production of anecdote in regard to the\nformation of early ministries. He knew more than any one else about the\npersonages of whom certain cabinets would have consisted if they had not\nconsisted of others. His favourite exercise was to illustrate how\ndifferent everything might have been from what it was, and how the\nreason of the difference had always been somebody's inability to \"see\nhis way\" to accept the view of somebody else--a view usually at the time\ndiscussed in strict confidence with Mr. Carteret, who surrounded his\nactual violation of that confidence thirty years later with many\nprecautions against scandal. In this retrospective vein, at the head of\nhis table, the old gentleman enjoyed a hearing, or at any rate commanded\na silence, often intense. Every one left it to some one else to ask\nanother question; and when by chance some one else did so every one was\nstruck with admiration at any one's being able to say anything. Nick\nknew the moment when he himself would take a glass of a particular port\nand, surreptitiously looking at his watch, perceive it was ten o'clock.\nThat timepiece might as well mark 1830.\n\nAll this would be a part of the suggestion of leisure that invariably\ndescended upon him at Beauclere--the image of a sloping shore where the\ntide of time broke with a ripple too faint to be a warning. But there\nwas another admonition almost equally sure to descend upon his spirit\nduring a stroll in a summer hour about the grand abbey; to sink into it\nas the light lingered on the rough red walls and the local accent of the\nchildren sounded soft in the churchyard. It was simply the sense of\nEngland--a sort of apprehended revelation of his country. The dim annals\nof the place were sensibly, heavily in the air--foundations bafflingly\nearly, a great monastic life, wars of the Roses, with battles and blood\nin the streets, and then the long quietude of the respectable centuries,\nall corn-fields and magistrates and vicars--and these things were\nconnected with an emotion that arose from the green country, the rich\nland so infinitely lived in, and laid on him a hand that was too ghostly\nto press and yet somehow too urgent to be light. It produced a throb he\ncouldn't have spoken of, it was so deep, and that was half imagination\nand half responsibility. These impressions melted together and made a\ngeneral appeal, of which, with his new honours as a legislator, he was\nthe sentient subject. If he had a love for that particular scene of life\nmightn't it have a love for him and expect something of him? What fate\ncould be so high as to grow old in a national affection? What a fine\nsort of reciprocity, making mere soreness of all the balms of\nindifference!\n\nThe great church was still open and he turned into it and wandered a\nlittle in the twilight that had gathered earlier there. The whole\nstructure, with its immensity of height and distance, seemed to rest on\ntremendous facts--facts of achievement and endurance--and the huge\nNorman pillars to loom through the dimness like the ghosts of heroes.\nNick was more struck with its thick earthly than with its fine spiritual\nreference, and he felt the oppression of his conscience as he walked\nslowly about. It was in his mind that nothing in life was really clear,\nall things were mingled and charged, and that patriotism might be an\nuplifting passion even if it had to allow for Lord Bottomley and for Mr.\nCarteret's blindness on certain sides. He presently noticed that\nhalf-past seven was about to strike, and as he went back to his old\nfriend's he couldn't have said if he walked in gladness or in gloom.\n\n\"Mr. Carteret will be in the drawing-room at a quarter to eight, sir,\"\nChayter mentioned, and Nick as he went to dress asked himself what was\nthe use of being a member of Parliament if one was still sensitive to an\nintimation on the part of such a functionary that one ought already to\nhave begun that business. Chayter's words but meant that Mr. Carteret\nwould expect to have a little comfortable conversation with him before\ndinner. Nick's usual rapidity in dressing was, however, quite adequate\nto the occasion, so that his host had not appeared when he went down.\nThere were flowers in the unfeminine saloon, which contained several\npaintings in addition to the engravings of pictures of animals; but\nnothing could prevent its reminding Nick of a comfortable\ncommittee-room.\n\nMr. Carteret presently came in with his gold-headed stick, a laugh like\na series of little warning coughs and the air of embarrassment that our\nyoung man always perceived in him at first. He was almost eighty but was\nstill shy--he laughed a great deal, faintly and vaguely, at nothing, as\nif to make up for the seriousness with which he took some jokes. He\nalways began by looking away from his interlocutor, and it was only\nlittle by little that his eyes came round; after which their limpid and\nbenevolent blue made you wonder why they should ever be circumspect. He\nwas clean-shaven and had a long upper lip. When he had seated himself he\ntalked of \"majorities\" and showed a disposition to converse on the\ngeneral subject of the fluctuation of Liberal gains. He had an\nextraordinary memory for facts of this sort, and could mention the\nfigures relating to the returns from innumerable places in particular\nyears. To many of these facts he attached great importance, in his\nsimple, kindly, presupposing way; correcting himself five minutes later\nif he had said that in 1857 some one had had 6014 instead of 6004.\n\nNick always felt a great hypocrite as he listened to him, in spite of\nthe old man's courtesy--a thing so charming in itself that it would have\nbeen grossness to speak of him as a bore. The difficulty was that he\ntook for granted all kinds of positive assent, and Nick, in such\ncompany, found himself steeped in an element of tacit pledges which\nconstituted the very medium of intercourse and yet made him draw his\nbreath a little in pain when for a moment he measured them. There would\nhave been no hypocrisy at all if he could have regarded Mr. Carteret as\na mere sweet spectacle, the last or almost the last illustration of a\ndeparting tradition of manners. But he represented something more than\nmanners; he represented what he believed to be morals and ideas, ideas\nas regards which he took your personal deference--not discovering how\nnatural that was--for participation. Nick liked to think that his\nfather, though ten years younger, had found it congruous to make his\nbest friend of the owner of so nice a nature: it gave a softness to his\nfeeling for that memory to be reminded that Sir Nicholas had been of the\nsame general type--a type so pure, so disinterested, so concerned for\nthe public good. Just so it endeared Mr. Carteret to him to perceive\nthat he considered his father had done a definite work, prematurely\ninterrupted, which had been an absolute benefit to the people of\nEngland. The oddity was, however, that though both Mr. Carteret's aspect\nand his appreciation were still so fresh this relation of his to his\nlate distinguished friend made the latter appear to Nick even more\nirrecoverably dead. The good old man had almost a vocabulary of his own,\nmade up of old-fashioned political phrases and quite untainted with the\nnew terms, mostly borrowed from America; indeed his language and his\ntone made those of almost any one who might be talking with him sound by\ncontrast rather American. He was, at least nowadays, never severe nor\ndenunciatory; but sometimes in telling an anecdote he dropped such an\nexpression as \"the rascal said to me\" or such an epithet as \"the vulgar\ndog.\"\n\nNick was always struck with the rare simplicity--it came out in his\ncountenance--of one who had lived so long and seen so much of affairs\nthat draw forth the passions and perversities of men. It often made him\nsay to himself that Mr. Carteret must have had many odd parts to have\nbeen able to achieve with his means so many things requiring cleverness.\nIt was as if experience, though coming to him in abundance, had dealt\nwith him so clean-handedly as to leave no stain, and had moreover never\nprovoked him to any general reflexion. He had never proceeded in any\nironic way from the particular to the general; certainly he had never\nmade a reflexion upon anything so unparliamentary as Life. He would have\nquestioned the taste of such an extravagance and if he had encountered\nit on the part of another have regarded it as an imported foreign toy\nwith the uses of which he was unacquainted. Life, for him, was a purely\npractical function, not a question of more or less showy phrasing. It\nmust be added that he had to Nick's perception his variations--his back\nwindows opening into grounds more private. That was visible from the way\nhis eye grew cold and his whole polite face rather austere when he\nlistened to something he didn't agree with or perhaps even understand;\nas if his modesty didn't in strictness forbid the suspicion that a thing\nhe didn't understand would have a probability against it. At such times\nthere was something rather deadly in the silence in which he simply\nwaited with a lapse in his face, not helping his interlocutor out. Nick\nwould have been very sorry to attempt to communicate to him a matter he\nwouldn't be likely to understand. This cut off of course a multitude of\nsubjects.\n\nThe evening passed exactly as he had foreseen, even to the markedly\nprompt dispersal of the guests, two of whom were \"local\" men, earnest\nand distinct, though not particularly distinguished. The third was a\nyoung, slim, uninitiated gentleman whom Lord Bottomley brought with him\nand concerning whom Nick was informed beforehand that he was engaged to\nbe married to the Honourable Jane, his lordship's second daughter. There\nwere recurrent allusions to Nick's victory, as to which he had the fear\nthat he might appear to exhibit less interest in it than the company\ndid. He took energetic precautions against this and felt repeatedly a\nlittle spent with them, for the subject always came up once more. Yet it\nwas not as his but as theirs that they liked the triumph. Mr. Carteret\ntook leave of him for the night directly after the other guests had\ngone, using at this moment the words he had often used before:\n\n\"You may sit up to any hour you like. I only ask that you don't read in\nbed.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nNick's little visit was to terminate immediately after luncheon the\nfollowing day: much as the old man enjoyed his being there he wouldn't\nhave dreamed of asking for more of his time now that it had such great\npublic uses. He liked infinitely better that his young friend should be\noccupied with parliamentary work than only occupied in talking it over\nwith him. Talking it over, however, was the next best thing, as on the\nmorrow, after breakfast, Mr. Carteret showed Nick he considered. They\nsat in the garden, the morning being warm, and the old man had a table\nbeside him covered with the letters and newspapers the post had poured\nforth. He was proud of his correspondence, which was altogether on\npublic affairs, and proud in a manner of the fact that he now dictated\nalmost everything. That had more in it of the statesman in retirement, a\ncharacter indeed not consciously assumed by Mr. Carteret, but always\ntacitly attributed to him by Nick, who took it rather from the pictorial\npoint of view--remembering on each occasion only afterwards that though\nhe was in retirement he had not exactly been a statesman. A young man, a\nvery sharp, handy young man, came every morning at ten o'clock and wrote\nfor him till luncheon. The young man had a holiday to-day in honour of\nNick's visit--a fact the mention of which led Nick to make some not\nparticularly sincere speech about _his_ being ready to write anything\nif Mr. Carteret were at all pressed.\n\n\"Ah but your own budget--what will become of that?\" the old gentleman\nobjected, glancing at Nick's pockets as if rather surprised not to see\nthem stuffed out with documents in split envelopes. His visitor had to\nconfess that he had not directed his letters to meet him at Beauclere:\nhe should find them in town that afternoon. This led to a little homily\nfrom Mr. Carteret which made him feel quite guilty; there was such an\nimplication of neglected duty in the way the old man said, \"You won't do\nthem justice--you won't do them justice.\" He talked for ten minutes, in\nhis rich, simple, urbane way, about the fatal consequences of getting\nbehind. It was his favourite doctrine that one should always be a little\nbefore, and his own eminently regular respiration seemed to illustrate\nthe idea. A man was certainly before who had so much in his rear.\n\nThis led to the bestowal of a good deal of general advice on the\nmistakes to avoid at the beginning of a parliamentary career--as to\nwhich Mr. Carteret spoke with the experience of one who had sat for\nfifty years in the House of Commons. Nick was amused, but also mystified\nand even a little irritated, by his talk: it was founded on the idea of\nobservation and yet our young man couldn't at all regard him as an\nobserver. \"He doesn't observe _me_,\" he said to himself; \"if he did he\nwould see, he wouldn't think----!\" The end of this private cogitation\nwas a vague impatience of all the things his venerable host took for\ngranted. He didn't see any of the things Nick saw. Some of these latter\nwere the light touches the summer morning scattered through the sweet\nold garden. The time passed there a good deal as if it were sitting\nstill with a plaid under its feet while Mr. Carteret distilled a little\nmore of the wisdom he had laid up in his fifty years. This immense term\nhad something fabulous and monstrous for Nick, who wondered whether it\nwere the sort of thing his companion supposed _he_ had gone in for. It\nwas not strange Mr. Carteret should be different; he might originally\nhave been more--well, to himself Nick was not obliged to phrase it: what\nour young man meant was more of what it was perceptible to him that his\nold friend was not. Should even he, Nick, be like that at the end of\nfifty years? What Mr. Carteret was so good as to expect for him was that\nhe should be much more distinguished; and wouldn't this exactly mean\nmuch more like that? Of course Nick heard some things he had heard\nbefore; as for instance the circumstances that had originally led the\nold man to settle at Beauclere. He had been returned for that\nborough--it was his second seat--in years far remote, and had come to\nlive there because he then had a conscientious conviction, modified\nindeed by later experience, that a member should be constantly resident.\nHe spoke of this now, smiling rosily, as he might have spoken of some\nwild aberration of his youth; yet he called Nick's attention to the fact\nthat he still so far clung to his conviction as to hold--though of what\nmight be urged on the other side he was perfectly aware--that a\nrepresentative should at least be as resident as possible. This gave\nNick an opening for something that had been on and off his lips all the\nmorning.\n\n\"According to that I ought to take up my abode at Harsh.\"\n\n\"In the measure of the convenient I shouldn't be sorry to see you do\nit.\"\n\n\"It ought to be rather convenient,\" Nick largely smiled. \"I've got a\npiece of news for you which I've kept, as one keeps that sort of\nthing--for it's very good--till the last.\" He waited a little to see if\nMr. Carteret would guess, and at first thought nothing would come of\nthis. But after resting his young-looking eyes on him for a moment the\nold man said:\n\n\"I should indeed be very happy to hear that you've arranged to take a\nwife.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Dallow has been so good as to say she'll marry me,\" Nick returned.\n\n\"That's very suitable. I should think it would answer.\"\n\n\"It's very jolly,\" said Nick. It was well Mr. Carteret was not what his\nguest called observant, or he might have found a lower pitch in the\nsound of this sentence than in the sense.\n\n\"Your dear father would have liked it.\"\n\n\"So my mother says.\"\n\n\"And _she_ must be delighted.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Dallow, do you mean?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"I was thinking of your mother. But I don't exclude the charming lady. I\nremember her as a little girl. I must have seen her at Windrush. Now I\nunderstand the fine spirit with which she threw herself into your\ncanvass.\"\n\n\"It was her they elected,\" said Nick.\n\n\"I don't know,\" his host went on, \"that I've ever been an enthusiast for\npolitical women, but there's no doubt that in approaching the mass of\nelectors a graceful, affable manner, the manner of the real English\nlady, is a force not to be despised.\"\n\n\"Julia's a real English lady and at the same time a very political\nwoman,\" Nick remarked.\n\n\"Isn't it rather in the family? I remember once going to see her mother\nin town and finding the leaders of both parties sitting with her.\"\n\n\"My principal friend, of the others, is her brother Peter. I don't think\nhe troubles himself much about that sort of thing,\" said Nick.\n\n\"What does he trouble himself about?\" Mr. Carteret asked with a certain\ngravity.\n\n\"He's in the diplomatic service; he's a secretary in Paris.\"\n\n\"That may be serious,\" said the old man.\n\n\"He takes a great interest in the theatre. I suppose you'll say that may\nbe serious too,\" Nick laughed.\n\n\"Oh!\"--and Mr. Carteret looked as if he scarcely understood. Then he\ncontinued; \"Well, it can't hurt you.\"\n\n\"It can't hurt me?\"\n\n\"If Mrs. Dallow takes an interest in your interests.\"\n\n\"When a man's in my situation he feels as if nothing could hurt him.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad you're happy,\" said Mr. Carteret. He rested his mild eyes\non our young man, who had a sense of seeing in them for a moment the\nfaint ghost of an old story, the last strange flicker, as from cold\nashes, of a flame that had become the memory of a memory. This glimmer\nof wonder and envy, the revelation of a life intensely celibate, was for\nan instant infinitely touching. Nick had harboured a theory, suggested\nby a vague allusion from his father, who had been discreet, that their\nbenevolent friend had had in his youth an unhappy love-affair which had\nled him to forswear for ever the commerce of woman. What remained in him\nof conscious renunciation gave a throb as he looked at his bright\ncompanion, who proposed to take the matter so much the other way. \"It's\ngood to marry and I think it's right. I've not done right, I know that.\nIf she's a good woman it's the best thing,\" Mr. Carteret went on. \"It's\nwhat I've been hoping for you. Sometimes I've thought of speaking to\nyou.\"\n\n\"She's a very good woman,\" said Nick.\n\n\"And I hope she's not poor.\" Mr. Carteret spoke exactly with the same\nblandness.\n\n\"No indeed, she's rich. Her husband, whom I knew and liked, left her a\nlarge fortune.\"\n\n\"And on what terms does she enjoy it?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" said Nick.\n\nMr. Carteret considered. \"I see. It doesn't concern you. It needn't\nconcern you,\" he added in a moment.\n\nNick thought of his mother at this, but he returned: \"I daresay she can\ndo what she likes with her money.\"\n\n\"So can I, my dear young friend,\" said Mr. Carteret.\n\nNick tried not to look conscious, for he felt a significance in the old\nman's face. He turned his own everywhere but toward it, thinking again\nof his mother. \"That must be very pleasant, if one has any.\"\n\n\"I wish you had a little more.\"\n\n\"I don't particularly care,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Your marriage will assist you; you can't help that,\" Mr. Carteret\ndeclared. \"But I should like you to be under obligations not quite so\nheavy.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm so obliged to her for caring for me----!\"\n\n\"That the rest doesn't count? Certainly it's nice of her to like you.\nBut why shouldn't she? Other people do.\"\n\n\"Some of them make me feel as if I abused it,\" said Nick, looking at his\nhost. \"That is, they don't make me, but I feel it,\" he corrected.\n\n\"I've no son \"--and Mr. Carteret spoke as if his companion mightn't have\nbeen sure. \"Shan't you be very kind to her?\" he pursued. \"You'll gratify\nher ambition.\"\n\n\"Oh she thinks me cleverer than I am.\"\n\n\"That's because she's in love,\" the old gentleman hinted as if this were\nvery subtle. \"However, you must be as clever as we think you. If you\ndon't prove so----!\" And he paused with his folded hands.\n\n\"Well, if I don't?\" asked Nick.\n\n\"Oh it won't do--it won't do,\" said Mr. Carteret in a tone his companion\nwas destined to remember afterwards. \"I say I've no son,\" he continued;\n\"but if I had had one he should have risen high.\"\n\n\"It's well for me such a person doesn't exist. I shouldn't easily have\nfound a wife.\"\n\n\"He would have gone to the altar with a little money in his pocket.\"\n\n\"That would have been the least of his advantages, sir,\" Nick declared.\n\n\"When are you to be married?\" Mr. Carteret asked.\n\n\"Ah that's the question. Julia won't yet say.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man without the least flourish, \"you may consider\nthat when it comes off I'll make you a settlement.\"\n\n\"I feel your kindness more than I can express,\" Nick replied; \"but that\nwill probably be the moment when I shall be least conscious of wanting\nanything.\"\n\n\"You'll appreciate it later--you'll appreciate it very soon. I shall\nlike you to appreciate it,\" Mr. Carteret went on as if he had a just\nvision of the way a young man of a proper spirit should feel. Then he\nadded; \"Your father would have liked you to appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" Nick exclaimed vaguely, rather embarrassed, reflecting on\nthe oddity of a position in which the ground for holding up his head as\nthe husband of a rich woman would be that he had accepted a present of\nmoney from another source. It was plain he was not fated to go in for\nindependence; the most that he could treat himself to would be\ndependence that was duly grateful \"How much do you expect of me?\" he\ninquired with a grave face.\n\n\"Well, Nicholas, only what your father did. He so often spoke of you, I\nremember, at the last, just after you had been with him alone--you know\nI saw him then. He was greatly moved by his interview with you, and so\nwas I by what he told me of it. He said he should live on in you--he\nshould work in you. It has always given me a special feeling, if I may\nuse the expression, about you.\"\n\n\"The feelings are indeed not usual, dear Mr. Carteret, which take so\nmunificent a form. But you do--oh you do--expect too much,\" Nick brought\nhimself to say.\n\n\"I expect you to repay me!\" the old man returned gaily. \"As for the\nform, I have it in my mind.\"\n\n\"The form of repayment?\"\n\n\"The form of repayment!\"\n\n\"Ah don't talk of that now,\" said Nick, \"for, you see, nothing else is\nsettled. No one has been told except my mother. She has only consented\nto my telling you.\"\n\n\"Lady Agnes, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Ah no; dear mother would like to publish it on the house-tops. She's so\nglad--she wants us to have it over to-morrow. But Julia herself,\" Nick\nexplained, \"wishes to wait. Therefore kindly mention it for the present\nto no one.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, there's at this rate nothing to mention! What does Julia\nwant to wait for?\"\n\n\"Till I like her better--that's what she says.\"\n\n\"It's the way to make you like her worse,\" Mr. Carteret knowingly\ndeclared. \"Hasn't she your affection?\"\n\n\"So much so that her delay makes me exceedingly unhappy.\"\n\nMr. Carteret looked at his young friend as if he didn't strike him as\nquite wretched; but he put the question: \"Then what more does she want?\"\nNick laughed out at this, though perceiving his host hadn't meant it as\nan epigram; while the latter resumed: \"I don't understand. You're\nengaged or you're not engaged.\"\n\n\"She is, but I'm not. That's what she says about it. The trouble is she\ndoesn't believe in me.\"\n\nMr. Carteret shone with his candour. \"Doesn't she love you then?\"\n\n\"That's what I ask her. Her answer is that she loves me only too well.\nShe's so afraid of being a burden to me that she gives me my freedom\ntill I've taken another year to think.\"\n\n\"I like the way you talk about other years!\" Mr. Carteret cried. \"You\nhad better do it while I'm here to bless you.\"\n\n\"She thinks I proposed to her because she got me in for Harsh,\" said\nNick.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure it would be a very pretty return.\"\n\n\"Ah she doesn't believe in me,\" the young man repeated.\n\n\"Then I don't believe in _her_.\"\n\n\"Don't say that--don't say that. She's a very rare creature. But she's\nproud, shy, suspicious.\"\n\n\"Suspicious of what?\"\n\n\"Of everything. She thinks I'm not persistent.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"--Nick's host deprecated such freedom.\n\n\"She can't believe I shall arrive at true eminence.\"\n\n\"A good wife should believe what her husband believes,\" said Mr.\nCarteret.\n\n\"Ah unfortunately\"--and Nick took the words at a run--\"I don't believe\nit either.\"\n\nMr. Carteret, who might have been watching an odd physical rush, spoke\nwith a certain dryness. \"Your dear father did.\"\n\n\"I think of that--I think of that,\" Nick replied.\n\n\"Certainly it will help me. If I say we're engaged,\" he went on, \"it's\nbecause I consider it so. She gives me my liberty, but I don't take it.\"\n\n\"Does she expect you to take back your word?\"\n\n\"That's what I ask her. _She_ never will. Therefore we're as good as\ntied.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" said Mr. Carteret after a moment. \"I don't like\nambiguous, uncertain situations. They please me much better when they're\ndefinite and clear.\" The retreat of expression had been sounded in his\nface--the aspect it wore when he wished not to be encouraging. But after\nan instant he added in a tone more personal: \"Don't disappoint me, dear\nboy.\"\n\n\"Ah not willingly!\" his visitor protested.\n\n\"I've told you what I should like to do for you. See that the conditions\ncome about promptly in which I _may_, do it. Are you sure you do\neverything to satisfy Mrs. Dallow?\" Mr. Carteret continued.\n\n\"I think I'm very nice to her,\" Nick declared. \"But she's so ambitious.\nFrankly speaking, it's a pity for her that she likes me.\"\n\n\"She can't help that!\" the old man charmingly said.\n\n\"Possibly. But isn't it a reason for taking me as I am? What she wants\nto do is to take me as I may be a year hence.\"\n\n\"I don't understand--since you tell me that even then she won't take\nback her word,\" said Mr. Carteret.\n\n\"If she doesn't marry me I think she'll never marry again at all.\"\n\n\"What then does she gain by delay?\"\n\n\"Simply this, as I make it out,\" said Nick--\"that she'll feel she has\nbeen very magnanimous. She won't have to reproach herself with not\nhaving given me a chance to change.\"\n\n\"To change? What does she think you liable to do?\"\n\nNick had a pause. \"I don't know!\" he then said--not at all candidly.\n\n\"Everything has altered: young people in my day looked at these\nquestions more naturally,\" Mr. Carteret observed. \"A woman in love has\nno need to be magnanimous. If she plays too fair she isn't in love,\" he\nadded shrewdly.\n\n\"Oh, Julia's safe--she's safe,\" Nick smiled.\n\n\"If it were a question between you and another gentleman one might\ncomprehend. But what does it mean, between you and nothing?\"\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you, sir,\" Nick returned. \"The trouble is that she\ndoesn't know what she has got hold of.\"\n\n\"Ah, if you can't make it clear to her!\"--and his friend showed the note\nof impatience.\n\n\"I'm such a humbug,\" said the young man. And while his companion stared\nhe continued: \"I deceive people without in the least intending it.\"\n\n\"What on earth do you mean? Are you deceiving me?\"\n\n\"I don't know--it depends on what you think.\"\n\n\"I think you're flighty,\" said Mr. Carteret, with the nearest approach\nto sternness Nick had ever observed in him. \"I never thought so before.\"\n\n\"Forgive me; it's all right. I'm not frivolous; that I promise you I'm\nnot.\"\n\n\"You _have_ deceived me if you are.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" Nick stammered with a blush.\n\n\"Remember your name--carry it high.\"\n\n\"I will--as high as possible.\"\n\n\"You've no excuse. Don't tell me, after your speeches at Harsh!\" Nick\nwas on the point of declaring again that he was a humbug, so vivid was\nhis inner sense of what he thought of his factitious public utterances,\nwhich had the cursed property of creating dreadful responsibilities and\nimportunate credulities for him. If _he_ was \"clever\" (ah the idiotic\n\"clever\"!) what fools many other people were! He repressed his impulse\nand Mr. Carteret pursued. \"If, as you express it, Mrs. Dallow doesn't\nknow what she has got hold of, won't it clear the matter up a little by\ninforming her that the day before your marriage is definitely settled to\ntake place you'll come into something comfortable?\"\n\nA quick vision of what Mr. Carteret would be likely to regard as\nsomething comfortable flitted before Nick, but it didn't prevent his\nreplying: \"Oh I'm afraid that won't do any good. It would make her like\nyou better, but it wouldn't make her like me. I'm afraid she won't care\nfor any benefit that comes to me from another hand than hers. Her\naffection's a very jealous sentiment.\"\n\n\"It's a very peculiar one!\" sighed Mr. Carteret. \"Mine's a jealous\nsentiment too. However, if she takes it that way don't tell her.\"\n\n\"I'll let you know as soon as she comes round,\" said Nick.\n\n\"And you'll tell your mother,\" Mr. Carteret returned. \"I shall like\n_her_ to know.\"\n\n\"It will be delightful news to her. But she's keen enough already.\"\n\n\"I know that. I may mention now that she has written to me,\" the old man\nadded.\n\n\"So I suspected.\"\n\n\"We've--a--corresponded on the subject,\" Mr. Carteret continued to\nconfess. \"My view of the advantageous character of such an alliance has\nentirely coincided with hers.\"\n\n\"It was very good-natured of you then to leave me to speak first,\" said\nNick.\n\n\"I should have been disappointed if you hadn't. I don't like all you've\ntold me. But don't disappoint me now.\"\n\n\"Dear Mr. Carteret!\" Nick vaguely and richly sounded.\n\n\"I won't disappoint _you_,\" that gentleman went on with a finer point\nwhile he looked at his big old-fashioned watch.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nAt first Peter Sherringham thought of asking to be transferred to\nanother post and went so far, in London, as to take what he believed\ngood advice on the subject. The advice, perhaps struck him as the better\nfor consisting of a strong recommendation to do nothing so foolish. Two\nor three reasons were mentioned to him why such a request would not, in\nthe particular circumstances, raise him in the esteem of his superiors,\nand he promptly recognised their force. He next became aware that it\nmight help him--not with his superiors but with himself--to apply for an\nextension of leave, and then on further reflexion made out that, though\nthere are some dangers before which it is perfectly consistent with\nhonour to flee, it was better for every one concerned that he should\nfight this especial battle on the spot. During his holiday his plan of\ncampaign gave him plenty of occupation. He refurbished his arms, rubbed\nup his strategy, laid down his lines of defence.\n\nThere was only one thing in life his mind had been much made up to, but\non this question he had never wavered: he would get on, to the utmost,\nin his profession. That was a point on which it was perfectly lawful to\nbe unamiable to others--to be vigilant, eager, suspicious, selfish. He\nhad not in fact been unamiable to others, for his affairs had not\nrequired it: he had got on well enough without hardening his heart.\nFortune had been kind to him and he had passed so many competitors on\nthe way that he could forswear jealousy and be generous. But he had\nalways flattered himself his hand wouldn't falter on the day he should\nfind it necessary to drop bitterness into his cup. This day would be\nsure to dawn, since no career could be all clear water to the end; and\nthen the sacrifice would find him ready. His mind was familiar with the\nthought of a sacrifice: it is true that no great plainness invested\nbeforehand the occasion, the object or the victim. All that particularly\nstood out was that the propitiatory offering would have to be some\ncherished enjoyment. Very likely indeed this enjoyment would be\nassociated with the charms of another person--a probability pregnant\nwith the idea that such charms would have to be dashed out of sight. At\nany rate it never had occurred to Sherringham that he himself might be\nthe sacrifice. You had to pay to get on, but at least you borrowed from\nothers to do it. When you couldn't borrow you didn't get on, for what\nwas the situation in life in which you met the whole requisition\nyourself?\n\nLeast of all had it occurred to our friend that the wrench might come\nthrough his interest in that branch of art on which Nick Dormer had\nrallied him. The beauty of a love of the theatre was precisely in its\nbeing a passion exercised on the easiest terms. This was not the region\nof responsibility. It was sniffed at, to its discredit, by the austere;\nbut if it was not, as such people said, a serious field, was not the\ncompensation just that you couldn't be seriously entangled in it?\nSherringham's great advantage, as he regarded the matter, was that he\nhad always kept his taste for the drama quite in its place. His\nfacetious cousin was free to pretend that it sprawled through his life;\nbut this was nonsense, as any unprejudiced observer of that life would\nunhesitatingly attest. There had not been the least sprawling, and his\ninterest in the art of Garrick had never, he was sure, made him in any\ndegree ridiculous. It had never drawn down from above anything\napproaching a reprimand, a remonstrance, a remark. Sherringham was\npositively proud of his discretion, for he was not a little proud of\nwhat he did know about the stage. Trifling for trifling, there were\nplenty of his fellows who had in their lives infatuations less edifying\nand less confessable. Hadn't he known men who collected old\ninvitation-cards and were ready to commit _bassesses_ for those of the\neighteenth century? hadn't he known others who had a secret passion for\nshuffleboard? His little weaknesses were intellectual--they were a part\nof the life of the mind. All the same, on the day they showed a symptom\nof interfering they should be plucked off with a turn of the wrist.\n\nSherringham scented interference now, and interference in rather an\ninvidious form. It might be a bore, from the point of view of the\nprofession, to find one's self, as a critic of the stage, in love with a\n_coquine_; but it was a much greater bore to find one's self in love\nwith a young woman whose character remained to be estimated. Miriam\nRooth was neither fish nor flesh: one had with her neither the\nguarantees of one's own class nor the immunities of hers. What _was_\nhers if one came to that? A rare ambiguity on this point was part of the\nfascination she had ended by throwing over him. Poor Peter's scheme for\ngetting on had contained no proviso against his falling in love, but it\nhad embodied an important clause on the subject of surprises. It was\nalways a surprise to fall in love, especially if one was looking out for\nit; so this contingency had not been worth official paper. But it\nbecame a man who respected the service he had undertaken for the State\nto be on his guard against predicaments from which the only issue was\nthe rigour of matrimony. Ambition, in the career, was probably\nconsistent with marrying--but only with opening one's eyes very wide to\ndo it. That was the fatal surprise--to be led to the altar in a dream.\nSherringham's view of the proprieties attached to such a step was high\nand strict; and if he held that a man in his position was, above all as\nthe position improved, essentially a representative of the greatness of\nhis country, he considered that the wife of such a personage would\nexercise in her degree--for instance at a foreign court--a function no\nless symbolic. She would in short always be a very important quantity,\nand the scene was strewn with illustrations of this general truth. She\nmight be such a help and might be such a blight that common prudence\nrequired some test of her in advance. Sherringham had seen women in the\ncareer, who were stupid or vulgar, make such a mess of things as would\nwring your heart. Then he had his positive idea of the perfect\nambassadress, the full-blown lily of the future; and with this idea\nMiriam Rooth presented no analogy whatever.\n\nThe girl had described herself with characteristic directness as \"all\nright\"; and so she might be, so she assuredly was: only all right for\nwhat? He had made out she was not sentimental--that whatever capacity\nshe might have for responding to a devotion or for desiring it was at\nany rate not in the direction of vague philandering. With him certainly\nshe had no disposition to philander. Sherringham almost feared to dwell\non this, lest it should beget in him a rage convertible mainly into\ncaring for her more. Rage or no rage it would be charming to be in love\nwith her if there were no complications; but the complications were\njust what was clearest in the prospect. He was perhaps cold-blooded to\nthink of them, but it must be remembered that they were the particular\nthing his training had equipped him for dealing with. He was at all\nevents not too cold-blooded to have, for the two months of his holiday,\nvery little inner vision of anything more abstract than Miriam's face.\nThe desire to see it again was as pressing as thirst, but he tried to\npractise the endurance of the traveller in the desert. He kept the\nChannel between them, but his spirit consumed every day an inch of the\ninterval, until--and it was not long--there were no more inches left.\nThe last thing he expected the future ambassadress to have been was\n_fille de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_. The answer to this objection was of course that\nMiriam was not yet so much of one but that he could easily, by a\nhandsome \"worldly\" offer, arrest her development. Then came worrying\nretorts to that, chief among which was the sense that to his artistic\nconscience arresting her development would be a plan combining on his\npart fatuity, not to say imbecility, with baseness. It was exactly to\nher development the poor girl had the greatest right, and he shouldn't\nreally alter anything by depriving her of it. Wasn't she the artist to\nthe tips of her tresses--the ambassadress never in the world--and\nwouldn't she take it out in something else if one were to make her\ndeviate? So certain was that demonic gift to insist ever on its own.\n\nBesides, _could_ one make her deviate? If she had no disposition to\nphilander what was his warrant for supposing she could be corrupted into\nrespectability? How could the career--his career--speak to a nature that\nhad glimpses as vivid as they were crude of such a different range and\nfor which success meant quite another sauce to the dish? Would the\nbrilliancy of marrying Peter Sherringham be such a bribe to\nrelinquishment? How could he think so without pretensions of the sort he\npretended exactly not to flaunt?--how could he put himself forward as so\nhigh a prize? Relinquishment of the opportunity to exercise a rare\ntalent was not, in the nature of things, an easy effort to a young lady\nwho was herself presumptuous as well as ambitious. Besides, she might\neat her cake and have it--might make her fortune both on the stage and\nin the world. Successful actresses had ended by marrying dukes, and was\nnot that better than remaining obscure and marrying a commoner? There\nwere moments when he tried to pronounce the girl's \"gift\" not a force to\nreckon with; there was so little to show for it as yet that the caprice\nof believing in it would perhaps suddenly leave him. But his conviction\nthat it was real was too uneasy to make such an experiment peaceful, and\nhe came back, moreover, to his deepest impression--that of her being of\nthe inward mould for which the only consistency is the play of genius.\nHadn't Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 declared at the last that she could \"do anything\"?\nIt was true that if Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 had been mistaken in the first place\nshe might also be mistaken in the second. But in this latter case she\nwould be mistaken with him--and such an error would be too like a truth.\n\nHow, further, shall we exactly measure for him--Sherringham felt the\ndiscomfort of the advantage Miriam had of him--the advantage of her\npresenting herself in a light that rendered any passion he might\nentertain an implication of duty as well as of pleasure? Why there\nshould have been this implication was more than he could say; sometimes\nhe held himself rather abject, or at least absurdly superstitious, for\nseeing it. He didn't know, he could scarcely conceive, of another case\nof the same general type in which he would have recognised it. In\nforeign countries there were very few ladies of Miss Rooth's intended\nprofession who would not have regarded it as too strong an order that,\nto console them for not being admitted into drawing-rooms, they should\nhave no offset but the exercise of a virtue in which no one would\nbelieve. This was because in foreign countries actresses were not\nadmitted into drawing-rooms: that was a pure English drollery,\nministering equally little to real histrionics and to the higher tone of\nthese resorts. Did the oppressive sanctity which made it a burden to\nhave to reckon with his young friend come then from her being English?\nPeter could recall cases in which that privilege operated as little as\npossible as a restriction. It came a great deal from Mrs. Rooth, in whom\nhe apprehended depths of calculation as to what she might achieve for\nher daughter by \"working\" the idea of a life blameless amid dire\nobsessions. Her romantic turn of mind wouldn't in the least prevent her\nregarding that idea as a substantial capital, to be laid out to the best\nworldly advantage. Miriam's essential irreverence was capable, on a\npretext, of making mince-meat of it--that he was sure of; for the only\ncapital she recognised was the talent which some day managers and agents\nwould outbid each other in paying for. Yet as a creature easy at so many\npoints she was fond of her mother, would do anything to oblige--that\nmight work in all sorts of ways--and would probably like the loose\nslippers of blamelessness quite as well as having to meet some of the\nqueer high standards of the opposite camp.\n\nSherringham, I may add, had no desire that she should indulge a\ndifferent preference: it was distasteful to him to compute the\nprobabilities of a young lady's misbehaving for his advantage--that\nseemed to him definitely base--and he would have thought himself a\nblackguard if, even when a prey to his desire, he had not wished the\nthing that was best for the object of it. The thing best for Miriam\nmight be to become the wife of the man to whose suit she should incline\nher ear. That this would be the best thing for the gentleman in question\nby no means, however, equally followed, and Sherringham's final\nconviction was that it would never do for him to act the part of that\nhypothetic personage. He asked for no removal and no extension of leave,\nand he proved to himself how well he knew what he was about by never\naddressing a line, during his absence, to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne. He\nwould simply go straight, inflicting as little injury on Peter\nSherringham as on any one else. He remained away to the last hour of his\nprivilege and continued to act lucidly in having nothing to do with the\nmother and daughter for several days after his return to Paris.\n\nIt was when this discipline came to an end one afternoon after a week\nhad passed that he felt most the force of the reference we have just\nmade to Mrs. Rooth's private calculations. He found her at home, alone,\nwriting a letter under the lamp, and as soon as he came in she cried out\nthat he was the very person to whom the letter was addressed. She could\nbear it no longer; she had permitted herself to reproach him with his\nterrible silence--to ask why he had quite forsaken them. It was an\nillustration of the way in which her visitor had come to regard her that\nhe put rather less than more faith into this description of the crumpled\npapers lying on the table. He was not even sure he quite believed Miriam\nto have just gone out. He told her mother how busy he had been all the\nwhile he was away and how much time above all he had had to give in\nLondon to seeing on her daughter's behalf the people connected with the\ntheatres.\n\n\"Ah if you pity me tell me you've got her an engagement!\" Mrs. Rooth\ncried while she clasped her hands.\n\n\"I took a great deal of trouble; I wrote ever so many notes, sought\nintroductions, talked with people--such impossible people some of them.\nIn short I knocked at every door, I went into the question\nexhaustively.\" And he enumerated the things he had done, reported on\nsome of the knowledge he had gathered. The difficulties were immense,\nand even with the influence he could command, such as it was, there was\nvery little to be achieved in face of them. Still he had gained ground:\ntwo or three approachable fellows, men with inferior theatres, had\nlistened to him better than the others, and there was one in particular\nwhom he had a hope he really might have interested. From him he had\nextracted benevolent assurances: this person would see Miriam, would\nlisten to her, would do for her what he could. The trouble was that no\none would lift a finger for a girl unless she were known, and yet that\nshe never could become known till innumerable fingers had been lifted.\nYou couldn't go into the water unless you could swim, and you couldn't\nswim until you had been in the water.\n\n\"But new performers appear; they get theatres, they get audiences, they\nget notices in the newspapers,\" Mrs. Rooth objected. \"I know of these\nthings only what Miriam tells me. It's no knowledge that I was born to.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly true. It's all done with money.\"\n\n\"And how do they come by money?\" Mrs. Rooth candidly asked.\n\n\"When they're women people give it to them.\"\n\n\"Well, what people now?\"\n\n\"People who believe in them.\"\n\n\"As you believe in Miriam?\"\n\nPeter had a pause. \"No, rather differently. A poor man doesn't believe\nin anything the same way that a rich man does.\"\n\n\"Ah don't call yourself poor!\" groaned Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"What good would it do me to be rich?\"\n\n\"Why you could take a theatre. You could do it all yourself.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do me?\"\n\n\"Ah don't you delight in her genius?\" demanded Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"I delight in her mother. You think me more disinterested than I am,\"\nSherringham added with a certain soreness of irritation.\n\n\"I know why you didn't write!\" Mrs. Rooth declared archly.\n\n\"You must go to London,\" Peter said without heeding this remark.\n\n\"Ah if we could only get there it would be a relief. I should draw a\nlong breath. There at least I know where I am and what people are. But\nhere one lives on hollow ground!\"\n\n\"The sooner you get away the better,\" our young man went on.\n\n\"I know why you say that.\"\n\n\"It's just what I'm explaining.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have held out if I hadn't been so sure of Miriam,\" said Mrs.\nRooth.\n\n\"Well, you needn't hold out any longer.\"\n\n\"Don't _you_ trust her?\" asked Sherringham's hostess.\n\n\"Trust her?\"\n\n\"You don't trust yourself. That's why you were silent, why we might have\nthought you were dead, why we might have perished ourselves.\"\n\n\"I don't think I understand you; I don't know what you're talking\nabout,\" Peter returned. \"But it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it? Let yourself go. Why should you struggle?\" the old woman\nagreeably inquired.\n\nHer unexpected insistence annoyed her visitor, and he was silent again,\nmeeting her eyes with reserve and on the point of telling her that he\ndidn't like her tone. But he had his tongue under such control that he\nwas able presently to say instead of this--and it was a relief to him to\ngive audible voice to the reflexion--\"It's a great mistake, either way,\nfor a man to be in love with an actress. Either it means nothing\nserious, and what's the use of that? or it means everything, and that's\nstill more delusive.\"\n\n\"Delusive?\"\n\n\"Idle, unprofitable.\"\n\n\"Surely a pure affection is its own beautiful reward,\" Mrs. Rooth\npleaded with soft reasonableness.\n\n\"In such a case how can it be pure?\"\n\n\"I thought you were talking of an English gentleman,\" she replied.\n\n\"Call the poor fellow whatever you like: a man with his life to lead,\nhis way to make, his work, his duties, his career to attend to. If it\nmeans nothing, as I say, the thing it means least of all is marriage.\"\n\n\"Oh my own Miriam!\" Mrs. Rooth wailed.\n\n\"Fancy, on the other hand, the complication when such a man marries a\nwoman who's on the stage.\"\n\nMrs. Rooth looked as if she were trying to follow. \"Miriam isn't on the\nstage yet.\"\n\n\"Go to London and she soon will be.\"\n\n\"Yes, and then you'll have your excuse.\"\n\n\"My excuse?\"\n\n\"For deserting us altogether.\"\n\nHe broke into laughter at this, the logic was so droll. Then he went on:\n\"Show me some good acting and I won't desert you.\"\n\n\"Good acting? Ah what's the best acting compared with the position of a\ntrue English lady? If you'll take her as she is you may have her,\" Mrs.\nRooth suddenly added.\n\n\"As she is, with all her ambitions unassuaged?\"\n\n\"To marry _you_--might not that be an ambition?\"\n\n\"A very paltry one. Don't answer for her, don't attempt that,\" said\nPeter. \"You can do much better.\"\n\n\"Do you think _you_ can?\" smiled Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"I don't want to; I only want to let it alone. She's an artist; you must\ngive her her head,\" the young man pursued. \"You must always give an\nartist his head.\"\n\n\"But I've known great ladies who were artists. In English society\nthere's always a field.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me of English society! Thank goodness, in the first\nplace, I don't live in it. Do you want her to give up her genius?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"I thought you didn't care for it.\"\n\n\"She'd say, 'No I thank you, dear mamma.'\"\n\n\"My wonderful child!\" Mrs. Rooth almost comprehendingly murmured.\n\n\"Have you ever proposed it to her?\"\n\n\"Proposed it?\"\n\n\"That she should give up trying.\"\n\nMrs. Rooth hesitated, looking down. \"Not for the reason you mean. We\ndon't talk about love,\" she simpered.\n\n\"Then it's so much less time wasted. Don't stretch out your hand to the\nworse when it may some day grasp the better,\" Peter continued. Mrs.\nRooth raised her eyes at him as if recognising the force there might be\nin that, and he added: \"Let her blaze out, let her look about her. Then\nyou may talk to me if you like.\"\n\n\"It's very puzzling!\" the old woman artlessly sighed.\n\nHe laughed again and then said: \"Now don't tell me I'm not a good\nfriend.\"\n\n\"You are indeed--you're a very noble gentleman. That's just why a quiet\nlife with you----\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be quiet for _me_!\" he broke in. \"And that's not what\nMiriam was made for.\"\n\n\"_Don't say that_ for my precious one!\" Mrs. Rooth quavered.\n\n\"Go to London--go to London,\" her visitor repeated.\n\nThoughtfully, after an instant, she extended her hand and took from the\ntable the letter on the composition of which he had found her engaged.\nThen with a quick movement she tore it up. \"That's what Mr. Dashwood\nsays.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dashwood?\"\n\n\"I forgot you don't know him. He's the brother of that lady we met the\nday you were so good as to receive us; the one who was so kind to\nus--Mrs. Lovick.\"\n\n\"I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"Don't you remember how she spoke of him and that Mr. Lovick didn't seem\nvery nice about him? She told us that if he were to meet us--and she was\nso good as to intimate that it would be a pleasure to him to do so--he\nmight give us, as she said, a tip.\"\n\nPeter achieved the effort to recollect. \"Yes he comes back to me. He's\nan actor.\"\n\n\"He's a gentleman too,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"And you've met him, and he _has_ given you a tip?\"\n\n\"As I say, he wants us to go to London.\"\n\n\"I see, but even I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mrs. Rooth; \"but _he_ says he can help us.\"\n\n\"Keep hold of him then, if he's in the business,\" Peter was all for\nthat.\n\n\"He's a perfect gentleman,\" said Mrs. Rooth. \"He's immensely struck with\nMiriam.\"\n\n\"Better and better. Keep hold of him.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you don't object,\" she grimaced.\n\n\"Why should I object?\"\n\n\"You don't regard us as _all_ your own?\"\n\n\"My own? Why, I regard you as the public's--the world's.\"\n\nShe gave a little shudder. \"There's a sort of chill in that. It's grand,\nbut it's cold. However, I needn't hesitate then to tell you that it's\nwith Mr. Dashwood Miriam has gone out.\"\n\n\"Why hesitate, gracious heaven?\" But in the next breath Sherringham\nasked: \"Where have they gone?\"\n\n\"You don't like it!\" his hostess laughed.\n\n\"Why should it be a thing to be enthusiastic about?\"\n\n\"Well, he's charming and _I_ trust him.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Sherringham.\n\n\"They've gone to see Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\n\"She has come back then?\"\n\n\"She was expected back last week. Miriam wants to show her how she has\nimproved.\"\n\n\"And _has_ she improved?\"\n\n\"How can I tell--with my mother's heart?\" asked Mrs. Rooth. \"I don't\njudge; I only wait and pray. But Mr. Dashwood thinks she's wonderful.\"\n\n\"That's a blessing. And when did he turn up?\"\n\n\"About a fortnight ago. We met Mrs. Lovick at the English church, and\nshe was so good as to recognise us and speak to us. She said she had\nbeen away with her children--otherwise she'd have come to see us. She\nhad just returned to Paris.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've not yet seen her. I see Lovick,\" Peter added, \"but he doesn't\ntalk of his brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"I didn't, that day, like his tone about him,\" Mrs. Rooth observed. \"We\nwalked a little way with Mrs. Lovick after church and she asked Miriam\nabout her prospects and if she were working. Miriam said she had no\nprospects.\"\n\n\"That wasn't very nice to me,\" Sherringham commented.\n\n\"But when you had left us in black darkness what _were_ our prospects?\"\n\n\"I see. It's all right. Go on.\"\n\n\"Then Mrs. Lovick said her brother was to be in Paris a few days and she\nwould tell him to come and see us. He arrived, she told him and he came.\n_Voil\u00c3\u00a0_!\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"So that now--so far as _he_ is concerned--Miss Rooth has prospects?\"\n\n\"He isn't a manager unfortunately,\" she qualified.\n\n\"Where does he act?\"\n\n\"He isn't acting just now; he has been abroad. He has been to Italy, I\nbelieve, and is just stopping here on his way to London.\"\n\n\"I see; he _is_ a perfect gentleman,\" said Sherringham.\n\n\"Ah you're jealous of him!\"\n\n\"No, but you're trying to make me so. The more competitors there are for\nthe glory of bringing her out the better for her.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dashwood wants to take a theatre,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"Then perhaps he's our man.\"\n\n\"Oh if you'd help him!\" she richly cried.\n\n\"Help him?\"\n\n\"Help him to help us.\"\n\n\"We'll all work together; it will be very jolly,\" said Sherringham\ngaily. \"It's a sacred cause, the love of art, and we shall be a happy\nband. Dashwood's his name?\" he added in a moment. \"Mrs. Lovick wasn't a\nDashwood.\"\n\n\"It's his _nom de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_--Basil Dashwood. Do you like it?\" Mrs. Rooth\nwonderfully inquired.\n\n\"You say that as Miriam might. Her talent's catching!\"\n\n\"She's always practising--always saying things over and over to seize\nthe tone. I've her voice in my ears. He wants _her_ not to have any.\"\n\n\"Not to have any what?\"\n\n\"Any _nom de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_. He wants her to use her own; he likes it so much.\nHe says it will do so well--you can't better it.\"\n\n\"He's a capital adviser,\" said Sherringham, getting up. \"I'll come back\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I won't ask you to wait for them--they may be so long,\" his hostess\nreturned.\n\n\"Will he come back with her?\" Peter asked while he smoothed his hat.\n\n\"I hope so, at this hour. With my child in the streets I tremble. We\ndon't live in cabs, as you may easily suppose.\"\n\n\"Did they go on foot?\" Sherringham continued.\n\n\"Oh yes; they started in high spirits.\"\n\n\"And is Mr. Basil Dashwood acquainted with Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9?\"\n\n\"Ah no, but he longed to be introduced to her; he persuaded Miriam to\ntake him. Naturally she wishes to oblige him. She's very nice to him--if\nhe can do anything.\"\n\n\"Quite right; that's the way!\" Peter cheerfully rang out.\n\n\"And she also wanted him to see what she can do for the great critic,\"\nMrs. Rooth added--\"that terrible old woman in the red wig.\"\n\n\"That's what I should like to see too,\" Peter permitted himself to\nacknowledge.\n\n\"Oh she has gone ahead; she's pleased with herself. 'Work, work, work,'\nsaid Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. Well, she has worked, worked, worked. That's what\nMr. Dashwood is pleased with even more than with other things.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by other things?\"\n\n\"Oh her genius and her fine appearance.\"\n\n\"He approves of her fine appearance? I ask because you think he knows\nwhat will take.\"\n\n\"I know why you ask!\" Mrs. Rooth bravely mocked. \"He says it will be\nworth hundreds of thousands to her.\"\n\n\"That's the sort of thing I like to hear,\" Peter returned. \"I'll come in\nto-morrow,\" he repeated.\n\n\"And shall you mind if Mr. Dash wood's here?\"\n\n\"Does he come every day?\"\n\n\"Oh they're always at it.\"\n\n\"At it----?\" He was vague.\n\n\"Why she acts to him--every sort of thing--and he says if it will do.\"\n\n\"How many days has he been here then?\"\n\nMrs. Rooth reflected. \"Oh I don't know! Since he turned up they've\npassed so quickly.\"\n\n\"So far from 'minding' it I'm eager to see him,\" Sherringham declared;\n\"and I can imagine nothing better than what you describe--if he isn't an\nawful ass.\"\n\n\"Dear me, if he isn't clever you must tell us: we can't afford to be\ndeceived!\" Mrs. Rooth innocently wailed. \"What do we know--how can we\njudge?\" she appealed.\n\nHe had a pause, his hand on the latch. \"Oh, I'll tell you frankly what I\nthink of him!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nWhen he got into the street he looked about him for a cab, but was\nobliged to walk some distance before encountering one. In this little\ninterval he saw no reason to modify the determination he had formed in\ndescending the steep staircase of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Garonne; indeed the\ndesire prompting it only quickened his pace. He had an hour to spare and\nwould also go to see Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. If Miriam and her companion had\nproceeded to the Rue de Constantinople on foot he would probably reach\nthe house as soon as they. It was all quite logical: he was eager to see\nMiriam--that was natural enough; and he had admitted to Mrs. Rooth that\nhe was keen on the subject of Mrs. Lovick's theatrical brother, in whom\nsuch effective aid might perhaps reside. To catch Miriam really\nrevealing herself to the old actress after the jump she believed herself\nto have taken--since that was her errand--would be a very happy stroke,\nthe thought of which made her benefactor impatient. He presently found\nhis cab and, as he bounded in, bade the coachman drive fast. He learned\nfrom Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's portress that her illustrious _locataire_ was at\nhome and that a lady and a gentleman had gone up some time before.\n\nIn the little antechamber, after his admission, he heard a high voice\ncome from the salon and, stopping a moment to listen, noted that Miriam\nwas already launched in a recitation. He was able to make out the\nwords, all the more that before he could prevent the movement the\nmaid-servant who had led him in had already opened the door of the\nroom--one of the leaves of it, there being, as in most French doors, two\nof these--before which, within, a heavy curtain was suspended. Miriam\nwas in the act of rolling out some speech from the English poetic\ndrama--\n\n    \"For I am sick and capable of fears,\n    Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears.\"\n\nHe recognised one of the great tirades of Shakespeare's Constance and\nsaw she had just begun the magnificent scene at the beginning of the\nthird act of _King John_, in which the passionate, injured mother and\nwidow sweeps in wild organ-tones the entire scale of her irony and\nwrath. The curtain concealed him and he lurked three minutes after he\nhad motioned to the _femme de chambre_ to retire on tiptoe. The trio in\nthe salon, absorbed in the performance, had apparently not heard his\nentrance or the opening of the door, which was covered by the girl's\nsplendid declamation. Peter listened intently, arrested by the spirit\nwith which she attacked her formidable verses. He had needed to hear her\nset afloat but a dozen of them to measure the long stride she had taken\nin his absence; they assured him she had leaped into possession of her\nmeans. He remained where he was till she arrived at\n\n    \"Then speak again; not all thy former tale,\n    But this one word, whether thy tale be true.\"\n\nThis apostrophe, briefly responded to in another voice, gave him time\nquickly to raise the curtain and show himself, passing into the room\nwith a \"Go on, go on!\" and a gesture earnestly deprecating a stop.\n\nMiriam, in the full swing of her part, paused but for an instant and let\nherself ring out again, while Peter sank into the nearest chair and she\nfixed him with her illumined eyes, that is, with those of the raving\nConstance. Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, buried in a chair, kissed her hand to him, and\na young man who, near the girl, stood giving the cue, stared at him over\nthe top of a little book. \"Admirable, magnificent, go on,\" Sherringham\nrepeated--\"go on to the end of the scene, do it all!\" Miriam's colour\nrose, yet he as quickly felt that she had no personal emotion in seeing\nhim again; the cold passion of art had perched on her banner and she\nlistened to herself with an ear as vigilant as if she had been a\nPaganini drawing a fiddle-bow. This effect deepened as she went on,\nrising and rising to the great occasion, moving with extraordinary ease\nand in the largest, clearest style at the dizzy height of her idea. That\nshe had an idea was visible enough, and that the whole thing was very\ndifferent from all Sherringham had hitherto heard her attempt. It\nbelonged quite to another class of effort; she was now the finished\nstatue lifted from the ground to its pedestal. It was as if the sun of\nher talent had risen above the hills and she knew she was moving and\nwould always move in its guiding light. This conviction was the one\nartless thing that glimmered like a young joy through the tragic mask of\nConstance, and Sherringham's heart beat faster as he caught it in her\nface. It only showed her as more intelligent, and yet there had been a\ntime when he thought her stupid! Masterful the whole spirit in which she\ncarried the scene, making him cry to himself from point to point, \"How\nshe feels it, sees it and really 'renders' it!\"\n\nHe looked now and again at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 and saw she had in her lap an\nopen book, apparently a French prose version, brought by her visitors,\nof the play; but she never either glanced at him or at the volume: she\nonly sat screwing into the girl her hard, bright eyes, polished by\nexperience like fine old brasses. The young man uttering the lines of\nthe other speakers was attentive in another degree; he followed Miriam,\nin his own copy, to keep sure of the cue; but he was elated and\nexpressive, was evidently even surprised; he coloured and smiled, and\nwhen he extended his hand to assist Constance to rise, after the\nperformer, acting out her text, had seated herself grandly on \"the huge\nfirm earth,\" he bowed over her as obsequiously as if she had been his\nveritable sovereign. He was a good-looking young man, tall,\nwell-proportioned, straight-featured and fair, of whom manifestly the\nfirst thing to be said on any occasion was that he had remarkably the\nstamp of a gentleman. He earned this appearance, which proved inveterate\nand importunate, to a point that was almost a denial of its spirit: so\nprompt the question of whether it could be in good taste to wear any\ncharacter, even that particular one, so much on one's sleeve. It was\nliterally on his sleeve that this young man partly wore his own; for it\nresided considerably in his garments, and in especial in a certain\nclose-fitting dark blue frock-coat, a miracle of a fit, which moulded\nhis juvenility just enough and not too much, and constituted, as\nSherringham was destined to perceive later, his perpetual uniform or\nbadge. It was not till afterwards that Peter began to feel exasperated\nby Basil Dashwood's \"type\"--the young stranger was of course Basil\nDashwood--and even by his blue frock-coat, the recurrent, unvarying,\nimperturbable good form of his aspect. This unprofessional air ended by\nstriking the observer as the very profession he had adopted, and was\nindeed, so far as had as yet been indicated, his mimetic capital, his\nmain qualification for the stage.\n\nThe ample and powerful manner in which Miriam handled her scene produced\nits full impression, the art with which she surmounted its difficulties,\nthe liberality with which she met its great demand upon the voice, and\nthe variety of expression that she threw into a torrent of objurgation.\nIt was a real composition, studded with passages that called a\nsuppressed tribute to the lips and seeming to show that a talent capable\nof such an exhibition was capable of anything.\n\n    \"But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,\n    Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:\n    Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,\n    And with the half-blown rose.\"\n\nAs the girl turned to her imagined child with this exquisite\napostrophe--she addressed Mr. Dashwood as if he were playing Arthur, and\nhe lowered his book, dropped his head and his eyes and looked handsome\nand ingenuous--she opened at a stroke to Sherringham's vision a prospect\nthat they would yet see her express tenderness better even than anything\nelse. Her voice was enchanting in these lines, and the beauty of her\nperformance was that though she uttered the full fury of the part she\nmissed none of its poetry.\n\n\"Where did she get hold of that--where did she get hold of that?\" Peter\nwondered while his whole sense vibrated. \"She hadn't got hold of it when\nI went away.\" And the assurance flowed over him again that she had found\nthe key to her box of treasures. In the summer, during their weeks of\nfrequent meeting, she had only fumbled with the lock. One October day,\nwhile he was away, the key had slipped in, had fitted, or her finger at\nlast had touched the right spring and the capricious casket had flown\nopen.\n\nIt was during the present solemnity that, excited by the way she came\nout and with a hundred stirred ideas about her wheeling through his\nmind, he was for the first time and most vividly visited by a perception\nthat ended by becoming frequent with him--that of the perfect presence\nof mind, unconfused, unhurried by emotion, that any artistic performance\nrequires and that all, whatever the instrument, require in exactly the\nsame degree: the application, in other words, clear and calculated,\ncrystal-firm as it were, of the idea conceived in the glow of\nexperience, of suffering, of joy. He was afterwards often to talk of\nthis with Miriam, who, however, was never to be able to present him with\na neat theory of the subject. She had no knowledge that it was publicly\ndiscussed; she only ranged herself in practice on the side of those who\nhold that at the moment of production the artist can't too much have his\nwits about him. When Peter named to her the opinion of those maintaining\nthat at such a crisis the office of attention ceases to be filled she\nstared with surprise and then broke out: \"Ah the poor idiots!\" She\neventually became, in her judgements, in impatience and the expression\nof contempt, very free and absolutely irreverent.\n\n\"What a splendid scolding!\" the new visitor exclaimed when, on the\nentrance of the Pope's legate, her companion closed the book on the\nscene. Peter pressed his lips to Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's finger-tips; the old\nactress got up and held out her arms to Miriam. The girl never took her\neyes off Sherringham while she passed into that lady's embrace and\nremained there. They were full of their usual sombre fire, and it was\nalways the case that they expressed too much anything they could express\nat all; but they were not defiant nor even triumphant now--they were\nonly deeply explicative. They seemed to say, \"That's the sort of thing\nI meant; that's what I had in mind when I asked you to try to do\nsomething for me.\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 folded her pupil to her bosom, holding\nher there as the old marquise in a _com\u00c3\u00a9die de moeurs_ might in the last\nscene have held her god-daughter the _ing\u00c3\u00a9nue_.\n\n\"Have you got me an engagement?\"--the young woman then appealed eagerly\nto her friend. \"Yes, he has done something splendid for me,\" she went on\nto Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, resting her hand caressingly on one of the actress's\nwhile the old woman discoursed with Mr. Dashwood, who was telling her in\nvery pretty French that he was tremendously excited about Miss Rooth.\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 looked at him as if she wondered how he appeared when he\nwas calm and how, as a dramatic artist, he expressed that condition.\n\n\"Yes, yes, something splendid, for a beginning,\" Peter answered\nradiantly, recklessly; feeling now only that he would say anything and\ndo anything to please her. He spent on the spot, in imagination, his\nlast penny.\n\n\"It's such a pity you couldn't follow it; you'd have liked it so much\nbetter,\" Mr. Dashwood observed to their hostess.\n\n\"Couldn't follow it? Do you take me for _une sotte_?\" the celebrated\nartist cried. \"I suspect I followed it _de plus pr\u00c3\u00a8s que vous,\nmonsieur_!\"\n\n\"Ah you see the language is so awfully fine,\" Basil Dashwood replied,\nlooking at his shoes.\n\n\"The language? Why she rails like a fish-wife. Is that what you call\nlanguage? Ours is another business.\"\n\n\"If you understood, if you understood, you'd see all the greatness of\nit,\" Miriam declared. And then in another tone: \"Such delicious\nexpressions!\"\n\n\"_On dit que c'est tr\u00c3\u00a8s-fort_. But who can tell if you really say it?\"\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 demanded.\n\n\"Ah, _par exemple_, I can!\" Sherringham answered.\n\n\"Oh you--you're a Frenchman.\"\n\n\"Couldn't he make it out if he weren't?\" asked Basil Dashwood.\n\nThe old woman shrugged her shoulders. \"He wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"That's flattering to me.\"\n\n\"Oh you--don't you pretend to complain,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 said. \"I prefer\n_our_ imprecations--those of Camille,\" she went on. \"They have the\nbeauty _des plus belles choses_.\"\n\n\"I can say them too,\" Miriam broke in.\n\n\"_Insolente_!\" smiled Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. \"Camille doesn't squat down on the\nfloor in the middle of them.\n\n    \"For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.\n    To me and to the state of my great grief\n    Let kings assemble,\"\n\nMiriam quickly declaimed. \"Ah if you don't feel the way she makes a\nthrone of it!\"\n\n\"It's really tremendously fine, _ch\u00c3\u00a8re madame_,\" Sherringham said.\n\"There's nothing like it.\"\n\n\"_Vous \u00c3\u00aates insupportables_,\" the old woman answered. \"Stay with us.\nI'll teach you Ph\u00c3\u00a8dre.\"\n\n\"Ah Ph\u00c3\u00a6dra, Ph\u00c3\u00a6dra!\" Basil Dashwood vaguely ejaculated, looking more\ngentlemanly than ever.\n\n\"You've learned all I've taught you, but where the devil have you\nlearned what I haven't?\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 went on.\n\n\"I've worked--I have; you'd call it work--all through the bright, late\nsummer, all through the hot, dull, empty days. I've battered down the\ndoor--I did hear it crash one day. But I'm not so very good yet. I'm\nonly in the right direction.\"\n\n\"_Malicieuse_!\" growled Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"Oh I can beat that,\" the girl went on.\n\n\"Did you wake up one morning and find you had grown a pair of wings?\"\nPeter asked. \"Because that's what the difference amounts to--you really\nsoar. Moreover, you're an angel,\" he added, charmed with her\nunexpectedness, the good nature of her forbearance to reproach him for\nnot having written to her. And it seemed to him privately that she _was_\nangelic when in answer to this she said ever so blandly:\n\n\"You know you read _King John_ with me before you went away. I thought\nover immensely what you said. I didn't understand it much at the time--I\nwas so stupid. But it all came to me later.\"\n\n\"I wish you could see yourself,\" Peter returned.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I do. What sort of a dunce do you take me for? I didn't\nmiss a vibration of my voice, a fold of my robe.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't see you troubling about it,\" Peter handsomely insisted.\n\n\"No one ever will. Do you think I'd ever show it?\"\n\n\"_Ars celare artem_,\" Basil Dashwood jocosely dropped.\n\n\"You must first have the art to hide,\" said Sherringham, wondering a\nlittle why Miriam didn't introduce her young friend to him. She was,\nhowever, both then and later perfectly neglectful of such cares, never\nthinking, never minding how other people got on together. When she found\nthey didn't get on she jeered at them: that was the nearest she came to\narranging for them. Our young man noted in her from the moment she felt\nher strength an immense increase of this good-humoured inattention to\ndetail--all detail save that of her work, to which she was ready to\nsacrifice holocausts of feelings when the feelings were other people's.\nThis conferred on her a large profanity, an absence of ceremony as to\nher social relations, which was both amusing because it suggested that\nshe would take what she gave, and formidable because it was inconvenient\nand you mightn't care to give what she would take.\n\n\"If you haven't any art it's not quite the same as if you didn't hide\nit, is it?\" Basil Dashwood ingeniously threw out.\n\n\"That's right--say one of your clever things!\" Miriam sweetly responded.\n\n\"You're always acting,\" he declared in English and with a simple-minded\nlaugh, while Sherringham remained struck with his expressing just what\nhe himself had felt weeks before.\n\n\"And when you've shown them your fish-wife, to your public _de l\u00c3\u00a0-bas_,\nwhat will you do next?\" asked Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\"I'll do Juliet--I'll do Cleopatra.\"\n\n\"Rather a big bill, isn't it?\" Mr. Dashwood volunteered to Sherringham\nin a friendly but discriminating manner.\n\n\"Constance and Juliet--take care you don't mix them,\" said Sherringham.\n\n\"I want to be various. You once told me I had a hundred characters,\"\nMiriam returned.\n\n\"Ah, _vous en \u00c3\u00aates l\u00c3\u00a0_?\" cried the old actress. \"You may have a hundred\ncharacters, but you've only three plays. I'm told that's all there are\nin English.\"\n\nMiriam, admirably indifferent to this charge, appealed to Peter. \"What\narrangements have you made? What do the people want?\"\n\n\"The people at the theatre?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid they don't want _King John_, and I don't believe they hunger\nfor _Antony and Cleopatra_,\" Basil Dashwood suggested. \"Ships and sieges\nand armies and pyramids, you know: we mustn't be too heavy.\"\n\n\"Oh I hate scenery!\" the girl sighed.\n\n\"_Elle est superbe_,\" said Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. \"You must put those pieces on\nthe stage: how will you do it?\"\n\n\"Oh we know how to get up a play in London, Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9\"--Mr. Dashwood\nwas all geniality. \"They put money on it, you know.\"\n\n\"On it? But what do they put _in_ it? Who'll interpret them? Who'll\nmanage a style like that--the style of which the rhapsodies she has just\nrepeated are a specimen? Whom have you got that one has ever heard of?\"\n\n\"Oh you'll hear of a good deal when once she gets started,\" Dashwood\ncheerfully contended.\n\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 looked at him a moment; then, \"I feel that you'll become\nvery bad,\" she said to Miriam. \"I'm glad I shan't see it.\"\n\n\"People will do things for me--I'll make them,\" the girl declared. \"I'll\nstir them up so that they'll have ideas.\"\n\n\"What people, pray?\"\n\n\"Ah terrible woman!\" Peter theatrically groaned.\n\n\"We translate your pieces--there will be plenty of parts,\" Basil\nDashwood said.\n\n\"Why then go out of the door to come in at the window?--especially if\nyou smash it! An English arrangement of a French piece is a pretty woman\nwith her back turned.\"\n\n\"Do you really want to keep her?\" Sherringham asked of Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9--quite as if thinking for a moment that this after all might be\npossible.\n\nShe bent her strange eyes on him. \"No, you're all too queer together. We\ncouldn't be bothered with you and you're not worth it.\"\n\n\"I'm glad it's 'together' that we're queer then--we can console each\nother.\"\n\n\"If you only would; but you don't seem to! In short I don't understand\nyou--I give you up. But it doesn't matter,\" said the old woman wearily,\n\"for the theatre's dead and even you, _ma toute-belle_, won't bring it\nto life. Everything's going from bad to worse, and I don't care what\nbecomes of you. You wouldn't understand us here and they won't\nunderstand you there, and everything's impossible, and no one's a whit\nthe wiser, and it's not of the least consequence. Only when you raise\nyour arms lift them just a little higher,\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 added.\n\n\"My mother will be happier _chez nous_\" said Miriam, throwing her arms\nstraight up and giving them a noble tragic movement.\n\n\"You won't be in the least in the right path till your mother's in\ndespair.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps we can bring that about even in London,\" Sherringham\npatiently laughed.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Rooth--she's great fun,\" Mr. Dashwood as imperturbably\ndropped.\n\nMiriam transferred the dark weight of her gaze to him as if she were\npractising. \"_You_ won't upset her, at any rate.\" Then she stood with\nher beautiful and fatal mask before her hostess. \"I want to do the\nmodern too. I want to do _le drame_, with intense realistic effects.\"\n\n\"And do you want to look like the portico of the Madeleine when it's\ndraped for a funeral?\" her instructress mocked. \"Never, never. I don't\nbelieve you're various: that's not the way I see you. You're pure\ntragedy, with _de grands \u00c3\u00a9clats de voix_ in the great style, or you're\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Be beautiful--be only that,\" Peter urged with high interest. \"Be only\nwhat you can be so well--something that one may turn to for a glimpse of\nperfection, to lift one out of all the vulgarities of the day.\"\n\nThus apostrophised the girl broke out with one of the speeches of\nRacine's Ph\u00c3\u00a6dra, hushing her companions on the instant. \"You'll be the\nEnglish Rachel,\" said Basil Dashwood when she stopped.\n\n\"Acting in French!\" Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 amended. \"I don't believe in an English\nRachel.\"\n\n\"I shall have to work it out, what I shall be,\" Miriam concluded with a\nrich pensive effect.\n\n\"You're in wonderfully good form to-day,\" Sherringham said to her; his\nappreciation revealing a personal subjection he was unable to conceal\nfrom his companions, much as he wished it.\n\n\"I really mean to do everything.\"\n\n\"Very well; after all Garrick did.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be the Garrick of my sex.\"\n\n\"There's a very clever author doing something for me; I should like you\nto see it,\" said Basil Dashwood, addressing himself equally to Miriam\nand to her diplomatic friend.\n\n\"Ah if you've very clever authors----!\" And Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 spun the sound\nto the finest satiric thread.\n\n\"I shall be very happy to see it,\" Peter returned.\n\nThis response was so benevolent that Basil Dashwood presently began:\n\"May I ask you at what theatre you've made arrangements?\"\n\nSherringham looked at him a moment. \"Come and see me at the embassy and\nI'll tell you.\" Then he added: \"I know your sister, Mrs. Lovick.\"\n\n\"So I supposed: that's why I took the liberty of asking such a\nquestion.\"\n\n\"It's no liberty, but Mr. Sherringham doesn't appear to be able to tell\nyou,\" said Miriam.\n\n\"Well, you know, it's a very curious world, all those theatrical people\nover there,\" Peter conceded.\n\n\"Ah don't say anything against them when I'm one of them,\" Basil\nDashwood laughed.\n\n\"I might plead the absence of information,\" Peter returned, \"as Miss\nRooth has neglected to make us acquainted.\"\n\nMiriam vaguely smiled. \"I know you both so little.\" But she presented\nthem with a great stately air to each other, and the two men shook hands\nwhile Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 observed them.\n\n\"_Tiens_! you gentlemen meet here for the first time? You do right to\nbecome friends--that's the best thing. Live together in peace and mutual\nconfidence. _C'est de beaucoup le plus sage_.\"\n\n\"Certainly, for yoke-fellows,\" said Sherringham.\n\nHe began the next moment to repeat to his new acquaintance some of the\nthings he had been told in London; but their hostess stopped him off,\nwaving the talk away with charming overdone stage horror and the young\nhands of the heroines of Marivaux. \"Ah wait till you go--for that! Do\nyou suppose I care for news of your mountebanks' booths?\"\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nAs many people know, there are not, in the famous Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, more\nthan a dozen good seats accessible to ladies.[*] The stalls are\nforbidden them, the boxes are a quarter of a mile from the stage and the\nbalcony is a delusion save for a few chairs at either end of its vast\nhorseshoe. But there are two excellent _baignoires d'avant-sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_, which\nindeed are by no means always to be had. It was, however, into one of\nthem that, immediately after his return to Paris, Sherringham ushered\nMrs. Rooth and her daughter, with the further escort of Basil Dashwood.\nHe had chosen the evening of the reappearance of the celebrated\nMademoiselle Voisin--she had been enjoying a _cong\u00c3\u00a9_ of three months--an\nactress whom Miriam had seen several times before and for whose method\nshe professed a high though somewhat critical esteem. It was only for\nthe return of this charming performer that Peter had been waiting to\nrespond to Miriam's most ardent wish--that of spending an hour in the\n_foyer des artistes_ of the great theatre. She was the person whom he\nknew best in the house of Moli\u00c3\u00a8re; he could count on her to do them the\nhonours some night when she was in the \"bill,\" and to make the occasion\nsociable. Miriam had been impatient for it--she was so convinced that\nher eyes would be opened in the holy of holies; but wishing as\nparticularly as he did to participate in her impression he had made her\npromise she wouldn't taste of this experience without him--not let\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, for instance, take her in his absence. There were\nquestions the girl wished to put to Mademoiselle Voisin--questions\nwhich, having admired her from the balcony, she felt she was exactly the\nperson to answer. She was more \"in it\" now, after all, than Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9, in spite of her slenderer talent: she was younger, fresher, more\nmodern and--Miriam found the word--less academic. She was in fine less\n\"_vieux jeu_.\" Peter perfectly foresaw the day when his young friend\nwould make indulgent allowances for poor Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9, patronising her\nas an old woman of good intentions.\n\n[*: 1890]\n\nThe play to-night was six months old, a large, serious, successful\ncomedy by the most distinguished of authors, with a thesis, a chorus\nembodied in one character, a _sc\u00c3\u00a8ne \u00c3\u00a0 faire_ and a part full of\nopportunities for Mademoiselle Voisin. There were things to be said\nabout this artist, strictures to be dropped as to the general quality of\nher art, and Miriam leaned back now, making her comments as if they cost\nher less, but the actress had knowledge and distinction and pathos, and\nour young lady repeated several times: \"How quiet she is, how\nwonderfully quiet! Scarcely anything moves but her face and her voice.\n_Le geste rare_, but really expressive when it comes. I like that\neconomy; it's the only way to make the gesture significant.\"\n\n\"I don't admire the way she holds her arms,\" Basil Dash wood said: \"like\na _demoiselle de magasin_ trying on a jacket.\"\n\n\"Well, she holds them at any rate. I daresay it's more than you do with\nyours.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, she holds them; there's no mistake about that. 'I hold them, I\nhope, _hein_?' she seems to say to all the house.\" The young English\nprofessional laughed good-humouredly, and Sherringham was struck with\nthe pleasant familiarity he had established with their brave companion.\nHe was knowing and ready and he said in the first _entr'acte_--they were\nwaiting for the second to go behind--amusing perceptive things. \"They\nteach them to be ladylike and Voisin's always trying to show that. 'See\nhow I walk, see how I sit, see how quiet I am and how I have _le geste\nrare_. Now can you say I ain't a lady?' She does it all as if she had a\nclass.\"\n\n\"Well, to-night I'm her class,\" said Miriam.\n\n\"Oh I don't mean of actresses, but of _femmes du monde_. She shows them\nhow to act in society.\"\n\n\"You had better take a few lessons,\" Miriam retorted.\n\n\"Ah you should see Voisin in society,\" Peter interposed.\n\n\"Does she go into it?\" Mrs. Rooth demanded with interest.\n\nHer friend hesitated. \"She receives a great many people.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't they when they're nice?\" Mrs. Rooth frankly wanted to\nknow.\n\n\"When the people are nice?\" Miriam asked.\n\n\"Now don't tell me she's not what one would wish,\" said Mrs. Rooth to\nSherringham.\n\n\"It depends on what that is,\" he darkly smiled.\n\n\"What I should wish if she were my daughter,\" the old woman rejoined\nblandly.\n\n\"Ah wish your daughter to act as well as that and you'll do the handsome\nthing for her!\"\n\n\"Well, she _seems_ to feel what she says,\" Mrs. Rooth piously risked.\n\n\"She has some stiff things to say. I mean about her past,\" Basil\nDashwood remarked. \"The past--the dreadful past--on the stage!\"\n\n\"Wait till the end, to see how she comes out. We must all be merciful!\"\nsighed Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"We've seen it before; you know what happens,\" Miriam observed to her\nmother.\n\n\"I've seen so many I get them mixed.\"\n\n\"Yes, they're all in queer predicaments. Poor old mother--what we show\nyou!\" laughed the girl.\n\n\"Ah it will be what _you_ show me--something noble and wise!\"\n\n\"I want to do this; it's a magnificent part,\" said Miriam.\n\n\"You couldn't put it on in London--they wouldn't swallow it,\" Basil\nDashwood declared.\n\n\"Aren't there things they do there to get over the difficulties?\" the\ngirl inquired.\n\n\"You can't get over what _she did_!\"--her companion had a rueful\ngrimace.\n\n\"Yes, we must pay, we must expiate!\" Mrs. Rooth moaned as the curtain\nrose again.\n\nWhen the second act was over our friends passed out of their _baignoire_\ninto those corridors of tribulation where the bristling _ouvreuse_, like\na pawnbroker driving a roaring trade, mounts guard upon piles of\nheterogeneous clothing, and, gaining the top of the fine staircase which\nforms the state entrance and connects the statued vestibule of the\nbasement with the grand tier of boxes, opened an ambiguous door composed\nof little mirrors and found themselves in the society of the initiated.\nThe janitors were courteous folk who greeted Sherringham as an\nacquaintance, and he had no difficulty in marshalling his little troop\ntoward the foyer. They traversed a low, curving lobby, hung with\npictures and furnished with velvet-covered benches where several\nunrecognised persons of both sexes looked at them without hostility, and\narrived at an opening, on the right, from which, by a short flight of\nsteps, there was a descent to one of the wings of the stage. Here\nMiriam paused, in silent excitement, like a young warrior arrested by a\nglimpse of the battle-field. Her vision was carried off through a lane\nof light to the point of vantage from which the actor held the house;\nbut there was a hushed guard over the place and curiosity could only\nglance and pass.\n\nThen she came with her companions to a sort of parlour with a polished\nfloor, not large and rather vacant, where her attention flew delightedly\nto a coat-tree, in a corner, from which three or four dresses were\nsuspended--dresses she immediately perceived to be costumes in that\nnight's play--accompanied by a saucer of something and a much-worn\npowder-puff casually left on a sofa. This was a familiar note in the\ngeneral impression of high decorum which had begun at the threshold--a\nsense of majesty in the place. Miriam rushed at the powder-puff--there\nwas no one in the room--snatched it up and gazed at it with droll\nveneration, then stood rapt a moment before the charming petticoats\n(\"That's Dunoyer's first underskirt,\" she said to her mother) while\nSherringham explained that in this apartment an actress traditionally\nchanged her gown when the transaction was simple enough to save the long\nascent to her _loge_. He felt himself a cicerone showing a church to a\nparty of provincials; and indeed there was a grave hospitality in the\nair, mingled with something academic and important, the tone of an\ninstitution, a temple, which made them all, out of respect and delicacy,\nhold their breath a little and tread the shining floors with discretion.\n\nThese precautions increased--Mrs. Rooth crept about like a friendly but\nundomesticated cat--after they entered the foyer itself, a square,\nspacious saloon covered with pictures and relics and draped in official\ngreen velvet, where the _genius loci_ holds a reception every night in\nthe year. The effect was freshly charming to Peter; he was fond of the\nplace, always saw it again with pleasure, enjoyed its honourable look\nand the way, among the portraits and scrolls, the records of a splendid\nhistory, the green velvet and the waxed floors, the _genius loci_ seemed\nto be \"at home\" in the quiet lamplight. At the end of the room, in an\nample chimney, blazed a fire of logs. Miriam said nothing; they looked\nabout, noting that most of the portraits and pictures were\n\"old-fashioned,\" and Basil Dashwood expressed disappointment at the\nabsence of all the people they wanted most to see. Three or four\ngentlemen in evening dress circulated slowly, looking, like themselves,\nat the pictures, and another gentleman stood before a lady, with whom he\nwas in conversation, seated against the wall. The foyer resembled in\nthese conditions a ball-room, cleared for the dance, before the guests\nor the music had arrived.\n\n\"Oh it's enough to see _this_; it makes my heart beat,\" said Miriam.\n\"It's full of the vanished past, it makes me cry. I feel them here, all,\nthe great artists I shall never see. Think of Rachel--look at her grand\nportrait there!--and how she stood on these very boards and trailed over\nthem the robes of Hermione and Ph\u00c3\u00a8dre.\" The girl broke out theatrically,\nas on the spot was right, not a bit afraid of her voice as soon as it\nrolled through the room; appealing to her companions as they stood under\nthe chandelier and making the other persons present, who had already\ngiven her some attention, turn round to stare at so unusual a specimen\nof the English miss. She laughed, musically, when she noticed this, and\nher mother, scandalised, begged her to lower her tone. \"It's all right.\nI produce an effect,\" said Miriam: \"it shan't be said that I too haven't\nhad my little success in the maison de Moli\u00c3\u00a8re.\" And Sherringham\nrepeated that it was all right--the place was familiar with mirth and\npassion, there was often wonderful talk there, and it was only the\nsetting that was still and solemn. It happened that this evening--there\nwas no knowing in advance--the scene was not characteristically\nbrilliant; but to confirm his assertion, at the moment he spoke,\nMademoiselle Dunoyer, who was also in the play, came into the room\nattended by a pair of gentlemen.\n\nShe was the celebrated, the perpetual, the necessary _ing\u00c3\u00a9nue_, who with\nall her talent couldn't have represented a woman of her actual age. She\nhad the gliding, hopping movement of a small bird, the same air of\nhaving nothing to do with time, and the clear, sure, piercing note, a\nmiracle of exact vocalisation. She chaffed her companions, she chaffed\nthe room; she might have been a very clever little girl trying to\npersonate a more innocent big one. She scattered her amiability\nabout--showing Miriam how the children of Moli\u00c3\u00a8re took their ease--and\nit quickly placed her in the friendliest communication with Peter\nSherringham, who already enjoyed her acquaintance and who now extended\nit to his companions, and in particular to the young lady _sur le point\nd'entrer au th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre._\n\n\"You deserve a happier lot,\" said the actress, looking up at Miriam\nbrightly, as if to a great height, and taking her in; upon which\nSherringham left them together a little and led Mrs. Rooth and young\nDashwood to consider further some of the pictures.\n\n\"Most delightful, most curious,\" the old woman murmured about\neverything; while Basil Dashwood exclaimed in the presence of most of\nthe portraits: \"But their ugliness--their ugliness: did you ever see\nsuch a collection of hideous people? And those who were supposed to be\ngood-looking--the beauties of the past--they're worse than the others.\nAh you may say what you will, _nous sommes mieux que \u00c3\u00a7a_!\" Sherringham\nsuspected him of irritation, of not liking the theatre of the great\nrival nation to be thrust down his throat. They returned to Miriam and\nMademoiselle Dunoyer, and Peter asked the actress a question about one\nof the portraits to which there was no name attached. She replied, like\na child who had only played about the room, that she was _toute\nhonteuse_ not to be able to tell him the original: she had forgotten,\nshe had never asked--\"_Vous allez me trouver bien l\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a8re_!\" She appealed\nto the other persons present, who formed a gallery for her, and laughed\nin delightful ripples at their suggestions, which she covered with\nridicule. She bestirred herself; she declared she would ascertain, she\nshouldn't be happy till she did, and swam out of the room, with the\nprettiest paddles, to obtain the information, leaving behind her a\nperfume of delicate kindness and gaiety. She seemed above all things\nobliging, and Peter pronounced her almost as natural off the stage as\non. She didn't come back.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nWhether he had prearranged it is more than I can say, but Mademoiselle\nVoisin delayed so long to show herself that Mrs. Rooth, who wished to\nsee the rest of the play, though she had sat it out on another occasion,\nexpressed a returning relish for her corner of the _baignoire_ and gave\nher conductor the best pretext he could have desired for asking Basil\nDashwood to be so good as to escort her back. When the young actor, of\nwhose personal preference Peter was quite aware, had led Mrs. Rooth away\nwith an absence of moroseness which showed that his striking resemblance\nto a gentleman was not kept for the footlights, the two others sat on a\ndivan in the part of the room furthest from the entrance, so that it\ngave them a degree of privacy, and Miriam watched the coming and going\nof their fellow-visitors and the indefinite people, attached to the\ntheatre, hanging about, while her companion gave a name to some of the\nfigures, Parisian celebrities.\n\n\"Fancy poor Dashwood cooped up there with mamma!\" the girl exclaimed\nwhimsically.\n\n\"You're awfully cruel to him; but that's of course,\" said Sherringham.\n\n\"It seems to me I'm as kind as you; you sent him off.\"\n\n\"That was for your mother; she was tired.\"\n\n\"Oh gammon! And why, if I _were_ cruel, should it be of course?\"\n\n\"Because you must destroy and torment and wear out--that's your nature.\nBut you can't help your type, can you?\"\n\n\"My type?\" she echoed.\n\n\"It's bad, perverse, dangerous. It's essentially insolent.\"\n\n\"And pray what's yours when you talk like that? Would you say such\nthings if you didn't know the depths of my good nature?\"\n\n\"Your good nature all comes back to that,\" said Sherringham. \"It's an\nabyss of ruin--for others. You've no respect. I'm speaking of the\nartistic character--in the direction and in the plentitude in which you\nhave it. It's unscrupulous, nervous, capricious, wanton.\"\n\n\"I don't know about respect. One can be good,\" Miriam mused and\nreasoned.\n\n\"It doesn't matter so long as one's powerful,\" he returned. \"We can't\nhave everything, and surely we ought to understand that we must pay for\nthings. A splendid organisation for a special end, like yours, is so\nrare and rich and fine that we oughtn't to grudge it its conditions.\"\n\n\"What do you call its conditions?\" Miriam asked as she turned and looked\nat him.\n\n\"Oh the need to take its ease, to take up space, to make itself at home\nin the world, to square its elbows and knock, others about. That's large\nand free; it's the good nature you speak of. You must forage and ravage\nand leave a track behind you; you must live upon the country you\ntraverse. And you give such delight that, after all, you're\nwelcome--you're infinitely welcome!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean. I only care for the idea,\" the girl said.\n\n\"That's exactly what I pretend--and we must all help you to it. You use\nus, you push us about, you break us up. We're your tables and chair, the\nsimple furniture of your life.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean by 'we'?\"\n\nPeter gave an ironic laugh. \"Oh don't be afraid--there will be plenty of\nothers!\"\n\nShe made no return to this, but after a moment broke out again. \"Poor\nDashwood immured with mamma--he's like a lame chair that one has put\ninto the corner.\"\n\n\"Don't break him up before he has served. I really believe something\nwill come out of him,\" her companion went on. \"However, you'll break me\nup first,\" he added, \"and him probably never at all.\"\n\n\"And why shall I honour you so much more?\"\n\n\"Because I'm a better article and you'll feel that.\"\n\n\"You've the superiority of modesty--I see.\"\n\n\"I'm better than a young mountebank--I've vanity enough to say that.\"\n\nShe turned on him with a flush in her cheek and a splendid dramatic\nface. \"How you hate us! Yes, at bottom, below your little cold taste,\nyou _hate_ us!\" she repeated.\n\nHe coloured too, met her eyes, looked into them a minute, seemed to\naccept the imputation and then said quickly: \"Give it up: come away with\nme.\"\n\n\"Come away with you?\"\n\n\"Leave this place. Give it up.\"\n\n\"You brought me here, you insisted it should be only you, and now you\nmust stay,\" she declared with a head-shake and a high manner. \"You\nshould know what you want, dear Mr. Sherringham.\"\n\n\"I do--I know now. Come away before you see her.\"\n\n\"Before----?\" she seemed to wonder.\n\n\"She's success, this wonderful Voisin, she's triumph, she's full\naccomplishment: the hard, brilliant realisation of what I want to avert\nfor you.\" Miriam looked at him in silence, the cold light still in her\nface, and he repeated: \"Give it up--give it up.\"\n\nHer eyes softened after a little; she smiled and then said: \"Yes, you're\nbetter than poor Dashwood.\"\n\n\"Give it up and we'll live for ourselves, in ourselves, in something\nthat can have a sanctity.\"\n\n\"All the same you do hate us,\" the girl went on.\n\n\"I don't want to be conceited, but I mean that I'm sufficiently fine and\ncomplicated to tempt you. I'm an expensive modern watch with a wonderful\nescapement--therefore you'll smash me if you can.\"\n\n\"Never--never!\" she said as she got up. \"You tell me the hour too well.\"\nShe quitted her companion and stood looking at G\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me's fine portrait of\nthe pale Rachel invested with the antique attributes of tragedy. The\nrise of the curtain had drawn away most of the company. Peter, from his\nbench, watched his friend a little, turning his eyes from her to the\nvivid image of the dead actress and thinking how little she suffered by\nthe juxtaposition. Presently he came over and joined her again and she\nresumed: \"I wonder if that's what your cousin had in his mind.\"\n\n\"My cousin----?\"\n\n\"What was his name? Mr. Dormer; that first day at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's. He\noffered to paint my portrait.\"\n\n\"I remember. I put him up to it.\"\n\n\"Was he thinking of this?\"\n\n\"I doubt if he has ever seen it. I daresay I was.\"\n\n\"Well, when we go to London he must do it,\" said Miriam.\n\n\"Oh there's no hurry,\" Peter was moved to reply.\n\n\"Don't you want my picture?\" asked the girl with one of her successful\ntouches.\n\n\"I'm not sure I want it from _him_. I don't know quite what he'd make of\nyou.\"\n\n\"He looked so clever--I liked him. I saw him again at your party.\"\n\n\"He's a jolly good fellow; but what's one to say,\" Peter put to her, \"of\na painter who goes for his inspiration to the House of Commons?\"\n\n\"To the House of Commons?\" she echoed.\n\n\"He has lately got himself elected.\"\n\n\"Dear me, what a pity! I wanted to sit for him. But perhaps he won't\nhave me--as I'm not a member of Parliament.\"\n\n\"It's my sister, rather, who has got him in.\"\n\n\"Your sister who was at your house that day? What has she to do with\nit?\" Miriam asked.\n\n\"Why she's his cousin just as I am. And in addition,\" Sherringham went\non, \"she's to be married to him.\"\n\n\"Married--really?\" She had a pause, but she continued. \"So he paints\n_her_, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not much, probably. His talent in that line isn't what she esteems in\nhim most.\"\n\n\"It isn't great, then?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea.\"\n\n\"And in the political line?\" the girl persisted.\n\n\"I scarcely can tell. He's very clever.\"\n\n\"He does paint decently, then?\"\n\n\"I daresay.\"\n\nMiriam looked once more at G\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me's picture. \"Fancy his going into the\nHouse of Commons! And your sister put him there?\"\n\n\"She worked, she canvassed.\"\n\n\"Ah you're a queer family!\" she sighed, turning round at the sound of a\nstep.\n\n\"We're lost--here's Mademoiselle Voisin,\" said Sherringham.\n\nThis celebrity presented herself smiling and addressing Miriam. \"I acted\nfor _you_ to-night--I did my best.\"\n\n\"What a pleasure to speak to you, to thank you!\" the girl murmured\nadmiringly. She was startled and dazzled.\n\n\"I couldn't come to you before, but now I've got a rest--for half an\nhour,\" the actress went on. Gracious and passive, as if a little spent,\nshe let Sherringham, without looking at him, take her hand and raise it\nto his lips. \"I'm sorry I make you lose the others--they're so good in\nthis act,\" she added.\n\n\"We've seen them before and there's nothing so good as you,\" Miriam\npromptly returned.\n\n\"I like my part,\" said Mademoiselle Voisin gently, smiling still at our\nyoung lady with clear, charming eyes. \"One's always better in that\ncase.\"\n\n\"She's so bad sometimes, you know!\" Peter jested to Miriam; leading the\nactress thus to glance at him, kindly and vaguely, in a short silence\nwhich you couldn't call on her part embarrassment, but which was still\nless affectation.\n\n\"And it's so interesting to be here--so interesting!\" Miriam protested.\n\n\"Ah you like our old house? Yes, we're very proud of it.\" And\nMademoiselle Voisin smiled again at Sherringham all good-humouredly, but\nas if to say: \"Well, here I am, and what do you want of me? Don't ask me\nto invent it myself, but if you'll tell me I'll do it.\" Miriam admired\nthe note of discreet interrogation in her voice--the slight suggestion\nof surprise at their \"old house\" being liked. This performer was an\nastonishment from her seeming still more perfect on a nearer view--which\nwas not, the girl had an idea, what performers usually did. This was\nvery encouraging to her--it widened the programme of a young lady about\nto embrace the scenic career. To have so much to show before the\nfootlights and yet to have so much left when you came off--that was\nreally wonderful. Mademoiselle Voisin's eyes, as one looked into them,\nwere still more agreeable than the distant spectator would have\nsupposed; and there was in her appearance an extreme finish which\ninstantly suggested to Miriam that she herself, in comparison, was big\nand rough and coarse.\n\n\"You're lovely to-night--you're particularly lovely,\" Sherringham said\nvery frankly, translating Miriam's own impression and at the same time\ngiving her an illustration of the way that, in Paris at least, gentlemen\nexpressed themselves to the stars of the drama. She thought she knew her\ncompanion very well and had been witness of the degree to which, in such\ngeneral conditions, his familiarity could increase; but his address to\nthe slim, distinguished, harmonious woman before them had a different\nquality, the note of a special usage. If Miriam had had an apprehension\nthat such directness might be taken as excessive it was removed by the\nmanner in which Mademoiselle Voisin returned:\n\n\"Oh one's always well enough when one's made up; one's always exactly\nthe same.\" That served as an example of the good taste with which a star\nof the drama could receive homage that was wanting in originality.\nMiriam determined on the spot that this should be the way _she_ would\never receive it. The grace of her new acquaintance was the greater as\nthe becoming bloom to which she alluded as artificial was the result of\na science so consummate that it had none of the grossness of a mask. The\nperception of all this was exciting to our young aspirant, and her\nexcitement relieved itself in the inquiry, which struck her as rude as\nsoon as she had uttered it:\n\n\"You acted for 'me'? How did you know? What am I to you?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Sherringham has told me about you. He says we're nothing\nbeside you--that you're to be the great star of the future. I'm proud\nthat you've seen me.\"\n\n\"That of course is what I tell every one,\" Peter acknowledged a trifle\nawkwardly to Miriam.\n\n\"I can believe it when I see you. _Je vous ai bien observ\u00c3\u00a9e_,\" the\nactress continued in her sweet conciliatory tone.\n\nMiriam looked from one of her interlocutors to the other as if there\nwere joy for her in this report of Sherringham's remarks--joy\naccompanied and partly mitigated, however, by a quicker vision of what\nmight have passed between a secretary of embassy and a creature so\nexquisite as Mademoiselle Voisin. \"Ah you're wonderful people--a most\ninteresting impression!\" she yearningly sighed.\n\n\"I was looking for you; he had prepared me. We're such old friends!\"\nsaid the actress in a tone courteously exempt from intention: upon which\nSherringham, again taking her hand, raised it to his lips with a\ntenderness which her whole appearance seemed to bespeak for her, a sort\nof practical consideration and carefulness of touch, as if she were an\nobject precious and frail, an instrument for producing rare sounds, to\nbe handled, like a legendary violin, with a recognition of its value.\n\n\"Your dressing-room is so pretty--show her your dressing-room,\" he went\non.\n\n\"Willingly, if she'll come up. _Vous savez que c'est une mont\u00c3\u00a9e.\"_\n\n\"It's a shame to inflict it on _you_,\" Miriam objected.\n\n\"_Comment donc?_ If it will interest you in the least!\" They exchanged\ncivilities, almost caresses, trying which could have the nicest manner\nto the other. It was the actress's manner that struck Miriam most; it\ndenoted such a training, so much taste, expressed such a ripe conception\nof urbanity.\n\n\"No wonder she acts well when she has that tact--feels, perceives, is so\nremarkable, _mon Dieu, mon Dieu!\"_ the girl said to herself as they\nfollowed their conductress into another corridor and up a wide, plain\nstaircase. The staircase was spacious and long and this part of the\nestablishment sombre and still, with the gravity of a college or a\nconvent. They reached another passage lined with little doors, on each\nof which the name of a comedian was painted, and here the aspect became\nstill more monastic, like that of a row of solitary cells. Mademoiselle\nVoisin led the way to her own door all obligingly and as if wishing to\nbe hospitable; she dropped little subdued, friendly attempts at\nexplanation on the way. At her threshold the monasticism stopped--Miriam\nfound herself in a wonderfully upholstered nook, a nest of lamplight and\ndelicate cretonne. Save for its pair of long glasses it might have been\na tiny boudoir, with a water-colour drawing of value in each of its\npanels of stretched stuff, with its crackling fire and its charming\norder. It was intensely bright and extremely hot, singularly pretty and\nexempt from litter. Nothing lay about, but a small draped doorway led\ninto an inner sanctuary. To Miriam it seemed royal; it immediately made\nthe art of the comedian the most distinguished thing in the world. It\nwas just such a place as they _should_ have for their intervals if they\nwere expected to be great artists. It was a result of the same evolution\nas Mademoiselle Voisin herself--not that our young lady found this\nparticular term at hand to express her idea. But her mind was flooded\nwith an impression of style, of refinement, of the long continuity of a\ntradition. The actress said, _\"Voil\u00c3\u00a0, c'est tout!\"_ as if it were little\nenough and there were even something clumsy in her having brought them\nso far for nothing, and in their all sitting there waiting and looking\nat each other till it was time for her to change her dress. But to\nMiriam it was occupation enough to note what she did and said: these\nthings and her whole person and carriage struck our young woman as\nexquisite in their adaptation to the particular occasion. She had had an\nidea that foreign actresses were rather of the _cabotin_ order, but her\nhostess suggested to her much more a princess than a _cabotine_. She\nwould do things as she liked and do them straight off: Miriam couldn't\nfancy her in the gropings and humiliations of rehearsal. Everything in\nher had been sifted and formed, her tone was perfect, her amiability\ncomplete, and she might have been the charming young wife of a secretary\nof state receiving a pair of strangers of distinction. The girl observed\nall her movements. And then, as Sherringham had said, she was\nparticularly lovely. But she suddenly told this gentleman that she must\nput him _\u00c3\u00a0 la porte_--she wanted to change her dress. He retired and\nreturned to the foyer, where Miriam was to rejoin him after remaining\nthe few minutes more with Mademoiselle Voisin and coming down with her.\nHe waited for his companion, walking up and down and making up his mind;\nand when she presently came in he said to her:\n\n\"Please don't go back for the rest of the play. Stay here.\" They now had\nthe foyer virtually to themselves.\n\n\"I want to stay here. I like it better,\" She moved back to the\nchimney-piece, from above which the cold portrait of Rachel looked down,\nand as he accompanied her he went on:\n\n\"I meant what I said just now.\"\n\n\"What you said to Voisin?\"\n\n\"No, no; to you. Give it up and live with _me.\"_\n\n\"Give it up?\" She turned her stage face on him.\n\n\"Give it up and I'll marry you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"This is a happy time to ask it!\" she said with superior amusement. \"And\nthis is a good place!\"\n\n\"Very good indeed, and that's why I speak: it's a place to make one\nchoose--it puts it all before one.\"\n\n\"To make _you_ choose, you mean. I'm much obliged, but that's not my\nchoice,\" laughed Miriam.\n\n\"You shall be anything you like except this.\"\n\n\"Except what I most want to be? I _am_ much obliged.\"\n\n\"Don't you care for me? Haven't you any gratitude?\" Sherringham\ninsisted.\n\n\"Gratitude for kindly removing the blest cup from my lips? I want to be\nwhat _she_ is--I want it more than ever.\"\n\n\"Ah what she is--!\" He took it impatiently.\n\n\"Do you mean I can't? Well see if I can't. Tell me more about her--tell\nme everything.\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen for yourself and, knowing things as you do, can't you\njudge?\"\n\n\"She's strange, she's mysterious,\" Miriam allowed, looking at the fire.\n\"She showed us nothing--nothing of her real self.\"\n\n\"So much the better, all things considered.\"\n\n\"Are there all sorts of other things in her life? That's what I\nbelieve,\" the girl went on, raising her eyes to him.\n\n\"I can't tell you what there is in the life of such a woman.\"\n\n\"Imagine--when she's so perfect!\" she exclaimed thoughtfully. \"Ah she\nkept me off--she kept me off! Her charming manner is in itself a kind\nof contempt. It's an abyss--it's the wall of China. She has a hard\npolish, an inimitable surface, like some wonderful porcelain that costs\nmore than you'd think.\"\n\n\"Do you want to become like that?\" Sherringham asked.\n\n\"If I could I should be enchanted. One can always try.\"\n\n\"You must act better than she,\" he went on.\n\n\"Better? I thought you wanted me to give it up.\"\n\n\"Ah I don't know what I want,\" he cried, \"and you torment me and turn me\ninside out! What I want is you yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh don't worry,\" said Miriam--now all kindly. Then she added that\nMademoiselle Voisin had invited her to \"call\"; to which Sherringham\nreplied with a certain dryness that she would probably not find that\nnecessary. This made the girl stare and she asked: \"Do you mean it won't\ndo on account of mamma's prejudices?\"\n\n\"Say this time on account of mine.\"\n\n\"Do you mean because she has lovers?\"\n\n\"Her lovers are none of our business.\"\n\n\"None of mine, I see. So you've been one of them?\"\n\n\"No such luck!\"\n\n\"What a pity!\" she richly wailed. \"I should have liked to see that. One\nmust see everything--to be able to do everything.\" And as he pressed for\nwhat in particular she had wished to see she replied: \"The way a woman\nlike that receives one of the old ones.\"\n\nPeter gave a groan at this, which was at the same time partly a laugh,\nand, turning away to drop on a bench, ejaculated: \"You'll do--you'll\ndo!\"\n\nHe sat there some minutes with his elbows on his knees and his face in\nhis hands. His friend remained looking at the portrait of Rachel, after\nwhich she put to him: \"Doesn't such a woman as that receive--receive\nevery one?\"\n\n\"Every one who goes to see her, no doubt.\"\n\n\"And who goes?\"\n\n\"Lots of men--clever men, eminent men.\"\n\n\"Ah what a charming life! Then doesn't she go out?\"\n\n\"Not what we Philistines mean by that--not into society, never. She\nnever enters a lady's drawing-room.\"\n\n\"How strange, when one's as distinguished as that; except that she must\nescape a lot of stupidities and _corv\u00c3\u00a9es_. Then where does she learn\nsuch manners?\"\n\n\"She teaches manners, _\u00c3\u00a0 ses heures_: she doesn't need to learn them.\"\n\n\"Oh she has given me ideas! But in London actresses go into society,\"\nMiriam continued.\n\n\"Oh into ours, such as it is. In London _nous m\u00c3\u00aalons les genres_.\"\n\n\"And shan't I go--I mean if I want?\"\n\n\"You'll have every facility to bore yourself. Don't doubt it.\"\n\n\"And doesn't she feel excluded?\" Miriam asked.\n\n\"Excluded from what? She has the fullest life.\"\n\n\"The fullest?\"\n\n\"An intense artistic life. The cleverest men in Paris talk over her work\nwith her; the principal authors of plays discuss with her subjects and\ncharacters and questions of treatment. She lives in the world of art.\"\n\n\"Ah the world of art--how I envy her! And you offer me Dashwood!\"\n\nSherringham rose in his emotion. \"I 'offer' you--?\"\n\nMiriam burst out laughing. \"You look so droll! You offer me yourself,\nthen, instead of all these things.\"\n\n\"My dear child, I also am a very clever man,\" he said, trying to sink\nhis consciousness of having for a moment stood gaping.\n\n\"You are--you are; I delight in you. No ladies at all--no _femmes comme\nil faut?\"_ she began again.\n\n\"Ah what do _they_ matter? Your business is the artistic life!\" he broke\nout with inconsequence, irritated, moreover, at hearing her sound that\ntrivial note again.\n\n\"You're a dear--your charming good sense comes back to you! What do you\nwant of me, then?\"\n\n\"I want you for myself--not for others; and now, in time, before\nanything's done.\"\n\n\"Why, then, did you bring me here? Everything's done--I feel it\nto-night.\"\n\n\"I know the way you should look at it--if you do look at it at all,\"\nSherringham conceded.\n\n\"That's so easy! I thought you liked the stage so,\" Miriam artfully\nadded.\n\n\"Don't you want me to be a great swell?\"\n\n\"And don't you want _me_ to be?\"\n\n\"You _will_ be--you'll share my glory.\"\n\n\"So will you share mine.\"\n\n\"The husband of an actress? Yes, I see myself that!\" Peter cried with a\nfrank ring of disgust.\n\n\"It's a silly position, no doubt. But if you're too good for it why talk\nabout it? Don't you think I'm important?\" she demanded. Her companion\nmet her eyes and she suddenly said in a different tone: \"Ah why should\nwe quarrel when you've been so kind, so generous? Can't we always be\nfriends--the truest friends?\"\n\nHer voice sank to the sweetest cadence and her eyes were grateful and\ngood as they rested on him. She sometimes said things with such\nperfection that they seemed dishonest, but in this case he was stirred\nto an expressive response. Just as he was making it, however, he was\nmoved to utter other words: \"Take care, here's Dashwood!\" Mrs. Rooth's\ntried attendant was in the doorway. He had come back to say that they\nreally must relieve him.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nMrs. Dallow came up to London soon after the meeting of Parliament; she\nmade no secret of the fact that she was fond of \"town\" and that in\npresent conditions it would of course not have become less attractive to\nher. But she prepared to retreat again for the Easter vacation, not to\ngo back to Harsh, but to pay a couple of country visits. She did not,\nhowever, depart with the crowd--she never did anything with the\ncrowd--but waited till the Monday after Parliament rose; facing with\ncomposure, in Great Stanhope Street, the horrors, as she had been taught\nto consider them, of a Sunday out of the session. She had done what she\ncould to mitigate them by asking a handful of \"stray men\" to dine with\nher that evening. Several members of this disconsolate class sought\ncomfort in Great Stanhope Street in the afternoon, and them for the most\npart she also invited to return at eight o'clock. There were accordingly\nalmost too many people at dinner; there were even a couple of wives.\nNick Dormer was then present, though he had not been in the afternoon.\nEach of the other persons had said on coming in, \"So you've not\ngone--I'm awfully glad.\" Mrs. Dallow had replied, \"No, I've not gone,\"\nbut she had in no case added that she was glad, nor had she offered an\nexplanation. She never offered explanations; she always assumed that no\none could invent them so well as those who had the florid taste to\ndesire them.\n\nAnd in this case she was right, since it is probable that few of her\nvisitors failed to say to themselves that her not having gone would have\nhad something to do with Dormer. That could pass for an explanation with\nmany of Mrs. Dallow's friends, who as a general thing were not morbidly\nanalytic; especially with those who met Nick as a matter of course at\ndinner. His figuring at this lady's entertainments, being in her house\nwhenever a candle was lighted, was taken as a sign that there was\nsomething rather particular between them. Nick had said to her more than\nonce that people would wonder why they didn't marry; but he was wrong in\nthis, inasmuch as there were many of their friends to whom it wouldn't\nhave occurred that his position could be improved. That they were\ncousins was a fact not so evident to others as to themselves, in\nconsequence of which they appeared remarkably intimate. The person\nseeing clearest in the matter was Mrs. Gresham, who lived so much in the\nworld that being left now and then to one's own company had become her\nidea of true sociability. She knew very well that if she had been\nprivately engaged to a young man as amiable as Nick Dormer she would\nhave managed that publicity shouldn't play such a part in their\nintercourse; and she had her secret scorn for the stupidity of people\nwhose conception of Nick's relation to Julia rested on the fact that he\nwas always included in her parties. \"If he never was there they might\ntalk,\" she said to herself. But Mrs. Gresham was supersubtle. To her it\nwould have appeared natural that her friend should celebrate the\nparliamentary recess by going down to Harsh and securing the young man's\npresence there for a fortnight; she recognised Mrs. Dallow's actual plan\nas a comparatively poor substitute--the project of spending the\nholidays in other people's houses, to which Nick had also promised to\ncome. Mrs. Gresham was romantic; she wondered what was the good of mere\nsnippets and snatches, the chances that any one might have, when large,\nstill days _\u00c3\u00a0 deux_ were open to you--chances of which half the sanctity\nwas in what they excluded. However, there were more unsettled matters\nbetween Mrs. Dallow and her queer kinsman than even Mrs. Gresham's fine\ninsight could embrace. She was not on the Sunday evening before Easter\namong the guests in Great Stanhope Street; but if she had been Julia's\nsingular indifference to observation would have stopped short of\nencouraging her to remain in the drawing-room, along with Nick, after\nthe others had gone. I may add that Mrs. Gresham's extreme curiosity\nwould have emboldened her as little to do so. She would have taken for\ngranted that the pair wished to be alone together, though she would have\nregarded this only as a snippet. The company had at all events stayed\nlate, and it was nearly twelve o'clock when the last of them, standing\nbefore the fire in the room they had quitted, broke out to his\ncompanion:\n\n\"See here, Julia, how long do you really expect me to endure this kind\nof thing?\" Julia made him no answer; she only leaned back in her chair\nwith her eyes upon his. He met her gaze a moment; then he turned round\nto the fire and for another moment looked into it. After this he faced\nhis hostess again with the exclamation: \"It's so foolish--it's so\ndamnably foolish!\"\n\nShe still said nothing, but at the end of a minute she spoke without\nanswering him. \"I shall expect you on Tuesday, and I hope you'll come by\na decent train.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a decent train?\"\n\n\"I mean I hope you'll not leave it till the last thing before dinner, so\nthat we can have a little walk or something.\"\n\n\"What's a little walk or something? Why, if you make such a point of my\ncoming to Griffin, do you want me to come at all?\"\n\nShe hesitated an instant; then she returned; \"I knew you hated it!\"\n\n\"You provoke me so,\" said Nick. \"You try to, I think.\"\n\n\"And Severals is still worse. You'll get out of that if you can,\" Mrs.\nDallow went on.\n\n\"If I can? What's to prevent me?\"\n\n\"You promised Lady Whiteroy. But of course that's nothing.\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw for Lady Whiteroy.\"\n\n\"And you promised me. But that's less still.\"\n\n\"It _is_ foolish--it's quite idiotic,\" said Nick with his hands in his\npockets and his eyes on the ceiling.\n\nThere was another silence, at the end of which Julia remarked: \"You\nmight have answered Mr. Macgeorge when he spoke to you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Macgeorge--what has he to do with it?\"\n\n\"He has to do with your getting on a little. If you think that's the\nway--!\"\n\nNick broke into a laugh. \"I like lessons in getting on--in other words I\nsuppose you mean in urbanity--from you, Julia!\"\n\n\"Why not from me?\"\n\n\"Because you can do nothing base. You're incapable of putting on a\nflattering manner to get something by it: therefore why should you\nexpect me to? You're unflattering--that is, you're austere--in\nproportion as there may be something to be got.\"\n\nShe sprang from her chair, coming toward him. \"There's only one thing I\nwant in the world--you know very well.\"\n\n\"Yes, you want it so much that you won't even take it when it's pressed\non you. How long do you seriously expect me to bear it?\" Nick repeated.\n\n\"I never asked you to do anything base,\" she said as she stood in front\nof him. \"If I'm not clever about throwing myself into things it's all\nthe more reason you should be.\"\n\n\"If you're not clever, my dear Julia--?\" Nick, close to her, placed his\nhands on her shoulders and shook her with a mixture of tenderness and\npassion. \"You're clever enough to make me furious, sometimes!\"\n\nShe opened and closed her fan looking down at it while she submitted to\nhis mild violence. \"All I want is that when a man like Mr. Macgeorge\ntalks to you you shouldn't appear bored to death. You used to be so\ncharming under those inflictions. Now you appear to take no interest in\nanything. At dinner to-night you scarcely opened your lips; you treated\nthem all as if you only wished they'd go.\"\n\n\"I did wish they'd go. Haven't I told you a hundred times what I think\nof your salon?\"\n\n\"How then do you want me to live?\" she asked. \"Am I not to have a\ncreature in the house?\"\n\n\"As many creatures as you like. Your freedom's complete and, as far as\nI'm concerned, always will be. Only when you challenge me and overhaul\nme--not justly, I think--I must confess the simple truth, that there are\nmany of your friends I don't delight in.\"\n\n\"Oh _your_ idea of pleasant people!\" Julia lamented. \"I should like once\nfor all to know what it really is.\"\n\n\"I can tell you what it really isn't: it isn't Mr. Macgeorge. He's a\nbeing almost grotesquely limited.\"\n\n\"He'll be where you'll never be--unless you change.\"\n\n\"To be where Mr. Macgeorge is not would be very much my desire.\nTherefore why should I change?\" Nick demanded. \"However, I hadn't the\nleast intention of being rude to him, and I don't think I was,\" he went\non. \"To the best of my ability I assume a virtue if I haven't it; but\napparently I'm not enough of a comedian.\"\n\n\"If you haven't it?\" she echoed. \"It's when you say things like that\nthat you're so dreadfully tiresome. As if there were anything that you\nhaven't or mightn't have!\"\n\nNick turned away from her; he took a few impatient steps in the room,\nlooking at the carpet, his hands always in his pockets. Then he came\nback to the fire with the observation: \"It's rather hard to be found so\nwanting when one has tried to play one's part so beautifully.\" He paused\nwith his eyes on her own and then went on with a vibration in his voice:\n\"I've imperilled my immortal soul, or at least bemuddled my\nintelligence, by all the things I don't care for that I've tried to do,\nand all the things I detest that I've tried to be, and all the things I\nnever can be that I've tried to look as if I were--all the appearances\nand imitations, the pretences and hypocrisies in which I've steeped\nmyself to the eyes; and at the end of it (it serves me right!) my reward\nis simply to learn that I'm still not half humbug enough!\"\n\nJulia looked away from him as soon as he had spoken these words; she\nattached her eyes to the clock behind him and observed irrelevantly:\n\"I'm very sorry, but I think you had better go. I don't like you to stay\nafter midnight.\"\n\n\"Ah what you like and what you don't like, and where one begins and the\nother ends--all that's an impenetrable mystery!\" the young man\ndeclared. But he took no further notice of her allusion to his\ndeparture, adding in a different tone: \"'A man like Mr. Macgeorge'! When\nyou say a thing of that sort in a certain, particular way I should\nrather like to suffer you to perish.\"\n\nMrs. Dallow stared; it might have seemed for an instant that she was\ntrying to look stupid. \"How can I help it if a few years hence he's\ncertain to be at the head of any Liberal Government?\"\n\n\"We can't help it of course, but we can help talking about it,\" Nick\nsmiled. \"If we don't mention it it mayn't be noticed.\"\n\n\"You're trying to make me angry. You're in one of your vicious moods,\"\nshe returned, blowing out on the chimney-piece a guttering candle.\n\n\"That I'm exasperated I've already had the honour very positively to\ninform you. All the same I maintain that I was irreproachable at dinner.\nI don't want you to think I shall always be as good as that.\"\n\n\"You looked so out of it; you were as gloomy as if every earthly hope\nhad left you, and you didn't make a single contribution to any\ndiscussion that took place. Don't you think I observe you?\" she asked\nwith an irony tempered by a tenderness unsuccessfully concealed.\n\n\"Ah my darling, what you observe--!\" Nick cried with a certain\nbitterness of amusement. But he added the next moment more seriously, as\nif his tone had been disrespectful: \"You probe me to the bottom, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"You needn't come either to Griffin or to Severals if you don't want\nto.\"\n\n\"Give them up yourself; stay here with me!\"\n\nShe coloured quickly as he said this, and broke out: \"Lord, how you hate\npolitical houses!\"\n\n\"How can you say that when from February to August I spend every blessed\nnight in one?\"\n\n\"Yes, and hate that worst of all.\"\n\n\"So do half the people who are in it. You, my dear, must have so many\nthings, so many people, so much _mise-en-sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_ and such a perpetual\nspectacle to live,\" Nick went on. \"Perpetual motion, perpetual visits,\nperpetual crowds! If you go into the country you'll see forty people\nevery day and be mixed up with them all day. The idea of a quiet\nfortnight in town, when by a happy if idiotic superstition everybody\ngoes out of it, disconcerts and frightens you. It's the very time, it's\nthe very place, to do a little work and possess one's soul.\"\n\nThis vehement allocution found her evidently somewhat unprepared; but\nshe was sagacious enough, instead of attempting for the moment a general\nrejoinder, to seize on a single phrase and say: \"Work? What work can you\ndo in London at such a moment as this?\"\n\nNick considered. \"I might tell you I want to get up a lot of subjects,\nto sit at home and read blue-books; but that wouldn't be quite what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you want to paint?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, since you gouge it out of me.\"\n\n\"Why do you make such a mystery about it? You're at perfect liberty,\"\nJulia said.\n\nShe put out her hand to rest it on the mantel-shelf, but her companion\ntook it on the way and held it in both his own. \"You're delightful,\nJulia, when you speak in that tone--then I know why it is I love you.\nBut I can't do anything if I go to Griffin, if I go to Severals.\"\n\n\"I see--I see,\" she answered thoughtfully and kindly.\n\n\"I've scarcely been inside of my studio for months, and I feel quite\nhomesick for it. The idea of putting in a few quiet days there has taken\nhold of me: I rather cling to it.\"\n\n\"It seems so odd your having a studio!\" Julia dropped, speaking so\nquickly that the words were almost incomprehensible.\n\n\"Doesn't it sound absurd, for all the good it does me, or I do _in_ it?\nOf course one can produce nothing but rubbish on such terms--without\ncontinuity or persistence, with just a few days here and there. I ought\nto be ashamed of myself, no doubt; but even my rubbish interests me.\n'_Guenille si l'on veut, ma guenille m'est ch\u00c3\u00a8re_.' But I'll go down to\nHarsh with you in a moment, Julia,\" Nick pursued: \"that would do as well\nif we could be quiet there, without people, without a creature; and I\nshould really be perfectly content. You'd beautifully sit for me; it\nwould be the occasion we've so often wanted and never found.\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly and with a smile that had a meaning for him.\n\"Thank you, my dear; nothing would induce me to go to Harsh with you.\"\n\nHe looked at her hard. \"What's the matter whenever it's a question of\nanything of that sort? Are you afraid of me?\" She pulled her hand from\nhim quickly, turning away; but he went on: \"Stay with me here then, when\neverything's so right for it. We shall do beautifully--have the whole\nplace, have the whole day, to ourselves. Hang your engagements!\nTelegraph you won't come. We'll live at the studio--you'll sit to me\nevery day. Now or never's our chance--when shall we have so good a one?\nThink how charming it will be! I'll make you wish awfully that I may do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I can't get out of Griffin--it's impossible,\" Julia said, moving\nfurther away and with her back presented to him.\n\n\"Then you _are_ afraid of me--simply!\"\n\nShe turned straight round, very pale. \"Of course I am. You're welcome to\nknow it.\"\n\nHe went toward her, and for a moment she seemed to make another slight\nmovement of retreat. This, however, was scarcely perceptible, and there\nwas nothing to alarm in the tone of reasonable entreaty in which he\nspoke as he stood there. \"Put an end, Julia, to our absurd situation--it\nreally can't go on. You've no right to expect a man to be happy or\ncomfortable in so false a position. We're spoken of odiously--of that we\nmay be sure; and yet what good have we of it?\"\n\n\"Spoken of? Do I care for that?\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're indifferent because there are no grounds? That's\njust why I hate it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\" she returned with sharp\ndisdain.\n\n\"Be my wife to-morrow--be my wife next week. Let us have done with this\nfantastic probation and be happy.\"\n\n\"Leave me now--come back to-morrow. I'll write to you.\" She had the air\nof pleading with him at present, pleading as he pleaded.\n\n\"You can't resign yourself to the idea of one's looking 'out of it'!\"\nNick laughed.\n\n\"Come to-morrow, before lunch,\" she went on.\n\n\"To be told I must wait six months more and then be sent about my\nbusiness? Ah, Julia, Julia!\" the young man groaned.\n\nSomething in this simple lament--it sounded natural and perfectly\nunstudied--seemed straightway to make a great impression on her. \"You\nshall wait no longer,\" she said after a short silence.\n\n\"What do you mean by no longer?\"\n\n\"Give me about five weeks--say till the Whitsuntide recess.\"\n\n\"Five weeks are a great deal,\" smiled Nick.\n\n\"There are things to be done--you ought to understand.\"\n\n\"I only understand how I love you.\"\n\nShe let herself go--\"Dearest Nick!\"--and he caught her and kept her in\nhis arms.\n\n\"I've your promise then for five weeks hence to a day?\" he demanded as\nshe at last released herself.\n\n\"We'll settle that--the exact day; there are things to consider and to\narrange. Come to luncheon to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I'll come early--I'll come at one,\" he said; and for a moment they\nstood all deeply and intimately taking each other in.\n\n\"Do you think I _want_ to wait, any more than you?\" she asked in\ncongruity with this.\n\n\"I don't feel so much out of it now!\" he declared by way of answer.\n\"You'll stay of course now--you'll give up your visits?\"\n\nShe had hold of the lappet of his coat; she had kept it in her hand even\nwhile she detached herself from his embrace. There was a white flower in\nhis buttonhole that she looked at and played with a moment before she\nsaid; \"I've a better idea--you needn't come to Griffin. Stay in your\nstudio--do as you like--paint dozens of pictures.\"\n\n\"Dozens? Barbarian!\" Nick wailed.\n\nThe epithet apparently had an endearing suggestion for her; it at any\nrate led her to let him possess himself of her head and, so holding it,\nkiss her--led her to say: \"What on earth do I want but that you should\ndo absolutely as you please and be as happy as you can?\"\n\nHe kissed her in another place at this; but he put it to her; \"What\ndreadful proposition is coming now?\"\n\n\"I'll go off and do up my visits and come back.\"\n\n\"And leave me alone?\"\n\n\"Don't be affected! You know you'll work much better without me. You'll\nlive in your studio--I shall be well out of the way.\"\n\n\"That's not what one wants of a sitter. How can I paint you?\"\n\n\"You can paint me all the rest of your life. I shall be a perpetual\nsitter.\"\n\n\"I believe I could paint you without looking at you\"--and his lighted\nface shone down on her. \"You do excuse me then from those dreary\nplaces?\"\n\n\"How can I insist after what you said about the pleasure of keeping\nthese days?\" she admirably--it was so all sincerely--asked.\n\n\"You're the best woman on earth--though it does seem odd you should rush\naway as soon as our little business is settled.\"\n\n\"We shall make it up. I know what I'm about. And now go!\" She ended by\nalmost pushing him out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nIt was certainly singular, in the light of other matters, that on\nsitting down in his studio after she had left town Nick should not, as\nregards the effort to project plastically some beautiful form, have felt\nmore chilled by the absence of a friend who was such an embodiment of\nbeauty. She was away and he missed her and longed for her, and yet\nwithout her the place was more filled with what he wanted to find in it.\nHe turned into it with confused feelings, the strongest of which was a\nsense of release and recreation. It looked blighted and lonely and\ndusty, and his old studies, as he rummaged them out, struck him even as\nless inspired than the last time he had ventured to face them. But amid\nthis neglected litter, in the colourless and obstructed light of a high\nnorth window which needed washing, he came nearer tasting the\npossibility of positive happiness: it appeared to him that, as he had\nsaid to Julia, he was more in possession of his soul. It was frivolity\nand folly, it was puerility, to spend valuable hours pottering over the\nvain implements of an art he had relinquished; and a certain shame that\nhe had felt in presenting his plea to Julia that Sunday night arose from\nthe sense not of what he clung to, but of what he had given up. He had\nturned his back on serious work, so that pottering was now all he could\naspire to. It couldn't be fruitful, it couldn't be anything but\nridiculous, almost ignoble; but it soothed his nerves, it was in the\nnature of a secret dissipation. He had never suspected he should some\nday have nerves on his own part to count with; but this possibility had\nbeen revealed to him on the day it became clear that he was letting\nsomething precious go. He was glad he had not to justify himself to the\ncritical, for this might have been a delicate business. The critical\nwere mostly absent; and besides, shut up all day in his studio, how\nshould he ever meet them? It was the place in the world where he felt\nfurthest away from his constituents. That was a part of the\npleasure--the consciousness that for the hour the coast was clear and\nhis mind independent. His mother and his sister had gone to Broadwood:\nLady Agnes--the phrase sounds brutal but represents his state of\nmind--was well out of the way. He had written to her as soon as Julia\nleft town--he had apprised her of the fact that his wedding-day was\nfixed: a relief for poor Lady Agnes to a period of intolerable\nmystification, of dark, dumb wondering and watching. She had said her\nsay the day of the poll at Harsh; she was too proud to ask and too\ndiscreet to \"nag\"; so she could only wait for something that didn't\ncome. The unconditioned loan of Broadwood had of course been something\nof a bribe to patience: she had at first felt that on the day she should\ntake possession of that capital house Julia would indeed seem to have\nentered the family. But the gift had confirmed expectations just enough\nto make disappointment more bitter; and the discomfort was greater in\nproportion as she failed to discover what was the matter. Her daughter\nGrace was much occupied with this question, and brought it up for\ndiscussion in a manner irritating to her ladyship, who had a high theory\nof being silent about it, but who, however, in the long run, was more\nunhappy when, in consequence of a reprimand, the girl suggested no\nreasons at all than when she suggested stupid ones. It eased Lady Agnes\na little to advert to the mystery when she could have the air of not\nhaving begun.\n\nThe letter Nick received from her the first day of Passion Week in reply\nto his important communication was the only one he read at that moment;\nnot counting of course the several notes Mrs. Dallow addressed to him\nfrom Griffin. There were letters piled up, as he knew, in Calcutta\nGardens, which his servant had strict orders not to bring to the studio.\nNick slept now in the bedroom attached to this retreat; got things, as\nhe wanted them, from Calcutta Gardens; and dined at his club, where a\nstray surviving friend or two, seeing him prowl about the library in the\nevening, was free to impute to such eccentricity some subtly political\nbasis. When he thought of his neglected letters he remembered Mr.\nCarteret's convictions on the subject of not \"getting behind\"; they made\nhim laugh, in the slightly sonorous painting-room, as he bent over one\nof the old canvases that he had ventured to turn to the light. He was\nfully determined, however, to master his correspondence before going\ndown, the last thing before Parliament should reassemble, to spend\nanother day at Beauclere. Mastering his correspondence meant, in Nick's\nmind, breaking open envelopes; writing answers was scarcely involved in\nthe idea. But Mr. Carteret would never guess that. Nick was not moved\neven to write to him that the affair with Julia was on the point of\ntaking the form he had been so good as to desire: he reserved the\npleasure of this announcement for a personal interview.\n\nThe day before Good Friday, in the morning, his stillness was broken by\na rat-tat-tat on the outer door of his studio, administered apparently\nby the knob of a walking-stick. His servant was out and he went to the\ndoor, wondering who his visitor could be at such a time, especially of\nthe rather presuming class. The class was indicated by the visitor's\nfailure to look for the bell--since there _was_ a bell, though it\nrequired a little research. In a moment the mystery was solved: the\ngentleman who stood smiling at him from the threshold could only be\nGabriel Nash. Nick had not seen this whimsical personage for several\nmonths, and had had no news of him beyond a general intimation that he\nwas following his fancy in foreign parts. His old friend had\nsufficiently prepared him, at the time of their reunion in Paris, for\nthe idea of the fitful in intercourse; and he had not been ignorant, on\nhis return from Paris, that he should have had an opportunity to miss\nhim if he had not been too busy to take advantage of it. In London,\nafter the episode at Harsh, Gabriel had not reappeared: he had redeemed\nnone of the pledges given the night they walked together to Notre Dame\nand conversed on important matters. He was to have interposed in Nick's\ndestiny, but he had not interposed; he was to have pulled him hard and\nin the opposite sense from Julia, but there had been no pulling; he was\nto have saved him, as he called it, and yet Nick was lost. This\ncircumstance indeed formed his excuse: the member for Harsh had rushed\nso wantonly to perdition. Nick had for the hour seriously wished to keep\nhold of him: he valued him as a salutary influence. Yet on coming to his\nsenses after his election our young man had recognised that Nash might\nvery well have reflected on the thanklessness of such a slippery\nsubject--might have held himself released from his vows. Of course it\nhad been particularly in the event of a Liberal triumph that he had\nthreatened to make himself felt; the effect of a brand plucked from the\nburning would be so much greater if the flames were already high. Yet\nNick had not kept him to the letter of this pledge, and had so fully\nadmitted the right of a thorough connoisseur, let alone a faithful\nfriend, to lose patience with him that he was now far from greeting his\nvisitor with a reproach. He felt much more thrown on his defence.\n\nGabriel, however, forbore at first to attack him. He brought in only\nblandness and benevolence and a great content at having obeyed the\nmystic voice--it was really a remarkable case of second sight--which had\nwhispered him that the recreant comrade of his prime was in town. He had\njust come back from Sicily after a southern winter, according to a\ncustom frequent with him, and had been moved by a miraculous prescience,\nunfavourable as the moment might seem, to go and ask for Nick in\nCalcutta Gardens, where he had extracted from his friend's servant an\naddress not known to all the world. He showed Nick what a mistake it had\nbeen to fear a dull arraignment, and how he habitually ignored all\nlapses and kept up the standard only by taking a hundred fine things for\ngranted. He also abounded more than ever in his own sense, reminding his\nrelieved listener how no recollection of him, no evocation of him in\nabsence, could ever do him justice. You couldn't recall him without\nseeming to exaggerate him, and then acknowledged, when you saw him, that\nyour exaggeration had fallen short. He emerged out of vagueness--his\nSicily might have been the Sicily of _A Winter's Tale_--and would\nevidently be reabsorbed in it; but his presence was positive and\npervasive enough. He was duly \"intense\" while he lasted. His connexions\nwere with beauty, urbanity and conversation, as usual, but they made up\na circle you couldn't find in the Court Guide. Nick had a sense that he\nknew \"a lot of esthetic people,\" but he dealt in ideas much more than\nin names and addresses. He was genial and jocose, sunburnt and\nromantically allusive. It was to be gathered that he had been living for\nmany days in a Saracenic tower where his principal occupation was to\nwatch for the flushing of the west. He had retained all the serenity of\nhis opinions and made light, with a candour of which the only defect was\napparently that it was not quite enough a conscious virtue, of many of\nthe objects of common esteem. When Nick asked him what he had been doing\nhe replied, \"Oh living, you know\"; and the tone of the words offered\nthem as the story of a great deed. He made a long visit, staying to\nluncheon and after luncheon, so that the little studio heard all at once\na greater quantity of brave talk than in the several previous years of\nits history. With much of our tale left to tell it is a pity that so\nlittle of this colloquy may be reported here; since, as affairs took\ntheir course, it marked really--if the question be of noting the exact\npoint--a turn of the tide in Nick Dormer's personal situation. He was\ndestined to remember the accent with which Nash exclaimed, on his\ndrawing forth sundry specimens of amateurish earnestness:\n\n\"I say--I say--I say!\"\n\nHe glanced round with a heightened colour. \"They're pretty bad, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh you're a deep one,\" Nash went on.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Do you call your conduct that of a man of honour?\"\n\n\"Scarcely perhaps. But when no one has seen them--!\"\n\n\"That's your villainy. _C'est de l'exquis, du pur exquis_. Come, my dear\nfellow, this is very serious--it's a bad business,\" said Gabriel Nash.\nThen he added almost with austerity: \"You'll be so good as to place\nbefore me every patch of paint, every sketch and scrap, that this room\ncontains.\"\n\nNick complied in great good humour. He turned out his boxes and drawers,\nshovelled forth the contents of bulging portfolios, mounted on chairs to\nunhook old canvases that had been severely \"skied.\" He was modest and\ndocile and patient and amused, above all he was quite thrilled--thrilled\nwith the idea of eliciting a note of appreciation so late in the day. It\nwas the oddest thing how he at present in fact found himself imputing\nvalue to his visitor--attributing to him, among attributions more\nconfused, the dignity of judgement, the authority of knowledge. Nash was\nan ambiguous character but an excellent touchstone. The two said very\nlittle for a while, and they had almost half an hour's silence, during\nwhich, after our young man had hastily improvised an exhibition, there\nwas only a puffing of cigarettes. Gabriel walked about, looking at this\nand that, taking up rough studies and laying them down, asking a\nquestion of fact, fishing with his umbrella, on the floor, amid a pile\nof unarranged sketches. Nick accepted jocosely the attitude of suspense,\nbut there was even more of it in his heart than in his face. So few\npeople had seen his young work--almost no one who really counted. He had\nbeen ashamed of it, never showing it to bring on a conclusion, since a\nconclusion was precisely what he feared. He whistled now while he let\nhis companion take time. He rubbed old panels with his sleeve and dabbed\nwet sponges on surfaces that had sunk. It was a long time since he had\nfelt so gay, strange as such an assertion sounds in regard to a young\nman whose bridal-day had at his urgent solicitation lately been fixed.\nHe had stayed in town to be alone with his imagination, and suddenly,\nparadoxically, the sense of that result had arrived with poor Nash.\n\n\"Nicholas Dormer,\" this personage remarked at last, \"for grossness of\nimmorality I think I've never seen your equal.\"\n\n\"That sounds so well,\" Nick returned, \"that I hesitate to risk spoiling\nit by wishing it explained.\"\n\n\"Don't you recognise in _any_ degree the grand idea of duty?\"\n\n\"If I don't grasp it with a certain firmness I'm a deadly failure, for I\nwas quite brought up on it,\" Nick said.\n\n\"Then you're indeed the wretchedest failure I know. Life is ugly, after\nall.\"\n\n\"Do I gather that you yourself recognise obligations of the order you\nallude to?\"\n\n\"Do you 'gather'?\" Nash stared. \"Why, aren't they the very flame of my\nfaith, the burden of my song?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, duty is doing, and I've inferred that you think rather\npoorly of doing--that it spoils one's style.\"\n\n\"Doing wrong, assuredly.\"\n\n\"But what do you call right? What's your canon of certainty there?\" Nick\nasked.\n\n\"The conscience that's in us--that charming, conversible, infinite\nthing, the intensest thing we know. But you must treat the oracle\ncivilly if you wish to make it speak. You mustn't stride into the temple\nin muddy jack-boots and with your hat on your head, as the Puritan\ntroopers tramped into the dear old abbeys. One must do one's best to\nfind out the right, and your criminality appears to be that you've not\ntaken the commonest trouble.\"\n\n\"I hadn't you to ask,\" smiled Nick. \"But duty strikes me as doing\nsomething in particular. If you're too afraid it may be the wrong thing\nyou may let everything go.\"\n\n\"Being is doing, and if doing is duty being is duty. Do you follow?\"\n\n\"At a very great distance.\"\n\n\"To be what one _may_ be, really and efficaciously,\" Nash went on, \"to\nfeel it and understand it, to accept it, adopt it, embrace it--that's\nconduct, that's life.\"\n\n\"And suppose one's a brute or an ass, where's the efficacy?\"\n\n\"In one's very want of intelligence. In such cases one's out of it--the\nquestion doesn't exist; one simply becomes a part of the duty of others.\nThe brute, the ass,\" Nick's visitor developed, \"neither feels nor\nunderstands, nor accepts nor adopts. Those fine processes in themselves\nclassify us. They educate, they exalt, they preserve; so that to profit\nby them we must be as perceptive as we can. We must recognise our\nparticular form, the instrument that each of us--each of us who carries\nanything--carries in his being. Mastering this instrument, learning to\nplay it in perfection--that's what I call duty, what I call conduct,\nwhat I call success.\"\n\nNick listened with friendly attention and the air of general assent was\nin his face as he said: \"Every one has it then, this individual pipe?\"\n\n\"'Every one,' my dear fellow, is too much to say, for the world's full\nof the crudest _remplissage_. The book of life's padded, ah but\npadded--a deplorable want of editing! I speak of every one who's any\none. Of course there are pipes and pipes--little quavering flutes for\nthe concerted movements and big _cornets-\u00c3\u00a0-piston_ for the great solos.\"\n\n\"I see, I see. And what might your instrument be?\"\n\nNash hesitated not a moment; his answer was radiantly there. \"To speak\nto people just as I'm speaking to you. To prevent for instance a great\nwrong being done.\"\n\n\"A great wrong--?\"\n\n\"Yes--to the human race. I talk--I talk; I say the things other people\ndon't, the things they can't the things they won't,\" Gabriel went on\nwith his inimitable candour.\n\n\"If it's a question of mastery and perfection you certainly have them,\"\nhis companion replied.\n\n\"And you haven't, alas; that's the pity of it, that's the scandal.\nThat's the wrong I want to set right before it becomes too public a\nshame. If I called you just now grossly immoral it's on account of the\nspectacle you present--a spectacle to be hidden from the eye of\ningenuous youth: that of a man neglecting his own fiddle to blunder away\non that of one of his fellows. We can't afford such mistakes, we can't\ntolerate such licence.\"\n\n\"You think then I _have_ a fiddle?\"--and our young man, in spite of\nhimself, attached to the question a quaver of suspense finer, doubtless,\nthan any that had ever passed his lips.\n\n\"A regular Stradivarius! All these things you've shown me are remarkably\ninteresting. You've a talent of a wonderfully pure strain.\"\n\n\"I say--I say--I say!\" Nick exclaimed, hovering there with his hands in\nhis pockets and a blush on his lighted face, while he repeated with a\nchange of accent Nash's exclamation of half an hour before.\n\n\"I like it, your talent; I measure it, I appreciate it, I insist upon\nit,\" that critic went on between the whiffs of his cigarette. \"I have to\nbe awfully wise and good to do so, but fortunately I am. In such a case\nthat's my duty. I shall make you my business for a while. Therefore,\" he\nadded piously; \"don't say I'm unconscious of the moral law.\"\n\n\"A Stradivarius?\" said Nick interrogatively and with his eyes wide open.\nThe thought in his mind was of how different this seemed from his having\ngone to Griffin.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nHis counsellor had plenty of further opportunity to develop this and\nother figurative remarks, for he not only spent several of the middle\nhours of the day at the studio, but came back in the evening--the pair\nhad dined together at a little foreign pothouse in Soho, revealed to\nNick on this occasion--and discussed the great question far into the\nnight. The great question was whether, on the showing of those examples\nof his ability with which the scene of their discourse was now densely\nbestrewn, Nick Dormer would be justified in \"really going in\" for the\npractice of pictorial art. This may strike many readers of his history\nas a limited and even trivial inquiry, with little of the heroic or the\nromantic in it; but it was none the less carried to the finest point by\nour impassioned young men. Nick suspected Nash of exaggerating his\nencouragement in order to play a malign trick on the political world at\nwhose expense it was his fond fancy to divert himself--without indeed\nmaking that organisation perceptibly totter--and reminded him that his\npresent accusation of immorality was strangely inconsistent with the\nwanton hope expressed by him in Paris, the hope that the Liberal\ncandidate at Harsh would be returned. Nash replied, first, \"Oh I hadn't\nbeen in this place then!\" but he defended himself later and more\neffectually by saying that it was not of Nick's having got elected he\ncomplained: it was of his visible hesitancy to throw up his seat. Nick\nbegged that he wouldn't mention this, and his gallantry failed to render\nhim incapable of saying: \"The fact is I haven't the nerve for it.\" They\ntalked then for a while of what he _could_ do, not of what he couldn't;\nof the mysteries and miracles of reproduction and representation; of the\nstrong, sane joys of the artistic life. Nick made afresh, with more\nfulness, his great confession, that his private ideal of happiness was\nthe life of a great painter of portraits. He uttered his thought on that\nhead so copiously and lucidly that Nash's own abundance was stilled and\nhe listened almost as if he had been listening to something\nnew--difficult as it was to conceive a point of view for such a matter\nwith which he was unacquainted.\n\n\"There it is,\" said Nick at last--\"there's the naked, preposterous\ntruth: that if I were to do exactly as I liked I should spend my years\nreproducing the more or less vacuous countenances of my fellow-mortals.\nI should find peace and pleasure and wisdom and worth, I should find\nfascination and a measure of success in it--out of the din and the dust\nand the scramble, the world of party labels, party cries, party bargains\nand party treacheries: of humbuggery, hypocrisy and cant. The cleanness\nand quietness of it, the independent effort to do something, to leave\nsomething which shall give joy to man long after the howling has died\naway to the last ghost of an echo--such a vision solicits me in the\nwatches of night with an almost irresistible force.\"\n\nAs he dropped these remarks he lolled on a big divan with one of his\nlong legs folded up, while his visitor stopped in front of him after\nmoving about the room vaguely and softly, almost on tiptoe, so as not to\ninterrupt him. \"You speak,\" Nash said, \"with the special and dreadful\neloquence that rises to a man's lips when he has practically, whatever\nhis theory may be, renounced the right and dropped hideously into the\nwrong. Then his regret for the right, a certain exquisite appreciation\nof it, puts on an accent I know well how to recognise.\"\n\nNick looked up at him a moment. \"You've hit it if you mean by that that\nI haven't resigned my seat and that I don't intend to.\"\n\n\"I thought you took it only to give it up. Don't you remember our talk\nin Paris?\"\n\n\"I like to be a part of the spectacle that amuses you,\" Nick returned,\n\"but I could scarcely have taken so much trouble as that for it.\"\n\n\"Isn't it then an absurd comedy, the life you lead?\"\n\n\"Comedy or tragedy--I don't know which; whatever it is I appear to be\ncapable of it to please two or three people.\"\n\n\"Then you _can_ take trouble?\" said Nash.\n\n\"Yes, for the woman I'm to marry.\"\n\n\"Oh you're to marry?\"\n\n\"That's what has come on since we met in Paris,\" Nick explained, \"and it\nmakes just the difference.\"\n\n\"Ah my poor friend,\" smiled Gabriel, much arrested, \"no wonder you've an\neloquence, an accent!\"\n\n\"It's a pity I have them in the wrong place. I'm expected to have them\nin the House of Commons.\"\n\n\"You will when you make your farewell speech there--to announce that you\nchuck it up. And may I venture to ask who's to be your wife?\" the\nvisitor pursued.\n\n\"Mrs. Dallow has kindly consented to accept that yoke. I think you saw\nher in Paris.\"\n\n\"Ah yes: you spoke of her to me, and I remember asking you even then if\nyou were in love with her.\"\n\n\"I wasn't then,\" said Nick.\n\nNash had a grave pause. \"And are you now?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes.\"\n\n\"That would be better--if it wasn't worse.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be better,\" Nick declared. \"It's the best thing that can\nhappen to me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" his friend continued, \"you must let me very respectfully\napproach this lady. You must let me bring her round.\"\n\n\"Bring her round to what?\"\n\n\"To everything. Talk her over.\"\n\n\"Talk her under!\" Nick laughed--but making his joke a little as to gain\ntime. He remembered the effect this adviser had produced on Julia--an\neffect that scantly ministered to the idea of another meeting. Julia had\nhad no occasion to allude again to Nick's imperturbable friend; he had\npassed out of her life at once and for ever; but there flickered up a\nquick memory of the contempt he had led her to express, together with a\nsense of how odd she would think it her intended should have thrown over\ntwo pleasant visits to cultivate such company.\n\n\"Over to a proper pride in what you may do,\" Nash returned--\"what you\nmay do above all if she'll help you.\"\n\n\"I scarcely see how she can help me,\" said Nick with an air of thinking.\n\n\"She's extremely handsome as I remember her. You could do great things\nwith _her_.\"\n\n\"Ah, there's the rub,\" Nick went on. \"I wanted her to sit for me this\nweek, but she wouldn't hear of it.\"\n\n\"_Elle a bien tort_. You should attack some fine strong type. Is Mrs.\nDallow in London?\" Nash inquired.\n\n\"For what do you take her? She's paying visits.\"\n\n\"Then I've a model for you.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ have--?\" Nick stared. \"What has that to do with Mrs.\nDallow's being away?\"\n\n\"Doesn't it give you more time?\"\n\n\"Oh the time flies!\" sighed Nick with a spontaneity that made his\ncompanion again laugh out--a demonstration in which for a moment he\nhimself rather ruefully joined.\n\n\"Does she like you to paint?\" that personage asked with one of his\ncandid intonations.\n\n\"So she says.\"\n\n\"Well, do something fine to show her.\"\n\n\"I'd rather show it to you,\" Nick confessed.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I see it from here--if you do your duty. Do you\nremember the Tragic Muse?\" Nash added for explanation.\n\n\"The Tragic Muse?\"\n\n\"That girl in Paris, whom we heard at the old actress's and afterwards\nmet at the charming entertainment given by your cousin--isn't he?--the\nsecretary of embassy.\"\n\n\"Oh Peter's girl! Of course I remember her.\"\n\n\"Don't call her Peter's; call her rather mine,\" Nash said with easy\nrectification. \"I invented her. I introduced her. I revealed her.\"\n\n\"I thought you on the contrary ridiculed and repudiated her.\"\n\n\"As a fine, handsome young woman surely not--I seem to myself to have\nbeen all the while rendering her services. I said I disliked tea-party\nranters, and so I do; but if my estimate of her powers was below the\nmark she has more than punished me.\"\n\n\"What has she done?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"She has become interesting, as I suppose you know.\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"Well, you must see her, you must paint her,\" Nash returned. \"She tells\nme something was said about it that day at Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's.\"\n\n\"Oh I remember--said by Peter.\"\n\n\"Then it will please Mr. Sherringham--you'll be glad to do that. I\nsuppose you know all he has done for Miriam?\" Gabriel pursued.\n\n\"Not a bit, I know nothing about Peter's affairs,\" Nick said, \"unless it\nbe in general that he goes in for mountebanks and mimes and that it\noccurs to me I've heard one of my sisters mention--the rumour had come\nto her--that he has been backing Miss Rooth.\"\n\n\"Miss Rooth delights to talk of his kindness; she's charming when she\nspeaks of it. It's to his good offices that she owes her appearance\nhere.\"\n\n\"Here?\" Nick's interest rose. \"Is she in London?\"\n\n\"_D'o\u00c3\u00b9 tombez-vous_? I thought you people read the papers.\"\n\n\"What should I read, when I sit--sometimes--through the stuff they put\ninto them?\"\n\n\"Of course I see that--that your engagement at your own variety-show,\nwith its interminable 'turns,' keeps you from going to the others. Learn\nthen,\" said Gabriel Nash, \"that you've a great competitor and that\nyou're distinctly not, much as you may suppose it, _the_ rising\ncomedian. The Tragic Muse is the great modern personage. Haven't you\nheard people speak of her, haven't you been taken to see her?\"\n\nNick bethought himself. \"I daresay I've heard of her, but with a good\nmany other things on my mind I had forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Certainly I can imagine what has been on your mind. She remembers you\nat any rate; she repays neglect with sympathy. She wants,\" said Nash,\n\"to come and see you.\"\n\n\"'See' me?\" It was all for Nick now a wonder.\n\n\"To be seen by you--it comes to the same thing. She's really worth\nseeing; you must let me bring her; you'll find her very suggestive. That\nidea that you should paint her--she appears to consider it a sort of\nbargain.\"\n\n\"A bargain?\" Our young man entered, as he believed, into the humour of\nthe thing. \"What will she give me?\"\n\n\"A splendid model. She _is_ splendid.\"\n\n\"Oh then bring her,\" said Nick.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nNash brought her, the great modern personage, as he had described her,\nthe very next day, and it took his friend no long time to test his\nassurance that Miriam Rooth was now splendid. She had made an impression\non him ten months before, but it had haunted him only a day, soon\noverlaid as it had been with other images. Yet after Nash had talked of\nher a while he recalled her better; some of her attitudes, some of her\nlooks and tones began to hover before him. He was charmed in advance\nwith the notion of painting her. When she stood there in fact, however,\nit seemed to him he had remembered her wrong; the brave, free, rather\ngrand creature who instantly filled his studio with such an unexampled\npresence had so shaken off her clumsiness, the rudeness and crudeness\nthat had made him pity her, a whole provincial and \"second-rate\" side.\nMiss Rooth was light and bright and direct to-day--direct without being\nstiff and bright without being garish. To Nick's perhaps inadequately\nsophisticated mind the model, the actress were figures of a vulgar\nsetting; but it would have been impossible to show that taint less than\nthis extremely natural yet extremely distinguished aspirant to\ndistinction. She was more natural even than Gabriel Nash--\"nature\" was\nstill Nick's formula for his amusing old friend--and beside her he\nappeared almost commonplace.\n\nNash recognised her superiority with a frankness honourable to both of\nthem--testifying in this manner to his sense that they were all three\nserious beings, worthy to deal with fine realities. She attracted crowds\nto her theatre, but to his appreciation of such a fact as that,\nimportant doubtless in its way, there were the limits he had already\nexpressed. What he now felt bound in all integrity to register was his\nperception that she had, in general and quite apart from the question of\nthe box-office, a remarkable, a very remarkable, artistic nature. He\nallowed that she had surprised him here; knowing of her in other days\nmainly that she was hungry to adopt an overrated profession he had not\nimputed to her the normal measure of intelligence. Now he saw--he had\nhad some talks with her--that she was capable almost of a violent play\nof mind; so much so that he was sorry for the embarrassment it would be\nto her. Nick could imagine the discomfort of having anything in the\nnature of a mind to arrange for in such conditions. \"She's a woman of\nthe best intentions, really of the best,\" Nash explained kindly and\nlucidly, almost paternally, \"and the quite rare head you can see for\nyourself.\"\n\nMiriam, smiling as she sat on an old Venetian chair, held aloft, with\nthe noblest effect, that quarter of her person to which this patronage\nwas extended, remarking to her host that, strange as it might appear,\nshe had got quite to like poor Mr. Nash: she could make him go about\nwith her--it was a relief to her mother.\n\n\"When I take him she has perfect peace,\" the girl said; \"then she can\nstay at home and see the interviewers. She delights in that and I hate\nit, so our friend here is a great comfort. Of course a _femme de\nth\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_ is supposed to be able to go out alone, but there's a kind of\n'smartness,' an added _chic_, in having some one. People think he's my\n'companion '; I'm sure they fancy I pay him. I'd pay him, if he'd take\nit--and perhaps he will yet!--rather than give him up, for it doesn't\nmatter that he's not a lady. He _is_ one in tact and sympathy, as you\nsee. And base as he thinks the sort of thing I do he can't keep away\nfrom the theatre. When you're celebrated people will look at you who\ncould never before find out for themselves why they should.\"\n\n\"When you're celebrated you grow handsomer; at least that's what has\nhappened to you, though you were pretty too of old,\" Gabriel placidly\nargued. \"I go to the theatre to look at your head; it gives me the\ngreatest pleasure. I take up anything of that sort as soon as I find it.\nOne never knows how long it may last.\"\n\n\"Are you attributing that uncertainty to my appearance?\" Miriam\nbeautifully asked.\n\n\"Dear no, to my own pleasure, the first precious bloom of it,\" Nash went\non. \"Dormer at least, let me tell you in justice to him, hasn't waited\ntill you were celebrated to want to see you again--he stands there\nopen-eyed--for the simple reason that he hadn't the least idea of your\nrenown. I had to announce it to him.\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen me act?\" Miriam put, without reproach, to her host.\n\n\"I'll go to-night,\" he handsomely declared.\n\n\"You have your terrible House, haven't you? What do they call it--the\ndemands of public life?\" Miriam continued: in answer to which Gabriel\nexplained that he had the demands of private life as well, inasmuch as\nhe was in love--he was on the point of being married. She listened to\nthis with participation; then she said: \"Ah then do bring your--what do\nthey call her in English? I'm always afraid of saying something\nimproper--your _future_. I'll send you a box, under the circumstances;\nyou'll like that better.\" She added that if he were to paint her he\nwould have to see her often on the stage, wouldn't he? to profit by the\n_optique de la sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_--what did they call _that_ in English?--studying\nher and fixing his impression. But before he had time to meet this\nproposition she asked him if it disgusted him to hear her speak like\nthat, as if she were always posing and thinking about herself, living\nonly to be looked at, thrusting forward her person. She already often\ngot sick of doing so, but _\u00c3\u00a0 la guerre comme \u00c3\u00a0 la guerre_.\n\n\"That's the fine artistic nature, you see--a sort of divine disgust\nbreaking out in her,\" Nash expounded.\n\n\"If you want to paint me 'at all at all' of course. I'm struck with the\nway I'm taking that for granted,\" the girl decently continued. \"When Mr.\nNash spoke of it to me I jumped at the idea. I remembered our meeting in\nParis and the kind things you said to me. But no doubt one oughtn't to\njump at ideas when they represent serious sacrifices on the part of\nothers.\"\n\n\"Doesn't she speak well?\" Nash demanded of Nick. \"Oh she'll go far!\"\n\n\"It's a great privilege to me to paint you: what title in the world have\nI to pretend to such a model?\" Nick replied to Miriam. \"The sacrifice is\nyours--a sacrifice of time and good nature and credulity. You come, in\nyour bright beauty and your genius, to this shabby place where I've\nnothing worth speaking of to show, not a guarantee to offer you; and I\nwonder what I've done to deserve such a gift of the gods.\"\n\n\"Doesn't _he_ speak well?\"--and Nash appealed with radiance to their\ncompanion.\n\nShe took no notice of him, only repeating to Nick that she hadn't\nforgotten his friendly attitude in Paris; and when he answered that he\nsurely had done very little she broke out, first resting her eyes on\nhim with a deep, reasonable smile and then springing up quickly; \"Ah\nwell, if I must justify myself I liked you!\"\n\n\"Fancy my appearing to challenge you!\" laughed Nick in deprecation. \"To\nsee you again is to want tremendously to try something. But you must\nhave an infinite patience, because I'm an awful duffer.\"\n\nShe looked round the walls. \"I see what you've done--_bien des choses_.\"\n\n\"She understands--she understands,\" Gabriel dropped. And he added to\ntheir visitor: \"Imagine, when he might do something, his choosing a life\nof shams! At bottom he's like you--a wonderful artistic nature.\"\n\n\"I'll have patience,\" said the girl, smiling at Nick.\n\n\"Then, my children, I leave you--the peace of the Lord be with you.\"\nWith which words Nash took his departure.\n\nThe others chose a position for the young woman's sitting after she had\nplaced herself in many different attitudes and different lights; but an\nhour had elapsed before Nick got to work--began, on a large canvas, to\n\"knock her in,\" as he called it. He was hindered even by the fine\nelement of agitation, the emotion of finding himself, out of a clear\nsky, confronted with such a subject and launched in such a task. What\ncould the situation be but incongruous just after he had formally\nrenounced all manner of \"art\"?--the renunciation taking effect not a bit\nthe less from the whim he had all consciously treated himself to _as_ a\nwhim (the last he should ever descend to!) the freak of a fortnight's\nrelapse into a fingering of old sketches for the purpose, as he might\nhave said, of burning them up, of clearing out his studio and\nterminating his lease. There were both embarrassment and inspiration in\nthe strange chance of snatching back for an hour a relinquished joy: the\njump with which he found he could still rise to such an occasion took\naway his breath a little, at the same time that the idea--the idea of\nwhat one might make of such material--touched him with an irresistible\nwand. On the spot, to his inner vision, Miriam became a rich result,\ndrawing a hundred formative forces out of their troubled sleep, defying\nhim where he privately felt strongest and imposing herself triumphantly\nin her own strength. He had the good fortune, without striking matches,\nto see her, as a subject, in a vivid light, and his quick attempt was as\nexciting as a sudden gallop--he might have been astride, in a boundless\nfield, of a runaway horse.\n\nShe was in her way so fine that he could only think how to \"do\" her:\nthat hard calculation soon flattened out the consciousness, lively in\nhim at first, that she was a beautiful woman who had sought him out of\nhis retirement. At the end of their first sitting her having done so\nappeared the most natural thing in the world: he had a perfect right to\nentertain her there--explanations and complications were engulfed in the\nproductive mood. The business of \"knocking her in\" held up a lamp to her\nbeauty, showed him how much there was of it and that she was infinitely\ninteresting. He didn't want to fall in love with her--that _would_ be a\nsell, he said to himself--and she promptly became much too interesting\nfor it. Nick might have reflected, for simplification's sake, as his\ncousin Peter had done, but with more validity, that he was engaged with\nMiss Rooth in an undertaking which didn't in the least refer to\nthemselves, that they were working together seriously and that decent\nwork quite gainsaid sensibility--the humbugging sorts alone had to help\nthemselves out with it. But after her first sitting--she came, poor\ngirl, but twice--the need of such exorcisms passed from his spirit: he\nhad so thoroughly, so practically taken her up. As to whether his\nvisitor had the same bright and still sense of co-operation to a\ndefinite end, the sense of the distinctively technical nature of the\nanswer to every question to which the occasion might give birth, that\nmystery would be lighted only were it open to us to regard this young\nlady through some other medium than the mind of her friends. We have\nchosen, as it happens, for some of the great advantages it carries with\nit, the indirect vision; and it fails as yet to tell us--what Nick of\ncourse wondered about before he ceased to care, as indeed he intimated\nto her--why a budding celebrity should have dreamed of there being\nsomething for her in so blighted a spot. She should have gone to one of\nthe regular people, the great people: they would have welcomed her with\nopen arms. When Nick asked her if some of the R.A.'s hadn't expressed a\nwish for a crack at her she replied: \"Oh dear no, only the tiresome\nphotographers; and fancy _them_ in the future. If mamma could only do\n_that_ for me!\" And she added with the charming fellowship for which she\nwas conspicuous at these hours: \"You know I don't think any one yet has\nbeen quite so much struck with me as you.\"\n\n\"Not even Peter Sherringham?\" her host jested while he stepped back to\njudge of the effect of a line.\n\n\"Oh Mr. Sherringham's different. You're an artist.\"\n\n\"For pity's sake don't say that!\" he cried. \"And as regards _your_ art I\nthought Peter knew more than any one.\"\n\n\"Ah you're severe,\" said Miriam.\n\n\"Severe--?\"\n\n\"Because that's what the poor dear thinks. But he does know a lot--he\nhas been a providence to me.\"\n\n\"Then why hasn't he come over to see you act?\"\n\nShe had a pause. \"How do you know he hasn't come?\"\n\n\"Because I take for granted he'd have called on me if he had.\"\n\n\"Does he like you very much?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"I don't know. I like _him_.\"\n\n\"He's a gentleman--_pour cela_,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh yes, for that!\" Nick went on absently, labouring hard.\n\n\"But he's afraid of me--afraid to see me.\"\n\n\"Doesn't he think you good enough?\"\n\n\"On the contrary--he believes I shall carry him away and he's in a\nterror of my doing it.\"\n\n\"He ought to like that,\" said Nick with conscious folly.\n\n\"That's what I mean when I say he's not an artist. However, he declares\nhe does like it, only it appears to be not the right thing for him. Oh\nthe right thing--he's ravenous for that. But it's not for me to blame\nhim, since I am too. He's coming some night, however. Then,\" she added\nalmost grimly, \"he shall have a dose.\"\n\n\"Poor Peter!\" Nick returned with a compassion none the less real because\nit was mirthful: the girl's tone was so expressive of easy unscrupulous\npower.\n\n\"He's such a curious mixture,\" she luxuriously went on; \"sometimes I\nquite lose patience with him. It isn't exactly trying to serve both God\nand Mammon, but it's muddling up the stage and the world. The world be\nhanged! The stage, or anything of that sort--I mean one's artistic\nconscience, one's true faith--comes first.\"\n\n\"Brava, brava! you do me good,\" Nick murmured, still amused, beguiled,\nand at work. \"But it's very kind of you, when I was in this absurd state\nof ignorance, to impute to me the honour of having been more struck with\nyou than any one else,\" he continued after a moment.\n\n\"Yes, I confess I don't quite see--when the shops were full of my\nphotographs.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm so poor--I don't go into shops,\" he explained.\n\n\"Are you very poor?\"\n\n\"I live on alms.\"\n\n\"And don't they pay you--the government, the ministry?\"\n\n\"Dear young lady, for what?--for shutting myself up with beautiful\nwomen?\"\n\n\"Ah you've others then?\" she extravagantly groaned.\n\n\"They're not so kind as you, I confess.\"\n\n\"I'll buy it from you--what you're doing: I'll pay you well when it's\ndone,\" said the girl. \"I've got money now. I make it, you know--a good\nlot of it. It's too delightful after scraping and starving. Try it and\nyou'll see. Give up the base, bad world.\"\n\n\"But isn't it supposed to be the base, bad world that pays?\"\n\n\"Precisely; make it pay without mercy--knock it silly, squeeze it dry.\nThat's what it's meant for--to pay for art. Ah if it wasn't for that!\nI'll bring you a quantity of photographs to-morrow--you must let me come\nback to-morrow: it's so amusing to have them, by the hundred, all for\nnothing, to give away. That's what takes mamma most: she can't get over\nit. That's luxury and glory; even at Castle Nugent they didn't do that.\nPeople used to sketch me, but not so much as mamma _veut bien le dire_;\nand in all my life I never had but one poor little carte-de-visite, when\nI was sixteen, in a plaid frock, with the banks of a river, at three\nfrancs the dozen.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nIt was success, the member for Harsh felt, that had made her finer--the\nfull possession of her talent and the sense of the recognition of it.\nThere was an intimation in her presence (if he had given his mind to it)\nthat for him too the same cause would produce the same effect--that is\nwould show him how being launched in the practice of an art makes\nstrange and prompt revelations. Nick felt clumsy beside a person who\nmanifestly, now, had such an extraordinary familiarity with the esthetic\npoint of view. He remembered too the clumsiness that had been in his\nvisitor--something silly and shabby, pert rather than proper, and of\nquite another value than her actual smartness, as London people would\ncall it, her well-appointedness and her evident command of more than one\nmanner. Handsome as she had been the year before, she had suggested\nsordid lodgings, bread and butter, heavy tragedy and tears; and if then\nshe was an ill-dressed girl with thick hair who wanted to be an actress,\nshe was already in these few weeks a performer who could even produce an\nimpression of not performing. She showed what a light hand she could\nhave, forbore to startle and looked as well, for unprofessional life, as\nJulia: which was only the perfection of her professional character.\n\nThis function came out much in her talk, for there were many little\nbursts of confidence as well as many familiar pauses as she sat there;\nand she was ready to tell Nick the whole history of her _d\u00c3\u00a9but_--the\nchance that had suddenly turned up and that she had caught, with a\nfierce leap, as it passed. He missed some of the details in his\nattention to his own task, and some of them he failed to understand,\nattached as they were to the name of Mr. Basil Dashwood, which he heard\nfor the first time. It was through Mr. Dashwood's extraordinary\nexertions that a hearing--a morning performance at a London theatre--had\nbeen obtained for her. That had been the great step, for it had led to\nthe putting on at night of the play, at the same theatre, in place of a\nwretched thing they were trying (it was no use) to keep on its feet, and\nto her engagement for the principal part. She had made a hit in it--she\ncouldn't pretend not to know that; but she was already tired of it,\nthere were so many other things she wanted to do; and when she thought\nit would probably run a month or two more she fell to cursing the odious\nconditions of artistic production in such an age. The play was a more or\nless idiotised version of a new French piece, a thing that had taken in\nParis at a third-rate theatre and was now proving itself in London good\nenough for houses mainly made up of ten-shilling stalls. It was Dashwood\nwho had said it would go if they could get the rights and a fellow to\nmake some changes: he had discovered it at a nasty little place she had\nnever been to, over the Seine. They had got the rights, and the fellow\nwho had made the changes was practically Dashwood himself; there was\nanother man in London, Mr. Gushmore--Miriam didn't know if Nick had\nheard of him (Nick hadn't) who had done some of it. It had been awfully\nchopped down, to a mere bone, with the meat all gone; but that was what\npeople in London seemed to like. They were very innocent--thousands of\nlittle dogs amusing themselves with a bone. At any rate she had made\nsomething, she had made a figure, of the woman--a dreadful stick, with\nwhat Dashwood had muddled her into; and Miriam added in the complacency\nof her young expansion: \"Oh give me fifty words any time and the ghost\nof a situation, and I'll set you up somebody. Besides, I mustn't abuse\npoor Yolande--she has saved us,\" she said.\n\n\"'Yolande'--?\"\n\n\"Our ridiculous play. That's the name of the impossible woman. She has\nput bread into our mouths and she's a loaf on the shelf for the future.\nThe rights are mine.\"\n\n\"You're lucky to have them,\" said Nick a little vaguely, troubled about\nhis sitter's nose, which was somehow Jewish without the convex arch.\n\n\"Indeed I am. He gave them to me. Wasn't it charming?\"\n\n\"'He' gave them--Mr. Dashwood?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no--where should poor Dashwood have got them? He hasn't a\npenny in the world. Besides, if he had got them he'd have kept them. I\nmean your blessed cousin.\"\n\n\"I see--they're a present from Peter.\"\n\n\"Like many other things. Isn't he a dear? If it hadn't been for him the\nshelf would have remained bare. He bought the play for this country and\nAmerica for four hundred pounds, and on the chance: fancy! There was no\nrush for it, and how could he tell? And then he gracefully pressed it on\nme. So I've my little capital. Isn't he a duck? You've nice cousins.\"\n\nNick assented to the proposition, only inserting an amendment to the\neffect that surely Peter had nice cousins too, and making, as he went on\nwith his work, a tacit, preoccupied reflexion or two; such as that it\nmust be pleasant to render little services like that to youth, beauty\nand genius--he rather wondered how Peter could afford them--and that,\n\"duck\" as he was, Miss Rooth's benefactor was rather taken for granted.\n_Sic vos non vobis_ softly sounded in his brain. This community of\ninterests, or at least of relations, quickened the flight of time, so\nthat he was still fresh when the sitting came to an end. It was settled\nMiriam should come back on the morrow, to enable her artist to make the\nmost of the few days of the parliamentary recess; and just before she\nleft him she asked:\n\n\"Then you _will_ come to-night?\"\n\n\"Without fail. I hate to lose an hour of you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll place you. It will be my affair.\"\n\n\"You're very kind\"--he quite rose to it. \"Isn't it a simple matter for\nme to take a stall? This week I suppose they're to be had.\"\n\n\"I'll send you a box,\" said Miriam. \"You shall do it well. There are\nplenty now.\"\n\n\"Why should I be lost, all alone, in the grandeur of a box?\"\n\n\"Can't you bring your friend?\"\n\n\"My friend?\"\n\n\"The lady you're engaged to.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately she's out of town.\"\n\nMiriam looked at him in the grand manner. \"Does she leave you alone like\nthat?\"\n\n\"She thought I should like it--I should be more free to paint. You see I\nam.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps it's good for _me_. Have you got her portrait?\" Miriam\nasked.\n\n\"She doesn't like me to paint her.\"\n\n\"Really? Perhaps then she won't like you to paint me.\"\n\n\"That's why I want to be quick!\" laughed Nick.\n\n\"Before she knows it?\"\n\n\"Shell know it to-morrow. I shall write to her.\"\n\nThe girl faced him again portentously. \"I see you're afraid of her.\" But\nshe added: \"Mention my name; they'll give you the box at the office.\"\n\nWhether or no Nick were afraid of Mrs. Dallow he still waved away this\nbounty, protesting that he would rather take a stall according to his\nwont and pay for it. Which led his guest to declare with a sudden\nflicker of passion that if he didn't do as she wished she would never\nsit to him again.\n\n\"Ah then you have me,\" he had to reply. \"Only I _don't_ see why you\nshould give me so many things.\"\n\n\"What in the world have I given you?\"\n\n\"Why an idea.\" And Nick looked at his picture rather ruefully. \"I don't\nmean to say though that I haven't let it fall and smashed it.\"\n\n\"Ah an idea--that _is_ a great thing for people in our line. But you'll\nsee me much better from the box and I'll send you Gabriel Nash.\" She got\ninto the hansom her host's servant had fetched for her, and as Nick\nturned back into his studio after watching her drive away he laughed at\nthe conception that they were in the same \"line.\"\n\nHe did share, in the event, his box at the theatre with Nash, who talked\nduring the _entr'actes_ not in the least about the performance or the\nperformer, but about the possible greatness of the art of the\nportraitist--its reach, its range, its fascination, the magnificent\nexamples it had left us in the past: windows open into history, into\npsychology, things that were among the most precious possessions of the\nhuman race. He insisted above all on the interest, the importance of\nthis great peculiarity of it, that unlike most other forms it was a\nrevelation of two realities, the man whom it was the artist's conscious\neffort to reveal and the man--the interpreter--expressed in the very\nquality and temper of that effort. It offered a double vision, the\nstrongest dose of life that art could give, the strongest dose of art\nthat life could give. Nick Dormer had already become aware of having two\nstates of mind when listening to this philosopher; one in which he\nlaughed, doubted, sometimes even reprobated, failed to follow or accept,\nand another in which his old friend seemed to take the words out of his\nmouth, to utter for him, better and more completely, the very things he\nwas on the point of saying. Gabriel's saying them at such moments\nappeared to make them true, to set them up in the world, and to-night he\nsaid a good many, especially as to the happiness of cultivating one's\nown garden, growing there, in stillness and freedom, certain strong,\npure flowers that would bloom for ever, bloom long after the rank weeds\nof the hour were withered and blown away.\n\nIt was to keep Miriam Rooth in his eye for his current work that Nick\nhad come to the play; and she dwelt there all the evening, being\nconstantly on the stage. He was so occupied in watching her face--for he\nnow saw pretty clearly what he should attempt to make of it--that he was\nconscious only in a secondary degree of the story she illustrated, and\nhad in regard to her acting a surprised sense that she was\nextraordinarily quiet. He remembered her loudness, her violence in\nParis, at Peter Sherringham's, her wild wails, the first time, at Madame\nCarr\u00c3\u00a9's; compared with which her present manner was eminently temperate\nand modern. Nick Dormer was not critical at the theatre; he believed\nwhat he saw and had a pleasant sense of the inevitable; therefore he\nwouldn't have guessed what Gabriel Nash had to tell him--that for this\nyoung woman, with her tragic cast and her peculiar attributes, her\npresent performance, full of actuality, of light fine indications and at\nmoments of pointed touches of comedy, was a rare _tour de force_. It\nwent on altogether in a register he hadn't supposed her to possess and\nin which, as he said, she didn't touch her capital, doing it all with\nher wonderful little savings. It conveyed to him that she was capable of\nalmost anything.\n\nIn one of the intervals they went round to see her; but for Nick this\npurpose was partly defeated by the extravagant transports, as they\nstruck him, of Mrs. Rooth, whom they found sitting with her daughter and\nwho attacked him with a hundred questions about his dear mother and his\ncharming sisters. She had volumes to say about the day in Paris when\nthey had shown her the kindness she should never forget. She abounded\nalso in admiration of the portrait he had so cleverly begun, declaring\nshe was so eager to see it, however little he might as yet have\naccomplished, that she should do herself the honour to wait upon him in\nthe morning when Miriam came to sit.\n\n\"I'm acting for you to-night,\" the girl more effectively said before he\nreturned to his place.\n\n\"No, that's exactly what you're not doing,\" Nash interposed with one of\nhis happy sagacities. \"You've stopped acting, you've reduced it to the\nleast that will do, you simply are--you're just the visible image, the\npicture on the wall. It keeps you wonderfully in focus. I've never seen\nyou so beautiful.\"\n\nMiriam stared at this; then it could be seen that she coloured. \"What a\nluxury in life to have everything explained! He's the great explainer,\"\nshe herself explained to Nick.\n\nHe shook hands with her for good-night. \"Well then, we must give him\nlots to do.\"\n\nShe came to his studio in the morning, but unaccompanied by her mother,\nin allusion to whom she simply said, \"Mamma wished to come but I\nwouldn't let her.\" They proceeded promptly to business. The girl\ndivested herself of her hat and coat, taking the position already\ndetermined. After they had worked more than an hour with much less talk\nthan the day before, Nick being extremely absorbed and Miriam wearing in\nsilence an air of noble compunction for the burden imposed on him, at\nthe end of this period of patience, pervaded by a holy calm, our young\nlady suddenly got up and exclaimed, \"I say, I must see it!\"--with which,\nquickly, she stepped down from her place and came round to the canvas.\nShe had at Nick's request not looked at his work the day before. He fell\nback, glad to rest, and put down his palette and brushes.\n\n\"_Ah bien, c'est tap\u00c3\u00a9_!\" she cried as she stood before the easel. Nick\nwas pleased with her ejaculation, he was even pleased with what he had\ndone; he had had a long, happy spurt and felt excited and sanctioned.\nMiriam, retreating also a little, sank into a high-backed, old-fashioned\nchair that stood two or three yards from the picture and reclined in it,\nher head on one side, looking at the rough resemblance. She made a\nremark or two about it, to which Nick replied, standing behind her and\nafter a moment leaning on the top of the chair. He was away from his\nwork and his eyes searched it with a shy fondness of hope. They rose,\nhowever, as he presently became conscious that the door of the large\nroom opposite him had opened without making a sound and that some one\nstood upon the threshold. The person on the threshold was Julia Dallow.\n\nAs soon as he was aware Nick wished he had posted a letter to her the\nnight before. He had written only that morning. There was nevertheless\ngenuine joy in the words with which he bounded toward her--\"Ah my dear\nJulia, what a jolly surprise!\"--for her unannounced descent spoke to\nhim above all of an irresistible desire to see him again sooner than\nthey had arranged. She had taken a step forward, but she had done no\nmore, stopping short at the sight of the strange woman, so divested of\nvisiting-gear that she looked half-undressed, who lounged familiarly in\nthe middle of the room and over whom Nick had been still more familiarly\nhanging. Julia's eyes rested on this embodied unexpectedness, and as\nthey did so she grew pale--so pale that Nick, observing it,\ninstinctively looked back to see what Miriam had done to produce such an\neffect. She had done nothing at all, which was precisely what was\nembarrassing; she only stared at the intruder, motionless and superb.\nShe seemed somehow in easy possession of the place, and even at that\ninstant Nick noted how handsome she looked; so that he said to himself\ninaudibly, in some deeper depth of consciousness, \"How I should like to\npaint her that way!\" Mrs. Dallow's eyes moved for a single moment to her\nfriend's; then they turned away--away from Miriam, ranging over the\nroom.\n\n\"I've got a sitter, but you mustn't mind that; we're taking a rest. I'm\ndelighted to see you\"--he was all cordiality. He closed the door of the\nstudio behind her; his servant was still at the outer door, which was\nopen and through which he saw Julia's carriage drawn up. This made her\nadvance a little further, but still she said nothing; she dropped no\nanswer even when Nick went on with a sense of awkwardness: \"When did you\ncome back? I hope nothing has gone wrong. You come at a very interesting\nmoment,\" he continued, aware as soon as he had spoken of something in\nhis words that might have made her laugh. She was far from laughing,\nhowever; she only managed to look neither at him nor at Miriam and to\nsay, after a little, when he had repeated his question about her\nreturn:\n\n\"I came back this morning--I came straight here.\"\n\n\"And nothing's wrong, I hope?\"\n\n\"Oh no--everything's all right,\" she returned very quickly and without\nexpression. She vouchsafed no explanation of her premature descent and\ntook no notice of the seat Nick offered her; neither did she appear to\nhear him when he begged her not to look yet at the work on the easel--it\nwas in such a dreadful state. He was conscious, as he phrased it, that\nthis request gave to Miriam's position, directly in front of his canvas,\nan air of privilege which her neglect to recognise in any way Mrs.\nDallow's entrance or her importance did nothing to correct. But that\nmattered less if the appeal failed to reach Julia's intelligence, as he\njudged, seeing presently how deeply she was agitated. Nothing mattered\nin face of the sense of danger taking possession of him after she had\nbeen in the room a few moments. He wanted to say, \"What's the\ndifficulty? Has anything happened?\" but he felt how little she would\nlike him to utter words so intimate in presence of the person she had\nbeen rudely startled to find between them. He pronounced Miriam's name\nto her and her own to Miriam, but Julia's recognition of the ceremony\nwas so slight as to be scarcely perceptible. Miriam had the air of\nwaiting for something more before she herself made a sign; and as\nnothing more came she continued to say nothing and not to budge. Nick\nadded a remark to the effect that Julia would remember to have had the\npleasure of meeting her the year before--in Paris, that day at old\nPeter's; to which Mrs. Dallow made answer, \"Ah yes,\" without any\nqualification, while she looked down at some rather rusty studies on\npanels ranged along the floor and resting against the base of the wall.\nHer discomposure was a clear pain to herself; she had had a shock of\nextreme violence, and Nick saw that as Miriam showed no symptom of\noffering to give up her sitting her stay would be of the briefest. He\nwished that young woman would do something--say she would go, get up,\nmove about; as it was she had the appearance of watching from her point\nof vantage the other's upset. He made a series of inquiries about\nJulia's doings in the country, to two or three of which she gave answers\nmonosyllabic and scarcely comprehensible, only turning her eyes round\nand round the room as in search of something she couldn't find--of an\nescape, of something that was not Miriam. At last she said--it was at\nthe end of a very few minutes:\n\n\"I didn't come to stay--when you're so busy. I only looked in to see if\nyou were here. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"It's charming of you to have come. I'm so glad you've seen for yourself\nhow well I'm occupied,\" Nick replied, not unconscious of how red he was.\nThis made Mrs. Dallow look at him while Miriam considered them both.\nJulia's eyes had a strange light he had never seen before--a flash of\nfear by which he was himself frightened. \"Of course I'll see you later,\"\nhe added in awkward, in really misplaced gaiety while she reached the\ndoor, which she opened herself, getting out with no further attention to\nMiriam. \"I wrote to you this morning--you've missed my letter,\" he\nrepeated behind her, having already given her this information. The door\nof the studio was very near that of the house, but before she had\nreached the street the visitors' bell was set ringing. The passage was\nnarrow and she kept in advance of Nick, anticipating his motion to open\nthe street-door. The bell was tinkling still when, by the action of her\nown hand, a gentleman on the step stood revealed.\n\n\"Ah my dear, don't go!\" Nick heard pronounced in quick, soft dissuasion\nand in the now familiar accents of Gabriel Nash. The rectification\nfollowed more quickly still, if that were a rectification which so\nlittle improved the matter: \"I beg a thousand pardons--I thought you\nwere Miriam.\"\n\nGabriel gave way and Julia the more sharply pursued her retreat. Her\ncarriage, a victoria with a pair of precious heated horses, had taken a\nturn up the street, but the coachman had already seen his mistress and\nwas rapidly coming back. He drew near; not so fast, however, but that\nGabriel Nash had time to accompany Mrs. Dallow to the edge of the\npavement with an apology for the freedom into which he had blundered.\nNick was at her other hand, waiting to put her into the carriage and\nfreshly disconcerted by the encounter with Nash, who somehow, as he\nstood making Julia an explanation that she didn't listen to, looked less\neminent than usual, though not more conscious of difficulties. Our young\nman coloured deeper and watched the footman spring down as the victoria\ndrove up; he heard Nash say something about the honour of having met\nMrs. Dallow in Paris. Nick wanted him to go into the house; he damned\ninwardly his lack of delicacy. He desired a word with Julia alone--as\nmuch alone as the two annoying servants would allow. But Nash was not\ntoo much discouraged to say: \"You came for a glimpse of the great model?\nDoesn't she sit? That's what I wanted too, this morning--just a look,\nfor a blessing on the day. Ah but you, madam--\"\n\nJulia had sprung into her corner while he was still speaking and had\nflashed out to the coachman a \"Home!\" which of itself set the horses in\nmotion. The carriage went a few yards, but while Gabriel, with an\nundiscouraged bow, turned away, Nick Dormer, his hand on the edge of\nthe hood, moved with it.\n\n\"You don't like it, but I'll explain,\" he tried to say for its occupant\nalone.\n\n\"Explain what?\" she asked, still very pale and grave, but in a voice\nthat showed nothing. She was thinking of the servants--she could think\nof them even then.\n\n\"Oh it's all right. I'll come in at five,\" Nick returned, gallantly\njocular, while she was whirled away.\n\nGabriel had gone into the studio and Nick found him standing in\nadmiration before Miriam, who had resumed the position in which she was\nsitting. \"Lord, she's good to-day! Isn't she good to-day?\" he broke out,\nseizing their host by the arm to give him a particular view. Miriam\nlooked indeed still handsomer than before, and she had taken up her\nattitude again with a splendid, sphinx-like air of being capable of\nkeeping it for ever. Nick said nothing, but went back to work with a\ntingle of confusion, which began to act after he had resumed his palette\nas a sharp, a delightful stimulus. Miriam spoke never a word, but she\nwas doubly grand, and for more than an hour, till Nick, exhausted,\ndeclared he must stop, the industrious silence was broken only by the\ndesultory discourse of their friend.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nNick went to Great Stanhope Street at five o'clock and learned, rather\nto his surprise, that Julia was not at home--to his surprise because he\nhad told her he would come at that hour, and he attributed to her, with\na certain simplicity, an eager state of mind in regard to his\nexplanation. Apparently she was not eager; the eagerness was his own--he\nwas eager to explain. He recognised, not without a certain consciousness\nof magnanimity in doing so, that there had been some reason for her\nquick withdrawal from his studio or at any rate for her extreme\ndiscomposure there. He had a few days before put in a plea for a snatch\nof worship in that sanctuary and she had accepted and approved it; but\nthe worship, when the curtain happened to blow back, showed for that of\na magnificent young woman, an actress with disordered hair, who wore in\na singular degree the appearance of a person settled for many hours. The\nexplanation was easy: it dwelt in the simple truth that when one was\npainting, even very badly and only for a moment, one had to have models.\nNick was impatient to give it with frank, affectionate lips and a full,\npleasant admission that it was natural Julia should have been startled;\nand he was the more impatient that, though he would not in the least\nhave expected her to like finding a strange woman intimately installed\nwith him, she had disliked it even more than would have seemed probable\nor natural. That was because, not having heard from him about the\nmatter, the impression was for the moment irresistible with her that a\ntrick had been played her. But three minutes with him alone would make\nthe difference.\n\nThey would indeed have a considerable difference to make, Nick\nreflected, as minutes much more numerous elapsed without bringing Mrs.\nDallow home. For he had said to the butler that he would come in and\nwait--though it was odd she should not have left a message for him: she\nwould doubtless return from one moment to the other. He had of course\nfull licence to wait anywhere he preferred; and he was ushered into\nJulia's particular sitting-room and supplied with tea and the evening\npapers. After a quarter of an hour, however, he gave little attention to\nthese beguilements, thanks to his feeling still more acutely that since\nshe definitely knew he was coming she might have taken the trouble to be\nat home. He walked up and down and looked out of the window, took up her\nbooks and dropped them again, and then, as half an hour had elapsed,\nbecame aware he was really sore. What could she be about when, with\nLondon a thankless void, she was of course not paying visits? A footman\ncame in to attend to the fire, whereupon Nick questioned him as to the\nmanner in which she was possibly engaged. The man disclosed the fact\nthat his mistress had gone out but a quarter of an hour before Nick's\narrival, and, as if appreciating the opportunity for a little decorous\nconversation, gave him still more information than he invited. From this\nit appeared that, as Nick knew, or could surmise, she had the evening\nbefore, from the country, wired for the victoria to meet her in the\nmorning at Paddington and then gone straight from the station to the\nstudio, while her maid, with her luggage, proceeded in a cab to Great\nStanhope Street. On leaving the studio, however, she had not come\ndirectly home; she had chosen this unusual season for an hour's drive in\nthe Park. She had finally re-entered her house, but had remained\nupstairs all day, seeing no one and not coming down to luncheon. At four\no'clock she had ordered the brougham for four forty-five, and had got\ninto it punctually, saying, \"To the Park!\" as she did so.\n\nNick, after the footman had left him, made what he could of Julia's\nsudden passion for the banks of the Serpentine, forsaken and foggy now,\ninasmuch as the afternoon had come on grey and the light was waning. She\nusually hated the Park and hated a closed carriage. He had a gruesome\nvision of her, shrunken into a corner of her brougham and veiled as if\nin consequence of tears, revolving round the solitude of the Drive. She\nhad of course been deeply displeased and was not herself; the motion of\nthe carriage soothed her, had an effect on her nerves. Nick remembered\nthat in the morning, at his door, she had appeared to be going home; so\nshe had plunged into the drearier resort on second thoughts and as she\nnoted herself near it. He lingered another half-hour, walked up and down\nthe room many times and thought of many things. Had she misunderstood\nhim when he said he would come at five? Couldn't she be sure, even if\nshe had, that he would come early rather than late, and mightn't she\nhave left a message for him on the chance? Going out that way a few\nminutes before he was to come had even a little the air of a thing done\non purpose to offend him; as if she had been so displeased that she had\ntaken the nearest occasion of giving him a sign she meant to break with\nhim. But were these the things Julia did and was that the way she did\nthem--his fine, proud, delicate, generous Julia?\n\nWhen six o'clock came poor Nick felt distinctly resentful; but he stayed\nten minutes longer on the possibility that she would in the morning have\nunderstood him to mention that hour. The April dusk began to gather and\nthe unsociability of her behaviour, especially if she were still\nrumbling round the Park, became absurd. Anecdotes came back to him,\nvaguely remembered, heard he couldn't have said when or where, of poor\nartists for whom life had been rendered difficult by wives who wouldn't\nallow them the use of the living female model and who made scenes if\nthey encountered on the staircase such sources of inspiration. These\nladies struck him as vulgar and odious persons, with whom it seemed\ngrotesque that Julia should have anything in common. Of course she was\nnot his wife yet, and of course if she were he should have washed his\nhands of every form of activity requiring the services of the sitter;\nbut even these qualifications left him with a power to wince at the way\nin which the woman he was so sure he loved just escaped ranking herself\nwith the Philistines.\n\nAt a quarter past six he rang a bell and told the servant who answered\nit that he was going and that Mrs. Dallow was to be informed as soon as\nshe came in that he had expected to find her and had waited an hour and\na quarter. But he had just reached the doorstep of departure when her\nbrougham, emerging from the evening mist, stopped in front of the house.\nNick stood there hanging back till she got out, allowing the servants\nonly to help her. She saw him--she was less veiled than his mental\nvision of her; but this didn't prevent her pausing to give an order to\nthe coachman, a matter apparently requiring some discussion. When she\ncame to the door her visitor remarked that he had been waiting an\neternity; to which she replied that he must make no grievance of\nthat--she was too unwell to do him justice. He immediately professed\nregret and sympathy, adding, however, that in that case she had much\nbetter not have gone out. She made no answer to this--there were three\nservants in the hall who looked as if they might understand at least\nwhat was not said to them; only when he followed her in she asked if his\nidea had been to stay longer.\n\n\"Certainly, if you're not too ill to see me.\"\n\n\"Come in then,\" Julia said, turning back after having gone to the foot\nof the stairs.\n\nThis struck him immediately as a further restriction of his visit: she\nwouldn't readmit him to the drawing-room or to her boudoir; she would\nreceive him in the impersonal apartment downstairs where she saw people\non business. What did she want to do to him? He was prepared by this\ntime for a scene of jealousy, since he was sure he had learned to read\nher character justly in feeling that if she had the appearance of a cold\nwoman a forked flame in her was liable on occasion to break out. She was\nvery still, but from time to time she would fire off a pistol. As soon\nas he had closed the door she said without sitting down:\n\n\"I daresay you saw I didn't like that at all.\"\n\n\"My having a sitter in that professional way? I was very much annoyed at\nit myself,\" Nick answered.\n\n\"Why were _you_ annoyed? She's very handsome,\" Mrs. Dallow perversely\nsaid.\n\n\"I didn't know you had looked at her!\" Nick laughed.\n\nJulia had a pause. \"Was I very rude?\"\n\n\"Oh it was all right; it was only awkward for me because you didn't\nknow,\" he replied.\n\n\"I did know; that's why I came.\"\n\n\"How do you mean? My letter couldn't have reached you.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about your letter,\" Julia cast about her for a\nchair and then seated herself on the edge of a sofa with her eyes on the\nfloor.\n\n\"She sat to me yesterday; she was there all the morning; but I didn't\nwrite to tell you. I went at her with great energy and, absurd as it may\nseem to you, found myself very tired afterwards. Besides, in the evening\nI went to see her act.\"\n\n\"Does she act?\" asked Mrs. Dallow.\n\n\"She's an actress: it's her profession. Don't you remember her that day\nat Peter's in Paris? She's already a celebrity; she has great talent;\nshe's engaged at a theatre here and is making a sensation. As I tell\nyou, I saw her last night.\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me,\" Julia returned, looking up at him with a face of\nwhich the intense, the tragic sadness startled him.\n\nHe had been standing before her, but at this he instantly sat down\nclose, taking her passive hand. \"I want to, please; otherwise it must\nseem so odd to you. I knew she was coming when I wrote to you the day\nbefore yesterday. But I didn't tell you then because I didn't know how\nit would turn out, and I didn't want to exult in advance over a poor\nlittle attempt that might come to nothing. Moreover, it was no use\nspeaking of the matter at all unless I told you exactly how it had come\nabout,\" Nick went on, explaining kindly and copiously. \"It was the\nresult of a visit unexpectedly paid me by Gabriel Nash.\"\n\n\"That man--the man who spoke to me?\" Her memory of him shuddered into\nlife.\n\n\"He did what he thought would please you, but I daresay it didn't. You\nmet him in Paris and didn't like him; so I judged best to hold my tongue\nabout him.\"\n\n\"Do _you_ like him?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Great heaven!\" Julia ejaculated, almost under her breath.\n\n\"The reason I was annoyed was because, somehow, when you came in, I\nsuddenly had the air of having got out of those visits and shut myself\nup in town to do something that I had kept from you. And I have been\nvery unhappy till I could explain.\"\n\n\"You don't explain--you can't explain,\" Mrs Dallow declared, turning on\nher companion eyes which, in spite of her studied stillness, expressed\ndeep excitement. \"I knew it--I knew everything; that's why I came.\"\n\n\"It was a sort of second-sight--what they call a brainwave,\" Nick\nsmiled.\n\n\"I felt uneasy, I felt a kind of call; it came suddenly, yesterday. It\nwas irresistible; nothing could have kept me this morning.\"\n\n\"That's very serious, but it's still more delightful. You mustn't go\naway again,\" said Nick. \"We must stick together--forever and ever.\"\n\nHe put his arm round her, but she detached herself as soon as she felt\nits pressure. She rose quickly, moving away, while, mystified, he sat\nlooking up at her as she had looked a few moments before at him. \"I've\nthought it all over; I've been thinking of it all day,\" she began.\n\"That's why I didn't come in.\"\n\n\"Don't think of it too much; it isn't worth it.\"\n\n\"You like it more than anything else. You do--you can't deny it,\" she\nwent on.\n\n\"My dear child, what are you talking about?\" Nick asked, gently...\n\n\"That's what you like--doing what you were this morning; with women\nlolling, with their things off, to be painted, and people like that\nman.\"\n\nNick slowly got up, hesitating. \"My dear Julia, apart from the surprise\nthis morning, do you object to the living model?\"\n\n\"Not a bit, for you.\"\n\n\"What's the inconvenience then, since in my studio they're only for me?\"\n\n\"You love it, you revel in it; that's what you want--the only thing you\nwant!\" Julia broke out.\n\n\"To have models, lolling undressed women, do you mean?\"\n\n\"That's what I felt, what I knew,\" she went on--\"what came over me and\nhaunted me yesterday so that I couldn't throw it off. It seemed to me\nthat if I could see it with my eyes and have the perfect proof I should\nfeel better, I should be quiet. And now I _am_ quiet--after a struggle\nof some hours, I confess. I _have_ seen; the whole thing's before me and\nI'm satisfied.\"\n\n\"I'm not--to me neither the whole thing nor half of it is before me.\nWhat exactly are you talking about?\" Nick demanded.\n\n\"About what you were doing this morning. That's your innermost\npreference, that's your secret passion.\"\n\n\"A feeble scratch at something serious? Yes, it was almost serious,\" he\nsaid. \"But it was an accident, this morning and yesterday: I got on less\nwretchedly than I intended.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you've immense talent,\" Julia returned with a dreariness that\nwas almost droll.\n\n\"No, no, I might have had. I've plucked it up: it's too late for it to\nflower. My dear Julia, I'm perfectly incompetent and perfectly\nresigned.\"\n\n\"Yes, you looked so this morning, when you hung over her. Oh she'll\nbring back your talent!\"\n\n\"She's an obliging and even an intelligent creature, and I've no doubt\nshe would if she could,\" Nick conceded. \"But I've received from you all\nthe help any woman's destined to give me. No one can do for me again\nwhat you've done.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't try it again; I acted in ignorance. Oh I've thought it all\nout!\" Julia declared. And then with a strange face of anguish resting on\nhis own: \"Before it's too late--before it's too late!\"\n\n\"Too late for what?\"\n\n\"For you to be free--for you to be free. And for me--for me to be free\ntoo. You hate everything I like!\" she flashed out. \"Don't pretend, don't\npretend!\" she went on as a sound of protest broke from him.\n\n\"I thought you so awfully _wanted_ me to paint,\" he gasped, flushed and\nstaring.\n\n\"I do--I do. That's why you must be free, why we must part?\"\n\n\"Why we must part--?\"\n\n\"Oh I've turned it well over. I've faced the hard truth. It wouldn't do\nat all!\" Julia rang out.\n\n\"I like the way you talk of it--as if it were a trimming for your\ndress!\" Nick retorted with bitterness. \"Won't it do for you to be loved\nand cherished as well as any woman in England?\"\n\nShe turned away from him, closing her eyes as not to see something\ndangerous. \"You mustn't give anything up for me. I should feel it all\nthe while and I should hate it. I'm not afraid of the truth, but you\nare.\"\n\n\"The truth, dear Julia? I only want to know it,\" Nick insisted. \"It\nseems to me in fact just what I've got hold of. When two persons are\nunited by the tenderest affection and are sane and generous and just, no\ndifficulties that occur in the union their life makes for them are\ninsurmountable, no problems are insoluble.\"\n\nShe appeared for a moment to reflect upon this: it was spoken in a tone\nthat might have touched her. Yet at the end of the moment, lifting her\neyes, she brought out: \"I hate art, as you call it. I thought I did, I\nknew I did; but till this morning I didn't know how much.\"\n\n\"Bless your dear soul, _that_ wasn't art,\" Nick pleaded. \"The real thing\nwill be a thousand miles away from us; it will never come into the\nhouse, _soyez tranquille_. It knows where to look in and where to flee\nshrieking. Why then should you worry?\"\n\n\"Because I want to understand, I want to know what I'm doing. You're an\nartist: you are, you are!\" Julia cried, accusing him passionately.\n\n\"My poor Julia, it isn't so easy as that, nor a character one can take\non from one day to the other. There are all sorts of things; one must be\ncaught young and put through the mill--one must see things as they are.\nThere are very few professions that goes with. There would be sacrifices\nI never can make.\"\n\n\"Well then, there are sacrifices for both of us, and I can't make them\neither. I daresay it's all right for you, but for me it would be a\nterrible mistake. When I think I'm doing a certain thing I mustn't do\njust the opposite,\" she kept on as for true lucidity. \"There are things\nI've thought of, the things I like best; and they're not what you mean.\nIt would be a great deception, and it's not the way I see my life, and\nit would be misery if we don't understand.\"\n\nHe looked at her with eyes not lighted by her words. \"If we don't\nunderstand what?\"\n\n\"That we're utterly different--that you're doing it all for _me_.\"\n\n\"And is that an objection to me--what I do for you?\" he asked.\n\n\"You do too much. You're awfully good, you're generous, you're a dear,\noh yes--a dear. But that doesn't make me believe in it. I didn't at\nbottom, from the first--that's why I made you wait, why I gave you your\nfreedom. Oh I've suspected you,\" Julia continued, \"I had my ideas. It's\nall right for you, but it won't do for me: I'm different altogether. Why\nshould it always be put upon me when I hate it? What have I done? I was\ndrenched with it before.\" These last words, as they broke forth, were\nattended with a quick blush; so that Nick could as quickly discern in\nthem the uncalculated betrayal of an old irritation, an old shame\nalmost--her late husband's flat, inglorious taste for pretty things, his\nindifference to every chance to play a public part. This had been the\nhumiliation of her youth, and it was indeed a perversity of fate that a\nnew alliance should contain for her even an oblique demand for the same\nspirit of accommodation, impose on her the secret bitterness of the same\nconcessions. As Nick stood there before her, struggling sincerely with\nthe force that he now felt to be strong in her, the intense resolution\nto break with him, a force matured in a few hours, he read a riddle that\nhitherto had baffled him, saw a great mystery become simple. A personal\npassion for him had all but thrown her into his arms (the sort of thing\nthat even a vain man--and Nick was not especially vain--might hesitate\nto recognise the strength of); held in check at moments, with a strain\nof the cord that he could still feel vibrate, by her deep, her rare\nambition, and arrested at the last only just in time to save her\ncalculations. His present glimpse of the immense extent of these\ncalculations didn't make him think her cold or poor; there was in fact a\npositive strange heat in them and they struck him rather as grand and\nhigh. The fact that she could drop him even while she longed for\nhim--drop him because it was now fixed in her mind that he wouldn't\nafter all serve her resolve to be associated, so far as a woman could,\nwith great affairs; that she could postpone, and postpone to an\nuncertainty, the satisfaction of an aching tenderness and plan for the\nlong run--this exhibition of will and courage, of the larger scheme that\npossessed her, commanded his admiration on the spot. He paid the heavy\nprice of the man of imagination; he was capable of far excursions of the\nspirit, disloyalties to habit and even to faith, he was open to rare\ncommunications. He ached, on his side, for the moment, to convince her\nthat he would achieve what he wouldn't, for the vision of his future she\nhad tried to entertain shone before him as a bribe and a challenge. It\nstruck him there was nothing he couldn't work for enough with her to be\nso worked with by her. Presently he said:\n\n\"You want to be sure the man you marry will be prime minister of\nEngland. But how can you be really sure with any one?\"\n\n\"I can be really sure some men won't!\" Julia returned.\n\n\"The only safe thing perhaps would be to-marry Mr. Macgeorge,\" he\nsuggested.\n\n\"Possibly not even him.\"\n\n\"You're a prime minister yourself,\" Nick made answer. \"To hold fast to\nyou as I hold, to be determined to be of your party--isn't that\npolitical enough, since you're the incarnation of politics?\"\n\n\"Ah how you hate them!\" she wailed again. \"I saw that when I saw you\nthis morning. The whole place reeked of your aversion.\"\n\n\"My dear child, the greatest statesmen have had their distractions. What\ndo you make of my hereditary talent? That's a tremendous force.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't carry you far.\" Then she terribly added, \"You must be a\ngreat artist.\" He tossed his head at the involuntary contempt of this,\nbut she went on: \"It's beautiful of you to want to give up anything, and\nI like you for it. I shall always like you. We shall be friends, and I\nshall always take an interest--!\"\n\nBut he stopped her there, made a movement which interrupted her phrase,\nand she suffered him to hold her hand as if she were not afraid of him\nnow. \"It isn't only for you,\" he argued gently; \"you're a great deal,\nbut you're not everything. Innumerable vows and pledges repose upon my\nhead. I'm inextricably committed and dedicated. I was brought up in the\ntemple like an infant Samuel; my father was a high-priest and I'm a\nchild of the Lord. And then the life itself--when _you_ speak of it I\nfeel stirred to my depths; it's like a herald's trumpet. Fight _with_\nme, Julia--not against me! Be on my side and we shall do everything. It\nis uplifting to be a great man before the people--to be loved by them,\nto be followed by them. An artist isn't--never, never. Why _should_ he\nbe? Don't forget how clever I am.\"\n\n\"Oh if it wasn't for that!\" she panted, pale with the effort to resist\nhis tone. Then she put it to him: \"Do you pretend that if I were to die\nto-morrow you'd stay in the House?\"\n\n\"If you were to die? God knows! But you do singularly little justice to\nmy incentives,\" he pursued. \"My political career's everything to my\nmother.\"\n\nThis but made her say after a moment: \"Are you afraid of your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, immensely; for she represents ever so many possibilities of\ndisappointment and distress. She represents all my father's as well as\nall her own, and in them my father tragically lives again. On the other\nhand I see him in bliss, as I see my mother, over our marriage and our\nlife of common aspirations--though of course that's not a consideration\nthat I can expect to have power with you.\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly, even smiling with her recovered calmness and\nlucidity. \"You'll never hold high office.\"\n\n\"But why not take me as I am?\"\n\n\"Because I'm abominably keen about that sort of thing--I must recognise\nmy keenness. I must face the ugly truth. I've been through the worst;\nit's all settled.\"\n\n\"The worst, I suppose, was when you found me this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh that was all right--for you.\"\n\n\"You're magnanimous, Julia; but evidently what's good enough for me\nisn't good enough for you.\" Nick spoke with bitterness.\n\n\"I don't like you enough--that's the obstacle,\" she held herself in hand\nto say.\n\n\"You did a year ago; you confessed to it.\"\n\n\"Well, a year ago was a year ago. Things are changed to-day.\"\n\n\"You're very fortunate--to be able to throw away a real devotion,\" Nick\nreturned.\n\nShe had her pocket-handkerchief in her hand, and at this she quickly\npressed it to her lips as to check an exclamation. Then for an instant\nshe appeared to be listening to some sound from outside. He interpreted\nher movement as an honourable impulse to repress the \"Do you mean the\ndevotion I was witness of this morning?\" But immediately afterwards she\nsaid something very different: \"I thought I heard a ring. I've\ntelegraphed for Mrs. Gresham.\"\n\nHe wondered. \"Why did you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh I want her.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, where the curtains had not been drawn, and saw\nin the dusk a cab at the door. When he turned back he went on: \"Why\nwon't you trust me to make you like me, as you call it, better? If I\nmake you like me as well as I like you it will be about enough, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Oh I like you enough for _your_ happiness. And I don't throw away a\ndevotion,\" Mrs. Dallow continued. \"I shall be constantly kind to you. I\nshall be beautiful to you.\"\n\n\"You'll make me lose a fortune,\" Nick after a moment said.\n\nIt brought a slight convulsion, instantly repressed, into her face. \"Ah\nyou may have all the money you want!\"\n\n\"I don't mean yours,\" he answered with plenty of expression of his own.\nHe had determined on the instant, since it might serve, to tell her what\nhe had never breathed to her before. \"Mr. Carteret last year promised me\na pot of money on the day we should be man and wife. He has thoroughly\nset his heart on it.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint Mr. Carteret,\" said Julia. \"I'll go and see\nhim. I'll make it all right,\" she went on. \"Then your work, you know,\nwill bring you an income. The great men get a thousand just for a head.\"\n\n\"I'm only joking,\" Nick returned with sombre eyes that contradicted this\nprofession. \"But what things you deserve I should do!\"\n\n\"Do you mean striking likenesses?\"\n\nHe watched her a moment. \"You do hate it! Pushed to that point, it's\ncurious,\" he audibly mused.\n\n\"Do you mean you're joking about Mr. Carteret's promise?\"\n\n\"No--the promise is real, but I don't seriously offer it as a reason.\"\n\n\"I shall go to Beauclere,\" Julia said. \"You're an hour late,\" she added\nin a different tone; for at that moment the door of the room was thrown\nopen and Mrs. Gresham, the butler pronouncing her name, ushered in.\n\n\"Ah don't impugn my punctuality--it's my character!\" the useful lady\nprotested, putting a sixpence from the cabman into her purse. Nick went\noff at this with a simplified farewell--went off foreseeing exactly what\nhe found the next day, that the useful lady would have received orders\nnot to budge from her hostess's side. He called on the morrow, late in\nthe afternoon, and Julia saw him liberally, in the spirit of her\nassurance that she would be \"beautiful\" to him, that she had not thrown\naway his devotion; but Mrs. Gresham remained, with whatever delicacies\nof deprecation, a spectator of her liberality. Julia looked at him\nkindly, but her companion was more benignant still; so that what Nick\ndid with his own eyes was not to appeal to her to see him a moment\nalone, but to solicit, in the name of this luxury, the second occupant\nof the drawing-room. Mrs. Gresham seemed to say, while Julia said so\nlittle, \"I understand, my poor friend, I know everything--she has told\nme only _her_ side, but I'm so competent that I know yours too--and I\nenter into the whole thing deeply. But it would be as much as my place\nis worth to accommodate you.\" Still, she didn't go so far as to give him\nan inkling of what he learned on the third day and what he had not gone\nso far as to suspect--that the two ladies had made rapid arrangements\nfor a scheme of foreign travel. These arrangements had already been\ncarried out when, at the door of the house in Great Stanhope Street, the\nannouncement was made him that the subtle creatures had started that\nmorning for Paris.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nThey spent on their way to Florence several days in Paris, where Peter\nSherringham had as much free talk with his sister as it often befell one\nmember of their family to have with another. He enjoyed, that is, on two\ndifferent occasions, half an hour's gossip with her in her sitting-room\nat the hotel. On one of these he took the liberty of asking her whether\nor no, decidedly, she meant to marry Nick Dormer. Julia expressed to him\nthat she appreciated his curiosity, but that Nick and she were nothing\nmore than relations and good friends. \"He tremendously wants it,\" Peter\nnone the less observed; to which she simply made answer, \"Well then, he\nmay want!\"\n\nAfter this, for a while, they sat as silent as if the subject had been\nquite threshed out between them. Peter felt no impulse to penetrate\nfurther, for it was not a habit of the Sherringhams to talk with each\nother of their love-affairs; and he was conscious of the particular\ndeterrent that he and Julia entertained in general such different\nsentiments that they could never go far together in discussion. He liked\nher and was sorry for her, thought her life lonely and wondered she\ndidn't make a \"great\" marriage. Moreover he pitied her for being without\nthe interests and consolations he himself had found substantial: those\nof the intellectual, the studious order he considered these to be, not\nknowing how much she supposed she reflected and studied and what an\neducation she had found in her political aspirations, viewed by him as\nscarce more a personal part of her than the livery of her servants or\nthe jewels George Dallow's money had bought. Her relations with Nick\nstruck him as queer, but were fortunately none of his business. No\nbusiness of Julia's was sufficiently his to justify him in an attempt to\nunderstand it. That there should have been a question of her marrying\nNick was the funny thing rather than that the question should have been\ndropped. He liked his clever cousin very well as he was--enough for a\nvague sense that he might be spoiled by alteration to a brother-in-law.\nMoreover, though not perhaps distinctly conscious of this, Peter pressed\nlightly on Julia's doings from a tacit understanding that in this case\nshe would let him off as easily. He couldn't have said exactly what it\nwas he judged it pertinent to be let off from: perhaps from irritating\ninquiry as to whether he had given any more tea-parties for gross young\nwomen connected with the theatre.\n\nPeter's forbearance, however, brought him not quite all the security he\nprefigured. After an interval he indeed went so far as to ask Julia if\nNick had been wanting in respect to her; but this was an appeal intended\nfor sympathy, not for other intervention. She answered: \"Dear no--though\nhe's very provoking.\" Thus Peter guessed that they had had a quarrel in\nwhich it didn't concern him to meddle: he added her epithet and her\nflight from England together, and they made up to his perception one of\nthe little magnified embroilments which do duty for the real in\nsuperficial lives. It was worse to provoke Julia than not, and Peter\nthought Nick's doing so not particularly characteristic of his\nversatility for good. He might wonder why she didn't marry the member\nfor Harsh if the subject had pressingly come up between them; but he\nwondered still more why Nick didn't marry that gentleman's great backer.\nJulia said nothing again, as if to give him a chance to address her some\nchallenge that would save her from gushing; but as his impulse appeared\nto be to change the subject, and as he changed it only by silence, she\nwas reduced to resuming presently:\n\n\"I should have thought you'd have come over to see your friend the\nactress.\"\n\n\"Which of my friends? I know so many actresses,\" Peter pleaded.\n\n\"The woman you inflicted on us in this place a year ago--the one who's\nin London now.\"\n\n\"Oh Miriam Rooth? I should have liked to come over, but I've been tied\nfast. Have you seen her there?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've seen her.\"\n\n\"Do you like her?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"She has a lovely voice,\" Peter hazarded after a moment.\n\n\"I don't know anything about her voice--I haven't heard it.\"\n\n\"But she doesn't act in pantomime, does she?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about her acting. I saw her in private--at Nick\nDormer's studio.\"\n\n\"At Nick's--?\" He was interested now.\n\n\"What was she doing there?\"\n\n\"She was sprawling over the room and--rather insolently--staring at me.\"\n\nIf Mrs. Dallow had wished to \"draw\" her brother she must at this point\nhave suspected she succeeded, in spite of his care to divest his tone of\nall emotion. \"Why, does he know her so well? I didn't know.\"\n\n\"She's sitting to him for her portrait--at least she was then.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I remember--I put him up to that. I'm greatly interested. Is\nthe portrait good?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea--I didn't look at it. I daresay it's like,\"\nJulia threw off.\n\n\"But how in the world\"--and Peter's interest grew franker--\"does Nick\nfind time to paint?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That horrid man brought her.\"\n\n\"Which horrid man?\"--he spoke as if they had their choice.\n\n\"The one Nick thinks so clever--the vulgar little man who was at your\nplace that day and tried to talk to me. I remember he abused theatrical\npeople to me--as if I cared anything about them. But he has apparently\nsomething to do with your girl.\"\n\n\"Oh I recollect him--I had a discussion with him,\" Peter patiently said.\n\n\"How could you? I must go and dress,\" his sister went on more\nimportantly.\n\n\"He _was_ clever, remarkably. Miss Rooth and her mother were old friends\nof his, and he was the first person to speak of them to me.\"\n\n\"What a distinction! I thought him disgusting!\" cried Julia, who was\npressed for time and who had now got up.\n\n\"Oh you're severe,\" said Peter, still bland; but when they separated she\nhad given him something to think of.\n\nThat Nick was painting a beautiful actress was no doubt in part at least\nthe reason why he was provoking and why his most intimate female friend\nhad come abroad. The fact didn't render him provoking to his kinsman:\nPeter had on the contrary been quite sincere when he qualified it as\ninteresting. It became indeed on reflexion so interesting that it had\nperhaps almost as much to do with Sherringham's now prompt rush over to\nLondon as it had to do with Julia's coming away. Reflexion taught him\nfurther that the matter was altogether a delicate one and suggested that\nit was odd he should be mixed up with it in fact when, as Julia's own\naffair, he had but wished to keep out of it. It might after all be his\naffair a little as well--there was somehow a still more pointed\nimplication of that in his sister's saying to him the next day that she\nwished immensely he would take a fancy to Biddy Dormer. She said more:\nshe said there had been a time when she believed he _had_ done\nso--believed too that the poor child herself had believed the same.\nBiddy was far away the nicest girl she knew--the dearest, sweetest,\ncleverest, _best_, and one of the prettiest creatures in England, which\nnever spoiled anything. She would make as charming a wife as ever a man\nhad, suited to any position, however high, and--Julia didn't mind\nmentioning it, since her brother would believe it whether she mentioned\nit or no--was so predisposed in his favour that he would have no trouble\nat all. In short she herself would see him through--she'd answer for it\nthat he'd have but to speak. Biddy's life at home was horrid; she was\nvery sorry for her--the child was worthy of a better fate. Peter\nwondered what constituted the horridness of Biddy's life, and gathered\nthat it mainly arose from the fact of Julia's disliking Lady Agnes and\nGrace and of her profiting comfortably by that freedom to do so which\nwas a fruit of her having given them a house she had perhaps not felt\nthe want of till they were in possession of it. He knew she had always\nliked Biddy, but he asked himself--this was the rest of his wonder--why\nshe had taken to liking her so extraordinarily just now. He liked her\nhimself--he even liked to be talked to about her and could believe\neverything Julia said: the only thing that had mystified him was her\nmotive for suddenly saying it. He had assured her he was perfectly\nsensible of her goodness in so plotting out his future, but was also\nsorry if he had put it into any one's head--most of all into the girl's\nown--that he had ever looked at Biddy with a covetous eye. He wasn't in\nthe least sure she would make a good wife, but liked her quite too much\nto wish to put any such mystery to the test. She was certainly not\noffered them for cruel experiments. As it happened, really, he wasn't\nthinking of marrying any one--he had ever so many grounds for neglecting\nthat. Of course one was never safe against accidents, but one could at\nleast take precautions, and he didn't mind telling her that there were\nseveral he had taken.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, but it seems to me quite the best\nprecaution would be to care for a charming, steady girl like Biddy. Then\nyou'd be quite in shelter, you'd know the worst that can happen to you,\nand it wouldn't be bad.\" The objection he had made to this plea is not\nimportant, especially as it was not quite candid; it need only be\nmentioned that before the pair parted Julia said to him, still in\nreference to their young friend: \"Do go and see her and be nice to her;\nshe'll save you disappointments.\"\n\nThese last words reverberated for him--there was a shade of the\nportentous in them and they seemed to proceed from a larger knowledge of\nthe subject than he himself as yet possessed. They were not absent from\nhis memory when, in the beginning of May, availing himself, to save\ntime, of the night-service, he crossed from Paris to London. He arrived\nbefore the breakfast-hour and went to his sister's house in Great\nStanhope Street, where he always found quarters, were she in town or\nnot. When at home she welcomed him, and in her absence the relaxed\nservants hailed him for the chance he gave them to recover their \"form.\"\nIn either case his allowance of space was large and his independence\ncomplete. He had obtained permission this year to take in scattered\nsnatches rather than as a single draught the quantum of holiday to which\nhe was entitled; and there was, moreover, a question of his being\ntransferred to another capital--in which event he believed he might\ncount on a month or two in England before proceeding to his new post.\n\nHe waited, after breakfast, but a very few minutes before jumping into a\nhansom and rattling away to the north. A part of his waiting indeed\nconsisted of a fidgety walk up Bond Street, during which he looked at\nhis watch three or four times while he paused at shop windows for fear\nof being a little early. In the cab, as he rolled along, after having\ngiven an address--Balaklava Place, Saint John's Wood--the fear he might\nbe too early took curiously at moments the form of a fear that he should\nbe too late: a symbol of the inconsistencies of which his spirit at\npresent was full. Peter Sherringham was nervously formed, too nervously\nfor a diplomatist, and haunted with inclinations and indeed with designs\nwhich contradicted each other. He wanted to be out of it and yet dreaded\nnot to be in it, and on this particular occasion the sense of exclusion\nwas an ache. At the same time he was not unconscious of the impulse to\nstop his cab and make it turn round and drive due south. He saw himself\nlaunched in the breezy fact while morally speaking he was hauled up on\nthe hot sand of the principle, and he could easily note how little these\ntwo faces of the same idea had in common. However, as the consciousness\nof going helped him to reflect, a principle was a poor affair if it\nmerely became a fact. Yet from the hour it did turn to action the action\n_had_ to be the particular one in which he was engaged; so that he was\nin the absurd position of thinking his conduct wiser for the reason\nthat it was directly opposed to his intentions.\n\nHe had kept away from London ever since Miriam Rooth came over;\nresisting curiosity, sympathy, importunate haunting passion, and\nconsidering that his resistance, founded, to be salutary, on a general\nscheme of life, was the greatest success he had yet achieved. He was\ndeeply occupied with plucking up the feeling that attached him to her,\nand he had already, by various little ingenuities, loosened some of its\nroots. He had suffered her to make her first appearance on any stage\nwithout the comfort of his voice or the applause of his hand; saying to\nhimself that the man who could do the more could do the less and that\nsuch an act of fortitude was a proof he should keep straight. It was not\nexactly keeping straight to run over to London three months later and,\nthe hour he arrived, scramble off to Balaklava Place; but after all he\npretended only to be human and aimed in behaviour only at the heroic,\nnever at the monstrous. The highest heroism was obviously three parts\ntact. He had not written to his young friend that he was coming to\nEngland and would call upon her at eleven o'clock in the morning,\nbecause it was his secret pride that he had ceased to correspond with\nher. Sherringham took his prudence where he could find it, and in doing\nso was rather like a drunkard who should flatter himself he had forsworn\nliquor since he didn't touch lemonade.\n\nIt is a sign of how far he was drawn in different directions at once\nthat when, on reaching Balaklava Place and alighting at the door of a\nsmall detached villa of the type of the \"retreat,\" he learned that Miss\nRooth had but a quarter of an hour before quitted the spot with her\nmother--they had gone to the theatre, to rehearsal, said the maid who\nanswered the bell he had set tinkling behind a stuccoed garden-wall:\nwhen at the end of his pilgrimage he was greeted by a disappointment he\nsuddenly found himself relieved and for the moment even saved.\nProvidence was after all taking care of him and he submitted to\nProvidence. He would still be watched over doubtless, even should he\nfollow the two ladies to the theatre, send in his card and obtain\nadmission to the scene of their experiments. All his keen taste for\nthese matters flamed up again, and he wondered what the girl was\nstudying, was rehearsing, what she was to do next. He got back into his\nhansom and drove down the Edgware Road. By the time he reached the\nMarble Arch he had changed his mind again, had determined to let Miriam\nalone for that day. It would be over at eight in the evening--he hardly\nplayed fair--and then he should consider himself free. Instead of\npursuing his friends he directed himself upon a shop in Bond Street to\ntake a place for their performance. On first coming out he had tried, at\none of those establishments strangely denominated \"libraries,\" to get a\nstall, but the people to whom he applied were unable to accommodate\nhim--they hadn't a single seat left. His actual attempt, at another\nlibrary, was more successful: there was no question of obtaining a\nstall, but he might by a miracle still have a box. There was a\nwantonness in paying for a box at a play on which he had already\nexpended four hundred pounds; but while he was mentally measuring this\nabyss an idea came into his head which flushed the extravagance with the\nhue of persuasion.\n\nPeter came out of the shop with the voucher for the box in his pocket,\nturned into Piccadilly, noted that the day was growing warm and fine,\nfelt glad that this time he had no other strict business than to leave a\ncard or two on official people, and asked himself where he should go if\nhe didn't go after Miriam. Then it was that he found himself attaching\na lively desire and imputing a high importance to the possible view of\nNick Dormer's portrait of her. He wondered which would be the natural\nplace at that hour of the day to look for the artist. The House of\nCommons was perhaps the nearest one, but Nick, inconsequent and\nincalculable though so many of his steps, probably didn't keep the\npicture there; and, moreover, it was not generally characteristic of him\nto be in the natural place. The end of Peter's debate was that he again\nentered a hansom and drove to Calcutta Gardens. The hour was early for\ncalling, but cousins with whom one's intercourse was mainly a\nconversational scuffle would accept it as a practical illustration of\nthat method. And if Julia wanted him to be nice to Biddy--which was\nexactly, even if with a different view, what he wanted himself--how\ncould he better testify than by a visit to Lady Agnes--he would have in\ndecency to go to see her some time--at a friendly, fraternising hour\nwhen they would all be likely to be at home?\n\nUnfortunately, as it turned out, they were none of them at home, so that\nhe had to fall back on neutrality and the butler, who was, however, more\nluckily, an old friend. Her ladyship and Miss Dormer were absent from\ntown, paying a visit; and Mr. Dormer was also away, or was on the point\nof going away for the day. Miss Bridget was in London, but was out;\nPeter's informant mentioned with earnest vagueness that he thought she\nhad gone somewhere to take a lesson. On Peter's asking what sort of\nlesson he meant he replied: \"Oh I think--a--the a-sculpture, you know,\nsir.\" Peter knew, but Biddy's lesson in \"a-sculpture\"--it sounded on the\nbutler's lips like a fashionable new art--struck him a little as a\nmockery of the helpful spirit in which he had come to look her up. The\nman had an air of participating respectfully in his disappointment and,\nto make up for it, added that he might perhaps find Mr. Dormer at his\nother address. He had gone out early and had directed his servant to\ncome to Rosedale Road in an hour or two with a portmanteau: he was going\ndown to Beauclere in the course of the day, Mr. Carteret being\nill--perhaps Mr. Sherringham didn't know it. Perhaps too Mr. Sherringham\nwould catch him in Rosedale Road before he took his train--he was to\nhave been busy there for an hour. This was worth trying, and Peter\nimmediately drove to Rosedale Road; where in answer to his ring the door\nwas opened to him by Biddy Dormer.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nWhen that young woman saw him her cheek exhibited the prettiest,\npleased, surprised red he had ever observed there, though far from\nunacquainted with its living tides, and she stood smiling at him with\nthe outer dazzle in her eyes, still making him no motion to enter. She\nonly said, \"Oh Peter!\" and then, \"I'm all alone.\"\n\n\"So much the better, dear Biddy. Is that any reason I shouldn't come\nin?\"\n\n\"Dear no--do come in. You've just missed Nick; he has gone to the\ncountry--half an hour ago.\" She had on a large apron and in her hand\ncarried a small stick, besmeared, as his quick eye saw, with\nmodelling-clay. She dropped the door and fled back before him into the\nstudio, where, when he followed her, she was in the act of flinging a\ndamp cloth over a rough head, in clay, which, in the middle of the room,\nwas supported on a high wooden stand. The effort to hide what she had\nbeen doing before he caught a glimpse of it made her redder still and\nled to her smiling more, to her laughing with a confusion of shyness and\ngladness that charmed him. She rubbed her hands on her apron, she pulled\nit off, she looked delightfully awkward, not meeting Peter's eye, and\nshe said: \"I'm just scraping here a little--you mustn't mind me. What I\ndo is awful, you know. _Please_, Peter, don't look, I've been coming\nhere lately to make my little mess, because mamma doesn't particularly\nlike it at home. I've had a lesson or two from a lady who exhibits, but\nyou wouldn't suppose it to see what I do. Nick's so kind; he lets me\ncome here; he uses the studio so little; I do what I want, or rather\nwhat I can. What a pity he's gone--he'd have been so glad. I'm really\nalone--I hope you don't mind. Peter, _please_ don't look.\"\n\nPeter was not bent on looking; his eyes had occupation enough in Biddy's\nown agreeable aspect, which was full of a rare element of domestication\nand responsibility. Though she had, stretching her bravery, taken\npossession of her brother's quarters, she struck her visitor as more at\nhome and more herself than he had ever seen her. It was the first time\nshe had been, to his notice, so separate from her mother and sister. She\nseemed to know this herself and to be a little frightened by it--just\nenough to make him wish to be reassuring. At the same time Peter also,\non this occasion, found himself touched with diffidence, especially\nafter he had gone back and closed the door and settled down to a regular\ncall; for he became acutely conscious of what Julia had said to him in\nParis and was unable to rid himself of the suspicion that it had been\nsaid with Biddy's knowledge. It wasn't that he supposed his sister had\ntold the girl she meant to do what she could to make him propose to her:\nthat would have been cruel to her--if she liked him enough to\nconsent--in Julia's perfect uncertainty. But Biddy participated by\nimagination, by divination, by a clever girl's secret, tremulous\ninstincts, in her good friend's views about her, and this probability\nconstituted for Sherringham a sort of embarrassing publicity. He had\nimpressions, possibly gross and unjust, in regard to the way women move\nconstantly together amid such considerations and subtly\nintercommunicate, when they don't still more subtly dissemble, the hopes\nor fears of which persons of the opposite sex form the subject.\nTherefore poor Biddy would know that if she failed to strike him in the\nright light it wouldn't be for want of an attention definitely called to\nher claims. She would have been tacitly rejected, virtually condemned.\nHe couldn't without an impulse of fatuity endeavour to make up for this\nto her by consoling kindness; he was aware that if any one knew it a man\nwould be ridiculous who should take so much as that for granted. But no\none would know it: he oddly enough in this calculation of security left\nBiddy herself out. It didn't occur to him that she might have a secret,\nsmall irony to spare for his ingenious and magnanimous effort to show\nher how much he liked her in reparation to her for not liking her more.\nThis high charity coloured at any rate the whole of his visit to\nRosedale Road, the whole of the pleasant, prolonged chat that kept him\nthere more than an hour. He begged the girl to go on with her work, not\nto let him interrupt it; and she obliged him at last, taking the cloth\noff the lump of clay and giving him a chance to be delightful by\nguessing that the shapeless mass was intended, or would be intended\nafter a while, for Nick. He saw she was more comfortable when she began\nagain to smooth it and scrape it with her little stick, to manipulate it\nwith an ineffectual air of knowing how; for this gave her something to\ndo, relieved her nervousness and permitted her to turn away from him\nwhen she talked.\n\nHe walked about the room and sat down; got up and looked at Nick's\nthings; watched her at moments in silence--which made her always say in\na minute that he was not to pass judgement or she could do nothing;\nobserved how her position before her high stand, her lifted arms, her\nturns of the head, considering her work this way and that, all helped\nher to be pretty. She repeated again and again that it was an immense\npity about Nick, till he was obliged to say he didn't care a straw for\nNick and was perfectly content with the company he found. This was not\nthe sort of tone he thought it right, given the conditions, to take; but\nthen even the circumstances didn't require him to pretend he liked her\nless than he did. After all she was his cousin; she would cease to be so\nif she should become his wife; but one advantage of her not entering\ninto that relation was precisely that she would remain his cousin. It\nwas very pleasant to find a young, bright, slim, rose-coloured kinswoman\nall ready to recognise consanguinity when one came back from cousinless\nforeign lands. Peter talked about family matters; he didn't know, in his\nexile, where no one took an interest in them, what a fund of latent\ncuriosity about them he treasured. It drew him on to gossip accordingly\nand to feel how he had with Biddy indefeasible properties in\ncommon--ever so many things as to which they'd always understand each\nother _\u00c3\u00a0 demi-mot_. He smoked a cigarette because she begged him--people\nalways smoked in studios and it made her feel so much more an artist.\nShe apologised for the badness of her work on the ground that Nick was\nso busy he could scarcely ever give her a sitting; so that she had to do\nthe head from photographs and occasional glimpses. They had hoped to be\nable to put in an hour that morning, but news had suddenly come that Mr.\nCarteret was worse, and Nick had hurried down to Beauclere. Mr. Carteret\nwas very ill, poor old dear, and Nick and he were immense friends. Nick\nhad always been charming to him. Peter and Biddy took the concerns of\nthe houses of Dormer and Sherringham in order, and the young man felt\nafter a little as if they were as wise as a French _conseil de famille_\nand settling what was best for every one. He heard all about Lady Agnes;\nhe showed an interest in the detail of her existence that he had not\nsupposed himself to possess, though indeed Biddy threw out intimations\nwhich excited his curiosity, presenting her mother in a light that might\ncall on his sympathy.\n\n\"I don't think she has been very happy or very pleased of late,\" the\ngirl said. \"I think she has had some disappointments, poor dear mamma;\nand Grace has made her go out of town for three or four days in the hope\nof a little change. They've gone down to see an old lady, Lady St.\nDunstans, who never comes to London now and who, you know--she's\ntremendously old--was papa's godmother. It's not very lively for Grace,\nbut Grace is such a dear she'll do anything for mamma. Mamma will go\nanywhere, no matter at what risk of discomfort, to see people she can\ntalk with about papa.\"\n\nBiddy added in reply to a further question that what her mother was\ndisappointed about was--well, themselves, her children and all their\naffairs; and she explained that Lady Agnes wanted all kinds of things\nfor them that didn't come, that they didn't get or seem likely to get,\nso that their life appeared altogether a failure. She wanted a great\ndeal, Biddy admitted; she really wanted everything, for she had thought\nin her happier days that everything was to be hers. She loved them all\nso much and was so proud too: she couldn't get over the thought of their\nnot being successful. Peter was unwilling to press at this point, for he\nsuspected one of the things Lady Agnes wanted; but Biddy relieved him a\nlittle by describing her as eager above all that Grace should get\nmarried.\n\n\"That's too unselfish of her,\" he pronounced, not caring at all for\nGrace. \"Cousin Agnes ought to keep her near her always, if Grace is so\nobliging and devoted.\"\n\n\"Oh mamma would give up anything of that sort for our good; she wouldn't\nsacrifice us that way!\" Biddy protested. \"Besides, I'm the one to stay\nwith mamma; not that I can manage and look after her and do everything\nso well as Grace. But, you know, I _want_ to,\" said Biddy with a liquid\nnote in her voice--and giving her lump of clay a little stab for\nmendacious emphasis.\n\n\"But doesn't your mother want the rest of you to get married--Percival\nand Nick and you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"Oh she has given up Percy. I don't suppose she thinks it would do. Dear\nNick of course--that's just what she does want.\"\n\nHe had a pause. \"And you, Biddy?\"\n\n\"Oh I daresay. But that doesn't signify--I never shall.\"\n\nPeter got up at this; the tone of it set him in motion and he took a\nturn round the room. He threw off something cheap about her being too\nproud; to which she replied that that was the only thing for a girl to\nbe to get on.\n\n\"What do you mean by getting on?\"--and he stopped with his hands in his\npockets on the other side of the studio.\n\n\"I mean crying one's eyes out!\" Biddy unexpectedly exclaimed; but she\ndrowned the effect of this pathetic paradox in a laugh of clear\nirrelevance and in the quick declaration: \"Of course it's about Nick\nthat she's really broken-hearted.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with Nick?\" he went on with all his diplomacy.\n\n\"Oh Peter, what's the matter with Julia?\" Biddy quavered softly back to\nhim, her eyes suddenly frank and mournful. \"I daresay you know what we\nall hoped, what we all supposed from what they told us. And now they\nwon't!\" said the girl.\n\n\"Yes, Biddy, I know. I had the brightest prospect of becoming your\nbrother-in-law: wouldn't that have been it--or something like that? But\nit's indeed visibly clouded. What's the matter with them? May I have\nanother cigarette?\" Peter came back to the wide, cushioned bench where\nhe had previously lounged: this was the way they took up the subject he\nwanted most to look into. \"Don't they know how to love?\" he speculated\nas he seated himself again.\n\n\"It seems a kind of fatality!\" Biddy sighed.\n\nHe said nothing for some moments, at the end of which he asked if his\ncompanion were to be quite alone during her mother's absence. She\nreplied that this parent was very droll about that: would never leave\nher alone and always thought something dreadful would happen to her. She\nhad therefore arranged that Florence Tressilian should come and stay in\nCalcutta Gardens for the next few days--to look after her and see she\ndid no wrong. Peter inquired with fulness into Florence Tressilian's\nidentity: he greatly hoped that for the success of Lady Agnes's\nprecautions she wasn't a flighty young genius like Biddy. She was\ndescribed to him as tremendously nice and tremendously clever, but also\ntremendously old and tremendously safe; with the addition that Biddy was\ntremendously fond of her and that while she remained in Calcutta Gardens\nthey expected to enjoy themselves tremendously. She was to come that\nafternoon before dinner.\n\n\"And are you to dine at home?\" said Peter.\n\n\"Certainly; where else?\"\n\n\"And just you two alone? Do you call that enjoying yourselves\ntremendously?\"\n\n\"It will do for me. No doubt I oughtn't in modesty to speak for poor\nFlorence.\"\n\n\"It isn't fair to her; you ought to invite some one to meet her.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you, Peter?\" the girl asked, turning to him quickly and\nwith a look that vanished the instant he caught it.\n\n\"Try me. I'll come like a shot.\"\n\n\"That's kind,\" said Biddy, dropping her hands and now resting her eyes\non him gratefully. She remained in this position as if under a charm;\nthen she jerked herself back to her work with the remark: \"Florence will\nlike that immensely.\"\n\n\"I'm delighted to please Florence--your description of her's so\nattractive!\" Sherringham laughed. And when his companion asked him if he\nminded there not being a great feast, because when her mother went away\nshe allowed her a fixed amount for that sort of thing and, as he might\nimagine, it wasn't millions--when Biddy, with the frankness of their\npleasant kinship, touched anxiously on this economic point\n(illustrating, as Peter saw, the lucidity with which Lady Agnes had had\nin her old age to learn to recognise the occasions when she could be\nconveniently frugal) he answered that the shortest dinners were the\nbest, especially when one was going to the theatre. That was his case\nto-night, and did Biddy think he might look to Miss Tressilian to go\nwith them? They'd have to dine early--he wanted not to miss a moment.\n\n\"The theatre--Miss Tressilian?\" she stared, interrupted and in suspense\nagain.\n\n\"Would it incommode you very much to dine say at 7.15 and accept a place\nin my box? The finger of Providence was in it when I took a box an hour\nago. I particularly like your being free to go--if you are free.\"\n\nShe began almost to rave with pleasure. \"Dear Peter, how good you are!\nThey'll have it at any hour. Florence will be so glad.\"\n\n\"And has Florence seen Miss Rooth?\"\n\n\"Miss Rooth?\" the girl repeated, redder than before. He felt on the spot\nthat she had heard of the expenditure of his time and attention on that\nyoung lady. It was as if she were conscious of how conscious he would\nhimself be in speaking of her, and there was a sweetness in her\nallowance for him on that score. But Biddy was more confused for him\nthan he was for himself. He guessed in a moment how much she had thought\nover what she had heard; this was indicated by her saying vaguely, \"No,\nno, I've not seen her.\" Then she knew she was answering a question he\nhadn't asked her, and she went on: \"We shall be too delighted. I saw\nher--perhaps you remember--in your rooms in Paris. I thought her so\nwonderful then! Every one's talking of her here. But we don't go to the\ntheatre much, you know: we don't have boxes offered us except when _you_\ncome. Poor Nick's too much taken up in the evening. I've wanted awfully\nto see her. They say she's magnificent.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Peter was glad to be able honestly to answer. \"I haven't\nseen her.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen her?\"\n\n\"Never, Biddy. I mean on the stage. In private often--yes,\" he\nconscientiously added.\n\n\"Oh!\" Biddy exclaimed, bending her face on Nick's bust again. She asked\nhim no question about the new star, and he offered her no further\ninformation. There were things in his mind pulling him different ways,\nso that for some minutes silence was the result of the conflict. At last\nhe said, after an hesitation caused by the possibility that she was\nignorant of the fact he had lately elicited from Julia, though it was\nmore probable she might have learned it from the same source:\n\n\"Am I perhaps indiscreet in alluding to the circumstance that Nick has\nbeen painting Miss Rooth's portrait?\"\n\n\"You're not indiscreet in alluding to it to me, because I know it.\"\n\n\"Then there's no secret nor mystery about it?\"\n\nBiddy just considered. \"I don't think mamma knows it.\"\n\n\"You mean you've been keeping it from her because she wouldn't like it?\"\n\n\"We're afraid she may think papa wouldn't have liked it.\"\n\nThis was said with an absence of humour at which Peter could but show\namusement, though he quickly recovered himself, repenting of any\napparent failure of respect to the high memory of his late celebrated\nrelative. He threw off rather vaguely: \"Ah yes, I remember that great\nman's ideas,\" and then went on: \"May I ask if you know it, the fact\nwe're talking of, through Julia or through Nick?\"\n\n\"I know it from both of them.\"\n\n\"Then if you're in their confidence may I further ask if this\nundertaking of Nick's is the reason why things seem to be at an end\nbetween them?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't think she likes it,\" Biddy had to say.\n\n\"Isn't it good?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't mean the picture--she hasn't seen it. But his having done\nit.\"\n\n\"Does she dislike it so much that that's why she won't marry him?\"\n\nBiddy gave up her work, moving away from it to look at it. She came and\nsat down on the long bench on which Sherringham had placed himself. Then\nshe broke out: \"Oh Peter, it's a great trouble--it's a very great\ntrouble; and I can't tell you, for I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"If I ask you,\" he said, \"it's not to pry into what doesn't concern me;\nbut Julia's my sister, and I can't after all help taking some interest\nin her life. She tells me herself so little. She doesn't think me\nworthy.\"\n\n\"Ah poor Julia!\" Biddy wailed defensively. Her tone recalled to him that\nJulia had at least thought him worthy to unite himself to Bridget\nDormer, and inevitably betrayed that the girl was thinking of that also.\nWhile they both thought of it they sat looking into each other's eyes.\n\n\"Nick, I'm sure, doesn't treat _you_ that way; I'm sure he confides in\nyou; he talks to you about his occupations, his ambitions,\" Peter\ncontinued. \"And you understand him, you enter into them, you're nice to\nhim, you help him.\"\n\n\"Oh Nick's life--it's very dear to me,\" Biddy granted.\n\n\"That must be jolly for him.\"\n\n\"It makes _me_ very happy.\"\n\nPeter uttered a low, ambiguous groan; then he cried with irritation;\n\"What the deuce is the matter with them then? Why can't they hit it off\ntogether and be quiet and rational and do what every one wants them to?\"\n\n\"Oh Peter, it's awfully complicated!\" the girl sighed with sagacity.\n\n\"Do you mean that Nick's in love with her?\"\n\n\"In love with Julia?\"\n\n\"No, no, with Miriam Rooth.\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly, then with a smile which struck him as one of\nthe sweetest things he had ever seen--it conveyed, at the expense of her\nown prospects, such a shy, generous little mercy of reassurance--\"He\nisn't, Peter,\" she brought out. \"Julia thinks it trifling--all that\nsort of thing,\" she added \"She wants him to go in for different\nhonours.\"\n\n\"Julia's the oddest woman. I mean I thought she loved him,\" Peter\nexplained. \"And when you love a person--!\" He continued to make it out,\nleaving his sentence impatiently unfinished, while Biddy, with lowered\neyes, sat waiting--it so interested her--to learn what you did when you\nloved a person. \"I can't conceive her giving him up. He has great\nability, besides being such a good fellow.\"\n\n\"It's for his happiness, Peter--that's the way she reasons,\" Biddy set\nforth. \"She does it for an idea; she has told me a great deal about it,\nand I see the way she feels.\"\n\n\"You try to, Biddy, because you're such a dear good-natured girl, but I\ndon't believe you do in the least,\" he took the liberty of replying.\n\"It's too little the way you yourself would feel. Julia's idea, as you\ncall it, must be curious.\"\n\n\"Well, it is, Peter,\" Biddy mournfully admitted. \"She won't risk not\ncoming out at the top.\"\n\n\"At the top of what?\"\n\n\"Oh of everything.\" Her tone showed a trace of awe of such high views.\n\n\"Surely one's at the top of everything when one's in love.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Do you doubt it?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"I've never been in love and I never shall be.\"\n\n\"You're as perverse, in your way, as Julia,\" he returned to this. \"But I\nconfess I don't understand Nick's attitude any better. He seems to me,\nif I may say so, neither fish nor flesh.\"\n\n\"Oh his attitude's very noble, Peter; his state of mind's wonderfully\ninteresting,\" Biddy pleaded. \"Surely _you_ must be in favour of art,\"\nshe beautifully said.\n\nIt made him look at her a moment. \"Dear Biddy, your little digs are as\nsoft as zephyrs.\"\n\nShe coloured, but she protested. \"My little digs? What do you mean?\nAren't you in favour of art?\"\n\n\"The question's delightfully simple. I don't know what you're talking\nabout. Everything has its place. A parliamentary life,\" he opined,\n\"scarce seems to me the situation for portrait-painting.\"\n\n\"That's just what Nick says.\"\n\n\"You talk of it together a great deal?\"\n\n\"Yes, Nick's very good to me.\"\n\n\"Clever Nick! And what do you advise him?\"\n\n\"Oh to _do_ something.\"\n\n\"That's valuable,\" Peter laughed. \"Not to give up his sweetheart for the\nsake of a paint-pot, I hope?\"\n\n\"Never, never, Peter! It's not a question of his giving up,\" Biddy\npursued, \"for Julia has herself shaken free. I think she never really\nfelt safe--she loved him, but was afraid of him. Now she's only\nafraid--she has lost the confidence she tried to have. Nick has tried to\nhold her, but she has wrested herself away. Do you know what she said to\nme? She said, 'My confidence has gone for ever.'\"\n\n\"I didn't know she was such a prig!\" Julia's brother commented. \"They're\nqueer people, verily, with water in their veins instead of blood. You\nand I wouldn't be like that, should we?--though you _have_ taken up such\na discouraging position about caring for a fellow.\"\n\n\"I care for art,\" poor Biddy returned.\n\n\"You do, to some purpose\"--and Peter glanced at the bust.\n\n\"To that of making you laugh at me.\"\n\nBut this he didn't heed. \"Would you give a good man up for 'art'?\"\n\n\"A good man? What man?\"\n\n\"Well, say me--if I wanted to marry you.\"\n\nShe had the briefest of pauses. \"Of course I would--in a moment. At any\nrate I'd give up the House of Commons,\" she amended. \"That's what Nick's\ngoing to do now--only you mustn't tell any one.\"\n\nPeter wondered. \"He's going to chuck up his seat?\"\n\n\"I think his mind is made up to it. He has talked me over--we've had\nsome deep discussions. Yes, I'm on the side of art!\" she ardently said.\n\n\"Do you mean in order to paint--to paint that girl?\" Peter went on.\n\n\"To paint every one--that's what he wants. By keeping his seat he hasn't\nkept Julia, and she was the thing he cared for most in public life. When\nhe has got out of the whole thing his attitude, as he says, will be at\nleast clear. He's tremendously interesting about it, Peter,\" Biddy\ndeclared; \"has talked to me wonderfully--has won me over. Mamma's\nheart-broken; telling _her_ will be the hardest part.\"\n\n\"If she doesn't know,\" he asked, \"why then is she heart-broken?\"\n\n\"Oh at the hitch about their marriage--she knows that. Their marriage\nhas been so what she wanted. She thought it perfection. She blames Nick\nfearfully. She thinks he held the whole thing in his hand and that he\nhas thrown away a magnificent opportunity.\"\n\n\"And what does Nick say to her?\"\n\n\"He says, 'Dear old mummy!'\"\n\n\"That's good,\" Peter pronounced.\n\n\"I don't know what will become of her when this other blow arrives,\"\nBiddy went on. \"Poor Nick wants to please her--he does, he does. But, as\nhe says, you can't please every one and you must before you die please\nyourself a little.\"\n\nNick's kinsman, whose brother-in-law he was to have been, sat looking\nat the floor; the colour had risen to his face while he listened. Then\nhe sprang up and took another turn about the room. His companion's\nartless but vivid recital had set his blood in motion. He had taken\nNick's political prospects very much for granted, thought of them as\ndefinite and almost dazzling. To learn there was something for which he\nwas ready to renounce such honours, and to recognise the nature of that\nbribe, affected our young man powerfully and strangely. He felt as if he\nhad heard the sudden blare of a trumpet, yet felt at the same time as if\nhe had received a sudden slap in the face. Nick's bribe was \"art\"--the\nstrange temptress with whom he himself had been wrestling and over whom\nhe had finally ventured to believe that wisdom and training had won a\nvictory. There was something in the conduct of his old friend and\nplayfellow that made all his reasonings small. So unexpected, so\ncourageous a choice moved him as a reproach and a challenge. He felt\nashamed of having placed himself so unromantically on his guard, and\nrapidly said to himself that if Nick could afford to allow so much for\n\"art\" he might surely exhibit some of the same confidence. There had\nnever been the least avowed competition between the cousins--their lines\nlay too far apart for that; but they nevertheless rode their course in\nsight of each other, and Peter had now the impression of suddenly seeing\nNick Dormer give his horse the spur, bound forward and fly over a wall.\nHe was put on his mettle and hadn't to look long to spy an obstacle he\ntoo might ride at. High rose his curiosity to see what warrant his\nkinsman might have for such risks--how he was mounted for such exploits.\nHe really knew little about Nick's talent--so little as to feel no right\nto exclaim \"What an ass!\" when Biddy mentioned the fact which the\nexistence of real talent alone could redeem from absurdity. All his\neagerness to see what Nick had been able to make of such a subject as\nMiriam Rooth came back to him: though it was what mainly had brought him\nto Rosedale Road he had forgotten it in the happy accident of his\nencounter with the girl. He was conscious that if the surprise of a\nrevelation of power were in store for him Nick would be justified more\nthan he himself would feel reinstated in self-respect; since the courage\nof renouncing the forum for the studio hovered before him as greater\nthan the courage of marrying an actress whom one was in love with: the\nreward was in the latter case so much more immediate. Peter at any rate\nasked Biddy what Nick had done with his portrait of Miriam. He hadn't\nseen it anywhere in rummaging about the room.\n\n\"I think it's here somewhere, but I don't know,\" she replied, getting up\nto look vaguely round her.\n\n\"Haven't you seen it? Hasn't he shown it to you?\"\n\nShe rested her eyes on him strangely a moment, then turned them away\nwith a mechanical air of still searching. \"I think it's in the room, put\naway with its face to the wall.\"\n\n\"One of those dozen canvases with their backs to us?\"\n\n\"One of those perhaps.\"\n\n\"Haven't you tried to see?\"\n\n\"I haven't touched them\"--and Biddy had a colour.\n\n\"Hasn't Nick had it out to show you?\"\n\n\"He says it's in too bad a state--it isn't finished--it won't do.\"\n\n\"And haven't you had the curiosity to turn it round for yourself?\"\n\nThe embarrassed look in her face deepened under his insistence and it\nseemed to him that her eyes pleaded with him a moment almost to tears.\n\"I've had an idea he wouldn't like it.\"\n\nHer visitor's own desire, however, had become too sharp for easy\nforbearance. He laid his hand on two or three canvases which proved, as\nhe extricated them, to be either blank or covered with rudimentary\nforms. \"Dear Biddy, have you such intense delicacy?\" he asked, pulling\nout something else.\n\nThe inquiry was meant in familiar kindness, for Peter was struck even to\nadmiration with her having a sense of honour that all girls haven't. She\nmust in this particular case have longed for a sight of Nick's work--the\nwork that had brought about such a crisis in his life. But she had\npassed hours in his studio alone without permitting herself a stolen\npeep; she was capable of that if she believed it would please him. Peter\nliked a charming girl's being capable of that--he had known charming\ngirls who wouldn't in the least have been--and his question was really a\nform of homage. Biddy, however, apparently discovered some light mockery\nin it, and she broke out incongruously:\n\n\"I haven't wanted so much to see it! I don't care for her so much as\nthat!\"\n\n\"So much as what?\" He couldn't but wonder.\n\n\"I don't care for his actress--for that vulgar creature. I don't like\nher!\" said Biddy almost startlingly.\n\nPeter stared. \"I thought you hadn't seen her.\"\n\n\"I saw her in Paris--twice. She was wonderfully clever, but she didn't\ncharm me.\"\n\nHe quickly considered, saying then all kindly: \"I won't inflict the\nthing on you in that case--we'll leave it alone for the present.\" Biddy\nmade no reply to this at first, but after a moment went straight over\nto the row of stacked canvases and exposed several of them to the light.\n\"Why did you say you wished to go to the theatre to-night?\" her\ncompanion continued.\n\nStill she was silent; after which, with her back turned to him and a\nlittle tremor in her voice while she drew forth successively her\nbrother's studies, she made answer: \"For the sake of your company,\nPeter! Here it is, I think,\" she added, moving a large canvas with some\neffort. \"No, no, I'll hold it for you. Is that the light?\"\n\nShe wouldn't let him take it; she bade him stand off and allow her to\nplace it in the right position. In this position she carefully presented\nit, supporting it at the proper angle from behind and showing her head\nand shoulders above it. From the moment his eyes rested on the picture\nPeter accepted this service without protest. Unfinished, simplified and\nin some portions merely suggested, it was strong, vivid and assured, it\nhad already the look of life and the promise of power. Peter felt all\nthis and was startled, was strangely affected--he had no idea Nick moved\nwith that stride. Miriam, seated, was represented in three-quarters,\nalmost to her feet. She leaned forward with one of her legs crossed over\nthe other, her arms extended and foreshortened, her hands locked\ntogether round her knee. Her beautiful head was bent a little,\nbroodingly, and her splendid face seemed to look down at life. She had a\ngrand appearance of being raised aloft, with a wide regard, a survey\nfrom a height of intelligence, for the great field of the artist, all\nthe figures and passions he may represent. Peter asked himself where his\nkinsman had learned to paint like that. He almost gasped at the\ncomposition of the thing and at the drawing of the difficult arms. Biddy\nabstained from looking round the corner of the canvas as she held it;\nshe only watched, in Peter's eyes, for this gentleman's impression of\nit. That she easily caught, and he measured her impression--her\nimpression of _his_ impression--when he went after a few minutes to\nrelieve her. She let him lift the thing out of her grasp; he moved it\nand rested it, so that they could still see it, against the high back of\na chair. \"It's tremendously good,\" he then handsomely pronounced.\n\n\"Dear, dear Nick,\" Biddy murmured, looking at it now.\n\n\"Poor, poor Julia!\" Peter was prompted to exclaim in a different tone.\nHis companion made no rejoinder to this, and they stood another minute\nor two side by side and in silence, gazing at the portrait. At last he\ntook up his hat--he had no more time, he must go. \"Will you come\nto-night all the same?\" he asked with a laugh that was somewhat awkward\nand an offer of a hand-shake.\n\n\"All the same?\" Biddy seemed to wonder.\n\n\"Why you say she's a terrible creature,\" Peter completed with his eyes\non the painted face.\n\n\"Oh anything for art!\" Biddy smiled.\n\n\"Well, at seven o'clock then.\" And Sherringham departed, leaving the\ngirl alone with the Tragic Muse and feeling with a quickened rush the\nbeauty of that young woman as well as, all freshly, the peculiar\npossibilities of Nick.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nIt was not till after the noon of the next day that he was to see Miriam\nRooth. He wrote her a note that evening, to be delivered to her at the\ntheatre, and during the performance she sent round to him a card with\n\"All right, come to luncheon to-morrow\" scrawled on it in pencil.\n\nWhen he presented himself at Balaklava Place he learned that the two\nladies had not come in--they had gone again early to rehearsal; but they\nhad left word that he was to be pleased to wait, they would appear from\none moment to the other. It was further mentioned to him, as he was\nushered into the drawing-room, that Mr. Dashwood was in possession of\nthat ground. This circumstance, however, Peter barely noted: he had been\nsoaring so high for the past twelve hours that he had almost lost\nconsciousness of the minor differences of earthly things. He had taken\nBiddy Dormer and her friend Miss Tressilian home from the play and after\nleaving them had walked about the streets, had roamed back to his\nsister's house, in a state of exaltation the intenser from his having\nfor the previous time contained himself, thinking it more decorous and\nconsiderate, less invidious and less blatant, not to \"rave.\" Sitting\nthere in the shade of the box with his companions he had watched Miriam\nin attentive but inexpressive silence, glowing and vibrating inwardly,\nyet for these fine, deep reasons not committing himself to the spoken\nrapture. Delicacy, it appeared to him, should rule the hour; and indeed\nhe had never had a pleasure less alloyed than this little period of\nstill observation and repressed ecstasy. Miriam's art lost nothing by\nit, and Biddy's mild nearness only gained. This young lady was virtually\nmute as well--wonderingly, dauntedly, as if she too associated with the\nperformer various other questions than that of her mastery of her art.\nTo this mastery Biddy's attitude was a candid and liberal tribute: the\npoor girl sat quenched and pale, as if in the blinding light of a\ncomparison by which it would be presumptuous even to be annihilated. Her\nsubjection, however, was a gratified, a charmed subjection: there was\nbeneficence in such beauty--the beauty of the figure that moved before\nthe footlights and spoke in music--even if it deprived one of hope.\nPeter didn't say to her in vulgar elation and in reference to her\nwhimsical profession of dislike at the studio, \"Well, do you find our\nfriend so disagreeable now?\" and she was grateful to him for his\nforbearance, for the tacit kindness of which the idea seemed to be: \"My\npoor child, I'd prefer you if I could; but--judge for yourself--how can\nI? Expect of me only the possible. Expect that certainly, but only\nthat.\" In the same degree Peter liked Biddy's sweet, hushed air of\njudging for herself, of recognising his discretion and letting him off\nwhile she was lost in the illusion, in the convincing picture of the\nstage. Miss Tressilian did most of the criticism: she broke out\ncheerfully and sonorously from time to time, in reference to the\nactress, \"Most striking certainly,\" or \"She _is_ clever, isn't she?\" She\nuttered a series of propositions to which her companions found it\nimpossible to respond. Miss Tressilian was disappointed in nothing but\ntheir enjoyment: they didn't seem to think the exhibition as amusing as\nshe.\n\nWalking away through the ordered void of Lady Agnes's quarter, with the\nfour acts of the play glowing again before him in the smokeless London\nnight, Peter found the liveliest thing in his impression the certitude\nthat if he had never seen Miriam before and she had had for him none of\nthe advantages of association, he would still have recognised in her\nperformance the richest interest the theatre had ever offered him. He\nfloated in the felicity of it, in the general encouragement of a sense\nof the perfectly _done_, in the almost aggressive bravery of still\nlarger claims for an art which could so triumphantly, so exquisitely\nrender life. \"Render it?\" he said to himself. \"Create it and reveal it,\nrather; give us something new and large and of the first order!\" He had\n_seen_ Miriam now; he had never seen her before; he had never seen her\ntill he saw her in her conditions. Oh her conditions--there were many\nthings to be said about them; they were paltry enough as yet, inferior,\ninadequate, obstructive, as compared with the right, full, finished\nsetting of such a talent; but the essence of them was now, irremovably,\nin our young man's eyes, the vision of how the uplifted stage and the\nlistening house transformed her. That idea of her having no character of\nher own came back to him with a force that made him laugh in the empty\nstreet: this was a disadvantage she reduced so to nothing that obviously\nhe hadn't known her till to-night. Her character was simply to hold you\nby the particular spell; any other--the good nature of home, the\nrelation to her mother, her friends, her lovers, her debts, the practice\nof virtues or industries or vices--was not worth speaking of. These\nthings were the fictions and shadows; the representation was the deep\nsubstance.\n\nPeter had as he went an intense vision--he had often had it before--of\nthe conditions still absent, the great and complete ones, those which\nwould give the girl's talent a superior, a discussable stage. More than\never he desired them, mentally invoked them, filled them out in\nimagination, cheated himself with the idea that they were possible. He\nsaw them in a momentary illusion and confusion: a great academic,\nartistic theatre, subsidised and unburdened with money-getting, rich in\nits repertory, rich in the high quality and the wide array of its\nservants, rich above all in the authority of an impossible\nadministrator--a manager personally disinterested, not an actor with an\neye to the main chance; pouring forth a continuity of tradition,\nstriving for perfection, laying a splendid literature under\ncontribution. He saw the heroine of a hundred \"situations,\" variously\ndramatic and vividly real; he saw comedy and drama and passion and\ncharacter and English life; he saw all humanity and history and poetry,\nand then perpetually, in the midst of them, shining out in the high\nrelief of some great moment, an image as fresh as an unveiled statue. He\nwas not unconscious that he was taking all sorts of impossibilities and\nmiracles for granted; but he was under the conviction, for the time,\nthat the woman he had been watching three hours, the incarnation of the\nserious drama, would be a new and vivifying force. The world was just\nthen so bright to him that even Basil Dashwood struck him at first as a\nconceivable agent of his dream.\n\nIt must be added that before Miriam arrived the breeze that filled\nSherringham's sail began to sink a little. He passed out of the\neminently \"let\" drawing-room, where twenty large photographs of the\nyoung actress bloomed in the desert; he went into the garden by a glass\ndoor that stood open, and found Mr. Dashwood lolling on a bench and\nsmoking cigarettes. This young man's conversation was a different\nmusic--it took him down, as he felt; showed him, very sensibly and\nintelligibly, it must be confessed, the actual theatre, the one they\nwere all concerned with, the one they would have to make the miserable\nbest of. It was fortunate that he kept his intoxication mainly to\nhimself: the Englishman's habit of not being effusive still prevailed\nwith him after his years of exposure to the foreign infection. Nothing\ncould have been less exclamatory than the meeting of the two men, with\nits question or two, its remark or two, about the new visitor's arrival\nin London; its off-hand \"I noticed you last night, I was glad you turned\nup at last\" on one side and its attenuated \"Oh yes, it was the first\ntime; I was very much interested\" on the other. Basil Dashwood played a\npart in Yolande and Peter had not failed to take with some comfort the\nmeasure of his aptitude. He judged it to be of the small order, as\nindeed the part, which was neither that of the virtuous nor that of the\nvillainous hero, restricted him to two or three inconspicuous effects\nand three or four changes of dress. He represented an ardent but\nrespectful young lover whom the distracted heroine found time to pity a\nlittle and even to rail at; but it was impressed upon his critic that he\nscarcely represented young love. He looked very well, but Peter had\nheard him already in a hundred contemporary pieces; he never got out of\nrehearsal. He uttered sentiments and breathed vows with a nice voice,\nwith a shy, boyish tremor, but as if he were afraid of being chaffed for\nit afterwards; giving the spectator in the stalls the sense of holding\nthe prompt-book and listening to a recitation. He made one think of\ncountry-houses and lawn-tennis and private theatricals; than which there\ncouldn't be, to Peter's mind, a range of association more disconnected\nfrom the actor's art.\n\nDashwood knew all about the new thing, the piece in rehearsal; he knew\nall about everything--receipts and salaries and expenses and newspaper\narticles, and what old Baskerville said and what Mrs. Ruffler thought:\nmatters of superficial concern to his fellow-guest, who wondered, before\nthey had sight of Miriam, if she talked with her \"walking-gentleman\"\nabout them by the hour, deep in them and finding them not vulgar and\nboring but the natural air of her life and the essence of her\nprofession. Of course she did--she naturally would; it was all in the\nday's work and he might feel sure she wouldn't turn up her nose at the\nshop. He had to remind himself that he didn't care if she didn't, that\nhe would really think worse of her if she should. She certainly was in\ndeep with her bland playmate, talking shop by the hour: he could see\nthis from the fellow's ease of attitude, the air of a man at home and\ndoing the honours. He divined a great intimacy between the two young\nartists, but asked himself at the same time what he, Peter Sherringham,\nhad to say about it. He didn't pretend to control Miriam's intimacies,\nit was to be supposed; and if he had encouraged her to adopt a\nprofession rich in opportunities for comradeship it was not for him to\ncry out because she had taken to it kindly. He had already descried a\nfund of utility in Mrs. Lovick's light brother; but it irritated him,\nall the same, after a while, to hear the youth represent himself as\nalmost indispensable. He was practical--there was no doubt of that; and\nthis idea added to Peter's paradoxical sense that as regards the matters\nactually in question he himself had not this virtue. Dashwood had got\nMrs. Rooth the house; it happened by a lucky chance that Laura Lumley,\nto whom it belonged--Sherringham would know Laura Lumley?--wanted to get\nrid, for a mere song, of the remainder of the lease. She was going to\nAustralia with a troupe of her own. They just stepped into it; it was\ngood air--the best sort of London air to live in, to sleep in, for\npeople of their trade. Peter came back to his wonder at what Miriam's\npersonal relations with this deucedly knowing gentleman might be, and\nwas again able to assure himself that they might be anything in the\nworld she liked, for any stake he, the familiar of the Foreign Office,\nhad in them. Dashwood told him of all the smart people who had tried to\ntake up the new star--the way the London world had already held out its\nhand; and perhaps it was Sherringham's irritation, the crushed sentiment\nI just mentioned, that gave a little heave in the exclamation, \"Oh\nthat--that's all rubbish: the less of that the better!\" At this Mr.\nDashwood sniffed a little, rather resentful; he had expected Peter to be\npleased with the names of the eager ladies who had \"called\"--which\nproved how low a view he took of his art. Our friend explained--it is to\nbe hoped not pedantically--that this art was serious work and that\nsociety was humbug and imbecility; also that of old the great comedians\nwouldn't have known such people. Garrick had essentially his own circle.\n\n\"No, I suppose they didn't 'call' in the old narrow-minded time,\" said\nBasil Dashwood.\n\n\"Your profession didn't call. They had better company--that of the\nromantic gallant characters they represented. They lived with _them_, so\nit was better all round.\" And Peter asked himself--for that clearly\nstruck the young man as a dreary period--if _he_ only, for Miriam, in\nher new life and among the futilities of those who tried to lionise her,\nexpressed the artistic idea. This at least, Sherringham reflected, was\na situation that could be improved.\n\nHe learned from his companion that the new play, the thing they were\nrehearsing, was an old play, a romantic drama of thirty years before,\nvery frequently revived and threadbare with honourable service. Dashwood\nhad a part in it, but there was an act in which he didn't appear, and\nthis was the act they were doing that morning. Yolande had done all\nYolande could do; the visitor was mistaken if he supposed Yolande such a\ntremendous hit. It had done very well, it had run three months, but they\nwere by no means coining money with it. It wouldn't take them to the end\nof the season; they had seen for a month past that they would have to\nput on something else. Miss Rooth, moreover, wanted a new part; she was\nabove all impatient to show her big range. She had grand ideas; she\nthought herself very good-natured to repeat the same stuff for three\nmonths. The young man lighted another cigarette and described to his\nlistener some of Miss Rooth's ideas. He abounded in information about\nher--about her character, her temper, her peculiarities, her little\nways, her manner of producing some of her effects. He spoke with\nfamiliarity and confidence, as if knowing more about her than any one\nelse--as if he had invented or discovered her, were in a sense her\nproprietor or guarantor. It was the talk of the shop, both with a native\nsharpness and a touching young candour; the expansion of the commercial\nspirit when it relaxes and generalises, is conscious of safety with\nanother member of the guild.\n\nPeter at any rate couldn't help protesting against the lame old\nwar-horse it was proposed to bring into action, who had been ridden to\ndeath and had saved a thousand desperate fields; and he exclaimed on\nthe strange passion of the good British public for sitting again and\nagain through expected situations, watching for speeches they had heard\nand surprises that struck the hour. Dashwood defended the taste of\nLondon, praised it as loyal, constant, faithful; to which his\ninterlocutor retorted with some vivacity that it was faithful to sad\ntrash. He justified this sally by declaring the play in rehearsal sad\ntrash, clumsy mediocrity with all its convenience gone, and that the\nfault was the want of life in the critical sense of the public, which\nwas ignobly docile, opening its mouth for its dose like the pupils of\nDotheboys Hall; not insisting on something different, on a fresh brew\naltogether. Dashwood asked him if he then wished their friend to go on\nplaying for ever a part she had repeated more than eighty nights on end:\nhe thought the modern \"run\" was just what he had heard him denounce in\nParis as the disease the theatre was dying of. This imputation Peter\nquite denied, wanting to know if she couldn't change to something less\nstale than the greatest staleness of all. Dashwood opined that Miss\nRooth must have a strong part and that there happened to be one for her\nin the before-mentioned venerable novelty. She had to take what she\ncould get--she wasn't a person to cry for the moon. This was a\nstop-gap--she would try other things later; she would have to look round\nher; you couldn't have a new piece, one that would do, left at your door\nevery day with the milk. On one point Sherringham's mind might be at\nrest: Miss Rooth was a woman who would do every blessed thing there was\nto do. Give her time and she would walk straight through the repertory.\nShe was a woman who would do this--she was a woman who would do that:\nher spokesman employed this phrase so often that Peter, nervous, got up\nand threw an unsmoked cigarette away. Of course she was a woman; there\nwas no need of his saying it a hundred times.\n\nAs for the repertory, the young man went on, the most beautiful girl in\nthe world could give but what she had. He explained, after their visitor\nsat down again, that the noise made by Miss Rooth was not exactly what\nthis admirer appeared to suppose. Sherringham had seen the house the\nnight before and would recognise that, though good, it was very far from\ngreat. She had done very well, it was all right, but she had never gone\nabove a point which Dashwood expressed in pounds sterling, to the\nedification of his companion, who vaguely thought the figure high. Peter\nremembered that he had been unable to get a stall, but Dashwood insisted\nthat \"Miriam\" had not leaped into commanding fame: that was a thing that\nnever happened in fact--it happened only in grotesque works of fiction.\nShe had attracted notice, unusual notice for a woman whose name, the day\nbefore, had never been heard of: she was recognised as having, for a\nnovice, extraordinary cleverness and confidence--in addition to her\nlooks, of course, which were the thing that had really fetched the\ncrowd. But she hadn't been the talk of London; she had only been the\ntalk of Gabriel Nash. He wasn't London, more was the pity. He knew the\nesthetic people--the worldly, semi-smart ones, not the frumpy, sickly\nlot who wore dirty drapery; and the esthetic people had run after her.\nMr. Dashwood sketchily instructed the pilgrim from Paris as to the\ndifferent sects in the great religion of beauty, and was able to give\nhim the particular \"note\" of the critical clique to which Miriam had\nbegun so quickly to owe it that she had a vogue. The information made\nour friend feel very ignorant of the world, very uninitiated and buried\nin his little professional hole. Dashwood warned him that it would be a\nlong time before the general public would wake up to Miss Rooth, even\nafter she had waked up to herself; she would have to do some really big\nthing first. _They_ knew it was in her, the big thing--Peter and he and\neven poor Nash--because they had seen her as no one else had; but London\nnever took any one on trust--it had to be cash down. It would take their\nyoung lady two or three years to pay out her cash and get her\nequivalent. But of course the equivalent would be simply a gold-mine.\nWithin its limits, however, certainly, the mark she had made was already\nquite a fairy-tale: there was magic in the way she had concealed from\nthe first her want of experience. She absolutely made you think she had\na lot of it, more than any one else. Mr. Dashwood repeated several times\nthat she was a cool hand--a deucedly cool hand, and that he watched her\nhimself, saw ideas come to her, saw her have different notions, and more\nor less put them to the test, on different nights. She was always\nalive--she liked it herself. She gave him ideas, long as he had been on\nthe stage. Naturally she had a great deal to learn, no end even of quite\nbasic things; a cosmopolite like Sherringham would understand that a\ngirl of that age, who had never had a friend but her mother--her mother\nwas greater fun than ever now--naturally _would_ have. Sherringham\nwinced at being dubbed a \"cosmopolite\" by his young entertainer, just as\nhe had winced a moment before at hearing himself lumped in esoteric\nknowledge with Dashwood and Gabriel Nash; but the former of these\ngentlemen took no account of his sensibility while he enumerated a few\nof the elements of the \"basic.\" He was a mixture of acuteness and\ninnocent fatuity; and Peter had to recognise in him a rudiment or two of\ncriticism when he said that the wonderful thing in the girl was that she\nlearned so fast--learned something every night, learned from the same\nold piece a lot more than any one else would have learned from twenty.\n\"That's what it is to be a genius,\" Peter concurred. \"Genius is only the\nart of getting your experience fast, of stealing it, as it were; and in\nthis sense Miss Rooth's a regular brigand.\" Dashwood condoned the\nsubtlety and added less analytically, \"Oh she'll do!\" It was exactly in\nthese simple words, addressed to her, that her other admirer had phrased\nthe same truth; yet he didn't enjoy hearing them on his neighbour's\nlips: they had a profane, patronising sound and suggested displeasing\nequalities.\n\nThe two men sat in silence for some minutes, watching a fat robin hop\nabout on the little seedy lawn; at the end of which they heard a vehicle\nstop on the other side of the garden-wall and the voices of occupants\nalighting. \"Here they come, the dear creatures,\" said Basil Dashwood\nwithout moving; and from where they sat Peter saw the small door in the\nwall pushed open. The dear creatures were three in number, for a\ngentleman had added himself to Mrs. Rooth and her daughter. As soon as\nMiriam's eyes took in her Parisian friend she fell into a large, droll,\ntheatrical attitude and, seizing her mother's arm, exclaimed\npassionately: \"Look where he sits, the author of all my woes--cold,\ncynical, cruel!\" She was evidently in the highest spirits; of which Mrs.\nRooth partook as she cried indulgently, giving her a slap, \"Oh get\nalong, you gypsy!\"\n\n\"She's always up to something,\" Dashwood laughed as Miriam, radiant and\nwith a conscious stage tread, glided toward Sherringham as if she were\ncoming to the footlights. He rose slowly from his seat, looking at her\nand struck with her beauty: he had been impatient to see her, yet in the\nact his impatience had had a disconcerting check.\n\nHe had had time to note that the man who had come in with her was\nGabriel Nash, and this recognition brought a low sigh to his lips as he\nheld out his hand to her--a sigh expressive of the sudden sense that his\ninterest in her now could only be a gross community. Of course that\ndidn't matter, since he had set it, at the most, such rigid limits; but\nhe none the less felt vividly reminded that it would be public and\nnotorious, that inferior people would be inveterately mixed up with it,\nthat she had crossed the line and sold herself to the vulgar, making him\nindeed only one of an equalised multitude. The way Nash turned up there\njust when he didn't want to see him proved how complicated a thing it\nwas to have a friendship with a young woman so clearly booked for\nrenown. He quite forgot that the intruder had had this object of\ninterest long before his own first view of it and had been present at\nthat passage, which he had in a measure brought about. Had Sherringham\nnot been so cut out to make trouble of this particular joy he might have\nfound some adequate assurance that their young hostess distinguished him\nin the way in which, taking his hand in both of hers, she looked up at\nhim and murmured, \"Dear old master!\" Then as if this were not\nacknowledgment enough she raised her head still higher and, whimsically,\ngratefully, charmingly, almost nobly, kissed him on the lips before the\nother men, before the good mother whose \"Oh you honest creature!\" made\neverything regular.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nIf he was ruffled by some of her conditions there was thus comfort and\nconsolation to be drawn from others, beside the essential\nfascination--so small the doubt of that now--of the young lady's own\nsociety. He spent the afternoon, they all spent the afternoon, and the\noccasion reminded him of pages in _Wilhelm Meister_. He himself could\npass for Wilhelm, and if Mrs. Rooth had little resemblance to Mignon,\nMiriam was remarkably like Philina. The movable feast awaiting\nthem--luncheon, tea, dinner?--was delayed two or three hours; but the\ninterval was a source of gaiety, for they all smoked cigarettes in the\ngarden and Miriam gave striking illustrations of the parts she was\nstudying. Peter was in the state of a man whose toothache has suddenly\nstopped--he was exhilarated by the cessation of pain. The pain had been\nthe effort to remain in Paris after the creature in the world in whom he\nwas most interested had gone to London, and the balm of seeing her now\nwas the measure of the previous soreness.\n\nGabriel Nash had, as usual, plenty to say, and he talked of Nick's\npicture so long that Peter wondered if he did it on purpose to vex him.\nThey went in and out of the house; they made excursions to see what form\nthe vague meal was taking; and Sherringham got half an hour alone, or\nvirtually alone, with the mistress of his unsanctioned passion--drawing\nher publicly away from the others and making her sit with him in the\nmost sequestered part of the little gravelled grounds. There was summer\nenough for the trees to shut out the adjacent villas, and Basil Dashwood\nand Gabriel Nash lounged together at a convenient distance while Nick's\nwhimsical friend dropped polished pebbles, sometimes audibly splashing,\ninto the deep well of the histrionic simplicity. Miriam confessed that\nlike all comedians they ate at queer hours; she sent Dashwood in for\nbiscuits and sherry--she proposed sending him round to the grocer's in\nthe Circus Road for superior wine. Peter judged him the factotum of the\nlittle household: he knew where the biscuits were kept and the state of\nthe grocer's account. When he himself congratulated her on having so\nuseful an inmate she said genially, but as if the words disposed of him,\n\"Oh he's awfully handy.\" To this she added, \"You're not, you know\";\nresting the kindest, most pitying eyes on him. The sensation they gave\nhim was as sweet as if she had stroked his cheek, and her manner was\nresponsive even to tenderness. She called him \"Dear master\" again and\nagain, and still often \"_Cher ma\u00c3\u00aetre_,\" and appeared to express\ngratitude and reverence by every intonation.\n\n\"You're doing the humble dependent now,\" he said: \"you do it\nbeautifully, as you do everything.\" She replied that she didn't make it\nhumble enough--she couldn't; she was too proud, too insolent in her\ntriumph. She liked that, the triumph, too much, and she didn't mind\ntelling him she was perfectly happy. Of course as yet the triumph was\nvery limited; but success was success, whatever its quantity; the dish\nwas a small one but had the right taste. Her imagination had already\nbounded beyond the first phase unexpectedly great as this had been: her\nposition struck her as modest compared with the probably future now\nvivid to her. Peter had never seen her so soft and sympathetic; she had\ninsisted in Paris that her personal character was that of the good\ngirl--she used the term in a fine loose way--and it was impossible to be\na better girl than she showed herself this pleasant afternoon. She was\nfull of gossip and anecdote and drollery; she had exactly the air he\nwould have wished her to have--that of thinking of no end of things to\ntell him. It was as if she had just returned from a long journey and had\nhad strange adventures and made wonderful discoveries. She began to\nspeak of this and that, then broke off to speak of something else; she\ntalked of the theatre, of the \"critics,\" and above all of London, of the\npeople she had met and the extraordinary things they said to her, of the\nparts she was going to take up, of lots of new ideas that had come to\nher about the art of comedy. She wanted to do comedy now--to do the\ncomedy of London life. She was delighted to find that seeing more of the\nworld suggested things to her; they came straight from the fact, from\nnature, if you could call it nature; she was thus convinced more than\never that the artist ought to _live_ so as to get on with his business,\ngathering ideas and lights from experience--ought to welcome any\nexperience that would give him lights. But work of course _was_\nexperience, and everything in one's life that was good was work. That\nwas the jolly thing in the actor's trade--it made up for other elements\nthat were odious: if you only kept your eyes open nothing could happen\nto you that wouldn't be food for observation and grist to your mill,\nshowing you how people looked and moved and spoke, cried and grimaced,\nwrithed and dissimulated, in given situations. She saw all round her\nthings she wanted to \"do\"--London bristled with them if you had eyes to\nsee. She was fierce to know why people didn't take them up, put them\ninto plays and parts, give one a chance with them; she expressed her\nsharp impatience of the general literary _b\u00c3\u00a9tise_. She had never been\nchary of this particular displeasure, and there were moments--it was an\nold story and a subject of frank raillery to Sherringham--when to hear\nher you might have thought there was no cleverness anywhere but in her\nown splendid impatience. She wanted tremendous things done that she\nmight use them, but she didn't pretend to say exactly what they were to\nbe, nor even approximately how they were to be handled: her ground was\nrather that if _she_ only had a pen--it was exasperating to have to\nexplain! She mainly contented herself with the view that nothing had\nreally been touched: she felt that more and more as she saw more of\npeople's goings-on.\n\nPeter went to her theatre again that evening and indeed made no scruple\nof going every night for a week. Rather perhaps I should say he made a\nscruple, but a high part of the pleasure of his life during these\narbitrary days was to overcome it. The only way to prove he could\novercome it was to go; and he was satisfied, after he had been seven\ntimes, not only with the spectacle on the stage but with his perfect\nindependence. He knew no satiety, however, with the spectacle on the\nstage, which induced for him but a further curiosity. Miriam's\nperformance was a thing alive, with a power to change, to grow, to\ndevelop, to beget new forms of the same life. Peter contributed to it in\nhis amateurish way and watched with solicitude the effect of his care\nand the fortune of his hints. He talked it over in Balaklava Place,\nsuggested modifications and variations worth trying. She professed\nherself thankful for any refreshment that could be administered to her\ninterest in _Yolande_, and with an energy that showed large resource\ntouched up her part and drew several new airs from it. Peter's\nliberties bore on her way of uttering certain speeches, the intonations\nthat would have more beauty or make the words mean more. She had her\nideas, or rather she had her instincts, which she defended and\nillustrated, with a vividness superior to argument, by a happy pictorial\nphrase or a snatch of mimicry; but she was always for trying; she liked\nexperiments and caught at them, and she was especially thankful when\nsome one gave her a showy reason, a plausible formula, in a case where\nshe only stood on an intuition. She pretended to despise reasons and to\nlike and dislike at her sovereign pleasure; but she always honoured the\nexotic gift, so that Sherringham was amused with the liberal way she\nproduced it, as if she had been a naked islander rejoicing in a present\nof crimson cloth.\n\nDay after day he spent most of his time in her society, and Miss Laura\nLumley's recent habitation became the place in London to which his\nthoughts and his steps were most attached. He was highly conscious of\nhis not now carrying out that principle of abstention he had brought to\nsuch maturity before leaving Paris; but he contented himself with a much\ncruder justification of this lapse than he would have thought adequate\nin advance. It consisted simply in the idea that to be identified with\nthe first fresh exploits of a young genius was a delightful experience.\nWhat was the harm of it when the genius was real? His main security was\nthus that his relations with Miriam had been placed under the protection\nof that idea of approved extravagance. In this department they made a\nvery creditable figure and required much less watching and pruning than\nwhen it had been his effort to adjust them to a worldly plan. He had in\nfine a sense of real wisdom when he pronounced it surely enough that\nthis momentary intellectual participation in the girl's dawning fame was\na charming thing. Charming things were not frequent enough in a busy\nman's life to be kicked out of the way. Balaklava Place, looked at in\nthis philosophic way, became almost idyllic: it gave Peter the\npleasantest impression he had ever had of London.\n\nThe season happened to be remarkably fine; the temperature was high, but\nnot so high as to keep people from the theatre. Miriam's \"business\"\nvisibly increased, so that the question of putting on the second play\nunderwent some revision. The girl persisted, showing in her persistence\na temper of which Peter had already caught some sharp gleams. It was\nplain that through her career she would expect to carry things with a\nhigh hand. Her managers and agents wouldn't find her an easy victim or a\ncalculable force; but the public would adore her, surround her with the\npopularity that attaches to a good-natured and free-spoken princess, and\nher comrades would have a kindness for her because she wouldn't be\nselfish. They too would, besides representing her body-guard, form in a\nmanner a portion of her affectionate public. This was the way her friend\nread the signs, liking her whimsical tolerance of some of her vulgar\nplayfellows almost well enough to forgive their presence in Balaklava\nPlace, where they were a sore trial to her mother, who wanted her to\nmultiply her points of contact only with the higher orders. There were\nhours when Peter seemed to make out that her principal relation to the\nproper world would be to have within two or three years a grand battle\nwith it resulting in its taking her, should she let it have her at all,\nabsolutely on her own terms: a picture which led our young man to ask\nhimself with a helplessness that was not exempt, as he perfectly knew,\nfrom absurdity, what part _he_ should find himself playing in such a\ncontest and if it would be reserved to him to be the more ridiculous as\na peacemaker or as a heavy backer.\n\n\"She might know any one she would, and the only person she appears to\ntake any pleasure in is that dreadful Miss Rover,\" Mrs. Rooth whimpered\nto him more than once--leading him thus to recognise in the young lady\nso designated the principal complication of Balaklava Place. Miss Rover\nwas a little actress who played at Miriam's theatre, combining with an\nunusual aptitude for delicate comedy a less exceptional absence of\nrigour in private life. She was pretty and quick and brave, and had a\nfineness that Miriam professed herself already in a position to estimate\nas rare. She had no control of her inclinations, yet sometimes they were\nwholly laudable, like the devotion she had formed for her beautiful\ncolleague, whom she admired not only as an ornament of the profession\nbut as a being altogether of a more fortunate essence. She had had an\nidea that real ladies were \"nasty,\" but Miriam was not nasty, and who\ncould gainsay that Miriam was a real lady? The girl justified herself to\nher patron from Paris, who had found no fault with her; she knew how\nmuch her mother feared the proper world wouldn't come in if they knew\nthat the improper, in the person of pretty Miss Rover, was on the\nground. What did she care who came and who didn't, and what was to be\ngained by receiving half the snobs in London? People would have to take\nher exactly as they found her--that they would have to learn; and they\nwould be much mistaken if they thought her capable of turning snob too\nfor the sake of their sweet company. She didn't pretend to be anything\nbut what she meant to be, the best general actress of her time; and what\nhad that to do with her seeing or not seeing a poor ignorant girl who\nhad loved--well, she needn't say what Fanny had done. They had met in\nthe way of business; she didn't say she would have run after her. She\nhad liked her because she wasn't a slick, and when Fanny Rover had asked\nher quite wistfully if she mightn't come and see her and like her she\nhadn't bristled with scandalised virtue. Miss Rover wasn't a bit more\nstupid or more ill-natured than any one else; it would be time enough to\nshut the door when she should become so.\n\nPeter commended even to extravagance the liberality of such comradeship;\nsaid that of course a woman didn't go into that profession to see how\nlittle she could swallow. She was right to live with the others so long\nas they were at all possible, and it was for her and only for her to\njudge how long that might be. This was rather heroic on his part, for\nhis assumed detachment from the girl's personal life still left him a\nmargin for some forms of uneasiness. It would have made in his spirit a\ngreat difference for the worse that the woman he loved, and for whom he\nwished no baser lover than himself, should have embraced the prospect of\nconsorting only with the cheaper kind. It was all very well, but Fanny\nRover was simply a rank _cabotine_, and that sort of association was an\nodd training for a young woman who was to have been good enough--he\ncouldn't forget that, but kept remembering it as if it might still have\na future use--to be his admired wife. Certainly he ought to have thought\nof such things before he permitted himself to become so interested in a\ntheatrical nature. His heroism did him service, however, for the hour;\nit helped him by the end of the week to feel quite broken in to Miriam's\nlittle circle. What helped him most indeed was to reflect that she would\nget tired of a good many of its members herself in time; for if it was\nnot that they were shocking--very few of them shone with that intense\nlight--they could yet be thoroughly trusted in the long run to bore\nyou.\n\nThere was a lovely Sunday in particular, spent by him almost all in\nBalaklava Place--he arrived so early--when, in the afternoon, every sort\nof odd person dropped in. Miriam held a reception in the little garden\nand insisted on all the company's staying to supper. Her mother shed\ntears to Peter, in the desecrated house, because they had accepted,\nMiriam and she, an invitation--and in Cromwell Road too--for the\nevening. Miriam had now decreed they shouldn't go--they would have so\nmuch better fun with their good friends at home. She was sending off a\nmessage--it was a terrible distance--by a cabman, and Peter had the\nprivilege of paying the messenger. Basil Dashwood, in another vehicle,\nproceeded to an hotel known to him, a mile away, for supplementary\nprovisions, and came back with a cold ham and a dozen of champagne. It\nwas all very Bohemian and dishevelled and delightful, very supposedly\ndroll and enviable to outsiders; and Miriam told anecdotes and gave\nimitations of the people she would have met if she had gone out, so that\nno one had a sense of loss--the two occasions were fantastically united.\nMrs. Rooth drank champagne for consolation, though the consolation was\nimperfect when she remembered she might have drunk it, though not quite\nso much perhaps, in Cromwell Road.\n\nTaken in connection with the evening before, the day formed for our\nfriend the most complete exhibition of his young woman he had yet\nenjoyed. He had been at the theatre, to which the Saturday night\nhappened to have brought the very fullest house she had played to, and\nhe came early to Balaklava Place, to tell her once again--he had told\nher half-a-dozen times the evening before--that with the excitement of\nher biggest audience she had surpassed herself, acted with remarkable\nintensity. It pleased her to hear this, and the spirit with which she\ninterpreted the signs of the future and, during an hour he spent alone\nwith her, Mrs. Rooth being upstairs and Basil Dashwood luckily absent,\ntreated him to twenty specimens of feigned passion and character, was\nbeyond any natural abundance he had yet seen in a woman. The impression\ncould scarcely have been other if she had been playing wild snatches to\nhim at the piano: the bright up-darting flame of her talk rose and fell\nlike an improvisation on the keys. Later, the rest of the day, he could\nas little miss the good grace with which she fraternised with her\nvisitors, finding always the fair word for each--the key to a common\nease, the right turn to keep vanity quiet and make humility brave. It\nwas a wonderful expenditure of generous, nervous life. But what he read\nin it above all was the sense of success in youth, with the future loose\nand big, and the action of that charm on the faculties. Miriam's limited\npast had yet pinched her enough to make emancipation sweet, and the\nemancipation had come at last in an hour. She had stepped into her magic\nshoes, divined and appropriated everything they could help her to,\nbecome in a day a really original contemporary. He was of course not\nless conscious of that than Nick Dormer had been when in the cold light\nof his studio this more detached observer saw too how she had altered.\n\nBut the great thing to his mind, and during these first days the\nirresistible seduction of the theatre, was that she was a rare\nrevelation of beauty. Beauty was the principle of everything she did and\nof the way she unerringly did it--an exquisite harmony of line and\nmotion and attitude and tone, what was at once most general and most\nspecial in her performance. Accidents and instincts played together to\nthis end and constituted something that was independent of her talent\nor of her merit in a given case, and which as a value to Peter's\nimagination was far superior to any merit and any talent. He could but\ncall it a felicity and an importance incalculable, and but know that it\nconnected itself with universal values. To see this force in operation,\nto sit within its radius and feel it shift and revolve and change and\nnever fail, was a corrective to the depression, the humiliation, the\nbewilderment of life. It transported our troubled friend from the vulgar\nhour and the ugly fact; drew him to something that had no warrant but\nits sweetness, no name nor place save as the pure, the remote, the\nantique. It was what most made him say to himself \"Oh hang it, what does\nit matter?\" when he reflected that an _homme s\u00c3\u00a9rieux_, as they said in\nParis, rather gave himself away, as they said in America, by going every\nnight to the same sordid stall at which all the world might stare. It\nwas what kept him from doing anything but hover round Miriam--kept him\nfrom paying any other visits, from attending to any business, from going\nback to Calcutta Gardens. It was a spell he shrank intensely from\nbreaking and the cause of a hundred postponements, confusions, and\nabsurdities. It put him in a false position altogether, but it made of\nthe crooked little stucco villa in Saint John's Wood a place in the\nupper air, commanding the prospect; a nest of winged liberties and\nironies far aloft above the huddled town. One should live at altitudes\nwhen one could--they braced and simplified; and for a happy interval he\nnever touched the earth.\n\nIt was not that there were no influences tending at moments to drag him\ndown--an abasement from which he escaped only because he was up so high.\nWe have seen that Basil Dashwood could affect him at times as a chunk of\nwood tied to his ankle--this through the circumstance that he made\nMiriam's famous conditions, those of the public exhibition of her\ngenius, seem small and prosaic; so that Peter had to remind himself how\nmuch this smallness was perhaps involved in their being at all. She\ncarried his imagination off into infinite spaces, whereas she carried\nDashwood's only into the box-office and the revival of plays that were\nbarbarously bad. The worst was its being so open to him to see that a\nsharp young man really in the business might know better than he.\nAnother vessel of superior knowledge--he talked, that is, as if he knew\nbetter than any one--was Gabriel Nash, who lacked no leisure for\nhatefully haunting Balaklava Place, or in other words appeared to enjoy\nthe same command of his time as Peter Sherringham. The pilgrim from\nParis regarded him with mingled feelings, for he had not forgotten the\ncontentious character of their first meeting or the degree to which he\nhad been moved to urge upon Nick Dormer's consideration that his\ntalkative friend was probably one of the most eminent of asses. This\npersonage turned up now as an admirer of the charming creature he had\nscoffed at, and there was much to exasperate in the smooth gloss of his\ninconsistency, at which he never cast an embarrassed glance. He\npractised indeed such loose license of regard to every question that it\nwas difficult, in vulgar parlance, to \"have\" him; his sympathies hummed\nabout like bees in a garden, with no visible plan, no economy in their\nflight. He thought meanly of the modern theatre and yet had discovered a\nfund of satisfaction in the most promising of its exponents; and Peter\ncould more than once but say to him that he should really, to keep his\nopinions at all in hand, attach more value to the stage or less to the\ninteresting a tress. Miriam took her perfect ease at his expense and\ntreated him as the most abject of her slaves: all of which was worth\nseeing as an exhibition, on Nash's part, of the beautifully\nimperturbable. When Peter all too grossly pronounced him \"damned\"\nimpudent he always felt guilty later on of an injustice--Nash had so\nlittle the air of a man with something to gain. He was aware\nnevertheless of a certain itching in his boot-toe when his\nfellow-visitor brought out, and for the most part to Miriam herself, in\nanswer to any charge of tergiversation, \"Oh it's all right; it's the\nvoice, you know--the enchanting voice!\" Nash meant by this, as indeed he\nmore fully set forth, that he came to the theatre or to the villa simply\nto treat his ear to the sound--the richest then to be heard on earth, as\nhe maintained--issuing from Miriam's lips. Its richness was quite\nindependent of the words she might pronounce or the poor fable they\nmight subserve, and if the pleasure of hearing her in public was the\ngreater by reason of the larger volume of her utterance it was still\nhighly agreeable to see her at home, for it was there the strictly\nmimetic gift he freely conceded to her came out most. He spoke as if she\nhad been formed by the bounty of nature to be his particular recreation,\nand as if, being an expert in innocent joys, he took his pleasure\nwherever he found it.\n\nHe was perpetually in the field, sociable, amiable, communicative,\ninveterately contradicted but never confounded, ready to talk to any one\nabout anything and making disagreement--of which he left the\nresponsibility wholly to others--a basis of harmony. Every one knew what\nhe thought of the theatrical profession, and yet who could say he didn't\nregard, its members as embodiments of comedy when he touched with such a\nhand the spring of their foibles?--touched it with an art that made even\nPeter laugh, notwithstanding his attitude of reserve where this\ninterloper was concerned. At any rate, though he had committed himself\nas to their general fatuity he put up with their company, for the sake\nof Miriam's vocal vibrations, with a practical philosophy that was all\nhis own. And she frankly took him for her supreme, her incorrigible\nadorer, masquerading as a critic to save his vanity and tolerated for\nhis secret constancy in spite of being a bore. He was meanwhile really\nnot a bore to Peter, who failed of the luxury of being able to regard\nhim as one. He had seen too many strange countries and curious things,\nobserved and explored too much, to be void of illustration. Peter had a\nsense that if he himself was in the _grandes espaces_ Gabriel had\nprobably, as a finer critic, a still wider range. If among Miriam's\nassociates Mr. Dashwood dragged him down, the other main sharer of his\nprivilege challenged him rather to higher and more fantastic flights. If\nhe saw the girl in larger relations than the young actor, who mainly saw\nher in ill-written parts, Nash went a step further and regarded her,\nirresponsibly and sublimely, as a priestess of harmony, a figure with\nwhich the vulgar ideas of success and failure had nothing to do. He\nlaughed at her \"parts,\" holding that without them she would still be\ngreat. Peter envied him his power to content himself with the pleasures\nhe could get; Peter had a shrewd impression that contentment wouldn't be\nthe final sweetener of his own repast.\n\nAbove all Nash held his attention by a constant element of easy\nreference to Nick Dormer, who, as we know, had suddenly become much more\ninteresting to his kinsman. Peter found food for observation, and in\nsome measure for perplexity, in the relations of all these clever people\nwith each other. He knew why his sister, who had a personal impatience\nof unapplied ideas, had not been agreeably affected by Miriam's prime\npatron and had not felt happy about the attribution of value to \"such\npeople\" by the man she was to marry. This was a side on which he had no\ndesire to resemble Julia, for he needed no teaching to divine that Nash\nmust have found her accessible to no light--none even about himself. He,\nPeter, would have been sorry to have to confess he couldn't more or less\nunderstand him. He understood furthermore that Miriam, in Nick's studio,\nmight very well have appeared to Julia a formidable force. She was\nyounger and would have \"seen nothing,\" but she had quite as much her own\nresources and was beautiful enough to have made Nick compare her with\nthe lady of Harsh even if he had been in love with that benefactress--a\npretension as to which her brother, as we know, entertained doubts.\n\nPeter at all events saw for many days nothing of his cousin, though it\nmight have been said that Nick participated by implication at least in\nthe life of Balaklava Place. Had he given Julia tangible grounds and was\nhis unexpectedly fine rendering of Miriam an act of virtual infidelity?\nIn that case to what degree was the girl to be regarded as an accomplice\nin his defection, and what was the real nature of Miriam's esteem for\nher new and (as he might be called) distinguished ally? These questions\nwould have given Peter still more to think about had he not flattered\nhimself he had made up his mind that they concerned Nick and his sitter\nherself infinitely more than they concerned any one else. That young\nlady meanwhile was personally before him, so that he had no need to\nconsult for his pleasure his fresh recollection of the portrait. But he\nthought of this striking production each time he thought of his so\ngood-looking kinsman's variety of range. And that happened often, for in\nhis hearing Miriam often discussed the happy artist and his\npossibilities with Gabriel Nash, and Nash broke out about them to all\nwho might hear. Her own tone on the subject was uniform: she kept it on\nrecord to a degree slightly irritating that Mr. Dormer had been\nunforgettably--Peter particularly noted \"unforgettably\"--kind to her.\nShe never mentioned Julia's irruption to Julia's brother; she only\nreferred to the portrait, with inscrutable amenity, as a direct\nconsequence of this gentleman's fortunate suggestion that first day at\nMadame Carr\u00c3\u00a9's. Nash showed, however, such a disposition to dwell\nsociably and luminously on the peculiarly interesting character of what\nhe called Dormer's predicament and on the fine suspense it was fitted to\nkindle in the breast of the truly discerning, that Peter wondered, as I\nhave already hinted, if this insistence were not a subtle perversity, a\ndevilish little invention to torment a man whose jealousy was\npresumable. Yet his fellow-pilgrim struck him as on the whole but\nscantly devilish and as still less occupied with the prefigurement of so\nplain a man's emotions. Indeed he threw a glamour of romance over Nick;\ntossed off toward him such illuminating yet mystifying references that\nthey operated quite as a bait to curiosity, invested with amusement the\nview of the possible, any wish to follow out the chain of events. He\nlearned from Gabriel that Nick was still away, and he then felt he could\nalmost submit to instruction, to initiation. The loose charm of these\ndays was troubled, however--it ceased to be idyllic--when late on the\nevening of the second Sunday he walked away with Nash southward from\nSaint John's Wood. For then something came out.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIX\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nIt mattered not so much what the doctors thought--and Sir Matthew Hope,\nthe greatest of them all, had been down twice in one week--as that Mr.\nChayter, the omniscient butler, declared with all the authority of his\nposition and his experience that Mr. Carteret was very bad indeed. Nick\nDormer had a long talk with him--it lasted six minutes--the day he\nhurried to Beauclere in response to a telegram. It was Mr. Chayter who\nhad taken upon himself to telegraph in spite of the presence in the\nhouse of Mr. Carteret's nearest relation and only surviving sister, Mrs.\nLendon. This lady, a large, mild, healthy woman with a heavy tread, a\nperson who preferred early breakfasts, uncomfortable chairs and the\nadvertisement-sheet of the _Times_, had arrived the week before and was\nawaiting the turn of events. She was a widow and occupied in Cornwall a\nhouse nine miles from a station, which had, to make up for this\ninconvenience as she had once told Nick, a fine old herbaceous garden.\nShe was extremely fond of an herbaceous garden--her main consciousness\nwas of herbaceous possibilities. Nick had often seen her--she had always\ncome to Beauclere once or twice a year. Her sojourn there made no great\ndifference; she was only an \"Urania dear\" for Mr. Carteret to look\nacross the table at when, on the close of dinner, it was time for her to\nretire. She went out of the room always as if it were after some one\nelse; and on the gentlemen's \"joining\" her later--the junction was not\nvery close--she received them with an air of gratified surprise.\n\nChayter honoured Nick with a regard which approached, though not\nimproperly competing with it, the affection his master had placed on the\nsame young head, and Chayter knew a good many things. Among them he knew\nhis place; but it was wonderful how little that knowledge had rendered\nhim inaccessible to other kinds. He took upon himself to send for Nick\nwithout speaking to Mrs. Lendon, whose influence was now a good deal\nlike that of some large occasional piece of furniture introduced on a\ncontingency. She was one of the solid conveniences that a comfortable\nhouse would have, but you couldn't talk with a mahogany sofa or a\nfolding screen. Chayter knew how much she had \"had\" from her brother,\nand how much her two daughters had each received on marriage; and he was\nof the opinion that it was quite enough, especially considering the\nsociety in which they--you could scarcely call it--moved. He knew beyond\nthis that they would all have more, and that was why he hesitated little\nabout communicating with Nick. If Mrs. Lendon should be ruffled at the\nintrusion of a young man who neither was the child of a cousin nor had\nbeen formally adopted, Chayter was parliamentary enough to see that the\nforms of debate were observed. He had indeed a slightly compassionate\nsense that Mrs. Lendon was not easily ruffled. She was always down an\nextraordinary time before breakfast--Chayter refused to take it as in\nthe least admonitory--but usually went straight into the garden as if to\nsee that none of the plants had been stolen in the night, and had in the\nend to be looked for by the footman in some out-of-the-way spot behind\nthe shrubbery, where, plumped upon the ground, she was mostly doing\nsomething \"rum\" to a flower.\n\nMr. Carteret himself had expressed no wishes. He slept most of the\ntime--his failure at the last had been sudden, but he was rheumatic and\nseventy-seven--and the situation was in Chayter's hands. Sir Matthew\nHope had opined even on a second visit that he would rally and go on, in\nrudimentary comfort, some time longer; but Chayter took a different and\na still more intimate view. Nick was embarrassed: he scarcely knew what\nhe was there for from the moment he could give his good old friend no\nconscious satisfaction. The doctors, the nurses, the servants, Mrs.\nLendon, and above all the settled equilibrium of the square thick house,\nwhere an immutable order appeared to slant through the polished windows\nand tinkle in the quieter bells, all these things represented best the\nkind of supreme solace to which the master was most accessible.\n\nIt was judged best that for the first day Nick should not be introduced\ninto the darkened room. This was the decision of the two decorous\nnurses, of whom the visitor had had a glimpse and who, with their black\nuniforms and fresh faces of business, suggested the barmaid emulating\nthe nun. He was depressed and restless, felt himself in a false\nposition, and thought it lucky Mrs. Lendon had powers of placid\nacceptance. They were old acquaintances: she treated him formally,\nanxiously, but it was not the rigour of mistrust. It was much more an\nexpression of remote Cornish respect for young abilities and\ndistinguished connexions, inasmuch as she asked him rather yearningly\nabout Lady Agnes and about Lady Flora and Lady Elizabeth. He knew she\nwas kind and ungrudging, and his main regret was for his meagre\nknowledge and poor responses in regard to his large blank aunts. He sat\nin the garden with newspapers and looked at the lowered blinds in Mr.\nCarteret's windows; he wandered round the abbey with cigarettes and\nlightened his tread and felt grave, wishing everything might be over. He\nwould have liked much to see Mr. Carteret again, but had no desire that\nMr. Carteret should see him. In the evening he dined with Mrs. Lendon,\nand she talked to him at his request and as much as she could about her\nbrother's early years, his beginnings of life. She was so much younger\nthat they appeared to have been rather a tradition of her own youth; but\nher talk made Nick feel how tremendously different Mr. Carteret had been\nat that period from what he, Nick, was to-day. He had published at the\nage of thirty a little volume, thought at the time wonderfully clever,\ncalled _The Incidence of Rates_; but Nick had not yet collected the\nmaterial for any such treatise. After dinner Mrs. Lendon, who was in\nmerciless full dress, retired to the drawing-room, where at the end of\nten minutes she was followed by Nick, who had remained behind only\nbecause he thought Chayter would expect it. Mrs. Lendon almost shook\nhands with him again and then Chayter brought in coffee. Almost in no\ntime afterwards he brought in tea, and the occupants of the drawing-room\nsat for a slow half-hour, during which the lady looked round at the\napartment with a sigh and said: \"Don't you think poor Charles had\nexquisite taste?\"\n\nFortunately the \"local man\" was at this moment ushered in. He had been\nupstairs and he smiled himself in with the remark: \"It's quite\nwonderful, quite wonderful.\" What was wonderful was a marked improvement\nin the breathing, a distinct indication of revival. The doctor had some\ntea and chatted for a quarter of an hour in a way that showed what a\n\"good\" manner and how large an experience a local man could have. When\nhe retired Nick walked out with him. The doctor's house was near by and\nhe had come on foot. He left the visitor with the assurance that in all\nprobability Mr. Carteret, who was certainly picking up, would be able to\nsee him on the morrow. Our young man turned his steps again to the abbey\nand took a stroll about it in the starlight. It never looked so huge as\nwhen it reared itself into the night, and Nick had never felt more fond\nof it than on this occasion, more comforted and confirmed by its beauty.\nWhen he came back he was readmitted by Chayter, who surveyed him in\nrespectful deprecation of the frivolity which had led him to attempt to\nhelp himself through such an evening in such a way.\n\nHe went to bed early and slept badly, which was unusual with him; but it\nwas a pleasure to him to be told almost as soon as he appeared that Mr.\nCarteret had asked for him. He went in to see him and was struck with\nthe change in his appearance. He had, however, spent a day with him just\nafter the New Year and another at the beginning of March, and had then\nnoted in him the menace of the final weakness. A week after Julia\nDallow's departure for the Continent he had again devoted several hours\nto the place and to the intention of telling his old friend how the\nhappy event had been brought to naught--the advantage he had been so\ngood as to desire for him and to make the condition of a splendid gift.\nBefore this, for a few days, he had been keeping back, to announce it\npersonally, the good news that Julia had at last set their situation in\norder: he wanted to enjoy the old man's pleasure--so sore a trial had\nher arbitrary behaviour been for a year. If she had offered Mr. Carteret\na conciliatory visit before Christmas, had come down from London one day\nto lunch with him, this had but contributed to make him subsequently\nexhibit to poor Nick, as the victim of her elegant perversity, a great\ndeal of earnest commiseration in a jocose form. Upon his honour, as he\nsaid, she was as clever and \"specious\" a woman--this was his odd\nexpression--as he had ever seen in his life. The merit of her behaviour\non that occasion, as Nick knew, was that she had not been specious at\nher lover's expense: she had breathed no doubt of his public purpose and\nhad had the strange grace to say that in truth she was older than he, so\nthat it was only fair to give his affections time to mature. But when\nNick saw their hopeful host after the rupture at which we have been\npresent he found him in no state to deal with worries: he was seriously\nailing, it was the beginning of worse things and not a time to put his\nattention to the stretch. After this excursion Nick had gone back to\ntown saddened by his patient's now unmistakably settled decline, but\nrather relieved that he had had himself to make no confession. It had\neven occurred to him that the need for making one at all might never\ncome up. Certainly it wouldn't if the ebb of Mr. Carteret's strength\nshould continue unchecked. He might pass away in the persuasion that\neverything would happen as he wished it, though indeed without enriching\nNick on his wedding-day to the tune he had promised. Very likely he had\nmade legal arrangements in virtue of which his bounty would take effect\nin case of the right event and in that case alone. At present Nick had a\nbigger, an uglier truth to tell--the last three days had made the\ndifference; but, oddly enough, though his responsibility had increased\nhis reluctance to speak had vanished: he was positively eager to clear\nup a situation over which it was not consistent with his honour to leave\na shade.\n\nThe doctor had been right on coming in after dinner; it was clear in\nthe morning that they had not seen the last of Mr. Carteret's power of\npicking up. Chayter, who had waited on him, refused austerely to change\nhis opinion with every change in his master's temperature; but the\nnurses took the cheering view that it would do their charge good for Mr.\nDormer to sit with him a little. One of them remained in the room in the\ndeep window-seat, and Nick spent twenty minutes by the bedside. It was\nnot a case for much conversation, but his helpless host seemed still to\nlike to look at him. There was life in his kind old eyes, a stir of\nsomething that would express itself yet in some further wise provision.\nHe laid his liberal hand on Nick's with a confidence that showed how\nlittle it was really disabled. He said very little, and the nurse had\nrecommended that the visitor himself should not overflow in speech; but\nfrom time to time he murmured with a faint smile: \"To-night's division,\nyou know--you mustn't miss it.\" There was probably to be no division\nthat night, as happened, but even Mr. Carteret's aberrations were\nparliamentary. Before Nick withdrew he had been able to assure him he\nwas rapidly getting better and that such valuable hours, the young man's\nown, mustn't be wasted. \"Come back on Friday if they come to the second\nreading.\" These were the words with which Nick was dismissed, and at\nnoon the doctor said the invalid was doing very well, but that Nick had\nbetter leave him quiet for that day. Our young man accordingly\ndetermined to go up to town for the night, and even, should he receive\nno summons, for the next day. He arranged with Chayter that he should be\ntelegraphed to if Mr. Carteret were either better or worse.\n\n\"Oh he can't very well be worse, sir,\" Chayter replied inexorably; but\nhe relaxed so far as to remark that of course it wouldn't do for Nick\nto neglect the House.\n\n\"Oh the House!\"--Nick was ambiguous and avoided the butler's eye. It\nwould be easy enough to tell Mr. Carteret, but nothing would have\nsustained him in the effort to make a clean breast to Chayter.\n\nHe might equivocate about the House, but he had the sense of things to\nbe done awaiting him in London. He telegraphed to his servant and spent\nthat night in Rosedale Road. The things to be done were apparently to be\ndone in his studio: his servant met him there with a large bundle of\nletters. He failed that evening to stray within two miles of\nWestminster, and the legislature of his country reassembled without his\nsupport. The next morning he received a telegram from Chayter, to whom\nhe had given Rosedale Road as an address. This missive simply informed\nhim that Mr. Carteret wished to see him; it seemed a sign that he was\nbetter, though Chayter wouldn't say so. Nick again accordingly took his\nplace in the train to Beauclere. He had been there very often, but it\nwas present to him that now, after a little, he should go only once\nmore--for a particular dismal occasion. All that was over, everything\nthat belonged to it was over. He learned on his arrival--he saw Mrs.\nLendon immediately--that his old friend had continued to pick up. He had\nexpressed a strong and a perfectly rational desire to talk with his\nexpected visitor, and the doctor had said that if it was about anything\nimportant they should forbear to oppose him. \"He says it's about\nsomething very important,\" Mrs. Lendon remarked, resting shy eyes on him\nwhile she added that she herself was now sitting with her dear brother.\nShe had sent those wonderful young ladies out to see the abbey. Nick\npaused with her outside Mr. Carteret's door. He wanted to say something\nrather intimate and all soothing to her in return for her homely\ncharity--give her a hint, for which she was far from looking, that\npractically he had now no interest in her brother's estate. This was of\ncourse impossible; her lack of irony, of play of mind, gave him no\npretext, and such a reference would be an insult to her simple\ndiscretion. She was either not thinking of his interest at all, or was\nthinking of it with the tolerance of a nature trained to a hundred\ndecent submissions. Nick looked a little into her mild, uninvestigating\neyes, and it came over him supremely that the goodness of these people\nwas singularly pure: they were a part of what was cleanest and sanest\nand dullest in humanity. There had been just a little mocking inflexion\nin Mrs. Lendon's pleasant voice; but it was dedicated to the young\nladies in the black uniforms--she could perhaps be humorous about\n_them_--and not to the theory of the \"importance\" of Nick's interview\nwith her brother. His arrested desire to let her know he was not greedy\ntranslated itself into a vague friendliness and into the abrupt, rather\nbewildering words: \"I can't tell you half the good I think of you.\" As\nhe passed into Mr. Carteret's room it occurred to him that she would\nperhaps interpret this speech as an acknowledgment of obligation--of her\ngood nature in not keeping him away from the rich old man.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nThe rich old man was propped up on pillows, and in this attitude,\nbeneath the high, spare canopy of his bed, presented himself to Nick's\npicture-seeking vision as a figure in a clever composition or a \"story.\"\nHe had gathered strength, though this strength was not much in his\nvoice; it was mainly in his brighter eyes and his air of being pleased\nwith himself. He put out his hand and said, \"I daresay you know why I\nsent for you\"; on which Nick sank into the seat he had occupied the day\nbefore, replying that he had been delighted to come, whatever the\nreason. Mr. Carteret said nothing more about the division or the second\nreading; he only murmured that they were keeping the newspapers for him.\n\"I'm rather behind--I'm rather behind,\" he went on; \"but two or three\nquiet mornings will make it all right. You can go back to-night, you\nknow--you can easily go back.\" This was the only thing not quite\nstraight that Nick found in him--his making light of his young friend's\nflying to and fro. The young friend sat looking at him with a sense that\nwas half compunction and half the idea of the rare beauty of his face,\nto which, strangely, the waste of illness now seemed to have restored\nsomething of its youth. Mr. Carteret was evidently conscious that this\nmorning he shouldn't be able to go on long, so that he must be\npractical and concise. \"I daresay you know--you've only to remember,\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"I needn't tell you what a pleasure it is to me to see you--there can be\nno better reason than that,\" was what Nick could say.\n\n\"Hasn't the year come round--the year of that foolish arrangement?\"\n\nNick thought a little, asking himself if it were really necessary to\ndisturb his companion's earnest faith. Then the consciousness of the\nfalsity of his own position surged over him again and he replied: \"Do\nyou mean the period for which Mrs. Dallow insisted on keeping me\ndangling? Oh _that's_ over!\" he almost gaily brought out.\n\n\"And are you married--has it come off?\" the old man asked eagerly. \"How\nlong have I been ill?\"\n\n\"We're uncomfortable, unreasonable people, not deserving of your\ninterest. We're not married,\" Nick said.\n\n\"Then I haven't been ill so long?\" his host quavered with vague relief.\n\n\"Not very long--but things _are_ different,\" he went on.\n\nThe old man's eyes rested on his--he noted how much larger they\nappeared. \"You mean the arrangements are made--the day's at hand?\"\n\n\"There are no arrangements,\" Nick smiled. \"But why should it trouble\nyou?\"\n\n\"What then will you do--without arrangements?\" The inquiry was plaintive\nand childlike.\n\n\"We shall do nothing--there's nothing to be done. We're not to be\nmarried--it's all off,\" said poor Nick. Then he added: \"Mrs. Dallow has\ngone abroad.\"\n\nThe old man, motionless among his pillows, gave a long groan. \"Ah I\ndon't like that.\"\n\n\"No more do I, sir.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? It was so good--so good.\"\n\n\"It wasn't good enough for Julia,\" Nick declared.\n\n\"For Julia? Is Julia so great as that? She told me she had the greatest\nregard for you. You're good enough for the best, my dear boy,\" Mr.\nCarteret pursued.\n\n\"You don't know me: I _am_ disappointing. She had, I believe, a great\nregard for me, but I've forfeited her good opinion.\"\n\nThe old man stared at this cynical announcement: he searched his\nvisitor's face for some attenuation of the words. But Nick apparently\nstruck him as unashamed, and a faint colour coming into his withered\ncheek indicated his mystification and alarm. \"Have you been unfaithful\nto her?\" he still considerately asked.\n\n\"She thinks so--it comes to the same thing. As I told you a year ago,\nshe doesn't believe in me.\"\n\n\"You ought to have made her--you ought to have made her,\" said Mr.\nCarteret. Nick was about to plead some reason when he continued: \"Do you\nremember what I told you I'd give you if you did? Do you remember what I\ntold you I'd give you on your wedding-day?\"\n\n\"You expressed the most generous intentions; and I remember them as much\nas a man may do who has no wish to remind you of them.\"\n\n\"The money's there--I've put it aside.\"\n\n\"I haven't earned it--I haven't earned a penny of it. Give it to those\nwho deserve it more,\" said Nick.\n\n\"I don't understand, I don't understand,\" Mr. Carteret whimpered, the\ntears of weakness in his eyes. His face flushed and he added: \"I'm not\ngood for much discussion; I'm very much disappointed.\"\n\n\"I think I may say it's not my fault--I've done what I can,\" Nick\ndeclared.\n\n\"But when people are in love they do more than that.\"\n\n\"Oh it's all over!\" said our young man; not caring much now, for the\nmoment, how disconcerted his companion might be, so long as he disabused\nhim of the idea that they were partners to a bargain. \"We've tormented\neach other and we've tormented you--and that's all that has come of it.\"\n\nHis companion's eyes seemed to stare at strange things. \"Don't you care\nfor what I'd have done for you--shouldn't you have liked it?\"\n\n\"Of course one likes kindness--one likes money. But it's all over,\" Nick\nrepeated. Then he added: \"I fatigue you, I knock you up, with telling\nyou these troubles. I only do so because it seems to me right you should\nknow. But don't be worried--everything's for the best.\"\n\nHe patted the pale hand reassuringly, inclined himself affectionately,\nbut Mr. Carteret was not easily soothed. He had practised lucidity all\nhis life, had expected it of others and had never given his assent to an\nindistinct proposition. He was weak, yet not too weak to recognise that\nhe had formed a calculation now vitiated by a wrong factor--put his name\nto a contract of which the other side had not been carried out. More\nthan fifty years of conscious success pressed him to try to understand;\nhe had never muddled his affairs and he couldn't muddle them now. At the\nsame time he was aware of the necessity of economising his effort, and\nhe would gather that inward force, patiently and almost cunningly, for\nthe right question and the right induction. He was still able to make\nhis agitation reflective, and it could still consort with his high hopes\nof Nick that he should find himself regarding mere vague, verbal\ncomfort, words in the air, as an inadequate guarantee. So after he had\nattached his dim vision to his young friend's face a moment he brought\nout: \"Have you done anything bad?\"\n\n\"Nothing worse than usual,\" Nick laughed.\n\n\"Ah everything should have been better than usual.\"\n\n\"Well, it hasn't been that--that I must say.\"\n\n\"Do you sometimes think of your father?\" Mr. Carteret continued.\n\nNick had a decent pause. \"_You_ make me think of him--you've always that\npleasant effect.\"\n\n\"His name would have lived--it mustn't be lost.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the competition to-day is terrible,\" Nick returned.\n\nHis host considered this as if he found a serious flaw in it; after\nwhich he began again: \"I never supposed you a trifler.\"\n\n\"I'm determined not to be.\"\n\n\"I thought her charming. Don't you love Mrs. Dallow?\" Mr. Carteret\nprofoundly asked.\n\n\"Don't put it to me so to-day, for I feel sore and injured. I don't\nthink she has treated me well.\"\n\n\"You should have held her--you shouldn't have let her go,\" the old man\nreturned with unexpected fire.\n\nHis visitor flushed at this, so strange was it to receive a lesson in\nenergy from a dying octogenarian. Yet after an instant Nick answered\nwith due modesty: \"I haven't been clever enough, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, don't say that--!\" Mr. Carteret shrunk from the\nthought. \"Don't think I can allow you any easing-off of that sort. I\nknow how well you've done. You're taking your place. Several gentlemen\nhave told me. Hasn't she felt a scruple, knowing my settlement on you to\ndepend----?\" he pursued.\n\n\"Oh she hasn't known--hasn't known anything about it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand; though I think you explained somewhat a year\nago\"--the poor gentleman gave it up. \"I think she wanted to speak to\nme--of any intentions I might have in regard to you--the day she was\nhere. Very nicely, very properly she'd have done it, I'm sure. I think\nher idea was that I ought to make any settlement quite independent of\nyour marrying her or not marrying her. But I tried to convey to her--I\ndon't know whether she understood me--that I liked her too much for\nthat, I wanted too much to make sure of her.\"\n\n\"To make sure of me, you mean,\" said Nick. \"And now after all you see\nyou haven't.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it was that,\" sighed the old man confusedly.\n\n\"All this is very bad for you--we'll talk again,\" Nick urged.\n\n\"No, no--let us finish it now. I like to know what I'm doing. I shall\nrest better when I do know. There are great things to be done; the\nfuture will be full--the future will be fine,\" Mr. Carteret wandered.\n\n\"Let me be distinct about this for Julia: that if we hadn't been\nsundered her generosity to me would have been complete--she'd have put\nher great fortune absolutely at my disposal,\" Nick said after a moment.\n\"Her consciousness of all that naturally carries her over any particular\ndistress in regard to what won't come to me now from another source.\"\n\n\"Ah don't lose it!\" the old man painfully pleaded.\n\n\"It's in your hands, sir,\" Nick returned.\n\n\"I mean Mrs. Dallow's fortune. It will be of the highest utility. That\nwas what your father missed.\"\n\n\"I shall miss more than my father did,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Shell come back to you--I can't look at you and doubt that.\"\n\nNick smiled with a slow headshake. \"Never, never, never! You look at me,\nmy grand old friend, but you don't see me. I'm not what you think.\"\n\n\"What is it--what is it? _Have_ you been bad?\" Mr. Carteret panted.\n\n\"No, no; I'm not bad. But I'm different.\"\n\n\"Different----?\"\n\n\"Different from my father. Different from Mrs. Dallow. Different from\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ah why do you perplex me?\" the old man moaned. \"You've done something.\"\n\n\"I don't want to perplex you, but I have done something,\" said Nick,\ngetting up.\n\nHe had heard the door open softly behind him and Mrs. Lendon come\nforward with precautions. \"What has he done--what has he done?\" quavered\nMr. Carteret to his sister. She, however, after a glance at the patient,\nmotioned their young friend away and, bending over the bed, replied, in\na voice expressive at that moment of an ample provision of vital\ncomfort:\n\n\"He has only excited you, I'm afraid, a little more than is good for\nyou. Isn't your dear old head a little too high?\" Nick regarded himself\nas justly banished, and he quitted the room with a ready acquiescence in\nany power to carry on the scene of which Mrs. Lendon might find herself\npossessed. He felt distinctly brutal as he heard his host emit a weak\nexhalation of assent to some change of position. But he would have\nreproached himself more if he had wished less to guard against the\nacceptance of an equivalent for duties unperformed. Mr. Carteret had had\nin his mind, characteristically, the idea of a fine high contract, and\nthere was something more to be said about that.\n\nNick went out of the house and stayed away for two or three hours, quite\nready to regard the place as quieter and safer without him. He haunted\nthe abbey as usual and sat a long time in its simplifying stillness,\nturning over many things. He came back again at the luncheon-hour,\nthrough the garden, and heard, somewhat to his surprise and greatly to\nhis relief, that his host had composed himself promptly enough after\ntheir agitating interview. Mrs. Lendon talked at luncheon much as if she\nexpected her brother to be, as she said, really quite fit again. She\nasked Nick no awkward question; which was uncommonly good of her, he\nthought, considering that she might have said, \"What in the world were\nyou trying to get out of him?\" She only reported to our young man that\nthe invalid had every hope of a short interview about half-past seven, a\n_very_ short one: this gentle emphasis was Mrs. Lendon's single tribute\nto the critical spirit. Nick divined that Mr. Carteret's desire for\nfurther explanations was really strong and had been capable of\nsustaining him through a bad morning, capable even of helping him--it\nwould have been a secret and wonderful momentary conquest of\nweakness--to pass it off for a good one. He wished he might make a\nsketch of him, from the life, as he had seen him after breakfast; he had\na conviction he could make a strong one, which would be a precious\nmemento. But he shrank from proposing this--the dear man might think it\nunparliamentary. The doctor had called while Nick was out, and he came\nagain at five o'clock without that inmate's seeing him. The latter was\nbusy in his room at that hour: he wrote a short letter which took him a\nlong time. But apparently there had been no veto on a resumption of\ntalk, for at half-past seven his friend sent for him. The nurse at the\ndoor said, \"Only a moment, I hope, sir?\" but took him in and then\nwithdrew.\n\nThe prolonged daylight was in the room and its occupant again\nestablished on his pile of pillows, but with his head a little lower.\nNick sat down by him and expressed the hope of not having upset him in\nthe morning; but the old man, with fixed, enlarged eyes, took up their\nconversation exactly where they had left it. \"What have you done--what\nhave you done? Have you associated yourself with some other woman?\"\n\n\"No, no; I don't think she can accuse me of that.\"\n\n\"Well then she'll come back to you if you take the right way with her.\"\n\nIt might have been droll to hear the poor gentleman, in his situation,\ngive his views on the right way with women; but Nick was not moved to\nenjoy that diversion. \"I've taken the wrong way. I've done something\nthat must spoil my prospects in that direction for ever. I've written a\nletter,\" the visitor went on; but his companion had already interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"You've written a letter?\"\n\n\"To my constituents, informing them of my determination to resign my\nseat.\"\n\n\"To resign your seat?\"\n\n\"I've made up my mind, after no end of reflexion, dear Mr. Carteret, to\nwork on quite other lines. I've a plan of becoming a painter. So I've\ngiven up the idea of a political life.\"\n\n\"A painter?\" Mr. Carteret seemed to turn whiter. \"I'm going in for the\nportrait in oils. It sounds absurd, I know, and I'm thus specific only\nto show you I don't in the least expect you to count on me.\" The invalid\nhad continued to stare at first; then his eyes slowly closed and he lay\nmotionless and blank. \"Don't let it trouble you now; it's a long story\nand rather a poor one; when you get better I'll tell you all about it.\nWell talk it over amicably and I'll bring you to my view,\" Nick went on\nhypocritically. He had laid his hand again on the hand beside him; it\nfelt cold, and as the old man remained silent he had a moment of\nexaggerated fear.\n\n\"This is dreadful news\"--and Mr. Carteret opened his eyes.\n\n\"Certainly it must seem so to you, for I've always kept from you--I was\nashamed, and my present confusion is a just chastisement--the great\ninterest I have always taken in the----!\" But Nick broke down with a\ngasp, to add presently, with an intention of the pleasant and a sense of\nthe foolish: \"In the pencil and the brush.\" He spoke of his current\nconfusion, though his manner might have been thought to show it but\nlittle. He was himself surprised at his brazen assurance and had to\nrecognise that at the point things had come to now he was profoundly\nobstinate and quiet.\n\n\"The pencil--the brush? They're not the weapons of a gentleman,\" Mr.\nCarteret pronounced.\n\n\"I was sure that would be your feeling. I repeat that I mention them\nonly because you once said you intended to do something for me, as the\nphrase is, and I thought you oughtn't to do it in ignorance.\"\n\n\"My ignorance was better. Such knowledge isn't good for me.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, my dear old friend,\" Nick kept it bravely up. \"When you're\nbetter you'll see it differently.\"\n\n\"I shall never be better now.\"\n\n\"Ah no,\" Nick insisted; \"it will really do you good after a little.\nThink it over quietly and you'll be glad I've stopped humbugging.\"\n\n\"I loved you--I loved you as my son,\" the old man wailed.\n\nHe sank on his knee beside the bed and leaned over him tenderly. \"Get\nbetter, get better, and I'll be your son for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"Poor Dormer--poor Dormer!\" Mr. Carteret continued to lament.\n\n\"I admit that if he had lived I probably shouldn't have done it,\" said\nNick. \"I daresay I should have deferred to his prejudices even though\nthinking them narrow.\"\n\n\"Do you turn against your father?\" his host asked, making, to disengage\nhis arm from the young man's touch, an effort betraying the irritation\nof conscious weakness. Nick got up at this and stood a moment looking\ndown at him while he went on: \"Do you give up your name, do you give up\nyour country?\"\n\n\"If I do something good my country may like it.\" Nick spoke as if he had\nthought that out.\n\n\"Do you regard them as equal, the two glories?\"\n\n\"Here comes your nurse to blow me up and turn me out,\" said Nick.\n\nThe nurse had come in, but Mr. Carteret directed to her an audible dry,\ncourteous \"Be so good as to wait till I send for you,\" which arrested\nher in the large room at some distance from the bed and then had the\neffect of making her turn on her heel with a professional laugh. She\nclearly judged that an old gentleman with the fine manner of his prime\nmight still be trusted to take care of himself. When she had gone that\npersonage addressed to his visitor the question for which his deep\ndispleasure lent him strength. \"Do you pretend there's a nobler life\nthan a high political career?\"\n\n\"I think the noble life's doing one's work well. One can do it very ill\nand be very base and mean in what you call a high political career. I\nhaven't been in the House so many months without finding that out. It\ncontains some very small souls.\"\n\n\"You should stand against them--you should expose them!\" stammered Mr.\nCarteret.\n\n\"Stand against them, against one's own party!\"\n\nThe old man contended a moment with this and then broke out: \"God\nforgive you, are you a Tory, are you a Tory?\"\n\n\"How little you understand me!\" laughed Nick with a ring of bitterness.\n\n\"Little enough--little enough, my boy. Have you sent your electors your\ndreadful letter?\"\n\n\"Not yet; but it's all ready and I shan't change my mind.\"\n\n\"You will--you will. You'll think better of it. You'll see your duty,\"\nsaid the invalid almost coaxingly.\n\n\"That seems very improbable, for my determination, crudely and abruptly\nas, to my great regret, it comes to you here, is the fruit of a long and\npainful struggle. The difficulty is that I see my duty just in this\nother effort.\"\n\n\"An effort? Do you call it an effort to fall away, to sink far down, to\ngive up every effort? What does your mother say, heaven help her?\" Mr.\nCarteret went on before Nick could answer the other question.\n\n\"I haven't told her yet.\"\n\n\"You're ashamed, you're ashamed!\" Nick only looked out of the west\nwindow now--he felt his ears turn hot. \"Tell her it would have been\nsixty thousand. I had the money all ready.\"\n\n\"I shan't tell her that,\" said Nick, redder still.\n\n\"Poor woman--poor dear woman!\" Mr. Carteret woefully cried.\n\n\"Yes indeed--she won't like it.\"\n\n\"Think it all over again; don't throw away a splendid future!\" These\nwords were uttered with a final flicker of passion--Nick had never heard\nsuch an accent on his old friend's lips. But he next began to murmur,\n\"I'm tired--I'm very tired,\" and sank back with a groan and with closed\nlips. His guest gently assured him that he had but too much cause to be\nexhausted and that the worst was over now. He smoothed his pillows for\nhim and said he must leave him, would send in the nurse. \"Come back,\ncome back,\" Mr. Carteret pleaded against that; \"come back and tell me\nit's a horrible dream.\"\n\nNick did go back very late that evening; his host had sent a message to\nhis room. But one of the nurses was on the ground this time and made\ngood her opposition watch in hand. The sick-room was shrouded and\ndarkened; the shaded candle left the bed in gloom. Nick's interview with\nhis venerable friend was the affair of but a moment; the nurse\ninterposed, impatient and not understanding. She heard Nick say that he\nhad posted his letter now and their companion flash out with an acerbity\nstill savouring of the sordid associations of a world he had not done\nwith: \"Then of course my settlement doesn't take effect!\"\n\n\"Oh that's all right,\" Nick answered kindly; and he went off next\nmorning by the early train--his injured host was still sleeping. Mrs.\nLendon's habits made it easy for her to be present in matutinal bloom at\nthe young man's hasty breakfast, and she sent a particular remembrance\nto Lady Agnes and (when he should see them) to the Ladies Flora and\nElizabeth. Nick had a prevision of the spirit in which his mother at\nleast would now receive hollow compliments from Beauclere.\n\nThe night before, as soon as he had quitted Mr. Carteret, the old man\nsaid to the nurse that he wished Mr. Chayter instructed to go and fetch\nMr. Mitton the first thing in the morning. Mr. Mitton was the leading\nsolicitor at Beauclere.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nThe really formidable thing for Nick had been to tell his mother: a\ntruth of which he was so conscious that he had the matter out with her\nthe very morning he returned from Beauclere. She and Grace had come back\nthe afternoon before from their own enjoyment of rural hospitality, and,\nknowing this--she had written him her intention from the country--he\ndrove straight from the station to Calcutta Gardens. There was a little\nroom on the right of the house-door known as his own room; but in which\nof a morning, when he was not at home, Lady Agnes sometimes wrote her\nletters. These were always numerous, and when she heard our young man's\ncab she happened to be engaged with them at the big brass-mounted bureau\nthat had belonged to his father, where, amid a margin of works of\npolitical reference, she seemed to herself to make public affairs feel\nthe point of her elbow.\n\nShe came into the hall to meet her son and to hear about their\nbenefactor, and Nick went straight back into the room with her and\nclosed the door. It would be in the evening paper and she would see it,\nand he had no right to allow her to wait for that. It proved indeed a\nterrible hour; and when ten minutes later Grace, who had learned\nupstairs her brother's return, went down for further news of him she\nheard from the hall a sound of voices that made her first pause and\nthen retrace her steps on tiptoe. She mounted to the drawing-room and\ncrept about there, palpitating, looking at moments into the dull street\nand wondering what on earth had taken place. She had no one to express\nher wonder to, for Florence Tressilian had departed and Biddy after\nbreakfast betaken herself, in accordance with a custom now inveterate,\nto Rosedale Road. Her mother was unmistakably and passionately crying--a\nfact tremendous in its significance, for Lady Agnes had not often been\nbrought so low. Nick had seen her cry, but this almost awful spectacle\nhad seldom been offered to Grace, and it now convinced her that some\ndreadful thing had happened.\n\nThat was of course in order, after Nick's mysterious quarrel with Julia,\nwhich had made his mother so ill and was at present followed up with new\nhorrors. The row, as Grace mentally phrased it, had had something to do\nwith the rupture of the lovers--some deeper depth of disappointment had\nbegun to yawn. Grace asked herself if they were talking about Broadwood;\nif Nick had demanded that in the conditions so unpleasantly altered Lady\nAgnes should restore that awfully nice house to its owner. This was\nvery possible, but why should he so suddenly have broken out about\nit? And, moreover, their mother, though sore to bleeding about\nthe whole business--for Broadwood, in its fresh comfort, was too\ndelightful--wouldn't have met this pretension with tears: hadn't she\nalready so perversely declared that they couldn't decently continue to\nmake use of the place? Julia had said that of course they must go on,\nbut Lady Agnes was prepared with an effective rejoinder to that. It\ndidn't consist of words--it was to be austerely practical, was to\nconsist of letting Julia see, at the moment she should least expect it,\nthat they quite wouldn't go on. Lady Agnes was ostensibly waiting for\nthis moment--the moment when her renunciation would be most impressive.\n\nGrace was conscious of how she had for many days been moving with her\nmother in darkness, deeply stricken by Nick's culpable--oh he was\nculpable!--loss of his prize, but feeling an obscure element in the\nmatter they didn't grasp, an undiscovered explanation that would perhaps\nmake it still worse, though it might make _them_, poor things, a little\nbetter. He had explained nothing, he had simply said, \"Dear mother, we\ndon't hit it off, after all; it's an awful bore, but we don't\"--as if\nthat were in the dire conditions an adequate balm for two aching hearts.\nFrom Julia naturally no flood of light was to be looked for--Julia\n_never_ humoured curiosity--and, though she very often did the thing you\nwouldn't suppose, she was not unexpectedly apologetic in this case.\nGrace recognised that in such a position it would savour of apology for\nher to disclose to Lady Agnes her grounds for having let Nick off; and\nshe wouldn't have liked to be the person to suggest to Julia that any\none looked for anything from her. Neither of the disunited pair blamed\nthe other or cast an aspersion, and it was all very magnanimous and\nsuperior and impenetrable and exasperating. With all this Grace had a\nsuspicion that Biddy knew something more, that for Biddy the tormenting\ncurtain had been lifted.\n\nBiddy had come and gone in these days with a perceptible air of\ndetachment from the tribulations of home. It had made her, fortunately,\nvery pretty--still prettier than usual: it sometimes happened that at\nmoments when Grace was most angry she had a faint sweet smile which\nmight have been drawn from some source of occult consolation. It was\nperhaps in some degree connected with Peter Sherringham's visit, as to\nwhich the girl had not been superstitiously silent. When Grace asked\nher if she had secret information and if it pointed to the idea that\neverything would be all right in the end, she pretended to know\nnothing--What should she know? she asked with the loveliest arch of\neyebrows over an unblinking candour--and begged her sister not to let\nLady Agnes believe her better off than themselves. She contributed\nnothing to their gropings save a much better patience, but she went with\nnoticeable regularity, on the pretext of her foolish modelling, to\nRosedale Road. She was frankly on Nick's side; not going so far as to\nsay he had been right, but saying distinctly how sure she was that,\nwhatever had happened, he couldn't have helped it, not a mite. This was\nstriking, because, as Grace knew, the younger of the sisters had been\nmuch favoured by Julia and wouldn't have sacrificed her easily. It\nassociated itself in the irritated mind of the elder with Biddy's\nfrequent visits to the studio and made Miss Dormer ask herself if the\ncrisis in Nick's and Julia's business had not somehow been linked to\nthat unnatural spot.\n\nShe had gone there two or three times while Biddy was working, gone to\npick up any clue to the mystery that might peep out. But she had put her\nhand on nothing more--it wouldn't have occurred to her to say nothing\nless--than the so dreadfully pointed presence of Gabriel Nash. She once\nfound that odd satellite, to her surprise, paying a visit to her\nsister--he had come for Nick, who was absent; she remembered how they\nhad met in Paris and how little he had succeeded with them. When she had\nasked Biddy afterwards how she could receive him that way Biddy had\nreplied that even she, Grace, would have some charity for him if she\ncould hear how fond he was of poor Nick. He had talked to her only of\nNick--of nothing else. Grace had observed how she spoke of Nick as\ninjured, and had noted the implication that some one else, ceasing to be\nfond of him, was thereby condemned in Biddy's eyes. It seemed to Grace\nthat some one else had at least a right not to like some of his friends.\nThe studio struck her as mean and horrid; and so far from suggesting to\nher that it could have played a part in making Nick and Julia fall out\nshe only felt how little its dusty want of consequence, could count, one\nway or the other, for Julia. Grace, who had no opinions on art, saw no\nmerit whatever in those \"impressions\" on canvas from Nick's hand with\nwhich the place was bestrewn. She didn't at all wish her brother to have\ntalent in that direction, yet it was secretly humiliating to her that he\nhadn't more.\n\nNick meanwhile felt a pang of almost horrified penitence, in the little\nroom on the right of the hall, the moment after he had made his mother\nreally understand he had thrown up his scat and that it would probably\nbe in the evening papers. That she would take this very ill was an idea\nthat had pressed upon him hard enough, but she took it even worse than\nhe had feared. He measured, in the look she gave him when the full truth\nloomed upon her, the mortal cruelty of her distress; her face was like\nthat of a passenger on a ship who sees the huge bows of another vessel\ntowering close out of the fog. There are visions of dismay before which\nthe best conscience recoils, and though Nick had made his choice on all\nthe grounds there were a few minutes in which he would gladly have\nadmitted that his wisdom was a dark mistake. His heart was in his\nthroat, he had gone too far; he had been ready to disappoint his\nmother--he had not been ready to destroy her.\n\nLady Agnes, I hasten to add, was not destroyed; she made, after her\nfirst drowning gasp, a tremendous scene of opposition, in the face of\nwhich her son could only fall back on his intrenchments. She must know\nthe worst, he had thought: so he told her everything, including the\nlittle story of the forfeiture of his \"expectations\" from Mr. Carteret.\nHe showed her this time not only the face of the matter, but what lay\nbelow it; narrated briefly the incident in his studio which had led to\nJulia Dallow's deciding she couldn't after all put up with him. This was\nwholly new to Lady Agnes, she had had no clue to it, and he could\ninstantly see how it made the event worse for her, adding a hideous\npositive to an abominable negative. He noted now that, distressed and\ndistracted as she had been by his rupture with Julia, she had still held\nto the faith that their engagement would come on again; believing\nevidently that he had a personal empire over the mistress of Harsh which\nwould bring her back. Lady Agnes was forced to recognise this empire as\nprecarious, to forswear the hope of a blessed renewal from the moment\nthe question was of base infatuations on his own part. Nick confessed to\nan infatuation, but did his best to show her it wasn't base; that it\nwasn't--since Julia had had faith in his loyalty--for the person of the\nyoung lady who had been discovered posturing to him and whom he had seen\nbut half-a-dozen times in his life. He endeavoured to recall to his\nmother the identity of this young lady, he adverted to the occasion in\nParis when they all had seen her together. But Lady Agnes's mind and\nmemory were a blank on the subject of Miss Miriam Rooth and she wanted\nto hear nothing whatever about her: it was enough that she was the cause\nof their ruin and a part of his pitiless folly. She needed to know\nnothing of her to allude to her as if it were superfluous to give a\ndefinite name to the class to which she belonged.\n\nBut she gave a name to the group in which Nick had now taken his place,\nand it made him feel after the lapse of years like a small, scolded,\nsorry boy again; for it was so far away he could scarcely remember\nit--besides there having been but a moment or two of that sort in his\nhappy childhood--the time when this parent had slapped him and called\nhim a little fool. He was a big fool now--hugely immeasurable; she\nrepeated the term over and over with high-pitched passion. The most\npainful thing in this painful hour was perhaps his glimpse of the\nstrange feminine cynicism that lurked in her fine sense of injury. Where\nthere was such a complexity of revolt it would have been difficult to\npick out particular wrongs; but Nick could see that, to his mother's\nimagination, he was most a fool for not having kept his relations with\nthe actress, whatever they were, better from Julia's knowledge. He\nremained indeed freshly surprised at the ardour with which she had\nrested her hopes on Julia. Julia was certainly a combination--she was\naccomplished, she was a sort of leading woman and she was rich; but\nafter all--putting aside what she might be to a man in love with\nher--she was not the keystone of the universe. Yet the form in which the\nconsequences of his apostasy appeared most to come home to Lady Agnes\nwas the loss for the Dormer family of the advantages attached to the\npossession of Mrs. Dallow. The larger mortification would round itself\nlater; for the hour the damning thing was that Nick had made that lady\nthe gift of an unforgivable grievance. He had clinched their separation\nby his letter to his electors--and that above all was the wickedness of\nthe letter. Julia would have got over the other woman, but she would\nnever get over his becoming a nobody.\n\nLady Agnes challenged him upon this low prospect exactly as if he had\nembraced it with the malignant purpose of making the return of his late\nintended impossible. She contradicted her premises and lost her way in\nher wrath. What had made him suddenly turn round if he had been in good\nfaith before? He had never been in good faith--never, never; he had had\nfrom his earliest childhood the nastiest hankerings after a vulgar\nlittle daubing, trash-talking life; they were not in him, the grander,\nnobler aspirations--they never had been--and he had been anything but\nhonest to lead her on, to lead them all on, to think he would do\nsomething: the fall and the shame would have been less for them if they\nhad come earlier. Moreover, what need under heaven had he to tell\nCharles Carteret of the cruel folly on his very death-bed?--as if he\nmightn't have let it all alone and accepted the benefit the old man was\nso delighted to confer. No wonder Mr. Carteret would keep his money for\nhis heirs if that was the way Nick proposed to repay him; but where was\nthe common sense, where was the common charity, where was the common\ndecency of tormenting him with such vile news in his last hours? Was he\ntrying what he could invent that would break her heart, that would send\nher in sorrow down to her grave? Weren't they all miserable enough and\nhadn't he a ray of pity for his wretched sisters?\n\nThe relation of effect and cause, in regard to his sisters'\nwretchedness, was but dimly discernible to Nick, who, however, perceived\nhis mother genuinely to consider that his action had disconnected them\nall, still more than she held they were already disconnected, from the\ngood things of life. Julia was money, Mr. Carteret was money--everything\nelse was the absence of it. If these precious people had been primarily\nmoney for Nick it after all flattered the distributive impulse in him to\nhave taken for granted that for the rest of the family too the\ndifference would have been so great. For days, for weeks and months to\ncome, the little room on the right of the hall was to vibrate for our\nyoung man, as if the very walls and window-panes still suffered, with\nthe odious trial of his true temper.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nThat evening--the evening of his return from Beauclere--he was conscious\nof a keen desire to get away, to go abroad, to leave behind him the\nlittle chatter his resignation would be sure to produce in an age of\npublicity which never discriminated as to the quality of events. Then he\nfelt it decidedly better to stay, to see the business through on the\nspot. Besides, he would have to meet his constituents--would a parcel of\ncheese-eating burgesses ever have been \"met\" on so queer an\noccasion?--and when that was over the incident would practically be\nclosed. Nick had an idea he knew in advance how it would affect him to\nbe pointed at as a person who had given up a considerable chance of\neventual \"office\" to take likenesses at so much a head. He wouldn't\nattempt down at Harsh to touch on the question of motive; for, given the\nnature of the public mind of Harsh, that would be a strain on his\nfaculty of exposition. But as regards the chaff of the political world\nand of society he had a hope he should find chaff enough for retorts. It\nwas true that when his mother twitted him in her own effective way he\nhad felt rather flattened out; but then one's mother might have a\nheavier hand than any one else. He had not thrown up the House of\nCommons to amuse himself; he had thrown it up to work, to sit quietly\ndown and bend over his task. If he should go abroad his parent might\nthink he had some weak-minded view of joining Julia and trying, with\nhowever little hope, to win her back--an illusion it would be singularly\npernicious to encourage. His desire for Julia's society had succumbed\nfor the present at any rate to a dire interruption--he had become more\nand more aware of their speaking a different language. Nick felt like a\nyoung man who has gone to the Rhineland to \"get up\" his German for an\nexamination--committed to talk, to read, to dream only in the new idiom.\nNow that he had taken his jump everything was simplified, at the same\ntime that everything was pitched in a higher and intenser key; and he\nwondered how in the absence of a common dialect he had conversed on the\nwhole so happily with Mrs. Dallow. Then he had aftertastes of\nunderstandings tolerably independent of words. He was excited because\nevery fresh responsibility is exciting, and there was no manner of doubt\nhe had accepted one. No one knew what it was but himself--Gabriel Nash\nscarcely counted, his whole attitude on the question of responsibility\nbeing so fantastic--and he would have to ask his dearest friends to take\nhim on trust. Rather indeed he would ask nothing of any one, but would\ncultivate independence, mulishness, and gaiety, and fix his thoughts on\na bright if distant morrow. It was disagreeable to have to remember that\nhis task would not be sweetened by a sense of heroism; for if it might\nbe heroic to give up the muses for the strife of great affairs, no\nromantic glamour worth speaking of would ever gather round an Englishman\nwho in the prime of his strength had given up great or even small\naffairs for the muses. Such an original might himself privately and\nperversely regard certain phases of this inferior commerce as a great\naffair; but who would give him the benefit of that sort of\nconfidence--except indeed a faithful, clever, exalted little sister\nBiddy, if he should have the good luck to have one? Biddy was in fact\nall ready for heroic flights and eager to think she might fight the\nbattle of the beautiful by her brother's side; so that he had really to\nmoderate her and remind her how little his actual job was a crusade with\nbugles and banners and how much a grey, sedentary grind, the charm of\nwhich was all at the core. You might have an emotion about it, and an\nemotion that would be a help, but this was not the sort of thing you\ncould show--the end in view would seem so disproportionately small. Nick\nput it to her that one really couldn't talk to people about the\n\"responsibility\" of what she would see him pottering at in his studio.\n\nHe therefore didn't \"run,\" as he would have said, to winged words any\nmore than he was forced to, having, moreover, a sense that apologetic\nwork (if apology it should be called to carry the war straight into the\nenemy's country) might be freely left to Gabriel Nash. He laid the\nweight of explanation on his commentators, meeting them all on the firm\nground of his own amusement. He saw he should live for months in a thick\ncloud of irony, not the finest air of the season, and he adopted the\nweapon to which a person whose use of tobacco is only occasional resorts\nwhen every one else produces a cigar--he puffed the spasmodic, defensive\ncigarette. He accepted as to what he had done the postulate of the\nobscurely tortuous, abounding so in that sense that his critics were\nthemselves bewildered. Some of them felt that they got, as the phrase\nis, little out of him--he rose in his good humour so much higher than\nthe \"rise\" they had looked for--on his very first encounter with the\nworld after his scrimmage with his mother. He went to a dinner-party--he\nhad accepted the invitation many days before--having seen his\nresignation, in the form of a telegram from Harsh, announced in the\nevening papers. The people he found there had seen it as well, and the\nwittiest wanted to know what he was now going to do. Even the most\nembarrassed asked if it were true he had changed his politics. He gave\ndifferent answers to different persons, but left most of them under the\nimpression that he had strange scruples of conscience. This, however,\nwas not a formidable occasion, for there had happened to be no one\npresent he would have desired, on the old basis, especially to gratify.\nThere were real good friends it would be less easy to meet--Nick was\nalmost sorry for an hour that he had so many real good friends. If he\nhad had more enemies the case would have been simpler, and he was fully\naware that the hardest thing of all would be to be let off too easily.\nThen he would appear to himself to have been put, all round, on his\ngenerosity, and his deviation would thus wear its ugliest face.\n\nWhen he left the place at which he had been dining he betook himself to\nRosedale Road: he saw no reason why he should go down to the House,\nthough he knew he had not done with that yet. He had a dread of behaving\nas if he supposed he should be expected to make a farewell speech, and\nwas thankful his eminence was not of a nature to create on such an\noccasion a demand for his oratory. He had in fact nothing whatever to\nsay in public--not a vain word, not a sorry syllable. Though the hour\nwas late he found Gabriel Nash established in his studio, drawn thither\nby the fine exhilaration of having seen an evening paper. Trying it\nlate, on the chance, he had been told by Nick's servant that Nick would\nsleep there that night, and he had come in to wait, he was so eager to\ncongratulate him. Nick submitted with a good grace to his society--he\nwas tired enough to go to bed, but was restless too--in spite of noting\nnow, oddly enough, that Nash's congratulations could add little to his\nfortitude. He had felt a good deal, before, as if he were in this\nphilosopher's hands; but since making his final choice he had begun to\nstrike himself as all in his own. Gabriel might have been the angel of\nthat name, but no angel could assist him much henceforth.\n\nNash indeed was as true as ever to his genius while he lolled on a divan\nand emitted a series of reflexions that were even more ingenious than\nopportune. Nick walked up and down the room, and it might have been\nsupposed from his manner that he was impatient for his friend to\nwithdraw. This idea would have been contradicted, however, by the fact\nthat subsequently, after the latter had quitted him, he continued to\nperambulate. He had grown used to Gabriel and must now have been\npossessed of all he had to say. That was one's penalty with persons\nwhose main gift was for talk, however inspiring; talk engendered a sense\nof sameness much sooner than action. The things a man did were\nnecessarily more different from each other than the things he said, even\nif he went in for surprising you. Nick felt Nash could never surprise\nhim any more save by mere plain perpetration.\n\nHe talked of his host's future, talked of Miriam Rooth and of Peter\nSherringham, whom he had seen at that young woman's and whom he\ndescribed as in a predicament delightful to behold. Nick put a question\nabout Peter's predicament and learned, rather to his disappointment,\nthat it consisted only of the fact that he was in love with Miriam. He\nappealed to his visitor to do better than this, and Nash then added the\ntouch that Sherringham wouldn't be able to have her. \"Oh they've ideas!\"\nhe said when Nick asked him why.\n\n\"What ideas? So has he, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they're not the same.\"\n\n\"Well, they'll nevertheless arrange something,\" Nick opined.\n\n\"You'll have to help them a bit. She's in love with another man,\" Nash\nwent on.\n\n\"Do you mean with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm never another man--I'm always more the wrong one than the man\nhimself. It's you she's after.\" And on his friend's asking him what he\nmeant by this Nash added: \"While you were engaged in transferring her\nimage to the tablet of your genius you stamped your own on that of her\nheart.\"\n\nNick stopped in his walk, staring. \"Ah, what a bore!\"\n\n\"A bore? Don't you think her formed to please?\"\n\nNick wondered, but didn't conclude. \"I wanted to go on with her--now I\ncan't.\"\n\nNash himself, however, jumped straight to what really mattered. \"My dear\nfellow, it only makes her handsomer. I wondered what happy turn she had\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's twaddle,\" said Nick, turning away. \"Besides, has she told\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, but her mother has.\"\n\n\"Has she told her mother?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Rooth says not. But I've known Mrs. Rooth to say that which\nisn't.\"\n\n\"Apply that rule then to the information you speak of.\"\n\n\"Well, since you press me, I know more,\" Gabriel said. \"Miriam knows\nyou're engaged to a wonderful, rich lady; she told me as much, told me\nshe had seen her here. That was enough to set her off--she likes\nforbidden fruit.\"\n\n\"I'm not engaged to any lady whatever. I was,\" Nick handsomely\nconceded, \"but we've altered our minds.\"\n\n\"Ah, what a pity!\" his friend wailed.\n\n\"Mephistopheles!\"--and he stopped again with the point of this.\n\n\"Pray then whom do you call Margaret? May I ask if your failure of\ninterest in the political situation is the cause of this change in your\npersonal one?\" Nash went on. Nick signified that he mightn't; whereupon\nhe added: \"I'm not in the least devilish--I only mean it's a pity you've\naltered your minds, since Miriam may in consequence alter hers. She goes\nfrom one thing to another. However, I won't tell her.\"\n\n\"I will then!\" Nick declared between jest and earnest.\n\n\"Would that really be prudent?\" his companion asked more completely in\nthe frolic key.\n\n\"At any rate,\" he resumed, \"nothing would induce me to interfere with\nPeter Sherringham. That sounds fatuous, but to you I don't mind\nappearing an ass.\"\n\n\"The thing would be to get Sherringham, out of spite,\" Nash threw off,\n\"to entangle himself with another woman.\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\"\n\n\"Ah, Miriam would then begin to think of him.\"\n\n\"Spite surely isn't a conceivable motive--for a healthy man.\"\n\nThe plea, however, found Gabriel ready. \"Sherringham's just precisely\nnot a healthy man. He's too much in love.\"\n\n\"Then he won't care for another woman.\"\n\n\"He would try to, and that would produce its effect--its effect on\nMiriam.\"\n\n\"You talk like an American novel. Let him try, and God keep us all\nstraight.\" Nick adverted in extreme silence to his poor little Biddy\nand greatly hoped--he would have to see to it a little--that Peter\nwouldn't \"try\" on _her_. He changed the subject and before Nash withdrew\ntook occasion to remark--the occasion was offered by some new allusion\nof the visitor's to the sport he hoped to extract from seeing Nick carry\nout everything to which he stood committed--that the comedy of the\nmatter would fall flat and the incident pass unnoticed.\n\nBut Nash lost no heart. \"Oh, if you'll simply do your part I'll take\ncare of the rest.\"\n\n\"If you mean by doing my part minding my business and working like a\nbeaver I shall easily satisfy you,\" Nick replied.\n\n\"Ah, you reprobate, you'll become another Sir Joshua, a mere P.R.A.!\"\nhis companion railed, getting up to go.\n\nWhen he had gone Nick threw himself back on the cushions of the divan\nand, with his hands locked above his head, sat a long time lost in\nthought. He had sent his servant to bed; he was unmolested. He gazed\nbefore him into the gloom produced by the unheeded burning-out of the\nlast candle. The vague outer light came in through the tall studio\nwindow and the painted images, ranged about, looked confused in the\ndusk. If his mother had seen him she might have thought he was staring\nat his father's ghost.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nThe night Peter Sherringham walked away from Balaklava Place with\nGabriel Nash the talk of the two men directed itself, as was natural at\nthe time, to the question of Miriam's future fame and the pace, as Nash\ncalled it, at which she would go. Critical spirits as they both were,\nand one of them as dissimulative in passion as the other was paradoxical\nin the absence of it, they yet took her career for granted as completely\nas the simple-minded, a pair of hot spectators in the pit, might have\ndone, and exchanged observations on the assumption that the only\nuncertain element would be the pace. This was a proof of general\nsubjugation. Peter wished not to show, yet wished to know, and in the\nrestlessness of his anxiety was ready even to risk exposure, great as\nthe sacrifice might be of the imperturbable, urbane scepticism most\nappropriate to a secretary of embassy. He couldn't rid himself of the\nsense that Nash had got up earlier than he, had had opportunities of\ncontact in days already distant, the days of Mrs. Rooth's hungry foreign\nrambles. Something of authority and privilege stuck to him from this,\nand it made Sherringham still more uncomfortable when he was most\nconscious that, at the best, even the trained diplomatic mind would\nnever get a grasp of Miriam as a whole. She was constructed to revolve\nlike the terraqueous globe; some part or other of her was always out of\nsight or in shadow.\n\nPeter talked to conceal his feelings, and, like many a man practising\nthat indirectness, rather lost himself in the wood. They agreed that,\nputting strange accidents aside, the girl would go further than any one\nhad gone in England within the memory of man; and that it was a pity, as\nregards marking the comparison, that for so long no one had gone any\ndistance worth speaking of. They further agreed that it would naturally\nseem absurd to any one who didn't know, their prophesying such big\nthings on such small evidence; and they agreed lastly that the absurdity\nquite vanished as soon as the prophets knew as _they_ knew. Their\nknowledge--they quite recognised this--was simply confidence raised to a\nhigh point, the communication of their young friend's own confidence.\nThe conditions were enormously to make, but it was of the very essence\nof Miriam's confidence that she would make them. The parts, the plays,\nthe theatres, the \"support,\" the audiences, the critics, the money were\nall to be found, but she cast a spell that prevented this from seeming a\nserious hitch. One mightn't see from one day to the other what she would\ndo or how she would do it, but this wouldn't stay her steps--she would\nnone the less go on. She would have to construct her own road, as it\nwere, but at the worst there would only be delays in making it. These\ndelays would depend on the hardness of the stones she had to break.\n\nAs Peter had noted, you never knew where to \"have\" Gabriel Nash; a truth\nexemplified in his unexpected delight at the prospect of Miriam's\ndrawing forth the modernness of the age. You might have thought he would\nloathe that modernness; but he had a joyous, amused, amusing vision of\nit--saw it as something huge and fantastically vulgar. Its vulgarity\nwould rise to the grand style, like that of a London railway station,\nand the publicity achieved by their charming charge be as big as the\nglobe itself. All the machinery was ready, the platform laid; the\nfacilities, the wires and bells and trumpets, the roaring, deafening\nnewspaperism of the period--its most distinctive sign--were waiting for\nher, their predestined mistress, to press her foot on the spring and set\nthem all in motion. Gabriel brushed in a large, bright picture of her\nprogress through the time and round the world, round it and round it\nagain, from continent to continent and clime to clime; with populations\nand deputations, reporters and photographers, placards and interviews\nand banquets, steamers, railways, dollars, diamonds, speeches and\nartistic ruin all jumbled into her train. Regardless of expense the\nspectacle would be and thrilling, though somewhat monotonous, the\ndrama--a drama more bustling than any she would put on the stage and a\nspectacle that would beat everything for scenery. In the end her divine\nvoice would crack, screaming to foreign ears and antipodal barbarians,\nand her clever manner would lose all quality, simplified to a few\nunmistakable knock-down dodges. Then she would be at the fine climax of\nlife and glory, still young and insatiate, but already coarse, hard, and\nraddled, with nothing left to do and nothing left to do it with, the\nremaining years all before her and the _raison d'\u00c3\u00aatre_ all behind. It\nwould be splendid, dreadful, grotesque.\n\n\"Oh, she'll have some good years--they'll be worth having,\" Peter\ninsisted as they went. \"Besides, you see her too much as a humbug and\ntoo little as a real producer. She has ideas--great ones; she loves the\nthing for itself. That may keep a woman serious.\"\n\n\"Her greatest idea must always be to show herself, and fortunately she\nhas a great quantity of that treasure to show. I think of her absolutely\nas a real producer, but as a producer whose production is her own\nperson. No 'person,' even as fine a one as hers, will stand that for\nmore than an hour, so that humbuggery has very soon to lend a hand.\nHowever,\" Nash continued, \"if she's a fine humbug it will do as well, it\nwill perfectly suit the time. We can all be saved by vulgarity; that's\nthe solvent of all difficulties and the blessing of this delightful age.\nOne doesn't die of it--save in soul and sense: one dies only of minding\nit. Therefore let no man despair--a new hope has dawned.\"\n\n\"She'll do her work like any other worker, with the advantage over many\nthat her talent's rare,\" Peter obliquely answered. \"Compared with the\nlife of many women that's security and sanity of the highest order. Then\nshe can't help her beauty. You can't vulgarise that.\"\n\n\"Oh, can't you?\" Gabriel cried.\n\n\"It will abide with her till the day of her death. It isn't a mere\nsuperficial freshness. She's very noble.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the pity of it,\" said Nash. \"She's a big more or less\ndirected force, and I quite admit that she'll do for a while a lot of\ngood. She'll have brightened up the world for a great many people--have\nbrought the ideal nearer to them and held it fast for an hour with its\nfeet on earth and its great wings trembling. That's always something,\nfor blest is he who has dropped even the smallest coin into the little\niron box that contains the precious savings of mankind. Miriam will\ndoubtless have dropped a big gold-piece. It will be found in the general\nscramble on the day the race goes bankrupt. And then for herself she'll\nhave had a great go at life.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, she'll have got out of her hole--she won't have vegetated,\"\nPeter concurred. \"That makes her touching to me--it adds to the many\ngood reasons for which one may want to help her. She's tackling a big\njob, and tackling it by herself; throwing herself upon the world in good\nfaith and dealing with it as she can; meeting alone, in her youth, her\nbeauty, her generosity, all the embarrassments of notoriety and all the\ndifficulties of a profession of which, if one half's what's called\nbrilliant the other's frankly odious.\"\n\n\"She has great courage, but you speak of her as solitary with such a lot\nof us all round her?\" Nash candidly inquired.\n\n\"She's a great thing for you and me, but we're a small thing for her.\"\n\n\"Well, a good many small things, if they but stick together, may make up\na mass,\" Gabriel said. \"There must always be the man, you see. He's the\nindispensable element in such a life, and he'll be the last thing she'll\never lack.\"\n\n\"What man are you talking about?\" Peter asked with imperfect ease.\n\n\"The man of the hour, whoever he is. She'll inspire innumerable\ndevotions.\"\n\n\"Of course she will, and they'll be precisely a part of the insufferable\nside of her life.\"\n\n\"Insufferable to whom?\" Nash demanded. \"Don't forget that the\ninsufferable side of her life will be just the side she'll thrive on.\nYou can't eat your cake and have it, and you can't make omelettes\nwithout breaking eggs. You can't at once sit by the fire and parade\nabout the world, and you can't take all chances without having some\nadventures. You can't be a great actress without the luxury of nerves.\nWithout a plentiful supply--or without the right ones--you'll only be\nsecond fiddle. If you've all the tense strings you may take life for\nyour fiddlestick. Your nerves and your adventures, your eggs and your\ncake, are part of the cost of the most expensive of professions. You\nplay with human passions, with exaltations and ecstasies and terrors,\nand if you trade on the fury of the elements you must know how to ride\nthe storm.\"\n\nWell, Peter thought it over. \"Those are the fine old commonplaces about\nthe artistic temperament, but I usually find the artist a very meek,\ndecent, little person.\"\n\n\"You _never_ find the artist--you only find his work, and that's all you\nneed find. When the artist's a woman, and the woman's an actress,\nmeekness and decency will doubtless be there in the right proportions,\"\nNash went on. \"Miriam will represent them for you, if you give her her\ncue, with the utmost charm.\"\n\n\"Of course she'll inspire devotions--_that's_ all right,\" said Peter\nwith a wild cheerfulness.\n\n\"And of course they'll inspire responses, and with that\nconsequence--don't you see?--they'll mitigate her solitude, they'll even\nenliven it,\" Nash set forth.\n\n\"She'll probably box a good many ears: that'll be lively!\" Peter\nreturned with some grimness.\n\n\"Oh magnificent!--it will be a merry life. Yet with its tragic passages,\nits distracted or its pathetic hours,\" Gabriel insisted. \"In short, a\nlittle of everything.\"\n\nThey walked on without further speech till at last Peter resumed: \"The\nbest thing for a woman in her situation is to marry some decent\ncare-taking man.\"\n\n\"Oh I daresay she'll do that too!\" Nash laughed; a remark as a result of\nwhich his companion lapsed afresh into silence. Gabriel left him a\nlittle to enjoy this; after which he added: \"There's somebody she'd\nmarry to-morrow.\"\n\nPeter wondered. \"Do you mean her friend Dashwood?\"\n\n\"No, no, I mean Nick Dormer.\"\n\n\"She'd marry _him_?\" Peter gasped.\n\n\"I mean her head's full of him. But she'll hardly get the chance.\"\n\nPeter watched himself. \"Does she like him as much as that?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know how much you mean, but enough for all practical\nends.\"\n\n\"Marrying a fashionable actress is hardly a practical end.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, but I'm not speaking from his point of view.\" Nash was\nperfectly lucid. \"Moreover, I thought you just now said it would be such\na good thing for her.\"\n\n\"To marry Nick Dormer?\"\n\n\"You said a good decent man, and he's one of the very decentest.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of the individual, but of the protection. It would\nfence her about, settle certain questions, or appear to; it would make\nthings safe and comfortable for her and keep a lot of cads and\nblackguards away.\"\n\n\"She ought to marry the prompter or the box-keeper,\" said Nash. \"Then it\nwould be all right. I think indeed they generally do, don't they?\"\n\nPeter felt for a moment a strong disposition to drop his friend on the\nspot, to cross to the other side of the street and walk away without\nhim. But there was a different impulse which struggled with this one and\nafter a minute overcame it, the impulse that led to his saying\npresently: \"Has she told you she's--a--she's in love with Nick?\"\n\n\"No, no--that's not the way I know it.\"\n\n\"Has Nick told you then?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I've told _him_.\"\n\n\"You've rendered him a questionable service if you've no proof,\" Peter\npronounced.\n\n\"My proof's only that I've seen her with him. She's charming, poor dear\nthing.\"\n\n\"But surely she isn't in love with every man she's charming to.\"\n\n\"I mean she's charming to _me_,\" Nash returned. \"I see her that way. I\nsee her interested--and what it does to her, with her, _for_ her. But\njudge for yourself--the first time you get a chance.\"\n\n\"When shall I get a chance? Nick doesn't come near her.\"\n\n\"Oh he'll come, he'll come; his picture isn't finished.\"\n\n\"You mean _he'll_ be the box-keeper, then?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I shall never allow it,\" said Gabriel Nash. \"It would\nbe idiotic and quite unnecessary. He's beautifully arranged--in quite a\ndifferent line. Fancy his taking that sort of job on his hands! Besides,\nshe'd never expect it; she's not such a goose. They're very good\nfriends--it will go on that way. She's an excellent person for him to\nknow; she'll give him lots of ideas of the plastic kind. He would have\nbeen up there before this, but it has taken him time to play his\ndelightful trick on his constituents. That of course is pure amusement;\nbut when once his effect has been well produced he'll get back to\nbusiness, and his business will be a very different matter from\nMiriam's. Imagine him writing her advertisements, living on her money,\nadding up her profits, having rows and recriminations with her agent,\ncarrying her shawl, spending his days in her rouge-pot. The right man\nfor that, if she must have one, will turn up. '_Pour le mariage, non_.'\nShe isn't wholly an idiot; she really, for a woman, quite sees things as\nthey are.\"\n\nAs Peter had not crossed the street and left Gabriel planted he now\nsuffered the extremity of irritation. But descrying in the dim vista of\nthe Edgware Road a vague and vigilant hansom he waved his stick with\neagerness and with the abrupt declaration that, feeling tired, he must\ndrive the rest of his way. He offered Nash, as he entered the vehicle,\nno seat, but this coldness was not reflected in the lucidity with which\nthat master of every subject went on to affirm that there was of course\na danger--the danger that in given circumstances Miriam would leave the\nstage.\n\n\"Leave it, you mean, for some man?\"\n\n\"For the man we're talking about.\"\n\n\"For Nick Dormer?\" Peter asked from his place in the cab, his paleness\nlighted by its lamps.\n\n\"If he should make it a condition. But why should he? why should he make\n_any_ conditions? He's not an ass either. You see it would be a\nbore\"--Nash kept it up while the hansom waited--\"because if she were to\ndo anything of that sort she'd make him pay for the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, she'd make him pay for the sacrifice,\" Peter blindly concurred.\n\n\"And then when he had paid she'd go back to her footlights,\" Gabriel\ndeveloped from the curbstone as his companion closed the apron of the\ncab.\n\n\"I see--she'd go back--good-night,\" Peter returned. \"_Please_ go on!\" he\ncried to the driver through the hole in the roof. And while the vehicle\nrolled away he growled to himself: \"Of course she would--and quite\nright!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\n\"Judge for yourself when you get a chance,\" Nash had said to him; and as\nit turned out he was able to judge two days later, for he found his\ncousin in Balaklava Place on the Tuesday following his walk with their\ninsufferable friend. He had not only stayed away from the theatre on the\nMonday evening--he regarded this as an achievement of some\nimportance--but had not been near Miriam during the day. He had meant to\nabsent himself from her company on Tuesday as well; a determination\nconfirmed by the fact that the afternoon turned to rain. But when at ten\nminutes to five o'clock he jumped into a hansom and directed his course\nto Saint John's Wood it was precisely upon the weather that he shifted\nthe responsibility of his behaviour.\n\nMiriam had dined when he reached the villa, but she was lying down,\nunduly fatigued, before going to the theatre. Mrs. Rooth was, however,\nin the drawing-room with three gentlemen, in two of whom the fourth\nvisitor was not startled to recognise Basil Dashwood and Gabriel Nash.\nDashwood appeared to have become Miriam's brother-in-arms and a second\nchild--a fonder one--to Mrs. Rooth; it had reached Peter on some late\nvisit that the young actor had finally moved his lodgings into the\nquarter, making himself a near neighbour for all sorts of convenience.\n\"Hang his convenience!\" Peter thought, perceiving that Mrs. Lovick's\n\"Arty\" was now altogether one of the family. Oh the family!--it was a\nqueer one to be connected with: that consciousness was acute in\nSherringham's breast to-day as he entered Mrs. Rooth's little circle.\nThe place was filled with cigarette-smoke and there was a messy\ncoffee-service on the piano, whose keys Basil Dashwood lightly touched\nfor his own diversion. Nash, addressing the room of course, was at one\nend of a little sofa with his nose in the air, and Nick Dormer was at\nthe other end, seated much at his ease and with a certain privileged\nappearance of having been there often before, though Sherringham knew he\nhad not. He looked uncritical and very young, as rosy as a school-boy on\na half-holiday. It was past five o'clock in the day, but Mrs. Rooth was\nnot dressed; there was, however, no want of finish in her elegant\nattitude--the same relaxed grandeur (she seemed to let you understand)\nfor which she used to be distinguished at Castle Nugent when the house\nwas full. She toyed incongruously, in her unbuttoned wrapper, with a\nlarge tinsel fan which resembled a theatrical property.\n\nIt was one of the discomforts of Peter's position that many of those\nminor matters which are superficially at least most characteristic of\nthe histrionic life had power to displease him, so that he was obliged\nconstantly to overlook and condone and pretend. He disliked besmoked\ndrawing-rooms and irregular meals and untidy arrangements; he could\nsuffer from the vulgarity of Mrs. Rooth's apartments, the importunate\nphotographs which gave on his nerves, the barbarous absence of signs of\nan orderly domestic life, the odd volumes from the circulating library\n(you could see what they were--the very covers told you--at a glance)\ntumbled about under smeary cups and glasses. He hadn't waited till now\nto feel it \"rum\" that fate should have let him in for such contacts;\nbut as he stood before his hostess and her companions he wondered\nperhaps more than ever why he should. Her companions somehow, who were\nnot responsible, didn't keep down his wonder; which was particularly\nodd, since they were not superficially in the least of Bohemian type.\nAlmost the first thing that struck him, as happened, in coming into the\nroom, was the fresh fact of the high good looks of his cousin, a\ngentleman, to one's taste and for one's faith, in a different enough\ndegree from the stiff-collared, conversible Dashwood. Peter didn't hate\nNick for being of so fine an English grain; he knew rather the brush of\na new wave of annoyance at Julia's stupid failure to get on with him\nunder that good omen.\n\nIt was his first encounter with the late member for Harsh since his\narrival in London: they had been on one side and the other so much taken\nup with their affairs. Since their last meeting Nick had, as we know, to\nhis kinsman's perception, really put on a new character: he had done the\nfinest stroke of business in the quietest way. This had made him a\npresence to be counted with, and in just the sense in which poor Peter\ndesired least to count. Poor Peter, after his somersault in the blue,\nhad just lately been much troubled; he was ravaged by contending\npassions; he paid every hour in a torment of unrest for what was false\nin his position, the impossibility of keeping the presentable parts of\nhis character together, the opposition of interest and desire. Nick, his\njunior and a lighter weight, had settled _his_ problem and showed no\nwounds; there was something impertinent and mystifying in it. Yet he\nlooked, into the bargain, too innocently young and happy, and too\ncareless and modest and amateurish, to figure as a rival or even as the\ngenius he was apparently going to try to be--the genius that the other\nday, in the studio there with Biddy, Peter had got a startled glimpse of\nhis power to become. Julia's brother would have liked to be aware of\ngrounds of resentment, to be able to hold she had been badly treated or\nthat Nick was basely fatuous, for in that case he might have had the\nresource of taking offence. But where was the outrage of his merely\nbeing liked by a woman in respect to whom one had definitely denied\none's self the luxury of pretensions, especially if, as the wrong-doer,\nhe had taken no action in the matter? It could scarcely be called\nwrong-doing to call, casually, on an afternoon when the lady didn't seem\nto be there. Peter could at any rate rejoice that Miriam didn't; and he\nproposed to himself suggesting to Nick after a little that they should\nadjourn together--they had such interesting things to talk about.\nMeanwhile Nick greeted him with a friendly freedom in which he could\nread neither confusion nor defiance. Peter was reassured against a\ndanger he believed he didn't recognise and puzzled by a mystery he\nflattered himself he hadn't heeded. And he was still more ashamed of\nbeing reassured than of being puzzled.\n\nIt must be recorded that Miriam's absence from the scene was not\nprolonged. Nick, as Sherringham gathered, had been about a quarter of an\nhour in the house, which would have given her, gratified by his\npresence, due time to array herself to come down to him. At all events\nshe was in the room, prepared apparently to go to the theatre, very\nshortly after one of her guests had become sensible of how glad he was\nshe was out of it. Familiarity had never yet cured him of a certain\ntremor of expectation, and even of suspense, in regard to her entrances;\na flutter caused by the simple circumstance of her infinite variety. To\nsay she was always acting would too much convey that she was often\nfatiguing; since her changing face affected this particular admirer at\nleast not as a series of masks, but as a response to perceived\ndifferences, an intensity of that perception, or still more as something\nrichly constructional, like the shifting of the scene in a play or like\na room with many windows. The image she was to project was always\nincalculable, but if her present denied her past and declined\nresponsibility for her future it made a good thing of the hour and kept\nthe actual peculiarly fresh. This time the actual was a bright, gentle,\ngraceful, smiling, young woman in a new dress, eager to go out, drawing\non fresh gloves, who looked as if she were about to step into a carriage\nand--it was Gabriel Nash who thus formulated her physiognomy--do a lot\nof London things.\n\nThe young woman had time to spare, however, and she sat down and talked\nand laughed and presently gave, as seemed to Peter, a deeper glow to the\ntawdry little room, which could do for others if it had to do for her.\nShe described herself as in a state of nervous muddle, exhausted,\nblinded, _abrutie_, with the rehearsals of the forthcoming piece--the\nfirst night was close at hand, and it was going to be of a vileness:\nthey would all see!--but there was no correspondence between this\naccount of the matter and her present bravery of mood. She sent her\nmother away--to \"put on some clothes or something\"--and, left alone with\nthe visitors, went to a long glass between the windows, talking always\nto Nick Dormer, and revised and rearranged a little her own attire. She\ntalked to Nick, over her shoulder, and to Nick only, as if he were the\nguest to recognise and the others didn't count. She broke out at once on\nhis having thrown up his seat, wished to know if the strange story told\nher by Mr. Nash were true--that he had knocked all the hopes of his\nparty into pie.\n\nNick took it any way she liked and gave a pleasant picture of his\nparty's ruin, the critical condition of public affairs: he was as yet\nclearly closed to contrition or shame. The pilgrim from Paris, before\nMiriam's entrance, had not, in shaking hands with him, made even a\nroundabout allusion to his odd \"game\"; he felt he must somehow show good\ntaste--so English people often feel--at the cost of good manners. But he\nwinced on seeing how his scruples had been wasted, and was struck with\nthe fine, jocose, direct turn of his kinsman's conversation with the\nyoung actress. It was a part of her unexpectedness that she took the\nheavy literal view of Nick's behaviour; declared frankly, though without\nill nature, that she had no patience with his mistake. She was horribly\ndisappointed--she had set her heart on his being a great statesman, one\nof the rulers of the people and the glories of England. What was so\nuseful, what was so noble?--how it belittled everything else! She had\nexpected him to wear a cordon and a star some day--acquiring them with\nthe greatest promptitude--and then to come and see her in her _loge_: it\nwould look so particularly well. She talked after the manner of a lovely\nPhilistine, except perhaps when she expressed surprise at\nhearing--hearing from Gabriel Nash--that in England gentlemen accoutred\nwith those emblems of their sovereign's esteem didn't so far forget\nthemselves as to stray into the dressing-rooms of actresses. She\nadmitted after a moment that they were quite right and the\ndressing-rooms of actresses nasty places; but she was sorry, for that\nwas the sort of thing she had always figured in a corner--a\ndistinguished man, slightly bald, in evening dress, with orders,\nadmiring the smallness of a satin shoe and saying witty things. Nash was\nconvulsed with hilarity at this--such a vision of the British political\nhero. Coming back from the glass and making that critic give her his\nplace on the sofa, she seated herself near Nick and continued to\nexpress her regret at his perversity.\n\n\"They all say that--all the charming women, but I shouldn't have looked\nfor it from you,\" Nick replied. \"I've given you such an example of what\nI can do in another line.\"\n\n\"Do you mean my portrait? Oh I've got it, with your name and 'M.P.' in\nthe corner, and that's precisely why I'm content. 'M.P.' in the corner\nof a picture is delightful, but I want to break the mould: I don't in\nthe least insist on your giving specimens to others. And the artistic\nlife, when you can lead another--if you've any alternative, however\nmodest--is a very poor business. It comes last in dignity--after\neverything else. Ain't I up to my eyes in it and don't I truly know?\"\n\n\"You talk like my broken-hearted mother,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Does she hate it so intensely?\"\n\n\"She has the darkest ideas about it--the wildest theories. I can't\nimagine where she gets them; partly I think from a general conviction\nthat the 'esthetic'--a horrible insidious foreign disease--is eating the\nhealthy core out of English life (dear old English life!) and partly\nfrom the charming pictures in _Punch_ and the clever satirical articles,\npointing at mysterious depths of contamination, in the other weekly\npapers. She believes there's a dreadful coterie of uncannily artful and\ndesperately refined people who wear a kind of loose faded uniform and\nworship only beauty--which is a fearful thing; that Gabriel has\nintroduced me to it; that I now spend all my time in it, and that for\nits sweet sake I've broken the most sacred vows. Poor Gabriel, who, so\nfar as I can make out, isn't in any sort of society, however bad!\"\n\n\"But I'm uncannily artful,\" Nash objected, \"and though I can't afford\nthe uniform--I believe you get it best somewhere in South Audley\nStreet--I do worship beauty. I really think it's me the weekly papers\nmean.\"\n\n\"Oh I've read the articles--I know the sort!\" said Basil Dashwood.\n\nMiriam looked at him. \"Go and see if the brougham's there--I ordered it\nearly.\"\n\nDashwood, without moving, consulted his watch. \"It isn't time yet--I\nknow more about the brougham than you. I've made a ripping good\narrangement for her stable--it really costs her nothing,\" the young\nactor continued confidentially to Peter, near whom he had placed\nhimself.\n\n\"Your mother's quite right to be broken-hearted,\" Miriam declared, \"and\nI can imagine exactly what she has been through. I should like to talk\nwith her--I should like to see her.\" Nick showed on this easy amusement,\nreminding her she had talked to him while she sat for her portrait in\nquite the opposite sense, most helpfully and inspiringly; and Nash\nexplained that she was studying the part of a political duchess and\nwished to take observations for it, to work herself into the character.\nThe girl might in fact have been a political duchess as she sat, her\nhead erect and her gloved hands folded, smiling with aristocratic\ndimness at Nick. She shook her head with stately sadness; she might have\nbeen trying some effect for Mary Stuart in Schiller's play. \"I've\nchanged since that. I want you to be the grandest thing there is--the\ncounsellor of kings.\"\n\nPeter wondered if it possibly weren't since she had met his sister in\nNick's studio that she had changed, if perhaps she hadn't seen how it\nmight give Julia the sense of being more effectually routed to know that\nthe woman who had thrown the bomb was one who also tried to keep Nick in\nthe straight path. This indeed would involve an assumption that Julia\nmight know, whereas it was perfectly possible she mightn't and more than\npossible that if she should she wouldn't care. Miriam's essential\nfondness for trying different ways was always there as an adequate\nreason for any particular way; a truth which, however, sometimes only\nhalf-prevented the particular way from being vexatious to a particular\nobserver.\n\n\"Yet after all who's more esthetic than you and who goes in more for the\nbeautiful?\" Nick asked. \"You're never so beautiful as when you pitch\ninto it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm an inferior creature, of an inferior sex, and I've to earn my\nbread as I can. I'd give it all up in a moment, my odious trade--for an\ninducement.\"\n\n\"And pray what do you mean by an inducement?\" Nick demanded.\n\n\"My dear fellow, she means you--if you'll give her a permanent\nengagement to sit for you!\" Gabriel volunteered. \"What singularly crude\nquestions you ask!\"\n\n\"I like the way she talks,\" Mr. Dashwood derisively said, \"when I gave\nup the most brilliant prospects, of very much the same kind as Mr.\nDormer's, expressly to go on the stage.\"\n\n\"You're an inferior creature too,\" Miriam promptly pronounced.\n\n\"Miss Rooth's very hard to satisfy,\" Peter observed at this. \"A man of\ndistinction, slightly bald, in evening dress, with orders, in the corner\nof her _loge_--she has such a personage ready made to her hand and she\ndoesn't so much as look at him. Am _I_ not an inducement? Haven't I\noffered you a permanent engagement?\"\n\n\"Your orders--where are your orders?\" she returned with a sweet smile,\ngetting up.\n\n\"I shall be a minister next year and an ambassador before you know it.\nThen I shall stick on everything that can be had.\"\n\n\"And they call _us_ mountebanks!\" cried the girl. \"I've been so glad to\nsee you again--do you want another sitting?\" she went on to Nick as if\nto take leave of him.\n\n\"As many as you'll give me--I shall be grateful for all,\" he made\nanswer. \"I should like to do you as you are at present. You're totally\ndifferent from the woman I painted--you're wonderful.\"\n\n\"The Comic Muse!\" she laughed. \"Well, you must wait till our first\nnights are over--I'm _sur les dents_ till then. There's everything to do\nand I've to do it all. That fellow's good for nothing, for nothing but\ndomestic life\"--and she glanced at Basil Dashwood. \"He hasn't an\nidea--not one you'd willingly tell of him, though he's rather useful for\nthe stables. We've got stables now--or we try to look as if we had:\nDashwood's ideas are _de cette force_. In ten days I shall have more\ntime.\"\n\n\"The Comic Muse? Never, never,\" Peter protested. \"You're not to go\nsmirking through the age and down to posterity--I'd rather see you as\nMedusa crowned with serpents. That's what you look like when you look\nbest.\"\n\n\"That's consoling--when I've just bought a lovely new bonnet, all red\nroses and bows. I forgot to tell you just now that when you're an\nambassador you may propose anything you like,\" Miriam went on. \"But\nforgive me if I make that condition. Seriously speaking, come to me\nglittering with orders and I shall probably succumb. I can't resist\nstars and garters. Only you must, as you say, have them all. I _don't_\nlike to hear Mr. Dormer talk the slang of the studio--like that phrase\njust now: it _is_ a fall to a lower state. However, when one's low one\nmust crawl, and I'm crawling down to the Strand. Dashwood, see if\nmamma's ready. If she isn't I decline to wait; you must bring her in a\nhansom. I'll take Mr. Dormer in the brougham; I want to talk with Mr.\nDormer; he must drive with me to the theatre. His situation's full of\ninterest.\" Miriam led the way out of the room as she continued to\nchatter, and when she reached the house-door with the four men in her\ntrain the carriage had just drawn up at the garden-gate. It appeared\nthat Mrs. Rooth was not ready, and the girl, in spite of a remonstrance\nfrom Nick, who had a sense of usurping the old lady's place, repeated\nher injunction that she should be brought on in a cab. Miriam's\ngentlemen hung about her at the gate, and she insisted on Nick's taking\nhis seat in the brougham and taking it first. Before she entered she put\nher hand out to Peter and, looking up at him, held his own kindly. \"Dear\nold master, aren't you coming to-night? I miss you when you're not\nthere.\"\n\n\"Don't go--don't go--it's too much,\" Nash freely declared.\n\n\"She is wonderful,\" said Mr. Dashwood, all expert admiration; \"she _has_\ngone into the rehearsals tooth and nail. But nothing takes it out of\nher.\"\n\n\"Nothing puts it into you, my dear!\" Miriam returned. Then she pursued\nto Peter: \"You're the faithful one--you're the one I count on.\" He was\nnot looking at her; his eyes travelled into the carriage, where they\nrested on Nick Dormer, established on the farther seat with his face\nturned toward the farther window. He was the one, faithful or no,\ncounted on or no, whom a charming woman had preferred to carry off, and\nthere was clear triumph for him in that fact. Yet it pleased, it\nsomewhat relieved, his kinsman to see his passivity as not a little\nfoolish. Miriam noted something of this in Peter's eyes, for she\nexclaimed abruptly, \"Don't kill him--he doesn't care for me!\" With which\nshe passed into the carriage and let it roll away.\n\nPeter stood watching it till he heard Dashwood again beside him. \"You\nwouldn't believe what I make him do the whole thing for--a little rascal\nI know.\"\n\n\"Good-bye; take good care of Mrs. Rooth,\" said Gabriel Nash, waving a\nbland farewell to the young actor. He gave a smiling survey of the\nheavens and remarked to Sherringham that the rain had stopped. Was he\nwalking, was he driving, should they be going in the same direction?\nPeter cared little about his direction and had little account of it to\ngive; he simply moved away in silence and with Gabriel at his side. This\nconverser was partly an affliction to him; indeed the fact that he\ncouldn't only make light of him added to the oppression. It was just to\nhim nevertheless to note that he could hold his peace occasionally: he\nhad for instance this afternoon taken little part in the talk at\nBalaklava Place. Peter greatly disliked to speak to him of Miriam, but\nhe liked Nash himself to make free with her, and even liked him to say\nsuch things as might be a little viciously and unguardedly contradicted.\nHe was not, however, moved to gainsay something dropped by his\ncompanion, disconnectedly, at the end of a few minutes; a word to the\neffect that she was after all the best-natured soul alive. All the same,\nNash added, it wouldn't do for her to take possession of a nice life\nlike Nick's; and he repeated that for his part he would never allow it.\nIt would be on his conscience to interfere. To which Peter returned\ndisingenuously that they might all do as they liked--it didn't matter a\nbutton to _him_. And with an effort to carry off that comedy he changed\nthe subject.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nHe wouldn't for a moment have admitted that he was jealous of his old\ncomrade, but would almost have liked to be accused of it: for this would\nhave given him a chance he rather lacked and missed, the right occasion\nto declare with plausibility that motives he couldn't avow had no\napplication to his case. How could a man be jealous when he was not a\nsuitor? how could he pretend to guard a property which was neither his\nown nor destined to become his own? There could be no question of loss\nwhen one had nothing at stake, and no question of envy when the\nresponsibility of possession was exactly what one prayed to be delivered\nfrom. The measure of one's susceptibility was one's pretensions, and\nPeter was not only ready to declare over and over again that, thank God,\nhe had none: his spiritual detachment was still more complete--he\nliterally suffered from the fact that nobody appeared to care to hear\nhim say it. He connected an idea of virtue and honour with his attitude,\nsince surely it was a high case of conduct to have quenched a personal\npassion for the good of the public service. He had gone over the whole\nquestion at odd, irrepressible hours; he had returned, spiritually\nspeaking, the buffet administered to him all at once, that day in\nRosedale Road, by the spectacle of the _cr\u00c3\u00a2nerie_ with which Nick could\nlet worldly glories slide. Resolution for resolution he preferred after\nall another sort, and his own _cr\u00c3\u00a2nerie_ would be shown in the way he\nshould stick to his profession and stand up for British interests. If\nNick had leaped over a wall he would leap over a river. The course of\nhis river was already traced and his loins were already girded. Thus he\nwas justified in holding that the measure of a man's susceptibility was\na man's attitude: that was the only thing he was bound to give an\naccount of.\n\nHe was perpetually giving an account of it to his own soul in default of\nother listeners. He was quite angry at having tasted a sweetness in\nMiriam's assurance at the carriage--door, bestowed indeed with very\nlittle solemnity, that Nick didn't care for her. Wherein did it concern\nhim that Nick cared for her or that Nick didn't? Wherein did it signify\nto him that Gabriel Nash should have taken upon himself to disapprove of\na union between the young actress and the young painter and to frustrate\nan accident that might perhaps prove fortunate? For those had also been\ncooling words at the hour, though Peter blushed on the morrow to think\nthat he felt in them anything but Nash's personal sublimity. He was\nashamed of having been refreshed, and refreshed by so sickly a\ndraught--it being all his theory that he was not in a fever. As for\nkeeping an eye on Nick, it would soon become clear to that young man and\nthat young man's charming friend that he had quite other uses for his\neyes. The pair, with Nash to help, might straighten out their\ncomplications according to their light. He would never speak to Nick of\nMiriam; he felt indeed just now as if he should never speak to Nick of\nanything. He had traced the course of his river, as I say, and the real\nproof would be in the way he should, clearing the air, land on the\nopposite bank. It was a case for action--for vigorous, unmistakable\naction. He had done very little since his arrival in London but moon\nround a _fille de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_ who was taken up partly, though she bluffed\nit off, with another man, and partly with arranging new petticoats for a\nbeastly old \"poetic drama\"; but this little waste of time should\ninstantly be made up. He had given himself a definite rope, and he had\ndanced to the end of his rope, and now he would dance back. That was all\nright--so right that Peter could only express to himself how right it\nwas by whistling with extravagance.\n\nHe whistled as he went to dine with a great personage the day after his\nmeeting with Nick in Balaklava Place; a great personage to whom he had\noriginally paid his respects--it was high time--the day before that\nmeeting, the previous Monday. The sense of omissions to repair, of a\nsuperior line to take, perhaps made him study with more zeal to please\nthe personage, who gave him ten minutes and asked him five questions. A\ngreat many doors were successively opened before any palpitating pilgrim\nwho was about to enter the presence of this distinguished man; but they\nwere discreetly closed again behind Sherringham, and I must ask the\nreader to pause with me at the nearer end of the momentary vista. This\nparticular pilgrim fortunately felt he could count on recognition not\nonly as a faithful if obscure official in the great hierarchy, but as a\nclever young man who happened to be connected by blood with people his\nlordship had intimately known. No doubt it was simply as the clever\nyoung man that Peter received the next morning, from the dispenser of\nhis lordship's hospitality, a note asking him to dine on the morrow.\nSuch cards had come to him before, and he had always obeyed their call;\nhe did so at present, however, with a sense of unusual intention. In due\ncourse his intention was translated into words; before the gentlemen\nleft the dining-room he respectfully asked his noble host for some\nfurther brief and benevolent hearing.\n\n\"What is it you want? Tell me now,\" the master of his fate replied,\nmotioning to the rest of the company to pass out and detaining him where\nthey stood.\n\nPeter's excellent training covered every contingency: he could always be\nas concise or as diffuse as the occasion required. Even he himself,\nhowever, was surprised at the quick felicity of the terms in which he\nwas conscious of conveying that, were it compatible with higher\nconveniences, he should extremely like to be transferred to duties in a\nmore distant quarter of the globe. Indeed, fond as he was of thinking\nhimself a man of emotions controlled by civility, it is not impossible\nthat a greater candour than he knew glimmered through Peter's expression\nand trembled through his tone as he presented this petition. He had\naimed at a good manner in presenting it, but perhaps the best of the\neffect produced for his interlocutor was just where it failed, where it\nconfessed a secret that the highest diplomacy would have guarded.\nSherringham remarked to the minister that he didn't care in the least\nwhere the place might be, nor how little coveted a post; the further\naway the better, and the climate didn't matter. He would only prefer of\ncourse that there should be really something to do, though he would make\nthe best of it even if there were not. He stopped in time, or at least\nthought he did, not to betray his covertly seeking relief from minding\nhis having been jilted in a flight to latitudes unfavourable to human\nlife. His august patron gave him a sharp look which for a moment seemed\nthe precursor of a sharper question; but the moment elapsed and the\nquestion failed to come. This considerate omission, characteristic of a\ntrue man of the world and representing quick guesses and still quicker\nindifferences, made our gentleman from that moment his lordship's ardent\npartisan. What did come was a good-natured laugh and the exclamation:\n\"You know there are plenty of swamps and jungles, if you want that sort\nof thing,\" Peter replied that it was very much that sort of thing he did\nwant; whereupon his chief continued: \"I'll see--I'll see. If anything\nturns up you shall hear.\"\n\nSomething turned up the very next day: our young man, taken at his word,\nfound himself indebted to the postman for a note of concise intimation\nthat the high position of minister to the smallest of Central American\nrepublics would be apportioned him. The republic, though small, was big\nenough to be \"shaky,\" and the position, though high, not so exalted that\nthere were not much greater altitudes above it to which it was a\nstepping-stone. Peter, quite ready to take one thing with another,\nrejoiced at his easy triumph, reflected that he must have been even more\nnoticed at headquarters than he had hoped, and, on the spot, consulting\nnobody and waiting for nothing, signified his unqualified acceptance of\nthe place. Nobody with a grain of sense would have advised him to do\nanything else. It made him happier than he had supposed he should ever\nbe again; it made him feel professionally in the train, as they said in\nParis; it was serious, it was interesting, it was exciting, and his\nimagination, letting itself loose into the future, began once more to\nscale the crowning eminence. It was very simple to hold one's course if\none really tried, and he blessed the variety of peoples. Further\ncommunications passed, the last enjoining on him to return to Paris for\na short interval a week later, after which he would be advised of the\ndate for his proceeding to his remoter duties.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nThe next thing he meanwhile did was to call with his news on Lady Agnes\nDormer; it is not unworthy of note that he took on the other hand no\nstep to make his promotion known to Miriam Rooth. To render it probable\nhe should find his aunt he went at the luncheon-hour; and she was indeed\non the point of sitting down to that repast with Grace. Biddy was not at\nhome--Biddy was never at home now, her mother said: she was always at\nNick's place, she spent her life there, she ate and drank there, she\nalmost slept there. What she contrived to do there for so many hours and\nwhat was the irresistible spell Lady Agnes couldn't pretend she had\nsucceeded in discovering. She spoke of this baleful resort only as\n\"Nick's place,\" and spoke of it at first as little as possible. She\njudged highly probable, however, that Biddy would come in early that\nafternoon: there was something or other, some common social duty, she\nhad condescended to promise she would perform with Grace. Poor Lady\nAgnes, whom Peter found somehow at once grim and very prostrate--she\nassured her nephew her nerves were all gone--almost abused her younger\ndaughter for two minutes, having evidently a deep-seated need of abusing\nsome one. I must yet add that she didn't wait to meet Grace's eye before\nrecovering, by a rapid gyration, her view of the possibilities of\nthings--those possibilities from which she still might squeeze, as a\nparent almost in despair, the drop that would sweeten her cup. \"Dear\nchild,\" she had the presence of mind to subjoin, \"her only fault is\nafter all that she adores her brother. She has a capacity for adoration\nand must always take her gospel from some one.\"\n\nGrace declared to Peter that her sister would have stayed at home if she\nhad dreamed he was coming, and Lady Agnes let him know that she had\nheard all about the hour he had spent with the poor child at Nick's\nplace and about his extraordinary good nature in taking the two girls to\nthe play. Peter lunched in Calcutta Gardens, spending an hour there\nwhich proved at first unexpectedly and, as seemed to him, unfairly\ndismal. He knew from his own general perceptions, from what Biddy had\ntold him and from what he had heard Nick say in Balaklava Place, that\nhis aunt would have been wounded by her son's apostasy; but it was not\ntill he saw her that he appreciated the dark difference this young man's\nbehaviour had made in the outlook of his family. Evidently that\nbehaviour had sprung a dreadful leak in the great vessel of their hopes.\nThese were things no outsider could measure, and they were none of an\noutsider's business; it was enough that Lady Agnes struck him really as\na woman who had received her death-blow. She looked ten years older; she\nwas white and haggard and tragic. Her eyes burned with a strange fitful\nfire that prompted one to conclude her children had better look out for\nher. When not filled with this unnatural flame they were suffused with\ncomfortless tears; and altogether the afflicted lady was, as he viewed\nher, very bad, a case for anxiety. It was because he had known she would\nbe very bad that he had, in his kindness, called on her exactly in this\nmanner; but he recognised that to undertake to be kind to her in\nproportion to her need might carry one very far. He was glad he had not\nhimself a wronged mad mother, and he wondered how Nick could bear the\nburden of the home he had ruined. Apparently he didn't bear it very far,\nbut had taken final, convenient refuge in Rosedale Road.\n\nPeter's judgement of his perverse cousin was considerably confused, and\nnot the less so for the consciousness that he was perhaps just now not\nin the best state of mind for judging him at all. At the same time,\nthough he held in general that a man of sense has always warrant enough\nin his sense for doing the particular thing he prefers, he could\nscarcely help asking himself whether, in the exercise of a virile\nfreedom, it had been absolutely indispensable Nick should work such\ndomestic woe. He admitted indeed that that was an anomalous figure for\nNick, the worker of domestic woe. Then he saw that his aunt's\ngrievance--there came a moment, later, when she asserted as much--was\nnot quite what her recreant child, in Balaklava Place, had represented\nit--with questionable taste perhaps--to a mocking actress; was not a\nmere shocked quarrel with his adoption of a \"low\" career, or a horror,\nthe old-fashioned horror, of the _louches_ licences taken by artists\nunder pretext of being conscientious: the day for this was past, and\nEnglish society thought the brush and the fiddle as good as anything\nelse--with two or three exceptions. It was not what he had taken up but\nwhat he had put down that made the sorry difference, and the tragedy\nwould have been equally great if he had become a wine-merchant or a\nhorse-dealer. Peter had gathered at first that Lady Agnes wouldn't trust\nherself to speak directly of her trouble, and he had obeyed what he\nsupposed the best discretion in making no allusion to it. But a few\nminutes before they rose from table she broke out, and when he\nattempted to utter a word of mitigation there was something that went to\nhis heart in the way she returned: \"Oh you don't know--you don't know!\"\nHe felt Grace's eyes fixed on him at this instant in a mystery of\nsupplication, and was uncertain as to what she wanted--that he should\nsay something more to console her mother or should hurry away from the\nsubject. Grace looked old and plain and--he had thought on coming\nin--rather cross, but she evidently wanted something. \"You don't know,\"\nLady Agnes repeated with a trembling voice, \"you don't know.\" She had\npushed her chair a little away from her place; she held her\npocket-handkerchief pressed hard to her mouth, almost stuffed into it,\nand her eyes were fixed on the floor. She made him aware he did\nvirtually know--know what towering piles of confidence and hope had been\ndashed to the earth. Then she finished her sentence unexpectedly--\"You\ndon't know what my life with my great husband was.\" Here on the other\nhand Peter was slightly at fault--he didn't exactly see what her life\nwith her great husband had to do with it. What was clear to him,\nhowever, was that they literally had looked for things all in the very\nkey of that greatness from Nick. It was not quite easy to see why this\nhad been the case--it had not been precisely Peter's own prefigurement.\nNick appeared to have had the faculty of planting that sort of\nflattering faith in women; he had originally given Julia a tremendous\ndose of it, though she had since shaken off the effects.\n\n\"Do you really think he would have done such great things, politically\nspeaking?\" Peter risked. \"Do you consider that the root of the matter\nwas so essentially in him?\"\n\nHis hostess had a pause, looking at him rather hard. \"I only think what\nall his friends--all his father's friends--have thought. He was his\nfather's son after all. No young man ever had a finer training, and he\ngave from the first repeated proof of the highest ability, the highest\nambition. See how he got in everywhere. Look at his first seat--look at\nhis second,\" Lady Agnes continued. \"Look at what every one says at this\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Look at all the papers!\" said Grace. \"Did you ever hear him speak?\" she\nasked. And when Peter reminded her how he had spent his life in foreign\nlands, shut out from such pleasures, she went on: \"Well, you lost\nsomething.\"\n\n\"It was very charming,\" said Lady Agnes quietly and poignantly.\n\n\"Of course he's charming, whatever he does,\" Peter returned. \"He'll be a\ncharming artist.\"\n\n\"Oh God help us!\" the poor lady groaned, rising quickly.\n\n\"He won't--that's the worst,\" Grace amended. \"It isn't as if he'd do\nthings people would like, I've been to his place, and I never saw such a\nhorrid lot of things--not at all clever or pretty.\"\n\nYet her mother, at this, turned upon her with sudden asperity. \"You know\nnothing whatever about the matter!\" Then she added for Peter that, as it\nhappened, her children did have a good deal of artistic taste: Grace was\nthe only one who was totally deficient in it. Biddy was very\nclever--Biddy really might learn to do pretty things. And anything the\npoor child could learn was now no more than her duty--there was so\nlittle knowing what the future had in store for them all.\n\n\"You think too much of the future--you take terribly gloomy views,\" said\nPeter, looking for his hat.\n\n\"What other views can one take when one's son has deliberately thrown\naway a fortune?\"\n\n\"Thrown one away? Do you mean through not marrying----?\"\n\n\"I mean through killing by his perversity the best friend he ever had.\"\n\nPeter stared a moment; then with laughter: \"Ah but Julia isn't dead of\nit!\"\n\n\"I'm not talking of Julia,\" said his aunt with a good deal of majesty.\n\"Nick isn't mercenary, and I'm not complaining of that.\"\n\n\"She means Mr. Carteret,\" Grace explained with all her competence. \"He'd\nhave done anything if Nick had stayed in the House.\"\n\n\"But he's not dead?\"\n\n\"Charles Carteret's dying,\" said Lady Agnes--\"his end's dreadfully near.\nHe has been a sort of providence to us--he was Sir Nicholas's second\nself. But he won't put up with such insanity, such wickedness, and that\nchapter's closed.\"\n\n\"You mean he has dropped Nick out of his will?\"\n\n\"Cut him off utterly. He has given him notice.\"\n\n\"The old scoundrel!\"--Peter couldn't keep this back. \"But Nick will work\nthe better for that--he'll depend on himself.\"\n\n\"Yes, and whom shall we depend on?\" Grace spoke up.\n\n\"Don't be vulgar, for God's sake!\" her mother ejaculated with a certain\ninconsequence.\n\n\"Oh leave Nick alone--he'll make a lot of money,\" Peter declared\ncheerfully, following his two companions into the hall.\n\n\"I don't in the least care if he does or not,\" said Lady Agnes. \"You\nmust come upstairs again--I've lots to say to you yet,\" she went on,\nseeing him make for his hat. \"You must arrange to come and dine with us\nimmediately; it's only because I've been so steeped in misery that I\ndidn't write to you the other day--directly after you had called. We\ndon't give parties, as you may imagine, but if you'll come just as we\nare, for old acquaintance' sake--\"\n\n\"Just with Nick--if Nick will come--and dear Biddy,\" Grace interposed.\n\n\"Nick must certainly come, as well as dear Biddy, whom I hoped so much\nto find,\" Peter pronounced. \"Because I'm going away--I don't know when\nI, shall see them again.\"\n\n\"Wait with mamma. Biddy will come in now at any moment,\" Grace urged.\n\n\"You're going away?\" said Lady Agnes, pausing at the foot of the stairs\nand turning her white face upon him. Something in her voice showed she\nhad been struck by his own tone.\n\n\"I've had promotion and you must congratulate me. They're sending me out\nas minister to a little hot hole in Central America--six thousand miles\naway. I shall have to go rather soon.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm so glad!\" Lady Agnes breathed. Still she paused at the foot of\nthe stair and still she gazed.\n\n\"How very delightful--it will lead straight off to all sorts of other\ngood things!\" Grace a little coarsely commented.\n\n\"Oh I'm crawling up--I'm an excellency,\" Peter laughed.\n\n\"Then if you dine with us your excellency must have great people to meet\nyou.\"\n\n\"Nick and Biddy--they're great enough.\"\n\n\"Come upstairs--come upstairs,\" said Lady Agnes, turning quickly and\nbeginning to ascend.\n\n\"Wait for Biddy--I'm going out,\" Grace continued, extending her hand to\nher kinsman. \"I shall see you again--not that you care; but good-bye\nnow. Wait for Biddy,\" the girl repeated in a lower tone, fastening her\neyes on his with the same urgent mystifying gleam he thought he had\nnoted at luncheon.\n\n\"Oh I'll go and see her in Rosedale Road,\" he threw off.\n\n\"Do you mean to-day--now?\"\n\n\"I don't know about to-day, but before I leave England.\"\n\n\"Well, she'll be in immediately,\" said Grace. \"Good-bye to your\nexcellency.\"\n\n\"Come up, Peter--_please_ come up,\" called Lady Agnes from the top of\nthe stairs.\n\nHe mounted and when he found himself in the drawing-room with her and\nthe door closed she expressed her great interest in his fine prospects\nand position, which she wished to hear all about. She rang for coffee\nand indicated the seat he would find most comfortable: it shone before\nhim for a moment that she would tell him he might if he wished light a\ncigar. For Peter had suddenly become restless--too restless to occupy a\ncomfortable chair; he seated himself in it only to jump up again, and he\nwent to the window, while he imparted to his hostess the very little he\nknew about his post, on hearing a vehicle drive up to the door. A strong\nlight had just been thrown into his mind, and it grew stronger when,\nlooking out, he saw Grace Dormer issue from the house in a hat and a\njacket which had all the air of having been assumed with extraordinary\nspeed. Her jacket was unbuttoned and her gloves still dangling from the\nhands with which she was settling her hat. The vehicle into which she\nhastily sprang was a hansom-cab which had been summoned by the butler\nfrom the doorstep and which rolled away with her after she had given an\naddress.\n\n\"Where's Grace going in such a hurry?\" he asked of Lady Agnes; to which\nshe replied that she hadn't the least idea--her children, at the pass\nthey had all come to, knocked about as they liked.\n\nWell, he sat down again; he stayed a quarter of an hour and then he\nstayed longer, and during this time his appreciation of what she had in\nher mind gathered force. She showed him that precious quantity clearly\nenough, though she showed it by no clumsy, no voluntary arts. It looked\nout of her sombre, conscious eyes and quavered in her preoccupied,\nperfunctory tones. She took an extravagant interest in his future\nproceedings, the probable succession of events in his career, the\ndifferent honours he would be likely to come in for, the salary attached\nto his actual appointment, the salary attached to the appointments that\nwould follow--they would be sure to, wouldn't they?--and what he might\nreasonably expect to save. Oh he must save--Lady Agnes was an advocate\nof saving; and he must take tremendous pains and get on and be clever\nand fiercely ambitious: he must make himself indispensable and rise to\nthe top. She was urgent and suggestive and sympathetic; she threw\nherself into the vision of his achievements and emoluments as if to\nappease a little the sore hunger with which Nick's treachery had left\nher. This was touching to her nephew, who didn't remain unmoved even at\nthose more importunate moments when, as she fell into silence, fidgeting\nfeverishly with a morsel of fancy-work she had plucked from a table, her\nwhole presence became an intense, repressed appeal to him. What that\nappeal would have been had it been uttered was: \"Oh Peter, take little\nBiddy; oh my dear young friend, understand your interests at the same\ntime that you understand mine; be kind and reasonable and clever; save\nme all further anxiety and tribulation and accept my lovely, faultless\nchild from my hands.\"\n\nThat was what Lady Agnes had always meant, more or less, that was what\nGrace had meant, and they meant it with singular lucidity on the present\noccasion, Lady Agnes meant it so much that from one moment to another\nhe scarce knew what she might do; and Grace meant it so much that she\nhad rushed away in a hansom to fetch her sister from the studio. Grace,\nhowever, was a fool, for Biddy certainly wouldn't come. The news of his\npromotion had started them off, adding point to their idea of his being\nan excellent match; bringing home to them sharply the sense that if he\nwere going away to strange countries he must take Biddy with him--that\nsomething at all events must be settled about Biddy before he went. They\nhad suddenly begun to throb, poor things, with alarm at the ebbing\nhours.\n\nStrangely enough the perception of all this hadn't the effect of\nthrowing him on the defensive and still less that of making him wish to\nbolt. When once he had made sure what was in the air he recognised a\npropriety, a real felicity in it; couldn't deny that he was in certain\nways a good match, since it was quite probable he would go far; and was\neven generous enough--as he had no fear of being materially dragged to\nthe altar--to enter into the conception that he might offer some balm to\na mother who had had a horrid disappointment. The feasibility of\nmarrying Biddy was not exactly augmented by the idea that his doing so\nwould be a great offset to what Nick had made Lady Agnes suffer; but at\nleast Peter didn't dislike his strenuous aunt so much as to wish to\npunish her for her nature. He was not afraid of her, whatever she might\ndo; and though unable to grasp the practical relevancy of Biddy's being\nproduced on the instant was willing to linger half an hour on the chance\nof successful production.\n\nThere was meanwhile, moreover, a certain contagion in Lady Agnes's\nappeal--it made him appeal sensibly to himself, since indeed, as it is\ntime to say, the glass of our young man's spirit had been polished for\nthat reflexion. It was only at this moment really that he became\ninwardly candid. While making up his mind that his only safety was in\nflight and taking the strong measure of a request for help toward it, he\nwas yet very conscious that another and probably still more effectual\nsafeguard--especially if the two should be conjoined--lay in the hollow\nof his hand. His sister's words in Paris had come back to him and had\nseemed still wiser than when uttered: \"She'll save you disappointments;\nyou'd know the worst that can happen to you, and it wouldn't be bad.\"\nJulia had put it into a nutshell--Biddy would probably save him\ndisappointments. And then she was--well, she was Biddy. Peter knew\nbetter what that was since the hour he had spent with her in Rosedale\nRoad. But he had brushed away the sense of it, though aware that in\ndoing so he took only half-measures and was even guilty of a sort of\nfraud upon himself. If he was sincere in wishing to put a gulf between\nhis future and that sad expanse of his past and present over which\nMiriam had cast her shadow there was a very simple way to do so. He had\ndodged this way, dishonestly fixing on another which, taken alone, was\nfar from being so good; but Lady Agnes brought him back to it. She held\nhim in well-nigh confused contemplation of it, during which the safety,\nas Julia had called it, of the remedy wrought upon him as he wouldn't\nhave believed beforehand, and not least to the effect of sweetening, of\nprettily colouring, the pill. It would be simple and it would deal with\nall his problems; it would put an end to all alternatives, which, as\nalternatives were otherwise putting an end to him, would be an excellent\nthing. It would settle the whole question of his future, and it was high\ntime this should be settled.\n\nPeter took two cups of coffee while he made out his future with Lady\nAgnes, but though he drank them slowly he had finished them before Biddy\nturned up. He stayed three-quarters of an hour, saying to himself she\nwouldn't come--why should she come? Lady Agnes stooped to no avowal; she\nreally stooped, so far as bald words went, to no part of the business;\nbut she made him fix the next day save one for coming to dinner, and her\nrepeated declaration that there would be no one else, not another\ncreature but themselves, had almost the force of the supplied form for a\npromise to pay. In giving his word that he would come without fail, and\nnot write the next day to throw them over for some function he should\nchoose to dub obligatory, he felt quite as if he were putting his name\nto such a document. He went away at half-past three; Biddy of course\nhadn't come, and he had been sure she wouldn't. He couldn't imagine what\nGrace's idea had been, nor what pretext she had put forward to her\nsister. Whatever these things Biddy had seen through them and hated\nthem. Peter could but like her the more for that.\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nLady Agnes would doubtless have done better, in her own interest or in\nthat of her child, to have secured his company for the very next\nevening. This she had indeed attempted, but her application of her\nthought had miscarried, Peter bethinking himself that he was importantly\nengaged. Her ladyship, moreover, couldn't presume to answer for Nick,\nsince after all they must of course _have_ Nick, though, to tell the\ntruth, the hideous truth, she and her son were scarcely on terms. Peter\ninsisted on Nick, wished particularly to see him, and gave his hostess\nnotice that he would make each of them forgive everything to the other.\nShe returned that all her son had to forgive was her loving him more\nthan her life, and she would have challenged Peter, had he allowed it,\non the general ground of the comparative dignity of the two arts of\npainting portraits and governing nations. Our friend declined the\nchallenge: the most he did was to intimate that he perhaps saw Nick more\nvividly as a painter than as a governor. Later he remembered vaguely\nsomething his aunt had said about their being a governing family.\n\nHe was going, by what he could ascertain, to a very queer climate and\nhad many preparations to make. He gave his best attention to these, and\nfor a couple of hours after leaving Lady Agnes rummaged London for books\nfrom which he might extract information about his new habitat. It made\napparently no great figure in literature, and Peter could reflect that\nhe was perhaps destined to find a salutary distraction in himself\nfilling the void with a volume of impressions. After he had resigned\nhimself to necessary ignorance he went into the Park. He treated himself\nto an afternoon or two there when he happened to drop upon London in\nsummer--it refreshed his sense of the British interests he would have to\nstand up for. Moreover, he had been hiding more or less, and now all\nthat was changed and this was the simplest way not to hide. He met a\nhost of friends, made his situation as public as possible and accepted\non the spot a great many invitations; all subject, however, to the\nmental reservation that he should allow none of them to interfere with\nhis being present the first night of Miriam's new venture. He was going\nto the equator to get away from her, but to repudiate the past with some\ndecency of form he must show an affected interest, if he could muster\nnone other, in an occasion that meant so much for her. The least\nintimate of her associates would do that, and Peter remembered how, at\nthe expense of good manners, he had stayed away from her first\nappearance on any stage at all. He would have been shocked had he found\nhimself obliged to go back to Paris without giving her at the imminent\ncrisis the personal countenance she had so good a right to expect.\n\nIt was nearly eight o'clock when he went to Great Stanhope Street to\ndress for dinner and learn that a note awaiting him on the hall-table\nand which bore the marks of hasty despatch had come three or four hours\nbefore. It exhibited the signature of Miriam Rooth and let him know that\nshe positively expected him at the theatre by eleven o'clock the next\nmorning, for which hour a dress-rehearsal of the revived play had been\nhurriedly projected, the first night being now definitely fixed for the\nimpending Saturday. She counted on his attendance at both ceremonies,\nbut with particular reasons for wishing to see him in the morning. \"I\nwant you to see and judge and tell me,\" she said, \"for my mind's like a\nflogged horse--it won't give another kick.\" It was for the Saturday he\nhad made Lady Agnes his promise; he had thought of the possibility of\nthe play in doing so, but had rested in the faith that, from valid\nsymptoms, this complication would not occur till the following week. He\ndecided nothing on the spot as to the conflict of occupations--it was\nenough to send Miriam three words to the effect that he would sooner\nperish than fail her on the morrow.\n\nHe went to the theatre in the morning, and the episode proved curious\nand instructive. Though there were twenty people in the stalls it bore\nlittle resemblance to those _r\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9titions g\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rales_ to which, in Paris,\nhis love of the drama had often attracted him and which, taking place at\nnight, in the theatre closed to the public, are virtually first\nperformances with invited spectators. They were to his sense always\nsettled and stately, rehearsals of the _premi\u00c3\u00a8re_ even more than\nrehearsals of the play. The present occasion was less august; it was not\nso much a concert as a confusion of sounds, and it took audible and at\ntimes disputatious counsel with itself. It was rough and frank and\nspasmodic, but was lively and vivid and, in spite of the serious\ncharacter of the piece, often exceedingly droll: while it gave\nSherringham, oddly enough, a more present sense than ever of bending\nover the hissing, smoking, sputtering caldron in which a palatable\nperformance is stewed. He looked into the gross darkness that may result\nfrom excess of light; that is, he understood how knocked up, on the eve\nof production, every one concerned in the preparation of a piece might\nbe, with nerves overstretched and glasses blurred, awaiting the test\nand the response, the echo to be given back by the big, receptive,\nartless, stupid, delightful public. Peter's interest had been great in\nadvance, and as Miriam since his arrival had taken him much into her\nconfidence he knew what she intended to do and had discussed a hundred\npoints with her. They had differed about some of them and she had always\nsaid: \"Ah but wait till you see how I shall do it at the time!\" That was\nusually her principal reason and her most convincing argument. She had\nmade some changes at the last hour--she was going to do several things\nin another way. But she wanted a touchstone, wanted a fresh ear, and, as\nshe told Sherringham when he went behind after the first act, that was\nwhy she had insisted on this private trial, to which a few fresh ears\nwere to be admitted. They didn't want to allow it her, the theatre\npeople, they were such a parcel of donkeys; but as to what she meant in\ngeneral to insist on she had given them a hint she flattered herself\nthey wouldn't soon forget.\n\nShe spoke as if she had had a great battle with her fellow-workers and\nhad routed them utterly. It was not the first time he had heard her talk\nas if such a life as hers could only be a fighting life and of her frank\nmeasure of the fine uses of a faculty for making a row. She rejoiced she\npossessed this faculty, for she knew what to do with it; and though\nthere might be a certain swagger in taking such a stand in advance when\none had done the infinitely little she had yet done, she nevertheless\ntrusted to the future to show how right she should have been in\nbelieving a pack of idiots would never hold out against her and would\nknow they couldn't afford to. Her assumption of course was that she\nfought for the light and the right, for the good way and the thorough,\nfor doing a thing properly if one did it at all. What she had really\nwanted was the theatre closed for a night and the dress-rehearsal, put\non for a few people, given instead of _Yolande_. That she had not got,\nbut she would have it the next time. She spoke as if her triumphs behind\nthe scenes as well as before would go by leaps and bounds, and he could\nperfectly see, for the time, that she would drive her coadjutors in\nfront of her like sheep. Her tone was the sort of thing that would have\nstruck one as preposterous if one hadn't believed in her; but if one did\nso believe it only seemed thrown in with the other gifts. How was she\ngoing to act that night and what could be said for such a hateful way of\ndoing things? She thrust on poor Peter questions he was all unable to\nanswer; she abounded in superlatives and tremendously strong objections.\nHe had a sharper vision than usual of the queer fate, for a peaceable\nman, of being involved in a life of so violent a rhythm: one might as\nwell be hooked to a Catharine-wheel and whiz round in flame and smoke.\n\nIt had only been for five minutes, in the wing, amid jostling and\nshuffling and shoving, that they held this conference. Miriam, splendid\nin a brocaded anachronism, a false dress of the beginning of the\ncentury, and excited and appealing, imperious, reckless and\ngood-humoured, full of exaggerated propositions, supreme determinations\nand comic irrelevancies, showed as radiant a young head as the stage had\never seen. Other people quickly surrounded her, and Peter saw that\nthough, she wanted, as she said, a fresh ear and a fresh eye she was\nliable to rap out to those who possessed these advantages that they\ndidn't know what they were talking about. It was rather hard for her\nvictims--Basil Dashwood let him into this, wonderfully painted and in a\ndress even more beautiful than Miriam's, that of a young dandy under\nCharles the Second: if you were not in the business you were one kind\nof donkey and if you _were_ in the business you were another kind. Peter\nnoted with a certain chagrin that Gabriel Nash had failed; he preferred\nto base his annoyance on that ground when the girl, after the remark\njust quoted from Dashwood, laughing and saying that at any rate the\nthing would do because it would just have to do, thrust vindictively but\nfamiliarly into the young actor's face a magnificent feather fan. \"Isn't\nhe too lovely,\" she asked, \"and doesn't he know how to do it?\" Dashwood\nhad the sense of costume even more than Peter had inferred or supposed\nhe minded, inasmuch as it now appeared he had gone profoundly into the\nquestion of what the leading lady was to wear. He had drawn patterns and\nhunted up stuffs, had helped her to try on her clothes, had bristled\nwith ideas and pins. It would not have been quite clear, Peter's ground\nfor resenting Nash's cynical absence; it may even be thought singular he\nshould have missed him. At any rate he flushed a little when their young\nwoman, of whom he inquired whether she hadn't invited her oldest and\ndearest friend, made answer: \"Oh he says he doesn't like the\nkitchen-fire--he only wants the pudding!\" It would have taken the\nkitchen-fire to account at that point for the red of Sherringham's\ncheek; and he was indeed uncomfortably heated by helping to handle, as\nhe phrased it, the saucepans.\n\nThis he felt so much after he had returned to his seat, which he forbore\nto quit again till the curtain had fallen on the last act, that in spite\nof the high beauty of that part of the performance of which Miriam\ncarried the weight there were moments when his relief overflowed into\ngasps, as if he had been scrambling up the bank of a torrent after an\nimmersion. The girl herself, out in the open of her field to win, was of\nthe incorruptible faith: she had been saturated to good purpose with the\ngreat spirit of Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9. That was conspicuous while the play went\non and she guarded the whole march with fagged piety and passion.\nSherringham had never liked the piece itself; he held that as barbarous\nin form and false in feeling it did little honour to the British\ntheatre; he despised many of the speeches, pitied Miriam for having to\nutter them, and considered that, lighted by that sort of candle, the\npath of fame might very well lead nowhere.\n\nWhen the ordeal was over he went behind again, where in the\nrose-coloured satin of the silly issue the heroine of the occasion said\nto him: \"Fancy my having to drag through that other stuff to-night--the\nbrutes!\" He was vague about the persons designated in this allusion, but\nhe let it pass: he had at the moment a kind of detached foreboding of\nthe way any gentleman familiarly connected with her in the future would\nprobably form the habit of letting objurgations and some other things\npass. This had become indeed now a frequent state of mind with him; the\ninstant he was before her, near her, next her, he found himself a\nhelpless subject of the spell which, so far at least as he was\nconcerned, she put forth by contact and of which the potency was\npunctual and absolute: the fit came on, as he said, exactly as some\nesteemed express-train on a great line bangs at a given moment into the\nstation. At a distance he partly recovered himself--that was the\nencouragement for going to the shaky republic; but as soon as he entered\nher presence his life struck him as a thing disconnected from his will.\nIt was as if he himself had been one thing and his behaviour another; he\nhad shining views of this difference, drawn as they might be from the\ncoming years--little illustrative scenes in which he saw himself in\nstrange attitudes of resignation, always rather sad and still and with a\nslightly bent head. Such images should not have been inspiring, but it\nis a fact that they were something to go upon. The gentleman with the\nbent head had evidently given up something that was dear to him, but it\nwas exactly because he had got his price that he was there. \"Come and\nsee me three or four hours hence,\" Miriam said--\"come, that is, about\nsix. I shall rest till then, but I want particularly to talk with you.\nThere will be no one else--not the tip of any tiresome nose. You'll do\nme good.\" So of course he drove up at six.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\n\n\"I don't know; I haven't the least idea; I don't care; don't ask\nme!\"--it was so he met some immediate appeal of her artistic egotism,\nsome challenge of his impression of her at this and that moment. Hadn't\nshe frankly better give up such and such a point and return to their\nfirst idea, the one they had talked over so much? Peter replied to this\nthat he disowned all ideas; that at any rate he should never have\nanother as long as he lived, and that, so help him heaven, they had\nworried that hard bone more than enough.\n\n\"You're tired of me--yes, already,\" she said sadly and kindly. They were\nalone, her mother had not peeped out and she had prepared herself to\nreturn to the Strand. \"However, it doesn't matter and of course your\nhead's full of other things. You must think me ravenously\nselfish--perpetually chattering about my vulgar shop. What will you have\nwhen one's a vulgar shop-girl? You used to like it, but then you weren't\nan ambassador.\"\n\n\"What do you know about my being a minister?\" he asked, leaning back in\nhis chair and showing sombre eyes. Sometimes he held her handsomer on\nthe stage than off, and sometimes he reversed that judgement. The former\nof these convictions had held his mind in the morning, and it was now\npunctually followed by the other. As soon as she stepped on the boards\na great and special alteration usually took place in her--she was in\nfocus and in her frame; yet there were hours too in which she wore her\nworld's face before the audience, just as there were hours when she wore\nher stage face in the world. She took up either mask as it suited her\nhumour. To-day he was seeing each in its order and feeling each the\nbest. \"I should know very little if I waited for you to tell me--that's\nvery certain,\" Miriam returned. \"It's in the papers that you've got a\nhigh appointment, but I don't read the papers unless there's something\nin them about myself. Next week I shall devour them and think them, no\ndoubt, inane. It was Basil told me this afternoon of your promotion--he\nhad seen it announced somewhere, I'm delighted if it gives you more\nmoney and more advantages, but don't expect me to be glad that you're\ngoing away to some distant, disgusting country.\"\n\n\"The matter has only just been settled and we've each been busy with our\nown affairs. But even if you hadn't given me these opportunities,\" Peter\nwent on, \"I should have tried to see you to-day, to tell you my news and\ntake leave of you.\"\n\n\"Take leave? Aren't you coming to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I shall see you through that. But I shall rush away the very\nmoment it's over.\"\n\n\"I shall be much better then--really I shall,\" the girl said.\n\n\"The better you are the worse you are.\"\n\nShe returned his frown with a beautiful charity. \"If it would do you any\ngood I'd be bad.\"\n\n\"The worse you are the better you are!\" Peter laughed. \"You're a\ndevouring demon.\"\n\n\"Not a bit! It's you.\"\n\n\"It's I? I like that.\"\n\n\"It's you who make trouble, who are sore and suspicious and supersubtle,\nnot taking things as they come and for what they are, but twisting them\ninto misery and falsity. Oh I've watched you enough, my dear friend, and\nI've been sorry for you--and sorry as well for myself; for I'm not so\ntaken up with myself, in the low greedy sense, as you think. I'm not\nsuch a base creature. I'm capable of gratitude, I'm capable of\naffection. One may live in paint and tinsel, but one isn't absolutely\nwithout a soul. Yes, I've got one,\" the girl went on, \"though I do smear\nmy face and grin at myself in the glass and practise my intonations. If\nwhat you're going to do is good for you I'm very glad. If it leads to\ngood things, to honour and fortune and greatness, I'm enchanted. If it\nmeans your being away always, for ever and ever, of course that's\nserious. You know it--I needn't tell you--I regard you as I really don't\nregard any one else. I've a confidence in you--ah it's a luxury! You're\na gentleman, _mon bon_--ah you're a gentleman! It's just that. And then\nyou see, you understand, and that's a luxury too. You're a luxury\naltogether, dear clever Mr. Sherringham. Your being where I shall never\nsee you isn't a thing I shall enjoy; I know that from the separation of\nthese last months--after our beautiful life in Paris, the best thing\nthat ever happened to me or that ever will. But if it's your career, if\nit's your happiness--well, I can miss you and hold my tongue. I _can_ be\ndisinterested--I can!\"\n\n\"What did you want me to come for?\" he asked, all attentive and\nmotionless. The same impression, the old impression, was with him again;\nthe sense that if she was sincere it was sincerity of execution, if she\nwas genuine it was the genuineness of doing it well. She did it so well\nnow that this very fact was charming and touching. In claiming from him\nat the theatre this hour of the afternoon she had wanted honestly (the\nmore as she had not seen him at home for several days) to go over with\nhim once again, on the eve of the great night--it would be for her\nsecond creation the critics would lie so in wait; the first success\nmight have been a fluke--some of her recurrent doubts: knowing from\nexperience of what good counsel he often was, how he could give a\nworrying question its \"settler\" at the last. Then she had heard from\nDashwood of the change in his situation, and that had really from one\nmoment to the other made her think sympathetically of his\npreoccupations--led her open-handedly to drop her own. She was sorry to\nlose him and eager to let him know how good a friend she was conscious\nhe had been to her. But the expression of this was already, at the end\nof a minute, a strange bedevilment: she began to listen to herself, to\nspeak dramatically, to represent. She uttered the things she felt as if\nthey were snatches of old play-books, and really felt them the more\nbecause they sounded so well. This, however, didn't prevent their really\nbeing as good feelings as those of anybody else, and at the moment her\nfriend, to still a rising emotion--which he knew he shouldn't\nstill--articulated the challenge I have just recorded, she had for his\nsensibility, at any rate, the truth of gentleness and generosity.\n\n\"There's something the matter with you, my dear--you're jealous,\" Miriam\nsaid. \"You're jealous of poor Mr. Dormer. That's an example of the way\nyou tangle everything up. Lord, he won't hurt you, nor me either!\"\n\n\"He can't hurt me, certainly,\" Peter returned, \"and neither can you; for\nI've a nice little heart of stone and a smart new breastplate of iron.\nThe interest I take in you is something quite extraordinary; but the\nmost extraordinary thing in it is that it's perfectly prepared to\ntolerate the interest of others.\"\n\n\"The interest of others needn't trouble it much!\" Miriam declared. \"If\nMr. Dormer has broken off his marriage to such an awfully fine\nwoman--for she's that, your swell of a sister--it isn't for a ranting\nwretch like me. He's kind to me because that's his nature and he notices\nme because that's his business; but he's away up in the clouds--a\nthousand miles over my head. He has got something 'on,' as they say;\nhe's in love with an idea. I think it's a shocking bad one, but that's\nhis own affair. He's quite _exalt\u00c3\u00a9_; living on nectar and ambrosia--what\nhe has to spare for us poor crawling things on earth is only a few dry\ncrumbs. I didn't even ask him to come to rehearsal. Besides, he thinks\nyou're in love with me and that it wouldn't be honourable to cut in.\nHe's capable of that--isn't it charming?\"\n\n\"If he were to relent and give up his scruples would you marry him?\"\nPeter asked.\n\n\"Mercy, how you chatter about 'marrying'!\" the girl laughed. \"_C'est la\nmaladie anglaise_--you've all got it on the brain.\"\n\n\"Why I put it that way to please you,\" he explained. \"You complained to\nme last year precisely that this was not what seemed generally wanted.\"\n\n\"Oh last year!\"--she made nothing of that. Then differently, \"Yes, it's\nvery tiresome!\" she conceded.\n\n\"You told me, moreover, in Paris more than once that you wouldn't listen\nto anything but that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she declared, \"I won't, but I shall wait till I find a husband\nwho's charming enough and bad enough. One who'll beat me and swindle me\nand spend my money on other women--that's the sort of man for me. Mr.\nDormer, delightful as he is, doesn't come up to that.\"\n\n\"You'll marry Basil Dashwood.\" He spoke it with conviction.\n\n\"Oh 'marry'?--call it marry if you like. That's what poor mother\nthreatens me with--she lives in dread of it.\"\n\n\"To this hour,\" he mentioned, \"I haven't managed to make out what your\nmother wants. She has so many ideas, as Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9 said.\"\n\n\"She wants me to be some sort of tremendous creature--all her ideas are\nreducible to that. What makes the muddle is that she isn't clear about\nthe creature she wants most. A great actress or a great lady--sometimes\nshe inclines for one and sometimes for the other, but on the whole\npersuading herself that a great actress, if she'll cultivate the right\npeople, may _be_ a great lady. When I tell her that won't do and that a\ngreat actress can never be anything but a great vagabond, then the dear\nold thing has tantrums, and we have scenes--the most grotesque: they'd\nmake the fortune, for a subject, of some play-writing rascal, if he had\nthe wit to guess them; which, luckily for us perhaps, he never will. She\nusually winds up by protesting--_devinez un peu quoi_!\" Miriam added.\nAnd as her companion professed his complete inability to divine: \"By\ndeclaring that rather than take it that way I must marry _you_.\"\n\n\"She's shrewder than I thought,\" Peter returned. \"It's the last of\nvanities to talk about, but I may state in passing that if you'd marry\nme you should be the greatest of all possible ladies.\"\n\nShe had a beautiful, comical gape. \"Lord o' mercy, my dear fellow, what\nnatural capacity have I for that?\"\n\n\"You're artist enough for anything. I shall be a great diplomatist: my\nresolution's firmly taken, I'm infinitely cleverer than you have the\nleast idea of, and you shall be,\" he went on, \"a great diplomatist's\nwife.\"\n\n\"And the demon, the devil, the devourer and destroyer, that you are so\nfond of talking about: what, in such a position, do you do with that\nelement of my nature? _O\u00c3\u00b9 le fourrez-vous_?\" she cried as with a real\nanxiety.\n\n\"I'll look after it, I'll keep it under. Rather perhaps I should say\nI'll bribe it and amuse it; I'll gorge it with earthly grandeurs.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" said Miriam; \"for a demon that's kept under is a shabby\nlittle demon. Don't let's be shabby.\" Then she added: \"Do you really go\naway the beginning of next week?\"\n\n\"Monday night if possible.\"\n\n\"Ah that's but to Paris. Before you go to your new post they must give\nyou an interval here.\"\n\n\"I shan't take it--I'm so tremendously keen for my duties. I shall\ninsist on going sooner. Oh,\" he went on, \"I shall be concentrated now.\"\n\n\"I'll come and act there.\" She met it all--she was amused and amusing.\n\"I've already forgotten what it was I wanted to discuss with you,\" she\nsaid--\"it was some trumpery stuff. What I want to say now is only one\nthing: that it's not in the least true that because my life pitches me\nin every direction and mixes me up with all sorts of people--or rather\nwith one sort mainly, poor dears!--I haven't a decent character, I\nhaven't common honesty. Your sympathy, your generosity, your patience,\nyour precious suggestions, our dear sweet days last summer in Paris, I\nshall never forget. You're the best--you're different from all the\nothers. Think of me as you please and make profane jokes about my mating\nwith a disguised 'Arty'--I shall think of _you_ only in one way. I've a\ngreat respect for you. With all my heart I hope you'll be a great\ndiplomatist. God bless you, dear clever man.\"\n\nShe got up as she spoke and in so doing glanced at the clock--a movement\nthat somehow only added to the noble gravity of her discourse: she was\nconsidering his time so much more than her own. Sherringham, at this,\nrising too, took out his watch and stood a moment with his eyes bent\nupon it, though without in the least seeing what the needles marked.\n\"You'll have to go, to reach the theatre at your usual hour, won't you?\nLet me not keep you. That is, let me keep you only long enough just to\nsay this, once for all, as I shall never speak of it again. I'm going\naway to save myself,\" he frankly said, planted before her and seeking\nher eyes with his own. \"I ought to go, no doubt, in silence, in decorum,\nin virtuous submission to hard necessity--without asking for credit or\nsympathy, without provoking any sort of scene or calling attention to my\nfortitude. But I can't--upon my soul I can't. I can go, I can see it\nthrough, but I can't hold my tongue. I want you to know all about it, so\nthat over there, when I'm bored to death, I shall at least have the\nexasperatingly vain consolation of feeling that you do know--and that it\ndoes neither you nor me any good!\"\n\nHe paused a moment; on which, as quite vague, she appealed. \"That I 'do\nknow' what?\"\n\n\"That I've a consuming passion for you and that it's impossible.\"\n\n\"Oh impossible, my friend!\" she sighed, but with a quickness in her\nassent.\n\n\"Very good; it interferes, the gratification of it would interfere\nfatally, with the ambition of each of us. Our ambitions are inferior and\nodious, but we're tied fast to them.\"\n\n\"Ah why ain't we simple?\" she quavered as if all touched by it. \"Why\nain't we of the people--_comme tout le monde_--just a man and a girl\nliking each other?\"\n\nHe waited a little--she was so tenderly mocking, so sweetly ambiguous.\n\"Because we're precious asses! However, I'm simple enough, after all,\nto care for you as I've never cared for any human creature. You have, as\nit happens, a personal charm for me that no one has ever approached, and\nfrom the top of your splendid head to the sole of your theatrical shoe\n(I could go down on my face--there, abjectly--and kiss it!) every inch\nof you is dear and delightful to me. Therefore good-bye.\"\n\nShe took this in with wider eyes: he had put the matter in a way that\nstruck her. For a moment, all the same, he was afraid she would reply as\non the confessed experience of so many such tributes, handsome as this\none was. But she was too much moved--the pure colour that had risen to\nher face showed it--to have recourse to this particular facility. She\nwas moved even to the glimmer of tears, though she gave him her hand\nwith a smile. \"I'm so glad you've said all that, for from you I know\nwhat it means. Certainly it's better for you to go away. Of course it's\nall wrong, isn't it?--but that's the only thing it can be: therefore\nit's all right, isn't it? Some day when we're both great people we'll\ntalk these things over; then we shall be quiet, we shall be rich, we\nshall be at peace--let us hope so at least--and better friends than\nothers about us will know.\" She paused, smiling still, and then said\nwhile he held her hand: \"Don't, _don't_ come to-morrow night.\"\n\nWith this she attempted to draw her hand away, as if everything were\nsettled and over; but the effect of her movement was that, as he held\nher tight, he was simply drawn toward her and close to her. The effect\nof this, in turn, was that, releasing her only to possess her the more\ncompletely, he seized her in his arms and, breathing deeply \"I love you,\nyou know,\" clasped her in a long embrace. His demonstration and her\nconscious sufferance, almost equally liberal, so sustained themselves\nthat the door of the room had time to open slowly before either had\ntaken notice. Mrs. Rooth, who had not peeped in before, peeped in now,\nbecoming in this manner witness of an incident she could scarce have\ncounted on. The unexpected indeed had for Mrs. Rooth never been an\ninsuperable element in things; it was her position in general to be too\nacquainted with all the passions for any crude surprise. As the others\nturned round they saw her stand there and smile, and heard her ejaculate\nwith wise indulgence: \"Oh you extravagant children!\"\n\nMiriam brushed off her tears, quickly but unconfusedly. \"He's going\naway, the wretch; he's bidding us farewell.\"\n\nPeter--it was perhaps a result of his acute agitation--laughed out at\nthe \"us\" (he had already laughed at the charge of puerility), and Mrs.\nRooth went on: \"Going away? Ah then I must have one too!\" She held out\nboth her hands, and Sherringham, stepping forward to take them, kissed\nher respectfully on each cheek, in the foreign manner, while she\ncontinued: \"Our dear old friend--our kind, gallant gentleman!\"\n\n\"The gallant gentleman has been promoted to a great post--the proper\nreward of his gallantry,\" Miriam said. \"He's going out as minister to\nsome impossible place--where is it?\"\n\n\"As minister--how very charming! We _are_ getting on.\" And their\ncompanion languished up at him with a world of approval.\n\n\"Oh well enough. One must take what one can get,\" he answered.\n\n\"You'll get everything now, I'm sure, shan't you?\" Mrs. Rooth asked with\nan inflexion that called back to him comically--the source of the sound\nwas so different--the very vibrations he had heard the day before from\nLady Agnes.\n\n\"He's going to glory and he'll forget all about us--forget he has ever\nknown such low people. So we shall never see him again, and it's better\nso. Good-bye, good-bye,\" Miriam repeated; \"the brougham must be there,\nbut I won't take you. I want to talk to mother about you, and we shall\nsay things not fit for you to hear. Oh I'll let you know what we\nlose--don't be afraid,\" she added to Mrs. Rooth. \"He's the rising star\nof diplomacy.\"\n\n\"I knew it from the first--I know how things turn out for such people as\nyou!\" cried the old woman, gazing fondly at Sherringham. \"But you don't\nmean to say you're not coming to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"Don't--don't; it's great folly,\" Miriam interposed; \"and it's quite\nneedless, since you saw me to-day.\"\n\nPeter turned from the mother to the daughter, the former of whom broke\nout to the latter: \"Oh you dear rogue, to say one has _seen_ you yet!\nYou know how you'll come up to it--you'll be beyond everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall be there--certainly,\" Peter said, at the door, to Mrs.\nRooth.\n\n\"Oh you dreadful goose!\" Miriam called after him. But he went out\nwithout looking round at her.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\n\nNick Dormer had for the hour quite taken up his abode at his studio,\nwhere Biddy usually arrived after breakfast to give him news of the\nstate of affairs in Calcutta Gardens and where many letters and\ntelegrams were now addressed him. Among such missives, on the morning of\nthe Saturday on which Peter Sherringham had promised to dine at the\nother house, was a note from Miriam Rooth, informing Nick that if he\nshouldn't telegraph to put her off she would turn up about half-past\neleven, probably with her mother, for just one more sitting. She added\nthat it was a nervous day for her and that she couldn't keep still, so\nthat it would really be very kind to let her come to him as a refuge.\nShe wished to stay away from the theatre, where everything was now\nsettled--or so much the worse for the others if it wasn't--till the\nevening; in spite of which she should if left to herself be sure to go\nthere. It would keep her quiet and soothe her to sit--he could keep her\nquiet (he was such a blessing that way!) at any time. Therefore she\nwould give him two or three hours--or rather she would herself ask for\nthem--if he didn't positively turn her from the door.\n\nIt had not been definite to Nick that he wanted another sitting at all\nfor the slight work, as he held it to be, that Miriam had already helped\nhim to achieve. He regarded this work as a mere light wind-fall of the\nshaken tree: he had made what he could of it and would have been\nembarrassed to make more. If it was not finished this was because it was\nnot finishable; at any rate he had said all he had to say in that\nparticular phrase. The young man, in truth, was not just now in the\nhighest spirits; his imagination had within two or three days become\nconscious of a check that he tried to explain by the idea of a natural\nreaction. Any decision or violent turn, any need of a new sharp choice\nin one's career, was upsetting, and, exaggerate that importance and\none's own as little as one would, a deal of flurry couldn't help\nattending, especially in the face of so much scandal, the horrid act,\nodious to one's modesty at the best, of changing one's clothes in the\nmarketplace. That made life not at all positively pleasant, yet\ndecidedly thrilling, for the hour; and it was well enough till the\nthrill abated. When this occurred, as it inevitably would, the romance\nand the glow of the adventure were exchanged for the chill and the\nprose. It was to these latter elements he had waked up pretty wide on\nthis particular morning; and the prospect was not appreciably fresher\nfrom the fact that he had warned himself in advance it would be dull. He\nhad in fact known how dull it would be, but now he would have time to\nlearn even better. A reaction was a reaction, but it was not after all a\ncatastrophe. It would be a feature of his very freedom that he should\nask himself if he hadn't made a great mistake; this privilege would\ndoubtless even remain within the limits of its nature in exposing him to\nhours of intimate conviction of his madness. But he would live to\nretract his retractations--this was the first thing to bear in mind.\n\nHe was absorbed, even while he dressed, in the effort to achieve\nintelligibly to himself some such revolution when, by the first post,\nMiriam's note arrived. At first it did little to help his agility--it\nmade him, seeing her esthetic faith as so much stronger and simpler than\nhis own, wonder how he should keep with her at her high level. Ambition,\nin her, was always on the rush, and she was not a person to conceive\nthat others might in bad moments listen for the trumpet in vain. It\nwould never have occurred to her that only the day before he had spent a\npart of the afternoon quite at the bottom of the hill. He had in fact\nturned into the National Gallery and had wandered about there for more\nthan an hour, and it was just while he did so that the immitigable\nrecoil had begun perversely to make itself felt. The perversity was all\nthe greater from the fact that if the experience was depressing this was\nnot because he had been discouraged beyond measure by the sight of the\ngrand things that had been done--things so much grander than any that\nwould ever bear his signature. That variation he was duly acquainted\nwith and should know in abundance again. What had happened to him, as he\npassed on this occasion from Titian to Rubens and from Gainsborough to\nRembrandt, was that he found himself calling the whole exhibited art\ninto question. What was it after all at the best and why had people\ngiven it so high a place? Its weakness, its limits broke upon him;\ntacitly blaspheming he looked with a lustreless eye at the palpable,\npolished, \"toned\" objects designed for suspension on hooks. That is, he\nblasphemed if it were blasphemy to feel that as bearing on the energies\nof man they were a poor and secondary show. The human force producing\nthem was so far from one of the greatest; their place was a small place\nand their connexion with the heroic life casual and slight. They\nrepresented so little great ideas, and it was great ideas that kept the\nworld from chaos. He had incontestably been in much closer relation with\nthem a few months before than he was to-day: it made up a great deal\nfor what was false and hollow, what was merely personal, in \"politics\"\nthat, were the idea greater or smaller, they could at their best so\ndirectly deal with it. The love of it had really been much of the time\nat the bottom of his impulse to follow them up; though this was not what\nhe had most talked of with his political friends or even with Julia. No,\npolitical as Julia was, he had not conferred with her much about the\nidea. However, this might have been his own fault quite as much as hers,\nand she in fact took such things, such enthusiasms, for granted--there\nwas an immense deal in every way that she took for granted. On the other\nhand, he had often put forward this brighter side of the care for the\npublic weal in his discussions with Gabriel Nash, to the end, it is\ntrue, of making that worthy scoff aloud at what he was pleased to term\nhis hypocrisy. Gabriel maintained precisely that there were more ideas,\nmore of those that man lived by, in a single room of the National\nGallery than in all the statutes of Parliament. Nick had replied to this\nmore than once that the determination of what man did live by was\nrequired; to which Nash had retorted (and it was very rarely that he\nquoted Scripture) that it was at any rate not by bread and beans alone.\nThe statutes of Parliament gave him bread and beans _tout au plus_.\n\nNick had at present no pretension of trying this question over again: he\nreminded himself that his ambiguity was subjective, as the philosophers\nsaid; the result of a mood which in due course would be at the mercy of\nanother mood. It made him curse, and cursing, as a finality, lacked\nfirmness--one had to drive in posts somewhere under. The greatest time\nto do one's work was when it didn't seem worth doing, for then one gave\nit a brilliant chance, that of resisting the stiffest test of all--the\ntest of striking one as too bad. To do the most when there would be the\nleast to be got by it was to be most in the spirit of high production.\nOne thing at any rate was certain, Nick reflected: nothing on earth\nwould induce him to change back again--not even if this twilight of the\nsoul should last for the rest of his days. He hardened himself in his\nposture with a good conscience which, had they had a glimpse of it,\nwould have made him still more diverting to those who already thought\nhim so; and now, by a happy chance, Miriam suddenly supplied the bridge\ncorrecting the gap in his continuity. If he had made his sketch it was a\nproof he had done her, and that he had done her flashed upon him as a\nsign that she would be still more feasible. Art was _doing_--it came\nback to that--which politics in most cases weren't. He thus, to pursue\nour image, planted his supports in the dimness beneath all cursing, and\non the platform so improvised was able, in his relief, to dance. He sent\nout a telegram to Balaklava Place requesting his beautiful sitter by no\nmanner of means to fail him. When his servant came back it was to usher\ninto the studio Peter Sherringham, whom the man had apparently found at\nthe door.\n\nThe hour was so early for general commerce that Nick immediately guessed\nhis visitor had come on some rare errand; but this inference yielded to\nthe reflexion that Peter might after all only wish to make up by present\nzeal for not having been near him before. He forgot that, as he had\nsubsequently learned from Biddy, their foreign, or all but foreign,\ncousin had spent an hour in Rosedale Road, missing him there but pulling\nout Miriam's portrait, the day of his own last visit to Beauclere. These\nyoung men were not on a ceremonious footing and it was not in Nick's\nnature to keep a record of civilities rendered or omitted; nevertheless\nhe had been vaguely conscious that during a stay in London elastic\nenough on Peter's part he and his kinsman had foregathered less than of\nyore. It was indeed an absorbing moment in the career of each, but even\nwhile recognising such a truth Nick judged it not impossible that\nJulia's brother might have taken upon himself to resent some\nsuppositions failure of consideration for that lady; though this indeed\nwould have been stupid and the newly appointed minister (to he had\nforgotten where) didn't often make mistakes. Nick held that as he had\ntreated Julia with studious generosity she had nothing whatever to visit\non him--wherefore Peter had still less. It was at any rate none of that\ngentleman's business. There were only two abatements to disposing in a\nfew frank words of all this: one of them Nick's general hatred of\ntalking of his private affairs (a reluctance in which he and Peter were\nwell matched); and the other a truth involving more of a confession--the\nsubtle truth that the most definite and even most soothing result of the\ncollapse of his engagement was, as happened, an unprecedented\nconsciousness of freedom. Nick's observation was of a different sort\nfrom his cousin's; he noted much less the signs of the hour and kept\nthroughout a looser register of life; nevertheless, just as one of our\nyoung men had during these days in London found the air peopled with\npersonal influences, the concussion of human atoms, so the other, though\nonly asking to live without too many questions and work without too many\nrubs, to be glad and sorry in short on easy terms, had become aware of a\ncertain social tightness, of the fact that life is crowded and passion\nrestless, accident and community inevitable. Everybody with whom one had\nrelations had other relations too, and even indifference was a mixture\nand detachment a compromise. The only wisdom was to consent to the\nloss, if necessary, of everything but one's temper and to the ruin, if\nnecessary, of everything but one's work. It must be added that Peter's\nrelative took precautions against irritation perhaps in excess of the\ndanger, as departing travellers about to whiz through foreign countries\nmouth in phrase-books combinations of words they will never use. He was\nat home in clear air and disliked to struggle either for breath or for\nlight. He had a dim sense that Peter felt some discomfort from him and\nmight have come now to tell him so; in which case he should be sorry for\nthe sufferer in various ways. But as soon as that aspirant began to\nspeak suspicion reverted to mere ancient kindness, and this in spite\nof the fact that his speech had a slightly exaggerated promptitude,\nlike the promptitude of business, which might have denoted\nself-consciousness. To Nick it quickly appeared better to be glad than\nto be sorry: this simple argument was more than sufficient to make him\nglad Peter was there.\n\n\"My dear fellow, it's an unpardonable hour, isn't it? I wasn't even sure\nyou'd be up, yet had to risk it, because my hours are numbered. I'm\ngoing away to-morrow,\" Peter went on; \"I've a thousand things to do.\nI've had no talk with you this time such as we used to have of old (it's\nan irreparable loss, but it's your fault, you know), and as I've got to\nrush about all day I thought I'd just catch you before any one else\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Some one has already caught me, but there's plenty of time,\" Nick\nreturned.\n\nPeter all but asked a question--it fell short. \"I see, I see. I'm sorry\nto say I've only a few minutes at best.\"\n\n\"Man of crushing responsibilities, you've come to humiliate me!\" his\ncompanion cried. \"I know all about it.\"\n\n\"It's more than I do then. That's not what I've come for, but I shall be\ndelighted if I humiliate you a little by the way. I've two things in\nmind, and I'll mention the most difficult first. I came here the other\nday--the day after my arrival in town.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, so you did; it was very good of you\"--Nick remembered. \"I ought\nto have returned your visit or left a card or written my name--to have\ndone something in Great Stanhope Street, oughtn't I? You hadn't got this\nnew thing then, or I'd have 'called.'\"\n\nPeter eyed him a moment. \"I say, what's the matter with you? Am I really\nunforgivable for having taken that liberty?\"\n\n\"What liberty?\" Nick looked now quite innocent of care, and indeed his\nvisitor's allusion was not promptly clear. He was thinking for the\ninstant all of Biddy, of whom and whose secret inclinations Grace had\ninsisted on talking to him. They were none of his business, and if he\nwouldn't for the world have let the girl herself suspect he had violent\nlights on what was most screened and curtained in her, much less would\nhe have made Peter a clumsy present of this knowledge. Grace had a queer\ntheory that Peter treated Biddy badly--treated them all somehow badly;\nbut Grace's zeal (she had plenty of it, though she affected all sorts of\nfine indifference) almost always took the form of her being unusually\nwrong. Nick wanted to do only what Biddy would thank him for, and he\nknew very well what she wouldn't. She wished him and Peter to be great\nfriends, and the only obstacle to this was that Peter was too much of a\ndiplomatist. Peter made him for an instant think of her and of the hour\nthey had lately spent together in the studio in his absence--an hour of\nwhich Biddy had given him a history full of items and omissions; and\nthis in turn brought Nick's imagination back to his visitor's own side\nof the matter. That general human complexity of which the sense had\nlately increased with him, and to which it was owing that any thread one\nmight take hold of would probably be the extremely wrong end of\nsomething, was illustrated by the fact that while poor Biddy was\nthinking of Peter it was ten to one poor Peter was thinking of Miriam\nRooth. All of which danced before Nick's intellectual vision for a space\nbriefer than my too numerous words.\n\n\"I pitched into your treasures--I rummaged among your canvases,\" Peter\nsaid. \"Biddy had nothing whatever to do with it--she maintained an\nattitude of irreproachable reserve. It has been on my conscience all\nthese days and I ought to have done penance before. I've been putting it\noff partly because I'm so ashamed of my indiscretion. _Que voulez-vous_,\nmy dear chap? My provocation was great. I heard you had been painting\nMiss Rooth, so that I couldn't restrain my curiosity. I simply went into\nthat corner and struck out there--a trifle wildly no doubt. I dragged\nthe young lady to the light--your sister turned pale as she saw me. It\nwas a good deal like breaking open one of your letters, wasn't it?\nHowever, I assure you it's all right, for I congratulate you both on\nyour style and on your correspondent.\"\n\n\"You're as clever, as witty, as humorous as ever, old boy,\" Nick\npronounced, going himself into the corner designated by his companion\nand laying his hands on the same canvas. \"Your curiosity's the highest\npossible tribute to my little attempt and your sympathy sets me right\nwith myself. There she is again,\" Nick went on, thrusting the picture\ninto an empty frame; \"you shall see her whether you wish to or not.\"\n\n\"Right with yourself? You don't mean to say you've been wrong!\" Peter\nreturned, standing opposite the portrait.\n\n\"Oh I don't know. I've been kicking up such a row. Anything's better\nthan a row.\"\n\n\"She's awfully good--she's awfully true,\" said Peter. \"You've done more\nto her since the other day. You've put in several things.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I've worked distractedly. I've not altogether conformed to the\ngood rule about being off with the old love.\"\n\n\"With the old love?\"--and the visitor looked hard at the picture.\n\n\"Before you're on with the new!\" Nick had no sooner uttered these words\nthan he coloured: it occurred to him his friend would probably infer an\nallusion to Julia. He therefore added quickly: \"It isn't so easy to\ncease to represent an affectionate constituency. Really most of my time\nfor a fortnight has been given to letter-writing. They've all been\nunexpectedly charming. I should have thought they'd have loathed and\ndespised me. But not a bit of it; they cling to me fondly--they struggle\nwith me tenderly. I've been down to talk with them about it, and we've\npassed the most sociable, delightful hours. I've designated my\nsuccessor; I've felt a good deal like the Emperor Charles the Fifth when\nabout to retire to the monastery of Yuste. The more I've seen of them in\nthis way the more I've liked them, and they declare it has been the same\nwith themselves about me. We spend our time assuring each other we\nhadn't begun to know each other till now. In short it's all wonderfully\njolly, but it isn't business. _C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la\nguerre_.\"\n\n\"They're not so charming as they might be if they don't offer to keep\nyou and let you paint.\"\n\n\"They do, almost--it's fantastic,\" said Nick. \"Remember they haven't\nyet seen a daub of my brush.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry for you; we live in too enlightened an age,\" Peter\nreturned. \"You can't suffer for art--that grand romance is over. Your\nexperience is interesting; it seems to show that at the tremendous pitch\nof civilisation we've reached you can't suffer from anything but\nhunger.\"\n\n\"I shall doubtless,\" Nick allowed, \"do that enough to make up for the\nrest.\"\n\n\"Never, never, when you paint so well as this.\"\n\n\"Oh come, you're too good to be true,\" Nick said. \"But where did you\nlearn that one's larder's full in proportion as one's work's fine?\"\n\nPeter waived this curious point--he only continued to look at the\npicture; after which he roundly brought out: \"I'll give you your price\nfor it on the spot.\"\n\n\"Ah you're so magnanimous that you shall have it for nothing!\" And Nick,\ntouched to gratitude, passed his arm into his visitor's.\n\nPeter had a pause. \"Why do you call me magnanimous?\"\n\n\"Oh bless my soul, it's hers--I forgot!\" laughed Nick, failing in his\nturn to answer the other's inquiry. \"But you shall have another.\"\n\n\"Another? Are you going to do another?\"\n\n\"This very morning. That is, I shall begin it. I've heard from her;\nshe's coming to sit--a short time hence.\"\n\nPeter turned away a little at this, releasing himself, and, as if the\nmovement had been an effect of his host's words, looked at his watch\nearnestly to dissipate that appearance. He fell back to consider the\nwork from further off. \"The more you do her the better--she has all the\nqualities of a great model. From that point of view it's a pity she has\nanother trade: she might make so good a thing of this one. But how\nshall you do her again?\" he asked ingenuously.\n\n\"Oh I can scarcely say; we'll arrange something; we'll talk it over.\nIt's extraordinary how well she enters into what one wants: she knows\nmore than one does one's self. She isn't, as you Frenchmen say, the\nfirst comer. However, you know all about that, since you invented her,\ndidn't you? That's what she says; she's awfully sweet on you,\" Nick\nkindly pursued. \"What I ought to do is to try something as different as\npossible from that thing; not the sibyl, the muse, the tremendous\ncreature, but the charming woman, the person one knows, differently\narranged as she appears _en ville_, she calls it. I'll do something\nreally serious and send it to you out there with my respects. It will\nremind you of home and perhaps a little even of me. If she knows it's\nfor you she'll throw herself into it in the right spirit. Leave it to\nus, my dear fellow; we'll turn out something splendid.\"\n\n\"It's jolly to hear you, but I shall send you a cheque,\" said Peter very\nstoutly.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right in your position, but you're too proud,\" his\nkinsman answered.\n\n\"What do you mean by my position?\"\n\n\"Your exaltation, your high connexion with the country, your treating\nwith sovereign powers as the representative of a sovereign power. Isn't\nthat what they call 'em?\"\n\nPeter, who had turned round again, listened to this with his eyes fixed\non Nick's face while he once more drew forth his watch. \"Brute!\" he\nexclaimed familiarly, at the same time dropping his eyes on the watch.\n\"When did you say you expect your sitter?\"\n\n\"Oh we've plenty of time; don't be afraid of letting me see you agitated\nby her presence.\"\n\n\"Brute!\" Peter again ejaculated.\n\nThis friendly personal note cleared the air, made their communication\ncloser. \"Stay with me and talk to me,\" said Nick; \"I daresay it's good\nfor me. It may be the last time I shall see you without having before\nanything else to koo-too.\"\n\n\"Beast!\" his kinsman once more, and a little helplessly, threw off;\nthough next going on: \"Haven't you something more to show me then--some\nother fruit of your genius?\"\n\n\"Must I bribe you by setting my sign-boards in a row? You know what I've\ndone; by which I mean of course you know what I haven't. My genius, as\nyou're so good as to call it, has hitherto been dreadfully sterile. I've\nhad no time, no opportunity, no continuity. I must go and sit down in a\ncorner and learn my alphabet. That thing isn't good; what I shall do for\nyou won't be good. Don't protest, my dear fellow; nothing will be fit to\nlook at for a long time.\" After which poor Nick wound up: \"And think of\nmy ridiculous age! As the good people say (or don't they say it?), it's\na rum go. It won't be amusing.\"\n\n\"Ah you're so clever you'll get on fast,\" Peter returned, trying to\nthink how he could most richly defy the injunction not to protest.\n\n\"I mean it won't be amusing for others,\" said Nick, unperturbed by this\nlevity. \"They want results, and small blame to them.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever you do, don't talk like Mr. Gabriel Nash,\" Peter went\non. \"Sometimes I think you're just going to.\"\n\nNick stared a moment. \"Ah he never would have said _that_ 'They want\nresults, the damned asses'--that would have been more in his key.\"\n\n\"It's the difference of a _nuance_! And are you extraordinarily happy?\"\nPeter added as his host now obliged him by arranging half-a-dozen\ncanvases so that he could look at them.\n\n\"Not so much so, doubtless, as the artistic life ought to make one:\nbecause all one's people are not so infatuated as one's electors. But\nlittle by little I'm learning the charm of pig-headedness.\"\n\n\"Your mother's very bad,\" Peter allowed--\"I lunched with her day before\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, I know\"--Nick had such reason to know; \"but it's too late,\ntoo late. I must just peg away here and not mind. I've after all a great\nadvantage in my life.\"\n\nHis companion waited impartially to hear. \"And that would be--?\"\n\n\"Well, knowing what I want to do. That's everything, you know.\"\n\n\"It's an advantage, however, that you've only just come in for, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the delay and the probation only make me prize it the more.\nI've got it now; and it makes up for the absence of some other things.\"\n\nAgain Peter had a pause. \"That sounds a little flat,\" he remarked at\nlast.\n\n\"It depends on what you compare it with. It has more point than I\nsometimes found in the House of Commons.\"\n\n\"Oh I never thought I should like that!\"\n\nThere was another drop during which Nick moved about the room turning up\nold sketches to see if he had anything more to show, while his visitor\ncontinued to look at the unfinished and in some cases, as seemed,\nunpromising productions already exposed. They were far less interesting\nthan the portrait of Miriam Rooth and, it would have appeared, less\nsignificant of ability. For that particular effort Nick's talent had\ntaken an inspired flight. So much Peter thought, as he had thought it\nintensely before; but the words he presently uttered had no visible\nconnexion with it. They only consisted of the abrupt inquiry; \"Have you\nheard anything from Julia?\"\n\n\"Not a syllable. Have you?\"\n\n\"Dear no; she never writes to me.\"\n\n\"But won't she on the occasion of your promotion?\"\n\n\"I daresay not,\" said Peter; and this was the only reference to Mrs.\nDallow that passed between her brother and her late intended. It left a\nslight stir of the air which Peter proceeded to allay by an allusion\ncomparatively speaking more relevant. He expressed disappointment that\nBiddy shouldn't have come in, having had an idea she was always in\nRosedale Road of a morning. That was the other branch of his present\nerrand--the wish to see her and give her a message for Lady Agnes, upon\nwhom, at so early an hour, he had not presumed to intrude in Calcutta\nGardens. Nick replied that Biddy did in point of fact almost always turn\nup, and for the most part early: she came to wish him good-morning and\nstart him for the day. She was a devoted Electra, laying a cool, healing\nhand on a distracted, perspiring Orestes. He reminded Peter, however,\nthat he would have a chance of seeing her that evening, and of seeing\nLady Agnes; for wasn't he to do them the honour of dining in Calcutta\nGardens? Biddy, the day before, had arrived full of that excitement.\nPeter explained that this was exactly the sad subject of his actual\n_d\u00c3\u00a9marche_: the project of the dinner in Calcutta Gardens had, to his\nexceeding regret, fallen to pieces. The fact was (didn't Nick know it?)\nthe night had been suddenly and perversely fixed for Miriam's premi\u00c3\u00a8re,\nand he was under a definite engagement with her not to stay away from\nit. To add to the bore of the thing he was obliged to return to Paris\nthe very next morning. He was quite awfully sorry, for he had promised\nLady Agnes: he didn't understand then about Miriam's affair, in regard\nto which he had given a previous pledge. He was more grieved than he\ncould say, but he could never fail Miss Rooth: he had professed from the\nfirst an interest in her which he must live up to a little more. This\nwas his last chance--he hadn't been near her at the trying time of her\nfirst braving of the public. And the second night of the play wouldn't\ndo--it must be the first or nothing. Besides, he couldn't wait over till\nMonday.\n\nWhile Peter recited all his hindrance Nick was occupied in rubbing with\na cloth a palette he had just scraped. \"I see what you mean--I'm very\nsorry too. I'm sorry you can't give my mother this joy--I give her so\nlittle.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you might give her a little more!\" it came to Peter to\nsay. \"It's rather too much to expect _me_ to make up for your\nomissions!\"\n\nNick looked at him with a moment's fixedness while he polished the\npalette; and for that moment he felt the temptation to reply: \"There's a\nway you could do that, to a considerable extent--I think you guess\nit--which wouldn't be intrinsically disagreeable.\" But the impulse\npassed without expressing itself in speech, and he simply brought out;\n\"You can make this all clear to Biddy when she comes, and she'll make it\nclear to my mother.\"\n\n\"Poor little Biddy!\" Peter mentally sighed, thinking of the girl with\nthat job before her; but what he articulated was that this was exactly\nwhy he had come to the studio. He had inflicted his company on Lady\nAgnes the previous Thursday and had partaken of a meal with her, but had\nnot seen Biddy though he had waited for her, had hoped immensely she'd\ncome in. Now he'd wait again--dear Bid was thoroughly worth it.\n\n\"Patience, patience then--you've always me!\" said Nick; to which he\nsubjoined: \"If it's a question of going to the play I scarcely see why\nyou shouldn't dine at my mother's all the same. People go to the play\nafter dinner.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it wouldn't be fair, it wouldn't be decent: it's a case when I\nmust be in my seat from the rise of the curtain.\" Peter, about this, was\nthoroughly lucid. \"I should force your mother to dine an hour earlier\nthan usual and then in return for her courtesy should go off to my\nentertainment at eight o'clock, leaving her and Grace and Biddy\nlanguishing there. I wish I had proposed in time that they should go\nwith me,\" he continued not very ingenuously.\n\n\"You might do that still,\" Nick suggested.\n\n\"Oh at this time of day it would be impossible to get a box.\"\n\n\"I'll speak to Miss Rooth about it if you like when she comes,\" smiled\nNick.\n\n\"No, it wouldn't do,\" said Peter, turning away and looking once more at\nhis watch. He made tacitly the addition that still less than asking Lady\nAgnes for his convenience to dine early would _this_ be decent, would it\nbe thinkable. His taking Biddy the night he dined with her and with Miss\nTressilian had been something very like a violation of those\nproprieties. He couldn't say that, however, to the girl's brother, who\nremarked in a moment that it was all right, since Peter's action left\nhim his own freedom.\n\n\"Your own freedom?\"--and Peter's question made him turn.\n\n\"Why you see now I can go to the theatre myself.\"\n\n\"Certainly; I hadn't thought of that. You'd naturally have been going.\"\n\n\"I gave it up for the prospect of your company at home.\"\n\n\"Upon my word you're too good--I don't deserve such sacrifices,\" said\nPeter, who read in his kinsman's face that this was not a figure of\nspeech but the absolute truth. \"Didn't it, however, occur to you that,\nas it would turn out, I might--I even naturally _would_--myself be\ngoing?\" he put forth.\n\nNick broke into a laugh. \"It would have occurred to me if I understood a\nlittle better--!\" But he paused, as still too amused.\n\n\"If you understood a little better what?\"\n\n\"Your situation, simply.\"\n\nPeter looked at him a moment. \"Dine with me to-night by ourselves and at\na club. We'll go to the theatre together and then you'll understand it.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, with pleasure: we'll have a jolly evening,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Call it jolly if you like. When did you say she was coming?\" Peter\nasked.\n\n\"Biddy? Oh probably, as I tell you, at any moment.\"\n\n\"I mean the great Miriam,\" Peter amended.\n\n\"The great Miriam, if she's punctual, will be here in about forty\nminutes.\"\n\n\"And will she be likely to find your sister?\"\n\n\"That will depend, my dear fellow, on whether my sister remains to see\nher.\"\n\n\"Exactly; but the point's whether you'll allow her to remain, isn't it?\"\n\nNick looked slightly mystified. \"Why shouldn't she do as she likes?\"\n\n\"In that case she'll probably go.\"\n\n\"Yes, unless she stays.\"\n\n\"Don't let her,\" Peter dropped; \"send her away.\" And to explain this he\nadded: \"It doesn't seem exactly the right sort of thing, fresh young\ncreatures like Bid meeting _des femmes de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_.\" His explanation, in\nturn, struck him as requiring another clause; so he went on: \"At least\nit isn't thought the right sort of thing abroad, and even in England my\nforeign ideas stick to me.\"\n\nEven with this amplification, however, his plea evidently still had for\nhis companion a flaw; which, after he had considered it a moment, Nick\nexposed in the simple words: \"Why, you originally introduced them in\nParis, Biddy and Miss Rooth. Didn't they meet at your rooms and\nfraternise, and wasn't that much more 'abroad' than this?\"\n\n\"So they did, but my hand had been forced and she didn't like it,\" Peter\nanswered, suspecting that for a diplomatist he looked foolish.\n\n\"Miss Rooth didn't like it?\" Nick persisted.\n\n\"That I confess I've forgotten. Besides, she wasn't an actress then.\nWhat I mean is that Biddy wasn't particularly pleased with her.\"\n\n\"Why she thought her wonderful--praised her to the sides. I remember\nthat.\"\n\n\"She didn't like her as a woman; she praised her as an actress.\"\n\n\"I thought you said she wasn't an actress then,\" Nick returned.\n\nPeter had a pause. \"Oh Biddy thought so. She has seen her since,\nmoreover. I took her the other night, and her curiosity's satisfied.\"\n\n\"It's not of any consequence, and if there's a reason for it I'll bundle\nher off directly,\" Nick made haste to say. \"But the great Miriam seems\nsuch a kind, good person.\"\n\n\"So she is, charming, charming,\"--and his visitor looked hard at him.\n\n\"Here comes Biddy now,\" Nick went on. \"I hear her at the door: you can\nwarn her yourself.\"\n\n\"It isn't a question of 'warning'--that's not in the least my idea. But\nI'll take Biddy away,\" said Peter.\n\n\"That will be still more energetic.\"\n\n\"No, it will be simply more selfish--I like her company.\" Peter had\nturned as if to go to the door and meet the girl; but he quickly checked\nhimself, lingering in the middle of the room, and the next instant Biddy\nhad come in. When she saw him there she also stopped.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\n\n\"Come on boldly, my dear,\" said Nick. \"Peter's bored to death waiting\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Ah he's come to say he won't dine with us to-night!\" Biddy stood with\nher hand on the latch.\n\n\"I leave town to-morrow: I've everything to do; I'm broken-hearted; it's\nimpossible\"--Peter made of it again such a case as he could. \"Please\nmake my peace with your mother--I'm ashamed of not having written to her\nlast night.\"\n\nShe closed the door and came in while her brother said to her, \"How in\nthe world did you guess it?\"\n\n\"I saw it in the _Morning Post_.\" And she kept her eyes on their\nkinsman.\n\n\"In the _Morning Post_?\" he vaguely echoed.\n\n\"I saw there's to be a first night at that theatre, the one you took us\nto. So I said, 'Oh he'll go there.'\"\n\n\"Yes, I've got to do that too,\" Peter admitted.\n\n\"She's going to sit to me again this morning, his wonderful actress--she\nhas made an appointment: so you see I'm getting on,\" Nick pursued to his\nsister.\n\n\"Oh I'm so glad--she's so splendid!\" The girl looked away from her\ncousin now, but not, though it seemed to fill the place, at the\ntriumphant portrait of Miriam Rooth.\n\n\"I'm delighted you've come in. I _have_ waited for you,\" Peter hastened\nto declare to her, though conscious that this was in the conditions\nmeagre.\n\n\"Aren't you coming to see us again?\"\n\n\"I'm in despair, but I shall really not have time. Therefore it's a\nblessing not to have missed you here.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad,\" said Biddy. Then she added: \"And you're going to\nAmerica--to stay a long time?\"\n\n\"Till I'm sent to some better place.\"\n\n\"And will that better place be as far away?\"\n\n\"Oh Biddy, it wouldn't be better then,\" said Peter.\n\n\"Do you mean they'll give you something to do at home?\"\n\n\"Hardly that. But I've a tremendous lot to do at home to-day.\" For the\ntwentieth time Peter referred to his watch.\n\nShe turned to her brother, who had admonished her that she might bid him\ngood-morning. She kissed him and he asked what the news would be in\nCalcutta Gardens; to which she made answer: \"The only news is of course\nthe great preparations they're making, poor dears, for Peter. Mamma\nthinks you must have had such a nasty dinner the other day,\" the girl\ncontinued to the guest of that romantic occasion.\n\n\"Faithless Peter!\" said Nick, beginning to whistle and to arrange a\ncanvas in anticipation of Miriam's arrival.\n\n\"Dear Biddy, thank your stars you're not in my horrid profession,\"\nprotested the personage so designated. \"One's bowled about like a\ncricket-ball, unable to answer for one's freedom or one's comfort from\none moment to another.\"\n\n\"Oh ours is the true profession--Biddy's and mine,\" Nick broke out,\nsetting up his canvas; \"the career of liberty and peace, of charming\nlong mornings spent in a still north light and in the contemplation, I\nmay even say in the company, of the amiable and the beautiful.\"\n\n\"That certainty's the case when Biddy comes to see you,\" Peter returned.\n\nBiddy smiled at him. \"I come every day. Anch'io son pittore! I encourage\nNick awfully.\"\n\n\"It's a pity I'm not a martyr--she'd bravely perish with me,\" Nick said.\n\n\"You are--you're a martyr--when people say such odious things!\" the girl\ncried. \"They do say them. I've heard many more than I've repeated to\nyou.\"\n\n\"It's you yourself then, indignant and loyal, who are the martyr,\"\nobserved Peter, who wanted greatly to be kind to her.\n\n\"Oh I don't care!\"--but she threw herself, flushed and charming, into a\nstraight appeal to him. \"Don't you think one can do as much good by\npainting great works of art as by--as by what papa used to do? Don't you\nthink art's necessary to the happiness, to the greatness of a people?\nDon't you think it's manly and honourable? Do you think a passion for\nit's a thing to be ashamed of? Don't you think the artist--the\nconscientious, the serious one--is as distinguished a member of society\nas any one else?\"\n\nPeter and Nick looked at each other and laughed at the way she had got\nup her subject, and Nick asked their kinsman if she didn't express it\nall in perfection. \"I delight in general in artists, but I delight still\nmore in their defenders,\" Peter made reply, perhaps a little meagrely,\nto Biddy.\n\n\"Ah don't attack me if you're wise!\" Nick said.\n\n\"One's tempted to when it makes Biddy so fine.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the way she encourages me: it's meat and drink to me,\"\nNick went on. \"At the same time I'm bound to say there's a little\nwhistling in the dark in it.\"\n\n\"In the dark?\" his sister demanded.\n\n\"The obscurity, my dear child, of your own aspirations, your mysterious\nambitions and esthetic views. Aren't there some heavyish shadows there?\"\n\n\"Why I never cared for politics.\"\n\n\"No, but you cared for life, you cared for society, and you've chosen\nthe path of solitude and concentration.\"\n\n\"You horrid boy!\" said Biddy.\n\n\"Give it up, that arduous steep--give it up and come out with me,\" Peter\ninterposed.\n\n\"Come out with you?\"\n\n\"Let us walk a little or even drive a little. Let us at any rate talk a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"I thought you had so much to do,\" Biddy candidly objected.\n\n\"So I have, but why shouldn't you do a part of it with me? Would there\nbe any harm? I'm going to some tiresome shops--you'll cheer the frugal\nhour.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated, then turned to Nick. \"Would there be any harm?\"\n\n\"Oh it's none of _his_ business!\" Peter protested.\n\n\"He had better take you home to your mother.\"\n\n\"I'm going home--I shan't stay here to-day,\" Biddy went on. Then to\nPeter: \"I came in a hansom, but I shall walk back. Come that way with\nme.\"\n\n\"With pleasure. But I shall not be able to go in,\" Peter added.\n\n\"Oh that's no matter,\" said the girl. \"Good-bye, Nick.\"\n\n\"You understand then that we dine together--at seven sharp. Wouldn't a\nclub, as I say, be best?\" Peter, before going, inquired of Nick. He\nsuggested further which club it should be; and his words led Biddy, who\nhad directed her steps toward the door, to turn a moment as with a\nreproachful question--whether it was for this Peter had given up\nCalcutta Gardens. But her impulse, if impulse it was, had no sequel\nsave so far as it was a sequel that Peter freely explained to her, after\nNick had assented to his conditions, that her brother too had a desire\nto go to Miss Rooth's first night and had already promised to accompany\nhim.\n\n\"Oh that's perfect; it will be so good for him--won't it?--if he's going\nto paint her again,\" Biddy responded.\n\n\"I think there's nothing so good for him as that he happens to have such\na sister as you,\" Peter declared as they went out. He heard at the same\ntime the sound of a carriage stopping, and before Biddy, who was in\nfront of him, opened the door of the house had been able to say to\nhimself, \"What a bore--there's Miriam!\" The opened door showed him that\ntruth--this young lady in the act of alighting from the brougham\nprovided by Basil Dashwood's thrifty zeal. Her mother followed her, and\nboth the new visitors exclaimed and rejoiced, in their demonstrative\nway, as their eyes fell on their valued friend. The door had closed\nbehind Peter, but he instantly and violently rang, so that they should\nbe admitted with as little delay as possible, while he stood\ndisconcerted, and fearing he showed it, by the prompt occurrence of an\nencounter he had particularly sought to avert. It ministered, moreover,\na little to this sensibility that Miriam appeared to have come somewhat\nbefore her time. The incident promised, however, to pass off in a fine\nflorid way. Before he knew it both the ladies had taken possession of\nBiddy, who looked at them with comparative coldness, tempered indeed by\na faint glow of apprehension, and Miriam had broken out:\n\n\"We know you, we know you; we saw you in Paris, and you came to my\ntheatre a short time ago with Mr. Sherringham!\"\n\n\"We know your mother, Lady Agnes Dormer. I hope her ladyship's very\nwell,\" said Mrs. Rooth, who had never struck Peter as a more\nobjectionable old woman.\n\n\"You offered to do a head of me or something or other: didn't you tell\nme you work in clay? I daresay you've forgotten all about it, but I\nshould be delighted,\" Miriam pursued with the richest urbanity. Peter\nwas not concerned with her mother's pervasiveness, though he didn't like\nBiddy to see even that; but he hoped his companion would take the\novercharged benevolence of the young actress in the spirit in which,\nrather to his surprise, it evidently was offered. \"I've sat to your\nclever brother many times,\" said Miriam; \"I'm going to sit again. I\ndaresay you've seen what we've done--he's too delightful. _Si vous\nsaviez comme cela me repose_!\" she added, turning for a moment to Peter.\nThen she continued, smiling at Biddy; \"Only he oughtn't to have thrown\nup such prospects, you know. I've an idea I wasn't nice to you that day\nin Paris--I was nervous and scared and perverse. I remember perfectly; I\n_was_ odious. But I'm better now--you'd see if you were to know me. I'm\nnot a bad sort--really I'm not. But you must have your own friends.\nHappy they--you look so charming! Immensely like Mr. Dormer, especially\nabout the eyes; isn't she, mamma?\"\n\n\"She comes of a beautiful Norman race--the finest, purest strain,\" the\nold woman simpered. \"Mr. Dormer's sometimes so good as to come and see\nus--we're always at home on Sunday; and if some day you found courage to\ncome with him you might perhaps find it pleasant, though very different\nof course from the circle in which you habitually move.\"\n\nBiddy murmured a vague recognition of these wonderful civilities, and\nMiriam commented: \"Different, yes; but we're all right, you know. Do\ncome,\" she added. Then turning to Sherringham: \"Remember what I told\nyou--I don't expect you to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh I understand; I shall come,\"--and Peter knew he grew red.\n\n\"It will be idiotic. Keep him, keep him away--don't let him,\" Miriam\ninsisted to Biddy; with which, as Nick's portals now were gaping, she\ndrew her mother away.\n\nPeter, at this, walked off briskly with Biddy, dropping as he did so:\n\"She's too fantastic!\"\n\n\"Yes, but so tremendously good-looking. I shall ask Nick to take me\nthere,\" the girl said after a moment.\n\n\"Well, she'll do you no harm. They're all right, as she says. It's the\nworld of art--you were standing up so for art just now.\"\n\n\"Oh I wasn't thinking so much of that kind,\" she demurred.\n\n\"There's only one kind--it's all the same thing. If one sort's good the\nother is.\"\n\nBiddy walked along a moment. \"Is she serious? Is she conscientious?\"\n\n\"She has the makings of a great artist,\" Peter opined.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you think a woman can be one.\"\n\n\"In that line there has never been any doubt about it.\"\n\n\"And only in that line?\"\n\n\"I mean on the stage in general, dramatic or lyric. It's as the actress\nthat the woman produces the most complete and satisfactory artistic\nresults.\"\n\n\"And only as the actress?\"\n\nHe weighed it. \"Yes, there's another art in which she's not bad.\"\n\n\"Which one do you mean?\" asked Biddy.\n\n\"That of being charming and good, that of being indispensable to man.\"\n\n\"Oh that isn't an art.\"\n\n\"Then you leave her only the stage. Take it if you like in the widest\nsense.\"\n\nBiddy appeared to reflect a moment, as to judge what sense this might\nbe. But she found none that was wide enough, for she cried the next\nminute: \"Do you mean to say there's nothing for a woman but to be an\nactress?\"\n\n\"Never in my life. I only say that that's the best thing for a woman to\nbe who finds herself irresistibly carried into the practice of the arts;\nfor there her capacity for them has most application and her incapacity\nfor them least. But at the same time I strongly recommend her not to be\nan artist if she can possibly help it. It's a devil of a life.\"\n\n\"Oh I know; men want women not to be anything.\"\n\n\"It's a poor little refuge they try to take from the overwhelming\nconsciousness that you're in very fact everything.\"\n\n\"Everything?\" And the girl gave a toss. \"That's the kind of thing you\nsay to keep us quiet.\"\n\n\"Dear Biddy, you see how well we succeed!\" laughed Peter.\n\nTo which she replied by asking irrelevantly: \"Why is it so necessary for\nyou to go to the theatre to-night if Miss Rooth doesn't want you to?\"\n\n\"My dear child, she does want me to. But that has nothing to do with\nit.\"\n\n\"Why then did she say that she doesn't?\"\n\n\"Oh because she meant just the contrary.\"\n\n\"Is she so false then--is she so vulgar?\"\n\n\"She speaks a special language; practically it isn't false, because it\nrenders her thought and those who know her understand it.\"\n\n\"But she doesn't use it only to those who know her,\" Biddy returned,\n\"since she asked me, who have so little the honour of her acquaintance,\nto keep you away to-night. How am I to know that she meant by that that\nI'm to urge you on to go?\"\n\nHe was on the point of replying, \"Because you've my word for it\"; but he\nshrank in fact from giving his word--he had some fine scruples--and\nsought to relieve his embarrassment by a general tribute. \"Dear Biddy,\nyou're delightfully acute: you're quite as clever as Miss Rooth.\" He\nfelt, however, that this was scarcely adequate and he continued: \"The\ntruth is that its being important for me to go is a matter quite\nindependent of that young lady's wishing it or not wishing it. There\nhappens to be a definite intrinsic propriety in it which determines the\nthing and which it would take me long to explain.\"\n\n\"I see. But fancy your 'explaining' to me: you make me feel so\nindiscreet!\" the girl cried quickly--an exclamation which touched him\nbecause he was not aware that, quick as it had been, she had still had\ntime to be struck first--though she wouldn't for the world have\nexpressed it--with the oddity of such a duty at such a season. In fact\nthat oddity, during a silence of some minutes, came back to Peter\nhimself: the note had been forced--it sounded almost ignobly frivolous\nfrom a man on the eve of proceeding to a high diplomatic post. The\neffect of this, none the less, was not to make him break out with \"Hang\nit, I _will_ keep my engagement to your mother!\" but to fill him with\nthe wish to shorten his present strain by taking Biddy the rest of the\nway in a cab. He was uncomfortable, and there were hansoms about that he\nlooked at wistfully. While he was so occupied his companion took up the\ntalk by an abrupt appeal.\n\n\"Why did she say that Nick oughtn't to have resigned his seat?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't know. It struck her so. It doesn't matter much.\"\n\nBut Biddy kept it up. \"If she's an artist herself why doesn't she like\npeople to go in for art, especially when Nick has given his time to\npainting her so beautifully? Why does she come there so often if she\ndisapproves of what he has done?\"\n\n\"Oh Miriam's disapproval--it doesn't count; it's a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"Of speaking untruths, do you mean? Does she think just the reverse--is\nthat the way she talks about everything?\"\n\n\"We always admire most what we can do least,\" Peter brought forth; \"and\nMiriam of course isn't political. She ranks painters more or less with\nher own profession, about which already, new as she is to it, she has no\nillusions. They're all artists; it's the same general sort of thing. She\nprefers men of the world--men of action.\"\n\n\"Is that the reason she likes you?\" Biddy mildly mocked.\n\n\"Ah she doesn't like me--couldn't you see it?\"\n\nThe girl at first said nothing; then she asked: \"Is that why she lets\nyou call her 'Miriam'?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't, to her face.\"\n\n\"Ah only to mine!\" laughed Biddy.\n\n\"One says that as one says 'Rachel' of her great predecessor.\"\n\n\"Except that she isn't so great, quite yet, is she?\"\n\n\"Far from it; she's the freshest of novices--she has scarcely been four\nmonths on the stage. But no novice has ever been such an adept. She'll\ngo very fast,\" Peter pursued, \"and I daresay that before long she'll be\nmagnificent.\"\n\n\"What a pity you'll not see that!\" Biddy sighed after a pause.\n\n\"Not see it?\"\n\n\"If you're thousands of miles away.\"\n\n\"It is a pity,\" Peter said; \"and since you mention it I don't mind\nfrankly telling you--throwing myself on your mercy, as it were--that\nthat's why I make such a point of a rare occasion like to-night. I've a\nweakness for the drama that, as you perhaps know, I've never concealed,\nand this impression will probably have to last me in some barren spot\nfor many, many years.\"\n\n\"I understand--I understand. I hope therefore it will be charming.\" And\nthe girl walked faster.\n\n\"Just as some other charming impressions will have to last,\" Peter\nadded, conscious of keeping up with her by some effort. She seemed\nalmost to be running away from him, an impression that led him to\nsuggest, after they had proceeded a little further without more words,\nthat if she were in a hurry they had perhaps better take a cab. Her face\nwas strange and touching to him as she turned it to make answer:\n\n\"Oh I'm not in the least in a hurry and I really think I had better\nwalk.\"\n\n\"We'll walk then by all means!\" Peter said with slightly exaggerated\ngaiety; in pursuance of which they went on a hundred yards. Biddy kept\nthe same pace; yet it was scarcely a surprise to him that she should\nsuddenly stop with the exclamation:\n\n\"After all, though I'm not in a hurry I'm tired! I had better have a\ncab; please call that one,\" she added, looking about her.\n\nThey were in a straight, blank, ugly street, where the small, cheap,\ngrey-faced houses had no expression save that of a rueful, unconsoled\nacknowledgment of the universal want of identity. They would have\nconstituted a \"terrace\" if they could, but they had dolefully given it\nup. Even a hansom that loitered across the end of the vista turned a\nsceptical back upon it, so that Sherringham had to lift his voice in a\nloud appeal. He stood with Biddy watching the cab approach them. \"This\nis one of the charming things you'll remember,\" she said, turning her\neyes to the general dreariness from the particular figure of the\nvehicle, which was antiquated and clumsy. Before he could reply she had\nlightly stepped into the cab; but as he answered, \"Most assuredly it\nis,\" and prepared to follow her she quickly closed the apron.\n\n\"I must go alone; you've lots of things to do--it's all right\"; and\nthrough the aperture in the roof she gave the driver her address. She\nhad spoken with decision, and Peter fully felt now that she wished to\nget away from him. Her eyes betrayed it, as well as her voice, in a\nlook, a strange, wandering ray that as he stood there with his hand on\nthe cab he had time to take from her. \"Good-bye, Peter,\" she smiled; and\nas the thing began to rumble away he uttered the same tepid, ridiculous\nfarewell.\n\n\n\n\nXLIV\n\n\nAt the entrance of Miriam and her mother Nick, in the studio, had\nstopped whistling, but he was still gay enough to receive them with\nevery appearance of warmth. He thought it a poor place, ungarnished,\nuntapestried, a bare, almost grim workshop, with all its revelations and\nhonours still to come. But his visitors smiled on it a good deal in the\nsame way in which they had smiled on Bridget Dormer when they met her at\nthe door: Mrs. Rooth because vague, prudent approbation was the habit of\nher foolish face--it was ever the least danger; and Miriam because, as\nseemed, she was genuinely glad to find herself within the walls of which\nshe spoke now as her asylum. She broke out in this strain to her host\nalmost as soon as she had crossed the threshold, commending his\ncircumstances, his conditions of work, as infinitely happier than her\nown. He was quiet, independent, absolute, free to do what he liked as he\nliked it, shut up in his little temple with his altar and his divinity;\nnot hustled about in a mob of people, having to posture and grin to pit\nand gallery, to square himself at every step with insufferable\nconventions and with the ignorance and vanity of others. He was\nblissfully alone.\n\n\"Mercy, how you do abuse your fine profession! I'm sure I never urged\nyou to adopt it!\" Mrs. Rooth cried, in real bewilderment, to her\ndaughter.\n\n\"She was abusing mine still more the other day,\" joked Nick--\"telling me\nI ought to be ashamed of it and of myself.\"\n\n\"Oh I never know from one moment to the other--I live with my heart in\nmy mouth,\" sighed the old woman.\n\n\"Aren't you quiet about the great thing--about my personal behaviour?\"\nMiriam smiled. \"My improprieties are all of the mind.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you _call_ your personal behaviour,\" her mother\nobjected.\n\n\"You would very soon if it were not what it is.\"\n\n\"And I don't know why you should wish to have it thought you've a wicked\nmind,\" Mrs. Rooth agreeably grumbled.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't see very well how I can make you understand that. At\nany rate,\" Miriam pursued with her grand eyes on Nick, \"I retract what I\nsaid the other day about Mr. Dormer. I've no wish to quarrel with him on\nthe way he has determined to dispose of his life, because after all it\ndoes suit me very well. It rests me, this little devoted corner; oh it\nrests me! It's out of the row and the dust, it's deliciously still and\nthey can't get at me. Ah when art's like this, _\u00c3\u00a0 la bonne heure_!\" And\nshe looked round on such a presentment of \"art\" in a splendid way that\nproduced amusement on the young man's part at its contrast with the\nhumble fact. Miriam shone upon him as if she liked to be the cause of\nhis mirth and went on appealing to him: \"You'll always let me come here\nfor an hour, won't you, to take breath--to let the whirlwind pass? You\nneedn't trouble yourself about me; I don't mean to impose on you in the\nleast the necessity of painting me, though if that's a manner of helping\nyou to get on you may be sure it will always be open to you. Do what you\nlike with me in that respect; only let me sit here on a high stool,\nkeeping well out of your way, and see what you happen to be doing. I'll\ntell you my own adventures when you want to hear them.\"\n\n\"The fewer adventures you have to tell the better, my dear,\" said Mrs.\nRooth; \"and if Mr. Dormer keeps you quiet he'll add ten years to my\nlife.\"\n\n\"It all makes an interesting comment on Mr. Dormer's own quietness, on\nhis independence and sweet solitude,\" Nick observed. \"Miss Rooth has to\nwork with others, which is after all only what Mr. Dormer has to do when\nhe works with Miss Rooth. What do you make of the inevitable sitter?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" answered Miriam, \"you can say to the inevitable sitter, 'Hold your\ntongue, you brute!'\"\n\n\"Isn't it a good deal in that manner that I've heard you address your\ncomrades at the theatre?\" Mrs. Rooth inquired. \"That's why my heart's in\nmy mouth.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they hit me back; they reply to me--_comme de raison_--as I\nshould never think of replying to Mr. Dormer. It's a great advantage to\nhim that when he's peremptory with his model it only makes her better,\nadds to her expression of gloomy grandeur.\"\n\n\"We did the gloomy grandeur in the other picture: suppose therefore we\ntry something different in this,\" Nick threw off.\n\n\"It _is_ serious, it _is_ grand,\" murmured Mrs. Rooth, who had taken up\na rapt attitude before the portrait of her daughter. \"It makes one\nwonder what she's thinking of. Beautiful, commendable things--that's\nwhat it seems to say.\"\n\n\"What can I be thinking of but the tremendous wisdom of my mother?\"\nMiriam returned. \"I brought her this morning to see that thing--she had\nonly seen it in its earliest stage--and not to presume to advise you\nabout anything else you may be so good as to embark on. She wanted, or\nprofessed she wanted, terribly to know what you had finally arrived at.\nShe was too impatient to wait till you should send it home.\"\n\n\"Ah send it home--send it home; let us have it always with us!\" Mrs.\nRooth engagingly said. \"It will keep us up, up, and up on the heights,\nnear the stars--be always for us a symbol and a reminder!\"\n\n\"You see I was right,\" Miriam went on; \"for she appreciates thoroughly,\nin her own way, and almost understands. But if she worries or distracts\nyou I'll send her directly home--I've kept the carriage there on\npurpose. I must add that I don't feel quite safe to-day in letting her\nout of my sight. She's liable to make dashes at the theatre and play\nunconscionable tricks there. I shall never again accuse mamma of a want\nof interest in my profession. Her interest to-day exceeds even my own.\nShe's all over the place and she has ideas--ah but ideas! She's capable\nof turning up at the theatre at five o'clock this afternoon to demand\nthe repainting of the set in the third act. For myself I've not a word\nmore to say on the subject--I've accepted every danger, I've swallowed\nmy fate. Everything's no doubt wrong, but nothing can possibly be right.\nLet us eat and drink, for to-night we die. If you say so mamma shall go\nand sit in the carriage, and as there's no means of fastening the doors\n(is there?) your servant shall keep guard over her.\"\n\n\"Just as you are now--be so good as to remain so; sitting just that\nway--leaning back with a smile in your eyes and one hand on the sofa\nbeside you and supporting you a little. I shall stick a flower into the\nother hand--let it lie in your lap just as it is. Keep that thing on\nyour head--it's admirably uncovered: do you call such an unconsidered\ntrifle a bonnet?--and let your head fall back a little. There it\nis--it's found. This time I shall really do something, and it will be as\ndifferent as you like from that other crazy job. Here we go!\" It was in\nthese irrelevant but earnest words that Nick responded to his sitter's\nuttered vagaries, of which her charming tone and countenance diminished\nthe superficial acerbity. He held up his hands a moment, to fix her in\nher limits, and in a few minutes had a happy sense of having begun to\nwork.\n\n\"The smile in her eyes--don't forget the smile in her eyes!\" Mrs. Rooth\nsoftly chanted, turning away and creeping about the room. \"That will\nmake it so different from the other picture and show the two sides of\nher genius, the wonderful range between them. They'll be splendid mates,\nand though I daresay I shall strike you as greedy you must let me hope\nyou'll send this one home too.\"\n\nShe explored the place discreetly and on tiptoe, talking twaddle as she\nwent and bending her head and her eyeglass over various objects with an\nair of imperfect comprehension that didn't prevent Nick's private recall\nof the story of her underhand, commercial habits told by Gabriel Nash at\nthe exhibition in Paris the first time her name had fallen on his ear. A\nqueer old woman from whom, if you approached her in the right way, you\ncould buy old pots--it was in this character that she had originally\nbeen introduced to him. He had lost sight of it afterwards, but it\nrevived again as his observant eyes, at the same time that they followed\nhis active hand, became aware of her instinctive, appraising gestures.\nThere was a moment when he frankly laughed out--there was so little in\nhis poor studio to appraise. Mrs. Rooth's wandering eyeglass and vague,\npolite, disappointed, bent back and head made a subject for a sketch on\nthe instant: they gave such a sudden pictorial glimpse of the element of\nrace. He found himself seeing the immemorial Jewess in her hold up a\ncandle in a crammed back shop. There was no candle indeed and his studio\nwas not crammed, and it had never occurred to him before that she was a\ngrand-daughter of Israel save on the general theory, so stoutly held by\nseveral clever people, that few of us are not under suspicion. The late\nRudolf Roth had at least been, and his daughter was visibly her father's\nchild; so that, flanked by such a pair, good Semitic presumptions\nsufficiently crowned the mother. Receiving Miriam's sharp, satiric\nshower without shaking her shoulders she might at any rate have been the\ndescendant of a tribe long persecuted. Her blandness was beyond all\nbaiting; she professed she could be as still as a mouse. Miriam, on the\nother side of the room, in the tranquil beauty of her attitude--\"found\"\nindeed, as Nick had said--watched her a little and then declared she had\nbest have been locked up at home. Putting aside her free account of the\ndangers to which her mother exposed her, it wasn't whimsical to imagine\nthat within the limits of that repose from which the Neville-Nugents\nnever wholly departed the elder lady might indeed be a trifle fidgety\nand have something on her mind. Nick presently mentioned that it\nwouldn't be possible for him to \"send home\" his second performance; and\nhe added, in the exuberance of having already got a little into relation\nwith his work, that perhaps this didn't matter, inasmuch as--if Miriam\nwould give him his time, to say nothing of her own--a third and a fourth\nmasterpiece might also some day very well struggle into the light. His\nmodel rose to this without conditions, assuring him he might count upon\nher till she grew too old and too ugly and that nothing would make her\nso happy as that he should paint her as often as Romney had painted the\ncelebrated Lady Hamilton. \"Ah Lady Hamilton!\" deprecated Mrs. Rooth;\nwhile Miriam, who had on occasion the candour of a fine acquisitiveness,\nwished to know what particular reason there might be for his not letting\nthem have the picture he was now beginning.\n\n\"Why I've promised it to Peter Sherringham--he has offered me money for\nit,\" Nick replied. \"However, he's welcome to it for nothing, poor chap,\nand I shall be delighted to do the best I can for him.\"\n\nMrs. Rooth, still prowling, stopped in the middle of the room at this,\nwhile her daughter echoed: \"He offered you money--just as we came in?\"\n\n\"You met him then at the door with my sister? I supposed you had--he's\ntaking her home,\" Nick explained.\n\n\"Your sister's a lovely girl--such an aristocratic type!\" breathed Mrs.\nRooth. Then she added: \"I've a tremendous confession to make to you.\"\n\n\"Mamma's confessions have to be tremendous to correspond with her\ncrimes,\" said Miriam. \"She asked Miss Dormer to come and see us,\nsuggested even that you might bring her some Sunday. I don't like the\nway mamma does such things--too much humility, too many _simagr\u00c3\u00a9es_,\nafter all; but I also said what I could to be nice to her. Your sister\n_is_ charming--awfully pretty and modest. If you were to press me I\nshould tell you frankly that it seems to me rather a social muddle, this\nrubbing shoulders of 'nice girls' and _filles de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_: I shouldn't\nthink it would do your poor young things much good. However, it's their\nown affair, and no doubt there's no more need of their thinking we're\nworse than we are than of their thinking we're better. The people they\nlive with don't seem to know the difference--I sometimes make my\nreflexions about the public one works for.\"\n\n\"Ah if you go in for the public's knowing differences you're far too\nparticular,\" Nick laughed. \"_D'o\u00c3\u00b9 tombez-vous_? as you affected French\npeople say. If you've anything at stake on that you had simply better\nnot play.\"\n\n\"Dear Mr. Dormer, don't encourage her to be so dreadful; for it _is_\ndreadful, the way she talks,\" Mrs. Rooth broke in. \"One would think we\nweren't respectable--one would think I had never known what I've known\nand been what I've been.\"\n\n\"What one would think, beloved mother, is that you're a still greater\nhumbug than you are. It's you, on the contrary, who go down on your\nknees, who pour forth apologies about our being vagabonds.\"\n\n\"Vagabonds--listen to her!--after the education I've given her and our\nmagnificent prospects!\" wailed Mrs. Rooth, sinking with clasped hands\nupon the nearest ottoman.\n\n\"Not after our prospects, if prospects they be: a good deal before them.\nYes, you've taught me tongues and I'm greatly obliged to you--they no\ndoubt give variety as well as incoherency to my conversation; and that\nof people in our line is for the most part notoriously monotonous and\nshoppy. The gift of tongues is in general the sign of your true\nadventurer. Dear mamma, I've no low standard--that's the last thing,\"\nMiriam went on. \"My weakness is my exalted conception of respectability.\nAh _parlez-moi de \u00c3\u00a7a_ and of the way I understand it! If I were to go in\nfor being respectable you'd see something fine. I'm awfully conservative\nand I know what respectability is, even when I meet people of society on\nthe accidental middle ground of either glowering or smirking. I know\nalso what it isn't--it isn't the sweet union of well-bred little girls\n('carefully-nurtured,' don't they call them?) and painted she-mummers. I\nshould carry it much further than any of these people: I should never\nlook at the likes of us! Every hour I live I see that the wisdom of the\nages was in the experience of dear old Madame Carr\u00c3\u00a9--was in a hundred\nthings she told me. She's founded on a rock. After that,\" Miriam went on\nto her host, \"I can assure you that if you were so good as to bring Miss\nDormer to see us we should be angelically careful of her and surround\nher with every attention and precaution.\"\n\n\"The likes of us--the likes of us!\" Mrs. Rooth repeated plaintively and\nwith a resentment as vain as a failure to sneeze. \"I don't know what\nyou're talking about and I decline to be turned upside down, I've my\nideas as well as you, and I repudiate the charge of false humility. I've\nbeen through too many troubles to be proud, and a pleasant, polite\nmanner was the rule of my life even in the days when, God knows, I had\neverything. I've never changed and if with God's help I had a civil\ntongue then, I've a civil tongue now. It's more than you always have, my\npoor, perverse, passionate child. Once a lady always a lady--all the\nfootlights in the world, turn them up as high as you will, make no\ndifference there. And I think people know it, people who know\nanything--if I may use such an expression--and it's because they know it\nthat I'm not afraid to address them in a pleasant way. So I must\nsay--and I call Mr. Dormer to witness, for if he could reason with you a\nbit about it he might render several people a service--your conduct to\nMr. Sherringham simply breaks my heart,\" Mrs. Rooth concluded, taking a\njump of several steps in the fine modern avenue of her argument.\n\nNick was appealed to, but he hung back, drawing with a free hand, and\nwhile he forbore Miriam took it up. \"Mother's good--mother's very good;\nbut it's only little by little that you discover how good she is.\" This\nseemed to leave him at ease to ask their companion, with the\npreliminary intimation that what she had just said was very striking,\nwhat she meant by her daughter's conduct to old Peter. Before Mrs. Rooth\ncould answer this question, however, Miriam broke across with one of her\nown. \"Do you mind telling me if you made your sister go off with Mr.\nSherringham because you knew it was about time for me to turn up? Poor\nMr. Dormer, I get you into trouble, don't I?\" she added quite with\ntenderness.\n\n\"Into trouble?\" echoed Nick, looking at her head but not at her eyes.\n\n\"Well, we won't talk about that!\" she returned with a rich laugh.\n\nHe now hastened to say that he had nothing to do with his sister's\nleaving the studio--she had only come, as it happened, for a moment. She\nhad walked away with Peter Sherringham because they were cousins and old\nfriends: he was to leave England immediately, for a long time, and he\nhad offered her his company going home. Mrs. Rooth shook her head very\nknowingly over the \"long time\" Mr. Sherringham would be absent--she\nplainly had her ideas about that; and she conscientiously related that\nin the course of the short conversation they had all had at the door of\nthe house her daughter had reminded Miss Dormer of something that had\npassed between them in Paris on the question of the charming young\nlady's modelling her head.\n\n\"I did it to make the idea of our meeting less absurd--to put it on the\nfooting of our both being artists. I don't ask you if she has talent,\"\nsaid Miriam.\n\n\"Then I needn't tell you,\" laughed Nick.\n\n\"I'm sure she has talent and a very refined inspiration. I see something\nin that corner, covered with a mysterious veil,\" Mrs. Rooth insinuated;\nwhich led Miriam to go on immediately:\n\n\"Has she been trying her hand at Mr. Sherringham?\"\n\n\"When should she try her hand, poor dear young lady? He's always sitting\nwith us,\" said Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"Dear mamma, you exaggerate. He has his moments--when he seems to say\nhis prayers to me; but we've had some success in cutting them down. _Il\ns'est bien d\u00c3\u00a9tach\u00c3\u00a9 ces jours-ci_, and I'm very happy for him. Of course\nit's an impertinent allusion for me to make; but I should be so\ndelighted if I could think of him as a little in love with Miss Dormer,\"\nthe girl pursued, addressing Nick.\n\n\"He is, I think, just a little--just a tiny bit,\" her artist allowed,\nworking away; while Mrs. Rooth ejaculated to her daughter\nsimultaneously:\n\n\"How can you ask such fantastic questions when you know he's dying for\n_you_?\"\n\n\"Oh dying!--he's dying very hard!\" cried Miriam. \"Mr. Sherringham's a\nman of whom I can't speak with too much esteem and affection and who may\nbe destined to perish by some horrid fever (which God forbid!) in the\nunpleasant country he's going to. But he won't have caught his fever\nfrom your humble servant.\"\n\n\"You may kill him even while you remain in perfect health yourself,\"\nsaid Nick; \"and since we're talking of the matter I don't see the harm\nof my confessing that he strikes me as far gone--oh as very bad indeed.\"\n\n\"And yet he's in love with your sister?--_je n'y suis plus_.\"\n\n\"He tries to be, for he sees that as regards you there are difficulties.\nHe'd like to put his hand on some nice girl who'd be an antidote to his\npoison.\"\n\n\"Difficulties are a mild name for them; poison even is a mild name for\nthe ill he suffers from. The principal difficulty is that he doesn't\nknow what the devil he wants. The next is that I don't either--or what\nthe devil I want myself. I only know what I don't want,\" Miriam kept on\nbrightly and as if uttering some happy, beneficent truth. \"I don't want\na person who takes things even less simply than I do myself. Mr.\nSherringham, poor man, must be very uncomfortable, for one side of him's\nin a perpetual row with the other side. He's trying to serve God and\nMammon, and I don't know how God will come off. What I like in you is\nthat you've definitely let Mammon go--it's the only decent way. That's\nmy earnest conviction, and yet they call us people light. Dear Mr.\nSherringham has tremendous ambitions--tremendous _riguardi_, as we used\nto say in Italy. He wants to enjoy every comfort and to save every\nappearance, and all without making a scrap of a sacrifice. He expects\nothers--me, for instance--to make all the sacrifices. _Merci_, much as I\nesteem him and much as I owe him! I don't know how he ever came to stray\nat all into our bold, bad, downright Bohemia: it was a cruel trick for\nfortune to play him. He can't keep out of it, he's perpetually making\ndashes across the border, and yet as soon as he gets here he's on pins\nand needles. There's another in whose position--if I were in it--I\nwouldn't look at the likes of us!\"\n\n\"I don't know much about the matter,\" Nick brought out after some intent\nsmudging, \"but I've an idea Peter thinks he has made or at least is\nmaking sacrifices.\"\n\n\"So much the better--you must encourage him, you must help him.\"\n\n\"I don't know what my daughter's talking about,\" Mrs. Rooth\ncontributed--\"she's much too paradoxical for my plain mind. But there's\none way to encourage Mr. Sherringham--there's one way to help him; and\nperhaps it won't be a worse way for a gentleman of your good nature that\nit will help me at the same time. Can't I look to you, dear Mr. Dormer,\nto see that he does come to the theatre to-night--that he doesn't feel\nhimself obliged to stay away?\"\n\n\"What danger is there of his staying away?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"If he's bent on sacrifices that's a very good one to begin with,\"\nMiriam observed.\n\n\"That's the mad, bad way she talks to him--she has forbidden the dear\nunhappy gentleman the house!\" her mother cried. \"She brought it up to\nhim just now at the door--before Miss Dormer: such very odd form! She\npretends to impose her commands upon him.\"\n\n\"Oh he'll be there--we're going to dine together,\" said Nick. And when\nMiriam asked him what that had to do with it he went on: \"Why we've\narranged it; I'm going, and he won't let me go alone.\"\n\n\"You're going? I sent you no places,\" his sitter objected.\n\n\"Yes, but I've got one. Why didn't you, after all I've done for you?\"\n\nShe beautifully thought of it. \"Because I'm so good. No matter,\" she\nadded, \"if Mr. Sherringham comes I won't act.\"\n\n\"Won't you act for me?\"\n\n\"She'll act like an angel,\" Mrs. Rooth protested. \"She might do, she\nmight be, anything in all the world; but she won't take common pains.\"\n\n\"Of one thing there's no doubt,\" said Miriam: \"that compared with the\nrest of us--poor passionless creatures--mamma does know what she wants.\"\n\n\"And what's that?\" Nick inquired, chalking on.\n\n\"She wants everything.\"\n\n\"Never, never--I'm much more humble,\" retorted the old woman; upon\nwhich her daughter requested her to give then to Mr. Dormer, who was a\nreasonable man and an excellent judge, a general idea of the scope of\nher desires.\n\nAs, however, Mrs. Rooth, sighing and deprecating, was not quick to\nacquit herself, the girl tried a short cut to the truth with the abrupt\ndemand: \"Do you believe for a single moment he'd marry me?\"\n\n\"Why he has proposed to you--you've told me yourself--a dozen times.\"\n\n\"Proposed what to me?\" Miriam rang out. \"I've told you _that_ neither a\ndozen times nor once, because I've never understood. He has made\nwonderful speeches, but has never been serious.\"\n\n\"You told me he had been in the seventh heaven of devotion, especially\nthat night we went to the foyer of the Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais,\" Mrs. Rooth insisted.\n\n\"Do you call the seventh heaven of devotion serious? He's in love with\nme, _je le veux bien_; he's so poisoned--Mr. Dormer vividly puts it--as\nto require a strong antidote; but he has never spoken to me as if he\nreally expected me to listen to him, and he's the more of a gentleman\nfrom that fact. He knows we haven't a square foot of common ground--that\na grasshopper can't set up a house with a fish. So he has taken care to\nsay to me only more than he can possibly mean. That makes it stand just\nfor nothing.\"\n\n\"Did he say more than he can possibly mean when he took formal leave of\nyou yesterday--for ever and ever?\" the old woman cried.\n\nOn which Nick re-enforced her. \"And don't you call that--his taking\nformal leave--a sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Oh he took it all back, his sacrifice, before he left the house.\"\n\n\"Then has that no meaning?\" demanded Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"None that I can make out,\" said her daughter.\n\n\"Ah I've no patience with you: you can be stupid when you will--you can\nbe even that too!\" the poor lady groaned.\n\n\"What mamma wishes me to understand and to practise is the particular\nway to be artful with Mr. Sherringham,\" said Miriam. \"There are\ndoubtless depths of wisdom and virtue in it. But I see only one\nart--that of being perfectly honest.\"\n\n\"I like to hear you talk--it makes you live, brings you out,\" Nick\ncontentedly dropped. \"And you sit beautifully still. All I want to say\nis please continue to do so: remain exactly as you are--it's rather\nimportant--for the next ten minutes.\"\n\n\"We're washing our dirty linen before you, but it's all right,\" the girl\nreturned, \"because it shows you what sort of people we are, and that's\nwhat you need to know. Don't make me vague and arranged and fine in this\nnew view,\" she continued: \"make me characteristic and real; make life,\nwith all its horrid facts and truths, stick out of me. I wish you could\nput mother in too; make us live there side by side and tell our little\nstory. 'The wonderful actress and her still more wonderful mamma'--don't\nyou think that's an awfully good subject?\"\n\nMrs. Rooth, at this, cried shame on her daughter's wanton humour,\nprofessing that she herself would never accept so much from Nick's good\nnature, and Miriam settled it that at any rate he was some day and in\nsome way to do her mother, _really_ do her, and so make her, as one of\nthe funniest persons that ever was, live on through the ages.\n\n\"She doesn't believe Mr. Sherringham wants to marry me any more than you\ndo,\" the girl, taking up her dispute again after a moment, represented\nto Nick; \"but she believes--how indeed can I tell you what she\nbelieves?--that I can work it so well, if you understand, that in the\nfulness of time I shall hold him in a vice. I'm to keep him along for\nthe present, but not to listen to him, for if I listen to him I shall\nlose him. It's ingenious, it's complicated; but I daresay you follow\nme.\"\n\n\"Don't move--don't move,\" said Nick. \"Pardon a poor clumsy beginner.\"\n\n\"No, I shall explain quietly. Somehow--here it's _very_ complicated and\nyou mustn't lose the thread--I shall be an actress and make a tremendous\nlot of money, and somehow too (I suppose a little later) I shall become\nan ambassadress and be the favourite of courts. So you see it will all\nbe delightful. Only I shall have to go very straight. Mamma reminds me\nof a story I once heard about the mother of a young lady who was in\nreceipt of much civility from the pretender to a crown, which indeed he,\nand the young lady too, afterwards more or less wore. The old countess\nwatched the course of events and gave her daughter the cleverest advice:\n'_Tiens bon, ma fille_, and you shall sit upon a throne.' Mamma wishes\nme to _tenir bon_--she apparently thinks there's a danger I mayn't--so\nthat if I don't sit upon a throne I shall at least parade at the foot of\none. And if before that, for ten years, I pile up the money, they'll\nforgive me the way I've made it. I should hope so, if I've _tenu bon_!\nOnly ten years is a good while to hold out, isn't it? If it isn't Mr.\nSherringham it will be some one else. Mr. Sherringham has the great\nmerit of being a bird in the hand. I'm to keep him along, I'm to be\nstill more diplomatic than even he can be.\"\n\nMrs. Rooth listened to her daughter with an air of assumed reprobation\nwhich melted, before the girl had done, into a diverted, complacent\nsmile--the gratification of finding herself the proprietress of so much\nwit and irony and grace. Miriam's account of her mother's views was a\nscene of comedy, and there was instinctive art in the way she added\ntouch to touch and made point upon point. She was so quiet, to oblige\nher painter, that only her fine lips moved--all her expression was in\ntheir charming utterance. Mrs. Rooth, after the first flutter of a less\ncynical spirit, consented to be sacrificed to an effect of the really\nhigh order she had now been educated to recognise; so that she scarce\nhesitated, when Miriam had ceased speaking, before she tittered out with\nthe fondest indulgence: '_Com\u00c3\u00a9dienne_!' And she seemed to appeal to\ntheir companion. \"Ain't she fascinating? That's the way she does for\nyou!\"\n\n\"It's rather cruel, isn't it,\" said Miriam, \"to deprive people of the\nluxury of calling one an actress as they'd call one a liar? I represent,\nbut I represent truly.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sherringham would marry you to-morrow--there's no question of ten\nyears!\" cried Mrs. Rooth with a comicality of plainness.\n\nMiriam smiled at Nick, deprecating his horror of such talk. \"Isn't it\ndroll, the way she can't get it out of her head?\" Then turning almost\ncoaxingly to the old woman: \"_Voyons_, look about you: they don't marry\nus like that.\"\n\n\"But they do--_cela se voit tous les jours_. Ask Mr. Dormer.\"\n\n\"Oh never! It would be as if I asked him to give us a practical proof.\"\n\n\"I shall never prove anything by marrying any one,\" Nick said. \"For me\nthat question's over.\"\n\nMiriam rested kind eyes on him. \"Dear me, how you must hate me!\" And\nbefore he had time to reply she went on to her mother: \"People marry\nthem to make them leave the stage; which proves exactly what I say.\"\n\n\"Ah they offer them the finest positions,\" reasoned Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"Do you want me to leave it then?\"\n\n\"Oh you can manage if you will!\"\n\n\"The only managing I know anything about is to do my work. If I manage\nthat decently I shall pull through.\"\n\n\"But, dearest, may our work not be of many sorts?\"\n\n\"I only know one,\" said Miriam.\n\nAt this her mother got up with a sigh. \"I see you do wish to drive me\ninto the street.\"\n\n\"Mamma's bewildered--there are so many paths she wants to follow, there\nare so many bundles of hay. As I told you, she wishes to gobble them\nall,\" the girl pursued. Then she added: \"Yes, go and take the carriage;\ntake a turn round the Park--you always delight in that--and come back\nfor me in an hour.\"\n\n\"I'm too vexed with you; the air will do me good,\" said Mrs. Rooth. But\nbefore she went she addressed Nick: \"I've your assurance that you'll\nbring him then to-night?\"\n\n\"Bring Peter? I don't think I shall have to drag him,\" Nick returned.\n\"But you must do me the justice to remember that if I should resort to\nforce I should do something that's not particularly in my interest--I\nshould be magnanimous.\"\n\n\"We must always be that, mustn't we?\" moralised Mrs. Rooth.\n\n\"How could it affect your interest?\" Miriam asked less abstractedly.\n\n\"Yes, as you say,\" her mother mused at their host, \"the question of\nmarriage has ceased to exist for you.\"\n\n\"Mamma goes straight at it!\" laughed the girl, getting up while Nick\nrubbed his canvas before answering. Miriam went to mamma and settled\nher bonnet and mantle in preparation for her drive, then stood a moment\nwith a filial arm about her and as if waiting for their friend's\nexplanation. This, however, when it came halted visibly.\n\n\"Why you said a while ago that if Peter was there you wouldn't act.\"\n\n\"I'll act for _him_,\" smiled Miriam, inconsequently caressing her\nmother.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whom it's for!\" Mrs. Rooth declared sagaciously.\n\n\"Take your drive and relax your mind,\" said the girl, kissing her. \"Come\nfor me in an hour; not later--but not sooner.\" She went with her to the\ndoor, bundled her out, closed it behind her and came back to the\nposition she had quitted. \"_This_ is the peace I want!\" she gratefully\ncried as she settled into it.\n\n\n\n\nXLV\n\n\nPeter Sherringham said so little during the performance that his\ncompanion was struck by his dumbness, especially as Miriam's acting\nseemed to Nick magnificent. He held his breath while she was on the\nstage--she gave the whole thing, including the spectator's emotion, such\na lift. She had not carried out her fantastic menace of not exerting\nherself, and, as Mrs. Rooth had said, it little mattered for whom she\nacted. Nick was conscious in watching her that she went through it all\nfor herself, for the idea that possessed her and that she rendered with\nextraordinary breadth. She couldn't open the door a part of the way to\nit and let it simply peep in; if it entered at all it must enter in full\nprocession and occupy the premises in state.\n\nThis was what had happened on an occasion which, as the less tormented\nof our young men felt in his stall, grew larger with each throb of the\nresponsive house; till by the time the play was half over it appeared to\nstretch out wide arms to the future. Nick had often heard more applause,\nbut had never heard more attention, since they were all charmed and\nhushed together and success seemed to be sitting down with them. There\nhad been of course plenty of announcement--the newspapers had abounded\nand the arts of the manager had taken the freest license; but it was\neasy to feel a fine, universal consensus and to recognise everywhere\nthe light spring of hope. People snatched their eyes from the stage an\ninstant to look at each other, all eager to hand on the torch passed to\nthem by the actress over the footlights. It was a part of the impression\nthat she was now only showing to the full, for this time she had verse\nto deal with and she made it unexpectedly exquisite. She was beauty,\nmelody, truth; she was passion and persuasion and tenderness. She caught\nup the obstreperous play in soothing, entwining arms and, seeming to\ntread the air in the flutter of her robe, carried it into the high\nplaces of poetry, of art, of style. And she had such tones of nature,\nsuch concealments of art, such effusions of life, that the whole scene\nglowed with the colour she communicated, and the house, pervaded with\nrosy fire, glowed back at the scene. Nick looked round in the intervals;\nhe felt excited and flushed--the night had turned to a feast of\nfraternity and he expected to see people embrace each other. The crowd,\nthe agitation, the triumph, the surprise, the signals and rumours, the\nheated air, his associates, near him, pointing out other figures who\npresumably were celebrated but whom he had never heard of, all amused\nhim and banished every impulse to question or to compare. Miriam was as\nhappy as some right sensation--she would have fed the memory with deep\ndraughts.\n\nOne of the things that amused him or at least helped to fill his\nattention was Peter's attitude, which apparently didn't exclude\ncriticism--rather indeed mainly implied it. This admirer never took his\neyes off the actress, but he made no remark about her and never stirred\nout of his chair. Nick had had from the first a plan of going round to\nspeak to her, but as his companion evidently meant not to move he\nscrupled at being more forward. During their brief dinner together--they\nwere determined not to be late--Peter had been silent, quite recklessly\ngrave, but also, his kinsman judged, full of the wish to make it clear\nhe was calm. In his seat he was calmer than ever and had an air even of\ntrying to suggest that his attendance, preoccupied as he was with deeper\nsolemnities, was more or less mechanical, the result of a conception of\nduty, a habit of courtesy. When during a scene in the second act--a\nscene from which Miriam was absent--Nick observed to him that one might\njudge from his reserve that he wasn't pleased he replied after a moment:\n\"I've been looking for her mistakes.\" And when Nick made answer to this\nthat he certainly wouldn't find them he said again in an odd tone: \"No,\nI shan't find them--I shan't find them.\" It might have seemed that since\nthe girl's performance was a dazzling success he regarded his evening as\nrather a failure.\n\nAfter the third act Nick said candidly: \"My dear fellow, how can you sit\nhere? Aren't you going to speak to her?\"\n\nTo which Peter replied inscrutably: \"Lord, no, never again. I bade her\ngood-bye yesterday. She knows what I think of her form. It's very good,\nbut she carries it a little too far. Besides, she didn't want me to\ncome, and it's therefore more discreet to keep away from her.\"\n\n\"Surely it isn't an hour for discretion!\" Nick cried. \"Excuse me at any\nrate for five minutes.\"\n\nHe went behind and reappeared only as the curtain was rising on the\nfourth act; and in the interval between the fourth and the fifth he went\nagain for a shorter time. Peter was personally detached, but he\nconsented to listen to his companion's vivid account of the state of\nthings on the stage, where the elation of victory had lighted up the\nplace. The strain was over, the ship in port--they were all wiping their\nfaces and grinning. Miriam--yes, positively--was grinning too, and she\nhadn't asked a question about Peter nor sent him a message. They were\nkissing all round and dancing for joy. They were on the eve, worse luck,\nof a tremendous run. Peter groaned irrepressibly for this; it was, save\nfor a slight sign a moment later, the only vibration caused in him by\nhis cousin's report. There was but one voice of regret that they hadn't\nput on the piece earlier, as the end of the season would interrupt the\nrun. There was but one voice too about the fourth act--it was believed\nall London would rush to see the fourth act. The crowd about her was a\ndozen deep and Miriam in the midst of it all charming; she was receiving\nin the ugly place after the fashion of royalty, almost as hedged with\nthe famous \"divinity,\" yet with a smile and a word for each. She was\nreally like a young queen on her accession. When she saw him, Nick, she\nhad kissed her hand to him over the heads of the courtiers. Nick's\nartless comment on this was that she had such pretty manners. It made\nPeter laugh--apparently at his friend's conception of the manners of a\nyoung queen. Mrs. Rooth, with a dozen shawls on her arm, was as red as\nthe kitchen-fire, but you couldn't tell if Miriam were red or pale: she\nwas so cleverly, finely made up--perhaps a little too much. Dashwood of\ncourse was greatly to the fore, but you hadn't to mention his own\nperformance to him: he took it all handsomely and wouldn't hear of\nanything but that _her_ fortune was made. He didn't say much indeed, but\nevidently had ideas about her fortune; he nodded significant things and\nwhistled inimitable sounds--\"Heuh, heuh!\" He was perfectly satisfied;\nmoreover, he looked further ahead than any one.\n\nIt was on coming back to his place after the fourth act that Nick put\nin, for his companion's benefit, most of these touches in his sketch of\nthe situation. If Peter had continued to look for Miriam's mistakes he\nhadn't yet found them: the fourth act, bristling with dangers, putting a\npremium on every sort of cheap effect, had rounded itself without a\nflaw. Sitting there alone while Nick was away he had leisure to meditate\non the wonder of this--on the art with which the girl had separated\npassion from violence, filling the whole place and never screaming; for\nit had often seemed to him in London of old that the yell of theatrical\nemotion rang through the shrinking night like the voice of the Sunday\nnewsboy. Miriam had never been more present to him than at this hour;\nbut she was inextricably transmuted--present essentially as the romantic\nheroine she represented. His state of mind was of the strangest and he\nwas conscious of its strangeness, just as he was conscious in his very\nperson of a lapse of resistance which likened itself absurdly to\nliberation. He felt weak at the same time that he felt inspired, and he\nfelt inspired at the same time that he knew, or believed he knew, that\nhis face was a blank. He saw things as a shining confusion, and yet\nsomehow something monstrously definite kept surging out of them. Miriam\nwas a beautiful, actual, fictive, impossible young woman of a past age,\nan undiscoverable country, who spoke in blank verse and overflowed with\nmetaphor, who was exalted and heroic beyond all human convenience and\nwho yet was irresistibly real and related to one's own affairs. But that\nreality was a part of her spectator's joy, and she was not changed back\nto the common by his perception of the magnificent trick of art with\nwhich it was connected. Before his kinsman rejoined him Peter, taking a\nvisiting-card from his pocket, had written on it in pencil a few words\nin a foreign tongue; but as at that moment he saw Nick coming in he\nimmediately put it out of view.\n\nThe last thing before the curtain rose on the fifth act that young man\nmentioned his having brought a message from Basil Dashwood, who hoped\nthey both, on leaving the theatre, would come to supper with him in\ncompany with Miriam and her mother and several others: he had prepared a\nlittle informal banquet in honour of so famous a night. At this, while\nthe curtain was about to rise, Peter immediately took out his card again\nand added something--he wrote the finest small hand you could see. Nick\nasked him what he was doing, and he waited but an instant. \"It's a word\nto say I can't come.\"\n\n\"To Dashwood? Oh I shall go,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Well, I hope you'll enjoy it!\" his companion replied in a tone which\ncame back to him afterwards.\n\nWhen the curtain fell on the last act the people stayed, standing up in\ntheir places for acclamation. The applause shook the house--the recall\nbecame a clamour, the relief from a long tension. This was in any\nperformance a moment Peter detested, but he stood for an instant beside\nNick, who clapped, to his cousin's diplomatic sense, after the fashion\nof a school-boy at the pantomime. There was a veritable roar while the\ncurtain drew back at the side most removed from our pair. Peter could\nsee Basil Dashwood holding it, making a passage for the male \"juvenile\nlead,\" who had Miriam in tow. Nick redoubled his efforts; heard the\nplaudits swell; saw the bows of the leading gentleman, who was hot and\nfat; saw Miriam, personally conducted and closer to the footlights, grow\nbrighter and bigger and more swaying; and then became aware that his own\ncomrade had with extreme agility slipped out of the stalls. Nick had\nalready lost sight of him--he had apparently taken but a minute to\nescape from the house; and wondered at his quitting him without a\nfarewell if he was to leave England on the morrow and they were not to\nmeet at the hospitable Dashwood's. He wondered even what Peter was \"up\nto,\" since, as he had assured him, there was no question of his going\nround to Miriam. He waited to see this young lady reappear three times,\ndragging Dashwood behind her at the second with a friendly arm, to whom,\nin turn, was hooked Miss Fanny Rover, the actress entrusted in the piece\nwith the inevitable comic relief. He went out slowly with the crowd and\nat the door looked again for Peter, who struck him as deficient for once\nin finish. He couldn't know that in another direction and while he was\nhelping the house to \"rise\" at its heroine, his kinsman had been\nparticularly explicit.\n\nOn reaching the lobby Peter had pounced on a small boy in buttons, who\nseemed superfluously connected with a desolate refreshment-room and,\nfrom the tips of his toes, was peeping at the stage through the glazed\nhole in the door of a box. Into one of the child's hands he thrust the\ncard he had drawn again from his waistcoat and into the other the\nlargest silver coin he could find in the same receptacle, while he bent\nover him with words of adjuration--words the little page tried to help\nhimself to apprehend by instantly attempting to peruse the other words\nwritten on the card.\n\n\"That's no use--it's Italian,\" said Peter; \"only carry it round to Miss\nRooth without a minute's delay. Place it in her hand and she'll give you\nsome object--a bracelet, a glove, or a flower--to bring me back as a\nsign that she has received it. I shall be outside; bring me there what\nshe gives you and you shall have another shilling--only fly!\"\n\nHis small messenger sounded him a moment with the sharp face of London\nwage-earning, and still more of London tip-earning, infancy, and\nvanished as swiftly as a slave of the Arabian Nights. While he waited in\nthe lobby the audience began to pour out, and before the urchin had\ncome back to him he was clapped on the shoulder by Nick.\n\n\"I'm glad I haven't lost you, but why didn't you stay to give her a\nhand?\"\n\n\"Give her a hand? I hated it.\"\n\n\"My dear man, I don't follow you,\" Nick said. \"If you won't come to\nDashwood's supper I fear our ways don't lie together.\"\n\n\"Thank him very much; say I've to get up at an unnatural hour.\" To this\nPeter added: \"I think I ought to tell you she may not be there.\"\n\n\"Miss Rooth? Why it's all _for_ her.\"\n\n\"I'm waiting for a word from her--she may change her mind.\"\n\nNick showed his interest. \"For you? What then have you proposed?\"\n\n\"I've proposed marriage,\" said Peter in a strange voice.\n\n\"I say--!\" Nick broke out; and at the same moment Peter's messenger\nsqueezed through the press and stood before him.\n\n\"She has given me nothing, sir,\" the boy announced; \"but she says I'm to\nsay 'All right!'\"\n\nNick's stare widened. \"You've proposed through _him_?\"\n\n\"Aye, and she accepts. Good-night!\"--on which, turning away, Peter\nbounded into a hansom. He said something to the driver through the roof,\nand Nick's eyes followed the cab as it started off. This young man was\nmystified, was even amused; especially when the youth in buttons,\nplanted there and wondering too, brought forth:\n\n\"Please sir, he told me he'd give me a shilling and he've forgot it.\"\n\n\"Oh I can't pay you for _that_!\" Nick laughed. But he fished out a dole,\nthough he was vexed at the injury to the supper.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI\n\n\nPeter meanwhile rolled away through the summer night to Saint John's\nWood. He had put the pressure of strong words on his young friend,\nentreating her to drive home immediately, return there without any one,\nwithout even her mother. He wished to see her alone and for a purpose he\nwould fully and satisfactorily explain--couldn't she trust him? He\nbesought her to remember his own situation and throw over her supper,\nthrow over everything. He would wait for her with unspeakable impatience\nin Balaklava Place.\n\nHe did so, when he got there, but it had taken half an hour.\nInterminable seemed his lonely vigil in Miss Lumley's drawing-room,\nwhere the character of the original proprietress came out to him more\nthan ever before in a kind of afterglow of old sociabilities, a vulgar,\nghostly reference. The numerous candles had been lighted for him, and\nMrs. Rooth's familiar fictions lay about; but his nerves forbade him the\nsolace of a chair and a book. He walked up and down, thinking and\nlistening, and as the long window, the balmy air permitting, stood open\nto the garden, he passed several times in and out. A carriage appeared\nto stop at the gate--then there was nothing; he heard the rare rattle of\nwheels and the far-off hum of London. His impatience was overwrought,\nand though he knew this it persisted; it would have been no easy matter\nfor Miriam to break away from the flock of her felicitators. Still less\nsimple was it doubtless for her to leave poor Dashwood with his supper\non his hands. Perhaps she would bring Dashwood with her, bring him to\ntime her; she was capable of playing him--that is, of playing Her\nMajesty's new representative to the small far-off State, or even of\nplaying them both--that trick. Perhaps the little wretch in\nbuttons--Peter remembered now the neglected shilling--only pretending to\ngo round with his card, had come back with an invented answer. But how\ncould he know, since presumably he couldn't read Italian, that his\nanswer would fit the message? Peter was sorry now that he himself had\nnot gone round, not snatched Miriam bodily away, made sure of her and of\nwhat he wanted of her.\n\nWhen forty minutes had elapsed he regarded it as proved that she\nwouldn't come, and, asking himself what he should do, determined to\ndrive off again and seize her at her comrade's feast. Then he remembered\nhow Nick had mentioned that this entertainment was not to be held at the\nyoung actor's lodgings but at some tavern or restaurant the name of\nwhich he had not heeded. Suddenly, however, Peter became aware with joy\nthat this name didn't matter, for there was something at the garden door\nat last. He rushed out before she had had time to ring, and saw as she\nstepped from the carriage that she was alone. Now that she was there,\nthat he had this evidence she had listened to him and trusted him, all\nhis impatience and bitterness gave way and a flood of pleading\ntenderness took their place in the first words he spoke to her. It was\nfar \"dearer\" of her than he had any right to dream, but she was the best\nand kindest creature--this showed it--as well as the most wonderful. He\nwas really not off his head with his contradictory ways; no, before\nheaven he wasn't, and he would explain, he would make everything clear.\nEverything was changed.\n\nShe stopped short in the little dusky garden, looking at him in the\nlight of the open window. Then she called back to the coachman--they had\nleft the garden door open--\"Wait for me, mind; I shall want you again.\"\n\n\"What's the matter--won't you stay?\" Peter asked. \"Are you going out\nagain at this absurd hour? I won't hurt you,\" he gently urged. And he\nwent back and closed the garden door. He wanted to say to the coachman,\n\"It's no matter--please drive away.\" At the same time he wouldn't for\nthe world have done anything offensive to her.\n\n\"I've come because I thought it better to-night, as things have turned\nout, to do the thing you ask me, whatever it may be,\" she had already\nbegun. \"That's probably what you calculated I would think, eh? What this\nevening has been you've seen, and I must allow that your hand's in it.\nThat you know for yourself--that you doubtless felt as you sat there.\nBut I confess I don't imagine what you want of me here now,\" she added.\nShe had remained standing in the path.\n\nPeter felt the irony of her \"now\" and how it made a fool of him, but he\nhad been prepared for this and for much worse. He had begged her not to\nthink him a fool, but in truth at present he cared little if she did.\nVery likely he was--in spite of his plea that everything was changed: he\ncared little even himself. However, he spoke in the tone of intense\nreason and of the fullest disposition to satisfy her. This lucidity only\ntook still more from the dignity of his change of front: his separation\nfrom her the day before had had such pretensions to being lucid. But the\nexplanation and the justification were in the very fact, the fact that\nhad complete possession of him. He named it when he replied to her:\n\"I've simply overrated my strength.\"\n\n\"Oh I knew--I knew! That's why I entreated you not to come!\" Miriam\ngroaned. She turned away lamenting, and for a moment he thought she\nwould retreat to her carriage. But he passed his hand into her arm, to\ndraw her forward, and after an instant felt her yield.\n\n\"The fact is we must have this thing out,\" he said. Then he added as he\nmade her go into the house, bending over her, \"The failure of my\nstrength--that was just the reason of my coming.\"\n\nShe broke into her laugh at these words, as she entered the\ndrawing-room, and it made them sound pompous in their false wisdom. She\nflung off, as a good-natured tribute to the image of their having the\nthing out, a white shawl that had been wrapped round her. She was still\npainted and bedizened, in the splendid dress of her climax, so that she\nseemed protected and alienated by the character she had been acting.\n\"Whatever it is you want--when I understand--you'll be very brief, won't\nyou? Do you know I've given up a charming supper for you? Mamma has gone\nthere. I've promised to go back to them.\"\n\n\"You're an angel not to have let her come with you. I'm sure she wanted\nto,\" Peter made reply.\n\n\"Oh she's all right, but she's nervous.\" Then the girl added: \"Couldn't\nshe keep you away after all?\"\n\n\"Whom are you talking about?\" Biddy Dormer was as absent from his mind\nas if she had never existed.\n\n\"The charming thing you were with this morning. Is she so afraid of\nobliging me? Oh she'd be so good for you!\"\n\n\"Don't speak of that,\" Peter gravely said. \"I was in perfect good faith\nyesterday when I took leave of you. I was--I was. But I can't--I can't:\nyou're too unutterably dear to me.\"\n\n\"Oh don't--_please_ don't!\" Miriam wailed at this. She stood before the\nfireless chimney-piece with one of her hands on it. \"If it's only to say\nthat, don't you know, what's the use?\"\n\n\"It isn't only to say that. I've a plan, a perfect plan: the whole thing\nlies clear before me.\"\n\n\"And what's the whole thing?\"\n\nHe had to make an effort. \"You say your mother's nervous. Ah if you knew\nhow nervous I am!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not. Go on.\"\n\n\"Give it up--give it up!\" Peter stammered.\n\n\"Give it up?\" She fixed him like a mild Medusa.\n\n\"I'll marry you to-morrow if you'll renounce; and in return for the\nsacrifice you make for me I'll do more for you than ever was done for a\nwoman before.\"\n\n\"Renounce after to-night? Do you call that a plan?\" she asked. \"Those\nare old words and very foolish ones--you wanted something of that sort a\nyear ago.\"\n\n\"Oh I fluttered round the idea at that time; we were talking in the air.\nI didn't really believe I could make you see it then, and certainly you\ndidn't see it. My own future, moreover, wasn't definite to me. I didn't\nknow what I could offer you. But these last months have made a\ndifference--I do know now. Now what I say is deliberate--It's deeply\nmeditated. I simply can't live without you, and I hold that together we\nmay do great things.\"\n\nShe seemed to wonder. \"What sort of things?\"\n\n\"The things of my profession, of my life, the things one does for one's\ncountry, the responsibility and the honour of great affairs; deeply\nfascinating when one's immersed in them, and more exciting really--put\nthem even at that--than the excitements of the theatre. Care for me only\na little and you'll see what they are, they'll take hold of you. Believe\nme, believe me,\" Peter pleaded; \"every fibre of my being trembles in\nwhat I say to you.\"\n\n\"You admitted yesterday it wouldn't do,\" she made answer. \"Where were\nthe fibres of your being then?\"\n\n\"They throbbed in me even more than now, and I was trying, like an ass,\nnot to feel them. Where was this evening yesterday--where were the\nmaddening hours I've just spent? Ah you're the perfection of\nperfections, and as I sat there to-night you taught me what I really\nwant.\"\n\n\"The perfection of perfections?\" the girl echoed with the strangest\nsmile.\n\n\"I needn't try to tell you: you must have felt to-night with such\nrapture what you are, what you can do. How can I give that up?\" he\npiteously went on.\n\n\"How can _I_, my poor friend? I like your plans and your\nresponsibilities and your great affairs, as you call them. _Voyons_,\nthey're infantile. I've just shown that I'm a perfection of perfections:\ntherefore it's just the moment to 'renounce,' as you gracefully say? Oh\nI was sure, I was sure!\" And Miriam paused, resting eyes at once lighted\nand troubled on him as in the effort to think of some arrangement that\nwould help him out of his absurdity. \"I was sure, I mean, that if you\ndid come your poor, dear, doting brain would be quite confused,\" she\npresently pursued. \"I can't be a muff in public just for you,\n_pourtant_. Dear me, why do you like us so much?\"\n\n\"Like you? I loathe you!\"\n\n\"_Je le vois parbleu bien_!\" she lightly returned. \"I mean why do you\nfeel us, judge us, understand us so well? I please you because you see,\nbecause you know; and then for that very reason of my pleasing you must\nadapt me to your convenience, you must take me over, as they say. You\nadmire me as an artist and therefore want to put me into a box in which\nthe artist will breathe her last. Ah be reasonable; you must let her\nlive!\"\n\n\"Let her live? As if I could prevent her living!\" Peter cried with\nunmistakable conviction. \"Even if I did wish how could I prevent a\nspirit like yours from expressing itself? Don't talk about my putting\nyou in a box, for, dearest child, I'm taking you out of one,\" he all\npersuasively explained. \"The artist is irrepressible, eternal; she'll be\nin everything you are and in everything you do, and you'll go about with\nher triumphantly exerting your powers, charming the world, carrying\neverything before you.\"\n\nMiriam's colour rose, through all her artificial surfaces, at this all\nbut convincing appeal, and she asked whimsically: \"Shall you like that?\"\n\n\"Like my wife to be the most brilliant woman in Europe? I think I can do\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Aren't you afraid of me?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"Bravely said. How little you know me after all!\" sighed the girl.\n\n\"I tell the truth,\" Peter ardently went on; \"and you must do me the\njustice to admit that I've taken the time to dig deep into my feelings.\nI'm not an infatuated boy; I've lived, I've had experience, I've\nobserved; in short I know what I mean and what I want. It isn't a thing\nto reason about; it's simply a need that consumes me. I've put it on\nstarvation diet, but that's no use--really, it's no use, Miriam,\" the\nyoung man declared with a ring that spoke enough of his sincerity. \"It\nis no question of my trusting you; it's simply a question of your\ntrusting me. You're all right, as I've heard you say yourself; you're\nfrank, spontaneous, generous; you're a magnificent creature. Just\nquietly marry me and I'll manage you.\"\n\n\"'Manage' me?\" The girl's inflexion was droll; it made him change\ncolour.\n\n\"I mean I'll give you a larger life than the largest you can get in any\nother way. The stage is great, no doubt, but the world's greater. It's a\nbigger theatre than any of those places in the Strand. We'll go in for\nrealities instead of fables, and you'll do them far better than you do\nthe fables.\"\n\nMiriam had listened attentively, but her face that could so show things\nshowed her despair at his perverted ingenuity. \"Pardon my saying it\nafter your delightful tributes to my worth,\" she returned in a moment,\n\"but I've never listened to anything quite so grandly unreal. You think\nso well of me that humility itself ought to keep me silent; nevertheless\nI _must_ utter a few shabby words of sense. I'm a magnificent creature\non the stage--well and good; it's what I want to be and it's charming to\nsee such evidence that I succeed. But off the stage, woe betide us both,\nI should lose all my advantages. The fact's so patent that it seems to\nme I'm very good-natured even to discuss it with you.\"\n\n\"Are you on the stage now, pray? Ah Miriam, if it weren't for the\nrespect I owe you!\" her companion wailed.\n\n\"If it weren't for that I shouldn't have come here to meet you. My gift\nis the thing that takes you: could there be a better proof than that\nit's to-night's display of it that has brought you to this unreason?\nIt's indeed a misfortune that you're so sensitive to our poor arts,\nsince they play such tricks with your power to see things as they are.\nWithout my share of them I should be a dull, empty, third-rate woman,\nand yet that's the fate you ask me to face and insanely pretend you're\nready to face yourself.\"\n\n\"Without it--without it?\" Sherringham cried. \"Your own sophistry's\ninfinitely worse than mine. I should like to see you without it for the\nfiftieth part of a second. What I ask you to give up is the dusty boards\nof the play-house and the flaring footlights, but not the very essence\nof your being. Your 'gift,' your genius, is yourself, and it's because\nit's yourself that I yearn for you. If it had been a thing you could\nleave behind by the easy dodge of stepping off the stage I would never\nhave looked at you a second time. Don't talk to me as if I were a\nsimpleton--with your own false simplifications! You were made to charm\nand console, to represent beauty and harmony and variety to miserable\nhuman beings; and the daily life of man is the theatre for that--not a\nvulgar shop with a turnstile that's open only once in the twenty-four\nhours. 'Without it,' verily!\" Peter proceeded with a still, deep heat\nthat kept down in a manner his rising scorn and exasperated passion.\n\"Please let me know the first time you're without your face, without\nyour voice, your step, your exquisite spirit, the turn of your head and\nthe wonder of your look!\"\n\nMiriam at this moved away from him with a port that resembled what she\nsometimes showed on the stage when she turned her young back upon the\nfootlights and then after a few steps grandly swept round again. This\nevolution she performed--it was over in an instant--on the present\noccasion; even to stopping short with her eyes upon him and her head\nadmirably erect. \"Surely it's strange,\" she said, \"the way the other\nsolution never occurs to you.\"\n\n\"The other solution?\"\n\n\"That _you_ should stay on the stage.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" her friend gloomed.\n\n\"Stay on _my_ stage. Come off your own.\"\n\nFor a little he said nothing; then: \"You mean that if I'll do that\nyou'll have me?\"\n\n\"I mean that if it were to occur to you to offer me a little sacrifice\non your own side it might place the matter in a slightly more attractive\nlight.\"\n\n\"Continue to let you act--as my wife?\" he appealed. \"Is it a real\ncondition? Am I to understand that those are your terms?\"\n\n\"I may say so without fear, because you'll never accept them.\"\n\n\"Would you accept them _from_ me?\" he demanded; \"accept the manly, the\nprofessional sacrifice, see me throw up my work, my prospects--of course\nI should have to do that--and simply become your appendage?\"\n\nShe raised her arms for a prodigious fall. \"My dear fellow, you invite\nme with the best conscience in the world to become yours.\"\n\n\"The cases are not equal. You'd make of me the husband of an actress. I\nshould make of you the wife of an ambassador.\"\n\n\"The husband of an actress, _c'est bient\u00c3\u00b4t dit_, in that tone of scorn!\nIf you're consistent,\" said Miriam, all lucid and hard, \"it ought to be\na proud position for you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, if I'm consistent?\"\n\n\"Haven't you always insisted on the beauty and interest of our art and\nthe greatness of our mission? Haven't you almost come to blows with poor\nGabriel Nash about it? What did all that mean if you won't face the\nfirst consequences of your theory? Either it was an enlightened\nconviction or it was an empty pretence. If you were only talking\nagainst time I'm glad to know it,\" she rolled out with a darkening eye.\n\"The better the cause, it seems to me, the better the deed; and if the\ntheatre _is_ important to the 'human spirit,' as you used to say so\ncharmingly, and if into the bargain you've the pull of being so fond of\nme, I don't see why it should be monstrous of you to give us your\nservices in an intelligent, indirect way. Of course if you're not\nserious we needn't talk at all; but if you are, with your conception of\nwhat the actor can do, why is it so base to come to the actor's aid,\ntaking one devotion with another? If I'm so fine I'm worth looking after\na bit, and the place where I'm finest is the place to look after me!\"\n\nHe had a long pause again, taking her in as it seemed to him he had\nnever done. \"You were never finer than at this minute, in the deepest\ndomesticity of private life. I've no conception whatever of what the\nactor can do, and no theory whatever about the importance of the\ntheatre. Any infatuation of that sort has completely dropped from me,\nand for all I care the theatre may go to the dogs--which I judge it\naltogether probably will!\"\n\n\"You're dishonest, you're ungrateful, you're false!\" Miriam flashed. \"It\nwas the theatre brought you here--if it hadn't been for the theatre I\nnever would have looked at you. It was in the name of the theatre you\nfirst made love to me; it's to the theatre you owe every advantage that,\nso far as I'm concerned, you possess.\"\n\n\"I seem to possess a great many!\" poor Peter derisively groaned.\n\n\"You might avail yourself better of those you have! You make me angry,\nbut I want to be fair,\" said the shining creature, \"and I can't be\nunless you are. You're not fair, nor candid, nor honourable, when you\nswallow your words and abjure your faith, when you throw over old\nfriends and old memories for a selfish purpose.\"\n\n\"'Selfish purpose' is, in your own convenient idiom, _bient\u00c3\u00b4t dit_,\"\nPeter promptly answered. \"I suppose you consider that if I truly\nesteemed you I should be ashamed to deprive the world of the light of\nyour genius. Perhaps my esteem isn't of the right quality--there are\ndifferent kinds, aren't there? At any rate I've explained to you that I\npropose to deprive the world of nothing at all. You shall be celebrated,\n_allez_!\"\n\n\"Vain words, vain words, my dear!\" and she turned off again in her\nimpatience. \"I know of course,\" she added quickly, \"that to befool\nyourself with such twaddle you must be pretty bad.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm pretty bad,\" he admitted, looking at her dismally. \"What do\nyou do with the declaration you made me the other day--the day I found\nmy cousin here--that you'd take me if I should come to you as one who\nhad risen high?\"\n\nMiriam thought of it. \"I remember--the chaff about the honours, the\norders, the stars and garters. My poor foolish friend, don't be so\npainfully literal. Don't you know a joke when you see it? It was to\nworry your cousin, wasn't it? But it didn't in the least succeed.\"\n\n\"Why should you wish to worry my cousin?\"\n\n\"Because he's so provoking!\" she instantly answered; after which she\nlaughed as if for her falling too simply into the trap he had laid.\n\"Surely, at all events, I had my freedom no less than I have it now.\nPray what explanations should I have owed you and in what fear of you\nshould I have gone? However, that has nothing to do with it. Say I did\ntell you that we might arrange it on the day you should come to me\ncovered with glory in the shape of little tinkling medals: why should\nyou anticipate that transaction by so many years and knock me down such\na long time in advance? Where's the glory, please, and where are the\nmedals?\"\n\n\"Dearest girl, am I not going to strange parts--a capital\npromotion--next month,\" he insistently demanded, \"and can't you trust me\nenough to believe I speak with a real appreciation of the facts (that\nI'm not lying to you in short) when I tell you I've my foot in the\nstirrup? The glory's dawning. _I_'m all right too.\"\n\n\"What you propose to me, then, is to accompany you _tout bonnement_ to\nyour new post. What you propose to me is to pack up and start?\"\n\n\"You put it in a nutshell.\" But Peter's smile was strained.\n\n\"You're touching--it has its charm. But you can't get anything in any of\nthe Americas, you know. I'm assured there are no medals to be picked up\nin those parts--which are therefore 'strange' indeed. That's why the\ndiplomatic body hate them all.\"\n\n\"They're on the way, they're on the way!\"--he could only feverishly\nhammer. \"The people here don't keep us long in disagreeable places\nunless we want to stay. There's one thing you can get anywhere if you've\nability, and nowhere if you've not, and in the disagreeable places\ngenerally more than in the others; and that--since it's the element of\nthe question we're discussing--is simply success. It's odious to be put\non one's swagger, but I protest against being treated as if I had\nnothing to offer--to offer a person who has such glories of her own. I'm\nnot a little presumptuous ass; I'm a man accomplished and determined,\nand the omens are on my side.\" Peter faltered a moment and then with a\nqueer expression went on: \"Remember, after all, that, strictly speaking,\nyour glories are also still in the future.\" An exclamation at these\nwords burst from Miriam's lips, but her companion resumed quickly: \"Ask\nmy official superiors, ask any of my colleagues, if they consider I've\nnothing to offer.\"\n\nHe had an idea as he ceased speaking that she was on the point of\nbreaking out with some strong word of resentment at his allusion to the\ncontingent nature of her prospects. But it only deepened his wound to\nhear her say with extraordinary mildness: \"It's perfectly true that my\nglories are still to come, that I may fizzle out and that my little\nsuccess of to-day is perhaps a mere flash in the pan. Stranger things\nhave been--something of that sort happens every day. But don't we talk\ntoo much of that part of it?\" she asked with a weary patience that was\nnoble in its effect. \"Surely it's vulgar to think only of the noise\none's going to make--especially when one remembers how utterly _b\u00c3\u00aates_\nmost of the people will be among whom one makes it. It isn't to my\npossible glories I cling; it's simply to my idea, even if it's destined\nto betray me and sink me. I like it better than anything else--a\nthousand times better (I'm sorry to have to put it in such a way) than\ntossing up my head as the fine lady of a little coterie.\"\n\n\"A little coterie? I don't know what you're talking about!\"--for this at\nleast Peter could fight.\n\n\"A big coterie, then! It's only that at the best. A nasty, prim,\n'official' woman who's perched on her little local pedestal and thinks\nshe's a queen for ever because she's ridiculous for an hour! Oh you\nneedn't tell me, I've seen them abroad--the dreariest females--and could\nimitate them here. I could do one for you on the spot if I weren't so\ntired. It's scarcely worth mentioning perhaps all this while--but I'm\nready to drop.\" She picked up the white mantle she had tossed off,\nflinging it round her with her usual amplitude of gesture. \"They're\nwaiting for me and I confess I'm hungry. If I don't hurry they'll eat up\nall the nice things. Don't say I haven't been obliging, and come back\nwhen you're better. Good-night.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you that we've talked too much about the vulgar side\nof our question,\" Peter returned, walking round to get between her and\nthe French window by which she apparently had a view of leaving the\nroom. \"That's because I've wanted to bribe you. Bribery's almost always\nvulgar.\"\n\n\"Yes, you should do better. _Merci_! There's a cab: some of them have\ncome for me. I must go,\" she added, listening for a sound that reached\nher from the road.\n\nPeter listened too, making out no cab. \"Believe me, it isn't wise to\nturn your back on such an affection as mine and on such a confidence,\"\nhe broke out again, speaking almost in a warning tone--there was a touch\nof superior sternness in it, as of a rebuke for real folly, but it was\nmeant to be tender--and stopping her within a few feet of the window.\n\"Such things are the most precious that life has to give us,\" he added\nall but didactically.\n\nShe had listened once more for a little; then she appeared to give up\nthe idea of the cab. The reader need hardly be told that at this stage\nof her youthful history the right way for her lover to take her wouldn't\nhave been to picture himself as acting for her highest good. \"I like\nyour calling the feeling with which I inspire you confidence,\" she\npresently said; and the deep note of the few words had something of the\ndistant mutter of thunder.\n\n\"What is it, then, when I offer you everything I have, everything I am,\neverything I shall ever be?\"\n\nShe seemed to measure him as for the possible success of an attempt to\npass him. But she remained where she was. \"I'm sorry for you, yes, but\nI'm also rather ashamed.\"\n\n\"Ashamed of _me_?\"\n\n\"A brave offer to see me through--that's what I should call confidence.\nYou say to-day that you hate the theatre--and do you know what has made\nyou do it? The fact that it has too large a place in your mind to let\nyou disown it and throw it over with a good conscience. It has a deep\nfascination for you, and yet you're not strong enough to do so\nenlightened and public a thing as take up with it in my person. You're\nashamed of yourself for that, as all your constant high claims for it\nare on record; so you blaspheme against it to try and cover your retreat\nand your treachery and straighten out your personal situation. But it\nwon't do, dear Mr. Sherringham--it won't do at all,\" Miriam proceeded\nwith a triumphant, almost judicial lucidity which made her companion\nstare; \"you haven't the smallest excuse of stupidity, and your\nperversity is no excuse whatever. Leave her alone altogether--a poor\ngirl who's making her way--or else come frankly to help her, to give her\nthe benefit of your wisdom. Don't lock her up for life under the\npretence of doing her good. What does one most good is to see a little\nhonesty. You're the best judge, the best critic, the best observer, the\nbest _believer_, that I've ever come across: you're committed to it by\neverything you've said to me for a twelvemonth, by the whole turn of\nyour mind, by the way you've followed us up, all of us, from far back.\nIf an art's noble and beneficent one shouldn't be afraid to offer it\none's arm. Your cousin isn't: he can make sacrifices.\"\n\n\"My cousin?\" Peter amazedly echoed. \"Why, wasn't it only the other day\nyou were throwing his sacrifices in his teeth?\"\n\nUnder this imputation on her straightness Miriam flinched but for an\ninstant. \"I did that to worry _you_,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Why should you wish to worry me if you care so little about me?\"\n\n\"Care little about you? Haven't I told you often, didn't I tell you\nyesterday, how much I care? Ain't I showing it now by spending half the\nnight here with you--giving myself away to all those cynics--taking all\nthis trouble to persuade you to hold up your head and have the courage\nof your opinions?\"\n\n\"You invent my opinions for your convenience,\" said Peter all undaunted.\n\"As long ago as the night I introduced you, in Paris, to Mademoiselle\nVoisin, you accused me of looking down on those who practise your art. I\nremember how you came down on me because I didn't take your friend\nDashwood seriously enough. Perhaps I didn't; but if already at that time\nI was so wide of the mark you can scarcely accuse me of treachery now.\"\n\n\"I don't remember, but I daresay you're right,\" Miriam coldly meditated.\n\"What I accused you of then was probably simply what I reproach you with\nnow--the germ at least of your deplorable weakness. You consider that we\ndo awfully valuable work, and yet you wouldn't for the world let people\nsuppose you really take our side. If your position was even at that time\nso false, so much the worse for you, that's all. Oh it's refreshing,\"\nhis formidable friend exclaimed after a pause during which Peter seemed\nto himself to taste the full bitterness of despair, so baffled and\ncheapened he intimately felt--\"oh it's refreshing to see a man burn his\nships in a cause that appeals to him, give up something precious for it\nand break with horrid timidities and snobberies! It's the most beautiful\nsight in the world.\"\n\nPoor Peter, sore as he was, and with the cold breath of failure in his\nface, nevertheless burst out laughing at this fine irony. \"You're\nmagnificent, you give me at this moment the finest possible illustration\nof what you mean by burning one's ships. Verily, verily there's no one\nlike you: talk of timidity, talk of refreshment! If I had any talent for\nit I'd go on the stage to-morrow, so as to spend my life with you the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"If you'll do that I'll be your wife the day after your first\nappearance. That would be really respectable,\" Miriam said.\n\n\"Unfortunately I've no talent.\"\n\n\"That would only make it the more respectable.\"\n\n\"You're just like poor Nick,\" Peter returned--\"you've taken to imitating\nGabriel Nash. Don't you see that it's only if it were a question of my\ngoing on the stage myself that there would be a certain fitness in your\ncontrasting me invidiously with Nick and in my giving up one career for\nanother? But simply to stand in the wing and hold your shawl and your\nsmelling-bottle--!\" he concluded mournfully, as if he had ceased to\ndebate.\n\n\"Holding my shawl and my smelling-bottle is a mere detail, representing\na very small part of the whole precious service, the protection and\nencouragement, for which a woman in my position might be indebted to a\nman interested in her work and as accomplished and determined as you\nvery justly describe yourself.\"\n\n\"And would it be your idea that such a man should live on the money\nearned by an exhibition of the person of his still more accomplished and\nstill more determined wife?\"\n\n\"Why not if they work together--if there's something of his spirit and\nhis support in everything she does?\" Miriam demanded. \"_Je vous\nattendais_ with the famous 'person'; of course that's the great stick\nthey beat us with. Yes, we show it for money, those of us who have\nanything decent to show, and some no doubt who haven't, which is the\nreal scandal. What will you have? It's only the envelope of the idea,\nit's only our machinery, which ought to be conceded to us; and in\nproportion as the idea takes hold of us do we become unconscious of the\nclumsy body. Poor old 'person'--if you knew what _we_ think of it! If\nyou don't forget it that's your own affair: it shows you're dense before\nthe idea.\"\n\n\"That _I_'m dense?\"--and Peter appealed to their lamplit solitude, the\nfavouring, intimate night that only witnessed his defeat, as if this\noutrage had been all that was wanting.\n\n\"I mean the public is--the public who pays us. After all, they expect us\nto look at _them_ too, who are not half so well worth it. If you should\nsee some of the creatures who have the face to plant themselves there in\nthe stalls before one for three mortal hours! I daresay it would be\nsimpler to have no bodies, but we're all in the same box, and it would\nbe a great injustice to the idea, and we're all showing ourselves all\nthe while; only some of us are not worth paying.\"\n\n\"You're extraordinarily droll, but somehow I can't laugh at you,\" he\nsaid, his handsome face drawn by his pain to a contraction sufficiently\nattesting the fact. \"Do you remember the second time I ever saw you--the\nday you recited at my place?\" he abruptly asked; a good deal as if he\nwere taking from his quiver an arrow which, if it was the last, was also\none of the sharpest.\n\n\"Perfectly, and what an idiot I was, though it was only yesterday!\"\n\n\"You expressed to me then a deep detestation of the sort of\nself-exposure to which the profession you were taking up would commit\nyou. If you compared yourself to a contortionist at a country fair I'm\nonly taking my cue from you.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I may have said then,\" replied Miriam, whose steady\nflight was not arrested by this ineffectual bolt; \"I was no doubt\nalready wonderful for talking of things I know nothing about. I was only\non the brink of the stream and I perhaps thought the water colder than\nit is. One warms it a bit one's self when once one's in. Of course I'm a\ncontortionist and of course there's a hateful side, but don't you see\nhow that very fact puts a price on every compensation, on the help of\nthose who are ready to insist on the _other_ side, the grand one, and\nespecially on the sympathy of the person who's ready to insist most and\nto keep before us the great thing, the element that makes up for\neverything?\"\n\n\"The element--?\" Peter questioned with a vagueness that was pardonably\nexaggerated. \"Do you mean your success?\"\n\n\"I mean what you've so often been eloquent about,\" she returned with an\nindulgent shrug--\"the way we simply stir people's souls. Ah there's\nwhere life can help us,\" she broke out with a change of tone, \"there's\nwhere human relations and affections can help us; love and faith and joy\nand suffering and experience--I don't know what to call 'em! They\nsuggest things, they light them up and sanctify them, as you may say;\nthey make them appear worth doing.\" She became radiant a while, as if\nwith a splendid vision; then melting into still another accent, which\nseemed all nature and harmony and charity, she proceeded: \"I must tell\nyou that in the matter of what we can do for each other I have a\ntremendously high ideal. I go in for closeness of union, for identity of\ninterest. A true marriage, as they call it, must do one a lot of good!\"\n\nHe stood there looking at her for a time during which her eyes\nsustained his penetration without a relenting gleam, some lapse of\ncruelty or of paradox. But with a passionate, inarticulate sound he\nturned away, to remain, on the edge of the window, his hands in his\npockets, gazing defeatedly, doggedly, into the featureless night, into\nthe little black garden which had nothing to give him but a familiar\nsmell of damp. The warm darkness had no relief for him, and Miriam's\nhistrionic hardness flung him back against a fifth-rate world, against a\nbedimmed, star-punctured nature which had no consolation--the bleared,\nirresponsive eyes of the London firmament. For the brief space of his\nglaring at these things he dumbly and helplessly raged. What he wanted\nwas something that was not in _that_ thick prospect. What was the\nmeaning of this sudden, offensive importunity of \"art,\" this senseless,\nmocking catch, like some irritating chorus of conspirators in a bad\nopera, in which her voice was so incongruously conjoined with Nick's and\nin which Biddy's sweet little pipe had not scrupled still more\nbewilderingly to mingle? Art might yield to damnation: what commission\nafter all had he ever given it to better him or bother him? If the\npointless groan in which Peter exhaled a part of his humiliation had\nbeen translated into words, these words would have been as heavily\ncharged with a genuine British mistrust of the uncanny principle as if\nthe poor fellow speaking them had never quitted his island. Several\nacquired perceptions had struck a deep root in him, but an immemorial,\ncompact formation lay deeper still. He tried at the present hour to rest\non it spiritually, but found it inelastic; and at the very moment when\nmost conscious of this absence of the rebound or of any tolerable ease\nhe felt his vision solicited by an object which, as he immediately\nguessed, could only add to the complication of things.\n\nAn undefined shape hovered before him in the garden, halfway between the\ngate and the house; it remained outside of the broad shaft of lamplight\nprojected from the window. It wavered for a moment after it had become\naware of his observation and then whisked round the corner of the lodge.\nThis characteristic movement so effectually dispelled the mystery--it\ncould only be Mrs. Rooth who resorted to such conspicuous\nsecrecies--that, to feel the game up and his interview over, he had no\nneed to see the figure reappear on second thoughts and dodge about in\nthe dusk with a sportive, vexatious vagueness. Evidently Miriam's\nwarning of a few minutes before had been founded: a cab had deposited\nher anxious mother at the garden door. Mrs. Rooth had entered with\nprecautions; she had approached the house and retreated; she had effaced\nherself--had peered and waited and listened. Maternal solicitude and\nmuddled calculations had drawn her from a feast as yet too imperfectly\ncommemorative. The heroine of the occasion of course had been\nintolerably missed, so that the old woman had both obliged the company\nand quieted her own nerves by jumping insistently into a hansom and\nrattling up to Saint John's Wood to reclaim the absentee. But if she had\nwished to be in time she had also desired not to be impertinent, and\nwould have been still more embarrassed to say what she aspired to\npromote than to phrase what she had proposed to hinder. She wanted to\nabstain tastefully, to interfere felicitously, and, more generally and\njustifiably--the small hours having come--to see what her young charges\nwere \"up to.\" She would probably have gathered that they were\nquarrelling, and she appeared now to be motioning to Peter to know if it\nwere over. He took no notice of her signals, if signals they were; he\nonly felt that before he made way for the poor, odious lady there was\none small spark he might strike from Miriam's flint.\n\nWithout letting her guess that her mother was on the premises he turned\nagain to his companion, half-expecting she would have taken her chance\nto regard their discussion as more than terminated and by the other\negress flit away from him in silence. But she was still there; she was\nin the act of approaching him with a manifest intention of kindness, and\nshe looked indeed, to his surprise, like an angel of mercy.\n\n\"Don't let us part so harshly,\" she said--\"with your trying to make me\nfeel as if I were merely disobliging. It's no use talking--we only hurt\neach other. Let us hold our tongues like decent people and go about our\nbusiness. It isn't as if you hadn't any cure--when you've such a capital\none. Try it, try it, my dear friend--you'll see! I wish you the highest\npromotion and the quickest--every success and every reward. When you've\ngot them all, some day, and I've become a great swell too, we'll meet on\nthat solid basis and you'll be glad I've been dreadful now.\"\n\n\"Surely before I leave you I've a right to ask you this,\" he answered,\nholding fast in both his own the cool hand of farewell she had chosen\nfinally to torment him with. \"Are you ready to follow up by a definite\npromise your implied assurance that I've a remedy?\"\n\n\"A definite promise?\" Miriam benignly gazed--it was the perfection of\nindirectness. \"I don't 'imply' that you've a remedy. I declare it on the\nhouse-tops. That delightful girl--\"\n\n\"I'm not talking of any delightful girl but you!\" he broke in with a\nvoice that, as he afterwards learned, struck Mrs. Rooth's ears in the\ngarden with affright. \"I simply hold you, under pain of being convicted\nof the grossest prevarication, to the strict sense of what you said ten\nminutes ago.\"\n\n\"Ah I've said so many things! One has to do that to get rid of you. You\nrather hurt my hand,\" she added--and jerked it away in a manner showing\nthat if she was an angel of mercy her mercy was partly for herself.\n\n\"As I understand you, then, I may have some hope if I do renounce my\nprofession?\" Peter pursued. \"If I break with everything, my prospects,\nmy studies, my training, my emoluments, my past and my future, the\nservice of my country and the ambition of my life, and engage to take up\ninstead the business of watching your interests so far as I may learn\nhow and ministering to your triumphs so far as may in me lie--if after\nfurther reflexion I decide to go through these preliminaries, have I\nyour word that I may definitely look to you to reward me with your\nprecious hand?\"\n\n\"I don't think you've any right to put the question to me now,\" she\nreturned with a promptitude partly produced perhaps by the clear-cut\nform his solemn speech had given--there was a charm in the sound of\nit--to each item of his enumeration. \"The case is so very contingent, so\ndependent on what you ingeniously call your further reflexion. While you\nreally reserve everything you ask me to commit myself. If it's a\nquestion of further reflexion why did you drag me up here? And then,\"\nshe added, \"I'm so far from wishing you to take any such monstrous\nstep.\"\n\n\"Monstrous you call it? Just now you said it would be sublime.\"\n\n\"Sublime if it's done with spontaneity, with passion; ridiculous if it's\ndone 'after further reflexion.' As you said, perfectly, a while ago, it\nisn't a thing to reason about.\"\n\n\"Ah what a help you'd be to me in diplomacy!\" Peter yearningly cried.\n\"Will you give me a year to consider?\"\n\n\"Would you trust _me_ for a year?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I'm ready to trust you for life?\"\n\n\"Oh I shouldn't be free then, worse luck. And how much you seem to take\nfor granted one must like you!\"\n\n\"Remember,\" he could immediately say, \"that you've made a great point of\nyour liking me. Wouldn't you do so still more if I were heroic?\"\n\nShe showed him, for all her high impatience now, the interest of a long\nlook. \"I think I should pity you in such a cause. Give it all to _her_;\ndon't throw away a real happiness!\"\n\n\"Ah you can't back out of your position with a few vague and even rather\nimpertinent words!\" Peter protested. \"You accuse me of swallowing my\nopinions, but you swallow your pledges. You've painted in heavenly\ncolours the sacrifice I'm talking of, and now you must take the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"The consequences?\"\n\n\"Why my coming back in a year to square you.\"\n\n\"Ah you're a bore!\"--she let him have it at last. \"Come back when you\nlike. I don't wonder you've grown desperate, but fancy _me_ then!\" she\nadded as she looked past him at a new interlocutor.\n\n\"Yes, but if he'll square you!\" Peter heard Mrs. Rooth's voice respond\nall persuasively behind him. She had stolen up to the window now, had\npassed the threshold, was in the room, but her daughter had not been\nstartled. \"What is it he wants to do, dear?\" she continued to Miriam.\n\n\"To induce me to marry him if he'll go upon the stage. He'll practise\nover there--where he's going--and then come back and appear. Isn't it\ntoo dreadful? Talk him out of it, stay with him, soothe him!\" the girl\nhurried on. \"You'll find some drinks and some biscuits in the\ncupboard--keep him with you, pacify him, give him _his_ little supper.\nMeanwhile I'll go to mine; I'll take the brougham; don't follow!\"\n\nWith which words Miriam bounded into the garden, her white drapery\nshining for an instant in the darkness before she disappeared. Peter\nlooked about him to pick up his hat, but while he did so heard the bang\nof the gate and the quick carriage get into motion. Mrs. Rooth appeared\nto sway violently and in opposed directions: that of the impulse to rush\nafter Miriam and that of the extraordinary possibility to which the\nyoung lady had alluded. She was in doubt, yet at a venture, detaining\nhim with a maternal touch, she twinkled up at their visitor like an\ninsinuating glow-worm. \"I'm so glad you came.\"\n\n\"I'm not. I've got nothing by it,\" Peter said as he found his hat.\n\n\"Oh it was so beautiful!\" she declared.\n\n\"The play--yes, wonderful. I'm afraid it's too late for me to avail\nmyself of the privilege your daughter offers me. Good-night.\"\n\n\"Ah it's a pity; won't you take _anything_?\" asked Mrs. Rooth. \"When I\nheard your voice so high I was scared and hung back.\" But before he\ncould reply she added: \"Are you really thinking of the stage?\"\n\n\"It comes to the same thing.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you've proposed?\"\n\n\"Oh unmistakably.\"\n\n\"And what does she say?\"\n\n\"Why you heard: she says I'm an ass.\"\n\n\"Ah the little wretch!\" laughed Mrs. Rooth. \"Leave her to me. I'll help\nyou. But you are mad. Give up nothing--least of all your advantages.\"\n\n\"I won't give up your daughter,\" said Peter, reflecting that if this was\ncheap it was at any rate good enough for Mrs. Rooth. He mended it a\nlittle indeed by adding darkly: \"But you can't make her take me.\"\n\n\"I can prevent her taking any one else.\"\n\n\"Oh _can_ you?\" Peter cried with more scepticism than ceremony.\n\n\"You'll see--you'll see.\" He passed into the garden, but, after she had\nblown out the candles and drawn the window to, Mrs. Rooth went with him.\n\"All you've got to do is to be yourself--to be true to your fine\nposition,\" she explained as they proceeded. \"Trust me with the\nrest--trust me and be quiet.\"\n\n\"How can one be quiet after this magnificent evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's just that!\" panted the eager old woman. \"It has launched\nher so on this sea of dangers that to make up for the loss of the old\nsecurity (don't you know?) we must take a still firmer hold.\"\n\n\"Aye, of what?\" Peter asked as Mrs. Rooth's comfort became vague while\nshe stopped with him at the garden door.\n\n\"Ah you know: of the _real_ life, of the true anchor!\" Her hansom was\nwaiting for her and she added: \"I kept it, you see; but a little\nextravagance on the night one's fortune has come!--\"\n\nPeter stared. Yes, there were people whose fortune had come; but he\nmanaged to stammer: \"Are you following her again?\"\n\n\"For you--for you!\" And she clambered into the vehicle. From the seat,\nenticingly, she offered him the place beside her. \"Won't you come too? I\nknow he invited you.\" Peter declined with a quick gesture and as he\nturned away he heard her call after him, to cheer him on his lonely\nwalk: \"I shall keep this up; I shall never lose sight of her!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH\n\n\n\n\nXLVII\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Dallow returned to London just before London broke up the fact\nwas immediately known in Calcutta Gardens and was promptly communicated\nto Nick Dormer by his sister Bridget. He had learnt it in no other\nway--he had had no correspondence with Julia during her absence. He\ngathered that his mother and sisters were not ignorant of her\nwhereabouts--he never mentioned her name to them--but as to this he was\nnot sure if the source of their information had been the _Morning Post_\nor a casual letter received by the inscrutable Biddy. He knew Biddy had\nsome epistolary commerce with Julia; he had an impression Grace\noccasionally exchanged letters with Mrs. Gresham. Biddy, however, who,\nas he was also well aware, was always studying what he would like,\nforbore to talk to him about the absent mistress of Harsh beyond once\ndropping the remark that she had gone from Florence to Venice and was\nenjoying gondolas and sunsets too much to leave them. Nick's comment on\nthis was that she was a happy woman to have such a go at Titian and\nTintoret: as he spoke, and for some time afterwards, the sense of how he\nhimself should enjoy a like \"go\" made him ache with ineffectual longing.\n\nHe had forbidden himself at the present to think of absence, not only\nbecause it would be inconvenient and expensive, but because it would be\na kind of retreat from the enemy, a concession to difficulty. The enemy\nwas no particular person and no particular body of persons: not his\nmother; not Mr. Carteret, who, as he heard from the doctor at Beauclere,\nlingered on, sinking and sinking till his vitality appeared to have the\nvertical depth of a gold-mine; not his pacified constituents, who had\nfound a healthy diversion in returning another Liberal wholly without\nMrs. Dallow's aid (she had not participated even to the extent of a\nresponsive telegram in the election); not his late colleagues in the\nHouse, nor the biting satirists of the newspapers, nor the brilliant\nwomen he took down at dinner-parties--there was only one sense in which\nhe ever took them down; not in short his friends, his foes, his private\nthoughts, the periodical phantom of his shocked father: the enemy was\nsimply the general awkwardness of his situation. This awkwardness was\nconnected with the sense of responsibility so greatly deprecated by\nGabriel Nash, Gabriel who had ceased to roam of late on purpose to miss\nas few scenes as possible of the drama, rapidly growing dull alas, of\nhis friend's destiny; but that compromising relation scarcely drew the\nsoreness from it. The public flurry produced by his collapse had only\nbeen large enough to mark the flatness of our young man's position when\nit was over. To have had a few jokes cracked audibly at your expense\nwasn't an ordeal worth talking of; the hardest thing about it was merely\nthat there had not been enough of them to yield a proportion of good\nones. Nick had felt in fine the benefit of living in an age and in a\nsociety where number and pressure have, for the individual figure,\nespecially when it's a zero, compensations almost equal to their\ncruelties.\n\nNo, the pinch for his conscience after a few weeks had passed was simply\nan acute mistrust of the superficiality of performance into which the\ndesire to justify himself might hurry him. That desire was passionate\nas regards Julia Dallow; it was ardent also as regards his mother; and,\nto make it absolutely uncomfortable, it was complicated with the\nconviction that neither of them would know his justification even when\nshe should see it. They probably couldn't know it if they would, and\nvery certainly wouldn't if they could. He assured himself, however, that\nthis limitation wouldn't matter; it was their affair--his own was simply\nto have the right sort of thing to show. The work he was now attempting\nwasn't the right sort of thing, though doubtless Julia, for instance,\nwould dislike it almost as much as if it were. The two portraits of\nMiriam, after the first exhilaration of his finding himself at large,\nfilled him with no private glee; they were not in the direction in which\nhe wished for the present really to move. There were moments when he\nfelt almost angry, though of course he held his tongue, when by the few\npersons who saw them they were pronounced wonderfully clever. That they\nwere wonderfully clever was just the detestable thing in them, so active\nhad that cleverness been in making them seem better than they were.\nThere were people to whom he would have been ashamed to show them, and\nthese were the people whom it would give him most pleasure some day to\nplease. Not only had he many an hour of disgust at his actual work, but\nhe thought he saw as in an ugly revelation that nature had cursed him\nwith an odious facility and that the lesson of his life, the sternest\nand wholesomest, would be to keep out of the trap it had laid for him.\nHe had fallen into this trap on the threshold and had only scrambled out\nwith his honour. He had a talent for appearance, and that was the fatal\nthing; he had a damnable suppleness and a gift of immediate response, a\nreadiness to oblige, that made him seem to take up causes which he\nreally left lying, enabled him to learn enough about them in an hour to\nhave all the air of having converted them to his use. Many people used\nthem--that was the only thing to be said--who had taken them in much\nless. He was at all events too clever by half, since this pernicious\noverflow had wrecked most of his attempts. He had assumed a virtue and\nenjoyed assuming it, and the assumption had cheated his father and his\nmother and his affianced wife and his rich benefactor and the candid\nburgesses of Harsh and the cynical reporters of the newspapers. His\nenthusiasms had been but young curiosity, his speeches had been young\nagility, his professions and adhesions had been like postage-stamps\nwithout glue: the head was all right, but they wouldn't stick. He stood\nready now to wring the neck of the irrepressible vice that certainly\nwould tend to nothing so much as to get him into further trouble. His\nonly real justification would be to turn patience--his own of\ncourse--inside out; yet if there should be a way to misread that recipe\nhis humbugging genius could be trusted infallibly to discover it. Cheap\nand easy results would dangle before him, little amateurish\nconspicuities at exhibitions helped by his history; putting it in his\npower to triumph with a quick \"What do you say to that?\" over those he\nhad wounded. The fear of this danger was corrosive; it poisoned even\nlawful joys. If he should have a striking picture at the Academy next\nyear it wouldn't be a crime; yet he couldn't help suspecting any\nconditions that would enable him to be striking so soon. In this way he\nfelt quite enough how Gabriel Nash had \"had\" him whenever railing at his\nfever for proof, and how inferior as a productive force the desire to\nwin over the ill-disposed might be to the principle of quiet growth.\nNash had a foreign manner of lifting up his finger and waving it before\nhim, as if to put an end to everything, whenever it became, in\nconversation or discussion, to any extent a question whether any one\nwould \"like\" anything.\n\nIt was presumably in some degree at least a due respect for the\nprinciple of quiet growth that kept Nick on the spot at present, made\nhim stick fast to Rosedale Road and Calcutta Gardens and deny himself\nthe simplifications of absence. Do what he would he couldn't despoil\nhimself of the impression that the disagreeable was somehow connected\nwith the salutary, and the \"quiet\" with the disagreeable, when\nstubbornly borne; so he resisted a hundred impulses to run away to Paris\nor to Florence, coarse forms of the temptation to persuade himself by\nmaterial motion that he was launched. He stayed in London because it\nseemed to him he was there more conscious of what he had undertaken, and\nhe had a horror of shirking the consciousness. One element in it indeed\nwas his noting how little convenience he could have found in a foreign\njourney even had his judgement approved such a subterfuge. The stoppage\nof his supplies from Beauclere had now become an historic fact, with\nsomething of the majesty of its class about it: he had had time to see\nwhat a difference this would make in his life. His means were small and\nhe had several old debts, the number of which, as he believed, loomed\nlarge to his mother's imagination. He could never tell her she\nexaggerated, because he told her nothing of that sort in these days:\nthey had no intimate talk, for an impenetrable partition, a tall,\nbristling hedge of untrimmed misconceptions, had sprung up between them.\nPoor Biddy had made a hole in it through which she squeezed from side to\nside, to keep up communications, at the cost of many rents and\nscratches; but Lady Agnes walked straight and stiff, never turning her\nhead, never stopping to pluck the least little daisy of consolation. It\nwas in this manner she wished to signify that she had accepted her\nwrongs. She draped herself in them as in a Roman mantle and had never\nlooked so proud and wasted and handsome as now that her eyes rested only\non ruins.\n\nNick was extremely sorry for her, though he marked as a dreadful want of\ngrace her never setting a foot in Rosedale Road--she mentioned his\nstudio no more than if it had been a private gambling-house or something\nworse; sorry because he was well aware that for the hour everything must\nappear to her to have crumbled. The luxury of Broadwood would have to\ncrumble: his mind was very clear about that. Biddy's prospects had\nwithered to the finest, dreariest dust, and Biddy indeed, taking a\nlesson from her brother's perversities, seemed little disposed to better\na bad business. She professed the most peace-making sentiments, but when\nit came really to doing something to brighten up the scene she showed\nherself portentously corrupt. After Peter Sherringham's heartless flight\nshe had wantonly slighted an excellent opportunity to repair her\nmisfortune. Lady Agnes had reason to infer, about the end of June, that\nyoung Mr. Grindon, the only son--the other children being girls--of an\nimmensely rich industrial and political baronet in the north, was\nliterally waiting for the faintest sign. This reason she promptly\nimparted to her younger daughter, whose intelligence had to take it in\nbut who had shown it no other consideration. Biddy had set her charming\nface as a stone; she would have nothing to do with signs, and she,\npractically speaking, wilfully, wickedly refused a magnificent offer, so\nthat the young man carried his high expectations elsewhere. How much in\nearnest he had been was proved by the fact that before Goodwood had come\nand gone he was captured by Lady Muriel Macpherson. It was superfluous\nto insist on the frantic determination to get married written on such an\naccident as that. Nick knew of this episode only through Grace, and he\ndeplored its having occurred in the midst of other disasters.\n\nHe knew or he suspected something more as well--something about his\nbrother Percival which, should it come to light, no phase of their\ncommon history would be genial enough to gloss over. It had usually been\nsupposed that Percy's store of comfort against the ills of life was\nconfined to the infallibility of his rifle. He was not sensitive, and\nhis use of that weapon represented a resource against which common\nvisitations might have spent themselves. It had suddenly come to Nick's\nears, however, that he cultivated a concurrent support in the person of\na robust countrywoman, housed in an ivied corner of Warwickshire, in\nwhom he had long been interested and whom, without any flourish of\nmagnanimity, he had ended by making his wife. The situation of the\nlatest born of the pledges of this affection, a blooming boy--there had\nbeen two or three previously--was therefore perfectly regular and of a\nnature to make a difference in the worldly position, as the phrase ran,\nof his moneyless uncle. If there be degrees in the absolute and Percy\nhad an heir--others, moreover, supposedly following--Nick would have to\nregard himself as still more moneyless than before. His brother's last\nstep was doubtless, given the case, to be commended; but such\ndiscoveries were enlivening only when made in other families, and Lady\nAgnes would scarcely enjoy learning to what tune she had become a\ngrandmother.\n\nNick forbore from delicacy to intimate to Biddy that he thought it a\npity she couldn't care for Mr. Grindon; but he had a private sense that\nif she had been capable of such a feat it would have lightened a little\nthe weight he himself had to carry. He bore her a slight grudge, which\nlasted till Julia Dallow came back; when the circumstance of the girl's\nbeing summoned immediately down to Harsh created a diversion that was\nperhaps after all only fanciful. Biddy, as we know, entertained a\ntheory, which Nick had found occasion to combat, that Mrs. Dallow had\nnot treated him perfectly well; therefore in going to Harsh the very\nfirst time that relative held out a hand to her so jealous a little\nsister must have recognised a special inducement. The inducement might\nhave been that the relative had comfort for her, that she was acting by\nher cousin's direct advice, that they were still in close communion on\nthe question of the offers Biddy was not to accept, that in short\nPeter's sister had taken upon herself to see that their young friend\nshould remain free for the day of the fugitive's inevitable return. Once\nor twice indeed Nick wondered if Julia had herself been visited, in a\nlarger sense, by the thought of retracing her steps--if she wished to\ndraw out her young friend's opinion as to how she might do that\ngracefully. During the few days she was in town Nick had seen her twice\nin Great Stanhope Street, but neither time alone. She had said to him on\none of these occasions in her odd, explosive way: \"I should have thought\nyou'd have gone away somewhere--it must be such a bore.\" Of course she\nfirmly believed he was staying for Miriam, which he really was not; and\nprobably she had written this false impression off to Peter, who, still\nmore probably, would prefer to regard it as just. Nick was staying for\nMiriam only in the sense that he should very glad of the money he might\nreceive for the portrait he was engaged in painting. That money would be\na great convenience to him in spite of the obstructive ground Miriam had\ntaken in pretending--she had blown half a gale about it--that he had\nhad no right to dispose of such a production without her consent. His\nanswer to this was simply that the purchaser was so little of a stranger\nthat it didn't go, so to speak, out of the family, out of hers. It\ndidn't matter, Miriam's retort that if Mr. Sherringham had formerly been\nno stranger he was utterly one now, so that nothing would ever less\ndelight him than to see her hated image on his wall. He would back out\nof the bargain and Nick be left with the picture on his hands. Nick\njeered at this shallow theory and when she came to sit the question\nserved as well as another to sprinkle their familiar silences with\nchaff. He already knew something, as we have seen, of the conditions in\nwhich his distracted kinsman had left England; and this connected\nitself, in casual meditation, with some of the calculations imputable to\nJulia and to Biddy. There had naturally been a sequel to the queer\nbehaviour perceptible in Peter, at the theatre, on the eve of his\ndeparture--a sequel lighted by a word of Miriam's in the course of her\nfirst sitting to Nick after her great night. \"Fancy\"--so this\nobservation ran--\"fancy the dear man finding time in the press of all\nhis last duties to ask me to marry him!\"\n\n\"He told me you had found time in the press of all yours to say you\nwould,\" Nick replied. And this was pretty much all that had passed on\nthe subject between them--save of course her immediately making clear\nthat Peter had grossly misinformed him. What had happened was that she\nhad said she would do nothing of the sort. She professed a desire not to\nbe confronted again with this obnoxious theme, and Nick easily fell in\nwith it--quite from his own settled inclination not to handle that kind\nof subject with her. If Julia had false ideas about him, and if Peter\nhad them too, his part of the business was to take the simplest course\nto establish the falsity. There were difficulties indeed attached even\nto the simplest course, but there would be a difficulty the less if one\nshould forbear to meddle in promiscuous talk with the general,\nsuggestive topic of intimate unions. It is certain that in these days\nNick cultivated the practice of forbearances for which he didn't\nreceive, for which perhaps he never would receive, due credit.\n\nHe had been convinced for some time that one of the next things he\nshould hear would be that Julia Dallow had arranged to marry either Mr.\nMacgeorge or some other master of multitudes. He could think of that\nnow, he found--think of it with resignation even when Julia, before his\neyes, looked so handsomely forgetful that her appearance had to be taken\nas referring still more to their original intimacy than to his\ncomparatively superficial offence. What made this accomplishment of his\nown remarkable was that there was something else he thought of quite as\nmuch--the fact that he had only to see her again to feel by how great a\ncharm she had in the old days taken possession of him. This charm\noperated apparently in a very direct, primitive way: her presence\ndiffused it and fully established it, but her absence left comparatively\nlittle of it behind. It dwelt in the very facts of her person--it was\nsomething she happened physically to be; yet--considering that the\nquestion was of something very like loveliness--its envelope of\nassociations, of memories and recurrences, had no great destiny. She\npacked it up and took it away with her quite as if she had been a woman\nwho had come to sell a set of laces. The laces were as wonderful as ever\nwhen taken out of the box, but to admire again their rarity you had to\nsend for the woman. What was above all remarkable for our young man was\nthat Miriam Rooth fetched a fellow, vulgarly speaking, very much less\nthan Julia at the times when, being on the spot, Julia did fetch. He\ncould paint Miriam day after day without any agitating blur of vision;\nin fact the more he saw of her the clearer grew the atmosphere through\nwhich she blazed, the more her richness became one with that of the\nflowering work. There are reciprocities and special sympathies in such a\nrelation; mysterious affinities they used to be called, divinations of\nprivate congruity. Nick had an unexpressed conviction that if, according\nto his defeated desire, he had embarked with Mrs. Dallow in this\nparticular quest of a great prize, disaster would have overtaken them on\nthe deep waters. Even with the limited risk indeed disaster had come;\nbut it was of a different kind and it had the advantage for him that now\nshe couldn't reproach and denounce him as the cause of it--couldn't do\nso at least on any ground he was obliged to recognise. She would never\nknow how much he had cared for her, how much he cared for her still;\ninasmuch as the conclusive proof for himself was his conscious\nreluctance to care for another woman--evidence she positively misread.\nSome day he would doubtless try to do that; but such a day seemed as yet\nfar off, and he had meanwhile no spite, no vindictive impulse, to help\nhim. The soreness that mingled with his liberation, the sense of\nindignity even, as of a full cup suddenly dashed by a blundering hand\nfrom his lips, demanded certainly a balm; but it found the balm, for the\ntime, in another passion, not in a rancorous exercise of the same--a\npassion strong enough to make him forget what a pity it was he was not\nso formed as to care for two women at once.\n\nAs soon as Julia returned to England he broke ground to his mother on\nthe subject of her making the mistress of Broadwood understand that she\nand the girls now regarded their occupancy of that estate as absolutely\nover. He had already, several weeks before, picked a little at the arid\ntract of that indicated surrender, but in the interval the soil appeared\nto have formed again to a considerable thickness. It was disagreeable to\nhim to call his parent's attention to the becoming course, and\nespecially disagreeable to have to emphasise it and discuss it and\nperhaps clamour for it. He would have liked the whole business to be\ntacit--a little triumph of silent delicacy. But he found reasons to\nsuspect that what in fact would be most tacit was Julia's certain\nendurance of any chance failure of that charm. Lady Agnes had a theory\nthat they had virtually--\"practically\" as she said--given up the place,\nso that there was no need of making a splash about it; but Nick\ndiscovered in the course of an exploration of Biddy's view more rigorous\nperhaps than any to which he had ever subjected her, that none of their\nproperty had been removed from the delightful house--none of the things\n(there were ever so many things) heavily planted there when their mother\ntook possession. Lady Agnes was the proprietor of innumerable articles\nof furniture, relics and survivals of her former greatness, and moved\nabout the world with a train of heterogeneous baggage; so that her quiet\noverflow into the spaciousness of Broadwood had had all the luxury of a\nfinal subsidence. What Nick had to propose to her now was a dreadful\ncombination, a relapse into the conditions she most hated--seaside\nlodgings, bald storehouses in the Marylebone Road, little London rooms\ncrammed with objects that caught the dirt and made them stuffy. He was\nafraid he should really finish her, and he himself was surprised in a\ndegree at his insistence. He wouldn't have supposed he should have cared\nso much, but he found he did care intensely. He cared enough--it says\neverything--to explain to his mother that her retention of Broadwood\nwould show \"practically\" (since that was her great word) for the\nviolation of an agreement. Julia had given them the place on the\nunderstanding that he was to marry her, and once he was definitely not\nto marry her they had no right to keep the place. \"Yes, you make the\nmess and _we_ pay the penalty!\" the poor lady flashed out; but this was\nthe only overt protest she made--except indeed to contend that their\nwithdrawal would be an act ungracious and offensive to Julia. She looked\nas she had looked during the months that succeeded his father's death,\nbut she gave a general, a final grim assent to the proposition that, let\ntheir kinswoman take it as she would, their own duty was unmistakably\nclear.\n\nIt was Grace who was principal representative of the idea that Julia\nwould be outraged by such a step; she never ceased to repeat that she\nhad never heard of anything so \"nasty.\" Nick would have expected this of\nGrace, but he felt rather bereft and betrayed when Biddy murmured to him\nthat _she_ knew--that there was really no need of their sacrificing\ntheir mother's comfort to an extravagant scruple. She intimated that if\nNick would only consent to their going on with Broadwood as if nothing\nhad happened--or rather as if everything had happened--she would answer\nfor the feelings of the owner. For almost the first time in his life\nNick disliked what Biddy said to him, and he gave her a sharp rejoinder,\na taste of the general opinion that they all had enough to do to answer\nfor themselves. He remembered afterwards the way she looked at\nhim--startled, even frightened and with rising tears--before turning\naway. He held that they should judge better how Julia would take it\nafter they had thrown up the place; and he made it his duty to arrange\nthat his mother should formally advise her, by letter, of their\nintending to depart at once. Julia could then protest to her heart's\ncontent. Nick was aware that for the most part he didn't pass for\npractical; he could imagine why, from his early years, people should\nhave joked him about it. But this time he was determined to rest on a\nrigid view of things as they were. He didn't sec his mother's letter,\nbut he knew that it went. He felt she would have been more loyal if she\nhad shown it to him, though of course there could be but little question\nof loyalty now. That it had really been written, however, very much on\nthe lines he dictated was clear to him from the subsequent surprise\nwhich Lady Agnes's blankness didn't prevent his divining.\n\nJulia acknowledged the offered news, but in unexpected terms: she had\napparently neither resisted nor protested; she had simply been very glad\nto get her house back again and had not accused any of them of\nnastiness. Nick saw no more of her letter than he had seen of his\nmother's, but he was able to say to Grace--to their parent he was\nstudiously mute--\"My poor child, you see after all that we haven't\nkicked up such a row.\" Grace shook her head and looked gloomy and deeply\nwise, replying that he had no cause to triumph--they were so far from\nhaving seen the end of it yet. Thus he guessed that his mother had\ncomplied with his wish on the calculation that it would be a mere form,\nthat Julia would entreat them not to be so fantastic and that he himself\nwould then, in the presence of her wounded surprise, consent to a quiet\ncontinuance, so much in the interest--the air of Broadwood had a\npurity!--of the health of all of them. But since Julia jumped at their\nsacrifice he had no chance to be mollified: he had all grossly to\npersist in having been right.\n\nAt bottom probably he was a little surprised at Julia's so prompt\nassent. Literally speaking, it was not perfectly graceful. He was sorry\nhis mother had been so deceived, but was sorrier still for Biddy's\nmistake--it showed she might be mistaken about other things. Nothing was\nleft now but for Lady Agnes to say, as she did substantially whenever\nshe saw him: \"We're to prepare to spend the autumn at Worthing then or\nsome other horrible place? I don't know their names: it's the only thing\nwe can afford.\" There was an implication in this that if he expected her\nto drag her girls about to country-houses in a continuance of the\nfidgety effort to work them off he must understand at once that she was\nnow too weary and too sad and too sick. She had done her best for them\nand it had all been vain and cruel--now therefore the poor creatures\nmust look out for themselves. To the grossness of Biddy's misconduct she\nneedn't refer, nor to the golden opportunity that young woman had\nforfeited by her odious treatment of Mr. Grindon. It was clear that this\ntime Lady Agnes was incurably discouraged; so much so as to fail to\nglean the dimmest light from the fact that the girl was really making a\nlong stay at Harsh. Biddy went to and fro two or three times and then in\nAugust fairly settled there; and what her mother mainly saw in her\nabsence was the desire to keep out of the way of household reminders of\nher depravity. In fact, as turned out, Lady Agnes and Grace gathered\nthemselves together in the first days of that month for another visit to\nthe very old lady who had been Sir Nicholas's godmother; after which\nthey went somewhere else--so that the question of Worthing had not\nimmediately to be faced.\n\nNick stayed on in London with the obsession of work humming in his ears;\nhe was joyfully conscious that for three or four months, in the empty\nBabylon, he would have ample stores of time. But toward the end of\nAugust he got a letter from Grace in which she spoke of her situation\nand of her mother's in a manner that seemed to impose on him the doing\nof something tactful. They were paying a third visit--he knew that in\nCalcutta Gardens lady's-maids had been to and fro with boxes,\nreplenishments of wardrobes--and yet somehow the outlook for the autumn\nwas dark. Grace didn't say it in so many words, but what he read between\nthe lines was that they had no more invitations. What, therefore, in\npity's name was to become of them? People liked them well enough when\nBiddy was with them, but they didn't care for her mother and her, that\nprospect _tout pur_, and Biddy was cooped up indefinitely with Julia.\nThis was not the manner in which Grace had anciently alluded to her\nsister's happy visits at Harsh, and the change of tone made Nick wince\nwith a sense of all that had collapsed. Biddy was a little fish worth\nlanding in short, scantly as she seemed disposed to bite, and Grace's\nrude probity could admit that she herself was not.\n\nNick had an inspiration: by way of doing something tactful he went down\nto Brighton and took lodgings, for several weeks, in the general\ninterest, the very quietest and sunniest he could find. This he intended\nas a kindly surprise, a reminder of how he had his mother's and sisters'\ncomfort at heart, how he could exert himself and save them trouble. But\nhe had no sooner concluded his bargain--it was a more costly one than he\nhad at first calculated--than he was bewildered and befogged to learn\nthat the persons on whose behalf he had so exerted himself were to pass\nthe autumn at Broadwood with Julia. That daughter of privilege had taken\nthe place into familiar use again and was now correcting their former\nsurprise at her crude indifference--this was infinitely characteristic\nof Julia--by inviting them to share it with her. Nick wondered vaguely\nwhat she was \"up to\"; but when his mother treated herself to the line\nirony of addressing him an elaborately humble request for his consent to\ntheir accepting the merciful refuge--she repeated this expression three\ntimes--he replied that she might do exactly as she liked: he would only\nmention that he shouldn't feel himself at liberty to come and see her\nthere. This condition proved apparently to Lady Agnes's mind no\nhindrance, and she and her daughters were presently reinstated in the\nvery apartments they had learned so to love. This time in fact it was\neven better than before--they had still fewer expenses. The expenses\nwere Nick's: he had to pay a forfeit to the landlady at Brighton for\nbacking out of his contract. He said nothing to his mother about that\nbungled business--he was literally afraid; but a sad event just then\nreminded him afresh how little it was the moment for squandering money.\nMr. Carteret drew his last breath; quite painlessly it seemed, as the\nclosing scene was described at Beauclere when the young man went down to\nthe funeral. Two or three weeks later the contents of his will were made\npublic in the _Illustrated London News_, where it definitely appeared\nthat he left a very large fortune, not a penny of which was to go to\nNick. The provision for Mr. Chayter's declining years was remarkably\nhandsome.\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII\n\n\nMiriam had mounted at a bound, in her new part, several steps in the\nladder of fame, and at the climax of the London season this fact was\nbrought home to her from hour to hour. It produced a thousand\nsolicitations and entanglements, and she rapidly learned that to be\ncelebrated takes up almost as much of one's own time as of other\npeople's. Even though, as she boasted, she had reduced to a science the\npractice of \"working\" her mother--she made use of the good lady socially\nto the utmost, pushing her perpetually into the breach--there was many a\njuncture at which it was clear that she couldn't too much disoblige\nwithout hurting her cause. She made almost an income out of the\nphotographers--their appreciation of her as a subject knew no\nbounds--and she supplied the newspapers with columns of characteristic\ncopy. To the gentlemen who sought speech of her on behalf of these\norgans she poured forth, vindictively, floods of unscrupulous romance;\nshe told them all different tales, and, as her mother told them others\nmore marvellous yet, publicity was cleverly caught by rival versions,\nwhich surpassed each other in authenticity. The whole case was\nremarkable, was unique; for if the girl was advertised by the\nbewilderment of her readers she seemed to every sceptic, on his going to\nsee her, as fine as if he had discovered her for himself. She was still\naccommodating enough, however, from time to time, to find an hour to\ncome and sit to Nick Dormer, and he helped himself further by going to\nher theatre whenever he could. He was conscious Julia Dallow would\nprobably hear of this and triumph with a fresh sense of how right she\nhad been; but the reflexion only made him sigh resignedly, so true it\nstruck him as being that there are some things explanation can never\nbetter, can never touch.\n\nMiriam brought Basil Dashwood once to see her portrait, and Basil, who\ncommended it in general, directed his criticism mainly to two\npoints--its not yet being finished and its not having gone into that\nyear's Academy. The young actor audibly panted; he felt the short breath\nof Miriam's rapidity, the quick beat of her success, and, looking at\neverything now from the standpoint of that speculation, could scarcely\ncontain his impatience at the painter's clumsy slowness. He thought the\nlatter's second attempt much better than his first, but somehow it ought\nby that time to be shining in the eye of the public. He put it to their\nfriend with an air of acuteness--he had those felicities--that in every\ngreat crisis there is nothing like striking while the iron is hot. He\neven betrayed the conviction that by putting on a spurt Nick might wind\nup the job and still get the Academy people to take him in. Basil knew\nsome of them; he all but offered to speak to them--the case was so\nexceptional; he had no doubt he could get something done. Against the\nappropriation of the work by Peter Sherringham he explicitly and loudly\nprotested, in spite of the homeliest recommendations of silence from\nMiriam; and it was indeed easy to guess how such an arrangement would\ninterfere with his own conception of the eventual right place for the\ntwo portraits--the vestibule of the theatre, where every one going in\nand out would see them suspended face to face and surrounded by\nphotographs, artistically disposed, of the young actress in a variety of\ncharacters. Dashwood showed superiority in his jump to the contention\nthat so exhibited the pictures would really help to draw. Considering\nthe virtue he attributed to Miriam the idea was exempt from narrow\nprejudice.\n\nMoreover, though a trifle feverish, he was really genial; he repeated\nmore than once, \"Yes, my dear sir, you've done it this time.\" This was a\nfavourite formula with him; when some allusion was made to the girl's\nsuccess he greeted it also with a comfortable \"This time she _has_ done\nit.\" There was ever a hint of fine judgement and far calculation in his\ntone. It appeared before he went that this time even he himself had done\nit--he had taken up something that would really answer. He told Nick\nmore about Miriam, more certainly about her outlook at that moment, than\nshe herself had communicated, contributing strongly to our young man's\nimpression that one by one every gage of a great career was being\ndropped into her cup. Nick himself tasted of success vicariously for the\nhour. Miriam let her comrade talk only to contradict him, and\ncontradicted him only to show how indifferently she could do it. She\ntreated him as if she had nothing more to learn about his folly, but as\nif it had taken intimate friendship to reveal to her the full extent of\nit. Nick didn't mind her intimate friendships, but he ended by disliking\nDashwood, who gave on his nerves--a circumstance poor Julia, had it come\nto her knowledge, would doubtless have found deplorably significant.\nMiriam was more pleased with herself than ever: she now made no scruple\nof admitting that she enjoyed all her advantages. She had a fuller\nvision of how successful success could be; she took everything as it\ncame--dined out every Sunday and even went into the country till the\nMonday morning; kept a hundred distinguished names on her lips and\nabounded in strange tales of the people who were making up to her. She\nstruck Nick as less strenuous than she had been hitherto, as making even\nan aggressive show of inevitable laxities; but he was conscious of no\nobligation to rebuke her for it--the less as he had a dim vision that\nsome effect of that sort, some irritation of his curiosity, was what she\ndesired to produce. She would perhaps have liked, for reasons best known\nto herself, to look as if she were throwing herself away, not being able\nto do anything else. He couldn't talk to her as if he took a deep\ninterest in her career, because in fact he didn't; she remained to him\nprimarily and essentially a pictorial object, with the nature of whose\nvicissitudes he was concerned--putting common charity and his personal\ngood nature of course aside--only so far as they had something to say in\nher face. How could he know in advance what turn of her experience,\ntwist of her life, would say most?--so possible was it even that\ncomplete failure or some incalculable perversion (innumerable were the\nqueer traps that might be set for her) would only make her for his\nparticular purpose more precious.\n\nWhen she had left him at any rate, the day she came with Basil Dashwood,\nand still more on a later occasion, that of his turning back to his work\nafter putting her into her carriage, and otherwise bare-headedly\nmanifesting, the last time, for that year apparently, that he was to see\nher--when she had left him it occurred to him in the light of her quick\ndistinction that there were deep differences in the famous artistic\nlife. Miriam was already in a glow of glory--which, moreover, was\nprobably but a faint spark in relation to the blaze to come; and as he\nclosed the door on her and took up his palette to rub it with a dirty\ncloth the little room in which his own battle was practically to be\nfought looked woefully cold and grey and mean. It was lonely and yet at\nthe same time was peopled with unfriendly shadows--so thick he foresaw\nthem gather in winter twilights to come--the duller conditions, the\nlonger patiences, the less immediate and less personal joys. His late\nbeginning was there and his wasted youth, the mistakes that would still\nbring forth children after their image, the sedentary solitude, the grey\nmediocrity, the poor explanations, the effect of foolishness he dreaded\neven from afar of in having to ask people to wait, and wait longer, and\nwait again, for a fruition which to their sense at least might well\nprove a grotesque anti-climax. He yearned enough over it, however it\nshould figure, to feel that this possible pertinacity might enter into\ncomparison even with such a productive force as Miriam's. That was after\nall in his bare studio the most collective dim presence, the one that\nkept him company best as he sat there and that made it the right place,\nhowever wrong--the sense that it was to the thing in itself he was\nattached. This was Miriam's case too, but the sharp contrast, which she\nshowed him she also felt, was in the number of other things she got with\nthe thing in itself.\n\nI hasten to add that our young man had hours when this last mystic value\nstruck him as requiring for its full operation no adjunct whatever--as\nbeing in its own splendour a summary of all adjuncts and apologies. I\nhave related that the great collections, the National Gallery and the\nMuseum, were sometimes rather a series of dead surfaces to him; but the\nsketch I have attempted of him will have been inadequate if it fails to\nsuggest that there were other days when, as he strolled through them, he\nplucked right and left perfect nosegays of reassurance. Bent as he was\non working in the modern, which spoke to him with a thousand voices, he\njudged it better for long periods not to haunt the earlier masters,\nwhose conditions had been so different--later he came to see that it\ndidn't matter much, especially if one kept away; but he was liable to\naccidental deflexions from this theory, liable in particular to feel the\nsanctity of the great portraits of the past. These were the things the\nmost inspiring, in the sense that while generations, while worlds had\ncome and gone, they seemed far most to prevail and survive and testify.\nAs he stood before them the perfection of their survival often struck\nhim as the supreme eloquence, the virtue that included all others,\nthanks to the language of art, the richest and most universal. Empires\nand systems and conquests had rolled over the globe and every kind of\ngreatness had risen and passed away, but the beauty of the great\npictures had known nothing of death or change, and the tragic centuries\nhad only sweetened their freshness. The same faces, the same figures\nlooked out at different worlds, knowing so many secrets the particular\nworld didn't, and when they joined hands they made the indestructible\nthread on which the pearls of history were strung.\n\nMiriam notified her artist that her theatre was to close on the tenth of\nAugust, immediately after which she was to start, with the company, on a\ntremendous tour of the provinces. They were to make a lot of money, but\nthey were to have no holiday, and she didn't want one; she only wanted\nto keep at it and make the most of her limited opportunities for\npractice; inasmuch as at that rate, playing but two parts a year--and\nsuch parts: she despised them!--she shouldn't have mastered the\nrudiments of her trade before decrepitude would compel her to lay it by.\nThe first time she came to the studio after her visit with Dashwood she\nsprang up abruptly at the end of half an hour, saying she could sit no\nmore--she had had enough and to spare of it. She was visibly restless\nand preoccupied, and though Nick had not waited till now to note that\nshe had more moods in her list than he had tints on his palette he had\nnever yet seen her sensibility at this particular pitch. It struck him\nrather as a waste of passion, but he was ready to let her go. She looked\nround the place as if suddenly tired of it and then said mechanically,\nin a heartless London way, while she smoothed down her gloves, \"So\nyou're just going to stay on?\" After he had confessed that this was his\ndark purpose she continued in the same casual, talk-making manner: \"I\ndaresay it's the best thing for you. You're just going to grind, eh?\"\n\n\"I see before me an eternity of grinding.\"\n\n\"All alone by yourself in this dull little hole? You _will_ be\nconscientious, you _will_ be virtuous.\"\n\n\"Oh my solitude will be mitigated--I shall have models and people.\"\n\n\"What people--what models?\" Miriam asked as she arranged her hat before\nthe glass.\n\n\"Well, no one so good as you.\"\n\n\"That's a prospect!\" the girl laughed--\"for all the good you've got out\nof me!\"\n\n\"You're no judge of that quantity,\" said Nick, \"and even I can't measure\nit just yet. Have I been rather a bore and a brute? I can easily believe\nit; I haven't talked to you--I haven't amused you as I might. The truth\nis that taking people's likenesses is a very absorbing, inhuman\noccupation. You can't do much to them besides.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a cruel honour to pay them.\"\n\n\"Cruel--that's too much,\" he objected.\n\n\"I mean it's one you shouldn't confer on those you like, for when it's\nover it's over: it kills your interest in them. After you've finished\nthem you don't like them any more at all.\"\n\n\"Surely I like _you_,\" Nick returned, sitting tilted back before his\npicture with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"We've done very well: it's something not to have quarrelled\"--and she\nsmiled at him now, seeming more \"in\" it. \"I wouldn't have had you slight\nyour work--I wouldn't have had you do it badly. But there's no fear of\nthat for you,\" she went on. \"You're the real thing and the rare bird. I\nhaven't lived with you this way without seeing that: you're the sincere\nartist so much more than I. No, no, don't protest,\" she added with one\nof her sudden, fine transitions to a deeper tone. \"You'll do things that\nwill hand on your name when my screeching is happily over. Only you do\nseem to me, I confess, rather high and dry here--I speak from the point\nof view of your comfort and of my personal interest in you. You strike\nme as kind of lonely, as the Americans say--rather cut off and isolated\nin your grandeur. Haven't you any confr\u00c3\u00a8res--fellow-artists and people\nof that sort? Don't they come near you?\"\n\n\"I don't know them much,\" Nick humbly confessed. \"I've always been\nafraid of them, and how can they take me seriously?\"\n\n\"Well, _I_'ve got confr\u00c3\u00a8res, and sometimes I wish I hadn't! But does\nyour sister never come near you any more,\" she asked, \"or is it only the\nfear of meeting me?\"\n\nHe was aware of his mother's theory that Biddy was constantly bundled\nhome from Rosedale Road at the approach of improper persons: she was as\nangry at this as if she wouldn't have been more so had her child\nsuffered exposure; but the explanation he gave his present visitor was\nnearer the truth. He reminded her that he had already told her--he had\nbeen careful to do this, so as not to let it appear she was\navoided--that his sister was now most of the time in the country,\nstaying with an hospitable relation.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" the girl rejoined to this, \"with Mr. Sherringham's sister,\nMrs.--what's her name? I always forget.\" And when he had pronounced the\nword with a reluctance he doubtless failed sufficiently to conceal--he\nhated to talk of Julia by any name and didn't know what business Miriam\nhad with her--she went on: \"That's the one--the beauty, the wonderful\nbeauty. I shall never forget how handsome she looked the day she found\nme here. I don't in the least resemble her, but I should like to have a\ntry at that type some day in a comedy of manners. But who the devil will\nwrite me a comedy of manners? There it is! The danger would be, no\ndoubt, that I should push her _\u00c3\u00a0 la charge_.\"\n\nNick listened to these remarks in silence, saying to himself that if she\nshould have the bad taste--which she seemed trembling on the brink\nof--to make an allusion to what had passed between the lady in question\nand himself he should dislike her beyond remedy. It would show him she\nwas a coarse creature after all. Her good genius interposed, however, as\nagainst this hard penalty, and she quickly, for the moment at least,\nwhisked away from the topic, demanding, since they spoke of comrades and\nvisitors, what had become of Gabriel Nash, whom she hadn't heard of for\nso many days.\n\n\"I think he's tired of me,\" said Nick; \"he hasn't been near me either.\nBut after all it's natural--he has seen me through.\"\n\n\"Seen you through? Do you mean,\" she laughed, \"seen through you? Why\nyou've only just begun.\"\n\n\"Precisely, and at bottom he doesn't like to see me begin. He's afraid I\nshall do something.\"\n\nShe wondered--as with the interest of that. \"Do you mean he's jealous?\"\n\n\"Not in the least, for from the moment one does anything one ceases to\ncompete with him. It leaves him the field more clear. But that's just\nthe discomfort for him--he feels, as you said just now, kind of lonely:\nhe feels rather abandoned and even, I think, a little betrayed. So far\nfrom being jealous he yearns for me and regrets me. The only thing he\nreally takes seriously is to speculate and understand, to talk about the\nreasons and the essence of things: the people who do that are the\nhighest. The applications, the consequences, the vulgar little effects,\nbelong to a lower plane, for which one must doubtless be tolerant and\nindulgent, but which is after all an affair of comparative accidents and\ntrifles. Indeed he'll probably tell me frankly the next time I see him\nthat he can't but feel that to come down to small questions of\naction--to the small prudences and compromises and simplifications of\npractice--is for the superior person really a fatal descent. One may be\ninoffensive and even commendable after it, but one can scarcely pretend\nto be interesting. '_Il en faut comme \u00c3\u00a7a_,' but one doesn't haunt them.\nHe'll do his best for me; he'll come back again, but he'll come back\nsad, and finally he'll fade away altogether. Hell go off to Granada or\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"The simplifications of practice?\" cried Miriam. \"Why they're just\nprecisely the most blessed things on earth. What should we do without\nthem?\"\n\n\"What indeed?\" Nick echoed. \"But if we need them it's because we're not\nsuperior persons. We're awful Philistines.\"\n\n\"I'll be one with _you_,\" the girl smiled. \"Poor Nash isn't worth\ntalking about. What was it but a small question of action when he\npreached to you, as I know he did, to give up your seat?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has a weakness for giving up--he'll go with you as far as that.\nBut I'm not giving up any more, you see. I'm pegging away, and that's\ngross.\"\n\n\"He's an idiot--_n'en parlons plus_!\" she dropped, gathering up her\nparasol but lingering.\n\n\"Ah I stick to him,\" Nick said. \"He helped me at a difficult time.\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed to confess it.\"\n\n\"Oh you _are_ a Philistine!\" Nick returned.\n\n\"Certainly I am,\" she declared, going toward the door--\"if it makes me\none to be sorry, awfully sorry and even rather angry, that I haven't\nbefore me a period of the same sort of unsociable pegging away that you\nhave. For want of it I shall never really be good. However, if you don't\ntell people I've said so they'll never know. Your conditions are far\nbetter than mine and far more respectable: you can do as many things as\nyou like in patient obscurity while I'm pitchforked into the _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_ and\ninto the most improbable fame--all on the back of a solitary _cheval de\nbataille_, a poor broken-winded screw. I read it clear that I shall be\ncondemned for the greater part of the rest of my days--do you see\nthat?--to play the stuff I'm acting now. I'm studying Juliet and I want\nawfully to do her, but really I'm mortally afraid lest, making a success\nof her, I should find myself in such a box. Perhaps the brutes would\nwant Juliet for ever instead of my present part. You see amid what\ndelightful alternatives one moves. What I long for most I never shall\nhave had--five quiet years of hard all-round work in a perfect company,\nwith a manager more perfect still, playing five hundred things and never\nbeing heard of at all. I may be too particular, but that's what I should\nhave liked. I think I'm disgusting with my successful crudities. It's\ndiscouraging; it makes one not care much what happens. What's the use,\nin such an age, of being good?\"\n\n\"Good? Your haughty claim,\" Nick laughed, \"is that you're bad.\"\n\n\"I mean _good_, you know--there are other ways. Don't be stupid.\" And\nMiriam tapped him--he was near her at the door--with her parasol.\n\n\"I scarcely know what to say to you,\" he logically pleaded, \"for\ncertainly it's your fault if you get on so fast.\"\n\n\"I'm too clever--I'm a humbug.\"\n\n\"That's the way I used to be,\" said Nick.\n\nShe rested her brave eyes on him, then turned them over the room slowly;\nafter which she attached them again, kindly, musingly--rather as if he\nhad been a fine view or an interesting object--to his face. \"Ah, the\npride of that--the sense of purification! He 'used' to be forsooth! Poor\nme! Of course you'll say, 'Look at the sort of thing I've undertaken to\nproduce compared with the rot you have.' So it's all right. Become great\nin the proper way and don't expose me.\" She glanced back once more at\nthe studio as if to leave it for ever, and gave another last look at the\nunfinished canvas on the easel. She shook her head sadly, \"Poor Mr.\nSherringham--with _that_!\" she wailed.\n\n\"Oh I'll finish it--it will be very decent,\" Nick said.\n\n\"Finish it by yourself?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. You'll come back and sit when you return to London.\"\n\n\"Never, never, never again.\"\n\nHe wondered. \"Why you've made me the most profuse offers and promises.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they were made in ignorance and I've backed out of them. I'm\ncapricious too--_faites la part de \u00c3\u00a7a_. I see it wouldn't do--I didn't\nknow it then. We're too far apart--I _am_, as you say, a Philistine.\"\nAnd as he protested with vehemence against this unscrupulous bad faith\nshe added: \"You'll find other models. Paint Gabriel Nash.\"\n\n\"Gabriel Nash--as a substitute for you?\"\n\n\"It will be a good way to get rid of him. Paint Mrs. Dallow too,\" Miriam\nwent on as she passed out of the door he had opened for her--\"paint Mrs.\nDallow if you wish to eradicate the last possibility of a throb.\"\n\nIt was strange that, since only a moment before he had been in a state\nof mind to which the superfluity of this reference would have been the\nclearest thing about it, he should now have been moved to receive it\nquickly, naturally, irreflectively, receive it with the question: \"The\nlast possibility? Do you mean in her or in me?\"\n\n\"Oh in you. I don't know anything about 'her.'\"\n\n\"But that wouldn't be the effect,\" he argued with the same supervening\ncandour. \"I believe that if she were to sit to me the usual law would be\nreversed.\"\n\n\"The usual law?\"\n\n\"Which you cited a while since and of which I recognised the general\ntruth. In the case you speak of,\" he said, \"I should probably make a\nshocking picture.\"\n\n\"And fall in love with her again? Then for God's sake risk the daub!\"\nMiriam laughed out as she floated away to her victoria.\n\n\n\n\nXLIX\n\n\nShe had guessed happily in saying to him that to offer to paint Gabriel\nNash would be the way to get rid of that visitant. It was with no such\ninvidious purpose indeed that our young man proposed to his intermittent\nfriend to sit; rather, as August was dusty in the London streets, he had\ntoo little hope that Nash would remain in town at such a time to oblige\nhim. Nick had no wish to get rid of his private philosopher; he liked\nhis philosophy, and though of course premeditated paradox was the light\nto read him by he yet had frequently and incidentally an inspired\nunexpectedness. He remained in Rosedale Road the man who most produced\nby his presence the effect of company. All the other men of Nick's\nacquaintance, all his political friends, represented, often very\ncommunicatively, their own affairs, their own affairs alone; which when\nthey did it well was the most their host could ask of them. But Nash had\nthe rare distinction that he seemed somehow to figure _his_ affairs, the\nsaid host's, and to show an interest in them unaffected by the ordinary\nsocial limitations of capacity. This relegated him to the class of high\nluxuries, and Nick was well aware that we hold our luxuries by a fitful\nand precarious tenure. If a friend without personal eagerness was one of\nthe greatest of these it would be evident to the simplest mind that by\nthe law of distribution of earthly boons such a convenience should be\nexpected to forfeit in duration what it displayed in intensity. He had\nnever been without a suspicion that Nash was too good to last, though\nfor that matter nothing had yet confirmed a vague apprehension that his\nparticular manner of breaking up or breaking down would be by his\nwishing to put so fresh a recruit in relation with other disciples.\n\nThat would practically amount to a catastrophe, Nick felt; for it was\nodd that one could both have a great kindness for him and not in the\nleast, when it came to the point, yearn for a view of his personal\nextensions. His originality had always been that he appeared to have\nnone; and if in the first instance he had introduced his bright, young,\npolitical prodigy to Miriam and her mother, that was an exception for\nwhich Peter Sherringham's interference had been mainly responsible. All\nthe same, however, it was some time before Nick ceased to view it as\nperhaps on the awkward books that, to complete his education as it were,\nGabriel would wish him to converse a little with spirits formed by a\nlike tonic discipline. Nick had an instinct, in which there was no\nconsciousness of detriment to Nash, that the pupils, possibly even the\nimitators, of such a genius would be, as he mentally phrased it,\nsomething awful. He could be sure, even Gabriel himself could be sure,\nof his own reservations, but how could either of them be sure of those\nof others? Imitation is a fortunate homage only in proportion as it\nrests on measurements, and there was an indefinable something in Nash's\ndoctrine that would have been discredited by exaggeration or by zeal.\nProvidence happily appeared to have spared it this ordeal; so that Nick\nhad after months still to remind himself how his friend had never\npressed on his attention the least little group of fellow-mystics, never\noffered to produce them for his edification. It scarcely mattered now\nthat he was just the man to whom the superficial would attribute that\nsort of tail: it would probably have been hard, for example, to persuade\nLady Agnes or Julia Dallow or Peter Sherringham that he was not most at\nhome in some dusky, untidy, dimly-imagined suburb of \"culture,\" a region\npeopled by unpleasant phrasemongers who thought him a gentleman and who\nhad no human use but to be held up in the comic press--which was,\nmoreover, probably restrained by decorum from touching upon the worst of\ntheir aberrations.\n\nNick at any rate never ran his academy to earth nor so much as skirted\nthe suburb in question; never caught from the impenetrable background of\nhis life the least reverberation of flitting or of flirting, the\nfainting esthetic ululation. There had been moments when he was even\nmoved to anxiety by the silence that poor Gabriel's own faculty of sound\nmade all about him--when at least it reduced to plainer elements (the\nmere bald terms of lonely singleness and thrift, of the lean philosophic\nlife) the mystery he could never wholly dissociate from him, the air as\nof the transient and occasional, the likeness to curling vapour or\nmurmuring wind or shifting light. It was, for instance, a symbol of this\nunclassified state, the lack of all position as a name in cited lists,\nthat Nick in point of fact had no idea where he lived, would not have\nknown how to go and see him or send him a doctor if he had heard he was\nill. He had never walked with him to any door of Gabriel's own, even to\npause at the threshold, though indeed Nash had a club, the Anonymous, in\nsome improbable square, of which he might be suspected of being the only\nmember--one had never heard of another--where it was vaguely understood\nletters would some day or other find him. Fortunately he pressed with\nno sharpness the spring of pity--his whole \"form\" was so easy a grasp\nof the helm of consciousness, which he would never let go. He would\nnever consent to any deformity, but would steer his course straight\nthrough the eventual narrow pass and simply go down over the horizon.\n\nHe in any case turned up Rosedale Road one day after Miriam had left\nLondon; he had just come back from a fortnight in Brittany, where he had\ndrawn refreshment from the tragic sweetness of--well, of everything. He\nwas on his way somewhere else--was going abroad for the autumn but was\nnot particular what he did, professing that he had come back just to get\nNick utterly off his mind. \"It's very nice, it's very nice; yes, yes, I\nsee,\" he remarked, giving a little, general, assenting sigh as his eyes\nwandered over the simple scene--a sigh which for a suspicious ear would\nhave testified to an insidious reaction.\n\nNick's ear, as we know, was already suspicious; a fact accounting for\nthe expectant smile--it indicated the pleasant apprehension of a theory\nconfirmed--with which he returned: \"Do you mean my pictures are nice?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, your pictures and the whole thing.\"\n\n\"The whole thing?\"\n\n\"Your existence in this little, remote, independent corner of the great\ncity. The disinterestedness of your attitude, the persistence of your\neffort, the piety, the beauty, in short the edification, of the whole\nspectacle.\"\n\nNick laughed a little ruefully. \"How near to having had enough of me you\nmust be when you speak of me as edifying!\" Nash changed colour slightly\nat this; it was the first time in his friend's remembrance that he had\ngiven a sign of embarrassment. \"_Vous allez me l\u00c3\u00a2cher_, I see it coming;\nand who can blame you?--for I've ceased to be in the least spectacular.\nI had my little hour; it was a great deal, for some people don't even\nhave that. I've given you your curious case and I've been generous; I\nmade the drama last for you as long as I could. You'll 'slope,' my dear\nfellow--you'll quietly slope; and it will be all right and inevitable,\nthough I shall miss you greatly at first. Who knows whether without you\nI shouldn't still have been 'representing' Harsh, heaven help me? You\nrescued me; you converted me from a representative into an\nexample--that's a shade better. But don't I know where you must be when\nyou're reduced to praising my piety?\"\n\n\"Don't turn me away,\" said Nash plaintively; \"give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"I shall never dream of turning you away; I shall cherish you till the\nlatest possible hour. I'm only trying to keep myself in tune with the\nlogic of things. The proof of how I cling is that precisely I want you\nto sit to me.\"\n\n\"To sit to you?\" With which Nick could fancy his visitor a little blank.\n\n\"Certainly, for after all it isn't much to ask. Here we are and the\nhour's peculiarly propitious--long light days with no one coming near\nme, so that I've plenty of time. I had a hope I should have some orders:\nmy younger sister, whom you know and who's a great optimist, plied me\nwith that vision. In fact we invented together a charming little sordid\ntheory that there might be rather a 'run' on me from the chatter (such\nas it was) produced by my taking up this line. My sister struck out the\nidea that a good many of the pretty ladies would think me interesting\nand would want to be done. Perhaps they do, but they've controlled\nthemselves, for I can't say the run has commenced. They haven't even\ncome to look, but I daresay they don't yet quite take it in. Of course\nit's a bad time--with every one out of town; though you know they might\nsend for me to come and do them at home. Perhaps they will when they\nsettle down. A portrait-tour of a dozen country-houses for the autumn\nand winter--what do you say to that for the ardent life? I know I\nexcruciate you,\" Nick added, \"but don't you see how it's in my interest\nto try how much you'll still stand?\"\n\nGabriel puffed his cigarette with a serenity so perfect that it might\nhave been assumed to falsify these words. \"Mrs. Dallow will send for\nyou--_vous allez voir \u00c3\u00a7a_,\" he said in a moment, brushing aside all\nvagueness.\n\n\"She'll send for me?\"\n\n\"To paint her portrait; she'll recapture you on that basis. She'll get\nyou down to one of the country-houses, and it will all go off as\ncharmingly--with sketching in the morning, on days you can't hunt, and\nanything you like in the afternoon, and fifteen courses in the evening;\nthere'll be bishops and ambassadors staying--as if you were a\n'well-known,' awfully clever amateur. Take care, take care, for, fickle\nas you may think me, I can read the future: don't imagine you've come to\nthe end of me yet. Mrs. Dallow and your sister, of both of whom I speak\nwith the greatest respect, are capable of hatching together the most\nconscientious, delightful plan for you. Your differences with the\nbeautiful lady will be patched up and you'll each come round a little\nand meet the other halfway. The beautiful lady will swallow your\nprofession if you'll swallow hers. She'll put up with the palette if\nyou'll put up with the country-house. It will be a very unusual one in\nwhich you won't find a good north room where you can paint. You'll go\nabout with her and do all her friends, all the bishops and ambassadors,\nand you'll eat your cake and have it, and every one, beginning with your\nwife, will forget there's anything queer about you, and everything will\nbe for the best in the best of worlds; so that, together--you and\nshe--you'll become a great social institution and every one will think\nshe has a delightful husband; to say nothing of course of your having a\ndelightful wife. Ah my dear fellow, you turn pale, and with reason!\"\nNash went lucidly on: \"that's to pay you for having tried to make me let\nyou have it. You have it then there! I may be a bore\"--the emphasis of\nthis, though a mere shade, testified to the first personal resentment\nNick had ever heard his visitor express--\"I may be a bore, but once in a\nwhile I strike a light, I make things out. Then I venture to repeat,\n'Take care, take care.' If, as I say, I respect _ces dames_ infinitely\nit's because they will be acting according to the highest wisdom of\ntheir sex. That's the sort of thing women do for a man--the sort of\nthing they invent when they're exceptionally good and clever. When\nthey're not they don't do so well; but it's not for want of trying.\nThere's only one thing in the world better than their incomparable\ncharm: it's their abysmal conscience. Deep calleth unto deep--the one's\nindeed a part of the other. And when they club together, when they\nearnestly consider, as in the case we're supposing,\" Nash continued,\n\"then the whole thing takes a lift; for it's no longer the virtue of the\nindividual, it's that of the wondrous sex.\"\n\n\"You're so remarkable that, more than ever, I must paint you,\" Nick\nreturned, \"though I'm so agitated by your prophetic words that my hand\ntrembles and I shall doubtless scarcely be able to hold my brush. Look\nhow I rattle my easel trying to put it into position. I see it all there\njust as you show it. Yes, it will be a droll day, and more modern than\nanything yet, when the conscience of women makes out good reasons for\nmen's not being in love with them. You talk of their goodness and\ncleverness, and it's certainly much to the point. I don't know what else\nthey themselves might do with those graces, but I don't see what man can\ndo with them but be fond of them where he finds them.\"\n\n\"Oh you'll do it--you'll do it!\" cried Nash, brightly jubilant.\n\n\"What is it I shall do?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I just said; if not next year then the year after, or the\nyear after that. You'll go halfway to meet her and she'll drag you about\nand pass you off. You'll paint the bishops and become a social\ninstitution. That is, you'll do it if you don't take great care.\"\n\n\"I shall, no doubt, and that's why I cling to you. You must still look\nafter me,\" Nick went on. \"Don't melt away into a mere improbable\nreminiscence, a delightful, symbolic fable--don't if you can possibly\nhelp it. The trouble is, you see, that you can't really keep hold very\ntight, because at bottom it will amuse you much more to see me in\nanother pickle than to find me simply jogging down the vista of the\nyears on the straight course. Let me at any rate have some sort of\nsketch of you as a kind of feather from the angel's wing or a photograph\nof the ghost--to prove to me in the future that you were once a solid\nsociable fact, that I didn't invent you, didn't launch you as a deadly\nhoax. Of course I shall be able to say to myself that you can't have\nbeen a fable--otherwise you'd have a moral; but that won't be enough,\nbecause I'm not sure you won't have had one. Some day you'll peep in\nhere languidly and find me in such an attitude of piety--presenting my\nbent back to you as I niggle over some interminable botch--that I shall\ngive cruelly on your nerves and you'll just draw away, closing the door\nsoftly. You'll be gentle and considerate about it and spare me, you\nwon't even make me look round. You'll steal off on tiptoe, never, never\nto return.\"\n\nGabriel consented to sit; he professed he should enjoy it and be glad to\ngive up for it his immediate foreign commerce, so vague to Nick, so\ndefinite apparently to himself; and he came back three times for the\npurpose. Nick promised himself a deal of interest from this experiment,\nfor with the first hour of it he began to feel that really as yet, given\nthe conditions under which he now studied him, he had never at all\nthoroughly explored his friend. His impression had been that Nash had a\nhead quite fine enough to be a challenge, and that as he sat there day\nby day all sorts of pleasant and paintable things would come out in his\nface. This impression was not gainsaid, but the whole tangle grew\ndenser. It struck our young man that he had never _seen_ his subject\nbefore, and yet somehow this revelation was not produced by the sense of\nactually seeing it. What was revealed was the difficulty--what he saw\nwas not the measurable mask but the ambiguous meaning. He had taken\nthings for granted which literally were not there, and he found things\nthere--except that he couldn't catch them--which he had not hitherto\ncounted in or presumed to handle. This baffling effect, eminently in the\nline of the mystifying, so familiar to Nash, might have been the result\nof his whimsical volition, had it not appeared to our artist, after a\nfew hours of the job, that his sitter was not the one who enjoyed it\nmost. He was uncomfortable, at first vaguely and then definitely\nso--silent, restless, gloomy, dim, as if on the test the homage of a\ndirecter attention than he had ever had gave him less pleasure than he\nwould have supposed. He had been willing to judge of this in good\nfaith; but frankly he rather suffered. He wasn't cross, but was clearly\nunhappy, and Nick had never before felt him contract instead of\nexpanding.\n\nIt was all accordingly as if a trap had been laid for him, and our young\nman asked himself if it were really fair. At the same time there was\nsomething richly rare in such a relation between the subject and the\nartist, and Nick was disposed to go on till he should have to stop for\npity or for shame. He caught eventually a glimmer of the truth\nunderlying the strangeness, guessed that what upset his friend was\nsimply the reversal, in such a combination, of his usual terms of\nintercourse. He was so accustomed to living upon irony and the\ninterpretation of things that it was new to him to be himself\ninterpreted and--as a gentleman who sits for his portrait is always\nliable to be--interpreted all ironically. From being outside of the\nuniverse he was suddenly brought into it, and from the position of a\nfree commentator and critic, an easy amateurish editor of the whole\naffair, reduced to that of humble ingredient and contributor. It\noccurred afterwards to Nick that he had perhaps brought on a catastrophe\nby having happened to throw off as they gossiped or languished, and not\nalone without a cruel intention, but with an impulse of genuine\nsolicitude: \"But, my dear fellow, what will you do when you're old?\"\n\n\"Old? What do you call old?\" Nash had replied bravely enough, but with\nanother perceptible tinge of irritation. \"Must I really remind you at\nthis time of day that that term has no application to such a condition\nas mine? It only belongs to you wretched people who have the incurable\nsuperstition of 'doing'; it's the ignoble collapse you prepare for\nyourselves when you cease to be able to do. For me there'll be no\ncollapse, no transition, no clumsy readjustment of attitude; for I\nshall only _be_, more and more, with all the accumulations of\nexperience, the longer I live.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm not particular about the term,\" said Nick. \"If you don't call it\nold, the ultimate state, call it weary--call it final. The accumulations\nof experience are practically accumulations of fatigue.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about weariness. I live freshly--it doesn't\nfatigue me.\"\n\n\"Then you need never die,\" Nick declared.\n\n\"Certainly; I daresay I'm indestructible, immortal.\"\n\nNick laughed out at this--it would be such fine news to some people. But\nit was uttered with perfect gravity, and it might very well have been in\nthe spirit of that gravity that Nash failed to observe his agreement to\nsit again the next day. The next and the next and the next passed, but\nhe never came back.\n\nTrue enough, punctuality was not important for a man who felt that he\nhad the command of all time. Nevertheless his disappearance \"without a\ntrace,\" that of a personage in a fairy-tale or a melodrama, made a\nconsiderable impression on his friend as the months went on; so that,\nthough he had never before had the least difficulty about entering into\nthe play of Gabriel's humour, Nick now recalled with a certain fanciful\nawe the special accent with which he had ranked himself among\nimperishable things. He wondered a little if he hadn't at last,\nbalancing always on the stretched tight-rope of his wit, fallen over on\nthe wrong side. He had never before, of a truth, been so nearly witless,\nand would have to have gone mad in short to become so singularly simple.\nPerhaps indeed he was acting only more than usual in his customary\nspirit--thoughtfully contributing, for Nick's enlivenment, a purple rim\nof mystery to an horizon now so dreadfully let down. The mystery at any\nrate remained; another shade of purple in fact was virtually added to\nit. Nick had the prospect, for the future, of waiting to see, all\ncuriously, when Nash would turn up, if ever, and the further\ndiversion--it almost consoled him for the annoyance of being left with a\nsecond unfinished thing on his hands--of imagining in the portrait he\nhad begun an odd tendency to fade gradually from the canvas. He couldn't\ncatch it in the act, but he could have ever a suspicion on glancing at\nit that the hand of time was rubbing it away little by little--for all\nthe world as in some delicate Hawthorne tale--and making the surface\nindistinct and bare of all resemblance to the model. Of course the moral\nof the Hawthorne tale would be that his personage would come back in\nquaint confidence on the day his last projected shadow should have\nvanished.\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nOne day toward the end of March of the following year, in other words\nmore than six months after Mr. Nash's disappearance, Bridget Dormer came\ninto her brother's studio and greeted him with the effusion that\naccompanies a return from an absence. She had been staying at\nBroadwood--she had been staying at Harsh. She had various things to tell\nhim about these episodes, about his mother, about Grace, about her small\nsubterraneous self, and about Percy's having come, just before, over to\nBroadwood for two days; the longest visit with which, almost since they\ncould remember, the head of the family had honoured their common parent.\nNick noted indeed that this demonstration had apparently been taken as a\ngreat favour, and Biddy loyally testified to the fact that her elder\nbrother was awfully jolly and that his presence had been a pretext for\ntremendous fun. Nick accordingly asked her what had passed about his\nmarriage--what their mother had said to him.\n\n\"Oh nothing,\" she replied; and Percy had said nothing to Lady Agnes and\nnot a word to herself. This partly explained, for his junior, the\nconsequent beatitude--none but cheerful topics had been produced; but he\nquestioned the girl further--to a point which led her to say: \"Oh I\ndaresay that before long she'll write to her.\"\n\n\"Who'll write to whom?\"\n\n\"Mamma'll write to Percy's wife. I'm sure he'd like it. Of course we\nshall end by going to see her. He was awfully disappointed at what he\nfound in Spain--he didn't find anything.\"\n\nBiddy spoke of his disappointment almost with commiseration, for she was\nevidently inclined this morning to a fresh and kindly view of things.\nNick could share her feeling but so far as was permitted by a\nrecognition merely general of what his brother must have looked for. It\nmight have been snipe and it might have been bristling boars. Biddy was\nindeed brief at first about everything, in spite of all the weeks that\nhad gone since their last meeting; for he quickly enough saw she had\nsomething behind--something that made her gay and that she wanted to\ncome to quickly. He was vaguely vexed at her being, fresh from\nBroadwood, so gay as that; for--it was impossible to shut one's eyes to\nthe fact--what had practically come to pass in regard to that rural\nretreat was exactly what he had desired to avert. All winter, while it\nhad been taken for granted his mother and sisters were doing what he\nwished, they had been doing precisely what he hated. He held Biddy\nperhaps least responsible, and there was no one he could exclusively\nblame. He washed his hands of the matter and succeeded fairly well, for\nthe most part, in forgetting he was not pleased. Julia herself in truth\nappeared to have been the most active member of the little group united\nto make light of his decencies. There had been a formal restitution of\nBroadwood, but the three ladies were there more than ever, with the\nslight difference that they were mainly there with its mistress. Mahomet\nhad declined to go any more to the mountain, so the mountain had\nvirtually come to Mahomet.\n\nAfter their long visit in the autumn Lady Agnes and her girls had come\nback to town; but they had gone down again for Christmas and Julia had\ntaken this occasion to write to Nick that she hoped very much he\nwouldn't refuse them all his own company for just a little scrap of the\nsupremely sociable time. Nick, after reflexion, judged it best not to\nrefuse, so that he passed, in the event, four days under his cousin's\nroof. The \"all\" proved a great many people, for she had taken care to\nfill the house. She took the largest view of hospitality and Nick had\nnever seen her so splendid, so free-handed, so gracefully active. She\nwas a perfect mistress of the revels; she had arranged some ancient\nbravery for every day and for every night. The Dormers were so much in\nit, as the phrase was, that after all their discomfiture their fortune\nseemed in an hour to have come back. There had been a moment when, in\nextemporised charades, Lady Agnes, an elderly figure being required,\nappeared on the point of undertaking the part of the housekeeper at a\ncastle, who, dropping her _h_'s, showed sheeplike tourists about; but\nshe waived the opportunity in favour of her daughter Grace. Even Grace\nhad a great success; Grace dropped her _h_'s as with the crash of\nempires. Nick of course was in the charades and in everything, but Julia\nwas not; she only invented, directed, led the applause. When nothing\nelse was forward Nick \"sketched\" the whole company: they followed him\nabout, they waylaid him on staircases, clamouring to be allowed to sit.\nHe obliged them so far as he could, all save Julia, who didn't clamour;\nand, growing rather red, he thought of Gabriel Nash while he bent over\nthe paper. Early in the new year he went abroad for six weeks, but only\nas far as Paris. It was a new Paris for him then; a Paris of the Rue\nBonaparte and three or four professional friends--he had more of these\nthere than in London; a Paris of studios and studies and models, of\nresearches and revelations, comparisons and contrasts, of strong\nimpressions and long discussions and rather uncomfortable economies,\nsmall caf\u00c3\u00a9s, bad fires and the general sense of being twenty again.\n\nWhile he was away his mother and sisters--Lady Agnes now sometimes wrote\nto him--returned to London for a month, and before he was again\nestablished in Rosedale Road they went back for a third course of\nBroadwood. After they had been there five days--and this was the salt of\nthe whole feast--Julia took herself off to Harsh, leaving them in\nundisturbed possession. They had remained so--they wouldn't come up to\ntown till after Easter. The trick was played, and Biddy, as I have\nmentioned, was now very content. Her brother presently learned, however,\nthat the reason of this was not wholly the success of the trick; unless\nindeed her further ground were only a continuation of it. She was not in\nLondon as a forerunner of her mother; she was not even as yet in\nCalcutta Gardens. She had come to spend a week with Florry Tressilian,\nwho had lately taken the dearest little flat in a charming new place,\njust put up, on the other side of the Park, with all kinds of lifts and\ntubes and electricities. Florry had been awfully nice to her--had been\nwith them ever so long at Broadwood while the flat was being painted and\nprepared--and mamma had then let her, let Biddy, promise to come to her,\nwhen everything was ready, so that they might have a happy old maids'\n(for they _were_, old maids now!) house-warming together. If Florry\ncould by this time do without a chaperon--she had two latchkeys and went\nalone on the top of omnibuses, and her name was in the Red Book--she was\nenough of a duenna for another girl. Biddy referred with sweet cynical\neyes to the fine happy stride she had thus taken in the direction of\nenlightened spinsterhood; and Nick hung his head, immensely abashed and\nhumiliated, for, modern as he had fatuously supposed himself, there were\nevidently currents more modern yet.\n\nIt so happened that on this particular morning he had drawn out of a\ncorner his interrupted study of Gabriel Nash; on no further\ncuriosity--he had only been looking round the room in a rummaging\nspirit--than to see how much or how little of it remained. It had become\nto his view so dim an adumbration--he was sure of this, and it pressed\nsome spring of melancholy mirth--that it didn't seem worth putting away,\nand he left it leaning against a table as if it had been a blank canvas\nor a \"preparation\" to be painted over. In this posture it attracted\nBiddy's attention, for on a second glance it showed distinguishable\nfeatures. She had not seen it before and now asked whom it might\nrepresent, remarking also that she could almost guess, yet not quite:\nshe had known the original but couldn't name him.\n\n\"Six months ago, for a few days, it represented Gabriel Nash,\" Nick\nreplied. \"But it isn't anybody or anything now.\"\n\n\"Six months ago? What's the matter with it and why don't you go on?\"\n\n\"What's the matter with it is more than I can tell you. But I can't go\non because I've lost my model.\"\n\nShe had an almost hopeful stare. \"Is he beautifully dead?\"\n\nHer brother laughed out at the candid cheerfulness, hopefulness almost,\nwith which this inquiry broke from her. \"He's only dead to me. He has\ngone away.\"\n\n\"Where has he gone?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea.\"\n\n\"Why, have you quarrelled?\"--Biddy shone again.\n\n\"Quarrelled? For what do you take us? Docs the nightingale quarrel with\nthe moon?\"\n\n\"I needn't ask which of you is the moon,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course I'm the nightingale. But, more literally,\" Nick continued,\n\"Nash has melted back into the elements--he's part of the great air of\nthe world.\" And then as even with this lucidity he saw the girl still\nmystified: \"I've a notion he has gone to India and at the present moment\nis reclining on a bank of flowers in the vale of Cashmere.\"\n\nBiddy had a pause, after which she dropped: \"Julia will be glad--she\ndislikes him so.\"\n\n\"If she dislikes him why should she be glad he's so enviably placed?\"\n\n\"I mean about his going away. She'll be glad of that.\"\n\n\"My poor incorrigible child,\" Nick cried, \"what has Julia to do with\nit?\"\n\n\"She has more to do with things than you think,\" Biddy returned with all\nher bravery. Yet she had no sooner uttered the words than she\nperceptibly blushed. Hereupon, to attenuate the foolishness of her\nblush--only it had the opposite effect--she added: \"She thinks he has\nbeen a bad element in your life.\"\n\nNick emitted a long strange sound. \"She thinks perhaps, but she doesn't\nthink enough; otherwise she'd arrive at this better thought--that she\nknows nothing whatever about my life.\"\n\n\"Ah brother,\" the girl pleaded with solemn eyes, \"you don't imagine what\nan interest she takes in it. She has told me many times--she has talked\nlots to me about it.\" Biddy paused and then went on, an anxious little\nsmile shining through her gravity as if from a cautious wonder as to how\nmuch he would take: \"She has a conviction it was Mr. Nash who made\ntrouble between you.\"\n\n\"Best of little sisters,\" Nick pronounced, \"those are thoroughly\nsecond-rate ideas, the result of a perfectly superficial view. Excuse my\npossibly priggish tone, but they really attribute to my dear detached\nfriend a part he's quite incapable of playing. He can neither make\ntrouble nor take trouble; no trouble could ever either have come out of\nhim or have got into him. Moreover,\" our young man continued, \"if Julia\nhas talked to you so much about the matter there's no harm in my talking\nto you a little. When she threw me over in an hour it was on a perfectly\ndefinite occasion. That occasion was the presence in my studio of a\ndishevelled, an abandoned actress.\"\n\n\"Oh Nick, she has not thrown you over!\" Biddy protested. \"She has\nnot--I've proof.\"\n\nHe felt at this direct denial a certain stir of indignation and looked\nat the girl with momentary sternness. \"Has she sent you here to tell me\nthis? What do you mean by proof?\"\n\nBiddy's eyes, at these questions, met her brother's with a strange\nexpression, and for a few seconds, while she looked entreatingly into\nthem, she wavered there with parted lips and vaguely stretched out her\nhands. The next minute she had burst into tears--she was sobbing on his\nbreast. He said \"Hallo!\" and soothed her; but it was very quickly over.\nThen she told him what she meant by her proof and what she had had on\nher mind ever since her present arrival. It was a message from Julia,\nbut not to say--not to say what he had questioned her about just before;\nthough indeed, more familiar now that he had his arm round her, she\nboldly expressed the hope it might in the end come to the same thing.\nJulia simply wanted to know--- she had instructed her to sound him\ndiscreetly--if Nick would undertake her portrait; and she wound up this\nexperiment in \"sounding\" by the statement that their beautiful kinswoman\nwas dying to sit.\n\n\"Dying to sit?\" echoed Nick, whose turn it was this time to feel his\ncolour rise.\n\n\"At any moment you like after Easter, when she comes up. She wants a\nfull-length and your very best, your most splendid work.\"\n\nNick stared, not caring that he had blushed. \"Is she serious?\"\n\n\"Ah Nick--serious!\" Biddy reasoned tenderly. She came nearer again and\nhe thought her again about to weep. He took her by the shoulders,\nlooking into her eyes.\n\n\"It's all right if she knows _I_ am. But why doesn't she come like any\none else? I don't refuse people!\"\n\n\"Nick, dearest Nick!\" she went on, her eyes conscious and pleading. He\nlooked into them intently--as well as she could he play at sounding--and\nfor a moment, between these young persons, the air was lighted by the\nglimmer of mutual searchings and suppressed confessions. Nick read deep\nand then, suddenly releasing his sister, turned away. She didn't see his\nface in that movement, but an observer to whom it had been presented\nmight have fancied it denoted a foreboding that was not exactly a dread,\nyet was not exclusively a joy.\n\nThe first thing he made out in the room, when he could distinguish, was\nGabriel Nash's portrait, which suddenly filled him with an unreasoning\nrancour. He seized it and turned it about, jammed it back into its\ncorner with its face against the wall. This small diversion might have\nserved to carry off the embarrassment with which he had finally averted\nhimself from Biddy. The embarrassment, however, was all his own; none of\nit was reflected in the way she resumed, after a silence in which she\nhad followed his disposal of the picture:\n\n\"If she's so eager to come here--for it's here she wants to sit, not in\nGreat Stanhope Street, never!--how can she prove better that she doesn't\ncare a bit if she meets Miss Rooth?\"\n\n\"She won't meet Miss Rooth,\" Nick replied rather dryly.\n\n\"Oh I'm sorry!\" said Biddy. She was as frank as if she had achieved a\nvirtual victory, and seemed to regret the loss of a chance for Julia to\nshow an equal mildness. Her tone made her brother laugh, but she went on\nwith confidence: \"She thought it was Mr. Nash who made Miss Rooth come.\"\n\n\"So he did, by the way,\" said Nick.\n\n\"Well then, wasn't that making trouble?\"\n\n\"I thought you admitted there was no harm in her being here.\"\n\n\"Yes, but _he_ hoped there'd be.\"\n\n\"Poor Nash's hopes!\" Nick laughed. \"My dear child, it would take a\ncleverer head than you or me, or even Julia, who must have invented that\nwise theory, to say what they were. However, let us agree that even if\nthey were perfectly fiendish my good sense has been a match for them.\"\n\n\"Oh Nick, that's delightful!\" chanted Biddy. Then she added: \"Do you\nmean she doesn't come any more?\"\n\n\"The dishevelled actress? She hasn't been near me for months.\"\n\n\"But she's in London--she's always acting? I've been away so much I've\nscarcely observed,\" Biddy explained with a slight change of note.\n\n\"The same silly part, poor creature, for nearly a year. It appears that\nthat's 'success'--in her profession. I saw her in the character several\ntimes last summer, but haven't set foot in her theatre since.\"\n\nBiddy took this in; then she suggested; \"Peter wouldn't have liked\nthat.\"\n\n\"Oh Peter's likes--!\" Nick at his easel, beginning to work, conveniently\nsighed.\n\n\"I mean her acting the same part for a year.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know; he has never written me a word.\"\n\n\"Nor me either,\" Biddy returned.\n\nThere was another short silence, during which Nick brushed at a panel.\nIt ended in his presently saying: \"There's one thing certainly Peter\n_would_ like--that is simply to be here to-night. It's a great\nnight--another great night--for the abandoned one. She's to act Juliet\nfor the first time.\"\n\n\"Ah how I should like to see her!\" the girl cried.\n\nNick glanced at her; she sat watching him. \"She has sent me a stall; I\nwish she had sent me two. I should have been delighted to take you.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you could get another?\" Biddy quavered.\n\n\"They must be in tremendous demand. But who knows after all?\" Nick\nadded, at the same moment looking round. \"Here's a chance--here's quite\nan extraordinary chance!\"\n\nHis servant had opened the door and was ushering in a lady whose\nidentity was indeed justly reflected in those words. \"Miss Rooth!\" the\nman announced; but he was caught up by a gentleman who came next and who\nexclaimed, laughing and with a gesture gracefully corrective: \"No,\nno--no longer Miss Rooth!\"\n\nMiriam entered the place with her charming familiar grandeur--entered\nvery much as she might have appeared, as she appeared every night, early\nin her first act, at the back of the stage, by the immemorial middle\ndoor. She might exactly now have been presenting herself to the house,\ntaking easy possession, repeating old movements, looking from one to the\nother of the actors before the footlights. The rich \"Good-morning\" she\nthrew into the air, holding out her right hand to Biddy and then giving\nher left to Nick--as she might have given it to her own brother--had\nnothing to tell of intervals or alienations. She struck Biddy as still\nmore terrible in her splendid practice than when she had seen her\nbefore--the practice and the splendour had now something almost royal.\nThe girl had had occasion to make her curtsey to majesties and\nhighnesses, but the flutter those effigies produced was nothing to the\nway in which at the approach of this young lady the agitated air seemed\nto recognise something supreme. So the deep mild eyes she bent on Biddy\nwere not soothing, though for that matter evidently intended to soothe.\nBiddy wondered Nick could have got so used to her--he joked at her as\nshe loomed--and later in the day, still under the great impression of\nthis incident, she even wondered that Peter could have full an impunity.\nIt was true that Peter apparently didn't quite feel one.\n\n\"You never came--you never came,\" Miriam said to her kindly and sadly;\nand Biddy, recognising the allusion, the invitation to visit the actress\nat home, had to explain how much she had been absent from London and\nthen even that her brother hadn't proposed to take her.\n\n\"Very true--he hasn't come himself. What's he doing now?\" asked Miss\nRooth, standing near her young friend but looking at Nick, who had\nimmediately engaged in conversation with his other visitor, a gentleman\nwhose face came back to the girl. She had seen this gentleman on the\nstage with the great performer--that was it, the night Peter took her to\nthe theatre with Florry Tressilian. Oh that Nick would only do something\nof that sort now! This desire, quickened by the presence of the strange,\nexpressive woman, by the way she scattered sweet syllables as if she\nwere touching the piano-keys, combined with other things to make our\nyoung lady's head swim--other things too mingled to name, admiration and\nfear and dim divination and purposeless pride and curiosity and\nresistance, the impulse to go away and the determination to (as she\nwould have liked fondly to fancy it) \"hold her ground.\" The actress\ncourted her with a wondrous voice--what was the matter with the actress\nand what did she want?--and Biddy tried in return to give an idea of\nwhat Nick was doing. Not succeeding very well she was about to appeal to\nher brother, but Miriam stopped her with the remark that it didn't\nsignify; besides, Dashwood was telling Nick something--something they\nwanted him to know. \"We're in a great excitement--he has taken a\ntheatre,\" Miriam added.\n\n\"Taken a theatre?\" Biddy was vague.\n\n\"We're going to set up for ourselves. He's going to do for me\naltogether. It has all been arranged only within a day or two. It\nremains to be seen how it will answer,\" Miriam smiled. Biddy murmured\nsome friendly hope, and the shining presence went on: \"Do you know why\nI've broken in here to-day after a long absence--interrupting your poor\nbrother so basely, taking up his precious time? It's because I'm so\nnervous.\"\n\n\"About your first night?\" Biddy risked.\n\n\"Do you know about that--are you coming?\" Miriam had caught at it.\n\n\"No, I'm not coming--I haven't a place.\"\n\n\"Will you come if I send you one?\"\n\n\"Oh but really it's too beautiful of you!\" breathed the girl.\n\n\"You shall have a box; your brother shall bring you. They can't squeeze\nin a pin, I'm told; but I've kept a box, I'll manage it. Only if I do,\nyou know, mind you positively come!\" She sounded it as the highest of\nfavours, resting her hand on Biddy's.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. And may I bring a friend--the friend with whom I'm\nstaying?\"\n\nMiriam now just gloomed. \"Do you mean Mrs. Dallow?\"\n\n\"No, no--Miss Tressilian. She puts me up, she has got a flat. Did you\never see a flat?\" asked Biddy expansively. \"My cousin's not in London.\"\nMiriam replied that she might bring whom she liked and Biddy broke out\nto her brother: \"Fancy what kindness, Nick: we're to have a box to-night\nand you're to take me!\"\n\nNick turned to her a face of levity which struck her even at the time as\ntoo cynically free, but which she understood when the finer sense of it\nsubsequently recurred to her. Mr. Dashwood interposed with the remark\nthat it was all very well to talk about boxes, but that he didn't see\nhow at that time of day the miracle was to be worked.\n\n\"You haven't kept one as I told you?\" Miriam demanded.\n\n\"As you told me, my dear? Tell the lamb to keep its tenderest mutton\nfrom the wolves!\"\n\n\"You shall have one: we'll arrange it,\" Miriam went on to Biddy.\n\n\"Let me qualify that statement a little, Miss Dormer,\" said Basil\nDashwood. \"We'll arrange it if it's humanly possible.\"\n\n\"We'll arrange it even if it's inhumanly _im_possible--that's just the\npoint,\" Miriam declared to the girl. \"Don't talk about trouble--what's\nhe meant for but to take it? _Cela s'annonce bien_, you see,\" she\ncontinued to Nick: \"doesn't it look as if we should pull beautifully\ntogether?\" And as he answered that he heartily congratulated her--he was\nimmensely interested in what he had been told--she exclaimed after\nresting her eyes on him a moment: \"What will you have? It seemed\nsimpler! It was clear there had to be some one.\" She explained further\nto Nick what had led her to come in at that moment, while Dashwood\napproached Biddy with a civil assurance that they would see, they would\nleave no stone unturned, though he would not have taken upon himself to\npromise.\n\nMiriam reminded Nick of the blessing he had been to her nearly a year\nbefore, on her other first night, when she was all impatient and on\nedge; how he had let her come and sit there for hours--helped her to\npossess her soul till the evening and to keep out of harm's way. The\ncase was the same at present, with the aggravation indeed that he would\nunderstand--Dashwood's nerves as well as her own: Dashwood's were a\ngreat deal worse than hers. Everything was ready for Juliet; they had\nbeen rehearsing for five months--it had kept her from going mad from the\ntreadmill of the other piece--and he, Nick, had occurred to her again,\nin the last intolerable hours, as the friend in need, the salutary\nstop-gap, no matter how much she worried him. She shouldn't be turned\nout? Biddy broke away from Basil Dashwood: she must go, she must hurry\noff to Miss Tressilian with her news. Florry might make some other\nstupid engagement for the evening: she must be warned in time. The girl\ntook a flushed, excited leave after having received a renewal of\nMiriam's pledge and even heard her say to Nick that he must now give\nback the seat already sent him--they should be sure to have another use\nfor it.\n\n\n\n\nLI\n\n\nThat night at the theatre and in the box--the miracle had been wrought,\nthe treasure found--Nick Dormer pointed out to his two companions the\nstall he had relinquished, which was close in front; noting how oddly it\nremained during the whole of the first act vacant. The house was beyond\neverything, the actress beyond any one; though to describe again so\nfamous an occasion--it has been described repeatedly by other\nreporters--is not in the compass of the closing words of a history\nalready too sustained. It is enough to say that these great hours marked\nan era in contemporary art and that for those who had a spectator's\nshare in them the words \"revelation,\" \"incarnation,\" \"acclamation,\"\n\"demonstration,\" \"ovation\"--to name only a few, and all accompanied by\nthe word \"extraordinary\"--acquired a new force. Miriam's Juliet was an\nexquisite image of young passion and young despair, expressed in the\ntruest, divinest music that had ever poured from tragic lips. The great\nchildish audience, gaping at her points, expanded there before her like\na lap to catch flowers.\n\nDuring the first interval our three friends in the box had plenty to\ntalk about, and they were so occupied with it that for some time they\nfailed to observe a gentleman who had at last come into the empty stall\nnear the front. This discovery was presently formulated by Miss\nTressilian in the cheerful exclamation: \"Only fancy--there's Mr.\nSherringham!\" This of course immediately became a high wonder--a wonder\nfor Nick and Biddy, who had not heard of his return; and the prodigy was\nquickened by the fact that he gave no sign of looking for them or even\nat them. Having taken possession of his place he sat very still in it,\nstaring straight before him at the curtain. His abrupt reappearance held\nthe seeds of anxiety both for Biddy and for Nick, so that it was mainly\nMiss Tressilian who had freedom of mind to throw off the theory that he\nhad come back that very hour--had arrived from a long journey. Couldn't\nthey see how strange he was and how brown, how burnt and how red, how\ntired and how worn? They all inspected him, though Biddy declined Miss\nTressilian's glass; but he was evidently indifferent to notice and\nfinally Biddy, leaning back in her chair, dropped the fantastic words:\n\n\"He has come home to marry Juliet!\"\n\nNick glanced at her and then replied: \"What a disaster--to make such a\njourney as that and to be late for the fair!\"\n\n\"Late for the fair?\"\n\n\"Why she's married--these three days. They did it very quietly; Miriam\nsays because her mother hated it and hopes it won't be much known! All\nthe same she's Basil Dashwood's wedded wife--he has come in just in time\nto take the receipts for Juliet. It's a good thing, no doubt, for there\nare at least two fortunes to be made out of her, and he'll give up the\nstage.\" Nick explained to Miss Tressilian, who had inquired, that the\ngentleman in question was the actor who was playing Mercutio, and he\nasked Biddy if she hadn't known that this was what they were telling him\nin Rosedale Road that morning. She replied that she had understood\nnothing but that she was to be where she was, and she sank considerably\nbehind the drapery of the box. From this cover she was able to launch,\ncreditably enough, the exclamation:\n\n\"Poor, poor Peter!\"\n\nNick got up and stood looking at poor, poor Peter. \"He ought to come\nround and speak to us, but if he doesn't see us I suppose he doesn't.\"\nHe quitted the box as to go to the restored exile, and I may add that as\nsoon as he had done so Florence Tressilian bounded over to the dusk in\nwhich Biddy had nestled. What passed immediately between these young\nladies needn't concern us: it is sufficient to mention that two minutes\nlater Miss Tressilian broke out:\n\n\"Look at him, dearest; he's turning his head this way!\"\n\n\"Thank you, I don't care to watch his turns,\" said Biddy; and she\ndoubtless demeaned herself in the high spirit of these words. It\nnevertheless happened that directly afterwards she had certain knowledge\nof his having glanced at his watch as if to judge how soon the curtain\nwould rise again, as well as of his having then jumped up and passed\nquickly out of his place. The curtain had risen again without his\nreappearing and without Nick's returning. Indeed by the time Nick\nslipped in a good deal of the third act was over; and even then, even\nwhen the curtain descended, Peter had not come back. Nick sat down in\nsilence to watch the stage, to which the breathless attention of his\ncompanions seemed attached, though Biddy after a moment threw round at\nhim a single quick look. At the end of the act they were all occupied\nwith the recalls, the applause and the responsive loveliness of Juliet\nas she was led out--Mercutio had to give her up to Romeo--and even for a\nfew minutes after the deafening roar had subsided nothing was said among\nthe three. At last Nick began:\n\n\"It's quite true he has just arrived; he's in Great Stanhope Street.\nThey've given him several weeks, to make up for the uncomfortable way\nthey bundled him off--to get there in time for some special business\nthat had suddenly to be gone into--when he first went out: he tells me\nthey even then promised that. He got into Southampton only a few hours\nago, rushed up by the first train he could catch and came off here\nwithout any dinner.\"\n\n\"Fancy!\" said Miss Tressilian; while Biddy more generally asked if Peter\nmight be in good health and appeared to have been happy. Nick replied\nthat he described his post as beastly but didn't seem to have suffered\nfrom it. He was to be in England probably a month, he was awfully brown,\nhe sent his love to Biddy. Miss Tressilian looked at his empty stall and\nwas of the opinion that it would be more to the point if he were to come\nin to see her.\n\n\"Oh he'll turn up; we had a goodish talk in the lobby where he met me. I\nthink he went out somewhere.\"\n\n\"How odd to come so many thousand miles for this and then not to stay!\"\nBiddy fluted.\n\n\"Did he come on purpose for this?\" Miss Tressilian asked.\n\n\"Perhaps he's gone out to get his dinner!\" joked Biddy.\n\nHer friend suggested that he might be behind the scenes, but Nick cast\ndoubts; whereupon Biddy asked if he himself were not going round. At\nthis moment the curtain rose; Nick said he would go in the next\ninterval. As soon as it came he quitted the box, remaining absent while\nit lasted.\n\nAll this time, in the house, there was no sign of Peter. Nick reappeared\nonly as the fourth act was beginning and uttered no word to his\ncompanions till it was over. Then, after a further delay produced by\nrenewed vociferous proofs of the personal victory won, he depicted his\nvisit to the stage and the wonderful sight of Miriam on the field of\nbattle. Miss Tressilian inquired if he had found Mr. Sherringham with\nher; to which he replied that, save across the footlights, she had not\nbeen in touch with him. At this a soft exclamation broke from Biddy.\n\"Poor Peter! Where is he, then?\"\n\nNick seemed to falter. \"He's walking the streets.\"\n\n\"Walking the streets?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I give it up!\" our young man replied; and his tone, for\nsome minutes, reduced his companions to silence. But a little later\nBiddy said:\n\n\"Was it for him this morning she wanted that place--when she asked you\nto give yours back?\"\n\n\"For him exactly. It's very odd she had just managed to keep it--for all\nthe good use he makes of it! She told me just now that she heard from\nhim, at his post, a short time ago, to the effect that he had seen in a\nnewspaper a statement she was going to do Juliet and that he firmly\nintended, though the ways and means were not clear to him--his leave of\nabsence hadn't yet come out and he couldn't be sure when it would\ncome--to be present on her first night; whereby she must do him the\nservice to provide him a place. She thought this a speech rather in the\nair, so that in the midst of all her cares she took no particular pains\nabout the matter. She had an idea she had really done with him for a\nlong time. But this afternoon what does he do but telegraph to her from\nSouthampton that he keeps his appointment and counts on her for a stall?\nUnless she had got back mine she wouldn't have been able to help him.\nWhen she was in Rosedale Road this morning she hadn't received his\ntelegram; but his promise, his threat, whatever it was, came back to\nher: she had a vague foreboding and thought that on the chance she had\nbetter hold something ready. When she got home she found his telegram,\nand she told me he was the first person she saw in the house, through\nher fright when she came on in the second act. It appears she was\nterrified this time, and it lasted half through the play.\"\n\n\"She must be rather annoyed at his having gone away,\" Miss Tressilian\nobserved.\n\n\"Annoyed? I'm not so sure!\" laughed Nick.\n\n\"Ah here he comes back!\" cried Biddy, behind her fan, while the absentee\nedged into his seat in time for the fifth act. He stood there a moment,\nfirst looking round the theatre; then he turned his eyes to the box\noccupied by his relatives, smiling and waving his hand.\n\n\"After that he'll surely come and see you,\" said Miss Tressilian.\n\n\"We shall see him as we go out,\" Biddy returned: \"he must lose no more\ntime.\"\n\nNick looked at him with a glass, then exclaiming: \"Well, I'm glad he has\npulled himself together!\"\n\n\"Why what's the matter with him--if he wasn't disappointed of his seat?\"\nMiss Tressilian demanded.\n\n\"The matter with him is that a couple of hours ago he had a great\nshock.\"\n\n\"A great shock?\"\n\n\"I may as well mention it at last,\" Nick went on. \"I had to say\nsomething to him in the lobby there when we met--something I was pretty\nsure he couldn't like. I let him have it full in the face--it seemed to\nme better and wiser. I let him know that Juliet's married.\"\n\n\"Didn't he know it?\" asked Biddy, who, with her face raised, had\nlistened in deep stillness to every word that fell from her brother.\n\n\"How should he have known it? It has only just taken place, and they've\nbeen so clever, for reasons of their own--those people move among a lot\nof considerations that are absolutely foreign to us--about keeping it\nout of the papers. They put in a lot of lies and they leave out the real\nthings.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say Mr. Sherringham wanted to _marry_ her!\" Miss\nTressilian gasped.\n\n\"Don't ask me what he wanted--I daresay we shall never know. One thing's\nvery certain--that he didn't like my news, dear old Peter, and that I\nshan't soon forget the look in his face as he turned away from me and\nslipped out into the street. He was too much upset--he couldn't trust\nhimself to come back; he had to walk about--he tried to walk it off.\"\n\n\"Let us hope, then, he _has_ walked it off!\"\n\n\"Ah poor fellow--he couldn't hold out to the end; he has had to come\nback and look at her once more. He knows she'll be sublime in these last\nscenes.\"\n\n\"Is he so much in love with her as that? What difference does it make\nfor an actress if she _is_ mar--?\" But in this rash inquiry Miss\nTressilian suddenly checked herself.\n\n\"We shall probably never know how much he has been in love with her, nor\nwhat difference it makes. We shall never know exactly what he came back\nfor, nor why he couldn't stand it out there any longer without relief,\nnor why he scrambled down here all but straight from the station, nor\nwhy after all, for the last two hours, he has been roaming the streets.\nAnd it doesn't matter, for it's none of our business. But I'm sorry for\nhim--she is going to be sublime,\" Nick added. The curtain was rising on\nthe tragic climax of the play.\n\nMiriam Rooth was sublime; yet it may be confided to the reader that\nduring these supreme scenes Bridget Dormer directed her eyes less to the\ninspired actress than to a figure in the stalls who sat with his own\ngaze fastened to the stage. It may further be intimated that Peter\nSherringham, though he saw but a fragment of the performance, read\nclear, at the last, in the intense light of genius with which this\nfragment was charged, that even so after all he had been rewarded for\nhis formidable journey. The great trouble of his infatuation subsided,\nleaving behind it something appreciably deep and pure. This pacification\nwas far from taking place at once, but it was helped on, unexpectedly to\nhim--it began to work at least--the very next night he saw the play,\nthrough the whole of which he then sat. He felt somehow recalled to the\nreal by the very felicity of this experience, the supreme exhibition\nitself. He began to come back as from a far-off province of his history\nwhere miserable madness had reigned. He had been baffled, he had got his\nanswer; it must last him--that was plain. He didn't fully accept it the\nfirst week or the second; but he accepted it sooner than he could have\nsupposed had he known what it was to be when he paced at night, under\nthe southern stars, the deck of the ship bearing him to England.\n\nIt had been, as we know, Miss Tressilian's view, and even Biddy's, that\nevening, that Peter Sherringham would join them as they left the\ntheatre. This view, however, was not confirmed by the event, for our\ntroubled gentleman vanished utterly--disappointingly crude behaviour on\nthe part of a young diplomatist who had distinguished himself--before\nany one could put a hand on him. And he failed to make up for his\ncrudity by coming to see any one the next day, or even the next. Indeed\nmany days elapsed and very little would have been known about him had it\nnot been that, in the country, Mrs. Dallow knew. What Mrs. Dallow knew\nwas eventually known to Biddy Dormer; and in this way it could be\nestablished in his favour that he had remained some extraordinarily\nsmall number of days in London, had almost directly gone over to Paris\nto see his old chief. He came back from Paris--Biddy learnt this not\nfrom Julia, but in a much more immediate way: she knew it by his\npressing the little electric button at the door of Florence Tressilian's\nflat one day when the good Florence was out and she herself was at home.\nHe made on this occasion a very long visit. The good Florence knew it\nnot much later, you may be sure--and how he had got their address from\nNick--and she took an extravagant pleasure in it. Mr. Sherringham had\nnever been to see _her_--the like of her--in his life: therefore it was\nclear what had made him begin. When he had once begun he kept it up, and\nMiss Tressilian's pleasure grew.\n\nGood as she was, she could remember without the slightest relenting what\nNick Dormer had repeated to them at the theatre about the dreary side of\nPeter's present post. However, she was not bound to make a stand at this\nif persons more nearly concerned, Lady Agnes and the girl herself,\ndidn't mind it. How little _they_ minded it, and Grace and Julia Dallow\nand even Nick, was proved in the course of a meeting that took place at\nHarsh during the Easter holidays. The mistress of that seat had a small\nand intimate party to celebrate her brother's betrothal. The two ladies\ncame over from Broadwood; even Nick, for two days, went back to his old\nhunting-ground, and Miss Tressilian relinquished for as long a time the\ndelights of her newly arranged flat. Peter Sherringham obtained an\nextension of leave, so that he might go back to his legation with a\nwife. Fortunately, as it turned out, Biddy's ordeal, in the more or less\ntorrid zone, was not cruelly prolonged, for the pair have already\nreceived a superior appointment. It is Lady Agnes's proud opinion that\nher daughter is even now shaping their destiny. I say \"even now,\" for\nthese facts bring me very close to contemporary history. During those\ntwo days at Harsh Nick arranged with the former mistress of his fate the\nconditions, as they might be called, under which she should sit to him;\nand every one will remember in how recent an exhibition general\nattention was attracted, as the newspapers said in describing the\nprivate view, to the noble portrait of a lady which was the final\noutcome of that arrangement. Gabriel Nash had been at many a private\nview, but he was not at that one.\n\nThese matters are highly recent, however, as I say; so that in glancing\nabout the little circle of the interests I have tried to evoke I am\nsuddenly warned by a sharp sense of modernness. This renders it\ndifficult to me, for instance, in taking leave of our wonderful Miriam,\nto do much more than allude to the general impression that her\nremarkable career is even yet only in its early prime. Basil Dashwood\nhas got his theatre, and his wife--people know now she _is_ his\nwife--has added three or four new parts to her repertory; but every one\nis agreed that both in public and in private she has a great deal more\nto show. This is equally true of Nick Dormer, in regard to whom I may\nfinally say that his friend Nash's predictions about his reunion with\nMrs. Dallow have not up to this time been justified. On the other hand,\nI must not omit to add, this lady has not, at the latest accounts,\nmarried Mr. Macgeorge. It is very true there has been a rumour that Mr.\nMacgeorge is worried about her--has even ceased at all fondly to believe\nin her.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRAGIC MUSE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 20085-8.txt or 20085-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/0\/0\/8\/20085\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":937,"split":"train"}
