{"ori_id":"c002791c4ff779710ca7ba8d8cde2ac4b27d28b3","title":"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)","context":"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)\n In October 1973, \"Control\", head of British intelligence (\"the Circus\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a Hungarian general wishing to defect. Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness.\nPercy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operation\u2014\"Witchcraft\"\u2014to obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence.\nSmiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attach\u00e9 in London, was a spy.\nTarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true.\nSmiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \"Tinker\" (Alleline), \"Tailor\" (Haydon), \"Soldier\" (Bland), \"Poorman\" (Esterhase), and \"Beggarman\" (Smiley himself).\nSmiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov\u2014the \"Witchcraft\" source\u2014at a safe house, where Polyakov gives them supposedly high-grade Soviet intelligence in exchange for low-grade British material, to help him maintain his cover with the Soviets. However, the mole is passing substantive material, including US intelligence, to Polyakov, his handler, whilst Polyakov's material has just enough substance to persuade the CIA to share information with the British.\nSmiley blackmails the location of the safe house out of Esterhase, whose exile status makes him vulnerable to deportation. Smiley then has Tarr appear at the Paris office, implying he knows who the mole is. The mole meets Polyakov at the safe house, where Smiley arrests him: he is Bill Haydon.\nThe Circus plans to exchange Haydon with the Soviets, but he is killed by Prideaux, who was implied to have been Haydon's lover and betrayed by him in the Budapest incident. Smiley returns to the Circus as its new chief.\n<html>\n<head><title>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy script, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy movie script, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Written by\n\n                Bridget O'Connor & Peter Straughan\n\n\n\n\n<b>1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1\n<\/b>\n    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.\n    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we\n    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in\n    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,\n    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG\n    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.\n\n\n<b>2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2\n<\/b>\n    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets\n    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man\n    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.\n\n    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who\n    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The\n    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?\n\n    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.\n    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into\n    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't\n    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks\n    over, shakes hands.\n\n    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked\n    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.\n\n    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the\n    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the\n    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and\n    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness\n    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of\n    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the\n    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...\n\n\n<b>3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3\n<\/b>\n    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA\n    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk\n    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and\n    head towards...\n\n\n<b>4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4\n<\/b>\n    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,\n    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE\n    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A\n    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused\n    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the\n    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking\n    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The\n    ordinary world.\n<b>                                                               2.\n<\/b>\n\n\nWe find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the\ntables.\n\n<b>                    MAGYAR\n<\/b>              (Hungarian, subtitled)\n          And porkolts.

Better than\n          goulash. But you won't get it in\n          Budapest now.\n\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\n<\/b>          Why's that?\n\n<b>                    MAGYAR\n<\/b>          All the pigs have gone to Moscow.\n\nHe gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his\ncigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables\naround them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his\ngrubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two\nwizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.\n\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the\nWaiter's face, drips onto the table top.\n\nThe Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a\nwry smile - \"nice service.\" Jim smiles back but a bell has\nbegun to ring inside him.\n\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\n<\/b>          When do I get to meet your\n          friend?\n\nThe Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is\nignoring his.\n\n<b>                    MAGYAR\n<\/b>          I'll take you to him. Not eating?\n\nPrideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner\nstill easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands\nat the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another\nman. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -\nchecking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his\ngaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which\nlook down into the arcade.\n\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a\nwindow above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she\nshrinks back into the darkness and disappears.\n<b>                                                                3.\n<\/b>\n\n\nPrideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee\ncup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in\nsurprise.\n\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\n<\/b>          Would you excuse me a moment?\n\nHe starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind\nhim his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back\nand lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to\nthe domed ceiling.\n\nThe WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic\nflashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of\nhis belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing\nin the cavernous space.\n\nThe shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and\nPrideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,\nas behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal\nNIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,\nlike actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some\ndrawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in\nRussian.\n\n<b>                       KGB MAN\n<\/b>          No firing!\n\nAhead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.\nHe looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -\nthis one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending\nhim flying out of   frame.\n\nFrom around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -\nstrides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.\n\n<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Who told you to fire? Who told\n          you to fucking fire?\n\nTHE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the\nground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.\n\nIn the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.\n\nHER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.\nAs we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of\nblood. Then he's still.\n\nBELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to\nbeat him.\n\n<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We\n          wanted him alive!\n<b>                                                                       4.\n<\/b>\n\n\n     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's\n     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the\n     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.\n\n     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured\n     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He\n     lights a cigarette.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an\n     inscription: \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\"\n\n     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the\n     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.\n\n<b>                                               FADE TO BLACK.\n<\/b>\n<b>                                                       FADE IN:\n<\/b>\n\n<b>4A   EXT.

CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - \"MOTHERS\" OFFICE - DAY       4B\n<\/b>\n     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans\n     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the\n     secretaries or \"MOTHERS\" walks past, pushing a trolley of\n     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks\n     stricken. The Mother walks on into...\n\n\n<b>5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5\n<\/b>\n     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN\n     at the head of the table.
