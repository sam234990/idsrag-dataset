They have been there for seven years, and the last city standing is Saragossa, held by the Muslim King Marsile. Threatened by the might of Charlemagne's army of Franks, Marsile seeks advice and his wise man, Blancandrin, councils him to conciliate the Emperor, offering to surrender and giving hostages. Accordingly, Marsile sends out messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsile's conversion to Christianity if the Franks will go back to France.\nCharlemagne and his men, tired of fighting, accept his peace offer and select a messenger to Marsile's court. Protagonist Roland, Charlemagne's nephew, nominates his stepfather Ganelon as messenger. Ganelon, who fears to be murdered by the enemy and accuses Roland of intending this, takes revenge by informing the Saracens of a way to ambush the rear guard of Charlemagne's army, led by Roland, as the Franks re-enter Spain through the mountain passes.\nAs Ganelon predicted, Roland leads the rear guard, with the wise and moderate Oliver and the fierce Archbishop Turpin. The Muslims ambush them at Roncesvalles, and the Christians are overwhelmed. Oliver asks Roland to blow his olifant (the word is an old alternative to \"elephant\", and was used to refer to a hunting horn made from an elephant tusk) to call for help from the Frankish army; but Roland proudly refuses to do so. It is for this reason that Roland is often accused of pride by critics of the 'Song of Roland'.\nThe Franks fight well, but are outnumbered, until almost all Roland's men are dead and he knows that Charlemagne's army can no longer save them. Despite this, he blows his olifant to summon revenge, until his temples burst and he dies a martyr's death. Angels take his soul to Paradise.\nWhen Charlemagne and his men reach the battlefield, they find the dead bodies of Roland's men, who have been utterly annihilated, and pursue the Muslims into the river Ebro, where they drown. Meanwhile, Baligant, the powerful emir of Babylon, has arrived in Spain to help Marsile, and his army encounters that of Charlemagne at Roncesvalles, where the Christians are burying and mourning their dead. Both sides fight valiantly - when Charlemagne kills Baligant, the Muslim army scatters and flees, and the Franks conquer Saragossa. With Marsile's wife Bramimonde, Queen of Saragossa, Charlemagne and his men ride back to Aix, their capital in France.\nThe Franks discover Ganelon's betrayal and keep him in chains until his trial, where Ganelon argues that his action was legitimate revenge, not treason. While the council of barons assembled to decide the traitor's fate is initially swayed by this claim, one man, Thierry, argues that, because Roland was serving Charlemagne when Ganelon delivered his revenge on him, Ganelon's action constitutes a betrayal.\nGanelon's friend Pinabel challenges Thierry to trial by combat, in which, by divine intervention, Thierry kills Pinabel. The Franks are convinced by this of Ganelon's treason, thus, he is torn apart by having four galloping horses tied one to each arm and leg and thirty of his relatives are hanged.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Song of Roland, by Anonymous\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

[Charles Kenneth] Moncreiff\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous Old French epic, dating perhaps as early as the middle\n11th century.\n\n\n\n  I\n\n  Charles the King, our Lord and Sovereign,\n  Full seven years hath sojourned in Spain,\n  Conquered the land, and won the western main,\n  Now no fortress against him doth remain,\n  No city walls are left for him to gain,\n  Save Sarraguce, that sits on high mountain.\n  Marsile its King, who feareth not God's name,\n  Mahumet's man, he invokes Apollin's aid,\n  Nor wards off ills that shall to him attain.\n                      AOI.\n\n\n  II\n\n  King Marsilies he lay at Sarraguce,\n  Went he his way into an orchard cool;\n  There on a throne he sate, of marble blue,\n  Round him his men, full twenty thousand, stood.\n  Called he forth then his counts, also his dukes:\n  \"My Lords, give ear to our impending doom:\n  That Emperour, Charles of France the Douce,\n  Into this land is come, us to confuse.\n  I have no host in battle him to prove,\n  Nor have I strength his forces to undo.\n  Counsel me then, ye that are wise and true;\n  Can ye ward off this present death and dule?\"\n  What word to say no pagan of them knew,\n  Save Blancandrin, of th' Castle of Val Funde.\n\n  III\n\n  Blancandrins was a pagan very wise,\n  In vassalage he was a gallant knight,\n  First in prowess, he stood his lord beside.\n  And thus he spoke: \"Do not yourself affright!\n  Yield to Carlun, that is so big with pride,\n  Faithful service, his friend and his ally;\n  Lions and bears and hounds for him provide,\n  Thousand mewed hawks, sev'n hundred camelry;\n  Silver and gold, four hundred mules load high;\n  Fifty wagons his wrights will need supply,\n  Till with that wealth he pays his soldiery.\n  War hath he waged in Spain too long a time,\n  To Aix, in France, homeward he will him hie.\n  Follow him there before Saint Michael's tide,\n  You shall receive and hold the Christian rite;\n  Stand honour bound, and do him fealty.\n  Send hostages, should he demand surety,\n  Ten or a score, our loyal oath to bind;\n  Send him our sons, the first-born of our wives;--\n  An he be slain, I'll surely furnish mine.\n  Better by far they go, though doomed to die,\n  Than that we lose honour and dignity,\n  And be ourselves brought down to beggary.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  IV\n\n  Says Blancandrins: \"By my right hand, I say,\n  And by this beard, that in the wind doth sway,\n  The Frankish host you'll see them all away;\n  Franks will retire to France their own terrain.\n  When they are gone, to each his fair domain,\n  In his Chapelle at Aix will Charles stay,\n  High festival will hold for Saint Michael.\n  Time will go by, and pass the appointed day;\n  Tidings of us no Frank will hear or say.\n  Proud is that King, and cruel his courage;\n  From th' hostage he'll slice their heads away.\n  Better by far their heads be shorn away,\n  Than that ourselves lose this clear land of Spain,\n  Than that ourselves do suffer grief and pain.\"\n  \"That is well said.  So be it.\" the pagans say.\n\n  V\n\n  The council ends, and that King Marsilie\n  Calleth aside Clarun of Balaguee,\n  Estramarin and Eudropin his peer,\n  And Priamun and Guarlan of the beard,\n  And Machiner and his uncle Mahee,\n  With Jouner, Malbien from over sea,\n  And Blancandrin, good reason to decree:\n  Ten hath he called, were first in felony.\n  \"Gentle Barons, to Charlemagne go ye;\n  He is in siege of Cordres the city.\n  In your right hands bear olive-branches green\n  Which signify Peace and Humility.\n  If you by craft contrive to set me free,\n  Silver and gold, you'll have your fill of me,\n  Manors and fiefs, I'll give you all your need.\"\n  \"We have enough,\" the pagans straight agree.\n                      AOI.\n\n  VI\n\n  King Marsilies, his council finishing,\n  Says to his men: \"Go now, my lords, to him,\n  Olive-branches in your right hands bearing;\n  Bid ye for me that Charlemagne, the King,\n  In his God's name to shew me his mercy;\n  Ere this new moon wanes, I shall be with him;\n  One thousand men shall be my following;\n  I will receive the rite of christening,\n  Will be his man, my love and faith swearing;\n  Hostages too, he'll have, if so he will.\"\n  Says Blancandrins: \"Much good will come of this.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  VII\n\n  Ten snow-white mules then ordered Marsilie,\n  Gifts of a King, the King of Suatilie.\n  Bridled with gold, saddled in silver clear;\n  Mounted them those that should the message speak,\n  In their right hands were olive-branches green.\n  Came they to Charle, that holds all France in fee,\n  Yet cannot guard himself from treachery.\n                      AOI.\n\n  VIII\n\n  Merry and bold is now that Emperour,\n  Cordres he holds, the walls are tumbled down,\n  His catapults have battered town and tow'r.\n  Great good treasure his knights have placed in pound,\n  Silver and gold and many a jewelled gown.\n  In that city there is no pagan now\n  But he been slain, or takes the Christian vow.\n  The Emperour is in a great orchard ground\n  Where Oliver and Rollant stand around,\n  Sansun the Duke and Anseis the proud,\n  Gefreid d'Anjou, that bears his gonfaloun;\n  There too Gerin and Geriers are found.\n  Where they are found, is seen a mighty crowd,\n  Fifteen thousand, come out of France the Douce.\n  On white carpets those knights have sate them down,\n  At the game-boards to pass an idle hour;--\n  Chequers the old, for wisdom most renowned,\n  While fence the young and lusty bachelours.\n  Beneath a pine, in eglantine embow'red,\n  l    Stands a fald-stool, fashioned of gold throughout;\n  There sits the King, that holds Douce France in pow'r;\n  White is his beard, and blossoming-white his crown,\n  Shapely his limbs, his countenance is proud.\n  Should any seek, no need to point him out.\n  The messengers, on foot they get them down,\n  And in salute full courteously they lout.\n\n  IX\n\n  The foremost word of all Blancandrin spake,\n  And to the King: \"May God preserve you safe,\n  The All Glorious, to Whom ye're bound to pray!\n  Proud Marsilies this message bids me say:\n  Much hath he sought to find salvation's way;\n  Out of his wealth meet presents would he make,\n  Lions and bears, and greyhounds leashed on chain,\n  Thousand mewed hawks, sev'n hundred dromedrays,\n  Four hundred mules his silver shall convey,\n  Fifty wagons you'll need to bear away\n  Golden besants, such store of proved assay,\n  Wherewith full tale your soldiers you can pay.\n  Now in this land you've been too long a day\n  Hie you to France, return again to Aix;\n  Thus saith my Lord, he'll follow too that way.\"\n  That Emperour t'wards God his arms he raised\n  Lowered his head, began to meditate.\n                      AOI.\n\n  X\n\n  That Emperour inclined his head full low;\n  Hasty in speech he never was, but slow:\n  His custom was, at his leisure he spoke.\n  When he looks up, his face is very bold,\n  He says to them: \"Good tidings have you told.\n  King Marsilies hath ever been my foe.\n  These very words you have before me told,\n  In what measure of faith am I to hold?\"\n  That Sarrazin says, \"Hostages he'll show;\n  Ten shall you take, or fifteen or a score.\n  Though he be slain, a son of mine shall go,\n  Any there be you'll have more nobly born.\n  To your palace seigneurial when you go,\n  At Michael's Feast, called in periculo;\n  My Lord hath said, thither will he follow\n  Ev'n to your baths, that God for you hath wrought;\n  There is he fain the Christian faith to know.\"\n  Answers him Charles: \"Still may he heal his soul.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XI\n\n  Clear shone the sun in a fair even-tide;\n  Those ten men's mules in stall he bade them tie.\n  Also a tent in the orchard raise on high,\n  Those messengers had lodging for the night;\n  Dozen serjeants served after them aright.\n  Darkling they lie till comes the clear daylight.\n  That Emperour does with the morning rise;\n  Matins and Mass are said then in his sight.\n  Forth goes that King, and stays beneath a pine;\n  Barons he calls, good counsel to define,\n  For with his Franks he's ever of a mind.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XII\n\n  That Emperour, beneath a pine he sits,\n  Calls his barons, his council to begin:\n  Oger the Duke, that Archbishop Turpin,\n  Richard the old, and his nephew Henry,\n  From Gascony the proof Count Acolin,\n  Tedbald of Reims and Milun his cousin:\n  With him there were Gerers, also Gerin,\n  And among them the Count Rollant came in,\n  And Oliver, so proof and so gentil.\n  Franks out of France, a thousand chivalry;\n  Guenes came there, that wrought the treachery.\n  The Council then began, which ended ill.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XIII\n\n  \"My Lords Barons,\" says the Emperour then, Charles,\n  \"King Marsilies hath sent me his messages;\n  Out of his wealth he'll give me weighty masses.\n  Greyhounds on leash and bears and lions also,\n  Thousand mewed hawks and seven hundred camels,\n  Four hundred mules with gold Arabian charged,\n  Fifty wagons, yea more than fifty drawing.\n  But into France demands he my departure;\n  He'll follow me to Aix, where is my Castle;\n  There he'll receive the law of our Salvation:\n  Christian he'll be, and hold from me his marches.\n  But I know not what purpose in his heart is.\"\n  Then say the Franks: \"Beseems us act with caution!\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XIV\n\n  That Emperour hath ended now his speech.\n  The Count Rollanz, he never will agree,\n  Quick to reply, he springs upon his feet;\n  And to the King, \"Believe not Marsilie.\n  Seven years since, when into Spain came we,\n  I conquer'd you Noples also Commibles,\n  And took Valterne, and all the land of Pine,\n  And Balaguet, and Tuele, and Sezilie.\n  Traitor in all his ways was Marsilies;\n  Of his pagans he sent you then fifteen,\n  Bearing in hand their olive-branches green:\n  Who, ev'n as now, these very words did speak.\n  You of your Franks a Council did decree,\n  Praised they your words that foolish were in deed.\n  Two of your Counts did to the pagan speed,\n  Basan was one, and the other Basilie:\n  Their heads he took on th' hill by Haltilie.\n  War have you waged, so on to war proceed,\n  To Sarraguce lead forth your great army.\n  All your life long, if need be, lie in siege,\n  Vengeance for those the felon slew to wreak.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XV\n\n  That Emperour he sits with lowering front,\n  He clasps his chin, his beard his fingers tug,\n  Good word nor bad, his nephew not one.\n  Franks hold their peace, but only Guenelun\n  Springs to his feet, and comes before Carlun;\n  Right haughtily his reason he's begun,\n  And to the King: \"Believe not any one,\n  My word nor theirs, save whence your good shall come.\n  Since he sends word, that King Marsiliun,\n  Homage he'll do, by finger and by thumb;\n  Throughout all Spain your writ alone shall run\n  Next he'll receive our rule of Christendom\n  Who shall advise, this bidding be not done,\n  Deserves not death, since all to death must come.\n  Counsel of pride is wrong: we've fought enough.\n  Leave we the fools, and with the wise be one.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XVI\n\n  And after him came Neimes out, the third,\n  Better vassal there was not in the world;\n  And to the King: \"Now rightly have you heard\n  Guenes the Count, what answer he returned.\n  Wisdom was there, but let it well be heard.\n  King Marsilies in war is overturned,\n  His castles all in ruin have you hurled,\n  With catapults his ramparts have you burst,\n  Vanquished his men, and all his cities burned;\n  Him who entreats your pity do not spurn,\n  Sinners were they that would to war return;\n  With hostages his faith he would secure;\n  Let this great war no longer now endure.\"\n  \"Well said the Duke.\"  Franks utter in their turn.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XVII\n\n  \"My lords barons, say whom shall we send up\n  To Sarraguce, to King Marsiliun?\"\n  Answers Duke Neimes: \"I'll go there for your love;\n  Give me therefore the wand, also the glove.\"\n  Answers the King: \"Old man of wisdom pruff;\n  By this white beard, and as these cheeks are rough,\n  You'll not this year so far from me remove;\n  Go sit you down, for none hath called you up.\"\n\n  XVIII\n\n  \"My lords barons, say whom now can we send\n  To th' Sarrazin that Sarraguce defends?\"\n  Answers Rollanz: \"I might go very well.\"\n  \"Certes, you'll not,\" says Oliver his friend,\n  \"For your courage is fierce unto the end,\n  I am afraid you would misapprehend.\n  If the King wills it I might go there well.\"\n  Answers the King: \"Be silent both on bench;\n  Your feet nor his, I say, shall that way wend.\n  Nay, by this beard, that you have seen grow blench,\n  The dozen peers by that would stand condemned.\n  Franks hold their peace; you'd seen them all silent.\n\n  XIX\n\n  Turpins of Reins is risen from his rank,\n  Says to the King: \"In peace now leave your Franks.\n  For seven years you've lingered in this land\n  They have endured much pain and sufferance.\n  Give, Sire, to me the clove, also the wand,\n  I will seek out the Spanish Sarazand,\n  For I believe his thoughts I understand.\"\n  That Emperour answers intolerant:\n  \"Go, sit you down on yonder silken mat;\n  And speak no more, until that I command.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XX\n\n  \"Franks, chevaliers,\" says the Emperour then, Charles,\n  \"Choose ye me out a baron from my marches,\n  To Marsilie shall carry back my answer.\"\n  Then says Rollanz: \"There's Guenes, my goodfather.\"\n  Answer the Franks: \"For he can wisely manage;\n  So let him go, there's none you should send rather.\"\n  And that count Guenes is very full of anguish;\n  Off from his neck he flings the pelts of marten,\n  And on his feet stands clear in silken garment.\n  Proud face he had, his eyes with colour, sparkled;\n  Fine limbs he had, his ribs were broadly arched\n  So fair he seemed that all the court regarded.\n  Says to Rollant: \"Fool, wherefore art so wrathful?\n  All men know well that I am thy goodfather;\n  Thou hast decreed, to Marsiliun I travel.\n  Then if God grant that I return hereafter,\n  I'll follow thee with such a force of passion\n  That will endure so long as life may last thee.\"\n  Answers Rollanz: \"Thou'rt full of pride and madness.\n  All men know well, I take no thought for slander;\n  But some wise man, surely, should bear the answer;\n  If the King will, I'm ready to go rather.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXI\n\n  Answers him Guene: \"Thou shalt not go for me.\n  Thou'rt not my man, nor am I lord of thee.\n  Charles commnds that I do his decree,\n  To Sarraguce going to Marsilie;\n  There I will work a little trickery,\n  This mighty wrath of mine I'll thus let free.\"\n  When Rollanz heard, began to laugh for glee.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXII\n\n  When Guenes sees that Rollant laughs at it,\n  Such grief he has, for rage he's like to split,\n  A little more, and he has lost his wit:\n  Says to that count: \"I love you not a bit;\n  A false judgement you bore me when you chid.\n  Right Emperour, you see me where you sit,\n  I will your word accomplish, as you bid.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXIII\n\n  \"To Sarraguce I must repair, 'tis plain;\n  Whence who goes there returns no more again.\n  Your sister's hand in marriage have I ta'en;\n  And I've a son, there is no prettier swain:\n  Baldwin, men say he shews the knightly strain.\n  To him I leave my honours and domain.\n  Care well for him; he'll look for me in vain.\"\n  Answers him Charles: \"Your heart is too humane.\n  When I command, time is to start amain.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXIV\n\n  Then says the King: \"Guenes, before me stand;\n  And take from me the glove, also the wand.\n  For you have heard, you're chosen by the Franks,\"\n  \"Sire,\" answers Guenes, \"all this is from Rollanz;\n  I'll not love him, so long as I'm a man,\n  Nor Oliver, who goes at his right hand;\n  The dozen peers, for they are of his band,\n  All I defy, as in your sight I stand.\"\n  Then says the King: \"Over intolerant.\n  Now certainly you go when I command.\"\n  \"And go I can; yet have I no warrant\n  Basile had none nor his brother Basant.\"\n\n  XXV\n\n  His right hand glove that Emperour holds out;\n  But the count Guenes elsewhere would fain be found;\n  When he should take, it falls upon the ground.\n  Murmur the Franks: \"God!  What may that mean now?\n  By this message great loss shall come about.\"\n  \"Lordings,\" says Guene, \"You'll soon have news enow.\"\n\n  XXVI\n\n  \"Now,\" Guenes said, \"give me your orders, Sire;\n  Since I must go, why need I linger, I?\"\n  Then said the King \"In Jesu's Name and mine!\"\n  With his right hand he has absolved and signed,\n  Then to his care the wand and brief confides.\n\n  XXVII\n\n  Guenes the count goes to his hostelry,\n  Finds for the road his garments and his gear,\n  All of the best he takes that may appear:\n  Spurs of fine gold he fastens on his feet,\n  And to his side Murgles his sword of steel.\n  On Tachebrun, his charger, next he leaps,\n  His uncle holds the stirrup, Guinemere.\n  Then you had seen so many knights to weep,\n  Who all exclaim: \"Unlucky lord, indeed!\n  In the King's court these many years you've been,\n  Noble vassal, they say that have you seen.\n  He that for you this journey has decreed\n  King Charlemagne will never hold him dear.\n  The Count Rollant, he should not so have deemed,\n  Knowing you were born of very noble breed.\"\n  After they say: \"Us too, Sire, shall he lead.\"\n  Then answers Guenes: \"Not so, the Lord be pleased!\n  Far better one than many knights should bleed.\n  To France the Douce, my lords, you soon shall speed,\n  On my behalf my gentle wife you'll greet,\n  And Pinabel, who is my friend and peer,\n  And Baldewin, my son, whom you have seen;\n  His rights accord and help him in his need.\"\n  --Rides down the road, and on his way goes he.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXVIII\n\n  Guenes canters on, and halts beneath a tree;\n  Where Sarrazins assembled he may see,\n  With Blancandrins, who abides his company.\n  Cunning and keen they speak then, each to each,\n  Says Blancandrins: \"Charles, what a man is he,\n  Who conquered Puille and th'whole of Calabrie;\n  Into England he crossed the bitter sea,\n  To th' Holy Pope restored again his fee.\n  What seeks he now of us in our country?\"\n  Then answers Guene  \"So great courage hath he;\n  Never was man against him might succeed.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXIX\n\n  Says Blancandrins \"Gentle the Franks are found;\n  Yet a great wrong these dukes do and these counts\n  Unto their lord, being in counsel proud;\n  Him and themselves they harry and confound.\"\n  Guenes replies: \"There is none such, without\n  Only Rollanz, whom shame will yet find out.\n  Once in the shade the King had sate him down;\n  His nephew came, in sark of iron brown,\n  Spoils he had won, beyond by Carcasoune,\n  Held in his hand an apple red and round.\n  \"Behold, fair Sire,\" said Rollanz as he bowed,\n  \"Of all earth's kings I bring you here the crowns.\"\n  His cruel pride must shortly him confound,\n  Each day t'wards death he goes a little down,\n  When he be slain, shall peace once more abound.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXX\n\n  Says Blancandrins: \"A cruel man, Rollant,\n  That would bring down to bondage every man,\n  And challenges the peace of every land.\n  With what people takes he this task in hand?\"\n  And answers Guene: \"The people of the Franks;\n  They love him so, for men he'll never want.\n  Silver and gold he show'rs upon his band,\n  Chargers and mules, garments and silken mats.\n  The King himself holds all by his command;\n  From hence to the East he'll conquer sea and land.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXXI\n\n  Cantered so far then Blancandrins and Guene\n  Till each by each a covenant had made\n  And sought a plan, how Rollant might be slain.\n  Cantered so far by valley and by plain\n  To Sarraguce beneath a cliff they came.\n  There a fald-stool stood in a pine-tree's shade,\n  Enveloped all in Alexandrin veils;\n  There was the King that held the whole of Espain,\n  Twenty thousand of Sarrazins his train;\n  Nor was there one but did his speech contain,\n  Eager for news, till they might hear the tale.\n  Haste into sight then Blancandrins and Guene.\n\n  XXXII\n\n  Blancandrin comes before Marsiliun,\n  Holding the hand of county Guenelun;\n  Says to the King \"Lord save you, Sire, Mahum\n  And Apollin, whose holy laws here run!\n  Your message we delivered to Charlun,\n  Both his two hands he raised against the sun,\n  Praising his God, but answer made he none.\n  He sends you here his noblest born barun,\n  Greatest in wealth, that out of France is come;\n  From him you'll hear if peace shall be, or none.\"\n  \"Speak,\" said Marsile: \"We'll hear him, every one.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXXIII\n\n  But the count Guenes did deeply meditate;\n  Cunning and keen began at length, and spake\n  Even as one that knoweth well the way;\n  And to the King: \"May God preserve you safe,\n  The All Glorious, to whom we're bound to pray\n  Proud Charlemagne this message bids me say:\n  You must receive the holy Christian Faith,\n  And yield in fee one half the lands of Spain.\n  If to accord this tribute you disdain,\n  Taken by force and bound in iron chain\n  You will be brought before his throne at Aix;\n  Judged and condemned you'll be, and shortly slain,\n  Yes, you will die in misery and shame.\"\n  King Marsilies was very sore afraid,\n  Snatching a dart, with golden feathers gay,\n  He made to strike: they turned aside his aim.\n                      AOI.\n\n  XXXIV\n\n  King Marsilies is turn'ed white with rage,\n  His feathered dart he brandishes and shakes.\n  Guenes beholds: his sword in hand he takes,\n  Two fingers' width from scabbard bares the blade;\n  And says to it: \"O clear and fair and brave;\n  Before this King in court we'll so behave,\n  That the Emperour of France shall never say\n  In a strange land I'd thrown my life away\n  Before these

him he takes the best among his men;\n  And Blancandrins there shews his snowy hair,\n  And Jursalet, was the King's son and heir,\n  And the alcaliph, his uncle and his friend.\n  Says Blancandrins: \"Summon the Frank again,\n  In our service his faith to me he's pledged.\"\n  Then says the King: \"So let him now be fetched.\"\n  He's taken Guenes by his right finger-ends,\n  And through the

God his soul bare thence.\n  Next he has slain the duke Alphaien,\n  And sliced away Escababi his head,\n  And has unhorsed some seven Arabs else;\n  No good for those to go to war again.\n  Then said Rollanz: \"My comrade shews anger,\n  So in my sight he makes me prize him well;\n  More dear by Charles for such blows are we held.\"\n  Aloud he's cried: \"Strike on, the chevaliers!\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXVI\n\n  From the other part a pagan Valdabron.\n  Warden he'd been to king Marsilion,\n  And lord, by sea, of four hundred dromonds;\n  No sailor was but called his name upon;\n  Jerusalem he'd taken by treason,\n  Violated the Temple of Salomon,\n  The Partiarch had slain before the fonts.\n  He'd pledged his oath by county Guenelon,\n  Gave him his sword, a thousand coins thereon.\n  He sate his horse, which he called Gramimond,\n  Never so swift flew in the air falcon;\n  He's pricked him well, with sharp spurs he had on,\n  Going to strike e'en that rich Duke, Sanson;\n  His shield has split, his hauberk has undone,\n  The ensign's folds have through his body gone,\n  Dead from the hilt out of his seat he's dropt:\n  \"Pagans, strike on, for well we'll overcome!\"\n  \"God!\" say the Franks, \"Grief for a brave baron!\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXVII\n\n  The count Rollanz, when Sansun dead he saw,\n  You may believe, great grief he had therefor.\n  His horse he spurs, gallops with great effort,\n  Wields Durendal, was worth fine gold and more,\n  Goes as he may to strike that baron bold\n  Above the helm, that was embossed with gold,\n  Slices the head, the sark, and all the corse,\n  The good saddle, that was embossed with gold,\n  And cuts deep through the backbone of his horse;\n  He's slain them both, blame him for that or laud.\n  The pagans say: \"'Twas hard on us, that blow.\"\n  Answers Rollanz: \"Nay, love you I can not,\n  For on your side is arrogance and wrong.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXVIII\n\n  Out of Affrike an Affrican was come,\n  'Twas Malquiant, the son of king Malcud;\n  With beaten gold was all his armour done,\n  Fore all men's else it shone beneath the sun.\n  He sate his horse, which he called Salt-Perdut,\n  Never so swift was any beast could run.\n  And Anseis upon the shield he struck,\n  The scarlat with the blue he sliced it up,\n  Of his hauberk he's torn the folds and cut,\n  The steel and stock has through his body thrust.\n  Dead is that count, he's no more time to run.\n  Then say the Franks:  \"Baron, an evil luck!\"\n\n  CXIX\n\n  Swift through the field Turpin the Archbishop passed;\n  Such shaven-crown has never else sung Mass\n  Who with his limbs such prowess might compass;\n  To th'pagan said  \"God send thee all that's bad!\n  One thou hast slain for whom my heart is sad.\"\n  So his good horse forth at his bidding ran,\n  He's struck him then on his shield Toledan,\n  Until he flings him dead on the green grass.\n\n  CXX\n\n  From the other part was a pagan Grandones,\n  Son of Capuel, the king of Capadoce.\n  He sate his horse, the which he called Marmore,\n  Never so swift was any bird in course;\n  He's loosed the reins, and spurring on that horse\n  He's gone to strike Gerin with all his force;\n  The scarlat shield from's neck he's broken off,\n  And all his sark thereafter has he torn,\n  The ensign blue clean through his body's gone,\n  Until he flings him dead, on a high rock;\n  His companion Gerer he's slain also,\n  And Berenger, and Guiun of Santone;\n  Next a rich duke he's gone to strike, Austore,\n  That held Valence and the Honour of the Rhone;\n  He's flung him dead; great joy the pagans shew.\n  Then say the Franks: \"Of ours how many fall.\"\n\n  CXXI\n\n  The count Rollanz, his sword with blood is stained,\n  Well has he heard what way the Franks complained;\n  Such grief he has, his heart would split in twain:\n  To the pagan says: \"God send thee every shame!\n  One hast thou slain that dearly thou'lt repay.\"\n  He spurs his horse, that on with speed doth strain;\n  Which should forfeit, they both together came.\n\n  CXXII\n\n  Grandonie was both proof and valiant,\n  And virtuous, a vassal combatant.\n  Upon the way there, he has met Rollant;\n  He'd never seen, yet knew him at a glance,\n  By the proud face and those fine limbs he had,\n  By his regard, and by his contenance;\n  He could not help but he grew faint thereat,\n  He would escape, nothing avail he can.\n  Struck him the count, with so great virtue, that\n  To the nose-plate he's all the helmet cracked,\n  Sliced through the nose and mouth and teeth he has,\n  Hauberk close-mailed, and all the whole carcass,\n  Saddle of gold, with plates of silver flanked,\n  And of his horse has deeply scarred the back;\n  He's slain them both, they'll make no more attack:\n  The Spanish men in sorrow cry, \"Alack!\"\n  Then say the Franks: \"He strikes well, our warrant.\"\n\n  CXXIII\n\n  Marvellous is the battle in its speed,\n  The Franks there strike with vigour and with heat,\n  Cutting through wrists and ribs and chines in-deed,\n  Through garments to the lively flesh beneath;\n  On the green grass the clear blood runs in streams.\n  The pagans say: \"No more we'll suffer, we.\n  Terra Major, Mahummet's curse on thee!\n  Beyond all men thy people are hardy!\"\n  There was not one but cried then: \"Marsilie,\n  Canter, O king, thy succour now we need!\"\n\n  CXXIV\n\n  Marvellous is the battle now and grand,\n  The Franks there strike, their good brown spears in hand.\n  Then had you seen such sorrowing of clans,\n  So many a slain, shattered and bleeding man!\n  Biting the earth, or piled there on their backs!\n  The Sarrazins cannot such loss withstand.\n  Will they or nill, from off the field draw back;\n  By lively force chase them away the Franks.\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXXV\n\n  Their martyrdom, his men's, Marsile has seen,\n  So he bids sound his horns and his buccines;\n  Then canters forth with all his great army.\n  Canters before a Sarrazin, Abisme,\n  More felon none was in that company;\n  Cankered with guile and every felony,\n  He fears not God, the Son of Saint Mary;\n  Black is that man as molten pitch that seethes;\n  Better he loves murder and treachery\n  Than to have all the gold of Galicie;\n  Never has man beheld him sport for glee;\n  Yet vassalage he's shown, and great folly,\n  So is he dear to th' felon king Marsile;\n  Dragon he bears, to which his tribe rally.\n  That Archbishop could never love him, he;\n  Seeing him there, to strike he's very keen,\n  Within himself he says all quietly:\n  \"This Sarrazin great heretick meseems,\n  Rather I'ld die, than not slay him clean,\n  Neer did I love coward nor cowardice.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXXVI\n\n  That Archbishop begins the fight again,\n  Sitting the horse which he took from Grossaille\n  --That was a king he had in Denmark slain;--\n  That charger is swift and of noble race;\n  Fine are his hooves, his legs are smooth and straight,\n  Short are his thighs, broad crupper he displays,\n  Long are his ribs, aloft his spine is raised,\n  White is his tail and yellow is his mane,\n  Little his ears, and tawny all his face;\n  No beast is there, can match him in a race.\n  That Archbishop spurs on by vassalage,\n  He will not pause ere Abisme he assail;\n  So strikes that shield, is wonderfully arrayed,\n  Whereon are stones, amethyst and topaze,\n  Esterminals and carbuncles that blaze;\n  A devil's gift it was, in Val Metase,\n  Who handed it to the admiral Galafes;\n  So Turpin strikes, spares him not anyway;\n  After that blow, he's worth no penny wage;\n  The carcass he's sliced, rib from rib away,\n  So flings him down dead in an empty place.\n  Then say the Franks: \"He has great vassalage,\n  With the Archbishop, surely the Cross is safe.\"\n\n  CXXVII\n\n  The count Rollanz calls upon Oliver:\n  \"Sir companion, witness you'll freely bear,\n  The Archbishop is a right good chevalier,\n  None better is neath Heaven anywhere;\n  Well can he strike with lance and well with spear.\"\n  Answers that count: \"Support to him we'll bear!\"\n  Upon that word the Franks again make yare;\n  Hard are the blows, slaughter and suffering there,\n  For Christians too, most bitter grief and care.\n  Who could had seen Rollanz and Oliver\n  With their good swords to strike and to slaughter!\n  And the Archbishop lays on there with his spear.\n  Those that are dead, men well may hold them dear.\n  In charters and in briefs is written clear,\n  Four thousand fell, and more, the tales declare.\n  Gainst four assaults easily did they fare,\n  But then the fifth brought heavy griefs to bear.\n  They all are slain, those Frankish chevaliers;\n  Only three-score, whom God was pleased to spare,\n  Before these die, they'll sell them very dear.\n                      AOI.\n\n  CXXVIII\n\n  The count Rollant great loss of his men sees,\n  His companion Olivier calls, and speaks:\n  \"Sir and comrade, in God's Name, That you keeps,\n  Such good vassals you see lie here in heaps;\n  For France the

his pains are very sore;\n  Looks down the vale, looks to the hills above;\n  On the green grass, beyond his companions,\n  He sees him lie, that noble old baron;\n  'Tis the Archbishop, whom in His name wrought God;\n  There he proclaims his sins, and looks above;\n  Joins his two hands, to Heaven holds them forth,\n  And Paradise prays God to him to accord.\n  Dead is Turpin, the warrior of Charlon.\n  In battles great and very rare sermons\n  Against pagans ever a champion.\n  God grant him now His Benediction!\n                      AOI.\n\n  CLXVII\n\n  The count Rollant sees the Archbishop lie dead,\n  Sees the bowels out of his body shed,\n  And sees the brains that surge from his forehead;\n  Between his two arm-pits, upon his breast,\n  Crossways he folds those hands so white and fair.\n  Then mourns aloud, as was the custom there:\n  \"Thee, gentle sir, chevalier nobly bred,\n  To the Glorious Celestial I commend;\n  Neer shall man be, that will Him serve so well;\n  Since the Apostles was never such prophet,\n  To hold the laws and draw the hearts of men.\n  Now may your soul no pain nor sorrow ken,\n  Finding the gates of Paradise open!\"\n\n  CLXVIII\n\n  Then Rollanz feels that death to him draws near,\n  For all his brain is issued from his ears;\n  He prays to God that He will call the peers,\n  Bids Gabriel, the angel, t' himself appear.\n  Takes the olifant, that no reproach shall hear,\n  And Durendal in the other hand he wields;\n  Further than might a cross-bow's arrow speed\n  Goes towards Spain into a fallow-field;\n  Climbs on a cliff; where, under two fair trees,\n  Four terraces, of marble wrought, he sees.\n  There he falls down, and lies upon the green;\n  He swoons again, for death is very near.\n\n  CLXIX\n\n  High are the peaks, the trees are very high.\n  Four terraces of polished marble shine;\n  On the green grass count Rollant swoons thereby.\n  A Sarrazin him all the time espies,\n  Who feigning death among the others hides;\n  Blood hath his face and all his body dyed;\n  He gets afoot, running towards him hies;\n  Fair was he, strong and of a courage high;\n  A mortal hate he's kindled in his pride.\n  He's seized Rollant, and the arms, were at his side,\n  \"Charles nephew,\" he's said, \"here conquered lies.\n  To Araby I'll bear this sword as prize.\"\n  As he drew it, something the count descried.\n\n  CLXX\n\n  So Rollant felt his sword was taken forth,\n  Opened his eyes, and this word to him spoke\n  \"Thou'rt never one of ours, full well I know.\"\n  Took the olifant, that he would not let go,\n  Struck him on th' helm, that jewelled was with gold,\n  And broke its steel, his skull and all his bones,\n  Out of his head both the two eyes he drove;\n  Dead at his feet he has the pagan thrown:\n  After he's said: \"Culvert, thou wert too bold,\n  Or right or wrong, of my sword seizing hold!\n  They'll dub thee fool, to whom the tale is told.\n  But my great one, my olifant I broke;\n  Fallen from it the crystal and the gold.\"\n\n  CLXXI\n\n  Then Rollanz feels that he has lost his sight,\n  Climbs to his feet, uses what strength he might;\n  In all his face the colour is grown white.\n  In front of him a great brown boulder lies;\n  Whereon ten blows with grief and rage he strikes;\n  The steel cries out, but does not break outright;\n  And the count says: \"Saint Mary, be my guide\n  Good Durendal, unlucky is your plight!\n  I've need of you no more; spent is my pride!\n  We in the field have won so many fights,\n  Combating through so many regions wide\n  That Charles holds, whose beard is hoary white!\n  Be you not his that turns from any in flight!\n  A good vassal has held you this long time;\n  Never shall France the Free behold his like.\"\n\n  CLXXII\n\n  Rollant hath struck the sardonyx terrace;\n  The steel cries out, but broken is no ways.\n  So when he sees he never can it break,\n  Within himself begins he to complain:\n  \"Ah!

flowing blood;\n  Strikes Pinabel on 's helmet brown and rough,\n  To the nose-piece he's broken it and cut,\n  And from his head scatters his brains in th' dust;\n  Brandishes him on th' sword, till dead he's flung.\n  Upon that blow is all the battle won.\n  Franks cry aloud: \"God hath great virtue done.\n  It is proved right that Guenelun be hung.\n  And those his kin, that in his cause are come.\"\n                      AOI.\n\n  CCLXXXVII\n\n  Now that Tierris the battle fairly wins,\n  That Emperour Charles is come to him;\n  Forty barons are in his following.\n  Naimes the Duke, Oger that Danish Prince,\n  Geifrei d'Anjou, Willalme of Blaive therewith.\n  Tierri, the King takes in his arms to kiss;\n  And wipes his face with his great marten-skins;\n  He lays them down, and others then they bring;\n  The chevaliers most sweetly disarm him;\n  An Arab mule they've brought, whereon he sits.\n  With baronage and joy they bring him in.\n  They come to Aix, halt and dismount therein.\n  The punishment of the others then begins.\n\n  CCLXXXVIII\n\n  His counts and Dukes then calls to him Carlun:\n  \"With these I guard, advise what shall be done.\n  Hither they came because of Guenelun;\n  For Pinabel, as pledges gave them up.\"\n  Answer the Franks: \"Shall not of them live one.\"\n  The King commands his provost then, Basbrun:\n  \"Go hang them all on th' tree of cursed wood!\n  Nay, by this beard, whose hairs are white enough,\n  If one escape, to death and shame thou'rt struck!\"\n  He answers him: \"How could I act, save thus?\"\n  With an hundred serjeants by force they come;\n  Thirty of them there are, that straight are hung.\n  Who betrays man, himself and 's friends undoes.\n                      AOI.\n\n  CCLXXXIX\n\n  Then turned away the Baivers and Germans\n  And Poitevins and Bretons and Normans.\n  Fore all the rest, 'twas voted by the Franks\n  That Guenes die with marvellous great pangs;\n  So to lead forth four stallions they bade;\n  After, they bound his feet and both his hands;\n  Those steeds were swift, and of a temper mad;\n  Which, by their heads, led forward four sejeants\n  Towards a stream that flowed amid that land.\n  Sones fell Gue into perdition black;\n  All his sinews were strained until they snapped,\n  And all the limbs were from his body dragged.\n  On the green grass his clear blood gushed and ran.\n  Guenes is dead, a felon recreant.\n  Who betrays man, need make no boast of that.\n\n  CCXC\n\n  When the Emperour had made his whole vengeance,\n  He called to him the Bishops out of France,\n  Those of Baviere and also the Germans:\n  \"A dame free-born lies captive in my hands,\n  So oft she's heard sermons and reprimands,\n  She would fear God, and christening demands.\n  Baptise her then, so God her soul may have.\"\n  They answer him: \"Sponsors the rite demands,\n  Dames of estate and long inheritance.\"\n  The baths at Aix great companies attract;\n  There they baptised the Queen of Sarazands,\n  And found for her the name of Juliane.\n  Christian is she by very cognisance.\n\n  CCXCI\n\n  When the Emperour his justice hath achieved,\n  His mighty wrath's abated from its heat,\n  And Bramimunde has christening received;\n  Passes the day, the darkness is grown deep,\n  And now that King in 's vaulted chamber sleeps.\n  Saint Gabriel is come from God, and speaks:\n  \"Summon the hosts, Charles, of thine Empire,\n  Go thou by force into the land of Bire,\n  King Vivien thou'lt succour there, at Imphe,\n  In the city which pagans have besieged.\n  The Christians there implore thee and beseech.\"\n  Right loth to go, that Emperour was he:\n  \"God!\" said the King: \"My life is hard indeed!\"\n  Tears filled his eyes, he tore his snowy beard.\n\n\n  SO ENDS THE TALE WHICH TUROLD HATH CONCEIVED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Song of Roland, by Anonymous\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1074,"split":"train"}
