After he fails the exam the next day, he walks out of school and takes a ferry across the bay to Oakland. Looking at the boats on the wharf, he imagines the exciting life on a boat.\nHis father, a businessman, has a liberal attitude to his son; but, critical of his recent behavior and poor school report, tells him that he might send him to a military academy. Joe later leaves a farewell note for his family; returning to Oakland, he joins the crew of a sloop, the Dazzler. The captain Pete Le Maire is known as \"French Pete\", and the one other crew member is 'Frisco Kid, a boy of about Joe's age.\nHe soon realizes that French Pete is involved in criminal activity. They take scrap iron from a factory; the job is abandoned when shots are fired. Later, they work as oyster pirates.\nJoe, not wanting to be involved in crime, tries to escape, but each time is thwarted. French Pete tolerates Joe's opinion of him that he is a criminal. 'Frisco Kid tells Joe that he hates his life at sea; he had no family, and once worked for Red Nelson on another sloop, the Reindeer, but ran away. Arrested as a tramp, he was sent to a \"boy's refuge\", where conditions were intolerable; he escaped and joined French Pete. Joe resolves to leave and take 'Frisco Kid with him.\nFrench Pete and his associate Red Nelson steal a safe. Joe sees that it belongs to his father's company. The Dazzler and Reindeer sail into the Pacific, pursued for a time by a yacht; they intend to sail to Mexico. There is soon a storm and the Dazzler's mast breaks. The Reindeer gets close enough for French Pete to jump to onto it but before the boys can follow, the Reindeer disappears under the waves.\nThe Dazzler drifts ashore at Santa Cruz. Joe goes to his father's office. His father makes him \"feel at once as if not the slightest thing uncommon had occurred. It seemed as if he had just returned from a vacation, or, man-grown, had come back from some business trip.\" His father, after hearing his story, says that the $5000 reward for the return of the safe would be shared, 'Frisco Kid's half being held in trust for his future.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cruise of the Dazzler, by Jack London\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

To help parents\nand leaders of youth secure _books boys like best_ that are also best for\nboys, the Boy Scouts of America organized EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY. The books\nincluded, formerly sold at prices ranging from $1.50 to $2.00 but, by\nspecial arrangement with the several publishers interested, are now sold\nin the EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY Edition at $1.00 per volume.\n\nThe books of EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY were selected by the Library Commission\nof the Boy Scouts of America, consisting of George F. Bowerman, Librarian,\nPublic Library of the District of Columbia; Harrison W. Craver, Director,\nEngineering Societies Library, New York City; Claude G. Leland,\nSuperintendent, Bureau of Libraries, Board of Education, New York City;\nEdward F. Stevens, Librarian, Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn, N.Y.,\nand Franklin K. Mathiews, Chief Scout Librarian. Only such books were\nchosen by the Commission as proved to be, by _a nation wide canvas_, most\nin demand by the boys themselves. Their popularity is further attested by\nthe fact that in the EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY Edition, more than a million and\na quarter copies of these books have already been sold.\n\nWe know so well, are reminded so often of the worth of the good book and\ngreat, that too often we fail to observe or understand the influence for\ngood of a boy's recreational reading. Such books may influence him for\ngood or ill as profoundly as his play activities, of which they are a\nvital part. The needful thing is to find stories in which the heroes have\nthe characteristics boys so much admire--unquenchable courage, immense\nresourcefulness, absolute fidelity, conspicuous greatness. We believe the\nbooks of EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY measurably well meet this challenge.\n\nBOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA,\n\nJames E.

There were three\nof them, three boys, in as many bright-colored sweaters, and they\n\"scorched\" along the cycle-path as dangerously near the speed-limit as is\nthe custom of boys in bright-colored sweaters to go. They may have exceeded\nthe speed-limit. A mounted park policeman thought so, but was not sure,\nand contented himself with cautioning them as they flashed by. They\nacknowledged the warning promptly, and on the next turn of the path as\npromptly forgot it, which is also a custom of boys in bright-colored\nsweaters.\n\nShooting out through the entrance to Golden Gate Park, they turned into\nSan Francisco, and took the long sweep of the descending hills at a rate\nthat caused pedestrians to turn and watch them anxiously. Through the\ncity streets the bright sweaters flew, turning and twisting to escape\nclimbing the steeper hills, and, when the steep hills were unavoidable,\ndoing stunts to see which would first gain the top.\n\nThe boy who more often hit up the pace, led the scorching, and instituted\nthe stunts was called Joe by his companions. It was \"follow the leader,\"\nand he led, the merriest and boldest in the bunch. But as they pedaled\ninto the Western Addition, among the large and comfortable residences,\nhis laughter became less loud and frequent, and he unconsciously lagged\nin the rear. At Laguna and Vallejo streets his companions turned off to\nthe right.\n\n\"So long, Fred,\" he called as he turned his wheel to the left. \"So long,\nCharley.\"\n\n\"See you to-night!\" they called back.\n\n\"No--I can't come,\" he answered.\n\n\"Aw, come on,\" they begged.\n\n\"No, I've got to dig.--So long!\"\n\nAs he went on alone, his face grew grave and a vague worry came into his\neyes. He began resolutely to whistle, but this dwindled away till it was\na thin and very subdued little sound, which ceased altogether as he rode\nup the driveway to a large two-storied house.\n\n\"Oh, Joe!\"\n\nHe hesitated before the door to the library. Bessie was there, he knew,\nstudiously working up her lessons. She must be nearly through with them,\ntoo, for she was always done before dinner, and dinner could not be many\nminutes away. As for his lessons, they were as yet untouched. The thought\nmade him angry. It was bad enough to have one's sister--and two years\nyounger at that--in the same grade, but to have her continually head and\nshoulders above him in scholarship was a most intolerable thing. Not that\nhe was dull. No one knew better than himself that he was not dull. But\nsomehow--he did not quite know how--his mind was on other things and he\nwas usually unprepared.\n\n\"Joe--please come here.\" There was the slightest possible plaintive note\nin her voice this time.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, thrusting aside the porti\u00c3\u00a8re with an impetuous movement.\n\nHe said it gruffly, but he was half sorry for it the next instant when he\nsaw a slender little girl regarding him with wistful eyes across the big\nreading-table heaped with books. She was curled up, with pencil and pad,\nin an easy-chair of such generous dimensions that it made her seem more\ndelicate and fragile than she really was.\n\n\"What is it, Sis?\" he asked more gently, crossing over to her side.\n\nShe took his hand in hers and pressed it against her cheek, and as he\nstood beside her came closer to him with a nestling movement.\n\n\"What is the matter, Joe dear?\" she asked softly. \"Won't you tell me?\"\n\nHe remained silent. It struck him as ridiculous to confess his troubles\nto a little sister, even if her reports _were_ higher than his. And the\nlittle sister struck him as ridiculous to demand his troubles of him.\n\"What a soft cheek she has!\" he thought as she pressed her face gently\nagainst his hand. If he could but tear himself away--it was all so\nfoolish! Only he might hurt her feelings, and, in his experience, girls'\nfeelings were very easily hurt.\n\nShe opened his fingers and kissed the palm of his hand. It was like a\nrose-leaf falling; it was also her way of asking her question over again.\n\n\"Nothing 's the matter,\" he said decisively. And then, quite\ninconsistently, he blurted out, \"Father!\"\n\nHis worry was now in her eyes. \"But father is so good and kind, Joe,\" she\nbegan. \"Why don't you try to please him? He does n't ask much of you, and\nit 's all for your own good. It 's not as though you were a fool, like some\nboys. If you would only study a little bit--\"\n\n\"That 's it! Lecturing!\" he exploded, tearing his hand roughly away. \"Even\nyou are beginning to lecture me now. I suppose the cook and the stable-boy\nwill be at it next.\"\n\nHe shoved his hands into his pockets and looked forward into a melancholy\nand desolate future filled with interminable lectures and lecturers\ninnumerable.\n\n\"Was that what you wanted me for?\" he demanded, turning to go.\n\nShe caught at his hand again. \"No, it wasn't; only you looked so worried\nthat I thought--I--\" Her voice broke, and she began again freshly. \"What\nI wanted to tell you was that we're planning a trip across the bay to\nOakland, next Saturday, for a tramp in the hills.\"\n\n\"Who 's going?\"\n\n\"Myrtle Hayes--\"\n\n\"What! That little softy?\" he interrupted.\n\n\"I don't think she is a softy,\" Bessie answered with spirit. \"She 's one\nof the sweetest girls I know.\"\n\n\"Which is n't saying much, considering the girls you know. But go on. Who\nare the others?\"\n\n\"Pearl Sayther, and her sister Alice, and Jessie Hilborn, and Sadie French,\nand Edna Crothers. That 's all the girls.\"\n\nJoe sniffed disdainfully. \"Who are the fellows, then?\"\n\n\"Maurice and Felix Clement, Dick Schofield, Burt Layton, and--\"\n\n\"That 's enough. Milk-and-water chaps, all of them.\"\n\n\"I--I wanted to ask you and Fred and Charley,\" she said in a quavering\nvoice. \"That 's what I called you in for--to ask you to come.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Walk, gather wild flowers,--the poppies are all out now,--eat luncheon\nat some nice place, and--and--\"\n\n\"Come home,\" he finished for her.\n\nBessie nodded her head. Joe put his hands in his pockets again, and\nwalked up and down.\n\n\"A sissy outfit, that 's what it is,\" he said abruptly; \"and a sissy\nprogram. None of it in mine, please.\"\n\nShe tightened her trembling lips and struggled on bravely. \"What would\nyou rather do?\" she asked.\n\n\"I 'd sooner take Fred and Charley and go off somewhere and do\nsomething--well, anything.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at her. She was waiting patiently for him to proceed.\nHe was aware of his inability to express in words what he felt and wanted,\nand all his trouble and general dissatisfaction rose up and gripped hold\nof him.\n\n\"Oh, you can't understand!\" he burst out. \"You can't understand. You 're\na girl. You like to be prim and neat, and to be good in deportment and\nahead in your studies. You don't care for danger and adventure and such\nthings, and you don't care for boys who are rough, and have life and go\nin them, and all that. You like good little boys in white collars, with\nclothes always clean and hair always combed, who like to stay in at\nrecess and be petted by the teacher and told how they're always up in\ntheir studies; nice little boys who never get into scrapes--who are too\nbusy walking around and picking flowers and eating lunches with girls,\nto get into scrapes. Oh, I know the kind--afraid of their own shadows,\nand no more spunk in them than in so many sheep. That 's what they\nare--sheep. Well, I 'm not a sheep, and there 's no more to be said.\nAnd I don't want to go on your picnic, and, what 's more, I 'm not going.\"\n\nThe tears welled up in Bessie's brown eyes, and her lips were trembling.\nThis angered him unreasonably. What were girls good for, anyway?--always\nblubbering, and interfering, and carrying on. There was no sense in them.\n\n\"A fellow can't say anything without making you cry,\" he began, trying to\nappease her. \"Why, I did n't mean anything, Sis. I did n't, sure. I--\"\n\nHe paused helplessly and looked down at her. She was sobbing, and at the\nsame time shaking with the effort to control her sobs, while big tears\nwere rolling down her cheeks.\n\n\"Oh, you--you girls!\" he cried, and strode wrathfully out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"THE DRACONIAN REFORMS\"\n\n\nA few minutes later, and still wrathful, Joe went in to dinner. He ate\nsilently, though his father and mother and Bessie kept up a genial flow\nof conversation. There she was, he communed savagely with his plate,\ncrying one minute, and the next all smiles and laughter. Now that was\nn't his way. If _he_ had anything sufficiently important to cry about,\nrest assured he would n't get over it for days. Girls were hypocrites,\nthat was all there was to it. They did n't feel one hundredth part of all\nthat they said when they cried. It stood to reason that they did n't. It\nmust be that they just carried on because they enjoyed it. It made them\nfeel good to make other people miserable, especially boys. That was why\nthey were always interfering.\n\nThus reflecting sagely, he kept his eyes on his plate and did justice\nto the fare; for one cannot scorch from the Cliff House to the Western\nAddition via the park without being guilty of a healthy appetite.\n\nNow and then his father directed a glance at him in a certain mildly\nanxious way. Joe did not see these glances, but Bessie saw them, every\none. Mr. Bronson was a middle-aged man, well developed and of heavy\nbuild, though not fat. His was a rugged face, square-jawed and\nstern-featured, though his eyes were kindly and there were lines about\nthe mouth that betokened laughter rather than severity. A close\nexamination was not required to discover the resemblance between him\nand Joe. The same broad forehead and strong jaw characterized them both,\nand the eyes, taking into consideration the difference of age, were as\nlike as peas from one pod.\n\n\"How are you getting on, Joe?\" Mr. Bronson asked finally. Dinner was\nover and they were about to leave the table.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Joe answered carelessly, and then added: \"We have\nexaminations to-morrow. I'll know then.\"\n\n\"Whither bound?\" his mother questioned, as he turned to leave the room.\nShe was a slender, willowy woman, whose brown eyes Bessie's were, and\nlikewise her tender ways.\n\n\"To my room,\" Joe answered. \"To work,\" he supplemented.\n\nShe rumpled his hair affectionately, and bent and kissed him. Mr. Bronson\nsmiled approval at him as he went out, and he hurried up the stairs,\nresolved to dig hard and pass the examinations of the coming day.\n\nEntering his room, he locked the door and sat down at a desk most\ncomfortably arranged for a boy's study. He ran his eye over his\ntext-books. The history examination came the first thing in the morning,\nso he would begin on that. He opened the book where a page was turned\ndown, and began to read:\n\n  Shortly after the Draconian reforms, a war\n  broke out between Athens and Megara respecting\n  the island of Salamis, to which both cities\n  laid claim.\n\nThat was easy; but what were the Draconian reforms? He must look them up.\nHe felt quite studious as he ran over the back pages, till he chanced to\nraise his eyes above the top of the book and saw on a chair a baseball\nmask and a catcher's glove. They should n't have lost that game last\nSaturday, he thought, and they would n't have, either, if it had n't been\nfor Fred. He wished Fred would n't fumble so. He could hold a hundred\ndifficult balls in succession, but when a critical point came, he 'd let\ngo of even a dewdrop. He 'd have to send him out in the field and bring\nin Jones to first base. Only Jones was so excitable. He could hold any\nkind of a ball, no matter how critical the play was, but there was no\ntelling what he would do with the ball after he got it.\n\nJoe came to himself with a start. A pretty way of studying history! He\nburied his head in his book and began:\n\n  Shortly after the Draconian reforms--\n\nHe read the sentence through three times, and then recollected that he\nhad not looked up the Draconian reforms.\n\nA knock came at the door. He turned the pages over with a noisy flutter,\nbut made no answer.\n\nThe knock was repeated, and Bessie's \"Joe, dear\" came to his ears.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he demanded. But before she could answer he hurried\non: \"No admittance. I 'm busy.\"\n\n\"I came to see if I could help you,\" she pleaded. \"I 'm all done, and I\nthought--\"\n\n\"Of course you 're all done!\" he shouted. \"You always are!\"\n\nHe held his head in both his hands to keep his eyes on the book. But\nthe baseball mask bothered him. The more he attempted to keep his mind\non the history the more in his mind's eye he saw the mask resting on the\nchair and all the games in which it had played its part.\n\nThis would never do. He deliberately placed the book face downward on the\ndesk and walked over to the chair. With a swift sweep he sent both mask\nand glove hurtling under the bed, and so violently that he heard the mask\nrebound from the wall.\n\n  Shortly after the Draconian reforms, a war\n  broke out between Athens and Megara--\n\nThe mask had rolled back from the wall. He wondered if it had rolled back\nfar enough for him to see it. No, he would n't look. What did it matter if\nit had rolled out? That was n't history. He wondered--\n\nHe peered over the top of the book, and there was the mask peeping out at\nhim from under the edge of the bed. This was not to be borne. There was\nno use attempting to study while that mask was around. He went over and\nfished it out, crossed the room to the closet, and tossed it inside, then\nlocked the door. That was settled, thank goodness! Now he could do some\nwork.\n\nHe sat down again.\n\n  Shortly after the Draconian reforms, a war\n  broke out between Athens and Megara respecting\n  the island of Salamis, to which, both cities\n  laid claim.\n\nWhich was all very well, if he had only found out what the Draconian\nreforms were. A soft glow pervaded the room, and he suddenly became\naware of it. What could cause it? He looked out of the window. The\nsetting sun was slanting its long rays against low-hanging masses of\nsummer clouds, turning them to warm scarlet and rosy red; and it was\nfrom them that the red light, mellow and glowing, was flung earthward.\n\nHis gaze dropped from the clouds to the bay beneath. The sea-breeze was\ndying down with the day, and off Fort Point a fishing-boat was creeping\ninto port before the last light breeze. A little beyond, a tug was\nsending up a twisted pillar of smoke as it towed a three-masted schooner\nto sea. His eyes wandered over toward the Marin County shore. The line\nwhere land and water met was already in darkness, and long shadows were\ncreeping up the hills toward Mount Tamalpais, which was sharply\nsilhouetted against the western sky.\n\nOh, if he, Joe Bronson, were only on that fishing-boat and sailing in\nwith a deep-sea catch! Or if he were on that schooner, heading out into\nthe sunset, into the world! That was life, that was living, doing\nsomething and being something in the world. And, instead, here he was,\npent up in a close room, racking his brains about people dead and gone\nthousands of years before he was born.\n\nHe jerked himself away from the window as though held there by some\nphysical force, and resolutely carried his chair and history into the\nfarthest corner of the room, where he sat down with his back to the\nwindow.\n\nAn instant later, so it seemed to him, he found himself again staring\nout of the window and dreaming. How he had got there he did not know.\nHis last recollection was the finding of a subheading on a page on the\nright-hand side of the book which read: \"The Laws and Constitution of\nDraco.\" And then, evidently like walking in one's sleep, he had come\nto the window. How long had he been there? he wondered. The fishing-boat\nwhich he had seen off Fort Point was now crawling into Meiggs's Wharf.\nThis denoted nearly an hour's lapse of time. The sun had long since set;\na solemn grayness was brooding over the water, and the first faint stars\nwere beginning to twinkle over the crest of Mount Tamalpais.\n\nHe turned, with a sigh, to go back into his corner, when a long whistle,\nshrill and piercing, came to his ears. That was Fred. He sighed again.\nThe whistle repeated itself. Then another whistle joined it. That was\nCharley. They were waiting on the corner--lucky fellows!\n\nWell, they would n't see him this night. Both whistles arose in duet. He\nwrithed in his chair and groaned. No, they would n't see him this night,\nhe reiterated, at the same time rising to his feet. It was certainly\nimpossible for him to join them when he had not yet learned about the\nDraconian reforms. The same force which had held him to the window now\nseemed drawing him across the room to the desk. It made him put the\nhistory on top of his school-books, and he had the door unlocked and\nwas half-way into the hall before he realized it. He started to return,\nbut the thought came to him that he could go out for a little while and\nthen come back and do his work.\n\nA very little while, he promised himself, as he went down-stairs. He\nwent down faster and faster, till at the bottom he was going three\nsteps at a time. He popped his cap on his head and went out of the\nside entrance in a rush; and ere he reached the corner the reforms of\nDraco were as far away in the past as Draco himself, while the examinations\non the morrow were equally far away in the future.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\"BRICK,\" \"SORREL-TOP,\" AND \"REDDY\"\n\n\n\"What 's up?\" Joe asked, as he joined Fred and Charley.\n\n\"Kites,\" Charley answered. \"Come on. We 're tired out waiting for you.\"\n\nThe three set off down the street to the brow of the hill, where they\nlooked down upon Union Street, far below and almost under their feet.\nThis they called the Pit, and it was well named. Themselves they called\nthe Hill-dwellers, and a descent into the Pit by the Hill-dwellers was\nlooked upon by them as a great adventure.\n\nScientific kite-flying was one of the keenest pleasures of these three\nparticular Hill-dwellers, and six or eight kites strung out on a mile\nof twine and soaring into the clouds was an ordinary achievement for\nthem. They were compelled to replenish their kite-supply often; for\nwhenever an accident occurred, and the string broke, or a ducking kite\ndragged down the rest, or the wind suddenly died out, their kites fell\ninto the Pit, from which place they were unrecoverable. The reason for\nthis was the young people of the Pit were a piratical and robber race\nwith peculiar ideas of ownership and property rights.\n\nOn a day following an accident to a kite of one of the Hill-dwellers,\nthe self-same kite could be seen riding the air attached to a string\nwhich led down into the Pit to the lairs of the Pit People. So it came\nabout that the Pit People, who were a poor folk and unable to afford\nscientific kite-flying, developed great proficiency in the art when\ntheir neighbors the Hill-dwellers took it up.\n\nThere was also an old sailorman who profited by this recreation of the\nHill-dwellers; for he was learned in sails and air-currents, and being\ndeft of hand and cunning, he fashioned the best-flying kites that could\nbe obtained. He lived in a rattletrap shanty close to the water, where\nhe could still watch with dim eyes the ebb and flow of the tide, and the\nships pass out and in, and where he could revive old memories of the days\nwhen he, too, went down to the sea in ships.\n\nTo reach his shanty from the Hill one had to pass through the Pit, and\nthither the three boys were bound. They had often gone for kites in the\ndaytime, but this was their first trip after dark, and they felt it to\nbe, as it indeed was, a hazardous adventure.\n\nIn simple words, the Pit was merely the cramped and narrow quarters\nof the poor, where many nationalities crowded together in cosmopolitan\nconfusion, and lived as best they could, amid much dirt and squalor.\nIt was still early evening when the boys passed through on their way\nto the sailorman's shanty, and no mishap befell them, though some of\nthe Pit boys stared at them savagely and hurled a taunting remark after\nthem, now and then.\n\nThe sailorman made kites which were not only splendid fliers but which\nfolded up and were very convenient to carry. Each of the boys bought a\nfew, and, with them wrapped in compact bundles and under their arms,\nstarted back on the return journey.\n\n\"Keep a sharp lookout for the b'ys,\" the kite-maker cautioned them.\n\"They 're like to be cruisin' round after dark.\"\n\n\"We 're not afraid,\" Charley assured him; \"and we know how to take care\nof ourselves.\"\n\nUsed to the broad and quiet streets of the Hill, the boys were shocked\nand stunned by the life that teemed in the close-packed quarter. It\nseemed some thick and monstrous growth of vegetation, and that they\nwere wading through it. They shrank closely together in the tangle of\nnarrow streets as though for protection, conscious of the strangeness\nof it all, and how unrelated they were to it.\n\nChildren and babies sprawled on the sidewalk and under their feet.\nBareheaded and unkempt women gossiped in the doorways or passed back\nand forth with scant marketings in their arms. There was a general\nodor of decaying fruit and fish, a smell of staleness and putridity.\nBig hulking men slouched by, and ragged little girls walked gingerly\nthrough the confusion with foaming buckets of beer in their hands.\nThere was a clatter and garble of foreign tongues and brogues, shrill\ncries, quarrels and wrangles, and the Pit pulsed with a great and\nsteady murmur, like the hum of the human hive that it was.\n\n\"Phew! I 'll be glad when we 're out of it,\" Fred said.\n\nHe spoke in a whisper, and Joe and Charley nodded grimly that they agreed\nwith him. They were not inclined to speech, and they walked as rapidly as\nthe crowd permitted, with much the same feelings as those of travelers in\na dangerous and hostile jungle.\n\nAnd danger and hostility stalked in the Pit. The inhabitants seemed to\nresent the presence of these strangers from the Hill. Dirty little urchins\nabused them as they passed, snarling with assumed bravery, and prepared\nto run away at the first sign of attack. And still other little urchins\nformed a noisy parade at the heels of the boys, and grew bolder with\nincreasing numbers.\n\n\"Don't mind them,\" Joe cautioned. \"Take no notice, but keep right on.\nWe 'll soon be out of it.\"\n\n\"No; we 're in for it,\" said Fred, in an undertone. \"Look there!\"\n\nOn the corner they were approaching, four or five boys of about their\nown age were standing. The light from a street-lamp fell upon them and\ndisclosed one with vivid red hair. It could be no other than \"Brick\"\nSimpson, the redoubtable leader of a redoubtable gang. Twice within\ntheir memory he had led his gang up the Hill and spread panic and\nterror among the Hill-dwelling young folk, who fled wildly to their\nhomes, while their fathers and mothers hurriedly telephoned for the\npolice.\n\nAt sight of the group on the corner, the rabble at the heels of the\nthree boys melted away on the instant with like manifestations of\nfear. This but increased the anxiety of the boys, though they held\nboldly on their way.\n\nThe red-haired boy detached himself from the group, and stepped before\nthem, blocking their path. They essayed to go around him, but he stretched\nout his arm.\n\n\"Wot yer doin' here?\" he snarled. \"Why don't yer stay where yer b'long?\"\n\n\"We 're just going home,\" Fred said mildly.\n\nBrick looked at Joe. \"Wot yer got under yer arm?\" he demanded.\n\nJoe contained himself and took no heed of him. \"Come on,\" he said to Fred\nand Charley, at the same time starting to brush past the gang-leader.\n\nBut with a quick blow Brick Simpson struck him in the face, and with\nequal quickness snatched the bundle of kites from under his arm.\n\nJoe uttered an inarticulate cry of rage, and, all caution flung to the\nwinds, sprang at his assailant.\n\nThis was evidently a surprise to the gang-leader, who expected least of\nall to be attacked in his own territory. He retreated backward, still\nclutching the kites, and divided between desire to fight and desire to\nretain his capture.\n\nThe latter desire dominated him, and he turned and fled swiftly down\nthe narrow side-street into a labyrinth of streets and alleys. Joe knew\nthat he was plunging into the wilderness of the enemy's country, but\nhis sense of both property and pride had been offended, and he took up\nthe pursuit hot-footed.\n\nFred and Charley followed after, though he outdistanced them, and behind\ncame the three other members of the gang, emitting a whistling call while\nthey ran which was evidently intended for the assembling of the rest of\nthe band. As the chase proceeded, these whistles were answered from many\ndifferent directions, and soon a score of dark figures were tagging at\nthe heels of Fred and Charley, who, in turn, were straining every muscle\nto keep the swifter-footed Joe in sight.\n\nBrick Simpson darted into a vacant lot, aiming for a \"slip,\" as such\nthings are called which are prearranged passages through fences and\nover sheds and houses and around dark holes and corners, where the\nunfamiliar pursuer must go more carefully and where the chances are\nmany that he will soon lose the track.\n\nBut Joe caught Brick before he could attain his end, and together they\nrolled over and over in the dirt, locked in each other's arms. By the\ntime Fred and Charley and the gang had come up, they were on their feet,\nfacing each other.\n\n\"Wot d' ye want, eh?\" the red-headed gang-leader was saying in a bullying\ntone. \"Wot d' ye want? That 's wot I wanter know.\"\n\n\"I want my kites,\" Joe answered.\n\nBrick Simpson's eyes sparkled at the intelligence. Kites were something\nhe stood in need of himself.\n\n\"Then you 've got to fight fer 'em,\" he announced.\n\n\"Why should I fight for them?\" Joe demanded indignantly. \"They 're mine.\"\nWhich went to show how ignorant he was of the ideas of ownership and\nproperty rights which obtained among the People of the Pit.\n\nA chorus of jeers and catcalls went up from the gang, which clustered\nbehind its leader like a pack of wolves.\n\n\"Why should I fight for them?\" Joe reiterated.\n\n\"'Cos I say so,\" Simpson replied. \"An' wot I say goes. Understand?\"\n\nBut Joe did not understand. He refused to understand that Brick Simpson's\nword was law in San Francisco, or any part of San Francisco. His love of\nhonesty and right dealing was offended, and all his fighting blood was up.\n\n\"You give those kites to me, right here and now,\" he threatened, reaching\nout his hand for them.\n\nBut Simpson jerked them away. \"D' ye know who I am?\" he demanded. \"I\n'm Brick Simpson, an' I don't 'low no one to talk to me in that tone\nof voice.\"\n\n\"Better leave him alone,\" Charley whispered in Joe's ear. \"What are a\nfew kites? Leave him alone and let 's get out of this.\"\n\n\"They 're my kites,\" Joe said slowly in a dogged manner. \"They 're my\nkites, and I 'm going to have them.\"\n\n\"You can't fight the crowd,\" Fred interfered; \"and if you do get the\nbest of him they 'll all pile on you.\"\n\nThe gang, observing this whispered colloquy, and mistaking it for\nhesitancy on the part of Joe, set up its wolf-like howling again.\n\n\"Afraid! afraid!\" the young roughs jeered and taunted. \"He 's too\nhigh-toned, he is! Mebbe he 'll spoil his nice clean shirt, and then\nwhat 'll mama say?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" their leader snapped authoritatively, and the noise obediently\ndied away.\n\n\"Will you give me those kites?\" Joe demanded, advancing determinedly.\n\n\"Will you fight for 'em?\" was Simpson's counter-demand.\n\n\"Yes,\" Joe answered.\n\n\"Fight! fight!\" the gang began to howl again.\n\n\"And it 's me that 'll see fair play,\" said a man's heavy voice.\n\nAll eyes were instantly turned upon the man who had approached unseen and\nmade this announcement. By the electric light, shining brightly on them\nfrom the corner, they made him out to be a big, muscular fellow, clad in\na working-man's garments. His feet were incased in heavy brogans, a narrow\nstrap of black leather held his overalls about his waist, and a black and\ngreasy cap was on his head. His face was grimed with coal-dust, and a\ncoarse blue shirt, open at the neck, revealed a wide throat and massive\nchest.\n\n\"An' who 're you?\" Simpson snarled, angry at the interruption.\n\n\"None of yer business,\" the newcomer retorted tartly. \"But, if it 'll\ndo you any good, I 'm a fireman on the China steamers, and, as I said,\nI 'm goin' to see fair play. That 's my business. Your business is to\ngive fair play. So pitch in, and don't be all night about it.\"\n\nThe three boys were as pleased by the appearance of the fireman as Simpson\nand his followers were displeased. They conferred together for several\nminutes, when Simpson deposited the bundle of kites in the arms of one\nof his gang and stepped forward.\n\n\"Come on, then,\" he said, at the same time pulling off his coat.\n\nJoe handed his to Fred, and sprang toward Brick. They put up their fists\nand faced each other. Almost instantly Simpson drove in a fierce blow and\nducked cleverly away and out of reach of the blow which Joe returned. Joe\nfelt a sudden respect for the abilities of his antagonist, but the only\neffect upon him was to arouse all the doggedness of his nature and make\nhim utterly determined to win.\n\nAwed by the presence of the fireman, Simpson's followers confined\nthemselves to cheering Brick and jeering Joe. The two boys circled\nround and round, attacking, feinting, and guarding, and now one and\nthen the other getting in a telling blow. Their positions were in marked\ncontrast. Joe stood erect, planted solidly on his feet, with legs wide\napart and head up. On the other hand, Simpson crouched till his head was\nnearly lost between his shoulders, and all the while he was in constant\nmotion, leaping and springing and manoeuvering in the execution of a\nscore or more of tricks quite new and strange to Joe.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, both were very tired, though Joe was\nmuch fresher. Tobacco, ill food, and unhealthy living were telling on\nthe gang-leader, who was panting and sobbing for breath. Though at first\n(and because of superior skill) he had severely punished Joe, he was now\nweak and his blows were without force. Growing desperate, he adopted\nwhat might be called not an unfair but a mean method of attack: he would\nmanoeuver, leap in and strike swiftly, and then, ducking forward, fall\nto the ground at Joe's feet. Joe could not strike him while he was down,\nand so would step back until he could get on his feet again, when the\nthing would be repeated.\n\nBut Joe grew tired of this, and prepared for him. Timing his blow with\nSimpson's attack, he delivered it just as Simpson was ducking forward\nto fall. Simpson fell, but he fell over on one side, whither he had\nbeen driven by the impact of Joe's fist upon his head. He rolled over\nand got half-way to his feet, where he remained, crying and gasping.\nHis followers called upon him to get up, and he tried once or twice,\nbut was too exhausted and stunned.\n\n\"I give in,\" he said. \"I 'm licked.\"\n\nThe gang had become silent and depressed at its leader's defeat.\n\nJoe stepped forward.\n\n\"I 'll trouble you for those kites,\" he said to the boy who was\nholding them.\n\n\"Oh, I dunno,\" said another member of the gang, shoving in between\nJoe and his property. His hair was also a vivid red. \"You 've got\nto lick me before you kin have 'em.\"\n\n\"I don't see that,\" Joe said bluntly. \"I 've fought and I 've won,\nand there 's nothing more to it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, there is,\" said the other. \"I 'm 'Sorrel-top' Simpson.\nBrick 's my brother. See?\"\n\nAnd so, in this fashion, Joe learned another custom of the Pit People\nof which he had been ignorant.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, his fighting blood more fully aroused than ever\nby the unjustness of the proceeding. \"Come on.\"\n\nSorrel-top Simpson, a year younger than his brother, proved to be a\nmost unfair fighter, and the good-natured fireman was compelled to\ninterfere several times before the second of the Simpson clan lay on\nthe ground and acknowledged defeat.\n\nThis time Joe reached for his kites without the slightest doubt that\nhe was to get them. But still another lad stepped in between him and\nhis property. The telltale hair, vividly red, sprouted likewise on\nthis lad's head, and Joe knew him at once for what he was, another\nmember of the Simpson clan. He was a younger edition of his brothers,\nsomewhat less heavily built, with a face covered with a vast quantity\nof freckles, which showed plainly under the electric light.\n\n\"You don't git them there kites till you git me,\" he challenged in\na piping little voice. \"I 'm 'Reddy' Simpson, an' you ain't licked\nthe fambly till you 've licked me.\"\n\nThe gang cheered admiringly, and Reddy stripped a tattered jacket\npreparatory for the fray.\n\n\"Git ready,\" he said to Joe.\n\nJoe's knuckles were torn, his nose was bleeding, his lip was cut and\nswollen, while his shirt had been ripped down from throat to waist.\nFurther, he was tired, and breathing hard.\n\n\"How many more are there of you Simpsons?\" he asked. \"I 've got to\nget home, and if your family 's much larger this thing is liable\nto keep on all night.\"\n\n\"I 'm the last an' the best,\" Reddy replied. \"You gits me an' you\ngits the kites. Sure.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Joe sighed. \"Come on.\"\n\nWhile the youngest of the clan lacked the strength and skill of his\nelders, he made up for it by a wildcat manner of fighting that taxed\nJoe severely. Time and again it seemed to him that he must give in\nto the little whirlwind; but each time he pulled himself together\nand went doggedly on. For he felt that he was fighting for principle,\nas his forefathers had fought for principle; also, it seemed to him that\nthe honor of the Hill was at stake, and that he, as its representative,\ncould do nothing less than his very best.\n\nSo he held on and managed to endure his opponent's swift and continuous\nrushes till that young and less experienced person at last wore himself\nout with his own exertions, and from the ground confessed that, for the\nfirst time in its history, the \"Simpson fambly was beat.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE BITER BITTEN\n\n\nBut life in the Pit at best was a precarious affair, as the three\nHill-dwellers were quickly to learn. Before Joe could even possess\nhimself of his kites, his astonished eyes were greeted with the\nspectacle of all his enemies, the fireman included, taking to their\nheels in wild flight. As the little girls and urchins had melted away\nbefore the Simpson gang, so was melting away the Simpson gang before\nsome new and correspondingly awe-inspiring group of predatory creatures.\n\nJoe heard terrified cries of \"Fish gang!\" \"Fish gang!\" from those who\nfled, and he would have fled himself from this new danger, only he was\nbreathless from his last encounter, and knew the impossibility of\nescaping whatever threatened. Fred and Charley felt mighty longings\nto run away from a danger great enough to frighten the redoubtable\nSimpson gang and the valorous fireman, but they could not desert\ntheir comrade.\n\nDark forms broke into the vacant lot, some surrounding the boys and\nothers dashing after the fugitives. That the laggards were overtaken\nwas evidenced by the cries of distress that went up, and when later\nthe pursuers returned, they brought with them the luckless and snarling\nBrick, still clinging fast to the bundle of kites.\n\nJoe looked curiously at this latest band of marauders. They were young\nmen of from seventeen and eighteen to twenty-three and -four years of\nage, and bore the unmistakable stamp of the hoodlum class. There were\nvicious faces among them--faces so vicious as to make Joe's flesh creep\nas he looked at them. A couple grasped him tightly by the arms, and\nFred and Charley were similarly held captive.\n\n\"Look here, you,\" said one who spoke with the authority of leader,\n\"we 've got to inquire into this. Wot 's be'n goin' on here? Wot 're\nyou up to, Red-head? Wot you be'n doin'?\"\n\n\"Ain't be'n doin' nothin',\" Simpson whined.\n\n\"Looks like it.\" The leader turned up Brick's face to the electric\nlight. \"Who 's been paintin' you up like that?\" he demanded.\n\nBrick pointed at Joe, who was forthwith dragged to the front.\n\n\"Wot was you scrappin' about?\"\n\n\"Kites--my kites,\" Joe spoke up boldly. \"That fellow tried to take them\naway from me. He 's got them under his arm now.\"\n\n\"Oh, he has, has he? Look here, you Brick, we don't put up with stealin'\nin this territory. See? You never rightly owned nothin'. Come, fork over\nthe kites. Last call.\"\n\nThe leader tightened his grasp threateningly, and Simpson, weeping tears\nof rage, surrendered the plunder.\n\n\"Wot yer got under yer arm?\" the leader demanded abruptly of Fred, at the\nsame time jerking out the bundle. \"More kites, eh? Reg'lar kite-factory\ngone and got itself lost,\" he remarked finally, when he had appropriated\nCharley's bundle. \"Now, wot I wants to know is wot we 're goin' to do to\nyou t'ree chaps?\" he continued in a judicial tone.\n\n\"What for?\" Joe demanded hotly. \"For being robbed of our kites?\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all,\" the leader responded politely; \"but for luggin'\nkites round these quarters an' causin' all this unseemly disturbance.\nIt 's disgraceful; that 's wot it is--disgraceful.\"\n\nAt this juncture, when the Hill-dwellers were the center of attraction,\nBrick suddenly wormed out of his jacket, squirmed away from his captors,\nand dashed across the lot to the slip for which he had been originally\nheaded when overtaken by Joe. Two or three of the gang shot over the\nfence after him in noisy pursuit. There was much barking and howling of\nback-yard dogs and clattering of shoes over sheds and boxes. Then there\ncame a splashing of water, as though a barrel of it had been precipitated\nto the ground. Several minutes later the pursuers returned, very sheepish\nand very wet from the deluge presented them by the wily Brick, whose\nvoice, high up in the air from some friendly housetop, could be heard\ndefiantly jeering them.\n\nThis event apparently disconcerted the leader of the gang, and just as\nhe turned to Joe and Fred and Charley, a long and peculiar whistle came\nto their ears from the street--the warning signal, evidently, of a scout\nposted to keep a lookout. The next moment the scout himself came flying\nback to the main body, which was already beginning to retreat.\n\n\"Cops!\" he panted.\n\nJoe looked, and he saw two helmeted policemen approaching, with bright\nstars shining on their breasts.\n\n\"Let 's get out of this,\" he whispered to Fred and Charley.\n\nThe gang had already taken to flight, and they blocked the boys' retreat\nin one quarter, and in another they saw the policemen advancing. So they\ntook to their heels in the direction of Brick Simpson's slip, the policemen\nhot after them and yelling bravely for them to halt.\n\nBut young feet are nimble, and young feet when frightened become something\nmore than nimble, and the boys were first over the fence and plunging\nwildly through a maze of back yards. They soon found that the policemen\nwere discreet. Evidently they had had experiences in slips, and they were\nsatisfied to give over the chase at the first fence.\n\nNo street-lamps shed their light here, and the boys blundered along\nthrough the blackness with their hearts in their mouths. In one yard,\nfilled with mountains of crates and fruit-boxes, they were lost for a\nquarter of an hour. Feel and quest about as they would, they encountered\nnothing but endless heaps of boxes. From this wilderness they finally\nemerged by way of a shed roof, only to fall into another yard, cumbered\nwith countless empty chicken-coops.\n\nFarther on they came upon the contrivance which had soaked Brick Simpson's\npursuers with water. It was a cunning arrangement. Where the slip led\nthrough a fence with a board missing, a long slat was so arranged that\nthe ignorant wayfarer could not fail to strike against it. This slat\nwas the spring of the trap. A light touch upon it was sufficient to\ndisconnect a heavy stone from a barrel perched overhead and nicely\nbalanced. The disconnecting of the stone permitted the barrel to turn\nover and spill its contents on the one beneath who touched the slat.\n\nThe boys examined the arrangement with keen appreciation. Luckily for\nthem, the barrel was overturned, or they too would have received a\nducking, for Joe, who was in advance, had blundered against the slat.\n\n\"I wonder if this is Simpson's back yard?\" he queried softly.\n\n\"It must be,\" Fred concluded, \"or else the back yard of some member\nof his gang.\"\n\nCharley put his hands warningly on both their arms.\n\n\"Hist! What 's that?\" he whispered.\n\nThey crouched down on the ground. Not far away was the sound of some\none moving about. Then they heard a noise of falling water, as from\na faucet into a bucket. This was followed by steps boldly approaching.\nThey crouched lower, breathless with apprehension.\n\nA dark form passed by within arm's reach and mounted on a box to the\nfence. It was Brick himself, resetting the trap. They heard him arrange\nthe slat and stone, then right the barrel and empty into it a couple of\nbuckets of water. As he came down from the box to go after more water,\nJoe sprang upon him, tripped him up, and held him to the ground.\n\n\"Don't make any noise,\" he said. \"I want you to listen to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it 's you, is it?\" Simpson replied, with such obvious relief in\nhis voice as to make them feel relieved also. \"Wot d' ye want here?\"\n\n\"We want to get out of here,\" Joe said, \"and the shortest way 's the\nbest. There 's three of us, and you 're only one--\"\n\n\"That 's all right, that 's all right,\" the gang-leader interrupted.\n\"I 'd just as soon show you the way out as not. I ain't got nothin'\n'gainst you. Come on an' follow me, an' don't step to the side, an'\nI 'll have you out in no time.\"\n\nSeveral minutes later they dropped from the top of a high fence into\na dark alley.\n\n\"Follow this to the street,\" Simpson directed; \"turn to the right two\nblocks, turn to the right again for three, an' yer on Union. Tra-la-loo.\"\n\nThey said good-by, and as they started down the alley received the\nfollowing advice:\n\n\"Nex' time you bring kites along, you 'd best leave 'em to home.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nHOME AGAIN\n\n\nFollowing Brick Simpson's directions, they came into Union Street, and\nwithout further mishap gained the Hill. From the brow they looked down\ninto the Pit, whence arose that steady, indefinable hum which comes\nfrom crowded human places.\n\n\"I 'll never go down there again, not as long as I live,\" Fred said\nwith a great deal of savagery in his voice. \"I wonder what became of\nthe fireman.\"\n\n\"We 're lucky to get back with whole skins,\" Joe cheered them\nphilosophically.\n\n\"I guess we left our share, and you more than yours,\" laughed Charley.\n\n\"Yes,\" Joe answered. \"And I 've got more trouble to face when I get\nhome. Good night, fellows.\"\n\nAs he expected, the door on the side porch was locked, and he went\naround to the dining-room and entered like a burglar through a window.\nAs he crossed the wide hall, walking softly toward the stairs, his\nfather came out of the library. The surprise was mutual, and each\nhalted aghast.\n\nJoe felt a hysterical desire to laugh, for he thought that he knew\nprecisely how he looked. In reality he looked far worse than he\nimagined. What Mr. Bronson saw was a boy with hat and coat covered\nwith dirt, his whole face smeared with the stains of conflict, and,\nin particular, a badly swollen nose, a bruised eyebrow, a cut and\nswollen lip, a scratched cheek, knuckles still bleeding, and a shirt\ntorn open from throat to waist.\n\n\"What does this mean, sir?\" Mr. Bronson finally managed to articulate.\n\nJoe stood speechless. How could he tell, in one brief sentence, all\nthe whole night's happenings?--for all that must be included in the\nexplanation of what his luckless disarray meant.\n\n\"Have you lost your tongue?\" Mr. Bronson demanded with an appearance\nof impatience.\n\n\"I 've--I 've--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" his father encouraged.\n\n\"I 've--well, I 've been down in the Pit,\" Joe succeeded in blurting out.\n\n\"I must confess that you look like it--very much like it indeed.\"\nMr. Bronson spoke severely, but if ever by great effort he conquered\na smile, that was the time. \"I presume,\" he went on, \"that you do not\nrefer to the abiding-place of sinners, but rather to some definite\nlocality in San Francisco. Am I right?\"\n\nJoe swept his arm in a descending gesture toward Union Street, and said:\n\"Down there, sir.\"\n\n\"And who gave it that name?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Joe answered, as though confessing to a specified crime.\n\n\"It 's most appropriate, I 'm sure, and denotes imagination. It could n't\nreally be bettered. You must do well at school, sir, with your English.\"\n\nThis did not increase Joe's happiness, for English was the only study of\nwhich he did not have to feel ashamed.\n\nAnd, while he stood thus a silent picture of misery and disgrace,\nMr. Bronson looked upon him through the eyes of his own boyhood with\nan understanding which Joe could not have believed possible.\n\n\"However, what you need just now is not a discourse, but a bath and\ncourt-plaster and witch-hazel and cold-water bandages,\" Mr. Bronson\nsaid; \"so to bed with you. You 'll need all the sleep you can get,\nand you 'll feel stiff and sore to-morrow morning, I promise you.\"\n\nThe clock struck one as Joe pulled the bedclothes around him; and the\nnext he knew he was being worried by a soft, insistent rapping, which\nseemed to continue through several centuries, until at last, unable to\nendure it longer, he opened his eyes and sat up.\n\nThe day was streaming in through the window--bright and sunshiny day.\nHe stretched his arms to yawn; but a shooting pain darted through all\nthe muscles, and his arms came down more rapidly than they had gone up.\nHe looked at them with a bewildered stare, till suddenly the events of\nthe night rushed in upon him, and he groaned.\n\nThe rapping still persisted, and he cried: \"Yes, I hear. What time is it?\"\n\n\"Eight o'clock,\" Bessie's voice came to him through the door. \"Eight\no'clock, and you 'll have to hurry if you don't want to be late for\nschool.\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" He sprang out of bed precipitately, groaned with the pain\nfrom all his stiff muscles, and collapsed slowly and carefully on a\nchair. \"Why did n't you call me sooner?\" he growled.\n\n\"Father said to let you sleep.\"\n\nJoe groaned again, in another fashion Then his history-book caught his\neye, and he groaned yet again and in still another fashion.\n\n\"All right,\" he called. \"Go on. I 'll be down in a jiffy.\"\n\nHe did come down in fairly brief order; but if Bessie had watched him\ndescend the stairs she would have been astounded at the remarkable\ncaution he observed and at the twinges of pain that every now and then\ncontorted his face. As it was, when she came upon him in the dining-room\nshe uttered a frightened cry and ran over to him.\n\n\"What 's the matter, Joe?\" she asked tremulously. \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he grunted, putting sugar on his porridge.\n\n\"But surely--\" she began.\n\n\"Please don't bother me,\" he interrupted. \"I 'm late, and I want to\neat my breakfast.\"\n\nAnd just then Mrs. Bronson caught Bessie's eye, and that young lady,\nstill mystified, made haste to withdraw herself.\n\nJoe was thankful to his mother for that, and thankful that she refrained\nfrom remarking upon his appearance. Father had told her; that was one\nthing sure. He could trust her not to worry him; it was never her way.\n\nAnd, meditating in this way, he hurried through with his solitary\nbreakfast, vaguely conscious in an uncomfortable way that his mother\nwas fluttering anxiously about him. Tender as she always was, he noticed\nthat she kissed him with unusual tenderness as he started out with his\nbooks swinging at the end of a strap; and he also noticed, as he turned\nthe corner, that she was still looking after him through the window.\n\nBut of more vital importance than that, to him, was his stiffness and\nsoreness. As he walked along, each step was an effort and a torment.\nSeverely as the reflected sunlight from the cement sidewalk hurt his\nbruised eye, and severely as his various wounds pained him, still more\nseverely did he suffer from his muscles and joints. He had never imagined\nsuch stiffness. Each individual muscle in his whole body protested when\ncalled upon to move. His fingers were badly swollen, and it was agony to\nclasp and unclasp them; while his arms were sore from wrist to elbow.\nThis, he said to himself, was caused by the many blows which he had\nwarded off from his face and body. He wondered if Brick Simpson was in\nsimilar plight, and the thought of their mutual misery made him feel a\ncertain kinship for that redoubtable young ruffian.\n\nWhen he entered the school-yard he quickly became aware that he was\nthe center of attraction for all eyes. The boys crowded around in an\nawe-stricken way, and even his classmates and those with whom he was\nwell acquainted looked at him with a certain respect he had never\nseen before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nEXAMINATION DAY\n\n\nIt was plain that Fred and Charley had spread the news of their descent\ninto the Pit, and of their battle with the Simpson clan and the Fishes.\nHe heard the nine-o'clock bell with feelings of relief, and passed into\nthe school, a mark for admiring glances from all the boys. The girls,\ntoo, looked at him in a timid and fearful way--as they might have looked\nat Daniel when he came out of the lions' den, Joe thought, or at David\nafter his battle with Goliath. It made him uncomfortable and painfully\nself-conscious, this hero-worshiping, and he wished heartily that they\nwould look in some other direction for a change.\n\nSoon they did look in another direction. While big sheets of foolscap\nwere being distributed to every desk, Miss Wilson, the teacher (an\naustere-looking young woman who went through the world as though it\nwere a refrigerator, and who, even on the warmest days in the classroom,\nwas to be found with a shawl or cape about her shoulders), arose, and\non the blackboard where all could see wrote the Roman numeral \"I.\" Every\neye, and there were fifty pairs of them, hung with expectancy upon her\nhand, and in the pause that followed the room was quiet as the grave.\n\nUnderneath the Roman numeral \"I\" she wrote: \"_(a) What were the laws\nof Draco? (b) Why did an Athenian orator say that they were written\n'not in ink, but in blood'?_\"\n\nForty-nine heads bent down and forty-nine pens scratched lustily across\nas many sheets of foolscap. Joe's head alone remained up, and he regarded\nthe blackboard with so blank a stare that Miss Wilson, glancing over her\nshoulder after having written \"II,\" stopped to look at him. Then she\nwrote:\n\n\"_(a) How did the war between Athens and Megara, respecting the island\nof Salamis, bring about the reforms of Solon? (b) In what way did they\ndiffer from the laws of Draco?_\"\n\nShe turned to look at Joe again. He was staring as blankly as ever.\n\n\"What is the matter, Joe?\" she asked. \"Have you no paper?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, thank you,\" he answered, and began moodily to sharpen\na lead-pencil.\n\nHe made a fine point to it. Then he made a very fine point. Then, and\nwith infinite patience, he proceeded to make it very much finer. Several\nof his classmates raised their heads inquiringly at the noise. But he\ndid not notice. He was too absorbed in his pencil-sharpening and in\nthinking thoughts far away from both pencil-sharpening and Greek history.\n\n\"Of course you all understand that the examination papers are to be\nwritten with ink.\"\n\nMiss Wilson addressed the class in general, but her eyes rested on Joe.\n\nJust as it was about as fine as it could possibly be the point broke,\nand Joe began over again.\n\n\"I am afraid, Joe, that you annoy the class,\" Miss Wilson said in final\ndesperation.\n\nHe put the pencil down, closed the knife with a snap, and returned to\nhis blank staring at the blackboard. What did he know about Draco? or\nSolon? or the rest of the Greeks? It was a flunk, and that was all there\nwas to it. No need for him to look at the rest of the questions, and even\nif he did know the answers to two or three, there was no use in writing\nthem down. It would not prevent the flunk. Besides, his arm hurt him too\nmuch to write. It hurt his eyes to look at the blackboard, and his eyes\nhurt even when they were closed; and it seemed positively to hurt him\nto think.\n\nSo the forty-nine pens scratched on in a race after Miss Wilson, who was\ncovering the blackboard with question after question; and he listened to\nthe scratching, and watched the questions growing under her chalk, and\nwas very miserable indeed. His head seemed whirling around. It ached\ninside and was sore outside, and he did not seem to have any control\nof it at all.\n\nHe was beset with memories of the Pit, like scenes from some monstrous\nnightmare, and, try as he would, he could not dispel them. He would fix\nhis mind and eyes on Miss Wilson's face, who was now sitting at her desk,\nand even as he looked at her the face of Brick Simpson, impudent and\npugnacious, would arise before him. It was of no use. He felt sick and\nsore and tired and worthless. There was nothing to be done but flunk.\nAnd when, after an age of waiting, the papers were collected, his went\nin a blank, save for his name, the name of the examination, and the date,\nwhich were written across the top.\n\nAfter a brief interval, more papers were given out, and the examination\nin arithmetic began. He did not trouble himself to look at the questions.\nOrdinarily he might have pulled through such an examination, but in his\npresent state of mind and body he knew it was impossible. He contented\nhimself with burying his face in his hands and hoping for the noon hour.\nOnce, lifting his eyes to the clock, he caught Bessie looking anxiously at\nhim across the room from the girls' side. This but added to his discomfort.\nWhy was she bothering him? No need for her to trouble. She was bound to\npass. Then why could n't she leave him alone? So he gave her a particularly\nglowering look and buried his face in his hands again. Nor did he lift it\ntill the twelve-o'clock gong rang, when he handed in a second blank paper\nand passed out with the boys.\n\nFred and Charley and he usually ate lunch in a corner of the yard which\nthey had arrogated to themselves; but this day, by some remarkable\ncoincidence, a score of other boys had elected to eat their lunches on\nthe same spot. Joe surveyed them with disgust. In his present condition\nhe did not feel inclined to receive hero-worship. His head ached too\nmuch, and he was troubled over his failure in the examinations; and\nthere were more to come in the afternoon.\n\nHe was angry with Fred and Charley. They were chattering like magpies\nover the adventures of the night (in which, however, they did not fail\nto give him chief credit), and they conducted themselves in quite a\npatronizing fashion toward their awed and admiring schoolmates. But\nevery attempt to make Joe talk was a failure. He grunted and gave short\nanswers, and said \"yes\" and \"no\" to questions asked with the intention\nof drawing him out.\n\nHe was longing to get away somewhere by himself, to throw himself down\nsome place on the green grass and forget his aches and pains and troubles.\nHe got up to go and find such a place, and found half a dozen of his\nfollowing tagging after him. He wanted to turn around and scream at them\nto leave him alone, but his pride restrained him. A great wave of disgust\nand despair swept over him, and then an idea flashed through his mind.\nSince he was sure to flunk in his examinations, why endure the afternoon's\ntorture, which could not but be worse than the morning's? And on the\nimpulse of the moment he made up his mind.\n\nHe walked straight on to the schoolyard gate and passed out. Here his\nworshipers halted in wonderment, but he kept on to the corner and out of\nsight. For some time he wandered along aimlessly, till he came to the\ntracks of a cable road. A down-town car happening to stop to let off\npassengers, he stepped aboard and ensconced himself in an outside corner\nseat. The next thing he was aware of, the car was swinging around on its\nturn-table and he was hastily scrambling off. The big ferry building stood\nbefore him. Seeing and hearing nothing, he had been carried through the\nheart of the business section of San Francisco.\n\nHe glanced up at the tower clock on top of the ferry building. It was\nten minutes after one--time enough to catch the quarter-past-one boat.\nThat decided him, and without the least idea in the world as to where he\nwas going, he paid ten cents for a ticket, passed through the gate, and\nwas soon speeding across the bay to the pretty city of Oakland.\n\nIn the same aimless and unwitting fashion, he found himself, an hour\nlater, sitting on the string-piece of the Oakland city wharf and leaning\nhis aching head against a friendly timber. From where he sat he could\nlook down upon the decks of a number of small sailing-craft. Quite a\ncrowd of curious idlers had collected to look at them, and Joe found\nhimself growing interested.\n\nThere were four boats, and from where he sat he could make out their\nnames. The one directly beneath him had the name _Ghost_ painted in large\ngreen letters on its stern. The other three, which lay beyond, were called\nrespectively _La Caprice_, the _Oyster Queen_, and the _Flying Dutchman_.\n\nEach of these boats had cabins built amidships, with short stovepipes\nprojecting through the roofs, and from the pipe of the _Ghost_ smoke\nwas ascending. The cabin doors were open and the roof-slide pulled\nback, so that Joe could look inside and observe the inmate, a young\nfellow of nineteen or twenty who was engaged just then in cooking. He\nwas clad in long sea-boots which reached the hips, blue overalls, and\ndark woolen shirt. The sleeves, rolled back to the elbows, disclosed\nsturdy, sun-bronzed arms, and when the young fellow looked up his face\nproved to be equally bronzed and tanned.\n\nThe aroma of coffee arose to Joe's nose, and from a light iron pot came\nthe unmistakable smell of beans nearly done. The cook placed a frying-pan\non the stove, wiped it around with a piece of suet when it had heated,\nand tossed in a thick chunk of beefsteak. While he worked he talked with\na companion on deck, who was busily engaged in filling a bucket overside\nand flinging the salt water over heaps of oysters that lay on the deck.\nThis completed, he covered the oysters with wet sacks, and went into the\ncabin, where a place was set for him on a tiny table, and where the cook\nserved the dinner and joined him in eating it.\n\nAll the romance of Joe's nature stirred at the sight. That was life. They\nwere living, and gaining their living, out in the free open, under the sun\nand sky, with the sea rocking beneath them, and the wind blowing on them,\nor the rain falling on them, as the chance might be. Each day and every\nday he sat in a room, pent up with fifty more of his kind, racking his\nbrains and cramming dry husks of knowledge, while they were doing all\nthis, living glad and careless and happy, rowing boats and sailing, and\ncooking their own food, and certainly meeting with adventures such as one\nonly dreams of in the crowded school-room.\n\nJoe sighed. He felt that he was made for this sort of life and not for\nthe life of a scholar. As a scholar he was undeniably a failure. He had\nflunked in his examinations, while at that very moment, he knew, Bessie\nwas going triumphantly home, her last examination over and done, and with\ncredit. Oh, it was not to be borne! His father was wrong in sending him\nto school. That might be well enough for boys who were inclined to study,\nbut it was manifest that he was not so inclined. There were more careers\nin life than that of the schools. Men had gone down to the sea in the\nlowest capacity, and risen in greatness, and owned great fleets, and done\ngreat deeds, and left their names on the pages of time. And why not he,\nJoe Bronson?\n\nHe closed his eyes and felt immensely sorry for himself; and when he\nopened his eyes again he found that he had been asleep, and that the\nsun was sinking fast.\n\nIt was after dark when he arrived home, and he went straight to his room\nand to bed without meeting any one. He sank down between the cool sheets\nwith a sigh of satisfaction at the thought that, come what would, he need\nno longer worry about his history. Then another and unwelcome thought\nobtruded itself, and he knew that the next school term would come, and\nthat six months thereafter, another examination in the same history\nawaited him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFATHER AND SON\n\n\nOn the following morning, after breakfast, Joe was summoned to the\nlibrary by his father, and he went in almost with a feeling of gladness\nthat the suspense of waiting was over. Mr. Bronson was standing by the\nwindow. A great chattering of sparrows outside seemed to have attracted\nhis attention. Joe joined him in looking out, and saw a fledgeling sparrow\non the grass, tumbling ridiculously about in its efforts to stand on its\nfeeble baby legs. It had fallen from the nest in the rose-bush that climbed\nover the window, and the two parent sparrows were wild with anxiety over\nits plight.\n\n\"It 's a way young birds have,\" Mr. Bronson remarked, turning to Joe\nwith a serious smile; \"and I dare say you are on the verge of a somewhat\nsimilar predicament, my boy,\" he went on. \"I am afraid things have\nreached a crisis, Joe. I have watched it coming on for a year now--your\npoor scholarship, your carelessness and inattention, your constant\ndesire to be out of the house and away in search of adventures of one\nsort or another.\"\n\nHe paused, as though expecting a reply; but Joe remained silent.\n\n\"I have given you plenty of liberty. I believe in liberty. The finest\nsouls grow in such soil. So I have not hedged you in with endless rules\nand irksome restrictions. I have asked little of you, and you have come\nand gone pretty much as you pleased. In a way, I have put you on your\nhonor, made you largely your own master, trusting to your sense of right\nto restrain you from going wrong and at least to keep you up in your\nstudies. And you have failed me. What do you want me to do? Set you\ncertain bounds and time-limits? Keep a watch over you? Compel you by\nmain strength to go through your books?\n\n\"I have here a note,\" Mr. Bronson said after another pause, in which he\npicked up an envelop from the table and drew forth a written sheet.\n\nJoe recognized the stiff and uncompromising scrawl of Miss Wilson, and\nhis heart sank.\n\nHis father began to read:\n\n  \"Listlessness and carelessness have characterized\n  his term's work, so that when the examinations\n  came he was wholly unprepared. In neither history\n  nor arithmetic did he attempt to answer a question,\n  passing in his papers perfectly blank. These\n  examinations took place in the morning. In the\n  afternoon he did not take the trouble even to\n  appear for the remainder.\"\n\nMr. Bronson ceased reading and looked up.\n\n\"Where were you in the afternoon?\" he asked.\n\n\"I went across on the ferry to Oakland,\" Joe answered, not caring to offer\nhis aching head and body in extenuation.\n\n\"That is what is called 'playing hooky,' is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Joe answered.\n\n\"The night before the examinations, instead of studying, you saw fit to\nwander away and involve yourself in a disgraceful fight with hoodlums.\nI did not say anything at the time. In my heart I think I might almost\nhave forgiven you that, if you had done well in your school-work.\"\n\nJoe had nothing to say. He knew that there was his side to the story, but\nhe felt that his father did not understand, and that there was little use\nof telling him.\n\n\"The trouble with you, Joe, is carelessness and lack of concentration.\nWhat you need is what I have not given you, and that is rigid discipline.\nI have been debating for some time upon the advisability of sending you\nto some military school, where your tasks will be set for you, and what\nyou do every moment in the twenty-four hours will be determined for you--\"\n\n\"Oh, father, you don't understand, you can't understand!\" Joe broke forth\nat last. \"I try to study--I honestly try to study; but somehow--I don't\nknow how--I can't study. Perhaps I am a failure. Perhaps I am not made\nfor study. I want to go out into the world. I want to see life--to live.\nI don't want any military academy; I 'd sooner go to sea--anywhere where\nI can do something and be something.\"\n\nMr. Bronson looked at him kindly. \"It is only through study that you can\nhope to do something and be something in the world,\" he said.\n\nJoe threw up his hand with a gesture of despair.\n\n\"I know how you feel about it,\" Mr. Bronson went on; \"but you are only a\nboy, very much like that young sparrow we were watching. If at home you\nhave not sufficient control over yourself to study, then away from home,\nout in the world which you think is calling to you, you will likewise\nnot have sufficient control over yourself to do the work of that world.\n\n\"But I am willing, Joe, I am willing, after you have finished high school\nand before you go into the university, to let you out into the world for\na time.\"\n\n\"Let me go now?\" Joe asked impulsively.\n\n\"No; it is too early. You have n't your wings yet. You are too unformed,\nand your ideals and standards are not yet thoroughly fixed.\"\n\n\"But I shall not be able to study,\" Joe threatened. \"I know I shall not\nbe able to study.\"\n\nMr. Bronson consulted his watch and arose to go. \"I have not made up my\nmind yet,\" he said. \"I do not know what I shall do--whether I shall give\nyou another trial at the public school or send you to a military academy.\"\n\nHe stopped a moment at the door and looked back. \"But remember this, Joe,\"\nhe said. \"I am not angry with you; I am more grieved and hurt. Think it\nover, and tell me this evening what you intend to do.\"\n\nHis father passed out, and Joe heard the front door close after him. He\nleaned back in the big easy-chair and closed his eyes. A military school!\nHe feared such an institution as the animal fears a trap. No, he would\ncertainly never go to such a place. And as for public school--He sighed\ndeeply at the thought of it. He was given till evening to make up his\nmind as to what he intended to do. Well, he knew what he would do, and\nhe did not have to wait till evening to find it out.\n\nHe got up with a determined look on his face, put on his hat, and went\nout the front door. He would show his father that he could do his share\nof the world's work, he thought as he walked along--he would show him.\n\nBy the time he reached the school he had his whole plan worked out\ndefinitely. Nothing remained but to put it through. It was the noon\nhour, and he passed in to his room and packed up his books unnoticed.\nComing out through the yard, he encountered Fred and Charley.\n\n\"What 's up?\" Charley asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Joe grunted.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\"\n\n\"Taking my books home, of course. What did you suppose I was doing?\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" Fred interposed. \"Don't be so mysterious. I don't see why\nyou can't tell us what has happened.\"\n\n\"You 'll find out soon enough,\" Joe said significantly--more significantly\nthan he had intended.\n\nAnd, for fear that he might say more, he turned his back on his astonished\nchums and hurried away. He went straight home and to his room, where he\nbusied himself at once with putting everything in order. His clothes\nhe hung carefully away, changing the suit he had on for an older one.\nFrom his bureau he selected a couple of changes of underclothing, a\ncouple of cotton shirts, and half a dozen pairs of socks. To these he\nadded as many handkerchiefs, a comb, and a tooth-brush.\n\nWhen he had bound the bundle in stout wrapping-paper he contemplated it\nwith satisfaction. Then he went over to his desk and took from a small\ninner compartment his savings for some months, which amounted to several\ndollars. This sum he had been keeping for the Fourth of July, but he thrust\nit into his pocket with hardly a regret. Then he pulled a writing-pad over\nto him, sat down and wrote:\n\n  Don't look for me. I am a failure and I am\n  going away to sea. Don't worry about me. I\n  am all right and able to take care of myself.\n  I shall come back some day, and then you will\n  all be proud of me. Good-by, papa, and mama,\n  and Bessie.\n                                        JOE.\n\nThis he left lying on his desk where it could easily be seen. He tucked\nthe bundle under his arm, and, with a last farewell look at the room,\nstole out.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n'FRISCO KID AND THE NEW BOY\n\n\n'Frisco Kid was discontented--discontented and disgusted. This would have\nseemed impossible to the boys who fished from the dock above and envied\nhim greatly. True, they wore cleaner and better clothes, and were blessed\nwith fathers and mothers; but his was the free floating life of the bay,\nthe domain of moving adventure, and the companionship of men--theirs the\nrigid discipline and dreary sameness of home life. They did not dream that\n'Frisco Kid ever looked up at them from the cockpit of the _Dazzler_\nand in turn envied them just those things which sometimes were the most\ndistasteful to them and from which they suffered to repletion. Just as the\nromance of adventure sang its siren song in their ears and whispered vague\nmessages of strange lands and lusty deeds, so the delicious mysteries of\nhome enticed 'Frisco Kid's roving fancies, and his brightest day-dreams\nwere of the thing's he knew not--brothers, sisters, a father's counsel,\na mother's kiss.\n\nHe frowned, got up from where he had been sunning himself on top of\nthe _Dazzler's_ cabin, and kicked off his heavy rubber boots. Then\nhe stretched himself on the narrow side-deck and dangled his feet in\nthe cool salt water.\n\n\"Now that 's freedom,\" thought the boys who watched him. Besides, those\nlong sea-boots, reaching to the hips and buckled to the leather strap\nabout the waist, held a strange and wonderful fascination for them. They\ndid not know that 'Frisco Kid did not possess such things as shoes--that\nthe boots were an old pair of Pete Le Maire's and were three sizes too\nlarge for him. Nor could they guess how uncomfortable they were to wear\non a hot summer day.\n\nThe cause of 'Frisco Kid's discontent was those very boys who sat on\nthe string-piece and admired him; but his disgust was the result of\nquite another event. The _Dazzler_ was short one in its crew, and he\nhad to do more work than was justly his share. He did not mind the\ncooking, nor the washing down of the decks and the pumping; but when\nit came to the paint-scrubbing and dishwashing he rebelled. He felt\nthat he had earned the right to be exempt from such scullion work.\nThat was all the green boys were fit for, while he could make or take\nin sail, lift anchor, steer, and make landings.\n\n\"Stan' from un'er!\" Pete Le Maire or \"French Pete,\" captain of the\n_Dazzler_ and lord and master of 'Frisco Kid, threw a bundle into the\ncockpit and came aboard by the starboard rigging.\n\n\"Come! Queeck!\" he shouted to the boy who owned the bundle and who now\nhesitated on the dock. It was a good fifteen feet to the deck of the\nsloop, and he could not reach the steel stay by which he must descend.\n\n\"Now! One, two, three!\" the Frenchman counted good-naturedly, after the\nmanner of captains when their crews are short-handed.\n\nThe boy swung his body into space and gripped the rigging. A moment later\nhe struck the deck, his hands tingling warmly from the friction.\n\n\"Kid, dis is ze new sailor. I make your acquaintance.\" French Pete\nsmirked and bowed, and stood aside. \"Mistaire Sho Bronson,\" he added\nas an afterthought.\n\nThe two boys regarded each other silently for a moment. They were evidently\nabout the same age, though the stranger looked the heartier and stronger\nof the two. 'Frisco Kid put out his hand, and they shook.\n\n\"So you 're thinking of tackling the water, eh?\" he said.\n\nJoe Bronson nodded and glanced curiously about him before answering:\n\"Yes; I think the bay life will suit me for a while, and then, when I 've\ngot used to it, I 'm going to sea in the forecastle.\"\n\n\"In the what?\"\n\n\"In the forecastle--the place where the sailors live,\" he explained,\nflushing and feeling doubtful of his pronunciation.\n\n\"Oh, the fo'c'sle. Know anything about going to sea?\"\n\n\"Yes--no; that is, except what I 've read.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid whistled, turned on his heel in a lordly manner, and went\ninto the cabin.\n\n\"Going to sea,\" he chuckled to himself as he built the fire and set about\ncooking supper; \"in the 'forecastle,' too; and thinks he 'll like it.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile French Pete was showing the newcomer about the sloop\nas though he were a guest. Such affability and charm did he display\nthat 'Frisco Kid, popping his head up through the scuttle to call them\nto supper, nearly choked in his effort to suppress a grin.\n\nJoe Bronson enjoyed that supper. The food was rough but good, and the\nsmack of the salt air and the sea-fittings around him gave zest to his\nappetite. The cabin was clean and snug, and, though not large, the\naccommodations surprised him. Every bit of space was utilized. The table\nswung to the centerboard-case on hinges, so that when not in use it\nactually occupied no room at all. On either side and partly under the\ndeck were two bunks. The blankets were rolled back, and the boys sat on\nthe well-scrubbed bunk boards while they ate. A swinging sea-lamp of\nbrightly polished brass gave them light, which in the daytime could be\nobtained through the four deadeyes, or small round panes of heavy glass\nwhich were fitted into the walls of the cabin. On one side of the door\nwas the stove and wood-box, on the other the cupboard. The front end\nof the cabin was ornamented with a couple of rifles and a shot-gun,\nwhile exposed by the rolled-back blankets of French Pete's bunk was a\ncartridge-lined belt carrying a brace of revolvers.\n\nIt all seemed like a dream to Joe. Countless times he had imagined scenes\nsomewhat similar to this; but here he was right in the midst of it, and\nalready it seemed as though he had known his two companions for years.\nFrench Pete was smiling genially at him across the board. It really was a\nvillainous countenance, but to Joe it seemed only weather-beaten. 'Frisco\nKid was describing to him, between mouthfuls, the last sou'easter the\n_Dazzler_ had weathered, and Joe experienced an increasing awe for this\nboy who had lived so long upon the water and knew so much about it.\n\nThe captain, however, drank a glass of wine, and topped it off with a\nsecond and a third, and then, a vicious flush lighting his swarthy face,\nstretched out on top of his blankets, where he soon was snoring loudly.\n\n\"Better turn in and get a couple of hours' sleep,\" 'Frisco Kid said\nkindly, pointing Joe's bunk out to him. \"We 'll most likely be up the\nrest of the night.\"\n\nJoe obeyed, but he could not fall asleep so readily as the others. He\nlay with his eyes wide open, watching the hands of the alarm-clock that\nhung in the cabin, and thinking how quickly event had followed event in\nthe last twelve hours. Only that very morning he had been a school-boy,\nand now he was a sailor, shipped on the _Dazzler_ and bound he knew not\nwhither. His fifteen years increased to twenty at the thought of it, and\nhe felt every inch a man--a sailorman at that. He wished Charley and\nFred could see him now. Well, they would hear of it soon enough. He could\nsee them talking it over, and the other boys crowding around. \"Who?\" \"Oh,\nJoe Bronson; he 's gone to sea. Used to chum with us.\"\n\nJoe pictured the scene proudly. Then he softened at the thought of his\nmother worrying, but hardened again at the recollection of his father.\nNot that his father was not good and kind; but he did not understand boys,\nJoe thought. That was where the trouble lay. Only that morning he had\nsaid that the world was n't a play-ground, and that the boys who thought\nit was were liable to make sore mistakes and be glad to get home again.\nWell, _he_ knew that there was plenty of hard work and rough experience\nin the world; but _he_ also thought boys had some rights. He 'd show him\nhe could take care of himself; and, anyway, he could write home after he\ngot settled down to his new life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nABOARD THE DAZZLER\n\n\nA skiff grazed the side of the _Dazzler_ softly and interrupted Joe's\nreveries. He wondered why he had not heard the sound of the oars in\nthe rowlocks. Then two men jumped over the cockpit-rail and came into\nthe cabin.\n\n\"Bli' me, if 'ere they ain't snoozin',\" said the first of the newcomers,\ndeftly rolling 'Frisco Kid out of his blankets with one hand and reaching\nfor the wine-bottle with the other.\n\nFrench Pete put his head up on the other side of the centerboard, his eyes\nheavy with sleep, and made them welcome.\n\n\"'Oo 's this?\" asked the Cockney, as he was called, smacking his lips over\nthe wine and rolling Joe out upon the floor. \"Passenger?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" French Pete made haste to answer. \"Ze new sailorman. Vaire\ngood boy.\"\n\n\"Good boy or not, he 's got to keep his tongue atween his teeth,\" growled\nthe second newcomer, who had not yet spoken, glaring fiercely at Joe.\n\n\"I say,\" queried the other man, \"'ow does 'e whack up on the loot? I 'ope\nas me and Bill 'ave a square deal.\"\n\n\"Ze _Dazzler_ she take one share--what you call--one third; den we split\nze rest in five shares. Five men, five shares. Vaire good.\"\n\nFrench Pete insisted in excited gibberish that the _Dazzler_ had the\nright to have three men in its crew, and appealed to 'Frisco Kid to\nbear him out. But the latter left them to fight it over by themselves,\nand proceeded to make hot coffee.\n\nIt was all Greek to Joe, except he knew that he was in some way the cause\nof the quarrel. In the end French Pete had his way, and the newcomers gave\nin after much grumbling. After they had drunk their coffee, all hands went\non deck.\n\n\"Just stay in the cockpit and keep out of their way,\" 'Frisco Kid whispered\nto Joe. \"I 'll teach you about the ropes and everything when we ain't in a\nhurry.\"\n\nJoe's heart went out to him in sudden gratitude, for the strange feeling\ncame to him that of those on board, to 'Frisco Kid, and to 'Frisco Kid\nonly, could he look for help in time of need. Already a dislike for\nFrench Pete was growing up within him. Why, he could not say; he just\nsimply felt it.\n\nA creaking of blocks for'ard, and the huge mainsail loomed above him\nin the night. Bill cast off the bowline, the Cockney followed suit with\nthe stern, 'Frisco Kid gave her the jib as French Pete jammed up the\ntiller, and the _Dazzler_ caught the breeze, heeling over for mid-channel.\nJoe heard talk of not putting up the side-lights, and of keeping a sharp\nlookout, though all he could comprehend was that some law of navigation\nwas being violated.\n\nThe water-front lights of Oakland began to slip past. Soon the stretches\nof docks and the shadowy ships began to be broken by dim sweeps of\nmarshland, and Joe knew that they were heading out for San Francisco Bay.\nThe wind was blowing from the north in mild squalls, and the _Dazzler_ cut\nnoiselessly through the landlocked water.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Joe asked the Cockney, in an endeavor to be friendly\nand at the same time satisfy his curiosity.\n\n\"Oh, my pardner 'ere, Bill, we 're goin' to take a cargo from 'is factory,\"\nthat worthy airily replied.\n\nJoe thought he was rather a funny-looking individual to own a factory;\nbut, conscious that even stranger things might be found in this new\nworld he was entering, he said nothing. He had already exposed himself\nto 'Frisco Kid in the matter of his pronunciation of \"fo'c'sle,\" and\nhe had no desire further to advertise his ignorance.\n\nA little after that he was sent in to blow out the cabin lamp. The\n_Dazzler_ tacked about and began to work in toward the north shore.\nEverybody kept silent, save for occasional whispered questions and\nanswers which passed between Bill and the captain. Finally the sloop\nwas run into the wind, and the jib and mainsail lowered cautiously.\n\n\"Short hawse,\" French Pete whispered to 'Frisco Kid, who went for'ard\nand dropped the anchor, paying out the slightest quantity of slack.\n\nThe _Dazzler's_ skiff was brought alongside, as was also the small boat\nin which the two strangers had come aboard.\n\n\"See that that cub don't make a fuss,\" Bill commanded in an undertone,\nas he joined his partner in his own boat.\n\n\"Can you row?\" 'Frisco Kid asked as they got into the other boat.\n\nJoe nodded his head.\n\n\"Then take these oars, and don't make a racket.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid took the second pair, while French Pete steered. Joe noticed\nthat the oars were muffled with sennit, and that even the rowlock sockets\nwere protected with leather. It was impossible to make a noise except by\na mis-stroke, and Joe had learned to row on Lake Merrit well enough to\navoid that. They followed in the wake of the first boat, and, glancing\naside, he saw they were running along the length of a pier which jutted\nout from the land. A couple of ships, with riding-lanterns burning\nbrightly, were moored to it, but they kept just beyond the edge of the\nlight. He stopped rowing at the whispered command of 'Frisco Kid. Then\nthe boats grounded like ghosts on a tiny beach, and they clambered out.\n\nJoe followed the men, who picked their way carefully up a twenty-foot\nbank. At the top he found himself on a narrow railway track which ran\nbetween huge piles of rusty scrap-iron. These piles, separated by tracks,\nextended in every direction he could not tell how far, though in the\ndistance he could see the vague outlines of some great factory-like\nbuilding. The men began to carry loads of the iron down to the beach,\nand French Pete, gripping him by the arm and again warning him not to\nmake any noise, told him to do likewise. At the beach they turned their\nburdens over to 'Frisco Kid, who loaded them, first in the one skiff and\nthen in the other. As the boats settled under the weight, he kept pushing\nthem farther and farther out, in order that they should keep clear of\nthe bottom.\n\nJoe worked away steadily, though he could not help marveling at the\nqueerness of the whole business. Why should there be such a mystery\nabout it? and why such care taken to maintain silence? He had just\nbegun to ask himself these questions, and a horrible suspicion was\nforming itself in his mind, when he heard the hoot of an owl from the\ndirection of the beach. Wondering at an owl being in so unlikely a\nplace, he stooped to gather a fresh load of iron. But suddenly a man\nsprang out of the gloom, flashing a dark lantern full upon him. Blinded\nby the light, he staggered back. Then a revolver in the man's hand went\noff like the roar of a cannon. All Joe realized was that he was being\nshot at, while his legs manifested an overwhelming desire to get away.\nEven if he had so wished, he could not very well have stayed to explain\nto the excited man with the smoking revolver. So he took to his heels\nfor the beach, colliding with another man with a dark lantern who came\nrunning around the end of one of the piles of iron. This second man\nquickly regained his feet, and peppered away at Joe as he flew down\nthe bank.\n\nHe dashed out into the water for the boat. French Pete at the bow-oars and\n'Frisco Kid at the stroke had the skiff's nose pointed seaward and were\ncalmly awaiting his arrival. They had their oars ready for the start, but\nthey held them quietly at rest, for all that both men on the bank had begun\nto fire at them. The other skiff lay closer inshore, partially aground.\nBill was trying to shove it off, and was calling on the Cockney to lend a\nhand; but that gentleman had lost his head completely, and came floundering\nthrough the water hard after Joe. No sooner had Joe climbed in over the\nstern than he followed him. This extra weight on the stern of the heavily\nloaded craft nearly swamped them. As it was, a dangerous quantity of water\nwas shipped. In the meantime the men on the bank had reloaded their pistols\nand opened fire again, this time with better aim. The alarm had spread.\nVoices and cries could be heard from the ships on the pier, along which\nmen were running. In the distance a police whistle was being frantically\nblown.\n\n\"Get out!\" 'Frisco Kid shouted. \"You ain't a-going to sink us if I know\nit. Go and help your pardner.\"\n\nBut the Cockney's teeth were chattering with fright, and he was too\nunnerved to move or speak.\n\n\"T'row ze crazy man out!\" French Pete ordered from the bow. At this moment\na bullet shattered an oar in his hand, and he coolly proceeded to ship a\nspare one.\n\n\"Give us a hand, Joe,\" 'Frisco Kid commanded.\n\nJoe understood, and together they seized the terror-stricken creature\nand flung him overboard. Two or three bullets splashed about him as he\ncame to the surface, just in time to be picked up by Bill, who had at\nlast succeeded in getting clear.\n\n\"Now!\" French Pete called, and a few strokes into the darkness quickly\ntook them out of the zone of fire.\n\nSo much water had been shipped that the light skiff was in danger of\nsinking at any moment. While the other two rowed, and by the Frenchman's\norders, Joe began to throw out the iron. This saved them for the time\nbeing. But just as they swept alongside the _Dazzler_ the skiff lurched,\nshoved a side under, and turned turtle, sending the remainder of the iron\nto bottom. Joe and 'Frisco Kid came up side by side, and together they\nclambered aboard with the skiff's painter in tow. French Pete had already\narrived, and now helped them out.\n\nBy the time they had canted the water out of the swamped boat, Bill and\nhis partner appeared on the scene. All hands worked rapidly, and, almost\nbefore Joe could realize, the mainsail and jib had been hoisted, the\nanchor broken out, and the _Dazzler_ was leaping down the channel. Off\na bleak piece of marshland Bill and the Cockney said good-by and cast\nloose in their skiff. French Pete, in the cabin, bewailed their bad luck\nin various languages, and sought consolation in the wine-bottle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWITH THE BAY PIRATES\n\n\nThe wind freshened as they got clear of the land, and soon the _Dazzler_\nwas heeling it with her lee deck buried and the water churning by,\nhalf-way up the cockpit-rail. Side-lights had been hung out. 'Frisco\nKid was steering, and by his side sat Joe, pondering over the events\nof the night.\n\nHe could no longer blind himself to the facts. His mind was in a whirl\nof apprehension. If he had done wrong, he reasoned, he had done it\nthrough ignorance; and he did not feel shame for the past so much as\nhe did fear for the future. His companions were thieves and robbers--the\nbay pirates, of whose wild deeds he had heard vague tales. And here he\nwas, right in the midst of them, already possessing information which\ncould send them to State's prison. This very fact, he knew, would force\nthem to keep a sharp watch upon him and so lessen his chances of escape.\nBut escape he would, at the very first opportunity.\n\nAt this point his thoughts were interrupted by a sharp squall, which\nhurled the _Dazzler_ over till the sea rushed inboard. 'Frisco Kid\nluffed quickly, at the same time slacking off the main-sheet. Then,\nsingle-handed,--for French Pete remained below,--and with Joe looking\nidly on, he proceeded to reef down.\n\nThe squall which had so nearly capsized the _Dazzler_ was of short\nduration, but it marked the rising of the wind, and soon puff after\npuff was shrieking down upon them out of the north. The mainsail was\nspilling the wind, and slapping and thrashing about till it seemed it\nwould tear itself to pieces. The sloop was rolling wildly in the quick\nsea which had come up. Everything was in confusion; but even Joe's\nuntrained eye showed him that it was an orderly confusion. He could\nsee that 'Frisco Kid knew just what to do and just how to do it. As\nhe watched him he learned a lesson, the lack of which has made failures\nof the lives of many men--_the value of knowledge of one's own capacities_.\n'Frisco Kid knew what he was able to do, and because of this he had\nconfidence in himself. He was cool and self-possessed, working hurriedly\nbut not carelessly. There was no bungling. Every reef-point was drawn\ndown to stay. Other accidents might occur, but the next squall, or the\nnext forty squalls, would not carry one of those reef-knots away.\n\nHe called Joe for'ard to help stretch the mainsail by means of swinging\non the peak and throat-halyards. To lay out on the long bowsprit and put\na single reef in the jib was a slight task compared with what had been\nalready accomplished; so a few moments later they were again in the\ncockpit. Under the other lad's directions, Joe flattened down the\njib-sheet, and, going into the cabin, let down a foot or so of centerboard.\nThe excitement of the struggle had chased all unpleasant thoughts from\nhis mind. Patterning after the other boy, he had retained his coolness.\nHe had executed his orders without fumbling, and at the same time without\nundue slowness. Together they had exerted their puny strength in the face\nof violent nature, and together they had outwitted her.\n\nHe came back to where his companion stood at the tiller steering, and he\nfelt proud of him and of himself; and when he read the unspoken praise\nin 'Frisco Kid's eyes he blushed like a girl at her first compliment. But\nthe next instant the thought flashed across him that this boy was a thief,\na common thief; and he instinctively recoiled. His whole life had been\nsheltered from the harsher things of the world. His reading, which had\nbeen of the best, had laid a premium upon honesty and uprightness, and he\nhad learned to look with abhorrence upon the criminal classes. So he drew\na little away from 'Frisco Kid and remained silent. But 'Frisco Kid,\ndevoting all his energies to the handling of the sloop, had no time in\nwhich to remark this sudden change of feeling on the part of his companion.\n\nBut there was one thing Joe found in himself that surprised him. While the\nthought of 'Frisco Kid being a thief was repulsive to him, 'Frisco Kid\nhimself was not. Instead of feeling an honest desire to shun him, he felt\ndrawn toward him. He could not help liking him, though he knew not why.\nHad he been a little older he would have understood that it was the lad's\ngood qualities which appealed to him--his coolness and self-reliance, his\nmanliness and bravery, and a certain kindliness and sympathy in his nature.\nAs it was, he thought it his own natural badness which prevented him from\ndisliking 'Frisco Kid; but, while he felt shame at his own weakness, he\ncould not smother the warm regard which he felt growing up for this\nparticular bay pirate.\n\n\"Take in two or three feet on the skiff's painter,\" commanded 'Frisco Kid,\nwho had an eye for everything.\n\nThe skiff was towing with too long a painter, and was behaving very badly.\nEvery once in a while it would hold back till the tow-rope tautened, then\ncome leaping ahead and sheering and dropping slack till it threatened to\nshove its nose under the huge whitecaps which roared so hungrily on every\nhand. Joe climbed over the cockpit-rail to the slippery after-deck, and\nmade his way to the bitt to which the skiff was fastened.\n\n\"Be careful,\" 'Frisco Kid warned, as a heavy puff struck the _Dazzler_\nand careened her dangerously over on her side. \"Keep one turn round the\nbitt, and heave in on it when the painter slacks.\"\n\nIt was ticklish work for a greenhorn. Joe threw off all the turns save\nthe last, which he held with one hand, while with the other he attempted\nto bring in on the painter. But at that instant it tightened with a\ntremendous jerk, the boat sheering sharply into the crest of a heavy\nsea. The rope slipped from his hands and began to fly out over the stern.\nHe clutched it frantically, and was dragged after it over the sloping deck.\n\n\"Let her go! Let her go!\" 'Frisco Kid shouted.\n\nJoe let go just as he was on the verge of going overboard, and the skiff\ndropped rapidly astern. He glanced in a shamefaced way at his companion,\nexpecting to be sharply reprimanded for his awkwardness. But 'Frisco Kid\nsmiled good-naturedly.\n\n\"That 's all right,\" he said. \"No bones broke and nobody overboard.\nBetter to lose a boat than a man any day; that 's what I say. Besides,\nI should n't have sent you out there. And there 's no harm done. We can\npick it up all right. Go in and drop some more centerboard,--a couple of\nfeet,--and then come out and do what I tell you. But don't be in a hurry.\nTake it easy and sure.\"\n\nJoe dropped the centerboard and returned, to be stationed at the jib-sheet.\n\n\"Hard a-lee!\" 'Frisco Kid cried, throwing the tiller down, and following\nit with his body. \"Cast off! That 's right. Now lend a hand on the\nmain-sheet!\"\n\nTogether, hand over hand, they came in on the reefed mainsail. Joe began\nto warm up with the work. The _Dazzler_ turned on her heel like a\nrace-horse, and swept into the wind, her canvas snarling and her sheets\nslatting like hail.\n\n\"Draw down the jib-sheet!\"\n\nJoe obeyed, and, the head-sail filling, forced her off on the other tack.\nThis manoeuver had turned French Pete's bunk from the lee to the weather\nside, and rolled him out on the cabin floor, where he lay in a drunken\nstupor.\n\n'Frisco Kid, with his back against the tiller and holding the sloop off\nthat it might cover their previous course, looked at him with an expression\nof disgust, and muttered: \"The dog! We could well go to the bottom, for\nall he 'd care or do!\"\n\nTwice they tacked, trying to go over the same ground; and then Joe\ndiscovered the skiff bobbing to windward in the star-lit darkness.\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" 'Frisco Kid cautioned, shooting the _Dazzler_ into the\nwind toward it and gradually losing headway. \"Now!\"\n\nJoe leaned over the side, grasped the trailing painter, and made it fast\nto the bitt. Then they tacked ship again and started on their way. Joe\nstill felt ashamed for the trouble he had caused; but 'Frisco Kid quickly\nput him at ease.\n\n\"Oh, that 's nothing,\" he said. \"Everybody does that when they 're\nbeginning. Now some men forget all about the trouble they had in\nlearning, and get mad when a greeny makes a mistake. I never do. Why,\nI remember--\"\n\nAnd then he told Joe of many of the mishaps which fell to him when, as\na little lad, he first went on the water, and of some of the severe\npunishments for the same which were measured out to him. He had passed\nthe running end of a lanyard over the tiller-neck, and as they talked\nthey sat side by side and close against each other in the shelter of\nthe cockpit.\n\n\"What place is that?\" Joe asked, as they flew by a lighthouse blinking\nfrom a rocky headland.\n\n\"Goat Island. They 've got a naval training station for boys over on\nthe other side, and a torpedo-magazine. There 's jolly good fishing,\ntoo--rock-cod. We 'll pass to the lee of it, and make across, and\nanchor in the shelter of Angel Island. There 's a quarantine station\nthere. Then when French Pete gets sober we 'll know where he wants to\ngo. You can turn in now and get some sleep. I can manage all right.\"\n\nJoe shook his head. There had been too much excitement for him to feel\nin the least like sleeping. He could not bear to think of it with the\n_Dazzler_ leaping and surging along and shattering the seas into clouds\nof spray on her weather bow. His clothes had half dried already, and he\npreferred to stay on deck and enjoy it.\n\nThe lights of Oakland had dwindled till they made only a hazy flare\nagainst the sky; but to the south the San Francisco lights, topping\nhills and sinking into valleys, stretched miles upon miles. Starting\nfrom the great ferry building, and passing on to Telegraph Hill, Joe\nwas soon able to locate the principal places of the city. Somewhere\nover in that maze of light and shadow was the home of his father, and\nperhaps even now they were thinking and worrying about him; and over\nthere Bessie was sleeping cozily, to wake up in the morning and wonder\nwhy her brother Joe did not come down to breakfast. Joe shivered. It\nwas almost morning. Then slowly his head dropped over on 'Frisco Kid's\nshoulder and he was fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCAPTAIN AND CREW\n\n\n\"Come! Wake up! We 're going into anchor.\"\n\nJoe roused with a start, bewildered at the unusual scene; for sleep had\nbanished his troubles for the time being, and he knew not where he was.\nThen he remembered. The wind had dropped with the night. Beyond, the\nheavy after-sea was still rolling; but the _Dazzler_ was creeping up in\nthe shelter of a rocky island. The sky was clear, and the air had the\nsnap and vigor of early morning about it. The rippling water was laughing\nin the rays of the sun just shouldering above the eastern sky-line. To\nthe south lay Alcatraz Island, and from its gun-crowned heights a flourish\nof trumpets saluted the day. In the west the Golden Gate yawned between\nthe Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. A full-rigged ship, with her\nlightest canvas, even to the sky-sails, set, was coming slowly in on the\nflood-tide.\n\nIt was a pretty sight. Joe rubbed the sleep from his eyes and drank in\nthe glory of it till 'Frisco Kid told him to go for'ard and make ready\nfor dropping the anchor.\n\n\"Overhaul about fifty fathoms of chain,\" he ordered, \"and then stand by.\"\nHe eased the sloop gently into the wind, at the same time casting off\nthe jib-sheet. \"Let go the jib-halyards and come in on the downhaul!\"\n\nJoe had seen the manoeuver performed the previous night, and so was able\nto carry it out with fair success.\n\n\"Now! Over with the mud-hook! Watch out for turns! Lively, now!\"\n\nThe chain flew out with startling rapidity and brought the _Dazzler_\nto rest. 'Frisco Kid went for'ard to help, and together they lowered\nthe mainsail, furled it in shipshape manner and made all fast with the\ngaskets, and put the crutches under the main-boom.\n\n\"Here 's a bucket,\" said 'Frisco Kid, as he passed him the article in\nquestion. \"Wash down the decks, and don't be afraid of the water, nor\nof the dirt either. Here 's a broom. Give it what for, and have everything\nshining. When you get that done bail out the skiff. She opened her seams\na little last night. I 'm going below to cook breakfast.\"\n\nThe water was soon slushing merrily over the deck, while the smoke pouring\nfrom the cabin stove carried a promise of good things to come. Time and\nagain Joe lifted his head from his task to take in the scene. It was one\nto appeal to any healthy boy, and he was no exception. The romance of it\nstirred him strangely, and his happiness would have been complete could\nhe have escaped remembering who and what his companions were. The thought\nof this, and of French Pete in his bleary sleep below, marred the beauty\nof the day. He had been unused to such things and was shocked at the harsh\nreality of life. But instead of hurting him, as it might a lad of weaker\nnature, it had the opposite effect. It strengthened his desire to be clean\nand strong, and to not be ashamed of himself in his own eyes. He glanced\nabout him and sighed. Why could not men be honest and true? It seemed too\nbad that he must go away and leave all this; but the events of the night\nwere strong upon him, and he knew that in order to be true to himself\nhe must escape.\n\nAt this juncture he was called to breakfast. He discovered that 'Frisco\nKid was as good a cook as he was a sailor, and made haste to do justice\nto the fare. There were mush and condensed milk, beefsteak and fried\npotatoes, and all topped off with good French bread, butter, and coffee.\nFrench Pete did not join them, though 'Frisco Kid attempted a couple of\ntimes to rouse him. He mumbled and grunted, half opened his bleared eyes,\nthen fell to snoring again.\n\n\"Can't tell when he 's going to get those spells,\" 'Frisco Kid explained,\nwhen Joe, having finished washing dishes, came on deck. \"Sometimes he\nwon't get that way for a month, and others he won't be decent for a\nweek at a stretch. Sometimes he 's good-natured, and sometimes he 's\ndangerous; so the best thing to do is to let him alone and keep out of\nhis way; and don't cross him, for if you do there 's liable to be trouble.\n\n\"Come on; let 's take a swim,\" he added, abruptly changing the subject\nto one more agreeable. \"Can you swim?\"\n\nJoe nodded.\n\n\"What 's that place?\" he asked, as he poised before diving, pointing toward\na sheltered beach on the island where there were several buildings and a\nlarge number of tents.\n\n\"Quarantine station. Lots of smallpox coming in now on the China steamers,\nand they make them go there till the doctors say they 're safe to land. I\ntell you, they 're strict about it, too. Why--\"\n\nSplash! Had 'Frisco Kid finished his sentence just then, instead of diving\noverboard, much trouble might have been saved to Joe. But he did not finish\nit, and Joe dived after him.\n\n\"I 'll tell you what,\" 'Frisco Kid suggested half an hour later, while they\nclung to the bobstay preparatory to climbing out. \"Let 's catch a mess of\nfish for dinner, and then turn in and make up for the sleep we lost last\nnight. What d' you say?\"\n\nThey made a race to clamber aboard, but Joe was shoved over the side again.\nWhen he finally did arrive, the other lad had brought to light a pair of\nheavily leaded, large-hooked lines and a mackerel-keg of salt sardines.\n\n\"Bait,\" he said. \"Just shove a whole one on. They 're not a bit partic'lar.\nSwallow the bait, hook and all, and go--that 's their caper. The fellow\nthat does n't catch the first fish has to clean 'em.\"\n\nBoth sinkers started on their long descent together, and seventy feet of\nline whizzed out before they came to rest. But at the instant his sinker\ntouched the bottom Joe felt the struggling jerks of a hooked fish. As\nhe began to haul in he glanced at 'Frisco Kid and saw that he too had\nevidently captured a finny prize. The race between them was exciting.\nHand over hand the wet lines flashed inboard. But 'Frisco Kid was more\nexpert, and his fish tumbled into the cockpit first. Joe's followed an\ninstant later--a three-pound rock-cod. He was wild with joy. It was\nmagnificent--the largest fish he had ever landed or ever seen landed.\nOver went the lines again, and up they came with two mates of the ones\nalready captured. It was sport royal. Joe would certainly have continued\ntill he had fished the bay empty, had not 'Frisco Kid persuaded him\nto stop.\n\n\"We 've got enough for three meals now,\" he said, \"so there 's no use in\nhaving them spoil. Besides, the more you catch the more you clean, and\nyou 'd better start in right away. I 'm going to bed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nJOE TRIES TO TAKE FRENCH LEAVE\n\n\nJoe did not mind. In fact, he was glad he had not caught the first fish,\nfor it helped out a little plan which had come to him while swimming. He\nthrew the last cleaned fish into a bucket of water and glanced about him.\nThe quarantine station was a bare half-mile away, and he could make out\na soldier pacing up and down at sentry duty on the beach. Going into the\ncabin, he listened to the heavy breathing of the sleepers. He had to pass\nso close to 'Frisco Kid to get his bundle of clothes that he decided not\nto take it. Returning outside, he carefully pulled the skiff alongside,\ngot aboard with a pair of oars, and cast off.\n\nAt first he rowed very gently in the direction of the station, fearing\nthe chance of noise if he made undue haste. But gradually he increased\nthe strength of his strokes till he had settled down to the regular\nstride. When he had covered half the distance he glanced about. Escape\nwas sure now, for he knew, even if he were discovered, that it would be\nimpossible for the _Dazzler_ to get under way and head him off before he\nmade the land and the protection of that man who wore the uniform of\nUncle Sam's soldiers.\n\nThe report of a gun came to him from the shore, but his back was in that\ndirection and he did not bother to turn around. A second report followed,\nand a bullet cut the water within a couple of feet of his oar-blade. This\ntime he did turn around. The soldier on the beach was leveling his rifle\nat him for a third shot.\n\nJoe was in a predicament, and a very tantalizing one at that. A few\nminutes of hard rowing would bring him to the beach and to safety; but\non that beach, for some unaccountable reason, stood a United States\nsoldier who persisted in firing at him. When Joe saw the gun aimed at\nhim for the third time, he backed water hastily. As a result, the skiff\ncame to a standstill, and the soldier, lowering his rifle, regarded\nhim intently.\n\n\"I want to come ashore! Important!\" Joe shouted out to him.\n\nThe man in uniform shook his head.\n\n\"But it 's important, I tell you! Won't you let me come ashore?\"\n\nHe took a hurried look in the direction of the _Dazzler_. The shots had\nevidently awakened French Pete, for the mainsail had been hoisted, and\nas he looked he saw the anchor broken out and the jib flung to the breeze.\n\n\"Can't land here!\" the soldier shouted back. \"Smallpox!\"\n\n\"But I must!\" he cried, choking down a half-sob and preparing to row.\n\n\"Then I 'll shoot you,\" was the cheering response, and the rifle came to\nshoulder again.\n\nJoe thought rapidly. The island was large. Perhaps there were no soldiers\nfarther on, and if he only once got ashore he did not care how quickly\nthey captured him. He might catch the smallpox, but even that was better\nthan going back to the bay pirates. He whirled the skiff half about to\nthe right, and threw all his strength against the oars. The cove was quite\nwide, and the nearest point which he must go around a good distance away.\nHad he been more of a sailor, he would have gone in the other direction\nfor the opposite point, and thus had the wind on his pursuers. As it was,\nthe _Dazzler_ had a beam wind in which to overtake him.\n\nIt was nip and tuck for a while. The breeze was light and not very steady,\nso sometimes he gained and sometimes they. Once it freshened till the sloop\nwas within a hundred yards of him, and then it dropped suddenly flat, the\n_Dazzler's_ big mainsail flapping idly from side to side.\n\n\"Ah! you steal ze skiff, eh?\" French Pete howled at him, running into the\ncabin for his rifle. \"I fix you! You come back queeck, or I kill you!\" But\nhe knew the soldier was watching them from the shore, and did not dare to\nfire, even over the lad's head.\n\nJoe did not think of this, for he, who had never been shot at in all his\nprevious life, had been under fire twice in the last twenty-four hours.\nOnce more or less could n't amount to much. So he pulled steadily away,\nwhile French Pete raved like a wild man, threatening him with all manner\nof punishments once he laid hands upon him again. To complicate matters,\n'Frisco Kid waxed mutinous.\n\n\"Just you shoot him, and I 'll see you hung for it--see if I don't,\" he\nthreatened. \"You 'd better let him go. He 's a good boy and all right,\nand not raised for the dirty life you and I are leading.\"\n\n\"You too, eh!\" the Frenchman shrieked, beside himself with rage. \"Den I\nfix you, you rat!\"\n\nHe made a rush for the boy, but 'Frisco Kid led him a lively chase from\ncockpit to bowsprit and back again. A sharp capful of wind arriving just\nthen, French Pete abandoned the one chase for the other. Springing to the\ntiller and slacking away on the main-sheet,--for the wind favored,--he\nheaded the sloop down upon Joe. The latter made one tremendous spurt,\nthen gave up in despair and hauled in his oars. French Pete let go the\nmain-sheet, lost steerageway as he rounded up alongside the motionless\nskiff, and dragged Joe out.\n\n\"Keep mum,\" 'Frisco Kid whispered to him while the irate Frenchman was\nbusy fastening the painter. \"Don't talk back. Let him say all he wants\nto, and keep quiet. It 'll be better for you.\"\n\nBut Joe's Anglo-Saxon blood was up, and he did not heed.\n\n\"Look here, Mr. French Pete, or whatever your name is,\" he commenced; \"I\ngive you to understand that I want to quit, and that I 'm going to quit.\nSo you 'd better put me ashore at once. If you don't I 'll put you in\nprison, or my name 's not Joe Bronson.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid waited the outcome fearfully. French Pete was aghast. He was\nbeing defied aboard his own vessel--and by a boy! Never had such a thing\nbeen heard of. He knew he was committing an unlawful act in detaining him,\nbut at the same time he was afraid to let him go with the information he\nhad gathered concerning the sloop and its occupation. The boy had spoken\nthe unpleasant truth when he said he could send him to prison. The only\nthing for him to do was to bully him.\n\n\"You will, eh?\" His shrill voice rose wrathfully. \"Den you come too. You\nrow ze boat last-a night--answer me dat! You steal ze iron--answer me\ndat! You run away--answer me dat! And den you say you put me in jail? Bah!\"\n\n\"But I did n't know,\" Joe protested.\n\n\"Ha, ha! Dat is funny. You tell dat to ze judge; mebbe him laugh, eh?\"\n\n\"I say I did n't,\" he reiterated manfully. \"I did n't know I 'd shipped\nalong with a lot of thieves.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid winced at this epithet, and had Joe been looking at him he\nwould have seen a red flush mount to his face.\n\n\"And now that I do know,\" he continued, \"I wish to be put ashore. I don't\nknow anything about the law, but I do know something of right and wrong;\nand I 'm willing to take my chance with any judge for whatever wrong I\nhave done--with all the judges in the United States, for that matter.\nAnd that 's more than you can say, Mr. Pete.\"\n\n\"You say dat, eh? Vaire good. But you are one big t'ief--\"\n\n\"I 'm not--don't you dare call me that again!\" Joe's face was pale, and he\nwas trembling--but not with fear.\n\n\"T'ief!\" the Frenchman taunted back.\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\nJoe had not been a boy among boys for nothing. He knew the penalty which\nattached itself to the words he had just spoken, and he expected to receive\nit. So he was not overmuch surprised when he picked himself up from the\nfloor of the cockpit an instant later, his head still ringing from a stiff\nblow between the eyes.\n\n\"Say dat one time more,\" French Pete bullied, his fist raised and prepared\nto strike.\n\nTears of anger stood in Joe's eyes, but he was calm and in deadly earnest.\n\"When you say I am a thief, Pete, you lie. You can kill me, but still I\nwill say you lie.\"\n\n\"No, you don't!\" 'Frisco Kid had darted in like a cat, preventing a second\nblow, and shoving the Frenchman back across the cockpit.\n\n\"You leave the boy alone!\" he continued, suddenly unshipping and arming\nhimself with the heavy iron tiller, and standing between them. \"This thing\n's gone just about as far as it 's going to go. You big fool, can't you\nsee the stuff the boy 's made of? He speaks true. He 's right, and he\nknows it, and you could kill him and he would n't give in. There 's my\nhand on it, Joe.\" He turned and extended his hand to Joe, who returned\nthe grip. \"You 've got spunk and you 're not afraid to show it.\"\n\nFrench Pete's mouth twisted itself in a sickly smile, but the evil gleam\nin his eyes gave it the lie. He shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Ah! So?\nHe does not dee-sire dat I call him pet names. Ha, ha! It is only ze\nsailorman play. Let us--what you call--forgive and forget, eh? Vaire good;\nforgive and forget.\"\n\nHe reached out his hand, but Joe refused to take it. 'Frisco Kid nodded\napproval, while French Pete, still shrugging his shoulders and smiling,\npassed into the cabin.\n\n\"Slack off ze main-sheet,\" he called out, \"and run down for Hunter's Point.\nFor one time I will cook ze dinner, and den you will say dat it is ze\nvaire good dinner. Ah! French Pete is ze great cook!\"\n\n\"That 's the way he always does--gets real good and cooks when he wants\nto make up,\" 'Frisco Kid hazarded, slipping the tiller into the rudder-head\nand obeying the order. \"But even then you can't trust him.\"\n\nJoe nodded his head, but did not speak. He was in no mood for conversation.\nHe was still trembling from the excitement of the last few moments, while\ndeep down he questioned himself on how he had behaved, and found nothing\nto be ashamed of.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nBEFRIENDING EACH OTHER\n\n\nThe afternoon sea-breeze had sprung up and was now rioting in from the\nPacific. Angel Island was fast dropping astern, and the water-front of\nSan Francisco showing up, as the _Dazzler_ plowed along before it. Soon\nthey were in the midst of the shipping, passing in and out among the\nvessels which had come from the ends of the earth. Later they crossed\nthe fairway, where the ferry steamers, crowded with passengers, passed to\nand fro between San Francisco and Oakland. One came so close that the\npassengers crowded to the side to see the gallant little sloop and the two\nboys in the cockpit. Joe gazed enviously at the row of down-turned faces.\nThey were all going to their homes, while he--he was going he knew not\nwhither, at the will of French Pete. He was half tempted to cry out for\nhelp; but the foolishness of such an act struck him, and he held his\ntongue. Turning his head, his eyes wandered along the smoky heights of\nthe city, and he fell to musing on the strange way of men and ships on\nthe sea.\n\n'Frisco Kid watched him from the corner of his eye, following his thoughts\nas accurately as though he spoke them aloud.\n\n\"Got a home over there somewheres?\" he queried suddenly, waving his hand\nin the direction of the city.\n\nJoe started, so correctly had his thought been guessed. \"Yes,\" he said\nsimply.\n\n\"Tell us about it.\"\n\nJoe rapidly described his home, though forced to go into greater detail\nbecause of the curious questions of his companion. 'Frisco Kid was\ninterested in everything, especially in Mrs. Bronson and Bessie. Of the\nlatter he could not seem to tire, and poured forth question after question\nconcerning her. So peculiar and artless were some of them that Joe could\nhardly forbear to smile.\n\n\"Now tell me about yours,\" he said when he at last had finished.\n\n'Frisco Kid seemed suddenly to harden, and his face took on a stern look\nwhich the other had never seen there before. He swung his foot idly to\nand fro, and lifted a dull eye aloft to the main-peak blocks, with which,\nby the way, there was nothing the matter.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" the other encouraged.\n\n\"I have n't no home.\"\n\nThe four words left his mouth as though they had been forcibly ejected,\nand his lips came together after them almost with a snap.\n\nJoe saw he had touched a tender spot, and strove to ease the way out of\nit again. \"Then the home you did have.\" He did not dream that there were\nlads in the world who never had known homes, or that he had only succeeded\nin probing deeper.\n\n\"Never had none.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" His interest was aroused, and he now threw solicitude to the winds.\n\"Any sisters?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Mother?\"\n\n\"I was so young when she died that I don't remember her.\"\n\n\"Father?\"\n\n\"I never saw much of him. He went to sea--anyhow, he disappeared.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Joe did not know what to say, and an oppressive silence, broken only\nby the churn of the _Dazzler's_ forefoot, fell upon them.\n\nJust then Pete came out to relieve at the tiller while they went in to eat.\nBoth lads hailed his advent with feelings of relief, and the awkwardness\nvanished over the dinner, which was all their skipper had claimed it to be.\nAfterward 'Frisco Kid relieved Pete, and while he was eating Joe washed up\nthe dishes and put the cabin shipshape. Then they all gathered in the\nstern, where the captain strove to increase the general cordiality by\nentertaining them with descriptions of life among the pearl-divers of\nthe South Seas.\n\nIn this fashion the afternoon wore away. They had long since left San\nFrancisco behind, rounded Hunter's Point, and were now skirting the\nSan Mateo shore. Joe caught a glimpse, once, of a party of cyclists\nrounding a cliff on the San Bruno Road, and remembered the time when\nhe had gone over the same ground on his own wheel. It was only a month\nor two before, but it seemed an age to him now, so much had there been\nto come between.\n\nBy the time supper had been eaten and the things cleared away, they were\nwell down the bay, off the marshes behind which Redwood City clustered.\nThe wind had gone down with the sun, and the _Dazzler_ was making but\nlittle headway, when they sighted a sloop bearing down upon them on the\ndying wind. 'Frisco Kid instantly named it as the _Reindeer_, to which\nFrench Pete, after a deep scrutiny, agreed. He seemed very much pleased\nat the meeting.\n\n\"Red Nelson runs her,\" 'Frisco Kid informed Joe. \"And he 's a terror and\nno mistake. I 'm always afraid of him when he comes near. They 've got\nsomething big down here, and they 're always after French Pete to tackle\nit with them. He knows more about it, whatever it is.\"\n\nJoe nodded, and looked at the approaching craft curiously. Though somewhat\nlarger, it was built on about the same lines as the _Dazzler_ which meant,\nabove everything else, that it was built for speed. The mainsail was so\nlarge that it was more like that of a racing-yacht, and it carried the\npoints for no less than three reefs in case of rough weather. Aloft and\non deck everything was in place--nothing was untidy or useless. From\nrunning-gear to standing rigging, everything bore evidence of thorough\norder and smart seamanship.\n\nThe _Reindeer_ came up slowly in the gathering twilight and went to anchor\na biscuit-toss away. French Pete followed suit with the _Dazzler_, and then\nwent in the skiff to pay them a visit. The two lads stretched themselves\nout on top the cabin and awaited his return.\n\n\"Do you like the life?\" Joe broke silence.\n\nThe other turned on his elbow. \"Well--I do, and then again I don't. The\nfresh air, and the salt water, and all that, and the freedom--that 's all\nright; but I don't like the--the--\" He paused a moment, as though his\ntongue had failed in its duty, and then blurted out: \"the stealing.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you quit it?\" Joe liked the lad more than he dared confess\nto himself, and he felt a sudden missionary zeal come upon him.\n\n\"I will just as soon as I can turn my hand to something else.\"\n\n\"But why not now?\"\n\n_Now is the accepted time_ was ringing in Joe's ears, and if the other\nwished to leave, it seemed a pity that he did not, and at once.\n\n\"Where can I go? What can I do? There 's nobody in all the world to lend\nme a hand, just as there never has been. I tried it once, and learned my\nlesson too well to do it again in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Well, when I get out of this I 'm going home. Guess my father was right,\nafter all. And I don't see, maybe--what 's the matter with you going with\nme?\" He said this last without thinking, impulsively, and 'Frisco Kid\nknew it.\n\n\"You don't know what you 're talking about,\" he answered. \"Fancy me going\noff with you! What 'd your father say? and--and the rest? How would he\nthink of me? And what 'd he do?\"\n\nJoe felt sick at heart. He realized that in the spirit of the moment\nhe had given an invitation which, on sober thought, he knew would be\nimpossible to carry out. He tried to imagine his father receiving in\nhis own house a stranger like 'Frisco Kid--no, that was not to be\nthought of. Then, forgetting his own plight, he fell to racking his\nbrains for some other method by which 'Frisco Kid could get away from\nhis present surroundings.\n\n\"He might turn me over to the police,\" the other went on, \"and send me to\na refuge. I 'd die first, before I 'd let that happen to me. And besides,\nJoe, I 'm not of your kind, and you know it. Why, I 'd be like a fish out\nof water, what with all the things I did n't know. Nope; I guess I 'll\nhave to wait a little before I strike out. But there 's only one thing\nfor you to do, and that 's to go straight home. First chance I get I 'll\nland you, and then I 'll deal with French Pete--\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" Joe interrupted hotly. \"When I leave I 'm not going to\nleave you in trouble on my account. So don't you try anything like that.\nI 'll get away, never fear, and if I can figure it out I want you to\ncome along too; come along anyway, and figure it out afterward. What d'\nyou say?\"\n\n'Frisco Kid shook his head, and, gazing up at the starlit heavens,\nwandered off into dreams of the life he would like to lead but from\nwhich he seemed inexorably shut out. The seriousness of life was\nstriking deeper than ever into Joe's heart, and he lay silent,\nthinking hard. A mumble of heavy voices came to them from the\n_Reindeer_; and from the land the solemn notes of a church bell\nfloated across the water, while the summer night wrapped them\nslowly in its warm darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAMONG THE OYSTER-BEDS\n\n\nTime and the world slipped away, and both boys were aroused by the harsh\nvoice of French Pete from the sleep into which they had fallen.\n\n\"Get under way!\" he was bawling. \"Here, you Sho! Cast off ze gaskets!\nQueeck! Lively! You Kid, ze jib!\"\n\nJoe was clumsy in the darkness, not knowing the names of things and the\nplaces where they were to be found; but he made fair progress, and when\nhe had tossed the gaskets into the cockpit was ordered forward to help\nhoist the mainsail. After that the anchor was hove in and the jib set.\nThen they coiled down the halyards and put everything in order before\nthey returned aft.\n\n\"Vaire good, vaire good,\" the Frenchman praised, as Joe dropped in over\nthe rail. \"Splendeed! You make ze good sailorman, I know for sure.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid lifted the cover of one of the cockpit lockers and glanced\nquestioningly at French Pete.\n\n\"For sure,\" that mariner replied. \"Put up ze side-lights.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid took the red and green lanterns into the cabin to light them,\nand then went forward with Joe to hang them in the rigging.\n\n\"They 're not goin' to tackle it,\" 'Frisco Kid said in an undertone.\n\n\"What?\" Joe asked.\n\n\"That big thing I was tellin' you was down here somewhere. It 's so big,\nI guess, that French Pete 's 'most afraid to go in for it. Red Nelson 'd\ngo in quicker 'n a wink, but he don't know enough about it. Can't go in,\nyou see, till Pete gives the word.\"\n\n\"Where are we going now?\" Joe questioned.\n\n\"Don't know; oyster-beds most likely, from the way we 're heading.\"\n\nIt was an uneventful trip. A breeze sprang up out of the night behind them,\nand held steady for an hour or more. Then it dropped and became aimless and\nerratic, puffing gently first from one quarter and then another. French\nPete remained at the tiller, while occasionally Joe or 'Frisco Kid took\nin or slacked off a sheet.\n\nJoe sat and marveled that the Frenchman should know where he was going.\nTo Joe it seemed that they were lost in the impenetrable darkness which\nshrouded them. A high fog had rolled in from the Pacific, and though they\nwere beneath, it came between them and the stars, depriving them of the\nlittle light from that source.\n\nBut French Pete seemed to know instinctively the direction he should go,\nand once, in reply to a query from Joe, bragged of his ability to go by\nthe \"feel\" of things.\n\n\"I feel ze tide, ze wind, ze speed,\" he explained. \"Even do I feel ze land.\nDat I tell you for sure. How? I do not know. Only do I know dat I feel ze\nland, just like my arm grow long, miles and miles long, and I put my hand\nupon ze land and feel it, and know dat it is there.\"\n\nJoe looked incredulously at 'Frisco Kid.\n\n\"That 's right,\" he affirmed. \"After you 've been on the water a good\nwhile you come to feel the land. And if your nose is any account, you\ncan usually smell it.\"\n\nAn hour or so later, Joe surmised from the Frenchman's actions that they\nwere approaching their destination. He seemed on the alert, and was\nconstantly peering into the darkness ahead as though he expected to see\nsomething at any moment. Joe looked very hard, but saw only the darkness.\n\n\"Try ze stick, Kid,\" French Pete ordered. \"I t'ink it is about ze time.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid unlashed a long and slender pole from the top of the cabin,\nand, standing on the narrow deck amidships, plunged one end of it into\nthe water and drove it straight down.\n\n\"About fifteen feet,\" he said.\n\n\"What ze bottom?\"\n\n\"Mud,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Wait one while, den we try some more.\"\n\nFive minutes afterward the pole was plunged overside again.\n\n\"Two fathoms,\" Joe answered--\"shells.\"\n\nFrench Pete rubbed his hands with satisfaction. \"Vaire good, vaire well,\"\nhe said. \"I hit ze ground every time. You can't fool-a ze old man; I tell\nyou dat for sure.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid continued operating the pole and announcing the results, to the\nmystification of Joe, who could not comprehend their intimate knowledge of\nthe bottom of the bay.\n\n\"Ten feet--shells,\" 'Frisco Kid went on in a monotonous voice. \"'Leven\nfeet--shells. Fourteen feet--soft. Sixteen feet--mud. No bottom.\"\n\n\"Ah, ze channel,\" said French Pete at this.\n\nFor a few minutes it was \"No bottom\"; and then, suddenly, came 'Frisco\nKid's cry: \"Eight feet--hard!\"\n\n\"Dat 'll do,\" French Pete commanded. \"Run for'ard, you Sho, an' let go ze\njib. You, Kid, get all ready ze hook.\"\n\nJoe found the jib-halyard and cast it off the pin, and, as the canvas\nfluttered down, came in hand over hand on the downhaul.\n\n\"Let 'er go!\" came the command, and the anchor dropped into the water,\ncarrying but little chain after it.\n\n'Frisco Kid threw over plenty of slack and made fast. Then they furled\nthe sails, made things tidy, and went below and to bed.\n\nIt was six o'clock when Joe awoke and went out into the cockpit to look\nabout. Wind and sea had sprung up, and the _Dazzler_ was rolling and\ntossing and now and again fetching up on her anchor-chain with a savage\njerk. He was forced to hold on to the boom overhead to steady himself.\nIt was a gray and leaden day, with no signs of the rising sun, while the\nsky was obscured by great masses of flying clouds.\n\nJoe sought for the land. A mile and a half away it lay--a long, low\nstretch of sandy beach with a heavy surf thundering upon it. Behind\nappeared desolate marshlands, while far beyond towered the Contra\nCosta Hills.\n\nChanging the direction of his gaze, Joe was startled by the sight of a\nsmall sloop rolling and plunging at her anchor not a hundred yards away.\nShe was nearly to windward, and as she swung off slightly he read her name\non the stern, the _Flying Dutchman_, one of the boats he had seen lying at\nthe city wharf in Oakland. A little to the left of her he discovered the\n_Ghost_, and beyond were half a dozen other sloops at anchor.\n\n\"What I tell you?\"\n\nJoe looked quickly over his shoulder. French Pete had come out of the\ncabin and was triumphantly regarding the spectacle.\n\n\"What I tell you? Can't fool-a ze old man, dat 's what. I hit it in ze\ndark just so well as in ze sunshine. I know--I know.\"\n\n\"Is she goin' to howl?\" 'Frisco Kid asked from the cabin, where he was\nstarting the fire.\n\nThe Frenchman gravely studied sea and sky for a couple of minutes.\n\n\"Mebbe blow over--mebbe blow up,\" was his doubtful verdict. \"Get breakfast\nqueeck, and we try ze dredging.\"\n\nSmoke was rising from the cabins of the different sloops, denoting that\nthey were all bent on getting the first meal of the day. So far as the\n_Dazzler_ was concerned, it was a simple matter, and soon they were\nputting a single reef in the mainsail and getting ready to weigh anchor.\n\nJoe was curious. These were undoubtedly the oyster-beds; but how under the\nsun, in that wild sea, were they to get oysters? He was quickly to learn\nthe way. Lifting a section of the cockpit flooring, French Pete brought\nout two triangular frames of steel. At the apex of one of these triangles;\nin a ring for the purpose, he made fast a piece of stout rope. From this\nthe sides (inch rods) diverged at almost right angles, and extended down\nfor a distance of four feet or more, where they were connected by the\nthird side of the triangle, which was the bottom of the dredge. This was\na flat plate of steel over a yard in length, to which was bolted a row of\nlong, sharp teeth, likewise of steel. Attached to the toothed plate, and\nto the sides of the frame was a net of very coarse fishing-twine, which\nJoe correctly surmised was there to catch the oysters raked loose by the\nteeth from the bottom of the bay.\n\nA rope being made fast to each of the dredges, they were dropped overboard\nfrom either side of the _Dazzler_. When they had reached the bottom, and\nwere dragging with the proper length of line out, they checked her speed\nquite noticeably. Joe touched one of the lines with his hands, and could\nfeel plainly the shock and jar and grind as it tore over the bottom.\n\n\"All in!\" French Pete shouted.\n\nThe boys laid hold of the line and hove in the dredge. The net was full\nof mud and slime and small oysters, with here and there a large one. This\nmess they dumped on the deck and picked over while the dredge was dragging\nagain. The large oysters they threw into the cockpit, and shoveled the\nrubbish overboard. There was no rest, for by this time the other dredge\nrequired emptying. And when this was done and the oysters sorted, both\ndredges had to be hauled aboard, so that French Pete could put the\n_Dazzler_ about on the other tack.\n\nThe rest of the fleet was under way and dredging back in similar fashion.\nSometimes the different sloops came quite close to them, and they hailed\nthem and exchanged snatches of conversation and rough jokes. But in the\nmain it was hard work, and at the end of an hour Joe's back was aching\nfrom the unaccustomed strain, and his fingers were cut and bleeding from\nhis clumsy handling of the sharp-edged oysters.\n\n\"Dat 's right,\" French Pete said approvingly. \"You learn queeck. Vaire\nsoon you know how.\"\n\nJoe grinned ruefully and wished it was dinner-time. Now and then, when\na light dredge was hauled, the boys managed to catch breath and say a\ncouple of words.\n\n\"That 's Asparagus Island,\" 'Frisco Kid said, indicating the shore. \"At\nleast, that 's what the fishermen and scow-sailors call it. The people\nwho live there call it Bay Farm Island.\" He pointed more to the right.\n\"And over there is San Leandro. You can't see it, but it 's there.\"\n\n\"Ever been there?\" Joe asked.\n\n'Frisco Kid nodded his head and signed to him to help heave in the\nstarboard dredge.\n\n\"These are what they call the deserted beds,\" he said again. \"Nobody owns\nthem, so the oyster pirates come down and make a bluff at working them.\"\n\n\"Why a bluff?\"\n\n\"'Cause they 're pirates, that 's why, and because there 's more money in\nraiding the private beds.\"\n\nHe made a sweeping gesture toward the east and southeast. \"The private beds\nare over yonder, and if it don't storm the whole fleet 'll be raidin' 'em\nto-night.\"\n\n\"And if it does storm?\" Joe asked.\n\n\"Why, we won't raid them, and French Pete 'll be mad, that 's all. He\nalways hates being put out by the weather. But it don't look like lettin'\nup, and this is the worst possible shore in a sou'wester. Pete may try\nto hang on, but it 's best to get out before she howls.\"\n\nAt first it did seem as though the weather were growing better. The stiff\nsouthwest wind dropped perceptibly, and by noon, when they went to anchor\nfor dinner, the sun was breaking fitfully through the clouds.\n\n\"That 's all right,\" 'Frisco Kid said prophetically. \"But I ain't been\non the bay for nothing. She 's just gettin' ready to let us have it good\nan' hard.\"\n\n\"I t'ink you 're right, Kid,\" French Pete agreed; \"but ze _Dazzler_ hang\non all ze same. Last-a time she run away, an' fine night come. Dis time\nshe run not away. Eh? Vaire good.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nGOOD SAILORS IN A WILD ANCHORAGE\n\n\nAll afternoon the _Dazzler_ pitched and rolled at her anchorage, and as\nevening drew on the wind deceitfully eased down. This, and the example\nset by French Pete, encouraged the rest of the oyster-boats to attempt\nto ride out the night; but they looked carefully to their moorings and\nput out spare anchors.\n\nFrench Pete ordered the two boys into the skiff, and, at the imminent risk\nof swamping, they carried out a second anchor, at nearly right angles to\nthe first one, and dropped it over. French Pete then ran out a great\nquantity of chain and rope, so that the _Dazzler_ dropped back a hundred\nfeet or more, where she rode more easily.\n\nIt was a wild stretch of water which Joe looked upon from the shelter of\nthe cockpit. The oyster-beds were out in the open bay, utterly unprotected,\nand the wind, sweeping the water for a clean twelve miles, kicked up so\ntremendous a sea that at every moment it seemed as though the wallowing\nsloops would roll their masts overside. Just before twilight a patch of\nsail sprang up to windward, and grew and grew until it resolved itself\ninto the huge mainsail of the _Reindeer_.\n\n\"Ze beeg fool!\" French Pete cried, running out of the cabin to see.\n\"Sometime--ah, sometime, I tell you--he crack on like dat, an' he go,\npouf! just like dat, pouf!--an' no more Nelson, no more _Reindeer_, no\nmore nothing.\"\n\nJoe looked inquiringly at 'Frisco Kid.\n\n\"That 's right,\" he answered. \"Nelson ought to have at least one reef\nin. Two 'd be better. But there he goes, every inch spread, as though\nsome fiend was after 'im. He drives too hard; he 's too reckless, when\nthere ain't the smallest need for it. I 've sailed with him, and I know\nhis ways.\"\n\nLike some huge bird of the air, the _Reindeer_ lifted and soared down\non them on the foaming crest of a wave.\n\n\"Don't mind,\" 'Frisco Kid warned. \"He 's only tryin' to see how close\nhe can come to us without hittin' us.\"\n\nJoe nodded, and stared with wide eyes at the thrilling sight. The\n_Reindeer_ leaped up in the air, pointing her nose to the sky till\nthey could see her whole churning forefoot; then she plunged downward\ntill her for'ard deck was flush with the foam, and with a dizzying rush\nshe drove past them, her main-boom missing the _Dazzler's_ rigging by\nscarcely a foot.\n\nNelson, at the wheel, waved his hand to them as he hurtled past,\nand laughed joyously in French Pete's face, who was angered by the\ndangerous trick.\n\nWhen to leeward, the splendid craft rounded to the wind, rolling once\ntill her brown bottom showed to the centerboard and they thought she\nwas over, then righting and dashing ahead again like a thing possessed.\nShe passed abreast of them on the starboard side. They saw the jib run\ndown with a rush and an anchor go overboard as she shot into the wind;\nand as she fell off and back and off and back with a spilling mainsail,\nthey saw a second anchor go overboard, wide apart from the first. Then\nthe mainsail came down on the run, and was furled and fastened by the\ntime she had tightened to her double hawsers.\n\n\"Ah, ah! Never was there such a man!\"\n\nThe Frenchman's eyes were glistening with admiration for such perfect\nseamanship, and 'Frisco Kid's were likewise moist.\n\n\"Just like a yacht,\" he said as he went back into the cabin. \"Just like\na yacht, only better.\"\n\nAs night came on the wind began to rise again, and by eleven o'clock had\nreached the stage which 'Frisco Kid described as \"howlin'.\" There was\nlittle sleep on the _Dazzler_. He alone closed his eyes. French Pete was\nup and down every few minutes. Twice, when he went on deck, he paid out\nmore chain and rope. Joe lay in his blankets and listened, the while\nvainly courting sleep. He was not frightened, but he was untrained in\nthe art of sleeping in the midst of such turmoil and uproar and violent\ncommotion. Nor had he imagined a boat could play as wild antics as did\nthe _Dazzler_ and still survive. Often she wallowed over on her beam\ntill he thought she would surely capsize. At other times she leaped\nand plunged in the air and fell upon the seas with thunderous crashes\nas though her bottom were shattered to fragments. Again, she would fetch\nup taut on her hawsers so suddenly and so fiercely as to reel from the\nshock and to groan and protest through every timber.\n\n'Frisco Kid awoke once, and smiled at him, saying:\n\n\"This is what they call hangin' on. But just you wait till daylight comes,\nand watch us clawin' off. If some of the sloops don't go ashore, I 'm not\nme, that 's all.\"\n\nAnd thereat he rolled over on his side and was off to sleep. Joe envied\nhim. About three in the morning he heard French Pete crawl up for'ard and\nrummage around in the eyes of the boat. Joe looked on curiously, and by\nthe dim light of the wildly swinging sea-lamp saw him drag out two spare\ncoils of line. These he took up on deck, and Joe knew he was bending them\non to the hawsers to make them still longer.\n\nAt half-past four French Pete had the fire going, and at five he called\nthe boys for coffee. This over, they crept into the cockpit to gaze on the\nterrible scene. The dawn was breaking bleak and gray over a wild waste of\ntumbling water. They could faintly see the beach-line of Asparagus Island,\nbut they could distinctly hear the thunder of the surf upon it; and as the\nday grew stronger they made out that they had dragged fully half a mile\nduring the night.\n\nThe rest of the fleet had likewise dragged. The _Reindeer_ was almost\nabreast of them; _La Caprice_ lay a few hundred yards away; and to\nleeward, straggling between them and shore, were five more of the\nstruggling oyster-boats.\n\n\"Two missing,\" 'Frisco Kid announced, putting the glasses to his eyes\nand searching the beach.\n\n\"And there 's one!\" he cried. And after studying it carefully he added:\n\"The _Go Ask Her_. She 'll be in pieces in no time. I hope they got\nashore.\"\n\nFrench Pete looked through the glasses, and then Joe. He could clearly see\nthe unfortunate sloop lifting and pounding in the surf, and on the beach he\nspied the men who made up her crew.\n\n\"Where 's ze _Ghost_?\" French Pete queried.\n\n'Frisco Kid looked for her in vain along the beach; but when he turned the\nglass seaward he quickly discovered her riding safely in the growing light,\nhalf a mile or more to windward.\n\n\"I 'll bet she did n't drag a hundred feet all night,\" he said. \"Must 've\nstruck good holding-ground.\"\n\n\"Mud,\" was French Pete's verdict. \"Just one vaire small patch of mud right\nthere. If she get t'rough it she 's a sure-enough goner, I tell you dat.\nHer anchors vaire light, only good for mud. I tell ze boys get more heavy\nanchors, but dey laugh. Some day be sorry, for sure.\"\n\nOne of the sloops to leeward raised a patch of sail and began the terrible\nstruggle out of the jaws of destruction and death. They watched her for a\nspace, rolling and plunging fearfully, and making very little headway.\n\nFrench Pete put a stop to their gazing. \"Come on!\" he shouted. \"Put two\nreef in ze mainsail! We get out queeck!\"\n\nWhile occupied with this a shout aroused them. Looking up, they saw the\n_Ghost_ dead ahead and right on top of them, and dragging down upon them\nat a furious rate.\n\nFrench Pete scrambled forward like a cat, at the same time drawing his\nknife, with one stroke of which he severed the rope that held them to\nthe spare anchor. This threw the whole weight of the _Dazzler_ on the\nchain-anchor. In consequence she swung off to the left, and just in time;\nfor the next instant, drifting stern foremost, the _Ghost_ passed over\nthe spot she had vacated.\n\n\"Why, she 's got four anchors out!\" Joe exclaimed, at sight of four taut\nropes entering the water almost horizontally from her bow.\n\n\"Two of 'em 's dredges,\" 'Frisco Kid grinned; \"and there goes the stove.\"\n\nAs he spoke, two young fellows appeared on deck and dropped the\ncooking-stove overside with a line attached.\n\n\"Phew!\" 'Frisco Kid cried. \"Look at Nelson. He 's got one reef in,\nand you can just bet that 's a sign she 's howlin'!\"\n\nThe _Reindeer_ came foaming toward them, breasting the storm like some\nmagnificent sea-animal. Red Nelson waved to them as he passed astern,\nand fifteen minutes later, when they were breaking out the one anchor\nthat remained to them, he passed well to windward on the other tack.\n\nFrench Pete followed her admiringly, though he said ominously: \"Some\nday, pouf! he go just like dat, I tell you, sure.\"\n\nA moment later the _Dazzler's_ reefed jib was flung out, and she was\nstraining and struggling in the thick of the fight. It was slow work,\nand hard and dangerous, clawing off that lee shore, and Joe found\nhimself marveling often that so small a craft could possibly endure\na minute in such elemental fury. But little by little she worked off\nthe shore and out of the ground-swell into the deeper waters of the bay,\nwhere the main-sheet was slacked away a bit, and she ran for shelter\nbehind the rock wall of the Alameda Mole a few miles away. Here they\nfound the _Reindeer_ calmly at anchor; and here, during the next several\nhours, straggled in the remainder of the fleet, with the exception of the\n_Ghost_, which had evidently gone ashore to keep the _Go Ask Her_ company.\n\nBy afternoon the wind had dropped away with surprising suddenness, and the\nweather had turned almost summer-like.\n\n\"It does n't look right,\" 'Frisco Kid said in the evening, after French\nPete had rowed over in the skiff to visit Nelson.\n\n\"What does n't look right?\" Joe asked.\n\n\"Why, the weather. It went down too sudden. It did n't have a chance\nto blow itself out, and it ain't going to quit till does blow itself\nout. It 's likely to puff up and howl at any moment, if I know anything\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Where will we go from here?\" Joe asked. \"Back to the oyster-beds?\"\n\n'Frisco Kid shook his head. \"I can't say what French Pete 'll do. He 's\nbeen fooled on the iron, and fooled on the oysters, and he 's that\ndisgusted he 's liable to do 'most anything desperate. I would n't be\nsurprised to see him go off with Nelson towards Redwood City, where that\nbig thing is that I was tellin' you about. It 's somewhere over there.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't have anything to do with it,\" Joe announced decisively.\n\n\"Of course not,\" 'Frisco Kid answered. \"And with Nelson and his two men\nan' French Pete, I don't think there 'll be any need for you anyway.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n'FRISCO KID'S DITTY-BOX\n\n\nAfter the conversation died away, the two lads lay upon the cabin for\nperhaps an hour. Then, without saying a word, 'Frisco Kid went below\nand struck a light. Joe could hear him fumbling about, and a little\nlater heard his own name called softly. On going into the cabin, he\nsaw 'Frisco Kid sitting on the edge of the bunk, a sailor's ditty-box\non his knees, and in his hand a carefully folded page from a magazine.\n\n\"Does she look like this?\" he asked, smoothing it out and turning it that\nthe other might see.\n\nIt was a half-page illustration of two girls and a boy, grouped, evidently,\nin an old-fashioned roomy attic, and holding a council of some sort. The\ngirl who was talking faced the onlooker, while the backs of the other two\nwere turned.\n\n\"Who?\" Joe queried, glancing in perplexity from the picture to 'Frisco\nKid's face.\n\n\"Your--your sister--Bessie.\"\n\nThe word seemed reluctant in coming to his lips, and he expressed\nhimself with a certain shy reverence, as though it were something\nunspeakably sacred.\n\nJoe was nonplussed for the moment. He could see no bearing between the\ntwo in point, and, anyway, girls were rather silly creatures to waste\none's time over. \"He 's actually blushing,\" he thought, regarding the\nsoft glow on the other's cheeks. He felt an irresistible desire to laugh,\nand tried to smother it down.\n\n\"No, no; don't!\" 'Frisco Kid cried, snatching the paper away and putting\nit back in the ditty-box with shaking fingers. Then he added more slowly:\n\"I thought--I--I kind o' thought you would understand, and--and--\"\n\nHis lips trembled and his eyes glistened with unwonted moistness as he\nturned hastily away.\n\nThe next instant Joe was by his side on the bunk, his arm around him.\nPrompted by some instinctive monitor, he had done it before he thought.\nA week before he could not have imagined himself in such an absurd\nsituation--his arm around a boy; but now it seemed the most natural\nthing in the world. He did not comprehend, but he knew, whatever it\nwas, that it was of deep importance to his companion.\n\n\"Go ahead and tell us,\" he urged. \"I 'll understand.\"\n\n\"No, you won't. You can't.\"\n\n\"Yes, sure. Go ahead.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid choked and shook his head. \"I don't think I could, anyway.\nIt 's more the things I feel, and I don't know how to put them in words.\"\nJoe's hand patted his shoulder reassuringly, and he went on: \"Well, it 's\nthis way. You see, I don't know much about the land, and people, and\nthings, and I never had any brothers or sisters or playmates. All the\ntime I did n't know it, but I was lonely--sort of missed them down in\nhere somewheres.\" He placed a hand over his breast. \"Did you ever feel\ndownright hungry? Well, that 's just the way I used to feel, only a\ndifferent kind of hunger, and me not knowing what it was. But one day,\noh, a long time back, I got a-hold of a magazine and saw a picture--that\npicture, with the two girls and the boy talking together. I thought it must\nbe fine to be like them, and I got to thinking about the things they said\nand did, till it came to me all of a sudden like, and I knew it was just\nloneliness was the matter with me.\n\n\"But, more than anything else, I got to wondering about the girl who looks\nout of the picture right at you. I was thinking about her all the time,\nand by and by she became real to me. You see, it was making believe, and\nI knew it all the time, and then again I did n't. Whenever I 'd think of\nthe men, and the work, and the hard life, I 'd know it was make-believe;\nbut when I 'd think of her, it was n't. I don't know; I can't explain it.\"\n\nJoe remembered all his own adventures which he had imagined on land and\nsea, and nodded. He at least understood that much.\n\n\"Of course it was all foolishness, but to have a girl like that for a\ncomrade or friend seemed more like heaven to me than anything else I\nknew of. As I said, it was a long while back, and I was only a little\nkid--that was when Red Nelson gave me my name, and I 've never been\nanything but 'Frisco Kid ever since. But the girl in the picture: I\nwas always getting that picture out to look at her, and before long,\nif I was n't square--why, I felt ashamed to look at her. Afterwards,\nwhen I was older, I came to look at it in another way. I thought,\n'Suppose, Kid, some day you were to meet a girl like that, what would\nshe think of you? Could she like you? Could she be even the least bit\nof a friend to you?' And then I 'd make up my mind to be better, to try\nand do something with myself so that she or any of her kind of people\nwould not be ashamed to know me.\n\n\"That 's why I learned to read. That 's why I ran away. Nicky Perrata,\na Greek boy, taught me my letters, and it was n't till after I learned\nto read that I found out there was anything really wrong in bay-pirating.\nI 'd been used to it ever since I could remember, and almost all the people\nI knew made their living that way. But when I did find out, I ran away,\nthinking to quit it for good. I 'll tell you about it sometime, and how\nI 'm back at it again.\n\n\"Of course she seemed a real girl when I was a youngster, and even now she\nsometimes seems that way, I 've thought so much about her. But while I 'm\ntalking to you it all clears up and she comes to me in this light: she\nstands just for a plain idea, a better, cleaner life than this, and one\nI 'd like to live; and if I could live it, why, I 'd come to know that\nkind of girls, and their kind of people--your kind, that 's what I mean.\nSo I was wondering about your sister and you, and that 's why--I don't\nknow; I guess I was just wondering. But I suppose you know lots of girls\nlike that, don't you?\"\n\nJoe nodded his head.\n\n\"Then tell me about them--something, anything,\" he added as he noted the\nfleeting expression of doubt in the other's eyes.\n\n\"Oh, that 's easy,\" Joe began valiantly. To a certain extent he did\nunderstand the lad's hunger, and it seemed a simple enough task to at\nleast partially satisfy him. \"To begin with, they 're like--hem!--why,\nthey 're like--girls, just girls.\" He broke off with a miserable sense\nof failure.\n\n'Frisco Kid waited patiently, his face a study in expectancy.\n\nJoe struggled valiantly to marshal his forces. To his mind, in quick\nsuccession, came the girls with whom he had gone to school--the sisters\nof the boys he knew, and those who were his sister's friends: slim girls\nand plump girls, tall girls and short girls, blue-eyed and brown-eyed,\ncurly-haired, black-haired, golden-haired; in short, a procession of girls\nof all sorts and descriptions. But, to save himself, he could say nothing\nabout them. Anyway, he 'd never been a \"sissy,\" and why should he be\nexpected to know anything about them? \"All girls are alike,\" he concluded\ndesperately. \"They 're just the same as the ones you know, Kid--sure\nthey are.\"\n\n\"But I don't know any.\"\n\nJoe whistled. \"And never did?\"\n\n\"Yes, one. Carlotta Gispardi. But she could n't speak English, and I could\nn't speak Dago; and she died. I don't care; though I never knew any, I seem\nto know as much about them as you do.\"\n\n\"And I guess I know more about adventures all over the world than you do,\"\nJoe retorted.\n\nBoth boys laughed. But a moment later, Joe fell into deep thought. It had\ncome upon him quite swiftly that he had not been duly grateful for the good\nthings of life he did possess. Already home, father, and mother had assumed\na greater significance to him; but he now found himself placing a higher\npersonal value upon his sister and his chums and friends. He had never\nappreciated them properly, he thought, but henceforth--well, there would\nbe a different tale to tell.\n\nThe voice of French Pete hailing them put a finish to the conversation,\nfor they both ran on deck.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n'FRISCO KID TELLS HIS STORY\n\n\n\"Get up ze mainsail and break out ze hook!\" the Frenchman shouted. \"And\nden tail on to ze _Reindeer_! No side-lights!\"\n\n\"Come! Cast off those gaskets--lively!\" 'Frisco Kid ordered. \"Now lay on\nto the peak-halyards--there, that rope--cast it off the pin. And don't\nhoist ahead of me. There! Make fast! We 'll stretch it afterwards. Run aft\nand come in on the main-sheet! Shove the helm up!\"\n\nUnder the sudden driving power of the mainsail, the _Dazzler_ strained\nand tugged at her anchor like an impatient horse till the muddy iron left\nthe bottom with a rush and she was free.\n\n\"Let go the sheet! Come for'ard again and lend a hand on the chain! Stand\nby to give her the jib!\" 'Frisco Kid the boy who mooned over girls in\npictorial magazines had vanished, and 'Frisco Kid the sailor, strong and\ndominant, was on deck. He ran aft and tacked about as the jib rattled aloft\nin the hands of Joe, who quickly joined him. Just then the _Reindeer_,\nlike a monstrous bat, passed to leeward of them in the gloom.\n\n\"Ah, dose boys! Dey take all-a night!\" they heard French Pete exclaim, and\nthen the gruff voice of Red Nelson, who said: \"Never you mind, Frenchy. I\ntaught the Kid his sailorizing, and I ain't never been ashamed of him yet.\"\n\nThe _Reindeer_ was the faster boat, but by spilling the wind from her sails\nthey managed so that the boys could keep them in sight. The breeze came\nsteadily in from the west, with a promise of early increase. The stars were\nbeing blotted out by masses of driving clouds, which indicated a greater\nvelocity in the upper strata. 'Frisco Kid surveyed the sky.\n\n\"Going to have it good and stiff before morning,\" he said, \"just as I\ntold you.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, both boats stood in for the San Mateo shore, and\ndropped anchor not more than a cable's-length away. A little wharf ran\nout, the bare end of which was perceptible to them, though they could\ndiscern a small yacht lying moored to a buoy a short distance away.\n\nAccording to their custom, everything was put in readiness for hasty\ndeparture. The anchors could be tripped and the sails flung out on a\nmoment's notice. Both skiffs came over noiselessly from the _Reindeer_.\nRed Nelson had given one of his two men to French Pete, so that each\nskiff was doubly manned. They were not a very prepossessing group of\nmen,--at least, Joe did not think so,--for their faces bore a savage\nseriousness which almost made him shiver. The captain of the _Dazzler_\nbuckled on his pistol-belt, and placed a rifle and a stout double-block\ntackle in the boat. Then he poured out wine all around, and, standing in\nthe darkness of the little cabin, they pledged success to the expedition.\nRed Nelson was also armed, while his men wore at their hips the customary\nsailor's sheath-knife. They were very slow and careful to avoid noise\nin getting into the boats, French Pete pausing long enough to warn the\nboys to remain quietly aboard and not try any tricks.\n\n\"Now 'd be your chance, Joe, if they had n't taken the skiff,\" 'Frisco Kid\nwhispered, when the boats had vanished into the loom of the land.\n\n\"What 's the matter with the _Dazzler_?\" was the unexpected answer. \"We\ncould up sail and away before you could say Jack Robinson.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid hesitated. The spirit of comradeship was strong in the lad,\nand deserting a companion in a pinch could not but be repulsive to him.\n\n\"I don't think it 'd be exactly square to leave them in the lurch ashore,\"\nhe said. \"Of course,\" he went on hurriedly, \"I know the whole thing 's\nwrong; but you remember that first night, when you came running through\nthe water for the skiff, and those fellows on the bank busy popping away?\nWe did n't leave you in the lurch, did we?\"\n\nJoe assented reluctantly, and then a new thought flashed across his mind.\n\"But they 're pirates--and thieves--and criminals. They 're breaking the\nlaw, and you and I are not willing to be lawbreakers. Besides, they 'll\nnot be left. There 's the _Reindeer_. There 's nothing to prevent them\nfrom getting away on her, and they 'll never catch us in the dark.\"\n\n\"Come on, then.\" Though he had agreed, 'Frisco Kid did not quite like it,\nfor it still seemed to savor of desertion.\n\nThey crawled forward and began to hoist the mainsail. The anchor they\ncould slip, if necessary, and save the time of pulling it up. But at the\nfirst rattle of the halyards on the sheaves a warning \"Hist!\" came to\nthem through the darkness, followed by a loudly whispered \"Drop that!\"\n\nGlancing in the direction from which these sounds proceeded, they made\nout a white face peering at them from over the rail of the other sloop.\n\n\"Aw, it 's only the _Reindeer's_ boy,\" 'Frisco Kid said. \"Come on.\"\n\nAgain they were interrupted at the first rattling of the blocks.\n\n\"I say, you fellers, you 'd better let go them halyards pretty quick,\nI 'm a-tellin' you, or I 'll give you what for!\"\n\nThis threat being dramatically capped by the click of a cocking pistol,\n'Frisco Kid obeyed and went grumblingly back to the cockpit. \"Oh, there 's\nplenty more chances to come,\" he whispered consolingly to Joe. \"French Pete\nwas cute, was n't he? He thought you might be trying to make a break, and\nput a guard on us.\"\n\nNothing came from the shore to indicate how the pirates were faring. Not\na dog barked, not a light flared. Yet the air seemed quivering with an\nalarm about to burst forth. The night had taken on a strained feeling of\nintensity, as though it held in store all kinds of terrible things. The\nboys felt this keenly as they huddled against each other in the cockpit\nand waited.\n\n\"You were going to tell me about your running away,\" Joe ventured finally,\n\"and why you came back again.\"\n\n'Frisco Kid took up the tale at once, speaking in a muffled undertone\nclose to the other's ear.\n\n\"You see, when I made up my mind to quit the life, there was n't a soul\nto lend me a hand; but I knew that the only thing for me to do was to\nget ashore and find some kind of work, so I could study. Then I figured\nthere 'd be more chance in the country than in the city; so I gave Red\nNelson the slip--I was on the _Reindeer_ then. One night on the Alameda\noyster-beds, I got ashore and headed back from the bay as fast as I\ncould sprint. Nelson did n't catch me. But they were all Portuguese\nfarmers thereabouts, and none of them had work for me. Besides, it was\nin the wrong time of the year--winter. That shows how much I knew about\nthe land.\n\n\"I 'd saved up a couple of dollars, and I kept traveling back, deeper\nand deeper into the country, looking for work, and buying bread and\ncheese and such things from the storekeepers. I tell you, it was cold,\nnights, sleeping out without blankets, and I was always glad when morning\ncame. But worse than that was the way everybody looked on me. They were\nall suspicious, and not a bit afraid to show it, and sometimes they 'd\nset their dogs on me and tell me to get along. Seemed as though there\nwas n't any place for me on the land. Then my money gave out, and just\nabout the time I was good and hungry I got captured.\"\n\n\"Captured! What for?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Living, I suppose. I crawled into a haystack to sleep one night,\nbecause it was warmer, and along comes a village constable and arrests me\nfor being a tramp. At first they thought I was a runaway, and telegraphed\nmy description all over. I told them I did n't have any people, but they\nwould n't believe me for a long while. And then, when nobody claimed me,\nthe judge sent me to a boys' 'refuge' in San Francisco.\"\n\nHe stopped and peered intently in the direction of the shore. The darkness\nand the silence in which the men had been swallowed up was profound.\nNothing was stirring save the rising wind.\n\n\"I thought I 'd die in that 'refuge.' It was just like being in jail. We\nwere locked up and guarded like prisoners. Even then, if I could have\nliked the other boys it might have been all right. But they were mostly\nstreet-boys of the worst kind--lying, and sneaking, and cowardly, without\none spark of manhood or one idea of square dealing and fair play. There\nwas only one thing I did like, and that was the books. Oh, I did lots of\nreading, I tell you! But that could n't make up for the rest. I wanted\nthe freedom and the sunlight and the salt water. And what had I done to\nbe kept in prison and herded with such a gang? Instead of doing wrong,\nI had tried to do right, to make myself better, and that 's what I got\nfor it. I was n't old enough, you see, to reason anything out.\n\n\"Sometimes I 'd see the sunshine dancing on the water and showing white\non the sails, and the _Reindeer_ cutting through it just as you please,\nand I 'd get that sick I would know hardly what I did. And then the boys\nwould come against me with some of their meannesses, and I 'd start in\nto lick the whole kit of them. Then the men in charge would lock me up\nand punish me. Well, I could n't stand it any longer; I watched my chance\nand ran for it. Seemed as though there was n't any place on the land for\nme, so I picked up with French Pete and went back on the bay. That 's about\nall there is to it, though I 'm going to try it again when I get a little\nolder--old enough to get a square deal for myself.\"\n\n\"You 're going to go back on the land with me,\" Joe said authoritatively,\nlaying a hand on his shoulder. \"That 's what you 're going to do. As for--\"\n\nBang! a revolver-shot rang out from the shore. Bang! bang! More guns were\nspeaking sharply and hurriedly. A man's voice rose wildly on the air and\ndied away. Somebody began to cry for help. Both boys were on their feet on\nthe instant, hoisting the mainsail and getting everything ready to run.\nThe _Reindeer_ boy was doing likewise. A man, roused from his sleep on\nthe yacht, thrust an excited head through the skylight, but withdrew it\nhastily at sight of the two stranger sloops. The intensity of waiting was\nbroken, the time for action come.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA NEW RESPONSIBILITY FOR JOE\n\n\nHeaving in on the anchor-chain till it was up and down, 'Frisco Kid\nand Joe ceased from their exertions. Everything was in readiness to\ngive the _Dazzler_ the jib, and go. They strained their eyes in the\ndirection of the shore. The clamor had died away, but here and there\nlights were beginning to flash. The creaking of a block and tackle\ncame to their ears, and they heard Red Nelson's voice singing out:\n\"Lower away!\" and \"Cast off!\"\n\n\"French Pete forgot to oil it,\" 'Frisco Kid commented, referring to\nthe tackle.\n\n\"Takin' their time about it, ain't they?\" the boy on the _Reindeer_\ncalled over to them, sitting down on the cabin and mopping his face\nafter the exertion of hoisting the mainsail single-handed.\n\n\"Guess they 're all right,\" 'Frisco Kid rejoined. \"All ready?\"\n\n\"Yes--all right here.\"\n\n\"Say, you,\" the man on the yacht cried through the skylight, not\nventuring to show his head. \"You 'd better go away.\"\n\n\"And you 'd better stay below and keep quiet,\" was the response.\n\"We 'll take care of ourselves. You do the same.\"\n\n\"If I was only out of this, I 'd show you!\" he threatened.\n\n\"Lucky for you you 're not,\" responded the boy on the _Reindeer_;\nand thereat the man kept quiet.\n\n\"Here they come!\" said 'Frisco Kid suddenly to Joe.\n\nThe two skiffs shot out of the darkness and came alongside. Some kind\nof an altercation was going on, as French Pete's voice attested.\n\n\"No, no!\" he cried. \"Put it on ze _Dazzler_. Ze _Reindeer_ she sail too\nfast-a, and run away, oh, so queeck, and never more I see it. Put it on\nze _Dazzler_. Eh? Wot you say?\"\n\n\"All right then,\" Red Nelson agreed. \"We 'll whack up afterwards. But,\nsay, hurry up. Out with you, lads, and heave her up! My arm 's broke.\"\n\nThe men tumbled out, ropes were cast inboard, and all hands, with the\nexception of Joe, tailed on. The shouting of men, the sound of oars, and\nthe rattling and slapping of blocks and sails, told that the men on shore\nwere getting under way for the pursuit.\n\n\"Now!\" Red Nelson commanded. \"All together! Don't let her come back or\nyou 'll smash the skiff. There she takes it! A long pull and a strong\npull! Once again! And yet again! Get a turn there, somebody, and take\na spell.\"\n\nThough the task was but half accomplished, they were exhausted by the\nstrenuous effort, and hailed the rest eagerly. Joe glanced over the side\nto discover what the heavy object might be, and saw the vague outlines\nof a small office-safe.\n\n\"Now all together!\" Red Nelson began again. \"Take her on the run and don't\nlet her stop! Yo, ho! heave, ho! Once again! And another! Over with her!\"\n\nStraining and gasping, with tense muscles and heaving chests, they brought\nthe cumbersome weight over the side, rolled it on top of the rail, and\nlowered it into the cockpit on the run. The cabin doors were thrown apart,\nand it was moved along, end for end, till it lay on the cabin floor, snug\nagainst the end of the centerboard-case. Red Nelson had followed it aboard\nto superintend. His left arm hung helpless at his side, and from the\nfinger-tips blood dripped with monotonous regularity. He did not seem to\nmind it, however, nor even the mutterings of the human storm he had raised\nashore, and which, to judge by the sounds, was even then threatening to\nbreak upon them.\n\n\"Lay your course for the Golden Gate,\" he said to French Pete, as he turned\nto go. \"I 'll try to stand by you, but if you get lost in the dark I 'll\nmeet you outside, off the Farralones, in the morning.\" He sprang into the\nskiff after the men, and, with a wave of his uninjured arm, cried heartily:\n\"And then it 's for Mexico, my lads--Mexico and summer weather!\"\n\nJust as the _Dazzler_, freed from her anchor, paid off under the jib and\nfilled away, a dark sail loomed under their stern, barely missing the skiff\nin tow. The cockpit of the stranger was crowded with men, who raised their\nvoices angrily at sight of the pirates. Joe had half a mind to run forward\nand cut the halyards so that the _Dazzler_ might be captured. As he had\ntold French Pete the day before, he had done nothing to be ashamed of, and\nwas not afraid to go before a court of justice. But the thought of 'Frisco\nKid restrained him. He wanted to take him ashore with him, but in so doing\nhe did not wish to take him to jail. So he, too, began to experience a keen\ninterest in the escape of the _Dazzler_.\n\nThe pursuing sloop rounded up hurriedly to come about after them, and in\nthe darkness fouled the yacht which lay at anchor. The man aboard of her,\nthinking that at last his time had come, gave one wild yell, ran on deck,\nand leaped overboard. In the confusion of the collision, and while they\nwere endeavoring to save him, French Pete and the boys slipped away into\nthe night.\n\nThe _Reindeer_ had already disappeared, and by the time Joe and 'Frisco\nKid had the running-gear coiled down and everything in shape, they were\nstanding out in open water. The wind was freshening constantly, and the\n_Dazzler_ heeled a lively clip through the comparatively smooth stretch.\nBefore an hour had passed, the lights of Hunter's Point were well on her\nstarboard beam. 'Frisco Kid went below to make coffee, but Joe remained\non deck, watching the lights of South San Francisco grow, and speculating\non their destination. Mexico! They were going to sea in such a frail craft!\nImpossible! At least, it seemed so to him, for his conceptions of ocean\ntravel were limited to steamers and full-rigged ships. He was beginning\nto feel half sorry that he had not cut the halyards, and longed to ask\nFrench Pete a thousand questions; but just as the first was on his lips\nthat worthy ordered him to go below and get some coffee and then to turn\nin. He was followed shortly afterward by 'Frisco Kid, French Pete remaining\nat his lonely task of beating down the bay and out to sea. Twice he heard\nthe waves buffeted back from some flying forefoot, and once he saw a sail\nto leeward on the opposite tack, which luffed sharply and came about at\nsight of him. But the darkness favored, and he heard no more of it--perhaps\nbecause he worked into the wind closer by a point, and held on his way\nwith a shaking after-leech.\n\nShortly after dawn, the two boys were called and came sleepily on deck.\nThe day had broken cold and gray, while the wind had attained half a gale.\nJoe noted with astonishment the white tents of the quarantine station on\nAngel Island. San Francisco lay a smoky blur on the southern horizon,\nwhile the night, still lingering on the western edge of the world, slowly\nwithdrew before their eyes. French Pete was just finishing a long reach\ninto the Raccoon Straits, and at the same time studiously regarding a\nplunging sloop-yacht half a mile astern.\n\n\"Dey t'ink to catch ze _Dazzler_, eh? Bah!\" And he brought the craft\nin question about, laying a course straight for the Golden Gate.\n\nThe pursuing yacht followed suit. Joe watched her a few moments. She held\nan apparently parallel course to them, and forged ahead much faster.\n\n\"Why, at this rate they 'll have us in no time!\" he cried.\n\nFrench Pete laughed. \"You t'ink so? Bah! Dey outfoot; we outpoint. Dey\nare scared of ze wind; we wipe ze eye of ze wind. Ah! you wait, you see.\"\n\n\"They 're traveling ahead faster,\" 'Frisco Kid explained, \"but we 're\nsailing closer to the wind. In the end we 'll beat them, even if they\nhave the nerve to cross the bar--which I don't think they have. Look! See!\"\n\nAhead could be seen the great ocean surges, flinging themselves skyward\nand bursting into roaring caps of smother. In the midst of it, now rolling\nher dripping bottom clear, now sousing her deck-load of lumber far above\nthe guards, a coasting steam-schooner was lumbering drunkenly into port.\nIt was magnificent--this battle between man and the elements. Whatever\ntimidity he had entertained fled away, and Joe's nostrils began to dilate\nand his eyes to flash at the nearness of the impending struggle.\n\nFrench Pete called for his oilskins and sou'wester, and Joe also was\nequipped with a spare suit. Then he and 'Frisco Kid were sent below to\nlash and cleat the safe in place. In the midst of this task Joe glanced\nat the firm-name, gilt-lettered on the face of it, and read: \"Bronson\n& Tate.\" Why, that was his father and his father's partner. That was their\nsafe, their money! 'Frisco Kid, nailing the last cleat on the floor of\nthe cabin, looked up and followed his fascinated gaze.\n\n\"That 's rough, is n't it,\" he whispered. \"Your father?\"\n\nJoe nodded. He could see it all now. They had run into San Andreas,\nwhere his father worked the big quarries, and most probably the safe\ncontained the wages of the thousand men or more whom he employed.\n\"Don't say anything,\" he cautioned.\n\n'Frisco Kid agreed knowingly. \"French Pete can't read, anyway,\" he\nmuttered, \"and the chances are that Red Nelson won't know what _your_\nname is. But, just the same, it 's pretty rough. They 'll break it open\nand divide up as soon as they can, so I don't see what you 're going to\ndo about it.\"\n\n\"Wait and see.\"\nJoe had made up his mind that he would do his best to stand by his\nfather's property. At the worst, it could only be lost; and that would\nsurely be the case were he not along, while, being along, he at least\nhad a fighting chance to save it, or to be in position to recover it.\nResponsibilities were showering upon him thick and fast. But a few days\nback he had had but himself to consider; then, in some subtle way, he\nhad felt a certain accountability for 'Frisco Kid's future welfare; and\nafter that, and still more subtly, he had become aware of duties which\nhe owed to his position, to his sister, to his chums and friends; and\nnow, by a most unexpected chain of circumstances, came the pressing need\nof service for his father's sake. It was a call upon his deepest strength,\nand he responded bravely. While the future might be doubtful, he had no\ndoubt of himself; and this very state of mind, this self-confidence, by\na generous alchemy, gave him added resolution. Nor did he fail to be\nvaguely aware of it, and to grasp dimly at the truth that confidence\nbreeds confidence--strength, strength.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE BOYS PLAN AN ESCAPE\n\n\n\"Now she takes it!\" French Pete cried.\n\nBoth lads ran into the cockpit. They were on the edge of the breaking bar.\nA huge forty-footer reared a foam-crested head far above them, stealing\ntheir wind for the moment and threatening to crush the tiny craft like\nan egg-shell. Joe held his breath. It was the supreme moment. French Pete\nluffed straight into it, and the _Dazzler_ mounted the steep slope with\na rush, poised a moment on the giddy summit, and fell into the yawning\nvalley beyond. Keeping off in the intervals to fill the mainsail, and\nluffing into the combers, they worked their way across the dangerous\nstretch. Once they caught the tail-end of a whitecap and were well-nigh\nsmothered in the froth, but otherwise the sloop bobbed and ducked with\nthe happy facility of a cork.\n\nTo Joe it seemed as though he had been lifted out of himself--out of\nthe world. Ah, this was life! this was action! Surely it could not be\nthe old, commonplace world he had lived in so long! The sailors, grouped\non the streaming deck-load of the steamer, waved their sou'westers, and,\non the bridge, even the captain was expressing his admiration for the\nplucky craft.\n\n\"Ah, you see! you see!\" French Pete pointed astern.\n\nThe sloop-yacht had been afraid to venture it, and was skirting back\nand forth on the inner edge of the bar. The chase was over. A pilot-boat,\nrunning for shelter from the coming storm, flew by them like a frightened\nbird, passing the steamer as though the latter were standing still.\n\nHalf an hour later the _Dazzler_ sped beyond the last smoking sea and was\nsliding up and down on the long Pacific swell. The wind had increased its\nvelocity and necessitated a reefing down of jib and mainsail. Then they\nlaid off again, full and free on the starboard tack, for the Farralones,\nthirty miles away. By the time breakfast was cooked and eaten they picked\nup the _Reindeer_, which was hove to and working offshore to the south and\nwest. The wheel was lashed down, and there was not a soul on deck.\n\nFrench Pete complained bitterly against such recklessness. \"Dat is ze one\nfault of Red Nelson. He no care. He is afraid of not'ing. Some day he will\ndie, oh, so vaire queeck! I know he will.\"\n\nThree times they circled about the _Reindeer_, running under her weather\nquarter and shouting in chorus, before they brought anybody on deck. Sail\nwas then made at once, and together the two cockle-shells plunged away\ninto the vastness of the Pacific. This was necessary, as 'Frisco Kid\ninformed Joe, in order to have an offing before the whole fury of the\nstorm broke upon them. Otherwise they would be driven on the lee shore\nof the California coast. Grub and water, he said, could be obtained by\nrunning into the land when fine weather came. He congratulated Joe upon\nthe fact that he was not seasick, which circumstance likewise brought\npraise from French Pete and put him in better humor with his mutinous\nyoung sailor.\n\n\"I 'll tell you what we 'll do,\" 'Frisco Kid whispered, while cooking\ndinner. \"To-night we 'll drag French Pete down--\"\n\n\"Drag French Pete down!\"\n\n\"Yes, and tie him up good and snug, as soon as it gets dark; then put\nout the lights and make a run for land; get to port anyway, anywhere,\njust so long as we shake loose from Red Nelson.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Joe deliberated; \"that would be all right--if I could do it\nalone. But as for asking you to help me--why, that would be treason\nto French Pete.\"\n\n\"That 's what I 'm coming to. I 'll help you if you promise me a few\nthings. French Pete took me aboard when I ran away from the 'refuge,'\nwhen I was starving and had no place to go, and I just can't repay him\nfor that by sending him to jail. 'T would n't be square. Your father\nwould n't have you break your word, would he?\"\n\n\"No; of course not.\" Joe knew how sacredly his father held his word\nof honor.\n\n\"Then you must promise, and your father must see it carried out, not\nto press any charge against French Pete.\"\n\n\"All right. And now, what about yourself? You can't very well expect\nto go away with him again on the _Dazzler_!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother about me. There 's nobody to miss me. I 'm strong\nenough, and know enough about it, to ship to sea as ordinary seaman.\nI 'll go away somewhere over on the other side of the world, and begin\nall over again.\"\n\n\"Then we 'll have to call it off, that 's all.\"\n\n\"Call what off?\"\n\n\"Tying French Pete up and running for it.\"\n\n\"No, sir. That 's decided upon.\"\n\n\"Now listen here: I 'll not have a thing to do with it. I 'll go on to\nMexico first, if you don't make me one promise.\"\n\n\"And what 's the promise?\"\n\n\"Just this: you place yourself in my hands from the moment we get ashore,\nand trust to me. You don't know anything about the land, anyway--you said\nso. And I 'll fix it with my father--I know I can--so that you can get to\nknow people of the right sort, and study and get an education, and be\nsomething else than a bay pirate or a sailor. That 's what you 'd like,\nis n't it?\"\n\nThough he said nothing, 'Frisco Kid showed how well he liked it by the\nexpression of his face.\n\n\"And it 'll be no more than your due, either,\" Joe continued. \"You will\nhave stood by me, and you 'll have recovered my father's money. He 'll\nowe it to you.\"\n\n\"But I don't do things that way. I don't think much of a man who does\na favor just to be paid for it.\"\n\n\"Now you keep quiet. How much do you think it would cost my father for\ndetectives and all that to recover that safe? Give me your promise, that\n's all, and when I 've got things arranged, if you don't like them you\ncan back out. Come on; that 's fair.\"\n\nThey shook hands on the bargain, and proceeded to map out their line of\naction for the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the storm, yelling down out of the northwest, had something entirely\ndifferent in store for the _Dazzler_ and her crew. By the time dinner was\nover they were forced to put double reefs in mainsail and jib, and still\nthe gale had not reached its height. The sea, also, had been kicked up till\nit was a continuous succession of water-mountains, frightful and withal\ngrand to look upon from the low deck of the sloop. It was only when the\nsloops were tossed upon the crests of the waves at the same time that they\ncaught sight of each other. Occasional fragments of seas swashed into the\ncockpit or dashed aft over the cabin, and Joe was stationed at the small\npump to keep the well dry.\n\nAt three o'clock, watching his chance, French Pete motioned to the\n_Reindeer_ that he was going to heave to and get out a sea-anchor.\nThis latter was of the nature of a large shallow canvas bag, with the\nmouth held open by triangularly lashed spars. To this the towing-ropes\nwere attached, on the kite principle, so that the greatest resisting\nsurface was presented to the water. The sloop, drifting so much faster,\nwould thus be held bow on to both wind and sea--the safest possible\nposition in a storm. Red Nelson waved his hand in response that he\nunderstood and to go ahead.\n\nFrench Pete went forward to launch the sea-anchor himself, leaving it\nto 'Frisco Kid to put the helm down at the proper moment and run into\nthe wind. The Frenchman poised on the slippery fore-deck, waiting an\nopportunity. But at that moment the _Dazzler_ lifted into an unusually\nlarge sea, and, as she cleared the summit, caught a heavy snort of the\ngale at the very instant she was righting herself to an even keel. Thus\nthere was not the slightest yield to this sudden pressure on her sails\nand mast-gear.\n\nThere was a quick snap, followed by a crash. The steel weather-rigging\ncarried away at the lanyards, and mast, jib, mainsail, blocks, stays,\nsea-anchor, French Pete--everything--went over the side. Almost by a\nmiracle, the captain clutched at the bobstay and managed to get one hand\nup and over the bowsprit. The boys ran forward to drag him into safety,\nand Red Nelson, observing the disaster, put up his helm and ran down to\nthe rescue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nPERILOUS HOURS\n\n\nFrench Pete was uninjured from the fall overboard with the _Dazzler's_\nmast; but the sea-anchor, which had gone with him, had not escaped so\neasily. The gaff of the mainsail had been driven through it, and it\nrefused to work. The wreckage, thumping alongside, held the sloop in\na quartering slant to the seas--not so dangerous a position as it might\nbe, nor so safe, either. \"Good-by, old-a _Dazzler_. Never no more you\nwipe ze eye of ze wind. Never no more you kick your heels at ze crack\ngentlemen-yachts.\"\n\nSo the captain lamented, standing in the cockpit and surveying the ruin\nwith wet eyes. Even Joe, who bore him great dislike, felt sorry for him\nat this moment. A heavier blast of the wind caught the jagged crest of\na wave and hurled it upon the helpless craft.\n\n\"Can't we save her?\" Joe spluttered.\n\n'Frisco Kid shook his head.\n\n\"Nor the safe?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" he answered. \"Could n't lay another boat alongside for a\nUnited States mint. As it is, it 'll keep us guessing to save ourselves.\"\n\nAnother sea swept over them, and the skiff, which had long since been\nswamped, dashed itself to pieces against the stern. Then the _Reindeer_\ntowered above them on a mountain of water. Joe caught himself half\nshrinking back, for it seemed she would fall down squarely on top\nof them; but the next instant she dropped into the gaping trough,\nand they were looking down upon her far below. It was a striking\npicture--one Joe was destined never to forget. The _Reindeer_ was\nwallowing in the snow-white smother, her rails flush with the sea,\nthe water scudding across her deck in foaming cataracts. The air was\nfilled with flying spray, which made the scene appear hazy and unreal.\nOne of the men was clinging to the perilous after-deck and striving\nto cast off the water-logged skiff. The boy, leaning far over the\ncockpit-rail and holding on for dear life, was passing him a knife.\nThe second man stood at the wheel, putting it up with flying hands\nand forcing the sloop to pay off. Beside him, his injured arm in a\nsling, was Red Nelson, his sou'wester gone and his fair hair plastered\nin wet, wind-blown ringlets about his face. His whole attitude breathed\nindomitability, courage, strength. It seemed almost as though the divine\nwere blazing forth from him. Joe looked upon him in sudden awe, and,\nrealizing the enormous possibilities of the man, felt sorrow for the way\nin which they had been wasted. A thief and a robber! In that flashing\nmoment Joe caught a glimpse of human truth, grasped at the mystery of\nsuccess and failure. Life threw back its curtains that he might read it\nand understand. Of such stuff as Red Nelson were heroes made; but they\npossessed wherein he lacked--the power of choice, the careful poise of\nmind, the sober control of soul: in short, the very things his father\nhad so often \"preached\" to him about.\n\nThese were the thoughts which came to Joe in the flight of a second. Then\nthe _Reindeer_ swept skyward and hurtled across their bow to leeward on\nthe breast of a mighty billow.\n\n\"Ze wild man! ze wild man!\" French Pete shrieked, watching her in\namazement. \"He t'inks he can jibe! He will die! We will all die! He\nmust come about. Oh, ze fool, ze fool!\"\n\nBut time was precious, and Red Nelson ventured the chance. At the right\nmoment he jibed the mainsail over and hauled back on the wind.\n\n\"Here she comes! Make ready to jump for it,\" 'Frisco Kid cried to Joe.\n\nThe _Reindeer_ dashed by their stern, heeling over till the cabin windows\nwere buried, and so close that it appeared she must run them down. But a\nfreak of the waters lurched the two crafts apart. Red Nelson, seeing that\nthe manoeuver had miscarried, instantly instituted another. Throwing the\nhelm hard up, the _Reindeer_ whirled on her heel, thus swinging her\noverhanging main-boom closer to the _Dazzler_. French Pete was the\nnearest, and the opportunity could last no longer than a second. Like\na cat he sprang, catching the foot-rope with both hands. Then the\n_Reindeer_ forged ahead, dipping him into the sea at every plunge. But\nhe clung on, working inboard every time he emerged, till he dropped into\nthe cockpit as Red Nelson squared off to run down to leeward and repeat\nthe manoeuver.\n\n\"Your turn next,\" 'Frisco Kid said.\n\n\"No; yours,\" Joe replied.\n\n\"But I know more about the water,\" 'Frisco Kid insisted.\n\n\"And I can swim as well as you,\" the other retorted.\n\nIt would have been hard to forecast the outcome of this dispute; but,\nas it was, the swift rush of events made any settlement needless. The\n_Reindeer_ had jibed over and was plowing back at breakneck speed,\ncareening at such an angle that it seemed she must surely capsize. It\nwas a gallant sight. Just then the storm burst in all its fury, the\nshouting wind flattening the ragged crests till they boiled. The\n_Reindeer_ dipped from view behind an immense wave. The wave rolled\non, but the next moment, where the sloop had been, the boys noted with\nstartled eyes only the angry waters! Doubting, they looked a second time.\nThere was no _Reindeer_. They were alone on the torn crest of the ocean!\n\n\"God have mercy on their souls!\" 'Frisco Kid said solemnly.\n\nJoe was too horrified at the suddenness of the catastrophe to utter\na sound.\n\n\"Sailed her clean under, and, with the ballast she carried, went\nstraight to bottom,\" 'Frisco Kid gasped. Then, turning to their own\npressing need, he said: \"Now we 've got to look out for ourselves.\nThe back of the storm broke in that puff, but the sea 'll kick up\nworse yet as the wind eases down. Lend a hand and hang on with the\nother. We 've got to get her head-on.\"\n\nTogether, knives in hand, they crawled forward to where the pounding\nwreckage hampered the boat sorely. 'Frisco Kid took the lead in the\nticklish work, but Joe obeyed orders like a veteran. Every minute or\ntwo the bow was swept by the sea, and they were pounded and buffeted\nabout like a pair of shuttlecocks. First the main portion of the\nwreckage was securely fastened to the forward bitts; then, breathless\nand gasping, more often under the water than out, they cut and hacked\nat the tangle of halyards, sheets, stays, and tackles. The cockpit was\ntaking water rapidly, and it was a race between swamping and completing\nthe task. At last, however, everything stood clear save the lee rigging.\n'Frisco Kid slashed the lanyards. The storm did the rest. The _Dazzler_\ndrifted swiftly to leeward of the wreckage till the strain on the line\nfast to the forward bitts jerked her bow into place and she ducked dead\ninto the eye of the wind and sea.\n\nPausing only for a cheer at the success of their undertaking, the two lads\nraced aft, where the cockpit was half full and the dunnage of the cabin\nall afloat. With a couple of buckets procured from the stern lockers, they\nproceeded to fling the water overboard. It was heartbreaking work, for\nmany a barrelful was flung back upon them again; but they persevered, and\nwhen night fell the _Dazzler_, bobbing merrily at her sea-anchor, could\nboast that her pumps sucked once more. As 'Frisco Kid had said, the\nbackbone of the storm was broken, though the wind had veered to the west,\nwhere it still blew stiffly.\n\n\"If she holds,\" 'Frisco Kid said, referring to the breeze, \"we 'll drift\nto the California coast sometime to-morrow. Nothing to do now but wait.\"\n\nThey said little, oppressed by the loss of their comrades and overcome\nwith exhaustion, preferring to huddle against each other for the sake\nof warmth and companionship. It was a miserable night, and they shivered\nconstantly from the cold. Nothing dry was to be obtained aboard, food,\nblankets, everything being soaked with the salt water. Sometimes they\ndozed; but these intervals were short and harassing, for it seemed each\ntook turn in waking with such sudden starts as to rouse the other.\n\nAt last day broke, and they looked about. Wind and sea had dropped\nconsiderably, and there was no question as to the safety of the\n_Dazzler_. The coast was nearer than they had expected, its cliffs\nshowing dark and forbidding in the gray of dawn. But with the rising\nof the sun they could see the yellow beaches, flanked by the white\nsurf, and beyond--it seemed too good to be true--the clustering houses\nand smoking chimneys of a town.\n\n\"Santa Cruz!\" 'Frisco Kid cried, \"and no chance of being wrecked in\nthe surf!\"\n\n\"Then the safe _is_ safe?\" Joe queried.\n\n\"Safe! I should say so. It ain't much of a sheltered harbor for large\nvessels, but with this breeze we 'll run right up the mouth of the\nSan Lorenzo River. Then there 's a little lake like, and a boat-house.\nWater smooth as glass and hardly over your head. You see, I was down\nhere once before, with Red Nelson. Come on. We 'll be in in time for\nbreakfast.\"\n\nBringing to light some spare coils of rope from the lockers, he put a\nclove-hitch on the standing part of the sea-anchor hawser, and carried\nthe new running-line aft, making it fast to the stern bitts. Then he\ncast off from the forward bitts. The _Dazzler_ swung off into the trough,\ncompleted the evolution, and pointed her nose toward shore. A couple of\nspare oars from below, and as many water-soaked blankets, sufficed to\nmake a jury-mast and sail. When this was in place, Joe cast loose from\nthe wreckage, which was now towing astern, while 'Frisco Kid took the\ntiller.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nJOE AND HIS FATHER\n\n\n\"How 's that?\" cried 'Frisco Kid, as he finished making the _Dazzler_\nfast fore and aft, and sat down on the stringpiece of the tiny wharf.\n\"What 'll we do next, captain?\"\n\nJoe looked up in quick surprise. \"Why--I--what 's the matter?\"\n\n\"Well, ain't you captain now? Have n't we reached land? I 'm crew from\nnow on, ain't I? What 's your orders?\"\n\nJoe caught the spirit of it. \"Pipe all hands for breakfast--that is--wait\na minute.\"\n\nDiving below, he possessed himself of the money he had stowed away in his\nbundle when he came aboard. Then he locked the cabin door, and they went\nuptown in search of a restaurant. Over the breakfast Joe planned the next\nmove, and, when they had done, communicated it to 'Frisco Kid.\n\nIn response to his inquiry, the cashier told him when the morning train\nstarted for San Francisco. He glanced at the clock.\n\n\"Just time to catch it,\" he said to 'Frisco Kid. \"Keep the cabin doors\nlocked, and don't let anybody come aboard. Here 's money. Eat at the\nrestaurants. Dry your blankets and sleep in the cockpit. I 'll be back\nto-morrow. And don't let anybody into that cabin. Good-by.\"\n\nWith a hasty hand-grip, he sped down the street to the depot. The conductor\nlooked at him with surprise when he punched his ticket. And well he might,\nfor it was not the custom of his passengers to travel in sea-boots and\nsou'westers. But Joe did not mind. He did not even notice. He had bought\na paper and was absorbed in its contents. Before long his eyes caught an\ninteresting paragraph:\n\n  SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN LOST\n\n  The tug _Sea Queen_, chartered by Bronson & Tate,\n  has returned from a fruitless cruise outside the\n  Heads. No news of value could be obtained\n  concerning the pirates who so daringly carried\n  off their safe at San Andreas last Tuesday night.\n  The lighthouse-keeper at the Farralones mentions\n  having sighted the two sloops Wednesday morning,\n  clawing offshore in the teeth of the gale. It is\n  supposed by shipping men that they perished in\n  the storm with, their ill-gotten treasure. Rumor\n  has it that, in addition to the ten thousand\n  dollars in gold, the safe contained papers of\n  great importance.\n\nWhen Joe had read this he felt a great relief. It was evident no one had\nbeen killed at San Andreas the night of the robbery, else there would\nhave been some comment on it in the paper. Nor, if they had had any clue\nto his own whereabouts, would they have omitted such a striking bit of\ninformation.\n\nAt the depot in San Francisco the curious onlookers were surprised to see\na boy clad conspicuously in sea-boots and sou'wester hail a cab and dash\naway. But Joe was in a hurry. He knew his father's hours, and was fearful\nlest he should not catch him before he went to lunch.\n\nThe office-boy scowled at him when he pushed open the door and asked to see\nMr. Bronson; nor could the head clerk, when summoned by this disreputable\nintruder, recognize him.\n\n\"Don't you know me, Mr. Willis?\"\n\nMr. Willis looked a second time. \"Why, it 's Joe Bronson! Of all things\nunder the sun, where did you drop from? Go right in. Your father 's in\nthere.\"\n\nMr. Bronson stopped dictating to his stenographer and looked up. \"Hello!\nWhere have you been?\" he said.\n\n\"To sea,\" Joe answered demurely, not sure of just what kind of a reception\nhe was to get, and fingering his sou'wester nervously.\n\n\"Short trip, eh? How did you make out?\"\n\n\"Oh, so-so.\" He had caught the twinkle in his father's eye and knew that\nit was all clear sailing. \"Not so bad--er--that is, considering.\"\n\n\"Considering?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly that; rather, it might have been worse, while it\ncould n't have been better.\"\n\n\"That 's interesting. Sit down.\" Then, turning to the stenographer:\n\"You may go, Mr. Brown, and--hum!--I won't need you any more to-day.\"\n\nIt was all Joe could do to keep from crying, so kindly and naturally had\nhis father received him, making him feel at once as if not the slightest\nthing uncommon had occurred. It seemed as if he had just returned from\na vacation, or, man-grown, had come back from some business trip.\n\n\"Now go ahead, Joe. You were speaking to me a moment ago in conundrums,\nand you have aroused my curiosity to a most uncomfortable degree.\"\n\nWhereupon Joe sat down and told what had happened--all that had\nhappened--from Monday night to that very moment. Each little incident\nhe related,--every detail,--not forgetting his conversations with\n'Frisco Kid nor his plans concerning him. His face flushed and he was\ncarried away with the excitement of the narrative, while Mr. Bronson\nwas almost as eager, urging him on whenever he slackened his pace,\nbut otherwise remaining silent.\n\n\"So you see,\" Joe concluded, \"it could n't possibly have turned out\nany better.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" Mr. Bronson deliberated judiciously, \"it may be so, and then\nagain it may not.\"\n\n\"I don't see it.\" Joe felt sharp disappointment at his father's qualified\napproval. It seemed to him that the return of the safe merited something\nstronger.\n\nThat Mr. Bronson fully comprehended the way Joe felt about it was clearly\nin evidence, for he went on: \"As to the matter of the safe, all hail to\nyou, Joe! Credit, and plenty of it, is your due. Mr. Tate and myself have\nalready spent five hundred dollars in attempting to recover it. So\nimportant was it that we have also offered five thousand dollars reward,\nand but this morning were considering the advisability of increasing the\namount. But, my son,\"--Mr. Bronson stood up, resting a hand affectionately\non his boy's shoulder,--\"there are certain things in this world which are\nof still greater importance than gold, or papers which represent what gold\nmay buy. How about _yourself_? That 's the point. Will you sell the best\npossibilities of your life right now for a million dollars?\"\n\nJoe shook his head.\n\n\"As I said, that 's the point. A human life the money of the world cannot\nbuy; nor can it redeem one which is misspent; nor can it make full and\ncomplete and beautiful a life which is dwarfed and warped and ugly. How\nabout yourself? What is to be the effect of all these strange adventures\non your life--_your_ life, Joe? Are you going to pick yourself up to-morrow\nand try it over again? or the next day? or the day after? Do you\nunderstand? Why, Joe, do you think for one moment that I would place\nagainst the best value of my son's life the paltry value of a safe? And\n_can_ I say, until time has told me, whether this trip of yours could not\npossibly have been better? Such an experience is as potent for evil as\nfor good. One dollar is exactly like another--there are many in the world:\nbut no Joe is like my Joe, nor can there be any others in the world to\ntake his place. Don't you see, Joe? Don't you understand?\"\n\nMr. Bronson's voice broke slightly, and the next instant Joe was sobbing\nas though his heart would break. He had never understood this father of\nhis before, and he knew now the pain he must have caused him, to say\nnothing of his mother and sister. But the four stirring days he had\nlived had given him a clearer view of the world and humanity, and he\nhad always possessed the power of putting his thoughts into speech; so\nhe spoke of these things and the lessons he had learned--the conclusions\nhe had drawn from his conversations with 'Frisco Kid, from his intercourse\nwith French Pete, from the graphic picture he retained of the _Reindeer_\nand Red Nelson as they wallowed in the trough beneath him. And Mr. Bronson\nlistened and, in turn, understood.\n\n\"But what of 'Frisco Kid, father?\" Joe asked when he had finished.\n\n\"Hum! there seems to be a great deal of promise in the boy, from what\nyou say of him.\" Mr. Bronson hid the twinkle in his eye this time. \"And,\nI must confess, he seems perfectly capable of shifting for himself.\"\n\n\"Sir?\" Joe could not believe his ears.\n\n\"Let us see, then. He is at present entitled to the half of five\nthousand dollars, the other half of which belongs to you. It was\nyou two who preserved the safe from the bottom of the Pacific, and\nif you only had waited a little longer, Mr. Tate and myself would\nhave increased the reward.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Joe caught a glimmering of the light. \"Part of that is easily\narranged. I simply refuse to take my half. As to the other--that is n't\nexactly what 'Frisco Kid desires. He wants friends--and--and--though\nyou did n't say so, they are far higher than money, nor can money buy\nthem. He wants friends and a chance for an education, not twenty-five\nhundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it would be better for him to choose for himself?\"\n\n\"Ah, no. That 's all arranged.\"\n\n\"Arranged?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He 's captain on sea, and I 'm captain on land. So he 's under\nmy charge now.\"\n\n\"Then you have the power of attorney for him in the present negotiations?\nGood. I 'll make you a proposition. The twenty-five hundred dollars shall\nbe held in trust by me, on his demand at any time. We 'll settle about\nyours afterward. Then he shall be put on probation for, say, a year--in\nour office. You can either coach him in his studies, for I am confident\nnow that you will be up in yours hereafter, or he can attend night-school.\nAnd after that, if he comes through his period of probation with flying\ncolors, I 'll give him the same opportunities for an education that you\npossess. It all depends on himself. And now, Mr. Attorney, what have you\nto say to my offer in the interests of your client?\"\n\n\"That I close with it at once.\"\n\nFather and son shook hands.\n\n\"And what are you going to do now, Joe?\"\n\n\"Send a telegram to 'Frisco Kid first, and then hurry home.\"\n\n\"Then wait a minute till I call up San Andreas and tell Mr. Tate the\ngood news, and then I 'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Willis,\" Mr. Bronson said as they left the outer office, \"the\nSan Andreas safe is recovered, and we 'll all take a holiday. Kindly\ntell the clerks that they are free for the rest of the day. And I\nsay,\" he called back as they entered the elevator, \"don't forget the\noffice-boy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cruise of the Dazzler, by Jack London\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CRUISE OF THE DAZZLER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11051-8.txt or 11051-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/1\/0\/5\/11051\/\n\nProduced by Justin Gillbank and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":795,"split":"train"}
